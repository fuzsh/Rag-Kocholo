        "text": "Sunday | 10.01\n\nWhat: The Brook & The Bluff w/Bendigo Fletcher\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: The members of The Brook & The Bluff grew up in the same neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama and after forming in 2016 built their songwriting on a foundation of folk rock’s observational lyrics and delicate melodies. But the band relocated to Nashville in 2018 and self-released its self-titled debut album that same year. Since then the group has garnered a wide national audience and in 2023 the band independently released its latest album, Bluebeard. If 2021’s Yard Sale was inspired by capturing the feel of 1970s Laurel Canyon folk rock the new record even more closely embraces modern production and sounds with touches of R&B and hip-hop in the mix including vocal processing akin to an unexpected influence on the group in Frank Ocean. So if you’re expecting a show of the indie folk sound that launched the band you will get to experience plenty of that but also an evolution of that aesthetic.\n\nSunday | 10.01\n\nWhat: Nothing But Thieves w/Kid Kapichi\n\nWhen: 6:30 doors/7:15 show\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: English alternative rock band Nothing But Thieves released its fourth album Dead Club City in June 2023. Like its 2020 predecessor Moral Panic the album is step away from its hard rock sound of the early period of the band’s career. But this has only meant a broader emotional palette and songwriting range. Still intact is the group’s knack for anthemic epics and the thoughtful lyrics that have been there from the beginning and more than a bit of that early grit in the live shows.\n\nMonday | 10.02\n\nWhat: Igorrr w/Melt Banana and Otto Von Schirach\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Igorrr is the stage name of Gautier Serre who combines classical music, black metal, breakcore structure and production and trip hop into strange yet compelling combination of all of those in a way that might appeal to fans of Mr. Bungle and Secret Chiefs 3 who genre splice plenty on their own. Since 2017 Igorrr has been a full band and its most recent album Spirituality and Distortion (2020) ruthlessly and rapidly jump cuts styles and rhythms so that at times it is reminiscent of Aphex Twin and at others like Naked City mashed up with 8-bit music. So opening this tour in addition to breakcore/industrial weirdo Otto Von Schirach you get to witness the genre smashing, Japanese experimental band Melt Banana who themselves fuse grindcore, industrial, breakcore, noise rock, pop and dance music into a furious and coherent whole that evolves over the course of a song. Sometimes the band has so much sonic momentum it can be genuinely and thrillingly overwhelming. Consistently one of the greatest live bands you’ll see all year.\n\nTuesday | 10.03\n\nWhat: Avskum w/Resistant Culture and Poison Tribe\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Avskum formed in Sweden in 1982 and has been one of the foundational bands of international D-beat and hardcore. Currently touring in support of its latest album En Annan Värld Är Möjlig. Opening are two of Denver’s own fine practitioners of the raw hardcore arts Resistant Culture and Poison Tribe.\n\nTuesday | 10.03\n\nWhat: Tool w/Emily Wolfe https://www.treventscomplex.com/events/detail/tool\n\nWhen: 6:30 doors/8 show\n\nWhere: Budweiser Events Center\n\nWhy: Tool occupies a unique place in rock music history as having emerged in Los Angeles at a time when glam metal was king and art rock bands like Tool were an anomaly that would come to benefit from the cultural tsunami that was alternative music. But Tool didn’t quite fit into that milieu either other than being different and having lyrics that were about subjects and from perspectives that were at an angle decided out of step with the mainstream. But its elaborate and ambitious songwriting and creative vision weathered the backlash against alternative music in the mid-90s precisely because it offered something unusual and forward thinking and wasn’t directly connected with a musical trend that was washing out and being replaced, for the most part, with a less vital version. The band has always operated on its own time and on its own terms supported by a cult following and it has used its status to help shine a light on other interesting artists of its time including bands that were a direct influence like King Crimson. In 2019 Tool released its first album in 13 years, Fear Inoculum. The sprawling release was vintage Tool with its intricate yet hypnotic song structures and themes of aging and reflecting on one’s experiences and whether or not one’s accumulated knowledge constitutes wisdom. Opening this tour is talented, hard blues rock guitarist/songwriter Emily Wolfe whose new album the political and gloriously brash The Blowback releases on October 20, 2023.\n\nWednesday | 10.04\n\nWhat: Chris Farren\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Chris Farren, gotta give it to him, to call his 2023 album Doom Singer (Polyvinyl Records) because look at the world. And partly because his often surreal and irreverent humor and sense of irony informs not just his lyrics but music videos like that for “Cosmic Leash” and his presentation of the music generally. But in that humor Farren isn’t hiding the heartfelt emotions and his songs are often emotionally vibrant epics that have a vulnerability built into the bluster which sets him very much apart from many artists. One might call it emo and it has that sing along vibe but tempered with a self-awareness one might expect of a musician who came out of the DIY underground.\n\nThursday | 10.05\n\nWhat: Roselit Bone w/Snakes and King Ropes\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Roselit Bone released its new album Ofrenda in August 2023. The title refers to an offering placed in a home alter during the Mexican Dia de Los Muertos. The album itself is a blend of Americana, folk and rock and roll in the spirited and vulnerable style that has made the band one of the most interesting and creative groups in the larger realm of Americana of the past decade. Sure you can hear some of those rockabilly roots but more in the vein of how X and Gun Club did it than less colorful trad genre practitioners. Bozeman, Montana’s King Ropes offer a different flavor of Americana and one more steeped in glam rock and Lou Reed with some nods to more experimental soundscaping. Snakes from Denver is sort of a super group of Mile High City luminaries of folk, Americana and indie rock meaning its own music is decided not cookie cutter and the songwriting more informed by an actual vibe and individual aesthetic and thoughtful lyricism.\n\nThursday | 10.05\n\nWhat: Jesse Jo Stark w/Rachel Bobbitt and Rachel Lynn\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Meow Wolf Convergence Station\n\nWhy: Canadian singer-songwriter Rachel Bobbitt released her latest EP in August, The Half We Still Have, produced and mixed by Jorge Elbrecht who spends a good deal of time in Denver these days and who has worked with the likes of Sky Ferreira and Japanese Breakfast. Bobbitt’s tender and bright vocals and orchestral songwriting lends an uplift even to songs that are all too real in their melancholic content. “Two Bit”is a song about how overwhelming feelings, positive or what we think of as positive or not so much, in our youth can get us to bypass our instincts and the guilt and shame that can come over you in looking back at that time of life. And the rest of the EP offers similarly insightful, nuanced and layered songs of both emotional and sonic depth. Headlining the show is pop singer and fashion designer Jesse Jo Stark who is touring in support of her 2022 album DOOMED.\n\nFriday | 10.06\n\nWhat: Autumn Light: Victoria Lundy, Mark Mosher, Monoscenes\n\nWhen: 8-10pm\n\nWhere: Lumonics Light & Sound Gallery (800 East 73rd Avenue Unit #11, Denver, CO 80229)\n\nWhy: Three of the great local electronic artists immersed in the world of synthesizing visuals and music are gathering at Lumonics Light & Sound Gallery for a special event in a space that is an immersive light and sculpture gallery currently showcasing the work of Dorothy and Mel Tanner. Lundy and Mosher can also be seen performing in Carbon Dioxide Ensemble with Thomas Lundy crafting inspired pieces of musique concrète.\n\nFriday | 10.06\n\nWhat: Slowdive w/Drab Majesty\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Cervantes’ Masterpiece Ballroom\n\nWhy: Influential shoegaze band Slowdive is touring in support of its latest record Everything Is Alive. The group has long term proven itself to be one of the more experimental of the first wave of shoegaze artists by incorporating deep elements of ambient and electronic dance music into its sound beginning with its 1993 and second album Souvlaki and much more dramatically with its 1995 masterpiece Pygmalion. When the band reconvened in 2014 it demonstrated its live power as a group with performances that were as immersive and as lush as they were sonically commanding on par with any of its peers. When its 2017 self-titled album was released there might have been doubts that the band would repeat past glory but instead the record represented a new and worthy creative chapter for the band. Opening is modern darkwave phenom Drab Majesty which started as a solo project but has been a duo for several years now. Its music has been like a modern take on a blend of Red Lorry Yellow Lorry and Cocteau Twins but really with its own flavor that embraced electronic music early on with superb guitar work and evocative vocals. It too has a 2023 release An Object In Motion to which Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell contributed vocals.\n\nFriday | 10.06\n\nWhat: Calamity album release w/Allison Lorenzen and Soy Celesté\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: CALAMITY began as the solo project of Kate Hannington whose journey to her current musical endeavors has been unorthodox, circuitous and in the end seemingly inevitable as a culmination of a life in creative work in various ends of that world. Hannington grew up in the Cleveland are and was involved in performing classical music as an oboe player who initially went to college to be in the sciences but found that deeply unsatisfying despite having a gift for engineering and she went on to New York City and ultimately earned a degree in music and got involved in the avant-garde music community in the city. But Hannington found herself at a life crossroads again and landed a job in Denver working on repairing musical instruments and then working in an engineering capacity for a major defense contractor near the Mile High City and discovered the local underground music world. Falling in with a circle of friends including Chris Adolf, Joe Sampson and Adam Baumeister Hannington found a group of people with whom to casually perform and exchange ideas in weekly get-togethers. Out of that milieu she started writing the songs that would form the core of the music for the early CALAMITY which she performed at the open mic at Syntax Physic Opera just in time for the COVID-19 pandemic to hit. It was around that time that Hannington had been working on her latest live film score in collaboration with a friend. The extended time off from even having performing live as an option allowed Hannington the time to refocus on her decision to make music a priority as it was the only thing over the course of a successful regular work life that felt like where she wanted to be. When shows started happening again, CALAMITY became an active project and most often during 2022. The musical style would be difficult to narrow down to something definitive except to say that it has elements of shoegaze, left field punk, Americana and all united by strong songwriting and Hannington’s powerful and expressive voice and strong stage presence. All of this can be heard strikingly on the debut CALAMITY full-length Chiromancy. From the gorgeously symbolic cover art to the vividly captured and produced recordings there is a unified intentionality that seems obvious in every detail. Hannington’s stories hit as deeply personal but also as a widely relatable set of narratives of letting go of relationships, the beliefs, the habits and associations that hold us back from a fulfilling and rewarding life and moving on toward it. Listen to our interview with Hannington on the Queen City Sounds Podcast.\n\nFriday | 10.06\n\nWhat: Mac Sabbath at The Oriental w/Cybertronic Spree and Playboy Manbaby\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Mac Sabbath is the enigmatic Black Sabbath parody tribute band from Los Angeles that dresses up in costume as the characters from the McDonald’s franchise. The cover songs have name changes like “Sweet Beef” for “Sweet Leaf” and “Frying Pan” for “Iron Man.” Led by Ronald Osbourne and managed by Mike Odd, lead singer of hard rock outfit Rosemary’s Billygoat, who handles interviews and does other promotional activity to keep the group’s outlandish mythology in the public eye. It could be mere gimmick and kitsch, which it is, but with solid musicianship and a commitment to the bit that is rare in an entertainment milieu that so often rewards individual ego.\n\nSaturday | 10.07\n\nWhat: Cavalera: The Morbid Devastation Tour w/Exhumed, Incite and No Future\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Cavalera is a heavy metal band that consists of brothers Max and Igor Cavalera who founded influential thrash and death metal band Sepultura in 1984. The brothers had a falling out and Max left Sepultura in 1996 followed by Igor in 2006. Within a year the brothers reconciled and formed a new project that would undergo various name changes including Cavalera Conspiracy. But now Cavalera is releasing re-recording versions of Sepultura classics. 2023 saw the release of new versionf of Bestial Devastation (1985) and Morbid Visions (1986) and thus the name of the tour with a full band that by watching some of the leaked live footage seems to point to the vitality of the source material and the Cavalera brothers’ reinvention of themselves.\n\nSaturday | 10.07\n\nWhat: Yeule w/SASAMI\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nSaturday | 10.07\n\nWhat: DROELOE w/NASAYA and Demotapes\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nSaturday | 10.07\n\nWhat: Meet the Giant w/The Picture Tour and …And The Black Feathers\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Enigma Bazaar\n\nWhy: Meet the Giant recently released its new album We Are Revolting and didn’t exactly get a chance to do an album release show or other such typical rituals of celebration. But at this show you’ll get to hear a good deal of that material from a band that is steeped both in highly emotional hard rock and electronic production and sensibilities without fitting neatly into some already established and discredited hybrid like industrial rock though fans of that might appreciate MTG’s more atmospheric and vulnerable manifestation of similar creative impulses. …And The Black Feathers somehow makes blues rock, punk and glam rock work in a cohesive style with commanding performances. The Picture Show could devolve into The Cure worship but Billy Armijo’s knack for pop songcraft and bordeom with a rote, paint by numbers version of gloomy post-punk and shoegaze has ensured that former Emerald Siam lead guitarist continues to make deeply evocative and inventive guitar rock with his new bandmates.\n\nSunday | 10.08\n\nWhat: Slow Pulp w/Babehoven\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Slow Pulp from Madison, Wisconsin just released its sophomore album Yard on September 29, 2023. The band’s gift for fusing earnest bedroom pop and fuzzy 90s-esque indie rock in a way that gives off shoegaze adjacent vibes but channeled into succinct statements of modern malaise and yearning for more meaningful and life affirming connections and experiences rather than the drab and second-rate fair we’re expected to think is adequate and deserved. Fans of Bully and Liz Fair will appreciate what Slow Pulp has to offer.\n\nSunday | 10.08\n\nWhat: Djunah w/Quits and Almanac Man\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Djunah’s 2023 album Femina Furens is a ferocious and intense display of what might be called art noise rock. Hailing from Chicago the duo live hits like what a blues rock and jazz band with chops might sound like if they challenged themselves to do something radically different with their skill set. Emotionally distorted vocals and dynamics that from tense and quiet to unfurled rage and despair transformed into bursts of reclaiming one’s power make the new set of songs a riveting listen. Denver’s noise rock kings Quits are releasing their new album Feeling It for this show. Yes, these guys have been in the local scene for years and worth checking out for that etc. But if the raw power of the songs and the performance thereof wasn’t there the band would be like any other rock group today that was inspired by Amphetamine Reptile and Touch and Go and the like. Quits deliver surreal yet poetically observational lyrics that comment on the conflicted and challenging world and times we all navigate. Quits turns those frustrations into a fractured and seething catharsis on the album and definitely on stage where there’s no barrier between you and the pure expression thereof. Almanac Man is also one of Denver’s handful of fine noise rock bands who probably grew up listening to and seeing Gravity Records bands and catching the punk-adjacent but too weird bands of the 90s and 2000s while absorbing that inspiration for their own brand of sonically disruptive excitement.\n\nSunday | 10.08\n\nWhat: The Chats and Cosmic Psychos\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: The Chats from Sunshine Coast, Queensland, Australia make no bones about their irreverence with album titles like High Risk Behavior (2020) and Get Fucked (2022). But it’s not just the thrill of using swear words in the adolescent way that is the appeal of the band’s music because they take aim at collective anxieties and “racism in surf culture.” Musically imagine an even more nervous energy-driven Stiff Little Fingers and its punk sound a perfect splicing together of protopunk, anarcho punk and honest to goodness pop hooks. Like if Wire was really going for broke toward the most abrupt start and stop dynamics of Pink Flag. Opening this show are Aussie punk legends Cosmic Psychos who have been giving us a wonderful unvarnished noisy punk that at times is reminiscent of a more punk Motorhead and even more raw The Gordons with shout along choruses and a surprising bit of melodicism that tempers that edge just a little without blunting it.\n\nMonday | 10.09\n\nWhat: Lebanon Hanover w/Hex Cassette and DJ Katastrophy\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Lebanon Hanover is a darkwave/post-punk band from Germany whose deeply atmospheric music doesn’t fit neatly into the aforementioned categories as elements of ambient and world music are in the mix. Particularly on its 2020 album Sci-Fi Sky. Guitar lopes along in a song or two in chord progressions one hears more often in music from the Arabic world and all drifting on the foundation of EBM beats and brooding vocals. Hex Cassette brings his blood cult and bombastic live stage presence to the show opening with his unique brand of industrial darkwave and rock theater.\n\nMonday | 10.09\n\nWhat: Boris and Melvins\n\nWhen: 7pm doors, 7:30 pm show\n\nWhere: The Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Two titans of sludge rock on one bill with Japan’s Boris and The Melvins from the USA. Chances are Melvins were an influence on Boris in some capacity along the way as the trio originally from Washington State has been for a huge swath of alternative rock and heavier music. Boris may play a weird blend of heavy metal, psychedelia, noise and art rock but its own stage antics are unusual and theatrical like there’s a ritual component to it that is impossible to define but which is always striking. Melvins somehow keep playing one of the greatest shows you’ll see all year with its own mix of playfulness, precise power in the performance and an effusive spirit and energy.\n\nTuesday | 10.10\n\nWhat: Dope Lemon w/Franklin Jonas\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Angus Stone has come a long way since performing at open mics with his sister Julia in their hometown of Sydney, Australia in 2005. Since 2016 he has performed under the moniker Dope Lemon and his idiosyncratic pop songs have dipped liberally into the realms of folk, psychedelia and soul. There is a left field sense of humor informing the presentation of his songs in music videos and a playful, even impish, spirit to his visual style as a live performer. But the music itself is a sensitive, thoughtful, gentle, acutely observational meditation on everyday human existence and with a keen ear for evolving melodies and the physicality of the rhythms. His new album Kimosabé dropped on September 29, 2023 and the videos so far a mix of Simon Hanselmann-esque animation and Zack Galifianakis gone 1980s spoiled rock star gangster vibe are truly some of the most entertaining offerings from any artist in the last few years.\n\nTuesday | 10.10\n\nWhat: The Darkness w/The Comancheros\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: The Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: The Darkness survived the hype many predicted would collapse in on the band when it garnered a good deal of it when its 2003 debut album Permission to Land basically presaged the unabashed classic rock and glam metal revival that would happen in full the following decade. Singer Justin Hawkins’ soaring vocals, the specific style of driving rhythms and the effusive guitar solos were basically banished to an earlier decade and yet The Darkness rocketed to stardom because even if you rolled your eyes at the throwback style, at least the band delivered a commanding live show with conviction. Most bands eager to do more than just settling for playing to friends and local fans have to believe in their own importance and even exult in it. The Darkness just had the songwriting and chops and stage presence to be more than a gimmick. But the pressure to sustain that momentum caught up with the band and it split in 2006 after seeming to have run out of some steam and person issues within its membership. But in 2011 the original group reconvened and over the next few years Rufus Taylor, son of Roger Taylor of Queen joined on drums. The Darkness’ most recent album Motorheart (2021) revealed more than just a hint of the influence of thrash around the edges so the version of the band you’ll get to see won’t skimp on the hearty, melodic hard rock that earned it the popularity it has enjoyed but it might have a little more edge in the guitar work.\n\nThursday | 10.12\n\nWhat: Kneecap w/Time/Calm. and An Hobbes\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Kneecap is an alternative hip hop trio from Belfast, Northern Ireland whose known for rapping in Irish and political activism for human rights at home and abroad. Fifteen years ago there was pretty much no rap in the Irish language and Kneecap has garnered a bit of notoriety for writing a song that was banned from Irish language radio for “drug references and cursing” which the group said was a satire of life for young people in Belfast. But Kneecap’s body of work has challenged conventional notions of masculinity and political power structures with beats that could come right out of a punk band if that band used samples. One of the opening acts Time (really Calm., the duo of Time and AwareNess) is no stranger to nuanced and sharp takes on politics and culture with creative beats that free associate musical ideas from experimental music and classic hip-hop sensibilities. Time aka Chris Steele is an internationally recognized author and activist whose writing on class and human rights include well received interviews with Noam Chomsky and mutual aid efforts.\n\nFriday | 10.13\n\nWhat: emme w/Astral Tomb, Polly Urethane, Coldglare, Hyasynth, Trenchfoot and Combat Sport\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: emme might be described as a performance artist whose accompanying music fits within a loose realm of industrial noise with elements of pop accessibility like a deconstruction of dance music and a subversion of noisenik expectation of format for presentation and generally accepted aesthetics and methods. So of course Polly Urethane from Denver is an appropriate artist to share the bill whose shows can range from almost pure performance art to industrial pop and deconstructed scene nü metal to industrial noise, classical music sampling and operatic vocals and pop songcraft. The first half of the show will be live music and the second half running into the late night will be more DJ sets.\n\nFriday | 10.13\n\nWhat: Church Fire tour kickoff w/Voight, Weathered Statues and Bell Mine\n\nWhen: 9 doors 9:30 show\n\nWhere: The Broadway Roxy\n\nWhy: Church Fire are set to go out for three weeks taking its playfully confrontational yet emotionally vulnerable and harrowing industrial dance music to places far and wide. A reformed Voight will treat you to industrialized shoegaze post-punk and maybe a bad joke or two. Weathered Statues is the most pure death rock/post-punk band out of Denver aside from maybe Plague Garden and definitely for fans of Xmal Deutschland and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Bell Mine is an electro-acoustic ambient synth pop band with lushly elegant production.\n\nFriday | 10.13\n\nWhat: Corsicana album release w/Joseph Lamar and Gazes\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Mercury Café\n\nWhy: Corsicana is celebrating the release of its new album Kept with this show sharing the stage with experimental R&B and psychedelic pop artist Joseph Lamar and avant-indie rock trio supergroup Gazes which includes former members of Tyto Alba and Male Blonding. Kept is another collection of keenly observed indie rock in that more soft tone shoegaze vein. The album is being released on digital and limited edition vinyl.\n\nSaturday | 10.14\n\nWhat: JOHN w/Tunic and Supreme Joy\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: JOHN (TIMESTWO) is an acclaimed punk duo from London, UK that recently released its fourth album A Life Diagrammatic. With just guitar from Johnny Healey and John Newton on drums and vocals, the group’s driving and intense yet emotionally nuanced songs hit with the force of the conviction of the lyrics that often examine the pitfalls of modern life and the corrosive effects of capitalism as it has been crushing down on most of us all our lives. Within the band’s music you can hear warps and bends in the rhythm and tones to amplify a sense of liberated thrill and sense of freedom in the music as an act of resistance. Touring with JOHN this time out is Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada’s noise rock trio Tunic. In April Tunic released its own new record Wrong Dream which sounds like new territory for the group and some of its most emotionally devastating material to date. It has a similarly disciplined structure and rhythm one might expect from earlier releases but with great splashes of spiky noise and fragmented emotion reflecting not only personal turmoil but a deeply human reaction to the seemingly myriad barrage of challenges floating around the world like a caustic, psychic pollution.Opening is Denver’s Supreme Joy, a band that is an outlet for the more lo-fi garage-y post-punk songwriting of Ryan Wong who some may know for his membership in psychedelic pop rock band Easy Ease, having been in psych garage band Cool Ghouls and more recently for his fine country songcraft.\n\nFriday and Saturday | 10.13 and 10.14\n\nWhat: The Mountain Goats w/Mikaela Davis\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Fox Theatre (10.13) and Gothic Theatre (10.14)\n\nWhy: The Mountain Goats are one of the most beloved indie rock bands going. Led by frontman, guitarist and primary songwriter John Darnielle since its foundation in 1991, The Mountain Goats have somehow managed to have some great consistency of style and sound without seeming to ever stuck in a rut. The earnest and scrappy energy of the songs and Darnielle’s literary yet not pretentious lyrics seem to tap into some element of the zeitgeist at the time of writing that brings a freshness of spirit to inform the performances and sound. Its 2023 album Jenny From Thebes sounds like it had to have been written by a newer band maybe two or three years into its career speaking to Darnielle’s ability to reinvent yet dip into the well of his legacy in creative ways.\n\nSaturday | 10.14\n\nWhat: The Happy Fits w/Windser and Hot Freaks\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Fox Theatre\n\nWhy: The Happy Fits’ sound seems like it was influenced a bit by late 2000s indie rock when bands were trying to figure out how to be joyous and embrace their quirky sense of humor without having to lean too hard into being self-aware. Its own unabashedly upbeat songs have thus been able to be able to have some fun with what it’s like to be an imperfect human dealing with the multiple excessive demands of modern life but having fun with it in a way that is unmistakable but not dire. It’s a nice balancing trick and to do so with a free-spirited energy in the form of catchy pop songs is no mean feat. Windser released his debut EP Where The Redwoods Meet the Sea in 2022 with its handful of songs that aimed to capture his memories of earlier in life resulting in a dreamlike and nostalgic that felt like a reconciliation of the past with the present. His newer singles “Get Lost” and “Friends I Barely Know” take the concepts of the EP and expands upon them for an effect like a dream pop version of The War on Drugs.\n\nSunday | 10.15\n\nWhat: Ulrika Spacek w/Holy Wave and Wave Decay\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Ulrika Spacek from London, UK sounds like it absorbed a great deal of krautrock and 60s and 70s avant-garde music on its 2023 album Compact Trauma but channeled it into a kind of synthesis of art-y post-punk, math rock and psychedelia. Definitely for fans of FACs. Holy Wave from Austin, TX brings to this show its spectral, drifty, synth-driven psychedelic pop and currently supporting its new record Five of Cups. Wave Decay fuses motorik beats with heavy shoegaze guitar wizardry.\n\nMonday | 10.16\n\nWhat: Better Lovers w/Suicide Cages and Muscle Beach\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Better Lovers started in 2023 bringing together Stephen Micciche, Clayton Holyoak and Jordan Buckley formerly of prominent metalcore band Everytime I Die with Will Putney of Fit For An Autopsy and Greg Pusciato who some may know as the frontman for influential metalcore group Dillinger Escape Plan, darkwave outfit The Black Queen and alt metal supergroup Killer Be Killed. The lead single from the band “30 Under 13” and the debut EP God Made Me an Animal are a bit of what you might expect which is to say the fusion of hardcore and extreme metal done right and with a furious energy that has translated well to its live shows thus far. Opening this Denver show are two heavy hitters from that world of where extreme metal and hardcore collide with Suicide Cages and Muscle Beach. If what Better Lovers is doing is your thing definitely catch the locals for this gig.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday | 10.17 and 10.18\n\nWhat: Hozier w/Madison Cunningham\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Hozier is artist from Ireland whose blend of folk, blues and blue-eyed soul hit the big time with his 2013 single “Take Me To Church” and seemed to have come out of nowhere at age 23. But Andrew Hozier-Byrne was a member of choral group Anúna from 2007 to 2012. The song to those that didn’t delve deeper might have seemed like some call to go back to one’s roots in traditional culture but the song addressed homophobia and the bare bones music video went viral through Reddit. Since then Hozier has built upon his early boost for a career of earnest and impassioned songwriting and on point activism. Opening these shows is Madison Cunningham whose third album, 2022’s Revealer, won a Grammy for “Best Folk Album.” Often those awards don’t mean much and Cunningham’s record features unorthodox instrumentation for a folk album including electric guitar and keyboards but her spirited vocals and inventive musicianship is right out of the folk tradition and channeled into a pop format with guitar work that shifts effortlessly between the intricate and the spare to perfectly suit the mood of the moment. Fans of Neko Case and Jenny Lewis’ own more folk-oriented songs will appreciate what Cunningham has to offer.\n\nWednesday | 10.18\n\nWhat: Holy Fawn w/Carcara and lowheaven\n\nWhen: 6:30\n\nWhere: Meow Wolf Convergence Station\n\nWhy: Cosmic black metal band Holy Fawn returns to Denver with a show at Meow Wolf to demonstrate its arresting and moving fusion of black metal, ambient music and at times emo. Philadelphia-based post-hardcore group Caracara will offer the kind of music that sounds like punk kids that got into shoegaze through rediscovering the more atmospheric end of stuff like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate and injected tender and raw emotions into driving yet ethereal melodies. Toronto’s lowheaven is somehow screamo, dark post-punk and space rock in a way that might remind some of when Coalesce got a little weird.\n\nWednesday | 10.18\n\nWhat: Laufey w/Adam Melchor\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Laufey is an Icelandic singer-songwriter who describes her particular musical style as “modern jazz.” What that means when you listen is the kind of sensibility like something out of a jazz club in the 1960s maybe in a more Southern European or South American country with a touch of pop Bossa Nova. Laufey grew up around classical music with a grandfather who was a violin teacher in China at the Central Conservatory of Music and in her teens she was a cello solist with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra and later graduated from Berklee. Her debut EP Typical of Me garnered her critical acclaim and won a fan in Billie Eilish. In 2023 Laufey released her second full length Bewitched which has the kind of sonic touches and sophistication of composition one would expect from a Rodgers and Hammerstein production but applied to the relative short scale of lush and emotionally delicate jazz pop songs. Also on this bill is Adam Melchor who began making a name for himself writing lullabies. But he’s greatly expanded upon what he learned from operating in that modest format. Yet there is a hushed, delicate aspect to his songwriting paired with warm, earnest, thoughtful observations that at times might be considered lullabies for adults. His latest EP Fruitlands has a quality like short snapshots reflecting slices of life yearning for something more meaningful and reflecting on the small joys in life cast in vivid and instantly relatable details and hazy melodies.\n\nWednesday | 10.18\n\nWhat: Claudio Simonetti’s Goblin Live Screening of Dario Argento’s and Lamberto Bava’s Demons Goblin\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Paramount Theatre\n\nWhy: Claudio Simonetti was one of the founding members of Italian progressive rock band Goblin who are perhaps best known for their soundtracks for some of the great horror films of the 1970s and 1980s including Dario Argento’s Profondo Rosso aka Deep Red (1975) and Suspiria (1977) as well as Argento’s cut of George Romer’s Dawn of the Dead (1978). But the group basically dissolved in 1982 and its members went on to other projects including Simonetti scoring Argento’s 1985 film with another horror legend Lamberto Bava and Demons. This is of course a live screening of the film with Claudio Simonetti’s version of Goblin.\n\nThursday | 10.19\n\nWhat: Darlingside\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Boston’s Darlingside released its latest album Everything Is Alive in 2023 and it sounds like something written to reflect a day of deep reflection and small journeys visiting friends and being reminded of the memories that anchor your psyche after a long period of feeling adrift without realizing it. Its orchestrated arrangements preserve an intimate feel with instrumental performances that sound like you are there playing the music yourself and joining in on not just the music but the psychological journey undertaken to reconnect with oneself. If this is indie folk it’s more in the vein of more existential artists like Iron & Wine and anyone else with a foot in psychedelic folk of the 70s and one in modern production methods that help to render the sonic details of the songwriting in vivid contrasts.\n\nFriday | 10.20\n\nWhat: Sextile and N8NOFACE\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Sextile is a post-punk band from Los Angeles that has been releasing music for several years that focuses on lush and hazy soundscapes and ethereal melodies. Particularly on its 2023 album Push. The effect is more like a shoegaze band and one steeped in electronic soundscaping. The new record feels like a 90s downtempo band with a different sound palette and an ear for tonal melancholia. N8NOFACE is an electro punk artist whose aggressive and distorted electronic beats is reminiscent of something like Realicide with similarly pointed lyrical content.\n\nSaturday | 10.21\n\nWhat: Acid Mothers Temple w/The Stargazer Lilies and Night Fishing\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Acid Mothers Temple has been together since 1995 under the leadership of guitarist Kawabata Makoto and its alchemical fusion of krautrock, Japanese folk, noise, space rock and cosmic glam has kept its sound fresh over the course of various incarnations and lineups with live shows that are as mind-altering and as intense as the name of the band suggests. The Stargazer Lilies sound like a thoroughly entrancing mix of some trippy 60s hip lounge film and futuristic, epic journey through a star rich sector of outer space. It has a transcendent, luminous quality and a sense of mystery that one would have to peel back decades of jaded and conditioned music listening to remember how it felt to first hear Slowdive’s album Pygmalion to recapture but you can just go ahead and see the band touring with its 2022 album Cosmic Tidal Wave living up to its name as well.\n\nSaturday | 10.21\n\nWhat: Botch w/Primitive Man\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Botch is the legendary and influential metalcore/mathcore band from Tacoma, Washington that formed in 1993 and for nearly a decade helped to define a sound and an attitude of a movement throughout that time that was not in line with the prevailing threads of alternative rock, metal or hardcore. But its abrasive and driving sound didn’t lack for mood and atmospherics and one could easily imagine the band sharing bills with the likes of Unwound and Heroin. The group reformed in 2022 and this is its first wide national tour. Opening is Primitive Man whose own brutally heavy version of metal has some roots in noise rock and hardcore as well with its own internationally respected gift for sculpting sounds and moods that feel like an indisputable truth of human existence given sonic form.\n\nSaturday | 10.21\n\nWhat: Midwife w/Fainting Dreams and Kelly Garlick\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Mercury Café\n\nWhy: Midwife brings her heartbreaking ambient folk heaviness to the Mercury for a night with dream pop legends in the making Fainting Dreams and avant-ambient and musique concrète producer Kelly Garlick whose own emotionally rich compositions hit heavily in the feels as well.\n\nSunday | 10.22\n\nWhat: Deeper w/World’s Worst and Gazes\n\nWhen: 8/8:30\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Deeper from Chicago has long been a band for connoisseurs of post-punk with its live show hitting like an angular version of The Cure with its rich synth tones and the physicality of its rhythms. Its 2023 album Careful! doesn’t feel like as much of an exorcism of anguished emotions as its 2020 album Auto-Pain but the math-y changes are evocative and pull you into the momentum of the music and its unconventional melodies with vocals seeming to strike a certain tenor and the synths at a complimentary counter resonance. The songs have great forward momentum but the emotional range is wide and the soundscapes easy to get lost following. Gazes is a dream pop/post-punk band consisting of former members of the great dream pop group Tyto Alba and local post-punk greats Male Blonding. World’s Worst is an emo-informed post-punk band with shoegaze leanings from Salt Lake City.\n\nMonday | 10.23\n\nWhat: The Brian Jonestown Massacre w/Asteroid No. 4\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: The Brian Jonestown Massacre is the long-running and influential psychedelic rock band originally from the Bay Area now based in Berlin where leader, lyricist, songwriter, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Anton Newcombe lives and has his studio. The BJM’s latest album The Future Is Your Past (2023) has garnered great critical acclaim with some writers saying how it’s the group’s best record in years. And sure it has that signature finely crafted fusion of folk psychedelia and other musical styles infused so deeply into the songcraft it feels like Newcombe is operating on a conceptual as much as broadly emotional level as a songwriter with an ear for fine details. Sure you’ll hear classic BJM elements but within this new set of songs you’ll hear Newcombe’s gift for reinvention without the need to scrap what he’s done before unless it serves the art in moving forward and you’ll hear plenty of musical experimentation and for the discerning listener his latest passions in experimenting with musicianship and production. At the show you’ll likely see one of the classic lineups playing some of your favorite songs from the band’s back catalog but maybe even some of the excellent new material.\n\nTuesday | 10.24\n\nWhat: Blonde Redhead w/Angelica Garcia\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Blonde Redhead proved itself worthy of interest and its own creative evolution throughout the 90s and 2000s with going from a more noisy, No Wave-esque art-y post-punk of its early days to a shift toward more lush sounds and introspective dream pop around the turn of the century. All along the group’s songwriting ambition was clear if not overtly stated and the arc of albums from 2000’s Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons, 2004’s Misery Is a Butterfly and 23 from 2007 firmly established the group as a powerful live presence with thoughtful and thought-provoking albums that reached wider audiences. After 2014’s Barragán, Blonde Redhead didn’t release much new material though vocalist/keyboardist/guitarist Kazu Makino released her first solo album Adult Baby in 2019 with guest performances from Ryuichi Sakamoto, Ian Chang (Son Lux), Greg Saunier (Deerhoof) and Mauro Refosco. In 2023 Blonde Redhead dropped its new album Sit Down for Dinner, a record of what might be described as tranquil, pastoral soundscape pop sprinkled with field recordings and arranged like a minimalist, experimental jazz record but still brimming with the vibrant emotional nuance that has made its best material so entrancing.\n\nTuesday | 10.24\n\nWhat: Fearing w/Sacred Skin\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Crypt\n\nWhy: Fearing made a name for itself in the heady days of 2010s darkwave and the then post-punk revival with its moody take on a death rock sound that would become de rigeur in certain circles of post-punk. That is to say somewhat lo-fi but using that aesthetic to create a tinge of mystery rather than simply chasing a style. What sets it apart from some cookie cutter post-punk is the elegantly gorgeous guitar work and ear for atmospherics over driving and present low end. The group is currently touring in support of its latest record Destroyer.\n\nTuesday | 10.24\n\nWhat: Wolves in the Throne Room w/Blackbraid, Garea and Hoaxed\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: The Oriental Theater\n\nWhy: Wolves in the Throne Room released its new EP Crypt of Ancestral Knowledge on September 29, 2023 via Relapse Records. Across its long career WITTR have explored various expressions of its roots in black metal, folk and ambient music including an entire album of synthesizer music Celestite (2014) as a companion record to its 2011 album Celestial Lineage. Around the time of that album the group announced it would reduce its touring cycle of old and for a time seeing the band live wasn’t as common an occurrence and even now a chance to see its majestic and pastoral, deeply atmospheric, transcendental black metal is a rare treat. Not a band for black metal purists, the new EP sounds like a blend of all its creative impulses for a set of songs that are expansive, immersive and hypnotic.\n\nWednesday | 10.25\n\nWhat: Addison Grace w/Madilyn Mei and Brye\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Non-binary singer-songwriter Addison Grace released their debut album Diving Lessons on September 29, 2023. Grace got a hold of a ukulele from their brother at 13 and seeing YouTubers use the instrument as a vehicle for songwriting and started making songs of their own and performed them at coffee shops while working various retail jobs. The early songs found an outlet on YouTube in 2017 and comprised bedroom cover songs that Grace took also to Instagram and TikTok. One of these performances in which Grace was wearing a Cavetown sweatshirt caught the attention of that band’s management. Through that connection Grace was signed to Warner’s Level Music and Grace got on a tour with popular indie pop artist Chloe Moriondo whose own bedroom compositions found a wide audience. The acoustic demo of “I Wanna Be a Boy” released in late 2020 went viral on YouTube. And yes TikTok has also been good for Grace’s career and reach as an artist. What makes Grace interesting and compelling, though, is none of these factoids but rather the songwriting itself. Yes, the vulnerable exploration of various aspects of identity that seem especially sensitive and thoughtful though rendered in vivid personal details that resonate beyond specific context. His new single “SLIME!” has a layered emotional impact with a joyous spirit but with a tinge of melancholic melody. Grace’s vocals are nuanced and expressive across a wide and complex spectrum of emotion which is the hallmark of any pop artist worth one’s attention.\n\nThursday | 10/26\n\nWhat: Stuck w/Forty Feet Tall and Dry Ice\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Stuck released its latest record Freak Frequency in May 2023 and treated the world to a set of eccentric, wiry and frantic art punk. The title says it all, really, and it captures an anxious desperation of the current era. The vocals border on hysteria while wandering among noisy, atonal sounds that warp and modulate and pulse with a sense of menace at times and in others the melodic calm of that time of life when you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop on a dire situation and there’s something thrilling about these emotional territories Stuck seems to traverse. For fans of Protomartyr, IDLES and Parquet Courts.\n\nFriday | 10.27\n\nWhat: Bison Bone album release w/The Patti Fiasco\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Bison Bone recently released its new EP 40 Grit. As the name suggests the stories across the EP’s five tracks are tales of everyday endurance and honing the rough edges of life to where it more suits your existence in the moment and to get through more trying patches. Its warm melodies and Courtney Whitehead’s introspective yet direct vocal style engages thetpo listener and the elegantly orchestrated music pulls you into an intimate and vividly observed moments the highlight moments that aren’t the stuff of striving and grinding and performative positivity of a lot of pop and rock music. But they are the stuff of real life that anchor your memories and stay with you for a lifetime. Whitehead seems skilled in putting together his own experiences in contexts that can resonate with people who recognize the psychological and emotional truth in a well crafted narrative enmeshed in music. Bison Bone formed in the mid-2010s after Whitehead moved to Denver from Oklahoma via Texas and found a community in which he could share his songwriting and find collaborators who got his creative vision and style of working class stories that didn’t glorify the lifestyle so much as highlight the inherent dignity of experiences most of us have and which translate well to the style of music Bison Bone offers which is to say Americana and at times a touch of psychedelia and country but informed by the humanistic psychological insights and poetry of Bruce Springsteen and Uncle Tupelo.\n\nFriday | 10.27\n\nWhat: Julian St. Nightmare, Hex Cassette, Team Nonexistent and Sell Farm\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Julian St. Nightmare is a post-punk band from Denver that has never been penned in by adherence to expected genre style. Rather its fusion of darkwave, surf rock, art rock and post-punk is a vehicle for its impassioned and emotionally immersive songwriting and richly imagined songwriting. Hex Cassette brings his industrial dance death cult act to this show to challenge the audience to let loose and have some fun because life is a shadow of itself if you’re not having fun at least some of the time and not taking absurd artistic expressions too seriously. Team Nonexistent is a band that seems to be drawing some inspiration from original grunge and modern punk and infusing it with a raw energy and earnest emotions. Sell Farm is a solo act informed by electronic industrial music and big beat and dub sound sculpting.\n\nFriday | 10.27\n\nWhat: Sorcha Richardson w/PAPA\n\nWhen: 6\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Sorcha Richardson is a Dublin-Ireland-based singer-songwriter whose soft and thoughtful pop songs blur the line between synth and indie pop with gently expressed introspective lyrics and a clear command of atmosphere and mood. In 2022 she released her latest album Smiling Like an Idiot and one has to applaud that level of self-deprecating awareness of one’s own shortcomings and charms. PAPA is Darren Weiss who took an extended break from the project after 2016 and spent some time as a session and touring drummer for people like Lana Del Rey, Albert Hammond Jr., Perfume Genius and Sky Ferreira. But he relaunched the band and released the new album Dig Yourself Or Dig A Hole on October 13, 2023. Recording with Devendra Banhart keyboard player Tyler Cash and violinist Daphne Chen, Weiss offers an album of pop music in a retro style and one that hints at the influence of people like Scott Walker and Bruce Springsteen or maybe more modern songwriters like Britt Daniels and Dan Boeckner. It’s an album that sounds like the current season when fall trickles toward winter and examining one’s regrets and sitting in one’s emotions and sorting them out with flares of the melodramatic in your heart.\n\nSaturday | 10.28\n\nWhat: Gilla Band w/Bambara\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: The Skylark Lounge\n\nWhy: Bambara has been slowly, because organically, building its reputation as one of the most original and compelling of post-punk bands in the current wave of that music. But the band began in 2001 in Athens, Georgia and released its earlier albums under the name 23jinx. At some point the group comprised of twin brothers Reid Bateh (lead vocals, guitar) and Blaze Bateh (drums) and William Brookshire (bass) changed their name to Bambara after a character in the animated series Æon Flux which many may remember from its broadcast on the Liquid Television segment of MTV. In 2018 Bambara got a big boost from Joe Talbot of IDLES declaring Shadow on Everything his favorite album of 2018 and the group was invited to open some dates on the IDLES tour of that year including a memorable performance at Larimer Lounge. There’s a dark, bluesy quality to the music reminiscent of Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds but more punk and perhaps looking back to Nick Cave’s previous band The Birthday Party. Bambara is reissuing its early albums Dreamviolence and Swarm on double vinyl expected out November 1, 2023. Also sharing this bill is Irish, experimental post-punk outfit Gilla Band. Formerly known as Girl Band, the group’s fusion of more rock songwriting with raw noise and the aesthetics of bombastic electronic big beat artists and No Wave disregard for how songs have to sound or be structured. All to thrilling effect.\n\nSunday | 10.29\n\nWhat: Bluphoria and Noah Vonne co-headlining w/The Disasters and Sunstoney\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Black Buzzard\n\nWhy: Bluphoria is a band now based in Nashville, Tennessee that originally formed in 2019 when lead singer and lead guitarist Reign LaFreniere moved to Eugene, Oregon to study film. LaFreniere grew up in the East Bay and South Bay in California loving horror shorts and went to an arts high school that allowed students to rent/borrow video equipment and production software. Raised in a musical family, LaFreniere didn’t really start playing music until high school in his sophomore year after getting a guitar. On a trip on the John Muir trail a friend only had Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and some Simon and Garfunkel songs on a player and being in a setting where music wasn’t as readily accessible for long stretches gave him a deeper appreciation of its importance listening to that music. When he returned from that hiking trip he got into Jimi Hendrix as someone who looked like him playing music of that caliber with Hendrix’s singing style an inspiration for LaFreniere’s fledgling attempts as a vocalist. But his focus was on film until he got to Eugene, Oregon when he met like-minded students like Dakota Landrum (rhythm guitarist, backing vocals) and Rex Wolf (bass).\n\nAt one of the band’s house shows an EDGEOUT Records intern was in attendance and signed the group to EDGEOUT/UME/UMG in January 2021 around the time when drummer Dani Janae joined the group. A year later Bluphoria drove to Tennessee to record their self-titled debut full length album which released on May 5, 2023. Even a casual listen to the songs and even the band’s 2020 debut EP Alone reveals a knack for entrancing melodic hooks in a power pop style mixed with touches of psychedelic rock and what might be described as soulful garage punk. With LaFreniere’s commanding vocals providing some of the grit and emotional resonance fans of The Replacements and The Plimsouls will find a lot to like about what Bluphoria has to offer.\n\nMonday | 10.30\n\nWhat: Allah-Lahs w/Sam Burton\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: The Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Allah-Las released their new album Zuma 85 on October 13, 2023 via their own imprint Calico Discos. When the group launched in 2008 it was an early adopter of a retro psychedelic pop and rock sound that a few years later would explode with surf rock and psych garage bands gaining an ascendancy in popular music. But Allah-Las had the benefit of actually crafting the songs more so than simply the style. Its roots in folk and left field pop as well as the aforementioned psychedelic bands like The Zombies, The Kinks and Love has resulted in a surprisingly consistent body of quality songwriting with a live show that preserves some of the inherent mystery of the milieu of its most obvious influences. The new record establishes a deep sense of space and time and with its rich use of field recordings has a subtly cinematic quality that conveys a continuity throughout the album like a experiences from an extended lucid dream.\n\nTuesday | 10.31\n\nWhat: Flooding w/Church Fire, Allison Lorenzen and Fainting Dreams\n\nWhen: 8\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Flooding is an experimental rock band from Kansas City, Missouri whose elemental noise rock seethes with the force of expelled outrage and trauma in bursts of jagged noise and movingly emotive vocals whether cast in cathartic screams or ethereal introspection. Its new album Silhouette Machine sounds like what a stark and detailed sketch of a bleak future in the eroded world of diminishing expectation that we see before us but one flickering with a scrappy and agonized hope in the seeming absence of it. Also on the bill is industrial dance revolutionaries Church Fire fresh from its tour and likely in fine performance shape, Allison Lorenzen’s tender, mystical, luminous ambient folk and the vulnerable and emotionally charged dream pop of Fainting Dreams.\n\nTuesday | 10.31\n\nWhat: Becca Mancari w/Bloomsday\n\nWhen: 7\n\nWhere: Lost Lake\n\nWhy: Becca Mancari’s 2023 album Left Hand propels their folk-rooted songwriting into new territory. Lead single “Over and Over” is a queer joy anthem featuring Julien Baker and at the heart of the song is an expansive quality that makes each song on the record feel like being able to stretch out and feel free after prolonged periods of feeling trapped by circumstance, culture and one’s surroundings. Because of that the album’s music feels like something that settles in your brain with a gentle touch that eases ambient anxieties.\n\nTo Be Continued…\n\nFriday | 06.03\n\nWhat: Scream Screen: Sisters w/Quits\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Sie Film Center\n\nWhy: Theresa Mercado is hosting her latest Scream Screen series this month with various bands opening the proceedings. Tonight it’s Brian De Palma’s 1972 psychological horror film Sisters starring future Lois Lane from the 1978 Superman movie. Opening are local noise rock legends Quits and their eruptive, cathartic and always riveting live show. Will be strange to see this in the front of the theater at Sie Film Center so that would be worth going to see alone.\n\nSaturday | 06.04\n\nWhat: Five Points Jazz Festival\n\nWhen: 12 p.m. – 12 a.m.\n\nWhere: Various Venues\n\nWhy: It’s free and you can catch a bevy of local and some non-local modern jazz greats like Buckner Funken Jazz, Denver Jazz Trio, Five Points Jazz Heritage Orchestra, Annie Booth Sextet, Ron Ivory and Suite ti and Las Luces featuring educator and local avant-garde jazz legend Joshua Trinidad.\n\nSaturday | 06.04\n\nWhat: Fear w/The Potato Pirates and Cease Fire https://www.gothictheatre.com/events/detail/417884\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: Rescheduled from NYE 2021. FEAR is the legendary Los Angeles punk band that helped define an entire lineage of that style of music. The group took great pleasure in taunting self-righteous punks and conservative American culture equally with its irreverently humorous, sometimes nihilistic, lyrics and outrageous performances with lead singer Lee Ving commanding the stage like an insult comedian. The band was featured in Penelope Spheeris’ classic 1981 punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization as well as the infamous 1981 Halloween episode of Saturday Night Live arranged by show writer Michael O’Donoghue and former SNL star and then cinema luminary John Belushi. On the show the band performed and the audience included members of Minor Threat, Cro-mags, The Meatmen and Negative Approach and mayhem ensued including profanity broadcast before the live feed was cut. So plenty of anticipation was in place when The Record came out on Slash in 1982 and it delivered some of the most caustic and boisterous punk in an era not short on such offerings. Since that time FEAR has released a handful of records, the final being 2000’s American Beer, and occasionally toured and still worth showing up to see. But with Ving having turned 72 in 2022 this may be one of your last chances, if not your last chance, to catch these heroes of punk before Ving calls it a day.\n\nSunday | 06.05\n\nWhat: Tomberlin w/Jana Horn\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Tomberlin’s new record, her second, i don’t know who needs to hear this… (2022) is like an atmospheric jazz pop record with her vocals at the center and a truly imaginative soundscape ghosting into the background to haunt the spare beat and minimal instrumentation. If the songwriter’s sound and style can be lumped into the broadly clumsy umbrella of folk it’s more in the vein of artists who made liberal use of field recordings but in this case it’s more like taking an interest in a sound and a sample like one might if one were a hip-hop or electronic music artist looking to give a beat some character and unconventional emotional resonance. Tomberlin’s vocals are of course the usual strong but gentle flavor one would hope for but she always seems to find a way to use it guide he mood while syncing with the rhythm in ways that keep the vibe fresh and evocative.\n\nTuesday | 06.07\n\nWhat: Blackwater Holylight w/Spirit Mother and Keefduster\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Much in a similar way that SubRosa brought a tribal, deeply atmospheric, psychedelic sensibility to heavy music, Blackwater Holylight takes some of the grit and heft of doom but lightens in with broad atmospheric and moody vistas of sound. Its 2021 album Silence/Motion includes a nice element of the electronic so that it sounds like it could and should be a soundtrack to the next Panos Cosmatos film. But there’s nothing kitsch about Blackwater Holylight. Denver’s Keef Duster will bring its own flavor of psychedelic doom/space rock to open the show with former Dirty Few singer Kim Phat bringing some entrancing melodies into the mix.\n\nWednesday | 06.08\n\nWhat: Failure w/sneak peek at Failure documentary\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Failure got started in the early era of what came to be called alternative rock having founded in 1990 in Los Angeles right before the glam metal that seemed ubiquitously popular tanked in the next two years once early alternative rock bands like Jane’s Addiction helped to popularize music that had been in the underground with its successful Lollapalooza tour subverted the record industry. Failure enjoyed some of the fallout of that time but its own music didn’t exactly fit in with trendy styles and sounds. It had a hard rock edge, an art rock ambition in the songwriting and atmospheric sensibilities that some might have associated with shoegaze or space rock but very much its own flavor. Its mid-90s albums Magnified (1994) and Fantastic Planet (1996) showed how you could meld heavy, monolithic, deeply dynamic sounds with blissful melodies in a way that had a cinematic quality that the band members would bring to the more sound design approach to composition it would perfect when it reunited in 2013 after a six year hiatus. Since that reconvening it might be argued that Failure has been releasing the best music of its career with its sublimely dark dissonance and nuanced emotional palette including its 2021 album Wild Type Droid. For this show you will get a preview of the forthcoming documentary about the band due out in 2023 featuring interviews with the broad array of artists (not all musical) who have been impacted by Failure’s particular brand of sonic magic.\n\nThursday | 06.09\n\nWhat: Insane Angel, Grunkster, Sell Farm, French Kettle Station\n\nWhen: 9 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Insane Angel is an unusual amalgam of jazz, indie pop and folk and includes members of Horn Horse and Palberta. Grunkster is kind of like a lo-fi IDM/glitch pop project. Sell Farm is hard to quantify easily but has been part indiepop, part dub, part cavernous industrial in the Godflesh vein minus the metallic aspects. French Kettle Station is an eclectic artist whose output runs a broad range of ideas and aesthetics though one might hear in his work aspects of New Age pop, glitchcore, ambient, post-rock and croony classic pop and always an energetic, commanding performance.\n\nThursday | 06.09\n\nWhat: Black Angels w/Dion Lunadon\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Before being thoroughly associated with modern psychedelic rock and even long after, The Black Angels from Austin, TX were early adopters of blurring all lines between early psychedelic rock, Krautrock, shoegaze, freak folk and noise rock. And to this day its body of work endures because they have always been one of the best practitioners of modern psych including advocating for other artists with its formerly annual (currently on hiatus) Austin Psych Fest, one of the most astutely curated festivals of the modern era. Dion Lunadon spent a decade playing in and writing songs with A Place to Bury Strangers but is releasing his first solo album since leaving APTBS in 2020 with Beyond Everything due out June 10, 2022 on In the Red Records. Early singles promise a driving, noisy psychedelic rock album with the dynamic flourishes that Lunadon brought so masterfully to APTBS and The D4.\n\nFriday | 06.10\n\nWhat: Hex Casette album release, Church Fire, eHpH and Pink Lady Monster\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Jester’s Palace\n\nWhy: For a handful of years Hex Cassette has been crafting and refining his style of confrontational industrial dance pop music and in the past year or two he started to become known in the underground for highly energetic performances informed by a darkly playful sense of humor. For this show he’s releasing his new album Pomegranate Death, a collection of songs that fans of M83 and TR/ST will appreciate for the immersive melodies and underlying hopeful mood even as many of the songs are about death and overcoming personal challenges to embrace a vital life. And sure Hex Cassette is one of the most exciting of the newer projects in the Denver underground but for this album release/tour kick off show, Hex Cassette has invited spirited and political industrial dance, synth pop heroes Church Fire whose own shows are cathartic and deeply emotional without skimping on the enthusiasm and energy to balance out the sense of despair and melancholic mood that is part of some of its material honoring loss and recognizing elements of our culture hostile to the the very existence and dignity of people that don’t fit into a very conservative view of mainstream society. There is also eHpH, the EBM/industrial band whose own music takes aim at fascism and authoritarian impulses in American culture and whose evocative soundscapes and irresistible rhythms have made it a staple in local darkwave circles for several years. Former Corda Vera front person Simone Fohrman has been at her solo project Pink Lady Monster since 2020 with its blend of dream pop and indie rock with an experimental flourish in the production and signal processing.\n\nFriday | 06.10\n\nWhat: Ambar Lucid w/Miki Ratsula\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Ambar Lucid taught herself to play piano, guitar and ukulele and took in YouTube videos to work on her vocal technique. And her output of music since 2019 reflects that generation of pop artists that isn’t defined by narrow conventions of the art form. In her sound and production you hear the R&B influence, her Latin music roots, the influence of hyper pop and perhaps forward thinking artists like Charli XCX. It’s a pure fusion of styles and aesthetics she has made her own as evidenced by her 2020 album Garden of Lucid and her new single “girl ur so pretty.” Lucid’s own life sounds like something from a movie as her father was deported to Mexico when she was 8 years old and she didn’t see him or her sister until ten years later. Which speaks to issues of immigration and how the laws surrounding that have a direct impact on people and their families and the intimate knowledge of which is part of why the songwriter has been such an active advocate for immigrants’ rights. Sharing the bill with Lucid is non-binary pop songwriter Miki Ratsula whose R&B infused songs with colorful and evocative music videos are in themselves an act of resistance to prejudice in being so appealing and imaginative in making everyday life for a non-binary person seem like what it is—normal and not short on joy and fulfillment in ways that are accessible to anyone. Miki’s March 2022 debut album i owe it to myself is filled with ample examples of the aforementioned.\n\nFriday | 06.10\n\nWhat: Scream Screen: Madhouse w/Weathered Statues\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Sie Film Center\n\nWhy: This edition of Scream Screen will give you a chance to see in a theater Ovidio G. Assonitis’ 1981 slasher Madhouse in which one sister is stalked by her psychotic twin. The film was included on the “video nasty” list in its day and banned in the 1980s in the UK. Opening will be local post-punk/Xmal Deutschland-esque band Weathered Statues.\n\nSaturday | 06/11\n\nWhat: Sunflower Bean w/Liily\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: When Sunflower Bean started garnering a national audience after the release of its debut album Human Ceremony in 2016 it seemed as though the band’s fusion of post-punk and shoegaze aimed it in a particular musical direction but since then up to and including its 2022 album Headful of Sugar the trio has embraced its knack for pop songcraft and hooks. The new record showcases a band able to write coolly sultry R&B-inflected songs that fit in with its own history of lushly atmospheric songs that can be not just melancholically evocative but subtly cathartic. If one were into overblown comparisons for the song “Who Put You Up To This?” it’s like hearing Cocteau Twins after they sequestered themselves in a studio and only listened to Delfonics and Marvin Gaye for a few months before writing their next record.\n\nSaturday | 06.11\n\nWhat: Big Head Todd and the Monsters w/Violent Femmes\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Todd Park Mohr is bar none the most prominent Colorado musician of Asian ancestry and his band Big Head Todd and The Monsters have been crafting a respectable body of work that blends rock, folk, alternative rock and jazz with an ear for improvisational flourishes. Starting in Boulder in 1984 the group really pulled together a solid set of songs for its 1990 second album Midnight Radio. Reworking its best song “Bittersweet” for its 1993 release Sister Sweetly the group hit upon a formula that took it from prominent local band to platinum selling act whose music was prominent on radio for the rest of the decade. And since the 90s Big Head Todd has been releasing worthwhile albums if you’re into blues rock bordering on jam band folk rock. Opening the show is long time college rock cult band Violent Femmes whose music became a staple of alternative radio since the early 80s with its 1983 self-titled debut with every track more or less a classic of a world of music upon which alternative rock in the 1990s was built. Beyond the eccentric and brilliant songwriting part punk, part folk and part outsider music Violent Femmes have long been one of the great live bands of, yes, American music and would be worth going to see for this show alone but you get to see two greats of the alternative era.\n\nSaturday | 06.11\n\nWhat: Still Corners w/Foxes in Fiction\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: UK dream pop band Still Corners create warmly contemplative songs with a dusky soulfulness that has translated well from its early very ethereal, shoegaze-y material to its more countrified 2021 album The Last Exit and its imagery of open vistas in the American west. Not quite in the realm of Chromatics in its evocation of Lynchian noir but like something inspired by a romantic version of a Jonathan Demme slice of working class Americana.\n\nSaturday and Sunday | 06.11 and 06.12\n\nWhat: Purity Ring w/EKKSTACY\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom and Boulder Theater\n\nWhy: Purity Ring’s production style established firmly on its 2012 debut album Shrines has proven incredibly influential on modern electronic pop and hip-hop. Its own amalgamation of dream pop, hip-hop and witch house is otherworldly and transporting and in its music you can hear the future of forms of electronic music like hyper pop and glitchcore because Purity Ring has already been there and moved on to other realms of soundscaping and the crafting of emotionally resonant sounds, textures and dynamics. Having worked with Danny Brown and Katy Perry, the duo’s stylistic flexibility has resulted in albums brimming concepts and sound design elements rendered as coherent songs that are sure to be tapped for years to come. Its live show is more theatrical and unusual that one might expect as the group uses devices to control sound and lighting that it had to make itself so the presentation is always compellingly unconventional.\n\nSunday | 06.12\n\nWhat: Everclear w/Fastball and The Nixons\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Before singles from the 1995 Everclear album Sparkle and Fade made the band stars of later era alterative rock singer and primary songwriter Art Alexakis had already been through the ups and downs of being a musician, drug addiction and parenthood and was in his mid-30s to late 30s when his band took off, breaking many stereotypes of musical success. Songs like “Santa Monica,” “Father of Mine” and “Everything to Everyone” were all but ubiquitous on Top 40 radio and stations with alternative rock heavy playlists. But inside all of those songs were nuggets of wisdom and a raw honesty that was suffused in the band’s live performances. By the turn of the century Everclear didn’t enjoy the commercial popularity it once had and key members of the band had departed by 2003 but Alexakis has continued on doing what he does best: write meaningful songs that shed light on the human condition with wit, humor and compassion. One record that has gone by the wayside was the group’s fantastic 1993 debut album World of Noise which is being reissued in 2022 and for the first time on vinyl in the fall. People who only know the band from its hits may be surprised with how raw and vital it is like something you might expect from an early grunge or punk band of that time but also with Alexakis’ gift for an ear worm hook. Celebrating the re-issue of the record Everclear is touring with other late alternative rock bands Fastball and The Nixons for a billing of bands who experienced their greatest success in the 90s but who remain potent live acts.\n\nSunday | 06.12\n\nWhat: Dragon Drop, Cau5er, sororityboy, Juniordeer and sintax\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: If you were to pick one show to go see some of the best and most imaginative underground electronic artists from Denver in the vein of hyper pop, industrial noise and glitch pop this would be the show to go see.\n\nTuesday | 06.14\n\nWhat: Compactor, Sleeping With The Earth, No More Cheering, Cremedelacrvp, Tolerant\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Okay, this would be the other show to go see some electronic acts that take soundscaping to another level except this bill includes New York industrial noise legends Compactor, Portland, Oregon-based ambient noisenik Sleeping With The Earth and harsh noise/power electronics artist Cremedelacrvp.\n\nWednesday | 06.15\n\nWhat: These Arms Are Snakes w/Git Some\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: These Arms Are Snakes is a post-hardcore band that gets lumped in with the genres of metalcore and mathcore and there is some validity to that. But a lot of its music is closer to noise rock and the new compilation of its early demos and non-album tracks and other odds and ends Duct Tape & Shivering Crows (which came out on April 15, 2022 on Suicide Squeeze Records) bears out how this band could elude easy categorization. It includes former members of 90s metalcore pioneers Botch and experimental rock band Kill Sadie. The band’s wiry, sonic savagery had a kind of brutal fluidity to it that seemed to have come out of that era of post-hardcore that included synthesizers to give its music more than the bare bones rock band level of impact with atmospherics that felt as dreamlike as it did visceral. Opening the show are like-minded Denver noise rock legends Git Some who never broke up but rarely play live and itself includes former members of Planes Mistaken For Stars and Luke Fairchild from Quits. So this show will definitely get a little off the hook with the energy and intensity.\n\nWednesday | 06.15\n\nWhat: Whores w/Bummer and Capra\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Atlanta’s Whores sound like a glorious, mutant hybrid of Unsane and Big Black. But if you’re into KARP or Helmet’s more free moments you’ll appreciate the band’s spirited onslaught. Bummer from Kansas City released its latest album Dead Horse (as in beating a—clear proof of the group’s dark sense of humor including about itself because someone probably told them they sound like they’re doing that after all these years making music like this) in 2021. It shares obvious influences from the likes of KARP and the Amphetamine Reptile roster of bands like Cherubs and The Jesus Lizard. But its sound is very different from the style of Whores with more spiraling guitar riffs and open harmonic flourishes. They have a song on Dead Horse called “I Want to Punch Bruce Springsteen in the Dick” and even if you’re a fan of the Boss the song title is irreverently puerile for a song that’s a psychedelic noise scorcher with undeniable appeal. Capra from Lafayette, LA fills out this line-up with its own pointed and noisy metalcore with incredible momentum and a brutal grace.\n\nWednesday | 06.15\n\nWhat: Hovvdy w/Mini Trees\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Globe Hall\n\nWhy: Austin-based band Hovvdy released its most recent album True Love in 2021 and like many other artists are finally able to take that music on the road. The hushed vocal harmonies paired with lush and richly layered instrumental arrangements are part of the duo’s core sound but this time around the tender and intimate sound hits with a little more of the gentle warmth that characterized its earlier work and its songs of heartbreak and hope seem imbued with a spirit of thoughtful introspection that offers a perspective beyond hokey pronouncements that everything is going to be okay. Rather, the hard times and misfortune that seems to have visited the entire world and rushed into everyone’s lives require a much more nuanced take and response on even the minutiae of life and Hovvdy brings the type of nurturing energy to this batch of songs that would benefit many people to hear.\n\nThursday | 06.16\n\nWhat: Bestial Mouths w/Lowfaith and Turismo Blu\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fritzy’s\n\nWhy: It’s difficult to limit Bestial Mouths to a narrow genre of music as vocalist/producer Lynette Cerezo has been experimenting with what the project is and how it should sound since its inception in 2009. While one hears across that span of time and multiple releases a foot in industrial, post-punk, noise, transcendental metal and other presumed influences like Diamanda Galas whose own music is a pure fusion of noise, No Wave, classical and blues there is an element of performance art as a vehicle for expressing concepts and ideas that unifies what Bestial Mouths has been about. At this point Bestial Mouths is a solo project of Cerezo’s and the albums INSHROUDSS and RESURRECTEDINBLACK might be considered a kind of darkwave dance music with an aspect of ritual drone. Cerezo is a prolific collaborator who has worked with the likes of Boy Harsher, Zola Jesus, Mick Harvey and Mater Suspiria Vision and out of that her impact on modern, underground music in the realm of post-punk is indisputable. Seems as though Bestial Mouths hasn’t played in Denver since a performance at now long defunct DIY space Mouth House in 2013 so this is a rare chance to see the now Berlin-based artist up close and personal along with Denver-based post-punk band Lowfaith and acid house artist Turismo Blu.\n\nThursday | 06.16\n\nWhat: Bob Log III w/Bolonium and Legs\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Bob Log III was once a member of mutant blues rock duo Doo Rag and was doing that sort of Mississippi Delta blues mixed with punk thing before a lot of people got around to that by the mid-to-late 90s. By the end of the 90s Bob had gone on his own with his current moniker as a solo act with his The Road Warrior meets Troma sartorial aesthetic and somehow makes his music seem futuristic even as it embraces old time blues with no irony. Bolonium is a Denver band whose own stylistic link to Troma should seem obvious as its antics have included a live game show during its set but its music is somewhere betwixt an even more cartoon-y Devo and They Might Be Giants and with all the kitsch of a very self-aware but never giving up the joke Adult Swim show skit as band.\n\nFriday | 06/17\n\nWhat: Scream Screen: The Mafu Cage w/Shocker Mom\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Sie Film Center\n\nWhy: This edition of Scream Screen features Karen Arthur’s 1978 psychodrama The Mafu Cage. The titular creatures, the “mafus,” are the pet monkeys one of the mentally unbalanced Cissy played by Carol Kane whose sister Ellen (Lee Grant) is an astronomer. There is some demented dynamic between the two sisters who share a mansion in Los Angeles but for the exact plot it’s perhaps best viewed rather than read about in summary. The musical guest is Shocker Mom whose brilliant blend of soulful R&B, ambient music and IDM isn’t something you get to see often enough. Robin Walker aka Shocker Mom is also one half of experimental hip-hop duo Nighttimeschoolbus.\n\nSaturday | 06.18\n\nWhat: Jerry Paper w/Bobby Amulet and Sell Farm\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Jerry Paper is one of the more imaginative hip-hop producers/artists to have emerged out of the 2000s. Their records, especially those for respected and forward thinking label Stones Throw, always seem to have some unusual and creative approach to songwriting and sound sculpting so that even when their beats wax into cosmic yacht rock territory they don’t skimp on the forays into weird realms of sound. Their latest record is the psychedelic and chill Free Time. Bobby Amulet from Denver is the musical moniker of Connor Spell whose own affection for lush, adult-contemporary-esque disco sounds are a good fit on a bill with Jerry Paper. Sell Farm? You don’t really know what you’re going to get except that it’ll be interesting whether it’s the more dub flavoring in the indiepop realm or epic soundscapes or whatever it is the group will be up to this time around.\n\nSunday | 06.19\n\nWhat: Blitzen Trapper w/Laney Jones\n\nWhen: 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Levitt Pavillion\n\nWhy: Blitzen Trapper is one of the bands that really introduced the easy listening 70s adult contemporary vibe back into indie folk in a big way. But they’ve managed to evolve a great deal as a band and refine their sound from early alt-country roots into a finely honed blend of 70s laid back rock, folk and jazz. Opening Laney Jones’ new album Stories Up High has more personal psychological insight than many things you’ll hear this year. Her voice is warm, strong and vulnerable with her signature, subtle vibrato. And that coupled with orchestral musical arrangements and expansive and deeply textured guitar work makes every track linger in your heart with a rich emotional resonance.\n\nSunday | 06.19\n\nWhat: ABANDONS, New Standards Men and Shauna Corinne Murray\n\nWhere: Seventh Circle Music Collective\n\nWhy: ABANDONS from Denver might be described as post-metal or post-rock but its creative ambitions are wider than that. They mix samples and vocals in with their linger and slow burning atmospherics particularly on “Coffee Highway.” But songs like “Ghost Ranch” and “Cotopaxi” the spiraling riffs and feedback sculpting wax unconventionally psychedelic. In that way they are regularly a good fit on a bill with New Standards Men whose own hybrid of psychedelia, noise rock and Krautrock through a classic art rock lens is never fully predictable in a way that is consistently refreshing. Shauna Corinne Murray used to be based in Portland, Oregon but now hails from Albuquerque but her singer-songwriter compositions on piano are informed by a touch of the avant-garde.\n\nMonday | 06.20\n\nWhat: Lo Moon w/Social Animals\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: When Lo Moon emerged with a public presence in 2016 it seemed to have its aesthetic, sound, production and media engagement strategy fully formed while maintaining a bit of mystique about its origins. Like it had been around for years writing that music and resisting the normal urge to put it out into the world in an era when it would have been easy to do so. That approach apparently worked for the Los Angeles quarter because its 2018 self-titled album came out on major label Columbia. Its blend of dream pop and rock shaped by an ear for production and the role of a strong live mix in creating powerfully evocative moods garnered the band an opening slot for the 2017 leg of Ride’s reunion tour before having an album out. In 2022 the group finally released its sophomore album A Modern Life even after Columbia dropped the band during the latter part of its recording process. The album builds on the virtues of its earlier material while taking a different direction in the songwriting emphasizing more the lush R&B side of its sonic palette and more akin to contemporaries like Private World and seeming stylistic nods to Tears For Fears.\n\nWhat: Empath w/Supreme Joy\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Larimer Lounge\n\nWhy: Empath has evolved various sounds during the course of its existence and its 2022 album Visitor is its most experimental offering yet. If the band can still be called punk based on impressions of its earlier albums at this point Empath has embraced a synth-infused dream pop approach that fans of early Japanese Breakfast might appreciate. But songs like “Born 100 Times” has more than a bit of the energetic, noisy weirdness that points most directly to its more punk origins. But really this band’s music has always resisted easy categorization after the manner of many bands from Philadelphia where no matter the genre tag might be placed on its sound it doesn’t quite fit and in the case of Empath the world of music is just that much more interesting.\n\nTuesday | 06.21\n\nWhat: Weval\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Meow Wolf\n\nWhy: Dutch production duo Weval has been assembling some of the most imaginative electronic dance music around since 2013. Its use of vibrant analog synth tones in its tracks and meditative yet irresistible rhythms builds with layers of colorful melodies that hit with a soothing physicality. Its 2021 EP Changed for the Better and 2022 four-song release Time Goes reveal Weval’s ability to go beyond its early production style into something that evokes a sense of exploration and wonder with songs that have a fresh quality in where Weval tie texture to atmosphere in a dynamic flow that engrossingly dreamlike.\n\nWednesday | 06.22\n\nWhat: Modern English\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Soiled Dove Underground\n\nWhy: Modern English is obviously most known for its 1982 hit single “I Melt With You.” Likely lumped in with the “New Wave” of the time the undeniably catchy yet meaningful song with its cool vocal dynamics was really only a sample of where the group came from. Based out of Colchester in the east of the UK Modern English came up at a time when its early, brooding, post-punk songs fit right in with the likes of contemporaries like Magazine, Joy Division and The Sound. Its 1981 debut album Mesh & Lace is much darker and more experimental than 1982’s After the Snow but both albums represent Modern English’s ability to navigate a variety of moods without being stuck in a particular mode of expression so that it could embrace when the mind waxes to melancholia as well as times of joyful celebration of connection. After some mishaps the rest of the 80s with record labels and not quite being able to match the commercial success of its most famous single the band split by 1991. Upon convening in the mid-90s Modern English didn’t seem too prolific in the releasing of songs or albums its 2016 comeback record Take Me to the Trees bridges the breadth of its songwriting styles and flavors well with songs worthy of its first two records and as a live band the quintet still brings that passion and emotional nuance to its performances that struck a chord with audiences early on its career.\n\nWednesday | 06.22\n\nWhat: Lesser Care w/don’t get lemon, Natural Violence\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Lesser Care from El Paso, Texas is one of the closest bands we’ll see to a pure shoegaze and post-punk hybrid in the vein of The Chameleons and Kitchens of Distinction. Though its exquisitely ethereal melodies are the stuff of daydream bliss the trio performs with an energetic intensity one might more expect from a group that came out of punk. Its 2022 album Underneath, Beside Me gets released on vinyl in July. don’t get lemon from Austin comes from a similar sonic perspective but more electronic in its establishing of mood with a production style that is right out of lo-fi darkwave but with uplifting vocals that sit in the urgent dynamic of its flow of sounds not unlike a more dream pop early Depeche Mode. Natural Violence might be more techno-infused post-punk noise with a strong performance art element or maybe former School Knights and current American Culture guitarist Michael Stein will be exploring a new vista of sound for his imaginative songwriting.\n\nWednesday | 06.22\n\nWhat: Windhand w/Un https://www.bluebirdtheater.net/events/detail/426122\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Bluebird Theater\n\nWhy: Richmond, Virginia’s Windhand has been crafting cosmic, psychedelic doom since its 2008 inception. Its most recent album Eternal Return (2018) is a fuzz-laden journey into mythological constructs of emotional and psychological spaces. Its hypnotic rhythms and Dorthia Cottrell’s powerful and sultry vocals are reminiscent of some of Kylesa’s more meditative yet moments. Seattle’s Un is more in the realm of heavy, contemplative post-rock with an knack for evoking the otherworldly with a processional elegance paired with a feral sensibility once the songs take flight.\n\nWednesday | 06.22\n\nWhat: 5 Seconds of Summer w/Pale Waves\n\nWhen: 5:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Fillmore Auditorium\n\nWhy: 5 Seconds of Summer is a pretty standard mainstream pop act and one of the biggest people who normally read previews for this site may not know about. But it’s songwriting is strong enough and its musicianship accomplished enough there’s no need to be embarrassed by being into its pop hooks. Sure they got their start as YouTube stars and got a bump up into an international audience touring with One Direction but also managed to parlay these breaks into a large international fandom on the merits of its own creative work. But a major reason to go to this show as well is opening act Pale Waves. Underneath the effervescent energy and infectious melodies are lyrics that directly and sensitively deal with issues of anxiety, depression and class. Its 2018 debut EP All the Things I Never Said delivered on the promise of early singles like “Television Romance” and “There’s a Honey.” Employing a palette of wonderfully melodramatic pop punk and straight ahead pop, Pale Waves delivers music that is immediately and thrillingly accessible for anyone not looking to be alienated by catchy music but with deftly crafted, meaningful content. Its forthcoming album Unwanted releases on August 12, 2022.\n\nFriday | 06.24\n\nWhat: Scream Screen: Ginger Snaps w/Dead Boyfriend\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Sie Film Center\n\nWhy: This iteration of June’s Scream Screen will be a showing of Ginger Snaps (2000) directed by John Fawcett. It’s about a pair of sisters one of whom, the titular Ginger, becomes a werewolf and goes on a bit of a killing rampage that comes to a head by the end of the film. No spoilers. The musical act opening the proceedings is Dead Boyfriend whose recorded output suggests a lo-fi indie/bedroom pop aesthetic with delicately raw emotional sensibilities that fans of early Joanna Newsom or Dear Nora might appreciate.\n\nSaturday | 06.25\n\nWhat: True Brewing Bacchanal: Khemmis, Panopticon, Hulder, Vastum and Dreadnought\n\nWhen: 6 p.m.\n\nWhere: Gothic Theatre\n\nWhy: True Brewing is the metal themed brewery on Broadway in Denver and this mini-festival features some of the better local and not so local metal bands running. Khemmis’ psychedelic doom has struck a chord with audiences far beyond Denver with its intricate melodies and songwriting chops. Dreadnought puts a different flavor into the mix of doom with keyboards adding a layer of dynamic atmosphere and a touch of classical sensibility. Hulder is a Belgian/American solo black metal project based out of Portland. Her latest album offers her signature flood of crushing riffs and Cascadian atmospherics but also a touch of the more ambient side of the songwriting. The hovering riffs over propulsive drumming from its new album The Eternal Fanfare is something we have come to expect from a solo black metal act but the songwriter sounds like a being from myth declaring tales of a perilous future but not one without its share of glory and adventure.\n\nSaturday | 06.25\n\nWhat: Goo Age, Hippies Wearing Muzzles, Sleepdial and Lowern\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Glob\n\nWhy: Goo Age is Garrett Williamson and Adrian Wright who craft New Age music seemingly with analog synths and sequencers for a sound like an 80s video game about going on vacation and having playful adventures in a mostly benevolent landscape. It’s like Art of Noise or Anne Dudley solo but scoring the aforementioned video game that doesn’t involve killing other creatures or exploiting the environment but, rather, creative achievements and those more down to earth and not dire. Hippies Wearing Muzzles is the analog synth project of Lee Evans, bassist of slop pop band Kissing Party. Sleepdial is one of the projects of Luke Thinnes aka French Kettle Station but in the past Sleepdial has been his guitar driven ambient music though these days who can say exactly what you’ll see.\n\nSaturday | 06.25\n\nWhat: Kamasi Washington\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Ogden Theatre\n\nWhy: Kamasi Washington is the rare modern jazz leader whose work as a saxophonist in conjunction with other artists and collaborators and his work as a sideman is so powerfully expressive he can uplift and break your heart without having to utter a word, such is the mastery of his musicianship as guided by a superior creative imagination with his craft. He hasn’t put out an album since the epochal Heaven and Earth in 2018 though he has done music with Dinner Party which features other jazz greats Robert Glasper, Terrace Martin and 9th Wonder. In the live setting where he can improv and push his compositions beyond their usual bounds is where Washington shins brightest.\n\nTuesday and Wednesday | 06.28 and 06.29\n\nWhat: Fleet Foxes w/Tim Bernardes\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom and Vilar Performing Arts Center (Beaver Creek)\n\nWhy: Fleet Foxes are one of the best and most creative bands out of the indie folk milieu of the 2000s. Before going on hiatus in 2013 after the departure of longtime member Josh Tillman aka Father John Misty, Fleet Foxes were something of an indie rock supergroup with more than one gifted songwriter in the band. But since reconvening in 2016 the band has pushed its sound in interesting directions and perhaps most distinctively with its 2020 album Shore and its evocatively delicate and sensitive compositions informed by a taking stock of life and sussing out what feels like needs to be said and despite orchestral soundscapes has a refreshing simplicity.\n\nThursday | 06.30\n\nWhat: Kraftwerk 3-D\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Rocks\n\nWhy: Kraftwerk has to be considered among the most influential bands of the past five decades and more as pioneers of putting synthesizers into music equal parts visionary pop, art rock and the avant-garde. Every synth pop band or derivations thereof are all descended from Kraftwerk’s unique and idiosyncratic songwriting and soundcraft. Every techno artist and DJ culture practitioner owes a great deal to Kraftwerk’s experiments in sound. Its early recordings included more than a few not purely electronic instruments but as the band evolved through the 70s and the 80s it ditched even acoustic percussion in favor of the electronic equivalent even if it didn’t dispense with the physicality of its sound both futuristic and minimal and immediately accessible even its stranger moments. For this tour you will get to see its 3-D presentation at Red Rocks with 3-D projections that anyone who has seen these shows can tell you add an experiential dimension to the music that listening to it at home can’t fully replicate with Kraftwerk itself delivering a powerful performance even without “rocking out” as its members finely control its orchestrated flow of deeply evocative sounds. The 2020 tour had to be canceled because of the early stage of the pandemic and this revamping of the presentation from previous 3-D tours from Kraftwerk will prove that the band doesn’t really rest on false laurels.\n\nWednesday | 03.09\n\nWhat: Monolord w/Firebreather and The Munsens\n\nWhen: 7 p.m.\n\nWhere: Marquis Theater\n\nWhy: Monolord formed in 2013 at a time when the whole wave of stoner rock was pretty much over and before doom metal hits its ascendency later in that decade. Its members had been part of a more boogie rock oriented band Marulk but at rehearsal had riffed in more drawn out dynamics and sustained atmospherics while incorporating those impulses into coherent songwriting. So its current sound while rooted in what is now called doom metal contains melodic elements lend its crushing rhythmic leads an accessibility that sounds more like an updated version of power metal. The group’s 2021 album Your Time to Shine is arguably its most streamlined manifestation of an aesthetic that draws on the psychedelic heaviness of Sleep and Kylesa and infuses it with its own impulse to impart a mood of catharsis and triumph to its listeners.\n\nFriday | 03.11\n\nWhat: Owosso, Moon Pussy, Church Van and Gestapo Pussy Ranch\n\nWhen: 9 p.m. doors, 9:30 p.m. show\n\nWhere: Lion’s Lair\n\nWhy: Moon Pussy’s scorched earth noise rock and underpinnings in musical experimentation can be disorienting in the best way. Like Big Black with creatively expressive human drums instead of a drum machine. This will be Owosso’s first show. The group is comprised of veterans of the local punk/post-hardcore and indie rock scenes including people from Modern Goon. The group was been described as “post indie wook rock” but it’s hopefully safe to assume it’s not some ironic jam band with punk roots. Though if it is it’ll probably be alright anyway considering the band’s lineage.\n\nSaturday | 03.12\n\nWhat: Mitski w/Michelle\n\nWhen: 8 p.m.\n\nWhere: Mission Ballroom\n\nWhy: Mitski released her latest album Laurel Hell in 2022 and it is arguably her most vulnerable and raw album while also her most poignantly melancholic. Few other artists have articulated the disillusionment of the current era and the perils of an over mediated culture with as much precision and resonance as Mitski over the course of her two most recent records. As a live performer Mitski always has something different in her repertoire like on her most recent tour in 2019 when she had stage sets and a costume that looked like somewhere between a workout suit and a martial arts dancer uniform.\n\nSaturday | 03.12\n\nWhat: Jen Korte & The Loss, Mike Clark & The Sugar Sounds and Heated Bones\n\nWhere: Hi-Dive\n\nWhy: Jen Korte & The Loss this time out is basically her excellent experimental singer-songwriter project Lady Gang but with a full band instead of pulling off the full range of sounds herself. But it’ll still be Korte deep diving into emotionally rich explorations of hurt, resilience and the complex nuances of human experiences and relationships. Korte’s imaginative musicianship and songwriting elevates her work beyond the usual expectations one might have when one thinks of singer-songwriter. Her body of work is eclectic and runs a range of Americana, indie rock, folk and what might be described as experimental pop with loops and electronics. Many artists reach a point where they rest on their laurels and Korte hasn’t done so.\n\nSaturday | 03.12\n\nWhat: Mayhem w/Watain and Midnight\n\nWhere: Summit Music Hall\n\nWhy: Mayhem is indeed the legendary black metal band from Norway whose lore and history is worth looking into for the lurid details alone. It makes for a fascinating origin story. But the music and its harrowing and heavy sweeps of epic storytelling speaks for itself as does the unforgettable stage presence of frontman Attila Csihar who always brings a deep sense of theater and performance art to every one of his performances whether with Mayhem or SunnO))). The show will be worth it to see what he does alone and that chilling, sepulchral, operatic voice.\n\nSunday | 03.13\n\nW"
