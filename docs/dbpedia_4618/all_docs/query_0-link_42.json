However, a curious spotlight was once again pointed on the band early in 2014. When a Twitter account was found that happened be followed by the members of the group. It turned out to be a reunion tour underway, and the music world online exploded with anticipation. We are thrilled that Rachel Goswell came to chat with us on the podcast.\n\nOn using Twitter and reuniting in 2014\n\nWhat values they want to be represented in their legacy\n\nDiscussing future album possibilities. A Slowdive EDM or thrash metal record anyone?\n\ntalking about touring major festivals at loving Primavera Festival\n\nHow working with Brian Eno changed their writing process\n\nDealing with the term “shoegaze” and British press.\n\nSeeing success with the North American tour. And having their last show pre-hiatus at Lee’s Palace in Toronto in 1994."
