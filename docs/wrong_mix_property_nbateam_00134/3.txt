NBA stars on the court and in the front office typically take this time in the offseason to pursue and involve themselves with other interests outside of basketball. The Utah Jazz CEO Danny Ainge is no different, considering his decision to hit the golf course with former Jazz All-NBA point guard Deron Williams.

He took to his X account to give some applause to the six-year Jazz veteran after a golf match on Wednesday:

"Deron Williams is a Jazz legend! NBA star! Pro fighter! Scratch golfer!"

During his tenure with the Jazz, Williams averaged 17.3 points, 9.1 assists, and 3.2 rebounds in over 430 games played. While some fans in Ainge’s replies put his status as a “Jazz legend” in question, considering Williams is one of only eight players in team history to reach All-NBA honors, the amendment from the Utah exec is warranted.

Deron Williams has been nothing short of busy within other sports after calling it a career in the NBA back in 2017. Aside from an apparent side interest in golf, Williams appeared in an unexpected boxing match with soon-to-be NFL Hall of Famer Frank Gore in 2017.

While Williams did make the impressive jump from All-NBA guard to pro fighter, it did not result in much overwhelming success, as he lost to Gore in his sole match via split decision.

Although having minimal traction in his pro-fighting career, it seems his newfound golf career might be on a better track with Ainge’s stamp of approval.
