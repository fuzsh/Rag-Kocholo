(noting you as a source obviously.)\n\nLet me say something to you friend. Don't believe everything you see on the TV. The real life business is far off from Suits. Sir kicky might give real insight about how lawyering stuff is in the Sates I believe.\n\nDeron would get 3 times as much money? Like 18 mil insdead of 6? That's just bullfertilizer.\n\nWho watches Suits? I'm curious about the type of person who watches Suits.\n\nI watch it. But the Deron Williams thing was so lame ***, I felt ashamed for the author for a second. I mean there's actually sports without CBA and max salaries...Why use basketball? And if they use basketball at least mention illegal side deals or endorsement deals.\n\nI watch Suits, its a pretty good show, but I agree the Deron Williams thing was old and made no sense. Unless they were referring to something else, theres not a chance in hell that D-Will gets 3 times the market price\n\nSo \"Suits\" is a sitcom and they had a segment that mentioned Deron? Do I have this right?\n\nYes. It just was disappointing as the topic being discussed made no sense. The show has a lot of basketball references, which are usually funny.\n\nLOL.\n\nIn the scene on the show's website, the lawyer/agent confronts a Nets official in his Brooklyn office and demands that a Nets official give D-Will a big raise.

It just was disappointing as the topic being discussed made no sense. The show has a lot of basketball references, which are usually funny.\n\nit made no sense to you,\n\nbecause you dont get all the lawyer stuff and agent stuff.\n\nseriously people like yu are the dead of scripted tv.\n\nand the emergence of reality tv"
