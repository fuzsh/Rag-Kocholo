        "text": "Despite the Utah Jazz getting off to a shaky start to begin the new year, there’s still plenty of basketball to be played before determining how 2023-24 will play out. The opinions across the national media continue to be all over the map, but according to ex-Jazzman Deron Williams, Utah is positioned to surprise some people.\n\nWilliams shared his thoughts when he sat down with Fox 13 sports reporter Andrea Urban.\n\n\"I think they’re kind of flying under the radar, I don’t think a lot of people are expecting them to make a lot of noise. I feel like they have a good mixture of talent, you know. They have some young kids that can come in and surprise a lot of people, have some vets that know how to play the game. I feel like they’re well-coached. Obviously, this is a great culture that passes down from Ryan at the top, all the way to Danny Ainge and all the way through the coaches and players. I feel like they can actually make some noise this year.\"\n\nThe Jazz being blown out in two of their first three games isn’t the start Williams was hoping for, but it’s a marathon, not a sprint. Jazz head coach Will Hardy is still undergoing some trial and error regarding his rotation.\n\nIt may take a couple of weeks of accumulating data before the Jazz can put their best foot forward. Hardy acknowledged it’s not a perfect science following Utah’s victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Friday night.\n\n“As a coach, your number one focus usually is who’s in the game, and who plays well with who. And there’s still moments where it doesn’t look perfect, but I think tonight is better. Not just because we won, I just thought the flow of the game and how those lineups felt was better than Wednesday.\"\n\nThe biggest question circulating on the social media front is surrounding rookie Keyonte George. The No. 16 overall pick has shined when given opportunities, but being anointed the starter may take a minute.\n\nJazz fans may remember last season that Walker Kessler didn’t get his first start until game 27, even though it was apparent he was the best option within the first couple of weeks of the season.\n\nThat said, the way George’s competition is playing, it may happen sooner rather than later. Talen Horton-Tucker, Collin Sexton, and Kris Dunn haven’t done anything to stand out up to this point, but George may still need a trade or an injury to clear a path before an opportunity for starter minutes opens up.\n\nIf Williams's outlook of the 2023-24 Jazz is to come to fruition, then it’s best that closure on the matter happens soon. Stay tuned.\n\nFollow Inside The Jazz on Facebook andX."
