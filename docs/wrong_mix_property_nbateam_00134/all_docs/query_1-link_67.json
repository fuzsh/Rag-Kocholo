        "text": "“He’s been involved in the process since December,” GM Billy King said. “We talked about, ‘This is Plan A and this is Plan B and C.’ In training camp he was in my office after practice every day just sitting there. He calls himself, ‘the assistant GM.’ “\n\n“People get traded all the time,” Williams told Yahoo! Sports. “They don’t get backlash as an organization. If [players] leave, we are not loyal, we are ungrateful. People say stuff to me on Twitter. They already think I’m gone. They are out there bashing me, saying to me I’m a traitor. I didn’t ask to be here. I got traded. I didn’t come here being a free agent. This is the first time that I’m a free agent in my career.”"
