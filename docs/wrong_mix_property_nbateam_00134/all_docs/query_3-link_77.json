        "text": "The star center they sought remains in Orlando. The star center they have is idled with a broken foot. And they can’t be sure that their dazzling playmaker, practically new to the team, will stay for long.\n\nHere are the Nets, one foot in Newark, another in Brooklyn, approaching a fresh season with a sense of foreboding and even finality. Their 35th, and last, season as the New Jersey Nets begins tonight in Washington, with the optimism usually attached to a season opener muted.\n\nMuch of the uncertainty is tied to the point guard, Deron Williams, a Net for all of 12 games last season and destined to be a free agent after this season. The Nets need Williams to attract name players like Dwight Howard for the trip to Brooklyn, and the stars are more likely to flock to the Nets if Williams is around to cement the offense.\n\nIf you’re looking for some reassurance, Nets fans, it’s hard to come by.\n\nIn a quiet moment last week, Williams offered only this:\n\n“We’ll see. I want to see how this year goes.”\n\nFrom the moment the lockout ended, the Nets have been scrambling to put together a squad to entice Williams. How Billy King, the beleaguered general manager, works to manipulate the roster will be an overriding story.\n\nThe Nets are doing everything in their power to convince Williams, 27, he should move to Brooklyn with them. King is desperately trying to find a way to trade for Howard, the Orlando Magic center — which Williams has said would seal the deal on his return.\n\n• Nets stories and columns\n\n• Nets photos\n\n• Nets videos\n\nBeyond that, King and coach Avery Johnson consult with Williams on just about every decision they make in shaping the team. The scorecard should probably list Williams as court general, consultant and master recruiter.\n\nWhen Williams suggested the team sign free agent DeShawn Stevenson, it did. When starting center Brook Lopez went down with a broken bone in his foot, King moved quickly to trade for 6-11 Mehmet Okur — Williams' friend and former teammate with the Utah Jazz.\n\nKing tried to downplay Williams’ influence in assembling the Nets roster.\n\n“I talk to all players,” King insisted when asked about Williams recommending the team sign Stevenson. “I talked, last year, to Jordan (Farmar), before we traded for Sasha (Vujacic). So to get (Williams’) thoughts on players, because he played against them, or played with them, is a bonus.”\n\nJohnson acknowledged there is a conscious effort to seek Williams’ thoughts on everything from trades and signings to the length of practices. He and Williams met for brunch two Sundays ago, and Williams often makes it a point to check in with King away from the court, Johnson said.\n\n“You want to do it in a respectful way, because Billy King is the general manager,” said Johnson. “So you ask for opinions. Fortunately, with Deron, he likes to spend time with us.”\n\nAs a former point guard himself and a conduit between players and management, Johnson can relate to Williams’ position.\n\n“He comes to my office here and there before practice,” Johnson said. “I might ask him about a practice idea — time frames. That’s what I did when I played for (San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg) Popovich and I’ve seen it happen with other teams.”\n\nWilliams, who jokes with reporters that he is a “GM in training,” said in a recent interview that despite being the star player for the Jazz for five-plus seasons, he never had this kind of influence in the Utah organization.\n\n“It would have been nice,” he said. “But you know, it’s (two) different organizations (that have) a different way of doing things. You’ve got to respect that.”\n\nWilliams was traded to the Nets on Feb. 23, a day before the trade deadline, for point guard Devin Harris, rookie forward Derrick Favors, two first round picks and cash, believed to be $3 million. The trade came less than two weeks after Utah’s coach of 23 seasons, Jerry Sloan, resigned following an argument with Williams the night before during halftime of a loss to Chicago. Williams still bristles at the notion that he caused Sloan to resign and insists that he and Sloan got along fine.\n\nHe concedes, however, he hasn’t spoken to the former coach since his resignation.\n\n“We get along,” Williams said. “But we didn’t talk outside of basketball, outside of the court. I didn’t talk to him in the offseason; I didn’t talk to him when we weren’t in the gym.”\n\nIt's clearly a different dynamic between Williams, Johnson and King. That's the sort of gesture the Nets hope will be enough to convince Williams he should re-sign. Their efforts to acquire Howard took a major hit when Lopez fractured the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot Wednesday in a preseason game against the Knicks. Lopez had been the centerpiece of the Nets' efforts to acquire Howard.\n\nThe Nets say Lopez will be out six to eight weeks after surgery Friday, which would bring him back about a month before the March 15 trade deadline. If his rehab lasts a little longer than expected, or if Orlando ends up trading Howard to the Lakers or another team that presents them a more attractive bid than the Nets’ offer of Lopez, draft picks and expiring contracts, that’s where King must get creative.\n\nFailing to land Howard, Williams said, does not mean he’s automatically gone.\n\n“There could be some other players besides Dwight that would keep me here,” he said.\n\nThe question, which King will have to answer over the course of the season: Who?\n\nFor more Nets coverage, follow Colin Stephenson on Twitter at twitter.com/ledger_nets"
