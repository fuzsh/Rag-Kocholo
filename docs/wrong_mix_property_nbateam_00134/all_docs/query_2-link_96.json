        "text": "UPDATE: SportsDay Mavericks insider Eddie Sefko spoke with two Mavericks sources about the potential Williams to Jazz trade.\n\nTwo sources said Tuesday that the Mavericks are most concerned with getting quality draft picks back for either or both Bogut and Williams. By \"quality,\" that means somewhere between the late first round and middle second round.\n\nThe Mavericks are talking to everyone, but one deal being rumored Tuesday night that won't happen, sources said, is Williams returnng to the team that drafted him, the Utah Jazz.\n\nOriginal story below:\n\nWith the NBA trade deadline looming, rumors about which players will be coming and going are starting to fly.\n\nMavericks players are no exception.\n\nESPN's Tim MacMahon and Mark Stein are reporting that Utah is interested in acquiring Mavericks point guard Deron Williams via trade.\n\nWilliams was drafted by the Jazz in 2005, and played his first six seasons in Salt Lake City. According to the report, the 32-year old veteran still has \"maintained an offseason home in the Salt Lake City area, despite his trade to the Brooklymn Nets in February 2011.\"\n\nThe report notes that while no deal is in place as of Tuesday night, both the Mavericks and Utah are open to bringing Williams back to his original team.\n\n\"Williams can't be traded without his consent, thanks to his one-year, $9 million deal with the Mavericks after he played the previous season in Dallas, \" MacMahon writes. \"The 32-year-old would have to forfeit his free-agent Bird rights if dealt to another team.\"\n\nCurrently behind Williams at guard are Devin Harris, Yogi Ferrell and Seth Curry, with J.J. Barea set to return to action from his calf strain soon after the All-Star break."
