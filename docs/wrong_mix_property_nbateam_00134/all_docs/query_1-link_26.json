        "text": "Now that he has cleared waivers, guard Deron Williams has told the Cleveland Cavaliers he will sign with the team for the remainder of the season, a person with direct knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official.\n\nThe Cavs have had interest in Williams but could not absorb his salary in a trade without trading a player they wanted to keep. Following Thursday’s trade deadline, the Mavericks waived Williams, and he cleared waivers on Saturday.\n\nAll-Star forward LeBron James earlier in the season stated his desire to add another player – both for depth and to give James and All-Star guard Kyrie Irving a break from playmaking duties.\n\nMore NBA:\n\nThis is a quality buyout-market signing at an affordable price for a team over the luxury tax line – the veteran’s minimum for the remainder of the season. The Cavs had trade exceptions to use, but it’s unlikely they would’ve acquired someone like Williams with those exceptions. The buyout market was their best option to land a quality backcourt player. Cavs general manager David Griffin and his front-office staff have done a fantastic job adding to the roster with minimal salary-cap flexibility in the past three seasons.\n\nThis season, Williams is averaging 13.1 points and 6.9 assists and shooting 34.8% on three-pointers. Not only can Williams, who started 40 games for the Mavericks, run the offense, his addition should allow Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to give James and Irving fewer minutes in the final six weeks of the season.\n\nWilliams is a three-time All-Star, and while no longer the player he was with the Utah Jazz or Brooklyn Nets, he should be a productive backup on a championship-caliber team."
