        "text": "Brooklyn Nets guard Deron Williams is shaking off a tough few games and getting back to shooting like a superstar NBA player. We're not sure where his motivation is coming from -- but a new $15.8 million penthouse would probably light anyone's fire. That's gotta be what it is: Williams just bought himself a posh 6,800-square-foot pad for that price in New York City's high-rolling Tribeca neighborhood, the New York Post reported.\n\nWilliams snagged the place after it had gotten some serious celebrity action. Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was eyeing the six-bedroom, 4.5-bathroom penthouse last year, according to Curbed, but the music mogul decided to pass on it. Williams got a little bit of a deal, at least. The home was listed for $16.9 million at one point before the Nets star scooped it up for more than $1 million less.\n\nIt's a heck of a place: You've heard of chef's kitchens, but this place has a real one. It's restaurant grade, with the best of the best in stainless steel appliances, ample freezer storage and a long island -- everything you'd find in a four-star eatery. The home also has massive rooms, a conservatory with soaring glass ceilings, a climate-controlled wine cellar and an expansive 3,000-square-foot terrace (featuring a bridge and koi pond).\n\nFind homes for sale in New York, N.Y., or search listings in your area.\n\n%Gallery-177778%\n\nSee more Houses of the Day on AOL Real Estate.\n\nGot a tip for House of the Day?
