        "text": "The Northwest Division-leading Utah Jazz (35-22) reportedly could be looking to try and strike a trade deal with the Dallas Mavericks (22-34) for a return of their veteran point guard Deron Williams. The Jazz have been trying to move back to prominence and up the Western Conference standings and get back into the NBA Playoffs. Williams has been averaging 13.1 points, 6.9 assists and 2.6 rebounds with Dallas this season; however with injuries plaguing him and the emergence of Yogi Ferrell, a Williams trade could make sense.\n\nWilliams had his best years with the Jazz, appearing in two All-Star Games and helping guide the team to the 2007 Western Conference Finals. He played for five seasons with the team, averaging 17.3 points, 9.1 assists, 3.2 rebounds and .466 field goal percentage in 439 games. However, since his trade to the Brooklyn Nets in 2011, the Jazz have not played in one playoff game and has only appeared in one playoff series.\n\nWilliams commented about his time in Salt Lake City while back in Brooklyn, stating his support to the Jazz:\n\n“Truth is, we enjoy getting away from the hustle and bustle and going back to Utah every summer. It’s a relief to take that timeout. No traffic. No crowds. My daughters still have their friends there. There’s a big backyard. They go to the pool, the playground, and they jump on the trampoline. Kids running wild and free here…? I don’t think so.”\n\nOf course if the Mavericks were to trade Williams, he’d have to approve the move with the no-trade clause he presently possesses. The deal would send Williams and his one-year $9 million contract to the Jazz, possibility along with Bogut, who’s in his three-year $36 million contract with the Mavericks including $11 million in 2016-17. The result would be a total cap space of $20 million for Dallas. This possible help in cap space would be seen as a positive move by Maverick’s owner Mark Cuban, as the team ranks 27th in the league.\n\nThe 32-year old Williams was drafted by the Jazz in 2005 after spending three years playing collegiate ball for Illinois. At Illinois he was critical to their success, when he led the team to the National Championship Game and a #1 ranking in 2004-05 season. Since being drafted, Williams has earned $142.6 million in total compensation in the NBA. His solid career likely has a few formidable years left, some of which could be in Vivint Smart Home Arena where his career began back in 2005.\n\nHis presence could lend itself to the young core group of players and cohesive play, making the team the dark horse of the Western Conference and more formidable to the top of the Western Conference as the NBA Playoffs begin in just over a month."
