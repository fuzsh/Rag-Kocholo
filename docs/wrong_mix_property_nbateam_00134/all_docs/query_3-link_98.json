        "text": "Amazon makes near daily deliveries here at The Glam Pad… We are hooked on the convenience and also the boundless trove of treasures just waiting to be discovered. With Amazon’s Prime Day sale in full swing today and tomorrow, we decided to query some of our favorite interior designers and influencers to uncover their top Amazon go-tos! What are your favorite Amazon finds? We’d love to hear in the comments below!\n\nAnthony Baratta\n\nAnthony Baratta, The King of East Coast Chic\n\nJames Farmer\n\nJames Farmer Interiors\n\nIf in a pinch, designer James Farmer turns to Merville brand drapery hardware (mainly rings and French return/wrap around) are a good quick option on the design side. They are available on Amazon!\n\nAshley Hanley\n\nAshley Hanley in Richmond, VA\n\nI love to put together lists for my clients with coffee table books to purchase to start their book collections on design, garden, etc. books.\n\nI also find Amazon as a great resource for last minute party prep – block print tablecloths, cloth napkins and even Italian blown glassware. I’ll use this if I can’t find any of these types of goods locally at the last minute.\n\nSara Hillery\n\nSara Hillery Interior Design\n\nAmazon is the perfect resource for design and landscaping books, jewelry organizers, drawer dividers, ribbons for the holidays for decorating the house, live bulbs, dishware, cocktail napkins, French onion soup bowls, office supplies, and more!\n\nKelli Delaney Kot\n\nFounder / KDHamptons\n\nTOPBUXUS Restore & Protect Mix is the magic ingredient to keeping all of my boxwoods in supermodel shape here at our Hamptons home, Maple Shade. The hedges framing my parterre garden, and all of the potted & planted boxwoods on the property are sprayed every 2-3 weeks during the summer season. They stay lush, green, and gorgeous!\n\nMiles Redd\n\nRedd Kaihoi\n\nA classic piece at an affordable price.\n\nTug Rice\n\nArtist\n\nI pack this storage case when I know I’ll be wearing ties and pocket squares on a trip. The flap also fits rings, cufflinks, and other accessories. It’s slim, nice looking, and reliable.\n\nThis was a Christmas gift I gave my brother-in-law a couple of years ago. It’s the Cadillac of cork openers! Great for older, precious bottles that might easily break with a standard opener.\n\nThe secret to keeping an open shirt collar structured and in place. A minor thing but they help make you look sharp.\n\nPretty sure this really is the world’s best back scratcher. It’s actually kind of beautiful, too!\n\nThis book is like a crash course in dissecting what makes a successful living space. It breaks down all the visual elements of a home and breaks open the eye so you learn to appreciate the history, craftsmanship and quality of the components. Impressive and useful.\n\nJan Showers\n\nJan Showers & Associates\n\nI love products from Biologique Recherche and order Lotion P50 and Masque Vivant.\n\nThey are French products and really great.\n\nI also love Epionce Firming Mask.\n\nIt’s great when weather is dry and I leave on overnight\n\nOf course, I love to buy books—can’t wait for my dear friend, Mark Sikes new book in September. I have pre-ordered it.\n\nJust received Peter Marino’s new book.\n\nMally Skok\n\nMally Skok Design, Palm Beach, Florida\n\nI love Amazon for buying pieces of furniture, accessories and glassware for my house, including:\n\nRivers Spencer\n\nClothing, Interiors, Antiques"
