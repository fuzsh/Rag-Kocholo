        "text": "\"I had great years here, some of the best years of my career,\" Williams said, per Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News. \"This place is still special to me. I still make it my home in the summer, so I love coming back here and loved my time with the Jazz.\"\n\nWilliams would have to approve any trade because he would relinquish his accrued Bird rights with the Mavericks.\n\nThe Jazz's motivation largely stems from starting point guard George Hill's injury issues. Hill has dealt with a sprained toe for most of the first half of the season, missing 25 games. While he has been a revelation when in the lineup, Hill's absence has exposed the weaknesses in Dante Exum and Shelvin Mack's ability to run an offense.\n\nWith Utah hanging around as a potential No. 4 seed in the West, adding Williams could provide a short-term insurance policy for the second half."
