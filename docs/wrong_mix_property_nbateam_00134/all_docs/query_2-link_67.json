        "text": "CHAMPAIGN – The last time Deron Williams took the floor in an Illini uniform, Illinois was on a 29-game win streak, ranked No. 1 in every college basketball poll and Williams was a projected top-five pick in the 2005 NBA draft (he was eventually selected third overall by Utah).\n\nA lot has changed since then for both Williams and the Illini.\n\nIllinois is on its second coach since Williams' coach, Bruce Weber, was fired after the 2011-12 season. The Illini have qualified for five NCAA Tournaments in the past 12 seasons.\n\nWilliams spent the last 12 years playing with four different NBA teams and two different Olympic gold-medal teams, but has since taken a step away from the game.\n\nWhile technically not retired, Williams is enjoying the extra time he has had with his family since last season when he made a trip to the NBA Finals as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. He’s appreciated the personal travel he’s been able to do and has even started a podcast with some friends called \"Ballers and Brawlers\" which has reached over 20 episodes.\n\nThe extra time also allowed Williams to make a trip to Champaign on Monday as a guest judge for Jock Jams, a variety show put on by student athletes.\n\nJock Jams timed perfectly for Williams to attend the Illinois basketball game against Rutgers on Tuesday night, the first Illini game he’s attended since his playing days back in 2005. Illinois coach Brad Underwood knew having Williams speak was an opportunity he couldn’t pass up.\n\n“He’s done things that everyone in that locker room aspires to do and dreams about,” Underwood said. “You’re talking about the number three pick in the draft, you’re talking about a guy that I have tremendous admiration for because he wasn’t the McDonald’s All-American on his high school team. That was a guy that did it through hard work.”\n\nWilliams spoke with the team before Monday’s practice and stuck around to watch a bit of the action unfold. The 33-year-old spoke about his time at Illinois and his journey to the next level.\n\nThe Illini are in a bit of similar situation in regards to a leadership change that Williams experienced as a player. After his freshman season Bill Self left to take the Kansas job and Weber was hired by Illinois.\n\n“Talking with [Underwood] yesterday he was talking a lot about culture change and that definitely starts at the top, but I talked to the guys a lot about it and I said coaches can only do so much,” Williams said. “They can only say so much. It’s got to be on you guys. You guys got to want to change. You guys go to want to win.”\n\nHis words resonated with the team, especially Trent Frazier.\n\nThe freshman guard has started the last seven games for Illinois and has been averaging 16 points per game over that stretch. Frazier’s 11.7 points per game average ranks him in the top-seven of scoring average for an Illinois freshman.\n\n“He just really talked about ways to get to his level,” Frazier said. “Hard work and just trusting the process and just grinding. That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now.”\n\nOver the course of the couple of days Williams was on campus he took some time to visit familiar spots and spend some time with other Illini athletic teams. He noted the vast changes on campus comparing Green Street to Manhattan with the new high rise apartments.\n\nWilliams, a wrestling fan and avid golfer, stopped by the Illinois wrestling team and men’s golf team practices. Illinois athletic director Josh Whitman accompanied Williams and his wife over the course of couple of days they were in town.\n\n“It was good to spend some time with him,” Williams said about Whitman. “I didn’t care for the last AD to say the least. I definitely got a good vibe from Josh and meeting him for the first time. I think he’s going to be really good for this program and I’m excited about the things he’s done so far.”\n\nWhile the Illini find themselves in 13th place in the conference through 10 Big Ten games Williams still gave a nod of confidence to the group. He believes the path to winning starts with their approach in practice.\n\n“The culture change has to come from within,” Williams said. “[It] has to come from them in practice, competing, making practice harder than games so that when they get in games it’s easy. That’s kind of what we did.”\n\nMatt Gertsmeier can be reached at mattgertsmeier@gmail.com. Follow him on Twitter @MattGertsmeier"
