        "text": "About 18 months ago, as Deron was about to make a career transition, he was blindsided by life-changing news. His oldest son, D.J., a child often attached to his father’s hip, had been diagnosed with autism. There had been troubling signs before the diagnosis. D.J.’s speech regressed, and he began mumbling instead of using words. He also wouldn’t make eye contact or respond to normal cues. After ruling out problems ranging from deafness to brain tumors, a doctor told the concerned parents that all signs pointed to autism — just as Williams was about to leave for Turkey to play during the NBA lockout.\n\nJohnson said one thing the Nets haven’t thought about doing to address star point guard Deron Williams’ season-long shooting woes is to bring in a shooting coach. “We haven’t talked about that,” Johnson said, “and if we’re going to start talking about stuff like that’s it’s more mental. “I think right now, he got in the gym early, he was soaking wet sweating before we even got out there. … He didn’t miss many shots today in our workout and there’s nothing mechanically wrong with his shot.”\n\nMo Williams looked up from the dry erase board. On it he had plotted small black marks, designing a play that he believed would work within the offense that was thrust into the spotlight this week when former point guard Deron Williams said he preferred Utah’s system to Brooklyn’s. Mo Williams knew well the symptoms his predecessor described to New York media this week. He, too, once played in the Utah offense and then left it. “I could tell the difference,” the Jazz point guard said, sitting courtside before Tuesday’s 104-94 win in Brooklyn. “Trust me.”\n\nBut Kidd, who clashed with Johnson during their short tenure together in Dallas, said Williams’ struggles this season aren’t about play- calling. “I don’t think it has anything to do with the coach,” Kidd said Thursday. “I think it’s just a matter of getting comfortable making shots. Also, he has new teammates. He’s got to get used to a new crew. It’s always a growing period. “He’s a grownup. He’ll figure it out. All things don’t go well right away sometimes. He’s just going through a struggle shooting the ball, but he’s one of the best at what he does, so he’ll work through it.”\n\nThe Knicks stormed back into the lead for good on the backs of their two stars, Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler, who combined for 15 of the 18 points that put the game out of reach. While Anthony scored from both outside, hitting a 3-pointer to put the Knicks ahead for good at 62-61 with 5:39 left, the Nets couldn’t keep Chandler away from the basket, allowing him to get several uncontested dunks off alley-oop passes thanks to pick-and-roll coverage breakdowns. “We had a game plan that we tried to execute tonight at the defensive end, and it wasn’t working,” said Williams, who finished with 16 points and 10 assists. “We weren’t doing the things we needed to. We weren’t getting the help in the right spots, our rotations were slow, we were letting guys drive right to the basket without any help … that’s not how we want to play.”"
