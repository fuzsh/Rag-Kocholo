        "text": "When Illinois decided to honor 20 players by hanging their jerseys over the Assembly Hall court, the first pick was easy.\n\nPoint guard Deron Williams, an NBA star and a member of the U.S. Olympic team in China, will have his jersey displayed on A Night of Legends, an alumni reunion game Sept. 13 that will bring some of the greatest names in Illini history back to the Hall.\n\n\"It's a big step to continue to establish our program and tremendous tradition we have here at Illinois,'' coach Bruce Weber said. \"If you're an Illinois basketball fan, I don't think you can have a better weekend.''\n\nWhile the rest of the 20 players to be honored won't be released by the university until later, Williams and several players will have their jerseys displayed on the same night that former Illini greats hit the floor. The reunion game is expected to bring together the starting five from the 2005 Illini -- Williams, Dee Brown, Luther Head, Roger Powell and James Augustine -- who finished as the NCAA tournament runners-up.\n\nAlso expecting to attend are Kenny Battle, Kendall Gill and Steve Bardo from the 1989 Final Four team, rekindling the possibility the two eras going against each other.\n\n\"The '05 guys are in better shape than the '89 guys, just because of their age,'' Weber said. \"We have to get them together. That would be a nice moment. The game will have more of an and-one type atmosphere, guys enjoying each other and getting up and down.''\n\nBrian Cook, Frank Williams, Marcus Griffin, Sergio McClain, Victor Chukwudebe and Kiwane Garris are also planning to attend. Robert Archibald, Lucas Johnson, Marcus Liberty and Eddie Johnson were among other names mentioned as possibilities.\n\nThe reunion game is scheduled for 7 p.m., several hours after Illinois' home football game against Louisiana-Lafayette. Reunion game tickets are $15 and will be available first to season ticket holders. Remaining tickets go on sale Aug. 22 at the Assembly Hall north box office and online at www.fightingillini.com.\n\nWilliams will hold a fundraiser in Chicago on Sept. 12 for his foundation, Point of Hope. Many of the same Illini will make an appearance there before heading to campus for the reunion game. Williams, who agreed to a $70-million, four-year contract with the Utah Jazz this summer, has endowed a scholarship for the basketball team.\n\nThe athletic department will decide upon the 20 players through a set of criteria, such as All-Americans, Big Ten Conference silver basketball recipients and all-time leading scorers. Names will be released sporadically, and some players might not be named or honored until a later date.\n\nThe jerseys will be honored similar to other programs, such as North Carolina jerseys in the upper reaches of the Dean Dome. Illinois will honor the jerseys but not retire the numbers.\n\nSmithâ€™s future\n\nFormer Illinois guard Jamar Smith and his family have several options to consider as he moves forward following his dismissal Thursday from the Illini basketball team.\n\nSmith needs only nine classes to finish his degree at Illinois, and his family has shown an early indication to the Illini basketball office that he may stay on campus as a student rather than transfer to another school where he could continue his basketball career, according to a department spokesman.\n\nDivision II powerhouses such as Southern Indiana and Winona State were among more than 100 schools that have inquired about Smith, who was dismissed from the program Thursday after the Champaign County state's attorney filed a motion to revoke his probation stemming from a felony driving under the influence conviction in 2007.\n\n\"That's his decision,'' Weber said. \"Right now, he's just taking care of his life. That's the most important thing we can do. We need to help encourage him. I talked to his grandfather this weekend. We hope he can get everything straightened out and make something of his life.''\n\nSmith's redshirt season last year and a court date on Sept. 17 make it difficult for him to transfer to another Division I program, leaving Division II and NAIA as the best options for a playing career.\n\nCamp Rantoul\n\nThe heat index reached 113 degrees Monday afternoon as the Illini football team endured split squad sessions on the first day of camp.\n\n\"We're so far ahead of how much we installed in the first practice, as opposed to the first practice three years ago,'' coach Ron Zook said. \"It's incredible. I liked the attitude. Of course, you should like the attitude on the first day.\n\n\"It was good. We got taxed a little bit. It was hot, but they fought through it.''\n\nIllinois sophomore receiver Brian Gamble and redshirt freshman offensive lineman Mark Jackson didn't practice because \"they have issues to work out,'' Zook said. Those issues aren't academic.\n\nFreshman tight end London Davis, of Cahokia, was on his way to camp Monday after passing the NCAA initial eligibility clearinghouse. Linebacker Evan Frierson still awaits clearance, but it should come later in the week, Zook said.\n\nJohn Supinie can be reached at Johnsupinie@aol.com."
