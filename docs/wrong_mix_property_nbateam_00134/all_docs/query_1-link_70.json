        "text": "BARCELONA — Owner Mark Cuban enjoys a good argument. Just ask Phil Jackson or Shaquille O’Neal, who both have mixed it up with Cuban through the media.\n\nNow, it’s Deron Williams’ turn to find out what it’s like to spar with Cuban.\n\nCuban on Tuesday fired back at Williams, who on Monday said that Cuban’s inability to attend the meeting where the Mavericks made their recruiting pitch might have made a difference in his decision. Cuban was taping episodes for Shark Tank when free agency began on July 1.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cuban responded with a not-so-subtle body shot.\n\n“I’m a big D-Will fan, but I’m kind of surprised that he would throw his front office under the bus like that by saying that I would make a difference,” Cuban said before the Mavericks’ exhibition game against FC Barcelona Regal. “I would have expected him to say — like I’d expect one of our guys to say — ‘Hey I’m so thrilled with the front office and the moves we made and our team that it wouldn’t have mattered what he did.’\n\n“That’s what I expect our guys to say and that’s the way I feel about our team. Again, I’m a big D-Will fan, but it’s not about individual players, it’s about building a team. And I really think we put together a good team for the current team and the future.”\n\nCuban had said two months ago that he felt the Mavericks would be better off in the long term because of Williams’ decision to spurn them and stay with Brooklyn.\n\nWilliams said Monday that if Cuban had been present for the meeting with Mavericks’ officials (Donnie Nelson, Rick Carlisle and Michael Finley), it might have cleared up some questions he had about the future of the franchise.\n\n“I’m flattered that he thought my presence would have made more of a difference than what the Nets’ management did,” Cuban said.\n\nMemories of Barcelona: Cuban and his family attended both Europe games and the owner was particularly happy about returning to Barcelona.\n\nIt wasn’t the first time he’s been to Palau St. Jordi, the arena that was built for the 1992 Olympics.\n\n“Me and a buddy decided we would take a road trip to Barcelona for the Olympics, and we’d figure out a way to get into the gold medal game,” Cuban said. “We used my lifetime pass on American [Airlines] to get over here and found a cheap hotel.\n\n“We got tickets to the gold-medal game and when we got to the arena they told us our tickets were counterfeit.”\n\nCuban and his buddy waited around and got lucky when officials found two tickets to sit in the press section.\n\n“It was awesome,” Cuban said.\n\nMavericks are long shots: The Mavericks barely cracked the top 10 among the favorites to win the 2013 NBA championship.\n\nThey are listed by online service bovada at 33-to-1, making them the ninth choice.\n\nOnly three teams are listed at less than 10-to-1: the Heat is 11-to-5 to repeat, followed by the Lakers at 5-to-2 and Oklahoma City at 9-to-2\n\nThe over/under on number of Maverick victories this season is 44½."
