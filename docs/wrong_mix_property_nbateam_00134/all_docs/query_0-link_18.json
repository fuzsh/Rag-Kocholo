        "text": "Because Salt Lake City ranks 25th among the league’s 30 teams in TV market size, Williams said he’d gain “15-20 million fans the minute you sign” with New York, Los Angeles or Chicago. But he also doesn’t seem consumed with wanting to play under a bigger spotlight. “Say what you want about small markets,” Williams said. “They are what they are. They have their advantages just like big markets have their advantages and disadvantages.”\n\nNow, Williams is ready to teach. Rookies Gordon Hayward, Ryan Thompson and Jeremy Evans require serious schooling. But Williams’ prized pupil is Utah’s biggest and most important offseason acquisition: center Al Jefferson. “I’m going to constantly talk to him and work him through it,” said Williams, following the Jazz’s first training camp workout Tuesday at the team’s practice facility. “We definitely have to get an understanding and get a feel for each other — where each other is going to be on the court — because that’s what me and [Carlos Boozer] had. … I’m going to figure that out with Al. I’m going to figure out where his favorite areas are, where he’s best at, and work from there.”"
