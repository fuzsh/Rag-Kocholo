        "text": "As expected, Mark Cuban didn’t take the comments Deron Williams made following Monday’s practice lying down.\n\nAfter the Nets point guard said that Cuban’s absence from his meeting with the Mavericks in July helped him decide to re-sign with the Nets, Cuban came out swinging when speaking to the Dallas Morning News before his team’s preseason game against FC Barcelona Regal Tuesday in Barcelona, Spain.\n\n“I’m a big D-Will fan, but I’m kind of surprised that he would throw his front office under the bus like that by saying that I would make a difference,’’ Cuban said. “I would have expected him to say – like I’d expect one of our guys to say – ‘Hey I’m so thrilled with the front office and the moves we made and our team that it wouldn’t have mattered what he did.’\n\n“That’s what I expect our guys to say and that’s the way I feel about our team. Again, I’m a big D-Will fan, but it’s not about individual players, it’s about building a team. And I really think we put together a good team for the current team and the future.”\n\nWhile Cuban used the comments from Williams to try and poke fun at the Nets, it was clear from the point guard’s comments that he was very pleased with the way the Nets went about their business this summer.\n\nIn fact, when he was asked about what questions he would have liked to have Cuban answer, Williams specifically referenced the difference between Dallas’ approach – which was to “trust our track record,” according to Williams – and that of the Nets, as Williams made sure to point out that Nets general manager Billy King was giving him daily briefings on what the team was doing to try and surround him with more talent.\n\nWilliams said Monday that Cuban’s absence left him with questions that the organization’s representatives at the meeting – including president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson and head coach Rick Carlisle, couldn’t answer. Cuban didn’t come to New York for the meeting because he was in Los Angeles filming “Shark Tank,” his reality television show.\n\nCuban said in a radio interview in August that he felt the team might be better off down the road for not signing Williams this summer because of the salary cap flexibility they still have moving forward, and he stuck to that script again Tuesday.\n\n“He’s a superstar point guard, but my goal is to build a team,” Cuban said. “That’s the important thing, to try to win championships.\n\n“I’m flattered that he thought my presence would have made more of a difference than what the Nets’ management did.’’\n\ntbontemps@nypost.com"
