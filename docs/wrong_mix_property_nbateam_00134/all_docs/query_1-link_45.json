        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Kyle Korver and Deron Williams are not afraid to go bold, you know that. With training camp more than a month off they are preparing for something totally different and they'd admit a little preposterous.\n\nD-Will and Korver are about to throw a party and call it a dodge ball tournament to raise money for the Christmas Box House.\n\n\"Over the summer we were trying to think of a good event that we could do together, and we came up with the dodge ball idea,\" Korver said. \"It's September 12th. We're inviting anyone that wants to come play us. We're going to throw a little dodge ball tournament together. The winners get to play a team of Jazz players.\"\n\nWilliams says he's never played dodge ball before.\n\n\"I haven't, but I think he's (Korver) a little more humble than me. I don't think anybody in the state can beat us,\" says Williams with a wry smile. \"I feel we're natural athletes, so we're going to excel in dodge ball.\"\n\nIn order for these guys to excel at dodge ball, both Korver and Williams have been in training, at the expense of those shopping at the Gateway.\n\n\"You know, we just came to the idea that we wanted to do some videos and stuff to get it out there and get people aware of what we're trying to do. It's just something we did that is fun,\" Williams said.\n\nFor those who aren't Jazz fans, this may be an opportunity for them to take a clean shot at these pros if they can.\n\nIf you would like to participate, you can sign up on Deron William's website (www.deronwilliams.net) or Kyle Korver's website (www.kylekorver.com)."
