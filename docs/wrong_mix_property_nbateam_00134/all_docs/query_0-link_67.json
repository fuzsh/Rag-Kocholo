        "text": "On Monday night, the Nets got the crushing news that their all-out bid to get Carmelo Anthony had failed, and the Denver Nuggets had decided to trade Anthony to the rival Knicks.\n\nToday, the Nets rebounded in the biggest way imaginable.\n\nIn a stunning move that caught most of the league by surprise, the Nets acquired All-Star point guard Deron Williams from the Utah Jazz, trading point guard Devin Harris and rookie power forward Derrick Favors, plus two first-round draft picks and cash, believed to be $3 million.\n\nAcquiring Williams, who has averaged 21.3 points and 9.7 assists for the Jazz this season, gives the Nets the legitimate NBA star the franchise has been seeking since Jason Kidd was traded in 2008. The 6-3, 209-pound Williams is one of the top point guards — indeed, one of the top players — in the league.\n\n“Very rarely are you able to trade for somebody who’s arguably — arguably — the best at their position,\" Nets coach Avery Johnson said after the Nets practiced for the first time since the All-Star break. “We know we had to give up a lot to get him but we felt it was worth it.\"\n\nWilliams will be introduced to the media Thursday at a 3 p.m. press conference at the Nets’ practice facility. Coincidentally, 3 p.m. happens to be the NBA’s trade deadline, and the Nets were still working tonight on making more deals.\n\nThe Nets stayed active tonight, sending Troy Murphy to the Golden State Warriors, along with a second-round pick in 2012, for backup big men Dan Gadzuric and Brandan Wright.\n\nGeneral manager Billy King suggested that, besides Murphy, “I don’t foresee myself doing anything else.”\n\nHowever, Johnson seemed to think the Nets weren’t necessarily done.\n\n“I think we’re looking at some other situations,” besides Murphy, Johnson said.\n\nThe only worry for the Nets in acquiring Williams is that they will have to sign him to a contract extension. He’s signed through next season and has the option to become a free agent in the summer of 2012, which means the Nets have the rest of this season and all of next to sell him on their vision of moving to Brooklyn and building themselves up to be one of the elite teams in the NBA and a global brand.\n\nKing — who called Williams “the best point guard in the NBA\" — claimed he doesn’t see it that way.\n\n“I don’t look at it as a selling job,” he said. “I just spoke to Deron. He’s excited. He’s looking forward to it. He understands where we are and where we’re trying to go, and he’s ready to help us build as we head from Newark to Brooklyn.”\n\nWilliams, whose wife is pregnant with the couple’s fourth child, is earning $14.9 million this season and due $16.3 million in 2011-12. He would earn $17.8 million in 2012-13 if he doesn’t exercise his option to become a free agent.\n\nThe Nets cannot sign him to a contract extension before July 18, 2011, which is after the current collective bargaining agreement expires on June 30. So any extension would come under the terms of the new CBA, which may not be agreed upon until after a lengthy lockout.\n\nWilliams, who was with Utah in Dallas today, was expected to fly to New Jersey and take his physical Thursday morning, do the press conference, then fly with the Nets back to Texas. The Nets play the Spurs in San Antonio tomorrow and the Rockets in Houston on Saturday. King is hoping all the players pass their physicals in time and Williams will be able to play in both games.\n\nWilliams was blamed by some in the media for the abrupt resignation of longtime Jazz coach Jerry Sloan on Feb. 10. But in their press conference announcing the deal, Utah GM Kevin O'Connor said the Jazz didn't trade Williams because of Sloan's resigning. Instead, the Jazz front office believed Williams would not re-sign with the team and tried to get something for him rather than lose him to free agency.\n\n“It’d be great to have him finish his career in a Jazz uniform, but I just never got the impression his heart was in it,” Jazz owner Greg Miller said.\n\nWhile the Knicks introduced Anthony to the media today and he made his debut later against the Milwaukee Bucks at Madison Square Garden, the Nets believe they may have made a bigger score in getting Williams. As a point guard and distributor of the ball, Williams is probably a better lure for potential free agents than Anthony would have been.\n\n“I think he’s a player that if I was playing basketball, even though I couldn’t shoot, I’d want to play with him because he could get me layups,” King said.\n\nColin Stephenson: cstephenson@starledger.com\n\nTRADE TREND\n\nThe Nets have made a habit of acquiring starting point guards via trade.
