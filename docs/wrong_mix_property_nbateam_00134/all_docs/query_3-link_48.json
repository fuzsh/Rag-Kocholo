        "text": "The Utah Jazz will be aggressive looking to add depth before Thursday's NBA trade deadline, The Tribune has been told, although one target has already gotten away — and an intriguing potential reunion could be a possibility.\n\nThe Jazz reached out to the Los Angeles Lakers with an interest in acquiring shooting guard Lou Williams, but the guard was traded on Tuesday afternoon to the Houston Rockets for Corey Brewer and a first-round draft pick. Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo's The Vertical first reported the trade, which was later confirmed by league sources to The Tribune.\n\nWilliams, 30, is one of the better bench scorers in the league. His $7 million contract over the next two years made him attractive on the market, especially given his talent and scoring ability.\n\nThe Lakers were shaken up on Tuesday with the firing of longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak and team vice president Jim Buss, with team legend Magic Johnson taking over as team president. Multiple reports have agent Rob Pelinka, who represents Jazz guard Dante Exum among others, joining the Lakers front office as their next general manager.\n\nWith one Williams off the market, Tuesday night's biggest development was the interest in another player with that last name — former Jazz star Deron Williams, now with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nTim McMahon and Mark Stein of ESPN reported that the Jazz have reached out to Dallas about Deron Williams' availability, but that a deal was not imminent.\n\nWith Williams, the Jazz advanced as far as the 2007 Western Conference finals. He led the team to four playoff appearances overall and two postseason series wins in his time before being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for a package that included Derrick Favors — himself the subject of trade speculation this week.\n\nBut sources have told The Tribune that the Jazz are hesitant to trade Favors before Thursday's deadline unless they are overwhelmed by an offer. Sources have told The Tribune that the Phoenix Suns have inquired about Favors' availability.\n\nEven through he has been dealing with a nagging knee injury throughout the season, Favors is still important to the success of the team. Favors is on a team-friendly contract through the end of next season.\n\nAfter the trade deadline passes on Thursday, the Jazz return from the All-Star break on Friday night at the Milwaukee Bucks. Utah is 35-22 this season and a half-game behind the Los Angeles Clippers for fourth place in the Western Conference and home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs.\n\ntjones@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @tribjazz"
