        "text": "Be happy for Deron Williams.\n\nHe's taken a lot of grief in his career. And he's shouldered that criticism pretty well. He hasn't turned into a grumpy Gus like a few other players who weren't always fan favorites.\n\nWe won't mention any names, if that's OK with Monta Ellis.\n\nBut no matter what people in Brooklyn or Utah think of Williams, he's looking pretty good to Maverick fans today.\n\nWilliams knocked down the two biggest shots of the game in the Mavericks' 117-116 double-overtime thriller over Sacramento. He got them to overtime with a layup with 2.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, which put them up by two points and allowed them to keep playing despite DeMarcus Cousins' buzzer-beating bucket at the other end.\n\nThen, with the Mavericks' down by two, he caught a pass in the left corner, faked a shot, then let it fly for a 3-point game winner as the buzzer sounded.\n\nIt was a massive payoff for a calculated gamble by coach Rick Carlisle, who elected not to foul Sacramento even though the Kings took possession with a 116-114 lead and 26.3 seconds to go.\n\nIf they play their cards right, the Kings could have run out the clock.\n\nThey could have milked 23.5 seconds, then taken a shot and if it hits the rim, it would have allowed the last two seconds - or at least some of it - to trickle off the clock and the Mavericks' best hope would have been to call a quick timeout and hope to have a fraction of a second to work with.\n\nDarren Collison's shot never touched the rim and the shot clock expired. So the Mavericks had 2.3 seconds to work with and the ball in their front court.\n\nIt was plenty of time and, as it turned out, a brilliant coaching move.\n\nWilliams, by the way, had an amazing second overtime. He scored seven points. On the Mavericks' other six points - a pair of 3-pointers - he got the assist on both.\n\nHe finished with 25 points. It was the sort of game that can renew a player's self-confidence and put a little more pep in his step for days or weeks to come.\n\nThe Mavericks need that sort of confident Williams. He's a critical piece of this season - perhaps the most critical piece if the Mavericks are going to make any real noise in the playoffs."
