        "text": "SALT LAKE CITY -- A lot of time has elapsed since Deron Williams left the Utah Jazz in acrimonious fashion in the 2010-11 season.\n\nNearly six years and two teams later, Williams and the Jazz have moved on. He still remembers his five-plus seasons in Utah fondly and still has a summer home that he stays at in nearby Park City.\n\n\"I had great years here, some of the best years of my career,\" Williams said. \"This place is still special to me. I still make it my home in the summer, so I love coming back here and loved my time with the Jazz.\"\n\nLast April, Williams got the chance to meet with Jerry Sloan, who was his coach while with the Jazz. The two butted heads more than a time or two when Williams was with Utah. Sloan retired 12 days before Williams was traded. The two made their peace last season.\n\nWilliams said he's been impressed by the way the Jazz have recovered after making the blockbuster trade that sent Williams to the Nets for Devin Harris, Derrick Favors and draft picks.\n\nThe Jazz were coming off a surprising win at San Antonio on Tuesday.\n\n\"They had a transition period where they were stockpiling assets and getting a bunch of young players,\" Williams said. \"You've kind of seen them grow over the last couple years. And now adding George Hill, Boris Diaw, Joe Johnson, veteran guys like that, it kind of rounds this team out. They're a really good team.\n\n\"It was a really good win to go down to San Antonio and come out with a win. I was definitely really impressed, and it shows they are a capable team.\""
