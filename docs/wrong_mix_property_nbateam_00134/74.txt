Former All-Star point guard Deron Williams appears to regret his decision to leave the Utah Jazz in 2011. Williams was at the peak of his career before everything went south when he was traded to the New Jersey Nets.

Williams posted a highlight of him playing for the Jazz through his Instagram account:

His post brought back good memories of his All-Star days, a span of time when he was regarded as one of the best point guards in the league. The 6-foot-3 playmaker possessed brilliant court vision and could score with the best of them.

Williams also took his sentiments to Twitter when he replied to a comment:

Williams led the Jazz to four straight playoff appearances, making it to the Western Conference Finals once. His tenure in Utah is arguably the second-most successful period of the franchise after the Karl Malone-John Stockton era.

In 2011, Williams left a promising Jazz team that included Gordon Hayward, Paul Millsap, and Al Jefferson. His issues with then-head coach Jerry Sloan were widely-documented and a primary cause of his departure. Williams was about to enter unrestricted free agency the year after that, and the team's front office opted not to risk letting him walk away for nothing.
