        "text": "PARIS — Visitors to the Pompidou Center this summer are greeted with a vitrine that stretches uninterrupted before them for 120 linear feet. Unspooled inside it is the 1951 typescript of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road,” page after page of tracing paper taped together to form a single continuous sheet, the defining road novel of its time laid out before them like so much two-lane blacktop. “That river of words,” mused Jean-Jacques Lebel, an artist and onetime associate of the Beats who helped organize the museum show this manuscript introduces. “That Mississippi of words.”\n\n“The last part of it got chewed off by a dog,” he added.\n\nMr. Lebel was a 21-year-old artist when he met William S. Burroughs and Gregory Corso at a Left Bank poetry reading in 1957. For the next few years, he hung out with them at the squalid “Beat Hotel,” working with Allen Ginsberg to translate his poem “Howl” into French, helping to find a publisher in Paris for Burroughs’s “Naked Lunch” at a time when no American publisher would touch it — not even Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who had recently won an obscenity case that had been brought against him for publishing “Howl.”\n\nNow, white-haired and goateed at 80, Mr. Lebel has become an archivist of the movement he once served as an acolyte. As an associate curator of “Beat Generation: New York, San Francisco, Paris,” at the Pompidou through Oct. 3, he was a key force behind the first major retrospective on the subject since the Whitney Museum of American Art staged its “Beat Culture and the New America, 1950-1965” show in New York more than two decades ago."
