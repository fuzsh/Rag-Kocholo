        "text": "This article argues that the true depth of William Seward Burroughs II’s ideological legacy within Western esotericism has been somewhat underappreciated by historians of religion, and this is evidenced by the insufficient credit Burroughs has thus far received for his pivotal role in the emergence of the “2012 phenomenon.” The purpose of this article is to distinguish Burroughs’ works as centrally spiritual, thus providing a context that can allow scholars to properly measure the communities that gravitate to his ideas. The body of this article begins by examining Burroughs’ role in the 2012 phenomenon, and it will be argued that “anti-magical polemics” are perhaps partly responsible for somewhat reducing the awareness of Burroughs’ roles in esoteric currents of the twentieth century. A diachronic comparison is then undertaken by analyzing Gnosticism to provide a foundational context for situating Burroughs’ worldview as a transhistorical pattern of thought that herein will be defined as ‘archontism.’ The concept of archontism is then used to more accurately classify Burroughs’ literature as ‘books of the dead,’ and this article concludes with a refutation of anti-magical polemics that explicitly denigrate the study of esotericism.\n\nSelf-surveillance connotes that surveillance is not only a top-down phenomenon being enforced solely by governments or security agencies; it rather suggests that people are subjected to control and observation even by and among themselves. Derived from this notion, the term selfie-surveillance refers to a specific type of self-surveillance, emphasizing the role of recording instruments that also reflects the growing contemporary obsession with recording/sharing one’s body through social media. The notion of selfie-surveillance can benefit from Burroughs’s conception of control as junk—a metaphor for the never-ending desire for something with no practical purpose, like narcotics—as a key to analyze the emerging culture of surveillance on two levels. First, the fact that NSA surveillance is taking place for the sake of surveillance itself, gathering as much data as possible even if for no practical purpose; second, that the rise of selfies reflects an egocentric desire to solidify the bodies. Following an introductory chapter on the significance of the selfie and its relation to surveillance, chapter 2 investigates the theoretical advances of control of the body with a focus on its religious dimensions. It will first draw on Foucault’s notion of panopticism as a tool to identify the notion of self-surveillance; then, Deleuze’s understanding of the body—something not limited to the biological boundaries of the flesh—will be further explored in order to show how shared images are segments of the body and thus subjected to control. Chapter 3 offers an analysis of selected works of Burroughs to enrich the theories of surveillance discussed in the previous chapter. Burroughs’s investment in esoteric religious traditions enables him to offer a critique of control society that operates similar to junk. Burroughs believes the word to be a virus—an evil enemy that equals ego and encourages the body to consume image as junk. Yet, resistance towards control is possible through challenging the unification of the body and the recorded self.\n\nThis article is a study of marginal discourses in W.S. Burroughs's second novel, Queer. Whereas the place of Queer within queer literary theory has been questioned by Burroughsian scholars, we suggest that the novel can be partially studied within the frame of queer theory. Social notion of \" undesirables \" represented by the narrator and a circle of American ex-pats who flee to Mexico from restrictive laws of the US, brings up aspects of sexuality that are considered \" abnormal \" and therefore \" queer \" by the Cold War era political discourse. Paradoxically, though, interpersonal relationships between the narrator and his young lover Eugene Allerton transgresses the frame of queer theory to explicate general economics of control, order and a hidden desire for disintegration displayed in every discursive aspect of Queer, leading to the narrator's identity collapse and the novel's gradual loss of linearity."
