        "text": "Essential Question\n\nHow did beat writers like Jack Kerouac influence the Grateful Dead’s music?\n\nOverview\n\nNote to teacher: The handout in this lesson contains descriptions of drug use. Our hope is that the language used, which quite often details the repulsive nature of addiction rather than glamorizing it, will paint a realistic, and not desirable picture of drug use. However, we suggest reviewing the handout and making a plan for using it with your classroom before working with the lesson.\n\nIn post-WWII America, a radical new movement took over the literary world. Anchored by writers like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs, the Beat Generation, as they came to be known, viewed conventional American culture with disillusionment. They embraced things like free sexuality and drug use, explorations of Eastern religion, and a shirking of materialism in favor of a liberated lifestyle. One of the era’s most definitive works, Jack Kerouac’s 1957 novel On the Road, explores these themes through a semi-autobiographical road trip across America.\n\nBy the 1960s, the ideals espoused by the Beats were perhaps no better exemplified in musical culture than by the Grateful Dead. For their 30 year career, the Grateful Dead embraced the liberating, always-on-the-move lifestyle promoted by works such as Kerouac’s On the Road. The band eschewed industry conventions by becoming a perpetual “road band,” gaining a reputation not through chart hits, lavish studio recordings, or flashy media appearances, but via ceaseless touring and adventurous, inclusive,and always-changing live performances.\n\nIn this lesson, students will examine how the Grateful Dead exemplified the countercultural ideals promoted by Beat Generation writers by watching clips from Long Strange Trip, reading passages from Beat Generation writers, and brainstorming the ways the Grateful Dead’s approach to music was inspired by the Beat Movement.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nKnow (knowledge):\n\nBeat figures Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Diane Di Prima, Neal Cassady, Joyce Johnson, and Herbert Huncke\n\nThe band the Grateful Dead, and the influence Beat Culture had upon them\n\nHow Jack Kerouac and the Grateful Dead rejected social norms\n\nMastery Objective:\n\nStudents will be able to define the ideals of the Beat countercultural movement by examining the philosophical and aesthetic connections between Beat writers and the Grateful Dead.\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nPre-ticket Activity (Optional):\n\nThis lesson works best if students are in the process of reading Jack Kerouac’s novel On the Road.\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nShow Image 1, On the Road Scroll. Tell students that this was Jack Kerouac’s first draft for On the Road. Ask students:\n\nDo you think this is how most authors create a first draft? Why or why not?\n\nWhat might have inspired Kerouac to take such an unconventional approach to writing a novel? (Encourage students to consider the ways an unconventional writing process might lead to an unconventional novel.)\n\nWriters in Kerouac’s time used typewriters, which require the manual insertion of each page. How might have writing onto a continuous scroll affected how Kerouac composed On The Road?\n\nKerouac envisioned his writing style as “spontaneous prose.” What do you think this means? In what ways might it be different from how other authors often compose? How might have writing on a long scroll helped Kerouac achieve “spontaneous prose”?\n\nWhat challenges might have writing on a scroll presented compared to writing on a single piece of paper? What about compared to today’s standard of writing on a computer? How might have confronting such challenges helped Kerouac as a writer?\n\nHow might Kerouac’s notion of “spontaneous prose” inspire other means of expression, such as art or music?\n\nProcedure:\n\nPlay Clip 1, Dennis McNally, Jack Kerouac, and Jerry Garcia. Ask students:\n\nBased on what you learned in this clip, who are the Grateful Dead?\n\nHow did Dennis McNally become involved with the band?\n\nTell students they will examine the specific ways beat writers such as Jack Kerouac inspired Jerry Garcia. Arrange students into groups. Pass out one page from Handout 1 – Introduction to Beat Writers to each group. Tell the class that Kerouac was a member of the Beats, a countercultural literary group in the 1950s that drew inspiration from one another. Ask each group to read their page as a group, then ask each group:\n\nWhat beat figure did you read about?\n\nWhy was this figure important to the Beat Movement?\n\nWhat kinds of topics did they write about?\n\nBased on the excerpt you read, could you describe this figure’s writing style?\n\nWhat role did the writer play in Jack Kerouac’s life?\n\nHow might the writer have influenced Jack Kerouac’s writing style?\n\nWhat similarities did you notice between the excerpt you read and On The Road?\n\nShow students Image 2, On the Road Excerpts, and read aloud each excerpt as a class. Then, as a class brainstorm a list of values, both positive and negative, that Jack Kerouac and other Beat writers embraced, based upon the excerpts in handout 1 (the list might include values such as freedom, nonconformity, or hedonism). While brainstorming, encourage students to think about On the Road as well as the excerpts they read in their groups. Write the values discussed in class on the board. Ask students:\n\nHow are the values that Beat writers embraced represented in their writing? How is it represented in On the Road?\n\nHow might these values have been represented in other artistic practices, such as visual art or music?\n\nPlay Clip 2, “Being Alive Means to Continue to Change.” Ask students:\n\nIn the clip, how does Jerry Garcia define “being alive?”\n\nBased on Garcia’s emphasis on change and spontaneity, what might have a Grateful Dead concert sounded like?\n\nShow Image 3, Grateful Dead Set Lists. Ask students:\n\nWhat is being depicted on this image?\n\nWhere did these three concerts take place? What was the time frame for these three concerts? How many concerts did Grateful Dead perform per day?\n\nWhat do you notice about the songs presented between these three concerts?\n\nInform students that this information comes from a website which allows fans to catalog the songs the band played at every concert, including a space for people to make comments. Ask students:\n\nWhat observations might you make about Grateful Dead fans, based on their comments? What might they like about the band?\n\nWhy might the fans be so dedicated to cataloging the Grateful Dead’s concerts, and archiving recordings of their many concerts?\n\nBased on the evidence presented in this image, how might the Grateful Dead live by Jerry’s idea that to be constantly changing is to be alive?\n\nIn what ways does the Grateful Dead’s approach to playing concerts relate to the ideals set forward by the Beat Generation?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nReturn to the list of values the class brainstormed earlier in class. Ask students:\n\nDo you see any values in this list that could equally be associated with the Grateful Dead?\n\nHow might the ideals of the Grateful Dead and the Beat Generation be similar?\n\nBoth the Beats and the Grateful Dead valued spontaneity and freedom, but many of the Beat writers were addicted to drugs. Jerry Garcia died due to complications from drugs and alcohol. In what ways could drugs be associated with freedom? Based on the excerpts you read today, in what ways might drugs be associated with bondage?\n\nExtension Activities:\n\nWrite two essays about a memorable trip you once took. Write the first essay in “spontaneous prose,” or a stream-of-conscious style. For the second essay, take what you wrote in the first one and edit it into a shorter, more structured piece. What did you like or not like about this process? What do you like and dislike about each of your essays? How do the different approaches to writing affect your final product?\n\nWatch the video “Diane Di Prima Reads Revolutionary Letters #29 & #19.” Write a poem and recite it in a similar style as the video. Then, write a brief reflection on the ways performing a poem differs from writing one.\n\nOne of William Burroughs’ preferred writing strategies involved the “cut-up,” a creative writing project perhaps first described by 20th Century Romanian poet Tristan Tzara. Following Tzara’s instructions below, create your own cut-up poem.\n\nTo make a Dadaist poem:\n\nTake a newspaper.\n\nTake a pair of scissors.\n\nChoose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.\n\nCut out the article.\n\nThen cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in a bag.\n\nShake it gently.\n\nThen take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they left the bag.\n\nCopy conscientiously.\n\nThe poem will be like you.\n\nAnd here are you a writer, infinitely original and endowed with a sensibility that is charming though beyond the understanding of the vulgar.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Introduction to Beat Writers\n\nStandards\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\nCollege and Career Readiness Anchor Standards for Reading\n\nReading 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences from it;
