        "text": "In today’s world, it’s commonplace to hear someone say “take a beat” in ordinary conversation. But in the 1950s – the early years of the Cold War – the word BEAT was used quite differently. Then it referred to a literary movement, an individual who was a nonconformist, even a generation.\n\nThe Beat Movement is most often regarded as America’s first major literary movement of the Cold War Era. I know you’ve heard of some of its most famous writers. Jack Kerouac, for example, famous for his novel “On the Road,” and Allen Ginsberg, notorious for the poem “Howl.” They rebelled against conformity and materialism, instead promoting artistic expression, individual freedom, and counter cultural values.\n\nAdherents of the movement – Beatniks – hung out in dark smokey coffee houses, arguing about the meaning of life, reading poetry, listening to folk music and improvisational jazz, laughing at stand-up comedians like Mort Sahl, and watching experimental theater. You can watch Mort Sahl on YouTube here.\n\nThe Beat Generation\n\nThe Beat Generation emerged as a countercultural response to the conformity and materialism of post World War II America. Their rejection of mainstream society and emphasis on individual freedom reflected a critique of the capitalist values associated with the United States, indirectly challenging the American system that positioned itself as the antithesis of Soviet Communism. Their literary works and cultural contributions became a significant voice of dissent and a harbinger of later cultural transformations.\n\nRepresentative authors and their notable works include:\n\nJack Kerouac: On the Road\n\nAllen Ginsberg: Howl\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs: Naked Lunch\n\nLawrence Ferlinghetti: A Coney Island of the Mind\n\nGregory Corso: Gasoline\n\nCold War Influences on the Beat Movement\n\nWhile the Beat Movement wasn’t explicitly political, it was influenced by the ideological struggle and tensions of the era. Cold War influences on the Beat Movement can be observed in several ways:\n\nCountercultural Response/Spirit: The Beat Generation’s rejection of mainstream American society and values was, in part, a response to the perceived conformity and materialism associated with the United States during the Cold War. The Beats sought alternative forms of self-expression, advocating for individual freedom, spontaneity, and non-conformity, challenging the rigid social norms of the time.\n\nCritique of Consumerism and Capitalism/Materialism: The Beats’ critique of the materialistic consumer culture prevalent in the United States was influenced by the perceived shallowness and conformity they associated with capitalism, instead seeking a more authentic and spiritually fulfilling existence.\n\nAnti-Establishment Sentiment/Stance: The Beats’ writings often embodied an anti-establishment sentiment, which was influenced by their opposition to the political and social systems associated with the Cold War. They challenged the authority and perceived conformity of the government, institutions, and mainstream culture, reflecting a broader critique of the Cold War-era power structures.\n\nInfluence of Eastern Philosophy: The Beats were deeply influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism and Zen. This interest in Eastern spirituality can be seen as a reaction to the materialism and the political tensions of the Cold War, a stark contrast to the consumer-driven capitalist society of the United States.\n\nQuest for Personal Freedom and Escape/Alternative Lifestyle: The Cold War climate, characterized by the constant threat of nuclear annihilation and the anxiety surrounding ideological tensions, contributed to a desire for personal freedom and escape. The Beats often explored themes of wanderlust, seeking liberation from societal constraints through travel, experimentation with drugs, and exploration of alternative lifestyles. This quest for personal freedom can be seen as a response to the anxieties and restrictions of the Cold War era.\n\nCommodification of the Beat Movement\n\nHistorian Stephen Petrus tells us that the new subculture was turned into a commodity.\n\nFrom the end of 1958 through 1960, popular magazines, newspapers, television shows, and even comic strips bombarded Americans with images of the Beat Generation . . .\n\nTake a look at what Bullwinkle had to say below.\n\n“Beat” became a caricature in the popular imagination—think pretentious youths in black turtlenecks smoking and writing in French cafes. An early hint at what would be regarded by the mainstream as beatnik style came in 1956 musical Funny Face, starring Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire. In one scene, Hepburn dances around a smoky Parisian jazz cafe dressed head to toe in black, in tight pants and a polo neck sweater. You can watch her dance below.\n\nSimilarly, in Jean-Luc Godard’s stylish 1960 new wave classic Breathless, Jean Seberg plays an American in Paris, dressed in tight black pants, ballet pumps and a white t-shirt. You can rent Breathless on Amazon here.\n\nIn July 1959, Playboy magazine featured a “Beat Playmate,” actress and pin-up model Yvette Vickers, who told readers she liked “driving her Jag through the desert for kicks.”\n\nBeat Fashion\n\nWilliam Burroughs once said that On the Road “sold a trillion Levi’s.”\n\nHe went on to say:\n\nThe iconic denim brand is just one of the fashion companies to benefit from the disaffected, worn-out look popularized by the Beat Generation . . .\n\nBlue jeans, white t-shirts, workwear jackets and battered canvas holdalls were practical essentials for a life on the road, and they soon came to define the uniform for a generation of post-war youth disenchanted with traditional values . . .\n\n. . . for Beat women, black jeans, capri pants, and pencil skirts, paired with silk shirts and oversized sweaters, defied the popular hourglass fashions of the 1940s and 50s.\n\nIf you want to try the look, here’s a list of must haves:\n\nBlack Turtlenecks\n\nA Black Beret\n\nSunglasses\n\nBeads\n\nBongos\n\nFor women, you’ll want to add pencil skirts in black, gray, or navy blue.\n\nMen will want to have a full beard or at least a goatee.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nBeatniks rejected mainstream fashion and social norms, focusing on unique expression in fashion.\n\nThey were influenced by French bohemian styles and exuded an air of bohemian nonchalance.\n\nA minimalist approach to fashion emphasized their disgust with the consumerism and conformity of mainstream culture.\n\nFacial hair on males was seen as a rejection of traditional grooming norms and a way to express individuality.\n\nAn eclectic mix of styles added to the sense of individuality and artistic expression.\n\nSmoking was pro forma, and long thin cigarette holders contributed to a rebellious and unconventional image.\n\nWant to pull off a similar look today? Think individual expression: bohemian and boho chic; dark colors and unconventional accessories; and unique and personalized styles.\n\nIf you want to read more about Beatnik fashion click here.\n\nThe Beats and Music\n\nMost of this section was not written a human. It was written by Chat GPT (3.5). I have no idea whether it’s accurate or not. I’d love for any musicians who read it to leave a comment pro or con.\n\nThe Beat literary movement exerted a profound influence on music, shaping the countercultural music scene of the 1950s and continuing its influence today. The Beat’s emphasis on freedom of expression, spontaneity, and rejection of mainstream values resonated with musicians who wanted to explore new avenues of creativity.\n\nModern jazz artists like Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Thelonious Monk. sound-tracked the movement, and the style of the Beat Generation was heavily satirized and co-opted by the mainstream.\n\nI have to admit: while I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, I just don’t have the expertise to say very much about this. So I relied on Chat GPT 3.5 (the free version) to help me out. Please let me know if you find mistakes or bad info because I don’t really know how much GPT knows about this either."
