        "text": "The Beat generation, a group of bohemian, alienated youths who rejected traditional social and artistic forms, got started in the 1940s at Columbia with a chance meeting in 1943 between two freshman floor-mates, Allen Ginsburg (Columbia College 1948) and Lucien Carr (Columbia College 1943–44).ï¿½ Carr introduced Ginsberg to former football scholar Jack Kerouac (Columbia College 1940–42) who, in turn, introduced Ginsberg to William S. Burroughs, John Clellon Holmes, and Herbert Hunke.ï¿½ Ginsburg and Kerouac were students of legendary professors Mark Van Doren and Lionel Trilling.\n\nCoincidentally, Lawrence Ferlinghetti was also a presence at Columbia at this time, though he did not know either Kerouac or Ginsberg.ï¿½ After receiving his master's degree in 1947, Ferlinghetti moved to San Francisco in the early 1950s, founding the City Lights Bookstore and City Lights Publishers.ï¿½ His publication of Ginsberg's poem Howl in 1956 led to his arrest on obscenity charges.ï¿½ Ultimately, he was acquitted, but the resulting publicity drew national attention to Ferlinghetti, Ginsberg, and the North Beach literary scene."
