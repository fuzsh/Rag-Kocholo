        "text": "Beyond the Stars 5\n\nThemes and Ideologies in American Popular Film\n\nEdited by Paul Loukides and Linda K. Fuller\n\nPopular Press\n\nThe essays herein examine a small but important sample of the conventional themes and ideologies treated in popular film. Among the topics covered are family, social class, gender roles, politics, warfare, hedonism, and the 1960s. Taken singly or collectively, these essays suggest how certain themes and ideologies persist or evolve while others have only a brief life in movie consciousness."
