        "text": "Themes resonate with communities. Communities congregate around common themes. Communities endure whereas films perish at a certain point in time. Community interest can revive forgotten works. Many different communities are vested in similar themes. Common interests between creators, financiers, and promotional entities can exist within the themes of work.\n\nCould new sponsorship opportunities for ambitious work exist within the common interest of common themes?\n\nIf we identify common themes found in indie film, and then identify what films have those very themes, perhaps the other entities that are vested in the themes can help support those works.\n\nWhy don’t we start with the common themes… What are the common themes found currently in Indie Film? I tweeted this question out a couple weeks back and was a bit disheartened by the limited amount of comments it generated. Nonetheless I received a few suggestions to add to my list (so thanks for that). Perhaps you can add to this now."
