In the wake of a trial that convicted four Nazi agents of spying against the U.S., Warner Bros. became the first Hollywood studio to fire a salvo at Hitler's Germany. Months before World War II erupted it released this thriller based on revelations that emerged from the trial and other real-life sources. The story is a brisk connect-the-dots tale that ties German-American Bund operatives (Francis Lederer, George Sanders and Paul Lukas among others) to Berlin. Chief among those connecting the dots: FBI Agent Edward Renard (Edward G. Robinson). The drama wasn't limited to the screen. Production personnel received threats and violence erupted at some screenings. Directed with hard-hitting verve by Anatole Litvak, Confessions of a Nazi Spy struck a nerve in its era. It remains a milestone of filmmaking commitment today.",

        "text": "This is no “Beast of Berlin,” but a statement of sober inevitable facts, so brilliantly realized that no one can hide from it; it happens before his eyes.\n\nMay 23, 2024\n\nIt continues to be a telling historical marker and evidence of a Hollywood studio taking a moral and political stance when it was unpopular to do so.\n\nMarch 14, 2023\n\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy is a film that shows a studio with a conscience and one that uses their platform for the greater good.\n\nMarch 31, 2020\n\nAs motion picture entertainment removed from the sphere of political objections, this courageous Warner Bros. film will stand high when the outstanding pictures of 1939 are heralded. Confessions is pretty nearly tops in screen melodrama.\n\nOctober 22, 2019"
