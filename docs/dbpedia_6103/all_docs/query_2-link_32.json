        "text": "Spike Lee: Major themes in his films\n\nShelton Jackson “Spike” Lee is a controversial film maker known for is powerful films such as She’s Gotta Have It, School Daze, Malcolm X, and 25th Hour. Spike Lee isn’t afraid to talk about the real issues that goes on in the everyday lives of African Americans. Lee has shown a willingness to tackle prickly issues of relevance to the black community- and has savored every ounce of controversy his films invariably produce (biography). Major themes in his movies have a lot to do with police brutality on African Americans, racism, and Spike Lee wasn’t going to define black life in terms of crime and poverty. He wanted to raise awareness or at least let it be known what’s really going on in the black community’s. …show more content…\n\nSpike Lee’s film Do The Right Thing is essential in bringing the issue of race to the fore front of people’s conversation (Huff post). Do The Right Thing is a chilling morality tale of police brutality, telling the story of a deadly choke hold by police, sparking a race riot (Chang 2014). On March 3, 1991 Rodney King was severely beaten by four police officers in South Central, Los Angeles and they were found not guilty of the crime. Incidents like this is what sparks rage in African Americans. Spike Lee’s film is basically revealing what really is going on with police brutality. African American and communities of color face many ugly obstacles. For example Do The Right Thing debuted 25 years ago, similar events which took place in the movie are those of the final moments in Eric Garner’s life. Lee’s film in a way is history repeating itself and has some truth to it. “For me racism in this country is always perking underneath the surface and it takes OJ, or whatever you, some incident where it become flash point, and then it dies down till next thing happens” (Spike Lee Huff Post). After the Rodney King beating was the start of citizens not trusting in the system that is supposed to keep them safe. In another case a young black male, Mike Brown was killed on August 9, 2014. He was unarmed and nobody was in danger but the officer feared for his life. Why fear for your life if he is …show more content…\n\nMany people may not find anything positive about regular African Americans. “According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports, in the year 2008 black youths, who make up 16% of the youth population accounted for 52% of juvenile violent crime arrests including 58.5% of youth arrest for homicide and 67% for robbery” (Wikipedia). Spike Lee films such as Malcom X and Get On The Bus depict black people coming together instead of tearing each other down and shed a more positive light on African American culture. There are many stereotypes on every ethnicity and culture, but African Americans in particular may have the worst rap sheet. Spike Less criticized the way African Americans are portrayed in films and television (Yale Bulletin & Calendar). Long before television and film took over as leading forms of entertainment, African Americans have been cast in roles that aided in the perpetuation of racialized stereotypes. During the latter half of the 1800s minstrel shows were a popular form of entertainment among white Americans. These shows portrayed both free and enslaved African Americans (who were mainly played by whites) in an extremely demoralizing fashion. The minstrel show is the birthplace of “Jim Crow”. Jim Crow is most popularly seen in the context of the Jim Crow laws, which enabled white Americans to legally separate themselves from African Americans in nearly every facet of life (Antiracist"
