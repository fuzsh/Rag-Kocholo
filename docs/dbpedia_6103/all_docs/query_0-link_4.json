        "text": "Costa-Gavras's \"The Confession,\" which opened yesterday at the Beekman Theater, is not, I think, a better movie than his prize-winning \"Z,\" with which it will inevitably be compared, not only by the critics but also by those members of the public who may look for a repeat performance. The earlier film was a nearly perfect topical thriller whose form pretty much defined the substance of its liberal politics.However, because the subject of \"The Confession\" is much more complex, much more human, I find it vastly more interesting than \"Z,\" even when one is aware of the way Costa-Gavras manipulates attention by the use of flashy cinematic devices that sometimes substitute for sustained drama. It is a horror story of the mind told almost entirely in factual and physical terms, which is something of a contradiction.These are, however, the terms of which Costa-Gavras is a movie master, and in which Artur London originally wrote his book, adapted for the screen by Jorge Semprun, who also wrote the script for \"Z.\"\"The Confession\" is the real-life story of Artur London, a loyal Communist who certified his credentials by serving with the International Brigade in Spain and with the Communist anti-Nazi underground in France, and by a long term in a Nazi concentration camp. In 1949, Mr. London returned to his native Czechoslovakia from France to become Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the Communist Government of President Klement Gottwald. Two years later, along with 13 other leading Czech Communists (11 of whom were Jewish), Mr. London was arrested for treason and espionage and found guilty in what became known as .the \"Slansky trial.\"The Slansky trial, named for the secretary general of the Czech Communist party, who was also a defendant, was one of the last major gasps of the Stalinist purges that began with the Moscow trials in the 1930's. All of the Slansky defendants were found guilty and all but three, including Mr. London, were executed.Mr. London lived not only to see the defendants rehabilitated and to write his book but also to return to Czechoslovakia on the day in August, 1968, when Soviet troops invaded his country to end the short Czech spring.\"The Confession,\" with Yves Montand playing Mr. London and Simone Signoret his wife Lise, is the story of a believer's ultimate betrayal by his belief, of intolerable physical torture and psychological harassment (London is urged to confess to crimes he did not commit to prove his loyalty to the party), and, finally, of survival.It is a harrowing film of intellectual and emotional anguish, dramatized by the breathless devices of melodrama. Costa-Gavras employs abrupt jump cuts and flashes forward as well as back. He underscores the desperation of the meeting of some hunted men in a private apartment with the sounds of children roughhousing in the next room. It may, in fact, be one of the most aurally resonant movies I've ever seen. It is full of ordinary sounds made somehow ominous, like the slamming of doors (car, house, prison) and footsteps (on wood, brick, concrete).Its color photography by Raoul Coutard is also fine (natural overhead light in all the interiors), even when resorting to the zoom, which can be a legitimate tool in melodrama. Beginning with Mr. Montand and Miss Signoret, it is perfectly cast. One really responds to the faces, the attitudes and gestures in a Costa-Gavras film, as when, during the trial, the trousers of one of the emaciated defendants fall to the floor and he turns to the court with an expression of hopeless, perfectly confused laughter and despair.\"The Confession\" is a film of movement and sensation, as was \"Z,\" but there is at its center a complex human being. Like the book, it is an anti-Stalinist rather than anti-Communist polemic (Mr. London has written that he is interested in putting \"a human face\" on national socialism). One tends to forget the context, of the Londons' experience—the totality of a belief that would prompt a wife to denounce a husband that she has loved for almost 20 years, simply because the Party had to be right.You might not know it from the film, but the Londons are different from you and me—and from Arthur Koestler, whose disenchantment came earlier (1937) and was more complete. In a recent interview, Mr. Koestler recalled the blind party discipline that he eventually denied as he quoted André Malraux: \"A life is worth nothing, but nothing is worth a life.\" Because this is also the essence of \"The Confession,\" I liked it very much, even when its form is in combat with its substance.\n\nThe CastTHE CONFESSION, directed by Costa-Gavras; screenplay (French with English subtitles) by Jorge Semprun, based on a story by Lise and Artur London; director of photography, Raoul Coutard; produced by Robert Dorfman and Bertrand Javal; released by Paramount Pictures. At the Beekman Theater, Second Avenue at 65th Street. Running time: 133 minutees.

Jean BouiseAs a purported intimate view of hangups in a foundering marriage, \"Interplay,\" which opened at local houses yesterday, emerges as a largely ineffectual effort to make something special out of obvious, sex-centered material. Despite all its feverish sincerity, the decline and fall of John and Nora's upper middle class idyll—money, two nice little boys, a fancy suburban manse—is attenuated surface drama and presents a problem that apparently could have been solved simply and more quickly with some professional help.\"Interplay,\" which marks the film debut of the director, Albert T. Viola was shot in good color at various locales hereabouts. At the outset, it vaguely indicates that the hero, a big man in the fashion trade, has unusual sexual drives stemming from a childhood trauma. He insists that his wife also engage in his offbeat practices. His troubled spouse, seeking true love, tries to find surcease in acting, with the true-blue director of her local little theater and in a Lesbian liaison with an old, liberated friend.There is a revelatory climactic twist before the frustrated heroine accedes to her husband's desire that she join him in a session with his free-swinging sex group. But it is hardly a tribute to the woman's intelligence or the occasionally simple-minded script that she takes so long to go her own way finally.Zee Wilson, as the tortured housewife; Gwen Saska, as her girl friend; Ed Moore, as the demanding husband, and Sam Coppola, as the director, behave most of the time as though they were having problems rehearsing for those disjointed scenes in that local little theater play.\"Love has nothing to do with sex,\" one of the anguished principals says at one point. Sadly enough, neither love nor sex, despite a few nude scenes, come across with any real impact in \"Interplay.\"\n\n'Interplay'INTERPLAY, directed by Albert T. Viola; screenplay by Harvey Flaxman; cinematography by Jack Mallck; music by James Burroughs; a Success Films, Ltd., Production; released by Times Film. At neighborhood theaters.

Phil AllenOscar Wilde on the screen is an intriguing possibility, and knowledgeable film esthetes have long considered \"The Decay of Lying\" the most potentially cinematic (after Plato's \"Parmenides\") of all dramatic essays.But \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\" is not only the least of Wilde, it is also the cause of less in others. Albert Lewin's version (1945) was none too good. And Massimo Dellamano's semi-nude, semi-swish \"Dorian Gray,\" which opened yesterday at neighborhood theaters, is so dull as to defy description, though not contempt.Calling itself \"A modern allegory based on the work of Oscar Wilde,\" the film is a little weak on allegory but terrifically strong on modernity — moving in the more than twenty-year decline and fall of Dorian's portrait from the London of, say, 1969, to the London of, say, 1970. Even the portrait is modern—showing a blond Dorian (Helmut Berger) stripped to a bit below the waist, thumbs hooked in the pockets of his hip-hugging jeans, glowering out from, the canvass and looking, well, dangerous.He really isn't so dangerous—or so shocking, or, even in his taste for pretty young men, so amazingly depraved. The film itself, in the manner of much recently imported European pornography, is at once under-sexed and over-decorated—and unless flashing strobe-lights are your idea of sin, you, are unlikely to be titillated.But because \"Dorian Gray\" is so cavalier about its time scheme, it seems not so much strange that Dorian remains young as that everyone else, in the course of a few months, grows old.For compensation (pretty meager) an incredibly world-weary Herbert Lom, as Henry Wotton, from time to time speaks the assorted wisdom of Oscar Wilde. And Helmut Berger on most even remotely formal occasions dresses in velvet suits."
