        "text": "Confession - 1937\n\nConfession - Released Aug 28, 1937. Directed by Joe May\n\nA mother is compromised and loses her daughter when the husband pursues divorce and then simply changes his name and disappears with the child. Kay Francis (Warner's top-paid star of the 1930s) does not even appear on screen for the first 25 minutes, when she does, she is Vera, a professional singer, but Confession doesn't proceed as a typical Kay Francis' melodrama.\n\nBasil Rathbone is on hand, along with frequent Francis co-star Ian Hunter, but neither fellow is there to provide romantic resolutions before the end title, which in itself is out of the ordinary (the emotional resolution at the end is unique in American film because it is provided in an almost completely visual way that is unexpected. Cinemagraphe recommends seeing this instead of reading about it).\n\nThe star of Confession isn't just Kay Francis, it is also the direction by Joe May, who adapted Confession from the 1935 German film Mazurka scene-for-scene. The script is by Hans Rameau (German original), Julius J. Epstein and Margaret P. Levino. Confession starts off as a Warner Bros movie, but it progressively mines its German origins so deeply that the film wouldn't be too out of place on the same shelf with Fritz Lang, among others, and all of that is to the good.\n\nKay Francis, whether on screen in her usual mass of black hair or with blonde coloring does a serious job (and gets out her letter \"r\" clearly) that it makes you wonder why she wasn't handled as well in other Warner productions. She gets to downplay her character as the story gets darker (and crazier, considering the plot), and the result has a bit more wallop than might have seemed possible from an actress just standing still, looking forlorn, and letting the camera inspect her. But she does it.\n\nConfession has time-shifting court room flashback construction that is sophisticated for 1937, using a technique that shows up in later films like A Woman's Face and hundreds of episodes of Perry Mason. In Confession, this allows the story to be told, retold, and retold again until we're finally clear on why Vera, a washed-up and burnt out singer, decides to pick up a pistol, and why the court room full of men, logical about the broken laws and eager to condemn her, eventually end up peering at her surreptitiously like she is Joan of Arc.\n\nAMAZON DVD: Confession - 1937 - Kay Francis\n\nKay Francis\n\nKay Francis 1905-1968\n\nKay Francis Filmography\n\nFour Key Kay Francis Films\n\nOne Way Passage - 1932\n\nTrouble in Paradise - 1932\n\nKay Francis in Mandalay 1934\n\nMandalay 1934 (Longer Review)\n\nI Found Stella Parish - 1935\n\nStranded - 1935\n\nStolen Holiday - 1937\n\nGuilty Hands - 1931\n\nConfession - 1937\n\nWhen the Daltons Rode 1940\n\nKay Francis @ Amazon\n\nAMAZON:The Complete Kay Francis Career Record: All Film, Stage, Radio and Television Appearances\n\nPublisher : McFarland; Reprint edition – 295 Pages\n\nAMAZON: Kay Francis: A Passionate Life and Career\n\nPublished by McFarland – Illustrated edition – 240 Pages\n\nAMAZON: Kay Francis: I Can't Wait to be Forgotten: Her Life on Film and Stage\n\nBearManor Media – 2nd edition – 380 Pages\n\nAMAZON: Warners Archive: Kay Francis - Confession – Director: Joe May\n\nOrigina Page August 2016 | Updated March 2018\n\nWhat's Recent"
