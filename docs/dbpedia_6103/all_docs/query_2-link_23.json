        "text": "The films nominated for top honors at the 87th annual Academy Awards (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. MST, ABC) deal with everything from parenting, maturation and artistry to war, invention and social justice.\n\nThe eight Best Picture nominees — \"Whiplash\" (R), \"American Sniper\" (R), \"Birdman\" (R), \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" (R), \"The Imitation Game\" (PG-13), \"Selma\" (PG-13), \"The Theory of Everything\" (PG-13) and \"Boyhood\" (R) — feature starkly varied themes. And as far as families are concerned, there's much to be aware of in terms of objectionable content.\n\nBut the Best Picture lineup also shares some common underlying themes that reflect the types of films that are impressing critics, audiences and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Some of those themes can also be conversation starters for parents and families.\n\nNominees for Best Picture are oftentimes chosen because they are difficult productions to put together, according to Alissa Wilkinson, chief film critic for Christianity Today.\n\n“Whether or not you like it, it gives you a way to ask, 'Why are these films important?'” Wilkinson said. “Is it the story, the aesthetics? Why do so many people resonate with this film?\"\n\nOne of the most talked about movies of the 2015 award season, and the front-runner to win Best Picture, is \"Boyhood,\" a film 12 years in the making that examines a family over more than a decade.\n\n\"Boyhood\" is resonating with audiences across the country. According to the film review aggregation site RottenTomatoes.com, it is the best reviewed film of 2014 with a \"fresh\" rating of 98 percent.\n\nThis coming-of-age story follows the protagonist, Mason, from age 6 to 18. Mason is the child of divorced parents and is raised by a single mother, played by Patricia Arquette, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The film, directed by Richard Linklater, began production in 2002 and shows the natural aging of the characters. Mason, played by Ellar Coltrane, experiences an at times rocky childhood. The Guardian says the film \"isn’t life as we know it, but life as it really was.\"\n\nAccording to Wilkinson, it's the way the film was captured, not just the plot, that is affecting audiences so poignantly.\n\nOne of the main themes of \"Boyhood,\" Wilkinson said, is the relationship of maturity and time.\n\n\"It's not just the boy you see grow up, but the family, too,\" she said. \"It's really about how time grows us up and our experiences help us mature.\n\n\"The fact that the cast grew up together was a big part of (the film's themes.) They came together, made a movie, and it became a rhythm for their lives. It's quite a feat.\"\n\n\"Boyhood\" portrays an at first disconnected divorced father who gradually becomes more attached, and a single mother who has to learn to let go as her children grow up.\n\nWilkinson said the film teaches that all parents mess up their children \"in their own special ways,\" she said.\n\n\"But there is a lot of what we would call 'grace' there,\" Wilkinson said.\n\nWith the themes of maturation, single parenting and the effects of alcohol abuse comes some objectionable content. “Boyhood” was given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America for language including sexual references and for teen drug and alcohol use. One scene in the film includes a “graphic” conversation about girls, Wilkinson said.\n\nAccording to kids-in-mind.com, \"Boyhood\" features 39 uses of the F-word. Common Sense Media, which gives the film five stars, recommends \"Boyhood\" for ages 15 and older.\n\nJulia Emmanuele of Hollywood.com lamented the rating, writing that the \"MPAA has a history of giving violent films lower ratings than ones that deal with sex or foul language, and it has long been an issue of contention between the organization and filmmakers who don't want to see their films struggle to find an audience due to a high rating.\"\n\nWilkinson pointed out that the definition of “objectionable” content may vary among viewers. For example, some audiences find war to be objectionable, she said. Content such as the language and teenage drug and alcohol consumption in “Boyhood” is more merited when it helps develop the character, Wilkinson said.\n\n“The important thing with families, if they choose to bring their teenager to a film like that, is to talk with them,\" Wilkinson said. \"Ask them, ‘Have you had that experience?’\"\n\nCommon Sense Media recommends several talking points for families, such as the morality of teens experimenting with drugs and the effect of domestic violence and alcoholism.\n\nOne film among the Best Picture nominees that could definitely serve as a discussion-starter for families is \"Selma,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n“Selma,” rated PG-13 for disturbing thematic material including violence, a suggestive moment and brief strong language, is the biopic chronicling Martin Luther King Jr.’s efforts to grant black Americans voting rights. The film highlights the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n“Director Ava DuVernay’s deep-down look at a key point in the civil rights movement ought to fascinate teens who wish they knew more about it,” reads the review from the The Washington Post’s Family Filmgoer.\n\nWilkinson said “Selma” is important to discuss because of its historical roots. Conversations that follow the film could include: “How did that make you feel? How does that match up with our values or what we believe?”\n\n“Use (films) as a springboard for discussing the world,” Wilkinson said. “The worst thing anyone can do (after viewing a film) is think, ‘Well, that’s over.’”\n\nA strong contender in the Best Picture field is Alejandro González Iñárritu’s “Birdman,” starring Michael Keaton. The film is about a \"washed-up\" former superhero actor who \"battles his ego and attempts to recover his family, his career and himself in the days leading up to the opening of a Broadway play,” according to imdb.com.\n\nBut the darker comedy is definitely more for adults, Wilkinson said.\n\n“It’s not a film that any kid or teenager would like,\" she said. \"It’s a film about a very specific splice of the world. If you talk about how it relates to the world, it’s about feeling like you’re past your prime. I can’t see that being a family film.\"\n\n“Birdman” is rated R for language throughout, some sexual content and brief violence.\n\nThough the 2015 nominees vary widely and are difficult to link together, a common theme seems to be the art of telling true stories.\n\n“Why are people so attached to true stories?\" Wilkinson said. \"Four of the films ... ‘American Sniper,’ ‘The Theory of Everything,’ ‘The Imitation Game’ and ‘Selma,’ are all biopics. Why is it that we want to see (films) based on true stories? Why do they make us care more about people?”\n\nWilkinson pointed to another underlying theme: accomplishing great things.\n\n“Even ‘Birdman’ is about people accomplishing things as a group,\" she said. \"‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ is about relationships, ‘The Imitation Game’ is about working together, as opposed to other films about individual genius.\"\n\nAnd it’s indicative of the times, she said.\n\n“We are grappling within our culture right now about politics or celebrities, or whose job it is to make the world a better place,\" Wilkinson said. \"This has been a year we’re really obsessed with this.\"\n\nOne final underlying theme is the recognition of individual genius.\n\n“We are cloaking the superhero thing in a different outfit. How is that of interest to us today? I don’t know the answer,” Wilkinson said. “But we are interested in figuring out how genius works. That’s what the (Academy Awards) are all about — figuring out who is the best at something.”\n\nTwitter: emmiliewhitlock"
