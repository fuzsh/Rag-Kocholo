        "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. Roscoe Orman, who played Gordon on PBS's \"Sesame Street\" for 21 years, will present a one-man production called \"The Confession of Stepin Fetchit\" sponsored by the Black Cultural Center at 7 p.m. Oct. 4 in Stewart Center's Fowler Hall.\n\nDownload photo\n\ncaption below\n\nStepin Fetchit, the stage name for Lincoln Perry, was an African-American comic character whose name has become synonymous with degrading racial stereotypes in Hollywood movies of the first half of the 20th century.\n\nStepin Fetchit etched his place in history as truly the first black movie star, and was the first black performer to be given featured billing in movies with stars such as Will Rogers and Shirley Temple. The character Stepin Fetchit epitomized the black stereotype of a shiftless, lazy servant of low intelligence and was later criticized as being a racist stereotype.\n\n\"The reaction to Perry's legacy made an indelible impact on the changing views of race,\" said BCC director Renee Thomas. \"Because our theme for the semester is 'Fade to Black: African-American Images in Film and Media,' we want to present all aspects of the struggles actors have had to face. This is a sensitive, honest portrayal of a man who ultimately stimulated change in the film industry.\"\n\nThe event is free and open to the public.\n\nA review of Orman's performance at the Smithsonian Institution said: \"The play was alive with warmth, good humor and wit the full house was mesmerized ... The standing ovation was the true testament to the spectacular performance of the versatile Roscoe Orman.\"\n\nOrmans film credits include \"Willie Dynamite,\" \"Follow that Bird,\" \"F/X,\" \"Striking Distance,\" \"New Jersey Drive\" and \"Elmo in Grouchland.\" Television audiences have seen him on \"Sanford and Son,\" \"Kojak,\" \"All My Children,\" \"A Man Called Hawk\" and \"Hard Times on the Planet Earth.\" He has also narrated PBS-TVs \"Langston Hughes: The Dream Keeper\" and \"Hidden Heritage\" for Discovery Channels National Geographic.\n\nEstablished at Purdue in 1969, the Black Cultural Center is nationally recognized and acknowledged by the Association of Black Culture Centers as one of the best centers of its kind. Thomas said the center helps students gain a greater understanding of African-American heritage and supports and enhances cultural diversity on campus and in the community.\n\nWriter: Maggie Morris, (765) 494-2432, maggiemorris@purdue.edu\n\nSource: Renee Thomas, BCC director, (765) 494-3091, rathomas@purdue.edu\n\nPurdue News Service: (765) 494-2096; purduenews@purdue.edu"
