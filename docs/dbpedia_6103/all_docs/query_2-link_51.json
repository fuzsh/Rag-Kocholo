        "text": "Movie music is amazing.\n\nCan we just take a moment to appreciate how beautiful & often under-appreciated film scores are? They create the entire setting and ambience of a movie, sometimes even the entire world or universe; they tell you how you're supposed to feel during a scene AND influence your emotions; they give you subtle hints about the plot/foreshadowing; they tell you a character's story; and they make GREAT study music üòú\n\nGeek out with me as I share 12 of the MOST iconic movie themes (in my opinion) you should know. BUT before that, a bit of a music theory lesson on the use of leitmotifs: short, recurring musical themes that represent a place, a person, an important object, a feeling, an idea, or a situation. In history, leitmotifs have been used in various operas and symphonic poems, in particular Wagner‚Äôs ‚ÄòDer Ring des Nibelungen‚Äô. In the context of modern film, the first instance a musical theme is introduced, the audience associates it with whatever is being presented on the screen. It is then artfully and masterfully sprinkled throughout the film‚Äôs score and help guide the audience. The first on my list is a prime example of using recurring musical themes in film:\n\nJohn Williams is one of the most (if not THE most) legendary and iconic film composers of our time. Just take a look at the rest of this list (I‚Äôll wait for you to come back üòú) and you‚Äôll understand. Williams has been nominated and has won several Academy Awards for ‚ÄúBest Original Score‚Äù throughout the years (many of which are on this list too), including the soundtrack for Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark (nominated, 1981).\n\nSide note: If you haven‚Äôt seen Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous on Netflix yet, I highly recommend it! This theme is another of my favourites - you‚Äôve got the mysterious introductory theme that makes you feel a little uncertain about bringing the prehistoric back to life, but then you‚Äôve got the majestic, wondrous bit that plays as you stare in awe at the brachiosaurus grazing right in front of you. The theme is also featured in ‚ÄòWelcome To Jurassic Park‚Äô, which introduces us to the fanfare Jurassic Park theme, as I like to call it (IYKYK). And that lullaby bit at the beginning always melts my heart.\n\nI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single movie-watcher out there who cannot recognize this ICONIC ICONIC (double iconic because it‚Äôs just THAT iconic) theme. There are so many things about this theme that help create the magical Wizarding World that many have grown to love: Williams‚Äô use of the celesta (those bell-like notes in the beginning), swirling and flurrying string motifs, slightly unconventional intervals and accidentals (sharps, flats, neutrals, etc.), deep brasses, and more!\n\nFor the Potterhead x music geek, I‚Äôve broken down the themes of another track - ‚ÄòHarry‚Äôs Wondrous World‚Äô - on my Instagram post here.\n\nToday I learned that there is a colon between the words Mission: Impossible. I also learned that the ORIGINAL theme for the Mission: Impossible TV series (aired 1966-1973) was composed by Lalo Schifrin and later adapted by Giacchino for the film franchise. In his book Music Composition for Film and Television (Berklee Press, 2011), Schifrin shared that the inspiration behind the 5/4 (time signature - see notation example above) was from the Morse Code for the letters ‚ÄúM‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù: _ _ . . How cool and creative is that?\n\nThe further I go down this list, the more I find that many of these films have attractions at either Disney or Universal Studios, including the newly-opened Avengers Campus in California. Another fun fact from my personal life: my dad uses this theme as his cell ringtone üòÜ The strength and the courage that this theme elicits, especially during that ‚ÄúAvengers, assemble!‚Äù scene when they form a power circle to fight off the Chitauri; still gives me chills~\n\nEven though I‚Äôve heard of it for a LONG time, I‚Äôd never seen Home Alone until only a few years ago. I remember hearing this theme and for some reason it struck feelings of nostalgia and familiarity. Maybe it‚Äôs the simplicity of the theme, or the instrumentation of tiny silver bells reminiscent of Christmas (I mean, it IS a Christmas movie). It‚Äôs not a tune that many would think of when asked about iconic movie themes, but when they remember it, it sticks.\n\nThought I would include at least one iconic movie theme that I, in fact, did not recognize. The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that I have yet to watch, and quite honestly know nothing about (other than mob bosses), so I unfortunately don‚Äôt have much to say about this theme. Other than the fact that it is beautiful but also a bit sad and sentimental, likely depicting a difficult kind of love - did I get it?"
