Hersch\n\nAir World\n\nc/o Casemate Publishers\n\nwww.casematepublishers.com\n\n9781526798275, $28.95, PB, 288pp\n\nhttps://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-dangers-of-automation-in-airliners-jack-j-hersch/1137360600\n\nSynopsis: Automation in aviation can be a lifesaver, expertly guiding a plane and its passengers through stormy weather to a safe landing. Or it can be deadly -- crashing an aircraft and killing all on board in the mistaken belief that it is doing the right thing.\n\nLawrence Sperry invented the autopilot just ten years after the Wright brothers' first flight in 1903. But progress was slow for the next three decades. Then came the end of the Second World War and the jet age. That's when the real trouble began.\n\nAviation automation has been pushed to its limits, with pilots increasingly relying on it. Autopilot, autothrottle, autoland, flight management systems, air data systems, inertial guidance systems. All these systems are only as good as their inputs which, incredibly, can go rogue. Even the automation itself is subject to unpredictable failure. Can automation account for every possible eventuality?\n\nAnd what of the pilots? They began flight training with their hands on the throttle and yoke, and feet on the rudder pedals. Then they reached the pinnacle of their careers (airline pilot) and suddenly they were going hours without touching the controls other than for a few minutes on takeoff and landing. Are their skills eroding? Is their training sufficient to meet the demands of today's planes?\n\nWith the publication of \"The Dangers of Automation in Airliners: Accidents Waiting to Happen\", Jack Hersch delves deeply into these questions. As a fully engaged reader, you will be in the cockpits of the two doomed Boeing 737 MAXs, the Airbus A330 lost over the South Atlantic, and the Bombardier Q400 that stalled over Buffalo. You will discover exactly why a Boeing 777 smacked into a seawall, missing the runway on a beautiful summer morning. And you will watch pilots battling (sometimes winning and sometimes not) against automation run amok.\n\n\"The Dangers of Automation in Airliners: Accidents Waiting to Happen\" also investigates the human factors at work. You will learn why pilots might overlook warnings or ignore cockpit alarms. You will observe automation failing to alert aircrews of what they crucially need to know while fighting to save their planes and their passengers.\n\nIronically, the future of safe air travel and the economics of air line companies depends on automation.\n\nCritique: \"The Dangers of Automation in Airliners: Accidents Waiting to Happen\" is critically important reading for anyone associated with the airline industry whether they are in manufacturing, operations, or simply passengers on the plane. Highly contemporary, timely and offering a cogent and relevant examination of the subject in light of recent and bizzare events surrounding the Boeing 737 MAX from blowing out a door in flight and the loss of wheel on take-off, to missing bolts revealing shoddy manufacturing with potentially lethal consequences, \"The Dangers of Automation in Airliners: Accidents Waiting to Happen\" is especially and unreservedly recommended for personal, professional, community, and college/university library Commercial Aviation and Air Travel collections. Originally published in hardcover by Air World (2020), it should be noted that \"The Dangers of Automation in Airliners: Accidents Waiting to Happen\" is also available in a digital book format (Kindle, $17.99).\n\nEditorial Note: Jack Hersch (https://jackhersch.com) is a journalist and expert in the field of distressed and bankrupt companies. He has served as a public company board member, and has guest-lectured in the business schools of M.I.T., U.S.C., and U.C. Berkeley, among others.

Jordan\n\nPenn State University Press\n\nwww.psupress.org\n\n9780271096926, $99.95, HC, 232pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Rise-Algorithms-YouTube-TikTok-Conquered/dp/0271096926\n\nSynopsis: The meteoric rise of online video is reshaping the competition for human attention. With the publication of \"The Rise of the Algorithms: How YouTube and TikTok Conquered the World\", John M. Jordan argues that this new technology has changed the way we interact with others, our relationships with public institutions, and our very own behaviors and psyches.\n\nIn tracing the origins and evolution of online video, Jordan examines the mechanics (and the ethical stakes) of online video platforms, especially YouTube and TikTok but also others, such as Twitch.\n\nTracing the use of algorithms pioneered by Facebook and Google and so successfully exploited by TikTok's corporate parent, ByteDance, Jordan shows how these platforms now engineer human behavior -- with consequences for culture, politics, and identity.\n\nJordan argues that we are at an inflection point. Until now we have proved, as a society, ill-prepared or unwilling to address such problems as the power of digital platforms, the personal cost of viral celebrity, the invasion of privacy, and the proliferation of disinformation. \"The Rise of the Algorithms\" combines this urgent assessment with a clear-eyed discussion of present challenges and recommendations for reclaiming our online futures.\n\nA valuable resource for understanding the transformations that have been and will be brought by YouTube, TikTok, and similar platforms, Jordan's timely study is a vital work for anyone who uses the internet and especially for policy makers, technologists, communication and media specialists, and researchers who have a direct hand in determining the future of our online world.\n\nCritique: Enhanced for the reader's benefit with the inclusion of an informative Introduction and Conclusion, twelve pages of Notes, a thirty-two page Bibliography, and a three page Index, \"The Rise of the Algorithms: How YouTube and TikTok Conquered the World\" is a timely and high value contribution to our current national dialogue with respect to how social media is impacting individuals and society as a whole. Articulate, insightful, thought-provoking, exceptionally well written, organized and presented, \"The Rise of the Algorithms\" is unreservedly recommended as a prized pick for personal, professional, community, and college/university library Advanced Communications Technology and Social Media collections and supplemental Communications/Media Studies curriculum lists. It should be noted for students, academia, political activists, governmental policy makers, corporate executives, and non-specialist general readers with an interest in the subject that \"The Rise of the Algorithms\" is also readily available from the Penn State University Press in a paperback edition (9780271096933, $24.95) and in a digital book format (Kindle, $19.99).\n\nEditorial Note: John M. Jordan directs the professional doctoral program at the Syracuse University School of Information Studies. In addition to previously teaching at Harvard and Penn State, he also spent ten years in industry, including roles as Director of Internet Research at the Ernst & Young Center for Business Innovation and a principal in the Office of the Chief Technologist at Capgemini. He is also the author of seven books, including Robots and 3D Printing.\n\nAble Greenspan\n\nReviewer\n\nDiane Donovan's Bookshelf\n\nDebunking Teenagers\n\nDaphne Adler\n\nIndependently Published\n\nwww.debunkingteenagers.com\n\n9798857322079, $19.99\n\nDebunking Teenagers: 200 Research-Based Parenting Strategies To Help Your Adolescent Successfully Navigate The \"Tempteen\" Years addresses the special challenges of parenting teens. These are created by a combination of struggles for maturity, social influences, and a parent's conundrums over navigating world influences and messages to help a teen grow.\n\nMore than a pat survey of such influences, Debunking Teenagers reveals the nuts and bolts of not only social and political perceptions and how these are formed and guided, but the kinds of approaches to parenting that encourage dialogue over conflict.\n\nExamples of such approaches include discussions of dominant male roles in victimization processes, how to identify behavioral problems early on and how to get appropriate help, and monitoring social and online activities for early warning signs of issues.\n\nAt each step of the way, Adler includes instructions for \"digging deeper\" into underlying issues, offering take-aways that address character and promote improvements in physical appearance and mental health. Of particular strength and note are the insights on how parents can utilize controversy, conflict, and alternative tools to foster and further more effective communications with teens.\n\nThese guidelines and examples will prove invaluable; especially to parents who receive plenty of idealistic admonitions, but little practical advice that hones in on the actual process of fostering better relationships. The surveys of what doesn't work (and why) are just as important as insights about what does work paired with alternative choices to traditional thinking about as common an issue as the family dinner.\n\nAn added bonus is the wealth of footnoted references that point the way to research-based information. These serve as both support for Adler's contentions and tools for additional reading, should parents want to delve into the source materials supporting her contentions.\n\nThe result will be considered, by many parents, to be not just a guideline, but a godsend.\n\nDebunking Teenagers should not only be included in libraries strong in parenting guides, but should ideally be made a key part of any parenting discussion group and given to adults working with teens to help foster better ways of introducing teens to adulthood.\n\nWildcat\n\nJeffrey Dunn\n\nIzzard Ink Publishing\n\nhttps://izzardink.com/wildcat\n\n9781642280975, $17.95 Paperback/$9.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Wildcat-Jeffrey-Dunn/dp/1642280976\n\nWildcat: An Appalachian Romance is a literary story of love and loss set against the backdrop of the Rust Belt, where a retired teacher returns to his hometown with a vision of renovating the Hotel Wildcat. His journey home reveals transformations he'd never expected, calling into question the possibility of a mine-driven community entering the new age world, carrying its baggage of explosions, anguish, and company town pain with it.\n\nJust as Wildcat harbors its own ghosts of the past, so the catastrophic changes that rocked the narrator's world in his senior year return to haunt him as he and the community try to escape the darkness of historical precedent to enter a new era against all odds and influences.\n\nJeffrey Dunn creates a compelling narrative as seen through the eyes of a character that discovers the pull of the past tugs on not just memories, but heartstrings.\n\nLured back by the town's magical changes and promise, the teacher also finds himself in a transformative romance that takes past experience and gives it a new twist while injecting some of the darkness of those experiences into his new life.\n\nAs he surveys choices and loves of the past, motivating factors for escape come into play to slowly reveal why he left in the first place - and why he returned:\n\n\"It was quiet, spooky quiet, so quiet, in fact, that after the moving truck drove away, it felt like a cemetery, and then I thought that all post - World War II housing plans must be cemeteries, too. It wasn't a pleasant thought, this belief that I was born and still lived in a cemetery. I knew right then and there that I needed to find a way out.\"\n\nJeffrey Dunn builds the town's past and present carefully, piece by piece, as events swerve from mills and dams to failures in human endeavors that affect the protagonist and everyone around him. History is woven into these events with such an adept touch that readers absorb this atmosphere with a seamless interplay of people and perceptions. These lend nicely to character reactions to their world's pain and promises.\n\nDunn's novel will be perfect for readers seeking stories about community transformation processes, the seepage of past events into present-day attempts to change, and the Appalachian environment.\n\nLibraries will want to recommend this novel to anyone seeking a story set in the Rust Belt where dreams and reality coalesce to bring new realizations about the past, present, and possible futures.\n\nFeral Maril and Her Little Brother Carol\n\nLeslie Tall Manning\n\nwww.leslietallmanning.com\n\nIndependently Published\n\n9780960017775, $14.99 Paperback/$4.99 ebook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/stores/Leslie-Tall-Manning/author/B00VRZ3FOK?ref\n\nIn Feral Maril and Her Little Brother Carol, Marilyn has her hands full. Her mother is in prison, leaving her to shuffle through the foster system with younger, mentally challenged brother Carol in tow. Vague childhood memories of someone called the Tan Man lead her to dream that finding him will result in a better place, but before she can do so, her ex-con father shows up and is granted custody.\n\nNow Marilyn faces a dangerous predator bent on getting rid of Carol so he can have her to himself.\n\nAs fraught with danger and heartache as her childhood and adolescence are, Marilyn harbors the survival traits of being a stubborn, positive, creative thinker. The plan she hatches could save them both.\n\nMarilyn's journey through the South in search of her brother and a place to call home is replete with warmth and insights alongside a special observational sense of environment which marks Marilyn's ability to assess people and places alike:\n\n\"Looking at my surroundings, I questioned where the mini-bus picked him up, since it didn't seem like there'd be a safe place to stand with all the sticker bushes and smell of fox pee, and water moccasins that could mosey up from one of the nearby tributaries.\"\n\nReaders don't just follow Marilyn's journey. They come to love her, cheering for her efforts and feeling sorrow when new challenges arise to further complicate her young life.\n\nLeslie Tall Manning's story is grimly realistic in its portrait of childhood abuse and adversity. This may serve as a trigger for readers who harbor the scars of trauma from their own lives. Her ability to delve into Marilyn's influences and explore how her character emerges intact from all these confrontations creates a gripping story that is hard to predict, put down, or pigeonhole.\n\nManning presents Marilyn as not a young hero, but a person struggling with emerging strengths and character flaws that influence her choices and actions. Revelations may be as overt and hard-hitting as reflections on freedom and independence, or as subtle as Tan Man's real meaning, and how different relationships formed between strangers become guideposts in their lives.\n\nThe result is especially recommended for book clubs and libraries seeking stories about coming-of-age experiences which incorporate threads of growth (from physical to attitude adjustments) into their sagas in a rich, powerful manner that will appeal to mature teens to adults.\n\nBecoming Modigliani\n\nHenri Colt M.D.\n\nRake Press\n\n9781959185000, $24.99 (Paperback), $14.99 (eBook), $ 27.99 (Hardcover)\n\nBecoming Modigliani comes from a physician and traveler who largely writes medical texts; but here he tackles the life and medical challenges of Jewish-Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, who died at age thirty-five of tuberculosis meningitis.\n\nThe combination of medical, cultural, and artistic inquiry cannot be beat; especially coming from a doctor with credentials in medicine. This enhances the survey of art, adding the effect of STIs, alcoholism, war, and health decline on psychological and artistic endeavors.\n\nReaders might anticipate that prior familiarity with Modigliani, his world of the early 1900s art community in Europe, and medical challenges of the times would be necessary. Not so. Dr. Colt provides background in all these areas while paving the way for readers to discover the underlying influences and impacts of disease on achievement, psyche, and art.\n\nNumerous footnoted references to research are testimony to the avidly studious nature of this story, which surveys everything from Modigliani's muses, love, and temperament to the changing social and political world around him. Of special interest are passages that link Modigliani's experiences and perceptions to the greater world and the medical and health issues that permeated both:\n\n\"If we are to believe some of the anecdotes about Modigliani, he was increasingly prone to rowdiness, public displays of anger, refusals to seek help and apparent drunkenness. He was prone to mood swings even as a child, and may have been highly sensitive or vulnerable to deep emotions. Unknowingly, he may have turned to mind-altering substances as a form of self-medication and only later began to suffer from their adverse consequences. Modern scientists debate the adverse effects of alcohol and cannabis on mental health and personality, including, for example, the potential for cannabis to increase the risk of early psychosis, especially if used by adolescents and young adults.\"\n\nAlso especially notable are passages which review and consider Modigliani as representative of his times and the medical issues which permeated them. This is why art lovers, history buffs, scholars, and healthcare and social sciences readers alike will find much to appreciate in this biography. It links history, art, and medicine in an unusual manner to enlighten readers about the roots of inspiration, artistic creation, and life.\n\nThe process of artistic creation is documented in a precise, analytical manner that takes the physician's eye for diagnosis and interpretation to new levels, always rooting these inspections firmly in Modi's world and art:\n\n\"In some paintings, the eyes are a soft, light blue-gray. In others, only one eye is darkened. \"With one eye you look out at the world,\" Modi told Leopold Survage in 1918, \"with the other you look in at yourself.\" We can only wonder whether Modi was fully aware of the negative turns his life could take as an adult, even as he became an increasingly accomplished visual artist.\"\n\nArt and medical libraries alike will find this journey unique and important, and will want to choose Becoming Modigliani for not only collections rich in art biographies and explorations, but for reading groups interested in the intersection and impact of health on artistic ambition.\n\nBlood and Verse\n\nChris McAuley and Jeff Oliver\n\nCosby Media Productions\n\nwww.cosbymediaproductions.com\n\n9798888962244, $19.99 Paperback/$5.99 eBook\n\nhttps://cosbymediaproductions.com/blood-and-verse\n\nBlood and Verse provides Dracula fans, dark poetry followers, and history buffs with a re-envisioning of the Dracula mythos and its aftermath that coalesces powerful poetry with equally powerful imagery.\n\nThe intersection of the fictional classic, nonfiction (elements of such added for value and expansive understanding), and rich visuals and word images creates a deeper plunge into the mythology and figures of Stoker's original, translating them to new depths of realization and experience for modern readers.\n\nFans of horror and gothic literature may find the format of this exploration to be unusual - but any challenge experienced in the reading is worth the effort of absorbing literary devices that may lay outside the usual milieu of the horror genre enthusiast. Prose and poetry marry as the reflections of Dr. Abraham Van Helsing's journal intersect with searches for truth.\n\nThe verse itself, rhyming and pointed, assumes a dark countenance of observation married with reflective experience to bring readers intimately into the quandaries and puzzles the investigator faces:\n\n\"This entry will be much different than the ones I've quilled before.\n\nThe nurses restrained him once more.\n\nI'm now going to document his habits.\n\nHe's sleeping now and has a disgruntled snore.\n\nIt's ear-piercingly loud.\n\nIt has a very high-pitched sound.\"\n\nEven more stark and startling are passages which capture the psychological underpinnings of legend and psychological revelation:\n\n\"Dracula consumed blood for corruption.\n\nBlood selfishly served his needs.\n\nHe created the monster inside of him when he bowed to the darkest of Kings.\n\nHe opened the gates when he drank from that skull.\n\nHe fell violently to his knees.\n\nIn exchange for his soul, he died for revenge.\n\nThen received everything he could ever need.\"\n\nThe story's progression unfolds a myriad blend of insights that both adds to and increases the horror component as readers follow in the footsteps of an investigation into Dracula that even Stoker may not have envisioned.\n\nThe result is both literary and entertaining: a bloody, thought-provoking marriage of form, history, legend, and literary device that will be especially welcomed by libraries seeking additions to horror collections that operate outside the usual box of terror.\n\nBroken (Book 1 of the Young Hellions Series)\n\nBraxton A. Cosby\n\nCosby Media Productions\n\nwww.cosbymediaproductions.com\n\n9798885262743, $24.99 Hardcover/$16.99 Paperback/$3.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Broken-The-Young-Hellions-Series/dp/B0CQMQZB3F\n\nBroken is set in 2035. Humanity has largely succeeded in pulverizing itself (and all life on the planet) out of existence. This is the aftermath, where Keesa Donovan and her younger brother Kiran, having lost everything, eke out their lives in a slave pod in Georgia.\n\nThe usual teen angst about coming-of-age issues (including romance) is tempered by an equally confusing confrontation with latent ESP abilities and visions of the future. These lead Kessa on a quest to find her new place in this damaged world.\n\nAt this point, it should be noted that Broken introduces the Young Hellions series. Keesa's powerful struggles over her identity and place coincide with her bid for freedom as discovery after discovery places her at odds with her environment, as well as her destiny:\n\n\"'Unless you haven't been paying attention, I don't really care about my life,' I shout.\n\n'And that's what makes you so special, Keesa, doesn't it?' Cress asks as he walks toward me. I freeze at his words. 'At least, that's what you think. But you see, I know that you don't really believe that. I know you'd rather live than die. Why else would you care so much about your family?'\"\n\nThe vivid immediacy of this future world, its devastating legacy and struggles for revitalization and survival, and Keesa's growing self-empowerment as a young Black woman destined for greater things than slavery and subjugation makes for a thoroughly engrossing story. The saga is powered by ambition and destiny, and teen readers of fantasy and sci-fi will find this thought-provokingly revealing.\n\nThe aftermath of the world-wide nuclear war also receives intriguing social analysis, here, elevating the story above and beyond those which focus on survival or political efforts alone.\n\nThe interpersonal relationships Keesa develops in the course of her quest for answers add further deep dimensions of influence into her story:\n\n\"You be the fire! Tell them to hold on just a little longer. They have to. You have to! Because if no one else does, if no one else ever told you so, I believe in you.\"\n\nThe resulting story of nuclear war survivors, leadership, and ideological and physical struggles takes a giant step away from many competing genre reads, leading followers far from the mundane and into arenas of resistance, resilience, and unity.\n\nLibraries seeking post-apocalyptic fiction that operates as strongly on a level of social and psychological inquiry as it does in the physical elements of survival and discovery will find Broken a compelling collection addition.\n\nInfinity 7: War of Gods\n\nBraxton A. Cosby and Keshawn Dodds\n\nCosby Media Productions\n\nwww.cosbymediaproductions.com\n\n9798888962169, $22.99 Hardcover/$16.99 Paperback/$4.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Infinity-Gods-Dark-Spores-Novel/dp/B0CNRVM397\n\nInfinity 7: War of Gods feels like it opens midway into the action (\"I accept your surrender,\" the towering, green mountain humanoid said as the crunching sound of cervical vertebrae waned inside the vice grip of his right gloved hand.\"), but its opening lines merely serve to capture reader attention as its following paragraphs reveal the setting and lead-up to this defeat.\n\nIt also should be noted, at this point, that Infinity 7: War of Gods is the follow-up to Infinity 7: Gods Among Men and marks the conclusion of an 18-book (and 5-comic Dark Spores) series of stories, and will best be imbibed by prior fans of the rich world Braxton A. Cosby and Keshawn Dodds, along with four other authors, have created in this saga, for both appreciation of past events and maximum interest in their ultimate outcome.\n\nWhile newcomers to the series can slip into its allure with little understanding of the past, it's the avid follower that will embrace the return of characters from previous books, who face the concluding results of their experiences in an unpredictably alluring manner.\n\nFrom a powerful army of committed men facing their greatest challenge in the Space Pirate Stratus to the countenance and objectives of those who might seem as gods to cultures not as advanced in technology or the finer art of fighting, Infinity 7 creates dialogues and clashes that are thoroughly engrossing:\n\n\"You are no god,\" a random voice boomed from the crowd.\n\nStratus addressed the crowd. \"Am I not? Do gods not possess the power to both give and take life? After what I've done to your pathetic excuse of an army,\" Stratus paused as a sinister smirk spread across his jaw, \"am I not now among the conversation of those you both fear and idolize?\"\n\n\"We had a deal,\" another voice erupted.\"\n\nFlashbacks (such as one from five years prior in Chicago, Illinois) fill in many blanks for newcomers as the events progress, moving from off-planet to Earthly realms as a diverse cast of characters participate in or confront dreams, conflicts, drugs, and Conglomerate makeup and special interests.\n\nThe main character, Paladin (shades of Western heroism!) draws together many of these seemingly disparate threads of action and interest as he fulfills his role as leader of the Capes while mourning his lost love and the tattered remains of those he deems family.\n\nThere is the classic good versus evil scenario, with Super-Normals confronting the heroes; there are bigger picture intentions about controlling and enslaving not one world, but the universe; and action-packed, vivid scenes draw these interests together in a tangled web of clashing objectives and visions of power and future control.\n\nCosby and Dodds cultivate a unique form of action that juxtaposes bigger-picture thinking with individual strengths, questions, and objectives. These drive the plot's evolving scenes, creating satisfyingly unpredictable twists and turns that add depth and entertainment value to a story that will attract fans of superhero sci-fi and urban fantasy alike.\n\nWhile Paladin's objectives sometimes blur the boundaries between individual action and responsibility and group participation, his struggles remain realistic, sometimes flawed, and always engrossing.\n\nLibraries looking for vivid superhero action and scenarios which shift with breathtaking regularity, especially those already in possession of prior Cosby and Dodds productions, will welcome the concluding force that is Infinity 7: War of Gods.\n\nEarth's Last Starfleet (Book 2 of The Third Age Saga)\n\nDaniel Peyton\n\nCosby Media Productions\n\nwww.cosbymediaproductions.com\n\n9798885262637, $17.99 Paperback/$2.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Earths-Last-Starfleet-Third-Saga/dp/B0BSJLL3MB\n\nIn Earth's Last Starfleet, Earth's Last Starship Earth (Book 2 of The Third Age Saga), the people of Earth survived an invading force of aliens solely protected by the spacecraft Orlando. As peace descends upon the world and humanity relaxes, hero adventurer Captain Brian Shepard finds that his life has returned to relative normal. And he doesn't like it.\n\nIt's time for new adventures and impossible wins. Be careful what you wish for. Adversity arrives in the form of Ko, the former ruler of the Soreth before the fall of Soreth Prime, whose ambition and power threatens not just humanity, but the entire universe.\n\nPerfect. This is just the kind of challenge Brian likes.\n\nThe Earth Space Navy has grown since his first battles. He's no longer alone with the crew of the Orlando, assuming the role of Commander over the fleet and learning how to navigate not only space and time to confront Ko's threat and the Fanglerian homeworld, but how to field the power and purposes of an entire fleet of battleships.\n\nDaniel Peyton's story injects a wry sense of underlying humor to Brian's interactions with his crew and his considerations of how he might change the fate of humanity and the universe at large:\n\n\"Brian looked back at his first officer. The enemy fleet. Do we have any idea if they're following us?\" Braxton smiled. \"No, sir. All the ships in our fleet are equipped with advanced sensor dampening devices. While at full tactical alert, the device is automatic. Once we entered hyperlight, they could not follow us. Good, we need some peace right about now.\"\n\nThe technology of the Sorenth before their fall, the puzzle of stopping an impossible weapon that has no 'off' button, and the action-packed scenes mark a military sci-fi story in which technology and problem-solving are as vivid as the action-packed descriptions of war:\n\n\"Tactical yelled, \"They're firing!\" Weapons poured out from the Tol'konian ships and blazed across the shields of the Fengler/Human fleet. Tactical called out, \"Shields are holding. They're preparing to fire again.\" \"Fire all weapons!\" Braxton ordered. They returned fire with torpedoes and energy weapons. One of the smaller Tol'kon cruisers exploded. Then the enemy fired, and the USS Argentina split in half.\"\n\nAs Earth's last Starfleet faces a battle for survival and Brian finds his taste for adventure tempered by his absence from family, friends, and a peaceful life, forces come together to pose greater challenges, such as an addiction to power that may prove unshakeable even in times of peace.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking a military sci-fi story replete with action juxtaposed with thought-provoking scenarios of power struggles and ultimate impacts on the psyches and ambitions of leaders and followers alike will find Earth's Last Starfleet a standout, offering more depth than most military sci-fi creations.\n\nLegacy of Dragonwand Book VI\n\nDaniel Peyton\n\nCosby Media Productions\n\nwww.cosbymediaproductions.com\n\n9798888962220, $17.99 Paperback/$4.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Legacy-Dragowand-Book-Dragonwand-Trilogy/dp/B0CPJXG19H\n\nLegacy of Dragonwand Book VI is a sword-and-sorcery fantasy that joins the Dragonwand series in the capital city of Thendor. Here, The Dark Lady and Baron Thorn pose equal yet disparate perils to the city. These can only be confronted (and possibly resolved) by human/Lord Dragon Markus, who may be the only force capable of protecting the land.\n\nThis shapeshifting hero confronts not only evil, but the legacy of his efforts and ambitions as Thendor wavers between vying forces which are bent on control and injecting misery into hearts by tainting them with dark, corrupted magic.\n\nA desperate search for and control of the Heart of Darkness, and a uncommon association between Lord Dragon and his newly discovered great-great grandfather Steffen, places the Dragonwand Core at the heart of both darkness and light. Here, Markus confronts Dragon-creating forces, not one but two disparate forms of evil, and a legacy that tests his ability to be a hero (even though, as a boy Dragon, he is ill equipped to face adversary Korvarsk in battle).\n\nAs Steffen, Korvarsk, and Markus find their lives entwined on a far more complex playing field than the usual good-versus-evil confrontation, embracing personal elements of unexpected connections, love, and revelations, young adult and adult fantasy readers alike will fall under its spell. The characterization, setting, and action are huge draws that are well-done and captivating.\n\nLibraries looking at sword-and-sorcery series additions will be especially pleased to note that Legacy of Dragonwand Book VI operates as both a satisfying adjunct to its predecessors and a very accessible stand-alone adventure that leaves the door wide open for more books in the series.\n\nIt's Murder, You Betcha\n\nJeanne Cooney\n\nNorth Star Press of St. Cloud\n\nwww.northstarpress.com\n\n9781682011485, $20.00, PB, 360pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Its-Murder-You-Betcha-Mystery/dp/1682011488\n\nCozy mystery readers who enjoy a special sense of community and place in their stories will welcome It's Murder, You Betcha, which comes steeped in the culture of the Minnesotan farming town of Hallock.\n\nThis second book in the 'It's Murder' series features an ice fishing expedition gone awry when Doris and her sister uncover not fish, but a body. The elderly woman they've treated to the outing is understandably upset, and so Doris becomes involved in the investigation to quell her agitation, only to find that a virtual blizzard of lies, deception, and secrets prove ever more puzzling and involving as her probe progresses.\n\nJeanne Cooney takes the time to fully present the countenances, relationships, and connections that keep Doris and her associates involved in not only the mystery, but each other and their community:\n\n\"The sun reflected off the snow and her wire-rimmed glasses. With her impish expression and whisps of white hair sticking out every which way from beneath her pink knit hat, Rose, who was short and getting shorter all the time, reminded me of a pixie. Or perhaps a leprechaun, considering she had immigrated from Ireland as a child. How she and her family ever ended up settling in the land of Swede and Norwegian Lutherans, I had no clue. Then, she became my mother's best friend and, later, a second mother to Grace and me.\"\n\nFrom relationships with sisters and friends to thought-provoking revelations about town matters and personalities, Cooney's descriptions often inject a sense of humor into the story even as they deliver a side dish of insights and possibilities that mystery fans will find revealing:\n\n\"'But he died, Grace. He just got murdered. Jeez, sometimes you're...' I let my words fade. What was the point of needling Grace for being... Grace? 'Anyhow,' I tried again, 'Dickerson said that Dot's now too grief stricken to think about anything, including money.' My sister laughed so hard that she almost fell off her chair.\"\n\nHumor abounds even in succinct phrases (\"To take stock of the entire street, Grace rotated her head in Exorcist fashion.\"), keeping readers absorbed and involved as the story reveals a host of possibilities, confrontations, and surprises.\n\nFueled by Minnesotan culture and atmosphere and community relationships which are put to the brink of breaking over a murder, It's Murder, You Betcha's special brand of down-home atmosphere, humor, and entanglements makes it a winning choice. It's especially recommended for libraries seeking to expand cozy mystery collections with a strong regional American community focus, and for newcomers and prior readers of Doris and her sister Grace.\n\nYou Only Go Extinct Once\n\nBob Lorentson\n\nwww.boblorentson.com\n\nIndependently Published\n\n9798218262037, $10.99 Paperback/$4.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/YOU-ONLY-EXTINCT-ONCE-Anthropocene/dp/B0CM3YFPCX\n\nYou Only Go Extinct Once: Stuck in the Anthropocene with the Pleistocene Blues Again comes from an environmental scientist who has an especially engaging form of delivery for scientific facts and history, served up with a wicked sense of humor, as is evident in a subtitle which bows to a Bob Dylan song.\n\nAnother clue to the readability and fun of this book lies in chapter headings which are anything but scientifically staid (\"One Squid to Rule Us All,\" \"In Vegetables We Trust. Or Do We?,\" and \"Can Goat Yoga Save the World?\").\n\nSections divided into 'Plants and Animals' and 'The Humans' make for logical paths of inquiry as fifty essays explore the Anthropocene and human interactions with nature. It exposes many thought-provoking theories and contentions that will especially appeal to any reader who might have thought science and natural history to be dull topics. From the foreword:\n\n\"My theory is this: Plants and animals mind their own business, and when threatened, will fight with all the resources at their disposal to remove the threat. Humans mind everyone else's business, and when threatened, will dispose of all the resources they have and increase the threat.\"\n\nThe notably lively close look at what constitutes human beings and both separates them from and connects them to the animal world makes for a survey that grasps the fundamentals of scientific inquiry and entertainment value alike. This book should attract readers as much for its humor as for its interesting science, nature, and timely environmental themes.\n\nYou Only Go Extinct Once even delves into the moral and ethical boundaries of a scientific investigation of the natural world, offering many topics suitable for classroom and book reading group debate as it romps through studies, biases, lies and truths, and often ends chapters with hilarity (From \"The Evolution of Lying\": \"I'm sorry, but I have to end this essay prematurely as my pants just caught on fire.\")\n\nThe result is a special invitation to appreciate the investigations, questions, answers, and quandaries revolving around animal and human lives, environments, and choices and actions.\n\nLibraries, science teachers, and all ages who might ordinarily eschew the dryness of scientific discourses and education will be drawn to this essay collection. It will reach into a wide audience, from teens and teachers to general-interest readers looking for a bit of fun to spice up their scientific education.\n\nIn Extremis\n\nMatt Duggan\n\nwww.mattduggan.com\n\nManVsFilm\n\n9781733794336, $24.99\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Extremis-Rosy-Dream-Matt-Duggan/dp/1733794336\n\nIn Extremis provides the second novel in the literary/historical The Rosy Dream series. The tension emerges from the first few paragraphs as, in short order, first-person narrator Jack faces \"The collision of random events: murder, seizure, fire\" in California. He finds himself in an ambulance, surrounded by fire. And that's just the opening salvo of a journey that carries Jack and his followers through a convergence of events that keep him connected to both the film industry and the ironies of life.\n\nMatt Duggan creates an absorbing interplay of characters and conflicts in this second installment of the ongoing mishaps and revelations of Jack Darmody.\n\nFrom friend Chris's death, which affects EMT Evan and brings Jack back to his own struggles with mortality twelve years prior upon his good friend Billy Barber's murder, to money-making endeavors, secret probations, and Jack's association with Dr. Jan Thomason ('Doc'), Duggan creates a vivid interplay between characters and shifting jobs and experiences:\n\n\"Over the years, all my raven talk opened Doc up. He had his own leviathan chained to the sea floor. But as Nietzsche said, 'He who fights with monsters should be careful, lest he become one himself.' Doc's pain seared itself into his heart. He blinded himself to it. It drove his intense work ethic. His patents, his books, his career. I always joked that he was the real Ubermensch, the Superman. I hadn't added any value to society, but here was Doc.\"\n\nAs a music video project introduces new possibilities for redemption, success, and revised truths, Jack faces the possibility of rejuvenation after a long series of confrontations with self and others.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking a feel of Kerouac's classic 'On the Road', but in a more contemporary romp through California culture, its arts community, and the endeavors of a young man struggling with his potential for success and failure, will find In Extremis builds upon the previous story, but requires no prior familiarity in order to prove a stand-alone winner.\n\nSteeped in California culture and a coming-of-age journey, In Extremis offers a vivid portrait of change that will delight all ages.\n\nWalk the Earth as Brothers\n\nHenry Rozycki\n\nwww.henryrozycki.com\n\nAddison and Highsmith\n\nc/o Histria Books\n\nwww.histriabooks.com\n\n9781592113866, $29.99 Hardcover/$9.99 eBook\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/henryrozyckiwrites\n\nWalk the Earth as Brothers is a novel about two Jewish brothers in Warsaw who, in 1939, face a changing world that tears them apart, leading them on very different paths to survival.\n\nIan winds up in Paris, where he falls in love but again finds himself fleeing close connections when his life is threatened, sending him away from this woman's embrace and mystery to seeming safety in Casablanca.\n\nBrother Daniel, who winds up in the Siberian Gulag, also finds unexpected romance under adverse conditions and threats to his life. But he, too, faces a similar difficult choice in whether to leave his love for freedom and reunion, or live the rest of his days imprisoned.\n\nThe history and fate which affects these two brothers' lives, relationships, and choices are firmly rooted in reality, but the contrasts and similarities between their individual adversity and survival tactics are vividly portrayed with all the passion and fire of fiction.\n\nEach woman teaches her young man new things about the world and how to react to it, as Alicia does for Ian when she poses astute questions about his future:\n\n\"You can't be a piece of driftwood anymore, or you will be smashed into a million pieces by the tidal wave that is our world right now.\"\n\nIan can't quite make out this bigger picture that he's supposed to be part of, but he learns the hard way as new encounters, friendships, and revelations buffet his world to change his experience and his perception of his place in it:\n\n\"'What have you been doing?' Ian asked 'Jerzy.' He rarely went out with them. In his little kit bag, he kept a Bible, and he spent hours silently reading it now. Conversations were rare. Ian was content to give him room, assuming that after running, hiding, changing identities and God knows what else, he now had time to rest, recuperate, and to seek solace from that book, that it was not all random, that whatever one chose to do did have impact on what happened next. Ian was trying to do the same and failing. He wished he'd not grown up so fiercely secular, so he could find the answers he sought in 'Jerzy's' book. Or be like Christophe, asking no questions. Either one would definitely make it easier.\"\n\nWhile Walk the Earth as Brothers will prove especially attractive to readers of Jewish history and experience, it would be a shame to limit its audience to Jewish audiences alone. The cultural and political revelations which come to light in the course of each brother's education and progression are worthy of book club and reading group debate - particularly for those interested in World War II scenarios which depart from the usual focuses on survival tactics alone.\n\nLibraries seeking novels about growth, family relationships, transformative life encounters, and the intersection of personal and political struggle will find Walk the Earth as Brothers invigorating and provocative, lending well to discussion and debates about Jewish culture and World War II's different impacts.\n\nCentering Pura Vida\n\nLily E. Espinoza\n\nAlive Book Publishing\n\nwww.alivebookpublishing.com\n\n9781631322303, $19.95, PB, 184pp\n\nhttps://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/centering-pura-vida-lily-e-espinoza/1145395515\n\nMany books advocate for placing people of color in positions of power, but Centering Pura Vida comes with a difference: it focuses on what these circumstances actually look like, presenting them in the voices of real-world participants.\n\nStudents of color relate their encounters with programs promoting positions of leadership, authority, and inclusion. These case studies illustrate inclusion theories in action, outline problems and solutions, and contrast disparate diversity support programs in colleges.\n\nLily E. Espinoza was only twenty when she stumbled upon her dream job in a job announcement:\n\n\"...to serve as a Vice President of Institutional Effectiveness at a community college, and then to become a college president. That moment felt magical and exciting, as if sirens had sounded off: TARGET AQUIRED! I saw my future in the crosshairs. I had found what I was meant to do with my life! I knew instantly that I wanted to dedicate myself to working at the community college for my career. I wanted to be someone who made sure that students did not fall through the cracks. I wanted to be that person who makes sure institutional resources were utilized directly on student success efforts. That programs, services, funding, and facilities were geared toward students first.\"\n\nAs she honed her dream and turned it into her daily reality, she also faced the candid realities of working in higher education, confronting the challenges of ideals versus obstacles to enacting them, to improve student lives.\n\nThe phrase \"pura vida\" is prevalent in modern-day Costa Rica. It translates to embracing a simple or pure life. 20 years of Espinoza's experience is represented by this phrase and transmitted by book title, intention, and the illustrations she provides readers who follow in her life goals and consider higher education's transformational opportunities.\n\nReaders expecting a biographical format alone may be surprised by the book's analytical side, which tackles subjects ranging from organizational structure to educational philosophy as Espinoza constructs diversity programs and fosters student awareness and empowerment.\n\nPhilosophy, psychology, and organizational theory mingle in a manner that outlines higher education structures, barriers, and opportunities in a way that even readers not involved in educational systems can readily understand.\n\nAs she outlines the ideals and realities of the transformation process, readers will gain much knowledge not just about systems and their revision, but the kinds of ideals and actions that make \"pura vida\" an active participatory possibility (under the right guidance).\n\nLibraries and readers already inundated with books about higher education goals will find many differences in Centering Pura Vida. The title was purposely created to attract attention beyond higher education circles alone, and promises thought-provoking revelations and much fodder for book club and business management discussion groups.\n\nThat's why it should be chosen as a mainstay of any collection devoted to considering social change processes, how they look and feel in the real world, and how to make inclusion a living incarnation rather than an idealistic theory.\n\nVictory in Europe\n\nRobert Kofman\n\nhttps://www.robertkofman.com\n\nLion Valley Publishing\n\n9781732991040, $17.95 Paperback/$5.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Victory-Europe-Novel-World-War-ebook/dp/B0CS12G6PZ\n\nFans of Robert Kofman's World War II historical novel Ike's Journey will appreciate the ongoing saga continued in Victory in Europe, which focuses on Commander Ike Eisenhower's quandaries, decision-making challenges, and headaches. He oversees not only strategies for the course of military engagements, but the head-butting antics of generals Montgomery and Patton, who represent vastly different expertise and opinions of how the war should be fought.\n\nBecause the novel picks up neatly where Ike's Journey stopped, Victory in Europe is especially recommended for prior readers, who will appreciate the evolutionary nature of progressive events which continue to challenge President Eisenhower's command and leadership concepts.\n\nAs in his previous story, Kofman excels in creating a satisfying contrast between military and political duties and objectives. His ability to personalize these decisions lends an ease and understanding to historical events that highlights the drama with action and psychological insights, whether Eisenhower is tackling generals or promoting his plans to VIP influencers:\n\n\"A sea of solemn nodding heads responded to his admonition. The Supreme Commander continued. 'This operation is not being planned with any alternatives. We're going to cross the channel, throw every resource we have into the invasion, and crush Hitler's Atlantic Wall! Overlord must and will end with the Allies firmly ashore in France!' Eisenhower grinned broadly and joked, 'In a few minutes, Hitler will have missed his one and only chance of destroying the entire high command of the Allied forces with a single well-aimed bomb!' The room of VIPs rippled with laughter.\"\n\nUlterior motives for various encounters, from stopping Patton to taking risks by psychologically manipulating major players and decision-makers, make for especially thought-provoking reading:\n\n\"I don't want to shut down Georgie again. But I also don't want to throw away the opportunity to be on the Rhine while there's still good campaigning weather. While Monty's plan is undoubtedly born out of his massive ego to stay in the spotlight and steal the show from Patton, I like how it uses the paratroopers as a force multiplier. I feel like I have coins burning in my pocket with those paratroopers sitting idle back in England. I must get them into the fight!\"\n\nThe result juxtaposes behind-the-scenes insights with military, strategic, and psychological interplays that delve deeper into the heart of World War II experiences and decision-making quandaries than many historical novels achieve.\n\nLibraries and readers who appreciated the tone and development of Ike's Journey are in for a treat here. Victory in Europe offers a rare opportunity for understanding the motivations and choices of major Allied decision-makers and forces in a different light.\n\nThis approach also makes Victory in Europe equally highly recommended for book clubs seeking World War II military stories simmering in both action and cat-and-mouse games that operate on many levels. There are many topics which will prove perfect fodder for lively discussions!\n\nA Moonrise in the Fire\n\nTessia Ives\n\nSilver Raven Press\n\n9798990068704, $13.99 Paperback/$5.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Moonrise-Fire-Tessia-Ives/dp/B0CVBQQN4P\n\nA Moonrise in the Fire is narrated by Talvi, who confesses, from the first line of her narrative, that she \"has no powers.\" In a world where everyone holds abilities, this is a serious lack that translates to no choices, either.\n\nTalvi finds purpose and a sense of strength in being the keeper of Starstone Temple in her forest town - but even this task threatens to vanish when a dangerous stranger arrives on her doorstep to threaten what little she has.\n\nCaelan is as attractive as he is mysterious, so Talvi finds herself confronting not just the threat to her childhood love and the absence of the Elemental forces within her that every other person holds, but traversing three realms in a quest that concurrently involves struggling with this Fire Elemental's dangerous draw.\n\nRomance, wilderness environments, and the attraction of power and love grasp reader attention with compelling dilemmas spiced by romance and danger alike. Talvi's struggles thus emerge to embrace far bigger-picture thinking than her singular life's ambitions.\n\nTessia Ives creates a likeable and realistic character in Talvi, presenting her as flawed hero whose world is shaken as much by the presence of new potential as the contrasting absence of her own powers.\n\nHow she gains empowerment, finds love, heals self and those around her, and learns to navigate realms, gigantic creatures, and new possibilities makes for a vivid story.\n\nEvents are further enhanced by Ives's attention to atmospheric descriptions and in-depth character development, which takes the time to build a realistic, memorable series of dilemmas and opportunities into Talvi's life and growth process.\n\nThe result holds more weight than many fantasy romances, but pays its readers amply for their efforts, via satisfying twists and turns and compelling scenes that go beyond the simpler approaches of too many genre reads.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking fantasy romances that operate on a bigger playing field than that of love and attraction alone will find the quest and psychological insights of A Moonrise in the Fire set it above and beyond the typical genre read, creating many vivid hours of immersive adventure that readers will welcome as they explore Talvi's world alongside her.\n\nInsecticide: A Republican Romance\n\nDouglas Robinson\n\nAtmosphere Press\n\nwww.atmospherepress.com\n\n9798891321960, $19.99/$9.99 ebook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Insecticide-Douglas-Robinson/dp/B0CWDQN962\n\nInsecticide: A Republican Romance pairs the efforts of author Douglas Robinson with researcher Bill Kaul in a novel that holds the drama of fiction laced with the overlay feel of nonfiction. Documents and events are paired in a manner that suggests Robinson is writing about a real world. In a manner of speaking, he is.\n\nHe's created an alternate history in which W. Averell \"Dogsbody\" Harriman convinced Prescott Bush to set up a new Republic of Texas in 1931. And that's not the only difference that sets this milieu apart from what really happened. It's best that readers who imbibe here already know their American history, because this knowledge will lend appreciation to Robinson's special blend of political, social, and sci-fi scenarios, which move from that history to cloning, giant insects, and more.\n\nWho is Prescott Bush, and why is fifty-something James Quincey Percival IV (who has worked for Harriman Investments for half a decade) both indebted to him and questioning the man's integrity and countenance? As the story unfolds, political and social satire mingles with the developments in Texas to reveal \"danger and opportunity\" with fire ants, freak electrical storms, supporting character revelations, and more:\n\n\"'Boys, boys,' I say, feeling very uncular. 'Come on. Enough already. We're not here to make policy. We're the mouthpieces of the people who make policy. Settle down for crikey's sake.' After they leave, I jot down some notes on their remarks to pass on to Henry. He should know what his people are saying about him.\"\n\nRobinson constructs an intriguing, thought provoking set of scenarios, clashes, and possible and impossible encounters that revolve around George (\"Poppy\") and other characters. They discover their lives are set on a course of ironic and odd changes, whether it be condom movements, the Church's problem with insects, the challenges facing the President of the Republic of Texas (George), and more.\n\nThis will especially delight readers who appreciate intricate blends of satire, history, speculative events, and sci-fi social scenarios in their literature; especially those attracted to works which challenge pat categorization.\n\nLibraries that choose Insecticide: A Republican Romance for its different form of political and social observation will find it easy to recommend to book clubs seeking out-of-the-box thinking and scenarios that lend to discussion and laughter in equal measure.\n\nCollapse Years\n\nDamir Salkovic\n\nThe Mad Duck Coalition\n\nhttps://themadduckcoalition.org/product/collapse-years\n\n9781956389203, $15.00\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CVNMYBDK\n\nCollapse Years is a fictional exploration of societal collapse, ghosts, and governments and families in disarray. It opens with the story 'Hantu', in which Arjani observes a ghostly dragon from her position in a refugee camp, which her family huddles in as the world around them collapses.\n\nThe sea has overrun their island, forcing them onto the mainland, where circumstances feel little better than the calamity they escaped, from a place which they once called home.\n\nIn this story, Hantu are awakened by these series of disasters:\n\n\"The sea rages and its waves eat people's homes. When there is turmoil, hantu are released. Ghosts with one foot in this world and the other in the next.\"\n\nAs fear, magic, and transformation take place even during these end times, Arjani finds the courage to escape the pharma camp to head into unknown new worlds and opportunities.\n\nThe next story, 'Carriers', explores the quarantine guards, bureaucratic chaos, and idiocy that impacts Myung-soo's changing world.\n\nAs events unfold, readers are treated to a vision of a collapsing society duly reported on by an aspiring on-scene witness who strives to achieve notoriety and success even as humanity devolves. His dream is that:\n\n\"...the Big Media Companies would descend on his feed like vultures, fighting tooth and nail over his photos, showering him in royalties.\"\n\nHis world of feast or famine rests solely on his ability to report disasters in a compelling manner. His ambition rests on a social and political disaster that could arm his photojournalism with passion and success:\n\n\"The last of the known infected had been penned into the Red Zone, a pre-Unification military base repurposed into the nation's largest viral containment camp. There they awaited recovery, or death, or the increasingly elusive cure, well-provi-sioned and isolated, guarded by soldiers and cared for by teams of medics. Through all of Myung-soo's research and reporting in the Itaewon bars, no source, government or otherwise, could confirm the number of detainees, or which units were still at their posts, or the names of pharma transnationals operating inside the Red Zone. No photojournalist had ever set foot within its gates. It was pristine source material, and Myung-soo was determined to carve it out for his own.\"\n\nPerhaps the greatest strength of the interlinked stories reflecting the newly structured human world in Collapse Years lies in their ability to examine the nature and costs of survival, and what it means to stay human under impossible conditions.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking apocalyptic stories that explore and cement the processes of de-evolution of the human spirit will find Collapse Years offers not only powerful observations and voices, but powerful contrasts in ideals of success and survival. These elements make the book a perfect recommendation for book clubs seeking exceptional material for debating end times and new beginnings.\n\nScout's Honor\n\nJohn McNellis\n\nwww.johnmcnellis.com\n\nHubbard House\n\n9781736352540, $6.99 eBook/$16.99 Paperback\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Scouts-Honor-John-McNellis/dp/1736352547\n\nIn Scout's Honor, which opens in 1969, eighteen-year-old Eddie Kawadsky's life has unraveled. His father was killed in Vietnam, his grieving mother abandoned him, and he's homeless and broke, as a result.\n\nThat's why the proposal of a seemingly well-meaning neighbor, which comes in the form of a job, sounds inviting. The offer could bring him back on track to fulfilling his dreams of college and achievement.\n\nUnfortunately, the proposal to transport marijuana over the Mexican border places him on the wrong side of the law, and when Roy abandons him too, Eddie finds himself on the lam and out of options.\n\nForced to assume a new identity to hide from authorities and others, Eddie works hard to craft the life of success and achievement that he's always dreamed of, while navigating the ongoing impacts of staying hidden and preserving his new identity against all odds.\n\nWill anyone ever forgive him his trespasses and subterfuge? How can Eddie restore honor to his life without threatening everything he's worked for?\n\nJohn McNellis creates a powerful \"world of sighs\" as he follows disparate characters who each search for stability and honor in their own ways; both independently and through their life-changing interactions with one another.\n\nNot quite a thriller, skirting the edges of romance (but filled with psychological transformative experiences that send the protagonist on a moral and ethical journey just when everything he's wanted is within his grasp), McNellis grows a story replete with moments of revelation and insights:\n\n\"His youthful absolutes had long since been stripped away, but he'd retained one certainty: Margaret would leave him if she knew. Maybe he could justify everything else, but not his wretched decision...\"\n\nReaders expecting another story of Vietnam's impact, creating and maintaining a false identity, or navigating love under conditions of searching for redemption and honor will find Scout's Honor doesn't neatly fit into any singular category.\n\nAs such, the novel will attract audiences interested in tales of discovery and change that move their action with character developments which take many unexpected turns to pose a number of uncommon dilemmas.\n\nWhat is success? Redefined in Scout's Honor, the novel will attract libraries and readers interested in a reflective piece about evolving, changing relationships and secrets that shine with the overlay of conspiracies and revised definitions of success.\n\nThe Emerald Cross\n\nKen Cruickshank\n\nwww.kencruickshank.com\n\nGlendoveer Press LLC\n\n9781960981134, $16.99 Paperback/$5.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/1960981137\n\nReaders who enjoy spirited thrillers replete with military background, experiences, and intrigue will find The Emerald Cross an appealing, notable draw. It features a complex interplay of characters, from wounded ex-Green Beret hero Jamie Morales (who returns home missing an eye and psychically suffering) to a mother whose possession of a valuable emerald cross from a Mexican drug lord poses danger to his entire family.\n\nDrawn into a dangerous game that rivals his armed forces experiences' complexity and the potential for personal disaster, Jamie is forced into a role that taps his military skills in a deadly cat-and-mouse game. This spins a fine yarn of intrigue, deception, and psychological challenge.\n\nInitially, these circumstances would seem to be in the bailiwick of the police, as Jamie seeks to assign them the task he is facing:\n\n\"Jamie turned and approached the police chief who'd just arrived. 'Marco Delgado has killed my entire family. I expect authorities or the military to hunt his ass down.'\"\n\nBut as his pursuit of justice dovetails with a mission of vengeance and confrontation, Jamie moves ever deeper into political confrontations revolving around moles, secrets, and the intersection of Mexican and American special interests.\n\nSpiced with DEA encounters, military skills put to unexpected use in civilian life, and underlying motives that affect not just the ownership of the emerald cross, but the lives of those involved in its management, Ken Cruickshank crafts a series of encounters that are vivid in their complexity and possibilities:\n\n\"'Power. Riches. Beautiful women. These are intoxicants to men striving to be the next king of kings in the drug realm,' Washington had once told Jamie. He'd added, 'The cycle won't end in my lifetime. But if the DEA and others don't stand up to them, who will?'\"\n\nCruickshank tempers action with psychological entanglements and revelations, leading thriller readers to more closely examine their own concepts of justice, vengeance, survival and exploitation.\n\nCultural and artistic revelations permeate the story, adding further layers of intrigue and mystery as the plot evolves.\n\nLibraries will want to recommend The Emerald Cross to patrons interested in military thrillers that revolve around vigilante efforts, PTSD and healing, and the circumstances that drive an ex-hero to pick up the reigns of battle as a civilian to tackle extraordinary opponents and circumstances that buffet both his life and his potential for healing.\n\nMilestone Documents in World History\n\nEric Cunningham, Editor\n\nSchlager Group\n\nhttps://www.schlagergroup.com\n\n9781961844049, $445 Hardcover/$410 ebook/ Hardcover + Ebook bundle: $490\n\nhttps://www.schlagergroup.com/9781961844049/milestone-documents-in-world-history\n\nMilestone Documents in World History: Exploring the Primary Sources That Shaped the World joins a widening set of source material reference books that identify and explore humanity's major documents and their impact.\n\nWeighty in subject and price, the coverage is essential for world history collections seeking an all-in-one synthesis of primary documents which have served as and represent the pillars of human thinking and achievement.\n\nThis second edition is the first update in the fifteen years since the original was published, and provides over 40 new entries across four volumes of in-depth reference material.\n\nThe cross-section of ancient and modern documents begins in the first volume, which covers 2350 BCE - 943CE with such references as Homer's Iliad, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and writings by Dao De Jing and Confucius. It moves forward in history, juxtaposing major thinkers and documents from around the world.\n\nThis cross-cultural slice of world-changing works offers offers high school and college-level students and scholars an especially astute contrast between major thinkers, encouraging references, associations, and discussions which might otherwise prove challenging to assemble.\n\nVolume 2 covers 1019 - 1821 with such classics as the Magna Carta, featured alongside works such as Ibn Battuta's Travels in Asia and Africa.\n\nEach volume synthesizes and condenses a period of history by profiling the greatest thinkers and writers of the times. As notable for its diversity and inclusiveness as it is for its organization, delivery, and opportunities for cross-comparisons of historic documents and events, it also offers scholarly commentary with each primary source. This makes it suitable for students and researchers interested in not just the source materials alone, but a critical analysis of each source and its overall importance in world history.\n\nThe scholarship, presentation, contents, and nature of this updated second edition makes Milestone Documents in World History: Exploring the Primary Sources That Shaped the World a top recommendation for any world history collection considering itself to be authoritative and inclusive.\n\nThe identification of 'milestone' achievements is outstanding, offering an unprecedented opportunity for study and contrast which is simply unavailable elsewhere.\n\nFamily: In Search of Genuine Belonging\n\nPaul Dunion EdD\n\nAtmosphere Press\n\nwww.atmospherepress.com\n\n9798891321113, $17.99\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Family-Belonging-Paul-Dunion-Edd/dp/B0CV62KL2M\n\nFamily: In Search of Genuine Belonging explores an important topic: how family love can fall apart in even the most loving of circles.\n\n\"Blessings\" of different family structures and dynamics accompany the identification and definitions of families that centers on different incarnations; from \"too much family\" (with entwined identities that aren't separate) to shame-based families; those dedicated to supporting heroic countenances; and others which require a scapegoat or mascot in order to function.\n\nEach incarnation is treated to Paul Dunion's analytical eye with the idea of exploring how denial, personal truths, chaos, or facades of looking good to those outside family translate to experience tempered by appearance.\n\nCase history examples support these identifications, reinforcing their boundaries and often-unspoken assumptions and rules; but it's the 'blessings' conclusion to each identification which holds the most uplifting opportunities for reconsidering ideals of perfection, survival, adaptation, connection, and, ultimately, love.\n\nPlenty of books on the market already tackle the nature of family relationships and connections. The difference in Family: In Search of Genuine Belonging lies in not just its definitions of family circles, but in its supportive realizations about how each type of family structure can offer new possibilities and blessings:\n\n\"Living in the shadows of shame can feel normal.\n\nYou don't belong there!\n\nYour parents felt terribly out of control and desperately\n\nemployed shame to regain control.\n\nOr they brought to you their own childhood shame\n\nwith them, modeling self-loathing.\n\nYou don't belong there!\n\nYour essential goodness sits in the recesses of your psyche,\n\nwaiting to be reclaimed.\"\n\nFamily: In Search of Genuine Belonging needs to be part of any psychology, family therapy, or group discussion where family bonds and entanglements are of prime interest. It also will enjoy a home in (and is highly recommended for) general-interest libraries interested in self-help titles that proffer important, practical information on the roots and impact of disparate family structures and ideals.\n\nAmy Unbound\n\nMartin Sneider\n\nJewish Leaders Books\n\nhttps://jewishleadersbooks.com\n\n9798989776108, $32.95, HC, 418pp\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Amy-Unbound-Martin-Sneider/dp/B0CV4LXJ2C\n\nThe protagonist in Amy Unbound fields an unhappy marriage and a successful law career when her story opens, but the new election of Obama as President creates within her newfound idealistic goals of social justice pursuits. These, in turn, give her the impetus to change her personal life, as well.\n\nSick of the Feldman family dynamics and her husband's always-broken promises, Amy confronts his patronizing, gaslighting ways and leaves for Washington. Her story opens at this point and moves into new possibilities as Josh finds himself, once again, repeating old patterns, feeling stuck:\n\n\"Not for the first time would Josh spend a sleepless night alone in their king-sized bed. And not for the first time would he try to figure out if there was any way to get their marriage back on track.\"\n\nMen and women will readily relate to the story of a powerful woman who grasps the reins of new opportunities while a husband is puzzled that she would do so without him.\n\nThe 2009 inauguration of President Obama was a heady time of hope. Martin Sneider both captures this political atmosphere and translates it into the personal decisions men and women faced as a result of these new possibilities for the future.\n\nWhere many similar-sounding stories about marital challenge seem to focus on the female's point of view, one special note to Amy Unbound is that the story isn't just about Amy's revelations. Despite the book's title, Martin Sneider takes the time to equally depict an already-strong woman's foray into the unknown, and its impact and concurrent changes on Josh's marriage and life:\n\n\"Josh was awakened the next morning by a text ping from his cell phone. From Amy. About time, he thought. He read the seven-word text, and his jaw dropped.\n\n'Will be in D.C. for the foreseeable.'\n\nA seven-word message after 48 hours of separation? He then checked his email inbox. Maybe Amy had sent a lengthier explanation. Nada. Zero. Nothing from Amy. Josh was shocked. What did she mean by 'foreseeable?'\"\n\nAs events emerge from Amy's increasing involvement in the Chicago Alliance for Social Justice and her political connections in Washington, Josh also begins to move in different circles of family and friends. He finds himself better understanding situations normally on the periphery of his experience, such as his gay brother Rand's life and feelings:\n\n\"Rand had some friends over that evening, and Josh found it strange to be the only straight guy in the room. The friends couldn't have been more welcoming. It dawned on Josh, not for the first time, how isolated his brother must have felt to be the only gay guy in a room full of heteros.\"\n\nFamily members don't automatically jump up to support Amy's endeavor. Indeed, her St. Louis visits home spark contentions that further impact Amy's trajectory and her marriage, leading her to more closely examine not just her husband, but her entire family support system and their behaviors towards her.\n\nEven as Josh focuses on how to repair relationship damage (or control it better), Amy stands at a crossroads in her life, facing the promise and mystery of a new relationship. Is it worth jettisoning the remnants of her tattered marriage with Josh, who was her best friend and love for most of her adult life?\n\nSneider's portrait of not just Amy's side, but the entire family's dance around danger makes for a thought-provoking, moving story. Amy Unbound will reach a wide audience of men and women interested in political, psychological, and social transformation.\n\nBoth Amy and Josh are challenged (and changed) by new opportunities and moves. Forced to examine or reexamine their deepest ideals and how they solve or avoid problems, Amy and Josh spin circles around one another - and around the actions and motivations of family members who prove to be both \"friend and foe.\"\n\nThe process by which Amy is forced to come full-circle is especially inviting and revealing. This will attract book club discussion groups interested in topics of marriage, strong women who make bids for freedom and empowerment, and men and women who manage to keep love alive despite vast changes, plots, and plans.\n\nAmy Unbound will interest any library looking for novels steeped in social, political, and psychological depth. The characters, entire family, and the outside buffet of political forces on all their worlds is a sterling example of interconnected worlds and cross-purposes depicted at their best.\n\nRidgetown\n\nJim Tindle\n\nOxford Book Writers\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbookwriters.com\n\n9781961636705, $19.99 Hardcover/$14.99 Paperback/$2.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Ridgetown-Novel-Jim-Tindle/dp/1961636700\n\nRidgetown opens (but does not remain) in Blue Ridge, Georgia; where a discussion is taking place about the possibility of overthrowing the U.S. government. Unlikely? Perhaps not.\n\nConversants Coker and Hatton have just left Blue Ridge on their way to Carthage, North Carolina. They have a strategy in place for enacting change - but tonight they are on a hit mission to take down one who beat them to their goal of shooting up electrical power substations.\n\nFast forward six months to Los Angeles, California, where the novel's main protagonist, Arsen, is tapped to travel to Blue Ridge to confront and disable a secret militia uprising. Suddenly, Coker and Hatton's involvements and actions make more sense. Or, do they?\n\nArsen uncovers a rabbit warren of complexity and subterfuge in a mission that leads him to confront militia members one by one. As he does so, he also confronts his own ideals, skillsets, and personal challenges as a cat-and-mouse game forces him to tackle past historical precedent and events and their present-day impacts:\n\n\"...it was as dark as dark can be in that goddamned jungle while we were dug-in waiting for a Viet Cong death squad that had been terrorizing villages in the area. It's amazing at the various emotions wandering through one's mind in a situation like that. You're worried about ever seeing family and friends again, you're worried about taking a bullet right between the eyes, and you're worried about the eight men for whom you're responsible.\"\n\nJames Bond comes to mind with many of Arsen's moves and flamboyant adventures; but Jim Tindle tempers any tendency towards overly enthusiastic encounters with a thought-provoking tone of deeper discovery. This leads to psychological revelations and (literally) explosive changes that challenge all sides involved in the fray of social and political change.\n\nThis approach results in a thriller that excels in high-level suspense, surprise insights and revelations, and action delivered with a sense of social and personal inspection. These elements lead readers to care about Arsen's ultimate objectives and experiences, as well as the impact and ideology of those he deals with. Events force him to face the elusive Crimson Fox in a journey that, at times, is surrealistic and always involving.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking thrillers that juxtapose edge-of-your-seat action with involving military and civilian special interests will find Ridgetown an attraction on many different levels to many audiences. It will attract those who enjoy thriller and suspense stories with its surprising twists, as well as others seeking to experience and gain higher-level thinking and psychological depth from their reading.\n\nMahjong at Mara's\n\nDebra Green\n\nwww.DebraGreenWriter.com\n\nDenouement Press\n\n9798989544905, $19.95 Paperback/$9.95 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/MAHJONG-AT-MARAS-Debra-Green/dp/B0CR7TXZD5\n\nMahjong at Mara's will attract a wide audience of fiction readers, from those who especially appreciate contrasts in cross-generational encounters and relationships to readers of women's and family stories.\n\nBinding these subjects are mahjong experiences which offer opportunities for group get-togethers and dialogues that unfold from the veneer of a game.\n\nA prologue sets the story in 2019, with Giselle and her father driving west thru Pennsylvania. The move is not her choice, but offers the opportunity to get away from a relationship which has become dull and too predictably set in its ways for a young adult:\n\n\"She had been frustrated with her relationship with Dante for some time. He had become boring. He wouldn't go into New York with her, go to a movie, a museum, or anywhere else to escape their tiny lives. He liked his. She couldn't breathe. In her mind, she was already at college at Princeton.\"\n\nReaders then take a step back into the past of 2018, where Lila raises her son Dante and counts him as one of her blessings, despite the difficulty of being a single mom after 9/11 claimed his father.\n\nA cast of supporting characters emerges, from lonely elder Mali Berkowitz to Gladys, a caustic divorcee whom Mali dislikes.\n\nAll these forces coalesce around and find comfort in the game of mahjong and interactions with others who participate. An odd sense of mixed community and age ranges become engaged over the shared interest.\n\nDebra Green crafts a fine series of personality interactions, viewpoints, age ranges, and concerns that come to life in Mahjong at Mara's. The game also introduces facets of life that lead to revelations between related and unrelated players, who discover new insights and connections.\n\nParticipation not only holds new opportunities, but introduces different challenges to existing friendships both within and outside the circle, as Dante discovers:\n\n\"Dante wasn't sure which was more difficult to share with Rashon, that he now occasionally played mahjong with the group of seniors or that twenty bucks an hour was, in fact, his hourly wage.\"\n\nThe result is a warm examination of evolving friendships, some adversity, and transition points of youth that lead to unexpected revelations and interests, from growing love at an advanced age to the changes between young participants who absorb a different world and insights from the mahjong setting.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking a cross-generational exploration of disparate lives and the wisdom to be obtained from their intersection will find Mahjong at Mara's invitingly thought-provoking. It's an excellent choice for book club reading group discussions, from women's groups to fiction readers seeking topics that reflect insights on troubled youth, squabbles and conflicts in friendships, and complicated relationships between seniors and young people.\n\nBroken Hope\n\nCarrie Rubin\n\nhttps://carrierubin.com\n\nIndigo Dot Press\n\n9781958160077, $13.99 Paperback/$4.99 eBook/$12.99 Audiobook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Broken-Hope-Carrie-Rubin-ebook/dp/B0CXFJHBBB\n\nBroken Hope is a medical, psychological \"revenge thriller\" that rests upon the actions and threat of Dr. Hope Sullivan, who is known by many as an especially compassionate physician, but who also holds a secret agenda that belays any notion of that compassion in action.\n\nRevenge is a dish best served cold, as the saying goes. In this case, Dr. Sullivan's special brand of vigilante service goes beyond moral and ethical boundaries to address her perceived wrongs and make her feel better about her choices... until someone finds out about her deepest secret.\n\nSuddenly, Dr. Sullivan faces a psychological and physical threat that challenges the methods she's employed to find meaning and purpose in her activities. The stalker is relentless in his pursuit, forcing Dr. Sullivan into increasingly deadly scenarios as she struggles with her own viewpoint and mandate and the clash of these interests with a force bent on destroying her.\n\nCarrie Rubin excels in dovetailing personal psychological inspections with the bigger picture of an adversary whose actions and choices are, in actuality, not so very far from the good/bad doctor's approach to life.\n\nShe creates an intersection between medical and moral decision-making which poses many intriguing thoughts and moments to readers, embedding the action and thriller components with realistic scenarios of blackmail, revenge, and accompanying dilemmas, from suicide to dangerous discoveries others make about the situation:\n\n\"'Hmm?' she asks. 'Do you think I'm guilty of something?' He rasps nothing in reply, unsure if it's a trap or not. Wonders, too, if he has it all wrong. He was wrong about Dr. Sullivan. What if he's wrong about this doctor too? What if his wife's death really was unpreventable? What if his obsessive quest to right an injustice stems only from his inability to accept the fact that Jasmine is gone?\"\n\nWhile the thriller and medical world elements are very strongly presented, supporting tension with background Broken Hope lies beyond the clever cat-and-mouse games which drive the plot.\n\nFirst-person insights and reflections address issues ranging from charges of negligence to outright criminal intent. There are many vivid scenes of confrontation (such as suicide and overwhelming grief) which may prove triggering to some readers; but these lend authenticity and familiarity to the story, boosting it into realms of greater understanding and reader connection.\n\nThe result is a thriller that contains psychological depth and insights on motivation, choice, and impact. Its focus on moral and ethical dilemmas adds philosophical and social twists to the plot, making Broken Hope especially highly recommended for libraries seeing patron interest in medical thrillers that take the time to develop more complex interpersonal and revenge scenarios beyond the usual murder setting.\n\nAlmost Everything You Wanted to Know About Tickling\n\nDuncan Taub\n\nIndependently Published\n\n9798879766431, $14.99 Paperback/$2.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Almost-Everything-Wanted-About-Tickling/dp/B0CVSG13PN\n\nAlmost Everything You Wanted to Know About Tickling: An International Study will pique the interest of readers interested in tickling in particular and relationships in general. The role of tickling in the lives of some 2,000 women around the world receives close inspection, from its perception as a positive bonding experience to instances of abusive tickling. For at least some relationships, tickling serves an important function.\n\nTaub adopts a tone that marries scholarly research and lively inspection to a topic that is rarely examined and poorly understood. This allows for a dual satisfaction by researchers and general-interest readers alike, who will find the story of tickling both interesting and insightful. In the words of Taub: \"...evolution went to a lot of trouble designing a specific ticklishness that separates humans from all other animals, and evolution don't make no junk. If it's not junk, then what's it around for? How common is it? How does it affect us? What's it good for? How is it misused? Are we stuck with something that helped our species 100,000 years ago, but is now just a nuisance? This book does not provide definitive answers to any of these questions, but it gives interesting insights that advance our understanding.\"\n\nTaub believes that tickling was not previously studied in depth because \"tickling research does not advance scientific careers or help secure grants, the driving forces for research.\" He then explains why he could do this study:\n\n\"These reasons, however, were not barriers for a retired researcher. With the resources that have recently been made available on the internet, neither was the cost, which would have been prohibitive until the internet provided easy access to freelancers across the world.\"\n\nThe book based on his research is filled with careful science and fascinating commentary. It will hold up in research-based collections but, more importantly to the general reader, it is a fun read and would be a great topic for a book discussion.\n\nTen Nobodies (and their somebodies)\n\nMartin Drapkin\n\nThree Towers Press\n\nc/o Henchel Haus Publishing\n\nwww.HenschelHAUSbooks.com\n\n9781595989819, $16.99 Paperback/$8.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Nobodies-their-somebodies-Martin-Drapkin/dp/1595989811\n\nTen Nobodies (and their somebodies) is a novel about disparate personalities and odd characters whose lives intersect. These lives originated in Martin Drapkin's musings about 'nobodies' who served the rich and famous, and how the dovetailing of disparate classes and experiences provided unexpected opportunities for both.\n\nHe employs the first person to bring these musings and perspectives to life, beginning with a muse to William Shakespeare, who is an aging sexton and widower when he meets the bard in 1595.\n\nA historical overview documents his mourning before they meet, and a series of enlightening encounters identifies his position as a possible muse and inspirational figure in Shakespeare's life as the story unfolds.\n\nIn contrast is the piece about Lewis Carroll and his 'tea party assistant\" which introduces not just a different era, but more insights about the role of a friend, muse, and helper:\n\n\"I met Mr. Dodgson shortly before Christmas of 1896, backstage after an opening of Alice in Wonderland at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. My insufferable older sister, Evelyn, was playing the lead role and my younger sister, Lily, had the role of the Dormouse. Mr. Dodgson was cooing over Evelyn and telling her how wonderful she was and what a perfect little Alice she'd been and how her performance so put him in mind of the real Alice, his beloved \"dream-child,\" and on and on. It almost made me sick. Yet, I thought, how interesting he appeared: a tall, thin man with white hair, standing quite erect, wearing a black broadcloth cleric's suit, collar turned back, and a white tie. And gentle. So gentle. I'd never seen anyone quite like him before, and was intrigued.\"\n\nAs the stories progress, the roles of aides, maids, fortunetellers, hairstylists, and other kinds of assistants come to light in a survey of famous personalities and the kindred spirits they attracted.\n\nThe whimsy, fun, and thought-provoking moments that permeate this work of fiction also offer thought-provoking insights into mentors and their influences. This creates a delightful interplay between characters and perceptions.\n\nDrapkin is especially strong in his ability to capture a sense of the times, creative personalities who were supported by 'nobodies' equally memorable in their approaches to life, and in outlining the ideas and experiences that grew creative personalities and relationships alike.\n\nThe result is a fun frolic through disparate lives which receives satisfying contrasts in outlook, experience, and purpose. It's a fictional romp that libraries will find easy to recommend to short story readers looking for something different.\n\nThe Clearing\n\nCassandra J. Kelly\n\nwww.cassandrajkelly.com\n\nBoyle & Dalton\n\n9781633377769, Hardcover: $26.99/Paperback: $16.99/eBook: $6.99\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Clearing-Cassandra-J-Kelly/dp/1633377768\n\nThe Clearing will delight readers seeking an Ohio backdrop to their stories, and also will attract those interested in fictional explorations of the impact of a health crisis on young people in families that already struggle with financial concerns.\n\nSadie is twelve when her mother's diagnosis of multiple sclerosis introduces grief and angst into her childhood world. She seeks to walk out of this sadness by escaping to the forest outside her home; there to absorb lessons of Appalachian herbal lore which distract her from the pain she cannot escape at home.\n\nWhen she meets Cali (a feral child) in the woods, the two find their friendship changes each of their lives and perspectives in unexpected ways.\n\nCassandra J. Kelly documents a family under siege from health and financial crisis - a too-common occurrence in modern times - but cultivates insights, emotions, and viewpoints from the eyes of youths impacted by ongoing health issues.\n\nThe story opens with car problems in the middle of nowhere. A sick mother is forced to consider how to solve this dilemma, while the daughter who drives her laments their lack of a cell phone and reflects on her upbringing and life with a sick mother.\n\nThe impact of this illness has followed her from school days to the time when she was forced stayed home to care for her mother:\n\n\"I found every reason possible to leave class in the middle of the day, and my mom was used to picking me up. I developed an unspoken habit of calling on her infusion days because I knew she needed me just as much as I needed her.\"\n\nKelly's focus on adaptations, survival tactics, struggles with mortality and treatments that preserve life but don't guarantee its quality, and the Ohio world that grounds the young protagonist creates a thought-provoking series of events. These follow Sadie's interactions with father Gabe Daniels, her new friend, and her dying mother.\n\nMore so than most fictional explorations of death and childhood trauma, The Clearing holds the ability to mark moments of energy-producing encounters which happen alongside the daily grind, embedding life in Sadie's story, with its fluxes between looming death and moments of joy.\n\nThe natural world that reflects and supports Sadie's growth is an intrinsic part of the story that keeps the girl on an upward trajectory with new possibilities that don't all center on the sadness and loss of impending death.\n\nLibraries and readers seeking a story about different forms of family, love, support, and the impact of long-term medical crises will find The Clearing a vivid, memorable read that should attract a wide audience.\n\nThe Power Paradox\n\nArt McNeese\n\nIndependently Published\n\n9798362039103, $9.99 Paperback/$2.99 eBook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Power-Paradox-Winning-Downward-Mobility/dp/B0CWDXM344\n\nThe Power Paradox: Winning through Downward Mobility may sound like a business or social survey rather than a spiritual probe of discovery, but its focus on Christian leadership and pastoral services lends it a special value and approach. These will attract Christian audiences interested in issues of strength, weakness, and religious perspectives on power.\n\nFrom the beginning, Art McNeese injects his exploration with vivid insights linking Christian faith and ideals with psychological and social reflections:\n\n\"Think about weakness in your own life. If you're like most people, you may run from vulnerability. You may choose self-reliance over God-reliance. You're tempted to follow the\n\ncultural philosophy of me-first. You automatically assume that revealing your weaknesses to others is a bad thing. But what if weakness is actually your friend? What if there's more to be gained from a position of weakness than a position of strength?\"\n\nAs McNeese's exploration progresses, readers receive thoughts on life approaches that pair insights and advice with Bible quotes reinforcing his observations:\n\n\"Leadership means being part of the secret service. I have a friend who exhibits this quality. He has made millions in his life and gives away most of what he earns to help others. He has developed a special trust designed to resource people in need. I can't imagine how much money he has given away over the years. But he insists on his gifts being anonymous. He refuses to let his generosity be known. Most of us can serve with passion in the event there's some 'payoff' in terms of recognition. But how many of us bring the same enthusiasm to opportunities to serve behind the scenes? Where nobody sees and nobody knows?\n\n1 Peter 2:12: 'Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.'\"\n\nThese provide spiritual thinkers with concrete examples, reflections, and insights on the processes and incarnation of power (especially in leadership roles; whether they involve church or business).\n\nReaders won't expect allusions to the unexpected, such as the dilemma of a squirrel in the toilet; but these, too, hold lessons in leadership and faith that inject the realities and ironies of daily living with important realizations about identity, fear, and the ultimate solution of turning to faith and God for resolution:\n\n\"The only healthy element for a human being is in the grace and will of God. Whenever we forget the grace of God, we find ourselves confused and uncertain. Anytime we try to find our value through others instead of God, we're destined to be intimidated, lost, and terribly frightened.\"\n\nChristian readers and book clubs (and libraries catering to them) will find The Power Paradox: Winning through Downward Mobility a thought-provoking discourse about faith and power which will prompt many an avid reading circle discussion.\n\nDespite a title which initially feels as though The Power Paradox will appeal primarily to business or political leaders, the discourse is highly recommended to all Christian readers. This audience will find The Power Paradox's insights and reflections on life, faith, and power to be an important intersection of subjects. It's perfect for cultivating a more faith-based perspective about power, shifting roles, and contributions to belief and life.\n\nWhere I See You\n\nCatherine Conmy\n\nBlackbeard Books\n\n9798218973551, $16.99 Print/.99 Ebook\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXX1LGV8?ref_=ast_author_dp\n\nIn Where I See You, Piper has stormed out of the house. She \"lugs her sorrow with every step.\" It turns out that it's a sorrow of confusion, because the reality is that Piper has a baby she doesn't remember and a life which has been pieced back together from a terrible accident.\n\nElliot and Piper are engaged when everything changes. Now she wonders where her life has gone, realizing that Elliot has somehow been transformed in her apparent absence from the world.\n\nBut, Where I See You isn't just a story of recovery. It's also one of discovery, from a world impacted by technological advances that actually do a grave disservice to the disabled to a relationship similarly impacted. The changes drive the couple in different directions, as each holds increasingly disparate ideals of what life should be.\n\nFrom the contrasts between urban chaos and rural respite to the moral and ethical challenges in technological advancement's promises and threats, Where I See You turns a dystopian setting into a personal stage for exploring relationships, feelings, and the process of self and the world 'coming undone.'\n\nAnother plus of the story is that it shifts viewpoints between Piper and Elliot. This gives the plot added value as these perspectives change.\n\n\"We are forced to face the consequences. There is no way to hide this time.\"\n\nFrom rituals and reality to a world designed to \"...bring attention away...\" Piper and Elliot find their relationship conundrums dovetailing with technological, social, and psychological changes that transform their ideals of life, death, and what lies in-between them.\n\nThe slow simmer of shifting realities is delivered in bits and pieces. This succeeds in keeping readers engaged, on their toes, and constantly surprised by the directions the plot ultimately takes.\n\nWhat will life be when a life-changing procedure takes place? More importantly, what will the relationship become?\n\nCatherine Conmy's exquisite interplay of dystopian background, change, and the process of absorbing and entering a new life makes Where I See You a thought-provoking read not only highly recommended for general library collections, but for book clubs seeking a redefinition of and new directions in what constitutes a dystopian scenario.\n\nAlyssa's Wishes\n\nSusan L.

When she enters school, she is confronted with peers' lives which are definitely not like hers, from her father's idea of ordering pizza every night for a meal to slowly realizing why her father lives such a hermit-like lifestyle.\n\nAn art assignment propels her in new directions when Alyssa is encouraged to use art to reflect on her own life and carries this assignment into uncharted territory.\n\nSusan L. Read crafts a story in which a young student is just beginning to confront the incongruities of her life with her father, before disaster strikes and changes her world:\n\n\"Everything I understood and loved about my life has been snatched away.\"\n\nAs Alyssa becomes involved in projects that move away from the initial assignment, from educating peers about puppy mills and their impact to transforming her own life, Read's vivid portrayal of these experiences draw attention and attraction while educating readers about many facets of life, love, and survival:\n\n\"Puppy mill survivors can have both physical and mental scars from their past experiences, and Poppy definitely has both. But she has made lots of progress in just one week.\"\n\nWhen her father begins to confront his own visions of family and his failure to engage with life, Alyssa taps her magical thinking and newfound passions to transform both of their lives.\n\nAlyssa's Wishes is about survival, magical thinking, and the power young people have to change their lives.
