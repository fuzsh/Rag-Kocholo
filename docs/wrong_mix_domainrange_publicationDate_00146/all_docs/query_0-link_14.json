        "text": "From my list on realistic near-future science fiction.\n\nBy S.B. Divya Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nBack in college, I switched from being an astrophysics major to computational neuroscience. The reasons are complicated, but suffice it to say that I found the human brain to be as big of a mystery as black holes. I’ve worked as an engineer for two decades on applications ranging from medical devices, to digital music recognition, to high speed chip design. Writing science fiction is the second act of my life, and I love drawing on my science background to inform my stories. I especially love taking cutting-edge technology and thinking about how it could impact future society, from the global to the individual.\n\nS.B.'s book list on realistic near-future science fiction\n\nWhy did S.B. love this book?\n\nFirst Light is another interesting exploration of artificial intelligence and brain/body modification. The story focuses on a soldier and has a good amount of techno-thriller type action. It keeps the pace nice and quick, and I found the main character and his squad to be full of fun, sympathetic characters.\n\nNagata has written some excellent far-future worlds (e.g. The Bohr Maker), but in this novel, she sticks to the upcoming decades, and along the way, she raises some great questions about morality and humanity.\n\nBy Linda Nagata,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Red as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2015\n\nReality TV and advanced technology make for high drama in this political thriller that combines the military action of Zero Dark Thirty with the classic science fiction of The Forever War.\n\nLieutenant James Shelley, who has an uncanny knack for premeditating danger, leads a squad of advanced US Army military tasked with enforcing the peace around a conflict in sub-Saharan Africa. The squad members are linked wirelessly 24/7 to themselves and a central intelligence that guides them via drone relay—and unbeknownst to Shelley and his team, they are being recorded for a reality…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on genre mashups in science fiction and fantasy.\n\nBy David Wellington Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nScience fiction and Fantasy have always been about exploring new ideas in novel ways—right from the beginning, Mary Shelley saw the story of Frankenstein as a chance to explore ideas of liberation and equality that, at the time, were too uncomfortable for mainstream stories. Since then many writers have found success by mashing up sf with other literary genres to discover the boundaries—and the gray areas—between them. In my latest book I explore the deep connection between horror (the fear of the unknown) and sf (the drive toward wonder). Some of my most cherished books have similarly charted these murky borderlands.\n\nDavid's book list on genre mashups in science fiction and fantasy\n\nWhy did David love this book?\n\nI love this book for its science fiction and magical realism. This generational saga of a small town on a recently terraformed Mars is both a love letter to and an evolution on Gabriel Garcia Marquez’sOne Hundred Years of Solitude.\n\nMcDonald wanted to capture the frontier magic of a whole new world in a way that wasn’t just moving the American West to space, and in the end he breathes new life into one of the oldest tropes of SF, the colony story.\n\nCharming, fantastical, and witty, it shares its source material’s deep humanism even in the face of cynical realism. It may very well be my favorite novel of all time, and luckily for all of us, there’s an equally great sort of sequel, Ares Express.\n\nBy Ian McDonald,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Desolation Road as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nIt all started thirty years ago on Mars. By the time it was finished, the town of Desolation Road had been witness to every abnormality yet seen on the Red Planet. From Adam Black's Wonderful Travelling Chautauqua and Educational 'Stravaganza, to the Astounding Tatterdemalion Air Bazaar, nowhere else boasts such sights for the wandering lucky traveller.\n\nIts inhabitants are just as storied. From Dr. Alimantando -- founder and resident genius -- to the Babooshka, a barren grandmother with a child grown in a fruit jar; from Rajendra Das, mechanical hobo whose way with machines bordered on the mystic, to the…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on science fiction’s golden age.\n\nBy Lavie Tidhar Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by the Golden Age of science fiction, when a group of young dreamers formed the genre as we know it today. I grew up far away from their world, on a small kibbutz in Israel, and the lives of those god-like beings seemed as remote and as impossible as the moon. I grew up to eventually write stories of my own, and even got to meet some of my childhood heroes, and eventually I thought it would be fun to write a book that was partially about them. I read every book I could get my hands on to try and better understand that time when science fiction was born.\n\nLavie's book list on science fiction’s golden age\n\nWhy did Lavie love this book?\n\nAnthony Boucher straddles the history of both crime fiction and science fiction.\n\nAs the founding editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction he has an oversized role in the history of the genre. As a crime writer, he gave his name to the Anthony Awards, which are handed out every year at the annual Bouchercon.\n\nHis SF story “The Quest for Saint Aquin” is a classic. None of this, admittedly, has much to do with Rocket to the Morgue, Boucher’s roman-à-clef mystery set in pre-WW2 California in which the emerging world of science fiction comes to glorious life. A young L. Ron Hubbard makes an appearance, as do Robert A. Heinlein and the rocket scientist and occultist Jack Parsons.\n\nThe mystery matters less than the characters, who though moving under different names are all very much true to life.\n\nBy Anthony Boucher,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Rocket to the Morgue as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Golden Age mystery set in the Golden Age of science fiction\n\nLegendary science fiction author Fowler Faulkes may be dead, but his creation, the iconic Dr. Derringer, lives on in popular culture. Or, at least, the character would live on if not for Faulkes’s predatory and greedy heir Hilary, who, during his time as the inflexible guardian of the estate, has created countless enemies in the relatively small community of writers of the genre. So when he is stabbed nearly to death in a room with only one door, which nobody was seen entering or exiting, Foulkes suspects a…\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on alternate/secret histories that blew my mind.\n\nBy Tom Doyle Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI love history, and it infuses most of my fiction. Since I first picked up a book, I’ve never stopped learning about the past. Now, I listen to college courses and podcasts and read books both popular and academic. Sometimes this is for my writing or personal travel, but those things are often just excuses for the fun of immersion in a subject. I particularly enjoy reading and writing alternate/secret history because it merges creative imagination with factual scholarship. But I’m picky about the use of history in all media—factual sloppiness bumps me out of a story as quickly as bad physics drives a scientist from an SF movie.\n\nTom's book list on alternate/secret histories that blew my mind\n\nWhy did Tom love this book?\n\nSmale is a fantastic award-winning writer of alternate history, and in Hot Moon we get to see that skill combined with his day job as astrophysicist for NASA. But above all this is an action story of the Cold War turning “hot” on the moon.\n\nThere are other alternate Apollo tales (e.g., For All Mankind), but I don’t know of any that have this level of space combat. Smale’s sprezzatura with the scientific details is such that I was never pushed out of the story by their complexity or by doubt in their correctness.\n\nAnd like all of Smale’s work, Hot Moon never loses track of the importance of the “who” experiences technological change versus the change itself.\n\nI’m looking forward to the next book in this series!\n\nBy Alan Smale,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Hot Moon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nHAVE YOU READ ONE OF THE BEST SF BOOKS OF 2022?\n\n\"A nail-biting thriller.\"−Publishers Weekly\n\n\"I loved it. Great 'hard' science fiction with convincing space battles. \"−Larry Niven\n\n\"Will delight and enthrall.\"−Library Journal\n\n\"A provocative science fiction novel.\"−Foreword Reviews\n\n“A superb mind-expanding sci-fi novel!”−Grady Harp (Amazon Hall of Fame Top100 Reviewer)\n\nFrom the two-time Sidewise Award-winning author of the acclaimed Clash of Eagles trilogy comes an alternate 1979 where the US and the Soviets have permanent Moon bases, orbiting space stations, and crewed spy satellites supported by frequent rocket launches.\n\nApollo 32, commanded by career astronaut Vivian Carter, docks at…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Louise love this book?\n\nAs one of the founding fathers of Nanopunk, Neal Stephenson’s writings form a straightforward bridge between Postcyberpunk and Neon Science-Fiction. His novel is a collection of exotic technologies like matter compilers, smart paper, immunity-enhancing particles, and foldable transportable mech-horses. Eventually, I found myself inspired to create exotic tech of my own (e.g. foods, arts, weapons, and technologies fully based on “Dark”, an unconstructed area of “empty space” featured somewhat heavily in my neon sci-fi novel). Stephenson’s novel also depicts an extremely globalized future, founded on molecular nanotech, rapidly assembled usable goods, and socio-cultural division. The title’s allusion to a “Diamond Age” fully based on nanotechnology (diamonds can be assembled from individual carbon atoms) is a complex commentary on economics and how an object loses its value through mass production.\n\nBy Neal Stephenson,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Diamond Age as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nCULT AUTHOR NEAL STEPHENSON'S UNSTOPPABLE SCI-FI CLASSIC\n\nThe future is small. The future is nano . . .\n\nAnd who could be smaller or more insignificant than poor Little Nell - an orphan girl alone and adrift in a world of Confucian Law, Neo-Victorian values and warring nanotechnology?\n\nWell, not quite alone. Because Nell has a friend, of sorts. A guide, a teacher, an armed and unarmed combat instructor, a book and a computer: the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer is all these and much much more. It is illicit, magical, dangerous.\n\nAnd it isn't Nell's. It was stolen. And now…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Paige love this book?\n\nThis is somewhat science fiction, but more of an alternate historical fiction novel. This is the first in the Lady Astronaut series. It starts off with a bang, literally, when a meteorite hits Earth in 1952. This meteorite destroys much of the east coast and sets off a ticking time bomb where Earth will no longer be habitable in a matter of decades. Now there is a full effort to colonize space so humans can find another home. Women who were once thought not able to become astronauts are now able to vie for spots in the Astronaut Corps along with their male counterparts. I love science history and reading about the women “calculators” of this area (Katherine Johnson, Rear Adm Grace Hopper, etc.). So if there’s a space adventure set in this era, count me in!\n\nBy Mary Robinette Kowal,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n2 authors picked The Calculating Stars as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA meteor decimates the U.S. government and paves the way for a climate cataclysm that will eventually render the earth inhospitable to humanity. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated timeline in the earth's efforts to colonize space, as well as an unprecedented opportunity for a much larger share of humanity to take part.\n\nOne of these new entrants in the space race is Elma York, whose experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition's attempts to put man on the moon. But with so many skilled and experienced women pilots…\n\nPreview\n\nWhy did Maria love this book?\n\nThis entire series is awesome. The humor is out of this world funny (pun intended). It didn’t take me more than a few pages to warm up to Murderbot, even if he/she is a robot. Oh, there’s enough of a human brain stem left to ensure a soul filled with humor and the best parts of humanity: self-sacrifice, empathy, and cleverness, not to mention a bad attitude towards life and work in general that I could totally sympathize with.\n\nThis first adventure includes kidnappings, rescues, intrigue, and burgeoning friendships. These books are a mix of space opera and science fiction. My husband, not much of a reader, listened to the audiobooks and is also a huge fan of the series.\n\nBy Martha Wells,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n22 authors picked All Systems Red as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAll Systems Red by Martha Wells begins The Murderbot Diaries, a new science fiction action and adventure series that tackles questions of the ethics of sentient robotics. It appeals to fans of Westworld, Ex Machina, Ann Leckie's Imperial Raadch series, or lain M. Banks' Culture novels.

What is surprising is Star Surgeon’s double-twist—the patients aren’t who we think they are, and the secret to getting Earth into the prestigious Galactic Confederation isn’t what we think it is—both of which actually had huge real-world thematic implications. On face level, it’s a medical thriller: the protag’s the first alien to graduate from human medical school, and he’s got to prove himself by curing an epidemic on a remote planet without arousing the ire of his human teachers. (I felt like this in residency.) But on a metaphysical level, Star Surgeon is a quiet manifesto dissecting the origins of racism—and the very biology of sentience itself.\n\nBy Alan E Nourse,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Star Surgeon as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nA Sector General Novel In the far future Humans are part of an intergalactic civilization populated with countless alien races. Humans are prized for their medical expertise and make up almost all of doctors in the galaxy. Dal Timgar is the first non-human to attempt to become a qualified physician recognized by the Hospital Earth. But, before he reaches his goal he and his companions find a plague planet that may change the course of history.\n\nPreview\n\nFrom my list on sci-fi for newbies, from a newbie sci-fi writer.\n\nBy Don Kinney Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’ve been fascinated by science and space since I was a child and naturally gravitated toward science fiction. In many respects, it was a form of escapism, as I didn’t enjoy school. I always preferred escaping into another world or being taken on a journey to another world. It wasn’t until I got older that I realized that most great science fiction is a commentary on our own world and the issues we face daily. Science fiction, more than any other genre, does a better job of exploring and dissecting aspects of our world, which in turn helps us better understand our world and our relationship with it.\n\nDon's book list on sci-fi for newbies, from a newbie sci-fi writer\n\nWhy did Don love this book?\n\nThe Accidental Time Machine is one of the few novels that I’ve read beginning to end in one sitting because I found it so interesting. This isn’t the type of novel that will change your life or change how you feel about something. It’s just good. A good, fun book that can be read in a couple of hours. Haldeman doesn’t waste any time getting the story going and from there he takes you on a ride more enjoyable than novels twice the length.\n\nBy Joe Haldeman,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Accidental Time Machine as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNOW IN PAPERBACK-FROM THE AUTHOR OF MARSBOUND\n\nGrad- school dropout Matt Fuller is toiling as a lowly research assistant at MIT when he inadvertently creates a time machine.
