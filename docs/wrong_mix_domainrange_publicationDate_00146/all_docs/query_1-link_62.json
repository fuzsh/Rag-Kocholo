        "text": "Edge.org was launched in 1996 as the online version of \"The Reality Club\" and as a living document on the Web to display the activities of \"The Third Culture.\"\n\nTHE REALITY CLUB\n\nThe Reality Club was an informal gathering of intellectuals who met from 1981 to 1996 in Chinese restaurants, artist lofts, investment banking firms, ballrooms, museums, living rooms and elsewhere. Reality Club members presented their work with the understanding that they will be challenged. The hallmark of The Reality club has been rigorous and sometimes impolite (but not ad hominem) discourse. The motto of the Club was inspired by the late artist-philosopher James Lee Byars: \"To arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves.\"\n\nI met Byars in 1969 when he sought me out after the publication of my first book, By the Late John Brockman. We were both in the art world, we shared an interest in language, in the uses of the interrogative, in avoiding the anesthesiology of wisdom, and in \"the Steins\"—Einstein, Gertrude Stein, Wittgenstein, and Frankenstein (\"the shtick of the Steins\"). In 1971, our dialogue (\"Jimmie and Johnny\"), informed the creation by James Lee of The World Question Center.\n\nJames Lee Byars (1932-1997), Founder of The World Question Center\n\nI wrote the following about his project at the time of his death in Egypt in 1977:\n\nJames Lee inspired the idea that led to the Reality Club (and subsequently to Edge), and is responsible for the motto of the club. He believed that to arrive at an axiology of societal knowledge it was pure folly to go to a Widener Library and read 6 million volumes of books. (In this regard he kept only four books at a time in a box in his minimally furnished room, replacing books as he read them.) This led to his creation of the World Question Center in which he planned to gather the 100 most brilliant minds in the world together in a room, lock them behind closed doors, and have them ask each other the questions they were asking themselves.\n\nThe expected result, in theory, was to be a synthesis of all thought. But between idea and execution are many pitfalls. James Lee identified his 100 most brilliant minds (a few of them have graced the pages of this Site), called each of them, and asked what questions they were asking themselves. The result: 70 people hung up on him.\n\nThat was in 1971. New technologies = new perceptions. Email, the Web, mobile devices, social media, today allow for a serious implementation of Jimmy Lee's grand design. Though the venue is now online, the spirit of the Reality Club lives on in the lively back-and-forth discussions on the hot-button ideas driving the discussion today.\n\n\"To arrive at the edge of the world's knowledge, seek out the most complex and sophisticated minds, put them in a room together, and have them ask each other the questions they are asking themselves.\"\n\nAs James Lee said: \"To accomplish the extraordinary, you must seek extraordinary people.\" At the centre of every Edge project are remarkable people and remarkable minds— scientists, artists, philosophers, technologists and entrepreneurs who are at the center of today's intellectual, technological, and scientific landscape. They are representative of The Third Culture I wrote about in \"The Emerging Third Culture,\" a 1991 essay, and a book, The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution, published in 1995.\n\nTHE THIRD CULTURE\n\nThe third culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\n\nIt is a large enough umbrella to also include the \"digerati,\" the doers, thinkers, and writers, connected in ways they may not even appreciate, who have tremendous influence on the emerging communication revolution surrounding the growth of the Internet and the Web.\n\nEdge is a living document on the Web that displays \"the third culture\" in action. The \"content\" of Edge is the group of people who connect in this way. Edge is a conversation.\n\nThe ideas presented on Edge are speculative; they represent the frontiers of knowledge in the areas of evolutionary biology, genetics, computer science, neurophysiology, psychology, and physics. Some of the fundamental questions posed are: Where did the universe come from? Where did life come from? Where did the mind come from? Emerging out of the third culture is a new natural philosophy, founded on the realization of the import of complexity, of evolution. Very complex systems,, whether organisms, brains, the biosphere, or the universe itself, were not constructed by design; all have evolved.\n\nThere is a new set of metaphors to describe ourselves, our minds, the universe, and all of the things we know in it, and it is the intellectuals with these new ideas and images, those scientists and others doing things and writing their own books, who drive our times.\n\nThe third culture consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\n\nThrough the years, Edge has had a simple criterion for choosing contributors. We look for people whose creative work has expanded our notion of who and what we are. A few are bestselling authors or are famous in the mass culture. Most are not. Rather, we encourage work on the cutting edge of the culture, and the investigation of ideas that have not been generally exposed. We are interested in \"thinking smart\"; we are not interested in received \"wisdom.\" In communications theory information is not defined as data or input but rather as \"a difference that makes a difference.'' It is this level we hope our contributors will achieve.\n\nEdge encourages people who can take the materials of the culture in the arts, literature, and science and put them together in their own way. We live in a mass-produced culture where many people, even many established cultural arbiters limit themselves to secondhand ideas, thoughts, and opinions. Edge consists of individuals who create their own reality and do not accept an ersatz, appropriated reality. The Edge community consists of people who are out there doing it rather than talking about and analyzing the people who are doing it.\n\nEdge bears resemblance to the early seventeenth-century Invisible College, a precursor to the Royal Society. Its members consisted of scientists such as Robert Boyle, John Wallis, and Robert Hooke. The Society's common theme was to acquire knowledge through experimental investigation. Another inspiration is The Lunar Society of Birmingham, an informal club of the leading cultural figures of the new industrial age — James Watt, Erasmus Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood, Joseph Priestley, and Benjamin Franklin. While different than the Algonquin Roundtable or Bloomsbury Group, Edge offers the same quality of intellectual adventure.\n\nIn the words of the novelist Ian McEwan, edge.org is \"open-minded, free-ranging, intellectually playful… an unadorned pleasure in curiosity, a collective expression of wonder at the living and inanimate world… an ongoing and thrilling colloquium.\"\n\nAt the end of the year in 1999, for the first anniversary edition of Edge, I asked a number of the \"Edgies\" to use the interrogative. I asked \"the most subtle sensibilities in the world what question they are asking themselves.\" We've been doing it annually ever since.\n\nI work with three of the original Edgies who year in and year out provide the core sounding board for the ideas and information we present to the public. I refer to them in private correspondence as \"The Council.\" Every year, beginning late summer, I consult with Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and George Dyson, and together we create the Edge Annual Question that Edge has been asking for the past fourteen years.\n\nStewart Brand is the founder and editor of Whole Earth Catalog and author of Whole Earth Discipline; Kevin Kelly helped to launch Wired in 1993 and is the author of Out of Control and What Technology Wants; and George Dyson, a science historian, is the author of Darwin Among the Machines and Turing's Cathedral. This year, Laurie Santos, Associate Prefessor of Psychology, and Director of the Comparative Cognition Library at Yale, became involved, adding to the mix her keen intellect as well as a wide range of contacts among the leading thinkers of her generation.\n\nGeorge Dyson, Stewart Brand, John Brockman, Kevin Kelly\n\nIt's not easy coming up with a question. James Lee, used to say: \"I can answer the question, but am I bright enough to ask it?\" We are looking for questions that inspire answers we can't possibly predict. Our goal is to provoke people into thinking thoughts that they normally might not have.\n\nWe pay a lot of attention to framing the question and soliciting early responses from individuals who can set a high bar. This is critical. These responses seed the site and challenge and encourage the wider group to think in surprising ways. The conversation goes on, and on, for weeks, then months, as we widen the circle and invite more Edgies in to test the question under consideration and hear new ideas. Twice, at the very last minute, an idea pops up, so obviously right that we scrap months of work and just go with it.\n\nThis was the case with research psychologist Steven Pinker's 2012 question: \"What Is Your Favorite Deep, Elegant, Or Beautiful Explanation?\", and with theoretical psychologist Nicholas Humphrey's 2005 question \"What Do You Believe Is True Even Though You Cannot Prove It?\", which earned him the title of \"Edge Question Laureate\", and about which BBC4 Radio noted: \"Fantastically stimulating...It's like the crack cocaine of the thinking world.... Once you start, you can't stop thinking about that question.\"\n\nThe online publication of the annual question occurs in mid-January, and in recent years it is followed in a little more than a year by a printed book. Last year we worried about worrying by asking\"What Should We Be Worried About?\". This year's question comes out of \"HeadCon 13\" What's New In Social Science\", a two-day Edge seminar that took place in September last year. At one point, psychologist Laurie Santos mentioned to the group that she was interested in why there was no mechanism in social science for retiring ideas in order to make room for new initiatives.\n\nA lively discussion followed and it became quickly picked that Santos was on to a possible Edge Question. After two weeks of intense conversations, several Edgies expressed concern that the danger with a question about retiring ideas is that the responses could go negative and that some might see it as an invitation to trash rivals. Others pointed out that this is the case every year, that no matter what question is asked. We decided to go with the question after one Edgie emailed the following comment which tipped the balance: \"Science is argument, not advertising.\"\n\nI am pleased to present the Edge Question 2014, asked by Laurie Santos.\n\nEverything? Well, wait a minute. Questioning A Theory of Everything may be beating a dead horse since I’m certainly not the first to be bothered by its implicit hyperbole but let’s face it, referring to one’s field of study as The Theory of Everything smacks of arrogance and naivité. Although it’s only been around for a relatively short period and may already be dying a natural death, the phrase, though certainly not the endeavour, should be retired from serious scientific literature and discourse.\n\nLet me elaborate. The search for grand syntheses, for commonalities, regularities, ideas and concepts that transcend the narrow confines of specific problems or disciplines is one of the great inspirational drivers of science and scientists. Arguably, it is also a defining characteristic of homo sapiens sapiens. Perhaps the binomial form of sapiens is some distorted poetic recognition of this. Like the invention of gods and God, the concept of A Theory of Everything connotes the grandest vision of all, the inspiration of all inspirations, namely that we can encapsulate and understand the entirety of the universe in a small set of precepts, in this case, a concise set of mathematical equations. Like the concept of God, however, it is potentially misleading and intellectually dangerous.\n\nAmong the classic grand syntheses in science are Newton’s laws, that taught us that heavenly laws were no different than the earthly, Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism, that brought the ephemeral aether into our lives, Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which reminded us that we’re just animals and plants after all, and the laws of thermodynamics that suggest we can’t go on forever. Each of these has had profound consequences not only in changing the way we think about the world, but also in laying the foundations for technological advancements that have led to the standard of living many of us are privileged to enjoy.

This is in stark contrast to here on earth where we are integral to some of the most diverse, complex and messy phenomena that occur anywhere in the universe, and which require additional, possibly non-mathematisable concepts, to understand. So, while applauding and admiring the search for a Grand Unified Theory of all the basic forces of nature, let’s drop the implication that it can, in principle, explain and predict Everything. Let us instead incorporate a parallel quest for A Grand Unified Theory of Complexity. The challenge of developing a quantitative, analytic, principled, predictive framework for understanding complex adaptive systems is surely a grand challenge for the 21st Century.

Well, wait a minute. Questioning A Theory of Everything may be beating a dead horse since I’m certainly not the first to be bothered by its implicit hyperbole but let’s face it, referring to one’s field of study as The Theory of Everything smacks of arrogance and naivité. Although it’s only been around for a relatively short period and may already be dying a natural death, the phrase, though certainly not the endeavour, should be retired from serious scientific literature and discourse.\n\nLet me elaborate. The search for grand syntheses, for commonalities, regularities, ideas and concepts that transcend the narrow confines of specific problems or disciplines is one of the great inspirational drivers of science and scientists. Arguably, it is also a defining characteristic of homo sapiens sapiens. Perhaps the binomial form of sapiens is some distorted poetic recognition of this. Like the invention of gods and God, the concept of A Theory of Everything connotes the grandest vision of all, the inspiration of all inspirations, namely that we can encapsulate and understand the entirety of the universe in a small set of precepts, in this case, a concise set of mathematical equations. Like the concept of God, however, it is potentially misleading and intellectually dangerous.\n\nAmong the classic grand syntheses in science are Newton’s laws, that taught us that heavenly laws were no different than the earthly, Maxwell’s unification of electricity and magnetism, that brought the ephemeral aether into our lives, Darwin’s theory of natural selection, which reminded us that we’re just animals and plants after all, and the laws of thermodynamics that suggest we can’t go on forever.

Like all grand syntheses, it will inevitably remain incomplete but nevertheless will undoubtedly inspire significant, possibly revolutionary, new ideas, concepts, and techniques.\n\nThe idea to be abandoned is the idea that there is no reality in the quantum world. The idea probably came about because of two reasons. On the one hand, because of the fact that one cannot always ascribe a precise value to a physical property, and on the other hand, because within the wide spectrum of interpretations of quantum mechanics some suggest that the quantum state does not describe an external reality, but rather that the properties only come about in the mind of the observer and therefore that consciousness plays a crucial role.\n\nLet us consider for a second the famous double-slit experiment. Such experiments or their equivalents have to date not only been performed with single photons or any other kind of single particles, like neutrons, protons, electrons etc., but even with very large macromolecules, such as buckyballs and even larger. Specifically we do the experiment with buckyballs—the C-60 or C-70 molecules. You have two slits and under the right experimental conditions, you observe a distribution of the buckyballs behind the slits which has maxima and minima, the interference pattern. This is due to interference of the probability waves passing through both slits. But, following Einstein in his famous debate with Niels Bohr, we might ask if we do the experiment with individual particles, individual buckballs one by one: Through which slit does an individual buckyball molecule pass? Would it not be natural to assume that every particle has to pass either slit? Quantum physics tells us that this is not a meaningful question. We cannot assign a well-defined position to the particle unless we actually perform an experiment which allows us to find out where it is. So, before we do the measurement, the position of the buckyball—and therefore the slit it passes through—is a concept devoid of any meaning.\n\nSuppose we now measure the position of the particle. Then we get an answer and know where it is. It is either near one slit or near the other slit. In that case, position is certainly an element of reality, and we can clearly say that quantum physics describes this reality. What is interesting is that having precise knowledge of one feature, namely the position, another kind of knowledge, namely the one encoded in the interference pattern, is not well-defined anymore.\n\nWhere could consciousness come in here? Quantum mechanics tells us that the particle, before any observation, is in a superposition of passing through one slit and of passing through the other slit. If we now have two detectors, one each behind each slit, then either detector will register the particle. But quantum mechanics tells us that the measurement apparatus becomes entangled with the position observable of the particle, and thus itself does not have well-defined classical features, at least in principle. This, following the Hungarian-American Nobel prize winner Eugene Wigner, is a chain which can be followed until an observer registers the result. So if we would adopt that reasoning, it is the consciousness which would make reality happen.\n\nBut you don't have to go so far. It is enough to assume that quantum mechanics just describes probabilities of possible measurement results. Then making an observation turns potentiality into actuality and, in our case, the position of the particle becomes a quantity one can talk reasonably about. But, whether it has a well-defined position or not, the buckyball very well exists. It is real in the double-slit experiment, even when it is impossible to assign its position a well-defined value.\n\nIf one views science as an economist, it would stand to reason that the scientific theory that should be first retired would be the one that offers the greatest opportunity for arbitrage in the market place of ideas. Thus it is not sufficient to look for ideas which are merely wrong, as we should instead look for troubled scientific ideas that block progress by inspiring zeal, devotion, and what biologists politely term 'interference competition' all out of proportion to their history of achievement. Here it is hard to find a better candidate for an intellectual bubble than that which has formed around the quest for a consistent theory of everything physical, reinterpreted as if it were synonymous with 'quantum gravity'. If nature were trying to send a polite message that there is other preliminary work to be done first before we quantize gravity, it is hard to see how she could send a clearer message than dashing the Nobel dreams for two successive generations of Bohr's brilliant descendants.\n\nTo recall, modern physics rests on a stool with three classical geometric legs first fashioned individually by Einstein, Maxwell, and Dirac. The last two of those legs can be together retrofitted to a quantum theory of force and matter known as the 'standard model', while the first stubbornly resists any such attempt at an upgrade, rendering the semi-quantum stool unstable and useless. It is from this that the children of Bohr have derived the need to convert the children of Einstein to the quantum religion at all costs so that the stool can balance.\n\nBut, to be fair to those who insist that Einstein must be now made to bow to Bohr, the most strident of those enthusiasts have offered a fair challenge. Quantum exceptionalists claim, despite an unparalleled history of non-success, that string theory (now rebranded as M-theory for matrix, magic or membrane) remains literally 'the only game in town' because fundamental physics has gotten so hard that no one can think of a credible alternate unification program. If we are to dispel this as a canard, we must make a good faith effort to answer the challenge by providing interesting alternatives, lest we be left with nothing at all.\n\nMy reason for believing that there is a better route to the truth is that we have, out of what seems to be misplaced love for our beloved Einstein, been too reverential to the exact form of general relativity. For example, if before retrofitting we look closely at the curvature and geometry of the legs, we can see something striking, in that they are subtly incompatible at a classical geometric level before any notion of a quantum is introduced. Einstein's leg seems the sparest and sturdiest as it clearly shows the attention to function found in the school of 'intrinsic geometry' founded by the German Bernhard Riemann. The Maxwell and Dirac legs are somewhat more festive and ornamented as they explore the freedom of form which is the raison d'etre for a more whimsical school of 'auxiliary geometry' pioneered by Alsatian Charles Ehresmann. This leads one naturally to a very different question: what if the quantum incompatibility of the existing theories is really a red herring with respect to unification and the real sticking point is a geometric conflict between the mathematicians Ehresmann and Riemann rather than an incompatibility between the physicists Einstein and Bohr? Even worse, it could be that none of the foundations are ready to be quantized. What if all three theories are subtly incomplete at a geometric level and that the quantum will follow once, and only once, all three are retired and replaced with a unified geometry?\n\nIf such an answer exists, it cannot be expected to be a generic geometric theory as all three of the existing theories are each, in some sense, the simplest possible in their respective domains. Such a unified approach might instead involve a new kind of mathematical toolkit combining elements of the two major geometric schools, which would only be relevant to physics if the observed world can be shown to be of a very particular subtype. Happily, with the discoveries of neutrino mass, non-trivial dark energy, and dark matter, the world we see looks increasingly to be of the special class that could accommodate such a hybrid theory.\n\nOne could go on in this way, but it is not the only interesting line of thinking. While, ultimately, there may be a single unified theory to summit, there are few such intellectual peaks that can only be climbed from one face. We thus need to return physics to its natural state of individualism so that independent researchers need not fear large research communities who, in the quest for mindshare and resources, would crowd out isolated rivals pursuing genuinely interesting inchoate ideas that head in new directions. Unfortunately it is difficult to responsibly encourage theorists without independent wealth to develop truly speculative theories in a community which has come to apply artificially strict standards to new programs and voices while letting M-theory stand, year after year, for mulligan and mañana.\n\nEstablished string theorists may, with a twinkle in the eye, shout, 'predictions!', 'falsifiability!' or 'peer review!' at younger competitors in jest. Yet potentially rival 'infant industry' research programs, as the saying goes, do not die in jest but in earnest. Given the history of scientific exceptionalism surrounding quantum gravity research, it is neither desirable nor necessary to retire M-theory explicitly, as it contains many fascinating ideas. Instead, one need only insist that the training wheels that were once customarily circulated to new entrants to reinvigorate the community, be transferred to emerging candidates from those who have now monopolized them for decades at a time. We can then wait at long last to see if 'the only game in town', when denied the luxury of special pleading by senior boosters, has the support from nature to stay upright.\n\nGordon Moore's 1965 paper stating that the number of transistors on integrated circuits will double every two years has become the most popular scientific analogy of the digital age. Despite being a mere conjecture it has become the go-to model to frame complex progress in a simple formula. There are good technological reasons to retire Moore's Law. For example the general consensus that Moore's Law will effectively cease to exist past a transistor size smaller than 5 nanometers. That would mean a peak and sharp drop-off in ten to twenty years. Another one is the potential of quantum computers pushing computing into new realms, expected to become reality in three to five years. But Moore's Law should be retired before its technological limits, because it has propelled the perception of progress into wrong directions. Allowing its end to become an event would just amplify the errors of reasoning.\n\nFirst and foremost Moore's Law has allowed to perceive the development of the digital era as a linear narrative. The simple curve of progression is the digital equivalent of the ancient wheat and chessboard problem (with a potentially infinite chessboard). Like the Persian inventor of the game of chess who demanded from the king a geometric progression of grains all across the board, digital technology seems to develop exponentially. This model ignores the parallel nature of digital progress, which encompasses not only technological or economic development, but scientific, social and political change. Changes that can rarely be quantified.\n\nStill the Moore's law model of perception has already found its way into the narrative of biotechnological history, where change become ever more complex. Proof of progress is claimed in the simplistic reasoning of a sharp decline in cost for sequencing a human genome from three billion Dollars in the year 2000 to the August 2013 cancellation of the Genomics X Prize for the first 1000 Dollar genome, because the challenge had been outpaced by innovation.\n\nFor both digital and biotechnical history the linear narrative has been insufficient. The prowess of the integrated circuit has been the technological spark to induce a massive development comparable with the wheel allowing the rise of urban society. Both technologies have been perfected over time, but their technological refinement falls short to illustrate the impact both had.\n\nIt is about 25 years ago that scientists at MIT's media lab told me about a paradigmatic change in computer technology. In the future, they said, the number of other computers connected to a computer will be more important than its number of transistors on its integrated circuits. For a writer interested but not part of the forefront of computer technology that was still groundbreaking news in 1988. A few years later the demo of a Mosaic browser was as formative as listening to the first Beatles record and seeing the first man on the moon had been for my parents.\n\nChange since have been so multilayered, interconnected and rapid that comprehension has lagged behind ever since. Scientific, social and political changes occur in random patterns. Results have been mixed in equally random patterns. The slowdown of the music industry and media has not been matched in the publishing industry and film. The failed twitter revolution of Iran had quite a few things in common with the Arab spring, but even in the Maghreb the results differed wildly. Social networks have impacted societies sometimes in exact opposites—while the fad of social networks have resulted in cultural and isolation in Western society, it has created a counterforce of collective communication against the strategies of the Chinese party apparatus to isolate its citizenry from within.\n\nMost of these phenomena have been only observed, not explained by now. It is mostly in hindsight that a linear narrative is constructed, if not imposed on. The inability of many of the greatest digital innovations like viral videos or social networks to be monetized are just one of many proofs how difficult it is to get a comprehensive grasp on digital history. Moore's law and its numerous popular applications to other fields of progress thus create an illusion of predictability in the least predictable of all fields—the course of history.\n\nThese errors of reasoning will be amplified, if Moore's Law is allowed to come to its natural end. Peak theories have become the lore of cultural pessimism. If Moore's law is allowed to become a finite principle, digital progress will be perceived as a linear progression towards a peak and an end. Neither will become a reality, because the digital is not a finite resource, but an infinite realm of mathematical possibilities reaching out into the analog world of sciences, society, economics and politics. Because this progress has ceased to depend on quantifiable basis and on linear narratives it will not be brought to a halt, not even slowed down, if one of its strains comes to an end.\n\nIn 1972 the wheat and chessboard problem became the mythological basis for the Club of Rome's Malthusian „The Limits to Growth\". Moore's will create the disillusionment of a finite nature of the digital. It will become as popular as its illusion of predictability.

After all there have bee no loonies carrying signs saying \"The End is Not Near\".\n\nIn the late summer of 1914, as European civilization began its extended suicide, dissenters were scarce. On the contrary: From every major capital, we have jerky newsreel footage of happy crowds, cheering in the summer sunshine. More war and oppression followed in subsequent decades, and there was never a shortage of willing executioners and obedient lackeys. By mid-century, the time of Stalin and Mao and their smaller-bore imitators, it seemed urgent to understand why people throughout the 20th century had failed to rise up against masters who sent them to war, or to concentration camps, or to the gulag. So social scientists came up with an answer, which was then consolidated and popularized into something every educated person supposedly knows: People are sheep—cowardly, deplorable sheep.\n\nThis idea, that most of us are unwilling to \"think for ourselves,\" instead preferring to stay out of trouble, obey the rules, and conform, was supposedly established by rigorous laboratory experiments. (\"We have found,\" wrote the great psychologist Solomon Asch in 1955, \"the tendency to conform in our society is so strong that reasonably intelligent and well-meaning young people are willing to call white black.\") Plenty of research papers still refer to one or another aspect of the sheep model as if it were a truth universally acknowledged, and a sturdy rock on which to build new hypotheses about mass behavior. Worse yet, it's rampant in the conversation of educate laypeople—politicians, voters, government officials. Yet it is false. It makes for bad assumptions and bad policies. It is time to set it aside.\n\nSome years ago, the psychologists Bert Hodges and Anne Geyer examined one of Asch's own experiments from the 1950s. He'd asked people to look at a line printed on a white card and then tell which of three similar lines was the same length. Each volunteer was sitting in a small group, all of whose other members were actually collaborators in the study, deliberately picking wrong answers. Asch reported that when the group chose the wrong match, many individuals went along, against the evidence of their own senses.\n\nBut the experiment actually involved 12 separate comparisons for each subject, and most did not agree with the majority, most of the time. In fact, on average, each person agreed three times with the majority, and insisted on his own view nine other times. To make those results all about the evils of conformity is to say, as Hodges and Geyer note, that \"an individual's moral obligation in the situation is to 'call it as he sees it' without consideration of what others say.''\n\nTo explain their actions, the volunteers didn't indicate that their senses had been warped or that they were terrified of going against consensus. Instead, they said they had chosen to go along that one time. It's not hard to see why a reasonable person would do so.\n\nThe \"people are sheep\" model sets us up to think in terms of obedience or defiance, dumb conformity versus solitary self-assertion (to avoid being a sheep, you must be a lone wolf). It does not recognize that people need to place their trust in others, and win the trust of others, and that this guides their behavior. (Stanley Milgram's famous experiments, where men were willing to give severe shocks to a supposed stranger, are often cited as Exhibit A for the \"people are sheep\" model. But what these studies really tested was the trust the subjects had in the experimenter.)\n\nIndeed, questions about trust in others—how it is won and kept, who wins it and who doesn't—seem to be essential to understanding how collectives of people operate, and affect their members. What else is at work?\n\nIt appears that behavior is also susceptible to the sort of moment-by-moment influences that were once considered irrelevant noise (for example, divinity students in a rush were far less likely to help a stranger than were divinity students who were not late, in an experiment performed by John M. Darley and Dan Batson). And then there is mounting evidence of influences that discomfit psychologists because there doesn't seem to be much psychology in them at all. For example, Neil Johnson of the University of Miami and Michael Spagat of University College London and their colleagues have found the severity and timing of attacks in many different wars (different actors, different stakes, different cultures, different continents) adheres to a power law. If that's true, then an individual fighter's motivation, ideology, and beliefs make much less difference than we think for the decision to attack next Tuesday.\n\nOr, to take another example, if as Nicholas Christakis' work suggests, your risks of smoking, getting an STD, catching the flu or being obese depend in part on your social network ties, then how much difference does it make what you, as an individual, feel or think?\n\nPerhaps the behavior of people in groups will eventually be explained as a combination of moment-to-moment influences (like waves on the sea) and powerful drivers that work outside of awareness (like deep ocean currents). All the open questions are important and fascinating. But they're only visible after we give up the simplistic notion that we are sheep.\n\nThe roots of this issue go back at least to 1865, when Rudolf Clausius coined the term \"entropy\" and stated that the entropy of the universe tends to a maximum. This idea is now known as the second law of thermodynamics, which is most often described by saying that the entropy of an isolated system always increases or stays constant, but never decreases. Isolated systems tend to evolve toward the state of maximum entropy, the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Even though entropy will play a crucial role in this discussion, it will suffice to use a fairly crude definition: entropy is a measure of the \"disorder\" of the physical system. In terms of the underlying quantum description, entropy is a measure of the number of quantum states that correspond to a given description in terms of macroscopic variables, such as temperature, volume, and density.\n\nThe classic example is a gas in a closed box. If we start with all the gas molecules in a corner of the box, we can imagine watching what happens next. The gas molecules will fill the box, increasing the entropy to the maximum. But it never goes the other way: if the gas molecules fill the box, we will never see them spontaneously collect into one corner.\n\nThis behavior seems very natural, but it is hard to reconcile with our understanding of the underlying laws of physics. The gas makes a huge distinction between the past and the future, always evolving toward larger entropy in the future. This one-way behavior of matter in bulk is called the \"arrow of time.\" Nonetheless, the microscopic laws that describe collisions of molecules are time-symmetric, making no distinction between past and future.\n\nAny movie of a collision could be played backwards, and it would also show a valid picture of a collision. (To account for some very rare events discovered by particle physicists, the movie is only guaranteed to be valid if it is also reflected in a mirror and has every particle relabeled as the corresponding antiparticle. But these complications do not change the key issue.)\n\nThere is an important problem, therefore, which is over a century old, to understand how the arrow of time could possibly arise from time-symmetric laws of evolution.\n\nThe arrow-of-time mystery has driven physicists to seek possible causes within the laws of physics that we observe, but to no avail. The laws make no distinction between the past and the future. Physicists have understood, however, that a low entropy state is always likely to evolve into a higher entropy state, simply because there are many more states of higher entropy. Thus, the entropy today is higher than the entropy yesterday, because yesterday the universe was in a low entropy state. And it was in a low entropy state yesterday, because the day before it was in an even lower entropy state. The traditional understanding follows this pattern back to the origin of the universe, attributing the arrow of time to some not well-understood property of cosmic initial conditions, which created the universe in a special low entropy state. As Brian Greene wrote in The Fabric of the Cosmos:\n\n\"The ultimate source of order, of low entropy, must be the big bang itself. ... The egg splatters rather than unsplatters because it is carrying forward the drive toward higher entropy that was initiated by the extraordinarily low entropy state with which the universe began.\"\n\nBased on an elaboration of a 2004 proposal by Sean Carroll and Jennifer Chen, there is a possibility of a new solution to the age-old problem of the arrow of time. This work, by Sean Carroll, Chien-Yao Tseng, and me, is still in the realm of speculation, and has not yet been vetted by the scientific community.\n\nBut it seems to provide a very attractive alternative to the standard picture. The standard picture holds that the initial conditions for the universe must have produced a special, low entropy state, because it is needed to explain the arrow of time. (No such assumption is applied to the final state, so the arrow of time is introduced through a time-asymmetric condition.) We argue, to the contrary, that the arrow of time can be explained without assuming a special initial state, so there is no longer any motivation for the hypothesis that the universe began in a state of extraordinarily low entropy. The most attractive feature is that there is no longer a need to introduce any assumptions that violate the time symmetry of the known laws of physics.\n\nThe basic idea is simple. We don't really know if the maximum possible entropy for the universe is finite or infinite, so let's assume that it is infinite. Then, no matter what entropy the universe started with, the entropy would have been low compared to its maximum. That is all that is needed to explain why the entropy has been rising ever since!\n\nThe metaphor of the gas in a box is replaced by a gas with no box. In the context of what physicists call a \"toy model,\" meant to illustrate a basic principle without trying to be otherwise realistic, we can imagine choosing, in a random and time-symmetric way, an initial state for a gas composed of some finite number of noninteracting particles. It is important here that any well-defined state will have a finite value for the entropy, and a finite value for the maximum distance of any particle from the origin of our coordinate system. If such a system is followed into the future, the particles might move inward or outward for some finite time, but ultimately the inward-moving particles will pass the central region and will start moving outward. All particles will eventually be moving outward, and the gas will continue indefinitely to expand into the infinite space, with the entropy rising without limit. An arrow of time—the steady growth of entropy with time—has been generated, without introducing any time-asymmetric assumptions.\n\nAn interesting feature of this picture is that the universe need not have a beginning, but could be continued from where we started in both directions of time. Since the laws of evolution and the initial state are time-symmetric, the past will be statistically equivalent to the future. Observers in the deep past will see the arrow of time in the opposite direction from ours, but their experience will be no different from ours.\n\nThe year 2013 has just finished and, as is the case at this time of year, media pundits suggest a variety of words and terms that should be banned; some of the most common ones have included, \"YOLO,\" \"bromance,\" \"selfie,\" \"mancave,\" and, of course, please God make it so, \"twerking.\" In these cases, it's not because the terms are wrong, but just because they've become ubiquitous and irritating.\n\nSimilarly, some things in the science world beg to be retired. That's rarely the case simply because a term has been ubiquitous and irritating. \"Genomic revolution\" might be one of those. Another might be, \"For 99% of hominid history…,\" when discussing what humans do in a less artificial setting than our modern world. Personally, I hope this phrase won't be retired, as I use it ubiquitously and irritatingly, with no plans to stop otherwise.\n\nHowever, various science concepts should be retired because they are just plain wrong. An obvious example, more pseudo-science than science, is that evolution is \"just\" a theory. But what I am focusing on is a phrase that is right in the narrow sense, but carries very wrong connotations. This is the idea of \"a gene-environment interaction.\"\n\nThe notion of the effects of a particular gene and of a particular environment interacting was a critical counter to the millennia-old dichotomy of nature versus nurture. Its utility in that realm most often took the form of, \"It may not be all genetic—don't forget that there may be a gene-environment interaction,\" rather than, \"It may not be all environmental—don't forget that there may be a gene-environmental interaction.\"\n\nThe concept was especially useful when expressed quantitatively, in the face of behavior geneticist's attempts to attribute percentages of variability in a trait to environment versus to genes. It also was the basis of a useful rule of thumb phrase for non-scientists – \"But only if.\" \"You can often say that Gene A causes Effect X, although sometimes it is more correct to say that Gene A causes Effect X, 'but only if' it is in Environment Z. In that case, you have something called a gene-environment interaction.\"\n\nWhat's wrong with any of that? It's an incalculably large improvement over \"nature or nurture?\", especially when a supposed answer to that question has gotten into the hands of policy makers or ideologues.\n\nMy problem with the concept is with the particularist use of \"a\" gene-environment interaction, the notion that there can be one. This is because, at the most benign, this implies that there can be cases where there aren't gene-environment interactions. Worse, that those cases are in the majority. Worst, the notion that lurking out there is something akin to a Platonic ideal as to every gene's actions—that any given gene has an idealized effect, that it consistently \"does\" that, and that circumstances where that does not occur are rare and represent either pathological situations or inconsequential specialty acts. Thus, a particular gene may have a Platonically \"normal\" effect on intelligence unless, of course, the individual was protein malnourished as a fetus, had untreated phenylketonuria, or was raised as a wild child by meerkats.\n\nThe problem with \"a\" gene-environment interaction is that there is no gene that does something. It only has a particular effect in a particular environment, and to say that a gene has a consistent effect in every environment is really only to say that it has a consistent effect in all the environments in which it has been studied to date. This has become ever more clear in studies of the genetics of behavior, as there has been increasing appreciation of environmental regulation of epigenetics, transcription factors, splicing factors, and so on. And this is most dramatically pertinent to humans, given the extraordinary range of environments—both natural and culturally constructed—in which we live.\n\nThe problem with \"a gene-environment interaction\" is the same as asking what height has to do with the area of a rectangle, and being told that in this particular case, there is a height/length interaction.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, scientific thought was dominated by the idea of the uniformity of the universe and the uniqueness of laws of physics. Indeed, the cosmological observations indicated that the universe on the largest possible scales is almost exactly uniform, with the accuracy better than 1 in 10,000.\n\nThe situation is similar with respect to the uniqueness of the laws of physics. We knew, for example, that the electron mass is the same everywhere in the observable part of the universe, so the obvious assumption was that it must take the same value everywhere—that it was just a constant of nature. For a long time, one of the great goals of physics was to find a single theory—a Theory of Everything— that would unify all fundamental interactions and provide an unambiguous explanation for all known parameters of particle physics.\n\nSome thirty years ago, a possible explanation arose for the uniformity of the universe. The main idea was that our part of the world emerged as a result of an exponentially rapid stretching of space called cosmic inflation. As all \"wrinkles\" and non-uniformities of space stretched out and disappeared, the universe became incredibly smooth. Add some quantum fluctuations, stretch them, and the uniformity became just a little bit less perfect, and galaxies emerged.\n\nAt first, inflationary theory looked like an exotic product of vivid imagination. But thanks to the enthusiastic work of thousands of scientists, many predictions of this theory have been confirmed by observations. And if the theory is correct, we finally have a scientific explanation of why the world is so uniform.\n\nBut inflation does not predict that this uniformity must extend beyond the observable part of the universe. To give an analogy: Suppose the universe is a surface of a big soccer ball consisting of black and white hexagons. If we inflate it, the size of each white or black part becomes exponentially large. If inflation is powerful enough, those who live in a black part of the universe will not ever see the white part. They will believe that the whole universe is black, and they will try to find a scientific explanation why it cannot have any other color. Those who live in a white universe will never see the black parts and therefore they may think that the whole world must be white. But both black and white parts may coexist in an inflationary universe without contradicting observations.\n\nIn the example given above, we were talking about black and white. But in physics, the number of different states of matter (the number of \"colors\") can be exponentially large. The best candidate for a Theory of Everything is string theory. It can be successfully formulated in spacetime with ten dimensions (nine dimensions of space and one of time). But we live in the universe with three dimensions of space. Where are other six? The answer is that they are compactified—squeezed into something so small that we cannot move in these directions, which is why we perceive the world as if it were three-dimensional.\n\nFrom the early days of string theory, physicists knew that there are exponentially many different ways to compactly the extra 6 dimensions, but we did not know what can prevent the compactified dimensions from blowing up. This problem was solved about 10 years ago, and the solution validated the earlier expectations of the exponentially large number of possibilities. Some estimates of the number of different options are as large as 10500. And each of these options describes a part of the universe with a different vacuum energy and different types of matter.\n\nIn the context of the inflationary theory, this means that our world may consist of incredibly large number of exponentially large \"universes\" with 10500 different types of matter inside them.\n\nA pessimist would argue that since we do not see other parts of the universe, we cannot prove that this picture is correct. An optimist, on the other hand, may counter that we can never disprove this picture either, because its main assumption is that other \"universes\" are far away from us. And since we know that the best of the theories developed so far allow about 10500 different universes, anybody who argues that the universe must have same properties everywhere would have to prove that only one of these 10500 universes is possible.\n\nAnd then there is something else: There are many strange coincidences in our world. The mass of the electron is 2000 times smaller than the mass of the proton. Why? The only known reason is that if it would change few times, life as we know it would be impossible. The masses of the proton and neutron almost coincide. Why? If one of their masses would change just a little, life as we know it would be impossible. The energy of empty space in our part of the universe is not zero, but a tiny number, more than 100 orders of magnitude below the naive theoretical expectations. Why? The only known explanation is that we would be unable to live in the world with a much larger energy of vacuum.\n\nThe correlation between our properties and the properties of the world is called the anthropic principle. But if the universe came in only one copy, this correlation would not explain why. We would need to speculate about the divine cause making the universe custom-built for humans. However, with a multiverse consisting of many different parts with different properties, the correlation between our properties and the properties of the part of the world where we can live makes perfect sense.\n\nCan we return back to the old picture of a single universe? Possibly. But in order to do so, we must (1) invent a better cosmological theory, (2) invent a better theory of fundamental interactions, and (3) propose an alternative explanation for the miraculous coincidences we just discussed.\n\nRace has always been a vague and slippery concept. In the mid-eighteenth century, European naturalists such as Linnaeus, Comte de Buffon, and Johannes Blumenbach described geographic groupings of humans who differed in appearance. The philosophers David Hume and Immanuel Kant both were fascinated by human physical diversity. In their opinions, extremes of heat, cold, or sunlight extinguished human potential. Writing in 1748, Hume contended that, \"there was never a civilized nation of any complexion other than white.\"\n\nKant felt similarly. He was preoccupied with questions of human diversity throughout his career, and wrote at length on the subject in a series of essays beginning in 1775. Kant was the first to name and define the geographic groupings of humans as races (in German, Rassen). Kant's races were characterized by physical distinctions of skin color, hair form, cranial shape, and other anatomical features and by their capacity for morality, self-improvement, and civilization. Kant's four races were arranged hierarchically, with only the European race, in his estimation, being capable of self-improvement.\n\nWhy did the scientific racism of Hume and Kant prevail in the face of the logical and thoughtful opposition of von Herder and others? During his lifetime, Kant was recognized as a great philosopher, and his status rose as copies of his major philosophical works were distributed and read widely in the nineteenth century. Some of Kant's supporters agreed with his racist views, some apologized for them, or—most commonly—many just ignored them. The other reason that racist views triumphed over anti-racism in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was that racism was, economically speaking, good for the transatlantic slave trade, which had become the overriding engine of European economic growth. The slave trade was bolstered by ideologies that diminished or denied the humanity of non-Europeans, especially Africans. Such views were augmented by newer biblical interpretations popular at the time that depicted Africans as destined for servitude. Skin color, as the most noticeable racial characteristic, became associated with a nebulous assemblage of opinions and hearsay about the inherent natures of the different races. Skin color stood for morality, character, and the capacity for civilization; it had become a meme. The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the rise of \"race science.\" The biological reality of races was confirmed by new types of scientific evidence amassed by new types of scientists, notably anthropologists and geneticists. This era witnessed the birth of eugenics and its offspring, the concept of racial purity. The rise of Social Darwinism further reinforced the notion that the superiority of the white race was part of the natural order. The fact that all people are products of complex genetic mixtures resulting from migration and intermingling over thousands of years was not admitted by the racial scientists, nor by the scores of eugenicists who campaigned on both sides of the Atlantic for the improvement of racial quality.\n\nThe mid-twentieth century witnessed the continued proliferation of scientific treatises on race. By the 1960s, however, two factors contributed to the demise of the concept of biological races. One of these was the increased rate of study of the physical and genetic diversity human groups all over the world by large numbers of scientists. The second factor was the increasing influence of the civil rights movement in the United States and elsewhere. Before long, influential scientists denounced studies of race and races because races themselves could not be scientifically defined. Where scientists looked for sharp boundaries between groups, none could be found.\n\nDespite major shifts in scientific thinking, the sibling concepts of human races and a color-based hierarchy of races remained firmly established in mainstream culture through the mid-twentieth century. The resulting racial stereotypes were potent and persistent, especially in the United States and South Africa, where subjugation and exploitation of dark-skinned labor had been the cornerstone of economic growth.\n\nAfter its \"scientific\" demise, race remained as a name and concept, but gradually came to stand for something quite different. Today many people identify with the concept of being a member of one or another racial group, regardless of what science may say about the nature of race. The shared experiences of race create powerful social bonds. For many people, including many scholars, races cease to be biological categories and have become social groupings. The concept of race became a more confusing mélange as social categories of class and ethnicity. So race isn't \"just\" a social construction, it is the real product of shared experience, and people choose to identify themselves by race.\n\nClinicians continue to map observed patterns of health and disease onto old racial concepts such as \"White\", \"Black\" or \"African American\", \"Asian,\" etc. Even after it has been shown that many diseases (adult-onset diabetes, alcoholism, high blood pressure, to name a few) show apparent racial patterns because people share similar environmental conditions, grouping by race are maintained. The use of racial self-categorization in epidemiological studies is defended and even encouraged. In most cases, race in medical studies is confounded with health disparities due to class, ethnic differences in social practices, and attitudes, all of which become meaningless when sufficient variables are taken into account.\n\nRace's latest makeover arises from genomics and mostly within biomedical contexts. The sanctified position of medical science in the popular consciousness gives the race concept renewed esteem. Racial realists marshal genomic evidence to support the hard biological reality of racial difference, while racial skeptics see no racial patterns. What is clear is that people are seeing what they want to see. They are constructing studies to provide the outcomes they expect. In 2012, Catherine Bliss argued cogently that race today is best considered a belief system that \"produces consistencies in perception and practice at a particular social and historical moment\".\n\nRace has a hold on history, but it no longer has a place in science. The sheer instability and potential for misinterpretation render race useless as a scientific concept. Inventing new vocabularies of human diversity and inequity won't be easy, but is necessary.\n\nGenes and their interaction networks determine the phenotype of an organism—what it looks like and how it behaves. One of the biggest problems in modern evolutionary biology is understanding the relationship between genes and phenotypes. The prevailing theory is that all animals are built from essentially the same set of regulatory genes—a genetic toolkit, and that phenotypic variation within and between species arises simply by using shared genes differently. Scientists are now generating a vast amount of genomic data from an eclectic mix of organisms. These data are telling us to put to bed the idea that all life is underlain by a common toolkit of conserved genes. Instead, we need to turn our attention to the role of genomic novelty in the evolution of phenotypic diversity and innovation.\n\nThe idea of a conserved genetic toolkit of life comes from the 'evo-devo' (evolutionary and developmental biology) world. In short, it proposes that evolution uses the same ingredients in all organisms, but tinkers with the recipe. By expressing genes at different times in development and/or in different parts of the body, the same genes can be used in different combinations to allow evolvability, generating phenotypic diversity and innovation. Animals look different not because the molecular machinery is different, but because different parts of the machinery are activated to differing degrees, at different times, in different places and in different combinations. The number of combinations is huge, and so this is a plausible explanation for the development of complex and diverse phenotypes from even a small number of genes. For example, humans have a mere 21,000 genes in our genome, and yet we are arguably one of the most complex products of evolution.\n\nA text-book example is the super-controller of development, Hox genes—a set of genes which tell bodies where to develop heads, tails, arms, legs, in every major animal group. Hox genes are in mice, worms, humans… they are inherited from a common ancestor. Other examples of toolkt genes are those that control eye development, or hair/plumage colouration. Toolkit genes are old, present in all animals and they do pretty much the same thing in all animals. There is no denying that conserved genomic material forms an important part of the molecular building blocks of life.\n\nHowever. We can now sequence de novo the genomes and transcriptomes (the genes expressed at any one time/place) of any organism. We have sequence data for algae, pythons, green sea turtles, puffer fish, pied flycatchers, platypus, koala, bonobos, giant pandas, bottle-nosed dolphins, leafcutter ants, monarch butterfly, pacific oysters, leeches…the list is growing exponentially. And each new genome brings with it a suit of unique genes. Twenty percent of genes in nematodes are unique. Each lineage of ants contains about 4000 novel genes, but only 64 of these are conserved across all seven ant genomes sequenced so far.\n\nMany of these unique ('novel') genes are proving important in the evolution of biological innovations. Morphological differences between closely related fresh water polyps, Hydra, can be attributed to a small group of novel genes. Novel genes are emerging as important in the worker castes of bees, wasps and ants. Newt-specific genes may play a role in their amazing tissue regenerative powers. In humans, novel genes are associated with devastating diseases, such as leukaemia and Alhzeimer's.\n\nLife is genomically complex, and this complexity plays a crucial role in evolving diversity of life. It's easy to see how an innovation can be improved through natural selection, e.g. once the first eye evolved, it was subject to strong selection to increase the fitness (survival) of its owner. It is more challenging to explain how novelty first originates, especially from a conserved genomic toolkit. Darwinian evolution explains how organisms and their traits evolve, but not how they originate. How did the first eye arise? Or more specifically how did that master regulatory gene for eye development in all animals first originate? The capacity to evolve novel phenotypic traits (be they morphological, physiological or behavioural) is crucial for survival and adaptation, especially in changing (or new) environments.\n\nA conserved genome can generate novelties through rearrangements (within or between genes), changes in regulation or genome duplication events. For example, the vertebrate genome has been replicated in their entirety twice in their evolutionary history; salmonid fish have undergone a further two whole genome duplications. Duplications reduce selection on the function of one of the gene copies, allowing that copy to mutate and evolve into a new gene whilst the other copy maintains business as usual. Conserved genomes can also harbour a lot of latent genetic variation—fodder for evolving novelty—which is not exposed to selection. Non-lethal variation can lie dormant in the genome by not being expressed, or by being expressed at times when it doesn't have a lethal effect on the phenotype. The molecular machinery that regulates expression of genes and proteins depends on minimal information, rules and tools: transcription factors recognise sequences of only a few base-pairs as binding sites, which gives them enormous potential for plasticity in where they bind. Pleiotropic changes across many conserved genes using different combination of transcription, translation and/or post-translation activity are a good source of genomic novelty. E.g. the evolution of beak shapes in Darwin's finches is controlled by pleiotropic changes brought about by changes in the signalling patterns of a conserved gene that controls bone development. The combinatorial power of even a limited genetic toolkit gives it enormous potential to evolve novelty from old machinery.\n\nBut the presence of unique genes in all evolutionary lineages studied to date now tells us that de novo gene birth, rather than a reordering of old ingredients, is important in phenotypic evolution. The over-abundance of non-coding DNA in genomes is less puzzling, if they are a melting pot for genomes to exploit and create new genes and gene function, and ultimately phenotypic innovation. The current thinking is that genomes are constantly producing new genes all the time, but that only a few become functional.\n\nOur story started simply: all life is a product of gentle evolutionary tinkering of a shared molecular toolkit. The unimaginable time has arrived where we can unpack the molecular building blocks of any creature. And these data are shaking things up. What a surprise? Not really. Perhaps the most important lesson from this is that no theory is completely right, and that good theories are those that continue evolving and embracing innovation. Let's evolve theories (keeping the bits that are proven correct), not retire them.\n\nOne of the most prevalent ideas in science is that nature consists of objects. Of course the very practice of science is grounded in objectivity. We objectify nature so that we can measure it, test it, and study it, with the ultimate goal of unraveling its secrets. Doing so typically requires reducing natural phenomena to their component parts. Most zoologists, for example, think of animals in terms of genes, physiologies, species, and the like.\n\nYet this pervasive, centuries-old trend toward reductionism and objectification tends to prevent us from seeing nature as subjects, though there's no science to support such myopia. On the contrary, to give just one example, perhaps the deepest lesson cascading from Darwin's contributions is that all life on Earth, including us, arose from a single family tree. To date, however, this intellectual insight has yet to penetrate our hearts. Even those of us who fully embrace the notion of organic evolution tend to regard nature as resources to be exploited rather than relatives deserving of our respect.\n\nWhat if science were to conceive of nature as both object and subject? Would we need to abandon our cherished objectivity? Of course not. Despite their chosen field of study, the vast bulk of social scientists don’t struggle to form emotional bonds with family and friends. More so than at any point in the history of science, it's time to extend this subject-object duality to at least the nonhuman life forms with which we share this world.\n\nWhy? Because much of our unsustainable behavior can be traced to a broken relationship with nature, a perspective that treats the nonhuman world as a realm of mindless, unfeeling objects. Sustainability will almost certainly depend upon developing mutually enhancing relations between humans and nonhuman nature. Yet why would we foster such sustainable relations unless we care about the natural world?\n\nAn alternative worldview is called for, one that reanimates the living world. This mindshift, in turn, will require no less than the subjectification of nature. Of course, the notion of nature-as-subjects is not new. Indigenous peoples around the globe tend to view themselves as embedded in animate landscapes replete with relatives; we have much to learn from this ancient wisdom.\n\nTo subjectify is to interiorize, such that the exterior world interpenetrates our interior world. Whereas the relationships we share with subjects often tap into our hearts, objects are dead to our emotions. Finding ourselves in relationship, the boundaries of self can become permeable and blurred. Many of us have experienced such transcendent feelings during interactions with nonhuman nature, from pets to forests.\n\nBut how might we undertake such a grand subjectification of nature? After all, worldviews become deeply ingrained, so much so that they become like the air we breathe—essential but ignored.\n\nPart of the answer is likely to be found in the practice of science itself. The reductionist Western tradition of science has concentrated overwhelmingly on the nature of substance, asking \"What is it made of.\" Yet a parallel approach—also operating for centuries, though often in the background—has investigated the science of pattern and form. Generally tied to Leonardo da Vinci, the latter method has sought to explore relationships, which can be notoriously difficult to quantify and must instead be mapped. The science of patterns has seen a recent resurgence, with abundant attention directed toward such fields as ecology and complex adaptive systems. Yet we've only scratched the surface, and much more integrative work remains to be done that could help us understand relationships.\n\nAnother part of the answer, I think, is to be found in education. We need to raise our children so that they see the world with new eyes. At the risk of heresy, it seems that science education in particular could be re-invigorated with subjectification in mind. Certainly the practice of science—the actual doing of scientific research—must be done as objectively as possible. But the communication of science could be done using both objective and subjective lenses.\n\nImagine if the bulk of science education took place outdoors, in direct, multisensory contact with the natural world. Imagine if students were encouraged to develop a meaningful sense of place through an understanding of the deep history and ecological workings of that place. And imagine if mentors and educators emphasized not only the identification and functioning of parts (say, of flowers or insects), but the notion of organisms as sensate beings in intimate relationship with each other (and us). What if students were asked to spend more time learning about how a particular plant or animal experiences its world?\n\nIn this way, science (and biology in particular) could help bridge the chasm between humans and nature. Ultimately, science education, in concert with other areas of learning, could go a long way toward achieving the \"Great Work\" described by cultural historian Thomas Berry—transforming the perceived world \"from a collection of objects to a communion of subjects.\"\n\nIt was born out of a mistranslation and has been misused ever since....but let us do a little thought experiment first:\n\nLet's say you are a scientist and you noticed a phenomenon you would like to tell the world about. \"The brain...\", you say, \"... can listen to a conversation and make sense of the frequencies, decode them into symbols and meaning... but when it is confronted with two such conversations simultaneously, it cannot deal with both threads in parallel. At best it can try to switch back and forth quickly, trying to keep up with the information.\"\n\nSo much for your theory—you formulate your findings and share it with colleagues, it gets argued and debated, just as it should be.\n\nBut now something odd happens: while all your discussions were in English, and you wrote it in English, and despite the fact that a large percentage of the leading scientists and Nobel Laureates are English speaking...somehow the prevailing language for publication is....Mongolian! There is a group in Ulaan Baatar, merrily taking your findings with great interest and your whole theory shows up all over the place...in Mongolian.\n\nBut here is the catch: you wrote that it is not possible to listen to two conversations at the same time, and thus their meaning to you is, well, undefined, until you decide to follow one of them properly.\n\nHowever, as it turns out, Mongolian has no such word—\"undefined\"! Instead it got translated with an entirely different term: \"uncertain\", and the general interpretation of your theory has suddenly mutated from \"one or the other of two conversations will be unknown to you\" to the rather distinctly altered interpretation \"you can listen to one, but the other will be.....entirely meaningless\".\n\nSaying that I am \"unable to understand\" both of them properly is one thing, but... my inability to perceive it does not render each of the conversations suddenly \"meaningless\", does it?\n\nAll of this is of course just an analogy. But it is pretty close to exactly what did happen—just the other way round: the scientist was Werner Heisenberg.\n\nHis observation was not about listening to simultaneous conversations but measuring the exact position and momentum of a physical system, which he described as impossible to determine at the same time. And although he discussed this with numerous colleagues in German (Einstein, Pauli, Schrödinger, Bohr, Lorentz, Born, Planck just to name some of the Solvay Conference group of 1927) the big step came in the dissemination in English, and there is the Mongolian in our analogy!\n\nHeisenberg’s idea had quickly been dubbed Unschärferelation, which transliterates to “unsharpness relationship,” but as there is really no such term in English ('blurred', 'fuzzy', 'vague' or 'ambiguous' have all been tried), the translation ended up as \"the Uncertainty Principle\"—when he had not used either term at all (some point to Eddington). And what followed is really quite close to the analogy as well: rather than stating that either position or momentum are \"as yet undetermined\", it became common usage and popular wisdom to jump to the conclusion that there is complete \"uncertainty\" at the fundamental level of physics, and nature, even free will and the universe as such. Laplace's Demon killed as collateral damage (obviously his days were numbered anyway....)\n\nEinstein remained skeptical his entire life: to him the \"Unbestimmtheit\" (Indeterminacy) was on the part of the observer: not realizing certain aspects of nature at this stage in our knowledge—rather than proof that nature itself is fundamentally undetermined and uncertain. In particular implications like the \"Fernwirkung\" (action at a distance) appeared to him \"spukhaft\" (spooky, eerie). But even in the days of quantum computing, qbits and tunnelling effects, I still would not want to bet against Albert ;) His intuitive grasp of nature survived so many critics and waves of counter-proof ended up counter-counter-proved.\n\nAnd while there is plenty of reason to defend Heisenbergs findings, it is sad to see such a profound meme in popular science, which is merely based on a loose attitude towards translation ( and there are many other such cases...). I would love to encourage writers in French or Swedish or Arabic to point out the idiosyncracies and unique value of those languages—not for semantic pedantry but the benefit of alternate approaches.\n\nGerman is not just good for Fahrvergnügen, Weltanschauung & Zeitgeist, there are many wonderful subtle shades of meaning. It is like a different tool to apply to thinking—and that's a good thing: a great hammer is a terrible saw.\n\nHow do birds fly? How do they stay up in the air? Suppose a textbook told you that the answer was 'levitation', and proceeded to catalogue the different types of levitation (Stationary, Mobile), its laws (\"What goes up must come down\", \"Lighter things levitate longer\") and constraints (Quadrupedalism). You'd rapidly realise that flying was not well understood, and also that the belief in levitation was obscuring the need for, and holding back, a proper scientific account of aerodynamics.\n\nUnfortunately, a similar situation applies to the question 'How do animals learn?'. Textbooks will tell you that the answer is 'association', and will proceed to catalogue the various types (Classical, Operant), its laws (Rescorla-Wagner), and constraints (Autoshaping, Differential Conditionality, Blocking). You will be told that association is the ability of organisms to make connections between any given stimulus and any given outcome or response—the sound of a bell with the arrival of food, or the left-branch of a maze with the administration of pain—merely through (repeated) exposure to their pairing. And you will be told that, because association treats all stimuli equally, it can in principle enable an organism to learn anything.\n\nThe problem is that, as with levitation, no-one has ever set out a mechanism that could perform such a feat. And no-one ever will, because such a mechanism is not possible in theory, and hence not possible in practice. At any given time, an organism is confronted by an infinite number of potential stimuli, and subsequently, an infinite number of potential outcomes. A day in the life of a rat, for example, might include waking up, blinking, walking east, twitching its nose, being trampled on, eating a berry, hearing a rumbling noise, sniffing a mate, experiencing a temperature of 5°C, being chased, watching the sun go down, defecating, feeling nauseous, finding its way home, having a fight, going to sleep, and so on. How does the rat discern that, of all the possible combinations of stimuli and outcomes, it was the berry alone that made him feel sick? Just as answers presuppose a question, data presuppose a theory. In the absence of a prior theory that specifies what to look for, and which relationships to test, there is no way of sorting through this chaos to identify useful patterns. And yet what is the defining feature of associative learning? It is the absence of a prior theory. So, like levitation, association is hollow—a misleading redescription of the very phenomenon that is in need of explanation.\n\nCritics have, for centuries, pointed out this problem with associationism (sometimes called the problem of induction, or the frame problem). And, in recent decades, there have been countless empirical demonstrations that animals—ants learning their way home, birds learning song, or rats learning to avoid food—do not learn in the way that associationism suggests. And yet, associationism (whether as empiricism, behaviourism, conditioning, connectionism, or plasticity) refuses to die, and keeps rising again, albeit encrusted by ever more ad hoc exceptions, anomalies and constraints. Its proponents refuse to abandon it, perhaps because they believe there is no alternative.\n\nBut there is. In communication theory, information is the reduction of prior uncertainty. Organisms are 'uncertain' because they are composed of conditional adaptations that adopt different states under different conditions. These mechanisms can be described in terms of the decision rules that they embody—'if A, then B', or 'If you detect light, then move towards it'. Uncertainty about which state to adopt (to B or not to B), is resolved by attending to the specified conditions (A). The reduction of uncertainty by one half constitutes one 'bit' of information; and so a single decision rule is a one-bit processor. By favouring adaptations with more branching decision rules, natural selection can design more sophisticated organ"
