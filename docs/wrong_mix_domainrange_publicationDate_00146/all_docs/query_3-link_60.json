        "text": "Gregory Benford returns to time travel in this thematic companion to his award-winning bestseller Timescape\n\nItâs 2008, and Charlie, in his late forties, is a bit of a sad-sack professor of history going through an unpleasant divorce. While flipping the cassette of an audiobook he gets into a car accident with a truck end wakes up, fully aware as his adult mind, in his sixteen-year-old body in 1968.\n\nCharlie does the thing we all imagine: he takes what he remembers of the future and uses it for himself in his present, the past. He becomes a screenwriter and producer, anticipating the careers of Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg.\n\nCharlie realizes that there are others like him, like Albert Einstein, Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein. In fact, there is a society of folks who loop through time to change the world for their agenda. Now, Charlie knows he has to do something other than be self-indulgent, and he tries to change one of the events of 1968 in this clever thriller.\n\nTwo centuries from now humanity has established a SETI Library on the moon to decipher and interpret the many messages originating from alien societies. The most intriguing messages are from complete artificial intelligences.\n\nRachel, a beginner Librarian, must talk to alien minds—who have aggressive agendas of their own. These conversations will open doors into strangeness beyond imagination—and catapult Rachel into life threatening danger in her quest for understanding.\n\nRachel Cohen wins a coveted assignment as a Librarian on the moon, where she will work on deciphering alien messages encoded in various alien AIs. She manages where others have not, and ends up far beyond her original goals.\n\nThis is a bit of a mess. There are lots of potentially fascinating ideas here, but it’s very episodic, and those episodes don’t really gel together. It feels like they are there to give a tour of the ideas and various exotic places. The consequences of Rachel’s discoveries don’t seem to form any coherent plot; they are just one thing after another. It also feels poorly edited, with some repetition, and inconsistencies between episodes.\n\nAnd there is several specific aspects that really bugged me. For example, early on there is what is essentially a rape-by-AI scene, but, no consequences. Another example, more technical. There is some sort of anomaly moving towards the solar system, threatening the Earth. It has got as far as the orbit of Jupiter, causing problems there. One of Rachel’s discoveries allows a solution, which is implemented at Jupiter, stopping the anomaly’s progress and protecting the inner solar system. Maybe I missed something, but I don’t see how this works when Jupiter has orbited to the other side of the solar system, and is no longer between Earth and the source of the anomaly.\n\nThere are other examples, but I’ll stop there. Disappointing."
