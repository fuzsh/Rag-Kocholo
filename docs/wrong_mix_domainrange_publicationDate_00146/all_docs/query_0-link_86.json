It was born out of the recognition that scientific discovery and the creation of plausible fictional scenarios are often two sides of the same coin. Each relies on an understanding of the way the world works, coupled with the imaginative ability to invent new or alternative explanations—and even other worlds. Authored by practicing scientists as well as writers of hard science fiction, these books explore and exploit the borderlands between accepted science and its fictional counterpart. Uncovering mutual influences, promoting fruitful interaction, narrating and analyzing fictional scenarios, together they serve as a reaction vessel for inspired new ideas in science, technology, and beyond. Whether fiction, fact, or forever undecidable: the Springer Series “Science and Fiction” intends to go where no one has gone before! Its largely non-technical books take several different approaches. Journey with their authors as they • Indulge in science speculation – describing intriguing, plausible yet unproven ideas; • Exploit science fiction for educational purposes and as a means of promoting critical thinking; • Explore the interplay of science and science fiction – throughout the history of the genre and looking ahead; • Delve into related topics including, but not limited to: science as a creative process, the limits of science, interplay of literature and knowledge; • Tell fictional short stories built around well-defined scientific ideas, with a supplement summarizing the science underlying the plot. Readers can look forward to a broad range of topics, as intriguing as they are important. Here just a few by way of illustration: • Time travel, superluminal travel, wormholes, teleportation • Extraterrestrial intelligence and alien civilizations • Artificial intelligence, planetary brains, the universe as a computer, simulated worlds • Non-anthropocentric viewpoints • Synthetic biology, genetic engineering, developing nanotechnologies • Eco/infrastructure/meteorite-impact disaster scenarios • Future scenarios, transhumanism, posthumanism, intelligence explosion • Virtual worlds, cyberspace dramas • Consciousness and mind manipulation More information about this series at http://www.springer.com/series/11657\n\nDamien Broderick\n\nThe Time Machine Hypothesis Extreme Science Meets Science Fiction\n\nDamien Broderick San Antonio, TX, USA\n\nISSN 2197-1188 ISSN 2197-1196 (electronic) Science and Fiction ISBN 978-3-030-16177-4 ISBN 978-3-030-16178-1 (eBook) https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16178-1 © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 This work is subject to copyright.

Also my time traveling California pal Gary Livick, whom I have never met although I have seen pictures of his two dogs, for emailed advice and very silly jokes. Thanks as well to Angela Lahee, my commissioning editor at Springer, and her associate Rebecca Sauter, who have kept the wheels turning on this and my earlier volume (Consciousness and Science Fiction) in the Springer Science and Fiction series. I am grateful to Professor Gregory Benford, scientist, novelist, and editorial board member of that series, and to Dave Truesdale for useful referee suggestions. In general, I applaud the intelligence and bravery of the many daring scientists whose books and papers have guided my quest for a plausible time machine hypothesis and the novelists and short story writers whose science fiction led me along so many intriguing pathways in the corridors of time.\n\nvii\n\nToday the subject of time travel has jumped from the pages of science fiction to the pages of physics journals as physicists explore whether it might be allowed by physical laws and even if it holds the key to how the universe began. In Isaac Newton’s universe time travel was inconceivable. But in Einstein’s universe it has become a real possibility…. To appreciate what scientists are studying now, an excellent first step is to explore major time-travel themes in science fiction, where many ideas in this arena were first advanced. J.

If the press picked up that the government was funding research into time travel, there would either be an outcry at the waste of public money, or a demand that the research be classified for military purposes. After all, how could we protect ourselves if the Russians or Chinese had time travel and we didn’t? They could bring back Comrades Stalin and Mao! So there are only a few of us who are foolhardy enough to work on the subject that is so politically incorrect, even in physics circles. We disguise what we are doing by using technical terms like “closed timelike curves,” which is just code for time travel. Professor Stephen W. Hawking, “Chronology Protection” (2002, 87) It may interest you to know that there are real physicists out there who are busily publishing papers on whether and how a practical time machine can be built.* *Rest assured, they already have tenure. (A User’s Guide to the Universe, 2010, 154–55)\n\nShortly before the turn of the twentieth century, in 1895, the first time machine story was published by Herbert George Wells, titled (I’m sure you’ve guessed) The Time Machine. Science fiction, as a distinct commercial and literary means of speculative story-telling, has a long pre-history, at least from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, 1818, to Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, 1889). Even so, Wells can be seen fairly as the initiator of what we now regard as a fresh genre, or—better still—fresh narrative mode. It is perhaps significant that his great leap into true novelty was an exploration of deep time, immense futurity, Darwinian evolution via environmental selection. Later he pioneered rather less extreme topics such as invisibility and © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 D. Broderick, The Time Machine Hypothesis, Science and Fiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16178-1_1\n\n3\n\n4\n\nD. Broderick\n\neven the horrifically plausible: global war (against Martians and their technology, a metaphor for German might), military tanks, atomic weapons, powered bombers, a “General Intelligence Machine” or AI, landing on the Moon (although via anti-gravity, which might yet prove valid in this era of Dark Energy), enhanced biology uplifting animals into conscious humanoid slaves. But his deepest resonance proved to be the vehicle carrying its unnamed narrator into the future, ultimately all the way to Earth’s expiration date under a dying Sun. Why time travel? Perhaps as an imaginative response to the vast gulfs of time revealed by nineteenth century geology and biology, the profound shocks of heredity shaped by natural selection rather than divine forethought, the vast age of Earth and cosmos alike. When steam trains came into being because of convergent technologies and aspirations, it was “Steam Engine Time.” For the brilliant Wells, the dazzling light ahead was, in 1895, a kind of metaphysical and ultimately engineering prospect of machine command over time. By the end of his journey the light had dimmed with the price paid, the ultimate in future shock. Even so, Wells was drawn, like many of his admirers in the following century, into the echoing, dangerous vaults and distances of Time Machine Time. But wait! Despite Wells’s fiction, and what Richard Gott and Stephen Hawking claimed, isn’t time in actuality a one-way street, straight from the unchangeable past to the still-unborn future? So how could a time machine possibly work? What would a real-world time machine be? Here is a disheartening example of what it would not be. In an overwrought and unjustifiably confident book, Breaking the Time Barrier (2005), the British journalist Jenny Randles reported a supposed invisible “unseen fifth dimension” explored by the USAF using a “noctovision camera” (72)—that is, a night vision camera designed to be especially sensitive to infrared frequencies. A miracle happened! Mounted aboard a high-flying aircraft, the camera recorded infrared energy from a parking lot thousands of feet below. The parking lot was completely empty… but inexplicably [my emphasis, after shaking my head and rubbing my eyes] the photographs showed the ghostly images of whole lines of parked cars… Were they in another dimension? (73).\n\nWell, no, of course they weren’t. At the end of work hours, the vehicles had been driven away after a day’s hot Florida sunlight baked the tarmac, except where each car had been parked. Hot tarmac unprotected by the shade under parked cars would register strongly on the film for some hours, leaving cooler\n\n1 Time Travel Unraveled\n\n5\n\n“footprints” in the still-radiating surface. Naturally, a camera designed to detect infrared (that is, heat) images showed the vehicles’ lingering heat shadows. Randles makes this sound transcendental, like the faithful finding the face of Jesus burned into a piece of toast. “The energy emissions” (that is, the heat) “detectable from the cars before they departed could be used to recreate the residual outlines of their body shapes” (73). In reality, it would be the surrounding concrete or asphalt surface that would paint its impression inside the camera. The same goofy story had been published 39 years earlier in Beyond the Time Barrier, by Russian-Australian Andrew Tomas (1906–2001). In turn, this version of what Tomas called “earth-shaking experiments” was sourced in an Associated Press report from August 17, 1958, found in the Miami Herald. “The officials did not release their ‘time pictures’ to the public for fear that trained scientists in other countries might have ‘read too much from them.’” It ended with a flourish rivaling Ms. Randles’: “To take a snapshot of empty space and see one’s car on the photograph at a spot where it was two hours ago, is truly breaking the barrier of time” (51–2). This is flagrant misrepresentation, the kind of silliness that gives any possibility of real time machines an even worse reputation. We need to start with a simple, non-bogus definition. (By and by, there will be more complicated varieties.) For now, let’s just propose that a time machine is a hypothetical device or condition of the cosmos able to propel a live passenger, or an instrument package, rapidly into the past or future. Preferably, it should be capable of returning that passenger or package to its time and place of departure. Hence, we are faced immediately with a startling question. If time travel is feasible, not a breach of the established laws of physics, is it possible that we are already being observed by visitors from the future or even the past? —Visitors who have travelled back or forward to our era in time machines yet to be invented or even from forgotten civilizations (whether human or alien) lost in the mists of prehistory? —Maybe even from alternative histories, where things have turned out differently? Answer One: Could be, according to some scientists of the caliber of Stephen Hawking, but not likely. Answer Two: No! Time travel, like perpetual motion and the Flat Earth delusion, is out of the question. Absolute nonsense. Get help. Answer Three: Why, certainly it’s possible. Just the other day, I was chatting to a very nice person from the thirty-first century.\n\n6\n\nD. Broderick\n\nMost intelligent people, I guess, would have no hesitation in hitting the buzzer for Answer Two. Wells’s inventive conceit, and Back to the Future, The Terminator, Groundhog Day, are acceptable as fun fantasy. Yet proposing that time travel might someday be a reality seems ridiculous. Taking it seriously, except as an exercise in playful imagination or science fiction speculation, would be literally childish. Maybe even certifiably crazy. Until some decades ago, hardly a scientist in the world would have given any reply but Answer Two: “Absolute nonsense. Get help.” Then science hit a hump in the road. Weird and improbable things came pouring out of seemingly innocent (if often maddeningly complicated) equations. To start with, as far back as the early days of Albert Einstein’s General Relativity, there was the possibility of black holes. These collapsed stars would be more massive than the Sun, even immensely more massive, their gravity so concentrated into a small ­compressed space that not even light could escape its grip. Here physics reached its limits, in the absence of a solid theory of quantum gravity. For a while, physicists (including Einstein) tightened their seat belts and waited for black holes to go away, hoping they were just figments of the imagination that would vanish when calculations were done more carefully and in greater detail. Instead, to the dismay of conservative experts, the physical evidence for black holes scattered throughout the universe firmed with every year of additional research. Now we are almost certain there’s a gigantic one right in the dusty center of our Milky Way galaxy, and hundreds of billions more throughout the universe.1 They might be more numerous than the visible stars. We shall look in more details at this and related topics shortly, since they form a convenient entry point to current investigations into time travel. In 1965, Professor Richard Phillips Feynman shared the Nobel Prize for physics. At the center of the profound mathematical studies for which he was honored stood an extraordinary conjecture on time reversal. It had been published 16 years earlier in Physical Review, as “The Theory of Positrons.” The genesis of that conjecture was detailed drolly in his Nobel acceptance lecture, “The Development of the Space-Time View of Quantum Electrodynamics.” Working towards a Ph.D. at Princeton, while in his early twenties, Feynman got a phone call from his colleague J. A. Wheeler, even then a notable theoretician. “Feynman,” Wheeler told him, “I know why all electrons have the same charge and the same mass.” https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/science/black-hole-milky-way.html\n\n1\n\n1 Time Travel Unraveled\n\n7\n\nThis was (and still is) a considerable mystery to physicists. Throughout the known universe, as we learn from the sophisticated instruments of astronomers, elementary particles such as the negatively charged electron appear to be basically identical. Reasonable enough, at first sight. But then no other phenomenon on a larger scale is so homogeneous. Trees of a given kind are similar, but hardly identical in root and branch. There are many stars akin to the Sun, but no two exactly alike. Even crystals differ. Yet electrons, aside from variations in their energies, are indeed strictly indistinguishable one from the next. Feynman was intrigued. “Why?” he asked. “Because,” Wheeler told him triumphantly, “they are all the same electron!” It was an audacious jest. What Wheeler was suggesting was simple—and mind-wrenching. Suppose an electron, moving forward in time along with the rest of us, got kicked into the past by a powerful electromagnetic field? Then it would appear to us, earlier, as a positron, a positively-charged antiparticle identical to an electron but opposite in all detectable electromagnetic effects. Still earlier, in our terms, plunging into the past, the positron might be hurled forward again, by an energetic exchange, along the “normal” direction of time. Now the signs would be reversed once more, and the particle would manifest itself to us as a second electron elsewhere in space. Repeat this process an indefinite number of times, and you can account for every electron in the universe. They are all the same electron, weaving and shuttling across the entire history of the universe from the Big Bang at its origin to its unknown, distant death. The concept is breathtaking. Wheeler was joking, of course, but the notion exhilarated Feynman. In his 1965 Nobel lecture, he said: “I did not take the idea that all electrons were the same one from him as seriously as the observation that positrons could simply be represented as electrons going from the future to the past in a back section of their world lines. That, I stole.” Wheeler’s jest proved immensely fruitful. By 1949, Feynman was able to show that the explosive meeting of a positron and an electron (in which they annihilate each another in a burst of energy) is exactly the same as a catastrophic time reversal on the part of the electron alone. Similarly, a photon (or quantum of pure energy) can decay into an electron-­ positron pair, and this event is indistinguishable from the picture of a backward-­moving electron (seen by us as a positron) being kicked forward again into “normal” duration by its impact with the photon.\n\n8\n\nD. Broderick\n\nMany physicists today treat Feynman’s discovery as nothing more than a highly useful book-keeping device, a graphic way to keep track of the interchanges of energy between particles. But it remains true that within certain boundary conditions we are justified in interpreting anti-particles such as the positron as genuine time travelers. Certainly they’re not the kind celebrated in science fiction stories, but the fact remains that for more than 70 years orthodox physics has had to deal with the possibility of time reversal. Feynman’s demonstration was far from easy to swallow. In 1956, in The Direction of Time, Hans Reichenbach acknowledged its significance by dubbing it “the most serious blow the concept of time has ever received in physics.” Since then, even more astounding concepts have emerged in the symbols of mathematicians. But it is arguable Feynman’s breakthrough was the moment when the Time Machine Hypothesis first became intellectually conceivable. Worse than black holes was the theoretical possibility of traversable wormholes (hyperspace shortcuts between two points very distant in spacetime). This possibility revealed by the renovated physics was dubbed the Einstein-­ Rosen bridge, or wormhole, an idea linked with Professor Wheeler, Feynman’s inventive friend. Wormholes are conceived as joining points in space and time through a higher dimensional realm, dubbed Superspace in some interpretations and Bulk in more recent models. Can we grasp what this foamy, wormhole-­filled realm that pervades spacetime is like? Not readily. Reaching for a way to convey this marvel, Wheel expressed himself in a kind of poetry: It is like chasing after Merlin. One moment it is a rabbit, and the next a gazelle. And just as you reach out to touch it, it turns into a fox, or a brightly-colored bird fluttering on your shoulder. It is the place where smoke comes out of the computer because all the classical laws of spacetime break down… In Superspace the question “what happens next?” is devoid of content. The very words “before,” “after” and “next” have lost all meaning. Use of the word “time” in any normal sense is completely out of the question.\n\nSo mass might disappear into a wormhole and emerge far away. “If the mass passes through the wormhole and suddenly appears a billion light-years away in ordinary space once more,” Dr. Isaac Asimov commented soon after they were postulated, “something must balance that great transfer in distance.\n\n1 Time Travel Unraveled\n\n9\n\nApparently this impossibly rapid passage through space is balanced by a compensating passage through time, so that it appears one billion years ago.”2 No nearly instantaneous wormhole warp-gates have yet been found in space nor created in the lab. But it is clear that these issues remain open and vital. For if wormholes truly exist, they spell greater disruption than black holes do for the classical picture of space and time. For example, if a wormhole is built or discovered in plain sight, its ends (braced open by “exotic matter”—negative energy, negative mass) could form a bridge from one time to another, as described in considerable detail in scientific papers3 and careful popular treatments of the notion by both Kip Thorne (Black Holes and Time Warps) and Richard Gott (Time Travel in Einstein’s Universe). The simplest way to do this (where the word “simplest” is really a grotesque irony) would be to hold one end steady while carrying the other end into space at close to the speed of light, or spinning around a black hole, to retard its rate of change. Then carry the wormhole mouth back to your starting point. Throughout this expensive and improbably difficult maneuver, both ends of the wormhole will remain in contact and share the same metric frame, which means that you could step through one portal and emerge from the other into the past or future. The major physics problem here, as Stephen Hawking claimed, is that because the wormhole bridge is an open channel, stray particles and even vacuum energy “virtual particles” would wander through and back, gaining energy with each circuit. Very swiftly, this gale of self-amplified raw energy (like the deafening shriek of positive feedback from two adjacent microphones) would rip the spacetime of the wormhole asunder, along with anyone trying to pass through it. Is there any way to evade this horror? It might be feasible, in principle at least, to brace each end of the wormhole with “exotic matter.” If it exists, can such stuff be harvested and worked into a suitable framework to save wormhole passengers from instant obliteration? This remains a question for theorists and future experimenters. But it must be admitted, the prospects of a traversable, stable wormhole do seem unlikely at the moment. So does the reality of tachyons, a postulated class of sub-atomic particles favored by science fiction since their existence was postulated. If they turn out to exist, tachyons must travel always faster than light, and hence backwards in time.\n\nIsaac Asimov, The Collapsing Universe (1977), 219. See the partial list of peer-reviewed papers by these scientists and their colleagues, at the end of this volume. 2 3\n\n10\n\nD. Broderick\n\nTo date, the querulous may take comfort in the failure of experimentalists to catch any tachyons in their laboratories during the last half century or so, even though some Large Hadron Collider specialists at CERN thought for a giddy moment, in 2011, that neutrinos might be tachyons. Alas, it was just a faulty diode in an optic fiber link, producing an erroneous reading. Still, in light of these early investigations the feasibility of manipulating time began to seem less outrageous,. The brilliant Austrian logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel, a friend of Einstein’s at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, found that the equations of General Relativity permitted time travel to the past in a universe that is rotating. The rebuttal came quickly that our universe is not rotating, which can be proved. But this does not invalidate the worth of Gödel’s mathematical investigation, which provided a door for us to keep ajar. Gott notes: …the Gödel solution is very important, for it showed that time travel to the past is possible in principle, with Einstein’s theory of gravity. If there is one solution that has this property, there can be others. (92)\n\nFinally, and most controversially (you may close your eyes and hold your nose here if your stomach isn’t up to it), the offensive claims of laboratory psychic research crept from the shadowy borderlands on the outskirts of physics and psychology, and stood on the doorstep of the Academy. Some prestigious scientific journals, reluctantly and with grave cautions, found it necessary to publish papers on retrocausal effects—where the future influences the past to some extent—and phenomena dubbed “anomalous cognition” (knowing the future in advance) and perhaps “anomalous perturbation” (intention operating directly on matter). These phenomena presented faint but cumulatively impressive evidence that the human mind itself can breach the accepted limitations of entropic space and time. See, for example, the recent paper by Professor Etzel Cardeña (2018): “The experimental evidence for parapsychological phenomena: A review.” This appeared in the quite straitlaced and important mainstream journal American Psychologist.4 Allegedly (indeed, demonstrably5), some people can give statistically impressive double-blind descriptions of remote locations, unknown to them by normal means, while being monitored in laboratory conditions. Even https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000236 See, for example, three recent academic collections: Broderick and Goertzel, eds., Evidence for Psi (McFarland 2015), May and Mahawa, eds., Extrasensory Perception, 2 volumes (Praeger 2015), and Cardeña, Palmer and Marcusson-Clavertz, eds., Parapsychology: A Handbook for the 21st Century 4 5\n\n1 Time Travel Unraveled\n\n11\n\nmore drastic, such “remote viewing” worked just as well if the randomized, hidden target location was not chosen until after the viewing session was complete. That is, these gifted people possessed, to some more-than-chance degree at least, the ability to foresee the unpredictable future. If this claim continues to hold up, then these remote viewers are not using time machines. They are time machines, neurologically speaking. Spooky, I know. Still, even if we restrict our attention for the moment to black holes and wormholes, it is abruptly clear that the only fair reply in the 2020s to the question of time travelers will be Answer One: Maybe such devices are possible, even if not for the likes of us twenty-first century humans. Time machines, in short, are no longer only a favored fancy of science fiction authors like me. Whether or not they literally exist is still uncertain, but their status has shifted from that of playful and inventive fantasy to the respectable realm of genuine scientific speculation. Consider the following notable science specialists (and academically trained science popularizers), several already cited above, who in the last couple of decades have spent time investigating the possibilities and paradoxes of travel through time. It seems appropriate to track their entrance into this topical domain in order of publication. Stephen Hawking was born in 1942 and died in 2018 after decades of increasing physical paralysis from motor neuron disease. For 30 years he was Lucasian Professor at Cambridge, holding the chair held by Isaac Newton 300 years earlier. His A Brief History of Time became a famously best-selling if often unread book in 1988. In its updated edition a decade later, he introduced an entire new chapter on the topic of time travel, based on formal papers published earlier that helped kick-start the academic interest in moving freely back and forth in time. Paul J. Nahin, born in 1940, took a PhD from the University of California, Irvine, in 1972, and is currently an emeritus professor of electrical engineering at the University of New Hampshire. A quarter century ago, he published a hefty treatise on both the science and science fiction of time travel prospects. Time Machines: Time Travel in Physics, Metaphysics, and Science Fiction was published, gratifyingly, by the American Institute of Physics. It reappeared from Springer in a revised and updated 2017 version, Time Machine Tales: The Science Fiction Adventures and Philosophical Puzzles of Time Travel.\n\n(McFarland 2015), plus the long-classified documentation from the US government psi program, May and Mahawa, eds., The Star Gate Archives: Remote Viewing, vols 1 and 2 of 4 (McFarland 2018).\n\n12\n\nD. Broderick\n\nOne of the finest and most inventive studies in our topic is Time Travel In Einstein’s Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel through Time (2001) by J. Richard Gott, born 1947, a professor of astrophysics at Princeton. An equally clear, short examination of our topic is British polymath Paul Davies’s How To Build a Time Machine (2001). In July 2018, BBC television ran a Horizon program on the topic borrowing (or plagiarizing) the same title. Davies, born 1946 in London, emigrated first to Australia and then to the US, is now a research professor at Arizona State University, pursuing topics in cosmology, quantum field theory, and most recently astrophysics. He has won a lucrative Templeton Prize, and the Royal Society’s Faraday prize, and in 2007 was granted membership in the Order of Australia, a sort of knighthood in an egalitarian culture. He also has an asteroid named after him: 6870 Pauldavies. Ronald Mallet (born 1945) became a full professor at the University of Connecticut in 1987, specializing in cosmology and astrophysics. In Time Traveler: A Scientist’s Personal Mission to Make Time Travel a Reality (2006), he proposed methods to travel into the past by creating relativistic frame-­dragging (in which accelerated rotation can cause spacetime to literally twist in the vicinity), and even closed timelike curves. Sean Carroll, born 1966, is another cosmologist and quantum physicist, a research professor in the Dept. of Physics at the California Institute of Technology. His current interests are primarily in general relativity and the mysteries of dark energy. A rigorous but highly imaginative skeptic, he makes it clear in From Eternity to Here: The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time (2010) that time travel is not impossible, just very, very difficult, based on what we know today. Perhaps the most remarkable and up-to-date treatment of wormholes, plus gravity used as a time portal driver, and the marvels of bulk and brane (we’ll return to these rather difficult multi-dimensional regions) is by Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne, born 1940 and before his 2009 retirement Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology. His earlier marvelous book was Black Holes and Time Warps (1994). Perhaps he is most famous these days as the theoretician of wormhole travel in the novel and subsequent movie Contact (1985, 1997), and recently the more rigorous film Interstellar which he explains as a cautiously scientific interpreter in The Science of Interstellar (2014). This list omits other books by science writers not specifically involved in time travel research, such as Clifford A. Pickover’s Time: A Traveler’s Guide, released by Oxford University Press, in 1998. Pickover, somewhat like Isaac Asimov, is a polymathic popularizer of science. Born in 1957, with a 1982\n\n1 Time Travel Unraveled\n\n13\n\nPhD in molecular biophysics from Yale, he has some 500 patents—although so far none in time travel dynamics. Brian Clegg, born 1955, holds two Master’s Degrees, and writes popular science. His 2011 book has the same title as Paul Davies’—How To Build a Time Machine, but the 2012 British edition carefully retitled it as Build Your Own Time Machine. Neither of these books actually contains a blueprint for achieving this self-assembly, but they do convey the general drift of the science of time travel. Given this barrage of research and publications, it is perhaps timely that a biographer of Feynman (Genius) James Gleick (born 1954), released a sort of nostalgic study of these recurrent themes in Time Travel: A History (2016). Not himself a researcher, Gleick insightfully traces the paths taken by these earlier explorers and leaves us at the intersection where dreams and advanced physics have grown entangled: Every few years someone makes headlines by hailing the possibility of time travel through a wormhole—a traversable wormhole, or maybe even a “macroscopic ultrastatic spherically-symmetrical long-throated traversable wormhole.” I believe that these physicists have been unwittingly conditioned by a century of science fiction. They’ve read the same stories, grown up in the same culture as the rest of us. Time travel is in their bones.” (58)\n\nTo our considerable surprise, therefore, we can now see that time travel might be at least possible within the terms of advanced current scientific theory. Shortly, I shall detail some of the ways that might be. Then we can explore the many paths along which this notion has wandered in science fiction. Finally, we shall look at some of the (questionable) evidence suggesting time travel is not just allowed by physics, but indeed might be a reality that intersects our present-day world, offering threats and promises more extraordinary than the prospect of travel to the stars. As we shall see, the Time Machine Hypothesis has no lack of theoretical support. It has yet to confront formidable objections, however, far graver than those which stood for so long in the way of plate tectonics, once dubbed “drifting continents.” And the hard evidence in its favor is scanty. The notion is still so new, historically, so challenging, that no considerable search for evidence has been undertaken. Regard the comments on the possibility by Hawking, from the additional chapter on time travel and wormholes in the second edition of his landmark book:\n\n14\n\nD. Broderick\n\nWe thus have experimental evidence both that space-time can be warped… and that it can be curved in the way necessary to allow time travel…. One might hope therefore that as we advance in science and technology, we would eventually managed to build a time machine. But if so, why hasn’t anyone come back from the future and told us how to do it? There might be good reasons why it would be unwise to give us the secret of time travel at our present primitive state of development, but unless human nature changes radically, it is difficult to believe that some visitor from the future wouldn’t spill the beans. Of course, some people would claim that sightings of UFOs are evidence that we are being visited either by aliens or by people form the future. (If the aliens were to get here in reasonable time, they would need faster-than-light travel, so the two possibilities may be equivalent. Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time, 2nd edition, 1998, pp. 165–6.\n\nAs Hawking implied, the most dramatic and incontrovertible proof would be the sighting of a time machine by credible witnesses. At once we are brought into the irritating zone indicated by Answer Three (“Some of my best friends are from the far future!”). I’ve deliberately pitched Answer Three at a whimsical level. Our instant reaction to a claim that someone has witnessed a time machine, let alone traveled in one, would be to roll our eyes, if not jeer. I present the Time Machine Hypothesis here as entertainment, as speculation, an exercise in following both current science and science fiction into the realm of the (barely) possible. If it is valid, though, it implies that future civilizations will one day master time travel. If so, it is not an absolute absurdity that even now they might be among us, their ancestors, observing our quaint and ferocious ways.\n\n2 The Scientific Basis for Time Machines\n\nSpace and time are interchangeable (except for our inability, so far, to double back chronologically as we can spatially). So Einstein told us. An interval that one observer sees as a gap in space between two places can be seen just as validly as a gap in time between two moments. It is a truly shocking discovery. By now it is well known that a space traveler flying to a distant star system at speeds closely approaching that of light will return home to find that his 10 year voyage has been experienced on Earth as a hundred or a thousand years. He has experienced time dilation. His great speed has shifted him to a different frame of reference, causing time on his craft to run slow by comparison with clocks on Earth. What’s seldom grasped is that space, for the traveler, has actually been compressed or contracted. Say his 10 year round-trip was to a star known to be 50 light years distant. That’s a total journey of 100 light years, authentically experienced by him as lasting just 10 years. So it seems he must have travelled ten times faster than light. Yet Einstein insists that ordinary matter cannot be accelerated faster than light. The paradox vanishes when we grasp that for the voyager, due to space contraction, the distance between Earth and his destination has shrunk (literally) to less than five light years. At his enormous speed, the universe flattens in front of him. For the crew of that starship, all of reality squeezes together. The universe bunches up. In fact, in the overall single reality of spacetime, the balance between time and space shifts according to which observer we question. To the earthbound unaccelerated witness, it appears that time on the spacecraft slowed down. To the space traveler, it appears that the distance covered shrank. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 D. Broderick, The Time Machine Hypothesis, Science and Fiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16178-1_2\n\n15\n\n16\n\nD. Broderick\n\nBoth interpretations are equally valid, because, in a sense, space and time dimensions can be transformed into one another. It is the combination of both time and space into a single spacetime value that creates the invariant reality expressed from each observer’s standpoint. This is a little like the way 2 × 9 = 18 yields the same combined result as 3 × 6, also equaling 18. Time dilation under acceleration sounds impossible—even logically incoherent. But there is overwhelming experimental evidence that this understanding of reality is correct. No other view to date makes as much sense of the universe, from the most elementary subatomic particle to the most remote quasar, as does this fantastic perspective. So much for common sense. Such a hammer blow to the traditional wisdom of humankind is not easily absorbed, even after a century. The truth of Relativity has been accepted by scientists for more than four generations, but the deep implications of the news have not really seeped through to the non-scientific public. It’s doubtful, for that matter, whether it has been grasped emotionally by most physicists. Yet the interchangeability of time and space is just the first crack in the foundations of common sense. The towers of our ancient certainties are eroding fast. For if space and time can be swapped, so that a year aboard a spacecraft travelling at 99.9996% of light speed becomes a day and a kilometer shrinks to two and three-quarter meters, might not time travel itself become feasible? Could our relentless motion forward in time be not just slowed but reversed, just as we can retrace our steps through space? That question, however, is naïve, and fails to understand that time stops at the speed of light in vacuum; it does not bounce, or begin running backward. For all that, though, it turns out that there is nothing in the principles of General Relativity, Einstein’s theory of gravity, to deny the possibility of retrocausal effects. And there is much evidence to support its reality. Advanced science sometimes has the look of a banana republic. Revolutions sweep across the terrain with dizzying regularity, toppling old regimes and enthroning young upstarts who fall in their turn before the decade is out. Unlike political revolutions, though, the turmoil is fairly bloodless, and all the combatants benefit. In the 1970s and 1980s, the innovation that captured most public attention was the likelihood of black holes in space. It was swiftly realized out that black holes might be a gateway into time travel: that the black hole concept straddles two regimes of science. “Bizarre though they may seem in everyday terms,” wrote Dr. John Gribbin, 40 years ago, “an astronomer brought up in the old school can, perhaps with a little discomfort, stretch his mind to accommodate the concept… But, of course, the old astronomy is not the ultimate world picture… These objects\n\n2 The Scientific Basis for Time Machines\n\n17\n\nmay be the most peculiar feature of the old astronomy, but they are also among the simplest and most ‘obvious’ features of the new astronomy.” Some doubts lingered for a time as to the physical reality of black holes, but cosmologists eventually built them into effective models of the galaxies. Immense black holes are known to be the powerhouses dwelling at the cores of many galaxies, almost certainly including our own Milky Way. Many giant stars, imploding in supernovae, collapse into spinning black holes. To begin, let’s look briefly in more detail at how the discovery of black holes came about, those ultimate oddities of last century’s classical astronomy. In November, 1915, Albert Einstein caused an unprecedented upheaval in the scientific worldview with his announcement of General Relativity. Basic to his theory, as we’ve seen, was the Special Relativistic proposal that reality must henceforth be measured according to a new geometry. Space and time, the two basic categories within which we perceive events (“It happened two meters left, three forward, one centimeter up, and ten seconds ago”), dissolved into a single entity, spacetime. This remarkably powerful intellectual leap implied, among other things, that any material body “kinks” or “curves” or even “drags” the spacetime around it. What’s more, matter and energy also melted into a single phenomenon. One of the principal confirmations of Einstein’s theory was an observable effect created by the Sun’s enormous gravitational field. The effect is piquant. Because energy and mass are identical, the stupendous quantity of energy represented by the Sun’s gravity field itself generates a further increment of gravitation, just as the primary field is created by the star’s mass. Newton’s laws had long since described the way masses attract each other, but Newton was at a loss to account for the mechanism involved. What Einstein suggested was that masses do not “attract” one another. Rather, they deform or distort the intervening space so that the shortest inertial distance between the two points is a “geodesic” or four-dimensionally curved line. Within months of Einstein’s announcement, the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild had drawn from it the arresting notion that an object of suitable mass and radius can curve spacetime around it to such an extent that it cuts itself off from the rest of the universe. In mathematical terms, his solution to the field equations involved a singularity; certain values went off the board and became infinite. Usually when singularity infinities turn up in scientific theories it’s a strong hint that somewhat is wrong with the equations. Not so this time. In the vicinity of a Schwarzschild singularity, space is so intensely stressed that you can get in, but you can’t get out again. The Sun is about 333,480 times as massive as the earth, but its radius is so enormous that its surface\n\n18\n\nD. Broderick\n\ngravity is only 28 times that of our planet. (Not that it actually has a solid surface, of course.) If that great mass could somehow be compressed into a ball six kilometers in diameter, the gravity at its surface would be, in effect, infinitely great. The velocity needed to escape from that surface would exceed the speed of light. So even light itself would not be able to leave the surface of a totally collapsed star, which would have become a black, non-radiant hole in space. (Except for what has come to be called Hawking radiation, a sort of sleight of hand in which one of a pair of particles is trapped and its twin is flung away—a kind of virtual radiation from the hole.) From a distance, naturally, the gravitational effects on the rest of the universe of such a star would be unchanged. Journalists have a bad habit of describing black holes as if they were ravenous predators, sucking nearby stars into their maws. It’s true that something like that happens very close to the event horizon of a hole, but from a distance the star’s gravity is no greater than it was before the massive infall. But at its event horizon or imaginary surface, the wavelength of radiation trying to leave would be stretched indefinitely, its photons circling the drain, so to speak, trapping the radiation forever. If it were alone in space, there would be virtually no way to know such an ultimately collapsed star was there. In shrinking down below its Schwarzschild radius, a lone hole would have vanished from the universe. In the case of a binary star, matters become more interesting, for a black hole can steal the substance of its nearby orbiting companion into an accretion disk of wildly energized infalling matter, emitting gales of X-rays in the process. At first, this remarkable by-product of Relativity seemed no more than a quirk of the equations. Newtonian mechanics had allowed singularities also, but because Newton was ignorant of the light-speed limit for proper mass such singularities did not entail the disastrous consequences that afflict a collapsed star. Today, with vastly more evidence at our disposal about the nature of the cosmos, the black hole is firmly positioned in the pantheon of stellar wonders—including an immense hole, with the compressed mass of four millions stars like the Sun, near the center of our Milky Wave galaxy. The first star put forward as an excellent candidate for stellar black hole status was the invisible but instrument-detectable companion of a quite close visible star that behaves so oddly that the presence of a stellar black hole in orbit around it could be inferred. The primary star is HDE 226868, a hot blue B-class sun much larger than our own, some 6200 light years from Earth. The invisible secondary star, Cygnus X-1, orbits it every 5.6 days, and produces intense fluctuating X-ray emissions. Since its mass is estimated to be nearly nine times that of our sun, Cygnus X-1 (which was discovered in 1971)\n\n2 The Scientific Basis for Time Machines\n\n19\n\nhad a strong enough gravitational field to have imploded into a black hole state. In 2011, NASA announced: Using X-ray data from Chandra, the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, and the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics, scientists were able to determine the spin of Cygnus X-1 with unprecedented accuracy, showing that the black hole is spinning at very close to its maximum rate. Its event horizon— the point of no return for material falling towards a black hole—is spinning around more than 800 times a second.1\n\nAmusingly, black hole expert Stephen Hawking lost a 1974 bet with this announcement; he had wagered that Cyg-X1 was not a black hole. Such a collapsed star starts life as a radiant body at least several times larger than the sun. The more massive stars are, the faster and more furiously they burn, and eventually the nuclear flame exhausts its fuel. Without the constant fantastic pressure of stellar radiation blasting out from its interior, the star’s monstrous mass collapses under its own weight. This rapid implosion sometimes provides enough new usable energy to blow away part of the star’s substance in a glorious incandescence. Once a century, on average, each galaxy produces an even more dramatic catastrophe: a supernova. When that mighty candle is puffed out, the supernova’s core can continue to collapse. The electrons of its atoms are forced into their nuclei, electrical charges equalize, and its entire substance turns into neutrons. A neutron star is unthinkably dense, yet even this awesome compression is not the limit. If the surface of the neutron supernova remnant sinks within its own Schwarzschild event horizon (beyond which no internal event can ever signal its presence by light radiation) the star…vanishes. Or not quite. Cygnus X-1, its supernova fires long quenched, is dragging into itself an enormous stream of fiery gas from its highly luminous primary. As this cosmic plunder spirals into the collapsed star it is accelerated to the velocity of light. Gas molecules collide, heating up and shedding gouts of X-rays. It’s important to stress, however, that black holes come in all shapes and sizes, and they are not all as dense as a collapsed star the size of a mountain containing the mass of a star. Seven years after Cygnus X-1 was identified, a group of astronomers reported on an international study of the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, which is 54 million light years distant. The team concluded that its core seemed to constitute a black hole which has swallowed up several https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/cygnusx1.html\n\n1\n\n20\n\nD. Broderick\n\nbillion stars. This conjecture has been confirmed. M87, a strong source of X-rays, is marked by a jet of hot gas blasting 5000 light years into space from the galaxy’s core.2 Using an excruciatingly sensitive photon-counting device, the astronomers found too few visible stars to account for the mass of the central region, a volume 720 light years across. It is known that this supermassive black hole nucleus, equal to six and a half billion suns like ours, is surrounded by a rapidly rotating gas ring turbulent with loops and rings created by pressure spasms every few million years. Yet the core’s density is not much more than that of air, and if it were not for the colossal bursts of energy raging there it would be quite conceivable to imagine life continuing within its event horizon boundary. Avid theoreticians swiftly seized on black holes to explain many other outstanding anomalies in astronomy. At one time it was considered possible that dark matter, the 27% of the mass of the cosmos invisible to us, was tied up in that form. (Another vast amount of “antigravity” dark energy, 68% of the cosmos, powers the accelerating expansion of the universe.)3 Others suggest that the universe in its entirety begins and ends its life by passing through a black hole phase, where all orthodox regularities and physical laws break down totally, perhaps emerging in what is inevitably called a white hole. (None has yet been observed.) Indeed, it’s possible that the universe already falls within its own Schwarzschild radius, which means that we would now be living in the heart of a black hole. The magic of black holes lies in its singularity, the place at its center where physical laws are apparently rendered void. Time and space lose their meaning there. As long ago as 1974, Stephen Hawking gave a lecture at the California Institute of Technology in which he demonstrated that at least one such singularity exists in the universe. Later analysis, much of it by Hawking and his colleagues, cast doubt on that claim, but the possibility remains open. Hawking, as everyone knows, was an authentic genius, tragically pinned to a wheelchair by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease affecting voluntary muscle movement but not the brain. His mind had wings. He is considered by some physicists to stand beside Newton and Einstein, although even by the time of his death in March, 2018, none of his ideas had met and passed any crucial test. His early recondite paper was titled “The Breakdown of Physics in the Region of Space-Time Singularities.” Wryly, Hawking followed that title with another: “The Breakdown of Physicists in the Region of Space-Time See https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-87 https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy\n\n2 3\n\n2 The Scientific Basis for Time Machines\n\n21\n\nSingularities.” Why? With the breakdown of space and time in their vicinity, the laws of physics become inoperative, or at least our capacity to predict outcomes is lost. Most relevantly to our inquiry, time itself can go into reverse. Hawking argued that a singularity is not just possible but inevitable when three conditions are met. If General Relativity is true, if gravity is always positive (attracting rather than repelling), and if enough mass has ever been compressed closely enough together, a singularity must exist. Are all three conditions true? As was only learned years later, no. The discovery that the expansion of the cosmos is accelerating rather than slowing, as one might expect, shows that dark energy or some other force or geometrical agency is able to counteract gravity. So conceivably such exotic effects intervene during a supernova collapse—and especially during the extreme conditions thought to have existed during the Big Bang—and prevent the final collapse into oblivion or another universe. Hawking’s most alarming achievement was to weld together the insights of quantum mechanics and Relativity with the proposal, in 1971, of mini-holes. These, unlike collapsed stars, would not collapse under their own weight— they’d have to be squeezed. Unless the material of the Big Bang event was absolutely evenly distributed, which is unlikely, local pockets of immense pressure would have created mini-holes ranging in mass from a planet to a grain of sand. Might the cosmos be choked with a dust of micro-holes? Within 3 years, though, Hawking blew the mini-hole to pieces. If there were ever any mini-holes, they must have gone by now. For black holes aren’t black. Taking quantum theory into account alters the original description, permitting holes to lose mass by thermal emission. This might seem to refute the very postulate that gave rise to the very notion of black holes, but in fact it merely strengthens it. Mini-black holes can ­evaporate, with an explosion equivalent to 10 million one-megaton nuclear bombs, but collapsed stars and larger black holes still have lifetimes rivaling that of the entire universe. The thermal emission of what we might dub “pink holes” arises because the stupendous gravitational field close to a hole tugs at the very space it occupies, stressing the vacuum. One of the wonders of quantum theory is that empty space is conceived as being full of “virtual” particles, pairs of elementary particles and their antiparticles, that pop into being spontaneously and annihilate one another so rapidly that they cannot be detected. (But their presence can be inferred from certain physical effects on other observable phenomena.) As noted earlier, a black hole can trap one member of such a pair while kicking the other away. It might be thought that this would add mass to the hole, as well as providing a fuzzy surround of escaping virtual particles. Actually, since the pair-­\n\n22\n\nD. Broderick\n\ncreation occurs at the expense of the hole’s gravitational energy, the final upshot is a loss of energy to the hole. In the long term, this is why black holes evaporate. Interestingly, Feynman’s interpretation of positrons crops up again in black hole thermal emission. Hawking declared that we can regard the member of the pair of particles that falls into the black hole—the antiparticle, say—as being really a particle that is travelling backward in time. Thus the antiparticle falling into the black hole can be regarded as a particle coming out of the black hole but travelling backward in time. When the particle reaches the point at which the particle-antiparticle pair originally materialized, it is scattered by the gravitational field so that it travels forward in time.\n\nWhat would it be like inside a collapsed star? One of the advertised features of stellar black holes which endeared them to popularizers is the way they tear incautious explorers to tiny pieces. The gravitational gradient curves so abruptly near a non-rotating collapsed star that an explorer’s limbs and organs would be subject to savagely unequal stresses, stretching in one director and squeezing like an Iron Maiden in the other. This is true, however, only in the non-rotating case. If the collapsed star is spinning, an astronaut would be killed only if he or she entered from an equatorial direction, for that is where the infinite tidal forces are located. And it would be quite safe to enter a black hole of galactic magnitude, like the ones thought to lie in the heart of all or most galaxies like our own. An early student of the lunatic nature of the collapsed star’s interior was mathematician John G. Taylor (1931–2012), whose book Black Holes: The End of the Universe? appeared in 1973. For a time Professor Taylor became distracted by another phenomenon on the margins of orthodox physics—the metal-bending allegedly performed by psychic and stage performer Uri Geller and others. But while Taylor was clearly a man with a questioning mind, his imagination was constrained by strict mathematical rigor. (He swiftly repudiated metal-bending and telepathy on the conservative grounds that no known force, especially electromagnetism, could produce such effects.) Once inside the event horizon of a black hole, Taylor argued, we would discover a topsy-turvy world indeed, one of the strangest we could ever envisage. For in it, time and space would have been interchanged. In our normal world we can move about freely in space. Time is just the opposite; though we might slow it down near the surface of the event horizon it still marches onwards.\n\n2 The Scientific Basis for Time Machines\n\n23\n\nThis is exactly reversed inside the event horizon. There we would have no control over our voyage through space, even though we could go backwards in time, or simply move around in it to our heart’s desire. (90–91)\n\nIt is only fair to point out that not all scientists at the time took the mathematics of black holes and their singularities so literally. Taylor’s picture was suggested by strenuous mathematical analysis, but lacking observational confirmation you could take it or leave it. Many physicists were happy to leave it. There is one ultimate variety of black hole, in all this panoply of paradox, that is more electrifying than the rest. For it’s possible that a black hole might form without an event horizon, or be denuded of it through thermal emission. After all, the surface gravity of a massive body depends on the distance between the surface and the body’s center. The faster a body spins, the more it bulges at the equator. The planet Jupiter, for example, is visibly flattened at the poles by its rapid spin. So the influence of gravity on gas giants such as Jupiter is more pronounced at the poles than at the equator. A very rapidly rotating black hole might be flattened into a pancake, so that its event horizon passes within the equatorial zone. Information from its singularity might then spread outward to the universe through the “protruding” section of the hole. Similarly, an evaporating hole might leave its singularity naked for all to observe. For Taylor, such a possibility was devastating. If we ever locate or create a naked singularity, he warned apocalyptically, We would be able to travel in time to our heart’s desire, to return and meet ourselves, to people our earth with many, many copies of ourself. The time travel which only occurred for the intrepid few who vanished into the ­no-man’s-­land inside a spinning black hole would now be available to anyone in the whole of our universe. The trip back in time could only be taken by a suitable voyage round the naked singularity, but it would always be possible. (108)\n\nThe seemingly-inevitable causality paradoxes terrified Taylor, but excited many sf writers, as we shall see. What’s more, there are analyses that show ways to avoid fatal paradoxes by insisting on certain restrictions. In effect, the blurriness and uncertainties of the atomic world become amplified up to our own scale of existence, saving the time traveller from paradox—but perhaps only at the cost of swapping one potential history for another, consistent with Feyman’s picture in which every possible choice is always taken. Careful logical studies show that self-consistency is one key to plausible time-travel (either physical, or via messages to the past), a crucial topic to which we shall return.\n\n24\n\nD. Broderick\n\nOne enchanting possibility was suggested by a theorem proved by the notable mathematician Roger Penrose, now an emeritus professor at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford University. This contingency implies that the collapse of a supernova into its own black hole might abruptly open a path to another universe, one we previously had no reason to suppose existed. These alternative universes are a feature of Superspace, the concept introduced by John Archibald Wheeler. In quantum theory, fundamental particles are not the hard, determinate pellets of matter conceived by nineteenth century atomic theory, but regions where energy interactions can occur with varying probability. The “probability amplitudes” associated with any particle range from the grossly unlikely but still possible (for example, an electron under observation instantly vanishing to the other side of the galaxy) to the highly probable. Superspace comprises all these probability amplitudes. Taylor noted that Near the singularity of a black hole, quantum effects will become important and the plenitude of worlds in superspace should begin to be experienced. But the superspace being explored ever increasingly as the singularity is reached has none of the properties we would expect. The usual ideas of before and after, of what happens ‘next’, have to be abandoned; even time itself loses any sense, and we must be prepared for the instantaneous jump from one point of space to another if we can once understand how to penetrate and escape from superspace. (103)\n\nDrastic as that sounds, it was penned before Hawking showed that black holes can be sources of radiation. Even without entering the event horizon, we may be able to experience the disturbing revelations of Superspace caused by gravitationally collapsed-star strains upon spacetime. In Hawking’s own words: “Indeed, it is possible that the black hole could emit a television set or the works of Proust in 10 leather-bound volumes…” Happily, he added: “But the number of configurations of particles that correspond to these exotic possibilities is vanishingly small.”\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\nIn the insane vortex of the black hole interior, then, time’s arrow is twisted like a pretzel. If intelligence in the distant future ever learns to ride those currents—perhaps by the deliberate construction of a naked singularity, or a Tipler time gate (see below)—time travel may become commonplace. The ultimate absurdity of science fiction will be a matter of mundane fact. Our descendants, or their nanoscale AI drones, might venture through history in search of knowledge, aesthetic stimulus, and diversion. A new specialist might be born: the investigative, participatory historian. Temporal anthropologists might study at first hand, or through such miniaturized telemetry equipment, the Paleolithic geniuses painting bison and stags on the cool stone walls of the Lascaux caves, and send their tiny or stealthed recording probes among the aircraft that firebombed Dresden and the billowing smoke of the falling towers of Manhattan. Alas, we can even imagine the lurid advertisements of hucksters organizing vulgar tours of history’s high spots: “Stroll in PERFECT SAFETY amid the CARNAGE of the BLACK DEATH.” “See the eco-doom COLLAPSE of 2030.” And there are far more bizarre possibilities, all of them explored by clever science fiction stories and novels. A neo-Nazi revival might travel to the 1930s with the intention of giving Hitler laser or nuclear weapons. Religious time travelers would certainly be tempted to question Gautama Buddha in 528 BC as he sits beneath the bo tree, or revive the crucified Jesus in his tomb, using advanced medical devices. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 D. Broderick, The Time Machine Hypothesis, Science and Fiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-16178-1_3\n\n25\n\n26\n\nD. Broderick\n\n(No doubt some cult has already preached that this is exactly what happened.) On the other hand, it would be enchanting if the reason Mary and Joseph were forced into the stable was the heavy tourist industry pressure from time travelers in Bethlehem that Christmas. “The most convincing argument against time-travel,” Sir Arthur C. Clarke pointed out at the start of the 1960s, is the remarkable scarcity of time-travelers. However unpleasant our age may appear to the future, surely one would expect scholars and students to visit us, if such a thing were possible at all. Though. they might try to disguise themselves, accidents would be bound to happen—just as they would if we went back: to Imperial Rome with cameras and tape-recorders concealed under our nylon togas. Time-travelling could never be kept secret for very long… (Profiles of the Future)\n\nHow would a visiting time traveler appear to us? It is impossible to be sure. Speculation is so fertile when the basic limiting factors are unknown that almost any answer has some degree of plausibility. The best we can do is set reasonable constraints and proceed from there. This is exactly what science fiction writers have been doing ever since H.G. Wells first invented his “chronic argonaut.” The initial set of constraints must concern causality—the web of actions in which one or more events directly give rise to a certain effect, a process which our common experience assures us can take place only in a single, forward direction of time. You can beat the egg into an omelet, but you can’t unbeat your savory steaming breakfast back into a shell-sealed egg. Most philosophers have rejected time travel as a self-contradiction (as they have also rejected psychic precognition of the future, despite laboratory evidence in its favor), because the paradoxes entailed can oppress the mind with panic. The hoariest chestnut runs as follows: What happens if you build a time machine, travel back to a point before the conception of one of your parents, accidentally or deliberately kill your future grandfather, and hence short-­ circuit your own existence? If you have never existed, your ancestor cannot have been killed by you, so you will be born after all, only to kill him, in an infinite vicious loop. The hokey solution is to invoke some authority similar to the Coast Guard. Call them the Time Police or Time Patrol. If a temporal paradox occurs, an alert squad rushes back through time to the scene of the initial action and nips it in the bud. The reason we never observe time line changers, then, is that\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\n27\n\nthey are all in prison, apprehended before their crimes were committed. It raises some interesting jurisprudential issues. The movie Minority Report played with a version of this notion, based on a story by Philip K. Dick, a brilliant science fiction writer who tried out just about all the variants on time loops and precognition. But the logistics of that solution, appealing though it is to writers of adventure stories, are insupportable. At the very least, the conjecture tends to catapult itself immediately into a scenario of grotesque wars between various epochs, each striving to undo and remake history to their own taste (a premise exploited in a long series of stories about the Time Patrol by the equally brilliant Poul Anderson). Even if this is the case, it would be to the advantage of time travelers to avoid paradoxes. If visitors from the future are thronging our streets, they will take care not to reveal themselves in any circumstance where such intervention would damage their own history. When a time machine gets into trouble, we can expect that maintenance backup crew will shuttle back and pull it out before someone in the innocent past stumbles over it. Time machines, if we did observe them, might well have a tendency to appear and disappear abruptly, unless they must first voyage through space to the vicinity of a naked singularity. To a naive observer, this would look like “dematerialization” or “teleportation.” A single temporal device studying a given vicinity could flip from date to date without changing its geographical position (assuming that it could compensate for the motion of the earth through space, an engineering problem facing all time machine designers). The impression would thus be created of a space vehicle returning to the spot at different intervals. For the time travelers, the experienced sequence would be like a time-lapse film run straight through, while for conventional observers there might be a gap of weeks or years between visits. If we were very lucky, one way to distinguish such time machines from space vehicles could be a periodicity in the visits relating to our arbitrary calendars, rather than to the time it would take to get here from an extraterrestrial origin. In other words, if anomalous craft were seen dropping in on the first of every month, we might suppose that their occupants employ the same arbitrary calendar as western twenty-first century cultures, or at least know about them. Even more radically: if time travel of a psychic kind is ever developed (perhaps a machine-boosted form of remote viewing), selective telepathic contact with the past might prove feasible. A future historian might tune his amplified\n\n28\n\nD. Broderick\n\npsychic presence to an alchemist in the Middle Ages, appearing to him as a “demon” whom others would be incapable of seeing. It is notable that throughout recorded history, in many dispersed societies, momentous events are said to have been attended by “comets,” “signs in the sky” not always attributable to stellar or meteorological conditions. What’s more, astute if superstitious soothsayers have claimed that these “omens” precede the events, as well as accompanying them. It is as if someone interested in the crisis had known it was due, and had checked out the circumstances leading up to it. Astronomer Carl Sagan, an early proponent of life beyond the Earth, estimated that our planet can expect a visit from extraterrestrial sources on average only once every thousand years. But if such craft possess temporal maneuverability to match their interstellar capacity (and the latter, providing access to black holes, might permit the former), we could expect observation from alien cultures that discover Earth not today but in millennia to come. A truly gruesome explanation for their interest in our present era cannot be discounted. In the five billion years remaining before earth is crisped in the Sun’s terminal flame, many thousands or millions of alien spacecraft might stumble on a wrecked, desolate planet, and wonder at the poignant ruin they behold. Filled with curiosity and pity, they might follow back the four-­ dimensional worldline to the bitter epoch leading to the time when human civilization finally destroyed itself and its world: the second half of the twenty-­ first century… In his excellent book Time Travel in Einstein’s Universe, Professor J. Richard Gott explains his motivation in pursuing this apparently loony topic: Why are physicists like me interested in time travel? It’s not because we are hoping to patent a time machine in the near future. Rather, it’s because we want to test the boundaries of the laws of physics. The paradoxes associated with time travel pose a challenge… a clue that some interesting physics is waiting to be discovered. (29)\n\nSelf-consistency is one way such researchers have found to evade what seem to be an assured deadly outcome. It allows visits to the past only if no change is made to a history known to have occurred in a certain way. Gott observes that arriving at self-consistent solutions—in fact, numerous ones—always seems possible from a given set of starting conditions, as suggested by Thorne, Novikov, and their collaborators in an elaborate series of thought experiments involving billiard balls going back in time. They tried to produced situations where a time-­\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\n29\n\ntraveling billiard ball would collide with its earlier self, deflecting its trajectory so it couldn’t enter the time machine in the first place. But they could always find a self-consistent solution where the collision was only a light tap that didn’t stop the ball from entering the time machine, but sent it on a path that made it nearly miss its earlier self… (20)\n\nIt’s necessary to look briefly at the way physics currently describes the fundamental stuff of which the universe is composed, whether seen as particles or fields. For it is in the realm of the ultra-small that we witness the boundary between ordinary reality and the probability realm of Superspace. High-energy physics is the science concerned with the ultimate constituents of matter, and after many years of creative confusion it has seemed for several decades on the verge of a powerful synthesis. Even so, the state of play in both theory and experimental findings alters almost weekly. The results can be surprising and ironic. In 1881 Albert Michelson first found evidence that the supposed universe-filling aether, through which light and other waves were supposed to swim, did not exist. Now, thanks to Large Hadron Collider experiments, an equally pervasive and mysterious phenomenon, the Higgs field (manifested as an identifiable boson particle), was shown in 2012 to exist. Physicist Peter Higgs and a colleague shared a Nobel prize for this discovery in 2013. The Higgs field, which gives other particles their mass, looks oddly like a tuned-up version of the nineteenth century aether. The old picture of the atom, composed of a nucleus of protons and neutrons orbited by planetary electrons, has long since broken down, though it remains a useful simplification in dealing with certain chemical reactions. Enormously expensive experiments revealed a bewildering array of more than 300 “elementary” particles, most of them so-called “resonances” so unstable that they exist for only fractions of a millionth of a second before decaying into new forms. Each is characterized by specific values and properties, some well-known— mass, charge, spin—others arcane—strangeness, charm, and so on. These create binding and repelling forces by shuttling quanta (or “energy packets”) back and forth between them. And, crucially, not all the particles are subject to all the interactions, or forces. To date, science knows only four kinds of basic forces (or maybe three), though several candidates for a fifth have been proposed. Until some 40 years ago, it was thought that none of them was reducible to any other. They are gravity (the feeblest); the weak nuclear force (1025 times stronger than gravity) and electromagnetism (1036 times), which are really manifestations of an electroweak force; and the strong nuclear force (1038 times stronger). That is, the\n\n30\n\nD. Broderick\n\nstrong nuclear force is more powerful than gravity by a factor written out fully as a one followed by 38 zeroes. But the strong force is correspondingly limited in range, operating over a maximum distance of a trillionth of a millimeter. The concept of “force” itself is frequently seen as only a convenient abstraction for the varieties of interaction between elementary particles. These interactions are thus the result of exchanges of energy bundles or quanta. For example, two electrons repel one another electrically by swapping a photon, the radiant particle that, at different frequencies, constitutes gamma rays, visible light, heat and radio waves. Nucleons such as the proton and neutron (themselves comprised of more fundamental particles) are bound by an exchange of pions (giving rise to the strong force) and the W or intermediate vector bosons (which carry the weak force responsible for radioactivity). The story is far more complicated than that, but paradoxically it may also be simpler as well. In a sense, all the particles that engage in strong nuclear interactions (collectively termed hadrons, and including the proton and neutron) represent various excited states of just three point-like particles. It was realized half a century ago that the hadron resonances could be gathered into elegant groups according to a symmetry dictum, and this was confirmed experimentally three years later. It was quickly surmised that this regularity was due to the hadrons’ further internal structure, that they were composed of new, massive particles. This new class of fractionally-charged particles was dubbed quarks (rhymes with “corks”) by Murray Gell-Man, subsequently a Nobel laureate in physics. These quarks, with fractional charge, are stuck together, inevitably, by gluons—which come in eight varieties, color-coded. The force holding individual quarks together gets stronger as they are pulled apart, so they have never been seen. Particles called leptons, involved in weak nuclear interactions—the electron, the muon or “heavy electron,” and the tau, the heaviest, and their separate neutrinos—do seem to be genuinely elementary. At the same time, by a series of stunningly bold intellectual gambits, it was shown that a theory termed “broken gauge symmetry” can unify the weak and the electromagnetic forces into a single electroweak force, and the ultimate goal—still not realized—is the compression of all four known forces, including gravitation, into a single force broken asunder near the Big Bang, as the expanding cosmos cooled, by the breaking of that original symmetric unity. There is something magnificent in a physics where, in the words of Dr. Christopher Llewellyn-Smith, “It turns out that although different parts of a calculation seem to yield meaningless results, the underlying symmetries lead to a wonderful cancellation of all absurdities leaving a sensible result when\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\n31\n\neverything is put together at the end.”1 The quantum theory explanation for the time traveler’s Grandfather paradox could be evaluated in the same words. But we have not quite finished laying the groundwork for that explanation. Simplicity in one place demands complexity in another. In short, perhaps, to borrow the motto of the United States: E pluribus unum. Baryons are thought to be composed of three quarks, while mesons are built from a quark and an antiquark. Gauge theory ended by requiring another three quarks (which ruins the Joycean poignancy of the name—“Three quarks for Muster Mark,” wrote James Joyce in Finnegans Wake), but apparently no more than that. The glorious metaphorical properties color, charm and flavor joined charge, isospin and strangeness. (Who said there was no romance, or at least whimsy, in science?) Straining our minds to the limit, we must understand that all these particles that together make up the matter around us interact dynamically with the vacuum of space. The zero-energy state of raw space seethes with activity we cannot detect directly. It is the source, you’ll recall, of the “virtual particles” brought into being by the intense gravitational field of a black hole. These pseudoparticles possess no direct physical interpretation, but they are not to be scoffed at. Consider a discussion by Dr. Sidney Drell (1926–2016), a professor emeritus at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, an accomplished violinist, a winner of the 2000 Enrico Fermi Award and a recipient of the National Medal of Science in 2012. The foundations of modern physics, he once observed, are the conservation laws, of which the most inviolable are those relating to energy and momentum. These quantities can be transferred, but “the sum of the energies and momenta before an interaction must be exactly equal to the sum afterward.” Alas, when an electron and positron meet headlong in a storage ring accelerator, each bearing the enormous mass/energy the device has imparted, and annihilate into pure light, the event breaches the most hallowed of conservation laws. Do physicists panic? No. For the emitted photon, which decays instantly into a range of other particles—re-creating mass from energy—is not a “real” photon. “It cannot be real,” Drell stated, “because it has the wrong proportions of energy and momentum.” Hence it is dubbed a “virtual photon,” and “its most important characteristic is that it can never be observed… because it decays before it can be detected. According to the uncertainty principle formulated by Werner New Scientist, Apr 10, 1975, 77\n\n1\n\n32\n\nD. Broderick\n\nHeisenberg, the lifetime of a virtual particle is necessarily too brief for the particle to be observed.” This is just as well, for if it could be observed it would be seen to be an impossible entity and it would be obliged never to have existed. So to speak. Nor is this almost incomprehensible effect restricted to black hole regions and linear accelerators. Stephen Hawking once noted: Quantum mechanics implies that the whole of space is filled with pairs of “virtual” particles and antiparticles that are constantly materializing in pairs, separating and then coming together again and annihilating each other … They cannot be observed directly with a particle detector. Their indirect effects can nonetheless be measured, and their existence has been confirmed by a small shift (the “Lamb shift”) they produce in the spectrum of light from excited hydrogen atoms.2\n\nThe physics of rotating black holes and naked singularities was first broached by the astronomer Roy P. Kerr in 1963. It is the “Kerr Metric” that leads to the portrait of wormhole spacetime channels hurling material instantly across a billion light years, with a corresponding shift backwards through negative time to a billion years in the past. But a decade later, a still more striking conception was announced by Frank J. Tipler (b. 1947), in Physical Review D. A mathematical physicist, Tipler still holds joint positions in the Departments of Mathematics and Physics at Tulane University. He argued that the principles of General Relativity, coupled with the properties of a particular kind of extremal phenomena somewhat similar to the black hole, allowed the design of a two-way time machine. The late Dr. Robert L. Forward, an expert researcher on gravity at the Hughes Research Laboratories, summarized these findings this way in his popular science book Future Magic (1988): Tipler’s time machine is a long cylinder of ultradense mass with a spin speed at its surface that is one-half that of light. The time-mixing region is near the midpoint of the cylinder, but outside the mass… The important feature of the Tipler Two-Way Time Machine is that it allows travel both backward and forward in time (depending upon whether you circle with or against the spin of the cylinder) and neither the time traveler not the time machine has to move at velocities close to that of light. (175)\n\n2 Stephen Hawking, 2nd Reith Lecture, 2016: https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment35421439\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\n33\n\nThis, you’ll note, is a great convenience for time machine operators, and a considerable advance over diving through the murderous event horizon of a collapsed star with a pretty definite guarantee of no-exit. Cosmic strings created at the Big Bang could fit the bill. Tipler concluded that an infinitely long cosmic string might not be needed, replaced by this constructed rotating cylinder perhaps a hundred miles long and containing the compressed mass of several black holes, spinning at half the speed of light. This, he argued, could create closed timelike lines that would permit time travel without necessarily ruffling the passenger’s hair. A few years later, Tipler found that special “exotic matter” would be needed, and even that might not be sufficient. Tipler’s approach was, at the time, a brand new idea to physics, and was quickly adopted in science fiction as “T machines” (manufactured bequests of an ancient interstellar civilization) by Poul Anderson in his novel The Avatar (1978). A massive cylinder of the kind required to meet Tipler’s specifications probably does not exist in nature. A quite different method (in principle) for traveling into the past and then back again has been explored at length by Richard Gott. It depends on the possible existence of cosmic strings, monstrous residues of the Big Bang epoch, where colossal amounts of energy are trapped inside fantastically narrow “strings” that might stretch across the entire universe, and under vast tension. By flying around such a string in a certain trajectory—assuming you could find one and reach it—you would be flung into a different time. Better still, corral two of these strings and juggle them until they are stretched parallel to each other. When people talk about “playing god,” this is the sort of scale that seems appropriate, so it will require an immensely powerful supercivilization to manage this gateway. Worse, as Gott points out in Time Travel in Einstein’s Universe: A collapsing loop of string large enough to allow you to circle it once and go back in time one year would have more than half the mass-energy of an entire galaxy. But a worse problem exists—such a massive string would become so compact as it collapses that it would be in danger of forming a black hole. (110)\n\nAnd nobody wants to get caught by one of those. It is not impossible, though, that sometime in the future our descendants will have the prowess and energy resources to construct one. If that day comes, time travel will be a reality. If so, isn’t it plausible that those descendants will return through time (or send probes high in the sky, or perhaps invisibly small) to view us, their ancestors? It is equally possible that if intelligence is arisen on other worlds, already\n\n34\n\nD. Broderick\n\nin existence or evolving in the future, alien beings might search not only the vast expanses of our current universe but also the deep multi-billion year epochs of past and future. And find us, here and now. Another dramatic novelty of the second half of the last century was the possibility of tachyons, particles that travel only faster than light. Unlike Feynman’s antiparticles, whose proposed motion backwards in time is a matter of interpretation, tachyons must exist in a condition of time reversal (if they exist at all, and so far there is no evidence for that). Strangely enough, these hypothetical particles do not abrogate Einstein’s dictum that nothing can accelerate through and past the speed of light in vacuum, for tachyons always have velocities swifter than light and cannot go slower than that. They arise, in fact, as a direct consequence of Relativity. Since they are a kind of reversal of our sub-luminal physics, they possess certain bizarre properties. The slowest state of a tachyon is just barely above the speed of light, and it spends most of its existence there. As it loses energy (from a trail of gravitational radiation, Gott argues), its momentum increases, until it is traveling infinitely fast—its worldline smeared out across all of the universe. Why and how? In his 1992 book In Search of the Edge of Time, John Gribbin noted that the speed of light in a medium such as water is lower than the vacuum velocity specified as the faster speed possible. So a charged particle moving faster than the ambient limit sheds energy in a flash of photons, an effect named for its discovered, Pavel Cherenkov. Hence, A charged tachyon, moving faster than light even in a vacuum, would also have to emit Cherenkov radiation, as long as it has any energy available to radiate… [losing] all its energy literally in a flash, ending up with zero energy and traveling at infinite speed. (210)\n\nSo even if we had a way to locate tachyons and couple them to our instruments (and would-be time machines), they would be difficult if not impossible to steer. Their importance to the Time Machine Hypothesis, if they prove to be real, might become paramount as a means of communication. In Gregory Benford’s notable novel Timescape, they become the means of transmitting an urgent warning message to the past and thereby saving the world (or a world) from a planet-damaging blight. Unfortunately, if Gott is correct, “tachyons would spend most of the time moving at just barely over light-­ speed. Therefore, tachyons could not be used to send energy or information faster than light over macroscopic distances” (Gott 2001, 127–28). A far less extravagant project for reclaiming the past has been the main undertaking of Professor Ronald Mallett, an African-American physicist\n\n3 Closed Timelike Loops\n\n35\n\nwhose father died at 33 from a heart attack induced by heavy smoking, when Ron was just 10 years old. Reading a comic book version of Wells’s The Time Machine fired the child’s imagination and set him on the path to devising a time machine of his own, hoping to travel back to his childhood and persuading his beloved gadgeteer father to abandon smoking. In a 2018 BBC Horizon science program titled How to Build a Time Machine, he declared: “I think of myself as being an ordinary person with a passion, and my passion is the possibility of time travel.”3 This passion led him to computer work for the US air force and then a General Relativity PhD from Penn State University on time reversal in a de Sitter universe, one of the early cosmological models that had predicted acceleration of the expanding cosmos only proved in 1998. He knew that massive objects subject spacetime in their vicinity to the phenomenon of “frame dragging,” where the fabric of space and time is twisted by powerful gravity— something predicted especially of stellar-scale black holes, but caused even by the Earth’s gravity. His hope, expressed in an experimental laboratory research program, is that frame dragging on a small but detectable scale can be initiated and sustained in a ring laser. The gravitational field of intensely energetic light beams would twist local spacetime into a kind of helix that generates a closed timelike loop, where the temporal direction is reversed. He published his findings in 2000. So far he has only a tabletop device, potentially capable of firing particles into the past, showing proof of concept and eventually thus transmitting messages but nothing on the scale of a human being. That would be a remarkable and literally history-changing invention, but it would not be able to save Professor Mallett’s father’s life because theory insists that time machines would be limited to the period following their earliest activation. Since 2013 to the present, he has been Professor Emeritus and Research Professor, Department of Physics, University of Connecticut. Performing such experiments on hand-built rigs is necessarily expensive, and getting such a device to the stage of practical time reversal would cost millions of dollars. As I write, Mallett is already 73 years old, and his opportunities to gain grants for such work are limited. The director Spike Lee holds the rights to make a feature-length movie of his quest, and if that eventuates perhaps sponsors will fund further research. https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-44771942. Mallett’s visionary quest is discussed in moderate detail in a chapter (228–36) of Brian Clegg’s book that shares the same title with the BBC program and Paul Davies’ book, and in a Wikipedia entry at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Ronald_Mallett 3\n\n36\n\nD. Broderick\n\nMeanwhile, though, skeptical academics have found fault with his analysis. Several serious objections were raised by Ken D. Olum and Allen Everett in 2005,4 starting with the exceptional energies need to drive it, and a calculation that the ring of lasers would need to be larger than the circumference of the universe. At one time Mallet made what seems an elementary error in proposing that slowing the laser light via a superfluid medium would solve some of the problems, but as Richard Gott argued, this confuses such confined effects with the speed of light in a vacuum (c) which is the relevant parameter in General Relativity theory. It seems unlikely that Ronald Mallett’s search will lead us to a pathway into the past.\n\n“Can a circulating light beam produce a time machine?” (Foundations of Physics Letters. 18 (4): 379–85).\n\n4\n\n4 Don’t Change the Past\n\nThe most lucid book on black holes and time warps, published by Professor Kip Thorne in 1994, is titled, unsurprisingly, Black Holes and Time Warps, and remains both enjoyable and authoritative more than 20 years later. Startlingly, perhaps, the final chapter is titled “Wormholes and Time Machines,” and Thorne is careful to provide a footnote taking responsibility for writing the book “solely from my own personal viewpoint” (483). It is a rich resource on the foundations of both topics, and has some detailed and clearly illustrated accounts of possible time machines. This topic was horrifying to the era’s solemn custodians of science, so Thorne and his friends were initially cautious lest they be represented as lunatics or “sci fi” cultists. It was a real concern. In 1987, when Thorne was first convinced that wormholes might become time machines (of a kind), a close friend told Thorne’s wife of his concern that Kip had “gone a little crazy or senile or…” Thorne realized that care would need to be taken “about how we presented our research to the community of physicists and to the general public.” When these findings were published at last, the anxious friend remained anxious that reputations would be sullied. Luckily, the research program was not slain in the crib. Thorne notes: My Russian friend Igor Novikov, by contrast, was ecstatic… “I’m so happy, Kip! You have broken the barrier. If you can publish research on time machines, then so can I !” And he proceeded to do so, forthwith. (505, 508)\n\nIt is fascinating to track the papers they succeeded in placing in Physical Review D and other heavy-duty journals, starting more than 20 years ago. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019 D.

Broderick\n\nThese new analyses were compelling—no doubt because the power of general relativity was employed as their basis—and the documents are now part of the canon, even if still at the boundary. We can read explorations of closed timelike curves and wormhole time machines by Kip Thorne and associated scholars: Joe Polchinski (1954–2018), Fernando Echeverria (whose research with Thorne included “Self-consistency in wormhole spacetimes with closed timelike curves”), Gunnar Klinkhammer (whose 1992 Caltech dissertation was on Multiply Connected Spacetimes and Closed Timelike Curves in Semiclassical Gravity), Ulvi Yurtsever (work on Classical and quantum instability of compact Cauchy horizons in two dimensions), Richard Gott, and others. One of the classic arguments attempting to refute the possibility of time travel to the past is the apparent inevitability of messing with the present and future by making changes to past events. This, it was felt, had a high probability (and paradox-creating risk, as noted above) of preventing the traveler’s own existence. A disturbingly amusing sideways glance at such effects is provided by a Canadian cartoonist who uses the ’nym “Winston Rountree.”1 In “Doubt creeps in,” two early Nazis guard"
