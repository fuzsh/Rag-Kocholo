        "text": "An international money prize was being offered to the first man to complete an interplanetary journey, and Dale Currance, the famous aircraft designer, volunteered as the British entrant. With a hand-picked crew, he blasted off from Salisbury Plain in his own spaceship, GLORIA MUNDI, destination — Mars. But once free of the Earth’s atmosphere, he discovered a stowaway on board — a woman.\n\nJoan and her strange quest should have prepared them better for the fantastic world that waited far out in the darkness of space. But the men from Earth were from a relatively young and hopeful civilisation, while Mars was a dying planet. Its inhabitants knew they could survive in one way only — a way too abhorrent for the Earthmen to comprehend. Only Joan realised they might have a lesson to learn from the Martian race. For one day Earth would die, too…\n\nThis early novel from a classic science fiction writer shows the brilliant visionary talent that later produced THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS and THE MIDWICH CUCKOOS.\n\nShots of the future from the author of The Day of the Triffids\n\nJohn Wyndham catapults the reader of these stories into a world where time barriers have ceased to exist, where there is discrimination against Martians, where not only thought transference but body transference is an everyday event. Yet so convincing are the inhabitants of this extraordinary world, that its remoteness vanishes in a second.\n\nWritten at the same time as The Day of the Triffids, the completed manuscript of Plan for Chaos was seen by only a handful of people before Wyndham abandoned it, unpublished and overshadowed by its companion‘s sudden and phenomenal success. It has remained unpublished for some forty years since Wyndham‘s death.\n\nIn a city much like New York, a series of identical women are found dead in suspicious circumstances. Magazine photographer Johnny Farthing, who is reporting on the suspected murders, is chilled to discover that his fiancée looks identical to the victims too – and then she disappears. As his investigations spiral beyond his control, he finds himself at the heart of a sinister plot that uses cloning to revive the Nazi vision of a worId-powerful master race…\n\nPart detective noir, part dystopic thriller, Plan for Chaos reveals the legendary science fiction novelist grappling with some of his most urgent and personal themes."
