(I was also doing others things—mostly having a family and being a professor of physics at the University of California, Irvine.)\n\nMany readers have written asking for parts of this book, so I decided to assemble all I’ve written about the series, plus some perspectives by others. As I write later stories, I’ll include them in later editions of this Companion—one of the advantages of keeping it only in ebook form, and so easily amended. (For example, At the Double Solstice and Mandikini are in this second edition. I had simply forgotten these stories when I did the first edition in 2013.)\n\nA bit more on the contents:\n\nA Hunger for the Infinite\n\nA novella written after I finished the six book series.\n\nMandikini\n\nI wrote this commissioned work for The Universe (1987), which combined scientific essays with fiction. The editor, Byron Preiss, asked me to write both aspects for the Galaxy theme, but I stuck to fiction. It helped me flesh out the elements I would later use in novels.\n\nAt the Double Solstice\n\nI wrote this for a chapbook by Cheap Street Press, and then for a tribute volume to my old friend, Terry Carr (with whom I edited a fanzine when I was a teenager). It, too, helped me get ideas for later novels.\n\nGalactic Center Astronomy, 2013\n\nA quick summary, with observations of the galactic center in several spectral regions—plus an anticipation of what may happen in the 2013-2014 flyby of a large cloud, swooping around the black hole there.\n\nLife At Galactic Center\n\nThe biology I envisioned there.\n\nWriting The Galactic Center Series\n\nThoughts on writing a series, almost without meaning to.\n\nAstrophysical Journal, 1988: An Electrodynamic Model of the Galactic Center\n\nMy first published paper on the physics of the galactic center. This model seems to describe pretty well the strange long filaments observed there, and still is referenced.\n\nPerspectives\n\nMy selection of reviews and commentaries on the series. Not always favorable, but with point of view differing from my own. (Few writers are good critics, and none is reliable when commenting on their own works.)\n\nIf you want to comment on this book, or anything else, please go to gregorybenford.com and leave a post.\n\nA bit of history\n\nI began the series without thought of doing more than a few stories: In the Ocean of Night (1972) [as by Greg Benford], Icarus Descending (1973), Threads of Time (1974), A Snark in the Night (1977).\n\nBy then I saw that these threads knitted together, and so set about writing just one novel to stitch them firmer, In the Ocean of Night (1977). By this time my research was well funded at UC Irvine and I traveled extensively, taking sabbaticals in Cambridge, England, in 1976 and Italy in 1979 and 1982. I worked on jets of matter from energetic galactic centers, black holes, and pulsars, as well as assembling a laboratory group at UCI to study relativistic plasma dynamics in highly energetic experiments. I liked doing theory and experiment together.\n\nI returned to the series because my unconscious wouldn’t let me alone. To quote from another part of this book, All this while scenes, ideas, and characters popped into my head as I worked on other books. By this time I had learned to follow my unconscious. If I didn’t, I stalled on other projects. Slowly I realized that a larger series of novels yawned before me.\n\nSo I wrote them:\n\nAcross the Sea of Suns (1984)\n\nGreat Sky River (1987)\n\nTides of Light (1989)\n\nThen a gap, brought on by my wife’s illness and a lot of research work. I was by then running a considerable laboratory program and writing a dozen or two scientific papers a year. After I got some tasks finished, I returned and finished the series:\n\nFurious Gulf (1994)\n\nSailing Bright Eternity (1995)\n\nYears later, Robert Silverberg asked me to contribute \"A Hunger for the Infinite\" (1999) to his Far Horizons anthology. I note now Goodreads.com describes it so: (They reach) True Center in order to destroy something, anything, important to the Mechs, but Paris had something else on his mind. A story of the Mantis, and the decline of humans beginning in 3600 AD. A reader noted the series’ vertigo-inducing time spans which is certainly true. The events stretch from the early 2000s to A.D. 37518, an immense scope imposed because its central focus, our galactic center, is 28,000 light-years away. Characters had to get there to take part in the galaxy’s larger games, and a core assumption I nearly always use in fiction is there can be no faster-than-light travel. Indeed, getting above 0.1c is very hard.\n\nI welcome further comments on the series. I may return to it for other stories, too, if there’s interest. It’s certainly a big landscape!\n\nThanks—\n\nTo all those who helped me with this Companion and the series itself: Editors Lou Aronica, James Frenkel and Betsy Mitchell.\n\nInnumerable scientists, especially James Benford, Mark Morris, Virginia Trimble, Martin Rees, Roger Blandford and Jean Eilek.\n\nThe Lucky Bat team, especially Judith Harlan, Cindie Geddes and Jeff Posey. Dave Truesdale was especially helpful.\n\nLastly, to the many critics (some included in this Companion) who let me know how the books were coming over. Critics, like alcohol, are useful—you just have to know how much to take.\n\nColorful depiction of our galaxy\n\nA Hunger For The Infinite\n\nDeath came in on sixteen legs.\n\nIf it is possible to look composed while something angular and ominous is hauling you up out of your hiding place, a thing barbed and hard and with a gun-leg jammed snug against your throat—then Ahmihi was composed.\n\nHe had been the Exec of the Noachian ’Sembly for decades and knew this corner of Chandelier Rook the way his tongue knew his mouth. Or more aptly, for the Chandelier was great and vast, the way winds know a world. But he did not know this thing of sleek, somber metal that towered over him.\n\nHe felt himself lifted, wrenched. A burnt-yellow pain burst in his sensorium, the merged body/electronic feeling-sphere that enveloped him. Behind this colored agony came a ringing message, not spoken so much as implanted into his floating sense of the world around him:\n\nI wish to talk—to convey linear meaning.\n\nYeasay, and you be—? He tried to make it nonchalant and failed, voice guttering out in a dry gasp.\n\nI am an anthology intelligence. I collapse my holographic speech to your serial inputs.\n\nDamn nice of you.\n\nThe gun-leg spun him around lazily like a dangling ornament, and he saw three of his people lying dead on the decking below. He had to look away from them, to once-glorious beauties that were now a battered panorama. This section of the Citadel favored turrets, galleries, gilded columns, iron wrought into lattices of byzantine stillness. It was over a millennium old, grown by biotech foundries, unplanned beauty by mistake. The battle—now quite over, he saw—had not been kind. Elliptical scabs of orange rust told of his people, fried into sheets and splashed over walls. White waste of disemboweled bodies clogged corners like false snow. An image-amp wall played endlessly, trying to entertain the dead. Rough-welded steel showed ancient repairs beneath the fresh scars of bolt weaponry that had sliced men and women into bloody chunks.\n\nI broke off this attack and intervened to spare you.\n\nHow many of my people…are left?\n\nI count 453—no, 452; one died two xens ago.\n\nIf you’ll let them go—\n\nThat shall be your reward, should you comply with my desire for a conversation. You may even go with them.\n\nHe let a glimmer of hope kindle in him.\n\nThis final mech invasion of Chandelier Rook had plundered the remaining defenses. His Noachian Assembly had carried out the fighting retreat while other families fled. Mote disassemblers had breached the Chandelier’s kinetic-energy weapons, microtermites gnawing everywhere. Other ’Semblies had escaped while the Noachians hung on. Now the last act was playing out.\n\nRook was a plum for the mechs. It orbited near the accretion disk of the black hole, the Chandelier’s induction nets harvesting energy from infalling masses and stretched space-time.\n\nIn the long struggle between humans and mechs, pure physical resources became the pivot for many battles. It had been risky, even in the early, glory days after mankind reached the Galactic Center, to build a radiant, massive Chandelier so close to the virulent energies and sleeting particle hail near the black hole itself: mech territory. But mankind had swaggered then, ripe and unruly from the long voyage from Earth system.\n\nNow, six millennia since those glory days, Ahmihi felt himself hoisted up before a bank of scanners. His sensorium told of probings in the microwave and infrared spectra. Cool, thin fingers slid into his own cerebral layers. He braced himself for death.\n\nI wish you to view my work. Here…\n\nSomething seized Ahmihi’s sensorium like a man palming a mouse, squeezed—and he was elsewhere, a flat broad obsidian plain. Upon which stood…things.\n\nThey had all been human, once. Now the strange wrenched works were festooned with contorted limbs, plant growths, shafts of metal and living flesh. Some sang as winds rubbed them. A laughing mouth of green teeth cackled, a cube sprayed tart vapors, a blood-red liquid did a trembling dance.\n\nAt first he thought the woman was a statue. But then breath whistled from her wrenched mouth. Beneath her translucent white skin pulsed furious blue-black energies. He could see through her paper-thin skin, sensing the thick fibers that bound muscle and bone, gristle and yellow tendons, like thongs binding a jerky, angular being…which began to walk. Her head swiveled, ratcheting, her huge pink eyes finding him. The inky patch between her legs buzzed and stirred with a liquid life, a strong stench of her swarmed up into his nostrils, she smiled invitingly—\n\nNo! He jerked away and felt the entire place telescope away. He was suddenly back, dangling from the gun-leg. What is this place?\n\nThe Hall of Humans. An exhibition of art. Modesty compels me to add that these are early works, and I hope to achieve much more. You are a difficult medium.\n\nUsing…us?\n\nFor example, I attempted in this artwork to express a coupling I perceive in the human world-sum, a parallel: often fear induces lust shortly after, an obvious evolutionary trigger function. Fear summons up your mortality, so lust answers with its fleeting sense of durability, immortality.\n\nAhmihi knew this Mantis was of some higher order, beyond anything his ’Sembly had seen. To it, their lives were fragmented events curved into…what? So the Mantis thought of itself as an artist, studying human trajectories with ballistic precision.\n\nHe thought rapidly. The Mantis had some cold and bloodless passion for diseased art. Accept that and move on. How could he use this?\n\nYou share with others (those who came from primordial forces) a grave limitation: you cannot redesign yourselves at will. True, you carry some dignity, since you express the underlying First Laws.\n\nStill, you express in hardware what properly belongs in software.\n\nAn unfortunate inheritance. Still, it provides ground for aesthetic truths.\n\nIf your kind would just leave us alone—\n\nSurely you know that competition for resources, here at the most energetic realm of the galaxy, must be…significant. My kind too suffers from its own drive to persist, to expand.\n\nIf you’d showed up when we had full Chandelier strength, you’d be lying in pieces by now.\n\nI would not be so foolish. In any case, you cannot destroy an anthology intelligence. My true seat of intelligence is dispersed.\n\nMy aesthetic sense, primary in this immediate manifestation, still lodges strongly in the Hall of Humans that I have constructed light-years away. You visited it just now.\n\nWhere? He had to keep this angular thing of ceramic and carbon steel occupied. His people could still slip away—\n\nQuite near the True Center and its Disk Engine. You shall visit it again in due time if you are fortunate and I select you for preservation.\n\nAs suredead?\n\nI find you primates an entrancing medium.\n\nWhy don’t you just keep us alive and talk to us? He was sorry he had asked the question, for instantly, from the floor below, the Mantis made a corpse rise. It was Leona, a mother of three who had fought with the men, and now had a trembling, bony body blackened by Borer weaponry. Hollow eyes yearned upward.\n\nYou are a fragile medium-pay witness. I do know how to express through you, though it is a noise-thickened method.\n\nInevitably you die of it. But if you prefer—\n\nShe teetered on broken legs and peered up at him. Her mouth shaped words that whistled out on separate exhalations, like a bellows worked by an unseen hand.\n\nI find this…overly hard-wired…medium is…constrained sufficiently…to yield…fresh insights.\n\nMy God, kill her. He thrashed against the pincers that held him aloft.\n\nI am…dead as…a human…But I remain…a medium.\n\nHe looked away from Leona. Don’t you have any sense of what she’s going through?\n\nMy level does not perceive pain as you know it. At best, we feel irreducible contradiction of internal states.\n\nWow, that must be tough.\n\nThe Mantis could not sense sarcasm, either.\n\nWorking her like a ventriloquist’s dummy, the Mantis made Leona cavort below, singing and dancing at a hideous heel-drumming pace, her shattered bones poking through legs caked with dried brown blood. Fluids leaked from the punctured chest.\n\nDamn it, just talk through my sensorium. Let her go!"
