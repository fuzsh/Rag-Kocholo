        "text": "1944 Lea, [Alec] Richard (1907-2003). The Outward Urge. A Novel. London: Rich & Cowan. NLS\n\nStarts with an authoritarian dystopia with various forms of direct control and London something like a concentration camp. By the end of the novel, the worst of the dystopia is gone and, while not a eutopia, there is a good society in contrast with the recent past. The author was born in Canada and lived in England from childhood."
