As this evolving process continues, it is imperative to be both adaptable and compliant in anticipation of hosting fans in the near future.”\n\nEssential game management personnnel and broadcast media will be allowed to attend games, the release said.\n\nThose who already have purchased season or single-game football tickets or have seating and suite contracts in Blue Devil Tower will be addressed via email, according to the release.\n\nDuke will offer fan cutouts for sale, with proceeds benefiting Duke Athletics. More information is available at GoDuke.com/DukeCutout.\n\nDuke opens its football season against Boston College on Sept. 19. Schedules for men’s and women’s cross country, field hockey, men’s and women’s soccer and volleyball have yet to be released."
