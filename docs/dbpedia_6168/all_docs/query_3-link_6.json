        "text": "DURHAM – Statistics for the Graduation Success Rate (GSR) released Wednesday by the NCAA indicated that a Power 5-leading 98 percent of freshmen student-athletes receiving scholarship aid, or recruited individuals participating in programs that do not offer athletic aid, graduated from Duke within six years.\n\nThe GSR is based on student-athletes who entered college as freshmen in 2013-16 and allows for the removal of those individuals from the cohort who left Duke in good academic standing.\n\nNationally, Duke led all Power 5 institutions with its 98 percent GSR and tied for sixth nationally. Only Columbia, Bucknell, Harvard, Villanova and Yale were above Duke.\n\nAmong Power 5 schools, the top five in GSR included Duke (98), Northwestern (98), Notre Dame (98), Boston College (98), Clemson (97), Stanford (97) and Vanderbilt (97).\n\nA total of 18 Duke teams achieved a 100 percent GSR for the 2013-16 period: baseball, men's and women's fencing, men's and women's golf, men's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, men's and women's swimming & diving, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's cross country & track and field, rowing, field hockey, softball and volleyball.\n\nDuke's remaining programs – men's basketball (78), women's basketball (92), football (93), women's lacrosse (96) and wresting (96) – achieved a GSR of 78 percent or better.\n\nIn the ACC, Duke's overall mark led the conference, along with Boston College (98) and Notre Dame (98), followed by Clemson (97), Virginia (96), Wake Forest (96), Miami (94), Syracuse (94), Louisville (93), Pittsburgh (93), Georgia Tech (92), North Carolina (92), NC State (92), Virginia Tech (92) and Florida State (87).\n\n#GoDuke"
