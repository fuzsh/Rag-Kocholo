        "text": "Krzyzewskiville (K-Ville) is a pre-basketball game phenomenon where students, aka Cameron Crazies, vie for sought-after seats by living in tents outside Cameron Indoor Stadium for weeks at a time.\n\nThis campus-wide celebration marks the transition of the first-year class moving from the bricks of East Campus to the gothic stones of West Campus.\n\nMidnight Breakfast is a themed, late-night study break hosted by the East Campus Council and Duke Dining Services in the Marketplace at the end of each semester.\n\nLDOC is a celebration of the last day of undergraduate classes in which students can come together to celebrate a hard year of work with food, festivities, and a culminating concert on Abele Quad. Students sip smoothies from pineapples and dance in the Silent Disco.\n\nOn Wednesday evenings the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture hosts live jazz performances that can treat a mid-week slump with a boost of musical energy.\n\nThe benches dotting campus are all designed, constructed, and painted by Duke students. But some of these benches wonâ€™t last long. After cheering on the Blue Devils in Cameron Indoor Stadium, students flood Abele Quad for a victorious bench burning bonfire.\n\nEach year a new batch of first years is welcomed to campus by colorful murals on the East Campus Bridge. Throughout the year, student groups advertise their events with a new splash of paint."
