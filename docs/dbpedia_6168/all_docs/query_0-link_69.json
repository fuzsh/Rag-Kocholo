        "text": "Although athletics are a critical part of the college experience for many students, only some universities provide the academic support, world-class training facilities, and successful programs to be recognized among the best colleges for student athletes. In this article, we have ranked some of the highest-rated post-secondary institutions based on a number of specific criteria such as academic prowess and the number of NCAA titles earned. If you are a student athlete and trying to narrow down your options for furthering your education, check out the 25 best colleges for student athletes below.\n\nMethodology\n\nThis ranking list was developed with the goal of helping student athletes choose the school that best meets their professional, academic, and athletic goals. Rankings are based on information from each school’s website, U.S. News & World Report, the National Center for Education Statistics College Navigator database, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). We analyzed each institution based on factors such as tuition information, student-to-faculty ratios, graduation rates, national rankings, and NCAA standings based on the point values outlined below.\n\nAverage Cost of Attendance\n\nWe understand how important the cost of tuition is when selecting a college or university. When narrowing down your options, keep in mind that not all inexpensive programs will meet your needs, and not all costly programs are of high academic quality. For the purpose of this list, we took the total cost of tuition, averaging the school’s in-state and out-of-state tuition rates, and assigned points as follows.\n\nPoints:\n\nUnder $20,000: 3 points\n\n$20,001 to $39,999: 2 points\n\n$40,000 or more: 1 point\n\nGraduation Rates\n\nA school’s graduation rate is a strong indicator of the quality of its faculty, academic programs, student learning outcomes, and student satisfaction. In other words, if graduation rates are low, it may mean that students were disappointed by the faculty, did not receive the academic support they needed, or that they did not find the school affordable. Therefore, we have awarded the most points to schools with the highest graduation rates and the fewest points to those with low graduation rates.\n\nPoints:\n\nMore than 50 percent: 3 points\n\nBetween 30 percent and 50 percent: 2 points\n\nLess than 30 percent: 1 point\n\nStudent-to-Faculty Ratio\n\nStudent-to-faculty ratio is an important factor for students seeking a more personal academic experience. Although there is a lot to be said for the opportunities provided by larger universities and colleges, smaller schools with lower student-to-faculty ratios are known for offering individualized mentoring, nurturing close student-faculty relationships, and providing chances for more specialized studies, regardless of the degree pursued.\n\nPoints:\n\n10:1 or lower: 3 points\n\n11:1 to 15:1: 2 points\n\nHigher than 15:1: 1 point\n\nCollege Ranking\n\nStudent athletes who are in the processing of choosing a university or college should also keep in mind how any given school compares to other institutions across the country. U.S. News & World Report, a nationally recognized body, is an excellent resource for determining how schools rank in categories such as “Best Value School,” “Top Public School,” and “Best National University.”\n\nPoints:\n\nU.S. News & World Report: Best National University Ranking:\n\nTop 10: 5 points\n\nTop 25: 4 points\n\nTop 50: 3 points\n\nTop 75: 2 point\n\nTop 100: 1 point\n\nU.S. News & World Report: Top Public School, Best Value School Ranking:\n\nTop 25: 3 points\n\nTop 50: 2 points\n\nTop 100: 1 point\n\nNumber of NCAA Championships\n\nIn particular, the number of NCAA championships can be an invaluable statistic when choosing the best college for student athletes. In this article, we used the schools’ websites as well as information directly from the NCAA, the NCES, and U.S. News & World Report. After consulting these sources, we took the number of D1 team sports championships in each university’s history and assigned points according to the following table.\n\nPoints:\n\nMore than 100: 5 points\n\n75 to 100: 4 points\n\n50 to 75: 3 points\n\n26 to 50: 2 points\n\n25 or fewer: 1 point\n\nRanking Top 25 Best Colleges for Student Athletes\n\n25.

Fortunately, there are certain steps you can take to ensure you go about selecting the right school. First, ask yourself the following questions:\n\nWould you be happy on an intramural team, or do you want varsity membership and highly competitive opportunities?\n\nWhat level of participation are you seeking?\n\nWhat level of player are you? What are your athletic talents?\n\nDo you want to play without competition, or do you want a level of play that will challenge you to grow as an athlete?\n\nOnce you have a better understanding of your abilities and goals, you can begin to select colleges. It is important to look at schools other than those recruiting you; do your own research. Make sure you choose an institution for more than its coaches and athletes. If something were to happen and you were to sustain an injury that would prevent you from playing, you are left with the college, not the team.\n\nAlso, make sure you are considering the match of your talent and level of play and the school itself. There are three divisions within the NCAA: Division I, Division II, and Division III. Student athletes should note that Division I and II schools require eligibility based on coursework, achievement, and academics. Look at each website to learn more about the team and the program, and visit the campus. See the athletic facilities, meet the coaches, and ask questions. Although this above list provides a solid starting point, only after you have conducted a thorough investigation in these areas will you be prepared to make an informed decision.\n\nAre There Benefits to Attending College as a Student Athlete?\n\nAlthough the reasons to earn a college degree are fairly obvious for traditional students — a higher salary, a more developed skill-set, and greater employment prospects — there are also several reasons why student athletes should consider pursuing a degree.

Each college regulated by the organization has established rules on financial aid, recruiting, and eligibility and falls into one of the three membership divisions (I, II, and III). These divisions are based on the scope of the school’s athletic scholarships and programs as well as the size of the college. In order to play sports at an NCAA Division I or II school, the student must:\n\nGraduate from high school.\n\nEarn a minimum score on the ACT or SAT.\n\nComplete a certain number of core courses in high school.\n\nEarn a minimum grade-point average in these courses.\n\nThe term “core course” is given to high school classes by the NCAA. It refers to courses that meet certain academic criteria specified by the NCAA, and students must complete a certain number of these classes in order to be eligible to play on Division I and II teams. Students may check the database or view a list of approved core courses in the NCAA Eligibility Center High School Portal. In addition, in order to be eligible to play at an NCAA Division I or II school, student athletes must follow amateurism rules regarding receiving prize money or a salary for playing with a professional team, athletic participation, and other areas.\n\nWhether you are certain you would like to play for a Division I or II school or you are considering a less-competitive Division III institution, the above list of the best colleges for student athletes can help to get you started as you compare the degrees, programs, and athletic opportunities that await you.\n\nAS Staff\n\nFebruary 2019\n\nThis concludes our ranking of the Top 25 Best Colleges for Student Athletes for 2019.\n\nOther Rankings of Interest:"
