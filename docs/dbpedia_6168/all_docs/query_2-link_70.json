The winner of that match will face the winner of Texas vs. Texas A&M in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe trip to the national tournament is the eighth for head coach Ben Sohrabi, his third in the last five seasons. Sohrabi and the Highlanders last won the Big South Tournament title in 2019 and 2018.\n\nRadford and Duke have met four times over the years with three of those meetings coming in the First Round of the NCAA Tournament. In 2011 the Highlanders fell 5-0 and in 2008 the team fell 5-1 with McKenzie Vergara scoring the lone goal for Radford.\n\nTICKET INFORMATION\n\nTickets for Saturday's NCAA first round contest will be $8 for adults (18 & older), $5 for students (3-17) and two and under are free. A link to buy tickets will be available soon.\n\nFOLLOW WOMEN'S SOCCER ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFor more information on the Radford Women's Soccer team follow @RadfordWSOC on Twitter and Instagram, as well as Radford Women's Soccer on Facebook."
