        "text": "DURHAM — Duke Athletics announced Tuesday that Therabody has been named the Official Recovery Partner for the Blue Devils.\n\nStudent-athletes across Duke’s 27 varsity sports will immediately have access to Therabody products including Theragun percussive therapy, RecoveryAir pneumatic compression boots, PowerDot electric stimulation devices, and Wave Series vibration therapy rollers. Both student-athletes and the athletic training staff will participate in customized programming with performance and wellness experts from Therabody University, the company’s educational division, to optimize their use of Therabody’s cutting-edge wellness technologies.\n\n“We are excited for the partnership with Therabody,” said Hap Zarzour, Executive Director of Athletic Medicine at Duke. “Therabody provides the tools necessary to help our student-athletes prepare and recover effectively, optimizing their health and performance.”\n\nBeginning with men’s and women’s basketball games at Cameron Indoor Stadium, Theraguns will be available at the home team bench, held in custom-made, compact carrying cases that fit underneath each seat. Additionally, custom bench offerings will be displayed for other home events, including football.\n\n“Duke University has such a storied athletic program and their dedication to educating student-athletes on whole-body wellness and recovery perfectly aligns with our mission,” said Dr. Jason Wersland, Therabody Founder and Chief Wellness Officer. “When athletes prioritize their health and well-being from a young age, they are able to better understand the mind-body connection and leverage it to improve their performance. We hope Therabody solutions contribute to the continued success of the Blue Devils teams, and look forward to watching this generation of athletes for years to come.”"
