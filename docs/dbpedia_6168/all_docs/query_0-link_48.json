        "text": "Soren Nelson has been hired as the Leonard Center Manager & Assistant Event Management Director at Macalester College. Nelson, who will begin his duties in September, replaces Jarrett Yehlen, who left Macalester earlier this summer to assume a position with the University of Minnesota Athletics Department. Nelson comes to Macalester from Duke University.\n\nNelson is a 2005 graduate of Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where he was a two-year All-Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball standout and 1,000-point scorer for the Cobbers before graduating with a degree in Physical Education. He received a Master's degree in Management recently from the University of Mary (N.D.).\n\n“Soren has had an exceptional and diversified experience at Duke with his oversight of the Brodie Recreation Center and with his significant experience in athletics,” Macalester Director of Athletics Kim Chandler said. “This experience combined with his passion for Division III athletics and Macalester College will make him a tremendous addition to our staff.”\n\nNelson has worked in facility and game operations at Duke since 2005 and since April '09 has been the coordinator of the Brodie Recreation Center. He has been a counselor/coach of the Duke men's basketball camp and has worked in game setup for Duke's powerhouse basketball programs, as well as event management for the gymnastics, volleyball and wrestling programs. He has been involved in the planning, outfitting, and scheduling of the many athletic and recreation facilities at the Durham, North Carolina, institution.\n\n“My education at a liberal arts institution, participation in MIAC basketball, and experience scheduling athletic facilities, managing recreation centers, and in game operations have combined with my passion for Division III athletics and the state of Minnesota to make this position very appealing.” Nelson said."
