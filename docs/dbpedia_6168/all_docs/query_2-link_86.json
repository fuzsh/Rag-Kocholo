        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. — This always made sense, right? Go back to January, when Duke athletic director Kevin White, who has led the department since 2008, announced he would be retiring in August. Now, at a place like Duke, with its power and productivity and prestige, you can afford to go anywhere to find a suitable successor. It’s that good of a job.\n\nSo Duke officials did their due diligence. They hired a search committee, spoke to multiple candidates, considered all of their options. But this week the school landed on the person who made the most sense from the start: the one with deep knowledge of the school’s internal politics and mechanisms; the one with a novel-length résumé; and the one who spent the last decade-plus working right alongside White in steering Duke to arguably its most successful generation of athletics.\n\nNow Nina King will lead the department into the next era of college sports. Her comments during her introductory press conference on Friday at Cameron Indoor Stadium confirmed why she was the right choice.\n\n“I’m often asked, why Duke?” King said. “For me the answer is simple: Duke is a magical place. The commitment to excellence is unmistakable, and most importantly, the drive and ambition amongst all the Duke students is inspirational. The people of this community are passionate and dedicated. I am proud that Duke athletics plays a significant part in making Duke University so special. Duke is a top-10 institution in the country, a top-25 institution in the world, a pinnacle player in higher education. Why not?”\n\nSpeaking in terms of qualifications, there’s not much King hasn’t experienced. As Duke’s senior deputy director of athletics/administration, legal affairs and chief of staff, she has overseen the school’s various vaunted athletics programs, not to mention handling human resources, legal matters and other administrative affairs. She’s also a key line of communication between the university and athletics. Outside of Duke, King just finished serving as chair of the NCAA Division I women’s basketball committee — meaning she cleaned up much of the mess the NCAA made of this year’s women’s tournament — and still has another year on that committee. As an undergraduate at Notre Dame, she worked directly with the women’s swimming and diving program as a manager, before moving on to Tulane and earning her law degree. She has interned with the NCAA and one of its largest apparel partners, Nike. For all of this and more, in 2018 King was named one of Sports Business Journal’s 40 Under 40 — a clear sign of her rising star in the college sports world.\n\nAll of which is a long-winded way of saying, the only thing one could even attempt to hold against King, 42, is that she has never been an athletic director. But she has taught a sports business class with one of the best in the country, White, at Duke’s prestigious Fuqua School of Business. There are no holes on the résumé.\n\nKing wasn’t selected simply because of her résumé. Her promotion is just as much about her as a person, her ideas, her sense of where college sports are and where they’re going, that makes her an ideal fit for this job.\n\nFor starters, King’s promotion in itself is historic. She will become the first Black, female athletic director in school history, and she is one of just six female ADs at the Power 5 level — a number she was clear to point out as insufficient.\n\n“I want to show little girls who look like me that this is possible,” King said. “Six female ADs in the Power 5? I mean, three Black females? We need to do better. I’m happy to kind of be the next step towards progress, and I am committed to helping ensure that more females, more people of color, have opportunities like I do.”\n\nAnd as for her ideas, King’s comments suggest she’s more in line with new-age administrators who recognize the changes coming to college athletics. Rather than run from issues such as name, image and likeness legislation, or the transfer portal, King addressed those things head-on.\n\n“We should be a leader at the forefront of change. That’s what Duke is all about,” King said. “Name, image and likeness is a good thing. Change is OK. As (the) NCAA, as an organization, we need to remain nimble and flexible. We need to be ready to provide our student-athletes greater opportunities, and allow them to profit off their name, image and likeness with the appropriate guardrails. And I think that’s what we are all still trying to figure out.”\n\nThat’s the sound of someone who doesn’t just get it, but someone who wants to help shape the most beneficial path for all parties involved. In the case of NIL, simply adopting an accepting mindset gives Duke a leg up on most universities. But with the school’s branding abilities, the way it takes teenage athletes and turns them into marketable stars, doesn’t it make sense to put two and two together to lift everyone?\n\nKing’s stance on NIL appears to differ from her predecessor’s. Last summer White released a statement, which dovetailed off a letter UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham wrote to Kevin Lennon, the NCAA’s vice president of Division I, expressing “potential complications” related to NIL. Those complications, over the last 11 months, have not been uncomplicated whatsoever. In fact, if anything, they’ve become more confounding. Various states have passed, rescinded and reworked their own NIL bills, with several others being introduced in the U.S. Congress. Five states have enacted laws that take effect on July 1, meaning something has to happen before then. The NCAA is meeting on June 22-23 to potentially deliver that “something,” but it just as easily might not.\n\nThe reason for explaining all that, though, is to illustrate what a mess King will have to help handle. And rather than run from the inevitability of it all, as she said Friday, she and Duke are going to attack the problem head-on, and find a solution that benefits the school’s athletes. That’s part of King’s job, after all.\n\n“It’s really hard to apply NCAA legislation to institutions that are all different: private, public, small, big,” King said. “It’s a challenge and, frankly, very complicated, and I think that’s why it takes a very long time for the NCAA, us, to get it right. But we have to. We have to for our student-athletes.”\n\nThere is one other major element to King’s hiring, one that cannot be ignored: its coaches. Namely, two of them: Mike Krzyzewski and David Cutcliffe. Cutcliffe will be 67 in September. Krzyzewski turns 75 next February. No one is kicking either out the door, but the reality of their ages is what it is. White inherited both and avoided the inevitable task of replacing them. Now the burden falls on King.\n\nAnd while technically she’ll have those hires on her résumé, it’s not like she’ll bear all the blame should they go badly. Krzyzewski, much like Roy Williams did at North Carolina this spring, will have heavy say into who succeeds him. He might not be able to pick someone and anoint the hire himself, but damn close. Anyone suggesting otherwise is wrong. With the football hire, King will seemingly have more latitude, but again, she won’t be the only person with input. And if her involvement in Kara Lawson’s hiring as women’s basketball coach last year is any indication, King already knows the types of people most likely to succeed at Duke.\n\nIn the next few months, before King officially takes over, she said she’ll look to meet with all of the school’s head coaches, to get a firm understanding of their missions and program philosophy. She’ll also continue working alongside White, learning any procedural ropes she hasn’t — although that started already this week, when King filled in for White (due to a conflict he had) on a call with the ACC’s athletic directors.\n\nWith all of that said, Friday was as much a coronation as it was confirmation of something that made sense all along. And while King did have to prove she was the best choice for the job, she did. In that sense, Friday was also a celebration.\n\n“I am absolutely thrilled to be here,” King said as she closed her opening remarks. “I want you all to know I will work tirelessly every day to make the Duke family proud. I understand that there are great expectations for Duke athletics, and for me personally. I stand ready for the challenge and remain excited for the opportunity to serve our amazing coaches, staff, community and most importantly our student-athletes.”\n\nDuke athletics isn’t going anywhere. In King, the Blue Devils have not just their next leader, but also the ideal mix of person and professional to lead the department into its next era: the King era. The future.\n\n(Photos: Courtesy of Duke Athletics)"
