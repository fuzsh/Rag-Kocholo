        "text": "The Davidson baseball team will travel to No. 12 Duke Tuesday afternoon for a midweek non-conference contest.\n\nFirst pitch is set for 4 p.m. at Jack Coombs Stadium, the Blue Devils' on-campus facility.\n\nLATEST ON THE 'CATS\n\n• Davidson is 3-4 as it enters the second midweek game of the season, most recently winning two of three weekend games against Villanova.\n\n• Infielder Michael O'Shaughnessy leads the Atlantic 10 with a .462 average and 12 hits. He also ranks second in the league with 12 RBIs.\n\n• Infielder Eli Putnam is hitting .391 and, like O'Shaughnessy, has hit two home runs.\n\n• Freshman Jed Howard made his debut in the Villanova series and quickly made an impact. He was 7-for-11 at the plate (.636) and drove in five runs. That included a 4-for-4, four-RBI effort in Friday's win.\n\n• Pitchers Matt Weber and Cooper Cavanaugh have had the best showings on the mound to date. Weber has a 1.17 ERA in 7.2 innings, while Cavanaugh, a freshman, has a 2.89 ERA in 9.1 innings.\n\nSCOUTING THE BLUE DEVILS\n\n• The No. 12 Blue Devils are 7-0 and off to their best start since 2008, when they won their first 10 games.\n\n• Duke is coming off a weekend series sweep of Northwestern and opened the season with a 3-0 weekend at Coastal Carolina's Baseball at the Beach event.\n\n• The Blue Devils are hitting .344 as a team, led by Wallace Clark (.471) and Ben Miller (.414). Miller is one of four Blue Devils to hit three home runs. Duke has hit 20 so far.\n\n• Duke reached the NCAA Super Regionals last year, the program's third berth in the round of 16.\n\n• All the Super Regional appearances have come under the guidance of head coach Chris Pollard (2018, 2019, 2023).\n\nWILDCAT IN THE OTHER DUGOUT\n\n• Pollard is a 1996 Davidson graduate and pitched 309 innings as a Wildcat for coach Dick Cooke. He later joined Cooke's staff as an assistant.\n\n• Pollard was hired at Duke in 2012, and prior to his time in Durham, he was the head coach at Pfeiffer and Appalachian State.\n\n• Pollard is one of four Davidson alumni currently serving as Division I head coaches. The others are Mik Aoki (Richmond), Brett Boretti (Columbia) and Pete Hughes (Kansas State).\n\nSERIES HISTORY\n\n• The Davidson-Duke series dates to 1902, and the teams have played every year since 1987.\n\n• Duke has won the last four meetings and leads the series 102-33-1.\n\n• Davidson's last win came on March 10, 2020 in Charlotte when Brett Centracchio's walk-off home run gave the Wildcats a 7-6 victory. It was two days before college athletics stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
