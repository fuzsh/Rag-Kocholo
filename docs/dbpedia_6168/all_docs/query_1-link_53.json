We have been the training ground for hundreds of sports medicine doctors around the country.\n\nSports Injuries that Affect the Female Athlete\n\nSports injuries can affect women differently than men. Preventing sports injuries is our goal, and knowing how gender impacts the body is our specialty. We diagnose and treat female-specific injuries when they occur. Thatâ€™s important, whether you are a college-scholarship prospect, an Olympic hopeful, or a senior resuming a walking program after a fracture."
