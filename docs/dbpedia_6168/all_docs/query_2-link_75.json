        "text": "In a game defined by speed in transition and stellar defense, the North Carolina Tar Heels led Duke throughout regulation to take the win, 84-79, and sweep their rival in the regular season.\n\nThe Tar Heels controlled the pace throughout, scoring 19 fast break points to Duke's 6, and bullied the Blue Devils on their home court in a very physical game. Graduate guard Cormac Ryan made massive plays from tap to buzzer, recording a career-best 31 points and sinking 6 triples â€” the majority of his threes were from give-and-go plays. After a career performance against Duke in February, Harrison Ingram recorded his 7th consecutive game with either double-figure points or rebounds, scoring a double-double 14 points and 10 boards. The Tar Heels also clocked valuable bench points, with Seth Trimble, Jae'lyn Withers and Jalen Washington combining for 14.\n\nTyrese Proctor and Jared McCain put up screens all night to limit UNC's guards â€” specifically, the conference's leading scorer RJ Davis with just 9 points â€” while both scoring in the double figures to help Duke stay in the game. Center Kyle Filipowski exploded in the second half, recording eight points in the first three minutes out of the break, while totaling 19 second-half points. The Blue Devils closed their deficit to four or less on three separate occasions, but UNC didn't give them space to lead down the stretch.\n\nSee the final statistics here ðŸ“²\n\nWith the victory, the Tar Heels secure their first outright ACC regular season title since 2017 â€” their most recent national title season. With near-identical records, UNC at 25-6 and Duke at 24-7, the Tar Heels and Blue Devils will receive respective Nos. 1 & 2 seeds in the ACC tournament... Which could very well mean that another Tobacco Road rivalry game could be upon us.\n\nNorth Carolina's offensive strategy might as well be named after those stands in the airport with pre-packaged snacks. UNC guards Cormac Ryan and RJ Davis embodied a grab-n-go shooting offense in the opening minutes against Duke, dispatching their shots almost immediately after catching the ball beyond the three-point arc to notch an early 15-point lead (4-5 3PT).\n\nTo further handicap Duke's 37% shooting (2-11 from 3PT), the Tar Heels beat the Blue Devils to the basket, out-rebounding them 21-17. North Carolina is ranked No. 6 in the nation for defensive efficiency, and Harrison Ingram and Seth Trimble have made it exceedingly difficult for the Blue Devils to get good looks from beyond the arc... All while scoring a combined 13 points.\n\nAfter the first 15 minutes of regulation, though, Duke began to match the raucous energy of the arena, pushing the pace on a 10-4 scoring run and notching their first triples of the evening. Jared McCain secured a team-high 11 points in the first half along with six boards. The Blue Devils are 1-5 when trailing at half this year while UNC is 16-1 when leading at the break.\n\nThis year's regular-season ACC title is on the line as the Blue Devils and Tar Heels duke it out in Cameron Indoor this Saturday. Sure, records and rankings go out the window when these adversaries hit the hardwood. But what's happened since Duke took the eight-mile drive to the Dean E. Smith Center in February, and what's at stake for their final regular-season match? Take a look:\n\nLast meeting: When the Tar Heels and Blue Devils met a month ago, North Carolina stifled any flurry of Duke offensive production, dominating defensively with nine steals and forcing 11 turnovers, scoring 19 points off TOs. UNC utility player Harrison Ingram posted four steals himself along with a 21-point-13-board double-double performance to bother the Blue Devils on both ends. It was a battle in the post for bigs Armando Bacot and Kyle Filipowski â€” Bacot won the majority of their matchups, notching a team-high 25 points to lead the Tar Heels to a decisive 93-84 victory.\n\nUNC: The Tuesday after besting Duke, the then-No. 3 Tar Heels struggled to guard Clemson on the perimeter and registered their fifth loss of the season. Dropping another game to Syracuse, UNC almost fell out of the AP top 10, but has since redeemed itself with five consecutive victories, which included RJ Davis' record-breaking 42-point performance against Miami (FL). In their most recent game, the Tar Heels dominated Notre Dame by 33 points behind Davis' 4-6 shots from three... and Bacot's career-high 2-2 triples... A surprise to nearly every fan in the Smith Center.\n\nDUKE: Meanwhile, the Blue Devils have lost just one matchup since â€” the 83-79 slugfest against Wake Forest, which ensued the viral court storming in which Filipowski collided with a student, causing him to hobble off the court. Duke's Monday bout against NC State saw dominance on the offensive glass, with the Blue Devils nabbing 19 offensive boards for 23 second-chance points. Currently ranked No. 13 in the nation for 3PT percentage (38%), the Blue Devils struggled to get accurate looks against the Wolfpack, netting just 9 balls on 30 attempts from afar (30%). Though trailing by three at half â€” Filipowski had yet to put a point up â€” Duke found its cadence in the second behind Jeremy Roach and Jared McCain's combined 27 points.\n\nWhat will make the difference? Three-point efficiency, control of the possession and the rebounding game. Both teams average eight three-pointers per game and are capable of making massive runs from the perimeter. UNC barely got the rebounding edge last game, 35-34, and out-rebound the Blue Devils on average 41-36.7 this year â€” an advantage on the glass could be the difference. However, turnovers and defensive moves will halt momentum on either end, as North Carolina showcased in their last matchup, which ultimately decided the game. The Cameron Crazies tenting outside the arena will be in for a treat this Saturday."
