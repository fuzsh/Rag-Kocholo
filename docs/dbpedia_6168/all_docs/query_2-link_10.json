        "text": "DURHAM, N.C. – Duke University Athletics has expanded its existing relationship with Learfield – the media and technology company powering college athletics – to include Learfield Amplify Development, adding to Learfield Amplify’s comprehensive Ticket Sales, Premium Sales, and Customer Service Team already in place in Durham.\n\nLearfield Amplify Development will work directly with the Iron Dukes to grow year-round philanthropic support for Athletics’ teams, programs, and initiatives through the addition of an assistant director of development focusing on leadership annual giving. The Iron Dukes is the fundraising arm for Duke Athletics, providing an opportunity for alumni, family, and friends to support the athletics department. Iron Dukes members help provide much-needed resources to fund student-athlete scholarships, improvements to facilities, and operation and maintenance budgets for Duke’s 27 varsity sports.\n\nDuke’s longstanding relationship with Learfield includes its flagship multimedia rights division, licensed merchandise agency CLC, digital ticket and marketing platform provider Paciolan, and digital solutions leader SIDEARM Sports.\n\n“It is imperative that as the needs of our partner institutions evolve that our relationship and the suite of services we deliver follow suit,” said Craig Fink, national director of development for Learfield Amplify. “We are thrilled to expand our relationship with the Iron Dukes and Duke Athletics to further elevate their fundraising efforts through Learfield Amplify Development. Our team is looking forward to continued collaboration that will allow the Blue Devils to maximize relationships with partners, donors, and fans alike.”\n\nWith the addition of Amplify Development, Learfield has hired John Averette as its assistant director of development. Averette has previously served in fundraising and sponsorship roles with the Rams Club at the University of North Carolina and at NC State as part of Learfield’s Wolfpack Sports Properties team."
