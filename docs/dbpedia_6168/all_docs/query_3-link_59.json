The annual college football regular season game will be played on September 7, 2024 in Bank of America Stadium located in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nThis game will be the fourth playing of the two institutions with Tennessee winning the previous two meetings, including a 35-21 victory in 2012. NC State recently played against Maryland in the 2022 Duke’s Mayo Bowl, and Tennessee faced West Virginia in Charlotte to start the season in 2018.\n\n“We are thrilled to host a dynamic regional match up that is within driving distance for these two passionate fan bases. Tennessee and NC State have incredible ties to Charlotte and bringing them together to play in Bank of America Stadium is going to be an awesome experience.” said Danny Morrison, CSF’s executive director. “Games like these don’t happen without an amazing title sponsor like Duke’s Mayo, and the support of the universities and our partners.”\n\n“We appreciate the Charlotte Sports Foundation and NC State on executing a game of this caliber on short notice,” said Tennessee Vice Chancellor/Director of Athletics Danny White. “This is another terrific opportunity for our football program and Vol Nation to showcase our brand in one of college football’s perennial marquee contests.”\n\n“We are excited to participate in the 2024 Duke’s Mayo Classic. This is an incredible opportunity for our football program to face a great SEC opponent in our home state. The Charlotte Sports Foundation does a fantastic job and I’m looking forward to an electric atmosphere at Bank of America Stadium,” said NC State Director of Athletics, Boo Corrigan.\n\n“We are thrilled to join the Charlotte Sports Foundation in bringing Tennessee and NC State to Charlotte for the Duke’s Mayo Classic,” said Joe Tuza, president of Duke’s Mayo. “Much like Duke’s Mayo, both of these universities are iconic southern brands that know how to tailgate!”\n\nThe kickoff time and ticket information will be announced at a later date."
