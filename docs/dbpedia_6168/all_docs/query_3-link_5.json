        "text": "Duke University is one of the top large research universities in the country, and one of the top athletics programs — arguably — globally. The campus in Durham, North Carolina is home to 6,500 undergraduate students and even more graduate students, making for a lively and large campus community. The top majors at Duke are computer science, economics, and biology, and they field 27 varsity athletic teams. The athletics programs, especially basketball, at Duke are a major piece of the student community outside of the classroom, bringing students together around celebration, comradery, and excellence.\n\nAthletes at Duke have access to amazing resources, from academic support to nutritional resources, including dedicated dining options specifically for student-athletes. The Duke “Blue Devil” mascot is an iconic symbol that the community rallies around, and student-athletes can feel the support through a serious passion for the sports community that is palpable on campus.\n\nIt’s no surprise that all of this makes Duke really popular. Admissions is extremely competitive, and the overall acceptance rate is a mere 6.3%. We’ll get into what we mean by ‘overall,’ below, as there are ways in increase the possibility of acceptance outside of athletic exceptionalism.\n\nIn this post, we’ll break down how to approach applying to Duke as a student-athlete and what you need to know to increase your chances of calling yourself a Blue Devil either on a field, or cheering along from the sidelines.\n\nIf you’re an athlete and want to go to a top college, send us an email. We help exceptional students craft acceptance-winning admissions strategies.\n\nWhat is Duke looking for in Student Athletes?\n\nDuke is very competitive athletically and academically. They win championships and mint medals with a frequency that almost seems casual. Simply winning on the court isn’t enough, though. They expect students to excel across the board. They know the vast majority of the athletes on Duke teams will not go on to compete professionally after graduation, so students must have a career path — not just an athletic record.\n\nThe most well-known, and most-winning, sports at Duke are heavily recruited for. However, there are lots of options for taking part in sports at Duke, from varsity teams to club teams, to intramural programs. There are dozens of teams across a wide range of sports and activities that students at Duke have access to, making it an exceptional option whether you want to dribble on the court, spin on the ice, or sail across the water.\n\nRecruited Athletes\n\nIf you are interested in being recruited as an athlete by Duke, it is like applying for a very competitive job, and it can take years of planning and preparation for even the least competitive teams. We advise reaching out to Duke early, like as soon as you know you may want to go there, which may be a year or more before you’ll actually hit ‘submit’ on an application. Coaches at Duke are typically not permitted to reach out to you, so you must proactively put yourself on their radar — and put Sept 1st of your junior year on your calendar, because that’s the date the clock starts ticking with Duke. Before that date, coaches are not supposed to communicate with you. Attending an athletic camp at a university or college you are interested in is one way to circumvent this rule a little, potentially putting you in contact with coaching staff ahead of that Sept. 1 date.\n\nSometimes, managing this process — which has its own protocols and rules separate from the normal college admissions process — would benefit from some extra help. In this case, we recommend hiring an athletic recruiting consultant, who will work with you separate from any help you get on your application and essays, to coordinate these conversations.\n\nIf you are trying to go at it alone, you can find coach contact information by going through the individual sport page on the Duke athletics website. But don’t just send an email casually. This is serious. Being recruited can come with major financial incentives, and so it’s as much a business proposition as an emotional one. You need to be strategic, and to present your strongest self. And being exceptional as an athlete doesn’t’ guarantee your spot. You need to meet or exceed the high academic bar Duke sets for all students.\n\nAs you approach the recruitment process, expect to have to make a commitment early. This can be reassuring, but it also means you need to know what you want from your college athletics experience.\n\nWalk-Ons\n\nIf you aren’t up for the recruitment process because it’s intimidating, you want to keep your options open, or because you’re a strong athlete, but not a standout, walking on could be an option. Being a ‘walk-on’ doesn’t require additional support from an athletics specific consultant, like recruiting might, but you do still need to be communicating with the coaches. And this is still very serious. Let the coaches know who you are, what you do, why you’d be a strong member of the team, and ask for details on how to join the team as a walk-on.\n\nWalking onto a team at Duke also doesn’t require an early commitment, or even applying early, but applying Early Decision (ED) is your best way into Duke — athlete or not. The university recently accepted 16.5% of ED applicants, versus a 5.2% regular decision acceptance rate.\n\nIf you choose to try to walk on, you should know that walking onto a college team is like trying out for varsity at your high school. You don’t have a guaranteed spot, and you need to earn the opportunity to even be on the practice field. Walk-on athletes often have little game-time in their first year, so you have to be ok with really earning every minute. Some teams are harder to get onto than others. Women’s golf at Duke, for example, has won seven NCAA Championships, so the team is a powerhouse with few open spots for walk-ons. Other, less competitive teams have more opportunities for athletes who weren’t recruited.\n\nClub Sports + Intramurals\n\nDuke has 30+ club sports teams that operate much like a varsity team minus the pressure. These teams even have access to funding for annual training and competition trips. There are club versions of popular sports like basketball, lacrosse, field hockey, and volleyball, but also sports you may want to try for the first time like sailing, triathlon, and rugby.\n\nThe Sports Clubs at Duke are inclusive, and do not require try-outs or make cuts. They are often very competitive, and can be a big-time commitment, but the teams are designed to nurture life-long athletes, not to block people out from the sport they love — or even one they are trying for the first time.\n\nYou can also join Intramural Sports, which are less of a time commitment but are a great way of staying active.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about the Duke recruitment experience, we recommend reading this paper, written by Duke students, on Duke athletic recruiting. Featuring stories from recruited athletes at Duke, it provides amazing insight into what is actually at the heart of the process, and could help you understand if it is right for you.\n\nIf you aren’t being recruited, applying Early Decision is your best way into Duke. As you work on your application, don’t emphasize your sport, or sports, in your application to the detriment of the other amazing aspects of yourself. Being good at a game won’t help you get in unless you’re in the recruitment process, but being an exceptional student and outstanding human will — so show them that."
