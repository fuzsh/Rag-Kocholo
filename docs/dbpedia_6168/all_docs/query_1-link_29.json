        "text": "NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Colleges\n\nMen’s basketball recruits looking to compete at the highest collegiate level—and have the physical measurables and athletic skills to back it up—should highly consider NCAA Division 1 basketball colleges during their recruiting process. Student-athletes who compete at D1 basketball schools not only meet highly competitive recruiting guidelines set by these elite schools but are also among the best student-athletes in the nation. Unfortunately, while being a top basketball player on your high school or club team may help you stand out in a crowd, potential recruits should be prepared for the highest level of competition among not only high school athletes, but also current student-athletes competing at junior colleges with basketball programs, as these players are often recruited by four-year D1 basketball schools too.\n\nThere is an extremely high caliber set for student-athletes who land roster spots on D1 basketball teams. Getting to the D1 level—and staying there—requires an extremely high level of dedication, passion for the sport and hard work. However, the payoffs of competing at Division 1 basketball colleges is well worth the effort. Top D1 basketball schools are among the most popular in the nation, and many student-athletes—and their non-athletic peers alike—recognize and root for powerhouse Division 1 basketball programs like University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill and Duke University. Athletes who have the talent, physical measurables, drive and academics will be rewarded with well-funded athletic facilities, experienced coaches to take their game to the next level and even a chance at a partial or fully funded athletic scholarship offer. Likewise, players at top D1 basketball colleges will have a chance to enjoy national recognition and respect from dedicated fans. Learn more about the basketball recruiting rankings process.\n\nHow many colleges are in Division 1 men’s basketball?\n\nStudent-athletes looking to compete at the highest collegiate level have plenty of options. But just how many colleges are in Division 1 men’s basketball? There are currently more than 350 Division 1 basketball colleges in the nation—these 351 NCAA D1 basketball colleges are comprised of the most elite basketball players, and potential recruits should be prepared to work hard on and off the court to land a roster spot at one of these Division 1 basketball programs.\n\nWhen narrowing down your target list, it’s important to consider several factors. First and foremost, student-athletes who have their sights set on attending one of these D1 basketball schools should explore a complete list of D1 basketball colleges, be prepared to meet or exceed competitive recruiting guidelines, and stay up to date on D1 basketball rankings. For a complete list of Division 1 basketball colleges, including their location and corresponding athletic conference, look at our catalog of Division 1 basketball rankings and D1 basketball schools list below. Is there an AAU boys basketball team near me?\n\nMen’s D1 basketball rankings\n\nSeveral organizations offer NCAA Division 1 men’s basketball rankings, including the NCAA, USA Today Sports and the Associated Press Top 25 Poll. View the top D1 basketball schools, according to the NCSA Power Rankings.\n\nWhile the NCSA Power Rankings offer a good overview of top D1 basketball schools, student-athletes who hope to compete at one of the 350+ Division 1 basketball colleges shouldn’t limit their search to only the most elite Division 1 basketball programs. Instead, they should consider several factors when researching D1 basketball teams, including athletic and academic caliber, school size, location, and cost, as well as their own personal preferences."
