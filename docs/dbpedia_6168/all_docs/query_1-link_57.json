        "meta_description": "Hey there! Duke has a strong athletic department with various popular sports for both men and women. Among them, men's basketball is arguably the most well-known and followed due to its history of success, which includes multiple national championships and a long run under the winningest men's college basketball coach of all time (Mike Krzyzewski), and a strong fan base, which especially shows up during rivalry games against UNC. Other popular sports at Duke include men's and women's soccer, lacrosse, and tennis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of competitiveness, securing a spot on a team is quite challenging, especially for the top-tier sports like basketball. Coaches typically scout and recruit high school athletes who display exceptional talent and potential. If you're looking to join a team as a walk-on, you'll still need to demonstrate a high level of skill in your respective sport. It's also important to note that not all sports hold open tryouts, so it's crucial that you research the process for the specific sport you're interested in joining.\r\n\r\nIf you're not at the Division I level but still want to participate in sports, Duke offers club and intramural teams that allow students to compete in various sports at a less intense level than varsity teams. These options are a great way to stay active, meet new people, and have fun while enjoying your favorite sports. \r\n\r\nI hope you find the athletic opportunities you're looking for at Duke! If you end up applying and are looking for tips on how to maximize your chances of acceptance, check out this blog post from CollegeVine, which breaks down how to tackle Duke's school-specific supplemental essays: https://blog.collegevine.com/how-to-write-the-duke-university-essays. After all, Duke is highly selective, so you want to be sure you demonstrate all that you have to offer their campus community, academically and personally as well as athletically, and the essays are often just the thing that distinguishes one talented applicant from another. Best of luck with your applications!",
