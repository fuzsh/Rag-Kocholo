        "text": "This spring I began a Duke Sustainable Athletics Group alongside fellow student-athletes and Duke Athletics staff engaged with driving action. Our first project became the Devils Doing Good Shoe Drive. After seeing so many shoes discarded over the seasons at Duke, I wanted to find a solution to save our shoes from the trash. Thanks to the engaging team of student-athletes and collaborative staff of Duke Athletics, the Shoe Drive became a department-wide initiative and great success! We collected and sorted 591 pairs of shoes total: üëü ‚ôªÔ∏è * 308 shoes were recycled at Nike Cary via the Nike Grind Program, which repurposes end-of-life shoes into various new materials. * 283 shoes were donated at Fleet Feet Durham via the MORE Foundation Group, which distributes shoes to developing countries while funding conservation and agricultural projects in Ghana in the process. With this tested system, our department will be able to run the drive similarly at the end of each semester / school year. It‚Äôs exciting to see the beginning of our long-term vision whereby Duke Athletics never wastes a shoe. Excited to continue collaborating with Duke Athletics to embed environmental action and awareness into our department. Ready to take on the next project, one step (& shoe) at a time‚Ä¶ Huge shout out to all who were a part of this project! Special thanks to key leaders in Bob Weiseman Matthew Hess Michael Westfall Emilie Lijesen Phoebe Brinker Brandon Hersh Ezra Mellinger Alejandro Rodriguez Christina Ferrari Sydney Tomlak Ari Solomon Charlotte van Oirschot Dejanae Davis üíô"
