Through its annual fund, the Duke Club raises unrestricted contributions in support of student-athlete scholarships and the athletic budget. Additionally, the Duke Club aids athletic facility enhancements and other needs through capital campaigns. To learn more about the Duke Club click here.\n\nYou can sign up to be a member at any point throughout the year! We encourage students to sign up at the beginning of each school year to receive a full year of benefits. The membership year runs on the academic calendar (August to May) and you must renew your membership every year.\n\nYour $25 donation goes directly to the Proud & True Fund, which in return supports our student-athletes and the general athletics operating budget. Support of the Proud & True Fund is vital to the continued success of more than 500+ student-athletes and makes a significant impact on each athlete and program.\n\nMembers of the Student Duke Club must renew their membership every year with a $25 donation in order to receive member benefits. This allows students to build priority points by establishing consecutive years of giving as well as expose students to the annual giving culture. Priority points are accumulated each year and can set you up for future benefits following graduation. For more information on priority points click here.\n\nThe Student Duke Club offers the opportunity for students to gain valuable leadership skills by applying to be a board member! Applications open towards the end of the membership year and all are welcome to apply for the positions available.\n\nNo positions available and still want to be involved? Feel free to reach out to the board or email us at dukeclub@jmu.edu with any inquiries."
