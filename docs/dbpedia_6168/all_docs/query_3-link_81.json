        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (theACC.com) – The Atlantic Coast Conference has nominated Virginia’s Natasha Subhash (Women’s Tennis) and Duke’s Jala Wright (Softball) for the 2024 NCAA Woman of the Year Award.\n\nThe NCAA Woman of the Year award established in 1991 honors graduating female student-athletes who have distinguished themselves throughout their collegiate careers in the areas of academic achievement, athletics excellence, service, and leadership.\n\n“The ACC takes great pride in consistently recognizing our student-athletes, and specifically the exceptional women nominated by our member institutions for the prestigious NCAA Woman of the Year Award,” said ACC Commissioner Jim Phillips, Ph.D. “This year, Natasha and Jala were selected by the membership from an outstanding pool of talented women who embody the highest standards of achievement in collegiate athletics. The ACC applauds the incredible academic, athletic and community service accomplishments of Natasha, Jala, and all of this year’s league nominees.”\n\nSubhash graduated from the University of Virginia with a bachelor's degree in commerce, and most recently with a master's degree in accounting this May.\n\nDuring her time at UVA, Subhash achieved numerous academic and athletic honors. She was recognized as a three-time CoSIDA Academic All-America honoree, a five-time ITA Scholar-Athlete, a five-time ACC Academic Honor Roll member, and a three-time recipient of UVA's Scholar-Athlete of the Year Award. She was also awarded the 2023 Walter B. Doggett Accounting Award from the McIntire School of Commerce for her exceptional academic performance in accounting.\n\nSubhash made significant contributions to the UVA women's tennis program. She concluded her career as a four-time ITA All-American and received the 2022 Ralph Sampson Scholarship Award for demonstrating excellence in academics, leadership, and athletics. Subhash also received national recognition, being named the National Freshman of the Year in 2020 and receiving the 2023 Arthur Ashe Jr. Leadership and Sportsmanship Award.\n\nOn the tennis court, she achieved the third-highest number of singles victories (117), the fourth-highest number of doubles wins (111), and the fourth-highest combined singles and doubles wins (228) in the history of the Virginia women's tennis program. Additionally, she won the ITA Atlantic Region Singles Championship twice and the 2023 ITA Atlantic Regional Doubles Championship with her partner, Hibah Shaikh.\n\nOutside of athletics, Subhash was actively involved in the UVA community. She served on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, participated in the Student-Athlete Leadership Academy, and volunteered with programs such as the ACE Program, Madison House, and the Xperience Special Olympics Tennis Clinic. Furthermore, she mentored student-athletes in the McIntire School of Commerce.\n\nDuke’s Wright graduated this past spring with a degree in sociology and a minor in journalism and media studies, all while she made significant contributions to the Blue Devils’ softball program during her time at Duke.\n\nWright's accomplishments included being a 2024 CSC Academic All-American and a four-time NFCA All-America Scholar-Athlete selection. She was a three-time All-ACC Academic Team member and was named to the All-ACC Honor Roll three times.\n\nIn her final season at Duke last year, Wright had an outstanding year in the circle for the Blue Devils, finishing with a 19-3 record and a 1.50 ERA. She also led the Blue Devils' pitching staff in innings pitched, appearances, and strikeouts. Wright's exceptional performance led to her being unanimously voted ACC Pitcher of the Year and earning the ACC Tournament MVP title.\n\nAs a 2024 NFCA, Softball America, and D1Softball All-American, Wright was instrumental in Duke's success, helping the team achieve its second ACC Championship and make its third straight NCAA Super Regional appearance, ultimately advancing to the Women's College World Series for the first time last season.\n\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina, native was a member of the United Black Athletes, Purpose4Living, and a community service liaison for Team Impact. She also worked as a mentor for the Chasing Greatness Mentorship Program and participated in the Rubenstein-Bing Civic Engagement Program (ACE), completing a three-week service opportunity in Costa Rica in 2023.\n\nWright also served as the program director for Project Preseason, an orientation event for incoming first-year student-athletes at Duke. She also completed an internship with Softball America and served as a freelance writer for the publication during her time as a Blue Devil.\n\nSubhash and Wright emerged as the ACC’s 2024 NCAA Woman of the Year candidates following a vote of the league’s member schools.\n\nThe strong list of 16 nominees from league member institutions is included below and is reflective of the 15 member institutions from the 2023-24 academic year.\n\nName, Sport, School\n\nKayla Martello, Lacrosse, Boston College\n\nBrianna Smith, Outdoor Track & Field, Duke\n\nJala Wright, Softball, Duke\n\nMallorie Black, Softball, Georgia Tech\n\nCarol Lee, Tennis, Georgia Tech\n\nAnna DeBeer, Volleyball, Louisville\n\nSara Byrne, Golf, Miami\n\nAlexa Noel, Tennis, Miami\n\nDorrit Eisenbeis, Field Hockey, North Carolina\n\nKelsey Chmiel, Cross Country, NC State\n\nJadin O’Brien, Track & Field, Notre Dame\n\nChiamaka Nwokolo, Volleyball, Pitt\n\nEefke van den Nieuwenhof, Field Hockey, Syracuse\n\nNatasha Subhash, Tennis, Virginia\n\nAlex Walsh, Swimming & Diving, Virginia\n\nRachel Kuehn, Golf, Wake Forest\n\nTo learn more about the award program and previous winners, visit ncaa.org/woty."
