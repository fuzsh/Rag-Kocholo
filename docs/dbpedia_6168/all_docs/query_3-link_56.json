That news should break in the coming days.\n\nSTREAM: fuboTV (start your free trial)\n\nBut on Monday evening, the Duke football account announced on social media that the breathtaking Duke University Chapel at the center of West Campus is the chosen centerpiece for the set where the famous College GameDay crew (Rece Davis, Desmond Howard, Kirk Herbstreit, Pat McAfee, and Lee Corso) will broadcast from:\n\nSome folks hoped ESPN wouldn't make the day overly Duke basketball-centric. Had the decision-makers selected Cameron Indoor Stadium and Krzyzewskiville as the backdrop, not to mention still potentially having a Duke basketball legend as the guest picker, it might've been seen as disrespect by the well-deserving Duke football team.\n\nRELATED: Gridiron Blue Devils Chip in With Major Hoops Recruiting Effort\n\nAt the same time, though, despite its picturesque charm, Wallace Wade Stadium (set for its first matchup between two ranked teams since the 1994 Blue Devils, then No. 23, defeated No. 13 Virginia in Durham) isn't likely to impress regular viewers compared to the more common locations for the show.\n\nIn other words, the Duke Chapel — the most recognizable symbol of the private school's overall prestige — seems like an ideal choice, even though it's several hundred yards from where the game will take place."
