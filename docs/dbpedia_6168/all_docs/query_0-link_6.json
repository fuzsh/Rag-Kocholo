        "meta_description": "Duke University offers a wide array of sports teams and clubs, known for their competitiveness and strong sports culture. The school is a member of the NCAA Division I and participates in the competitive Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Duke's varsity teams include men's and women's basketball, soccer, lacrosse, tennis, cross-country, track and field, rowing, swimming and diving, golf, and more. The men's basketball team, in particular, is well-known for its success and has a strong following on campus.\r\n\r\nIn addition to varsity sports, Duke offers club sports, which provides students an opportunity to engage in intercollegiate competition without the same level of commitment required for a varsity team. Some popular club sports at Duke include rugby, ultimate frisbee, water polo, and equestrian. There are around 37 club sports in total, so there's likely to be something for everyone.\r\n\r\nDuke's intramural sports program is another opportunity for students looking to participate in sports at a less competitive, more recreational level. Intramural sports include basketball, flag football, soccer, volleyball, and several others. These competitions allow students to form teams with their friends or join an existing team through a \"free agency\" process.\r\n\r\nOverall, sports are an integral part of campus life at Duke, and there is a wide range of options for all levels of athletic interest and experience.",
