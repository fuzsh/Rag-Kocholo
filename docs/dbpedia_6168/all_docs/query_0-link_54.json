        "text": "WASHINGTON - GW men's basketball is one of just 10 NCAA Division I programs with multiple representatives at the ongoing Paris Olympics. Alums Yuta Watanabe (Japan) and Arnaldo Toro (Puerto Rico) have each donned their nation's colors for the chance at an Olympic medal.\n\nOf the 10 schools with multiple men's basketball participants, GW joins Gonzaga (4) and Saint Mary's (3) as the only non-Power 4 institutions on the list. Kentucky leads the way with seven men's Olympic participants, followed by Iowa State (5), Duke (3), LSU (2), Michigan (2), Nebraska (2) and Stanford (2).\n\nWatanabe poured in 16 points in 34 minutes of action in Japan's pool play opener against Germany over the weekend, making 6-of-13 shots, including 4-of-9 from beyond the arc. Japan is set to take on the host country, France, at 11:15 a.m. ET on Tuesday followed by its final pool play match on Friday, August 2 vs. Brazil at 5 a.m. ET.\n\nThis marks the second straight Olympic appearance for Watanabe, who previously appeared in the 2020 games in his home country. He averaged 17.7 ppg and 8.0 rpg in Japan's three group matches four years ago.\n\nToro, who played for four years in the Buff & Blue, debuted with Puerto Rico in the country's opener vs. South Sudan on Sunday. He was credited with two rebounds and a steal in 10 minutes of action off the bench. Puerto Rico is set to take on Serbia on Wednesday at 11:15 a.m. ET before battling the United States on Saturday, August 3, also at 11:15 a.m. ET."
