        "text": "Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), American collegiate athletic organization formed in 1953 as an offshoot of the Southern Conference. Member schools are Boston College (joined 2005), Clemson University, Duke University, Florida State University (joined 1990), the Georgia Institute of Technology (joined 1979), the University of Louisville (joined 2014), the University of Miami (joined 2004), the University of North Carolina, North Carolina State University, the University of Pittsburgh (joined 2013), Syracuse University (joined 2013), the University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (joined 2004), and Wake Forest University. The University of Notre Dame (joined 2013) is a member in all sports other than gridiron football.\n\nThe Southern Conference had been organized in 1921 to promote and govern intercollegiate athletics. By 1953 some of the member schools felt the conference had grown too large and unwieldy for competitive athletic scheduling. At the conferenceâ€™s spring meeting, seven schools withdrew and formed the ACC. Virginia, which had not been a member of the Southern Conference, eventually joined the new organization, while the University of South Carolina, an original member, withdrew in 1971."
