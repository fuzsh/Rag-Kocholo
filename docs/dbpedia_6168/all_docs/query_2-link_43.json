The meet will begin at 10 a.m. on Thursday with the men's and women's hammer throw, with the bulk of the track and field events to start on Friday at 10 a.m. and continuing through Saturday afternoon.\n\nIn addition, the Niners will take a small group of distance runners to Azusa Pacific University for the Bryan Clay Invitational, which will take place from Thursday to Saturday.\n\n\"We expect some big things this weekend at Duke and Asuza Pacific,\" said Charlotte head coach Bob Olesen. \"As we get closer to the postseason, we are identifying events where we need to establish ourselves both in the AAC rankings and for NCAA qualifying, and both of these meets will provide ample opportunity to achieve this.\"\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nCharlotte had a highly productive weekend at the VertKlassee Meeting at High Point. Riley Felts a new school, facility, and meet record in the pole vault, while the Niners had nine event winners and 10 all-time top-10 performances. In the women's 400m, Ta-Halia Fairman's time of 53.52 won the event and put her fourth in the all-time records. In the men's 3000m steeplechase, Braden Lange finished first with a PR of 8:55.82.\n\nIn addition, both Patience Marshall and Kayla Davis-Edwards had top-10 performances in the discus throw.\n\nFOLLOW THE ACTION\n\nThe meet will be streamed on Friday and Saturday on ESPN+.
