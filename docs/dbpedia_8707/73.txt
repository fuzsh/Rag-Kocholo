Michael Gray is a hugely respected and established British DJ and music producer, best known for his hits âThe Weekendâ & âBorderlineâ He is also one half of the dance music production and remixing duo 'Full Intention' who have been at the forefront of Dance music since the early 90s. London-based Michael is one of the most in-demand Artists on the global dance music scene today. Having relaunched his solo career as Michael Gray in 2018 to pursue his original love of Disco, Michael has already become the world #2 Soul/Funk/Disco Artist on Traxsource in 2019 - an incredible achievement and a worthy accolade for Michael's world-class production skills. Throw into the mix awesome DJ sets at the best events in the UK, and a host of chart topping tracks with Jon Pearn as Full Intention, and you start to see the full picture of one of the UK's most talented Artists. He has DJâd all over the world from MOS in London to Hi (for Glitterbox) & Pacha in Ibiza and as far and wide as Poland, Germany, The Philippines, Australia, Russia, Brazil, Georgia, Spain and The Netherlands. 2019 was an incredible year for Michael by any standards - along with the aforementioned #2 ranked Traxsource Soul/Funk/Disco Artist, Michael was ranked #6 in Traxsource's Overall Best Artists, and his remix of Sylvesterâs 'You make me feel' (Sultra Records) was Traxsource's second best-selling track of 2019. Between his own productions and those of Full Intention, Michael had an amazing 6 tracks in the Top 200. #2 Sylvester - You make me feel (Michael Gray) #66 Debbie Jacobs - Don't You Want My Love (Full Intention) #72 Funkatomic - It's a House Thing (Full Intention) #100 Rockers Revenge - What About The People?
