        "text": "masterlist\n\nPart 1 <- please read part 1 otherwise this won’t make sense\n\nsummary: your arranged marriage to michael gray takes a turn\n\nwords: 2.6k\n\na/n: highly requested part 2! hope you enjoy it as much as part 1. there are a few time jumps!\n\ntags: @celticmelody @screemqueen @leenasrecs @kpopgirlbtssvt\n\n‘How was the sex?’ Michael was greeted with Arthur’s bold question as soon as he set foot into the betting shop.\n\n‘None of your concern.’ Michael walked past him straight into his office that had collected dust for the past two weeks. Marriage had already been proven to be stressful and on top of all that Michael was still the head accountant for Shelby Company Limited.\n\n‘My little baby cousin just got married, of course I’m going to ask.’\n\nMichael hadn’t noticed Arthur coming to his office, or John that was now standing next to him. They were eyeing Michael down like he was some kind of whore from down the road. Why are they so interested in this, Michael thought to himself as he flicked through last month’s financial records.\n\n‘What?’ Michael said irritated, his face falling to an expression of anticipation and annoyance when he realised that they were both still standing there.\n\nMichael opened one of the many drawers of his desk and lit up a cigarette before throwing the lighter on the table. ‘What the fuck do you want?’\n\n‘How was the wedding night?’ John smirked whilst elbowing Arthur in a playful way. They both chuckled before sitting down in the seats in front of the table where Michael thought he could do the last business of today in peace.\n\n‘Can you both just fuck off?’\n\nJohn sat up in his seat and smirked the same way he did before. ‘But we want to know.’ Arthur nodded in agreement.\n\nMichael stared at them with a warning glare.\n\n‘I mean y-‘\n\n‘We didn’t have sex, John, fuck off!’ Michael snapped. He leaned back in his chair and took a deep breath.\n\n‘Why?’ Arthur asked a minute later.\n\nMichael returned to his previous state and dragged a smoke from his cigarette. ‘Because the girl was terrified.’\n\n‘Of what?’ John asked.\n\n‘Of me.’ Michael rolled his eyes thinking it was more than obvious but his cousins proved to be dim-witted.\n\n‘Wedding night literally means sex, and afraid of you…? You aren’t exactly scary, Michael.’ Arthur combed through his beard like it was hard to understand the concept of different ways to spend the wedding night.\n\n‘First of all no it doesn’t,’ Michael scoffed, still being annoyed that he had to talk about it. ‘And she met me two months ago after her father traded her for a warehouse if you’ve forgotten. For all she could’ve known I could’ve been an abuser, or an old bloke.’\n\nJohn and Arthurd nodded, making sense of the situation.\n\n‘Can you both fuck off now?’ Michael raised his eyebrows. ‘I’ve got work to do.’ He pointed to a stack of papers that still needed his attention by the end of his shift.\n\n‘Yeah, yep, yeah.’ They both muttered before walking out of Michael’s office like two children that have just been scolded.\n\nMichaels head fell into his hands. Not having slept well and having to deal with his cousins was proving to be exhausting. Nonetheless he started to work through the papers.\n\n･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･\n\nYou were walking through the muddied street of Watery Lane trying to get to the betting shop to talk to Michael.\n\nYou still hadn’t got used to the fact that you were married, or even to a gang member, because anywhere you would go people would always treat you like you were someone special when in all honesty —you were not. It has been two months since your wedding night. Since Michael had told you that he wasn’t going to have sex with you until you wanted to. Though it shouldn’t have, it stirred up a feeling you couldn’t describe. It made you hate Michael a little less than you did before. He showed you that he cared about you even if he still didn’t know you. You were glad that you married Michael Gray. You could’ve been married off to some abusive man that would’ve expected exactly what you felt uncomfortable with and if you would’ve refused he would beat you and then rape you. After all; men are men. The last two months Michael has been nothing but kind and understanding to you; Making you your tea in the morning that he picked up in the first week or telling you at all times where he was going so you wouldn’t be alarmed. Your house which he let you decide on was lovely, and a 20min drive away from Small Heath, so you did have to take the second Bentley down there.\n\nYou arrived at the betting shop with your heels being covered in stuff you did not want to know about. Michael told you that he’d be at his office all day and you desperately needed to talk to him. Your mother paid you a call just before you left for Small Heath, saying she’s excited to see you on the weekend but you haven’t called your mother.\n\nYou knocked on the door and waited to be let in.\n\n‘We’re closed!’ You heard Arthur yell from the inside.\n\nYou menatlly rolled your eyes. They couldn’t even check who was at the door? ‘It’s Y/n, idiots.’ You yelled back as you started to bounce up and down out of habit.\n\nShortly after, the door opened to reveal Arthur. ‘If it isn’t the newly wed wife.’ He said enthusiastically.\n\nYou knitted your eyebrows and stared at him. Where did you marry into again?\n\n‘Don’t worry,’ he leans on the door frame. ‘The Shelbys understand jokes.’\n\n‘I really don’t care.’ You walked past him and entered the building. The same moment you stepped in you saw Michael coming out of the office, his eyes landing on you.\n\n‘Oh Michael,’ You heard Arthur go on, ‘we received payment from the Eden Club today.’\n\n‘Keep the business to yourself right now,’ Michael replied as you were walking towards him. ‘She’s not going to be involved.’\n\nYou stopped in your tracks right in the middle of Michael and Arthur.\n\n‘Why not?’ Both you and Arthur said just seconds apart.\n\nMichael stuffed his hands into his trouser and cleared his throat. He often did that when stuff became serious.\n\n‘Because it’s dangerous.’ He gave a slight attitude.\n\n‘I thought you believed in equal rights?’ You reproached.\n\n‘I do,’ Michael said without much emotion. ‘But I don’t believe in equal deaths around here.’ He looked at both you and Arthur. John was just enjoying the scene.\n\n‘I want to die.’ You suddenly said. The room was silent.\n\n‘No you don’t.’ Michael’s face had fallen to an expression of defeat.\n\n‘You don’t know that.’\n\nMichael didn’t answer. Instead he looked at you with an expression that clearly told you to shut up, so you did. You weren’t here to bicker about death anyway. You walked into Michael’s office and waited for him to close the door.\n\n‘My mother called.’ You sat down on the chair. Michael had walked to his desk and poured himself a glass of whisky. He looked at you waiting for the rest of the story.\n\n‘She said she’s excited to see us?’ You cocked your head to the side. ‘I haven’t talked to her since the wedding so I did not plan this.’\n\n‘Because I did.’ He shot back the amber alcohol.\n\n‘I won’t go and see them.’\n\n‘We have to.’\n\n‘They literally traded me for exactly four warehouses, which by the way went to your cousin.’ You snapped back. Your mother and father were the last people on planet earth you wanted to see right now.\n\n‘It’s been two months.’ He tried to reason with you.\n\n‘Yeah, since they traded me.’ You sat back in your chair. ‘I’m sorry Michael but you are a man not a woman. You will never understand what it feels like to be nothing in the eyes of society.’\n\n‘I know that I will never understand. But you should go see your family. Imagine something happens to them,’ He looked into your eyes, trying to find that one part that would convince you. ‘You’ll regret it.’\n\nAt the end Michael did reason with you. You told him that you’d go to your parent’s house in two weeks.\n\n･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･\n\n‘So how’s the marriage?’ Your father asked Michael, completely disregarding you. All you could do was roll your eyes. Meanwhile your mother was bringing tea and biscuits to the table. ‘I hope my daughter is treating you well.’\n\nMichael nodded awkwardly.\n\n‘Michael has been very kind to me.’ You leaned forward and grabbed your cup of tea.\n\n‘I knew you’d thank me sooner or later.’ Your mother smiled at you, gently grabbing your hand as if you were in some kind of therapy session.\n\n‘What have you been up to in the last months?’ Your father grabbed a cigar from his cigar box and started to cut it.\n\n‘Nothing really, I help out in the betting shop from time to time but that’s it.’ You lied for the fun of it because you knew exactly how your parents would react.\n\nThe expressions on your father’s and mother’s face were priceless.\n\n‘Why is my daughter working? Mr. Shelby assured us that she wouldn’t have to work.’ Your father queried.\n\n‘That’s no place for a woman.’ Your parents agreed.\n\nLuckily Michael was a fast learner and caught on fast. ‘Your daughter works there for the sole reason she wants to.’\n\n‘She shouldn’t.’ Your mother almost gasped. The reaction she had was like you were made to clean toilets all day or some other horrendous job, yet it was far from that.\n\n‘Jesus fucking Christ.’ You let yourself fall into the couch. You were practically forced to go meet your parents and if you could go back in time you wouldn’t have come at all despite what Michael said.\n\n‘Don’t cuss in front of your husband!’ Your mother said, mortified that her daughter was not lady-like. ‘I apologise on my daughter’s behalf.’\n\nMichael turned his head to you but all you could do was roll your eyes and laugh. This meeting or whatever you wanted to call it had to be a joke.\n\n‘She’s my wife not my property or pet. She can say and do whatever she wants.’\n\n‘But it’s not lady-like.’\n\n‘Who gives a shit.’ He laughed out as your parents were taken aback by his choice of words. All they did was cough and move around in their chairs in response. Michael realised why you disliked your parents so much. It was written across his face and you tried to give him a look of, told you we shouldn’t have come.\n\nWhen you returned home from the tea party held in hell, you said your first words since you left your parent’s house.\n\n‘Thank you.’ You said, acknowledging the fact that a man who barely knew you had stood up for you in front of your parents.\n\nMichael smiled and walked into your living room. ‘You’re my wife, that’s what I should do.’\n\nYou followed him into the living room and saw that he was unbuttoning his suit vest.\n\n‘I mean…yeah, but it’s only been two months,’\n\n‘Two months can be a long time.’ He said.\n\n‘Thank you,’ you started. ‘Thank you for treating me well.’\n\n‘Again, you are my wife.’ He chuckled.\n\n‘But not every husband treats their wife this well. I’m glad I married you and not someone else even if this marriage was forced and not out of love.’ You confessed.\n\nMichael slowly stepped towards, one hand in his pockets whilst the other was loosely hanging by his side.\n\nYou really wanted to kiss him. You really did.\n\nHeat arose from your stomach to your chest. Michael’s lips were getting closer and your heart skipped a beat. Did he want to kiss you too? His dark blue eyes sparked with sin as his eyes didn’t leave your gaze. Your heart pounded in your chest as your knees got weaker. The empty void that filled the space between your bodies was filled with his presence as he stepped even closer. Your whole body tingled, the feel of his frame leaning on yours, as his arms wrapped around you felt nearly forbidden. His lips brushed against yours, softly, delicately, like you were a porcelain figure, one crack away from falling to pieces and being broken forever. You could only focus on how soft he felt against your mouth, how addictively he invaded all your senses. He kissed you long enough that he could inhale your breath, feel the warmth of your skin, and the taste of your lipstick that would linger far after you had gone. His lips were soft like butter and his tongue as wet as the beach you visited last year. Michael gently grabbed your chin, slowly pulling back from the kiss, deep down not wanting to break apart from you. But you pulled him right back in, every kiss growing hungrier and hungrier as the clothes from your bodies disappeared onto the floor.\n\n･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･\n\n‘Michael,’ you gently opened the door to his office. ‘Can we talk?’\n\nMichael looked up from his desk and nodded, gesturing￼ you to the seat in front of him.\n\n‘I’m going to make this quick and bold, okay?’ You asked but it sounded more like a statement. You put your bag to the side and quickly slipped out of your coat and hung it over the spare chair.\n\n‘I’m pregnant.’\n\nMichael sat frozen. There was no telling what he thought of the situation.\n\n‘Well,’ you nervously moved around in your chair. ‘Say something…?’\n\nMichael’s hands covered his mouth that was wide openen, just like his eyes. ‘Are you serious?’\n\nYou nodded.\n\nWithout wasting another second, Michael pushed back his chair and hugged you so tight you could barely move. Once he let go of his tight grip and gave you room to breathe you tilted your head and smiled at him with tears in your eyes. You never thought that becoming pregnant was something you wanted.\n\nThen he kissed you like that day. Invading all your senses with his soft lips. Michael ran into the betting shop and announced the news, well shouted it into the room. Everyone was happy for the two of you and you could tell by everyone’s look on their face that your child would grow up in a loving home.\n\n･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ.･\n\n‘One last push, Mrs. Gray!’ The midwife said encouragingly.\n\nYou pulled all strength together and pushed like there was no tomorrow. Seconds later the cries of a newborn filled the room.\n\n‘It’s a girl.’ You heard her say before she was placed into your arms.\n\n‘You did so well.’ Michael whispered in your ear and kissed your temple as he combed your hair out of the way. ‘So, so well.’\n\n‘Michael,’ your voice heavy.\n\n‘Yes?’\n\n‘Promise me we will never trade our daughter or force our daughter to do anything she does not want.’ You looked up at him. ‘She will get to decide her future and marriage , starting a new tradition for the Gray women to come.’\n\nMichael could only nod in agreement. ‘Yes,’ he kissed your temple again. ‘Our daughter will have that. I promise you.’\n\n‘What is her name?’ One of the midwives asks as soon as she comes back in the room to check the baby’s health."
