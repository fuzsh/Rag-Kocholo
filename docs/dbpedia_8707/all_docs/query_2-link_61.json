        "text": "Michael Gray, age 70, of Greenwich, passed away early Saturday morning, April 6, 2024, at his home.\n\nHe was born April 6, 1954, in Crestline, Ohio, to the late Mary Lou (Emmer) and Vernon Gray. Mike was employed as a truck driver for many years. Affectionately known as “Grizz”, he once wrestled a grizzly bear and lost—but lived to tell about it. He loved being around family and every one of them were important to him. In his free time, he enjoyed hunting, fishing, and riding motorcycles.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Lila Axford Gray; four children, Michael (Tiffany) Gray, Jodi (Cierra) Gray, Mary (Teddy) Hiles and Jack (Mandy) Gray; sixteen grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by a sister, Helena Souslin.\n\nThere will be no services or visitation at this time. Advantage Funeral and Cremation Services by Wappner is honored to serve the family.\n\nWords of condolence may be expressed at www.wappner.com\n\nFuneral Home: Advantage Funeral and Cremation Services by Wappner"
