He is also half of the dance music production and remixing duo Full Intention.[1][2]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael Gray created a megamix entitled \"The Brits 1990 (Dance Medley)\" for that year's awards ceremony which peaked at #2 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2002, he released the single \"So Fly\" for Defected Records under the name M, which peaked at number 96 on the UK charts.[3][4] In 2004, he began issuing records under his own name, the first being \"The Weekend\", a worldwide hit in late that year. It peaked at #7 on the UK Singles Chart[5] when licensed through UMTV on Eye Industries, and also notched up over 20,000 plays on the radio. In the United States, \"The Weekend\" was a top 10 hit on Billboard's Hot Dance Airplay chart in 2005, where it was released on Ultra Records. It featured in a Honda commercial and also in an Ugly Betty episode, \"Sofia's Choice\", in 2007.\n\nThe follow-up to \"The Weekend\" was \"Borderline\" featuring vocals from Shelly Poole, formerly of Alisha's Attic, released on 24 July 2006. The track peaked at #3 on the ARIA Club Chart and at #12 on the UK Singles Chart. In 2007, an album, Analog Is On, was released briefly only in Japan. A third single, \"Somewhere Beyond\", peaked at #5 on the Australian ARIA Club Chart.\n\nGray's 2000s productions include: Full Intention's \"I Believe in You\" (2005), Miami Ice's \"Better Than Perfect\" (2005), \"Whatcha Gonna Do\" as Hi Fashion featuring Maria Lawson (2005), and \"Ready for This\" as Robot Man featuring Nanchang Nancy (2008).
