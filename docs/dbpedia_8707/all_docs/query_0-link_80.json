        "text": "Brendan Kennedy\n\nIlkley\n\nIt does what it says on the tin. A good doctor by day, and an even better DJ by night. This Yorkshire born and bred deck-spinner has a passion for house music, travelling and a desire to make the world a happier place â three things which have heavily influenced his lifelong music infatuation. Through his music, The Good Doctor will take you on journeys which reflect his eclectic travelling experiences and desire for discovery. Having touched down in every continent and witnessed the joy that music brings to each and every culture, you will be sure to find an array of genres amalgamated into his sensational sets. Without a doubt, his most memorable set was at 2019âs Glastonbury Festival, but his most cherished and impactful sets were during 2020âs first national lockdown during which he raised over Â£5k for local mental health charities dear to his heart. A resident at The Works Experience and The Wendy House, come and enjoy the journeys and experiences you are taken on; if youâre a lover of all genres, youâre a lover of The Good Doctor, he will see you nowâ¦â¦..\n\nThe Good Doctorâs tracks\n\nLive At The Rendezvous Hotel - Modality AWC Christmas Party - 2nd December 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-12-22T00:10:51Z\n\nLive On NoWay FM - 6th November 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-11-06T18:17:17Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM - 23rd October 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-10-23T17:07:05Z\n\nLive On NoWay FM - 9th October 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-10-09T17:50:06Z\n\nLive On NoWay FM - 14th August 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-08-14T17:10:28Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM - 7th August 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-08-07T17:09:44Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM - 24th July 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-07-24T17:07:19Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM -17th Juy 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-07-17T17:09:57Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM - 10th July 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-07-10T17:06:22Z\n\nLive On NoWayFM - 19th June 2022 by The Good Doctor\n\npublished on 2022-06-19T17:09:04Z"
