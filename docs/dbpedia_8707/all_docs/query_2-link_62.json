        "text": "Family Owned * Transparent Pricing * Quality Service\n\nOvery thirty years ago, Terry Robertson began his career in the funeral industry and \"cut his teeth\" as a funeral director at Harry and Bryant Company, Charlotte's most distinguished Funeral Home at the time.\n\nIn 2007, he founded Robertson Funeral & Cremation Service, a family - owned funeral establishment in Charlotte, offering a personalized, forward thinking service model which addressed changing customer demands and trends. Since that time, the funeral industry landscape in Charlotte has changed dramatically with the purchase of family-owned firms by corporations and sadly, the demolition of historic funeral homes, including Harry and Bryant, following these transitions. During this time, other funeral service professionals have discovered this “New Way to do an Old Business.”\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Robertson founded Kings Mountain Preserve (www.kingsmountainpreserve.com), Charlotte area’s first conservation green cemetery offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional burials.\n\nIn 2023, Terry founded Charlotte Aquamation (www.charlotteaquamation.com), Charlotte’s first aquamation service offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional cremations.\n\n-A word from our owner -\n\nI have had the privilege of serving families for over 30 years. During this time, with all the change in the industry, some things have remained unchanged. Families still like dealing with a family owned firm and want quality service with fair, transparent pricing .\n\nWhen I founded this company, I built it on 4 core values - Compassion, Respect, Dignity and Fairness. Today, not only do these core values embrace our logo, but they embrace every family we serve.\n\nIn 2000, I was given a 30% chance to live 5 years following my diagnosis of synovial sarcoma of the neck while at M.D. Anderson Cancer Institute. The Chief of Head and Neck Surgery stated \"It was most probably due to my exposure to formaldehyde.\" This experience led me to create environmentally sustainable options for all families.\n\nToday, our firm has distinguised itself as the industry leader in environmentally sustainable funeral options. Whether it is a traditional funeral, cremation, aquamation, or green burial, our firm stands alone in its ability to provide these options to residents of the Carolinas.\n\nThank you for your trust and for making us the top rated funeral service provider in Charlotte.\n\nIn service,\n\nTerrence “Terry” H. Robertson - Owner\n\nTHE PRESERVE"
