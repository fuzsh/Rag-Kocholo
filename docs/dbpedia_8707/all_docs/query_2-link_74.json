        "text": "Michael Gray Baughan writes weird fiction and manages a wild old property where no roads go and no one above ground resides full time. Born and bled on the outskirts of Philadelphia, he indulged an early obsession with Poe by studying English Lit and Creative Writing at the University of Virginia, where he was awarded the Wagenheim Prize for best work of short fiction. He has written six books of biography and literary criticism on an assortment of legendary writers, including Stephen King, E. E. Cummings, Rudyard Kipling, and Charles Bukowski. Michael's debut collection of stories, The Ana Log & Other Anomalies, is due from Independent Legions in late 2022. His novel about the world's oldest cult is quietly seeking a publisher."
