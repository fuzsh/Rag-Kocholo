        "meta_description": "Good Love (Produced by Michael Gray) by Kelli Sae, released 26 February 2021\n\n1. Good Love (Michael Gray Radio Edit)\n2. Good Love (Michael Gray Extended Mix)\n3. Good Love (Michael Gray Extended Instrumental Mix)\n\nOn 26th February 2021, hugely talented New York singer-songwriter Kelli Sae takes her bow for Reel People Music with stunning new single Good Love. Produced by Michael Gray, \r\n\r\nGood Love is what soulful, funky dreams are made of. Sae highlights the shaky attentions of a partner and reminds them what they&#39;re missing, her confident, sassy delivery riding an addictive, upbeat backing that blends sweet guitar licks, soaring strings and punchy horns. It&#39;s an impressively sleek welcome to the Reel People fold. \r\n\r\nGood Love also, quite deliciously, pre-empts the arrival of a string of singles in 2021 - with production by Gray, it is certain to showcase much more of Sae&#39;s insane songcraft and delivery. \r\n\r\nKelli Sae’s career-to-date says it all. An internationally acclaimed artist, she has previously shone as lead vocalist for renowned jazz-funk collectives Incognito, Count Basic and Defunkt, and worked with Tina Turner, Chaka Khan, Patti LaBelle, Ashford &amp; Simpson and Me’shell Ndegéocello among others. Born of Puerto Rican, African and French descent, Sae has soulful eclecticism in her blood. The exciting mix of sounds, cultures and influences across her three, independently released solo albums is testament to this, as well as her respected forays into composing, playwrighting and stage performance.",
