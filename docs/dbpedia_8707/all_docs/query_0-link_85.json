Most of these cardiac defects occur in low risk pregnancies and it is the role of the antenatal screening programmes fetal anomaly screening pathway programme (FASP) to try to identify those pregnancies affected before birth.\n\nMany congenital heart conditions (CHD) can be identified before birth with an ultrasound scan (fetal echocardiogram) although some conditions remain difficult to detect.\n\nEarly antenatal detection of congenital heart defects offer these woman the opportunity for accurate diagnosis and counselling. Appropriate management and planning of these pregnancies can therefore offer better outcomes for these babies and their families.\n\nFor more information on fetal cardiology, please visit the South West Fetal Medicine Network website.\n\nWhat is fetal echocardiography?\n\nFetal echocardiography is a test using sound waves (ultrasound) which allows the sonographer or doctor to better see the structures of your unborn babies' heart.\n\nNot all pregnant woman need a fetal echocardiogram, for most woman the basic fetal anomaly screening programme (FASP) Physical examination which is performed between 18-20+6 weeks will show the normal development of your babies heart. Sometimes this routine pregnancy ultrasound scan will detect a fetal heart abnormality and you would be recommended to have a fetal echocardiogram.\n\nYou may also need the test if:\n\nSome pregnant women are at a slightly increased risk of giving birth to a baby with congenital heart disease (CHD). They should be considered for referral for a specialised fetal echocardiogram. Indications may include some of the following:\n\nA first-degree relative of the fetus with CHD.\n\nAn abnormal fetal heart rhythm\n\nA Nuchal translucency of >3.5mm\n\nAn abnormality of another major organ system\n\nMaternal diabetes mellitus (insulin-dependent)\n\nExposure to some drugs in early pregnancy, for example, some anti-epileptic drugs.\n\nAbnormal fetal karyotype\n\nMonochorionic twins\n\nMaternal Anti Ro/La antibodies\n\nLocation\n\nClinics are held in the fetal medicine Unit - Level E, St Michael's hospital in Bristol.\n\nAbout your appointment\n\nYou will be contacted by the fetal cardiology administrators with a date and time for your appointment. Please bring your maternity notes with you.\n\nWhen you arrive, please check in to the main ultrasound department on Level E, St Michaels' hospital and you will be asked to take a seat in the waiting room until you are called through to the scan room.\n\nWhat will happen during my appointment?\n\nThis scan is similar to the routine anomaly ultrasound scan you have for your baby, except that it will concentrate on examining your baby's heart and looking at it in greater detail.\n\nWe do not assess any other features of the baby's anatomy and therefore we are unable to comments on previous scans you may have had, this includes the sex of the baby.\n\nHow long will my appointment take?\n\nAs a guide, the scan may take around 30 minutes however the scan time may vary depending upon your baby's position and the heart problem detected and it may take up to 45 minutes to complete. It is similar to any other type of ultrasound scan and does not cause harm to your baby.\n\nEach appointment is tailored according to individual needs. Sometimes this may cause delays to your appointment time. We appreciate that this can be a stressful time for you and we apologies for this in advance.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a full bladder for this scan.\n\nWho will be present during my scan?\n\nThe fetal cardiology team consists of a consultant fetal cardiologist, a fetal cardiac sonographer and a cardiac nurse specialist who are all usually present during your consultation.\n\nThe scan is usually performed by the fetal cardiac sonographer or fetal cardiologist, however at times it may be performed by one of the trainees, under consultant supervision.\n\nAs a major teaching hospital, it is possible other healthcare professionals may be present. No more than 4 people are usually present in the room, unless in special circumstances when you would be asked for your consent.\n\nPlease let us know if you would rather not have extra people present.\n\nHow will I get the results of the scan?\n\nIf your baby is found to have heart condition, the fetal cardiologist will explain to you:\n\nThe exact nature of the heart condition found.\n\nThe likely treatment that may be needed after birth.\n\nThe overall prognosis and long term outlook.\n\nThe options available to you and the implications for your pregnancy.\n\nYou will have time to ask questions to clarify anything that you may not have understood during the discussion. Do not worry if you think of more questions after the appointment - you will be given contact details for the cardiac nurse specialist who will provide support to you.\n\nUltrasound recording\n\nThe scan of your baby's heart will be recorded and images stored securely on the hospital system. These images remain confidential at all times, but may be used to discuss with other specialist involved in your care as well as for audit and teaching purposes.\n\nAs far as possible personal details are restricted to maintain privacy and all images are kept on the hospital database. During your visit, you will be asked for your consent for the images being used for teaching purposes. All images used for these purposes will be anonymised.\n\nPlease note we will not be able to provide recordings for your own personal use.\n\nWe accept referral from obstetricians, midwives and GP's\n\nTo refer to fetal cardiology please download the fetal cardiology referral form,\n\nThe new referral form and referral criteria along with further information about our fetal cardiac service is also available on our website: /fetalcardiology\n\nThe future\n\nThis department contributes information to The National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS) & National Institute Cardiac Outcome Research (NICOR). The benefits of this include:\n\nDetection of birth abnormalities in the same area.\n\nMonitor the scanning and detection services you receive during pregnancy.\n\nEvaluate the necessary facilities provided in the hospitals and community services.\n\nContribute to research questions about specific abnormalities such as cardiac defects.\n\nFinally…\n\nWe hope that your visit to the fetal cardiology department will be helpful and we will endeavor to answer all your questions.
