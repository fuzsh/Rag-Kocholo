        "text": "Richard Lee Gray, 66, of Liberty, MO, known by everyone as Richie, passed away peacefully on October 18, 2019, from complications arising from Alzheimer's Disease. His family was, and had been, by his side on the days leading up to his passing. He was preceded in death by his parents, Ann Elizabeth and George Leslie Gray.\n\nRichie was born in Kansas City, MO, November 3, 1952, the youngest of three boys. In 1958, the family moved to Liberty, MO, where Richie graduated from Liberty High School in 1971 and William Jewell College in 1975. Richie was employed by TWA and eventually retired from American Airlines in Kansas City. He was an avid tennis player and golfer. He had the honor and privilege of playing tennis with Luciano Pavarotti when he visited Liberty. He frequently played pickup basketball games and enjoyed many sports as a spectator. Richie especially loved watching his grandsons, Tyler and Landon Klee, in their sports.\n\nRichie found Karen Hendrix in his early 30’s, who became his partner for the remainder of his life. Karen had her own daughter, Denise, and everyone accepted and recognized Richie and Karen as husband and wife. Denise loved Richie and considered him her dad for the past 30 plus years.\n\nRichie was an avid reader and was well versed in politics, both local and national. Like his father and brothers, Richie was opinionated, but he didn't waste time on social media, preferring to pass his retirement years with Karen, Denise and their grandchildren.\n\nUnfortunately, Richie's retirement was cut short by early onset Alzheimer's. Richie lived as healthy a lifestyle as anyone could. He never smoked or took so much as an aspirin. He did however love to splurge on a Burger King Junior Whopper and small Sonic shake every so often.\n\nRichie is survived by his life love, Karen, of the home; daughter, Denise Mahon (Charlie); three grandchildren, Tyler and Landon Klee and Delaney Mahon of Kansas City, MO; two brothers, David Leslie (Cheryl) of Kansas City, MO, James Michael (Lorrie) of Duck River, TN; three nieces, Kerrie Meinert (Aaron) of Kearney, Sarah Gray of Marshall, MO, and Leslie Kilgore of Huntsville, AL; two nephews Michael Gray (Dorothy) of Keller, TX, and Jeffrey Gray of Huntsville; as well as many extended family members.\n\nVisitation will begin at 9:30 am, followed by a service celebrating Richie's life at 10:30 am, on Saturday, October 26, at Park Lawn Northland Chapel, I-35 at State Route 291, Liberty, MO. Burial will follow in Glenridge Cemetery. Memorials are suggested to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation (www.alzinfo.org).\n\nService Information:\n\nVisitation will begin at 9:30 am, followed by a service celebrating Richie’s life at 10:30 am, on Saturday, October 26, at Park Lawn Northland Chapel, I-35 at State Route 291, Liberty, MO. Burial will follow in Glenridge Cemetery."
