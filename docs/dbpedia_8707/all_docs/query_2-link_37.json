        "text": "To celebrate the one-year anniversary of the opening of the Bob Dylan Center, we are delighted to present foremost Dylan scholar Michael Gray as he marks the golden anniversary of the publication of “Song and Dance Man: The Art of Bob Dylan.” Originally US-published in 1973, Gray’s study of Dylan’s musical trajectory has since appeared in revised editions and remains groundbreaking for its insightful analysis of the artist’s complex methodologies and deep connections to pre-war blues.\n\nGray, a UK-born author who is based in the South of France, will be visiting Tulsa for a one-night-only talk with audio. During the event, he will reflect on the writing and impact of his book “Song and Dance Man,” as well as his other works, which include “The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia” (2006), “Hand Me My Travelin’ Shoes: In Search of Blind Willie McTell” (2007) and “Outtakes on Bob Dylan” (2021). With over five decades of experience listening to and writing about Dylan, Gray will also share insights into the artist’s career and legacy.\n\nPlease join us for this special event with Michael Gray as we commemorate his landmark accomplishment and our own on the occasion of the Bob Dylan Center’s first anniversary.\n\nThe Bob Dylan Center thanks Craig Danuloff of The FM Club for sponsoring this program.\n\nWednesday, May 10, 7 p.m.\n\nDarby Family Screening Room, Bob Dylan Center\n\nAdmission: free for members; $10 general admission\n\nMembers, please sign in for member tickets."
