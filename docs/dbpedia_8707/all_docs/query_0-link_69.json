That's the gist of \"Sunny Side,\" Corey Wash's commission for the Palm Springs mural wall, which gets a refresh every spring in time for Desert Gold, our Coachella-season shindig. The painting, a riotously colorful ode to communing with nature, isn't just a call to get off your phone, but more broadly to take a step back and think about what matters.\n\nAce Hotel | March 19, 2024\n\nAn Endless Art Practice\n\nIt’s her studio, but to a passerby Hyungi Park would seem out of place. A vision in all black, the 28-year-old artist dons only a trace of color — the smattering of red tattoos that start on her left cheek and snake their way down her neck and arms, punctuating the thick collage of black ink. Her studio, on the other hand, is almost ethereal. Its white walls hold shelves brimming with machines, tools and containers of organic materials that Hyungi foraged, found or made.\n\nAce Hotel | February 12, 2024\n\nSoy Sauce, Like a Fine Wine\n\nEri Miyagi and Miki Nomura started Brooklyn-based Japanese condiment company Cabi Foods in 2022 for multitude reasons.

And to destroy the idea of Japanese condiments that “just sit there.” Launching with a yuzu vinegar, dashi soy sauce and sansho peppercorn miso — all sourced from small, regional producers — Cabi condiments focus on Japanese-specific flavors that go with anything: kale, chicken, vanilla ice cream.\n\nAce Hotel | December 13, 2023\n\nFran Miller's Toronto Guide\n\nFounder of the eponymous, pared-back line of natural skincare staples F.

Chef and writer Klancy Miller generously offers readers a place at that proverbial table in her latest book, “For The Culture: Phenomenal Black Women and Femmes in Food: Interviews, Inspiration, and Recipes.”\n\nAce Hotel | August 28, 2023\n\nArchiving Australia with Efficient Space\n\nMichael is the head honcho at Efficient Space, the Melbourne-based record label responsible for outfitting Ace Sydney with a treasure trove of a vinyl library and for archiving and re-releasing obscure, ahead-of-its-time Australian music. At Efficient Space, the mission isn’t burn fast but bright, but rather driven by the careful, occasionally tedious and always time-consuming work of preservation. “Most of the projects we’re uncovering maybe wouldn't happen if we didn’t instigate it, and that’s the motivation,” Michael says.\n\nAce Hotel | August 12, 2023\n\nPrinted Matters: 5 Things with LA Art Book Fair\n\nFor the first time since 2019, New York City based Printed Matter’s beloved LA Art Book Fair has returned — gracing the opposite coast with its eclectic cohort of zine-makers, artists, collectives, and more.
