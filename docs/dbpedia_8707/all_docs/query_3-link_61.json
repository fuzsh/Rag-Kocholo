        "text": "Thomas Shelby: the texturised crop\n\nThomas Shelby's texturised crop is short on the back and sides of the head with a slightly longer length on top.\n\nAsk the barber: Ask for a \"crop\" but indicate you would like to have the fringe sweeping to the right or left and short around the back and sides with extra length left on top.\n\nDo it yourself: To create the Thomas Shelby \"textured crop\" make sure the clipper is set to a number one or two around the back and sides to achieve a contrast between the hair on top. For the sweeping fringe you want to keep the hair on top fairly long, around two or three inches would be sufficient to give it the volume and texture.\n\nWhat to use:\n\nHow to style: Put a coin-size amount of the Ponsonby Pomade by Triumph & Disaster in your hand to warm up. While applying the pomade sweep your fringe to the side you desire to then create your sweeping fringe effect. Apply in light circular motions to create the messy-textured look. Pomade will create a light shine but with a firm hold.\n\nThis style is better for the more defined face shapes and anyone worried about thinning or receding hairlines.\n\nArthur Shelby: the undercut\n\nThe undercut look is one where the sides and back are completely shaved. You then have a mass of long hair on the top of the head which can be slicked back.\n\nAsk the barber: Ask for a \"disconnected undercut\" but indicate for end result you would like to slick back your hair with the back and sides short.\n\nHow to get the look: To create the Arthur Shelby undercut use your clippers on a number one or two and then follow through high and tight around both the back and sides. Keeping plenty of length on top in order to slick back.\n\nWhat to use:\n\nHow to style: Apply Strong Hold Pomade by Tenax to slightly damp hair whilst combing back, to achieve more volume apply pomade again to hands and push through hair adding texture. This pomade will create a light shine with a firm hold.\n\nMichael Gray: side parting\n\nA classic side parting is perfect for the party season ahead, this is a well distinguished look which works well with many different haircuts.\n\nAsk the barber: Ask for a traditional \"side parting\" in theme with the Twenties or Thirties. Indicate that you do not want the back or sides shaved but rather cut with scissors which will give it a feathered fade.\n\nTip: Ask your barber to cut in your parting with a cut-throat razor, this will make it easier when styling to find the line of the parting.\n\nHow to get the look: To create the Michael Gray side parting keep the length of the top, however, thin down if necessary whilst tidying up around the back and sides, maintaining length, finally make sure you taper around the ears to ensure a clear finish.\n\nWhat to use:\n\nHow to style: Blow dry your hair in the direction of the sweep you wish your hair to stay on and then comb through to create the parting. Apply the Grooming Crème by Bumble And bumble to separate parting to give it a more defined shape. The cream will create a medium shine and firm hold which should last the whole day.\n\nAlfie Solomons: the voluminous beard\n\nWhen it comes to achieving Tom Hardy's Peaky Blinders look, it's less about the hair and more about the beard.\n\nAsk the barber: Ask your barber for a long, lumberjack-style beard. If you’re worried about them cutting your beard too short make sure you ask them to start off a few millimetres longer. They can work their way shorter if you want. And don’t forget to ask your barber for advice on where you should have your shave line around your jaw and neck area.\n\nDo it yourself: To achieve Tom Hardy’s voluminous beard, it’s going to require time and you’ll have to suffer through a few awkward stages, but the result will be worth it. It may sound counterproductive, but you’re going to have to trim your beard while growing it out. Opt for some beard scissors and simply snip away at any stray hairs. Avoid trimming the top of your beard line too aggressively, but make sure you get rid of any rogue hairs around your cheeks.\n\nWhat to use:\n\nHow to style: Once grown, you have to learn to seriously look after that masterful beard. It's vital you don't wash your beard every day, as this will cause the hair to become dry and brittle. Instead, opt for a pea-size drop of beard oil or balm each day to nourish and keep your stray hairs in formation. DR Harris' beard oil is a perfect choice for those beginning to grow a beard, thanks to its nourishing formula that soothes itchiness and irritation.\n\nWe suggest you opt for a neater version of Tom Hardy's Peaky Blinders facial hair, thus a beard comb is about to become your new best friend. While it's still short you'll want to use a bristle brush (this will also help clean your beard) but once longer switch to a beard comb, perfect for detangling and styling.\n\nJohn Shelby: the undercut crop\n\nA combination of Arthur and Tommy’s hair, John’s undercut crop is shorter and requires much less styling.\n\nAsk the barber: Ask for an undercut crop with the sides of you hair shaved to a zero and a short crop on top just long enough to style it to the side but not sweeping like Tommy’s.\n\nDo it yourself: Make sure the clipper is set to zero for the back and sides. For the top you want to keep the hair longer, but only just. You want your hair to be able to stay in place without too much product.\n\nWhat to use:\n\nHow to style: The best thing about opting for John Shelby's haircut? You can skip the product completely if you want, but some added hold never goes amiss. GQ recommends opting for a light product such as Label M's spray wax and using a small amount to smooth down you hair.\n\nNow read:\n\nA first look at Peaky Blinders series five\n\nCillian Murphy talks Peaky Blinders, Dunkirk and winning GQ Actor Of The Year\n\nPeaky Blinders series six is shooting next year"
