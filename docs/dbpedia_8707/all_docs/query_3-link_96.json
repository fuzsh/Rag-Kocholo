        "text": "Celebrity Big Brother star Patsy Kensit split from her boyfriend just days before entering the TV house.\n\nThe relationship broke down as footballer Michael Gray flew off to the Middle East with another woman.\n\nTwo weeks ago we reported that the four-times divorced actress had enjoyed a string of dates with the former Sunderland and Wolverhampton Wanderers defender before taking part in the Channel 5 show.\n\nBut we can reveal that Michael, 40, has now grown close to Swedish author and artist Patricia Wilson.\n\nWatch Patsy's CBB housemates react to her eviction:\n\nThe pair are currently in Doha, Qatar, where Michael is working as a TV pundit.\n\nFriends say Patsy – who was once married to Oasis rocker Liam Gallagher – has been left upset by the failure of the relationship.\n\nJust a day before going into the CCB house, she tweeted the cryptic message: “Broken hearts mend... Just learnt to be mindful of where to open my heart again....”\n\nRetired soccer star Michael, who earned three caps for England, recently got together with Patricia after she and her Australian husband parted.\n\nA friend said: “Micky was dating Patsy for a while and it seemed as though it was going really well, but for some reason it appears to have come to an end. He’s kept it all rather quiet. It must be upsetting for Patsy.\n\n“Micky has always been fond of Patricia. They’ve been sharing a hotel bedroom and hanging out on the beach together – things certainly seem to be moving fast between them.”\n\nLast week Michael was in the Middle East hosting coverage of the Asia Cup football tournament while Patsy spoke of her relief at leaving the TV house.\n\nThe ex-Emmerdale star shouted “thank God” when host Emma Willis announced news of her departure. She emerged from the house to a mixed reception of both boos and cheers from the crowd.\n\nOn being greeted by Emma outside, she said: “It was terrible in there.”\n\nPatsy, 46, was first married at the age of 19 to Big Audio Dynamite keyboard player Dan Donovan. They split after three years, and in 1992 she married Simple Minds lead singer Jim Kerr. They had a son, James, now 20, but parted after four years.\n\nWithin a year, Patsy had wed Liam Gallagher after meeting him on a plane. They had son Lennon in 1999 but separated the following year.\n\nAlmost a decade later Patsy got hitched to DJ Jeremy Healy but it was all over after a year.\n\nShe once revealed how she had married every one of her boyfriends, and claims she is a true romantic."
