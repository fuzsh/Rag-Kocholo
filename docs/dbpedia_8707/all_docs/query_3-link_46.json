        "text": "Career\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nIn 1970 McDonald moved to Los Angeles, where he recorded a handful of unsuccessful demos and singles before joining the rock group Steely Dan as a session backup vocalist and keyboardist in 1973. He became a member of Steely Dan’s touring band in 1974 and contributed backing vocals to songs such as “Bad Sneakers” and “Black Friday” from the group’s 1975 album Katy Lied. Although he would eventually join the Doobie Brothers, he maintained a close professional relationship with the members of Steely Dan and added backing vocals to tracks on the group’s The Royal Scam (1976), Aja (1977), and Gaucho (1980) and perhaps most memorably on the band’s 1977 hit single “Peg.”\n\nIn 1975 Jeff Baxter, a guitarist for the Doobie Brothers, recommended that McDonald temporarily replace the band’s lead singer, Tom Johnston, who was ill at the time, on tour. The band was so impressed with McDonald’s musicianship that it invited him to become a full-time member. In the book Long Train Runnin’: Our Story of the Doobie Brothers (2022), bass guitarist Tiran Porter recalled, “The second I heard him open up his mouth…my mind was blown right there.” McDonald’s husky vocals and gospel-inflected keyboard style transformed the band’s feel-good rock and roll sound into a smooth, soulful R&B approach. As their lead vocalist, McDonald cowrote and performed on hit singles such as “Takin’ It to the Streets” (1976), “It Keeps You Runnin’ ” (1976), the multiple Grammy Award-winning “What a Fool Believes” (1979), “Minute by Minute” (1979), and “Real Love” (1980).\n\nOver the years McDonald collaborated with other popular vocalists. He recorded the duet “Let Me Go, Love” (1978) with Nicolette Larson and contributed backing vocals to the hit song “Ride Like the Wind” (1979) by Christopher Cross. McDonald also appeared on numerous albums by performers that included Carly Simon, Bonnie Raitt, Elton John, Rickie Lee Jones, Kenny Loggins (with whom he wrote “What a Fool Believes”), Joni Mitchell, and the Pointer Sisters.\n\nThe Doobie Brothers disbanded in 1982, in large part because of McDonald’s increasing focus on his solo career. His debut album, If That’s What It Takes (1982), features the jazzy hit single “I Keep Forgettin’ (Every Time You’re Near).” His second solo release, That Was Then: The Early Recordings of Michael McDonald (1982), is a collection of his early singles. His next release, No Lookin’ Back (1985), has a harder rock sound and spawned a minor hit with the title track. While developing his solo career McDonald continued collaborating with other artists. His duets with Patti LaBelle on “On My Own” (1986) and James Ingram on “Yah Mo B There” (1983) reached number one and number 19, respectively, on the U.S. charts. McDonald’s solo recording of “Sweet Freedom,” the theme song from the action comedy film Running Scared (1986), reached number seven on the U.S. charts.\n\nMcDonald combined rock and soul music on his 1990 album Take It to Heart. In 1991 he was featured on Aretha Franklin’s single “Ever Changing Times,” which was cowritten by Burt Bacharach. That same year, McDonald reunited with former Steely Dan bandmates Donald Fagen and Walter Becker to record and tour with the New York Rock and Soul Revue, a musical collective that also included Phoebe Snow and Boz Scaggs. For his album Blink of an Eye (1993), which features a soulful remake of the 1963 Freddie Scott hit “Hey, Girl,” McDonald enlisted guest supporting musicians, including country singer Vince Gill and bluegrass singer Alison Krauss."
