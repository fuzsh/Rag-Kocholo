The excitement is therefore palpable for his soon come album Optimism, which sees Michael pour both his heart and his three decades + of experience into what will be one of THE albums of the year.\n\n'This album has been a year and a half in the making,' states the ‘Weekend’ hitmaker and one half of legendary disco house pioneers Full Intention, clearly now keen to release his career-defining magnum opus out into the world.\n\nIn these confused and often frightening times, we need musical communion more than ever. Only too aware of this, Michael has 'set out to make an album full of positivity.' Needless to say, the resulting 'hybrid of classic disco mixed with modern disco and soul' hits the spot and looks set to provide a soulful summer soundtrack to lift spirits and fill dancefloors.\n\nIn an era of often generic, over-computerised sounds, Michael returns to the source of his lifelong musical inspirations. 'Most of these productions have involved working with live strings and horns,' he enthuses. The musicians include live drums by Derrick Mckenzie from Jamiroquai, percussion by Russ Tarley from Incognito and string arranger Stephen Hussey, known for his work on Soul II Soul’s early hits.\n\nMichael’s much-needed musical missives for the ages are masterful manna from the heavens.

For planet earth. For humanity. People desired for escapism, and some producers just had the jive they yearned for. Endless kick drum excitement under a roof of strings. Up there in clap heaven, the chords fly candid, and all that hi-hat suspense fashions bliss. These dancers met an angel, circulating eternally towards the strobe. Oh, how they wished all that trance never ends in 1993, when CJ Bolland, one of the most influential and successful producers Belgium created in the nineties, dropped “Camargue”. An instant trance techno classic. Atemporal, abnormal, amoral. Raved together with British producer Cisco Ferreira for Belgium’s finest R&S records. Both worked on many sensual club music artworks together. Like “Tokyo”, the B-Site with an A-Note. Tripping fast, more hi-hat ecstasy, techno kicks, somewhere Goa is in there. Those where the 1990ees. Those days in fast pace. Blissed with trance of techno glam.\n\nMore\n\nbackorder\n\nLast in:09.08.2024\n\nCat-No:OYSTER57\n\nGenre:Techno\n\nConfiguration:12\"\n\nBarcode:\n\n1\n\nButtechno - trancer\n\n2\n\nButtechno - tech metal\n\n3\n\nButtechno - mc2oh2\n\n4\n\nButtechno - bleeps\n\nPavel Milyakov, AKA Buttechno, coming through with the kind of impeccably-produced, trance-inducing deftness we've come to expect.\n\nA kindred spirit of the Oyster Cult, this is a union long overdue. While he’s often found working in horizontal zones, inhabiting the intersection between ambient and downtempo, these are dancefloor dynamics for pure contemplation. Gone is the amorphous abstraction of releases like ‘PSY X’ and the kind output reserved for release under his birth name, instead opting for a lean, hypnotic kind of minimalism.\n\n‘OYSTER57’ picks up where the ‘Inorganic Demons’ LP and aptly-titled ‘Minimal Cuts’ series left off. Saying that, the first three tracks navigate territory gloomier than the aforementioned; uneasy at times but deeply engrossing, smudged and frayed into heads-down interzones of tunnelling throb and icy melodic flourish. Girder-strength pressure primed for metaphysical experience.\n\nThen, like a vestige of the finest turn-of-the-century progressive trance, ’bleeps’ ends proceedings on a slight departure. A showcase of restraint from the Berlin-based maestro and a fitting way to close.

Euphoria Record’s vaults are open and finally, for the first time since 1997, this seminal tech-house classic is available to everyone for the very first time in over 25 years. This 1997 indie record was Euphoria Records second release – and their first international record. Whether you agree with it or not, many people consider this one of the pioneering records of American Tech-House. Both sides and several mysterious alternate versions have graced the decks of DJs like Evil Eddie Richards, Terry Francis, Derrick Carter, Tyler Stadius, and Magda. The list goes on.??

Give It Up\n\nA2. Wait 4 U\n\nB1. What I Want\n\nB2. Own Way\n\nHighlight:\n\nWisdom Teeth co-founder K-Lone is dropping two EPs on Aus Music: the first instalment nods to UKG and house flavours, landing mid-May, while the second offers a deeper, broken techno vibe, arriving in late June. 'Give It Up' opens Part 1 with a bubbly rhythm and bassline that percolates through the woody, organic percussion. Lush pads and neon lines swirl skyward to silky and seductive effect as various other samples and daubs of colour bring the groove to life. The heady 'Wait 4 U' is a textbook K-Lone house cut with low swinging bass, sultry sax stabs and molten R&B samples that get the juices going next to warm, diffused synth lines.\n\nOn the flip, 'What I Want' ups the pace but keeps it deep and smooth with rubbery kicks and gooey bass overlaid with soft-edged chord stabs that will pump the floor. Lastly, 'Own Way' closes down with a tumbling bassline that takes you deeper as muted vocal sounds and glowing chords hook you into an infectious groove suited to the most intimate dancefloors.\n\nUK trailblazer K-Lone heads up the label Wisdom Teeth with fellow producer Facta and has released everything from club-primed garage to innovative home listening records. Whether cooking up kinetic beats and bouncy bass or soundtracking a lazy summer's afternoon with synthesised bird calls and lush marimbas, the London-bred artist is a proven studio wizard. Critical acclaim has come for both his ‘Swells’ and ‘Cape Cira’ albums, and now his ‘Catching Wild’ EPs for Aus Music offer yet another portal into the colourful world of his idiosyncratic, signature sound.\n\nMore\n\nbackorder\n\nLast in:14.06.2024\n\nLabel:Risk Management\n\nCat-No:RM-01\n\nGenre:Chicago House\n\nConfiguration:12\"\n\nBarcode:\n\n1\n\nTom Carruthers - Cold World\n\n2\n\nTom Carruthers - Pump It Up\n\n3\n\nTom Carruthers - Only Desire\n\n4\n\nTom Carruthers - Lost In A Groove\n\nA NEW FOUR TRACKER BY RISK MANAGEMENT PRODUCTIONS CREW MEMBER, TOM CARRUTHERS!

Produced and arranged by seasoned veterans Tony Silvester and Bert DeCoteaux this incredibly hypnotic song was also written by top writers J.R. Bailey and Ken Williams. \"After Hours\" has grown in popularity particularly over the last few years with original copies now reaching the £200-£250 valuation.\n\nThe flip-side is another slice of beautiful mid-tempo soul from the same production stable. Only one copy currently available the last time we checked, such has been the demand over the last two years especially. Quite why this record has been underground for so long is open to debate. Vic Marcel was under contract to RCA at the time hence the Charlie Mitchell pseudonym. Janus were also suffering distribution problems at the time which explains why the original is so rare. We're proud to finally make this available again on the original Janus imprint. Another double-sided beauty. More"
