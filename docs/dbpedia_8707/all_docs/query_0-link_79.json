        "text": "A Florida woman was arrested Monday in connection to the death of a Lake County sheriff’s deputy whom members of the woman’s family allegedly killed during a standoff in their home, where they’d stockpiled a variety of weapons and “anti-government propaganda,” authorities announced.\n\nJulie Sulpizio, 48, is charged with 12 offenses, including murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted murder, after her family became involved in an intense standoff with authorities that resulted in the death of Deputy Bradley Michael Link, 28, and the injury of two other deputies, officials said.\n\nSulpizio was already in custody by the time deputies entered the home where the shooting took place. However, authorities say the incident began when she tried to lure her neighbors into her house so her husband could kill them. Sulpizio allegedly later said that her husband acted under her command.\n\nOn Friday morning, deputies responded to a call about Sulpizio allegedly trespassing and assaulting people in front of her neighbors’ home in Eustis, Florida, Sheriff Peyton Grinnell told reporters Monday.\n\nGrinnell said Sulpizio began striking her neighbors and calling them “sinners.”\n\nA deputy arrived at the home and was approached by Sulpizio. During a calm verbal exchange, according to Grinnell, Sulpizio accused the neighboring family of being “involved in pedophilia,” and asked one of the victims, “Who is your God?”\n\nSulpizio made further religious references before trying to convince the family to approach her house as she followed behind, according to Grinnell. She then walked toward the deputy, who pulled out his stun gun and gave her a warning.\n\nThe deputy brought Sulpizio to the ground and handcuffed her as she resisted, Grinnell said.\n\nAnother deputy who responded to the scene then conducted a welfare check on Sulpizio’s home, where she lived with her husband, Michael Sulpizio, 48, and their daughters Cheyenne, 23, and Savannah, 22.\n\nThe deputy saw three people running inside the house, according to Grinnell. Deputies then observed two dead dogs on the front lawn, and called for backup after seeing a broken window on the side of the house.\n\nMore deputies arrived and identified themselves to make contact with the people inside the house, Grinnell said, and authorities then learned that Michael Sulpizio had previously threatened to shoot the neighbors’ children.\n\nDeputies attempted to enter the home through the back door while announcing their entry, according to Grinnell. Footage taken from Link’s body camera showed Michael Sulpizio on the couch with a rifle, where Grinnell said he had been waiting for the deputies.\n\nThe deputies inside the house were then met with gunfire, and Link was struck multiple times, as was Deputy Harold Howell, 41, Grinnell said. Link was immobilized by his wounds and trapped inside the house, with no more rounds in his gun, but Howell and the other deputies were able to get out.\n\nDetectives outside the house then attempted to negotiate with the Sulpizios inside, but they were unsuccessful, Grinnell said.\n\nAs Link lay injured, his body camera was still recording. On the tape, Grinnell said, a woman’s voice can be heard yelling “My king will kill all of you” and “You are Lucifer’s children” in response to deputies outside calling for Link to crawl out to them.\n\nDeputy Stefano Gargano, 28, led an extraction team to get Link out of the home. Gargano was shot several times with high-caliber rounds through the walls, Grinnell said, and then had to be extracted himself.\n\nA SWAT team then entered the home, where they found the two daughters dead on the couch with self-inflicted gunshot wounds, Grinnell said. Michael Sulpizio was also discovered with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Grinnell said, and he later died at a hospital.\n\nLink’s body camera recorded a woman talking about suicide as the SWAT team was getting into position, Grinnell said. Link was finally rescued after the SWAT team entered, but he died of his wounds at a hospital.\n\nGargano was in critical condition when he was taken to the hospital, but after three surgeries, his condition was stable as of Wednesday. Howell is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nDetectives who searched the residence found a total of 20 firearms, including high-caliber rifles, pistols, shotguns and stockpiled ammunition in the living room area, Grinnell said. Additional ammunition, gas masks, body armor, camouflage suits, medical bags and other survival essentials were also found in the home.\n\nGrinnell said detectives also found “anti-government propaganda” and “conspiracy-theory related media.” Lake County Lt. John Harrell later clarified that detectives found “bumper stickers, stickers, [and] handouts,” as well as “flyers” for the right-wing conspiracy platform Infowars and for various podcasts.\n\nDuring her interview with detectives, Julie Sulpizio said she had been trying to lure her neighbors to her house so her husband could kill them, according to Grinnell. She allegedly claimed both to be God and that God spoke through her. She also allegedly asserted that her husband was the angel Michael and that he obeyed her command. She was taken to a hospital following the standoff and arrested on Monday following her discharge.\n\nState Attorney Bill Gladson said Monday that officials were still reviewing evidence in the case. Online court records on Tuesday showed that Julie Sulpizio had been charged with murder of a law enforcement officer, attempted murder, battery by strangulation, battery by touch or striking, and battery on a law enforcement officer.\n\nIf convicted, Sulpizio would eligible for the death penalty, Gladson said. It’s unclear if she has an attorney representing her. She is scheduled to appear in court on Sept. 3.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat 988lifeline.org for mental health support.
