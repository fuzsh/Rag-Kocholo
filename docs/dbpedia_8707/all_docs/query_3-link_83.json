        "text": "The highly-anticipated sixth and final series of BBC drama Peaky Blinders began on Sunday, February, 28 and as the series kicked off one very important character was missing.\n\nPolly Gray, the formidable aunt of main character Tommy Shelby, who was played by Helen McCrory will be missing from the series as Helen sadly passed away from cancer in 2021.\n\nYou can read more TV news here.\n\nAlthough Helen had begun filming for the series before her death, her character Polly, who is at the heart of the Shelby family, will not be appearing in the series. Don't read on if you want to avoid spoilers.\n\nIn the show Aunt Polly's shock death was credited to the IRA, who delivered Aunt Polly's body as a warning to Tommy.\n\nIRA member Captain Swing tells Tommy: \"We've made changes to the structure of your organisation. You've had a crutch to lean on, we kicked away that crutch. From now on it'll be us you lean on.\"\n\nLater in the show, Peaky Blinders paid a very emotional and touching tribute to both Aunt Polly and Helen McCrory as the show aired a three-minute silence and heartfelt funeral scene.\n\nPolly's son Michael Gray, played by Finn Cole, vows to get his revenge on Tommy for the death of his mother and the rest series looks set to bring the high tension drama Peaky Blinders is known and loved for.\n\nPeaky Blinders continues on BBC One on Sunday, March, 6 at 9pm."
