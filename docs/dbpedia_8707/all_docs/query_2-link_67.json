        "text": "Starting in 2006, I began research into the family history on my mother’s side---her maiden name was Virginia Cora Gray. Prior to her death, she provided little if any information about the Gray family, which I discovered (through pure chance) had indeed a rich history in Texas going back to the 1830’s when my great, great, great grandfather, Pleasant Gray, founded the City of Huntsville, Texas, and was a good friend of the legendary Sam Houston. Some early research concerning Pleasant, and his family, is included in Appendix 1 to this publication. The Gray family tree is located on the Pleasant Gray website (www.pleasantgray.com). One other source of family history and my research, the Pleasant Gray family bible, is held in the historical archives section of the library at Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas.\n\nIn 2008, my brother Eric visited the Gray Ranch in southwestern New Mexico which was owned in the early 1880s by our great, great uncle Michael (“Mike”) Gray, son of Pleasant Gray, and brother of my great, great grandfather, John A.W. Gray (also known as “Jack”).\n\nJack Gray enlisted in the Confederate Army in Texas. From 1862 to 1865, he engaged in minor skirmishes during the Civil War in Arkansas (some sites of which I have visited). After the war, he returned to Terrell, Texas, was married and had three children---but died at the age of 44. He is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery in Terrell Texas, with a headstone I placed in 2007. His son, George Gray, is my great grandfather and was a prominent citizen in Terrell, Texas---including being fire chief, assistant post-master, printer, and a dry goods store owner. Their house at 601 Johnson Street, Terrell, Texas still stands, and there are photos of George Gray, his son Glenn (my grandfather) and my mother, Virginia, in front of that house from the 1920s. George Gray and his wife, Vernie Cora Sommers, are buried in the Oakwood Cemetery in Terrell, Texas.\n\nAbout the time Eric returned from his initial visit to the Gray Ranch in 2008, I also discovered the memoirs of one of Mike Gray’s sons, John Plesent Gray, and that started the search for more information about Mike and his family who were indeed first hand witnesses and participants in one of the richest parts of Old West history---the late 1800s in and around Tombstone, Arizona.\n\nPrior to his death, Eric and I made one trip together to the Gray Ranch as part of this research, and thereafter I made several more to Arizona and New Mexico---acquiring more information each time, meeting some very knowledgeable people, local historians and general “characters”. I reviewed old archives, and visited some places that few people have been able to access---both because of their remoteness and the fact that certain properties relating to the family history, most notably the Gray Ranch and the Guadalupe Canyon Ranch, are now in private ownership.\n\nThe available information concerning Mike Gray and his family could probably be compiled into a more scholarly biographical format than the compilation that I have chosen herein, but some of the source material to my research is so thorough and well-written that I have elected to include those materials in various appendices to this publication and post them to the Pleasant Gray website, rather than do the disservice of trying to summarize them. A failure to read them will unquestionably result in overlooking an enormous amount of rich history---not only of the Gray family, but of the places and times in which they lived. Most notably, these materials include the above-referenced memoirs of John Plesent Gray (Appendix 2 on the Gray family website), which were written in the 1940 and effectively “lost” for almost 60 years until they were unearthed in the 1990s by historian W. Lane Rogers. Rogers took those memoirs and annotated them with photos and footnotes that put John’s accounts into greater factual perspective. But, in addition to John Gray’s memoirs, other notable Old West historians, such as Lynn Bailey, Ben Traywick and Roy Young, have published materials that describe aspects of Mike Gray’s interesting life. There are also some unpublished materials about Mike Gray that are posted on the Pleasant Gray website.\n\nUsing those materials, and interviews with a number of knowledgeable people over the past few years, I have sought to uncover information not previously documented (or in some cases photographed) which complements the published material and adds to the Mike Gray family history. That is what follows. It focuses heavily on the tragic murder of Mike’s nineteen year old son, Richard “Dixie Lee” Gray, at what has become famously known as the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre in August 1881, as well as on other events relating to the Gray family cattle operations in the Chiricahua Mountains at a former Army camp known as Fort Rucker--- which Mike Gray acquired after it was abandoned by the Army in 1882.\n\nA. BACKGROUND ON MIKE GRAY\n\nBorn in Tennessee in 1827, Mike was the oldest son of Pleasant and Hannah Gray. Pleasant arrived in southern Texas in 1830 and soon became a friend of Sam Houston. Pleasant reportedly gave Houston the land on which he built a home near Huntsville, Texas out of a seven square mile land grant that Pleasant received from the Mexican government in 1835. As the recognized founder of Huntsville, Texas, Pleasant laid out the design of the city and sold a large portion of his land to other earlier settlers in the Huntsville area. (A replica of Pleasant’s first home sits on the original Gray homesite on the Huntsville City downtown square across from the courthouse. A historical marker designates this site as well as a nearby site where Pleasant met with local Indians in his efforts to settle the area.)\n\nMike Gray enlisted in Sam Houston’s Texas Rangers at age 14, rising to the level of lieutenant and is believed to have fought against the Mexican army in the early days of the Texas Republic.\n\nDespite his relative prominence and some prosperity in Texas, Pleasant was intrigued with the opportunities presented by the California Gold Rush, and he decided to move the family to California in 1849. However, he tragically died on the journey west from cholera (although family lore attributes the death to an Indian attack.) The family was obviously devastated, but\n\nMike Gray met his future wife on that same wagon train trip to California, marrying Sarah Ann Robinson in 1853 while serving as sheriff of Yuba County, California. Thereafter, he moved to Sacramento and served as Sergeant of Arms for the California Assembly, the lower body of the state legislature. He was offered a commission by the California Volunteers to support the Union army in 1861, but declined due to his Confederate allegiance. (As part of my research, I also discovered a sales receipt evidencing that Mike Gray owned a female slave with two children in Texas and sold all three for $1000 to a William Reeves apparently before departing to California..)\n\nWhile Mike declined his commission with the California Volunteers, in the process he nonetheless acquired the unofficial title of “Colonel”. In California, Mike’s oldest son, John Plesent Gray was born in 1860.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Mike Gray moved the family to Mexico to pursue mining interests. In Guaymas, Sonora, he operated a mine as well as a hotel. His youngest son, Richard, was born in Mexico in 1862 and dubbed “Dixie Lee” to reflect Mike’s support to the Confederacy and its most famous general. After the Mexican mining efforts failed, the Gray family returned to California.\n\nThe discovery of silver by Ed Schieffelin in Southeastern Arizona in 1877 had the adventuresome Mike Gray on the move again, and in June 1879 he moved to Tombstone with his wife, Dixie Lee and daughter Maggie. John followed soon thereafter in 1880 after graduating from the University of California earlier that same year.\n\nIn 1879, Mike acquired an interest in the Way Up mine, adjacent to the Good Enough Mine which was owned, in part, by Ed Schieffelin. A significant lawsuit ensued between the owners of the Way up Mine and the Good Enough Mine, which alleged that Gray was illegally removing ore from the Good Enough Mine. Not to be intimidated by Schieffelin, Gray counterclaimed and engaged an expensive San Francisco law firm, at significant expense, to handle the lawsuit which Gray and his co-owners of the Way Up eventually won. (In 2011, using an old map of Tombstone mine locations, I believe I located the closed up entry to the Way Up Mine.)\n\nColonel Mike Gray has been referred to as a Tombstone “mover and shaker” and “fearless” by one prominent historian who cited his service as a justice of the peace (Gray administered the oath to Wyatt Earp as a deputy sheriff in July 1880). Besides being a mine operator, he was a boarding house owner, secretary to the town council, and staunch Democrat who was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 1886, 1892, 1898 and 1900. Another prominent historian called him “selfish and dishonest”, and “a most slippery customer”--- linking him the murders of Ike and Bill Heslett in June, 1881. Yet another author disparages him as a key figure in the Tombstone Townsite land fraud scandal, and yet another speculates that he was the “silent leader of the Cowboys.”\n\nIn 1881, recognizing the value of the then rich grasslands that could support large herds of cattle with burgeoning markets in the northern and western portions of the United States, Mike Gray\n\nacquired the “rights“ to a large tract of land (now approximately 300,000 acres) in the Animas Valley, located in the “bootheel” (southwestern corner) of New Mexico from outlaw Curly Bill Brocius. He paid Curly Bill the grand sum of $300 for his “rights”, and then set about to establish his legal title to this land under the New Mexico preemption law, which he ultimately did. He and his family established this ranching operation, called the Gray Ranch, while maintaining their business interests in Tombstone. Trips back and forth to Tombstone were frequent for Mike and the two sons, John and Dixie Lee, who helped their father with the cattle operations. According to John’s memoirs, the modest ranch house built at the Gray Ranch saw frequent visitors---Army personnel on patrol searching for renegade Apaches, various lawmen, and some of the most wanted and notorious outlaws of the time. All were welcome for a meal.\n\n(The tract purchased by Mike Gray for $300 in 1881 was sold a couple years later to the Hearst family from San Francisco for $12,000. A nice profit--- but in 1990 essentially the same tract was purchased for $18 million.)\n\nMike Gray, with his constant travelling back and forth from Tombstone to the Gray Ranch, cleverly managed relationships with the likes of Wyatt Earp and his brothers, as well as with the respected and law abiding elements of the Tombstone community (Judge William Stillwell, Sherriff John Behan, and others). But he also befriended outlaws like Curly Bill Brocius and Jim Crane, as well as members of the Clanton and McLaury families, both of which suffered at the hands of the Earps and Doc Holliday at the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in October 1881, only two months after the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre where Dixie Lee Gray was murdered. Mike Gray’s instinct for self-preservation was as keen as anyone who understood the power centers and inherent risks of life in the Old West.\n\nThe life of Curly Bill Brocius is the subject of two well-researched books: Curly Bill by Steve Gatto (2003) and Curly Bill, Horse Thief, Cattle Dealer, Murderer and Lawman: 1858-1909 by Randolph Farmer (2013). An interesting controversy remains as to whether Curly Bill was killed in 1882 by Wyatt Earp, as Earp claimed, or whether he returned to Texas and transformed himself into a respectable citizen and lawman.\n\nAs noted above, while no single comprehensive biography of Mike Gray has been written, there is a rich source of documentation concerning his life in Tombstone, the operation of the Gray Ranch, and the subsequent acquisition of Camp Rucker in the Chiricahua Mountains where he ran a cattle operation from 1882 to 1896. All of this documentation should be read carefully and includes:\n\nWhen All Roads Led to Tombstone: A Memoir by John Plesent Gray (edited by W. Lane Rogers in 1998). Appendix 2. This is a must read. A slightly annotated version of John\n\nP. Gray’s original memoirs, published by Neil B. Carmony, is included at Appendix 3 on the Gray website. Carmony’s version does not include the post 1882 section of the John Gray memoirs.\n\nCochise County Stalwarts (pages 154-56) by Lynn R. Bailey and Don Chaput (2000). See Appendix 4 at the Gray family website. This publication is hailed as the best researched summary of prominent Arizona figures in the late 1800s.\n\nChapter 18, The Murder of Robert Hardie, from Judge William Stillwell, Bench And Bar In Arizona Territory by Roy B. Young (2011). See Appendix 5 at the Gray family website. This is a richly detailed account of the murder of a prominent Los Angeles attorney visiting Mike Gray at Fort Rucker.\n\nChapter 11, Tombstone Mill & Mining Company v Way Up, from Judge William Stillwell, Bench and Bar In Arizona Territory by Roy B. Young (2011). See Appendix 6 at the Gray family website. This account of litigation instituted by Mike Gray against prominent adjacent mine owners in Tombstone reveals his determination to protect his interests at great cost.\n\nA Hundred Years of Horse Tracks, The Story of the Gray Ranch by George Hilliard (1996) pp. 1-35. See Appendix 7 at the Gray family website. This is a good summary of the early days of the Gray Ranch.\n\nThe History of Camp John A Rucker . See Appendix 8 at the Gray family website. An unpublished historical account of the history of Fort Rucker with many references to Mike Gray; includes documents found in Army archives at nearby Fort Bowie which is another preserved historical Army Camp with a museum.\n\nArizona Land Fraud: Model 1880 The Tombstone Townsite Company by Henry P. Walker, published in Arizona and The West, 1979 Volume 21, pp 5-36. See Appendix 9 at the Gray family website. The Townsite scandal reveals the real entrepreneurial side of Mike Gray, whose efforts to sell contested land in Tombstone is probably drawn from the experiences of his father, Pleasant Gray, who was very much the land developer in Huntsville, Texas in the 1830s, when he quite legitimately advertised for the sale of lots in Huntsville in publications back east and even on Mississippi river boats. A poster of such river boat promotions still exists in Huntsville archives. Mike Gray took heavy criticism for his attempts to sell contested lots in Tombstone. Despite this notoriety, Mike Gray should also be remembered for giving land away in Tombstone, including to the Catholic Church---again somewhat reminiscent of the generosity of his father, who once reportedly gave a plot of land to Sam Houston to build his first home in Huntsville.\n\nArcheology and History of Rucker Canyon, Coronado National Forest by William B. Gillespie and Mary M. Ferrell March, 1994. See Appendix 10 at the Gray family website. Discussed in more detail below, I discovered this unpublished article in a visit to Cave Creek Canyon with Eric where we met a local author who had a copy. It is an extraordinary document that recounts archeological discoveries over many centuries and maps the Fort Rucker area in wonderful detail. Time spent with Bill Gillespie was particularly fruitful.\n\nWyatt Earp, Angel of Death by Ben. T Traywick, (2007) pp.172-215. Traywick’s account of the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre is particularly worth reading since it introduces a theory that a posse led by Wyatt Earp (which included Earp’s brothers and Doc Holliday) was also present with the Rurales--- and that Earp’s posse was primarily responsible for the murders. See Appendix 11 at the Gray family website. Traywick is generally recognized as the official “historian” of Tombstone, and is the author of numerous well researched books and articles. He offers unique theories and views, which he unabashedly and entertainingly shared in our two personal meetings in Tombstone at his bookstore. If Traywick’s theory is true, it would be tragically ironic that Earp killed the son of Mike Gray who administered an oath of office to Earp in his early days as a lawman in Tombstone.\n\nRoy Young has also written a very well researched article that touches on Mike Gray relative to the murder of the Heslet Brothers (Ike and Billy) in 1881, at a time when Mike Gray was seeking to acquire the Heslet Ranch to expand his own Gray Ranch holdings. Young’s account provides a vivid description of events leading up to the murders, which were apparently committed by outlaw Jim Crane (a Gray family acquaintance) and a gang of 15-20 other men. The article provides insight into the “claim” process surrounding acquisition of grazing lands in southern New Mexico, including the process by which Mike Gray acquired and perfected his claim to the land that became the Gray Ranch. While Roy’s article repeats the speculation of others as to Mike Gray’s involvement in the killing of the Heslet brothers, no clear proof exists. His excellent article (See Exhibit 12 at the Gray family website) appears in the December 23, 2009 edition of Western Outlaw, and is entitled The Heslet Brothers in Grant County, New Mexico. Roy also shared some additional material with me regarding Mike Gray, following our initial meeting in Tombstone in 2012.\n\nFrom these materials, the following general timeline of key Gray family activities in Southeastern Arizona and Southern New Mexico can be developed:\n\n1879 Mike Gray’s arrival in Tombstone. His wife Sarah, and children John, Richard (“Dixie Lee”) and Maggie arrived slightly later starting likely in 1880.\n\n1880 Mike became Justice of the Peace in Tombstone.\n\n1880 Mike became active in Democratic Party in Tombstone (clerk of Tombstone’s Common Council).\n\nPart owner and operator of Way Up mine. Participation in Tombstone Town Site controversy.\n\n1881 Purchase of land from Curly Bill Brocius (now known as the Gray Ranch); construction of ranch house.\n\n1881 Murder of Dixie Lee Gray at Guadalupe Canyon.\n\n1883 Sale of Gray Ranch to the Hearst family of San Francisco for $12,000.\n\nPurchase of abandoned Army camp Fort Rucker in the Chiricahua mountains. Start of cattle operations at Fort Rucker and surrounding open grazing lands.\n\n1890 Murder of Robert Hardie by The Apache Kid while Hardie was a guest of Mike Gary at the Fort Rucker house.\n\n1893 Death of daughter Maggie. 1894 Death of wife Sarah.\n\n1896 Sale of Fort Rucker property to the Hampe family. 1896 Move to ranch in nearby Pearce, Arizona.\n\n1906 Death of Mike Gray at age 79 (buried Greenlawn Cemetery, Colina, California).\n\n1943 Death of son John Plesent Gray at age 82 (Inglewood Cemetery, Los Angeles, Ca. cremated).\n\nTHE GRAVES OF THE MEN MURDERED AT THE GUADALUPE CANYON MASSACRE\n\nOn August 13, 1881, seven men were ambushed in the Peloncillo Mountain range in Southwest New Mexico in what has long been referred to as to Guadalupe Canyon Massacre. Five were killed, presumably by an element of the Mexican country police known as the “Rurales” who had likely been dispatched to avenge an earlier attack on Mexicans in Skeleton Canyon, New Mexico. This was part of the then ongoing cycle of cattle rustling and murders involving Mexican and American outlaws, the latter often referred to in Old West lore as the “Cowboys”. The five murdered men included outlaw Jim Crane, rancher Billy Lang, reputed cattle rustlers Charlie Snow and Newman “Old Man Clanton”, and Richard “Dixie Lee” Gray, the 19 year old son of Colonel Mike Gray. (Many believe that the “Colonel” designation came from Mike’s affiliation with Sam Houston’s Texas Rangers when the Gray family lived in Texas prior to moving to California in 1849. In fact, as noted above, it was a title bestowed unofficially on him in California when his service into the Confederate Army was unsuccessfully solicited during the Civil War.)\n\nAll five men were killed early in the morning of August 13th, some (including Dixie Lee) before\n\nthey escaped their bedrolls, while camped in preparation for a cattle drive to Tombstone. Ironically, Dixie Lee had joined the group, at his father’s exhortation, simply for the safety of not travelling alone to Tombstone through the Guadalupe Canyon, which was one of the more dangerous routes in that border area because of the constant violence surrounding cattle rustling\n\n--- and related murders and robberies. This same part of southwestern part of New Mexico also served as an “out of state” refuge for outlaw Cowboys from nearby Arizona towns like Tombstone, Charleston, and Galleyville, and other surrounding areas in Arizona where the Cowboys engaged in illegal activities. Outlaw Jim Crane and the Clanton family both had small ranch hideouts in New Mexico near the Gray Ranch which was just north of Guadalupe Canyon. (During my research trips, I visited Tombstone on several occasions, as well as Charleston and Galleyville, Arizona, which were favorite hangouts of the outlaw element---filled with bars and brothels---and long ago abandoned,. I also visited the Clanton family hideout location off the Geronimo Trail near the Gray Ranch.)\n\nWithout question, of all that has been written about the Gray family, the most comprehensive history of the Grays from 1879 to 1900 is found in the memoirs of Mike’s son, John Plesent Gray. It is often acclaimed as one of the finest firsthand accounts of life in and around Tombstone in its heyday. John’s memoirs vividly describe many events and personal interactions of the Gray family with prominent and notorious men, and include John’s personal account of the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre.\n\nInformation from John’s memoirs, and some recent detective work, has solved one of the mysteries for our family---where exactly is the grave of Dixie Lee Gray? We now know the answer to that question, and in the process we have likely established where all the other four murder victims of the Guadalupe Canyon Massacre are buried. Until the recent discovery of the graves of Jim Crane, Billy Lang and Charlie Snow, only the grave site of Newman “Old Man” Clanton in the Boot Hill cemetery in Tombstone had been confirmed. So here is how the mystery as to the location of those graves was solved.\n\nJohn Gray’s memoirs reflect the following information, which includes his own account of recovering the bodies and their burial, as well as that of one of the two survivors, Billy Byers.\n\nByers’ own report of the attack is published in various newspaper articles in 1881, including an article from The Arizona Weekly Star, August 25, 1881 with the following account:"
