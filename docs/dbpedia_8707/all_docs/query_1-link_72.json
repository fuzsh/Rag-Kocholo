With a thriving retro bassline and quick lyrics from RoRoe, this playful tune about the joys of raving at home couldnât be more poignant following the recent news that UK nightclubs will remain closed. While this is an absolute blow to the industry, praise goes out to the many talented artists creating new music to continuing the rave at home.\n\nThe career of Grammy-nominated British DJ and producer, Michael Gray spans decades. The highly respected artist is best known for his mid-00âs worldwide hits âThe Weekendâ and âBorderlineâ, as one half of the production / remixing duo Full Intention and spinning at the worldâs best club nights - Glitterbox and Defected to name just two.\n\nRelaunching his solo career topursue his love of disco, Gray dominated Traxsource, placing as the worldâs#2 Soul/Funk/Disco Artist in 2019; scooping the Bestselling Single of2019 for his remix of Sylvesterâs 'You Make Me Feel' (Sultra Records) and being crowned âArtist Of The Yearâ in 2020 after selling more tracks that any other on the platform.\n\nProving his world-class production skills span audiences from the mainstream to the underground, Grayâs UK Top10 single âThe Weekendâ was reworked by Gray himself in 2020 as âMichaelâs Sultra Remixâ. It scored plays from the popular BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show through to the specialist show of Dance Music Don, Pete Tong.\n\nJoining Gray on âJump Inâ is rising superstar James Hurr. His credits as a production and mixing engineer are an impressive âwhoâs whoâ of the UKâs best-known dance talents. Hurr is behind Mark Knightâs âYebisahâ and Prok & Fitchâs âWowâ, plus dozens of tracks, collabs and remixes with Michael Gray, Hoxton Whores, Moto Blanco, Armitage, Frederick & Kusse, Tony Moran and Dominique Young. As a channel for his commercial side, Hurr debuted as âHrrtzâ with the Atlantic Records signed, âMiracle ft. Light Armyâ achieving over 4.4 million streams. Toolroom Recordâs Mark Knight said recently that was Hurr âwas on fireâ. The man wasnât wrong.\n\nCompleting the bill on âJump Inâ is London-Born New Yorker, RoRoe. While the name may be new to some, this song-writer has teamed up with super producer Mr. Bangladesh to ghost-write for the world renowned pop queen, Rihanna and for X-Factor runnerâs up, JLS. Stepping from behind the curtain and into the spotlight, RoRoe released her debut single âRIVERâ in 2020 and first featured with Michael Gray on disco outing, âThe Oneâ. RoRoe is now carving out her own artistic lane, bringing her Afro beats roots into an array of dynamic and upbeat singles to be released this summer. Itâs about time RoRoeâs talents rode front and centre.\n\nâJump Inâ is another solid release from Perfect Havoc.
