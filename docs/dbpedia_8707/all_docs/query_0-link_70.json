        "text": "In Britain, Radio 1 and Top of the Pops began in the Sixties, but by 1970 the Disc Jockeys (or DJ’s) had been elevated to stardom, and many were household names;\n\nTony Blackburn, David ‘Diddy’ Hamilton, Alan ‘Fluff’ Freeman, Dave Lee Travis, Noel Edmonds and Jimmy Saville (who moved to television with Jim’ll Fix It in 1975). Noel Edmonds joined Keith Chegwin, John Craven and Maggie Philbin in Multi-Coloured Swap Shop.\n\nMike Ahern\n\nBorn in Liverpool on 30 September 1942, Mike Ahern was educated at St Bedes Secondary Modern School until he was 15.\n\nHis first job was in a menswear store where, after three months, he had a serious mishap with an expensive suit and left.\n\nWork as a clerk, barman and factory hand followed before he decided to take his undoubted (to Mike) talents to France. Here he remained for two years as a grape-picker and learnt to speak French, Greek, Spanish, German and Italian.\n\nOn his return to Liverpool, he and a friend opened a club, “The Teen-Beat Club”, which had moderate success until the local council declared the floor to be unsafe.\n\nHe joined Radio Caroline North and later transferred to the South ship. He departed Caroline in 1967 for Radio 1, though it was a short-lived affair, with Ahern departing for Australia to work for a slew of stations there. He returned to the UK in 1988.\n\nMike Ahern passed away as a result of lung cancer on 5 October 2009, aged 67.\n\nDon Allen\n\nBorn in Winnipeg, Manitoba, “Daffy” Don Allen took a course in announcing in Chicago after leaving school and, on graduating at 18, became an announcer with a Canadian Radio Station. He later became a freelance disc jockey and was heard over the air in the USA and Mexico before coming to England. First broadcasting from the Radio Caroline South ship, Don later moved to Radio Caroline North.\n\nDon Allen died in 1995.\n\nMike Allen\n\nBorn and educated in Portsmouth, Mike Allen devoted much of his time to songwriting. In this field, he was very successful – his songs include Skinny Lizzie for Gerry and the Pacemakers, Iceberg and Stablemates for the Mark Murphy album on Fontana and also Mark’s single Broken Heart. He also wrote songs for Screaming Lord Sutch, John L. Watson and the Hummelflugs and many others. Mike first broadcast from Radio Caroline South in 1964, then he left for a short while only to return later to the ship.\n\nSimon Bates\n\nSimon was born in Birmingham but lived in Suffolk until 1954, when he moved to Shropshire. But he had to go to New Zealand to get his first broadcasting experience and worked for a year as a radio actor in Auckland in 1965.\n\nThen, he moved to Wellington for a further three years as a radio and television DJ. He left Wellington for Australia where he worked for the Australian Broadcasting Commission – the down-under equivalent of the BBC, where he divided his time between a weekly arts programme on television and three radio series.\n\nBy 1971 he was back in England and joined the BBC as an announcer and newsreader for Radio 1 and Radio 2 in December. He built up his reputation by presenting Radio 2’s Early Show from March 1974 to January 1976 and also proved his versatility (and availability) by introducing Late Night Extra and Folk 74.\n\nTony Blackburn\n\nBorn at Parkstone, Dorset on 29 January 1943, Tony Blackburn was the first DJ to broadcast on Radio 1 when it launched in September 1967.\n\nHe spent 17 years at the station and also presented Top of the Pops and was a weekly fixture on Noel’s House Party.\n\nPrior to all that, he had broadcast on Radio Caroline and then Radio London.\n\nAfter Radio 1, he was one of the launch presenters on Capital Gold. He has also hosted Radio 2’s Pick Of The Pops as well as regular bank holiday specials for the stations.\n\nPete Brady\n\nBorn in Montreal (Canada) in 1942, Pete Brady first tried his hand at DJ work with Radio Jamaica before coming to Britain and joining Radio London, becoming a regular on the breakfast show.\n\nHe left London quite early on, in 1965, and worked for EMI, presenting their ‘plug’ programmes on Luxembourg, plus undertaking various jobs for the BBC until landing the afternoon slot on Radio 1.\n\nLater he went to Thames Television as one of the original Magpie team, along with Susan Stranks and Tony Bastable.\n\nTony Brandon\n\nA native of Dorset, Brandon broke into broadcasting – after a spell as a journalist and some time on the variety stage as a comedy impressionist – when he read an item in a newspaper about a couple of Disc Jockeys who were leaving Radio Luxembourg.\n\nHe scored himself an audition and landed up in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg as a 208 DJ. After a year on the Continent, he took the plunge and was pressed into service by pirate station Radio London, where he was happier because he had greater control over his own programmes.\n\nFrom there, he went on to the BBC, presenting editions of Midday Spin on Radio 1 as well as deputising for other presenters. In 1970, he began his own daily show Sounds Like Tony Brandon, every weekday afternoon, where he remained until 1971, when he joined Radio 2.\n\nHe moved to commercial radio in the 1980s.\n\nPaul Burnett\n\nPaul Burnett was born into a show business family and attended twelve schools, living mainly in caravans.\n\nHe began broadcasting while serving with the RAF in Aden. He came back to England and worked as a DJ in a Northern disco for five nights a week, buying himself out of the Air Force in 1966 to take a job with one of the pirate stations.\n\nSubsequently, he joined Radio Luxembourg before moving to Radio 1 in 1974, presenting a Sunday morning show and hosting the Top 20 chart programme.\n\nHe and fellow DJ Dave Lee Travis released a parody cover version of U.S. hit Convoy.\n\nFired from Radio 1 in the 1980s, he went to work for Capital Gold.\n\nDave Cash\n\nLondoner Dave Cash acquired his accent after emigrating to Canada when he was sixteen. While in the Great White North, he participated in rodeos, indulged in motor racing and studied acting – though not all at the same time.\n\nSoon after, he took to the microphone and visited Los Angeles and New York before returning to England, where Radio London took him on.\n\nHe was only there for six months, but during that time, his shows with Kenny Everett became a radio legend and were sensibly resuscitated by Radio 1, for whom he first broadcast on 2 October 1967\n\nDave Cash died on 21 October 2016, aged 74.\n\nDave Christian\n\nLong-running Radio Luxembourg DJ with a passion for classic rock and soul music. Presented a popular Sunday show. Left the station in 1975 and joined Radio Victory in Portsmouth. Went on to do stints on radio in the Faroe Islands, Hong Kong and Ireland before returning to work in Luxembourg for Sunshine Radio and Radio Television Luxembourg.\n\nDave retired from radio in 2007 and passed away on 10 July 2010 at the age of 61.\n\nSimon Dee\n\nBorn in Ottawa Canada on 28 July 1935, Simon Dee went to school at Shrewsbury in England. On leaving school, Simon tried his hand at a number of jobs, including that of lorry driver and as a bouncer. His first public appearance was in the ITV play Touch of a Dead Hand.\n\nFor a while, he also worked as a photographer’s assistant with Anthony Armstrong Jones (Lord Snowdon).\n\nA meeting with Ronan O’Rahilly led to Simon Dee becoming a DJ on Radio Caroline when she started broadcasting at Easter 1964. Since leaving Radio Caroline he established a very considerable reputation and became one of Britain’s top spinners of discs.\n\nIn 1967, Dee began his early evening chat show Dee Time on BBC1.\n\nDee died of bone cancer on 29 August 2009, aged 74.\n\nPete Drummond\n\nPete was born in Wales in 1943 and started out to be an actor but was sidetracked into radio in America when he capitalised on being British when British pop was wildly popular in the USA.\n\nHe began broadcasting with Radio London in August 1966 before moving on to the BBC and Radio 1.\n\nNoel Edmonds\n\nEssex-born Edmonds, an ex-public schoolboy, the son of a headmaster, and a student teacher – turned down the chance of going to university for a broadcasting job with Radio Luxembourg in 1968.\n\nWith ten O-levels and four A-levels behind him, he entered the world of showbiz at the tender age of 19. Then he struck it lucky.\n\nJoining the BBC in 1969, his chance to hit the big time came in 1970 when he was picked to take over Kenney Everett’s Sunday morning show, a move which was to make him the youngest regular DJ on Radio 1.\n\nKenny Everett\n\nOne of the great innovators. Kenny Everett (real name Maurice Cole) helped to establish the double-DJ show with Dave Cash on pirate station Radio London (‘Big L’). There, Everett developed the production techniques and tape tomfoolery that he used throughout his career.\n\nThe timid Liverpudlian became electrifying behind the microphone and was envied for his genius as a tape editor, and for his assortment of Goon Show-inspired voices and characters.\n\nEverett also proved vital in establishing Big L’s friendly relationship with The Beatles, travelling with them on their 1966 US tour.\n\nRenowned for his risque remarks and unpredictable behaviour, Everett found himself suddenly out of a job in 1970, after moving to the BBC. There was considerable fudging over the reasons for his on-air dismissal from Radio One.\n\nThe BBC maintained that it was not Everett’s on-air remarks about the transport minister’s wife (he claimed she had passed her driving test only because she had crammed a fiver into her examiner’s hand), but the fact that he had broken his promise not to “speak to the press on controversial broadcasting matters” which got him the boot.\n\nThe sacking did Kenny no harm as he moved to television, where The Kenny Everett Explosion was the first in a long line of snappily-titled shows over the years, including The Kenny Everett Video Show, The Kenny Everett Video Cassette, The Kenny Everett Television Show and a programme called Simply Ev, the name by which friends and colleagues knew him.\n\nEverett passed away on 4 April 1995. He was just 50.\n\nAlan ‘Fluff’ Freeman\n\nBorn in Melbourne, Australia, former-accountant Freeman landed himself a job as summer relief disc jockey on Radio Luxembourg. He made enough of an impression to get himself recruited to the BBC Light Programme as presenter of the Records Around Five show in 1960, where he first introduced his familiar signature tune, At the Sign of the Swinging Cymbal.\n\nIn 1961, Freeman took over Pick of the Pops from David Jacobs on the Light Programme and successfully managed to relegate the musical content to second place with his ebullient presenting manner.\n\nHe also established himself as a regular fixture on TV’s Top of the Pops, having been appointed as one of the original four presenters in 1964. He appeared on film in Julien Temple’s Absolute Beginners (1986), in Dr Terror’s House Of Horrors (1965), and as a DJ in the 1968 Dirk Bogarde vehicle, Sebastian (1968).\n\nFreeman died on 27 November 2006.\n\nDavid Hamilton\n\nDavid Hamilton started his career with the British Forces Broadcasting Service in Germany and when he came to England he became a television announcer in the North-East.\n\nHis brief interjections between programmes were so well received by viewers that they voted him ‘Personality of the Year’.\n\nFollowing a few years in Manchester as an announcer, he was chosen as Ken Dodd‘s straight man in the Doddy’s Magic Box series in 1967 and 1968 (where he became known as “Diddy” David Hamilton) and later starred with Ken in a series called Funny You Should Say That.\n\nAfter sitting in for Jimmy Young on Radio 1 and for Terry Wogan, Peter Murray and Tony Brandon on Radio 2, Hamilton became best known for his weekday radio shows on Radio 1.\n\nStuart Henry\n\nBorn in Edinburgh in 1942, Stuart Henry joined the pirate ship Radio Scotland after a stint at acting. Eventually, he joined the BBC and became known to millions. He left the BBC in 1974 to join Radio Luxembourg, where he remained util 1987.\n\nHe suffered for many years with multiple sclerosis, the illness accounting for his later distinctive rather halting speech delivery. He died on 24 November 1995, aged jut 53.\n\nDavid ‘Kid’ Jensen\n\nDavid Allen Jensen was born in 1950 in Victoria, British Columbia. He began broadcasting in Canada at the age of sixteen presenting, oddly enough, classical music.\n\nLater he joined a pop station in British Columbia and also worked as an announcer on radio and television in Whitehorse, Yukon.\n\nHe was dubbed ‘Kid’ when, at eighteen, he became Radio Luxembourg‘s youngest DJ. He stayed in the Grand Duchy for 6½ years, during which time he was also seen on Granada Television introducing a weekly pop show.\n\nIn May 1975 he was taken on by a commercial station in Nottingham and, just over a year later, moved to Radio 1.\n\nJensen also guest-hosted Top of the Pops, before going to work for US broadcaster CNN. He returned to the UK in the 1980s and worked for Capital Radio.\n\nJanice Long\n\nAfter a stint at BBC Radio Merseyside, Janice Long – elder sister of Swap Shop‘s Keith Chegwin – joined Radio 1 in 1982, making her debut on 4 December with her own Saturday evening show from 7:30 pm to 10 pm.\n\nIn October 1984, she became the first female presenter of a weekday Radio 1 show, taking over the evening slot from David ‘Kid’ Jensen. She also became a regular presenter of Top of the Pops and was the first woman to become a regular host, often presenting in partnership with John Peel.\n\nIn 1989, she joined London station BBC Radio London (then known as Greater London Radio), taking over from Nick Abbot on the breakfast show. Long became involved with XFM in London when it had a Restricted Service Licence, and played a crucial part in its bid for a permanent licence.\n\nIn 1995, she moved back up to Liverpool, where she set up a radio station called Crash FM with Bernie Connor, which eventually successfully bid for a permanent licence on 107.6FM.\n\nIn 1999, Long started appearing on BBC Radio 2, presenting a Saturday afternoon show, and in April 2000, she began as a weekday presenter, hosting the show originally from Birmingham and then from BBC Radio 2 studios in London.\n\nLong left her regular BBC Radio 2 slot after further changes to its schedule, but returned to stand in for Jo Whiley for a week in April 2017 and was given her own series called A Long Walk With . . .\n\nFrom the station’s founding and launch in 2002 to 2004 Long presented “Dream Ticket” on BBC Radio 6 Music and also presented for a time on BBC Radio WM on Saturday mornings from 9 am to noon. In 2017 she began presenting a new evening show on BBC Radio Wales (taking some time away in December 2017 following her brother’s death). Long presented her final show on BBC Radio Wales on 9 December 2021.\n\nShe died at home from pneumonia on Christmas Day 2021, at the age of 66.\n\nJohnny Moran\n\nAfter early radio experience in Melbourne, Australia, Johnny came to Britain in 1963, joining Radio Luxembourg as a staff announcer for two years in 1964 (where he introduced himself as ‘Johnny Moran your music man’).\n\nAfter a lean time, the BBC opened its door to him in 1967, and he was principally responsible for devising Scene and Heard, which embraced news items, a review of the pop press, interviews with pop people in the news and a look at a current LP. The programme suffered over the years from recurrent bouts of rescheduling when it was shunted around the network like a redundant goods train.\n\nHe was later the first voice heard on the new Radio Hallam in Sheffield.\n\nMoran died in September 2022, aged 78.\n\nAnnie Nightingale\n\nAnnie Nightingale was the first female national DJ on BBC Radio 1. She started on 8 February 1970 with a Sunday evening show, and in April, she became one of the hosts of the singles review show What’s New before graduating to a late-night progressive rock show, Sounds of the 70s, with Alan Black, John Peel, Bob Harris, Pete Drummond, and Mike Harding.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s, she presented a Sunday afternoon request show, and in the early 1980s, she presented a Friday night show and the non-music-based Radio 1 Mailbag and Talkabout.\n\nIn 1978, Nightingale became the main presenter of The Old Grey Whistle Test on BBC2 as a replacement for long-time host Bob Harris. During her tenure, the show moved away from its traditional bias under Harris towards country music, blues rock and progressive rock and embraced popular modern styles such as punk rock and new wave. She left the series in 1982.\n\nFrom December 1982, Nightingale hosted The Sunday Request Show – one of the first shows on British radio to regularly play music from CDs. In 1994, she moved to a weekend overnight dance music show called The Chill Out Zone.\n\nIn 2021, Nightingale’s regular weekly Radio 1 show, now in its 52nd year, was moved to an earlier slot, 11 pm on Tuesdays.\n\nAnnie Nightingale was made an MBE in 2002. She died after a brief illness on 11 January 2024 at the age of 83.\n\nJohn Peel\n\nSee John Peel here.\n\nPeter Powell\n\nPeter James Barnard-Powell was born on 24 March 1951 in Stourbridge. His first broadcasting job was for BBC Radio Birmingham in 1970, and he was the first voice to be heard on that station on its launch day.\n\nPowell had a brief stint on Radio 1 in 1972, before joining Radio Luxembourg for several years. He returned to Radio 1 in 1977. In the same year, he made his first appearance as a presenter on Top Of The Pops.\n\nAfter 11 years at the station, Powell left Radio 1 on 25 September 1988.\n\nTony Prince\n\nBorn in Oldham in 1946, Tony Prince had been an apprentice tool-maker and the singer and guitarist with a Manchester group called The Jasons before he became a TV personality, eventually joining Radio Caroline North in December 1965.\n\nKnown to listeners as Tony ‘Your Royal Ruler’ Prince, he went on to become programme director of Radio Luxembourg. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he missed out on a gig at Radio 1. Instead, he launched dance magazine Mixmag, which was later sold to Emap for £9 million.\n\nMike Raven\n\nMike was born Austin Churton Fairman in London in 1924. He was the son of the actress Hilda Moore. Before becoming a DJ he had been a photographer, a flamenco guitarist and an interior decorator and his first experience with offshore radio was when he joined Radio Atlanta in 1964, which shortly merged with Radio Caroline.\n\nHe achieved nationwide fame in 1967 as one of the first disc jockeys to broadcast on Radio 1‘s launch day and his 30-minute Sunday night The Mike Raven Blues Show soon became a two-hour slot. His appealingly diffident delivery was backed up by a comprehensive knowledge of his subject and he built up a faithful audience over the\n\nyears.\n\nLeaving radio in 1971, Raven went on to appear in several horror films, including Crucible of Terror (1971) and Disciple of Death (1972).\n\nHe died on 4 April 1997 and was buried in a grave he had dug for himself on Bodmin Moor.\n\nMike Read\n\nKnown for his lustrous hair and cheesy voice, his career soared after leaving Radio Luxembourg. Snapped up by Radio 1 where he hosted the breakfast show.\n\nRead famously banned Frankie Goes To Hollywood‘s song Relax from his show in 1984 because he felt the lyrics were obscene. He also hosted Top of the Pops and Saturday Superstore on television. His play Oscar Wilde: The Musical was panned by critics and closed in the West End after one night in 2004.\n\nEmperor Rosko\n\nReal name Michael Joseph Pasternak, the son of the famous Hollywood producer Joe Pasternak launched his DJ career in the US Navy, joining Radio Caroline and Luxembourg before moving to the BBC in 1967.\n\nHe was famed for his pacy banter, outlandish dress sense and quirky sense of humour, and described himself as “the Emperor, the geeter with the heater, your leader, your groovy host from the West coast, here to clear up your skin and mess up your mind. It’ll make you feel good all over.”\n\nOn the opening day of Radio 1, his over-the-top American style prompted newsreader John Dunn to announce, “Now here is the news – in English”.\n\nRosko returned to the US in the 1970s before returning to Europe and Radio 1 in 1982. He also worked for Capital Gold and Virgin.\n\nJimmy Savile\n\nJimmy left school at 14 to take an office job before becoming a coal-face worker in the mines.\n\nAn accident at the colliery put paid to mining and Jimmy decided to enter the world of showbiz.\n\nAs a disc jockey, he began his career by touring local dance halls with borrowed records and a record player.\n\nFrom these beginnings, he went on to become arguably the most famous DJ on British radio and a ubiquitous television personality.\n\nAfter his death in 2011, hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse were made against him, leading the police to believe that Savile had been a predatory sex offender – possibly one of Britain’s most prolific.\n\nEd Stewart\n\nBorn in Devon in 1941 and brought up in Wimbledon, Ed “Stewpot” Stewart was supposed to have a secure job when he left school playing double bass in a jazz band in Hong Kong – but when he got there, there was no band, no job, no friends – he was stranded.\n\nLuckily, he was stranded outside the office of a local radio station, so he went in and asked for a job. For the next four years, he was their sports commentator, film critic, disc jockey and tea-maker. When he got homesick, he did a radio commercial for an airline company in exchange for a flight home to England.\n\nIn July 1965, he joined Radio London and became their chief DJ, eventually ending up at the BBC, signing up with Radio 1 in 1967. In addition to hosting Junior Choice (which had as many as 16 million listeners), Ed also made many TV appearances, including Top of the Pops and Crackerjack.\n\nFor many years, Stewart was the figurehead for the children’s magazine Look-in, billed as the “Junior TV Times“.\n\nStewpot passed away on 9 January 2016 after suffering a major stroke. He was 74.\n\nDave Lee Travis\n\nBorn in Buxton, Derbyshire, on 25 May 1945, Dave Lee Travis began his career spinning discs at the Oasis Club in Manchester on a part-time basis.\n\nProving extremely popular, DLT went on an extensive tour of clubs, ballrooms and theatres presenting and promoting his own shows with the aid of his specially built stereophonic record player system.\n\nHe was asked by Herman to accompany The Hermits on their American tour. This led to radio and TV broadcasts in many states and on his return to Britain he continued to promote his own shows in Blackpool, Bury and surrounding areas.\n\nDLT joined Radio Caroline in September 1965 and broadcast from the Southern ship. He was on board when the ship ran aground during gales.\n\nHe also co-presented the German music television show Beat Club.\n\nFrom Caroline, he went back to Manchester and began his Radio 1 career by presenting Pop North, gradually extending his experience until the advent of his first daily show in 1971. He made many appearances on Top Of The Pops, and in 1976, he got together with Paul Burnett and – under the name Laurie Lingo and the Dipsticks – made a record called Convoy GB, which was a big hit in the Radio 1 Fun Thirty.\n\nOn 8 August 1993, Travis resigned on-air during his Sunday morning show, stating that he could not agree with changes that were being made to Radio 1.\n\nIn October 2013, Travis was charged with 14 allegations of indecent assault and one of sexual assault between 1976 and 2008, relating to 11 female complainants. He was found not guilty on twelve counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on the remaining two counts.\n\nJohnnie Walker\n\nBirmingham-born Walker began his DJ career at the age of 20, working in ballrooms in his home town. During his time as a ballroom DJ, he also worked during the day as a car salesman but decided to become a disc jockey full-time.\n\nHe left his salesman’s job and three days later was with Swinging Radio England (after failing an audition with Radio Luxembourg). After an 18-month stint, he switched ships to Radio Caroline South in October 1966 – and on his late-night show, organised his “Kiss in the Car” spot for which a vast number of his fans were “licenced” to take part – before eventually joining the BBC in April 1969.\n\nA year later, Walker presented a one-hour weekday morning slot, moving to the weekday early afternoon show in 1971.\n\nIn 1976, Walker had a dispute with station management over the music he played, which didn’t fit the station’s daytime music line-up. He was also reprimanded for criticising The Bay City Rollers – then at the height of their popularity – on air, describing them as “musical garbage”. As a result, he left Radio 1 for a while and moved to the United States, where he stayed for five years with radio stations KSAN in San Francisco, KPFA in Berkeley, California, and WHFS in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nHe returned to the UK and rejoined Radio 1 in 1987. Walker told listeners in June 2003 that he was suffering from cancer and ended his show by explaining he was beginning treatment and would be taking time off to recover.\n\nMark Wesley\n\nMark started out at Radio Essex, eventually moving to Radio Luxembourg, where he stayed as a presenter for ten years. He left in 1981 and went on to work on local radio and Capital Gold before moving into television and radio production.\n\nTerry Wogan\n\nA one-time bank clerk, Terry Wogan joined the BBC in the 1960s and was one of Radio 1‘s original team of presenters in 1967. His Radio 2 breakfast show in the 1970s and early 1980s gained him a cult following and established his distinctively witty, self-effacing presentational style.\n\nItems like “Fighting the Flab” and “Wogan’s Winner” characterised the show, and his constant digs at Dallas ensured that the soap became a hit in the UK.\n\nHis TV career took off in 1979 when he began five years at the helm of Blankety Blank, and in 1980 he turned his hand to chat shows with What’s On Wogan?, a live Saturday tea-time programme.\n\nTwo years later, the show metamorphosed into Wogan and was transmitted late on Saturday nights, before being promoted in 1985 to being a thrice-weekly early evening live event. Terry quickly became the television personality of the 1980s and was seldom off British screens.\n\nTerry Wogan died of cancer on 31 January 2016 at the age of 77.\n\nSteve Wright\n\nBorn in Greenwich, South London, Wright was raised in New Cross. He started broadcasting in 1976 at Thames Valley Radio Radio 210 in Reading, Berkshire, alongside Mike Read. In 1979 Wright got his big break at Radio Luxembourg, where he presented his own nightly show, presenting a Saturday evening show, then Saturday morning.\n\nIn 1980, Wright joined BBC Radio 1, taking over a Saturday evening slot before moving to Saturday mornings later that year. He began presenting Steve Wright in the Afternoon in 1981. Wright moved to The Radio 1 Breakfast Show in 1994 but resigned in 1995 due to differences with Radio 1 management.\n\nAfter a spell in commercial radio, he joined BBC Radio 2 in March 1996, where he began presenting Steve Wright’s Saturday Show and Steve Wright’s Sunday Love Songs. Steve Wright in the Afternoon was revived in 1999 and ran until 2022. He became the new host of Pick of the Pops in October 2023.\n\nWright received an MBE in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to radio. He died on 12 February 2024, aged 69.\n\nJimmy Young\n\nJimmy was born in Cinderford and was originally a singer with a number of hit records to his credit, including Too Young, Unchained Melody and The Man From Laramie. He was booked for was a two-week stint on Housewives Choice, which proved to be a turning point in his career and he began to develop as a DJ.\n\nYoung became a mainstay of Radio 1 until he transferred to the rarified atmosphere of Radio 2 in 1973. Like all popular broadcasters, he soon became the butt of comedians everywhere with distinctive catchphrases like “TTT” (“through ’til twelve”) and “Orft we jolly well go”. As well as filling the nation’s ears with cheery chat and merry music, he also filled the stomachs of his “MMMMFs” (many millions of mid-morning friends) with an avalanche of recipes which spawned several JY cookery books.\n\nJimmy Young died on 7 November 2016, aged 95."
