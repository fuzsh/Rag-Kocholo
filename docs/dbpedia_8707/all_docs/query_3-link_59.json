Harris claims, land use and zoning disputes, as well as real estate related commercial and partnership litigation. He has successfully represented property owners in many difficult and novel cases, at both the trial and appellate levels.\n\nMike has handled hundreds of eminent domain cases, and has achieved significant benefits for clients, for instance:\n\nHe helped a Pinellas County property owner receive full compensation of $3,713,000, which was an increase of $2,058,675 over the first written offer of $1,654,325;\n\nHe defeated the government's taking of an entire 50,000 sq. fort warehouse from a Broward County property owner, where only part of the warehouse was necessary for a road project;\n\nHe helped negotiate a settlement of $300,000 for a Leon County property owner, which was 150 times the condemning authority's first written offer of $2,000.\n\nMike represents a broad spectrum of clients, ranging from large national companies to local Florida companies and individual property owners and tenants, including gas stations, shopping centers, doctor's offices, churches, sand mines, and homeowners."
