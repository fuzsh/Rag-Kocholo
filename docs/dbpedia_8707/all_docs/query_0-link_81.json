        "text": "Channing Tatum\n\nConceived and Directed By\n\nChanning Tatum has established himself as a leading actor and filmmaker.\n\nTatum and his two business partners, Reid Carolin and Peter Kiernan, founded their production company, Free Association, in 2014. They are currently in post-production on DOG, which Tatum co-directed with Carolin. The script was written by Carolin based upon a story by Carolin & Brett Rodriguez. The film is a road-trip comedy that tracks two hard-charging former Army Rangers paired against their will; Briggs (Tatum), and Lulu (a Belgian Malinois), as they race down the Pacific Coast in hopes of making it to a fellow soldier's funeral on time. Along the way, they’ll drive each other completely crazy, confront the possibility that pet psychics are real, and begin to reckon with the one thing they were trained never to do: surrender. MGM will release the film domestically in 2021 while FilmNation will handle the international rights.\n\nHe will also star in an UNTITLED MONSTER PROJECT, which Free Association will produce alongside Phil Lord and Chris Miller. Reid Carolin had the original idea for the project and wrote the treatment. Wes Took is writing the script based on Carolin’s treatment.\n\nMost recently, the Free Association team served as producers on Sony’s FATHERHOOD, starring Kevin Hart. They are in pre-production on SPACEMAN OF BOHEMIA for Netflix, with Adam Sandler starring and Johan Renck directing. They are also producing GORILLA AND THE BIRD for HBO, directed by Jean Marc Vallée, Netflix’s first animated film AMERICA: THE MOTION PITCTURE, and NEW YORK WILL EAT YOU ALIVE with STXFilm and Tencent Pictures, starring Colin Firth. Free Association has produced box office hit franchises including 21 JUMPSTREET, and MAGIC MIKE, as well as Steven Soderbergh’s LOGAN LUCKY, HBO’s WAR DOG and Amazon’s original series COMRADE DETECTIVE.\n\nTatum and Free Association also produce Magic Mike Live worldwide. The production launched in Las Vegas in 2016 and has since opened in London and Berlin and soon to open in Australia. The London production ranks in the top ten shows of all time for advanced ticket sales on West End.\n\nTatum’s recent film credits include Fox’s film KINGSMAN 2: THE GOLDEN CIRCLE (2017) alongside Taron Egerton, Julianne Moore, Colin Firth and Halle Berry.\n\nIn 2016, Tatum was seen in the Coen brothers’ film HAIL, CAESAR! alongside George Clooney, Scarlett Johansson, Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton and Jonah Hill.\n\nIn 2015 Tatum starred in Quentin Tarantino’s critically-acclaimed film THE HATEFUL EIGHT.\n\nAlso in 2015, he starred in the highly anticipated sequel, MAGIC MIKE XXL, which was written by Reid Carolin and directed by Greg Jacobs. The initial MAGIC MIKE was directed by Steven Soderbergh and released in 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Tatum received critical praise for his starring role in Sony Pictures Classics’ acclaimed and Golden Globe nominated film, FOXCATCHER. The film was directed by Bennett Miller and also starred Mark Ruffalo and Steve Carell. The film is based on the true story of John du Pont, the paranoid schizophrenic heir to the du Pont chemical fortune, who built a wrestling training facility called Team Foxcatcher on his Pennsylvania estate and murdered Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz. Tatum portrays Dave’s brother, Mark Schultz.\n\nAlso in 2014, Tatum reprised his role as ‘Jenko’ in the blockbuster hit sequel 22 JUMP STREET, opposite Jonah Hill and directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord. The film grossed over $234 million worldwide. The first film, 21 JUMP STREET, released in 2012 and brought in $200 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2012, Tatum starred opposite Rachel McAdams in Michael Sucsy’s film THE VOW. The Sony Pictures film earned $197 million worldwide and is the highest-grossing film for Sony Screen Gems.\n\nIn 2010, Tatum starred opposite Amanda Seyfried in the Sony Screen Gems’, DEAR JOHN, based on the adaptation of the Nicolas Sparks bestseller. Lasse Hallstrom directed the adapted script by Jamie Linden. The film made $142 million worldwide and is Screen Gems’ third highest film to date.\n\nIn the start of his career, in 2006, Tatum received an Independent Spirit nomination and a Gotham Award nomination for his powerful role in the independent film, A GUIDE TO RECOGNIZING YOUR SAINTS, which won the Special Jury Prize for Best Ensemble Performance as well as the dramatic directing award for Dito Montiel at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nTatum currently resides in Los Angeles.\n\nTheophilus O. Bailey\n\nTheophilus O. Bailey is a British dancer, movement director, choreographer and actor of Jamaican and Nigerian descent who has been pioneering the dance style Krump in the UK for well over 15 years now. An alumni member of Associate Artists at the Barbican, Boy Blue.\n\nBetter known for his stage and performance name 'Godson', Theophilus has also danced and choreographed for FKA Twigs, Fergie, Giggs, Swizz Beatz, Dua Lipa and Little Mix, among others.\n\nHe was movement director for Jacob Banks ‘Parade’ music video.\n\nTheophilus continues to choreograph and movement direct.

He also has worked with Kenrick ‘H20’ Sandy as an Assistant Dance Captain and performer for the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics and also one of the original cast members of the Laurence Olivier award nominated Blak Whyte Gray, which continues to tour internationally.\n\nAdditionally, Theophilus has now branched out into the acting world and made his debut in Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike’s Last Dance starring Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek.\n\nJake Brewer\n\nJake Brewer was born and raised in South East London where he originally set out to follow his Dad’s footsteps into the draughtsmen trade, but fell into acting and then found dancing at the age of 16.\n\nHe trained at Bird College before getting his first job performing with Carnival Cruise Lines, sailing around the Bahamas and Caribbean for months which was a dream. When he got back on land, he danced for Bananarama and new artist Lewis Capaldi in his Grace video, as well as modelling for Lululemon, Fairfax, Favour and most notably for Adidas as a body double for Gareth Bale.\n\nWhenever he can, he jets off to Sweden to see his family and to get away from the hustle and bustle that comes with life in London. But as much as he's a city boy, he feels most at peace when he's in the sun and near the sea. Especially if he can scuba dive or snorkel, anything to get him in the water.\n\nHe's also a massive Marvel fan so if you have anything to say superhero related, he's your man. Forever hopeful that radioactive spiders exist 🕷🕸\n\nMarina Toybina\n\nCostume Designer\n\nCostume Designer Marina Toybina has been an integral part of painting the landscape of pop culture for over a decade\n\nA look behind the scenes of many of the biggest pop acts of our time, would reveal a four-time Emmy Award-winning costume designer, Marina Toybina.
