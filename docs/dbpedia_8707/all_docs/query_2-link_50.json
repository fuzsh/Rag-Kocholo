        "text": "Michael Gray Born May 2, 1928 in Cornwall, England, peacefully at rest on November 20, 2004 in Lafayette. His quiet, loving devotion to family was instilled by his adopted mother, Mrs. Cousins. Beloved husband and father, he is survived by his wife Kathy; sons Morgan and Brett; daughter Alison; twin brother Roger and extended family in England. Michael immigrated to Canada as a longshoreman, eventually relocating to the States and starting his own masonry business. Michael exemplified the true English gentleman, with his quiet refinement and love of history, poetry, and literature. His soft-spoken-ness and good nature endeared him to those he met. An avid tennis and bridge player, Michael made a point of being physically and mentally active throughout his life. He loved animals, races horses in particular; being outdoors; and the occasional cat-nap. He was blessed later in life to have fourteen wonderful years with Kathy, enjoying his life in Carmel and Lafayette and their many adventures traveling the world. In lieu of flowers, the family requests remembrances be sent to the Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Foundation, 710 West 168th Street, Third Floor, New York, NY 10032 or the charity of your choice."
