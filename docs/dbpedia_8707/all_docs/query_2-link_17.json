        "text": "Michael Anthony Gray was born July 15, 1956, to the late Perry Gray Sr. and Shirley (Mashatt) Gray in Ypsilanti, Michigan. He was raised in the \"Sub\" and attended Romulus Community Schools until graduating in 1975. He was a member of the cross country and basketball teams.\n\nMichael married his high school sweetheart, LaJuan (Thomas) Gray, on March 22, 1980. He enjoyed riding bikes around the neighborhood with her, having their date nights and attending concerts and festivals. From their union they had three children: Myron, Jerome, and Tiffany.\n\nMichael was gainfully employed at General Motors Corp. at the Hydramatic plant in Willow Run. He retired in January 2011 after 35 years of service.\n\nThe simplest pleasures in life brought great joy to Michael. He loved spending time with his family, grilling, going to the movies to watch the latest action/karate films, having Uno game competitions (although he usually won) and playing dominos at family events.\n\nHe had an uncanny ability to master things he was interested in; airbrushing, drawing, building and racing his many RC and slot cars on his racetrack. He looked forward to his annual trips to Myrtle Beach for bike week and riding around on his motorcycle. He was known for tinkering with things around the house, tending to his perfectly manicured lawn and being \"Mr. Fix It\".\n\nIn the early morning of April 15, 2024, at the age of 67, Michael gained his wings after a courageous battle with cancer with loved ones by his side.\n\nMichael was preceded in death by his parents. He is survived by his wife of 44 years, LaJuan Gray of Romulus, MI; their children: Myron Gray of Romulus, MI; Jerome Gray of New York, NY; Tiffany Gray of Austin, TX and one granddaughter: Gia Gray of Canton, MI\n\nHe leaves behind siblings; Alvin Gray, Perry Jr. (Youdora) Gray, Joyce (Nate) Davis, Sheila (Troy) Jewell, Tareia (Darwin Sr.) Harris, Priscilla (Reginald*) Bell, Spencer Gray, Tina (Richard Jr.*) Greene, Troy (Holly) Gray, and Prince (Jaimie) Gray.\n\nMichael shared a special relationship with his Uncle Dot who he enjoyed talking on the phone and spending time with at family gatherings. He leaves behind a host of nieces, nephews, cousins and friends. Forever loved, forever missed and forever in our hearts!"
