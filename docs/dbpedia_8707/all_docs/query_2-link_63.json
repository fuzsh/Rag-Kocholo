        "meta_description": "ROCKLAND - Michael Sean Gray born June 17th 1976 unexpectedly passed away at his home at the age of 39.  Michael had a long battle with Hodgkins Lymphoma.  Michael is predeceased by his mother Alice Jeanette Gray and his father Calvin Albert Gray.  He is survived by his sister Sheri A. Gray of Rockland and his brother John A. Gray of Warren, and many nieces, nephews, and cousins.   Michael attended Thomaston schools and later managed his fatherâ€™s business.  Michael enjoyed hanging with his friends, taking road trips and spending time with his beloved girlfriend Jocelyn.  Michael was diagnosed with lymphoma 6 years ago and fought so hard but stayed positive.  We would like to give extended thanks to anyone that supported him.  There is a memorial fund set up to aid in funeral costs if you would like to donate.  The fund is set up through gofundme.com (Michael Gray Funeral Fund).  A service will be held at a later date.  To share a memory or condolence with his family, please visit his Book of Memories at www.bchfh.com.    Arrangements are in the care of Burpee, Carpenter & Hutchins Funeral Home, 110 Limerock Street, Rockland.",
