        "text": "Good looks and a couple of television roles helped to give actor Michael Gray many years in between and on the covers of Tiger Beat magazine. Born in Chicago, Michael moved to Florida when he was a young boy.\n\nHe caught the acting bug in high school, and eventually made his way to Hollywood. In 1972, Michael won the role of Ronnie on the NBC series The Little People, a charming sitcom that starred Brian Keith as a pediatrician with a practice on Oahu, Hawaii. The series was reworked for the second season and retitled The Brian Keith Show, and Michael was let go.\n\nSigned to a management deal with Charles Laufer, pubisher of \"Tiger Beat,\" Michael was able to keep a high profile while rounding up other acting roles. Michael's second series came in 1974, when he was cast in his signature role, as Billy Batson on the Saturday morning series Shazam. The series ran for 3 years but was then cancelled due to increasing production costs.\n\nSome of Michael's other credits include:\n\nLife with Father Entertainment Tonight\n\nRoom 222 MTV's - I Love the 70's\n\nThe Brady Bunch E Television, Life After Stardom\n\nMarcus Welby M.D. The Rretro Radio Live Show\n\nThe Flying Nun VH1 - Superheros, Where Are\n\nDynasty They Now?\n\nAlthough Michael Gray had all the tools one would expect to be necessary to build a sturdy career, due to type casting it became harder for him to make\n\na living at his craft.\n\nThe ever youthful Michael Gray is happily married and living in Northern California. He is currently writing a book about his life in Hollywood.\n\nLinks\n\nFacebook Fan Page\n\nFacebook Page"
