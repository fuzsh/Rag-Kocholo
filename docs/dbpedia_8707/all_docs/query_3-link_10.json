This is a place where the music and artist is celebrated in the true spirit of its birth and continued growth.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to feel that you are connected to the world we write about. There is no hiding from the fact that we only represent what we see and we will not spin it for the sake of a dollar. We are all about the truth and will never let the reader down by telling you something we cannot stand behind. After all. We are You!!\n\nWe are a rag tag bag of contributors who do this for the love. 30 years with skin in the game is a lifetime of stories to be told. Head office is in Australia so we will feature local artists as well as internationals. Peace. Love. Beats."
