        "text": "Michael Gray is a major protagonist turned final antagonist of Peaky Blinders, serving as a supporting character in Season 2, one of the main characters of Season 3 and Season 4, the secondary antagonist of Season 5, and one of the main antagonists of Season 6 (along with Oswald Mosley). He is the son of Polly Gray and the cousin of the Shelby siblings.\n\nHe was taken away from Polly at a young age and was raised by his adoptive mother. After Thomas learns about Polly's wish to find her children again, he pays Michael's foster family a visit and invites the boy to see his biological mother. Michael reunites with his mother and becomes part of the Shelby Family and the Peaky Blinders at the age of 17, starting out on the respectable and legal side of the family business, Shelby Company Limited.\n\nCharacter History[]\n\n\"No one close to you makes a choice without your opinion, Tom. Not Arthur, not me, not Ada. We can’t escape you. Your lethal hand is always on our shoulders.\"\n\nMichael Gray’s final words to Thomas Shelby\n\nBackground[]\n\nMichael's father died drunk, killed between a boat and a dock, when he was young, so he doesn't remember him. He has a deceased sister named Anna Gray.\n\nMichael and Anna were taken from their mother Polly by the parish authorities, in part due to the intervention of a neighbor. Michael was five years old. He was adopted by the Johnson family, and grew up on their Kentish farm. His adoptive parents called him \"Henry Johnson.\"\n\nSeries 2 · 1922[]\n\nThomas Shelby finds Michael, who is now seventeen years old, and goes to his foster family's home. He speaks with Michael's foster mother, Rosemary Johnson. Michael comes to Birmingham to reconnect with Polly, his birth mother, and because he's bored with his life in a tiny village.\n\nMichael is slowly introduced to the Shelby family, under the careful watch of his mother, who wants to keep him out of the family's true business. He heads to the races with cousins Thomas, John, Arthur, and Finn when Thomas goes to buy a horse. When Thomas's life is threatened, Michael witnesses one of Arthur's violent outbursts where he nearly beats a man to death. Later, when Polly asks Michael how the trip went, Michael does not inform her of Arthur's actions.\n\nMichael gets into a bar fight at the Marquis of Lorne when a man refuses to be in the same bar as his friend Isaiah because he is black. Later, when Michael tells Arthur what happened, John and Arthur destroy the pub in the name of the Shelby family.\n\nAfterwards, Michael and Arthur are imprisoned by Major Campbell for the burning of the pub. Later, Michael hears from the guards that he's being released because Polly had sex with Campbell in return, something Michael finds hard to forgive.\n\nLater, Polly offers Michael money to move to London, away from the Shelby family. They say “I love you” to each other before Polly goes to kill Campbell. Tommy, in his final confrontation with Campbell, implies that Campbell had Michael raped in prison. In the end, Michael stays, because he thinks Polly truly wants him to, and because he wants to make \"real money\" with Thomas.\n\nSeries 3 · 1924[]\n\nMichael is now comfortable in his role as an accountant for Shelby Company Limited, becoming more confident and daring and not afraid to be harsh to get the job done. He has a short affair with Charlotte Murray, a guest at Grace and Thomas' wedding. Charlotte is introduced to Thomas later in Michael's office.\n\nWhile Thomas is in the hospital recovering from Father John Hughes's beating, Michael tells him he \"knows things\" about the priest, and offers to kill Hughes himself if Thomas allows it. Michael was abused by Father Hughes during his short time in foster care.\n\nMichael gets Charlotte pregnant, and John and Arthur tell him he needs to “marry the girl.” When Michael tells them that Charlotte doesn't want to keep the baby, John tells him about a woman who has aborted two babies from women Arthur impregnated. Michael arranges the abortion.\n\nFinding the bullet meant for Father Hughes in Michael's desk, Polly confronts Thomas about Michael doing the hit. Thomas tells her that Michael asked him to; although he is discreet about the reason he infers that Michael was sexually abused. Thomas tells her he told Michael to \"put a bullet in that fucker's head.\" Polly composes herself and says that if Michael kills the priest, she will bring the whole organization down.\n\nWhen the Grace Shelby Institute is opened, Father Hughes orders Thomas to bring the children to his office so he can bring them to confession. As he walks away from Thomas, Michael enters the hall and stares at him, aghast, before the priest enters a room with a gaggle of children.\n\nMichael kills the man who came with Alfie Solomons during Alfie and Thomas' meeting, to protect Thomas. He later tells John and Arthur that Thomas said he handled it well, so they allow him and two others to go to the house where Charles Shelby is being held. Arthur tells the two men to kill the priest, but outside the house Michael orders them to stand down. Michael draws on Hughes but hesitates to shoot, and a fight ensues. Michael gains the upper hand and plunges his knife into Hughes' neck, and brings Charlie home to Ada and Polly. Polly notices the blood on Michael's face and hands, and Michael walks away, still in shock.\n\nAfter leaving Charles with the women, Michael meets with Charlotte at the abortion house. She asks where he's been, and he tells her there was trouble and he can't stay. She begs him to, but he says it’s family business, pays the abortionist, and leaves.\n\nMichael is arrested with the rest of the family, charged with the murder of Father John Hughes.\n\nSeries 4 · 1925[]\n\nBefore the show shifts forward in time by two years, Michael, along with John and Arthur, are seen in prison. As guards from the prison enter Michael's cell, he asks to see his lawyer, but they are sent to be hanged for their crimes despite an appeal. They are saved at the last minute when Thomas makes a deal with a politician.\n\nIn 1925, Michael, now with a cocaine habit, is still in his role as chief accountant of Shelby Company Ltd, after Polly, John, and Arthur have all left. The Shelby Company seems to run on Michael keeping each aspect in balance. He serves as the primary form of communication between Thomas in London, the Birmingham enterprises, Ada in Boston, and the scattered family members. He acts as the neutral party between Thomas and Polly. He keeps his position as second in command of the business while also personally caring for Polly. Michael informs Thomas of Jessie Eden, who is upset about the women’s pay in one of their businesses. Thomas changes the subject to Polly, asking Michael how she’s doing. Michael explains that neither he nor his mother have been doing very well since the incident at the prison, and that is why he feels the need to have the cocaine.\n\nMichael visits Polly’s house and attempts to subtly confront her about her strange behavior, but she catches on and becomes irritated. Ada visits and tells them that Thomas has called a family meeting to discuss the “Black Hands” they have all received.\n\nThomas calls Michael and explains the situation with the Italian gang; he tells him to drop off Polly and Ada at Charlie's Yard before informing John and Esme of the situation. When he is discussing what to do with John, they are ambushed by mafiosos, killing John and badly injuring Michael.\n\nPolly visits Michael in hospital after hearing that surgery was successful and he will live. She tells him that she wants them to move to Australia together, where they can get away from the Italians. Michael tells her that she needs to \"get better,\" in order to help Thomas so they don’t all get killed.\n\nSometime later, Michael's adoptive mother, Rosemary Johnson, visits him in the hospital, to tell him that he can come back to their home at any time, and that his adoptive dad passed away.\n\nPolly meets with Luca Changretta, and seemingly makes a deal that if Luca does not kill Michael, Charlie, or Arthur, she will set up a way for him to get to Thomas. Later, having distracted the family, Luca shows up at the hospital and holds a gun to Michael's face, but pulls the trigger on an empty chamber. He tells Michael to let Polly know they have a deal. When Tommy and the others show up, Michael tells them that Luca heard them coming and ran away; later, Michael presses Polly to tell him about the deal, which she does.\n\nLater, when Thomas visits Michael, he tells Michael that Polly has arranged for him to go to an event alone; Michael realises this is Polly's set-up, and struggles to decide whether to warn Tommy; in the end, he decides not to tell Tommy. Finally, the true nature of the plan is revealed: Polly's betrayal was a fake to set up Luca for Tommy. However, Luca survives the ambush, and so Polly sends Michael away with a family of Gypsies to keep him safe.\n\nAfter the Changrettas are taken down, Michael returns to meet with Tommy, Polly, and Ada. Despite the plan being a ruse, Tommy is upset with Michael for not warning him about it, since as far as he knew, he was letting Tommy die. Michael says that he did it to protect his mother. Tommy exiles Michael to New York , still keeping him part of the business to expand into America, but his trust, once held in high regard, in Michael is now completely gone.\n\nSeries 5 · 1929[]\n\nMichael returns to Small Heath following the Wall St. Crash in 1929. Despite being warned by Tommy to sell before the crash, he didn't listen and held on, losing Shelby Company Limited huge profits as a result. During his time in Detroit, he met and began a relationship with Gina Gray, who returns to Small Heath with him, and whom he marries en route as she is pregnant with his child. Michaels ship stops in Belfast and the IRA call Tommy with Michael in the room claiming that Michael is plotting against him with a rival gang from Glasgow, the Billy Boys which Michael denies. When he arrives in Birmingham it's made clear that he's untrusted, he's questioned in the street by Polly, insulted and taunted by Arthur, and then made to stay under \"quarantine\" surveillance at a hotel until it is definitively proven he is not a traitor. Tommy keeps Michael at arms length in the family business having had a dream about a black cat and convinced Michael is trying to take his \"throne.\" It becomes clear the Shelbys no longer consider him family or even part of the gang as Tommy continues to degrade and humiliate Michael with Arthur and the gang following suit. Tommy does not trust Gina either seeing her as potential trouble due to her hold on Michael and her manipulative nature. Michael tells Tommy that the two of them will be done by the time his baby draws its first breath and implies that Tommys trauma has driven him crazy. Tommy makes an agreement with Polly to end Michael's quarantine and let him back into the business on his latest Shelby Company venture, the import and export of opium which would allow them to recover at least half of what Michael lost in the Wall Street Crash.\n\nAt a family meeting Michael reveals a new plan he's formulated, with Gina manipulating him, to expand Shelby Company Limited in the US, restructuring the company with him in charge, Gina's family handling distribution in America and Tommy and the rest of the family, except Finn, cashing cheques from retirement with no involvement with the company. Tommy rebukes him and throws Michael's proposal into the fireplace. Gina pushes Michael to reveal the real reason he should head the company is because the US no longer wish to deal with the Peaky Blinders. Arthur growls, \"Fuck the Americans,\" Tommy says he gave Michael an opportunity to redeem himself but instead he's betrayed him. Thomas banishes Michael and Gina from the family. Polly slaps Michael then gives Gina a cold stare knowing Gina has put the idea in Michael's head. While alone Gina suggests they will have to take over the business themselves. Arthur later admits to Tommy that he is struggling with the gang life and perhaps they should get out and \"leave it to the kids.\" To which Tommy refuses. While they're alone, Polly tells Tommy she's had a premonition that there will be a war between Michael and him and one of them will die, though she doesn't know which. She hasn't overtly picked a side but hands Tommy her resignation from the company.\n\nSeries 6 - 1933-1934[]\n\nAfter Polly is murdered by the IRA, Michael is devastated, reasoning that Tommy's ambition and schemes lead to her death. He swears revenge on Tommy at all costs. By 1933 Michael is completely estranged from the Shelby family and has moved to the US where he now has a son with Gina name Laurence. Despite their mutual animosity, Thomas includes Michael in his latest Shelby Company venture, the import and export of opium. After being framed by Thomas and thrown in prison, Michael is eventually released thanks to Gina's uncle Jack Nelson. Michael sets up his plan to kill Thomas by blowing him up with a car bomb. Gina suggest killing Tommy's son Charlie Shelby and his recently discovered son Duke Shelby but Michael disagrees only Tommy and Arthur need to die since they don't kill children, Duke is the Illgitiment son and its unnecessary for there to be a bloodbath.\n\nUnknown to Michael, Tommy had predicted Michael would try to kill him and had Johnny Dogs switch the car bombs. Michael fakes leaving his cigarettes in the bar where he sits down and waits for the car to blow Tommy up. There is an explosion and Michael thinks he has finally killed Tommy. Michael then walk out and sees his associates car in flames and Tommy unharmed in the other car. Michael realises his plan has failed and he is about to die, Michael and Thomas are left facing each other one last time before Michael berates Tommy one last time about Polly's murder and that nobody can escape his lethal hand. Thomas says Polly visits him in his dream but she will no longer now before finally shooting Michael in the head killing Michael instantly and ending the traitorous snake as a threat and thus, Polly's prophecy's was fulfilled that one of them will die. Tommy then says to Michael's corpse he has 'No Limitations' before walking off. It is unknown if Gina is informed of his death and likely that Tommy just left Michael's corpse to rot and his associates car to burn.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWhen Michael first arrives in Birmingham from the Kentish farm of his adoptive family, he's a fresh and seemingly wholesome young man. Michael jumps at the chance to be a Shelby once he's returned to the family. He detests the suburban life and wants something more exciting than the little village where he grew up. At first, Michael is entirely focused on making the Shelby business legitimate. He's diligent and serious, and Thomas makes him a trainee accountant. On his first night out with Isiah Jesus, Michael learns learns the power of being Polly Shelby's son, drinks his first whisky, smokes his first cigarette, experiences the adrenaline of violence, and realises the importance of maintaining a fearsome reputation and showing no mercy. While visibly taken aback by the grimness of Birmingham, he remains stoic in the face of violence. However, when he does crack, he's just as angry and remorseless as the rest of the Shelbys. While getting drunk with John and Arthur, he attempts to shoot a gun for the first time. When John and Arthur make fun of him, Michael points the gun at his cousins' heads and curses at Polly for still treating him like a boy. Eventually, Michael begins to feel guilty for being groomed as the \"legitimate boss\" with his hands kept clean, while John and Arthur do the dirty work.\n\nIn Series 5, Michael's ambitious nature takes hold, and he plots to replace Thomas as head of the Shelby family and business. His ambitions are furthered by his manipulative and ambitious wife Gina. Over the years in the United States, Michael began to slowly resent his exile and decides that he should be the one in charge of Shelby Company Limited, despite the mess the family is in being entirely his fault because he ignored Thomas' instructions, losing nearly all their money in the Wall Street. It's heavily implied Michael sells the Peaky Blinders out after Thomas fires him. Michael develops a smug and arrogant attitude, fancying himself to be a cunning criminal operator and business genius who is entitled to succeed Thomas as head of the family, despite all evidence to the contrary although this is likely Gina manipulating Michael, encouraging his worst impulses. Michael especially lacks Tommy's often collected demeanor and his calculated, logical nature. He is then driven solely by revenge for Polly's murder, which he blames completely on Thomas despite the fact that Thomas was not responsible for Polly's murder and Tommy was equally as devastated by Polly's deaths as Michael was.\n\nIts likely that Gina had a heavily influence on Micheal new persona as when he was not with her (pre season 5) he was a good natured obidient man,\n\nRelationships[]\n\nPolly Gray[]\n\nMichael loves his mother but is not afraid of challenging her authority. When Polly also refuses to allow him to work for Thomas, Michael even makes threats so she will take him more seriously. Polly had Michael taken away from her many years ago, hence why she doesn’t want to let him get deeper involved in the business. She doesn't want to let him go because he is the only thing she has, and if she were to lose him she would not forgive Thomas. Like his mother, Michael handles many of the financial aspects of the company. Unlike Polly, Michael deliberately keeps himself far away from the more illegal doings, at first, however in the end he starts to do and organize them.\n\nJohn Shelby[]\n\nJohn is Michael's cousin and the two are the closest in age out of all the Shelbys. In Series 2, John looks out for Michael since he is the youngest of the boys and has only just been re-introduced into the family. John tells Polly not to worry about him, and let him join in with the rest of them when the boys go to a horse auction. Throughout Series 2 John is seen play fighting and hugging Michael, in an attempt to make Michael less tense when he is around them.\n\nThroughout Series 3, their relationship changes due to Michael now being a more crucial part to the Shelby Company. Tommy, in John's eyes, is beginning to tell Michael more and he is more involved than John. John likens it to being a \"toy soldier\" and being told to \"do this John, do that John.\" He thinks that Tommy doesn't care about him as much as he does Michael since his relationship with Tommy just seems to be taking orders from him.\n\nAll of this means that John begins to show a dislike towards Michael, resembling jealousy in some capacities. Since Michael seems to hold a more important role in the business, as Tommy says himself, \"legitimate business is the priority.\" Things are not helped when Michael is made Chief Accountant of Shelby Company Limited as John, becomes more hostile toward Michael as a result. Although Michael wants to fit in with the brothers, John is merely taking his anger that he feels towards Tommy out on Michael. John's resentment towards Michael wears off through Series 3 as Michael begins to take more of a physical role in the business, officially taking part in Peaky Blinder activities and showing more of an interest in illegitimate business. Michael turns to Arthur and John for advice concerning Charlotte's abortion and how to shoot a gun. This shows to John and Arthur that Michael is serious about his role in the gang and looks up to them. Also, when Michael is on his way to kill the priest, John offers him some more advice. Their relationship is complex, John clearly harbors resentment towards Michael as John would like to be viewed by Tommy the same way Michael is, however John still seems to have a general liking of Michael and treats him like a younger brother.\n\nGina Gray[]\n\nGina is Michael's wife and the mother to their son, Laurence Gray. She and Michael fell in love during Michael's time in the United States, but not much is known about their history. She pressured Michael to move away from the Peaky Blinders, and encouraged him to seize control within Shelby Company Limited, despite his initial reservations. While she loves Michael, she did not wish to stay in Small Heath, wanting to return with Michael to the US for the birth of their child. By 1934 that \"love\" for Michael seems to have faded as Gina is caught by Tommy having sex with Oswald Mosley, revealing Gina to not only being unfaithful, but also calls into question whether she ever loved Michael, considering Gina's narcissistic and selfish personality. For his part, Michael also seems to become disenchanted with Gina. Gina also encourages Michael's worst impulses, fostering his rampant ego, as well as playing a part in Michael's eventual banishment from the Shelby family and even his death.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeries 1 Appearances Episode 1.1 Episode 1.2 Episode 1.3 Episode 1.4 Episode 1.5 Episode 1.6\n\nSeries 2 Appearances Episode 2.1 Episode 2.2 Episode 2.3 Episode 2.4 Episode 2.5 Episode 2.6\n\nSeries 3 Appearances Episode 3.1 Episode 3.2 Episode 3.3 Episode 3.4 Episode 3.5 Episode 3.6\n\nSeries 4 Appearances The Noose Heathens Blackbird Dangerous The Duel The Company\n\nSeries 5 Appearances Black Tuesday Black Cats Strategy The Loop The Shock Mr Jones\n\nSeries 6 Appearances Black Day Black Shirt Gold Sapphire The Road to Hell Lock and Key\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"In my village, there's this little wishing well. It's made of white bricks, right in the middle of the village green. Everybody says how pretty it is. But I swear to God, if I spend another day in that village, I'm going to blow it up with dynamite. Probably blow my hands off with it, but it'd be worth it. Just to see all those pretty white bricks spread over the pretty village green.\"\n\nThomas Shelby:\"You're going to call your mother. You're going to tell her you're getting the next train home.
