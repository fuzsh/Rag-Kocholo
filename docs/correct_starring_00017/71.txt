Martine McCutcheon - another actress who stars in the movie - has teased a potential reunion ahead of the festive period.

She revealed that she has been working on a project with the Love Actually director Richard Curtis that aims to 'celebrate' the movie.

She said: "I have just been filming something for the delightful Richard Curtis. He is doing something which is going to be celebrating Love Actually big time."

The details of whatever this project is remain a secret for now, but with Christmas just around the corner, it wouldn't come as a surprise if the team behind this 'reunion' are eager to get whatever it is out before the 25th of December.

Fans of the movie took to social media to voice their delight at the thought of the movie making any sort of return, with one person saying it would 'make their Christmas'.
