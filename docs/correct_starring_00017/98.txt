As Christmas fast approaches, there's one film that's pretty much guaranteed to be on our collective watchlists: Love Actually, of course.

With an all-star cast including the likes of Hugh Grant, Keira Knightly, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson and Liam Neeson side-by-side, Love Actually holds its own as a Christmas classic - originally airing back in 2003. Plus, some of the movie's younger cast members (remember Sam and Joanna?) have grown up to star in some of our favourite new films and TV shows too.

So, if you're rewatching Love Actually this winter, here's a run through of what the cast look like now, and what they've all been doing in the 18 years since the film was released.
