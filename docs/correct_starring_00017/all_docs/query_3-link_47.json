        "text": "Good, romcom, and christmas themed, how about peace in the Middle East instead?\n\nAnyway, not exactly the greatest movie ever made, but did find Last Christmas 2019 https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8623904/ to be quite entertaining, it is quite well cast which really helped to elevate the material.\n\nGod I'll be the first to admit I hated the \"twist\" that came from a mile away. But they're so pretty and lovely together, I def wanted more. \"Look! It's Henry Golding's identical twin brother!\" (forgot his movie name)\n\nI can see where you're coming from, but I love the movie and that first night encounter too much for it to bother me. Beckinsale is just too perfect in it. Looking forward to watching it agaib tomorrow!\n\nlol no lie: I saw it on the Disney+ lineup and hovered over it (I woulda hit play. but forgot to get groceries).\n\nYeah, Love Actually is trash, but that's a minority opinion over here. For some reason, in The Netherlands Love Actually remains one of the most universally beloved romcoms. Hell, we even got our own (also very shitty) version.\n\nMoving on, so Martin Freeman is just pretend fucking some girl so we can see her tits? What are the point of these characters??? Comic relief? Fanservice?\n\nThis is the only part of the movie I actually think is good lol. It's the only non-toxic relationship in the entire movie.\n\nCAN SOMEONE RECOMMENED ME A GOOD ROMCOM PREF CHRISTMAS THEMED OR RECENT? IM KINDA LIT RN.\n\nJust from what me and my GF have seen this year.\n\nHolidate; probably the best evolution of raunchy romcoms\n\nLove Hard; better than wxpected and Jimmy Wong is actually a really great romantic lead. He brings a surprising amount of swagger.\n\nHoliday in Handcuffs; a classic.\n\nA New York Christmas Wedding; Hahahahaha oh man this movie is a wild mess with angels, alternate timeliness, and weddings.\n\nChristmas with the campbells; I wish I could describe this movie but its just a trip of weird casting decisions and you can never quite tell if the movie is self aware or not? It walks that line like it lives there.\n\nThis is some of y'all GOAT RomCom? This movie is fucking garbage and not even funny.\n\nFirst of all it's mad problematic, the Andrew Lincoln/ Keira Knightly shit? wtf were they thinking? Creepy as fuck and she dead ass gave him a kiss on the mouth???? Excuse me??? I was in disbelief, someone tell my boy Ejiofor please. Now let's move on to Hugh Grant who got salty enough about a girl who he wasn't even talking to, let alone dating that he was willing to start some real world international problems. The fuck? Let's not even talk about the whole power dynamic going on. Moving on, so Martin Freeman is just pretend fucking some girl so we can see her tits? What are the point of these characters??? Comic relief? Fanservice?\n\nEveryone else is just like who fucking cares, this dude's wife cheats on him and 5 weeks later he's proposing to someone else? Ok, but that's dude's whole character. There's just no time to develop anyone beyond surface level so who gives a fuck? Did Taken's wife really need to die? You know you can be a father in a happy marriage and still pay attention to shit your kids are going thru.\n\nONE OF THE WORST MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN, ONE OF THE WORST CHRISTMAS MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN, WORSE ROMCOM\n\nI need to watch a YT video cooking this film 0/5\n\nCAN SOMEONE RECOMMENED ME A GOOD ROMCOM PREF CHRISTMAS THEMED OR RECENT? IM KINDA LIT RN.\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS YOU FILTHY ANIMALS.\n\nIt's Christmas tradition to shit on Love Actually. I'm sure there are plenty of youtube videos or thinkpieces dunking on this bad and problematic romcom, like here is just the Honest Trailers of it. It after all likely started the trend of bad holiday ensemble romcoms.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/giq7KdN4X-Y?si=OHOGr7ELfsWLbRoj\n\nI watched it for the first time a few years ago. I honestly went it with no expectations and was stunned by how dumb it was. Huge parts of it felt like a parody and a bunch of other parts of it were just awful.\n\nLike, it bothered me for days.\n\nI've since learned that people either feel strongly about it one way or the other, but I ain't see much worth liking. It's wild. A tiny part of me wants to watch it again anytime I see the discussion brought up, but I'm not sure I could.\n\nI first watched it when it had already become a mainstream classic and I was also appalled at how bad it was. Then I found the Jezebel piece on it:\n\nEverything in this movie is fucking insane. That's not how press conferences work. That's not how diplomacy works. That's not how prime ministers work. NOTHING IS HOW ANYTHING WORKS. That's not how weddings work, that's not how audio recording works, that's not how saxophones work, that's not how hair works, that's not how business meetings work, that's not how art works, that's not how grief works, that's not how primary school Christmas concerts work, that's not how airports work, that's not how music charts work, that's not how fat works, and none of it is how \"love works.\"\n\nI first watched it when it had already become a mainstream classic and I was also appalled at how bad it was. Then I found the Jezebel piece on it:\n\nLindy West's Jezebel piece is what I always and forever will think of when I think of this film now. She really hit the nail on the head.\n\nEDIT: I just went and looked at your link and found that in the transition to Paste Media all the screengrabs were stripped out of the article. I'm glad they bought Jezebel but that really sucks. I guess that must have happened to all their legacy content? Not only were those pics a contributing factor in the article's humor, but also in her text Lindy directly references screengrabs that are no longer there!"
