        "text": "The cast of Love Actually is bringing back that famous cue-card scene. In a new teaser for its upcoming Red Nose Day reunion sequel, everyone from Andrew Lincoln to Keira Knightley to Liam Neeson gets in on the cue-card action for a delightful promo that makes a rather saucy proposition.\n\nA card held by Lúcia Moniz, who plays Colin Firth’s love interest in the original film, invites fans to “tune in to see what happened to everyone.”\n\n“And, amongst other things, which one of us has aged best,” reads Keira Knightley’s card. The actress ever so slightly raises her brow after unveiling the card, as if to suggest there is only one true answer. That’s fine by co-star Hugh Grant, whose cue-card demands that fans say that “it’s not Colin Firth.”\n\nThe teaser also features appearances by Rowan Atkinson, Bill Nighy, and Chiwetel Ejiofor, who plays Knightley’s husband in the original 2003 film.\n\nKnightley’s character, Juliet, by the way, was the original subject of the infamous cue-card scene . . . which is pretty messed up if you think about it for approximately two seconds! Even though Mark and Peter (Ejiofor) were supposed to be best friends, all along, Mark was scheming up ways to sweep Juliet off her feet. Will the duo possibly end up together in the reunion? According to new details from producer Emma Freund, Mark “still loves her” after all these years, so anything’s possible. Here’s hoping Peter finds out the truth and exacts his revenge in the upcoming reunion, which is set to air on May 25.\n\nCHRISTMAS IS ALL AROUND\n\nLove Actually Stars Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, and More Offer Clues About the Sequel\n\nThe short premieres March 24 in the U.K. and May 25 in the U.S.\n\nDetails, Actually\n\nNew Love Actually Reunion Photos Reveal the Fate of Its Most Scandalous Couple\n\nThe U.K.’s dreamiest fictional Prime Minister is back.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nHollywood\n\nHere: Robert Zemeckis’s New Movie Spans a Century, but the Camera Never Moves\n\nTom Hanks and Robin Wright reunite the Forrest Gump team for a drama set entirely in one household’s living room.\n\nMovies\n\nPaul Mescal vs. Pedro Pascal: A First Look at the Epic Gladiator II\n\nIn Ridley Scott’s sequel, a new generation of warriors clashes in a savage Rome: “It’s pretty gnarly.”\n\nTelevision\n\nHow Princess Diana’s Funeral Inspired House of the Dragon’s Somber Procession\n\nIt’s brother versus brother in “Rhaenyra the Cruel,” which sees Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk come to fatal blows.
