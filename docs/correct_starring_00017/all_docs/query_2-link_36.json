        "text": "We already have a few hints about what to expect from the Love Actually sequel, which premieres in the U.K. next week as part of the annual Red Nose Day charity telethon. Hugh Grant’s Prime Minister and Martine McCutcheon’s Natalie still appear to be together after all these years. Andrew Lincoln’s Mark has apparently still not given up on Keira Knightley’s married character (or those oft-mocked cue cards) after over a decade. (Maybe the sequel will involve Mark seeing a counselor?) And Emma Thompson won’t be reprising her character for a heartbreaking reason. On Friday, though, BBC dropped a new video chock full of behind-the-scenes footage and clues as to what we can expect from the film’s 10-minute follow-up.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nBill Nighy’s character Billy Mack is still a flashy dresser. Hugh Grant’s character is still Prime Minister, holding press conferences at 10 Downing Street, and dancing.\n\nDespite the fact that Thomas Brodie-Sangster’s Sam was a pre-teen when he made his romantic (though entirely unrealistic) dash through airport security checkpoints to meet Olivia Olson’s Joanna, the two appear to still be in some sort of contact. Maybe they are boyfriend/girlfriend, all these years later! Maybe just classmates! Maybe they have been court-ordered to give middle-school assemblies about the dangers of romantic gestures in airports as part of a plea deal! Who knows?!\n\nBut we can infer that Sam was able to avoid juvie, because Brodie-Sangster is shown filming an outdoors scene with Liam Neeson, his onscreen father. In it, the two embrace and, well, we’re not sure what else.\n\nAfterward, Neeson charmed the BBC cameras, telling them it was bizarre being back with the Love Actually cast because “they’ve all aged except me. It’s terrific seeing these kids, especially Thomas. Because he was 11 or 12 [when we filmed].”\n\nEveryone seems thrilled to be back. . . except, perhaps, for Hugh Grant—who has something of a reputation for being a bit of a curmudgeon.\n\n“This nightmare with Richard happens every bloody year,” Grant deadpans of the annual invitation for a Love Actually reunion. (Love Actually writer/director Richard Curtis is the long-time romantic partner of Red Nose Day’s director Emma Freud—which might explain why Curtis & the Love Actually Co. were tempted to reunite in the past.)\n\n“Some years I can fob him off with money,” Grant says. “‘I’m not doing that. Here’s a check.’”\n\nNot everyone is as much of a Love Actually downer, though. McCutcheon had a more rom-com appropriate response to the news that there would be a reunion: “My heart—there was a little skip, a little jump.”\n\nThe Love Actually short premieres March 24 in the U.K. and May 25 in the U.S.\n\nA Teaser, Actually\n\nThe Cue Cards Are Back in the First Teaser for That Love Actually Reunion\n\nThe 10-minute short, a sequel to the beloved original film, will premiere in the U.K. on March 24.\n\nDetails, Actually\n\nNew Love Actually Reunion Photos Reveal the Fate of Its Most Scandalous Couple\n\nThe U.K.’s dreamiest fictional Prime Minister is back.\n\nchristmas is all around\n\nThe Heartbreaking Reason Emma Thompson Is Skipping the Love Actually Sequel\n\nThe Oscar winner is missing the reunion, but it has nothing to do with her busy schedule.\n\nAnother One, Actually\n\nLove Actually Is Getting a Sequel—but There’s a Twist\n\nAnd no, it’s not that Andrew Lincoln was in love with Keira Knightley the whole time.\n\nHollywood\n\n22 Undersung TV Gems to Binge Right This Second\n\nNow that Peak TV has peaked, consider watching one of these unjustly uncelebrated series, handpicked by Maureen Ryan.\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Biden Can Flip His Fortunes—or Flop!—in His First Debate With Trump\n\nA veteran of numerous presidential debates offers a strategy for thumping Trump.\n\nMovies\n\nThe 25 Best Movies on Netflix to Stream Right Now\n\nFrom comedy classics to recent Oscar winners, these are the titles you don’t want to miss.\n\nPolitics\n\n“Don’t F-cking Leave”: How Neo-Nazis and White Supremacists Trap Their Followers in the Movement Forever\n\nIn an excerpt of her new book Black Pill, CNN correspondent Elle Reeve wades through the organizational muck of the far right—which consists of the “suits” and “boots”—and reveals the personal pitfalls of being famous among all the worst people.\n\nAward Season\n\nIn Conclave, the Pope Dies—Then the Twisty Search for His Successor Begins\n\nRalph Fiennes top lines the new film from the director of All Quiet on the Western Front, a thriller about both a personal and a collective crisis of faith—backed by a brilliant ensemble including Isabella Rossellini, Stanley Tucci, and more."
