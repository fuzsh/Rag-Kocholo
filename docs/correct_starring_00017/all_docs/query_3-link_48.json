        "text": "The Holiday (2006) is a romantic comedy set during the Christmas season with two love stories that take place in different countries whose characters become connected. This story takes place before Airbnb; when people who wanted to vacation could swap houses with strangers. Both leading ladies have bad break-ups that lead them to swear off men, only to fall in love. The Holiday is adorable and not completely unrealistic. My favorite relationship in The Holiday is between two friends of different ages and backgrounds who would appear to have nothing in common but form a beautiful bond.\n\nThe Holiday stars Kate Winslet, Cameron Diaz, Jude Law, and Jack Black. The cast is all so likable, even Jude Law. Before this movie, I had never thought of Jack Black as a love interest for a romantic comedy, but I adore him in this. I have been a fan of Kate Winslet as a leading lady since starring in Titanic and would watch any movie she’s in. Cameron Diaz was in the prime of her acting career and was one of my favorite romantic comedy actresses from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s. Both leading men and ladies give an excellent performance in The Holiday."
