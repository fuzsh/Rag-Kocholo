The budget for Jupiter Ascending was $179 million and it was co-financed by Warner Bros (40% of the production costs), Village Roadshow (40%) and Rat-Pac Dune Entertainment (20%). Jupiter underwent reshoots in January 2014 and had more reshoots three months later and WB originally scheduled the release for July 18, 2014 but just 6 weeks before it was to open they delayed the pic to February 6, 2015. Warner Bros claimed that the vfx were incomplete and needed additional work, but the picture was also tracking very poorly.

WB re-scheduled the pic on the same date as the long delayed Seventh Son, which Warner Bros was previously scheduled to distribute before their divorce with Legendary Pictures. Warner Bros spent $50M+ on stateside advertising with over $30 million just in TV advertisements leading up to the film’s release. Despite the full weight and support of the WB marketing machine, Jupiter Ascending was still tracking poorly and was surrounded by bad buzz.

The expensive pic opened against The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water and Seventh Son and struggled with $18,372,372 in 3,181 theaters — placing #3 for the weekend led by The SpongeBob Movie and the Warner Bros holdover American Sniper. The film’s marketing never seemed to click with audiences and Warner Bros upped their ad spend when the film pulled in its poor opening numbers and they spent an additional $9.8 million in television ads, throwing away good cash at a marketing campaign that was clogging up the airwaves and not connecting with people. Jupiter Ascending declined 49.6% to $9,254,019 in its second weekend, ending its chances at breaking out and it fell a steep 58.9% in its third frame to $3,805,317. The film ended its domestic run with a less than blockbuster $47,387,723.
