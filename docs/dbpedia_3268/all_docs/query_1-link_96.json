        "text": "Information for parents about the film \"Jupiter Ascending.\"\n\nViolence/gore: A man is shot during a home robbery. A ruthless character kills those who do not do his bidding. Mercenaries and soldiers use futuristic weapons and props to fight each other. A man is jettisoned into space. Humans are probed and tested with needles. Spaceships engage in dogfights around a city. Some blood is seen on wounds. The birth of a child happens in a cargo container.\n\nNudity/sensuality: A woman comes out of a bath and her body is seen from behind. People are kissing. A man appears naked and is surrounded by women treating him in a sensual way, though nothing is very sexual.\n\nLanguage: Some uses of profanity\n\nShawn O'Neill, Deseret News\n\nShawn O'Neill is the Family Man Movie Reviewer.
