Give directors Andy and Lana Wachowski credit for trying to make a film that shows more than it tells, but that doesn’t work when it’s not clear what key characters are trying to accomplish or whose side they’re on. By the time the muddy story clears – sort of – the movie is a smoking, albeit colorful, pile of nonsensical silliness.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain, for example, whether protagonist Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) and her rescuer/servant/love interest/invulnerable soldier/human hybrid Cain (Channing Tatum) have good chemistry, because there are too many distractions (Tatum’s eyeliner and pointy ears among them), what with all the explosions and shooting and spaceship-chasing. While Kunis clearly isn’t ready to be an action hero yet, she does manage to make her character the only thing in the movie worth caring about. The same can’t be said of Tatum, who’s a good actor and an effective action star, but here he just seems wooden and almost embarrassed at times.\n\nIf you love the idea of dozens of Mila Kunis close-ups – in 3-D, no less – this is the film for you.\n\nJupiter is a Chicago girl with a semi-amusing (yes, intentionally), large Russian family. She and her mother are cleaning women (the sight of someone as bright and gorgeous as Kunis scrubbing other people’s toilets is the first hint of the coming heap of unbelievability).\n\nTurns out, Jupiter is unknowingly the queen of a galactic dynasty and the subject of a political power struggle involving three royal siblings: One wants her dead; another hires super soldier-turned bounty hunter Cain to snatch her from Earth.\n\nNaturally, everyone shows up at the same time, and a mostly enjoyable battle ensues, destroying a good chunk of downtown Chicago. That is OK, because aliens can wave their hands, undo the damage and make humans forget it ever happened.\n\nCain and Jupiter enlist the help of Cain’s old commander Stinger (a tired-looking Sean Bean, mostly wasted in the role), who, of course, has long-standing issues with Cain. Of course, they get to brawling before they can team up again. The bad guys – some really ugly thugs resembling “Close Encounters of the Third Kind” aliens after a three-year bender – join in, and the fighting spreads into outer space.\n\nThe extraterrestrial scenery is spectacular, even if the characters look like they just auditioned for a “Fifth Element” parody. It’s here the ridiculousness gauge red-lines, thanks to space alien Balem (Eddie Redmayne), who wants Jupiter dead and Earth wiped out for a particularly gross reason that involves lots of money.\n\nRedmayne may have been wonderful in “The Theory of Everything,” but he’s so over the top and hysterical in his mood swings here that he brings a big chunk of the aforementioned unintentional comedy. Jupiter ends up with Balem’s duplicitous brother Titus (Douglas Booth), but not before meeting their sister Kalique Abrasax (Tuppence Middleton), who explains the royal family’s connection to Jupiter and how they’ve managed to rule for thousands of years.\n\nYes, Jupiter owns Earth. She just doesn’t know it.\n\nAt this point, characters are making seriously questionable decisions without blinking, and the whole thing starts to resemble the world’s most expensive midnight movie.\n\nOf course, many good sci-fi action movies contain plot holes big enough to drive a Death Star through. But the Wachowskis (“The Matrix”) pound their audience with sensory overload, cliches and predictability to the point of boredom. Not to ruin the (non) surprise, but by the 37th time Cain bucks unbelievable odds to save Jupiter, there isn’t a shred of suspense.\n\nIt’s why the big climax, despite its overblown and loud effects, is mostly yawn-inducing.\n\n“Jupiter Ascending” is the film equivalent of a baseball slugger unleashing a huge swing and missing. Only in this case, the bat flies out of his hands, fires 3-D lasers at the crowd and zooms 1,000 feet into the sky before exploding. It sure looks spectacular, but it’s still a swing and a miss.\n\nOriginally Published: February 5, 2015 at 9:39 a.m."
