        "text": "A cinematic feud: Are the curtains closing on Village Roadshow?\n\nBy Jennifer Duke & Kylar Loussikian\n\nThe angry emails began on June 20 when John Kirby fired off a lengthy missive to the Village Roadshow board. The subject line was: “The Diagnosis”.\n\nKirby had resigned as an executive at Village - the film, entertainment and theme parks business run by his family for decades - five years earlier.\n\nHe remained on the board, however, and watched with growing frustration as the company’s share price tumbled from $7.15 five years ago to as little as $1.77 in July.\n\nThe 71-year-old had stood back as his younger brother and executive chairman Robert Kirby and chief executive Graham Burke, a family friend, called the shots over that time. But now he’d had enough.\n\nIn the email John outlined his frustrations. He accused Village’s management, led by his brother, of issuing overly optimistic financial forecasts, weak corporate governance and poor capital management.\n\nHe concluded the business behind Hollywood blockbusters such as Happy Feet, The Matrix and Zoolander was sick, and needed urgent attention.\n\nThe email received a cursory reply and was then followed by several others. Sources familiar with the contents estimate they would run to more than 150 pages if printed out.\n\nJohn’s arguments are contested by other members of the Village board who dismiss him as disgruntled and jealous.\n\nEarlier this week, Burke called him “disgruntled and bitter”. But there is no question about the trajectory of the company that is still worth $554 million, boasts a 70 year heritage and was one of corporate Australia’s great success stories.\n\nSince 2014, Village Roadshow’s market value has tanked from $1.2 billion to as little as $370 million. The market decline was keenly felt by Burke and the Kirby family who own 42 per cent of the company between them.\n\nThe rise in video streaming services such as Netflix and Stan slowly hobbled Village’s DVD distribution business.\n\nA string of box office bombs, including the 2015 flop Jupiter Ascending starring Mila Kunis, eroded an investment in Village Roadshow Pictures, the Hollywood film studio the Melbourne company once controlled.\n\nAnd suddenly too its theme parks were in trouble. In 2017, Village reported a $67 million loss.\n\nThe other undeniable fact about John’s emails is that they exposed tensions with his brother that some people believe have existed behind the scenes for years.\n\nThe family feud remained a private matter last year but earlier this week John went public with his grievances by confirming he had hired an investment bank in an attempt to break up Village. It is a proposal Robert vehemently opposes.\n\nWith both brothers seemingly intractable, the question is who will prevail?\n\nThe greatest showman\n\nOne of the earliest memories Robert, now 67, has of Roscoe “Roc” Kirby is of him standing over the kitchen table, sketching up dreams for what the company’s next cinema would look like on huge sheets of white paper. Robert says he remembers “clear as crystal” his pioneering father drawing lines representing the parking ramps and planning out the way it would look.\n\nThe idea for the new drive-in theatres was based on a photograph Roc had seen in a newspaper while serving in WW2.\n\nHearing his family were cinema operators, an American soldier showed him an article of the US’ most recent drive-in innovation and the idea returned with him from Papua New Guinea.\n\nAt the peak of the drive-in era, Roc’s businesses Kirby Theatres Pty Ltd and Village Drive-In Pty Ltd would have 14 drive-ins, mostly in Victoria, and many other traditional theatres.\n\nThe business rapidly became a household name and today Village has 74 cinemas with 704 screens, owns some of the country’s biggest theme parks in Movie World, the Gold Coast’s Wet’N’Wild and SeaWorld and is associated with classic films Gallipoli, Mad Max, Red Dog, Muriel’s Wedding and Breaker Morant.\n\nRoc is described by those who knew him as the “ultimate showman” and an instinctive businessman who knew that fresh ideas, glamorous openings and promotion were the secret sauce for getting Australians out of their home and into his venues. And he would put everything on the line to get the job done.\n\nKnown for sayings like “your word is your bond”, “always do what you say you’ll do” and “an ounce of loyalty is worth a ton of know-how”, Roc ignored naysayers who laughed at him because he wanted to put “pictures in a paddock” at a time when indoor cinemas were closing due to the growing popularity of television.\n\nHe launched his Croydon drive-in in the 1950s. It was a sensation with innovations such as BBQs, a fish and chip unit and a glass-fronted cafeteria (which now-defunct newspaper The Argus reviewed as “expected to be a huge success with Melbourne people who have taken to espresso coffee in a big way”).\n\nAs the 20-acre plots he owned for the drive-ins surged in value after land was rezoned to cater for a growing and sprawling urban population in Melbourne, Roc was able to sell out for a big profit in subsequent decades\n\nHe used the money to buy a prime Melbourne CBD location on Bourke Street from Alan Bond who had been using it as a Walton’s department store until 1983. The business spent $30 million redeveloping the site into a five-level cinema, retail and office complex (the head office would later move to South Yarra).\n\nThe drive-ins are just one of the achievements the Kirby sons and Burke idolised him for.\n\n“He turned a paddock and a creek into MovieWorld ... he mortgaged his house [to do it],” Burke says.\n\nVillage continues to be controlled by the Kirby brothers and Burke who started working for Roc part-time aged 14 at the Ararat cinema in south-west Victoria\n\nBy the time he was a young adult, Burke was managing a large part of the business (at 21 he wrote the operations manual) and says he had come to see Roc and his wife Beatrice Kirby as “my Melbourne mum and dad”.\n\nThose who know the family well refer to Burke and Robert as “like twins” who grew up together, visiting St Kilda’s Luna Park, and the empty drive-ins during the day-time, for fun. Burke, 77, has spent his entire career at Village and remains very close to Robert to the point where they call each other “at least four times a day”.\n\nThe close friendship between them may explain why John’s resentments are bubbling to the surface. Some observers believe jealousy over his brother’s closeness with his father’s business protege plays a role, as does that pair’s dominance over Village. Sources close to John dispute this.\n\nRoc died in 2008 (Beatrice in 2011) but his strategy of turning a deaf ear to negativity has been a defining part of the Village story. His business style has left an indelible impression on Robert and Burke.\n\nEven today, on the wall of Robert’s office, is a sign that reminds him to have “contagious optimism” - a motto that has been vigorously tested over the last few years.\n\nEchoes of a tragedy\n\nNo one saw it coming. On 25 October 2016, a balmy Tuesday on the Gold Coast, Ardent Leisure-owned holiday venue Dreamworld was on the verge of a tragedy that would send shockwaves through the theme park industry.\n\nA malfunction on the wildly popular Thunder River Rapids Ride left four people dead, in a disaster that was traumatic for witnesses, dominated the news cycle for days after and led to a government inquest.\n\nIt didn’t just close down Dreamworld for more than a month – and the ride forever – it saw the public lose confidence, at least temporarily, in all theme park operators.\n\nBurke says mums were “spooked about taking their kids to theme parks” afterwards and the tragedy turned a steady stream of local and international tourists to Village’s entertainment venues into a trickle.\n\n“It was the single biggest turnaround in our fortune,” he says.\n\nUnlike the Village of Roc’s era, a large swathe of the company’s income comes from its theme parks rather than cinemas. By 2016, losses from Village’s movie production business had hit $487 million. In the same year, $88 million of earnings came from theme parks, $82 million from cinemas and $24.5 million from film distribution.\n\nAfter the Dreamworld incident, Village’s earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) from the theme parks division fell from an $86 million average in the five-years prior to $56 million in 2017 and $39 million last year.\n\n“There's no doubt the biggest low the company here has had over its whole period of existence was the Dreamworld tragedy,” former board member David Evans says.\n\nEvans, a prominent Melbourne businessman, was chair of corporate governance until November 2018 and is a friend of Burke’s.\n\n“It didn't have anything to do with Village, however its roll on effect was substantial. That is only just starting to right itself,” he says.\n\nWhile no one disputes there was an impact from Dreamworld, sources close to John claim Burke and Robert “overstate” the fallout and failed to use the issues facing a competitor to get ahead.\n\nFor John, Wet’n’Wild Sydney was the final straw.\n\nThe park was sold last year for a loss of $25 million after draining cash despite great hopes when it opened in 2013.\n\nIt wasn’t Village’s only problem.\n\nThe company blamed broader financial woes on a smorgasbord of uncontrollable factors, including the Dreamworld disaster, “low attendance” to the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast and wet weather.\n\nBut it was the aqua park’s problems, and a call for the Kirby brothers to inject $7 million each into the company to pay down debt, that was the focused of John’s ire.\n\nBurke, a film lover, is described by supporters as highly knowledgeable about the entertainment business and devoted to Village.\n\nBut he is criticised by detractors as being too interested in “Hollywood” despite film production now being on the sidelines.\n\nUnder the spotlight\n\nIn July 2018, John hired former Rothschild boss David Kingston, an erstwhile investment banker turned property tycoon.\n\nKingston knew Village and the Kirby brothers well, having previously sat on the board of radio network Austereo when it was controlled by the company.\n\nHe had worked on property trusts for management in the past.\n\nKingston is well-known for his aggressive approach. In 2015 he attempted to evict Justin Hemmes from the Coogee Beach Palace Hotel in 2015 when the Sydney pub baron was two days late paying the rent. Kingston was out of pocket by $85.74.\n\nKingston and John detailed a litany of issues ranging from the acquisition of businesses with no connection to the core theme park and cinema operations to accusations Burke and Robert were using the company to enrich themselves and their children. Robert’s son Clark works as the theme park division’s chief executive on a salary exceeding $1 million a year.\n\nSince 2015, Village has paid $1.4 million to purchase wine from Robert Kirby’s vineyard Yabby Lake, another $90,000 renting the family artwork, and about $70,000 to buy bikinis from Burke’s daughter Lisa.\n\nAll these related-party transactions are legal and disclosed in Village’s annual reports but most listed companies try to avoid them.\n\nTensions between the board grew and sources close to John Kirby say his constant questioning was the reason the company started tightening spending.\n\nKingston is among those who does not accept the Dreamworld tragedy as a valid reason for the overall decline in shareholder value and who considers John a “white knight”.\n\n“In the interests of all shareholders to fix the future performance of Village, John is seeking a new independent chairman in line with corporate governance standards [the] injection of new senior management, more non core assets sales and further reduction in excessive expenditure,” he says.\n\n“With cancelled dividend, a $50 million rights issue, very poor share price and fire sale of Sydney Wet’n’Wild, since June 2018 John has done the heavy lifting and has probed extensively and constructively on multiple issues and concerns.”\n\nThe extent to which John can marshall a rebellion remains to be seen. The rest of the share register features few institutional investors with the exceptions of American outfits Dimensional Fund Advisors and Mittleman Brothers.\n\nThe few market analysts who continue to watch Village are lukewarm about the company’s turnaround. Citi analyst Sam Teeger said in August that Village could struggle to grow earnings.\n\n“This could be challenging given the structural challenges in cinema and plans to reduce capital expenditure … divestment of underperforming divisions such as Roadshow may assist,” Teeger wrote.\n\nDeutsche Bank’s Wassim Kisirwani was similarly unimpressed, and told clients that Village had “a poor record of delivering on expectations”.\n\nThe company had “attractive assets and an undemanding valuation”, but investors would “prefer to see some evidence of cost out traction before taking a more positive view”, Kisirwani wrote.\n\nBut a note from Baillieu a week ago said the company's share price has \"rebounded strongly from the deeply discounted capital raising\" in July.\n\nThe broker attributed the rally to capital raising to reduce debt, cost initiatives, successful refinancing and an improved trading outlook with a strong domestic box office and recovering theme park ticket sales.\n\nThe show must go on\n\nRoc and Beatrice Kirby famously gave very few interviews, though the couple spoke in-depth to former Victorian premier John Cain for his 1998 book On with the Show.\n\nOne of Roc’s great thrills was seeing Village blossom, and in 1994 he said that when he first started the business it was a “struggling little outfit [and] my vision had to survive through the ruthless competition in those early days”.\n\n“When this became apparent, I had a clear dedication for Village to achieve a commanding cinema circuit throughout Australia... My vision now is for Village Roadshow to become an overall world entertainment identity,” he said.\n\nRobert shows similar optimism in 2019 after the company’s toughest year on record, saying “there are strong and encouraging indications of a turnaround, especially in our biggest business, our theme parks”.\n\n“And of course the Queensland summer has been blessed with superb weather.”\n\nHe refuses to speak publicly about John and the family feud (John also declined to comment) but regardless, February 22 will be a landmark for the company when it publishes half yearly results and faces shareholders.\n\nEither Burke and Robert deliver a strong return to growth - and importantly, start distributing money to shareholders again - or their leadership of Village will look increasingly untenable.\n\nInvestment banks are already sceptical, interest from major fund managers is scarce, and the board is riven by a bitter feud.\n\nAnd what’s at stake? Only the future of the Village name and the legacy of Roc, Burke and the Kirbys.\n\nVillage Roadshow pressed to outline future direction amid Kirby brothers dispute\n\nBy Max Mason\n\nVillage Roadshow's board and management face growing pressure from shareholders to offload assets deemed a \"distraction\" and get better returns from its cinema and Gold Coast theme-parks businesses.\n\nThe push comes amid the bitter dispute between the Kirby brothers over the company's poor performance in the past five years – shares have dropped 54 per cent to $3.25 – and lack of clarity on direction.\n\nSydney-based funds manager Lanyon Asset Management believes shareholder returns will improve under a new, independent chairman, executive changes, a reduction in \"obscene\" corporate overheads and asset sales it deems a \"distraction\".\n\nNew York-based Mittleman Brothers supports asset sales, to focus on driving better profits at the cinema and theme-park businesses, and cutting corporate overheads, but wants to see who is proposed as chairman and management before supporting such a move.\n\nMittleman Brothers is Village's third-largest shareholder – after the bloc held jointly by the disputing Kirby brothers and chief executive Graham Burke and Vijay Vijendra Sethu – with a little less than 5 per cent of the company.\n\nHowever, Mr Sethu, who owns 5.1 per cent, has backed Robert Kirby and Mr Burke to continue as executive chairman and chief executive respectively, but to outline what is core and non-core to the business and proceed in an orderly manner on potential asset sales, arguing there is no rush.\n\nCCZ Equities has outlined a sum of the parks valuation on estimated 2020 earnings of $7.12, while JPMorgan said the business could be worth up to $5 a share on a break-up.\n\nLanyon managing director David Prescott has called on the three independent board members – Tim Antonie, who is working with Solomon Lew agitating for change at department store Myer, Jennifer Gambrell, and Robert Le Tat – to push for the sale of \"distraction\" assets, reduce \"obscene\" corporate overheads and introduce new management.\n\nAssets that could be unloaded were overseas theme parks, stakes in loss-making film-funding arm VREG, and United States premium cinema chain iPic, and the London marketing services business, he said.\n\n\"We feel that companies should have a board of effective composition; ideally, we think best practice is an independent chairman – one who facilitates effective contribution and promotes constructive and positive relationship between all of the board members and management and shareholders. That clearly hasn't been the case at Village\" Mr Prescott said.\n\n\"In our view, Village has been poorly managed and shareholders have suffered from their weak corporate governance framework.\"\n\nVillage's theme parks have struggled since the accident at rival Ardent Leisure's Dreamworld, when four people died after a raft flipped on the Thunder River Rapids ride in 2016. Village will report on Friday and its result is expected to improve thanks to good summer weather on the Gold Coast.\n\nThere has been growing tension between Village Roadshow's largest shareholders and board members – John Kirby, his brother Robert Kirby and Graham Burke – over the direction of leadership.\n\nDeputy chairman John Kirby is at loggerheads with Robert Kirby and Mr Burke, seeking to oust them from their long-held roles and sell underperforming assets.\n\nRobert Kirby has been chairman intermittently since 1994 and Mr Burke has been chief executive since 1988. From 2013 to 2018, they held the dual roles of co-chief executive and co-executive chairman. John Kirby stepped down from Village in an executive capacity in 2013 but remained on its board.\n\nTogether, the Kirby brothers and Mr Burke control about 42 per cent of Village Roadshow, through a combination of direct shareholdings and their ownership of Village Roadshow Corp, which speaks for 34 per cent of the ASX-listed company. They each own a third of Village Roadshow Corp.\n\nJohn Kirby cannot use the majority of his shares to vote for change because they are held in the private corporation, and he is outvoted by his brother and Mr Burke. He is exploring his legal options and may end up in court seeking a break-up of the private company.\n\nJohn Kirby hired investment banker David Kingston last July to pressure his brother and management for change after the share price hit of low of $1.73, the company asked for shareholders to tip into a $50 million capital raising and it suspended dividends in 2016.\n\nHowever, Mr Sethu said he believed Robert Kirby and Mr Burke had made their decisions with good intentions, and \"hindsight is 20:20\".\n\n\"These guys have more skin in the game than anyone else, they will obviously do what's right for the shareholders. Any mistake in the game, they own it more than us,\" he said.\n\n\"With hindsight it's easy to look at something and say, it's not core. The Sydney water park that they exited last year, that's about as core as it gets.\"\n\nLast year, Village sold Wet 'n' Wild Sydney for $40 million, taking a heavy loss on its investment as it looked to fix a growing debt problem. It also raised $50 million in capital last July to pay debt and invest in cinemas and Topgolf.\n\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed in January Village's board had halted plans to build eight Topgolf venues throughout Australian and the Asia-Pacific until the first Gold Coast centre, opened mid-last year, had proved its earning.\n\nIn 2017, the company completed the sale of its half stake in its Singapore cinema business for $165 million to joint-venture partner Orange Sky Golden Harvest Entertainment. It also sold the land its Gold Coast theme parks, Movie World and Wet'n'Wild, stand on for $100 million to super fund LGIAsuper, before signing an initial 30-year lease, with rent starting at $6.2 million annually.\n\n\"They have a track record of when they make a bad investment of exiting. There's no rush. The debt problem is completely over. There's no urgency to exit, you figure it out and tell the market and say what's core and non-core,\" Mr Sethu said.\n\nMr Sethu said he believed the disputing parties were not far apart, and achieving an acceptable price for non-core assets was down to timing.\n\nMittleman Brothers' Chris Mittleman said he would need to see who the proposed executive replacements were, but generally supported John Kirby's proposal because there was room to improve profit margins, capital allocation —such as buying back shares when they were cheap, not raising capital — and disclosure, such as per-patron data on movie theatres, information other companies provide.\n\n\"We have never operated as a group before with any other investment firm or individual, but I would be willing to talk and consider proposals from anyone inside or outside of Village Roadshow who seemed to have reasonable ideas on how to improve the business and thus its returns for shareholders,\" Mr Mittleman said.\n\n\"If reasonable prices can be obtained, the lower margin businesses like loyalty or marketing services and VREG for example, would be better off sold so capital could be redeployed into higher return assets.\"\n\nMr Mittleman said he did not support last year's $50 million capital raising because he believed previous assets sales had been enough to ease Village's debt problems. In 2017-18, Village reduced its net debt $527.1 million to $338.5 million.\n\nHe said Village's management should get credit for the returns on a 10-year and 15-year basis, but on a five-year basis they had been poor.\n\n\"The owner-operators here deserve some credit for those longer-term results which are very good, and some understanding given the Dreamworld related issues that were a large factor in the under-performance of the past two years. That said, I think EBITDA margin should be much higher for the corporation overall, given what competing businesses generate.\""
