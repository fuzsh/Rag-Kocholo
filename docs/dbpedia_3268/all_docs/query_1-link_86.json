        "text": "Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum's futuristic sci-fi thriller just got a little bit more futuristic.\n\nThe theatrical release of Jupiter Ascending, starring Tatum as a genetically engineered super-soldier charged with protecting a house cleaner who is actually destined to be queen of the world, has been unceremoniously bumped into next year.\n\nOriginally due in theaters July 18, the Wachowski siblings' latest big-budget spectacle now won't see big-screen time until Feb. 6, 2015.\n\nWarner Bros. and cofinancier Village Roadshow didn't give an official reason, but it's never the greatest sign when a seemingly finished movie gets delayed almost seven months.\n\nSee for reference: G.I. Joe: Retaliation (which also, coincidentally, costarred Tatum), et al.\n\nTatum isn't going to take much of a hit in the visibility department, the multifaceted star also having 22 Jump Street coming out June 13 and Foxcatcher due in theaters Nov. 14.\n\nMoreover, the 34-year-old actor, who just celebrated his daughter Everly's first birthday, is already garnering Oscar buzz for his role as real-life wrestling champ Mark Schultz in Foxcatcher, which just premiered at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nKunis, who's expecting her first child with fianc√© Ashton Kutcher, won't be back on the big screen until next year, minus the indie dramedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, currently out in limited release.\n\nWe'll just have to pay even more attention to her baby bump in the meantime."
