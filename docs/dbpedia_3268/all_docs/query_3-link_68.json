There is a depth and detail to this film that puts George Miller in a rarefied pantheon of directors. This film is his seminal work.\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” has a consistent theme and repeating symbolism that belies its simple exterior. It’s easy to miss amid the flamethrowers, and explosions and muscle cars; but it’s there.\n\nThe Players\n\nThe film follows “Mad” Max Rockatansky, played by Tom Hardy, who has been in the desert wasteland too long and is haunted by the memories of those he has failed.\n\nWhile we follow Max throughout the film, the real main character is Charlize Theron’s, Imperator Furiosa, a trusted general in Immortan Joe’s army."
