        "text": "Logo: On a black background, the text \"ROADSHOW TELEVISION\" is seen as the Roadshow V is drawn in the same way as the theatrical counterpart at the time, but quicker and the lines are drawn at the same time. The V shines and \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW CORPORATION\" appears below.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn some films from New World Pictures, the finished Roadshow logo would zoom out toward one of the segments used in the New World logo. The New World logo zooms out.\n\nOn some films from Orion Pictures, the Roadshow Television logo would zoom out, cheesily chroma-keyed onto the Orion starfield.\n\nOn some films from Carolco Pictures, the Roadshow Television logo would zoom out into the start of the Carolco logo.\n\nOn some films from the Rank Organisation, the Roadshow Television logo would zoom out to the center of the Rank Organisation gong.\n\nFX/SFX: The V being drawn in and the shining.\n\nMusic/Sounds: A shortened version of the Roadshow Films theme of the time. Unknown for the New World variant.\n\nAvailability: Ultra rare. The regular variant made surprise appearances on the SBS On-Demand print of Man of Flowers (which is no longer available for streaming) and the Umbrella Entertainment DVD of Dead Easy. The other variants are extinct, If you live in Australia or New Zealand,check those old tapes!\n\nEditor's Note: TBA\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(1992-2010)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/8e6b3fc1ea86683fb1e0d7127aa152bded6f9109\" width=\"231\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/077f07d51e7a31fcac3a146d373905410a197183\" width=\"242\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/9f4865fdc2226c8b90f4b38a2e52057878e81d14\" width=\"242\"></iframe><embed height=\"198\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/youtubevideo/8c09ae6063105f13c70e7f537b8bf7131b9abaeb\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"239\" wmode=\"transparent\"/><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/ba928f0cacd118fe385e289520a380ef30f32d3c\" width=\"246\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/19c097b24bab86b614c58c15bf1e8094615583eb\" width=\"237\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/d5f881ced9a769fe2c226f22f7f16c41aeef84cc\" width=\"237\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/fbf028991ac7ba63c37260a3eb11552458800382\" width=\"242\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/ac5f33d7f396a714b0a1cd188fdeb9ef30e2e84f\" width=\"242\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/0e058d0a800eb9fad4ff518284b04b384a558345\" width=\"242\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"140\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/af601de6ed6c34630c686b8311b9bc8940048363\" width=\"242\"></iframe>\n\nLogo: Same as the current Roadshow Entertainment logo, but with \"TELEVISION\" replacing \"ENTERTAINMENT\"\n\nVariants: Sometimes depending who released the film a transition appears after the logo had finished. These variations depended on who released the movie.\n\nMiramax Films/International: The logo sticks to the 'blue M' of the 1987 Miramax logo animation and fades away.\n\nNew Line Cinema: On both the prototype and then-current version of the 1994 logo, as well as the 1992 logo, the logo either zooms out or sticks to the back of the rectangle of the New Line logo.\n\nSpelling Films International: The logo transitions upwards by a cube effect. The second half of the pre-1995 Spelling logo plays.\n\nMorgan Creek: The logo becomes the background for the start of the 1991 Morgan Creek logo.\n\nCapella: The Roadshow logo zooms out into the start of the Capella logo.\n\nMandalay Entertainment: We zoom through a gap in one of the segments of the Roadshow logo into the short version of the Mandalay logo.\n\nBeacon: The Roadshow logo zooms to the top right of the screen towards the 1997 logo. While the light shines on the logo, the Roadshow logo fades out.\n\nNew Regency: The Roadshow logo runs either in warp or regular speed and folds down into the New Regency logo.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment: The Roadshow logo remains until the 1989 Castle Rock logo's beacon pushes the Roadshow logo away (which is a very cheap transition). Another version has the same concept as before, but with the 1994 \"Turner\" logo.\n\nIsland Pictures: The Roadshow logo zooms out while the animation from the Island logo starts during this transition.\n\nNew World Pictures: The Roadshow logo flips back into the start of the 1984 New World Pictures logo.\n\nRysher Entertainment: The Roadshow logo squeezes over to the '90s Rysher logo.\n\nCinergi Pictures: The Roadshow logo flies away with the rotating \"C\" of the Cinergi logo.\n\nCarolco Pictures: The Roadshow logo zooms out to the middle of the \"C\" in the Carolco logo once it has formed, then the tail end of the Carolco logo is sped-up.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the current Roadshow Entertainment logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the current Roadshow Entertainment logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants: The following music would play on the variations listed above\n\nMiramax Films/International: The Roadshow Films theme, the 1987 Miramax theme or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nNew Line Cinema: The Roadshow Films theme (which is sometimes re-orchestrated), the New Line Cinema music, the opening theme of the movie or oddly, the 1992-1995 Roadshow Entertainment theme.\n\nSpelling Films International: The Roadshow Films theme.\n\nMorgan Creek: The Roadshow Films theme or the Morgan Creek theme.\n\nCapella: The opening theme of the movie or the Roadshow Films theme.\n\nMandalay Entertainment: Either the long Mandalay music or the Roadshow Films music.\n\nBeacon: Silent Roadshow TV logo followed by the Beacon theme. Also can use the movie score.\n\nNew Regency: The opening theme of the movie, or (strangely) the previous logo's theme.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment: The Castle Rock Entertainment theme, the Roadshow Films theme, or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nIsland Pictures: The opening theme of the movie.\n\nNew World Pictures: The 1992-1995 Roadshow Entertainment Theme.\n\nRysher Entertainment: The Rysher music.\n\nCinergi Pictures: The Roadshow Films theme.\n\nCarolco Pictures: The theme from the 1988 Carolco Pictures logo."
