        "text": "Logo descriptions by mr3urious and LogoArchive\n\nLogo captures by LogoArchive and Eric S.\n\n1st Logo\n\n(December 5, 1985-June 30, 1992)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/unknown/82e48dd93375b138bdb28f284d2be1cba4c52cbe\" width=\"329\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"V of Gold\", \"Aussie V of Doom\", \"The Disappearing Byline\"\n\nLogo: Same as the Roadshow Films logo at the time, but the \"V\" is a darker shade of gold, the text \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" is farther from the \"V\" and the lasers don't form \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW CORPORATION\" and disappear instead.\n\nVariant: A still version exists.\n\nTrivia: This logo is based off the Roadshow Films logo of the era.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the Roadshow Films logo, minus the lasers forming the text. None for the still version.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the Roadshow Films logo, otherwise either silence or the opening theme of the trailer. When ran at 24 frames per second, the pitch is lower as opposed to PAL speed up.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. The still version was seen on trailers for Over the Hill (1992; can be found on the UK VHS of Strictly Ballroom) and Blood Oath (1990; can be found on the Australian VHS of The Fabulous Baker Boys). The full version (without music) has been spotted on an Stan HD print ofThe Delinquents(1989), while the Australian DVD has the 1998 logo in its place. A version in 4:3 with the jingle appears on the 1990 UK Warner Home Video VHS of the former.\n\nEditor's Note: This logo was generally extremely hard to find for the longest time, as most films VRP produced at the time did not use this logo and usually had the logo for the film's distributor, it wasn't until Stan HD's print of The Delinquents popped up, confirming what the logo was like. However, with the logo's discovery, many have found the inclusion of the lasers extremely pointless given there's no text for it to form.\n\n2nd Logo\n\n(March 8, 1992-July 1, 2000, April 10, 2003, September 14, 2007)\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"155\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/c829a72e35279ec55f835b5ce09e60a47ece1ac4\" width=\"273\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"155\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/beef9621abe4357a80219b720b587453c91e02b2\" width=\"273\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"155\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/69dd2645acbb2fcb45858e92dd4d322b98549a10\" width=\"274\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"The Other V of Steel\", \"V of Heaven\", \"Aussie V of Steel\"\n\nLogo: Same as the Roadshow Films logo of the time, but with \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" underneath the \"V\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThis logo can be cut short or still for TV shows and mini-series.\n\nThere is a variation where it just says \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW\".\n\nThe TV version might have the text \"A VILLAGE ROADSHOW COMPANY\".\n\nOn The New Adventures of Flipper S1 episode \"Treasure Hunt\", a blue toned version of the above variant exists.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the Roadshow Films logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The opening or closing theme of the show.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variants:\n\nOn Night Man, it has the Tribune Entertainment music.\n\nFor the \"Village Roadshow\" version, it's a shortened version of the Roadshow Films music.\n\nAvailability: For the most part, films produced by Village Roadshow that weren't distributed by them didn't use this logo, but the animated version is seen on The New Adventures of Flipper and Tarzan and the Lost City. The still version can be seen on the mini-series Thorn Birds: The Missing Years, Tales of the South Seas, and the TV show Night Man, among others. This also makes surprise appearances on Fat Pizza and December Boys. Don't expect this to appear on Fortress (1992).\n\nEditor's Note: TBA\n\n3rd Logo\n\n(October 16, 1998- )\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"170\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/40be767152333585ca22a52375ea7c82f507bf3e\" width=\"299\"></iframe><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"169\" src=\"http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/closinglogos/widget/genericvideo/7188baf0ef911402b4568d73acee47970216d1d0\" width=\"300\"></iframe>\n\nNicknames: \"The Other V of Steel II\", \"V of Heaven II\", \"Aussie V of Steel II\", \"Silver V of Steel\" (2012 variant)\n\nLogo: Sort of like the 1980s New World Pictures logo, we see rows of bars turning inward extremely close to the camera, from bottom to top. A spotlight lights up the background behind them. The spotlight fades as we zoom out to reveal the Roadshow logo in sky blue with a orange sheen on the left (different from the official logo). \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" fades in below.\n\nLater Variant: The font for \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" is now in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calibri\" target=\"_self\">Calibri</a> font instead of the corporate one, the entire logo was remade in higher quality, and the color was changed to silver. This variant was first used on Dark Shadows, released on May 11, 2012.\n\nFX/SFX: The forming of the \"V\", in great CGI done by yU+Co.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\nMarch 2, 2001-March 15, 2002: A shortened version of the Roadshow Films theme. First heard on See Spot Run.\n\nFebruary 10, 2006-April 20, 2012: The 1996 Roadshow Entertainment theme. First heard on Firewall.\n\nFebruary 24, 2016-: A nice orchestral tune. First heard on The Brothers Grimsby.\n\nOn Rogue, the 2006 theme is high-toned.\n\nMost of the time, it's silent or it uses the film's opening soundtrack.\n\nAvailability: Very common. Appears on many movies produced by Village Roadshow since 1998 like Cats & Dogs, Three to Tango, Happy Feet, Zoolander, and No Reservations, among others. It first appeared on Practical Magic. The last film to use the original variant was The Lucky One, released on April 20, 2012.\n\nEditor's Note: TBA"
