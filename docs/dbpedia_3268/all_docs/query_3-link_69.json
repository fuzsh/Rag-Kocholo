        "text": "Village Roadshow could be forced to offload its struggling movie production business, behind films such as Zoolander and Ocean's 8, with members of the wealthy Kirby family that controls the sprawling entertainment heavyweight feuding over the best way to restore its lacklustre performance.\n\nJohn Kirby — the older of two brothers who control the outfit founded by their father, Roc Kirby — is pushing for a sell-off of the company’s film production business and the removal of long-time chief executive Graham Burke, according to sources familiar with his plans.\n\nThe changes would include the sale of Village Roadshow's British marketing business, its stake in the American iPic Theatres premium cinema outfit, and its Hollywood holdings.\n\nVillage Roadshow has lost more than $500 million in market value over the past five years, with its share price crashing from $7.15 to as little as $1.77 in July.\n\nMr Kirby, a former Village Roadshow executive, late last year engaged former Rothschild & Co investment banker David Kingston and major Melbourne commercial law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler to push for major changes at the company, which is chaired by his brother Robert Kirby.\n\nRobert Kirby opposes the changes, according to board sources.\n\nThe Kirby brothers have been mainstays of Australian rich lists, with a fortune of more than $500 million tied closely to the value of their investment in Village Roadshow.\n\nAlong with Mr Burke, the brothers own a combined 42 per cent stake in the company.\n\nThe bitter family feud could reshape the company, which owns a string of cinemas in Victoria, operates Warner Brothers Movie World, Sea World and Wet ‘n’ Wild Gold Coast, and runs a studio where Aquaman and Thor: Ragnarok were filmed, among other productions.\n\nLoading\n\nVillage Roadshow was forced last year to write down to zero its investment in Hollywood film production house Village Roadshow Pictures even though it has been responsible for blockbuster movies including Ocean’s 8, The Lego Movie, The Great Gatsby and Zoolander.\n\nVillage Roadshow Pictures, after a period of financial difficulty, is now controlled by American private equity outfits Vine Alternative Investments and Falcon Investment Advisors.\n\nJohn Kirby resigned as a Village Roadshow executive in 2015.\n\nThe value of the ASX-listed company dived from $1.2 billion in 2014 to just $370 million at the end of the last financial year, when Village Roadshow was forced to put Wet ‘n’ Wild Sydney up for auction.\n\nJohn Kirby declined to comment but Mr Kingston confirmed his appointment and told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that \"the cinemas and theme parks are quality assets\".\n\n\"[However], they have been diluted by too much focus on Village's film and distribution investments and other non-core assets,\" said Mr Kingston, who runs K Capital. \"Village would benefit from an independent chairman and the injection of some new senior management.\"\n\nMr Burke has been chief executive for almost 30 years, well beyond the average tenure of bosses of publicly-listed companies.\n\nLoading\n\nIt is understood Arnold Bloch Leibler, which assisted Solomon Lew’s Premier Investments in its pursuit of department store chain Myer, has provided advice on Village Roadshow’s corporate governance arrangements.\n\nRobert Kirby’s son Clarke is also involved in the business, now managing Village Roadshow’s theme park operations, and has been tipped as a possible successor to head the company.\n\nJohn Kirby's and Mr Kingston’s preference would be to bring in an independent executive to run the company if Mr Burke departs.\n\nSince Mr Kingston's appointment, considerable pressure has been brought to cut costs and capital expenditure, pushing the share price to $2.94, its highest point since April last year.\n\nMr Burke said John Kirby was a \"very disgruntled and bitter individual\" and pointed to a recovery in the theme park business to highlight a \"dramatic turnaround\" for Village Roadshow.\n\n\"The board has full confidence in management,\" Mr Burke said.\n\nHe said the company had endured two difficult years due to an \"act of God\" following the 2016 Thunder River Rapids tragedy at Dreamworld.\n\n\"We are on a very positive trajectory as demonstrated by the ticket sales of the most important category, which is the annual and multi-day passes,\" he said."
