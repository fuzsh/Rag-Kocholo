Earth is a more-or-less forgotten backwater, colonized ages ago and owned by a wealthy family known as the House of Abrasax. They're like a high-end, malevolent cosmetics company: Their top seller is an anti-wrinkle elixir that I think is called Soylent Cream.\n\nJupiter learns most of this after competing teams of mercenaries show up to abduct her. It seems her DNA is a perfect match for the dead Abrasax matriarch, which makes her rightful heir to the entire Earth. (Yes, even Donald Trump's holdings.) The dead queen's three children, who have been nursing Oedipal complexes for several millennia, are busy scheming for ways to relieve her of her planetary holdings.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLooking out for Jupiter's wellbeing - and calling her \"your majesty\" in velvety tones that make her weak in the knees - is Caine Wise (Channing Tatum).\n\nHe's a wolf/human hybrid whose preferred method of transportation is a pair of anti-gravity boots that make him look like an NHL player on an endless breakaway.\n\nThe ice metaphor is a useful one, because Jupiter Ascending spends most of its 127-minute running time skating on the edge of incomprehensibility.\n\nSean Bean shows up as a soldier named Stinger to explain to Jupiter that bees can recognize her as the one true ruler of Earth. (Ever been stung by a bee? No? Greetings, your highness!) Terry Gilliam gets a cameo in a scene set in a bureaucratic office that he also apparently designed. A million years of technological evolution and they're still using filing cabinets?\n\nThere are robot soldiers whose limbs are weapons - their arms are in fact arms - as well as talking lizards, invisible flying motorcycles (not something you see every day) and an industrial complex on Jupiter - the planet, not the character - that makes Cloud City from The Empire Strikes Back look tiny.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nTatum's character, meanwhile, has clearly been watching a lot of old Superman movies, given his habit of swooping in at the last second to rescue Jupiter from certain death.\n\nOne such instance kicks off the best property-destroying streetsof-Chicago chase scene since The Blues Brothers, but the filmmakers don't know when to say \"Cut!\" What would have been a thrilling set piece at four minutes gets downright boring as it passes twice that length.\n\nJupiter Ascending is full of individual shots that will wow viewers, like the image of a spaceship rising like a surfacing submarine through the icy Jovian rings.\n\nBut the screenplay is stuffed full of so many half-baked ideas that the mind stops reeling and starts sleeping. Spacesuit in a briefcase! Classic grey aliens! Holograms! A robot advocate named Bob! Funny how quickly an embarrassment of riches can turn into a richness of embarrassment.\n\nPerhaps the Wachowskis should have done some more cutting. Or pulled a Matrix and spun this into a trilogy. Something tells me such a threefor-one deal would have been like a pizza party special - more cheese but no additional flavour.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
