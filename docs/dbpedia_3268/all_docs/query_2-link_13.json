        "text": "Background\n\nRoadshow Films was created by the owners of Village Cinemas in 1970 and has become a leading distributor in Australia. They are most notable for distributing classic Australian films in the 90s including The Dish, Muriel's Wedding and the Australian classic The Castle. Today, they distribute a number of films from different Hollywood studios as well as Australian productions.\n\n1st Logo (1971-1979)\n\nVisuals: There is a satellite shot of Earth as it appears from outer space, covered in clouds, and pointed so that Southeast Asia and Oceania are in view. The camera eases in gradually towards a still satellite shot of Australia as the shot rotates clockwise, bringing the island into view. Once we finish the zoom, \"A film from\" zooms out in a white serif font. Then \"Roadshow\", in a white font, zooms out below, followed by \"The Australian Company\" in the same white serif font below that.\n\nVariant: Two shortened versions exist. One starts when the zoom is almost finished, and the other starts as the words zoom out. The latter version would also be used for their television prints.\n\nTechnique: Simple zoom effects.\n\nAudio: A grand, rising orchestral fanfare featuring an organ and electric piano, which starts off quiet but becomes more powerful over time, ending with a cymbal crash. This is truncated for the first shortened version. Otherwise, the opening theme of the movie plays over it. For the television version, it's usually the closing theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability:\n\nTurns up on the Umbrella Entertainment DVD of The Love Epidemic (part of an Ozplotation double feature with High Rollin).\n\nIt was also probably seen on the earliest prints of Mad Max and The Wanderers and also showed up on a 1985 Australian television broadcast of the latter.\n\nIt was also spotted on the Dutch Standard Video VHS release of Faces of Death. Roadshow Films had intended to release the film theatrically in Australia, though the film ended up being banned by the Australian censorship board. How this print ended up on a Dutch VHS release is unknown.\n\nOther movies where this might have appeared include Beyond the Living Dead (also known by such names as Return of the Zombies, Terror of the Living Dead, and The Hanging Woman elsewhere) and Stone.\n\nThe full version is only known to exist on a 35mm print housed by a private collector.\n\n2nd Logo (1979-1986)\n\nVisuals: On a space background, a blue outline of Australia with the Tasmania island below zooms out from the bottom of the screen to the centre with a \"light trail\" effect. \"Roadshow\", in a yellow font (the same font, in fact, as in the previous logo, but with more bold), appears via \"scanning\" effect in pieces shooting out from the Australia. The completed logo shines and reverses onto Australia and \"The Australian Company\" appears in yellow via a flashing effect below \"Roadshow\".\n\nTechnique: Backlit animation.\n\nAudio: A calm, synthesized horn and piano fanfare.\n\nAvailability: It was seen theatrically in Australia during this time period.\n\nHas turned up on early Roadshow Home Video tapes of Mad Max and Megaforce, though most movies from Roadshow have edited this logo out and went straight to the movie itself.\n\nOther films that had this logo in their theatrical release include First Blood, Scanners, and Gallipoli.\n\n3rd Logo (1985-1992)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, three stylized, separate, golden \"V\"s are formed by yellow flashing effects from the right side. Three more are formed, filling the gaps. The result is a giant \"V\", or a triangle comprised of six progressively smaller \"V\"s. The giant \"V\" zooms out a little, and the big glowing text \"ROADSHOW\", in a white ITC Avant Garde Gothic font, slides in below the \"V\" and loses the glow. The \"V\" shines, and yellow \"lazers\" appear from the top-left and top-right corners of the screen and move below the text, forming \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW CORPORATION\" when they connect and disappear.\n\nVariant: Widescreen and scope versions of this logo exist, alongside an open-matte variant.\n\nTechnique: Traditional cel animation.\n\nAudio: A synth stinger accompanied by a synthesized phasing sound and a laser sound.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThis logo was only seen theatrically in Australia during this time period as the logo is either plastered with the Roadshow Television logo on Australian television prints, or got erased from Australian VHS releases of their movies entirely.\n\nHowever, it did appear on an Australian television print of The Miami Connection as late as 1997 (12 years after this logo's debut, 10 years after the film's release, and just five after their next one succeeding it).\n\nLegacy: This is considered to be the rarest Australian logo on the wiki. The Home Video variant is much easier to come across.\n\n4th Logo (1992-)\n\nVisuals: A chrome curve comes from the right of screen. The curve then moves down, turning out to be the large \"V\", and several more segments appear. They all zoom back to reveal the logo same as before, but chrome. Underneath the word \"ROADSHOW\" along with a line separating the byline \"A VILLAGE ROADSHOW COMPANY\" fade in.\n\nVariants:\n\nAround 2009, the text changed to just \"ROADSHOW FILMS\". No byline is present.\n\nIn later years, the logo has a darker tone.\n\nLike with the previous logo, widescreen and scope versions of this logo exist, alongside an open-matte version.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A calm, echoing 12-note electronic piano tune. In later years, the sound, for some reason, is in mono.\n\nAvailability: This is mainly seen theatrically in both Australia and New Zealand."
