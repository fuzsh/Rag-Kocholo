Maybe it was the wormhole galactic travel or overblown melodrama or talking lizard-people.\n\nOr maybe it was just Mila Kunis playing a queen of the galaxy and falling madly in love with Channing Tatum’s “splice” of a man and a wolf, creating a gravity-boots wearing, pointy-eared bodyguard who looks like an angry elf in black leather with the facial hair of a Renaissance Faire weekend volunteer.\n\nI just know that “Jupiter Ascending” is my first guilty pleasure of the year, and like a Snickers bar, it’s deliciously gooey and nutty at the same time.\n\nThe romance is unabashed. The revenge factor and royal sibling deceptions are unabashed. The new science-fiction fantasy from the Wachowskis, the filmmaking family that created “The Matrix” and has been trying to top it ever since, is totally unabashed.\n\nBeyond the “Matrix” sequels and their recent “Cloud Atlas,” the Wachowskis’ new film has more of an eye toward giving its audience a swashbuckling adventure set among the stars that it can have a bit of mindless fun with, while still creating a world with a dense mythology.\n\n“Jupiter Ascending” is pure space opera, in the “Star Wars” sense of the word, mixed with Old Hollywood backstabbing dramas set during the Roman Empire, and with a pinch of humor that occasionally connects when it’s not making us groan.\n\nAs Kunis’ character tells of her affection for him, and Tatum’s character admits that his being a “splice” makes him have more in common with a dog than humans, her response is a hot-mess hoot.\n\n“I love dogs,” she confesses, ogling him with the eyes of a puppy. “I’ve always loved dogs.”\n\nKunis plays Jupiter Jones, a young woman who won the genetic lottery, for better or worse, and whose world is turned upside down when a galactic protector named Caine (Tatum) whisks her away from bounty hunters.\n\nIt turns out that we’re not alone in the universe, and the royal family siblings of a gene-altering race on a planet far, far away has learned that Jupiter is the reincarnation of their mother, and that development could shake up who among them becomes the new heir to a little planet called Earth.\n\nThat royal family consists of a ruthless older brother, Balem, played by Eddie Redmayne, the odds-on best-actor favorite for “The Theory of Everything” as Steven Hawking, who clearly received the memo that any acting done in this film is to be a case of overacting.\n\nCavorting in capes and waving his hand in the air as if he just doesn’t care, Redmayne passively mumbles his dialogue when he’s not aggressively exploding in “Kill the girl!!” anger.\n\nThen there’s the sister, Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), who reveals the ugly truth behind the fight for possession of the Earth (a life-sucking “human harvesting” that can provide the owner a fountain-of-youth effect, or incredible profits, or both).\n\nFinally, there’s the younger brother, a randy fellow played by Douglas Booth who enjoys a good PG-13 orgy when he’s not plotting a marriage to Jupiter for his own devious plan.\n\nThese siblings appear to have come from an old “Spartacus” or “Gladiator” plotline of Roman power-brokers stabbing one another in the back in pursuit of influence and wealth.\n\nThat’s when they’re not kidnapping Jupiter away from one another in this world full of genetically altered servants ranging from talking animals to humans with a touch of something animalistic in their background, considering the size of their ears or eyes.\n\nAs is often the case with the Wachowskis, they have their own ears and eyes tuned to creating a massive, theatrical world for their story to take place in (reminding me here of the very fun “The Fifth Element”), rather than constructing any real depth of characterization.\n\nThere are many co-starring characters introduced amid all the royal politics and rescue attempts, but even Kunis and Tatum look lost often enough that they seem to know their characters are simply in service to the Wachowskis’ world of wonders and battles beyond the stars.\n\nBut enjoy that world for its off-kilter offerings, like the filmmakers showing that some things never change throughout the galaxy — such as an inspired moment of bureaucratic madness at an alien government office that could have come from director Terry Gilliam’s satire “Brazil.”\n\nWho’s that behind the counter? Why yes, it is Terry Gilliam.\n\nMichael Smith 918-581-8479\n\nmichael.smith@tulsaworld.com\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
