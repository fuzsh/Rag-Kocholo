        "text": "LAST ROADSHOW\n\nJoel Pearlman, one of the best-known names in Australian cinema, is to step down from his role as CEO of Roadshow Films after 30 years with the Village Roadshow organization.\n\nPearlman’s tenure saw him oversee the organization as built a diverse slate from local and global studios, licensors, and production companies including Warner Bros, Lionsgate, Village Roadshow Pictures, A24, FilmNation, Made Up Stories and Arenamedia. He was also instrumental in Village Roadshow’s purchase of a 31% stake in financier and sales agent FilmNation and the establishment of television drama producer Roadshow Rough Diamond in association with John and Dan Edwards.\n\n“It is a bittersweet decision to move on to a new adventure,” Pearlman said. “I am incredibly appreciative for the support from Village Roadshow CEO Clark Kirby, Village Roadshow chair Robert Kirby and also former CEO Graham Burke.”\n\nRoadshow’s upcoming slate includes the Midnight Oil documentary “The Hardest Line,” which will open the Sydney Film Festival next week, the reboot of “The Crow,” Michael Gracey’s Robbie Williams biopic “Better Man” which opens in Australia on Dec. 26, and Lionsgate’s John Wick spin off “Ballerina.”\n\nWHIRLWIND\n\nNetflix is set to upload “The Whirlwind,” one of its prestige Korean series titles. The 12-part show, which debuts on June 28, depicts a gripping clash of power between a morally upright prime minister and the ambitious deputy minister for economic affairs. The roles are portrayed by Sul Kyung-gu (“Yaksha: Ruthless Operations,” “Kill Boksoon”) and Kim Hee-ae (“Queenmaker,” “The World of the Married”), respectively. Amid their power struggle, the president is assassinated – triggering a political storm that kicks off their story.\n\nWatch the trailer here."
