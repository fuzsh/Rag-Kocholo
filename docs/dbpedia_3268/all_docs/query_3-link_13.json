        "text": "The following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nWhen you think of the “Ocean’s Trilogy,” you think of big movie stars, high stakes, and witty banter. These are individuals known for being con-artists and having a certain set of skills, but they bring an element of fun to the proceedings. They are interesting, layered, and unique. These are not your bargain basement crooks and thieves. These films are also aided by the direction of the stellar Steven Soderbergh. He makes everything pop and sizzle on screen. He knows how to add just the right amount of style to these films without taking away from his ensemble cast. The beauty of a Soderbergh film is the fact he can dabble in a number of genres and make a film successful both commercially and financially. He’s not just pigeonholing himself into one type of film. He can do an independent film that gets people talking or he can do blockbuster films like the “Ocean’s Trilogy.”\n\nLet’s start with “Ocean’s Eleven,” which is, of course, a remake of the 1960 film starring Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. I don’t think it is fair to compare these two films as they are forty years apart, but I will say that both are entertaining and sleek in their own ways. Remakes in general tend to get a bad rap, but when they are done with the right people involved and the right mindset, they can really deliver the goods. It’s about taking an idea and making it your own without copying from the original source material. This is not always easy to accomplish, but they did that with “Ocean’s Eleven” in 2001.\n\nThe charming George Clooney stars as Danny Ocean, a professional thief who has recently been released from prison. Even though he served time, he’s on the lookout for his next big caper. Once he gets involved with the thrill of the chase and the risk and reward that comes with it, it’s hard to turn it down or live a normal lifestyle after that. He meets up with an old partner named Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), and they are looking to hit up Las Vegas for their next big heist. When it comes to a heist like this, money is important. They end up securing the money from Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould), and their plan is to rob three casinos in Las Vegas, which are owned by Tishkoff’s rival. The stakes are high, at $160 million, so they need to make sure they are on their A-game.\n\nIn order for Danny and Rusty to pull this off, they will need to assemble the right team. They enlist the help of Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison), Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), and Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan). Every one of them brings something unique and special to the table. Julia Roberts also shows up as the Danny Ocean’s ex-wife, Tess, and she has a bone to pick with Danny. Andy Garcia is in the film as well as Terry Benedict, the owner of the three casinos they are trying to rip off in the film.\n\nFor my money, “Ocean’s Eleven” is the best of the three films. The pacing is terrific, and there is never a dull moment in the film. Even though there are a lot of moving pieces, it never feels like the movie is overstuffed, boring or too long as it moves at a brisk pace. Also, when you have top-notch actors and actresses together, you know you are going to get some great performances. A big part of the fun of these films is seeing these Hollywood legends go toe-to-toe with one another.\n\nMoving onto “Ocean’s Twelve,” which came out in 2004, I don’t want to go into too much detail on this film just in case you are watching this trilogy in order for the first time. I will say I found it to be a little bit more of a slog to sit through and a bit of a letdown after “Ocean’s Eleven.” It was merely an OK film. It was successful at the box office, but I didn’t find the story as engaging this time around. Of course, the characters are still entertaining and fun to spend time with, but since there isn’t a great story or plot to drive them, they quickly run out of steam here. It ends up being one of those films where the cast had a lot more fun making it than we had watching it.\n\nIn 2007, they came back with “Ocean’s Thirteen” which introduced Al Pacino to the proceedings and was once again directed by Soderbergh. Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones are missing here, which makes this film feel a bit off in regards to the female-male ratio. Roberts, especially, was such a big part of the first film, and Zeta-Jones was also very charming and lit up the screen in “Ocean’s Twelve.”\n\n“Ocean’s Thirteen,” however, is a nice return to form after the lackluster and underwhelming “Ocean’s Twelve.” It’s almost as if Soderbergh sat down and realized what was missing from the last film and made sure to make up for those mistakes this time around. The addition of Al Pacino to the mix is also a juicy twist as well. What I enjoyed most about “Ocean’s Thirteen” is how it brought back the fun factor from the first film. “Ocean’s Twelve” was an entertaining film at times, but it was also a lazy one as well. This time, they work on making sure the fun is included along with a story that can hold its own in the process.\n\nWhen these films work best in this franchise, it is when they realize we are just as interested in the story as we are in the characters. They go hand-in-hand. They play off each other in a sense. We love to see the characters in action and find out all of the twists and turns along the way. It was clear they put time, effort and brains into the first and third films. They lost their way a little in “Ocean’s Twelve,” which feels like a sequel they didn’t put a ton of thought into.\n\n“Ocean’s Eleven” – * * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n“Ocean’s Twelve” – * * out of * * * *\n\n“Ocean’s Thirteen” – * * * out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: The “Ocean’s Trilogy” is released on a three-disc 4K set from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. This set only includes the 4K discs, so if you are looking for Blu-rays and 4Ks together, you will not find them here. According to the press release, the 4K remasters of “Ocean’s Eleven,” “Ocean’s Twelve” and “Ocean’s Thirteen” were completed at Warner Brothers Discovery’s Motion Picture Imaging (MPI) with the participation of Soderbergh. All of the films are rated PG-13, and their respective running times are 116 minutes, 125 minutes and 122 minutes. There is also a digital copy for each film which allows you to own all three copies of the trilogy. Subtitles are included in English, Spanish, and French.\n\nVideo Info: I really like the look of these movies on 4K. Having previously seen “Contagion” on 4K, also from Soderbergh, I’m happy to report this is another fantastic looking 4K set. Its color is vivid, bright and filled with a lot of life. It’s also dark and mysterious when things turn up a notch. All three of the films look great on 4K.\n\nAudio Info: There is a lot of talking in these films as they are going over plans and information, and the dialogue comes in crystal clear on all three films. The soundtrack is just right in covering the dialogue, music and background noise without being too distracting. It captures the essence of each film.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n“Ocean’s Eleven”\n\n• Commentary by Steven Soderbergh and Ted Griffin\n\n• Commentary by Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia\n\n• Are You In or Out? The Making of Ocean’s Eleven\n\n• Pros & Cons: Inside Ocean’s Outfit\n\n• The Style of Steal\n\n• The Look of the Con\n\n• Original Ocean’s, Original Cool\n\n“Ocean’s Twelve”\n\n• Commentary by Steven Soderbergh and George Nolfi\n\n• Ready, Jet Set, Go: The Making of Ocean’s Twelve\n\n• HBO First Look: Twelve Is the New Eleven: The Making of Ocean’s Twelve\n\n• Deleted Scenes\n\n“Ocean’s Thirteen”\n\n• Commentary by Steven Soderbergh, Brian Koppelman and David Levien\n\n• Third’s a Charm: The Making of Ocean’s Thirteen\n\n• Ahab with a Piggyback: The Means & Machines of Ocean’s\n\n• Jerry Weintraub Walk and Talk\n\n• Masters of the Heist\n\n• Deleted Scenes\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nI’m seeing this set go for about $55 right now online, which is a really good price. That’s a little less than $20 for each 4K. If you enjoy a good movie collection, this one is definitely recommended. You get all of the old special features included here along with updated 4K transfers on these films as well. These are 4K transfers where it is clear they put a lot of care and effort into them. They didn’t just throw them together. If you enjoy heist movies with great casts, you really can’t go wrong with this trilogy. I’d recommend you go out and buy this set right now at its current price. You can make a weekend out of watching all three films and really enjoy yourself.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nOut of all the films I watched in 2014, “American Sniper” was the one which hit me the hardest. I had never seen a film like it before, and I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did, considering I’m not a huge fan of war films. This is much more than a war film, though. It’s a personal story, and this part of the film resonated with me much more than any shootings. Although there is one particular shooting that made me wince, Chris Kyle was only doing what he was trained to do as a Navy Seal.\n\nBradley Cooper stars as Chris Kyle in one of the best performances of his career. Not only did he put on the weight to play Kyle, but he completely became him. On the special features, they talked about how they would have moments on set that would cause goosebumps because his performance was so true to life. It’s always a thing of beauty when you see an actor completely devote themselves to a role and a film. It helps that the film was directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood. There’s also a quality screenplay by Jason Hall, adapted from Kyle’s book of the same name.\n\nKyle believes strongly in America and goes through some intense training that would make most men run for the hills, but he eventually becomes a sniper for the Navy Seals. Before he even attempts to do this, someone informs him that most men quit. Kyle says he is no quitter. Meanwhile, he meets his wife, Taya, played by Sienna Miller, and they eventually have a child together, adding even more pressure to Kyle’s life. He ends up taking part in four tours, which puts a strain on their relationship and his well-being. He knows he is doing a service to his country and protecting his fellow men, but that doesn’t make things any easier.\n\nOne of the things I admired the most about this film was the patience in which it was filmed. Kyle ends up doing four tours, and we get to see the tours along with him spending time with his family. For me, the “at home” scenes were far more effective than his time as a sniper. This is not to take anything away from his time on tour and how it’s filmed. The scenes are jarring and extremely well shot. I’m just always more engrossed in the human side of the story, and that truly adds more to what’s happening during his time becoming “The Legend”, a nickname he seems proud of at times, but also a little uneasy about as well. He is known as the U.S.’s deadliest sniper.\n\nA lot of attention and praise was put on Cooper upon the film’s release, but credit also goes out to Miller as she has an extremely tough role to portray as well as Taya. She has to be supportive of her husband while also looking out for the best interests of her family. One thing is certain: her love for Kyle never waivers. She just worries about feeling disconnected from him. It’s clear he’s not the same when everything is over. How can he be? As he tells his psychiatrist, he thinks more about the men he couldn’t save as opposed to the ones he did. However, Taya wants her husband back, and she wants the man she married. The ability to disconnect from the war is a hard one, and that is explored in great detail in this magnificent film.\n\n“American Sniper” made my list of the top ten films of 2014, and it is also one of the best films Eastwood has ever directed. Everyone watches movies for various reasons. I watch movies to be moved and engrossed by great stories and fascinating people. On my third viewing, I’m happy to report “American Sniper” holds up incredibly well. It’s also enhanced by the 4K transfer Warner Brothers has added to the film as well. It was released a few years before 4K discs became a reality, and with this being the ten-year anniversary of the film, it’s a great time to add it to your collection and upgrade the Blu-ray if you already own it.\n\n* * * * out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “American Sniper” is released on a single 4K disc from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. It also comes with a digital copy of the film as well. The film runs at 132 minutes and is rated R for strong and disturbing war violence, and language throughout including some sexual references.\n\nVideo Info: “American Sniper” on 4K really takes you into the heat of battle. I did mention that the war scenes didn’t hit me as emotionally as the sequences between Chris and Taya, but they still had their impact nonetheless. You would have to be a rock to not be moved and affected by what’s happening on screen. All of it is shot with just the right number of colors and texture. It’s sort of a dreary looking film, but that is to be expected with war.\n\nAudio Info: The Dolby Atmos soundtrack is also an improvement over the inconsistent audio on the previously released Blu-ray of the film, which was a bit too loud at times. This time, it’s right on cue throughout the entire film. It was also fairly consistent during the quieter moments as well.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nOne Soldier’s Story: The Journey of American Sniper\n\nChris Kyle: The Man Behind the Legend\n\nClint Eastwood: A Cinematic Legacy – The Heart of a Hero\n\nNavy SEALs: In War and Peace\n\nBringing the War Home: The Cost of Heroism\n\nThe Making of American Sniper\n\nGuardian\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\n“American Sniper” is finally on 4K, and it was well worth the wait. The technical aspects are amazing, as they usually are with a Clint Eastwood film, especially on 4K. Bradley Cooper turns in an astounding performance and one which really hit me like a ton of bricks. Sienna Miller also turns in an underrated and potent performance as well. This is a film firing on all cylinders, and it will make a great addition to your physical media collection. This is top-notch filmmaking and a film that comes from a labor of love from everyone involved. When you have films like this one, the audience is the ultimate winner. The special features are also ported over the Blu-ray release as well, and they add a lot of context and information on the making of the film and Chris Kyle’s backstory. This is a day-one purchase, especially with the impressive slipcover which is included with this release.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nConfession time: I have not seen any of the live-action films based on the Roald Dahl novel, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” I have not seen “Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory” or the aforementioned “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” I do think this puts me in an ideal position because I have no frame of reference when reviewing this film, “Wonka.” I’ve often said any film that has source material attached to it should be able to stand on its own two feet and appeal to an audience which has no history with the characters or the story itself. Ideally, you are looking to make a film that will appeal to those who have seen the other films and read the novel, and also to those who are going into it with fresh eyes. That’s the main goal.\n\nWilly Wonka is played here by Timothée Chalamet in a brilliant performance which is able to portray both the sweet and eccentric side of the main character. If he went too far into the latter, it would have been rather off-putting and too peculiar. However, he does a great job of balancing the tender side of the character and also the quirkiness. It’s a great performance. Wonka has many skills in his arsenal (magic and innovation), but the skill he is most proud of is his ability to create chocolate that is creative, delicious, and brings people together. He’s looking to start up his chocolate empire, but he’s met with strong resistance by what is known as the Chocolate Cartel.\n\nThe Chocolate Cartel is a group of three men who have a monopoly on the chocolate industry, and they are not looking to share it with Mr. Wonka anytime soon. The group includes Arthur Slugworth (Paterson Joseph), Gerald Prodnose (Matt Lucas) and Felix Fickelgruber (Mathew Baynton). Once they catch wind of his arrival, they want to do whatever it takes to put an end to his budding chocolate industry. Luckily for them, Wonka finds himself stuck in a terrible contract due to his inability to read. Because of this one-sided contract, he must spend 27 years and 16 days at Mrs. Scrubitt’s (Olivia Colman) laundry house, which she runs with her evil goon Bleacher (Tom Davis).\n\nWhile working in the Wash House, Wonka befriends an orphan named Noodle, played by Calah Lane. Together, they hope to help each other out, as Noodle is looking for information on her family, and Wonka wants to make his chocolate store a reality, which was inspired by his close bond with his late mother, played by Sally Hawkins. There is also a bookkeeper in the Wash House named Abacus Crunch (Jim Carter), Lottie Bell (Rakhee Thakrar), a telephone operator, Piper Benz (Natasha Rothwell), a plumber, and a former comedian Larry Chucklesworth (Rich Fulcher). They have also fallen prey to the evil contracts doled out by Mrs. Scrubitt. If they can work together, they might be able to turn things around and get out from not only their contracts, but also from the Chocolate Cartel as well.\n\nAnother thing the Cartel has going for it is the chief of police (Keegan-Michael Key) has a strong addiction to chocolate, so it’s quite easy to pay him off and keep him from doing his job with any sense of dignity or honor. They must also contend with Lofty, an Oompa Loompa, played brilliantly by Hugh Grant. At first, Noodle is hesitant to believe he actually exists, as the idea of a little orange man with green hair is hard to fathom. However, Lofty believes he was wronged, so he will do whatever it takes to get what he believes he is owed from Wonka. Hugh Grant makes the most of each and every scene he’s on screen with this deadpan timing and delivery. It’s a treat whenever he’s on screen.\n\n“Wonka” is a film I ended up enjoying a lot more than I thought I would when I started watching it. I think it helped that I really had no idea what to expect or any type of preconceived notions, whatsoever. I found the film to be absolutely delightful. They did a great job in casting as, top-to-bottom, this is an all-star cast of actors. It really starts with Timothée Chalamet as Wonka, however. If he came across as too goofy or too silly, the film would have failed. However, this is the best performance I’ve seen from him in his young career. It also helps that there is a tremendously sweet friendship between his character and Noodle. The way their friendship grows and blossoms is moving and genuine.\n\n“Wonka” has a lot going for it. The musical aspect of the film is top-notch, and there are memorable songs that come in at just the right moments, whether they are used to brighten up the mood and make you laugh or whether they are used during a more introspective moment. The bad guys are deliciously evil and a lot of fun. The friendships come together organically. Much like a great bar of chocolate, all of the ingredients here are working together as one. It also helps that the film takes its time in allowing the audience to get to know the characters and their intentions. Everyone serves a purpose here.\n\nThis is a patient film, as mentioned. and it is better because of it. We get to go along on the journey with Wonka and all of the characters who inhabit this world. I enjoyed every single character and actor for what they brought to this project. This could have easily been a throwaway film where it was done just to make a profit without paying attention to quality. There is a lot of craft and love here, and it shows on screen. “Wonka” warmed the cockles of my heart. It’s sure to put a big smile on your face, just like it did it for me.\n\n* * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “Wonka” is released on a single 4K disc from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. The film has a running time of 116 minutes and is rated PG for some violence, mild language, and thematic elements. It also comes with a digital code for the film.\n\nVideo Info: We are treated to a beautiful Dolby Vision transfer on this release of “Wonka.” This is a bright and beautiful film with eye-popping visuals that really lend itself to the 4K format. I was very impressed with the colors and the level of detail on this transfer.\n\nAudio Info: We get a Dolby Atmos audio track here as well, which sounds terrific. Considering this film is a musical, we want to be able to enjoy the music to the fullest. We are able to do that here thanks to audio which is clean and very vibrant.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nUnwrapping Wonka: Paul King’s Vision\n\nThe Whimsical Music of Wonka\n\nWelcome to Wonka Land\n\nHats Off to Wonka\n\nWonka’s Chocolatier\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nIf you enjoyed the “Paddington” films, which were directed by “Wonka’s” Paul King, you should definitely buy this 4K release of “Wonka” as soon as it’s released. It’s very clear by now that King is a British director who knows how to make films that are going to appeal to children and adults, which is very difficult to pull off. He has it figured out and it’s on full display here with this nearly perfect motion picture. Film, to me, is at its best when I’m able to feel something emotionally and also laugh in equal measure. From an audio and visual perspective, the 4K gets an easy A here. We also get a few special features as well. So far, 2024 has been a slow year for 4K releases, but “Wonka” has set the standard early on for this year. This one comes highly recommended!\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nIt has been a long time since I have sat down and watched “Training Day” from start to finish. Upon hearing about its 4K release from the fine folks over at Warner Brothers, I was looking forward to sitting down and revisiting it and seeing how it would hold up twenty-two years later. Denzel Washington can always be counted on to give a powerful performance, and he does not disappoint here in a role that earned him an Oscar. Ethan Hawke is one of Hollywood’s most underrated actors, and the pairing of these two together was something I looked forward to with great anticipation. When you throw in the direction of Antoine Fuqua, a frequent collaborator with Washington, everything seemed to be in order for a great film.\n\n“Training Day” opens up by introducing the audience to Jake Hoyt, played by Hawke. Jake is a young up-and-comer on the police force who is looking to make a name for himself in the Los Angeles Police Department. But before he’s considered for a promotion, Jake must spend a day under the watchful eye of Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) who will see if he’s cut out for the big leagues. Jake is looking to clean up the streets and get rid of the drugs and crime in the Los Angeles area. He’s eager to learn from Alonzo, but he’s not exactly sure what to make of him as Alonzo has a big personality. Also, Alonzo doesn’t always play by the rules.\n\nIn Alonzo’s mind, he has to do what is necessary to survive out there in Los Angeles as a detective. The great director William Friedkin used to talk about how there was a fine line between the police officer and the criminal as well as the good guy and the bad guy. Alonzo is someone who definitely falls under that category. However, the more time Jake spends with Alonzo, the more Jake realizes he didn’t exactly sign up for Alonzo’s unique style of being a detective. Alonzo has got an edge to him, and it is something which makes Jake quite uncomfortable at times.\n\nMake no mistake about it, this is Washington’s movie. It is a big performance from the actor as he finds himself in many situations where he seems to be in control of things, but he’s also losing his sense of reality. When certain people get into a position of power, they don’t always know when to stop or reel it in before it ends up biting them in the behind. Washington is captivating on screen, and he hits all of the right notes without ever being too over-the-top. Yes, it’s a showy, loud and in-your-face performance, but this is what the film needs in order for the character to come across the way writer David Ayer and Fuqua drew him up to be.\n\nHawke, on the other hand, is subdued for most of the film, but you can also see the anguish on his face. He’s uncomfortable by this whole situation, but he’s not in a position of power where he can do anything about it. In the last forty-minutes, Hawke gets his chance to shine, and he delivers in a meaningful and intense way. He’s one of those actors who knows how to make big moments count. In many ways, Jake is waiting in the wings and waiting for his chance to pounce and take over. Jake is not corrupt or out for money like Alonzo. He truly wants to be a good cop and help people. Their car rides provide for fascinating dialogue as we see the hardened and rough Alonzo interacting with the young and prideful Jake as he tries to fight off the cynicism and charisma of Alonzo.\n\nOverall, “Training Day” is far from a perfect film. The acting, though, is flawless. Every single actor on screen is at the top of their game. We even get scenes with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre. The soundtrack is also really, really good. However, I found the script to be a little bit repetitive in certain instances. After a while, we get the idea of what’s happening with Alonzo and his moral compass. We know what to expect from him and, at times, it seems like it’s the same scene just played out in a different setting and with different actors. I was looking for more character development as well from the supporting cast. The two leads could have been fleshed out more too.\n\nIn the end, the performances from Hawke and Washington mixed with a violent and brutal final act are what make this film worth watching and worth recommending. I think it’s a good cop movie, but it could have been a great cop movie. It’s a good movie with great performances, and I wish it was as good as the performances from its leads. As mentioned previously, the third act features some really, really gripping material which stayed with me. The middle act, however, tends to drag and seems to be spinning its wheels. I liked “Training Day” a lot, but I didn’t love it.\n\n* * * out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “Training Day” is released on a two-disc 4K combo pack from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. It comes with the 4K, Blu-ray and a digital copy of the film as well. I found it interesting, however, that the 4K and Blu-ray are in Blu-ray packaging as opposed to a black 4K case. It was different, and I didn’t mind it, but it is worth noting. It also comes with a really nice slipcover. The film has a running time of 122 minutes and is rated R for strong brutal violence, pervasive language, drug content and brief nudity. The 4K looks really, really good with its HDR. When the film gets darker, it has a really grim and moody look that makes it worth the upgrade. This is the best I’ve seen this film look, and I was very impressed with the finished product.\n\nAudio Info: We are treated to a Dolby Atmos track, and it really packs a big wallop here during the more intense and violent scenes. However, it’s not so loud and overwhelming that it’s distracting or you need to look for your remote. It’s perfect.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nPharoahe Monch’s “Got You” music video\n\nNelly’s “#1” music video\n\nDeleted Scenes\n\nCommentary by director Antoine Fuqua\n\n“Training Day:” Crossing the Line Featurette\n\nAlternative Endings\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nConsidering the memorable moments and performances, “Training Day” is a film I firmly believe you should add to your 4K collection. As per usual, we get the same special features that have been transported over from the Blu-ray release. I can’t be disappointed by this anymore, as it’s to be expected. At this point, if you don’t own “Training Day” at all, or if you own the Blu-ray, you are wondering if you should upgrade to 4K. In my eyes, it’s a no-brainer. I loved the dark and murky look of it. It’s an unsettling film (in a good way) and the HDR transfer really encapsulates the dread and moodiness. If you haven’t seen the film before, there is a lot to like from Hawke and Washington on screen. Washington shows why he is one of the greatest actors of his generation as he crushes it here. Hawke, one of my favorite actors, gives a very subdued, conflicted and under-the-radar performance which only gets better with age. This is a film which, if you are going to own it, you have to own it on 4K.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nI once had a teacher in college who told me filmmakers keep making the same movie over again and again without even realizing it, and Baz Luhrmann is a prime example of this. His “Romeo & Juliet” and “Moulin Rouge” dealt with characters looking back at a past they can never return to and of love affairs which ended tragically. His adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s classic novel “The Great Gatsby” is not any different from those two films, and it is filled with extravagant scenes that dazzle us with amazing choreography and beautiful images. But while it is a beautiful movie to look at, this film lacks the heart and soul I usually expect Luhrmann’s works to have in an infinite degree.\n\nThis “Gatsby” adaptation starts with Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire), a writer and bond broker, telling us about his time in New York during the 1920s (better known in the history books as the “Roaring 20s”). Right there I knew the movie was in trouble as Luhrmann started “Moulin Rouge” off with Ewan McGregor reflecting on an exhilarating past and a great love which has long since passed him by, and Maguire is a very similar character in that respect. From there, it is clear that this movie will not have a happy ending, and the characters we see enjoying themselves will soon experience a suffering which will be endless. We’re not even five minutes into this cinematic adaptation, and already I can tell this will be familiar territory for Luhrmann, way too familiar.\n\nThe 1920s were a time of great wealth and endless partying which came to a crashing halt the following decade when the stock market crashed and Americans found themselves out of a job (sound familiar?). Carraway finds himself caught up in all the hoopla which came with those times, and it’s at an especially over the top party where he meets Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man as rich as he is mysterious. From there they become inseparable friends as Gatsby shows Carraway around town and introduces him to the most influential people one could ever hope to meet. But it’s when Gatsby takes a strong interest in Carraway’s cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), that things start changing and not for the better. It turns out Gatsby knew Daisy in the past, and now Gatsby will do everything in his power to win Daisy back from her suspicious husband, polo player Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton).\n\n“The Great Gatsby” has the same problem Luhrmann’s “Romeo & Juliet” had during its first half; it thrust a lot of style and flash cuts at us at an alarming rate to where I was desperate for things to slow down so I could breathe and actually everything in on a deeper level. Now Luhrmann did slow things down in “Romeo & Juliet” to where we connected emotionally with the story and its characters, and he successfully reinvigorated one of William Shakespeare’s most overdone plays to where it felt fresh and exciting again. But this time he gets so caught up in the spectacle he is putting up for us all to see to where it became impossible for me to connect with anything or anybody here. The sensory overload I got in his previous films was exhilarating, but here everything feels so exhausting and artificial to where it doesn’t matter if you watch this film in 2D or 3D (I watched it in 2D because I refused to spend the extra money). The characters may be starving for emotion, but it’s the audience that needs it even more.\n\nWhether or not you have read Fitzgerald’s classic novel, it’s easy to see the direction this movie was going to take. As a result, I found myself getting very bored and impatient as I knew Gatsby would eventually stumble over his own ambitions, and I just wanted see him get his ass kicked sooner rather than later. Heck, I even got up and went to the bathroom at one point, and that should you give you an idea of how frustrating this movie was for me. I was able to sit through “Star Trek V: The Final Frontier” despite needing to pee really bad, but this one I could not hold it in. Yes, that’s too much information for you readers, but anyway…\n\nOn the upside, the actors acquit themselves very nicely. You can’t really go wrong with DiCaprio, and he does make quite the dashing Gatsby, but there should be a drinking game based on how many times he calls people “old sport” throughout, and I seriously got sick of him saying that. His good friend Tobey Maguire has his back as Nick Carraway, and he does a lovely job of reading Fitzgerald’s words to where I’d like to hear him do a reading of the novel as he brings us a lot closer to the author’s dialogue than Luhrmann does.\n\nCarey Mulligan, however, is seriously miscast as Daisy Buchanan. She still gets to do her whole woefully vulnerable lady act which she played to perfection in “An Education,” but Mulligan is not able to nail the other complexities this role has to offer. Yes, she is a lovely presence to watch in this or in any other movie, but this is not enough to save her performance here.\n\nClearly a tremendous amount of effort was put forth by the cast and crew on “The Great Gatsby,” but it doesn’t change the fact that the movie is a profound disappointment. Fitzgerald’s novel has been adapted several times with limited success, and many say it is an exceedingly hard book to translate to the silver screen. Luhrmann looked like he was the man who could do it justice, but he doesn’t come close. What a shame. We can always count on him to give us spectacle as well as substance, but this movie is all spectacle and not enough substance.\n\n* ½ out of * * * *\n\nI’m not sure if I ever watched the original “Speed Racer” cartoon, but I feel like I have. Maybe it’s because that darn theme song can be so hard to get out of your head. Speed is one of those characters who has permanently engrained himself into pop culture for all time. Back in 2008, the Wachowskis brought this popular cartoon which is credited for bringing the world of anime into full focus onto the big screen in a live action version that is bursting at the seams with the most vibrant colors imaginable.\n\nIn short, “Speed Racer” is a visual splendor to behold, and also kind of an endurance test to sit through. At over two hours, this movie is simply way too long. I usually don’t complain about a movie’s length, but I can’t resist bitching about it here because I kept yawning in the second half and was checking my watch. When I check my watch during a movie, it is NOT a good sign.\n\n“Speed Racer” starts off innocently enough as we see Young Speed (Nicholas Elia) daydreaming about someday being a great racecar driver like his brother Rex (Scott Porter). Speed comes from a family weaned on race cars and building them. His father Pops (the always dependable John Goodman) runs Rex’s race team along with Speed’s brother Sparky (Kick Gurry) until Rex ends up walking out on the family and their cars. No real reason is giving by Rex to his dad, but he warns Young Speed not to believe all the bad things people are going to be saying about him. Soon enough, Rex is slammed with a bad reputation which is not of his own doing, and he later perishes in a tragic car crash which haunts the family to the point where Pops won’t go into his garage to do any mechanic work.\n\nFast forward to several years later, and we see Speed all grown up (and played by Emile Hirsch), and he is as a good a racer as Rex. He amazes everyone with his skills on the track to the delight of his fans and ever-loving family. Pops has even come back into working on cars again along with Sparky, and Speed also has a great mother in Mom Racer (Susan Sarandon) who I can’t help but say is quite sexy. He also has a loyal girlfriend in Trixie (Christina Ricci) who flies her pink helicopter in the most alluring miniskirts ever to make their way into a PG-rated movie. And there is also his annoying younger brother (is there any other kind?) Spritle (Paulie Litt) and his chimp friend Chim Chim. Still, he could not have asked for a better family.\n\nThen into the picture comes Mr. Royalton (Roger Allam), a spiffy CEO of one the world’s largest auto industries who offers Speed a chance to sign up with him to represent his corporation. Royalton is basically a man with the mind of a used car salesman (and I have dealt with many of them over the years) with an extravagant attire. This man wants to seduce Speed into a world where he can have everything he could ever possibly want, but Speed would rather stick with his family as he finds these corporations a little too frightening to deal with. This ends up bringing out the devil in Royalton as he gives Speed lessons in how the world really works, and he is determined to see Speed will never win a race from here on out. The movie then becomes a journey to showing how one racecar driver can change the world for the better, and can also succeed in blowing apart the corrupt corporations which threaten to destroy the world of racing.\n\nThe movie is deliberately campy, and that’s fine. I imagine the show was too. The beginning was fun as it introduced us to the world of Speed Racer and the people who inhabit it. There is an innocence which proved to be quite infectious as we see Speed daydreaming about the life he wants to lead. Who hasn’t had moments like that? Had the movie contained more of this innocent feel, then I imagine I would have liked it a lot more. There’s nothing wrong with a good throwback to the past, and it always brings back good memories which are always welcome.\n\nBut towards the last half, I found myself really getting restless. Just when you think “Speed Racer” has reached its climax, there is more and everything feels dragged out as a result. Maybe it’s because we all know how the story will end, and the depressing part is there is no excitement in it. The movie has heart, but not enough to fully envelop us into its gloriously colorful world. Because the Wachowskis are working with CGI and have practically shot just about every frame in front of a blue screen, we know everything is precise in movement and direction. This is nothing you can really improvise around, and it makes the race scenes all the more disappointing because there is no real thrill in them. In fact, there is no friction which you really need in any cinematic car chase to make it effective. By the end, I was ready for it to be over. It didn’t matter how brilliant the visuals were. They don’t mean anything without soul.\n\nThis was the first movie the Wachowskis directed since the “The Matrix Revolutions.” They still have a knack for groundbreaking visual effects, and of following that one character who is “the one.” If it’s not Neo, then it’s Speed himself. They do surround this film with good actors like John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, Christina Ricci and Emile Hirsch who was coming off a plethora of praise for his work in “Into the Wild” at the time. But the story and the characters are not enough here like they were in “The Matrix.” Maybe it’s because we have seen this story so many times before; the one man on a mission to stop those who control everything and blind us to the truth of the world we live in.\n\nWith “The Matrix,” that story was revolutionary and groundbreaking. But with “Speed Racer,” there is nothing revolutionary except the visual spectrum of what’s on display, and it doesn’t change the fact that the story about a man going against the corporate world is old, old, old. There is also the sheer irony of the corporate world funding a movie where the independent people go against the corporations to win the day.\n\nI didn’t hate “Speed Racer.” There is a lot to admire about it. It’s not really an actor’s movie, but then again, these movies rarely are. I guess I’m sad this movie, despite the amount of money put into it, didn’t excite me the way I hoped it would. And I am sick of being forgiving to movies like these. The Wachowskis may forever be imprisoned by the success of “The Matrix” movies, but they are better filmmakers and storytellers than this.\n\n* * out of * * * *\n\nIt’s been a couple of days since I watched “The Matrix Resurrections,” and my feelings about it are a bit mixed. Truth is, I have been waiting for a fourth “Matrix” movie for years following the ending of “The Matrix Revolutions” which ended the trilogy with a whimper instead of a bang. My friends and I came out of it thinking there had to be another one, and we guessed it would be called “The Matrix Resurrection.” So, when the first trailer for “The Matrix Resurrections” was dropped for the whole world to see, I was thrilled to see Neo and Trinity alive again, and I could barely contain my excitement for what was to come. Then again, I am always reminded of how expectations and anticipation can lead you to an ecstatic high which the final product can never ever live up to.\n\nTo me, “The Matrix” movies are a lot like Peter Gabriel’s albums, you have to go in expecting the unexpected, and this is certainly the case here. Sure, all the cool special effects like bullet-time and characters jumping all over the place are back, but this installment is also more intimate. It takes jabs at Hollywood’s incessant need for remakes, reboots and sequels as nobody seemingly has the guts to produce anything original, and it echoes the events of “The Matrix” trilogy to where some will be saying “déjà vu” out loud. But deep down, this one is at its heart a love story of two people torn apart in their battle against the machines, but who now have a second chance to be together again because, hey, wouldn’t it be nice?\n\nWe meet up again with Neo and his alter-ego of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) who has once again been plugged back into the simulated world and works as a highly successful video game developer who has long since created a successful trilogy of games entitled, you guessed it, The Matrix. The games are based on his dreams from his faint memories of being Neo, and now the parent company, Warner Brothers, wants him to make another game to the delight of his boss, Smith (Jonathan Groff), who starts off sounding quite a bit like Agent Smith…\n\nSuffice to say, Lana Wachowski is looking to have a little fun with Warner Brothers as they have been constantly asking her and her sister Lily to make another “Matrix” movie. As Mr. Anderson’s fellow employees try to keep coming up with ideas about how to make a fourth game, and no one can seem to agree on anything. Lana ended up co-writing and directing this installment by her lonesome as Lilly did not want to return to this franchise, but I imagine Lana is speaking for the two of them as she flips the bird to the studio as if to say, “you think it’s easy coming up with another sequel? Just be happy with what we give you dammit!”\n\nStill, Thomas is plagued by what he says are “dreams which are not really dreams,” and he tells his therapist (played by Neil Patrick Harris) that he believes he is going crazy. But his therapist, with his blue-rimmed glasses, assures him he is not and prescribes him medication which comes in blue pills. And we all know what happens when you take the blue pill, right?\n\nThere’s a lot going on in “The Matrix Resurrections” to where watching it once will not be enough. While it does repeat some scenarios and themes, it does so in a way which feels relatively fresh. Yes, Neo, has to be awakened from the simulated world and brought back to the real one once again, but history does have a nasty habit of repeating itself. After all this time, choice is still seen as an illusion to certain characters, but there are those who are willing to challenge this perception which helped bring me into the story on an even deeper level. After all these years, I refuse to believe choice is an illusion.\n\nOne character who looks like an agent introduces himself as Morpheus, but he looks a bit different here as he is played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. As to why Laurence Fishburne did not reprise his role, you have to remember what happened to Morpheus in the game “Enter the Matrix” which is considered canon. While Abdul-Mateen does try to sound like Fishburne at times, his Morpheus has his own moves and rhythms to where he comfortably makes the role his own and is a lot of fun to watch.\n\nJonathan Groff makes for a menacing Agent Smith (the second trailer revealed who this actor was playing), but it would have been great if Hugo Weaving were able to return as this character makes an interesting decision towards the latter half of the movie. Jessica Henwick, who opted out of Marvel’s “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” to do this, makes Bugs a badass gunslinger whom you want to follow from start to finish. Lambert Wilson returns as The Merovingian, but this time he looks like he just jumped out of Terry Gilliam movie. And yes, Christina Ricci appears here in a small role which is like one of those blinked and you missed it ones. Much was said about her being in this sequel, but she’s barely in it.\n\nThe action here is exciting, but it does not have quite the same exhilaration as the original “Matrix” did. Regardless, there were some interesting moments on a train and throughout the city of San Francisco. Cinematographers John Toll and Daniele Massaccesi give this particular “Matrix” movie its own look to where it feels like its own thing. Composing the score this time around instead of Don Davis are Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer who have big shoes to fill, but the two give us music which makes the action and emotions on display all the more rousing. Having said that, I kept asking myself, “Where the hell is Juno Reactor?!”\n\nBut for me, the heart of this movie is in the relationship between Neo and Trinity. Although their characters were killed off in “The Matrix Revolutions,” something never quite sat right with me or with the conclusion where the humans essentially reach a draw with the machines. Lana has said writing the screenplay was her way of dealing with the grief of losing her parents, and bringing back these two iconic characters felt very welcome to me. While some may consider this a cheat as it threatens to retcon all Neo and Trinity went through, I am reminded of how anything is possible in this particular cinematic universe.\n\nA lot of people still like to pick on Keanu Reeves’ acting, but I am willing to defend him on a number of roles he has taken on including this one. While there are certain scenes which have him emoting, his work overall was solid overall as he realizes how the dynamic between Neo and Trinity is taking on a different dimension this time around, and his time as John Wick is proof how he can handle action scenes like a seasoned pro.\n\nIt is also so cool to see Carrie-Anne Moss back as Trinity as she has not lost a step and still looks far too young to be getting grandmother roles. In the simulated world, she is Tiffany who is married with a couple of kids and has a thing for motorcycles, but upon meeting Mr. Anderson, she is convinced she has met him before. Moss invests this character with the same boundless energy she gave Trinity in the original trilogy, and I am thrilled she is back to keep some ass. Also, I am glad that the choice to leave the Matrix was given to her because, seriously, women should have the right to choose.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, what really got me more involved in “The Matrix Resurrections” was seeing Neo and Trinity on the screen and wanting them to be together again. Seeing them torn apart previously may have inevitable, but I like to believe in second chances as the world of machines has gotten bigger and stronger than what we saw previously. In a world dominated by technology, the need for human emotions like love is stronger than ever.\n\nAs I write this, “The Matrix Resurrections” has been getting some rather polarizing reviews. People have been calling it a needless and soulless cash grab while others see it as a worthy installment which takes things in a fresh direction. Indeed, while Lana Wachowski does deliver on certain expectations, she openly defies several others as she is determined to make this movie her own and not simply give in to corporate studio heads or test screenings. The fact people are mixed on the final result is not really surprising as these movies are anything but your average sci-fi action spectacle, and they don’t always give you what you think they will.\n\nFor the most part, I did like “The Matrix Resurrections” even if it didn’t thrill me as much as I hoped. But like I said, it helps to expect the unexpected. I will see it again at some point in the hopes of uncovering more of its multiple themes and visuals as there is only so much I could take in on a first viewing. Many will be judging this sequel at its surface, but hopefully they will take the time to see what’s underneath it.\n\nThe Rolling Stones were right: you can’t always get what you wanted, but if you try sometimes, you just might find get what you need. That’s how I view this movie.\n\n* * * out of * * * *\n\nIt is September 9, 2021, and I knew exactly what I needed to do: have breakfast and watch the first trailer for “The Matrix Resurrections.” But of course, breakfast would be second as this particular trailer could not come soon enough. All I can say is, wow! Keanu Reeves, looking more like John Wick than Neo, is back. Lana Wachowski is back. Carrie-Anne Moss is back, and no, she does not look to be playing a grandmother here.\n\nThe first thing I want to point out about the “Resurrections” trailer is how excited I am at how part of this movie takes place in San Francisco. It all looks so beautiful here, and it feels like it has been forever since anyone shot anything there. Part of me expected those digits to descend down the screen, but the trailer instead opens up with Thomas Anderson (Reeves) talking with a therapist (played by Neil Patrick Harris) about these strange dreams he has been having. From there, we see him taking what I guess are anti-depressants, and they are blue pills. And one other thing, Harris is wearing blue glasses in his session with Thomas. Coincidence?\n\nWhat blew me away about this trailer was that it has a unique look to it. Sure, there are many images from the original featured, but “Resurrections” is made to look like its own thing and not a simple repeat of what came before. While its story line feels a bit similar to the original as Mr. Anderson is slowly waking up to the world around him, there is a different feeling this time around.\n\nQuite wisely, this trailer only tells us so much about what we will be seeing this December. Lana Wachowski is not about to give everything away which is smart, and we are left to ponder the reality this sequel takes place in. As a result, I am left with a string of questions I am eager to see answered:\n\nWill this sequel take place following the events of “Matrix Revolutions,” or is this a whole new timeline featuring the same characters?\n\nIs Thomas Anderson (a.k.a. Neo) too woke to use a cell phone while in an elevator?\n\nWhy does Neo recognize Trinity but Trinity does not recognize Neo?\n\nWill the bullet time effects be utilized frequently in this film?\n\nIs Morpheus, now played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, meant to be a younger version of the character previously played by Laurence Fishburne?\n\nIs this a prequel instead of a sequel?\n\nChristina Ricci is co-starring in “Resurrections,” but did we see her in this trailer?\n\nIs Thomas/Neo dumping those blue pills into the sink meant to be smack in the face to big pharma?\n\nDo we really want to see this on HBO Max instead of on the big screen where it belongs?\n\nWas Keanu Reeves shooting the fourth John Wick movie while filming “Resurrections?” Is this why Neo looks like John Wick?\n\nIs Trinity pregnant with Thomas’/Neo’s baby? Well, whatever the case, she certainly does not look to be a grandmother in this installment.\n\nWith Johnny Klimek and Tom Tykwer taking over music scoring duties from Don Davis, will Juno Reactor be along for the ride as well?\n\nLastly, why is everyone stunned that Laurence Fishburne does not appear in this trailer? For crying out loud, it was announced he would not be appearing in it ages ago! Besides, he will be reunited with Reeves in the next John Wick sequel, so stop complaining!\n\nSuffice to say, I am as excited for this sequel as I am for “Halloween Kills.” As a result, I need to keep my expectations in check as they can be easily ruined for all the wrong reasons. I have enjoyed all “The Matrix” movies, and I include the third one even though its ending really sucked. With this trailer for “The Matrix Resurrections,” we look to be getting something as striking and visually spectacular as the original which wowed us back in 1999. I cannot wait, and I am about to say something I have not said in years: Christmas can’t come soon enough!\n\nCheck out the trailer below:\n\nI re-watched the original “Mad Max” just before I checked this sequel out, and I was amazed at what spectacular stunts director George Miller was able to pull off on a budget of less than $1 million. Even today, the 1979 movie is exhilarating to watch as Max Rockatansky lays waste to the gang of bikers who coldly and viciously murdered his wife and son. After watching it, I had to wonder what Miller could do with an even bigger budget. Of course, we all came to see exactly what he could with the next two “Mad Max” movies as well as with his segment of “Twilight Zone: The Movie,” “Happy Feet” and the highly underrated “Babe: Pig in the City.”\n\nBut all of his previous works came close to completely paling in comparison to “Mad Max: Fury Road,” the first “Mad Max” movie in 30 years, which had Miller working with a reported budget of $150 million and giving us the kind of action movie which effectively redefines the words thrilling, exhilaration, non-stop and spectacle. It’s as furious as movies get, and the real lack of CGI effects makes the action feel all the more wonderfully brutal. For a follow-up which got stuck in development hell for what seemed like an eternity, it was well worth the wait.\n\nThere’s a bit of confusion as to whether “Fury Road” is meant to be a franchise reboot or a sequel, but even with Tom Hardy taking over the role made famous by Mel Gibson, I’m just going to consider this a straightforward sequel. And like many of the best sequels, this one does not require you to have seen the previous three movies to understand all of what is going on.\n\nOnce again, Max travels the wretched wasteland of planet Earth in his car equipped with the kind of horsepower we would love to convince others we have under the hoods of our own cars, and it doesn’t take him long at all to get captured by people who have long since been driven mad by the desecration and lawlessness surrounding them. Max ends up being brought to a place called the Citadel which is ruled over by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army of War Boys. Max eventually escapes (it wouldn’t be much of a movie if he didn’t) and comes into contact with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), a hardened warrior who drives a heavily armed truck known as the War Rig. It is eventually revealed that Furiosa has absconded with Joe’s Five Wives, women selected for the purpose of breeding, and Joe will stop at nothing to retrieve what is now considered Earth’s most valuable property: no oil, not water, but human bodies.\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” wastes no time in putting the pedal to metal as it is essentially one long chase movie which never lets up. The plot is fairly thin, but it’s still thick enough to support the tremendous action sequences which involve some of the craziest stunts and crashes this side of a John Woo or a James Cameron film. Seeing real cars actually crash and get demolished provides us with the visceral thrills I don’t get enough of at the local cinema these days. The fact Miller was able to give us such an amazing spectacle even at the age of 70 more than raises the bar for the next generation of filmmakers who have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nI do have to admit I’m a little bummed Gibson didn’t return to play Max. It’s certainly not hard to understand why he was absent this time around, but coming back to play the role which made him a worldwide star would have been the icing on the cake for “Fury Road.” Having said that, Hardy does a terrific job of making this iconic role his own, and he proves to be furiously mad in his own crazy way.\n\nBut seriously, “Mad Max: Fury Road” really belongs to Charlize Theron who steals the show as Imperator Furiosa. There should be no doubt as to how phenomenal an actress Theron is as she has given us amazing performances in “Monster” (and no, the makeup did not do the work for her), “North Country” and “Young Adult” and she deserves far more credit than she typically gets. Her toughened up performance as Furiosa brings to mind Sigourney Weaver’s in “Aliens” as she dominates the special effects in a way few actors get the chance to do.\n\nWhen it was released, many said “Fury Road” had a strong feminist angle to it, and they said this as if it were a bad thing. Then again, those who urged us to boycott this movie for that reason still have not bothered to watch it, so their hypocrisy remains as infinite as ever. What they need to understand is women cannot and should no longer be considered the weaker sex. The fact is they never were.\n\nI also liked how Miller brought back Hugh Keays-Byrne to play Immortan Joe here as he is the same actor who portrayed Toecutter, the villain of the original “Mad Max.” Byrne ends up having to wear this scary looking mask throughout “Fury Road,” so his eyes and his voice do most of the acting for him. But even with these given limitations, Byrne gives us a very threatening and mesmerizing antagonist who is bent on dominating anyone and everyone who has the misfortune of being in his path.\n\nAnd let’s not forget Nicholas Hoult who plays Nux, the sick war boy who comes to discover what really matters to him in such a desolate world. It’s been fun watching him go from his early days as a child actor in “About a Boy” to where he is presently, and it has been a voyage full of memorable performances. As Nux, he looks to be having the time of his life as he shouts out loud, “Oh what a glorious day!” His energy never lets up from start to finish, and he succeeds in making us care about Nux even though he is not entirely trustworthy when we first meet him.\n\nThere are many images here which have stayed with me long after I first saw it on the silver screen. The design of the cars the characters roam the desert in, the Darth Vader-like mask Immortan Joe wears, those guys hanging tightly to totem poles as the vehicles they are tied to travel at breakneck speeds, and, of course, the travelling guitarist known as the Doof Warrior (iOTA) who plays his instrument and shoots fire out of it with reckless abandon. All of this amazing imagery is done to the thunderous score composed by Thomas Holkenborg (a.k.a. Junkie XL) which proves to be as furious as the onscreen spectacle.\n\nIt has now been five years since “Mad Max: Fury Road” was first released, and there should be no doubt that it is one of the best action movies ever made. Time has not taken away from the pure adrenaline rush Miller provides us here, nor does the frustration of him losing the Best Director Academy Award to Alejandro G. Iñárritu who won instead for “The Revenant.” For an action movie, this one is a real work of art.\n\nSeriously, there is something to be said for a movie which brought cinematographer John Seale out of retirement to work on it.\n\n* * * * out of * * * *"
