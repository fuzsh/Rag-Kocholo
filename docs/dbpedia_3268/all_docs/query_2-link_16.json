        "text": "LONDON — Village Roadshow Pictures has concluded international distribution deals for the majority of its titles with sales outfits Icon Entertainment Intl. and Beyond Films.\n\nIcon will handle all sales on VRP’s non-Australian theatrical product in “selected territories,” according to a statement released by the company. This could mean most of international as Roadshow has a domestic deal with Warner Bros. and its own direct distribution operations in Australia, New Zealand and Greece.\n\nBeyond, meanwhile, will represent all of Roadshow’s Australian pics to the international marketplace.\n\nThe newest Roadshow pic that Icon will handle under the deal will be the thriller “Love Lies Bleeding,” written by Tony Rush and directed by Bill Tannen. Paul Rhys, Emily Raymond, Faye Dunaway and Malcolm McDowell star.\n\nRoadshow’s own sales banner, Village Roadshow Pictures Worldwide, had previously completed some sales on “Love,” which will screen for the first time at Mifed.\n\nOther pics that Icon will now oversee include the Casper Van Dien starrer “Tarzan and the Lost City,” which Warner Bros. released Stateside, and “Bullet.”\n\nThe shift away from sales at Village Roadshow comes in the wake of the co-financing and distribution deal for higher-budget films that the company signed with WB earlier this year. Pics made under that deal include the Sandra Bullock-Nicole Kidman starrer “Practical Magic,” currently in release in the U.S., and the forthcoming actioner “Matrix,” starring Keanu Reeves. Insiders said Roadshow decided to pull out of financing and distributing smaller films partly as a result of that arrangement.\n\nLast month Greg Coote, the longtime prexy of Village Roadshow Pictures Worldwide, ankled the company to set up his own operation.\n\nRoadshow Worldwide won’t be disbanded completely, however. New prexy Bobby Meyers will remain in his post in L.A. to oversee the banner’s various pictures and activities.\n\nThe fate of Roadshow’s production deal with Dustin Hoffman’s Punch Prods. is less certain. Punch’s pact comes up for renewal shortly, and Punch execs are considering various options, including raising their own leveraged financing, insiders said. Punch’s first pic, “The Blouse Man,” is being released in the U.S. by Miramax."
