        "text": "Movie Trailer: The LEGO Movie (2014)\n\nMovie Trailers\n\n8 responses\n\nThey’ve made a movie about every other toy in creation so why not everyone’s favorite building blocks, LEGO? Well today Warner Bros. put that to rest with their trailer for The LEGO Movie. Starring every superhero and lovable character imaginable, the family-friendly movie follows a typical smiley figure named Emmet (Chris Pratt) as he bumbles…\n\nMovie Review: Man of Tai Chi (2013)\n\nMovie Reviews\n\n5 responses\n\nThe battle for man’s mind, body and soul has waged since the Garden of Eden and nearly as long on film.

On one hand, the story (by Will Fetters, based upon the novel by Nicholas “The Notebook” Sparks) is an often compelling tale of love, war and broken and healing hearts.
