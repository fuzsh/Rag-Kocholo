        "text": "Happy Feet\n\nHAPPY FEET is set deep in Antarctica. Into the land of the Emperor penguins where each needs a heartsong to attract a soul mate, a penguin is born who cannot sing. Our hero Mumble, son of Memphis and Norma Jean, is the worst singer in the worldâ€¦ however, as it happens, he is a brilliant tap dancer! The story of a misfit who finds a beat all his own, HAPPY FEET is a toe-tapping comedy-adventure for all ages.\n\nHotel de Love\n\n1982. The Dunne brothers, Rick and Stephen, both fall head over heels for Melissa Morrison at a party in Victoria. Rick, who has always been a firm believer in the passing shot while his younger brother has come to rely on the lob, intercepts Melissa and sweeps her off her feet. However, their romance is cut short when Melissa departs for Brisbane with her family. Fourteen years later, Stephen is a successful stockbroker leading a loveless existence. Rick, nursing a broken heart after his fiance walked out on him, is now the manager of the Hotel de Love, a honeymoon hotel on the outskirts of Melbourne. The fun begins when they are all reunited at the Hotel de Love.\n\nLegend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\n\nSoren, a young barn owl, is kidnapped by owls of St. Aggie's, ostensibly an orphanage, where owlets are brainwashed into becoming soldiers. He and his new friends escape to the island of Ga'Hoole, to assist its noble, wise owls who fight the army being created by the wicked rulers of St. Aggie's. The film is based on the first three books in the series.\n\nThe Rover\n\nTen years following a collapse of the western economic system, the rule of law has disintegrated and life is cheap. Eric travels the desolate towns and roads of the Australian outback. He will go to any lengths to take back the one thing that matters to him. From the director of Animal Kingdom."
