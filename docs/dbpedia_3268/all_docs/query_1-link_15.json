        "text": "Thumbnail: The Wachowskis’ newest science-fiction fantasy is a visual wonder and a big-screen delight, but it suffers from overly complicated storytelling in service of thin characters and redundant action sequences.\n\nThe Box Office:\n\nWarner Bros. / Time Warner Inc. will be releasing the Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. production Jupiter Ascending in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D this Friday. The film, which stars Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean, and Eddie Redmayne, was initially supposed to be released in mid-July of last summer before it was pulled from the schedule in early June and relocated to the February 6th, 2016 slot. The date change of course set off warning bells about whether or not the film was an artistic disaster and/or a would-be financial catastrophe. Either way, the film heads into the weekend with a $175 million budget and a deluge of negative press.\n\nIn one of those weird coincidences that feels like fate, the delay not only allowed Warner Bros. to avoid a sci-fi miss a month after the “cost too much” Edge of Tomorrow in 2014 but also puts the Dream Factory in a position of using the surprise mega-success of American Sniper to cushion the blow. Even if Jupiter Ascending makes the exact same amount of money that it would have made had it opened last summer, or perhaps even a bit less due to the less prime slot, Warner Bros. can more easily sell the “Well, that one didn't quite work!” spin in light of American Sniper racing towards the $300m domestic mark and The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies making a run at $1 billion worldwide. I’m not saying it won’t hurt, but it will hurt less in February of 2015 than it would have in July of 2014.\n\nMila Kunis isn't exactly courting mega-budget franchise tent poles and Channing Tatum will be fine. The real losers if the film goes south this weekend are the Wachowski siblings. This is their first pure original film since The Matrix just under 16 years ago. The sequels made lots of money but left fans cold. Speed Racer is a beloved cult classic but made just $85m worldwide on a $120m budget. Cloud Atlas was a respectable attempt at high-end prestigious sci-fi, but it earned $130m worldwide on a $100m budget. If this one plays the way the pundits are predicting, then it may be awhile before Lana and Andrew Wachowski get any real money to do their uber-imaginative voodoo. And that will be a loss for all of us. So despite my mixed feelings on the film, I am hoping for a surprise this weekend.\n\nThe Review:\n\nI would love to tell you that all of the advance buzz was wrong. I would love to tell you that Jupiter Ascending is a towering artistic achievement that validates the copious money that Lana and Andrew Wachowski have spent on behalf of Village Roadshow and Warner Bros. I find much of the advance \"Ooooh... (Insert media-friendly star's) movie is going to bomb!\" muck-racking distasteful, both in terms of what amounts to rooting for failure for the sake of click-bait headlines and in terms of establishing a negative narrative right from the start. So the good news is that Jupiter Ascending is not truly a narrative disaster and it often is a visual wonder. But considering the amount of money (clearly onscreen) being spent, the film itself just isn't strong enough in terms of crowd pleasing spectacle or iconic characters to justify the film's budget.\n\nIn terms of big-budget and often imaginative spectacle, Jupiter Ascending is worth seeing and worth seeing on the biggest IMAX theater you can find. But films as expensive as Jupiter Ascending basically have a strike a chord with audiences worldwide. The film doesn't fly in that sense, offering a hard sci-fi variation on The Princess Diaries that comes off as something less Star Wars and more Dune. While (for example) The Matrix set up a detailed and elaborate world that housed a crowd-pleasing beat-for-beat retelling of Joseph Campbell's heroic journey, Jupiter Ascending often seems more concerned with the world-building than the storytelling. But wow, the world building is really something special.\n\nThe film is indeed a web of political complications and multi-planet feuds, and the core story (Mila Kunis is an impoverished cleaning lady who discovers that she is the true owner of Earth while half-human/half-dog Channing Tatum must protect her from those who oppose her claim) lacks a sense of real urgency or a logical end point. That includes the third act which suffers from at least one false climax and an eventual montage of stuff blowing up and other stuff collapsing to no good storytelling purpose. The only thing that prevents the movie from becoming as much of a muddle as (for example) John Carter is that the filmmakers cast the film with diverse actors who don't look exactly alike. You may not know or care how any number of the many peripheral characters fits into the overall puzzle, but you'll know basically who they are at any given moment because they don't look like the character they are fighting or arguing with.\n\nWhile Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis exude natural movie star charm and Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne is fun as the snake-like villain, their characters are not explicitly developed and the screenplay fails to give them much in the way of clever dialogue. The film does look fantastic, with any number of alien worlds, alien creatures, and intricately detailed spaceships filling up the frame. The picture is a joy just to look at, and the money is certainly up there on the screen. But the action sequences, which were once a calling card for the brother/sister directing duo, fall short here. There is one terrific \"worth the price of admission\" extended chase that ironically takes place not in space but on Earth. It's a humdinger as spaceships race around and do battle in the night sky and crash in and around the populace. But the rest of the action scenes fall into a general pattern. It's either Tatum flying around on his hover boots and engaging in close combat with a few foes or Mila Kunis falling from a great height and being caught in mid-air by her protector.\n\nAnd as needlessly complicated as the film sometimes feels, there is some humor to be found with the film's acknowledgment of its own tangled bureaucracy. Less amusing is the would-be comic relief surrounding Kunis's dysfunctional family unit, and the film miscalculates by keeping them in the picture long after we've taken off for other worlds. Our two would-be romantic leads have a relaxed chemistry that actually has us rooting for them to get together. The film oddly comes to life when it's diving headfirst into its own mythology, as there are a number of interesting ideas that play around with the well-worn concept of humanity being but a speck in the grand scheme of life in the galaxy as well as some dark implications for the whole \"reason we exist\" question. For better or worse, this is a grandly original sci-fi action thriller where the highlights come from creative and compelling exposition as opposed to the chases and fights.\n\nIn terms of that whole \"thumbs up\" or \"thumbs down\" thing, I'm of two minds about the picture. On the other hand, I'm inclined to give it a token pass because it looks so good and because the money they spent is so obviously on the screen to create an original looking world and tell an original story. I am bending over backwards to be fair because I love what the Wachowskis offer in terms of big-screen imagination and because I am in favor of the notion of big and expensive original would-be blockbusters even as I must admit that the film is inferior to the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy or Speed Racer in terms of memorable action and iconic characters. And there is a part of me that admits that I looked at the film through the lens of its budget. Like 47 Ronin, Jupiter Ascending is an enjoyable Saturday afternoon matinee that needed to be much more than that because of its $175m production cost. On that scale it does not measure up.\n\nIf you think you want more films like Jupiter Ascending in multiplexes on a more regular basis, you owe it to yourself to check it out at a theater near you. It's an enjoyably big and visually engaging B-movie."
