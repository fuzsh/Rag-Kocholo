        "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nAnother month has gone by and we’re on to another packed month full of great films. September seems like it’s going to be great by the end of the month. In with a few surprises. Let’s take a look at what’s coming out this month.\n\n2nd\n\nLimited Release: Yoga Hosers\n\nKevin Smith directs – and also stars – this odd comedy horror fantasy film that follows two teenage yoga enthusiasts, one played by his own daughter Harley Quinn Smith and Johnny Depp’s daughter Lily-Rose Depp, who team up with a legendary man-hunter to battle with an ancient evil presence that threatens their major party plans. The film has already opened on the film festival circuit to let’s call it a mixed reaction. The film also stars Johnny Depp, Austin Butler, Tyler Posey, Haley Joel Osment, Justin Long, Genesis Rodriguez, Adam Brody, Jason Mewes, and Natasha Lyonne\n\nThe Light Between Oceans (Walt Disney Motion Pictures/Dreamworks SKG/Touchstone Pictures/Amblin Entertainment/Reliance Entertainment/Participant Media)\n\nA lighthouse keeper (Michael Fassbender) and his wife (Alicia Vikander) living off the coast of Western Australia raise a baby they rescue from an adrift rowboat. They start to raise it as their own until a woman (Rachel Weisz) comes around claiming she’s lost her baby. With a cast like this, and what sounds like a compelling story, I can’t imagine this film being bad at all.\n\nMorgan (Thriller – 20th Century Fox/Scott Free Productions)\n\nDirected by Luke Scott – the son of director Ridley Scott – a corporate risk-management consultant (Kate Mara) has to decide and determine whether or not to terminate an artificial being’s (Anya Taylor-Joy) life that was made in a laboratory environment. This film came out of nowhere for me, but the film looks pretty damn good. The teaser trailer that came out automatically hooked me and with a great cast, this jumped to my anticipated films of the year. The film also stars Toby Jones, Michelle Yeoh, Body Holbrook, Sam Spruell, Jonathan Aris, Rose Leslie, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Paul Giamatti.\n\n9th\n\nThe Wild Life (Lionsgate/StudioCanal/nWave Pictures/uFilm)\n\nAn outgoing parrot named Tuesday, who dreams of seeing the outside world, and his friends enjoy their time on their exotic island until a violent storm brings Robinson Crusoe. Seeing him as a way off, they try to help get off, but not without trouble. The film is originally a French animated film that is being dubbed in English. Personally, the film doesn’t look very appealing to me.\n\nWhen the Bough Breaks (Drama – Sony Pictures/Screen Gems/Unique Features)\n\nA surrogate mom for a couple becomes dangerously obsessed with the soon-to-be father. Regina Hall, Theo Rossi, Morris Chestnut, and Glenn Morshower star. The film isn’t really targeted toward me, but the film doesn’t look that great to me honest.\n\nThe Disappointments Room (Drama Thriller – Relativity Media/Demarest Films/Media Talent Group)\n\nWritten by Wentworth Miller and directed by D.J. Caruso (Disturbia, Eagle Eye, xXx: Return of Xander Cage), the film follows a mother (Kate Beckinsale) and her young son (Lucas Till) release unimaginable horrors from the attic of their rural dream home. This film has sat on the shelves for a while, and will finally come out. It does look creepy, but the film will have to do some heavy marketing to get on people’s radar since it just moved to this date right before the beginning of the month. The Disappointments Room also stars Michaela Conlin, Michael Landes, Duncan Joiner and Gerald McRaney.\n\nSully (Biography Drama – Warner Bros./Village Roadshow Pictures/RatPac Entertainment/Malpaso Productions/Flashlight Films)\n\nThe film tells the true story of American pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who heroically landed an aircraft full of passengers on the Hudson River. But the story is much more than just him landing the plan. Sully look pretty impressive after that trailer, especially the plan going into the river. The film is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks as Sully himself and Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot. The film also stars Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Sam Huntington, and Holt McCallany.\n\n16th\n\nLimited Release: The Good Neighbor\n\nA pair of high school kids try to trick a neighbor into thinking a house is haunted, but their intended victim turns out to be far more dangerous than they imagined. The film stars James Cann, Logan Miller, Keir Gilchrist, Laura Innes, Edwin Hodge, Anne Dudek, Bailey Nobel, Lili Reinhart, and Mindy Sterling.\n\nHillsong: Let Hope Rise (Pure Flix Entertainment/Grace Hill Media/MediaWeaver Entertainment/Cantinas Entertainment)\n\nThe film is a documentary following the Australia-based worship band Hillsong. The film will follow their humble beginning and rise to an international church.\n\nBridget Jones’s Baby (Romantic Comedy – Universal Pictures/Working Title Films)\n\nThe adventures continue for British publishing executive Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) as she enters her 40s, and yeah, she has a baby. Colin Firth returns as Mark Darcy and Sally Philips returns as Shazza, and the film will also stars Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, and Patrick Dempsey. I don’t know if anyone was screaming for another Bridget Jones movie, but here it is.\n\nSnowden (Biography Drama Thriller – Open Road Films/Onda Entertainment/KrautPack Entertainment/Sacha Inc.)\n\nDirected by Oliver Stone, Snowden is about the former CIA employee Edward Snowden (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who leaked thousands of classified documents. The trailer makes it seem like the film will focus on Snowden before he leaked everything a bit, and then jump to what maybe happens after. The film has a very talented cast, and was supposed to be released late last year before it was pushed back to this year. Snowden also stars Shailene Woodley, Scott Eastwood, Nicolas Cage, Timothy Olyphant, Zachary Quinto, Rhys Ifans, Tom Wilkinson and Melissa Leo.\n\nBlair Witch (Horror – Lionsgate)\n\nYou want to talk about films that came out of nowhere, Blair Witch is the definition of that. Originally called The Woods, it was recently revealed that the film was really a sequel, yes a sequel, to the Blair Witch films. Directed by Adam Wingard (You’re Next, The Guest) the film follows Blane, as he takes a group of friends into the woods, after he discovers a video of what could be his missing sister. The problem they find is that they have gone into the same woods that belong to the legendary Blair Witch. I always already looking forward to The Woods because of Wingard, but now that it is a Blair Witch film, my excitement went down just a little, but it’s still Wingard so I’m going to watch this.\n\n23rd\n\nLimited Release: Queen of Katwe\n\nBased on the book by Tim Crothers, a young girl from Uganda trains to become a world chess champion. I’ve only seen the trailer once, but I felt like I’ve already seen the film. Nonetheless, it looks like an impressive story and the film will find the right people. The cast includes Lupita Nyong’o, David Oyelowo, and introduces Madina Nalwanga playing the main character.\n\nLimited Release: Beauty and the Beast\n\nDirected by visionary filmmaker Christophe Gans (Crying Freeman, Brotherhood of the Wolf, Silent Hill), the film is, well, Beauty and the Beast in French. The film looks great and has two great leads in Lea Seydoux as Belle and Vincent Cassel as the Beast/Prince. Of course, people are looking forward to the Disney live-action version next year, but this could hold you over.\n\nLimited Release: The Dressmaker\n\nBased on the novel by Rosalie Ham, a glamorous woman named Myrtle ‘Tilly’ Dunnage (Kate Winslet), returns to her small town in rural Australia. With her sewing machine and haute couture style, she transforms the women and exacts sweet revenge on those who did her wrong. The film also stars Liam Hemsworth, Sarah Snook, Judy Davis and Hugh Weaving.\n\nStorks (Animation – Warner Bros. Animation)\n\nStorks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby. Voice cast includes Andy Samberg, Jennifer Aniston, Ty Burrell, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Danny Trejo and Kelsey Grammer. It seems like 2016 is the year of talking animals and Storks will continue the fashion.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven (Western – Sony Pictures/Village Roadshow Pictures/MGM)\n\nBased on the classic Western that was really a remake of Akira Kurosawa’s classic Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven follows seven gun men in the west come together to help a village against a gang coming through. The film already carries some heavy hitters in director Antoine Fuqua and stars Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Peter Sarsgaard, Matt Bomer, Haley Bennett, Vincent D’Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, and Ethan Hawke. This looks pretty great to be honest. Even with the cast, I was a little hesitant, but the trailers have completely won me over.\n\n30th\n\nLimited Release: American Honey (Drama Comedy)\n\nA teenage girl (Sasha Lane) with nothing to lose joins a traveling magazine sales crew, and gets caught up in a whirlwind of hard partying, law bending and young love as she criss-crosses the Midwest with a band of misfits. The film won some awards in the film festivals it played in, and has gotten some pretty high praise. The film also stars Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough.\n\nMasterminds (Action Comedy – Relativity Media/Michaels-Goldwyn)\n\nA night guard (Zach Galifianakis) at an armored car company in the Southern U.S organizes one of the biggest bank heists in American history, problem is others on his trail, and they want the money too. The film doesn’t really look too bad – and I’m not the biggest Galifianakis fan – and again like Before I Wake trailers were put out before Relativity Media pull every movie they had off the release schedule because they filed for bankruptcy. Masterminds also stars Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon, Owen Wilson, Jason Sudeikis, Leslie Jones, Jon Daly, and Ken Marino.\n\nDeepwater Horizon (Action Drama – Lionsgate/Participant Media/Di Bonaventura Pictures)\n\nDirected by Peter Berg, Deepwater Horizon is based on the true story of the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon which exploded during April 2010 and created the worst oil spill in U.S. History. I’m sure this might still be a touchy subject with some, and people will probably say why the trailer calls the people onboard “heroes,” since they “caused it” or at least a part of it. But Deepwater Horizon still looks pretty descent. The film has a great cast of Mark Wahlberg, Dylan O’Brien, Kurt Russell, Kate Hudson, Gina Rodriguez, J.D. Evermore, and John Malkovich.\n\nMiss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children (Fantasy Adventure – 20th Century Fox/Tim Burton Productions/Chernin Entertainment/St. Petersberg Clearwater Film Commission)\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Ransom Riggs, the film follows Jacob (Asa Butterfield) who follows clues that take him to a mysterious land, where he discovers the ruins of Miss Peregrine’s School for Peculiar Children. As Jacob explores the building, he discovers that its former occupants were far more than peculiar; they possessed incredible powers. And they may still be alive. I haven’t read the book, but honestly, I’m not the biggest Tim Burton fan anymore. However, this looks pretty good. The cast also includes Eva Green as Miss Peregrine, Samuel L. Jackson, Allison Janney, Ella Purnell, Kim Dickens, Rupert Everett, Chris O’Dowd, Terence Stamp and Judi Dench.\n\nSo, what are you looking forward to?\n\nHello!\n\nIt’s July everybody! The Summer Movie Season is almost over, but it’s not going down without a fight. July has some great movies coming out, especially some anticipated movies for some. So let’s get to it.\n\n1st\n\nExpansion: Swiss Army Man\n\nLimited Release: Our Kind of Traitor\n\nBased on the novel by John le Carre, a couple find themselves lured into a Russian oligarch’s plans to defect are soon positioned between the Russian mafia and the British Secret Service, neither of whom they can trust. The film stars Ewan McGregor, Damian Lewis, Naomie Harris, Jeremy Northam, Mark Stanley, Alicia von Rittberg, Mark Gatiss and Stellan Skarsgard.\n\nThe Legend of Tarzan (Action Adventure – Warner Bros./Village Roadshow Pictures/Jerry Weintraub Productions/Dark Horse Entertainment)\n\nDirected by David Yates, the last four Harry Potter movies and the new spin Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, this new iteration of Tarzan sees Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard), who has now acclimated to life in London, is called back to the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment that ends up being a trap by Captain Rom (Christopher Waltz), who also has Jane (Margot Robbie). The film looks promising to be honest, but I didn’t know what to expect with this. The cast also includes Samuel L. Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, Jim Broadbent, Cali Nelle, and John Hurt.\n\nThe Purge: Election Year (Action Thriller – Universal Pictures/Blumhouse Productions/Platinum Dunes/Why Not Productions)\n\nSet two years after the events of The Purge: Anarchy, Sergeant (Frank Grillo) is back, now, as head of security for Senator Charlene Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell), the front runner in the Presidential election where her man platform is eliminating the Purge for good. Election Year seems to look like it’s tackling some political issues, but also going back to its horror roots, but still keeping the action thriller theme they introduced in the sequel. The film also stars Mykelti Williamson, Terry Serpico, and Joseph Julian Soria.\n\nThe BFG (Family Fantasy – Walt Disney Pictures/Amblin Entertainment/Reliance Entertainment/Walden Media and The Kennedy/Marshall Company)\n\nBased on the book by Roald Dahl of the same name, the film follows Sophie (Ruby Barnhill) who encounters a Big Friendly Giant (Mark Rylance) who, despite his intimidating appearance, turns out to be a kindhearted soul who is considered an outcast by the other giants because unlike his peers, he refuses to eat boys and girls. The BFG also stars Rebecca Hall, Bill Hader, Jemaine Clement, Olafur Darri Olafsson, and Penelope Wilton.\n\n8th\n\nLimited Release: Captain Fantastic (Drama)\n\nIn the forests of the Pacific Northwest, a father (Viggo Mortensen) devoted to raising his six kids with a rigorous physical and intellectual education is forced to leave his paradise and enter the world, challenging his idea of what it means to be a parent. The film also stars George MacKay, Samantha Isler, Annalise Basso, Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn, Missi Pyle, and Frank Langella.\n\nLimited Release: Cell (Horror Thriller)\n\nBased on the novel by Stephen King, when a mysterious cell phone signal causes apocalyptic chaos, an artist is determined to reunite with his young son in New England. I haven’t read the book, although I always wanted to, and now I have an even better reason to because the movie looks a bit generic to be honest. The film stars John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Owen Teague and Stacy Keach.\n\nMike and Dave Need Wedding Dates (Comedy – 20th Century Fox/TSG Entertainment/Cherin Entertainment)\n\nTwo brothers place an online ad to find dates for a wedding and the ad goes viral. The film stars Zac Efron, Adam DeVine, Anna Kendrick, and Aubrey Plaza. The looks pretty outrageous, and will definitely find an audience.\n\nThe Secret Life of Pets (Animation – Universal Pictures/Illumination Entertainment)\n\nThe film follows, well, the secret life of pets as Max (voiced by Louis C.K), has to not only deal with his owner bringing in a new pet in Duke (Eric Stonestreet), but the two have to work together to take down Snowball (Kevin Hart), who wants to take down happy-owned pets and their owners. I think this one could be a surprise for many and I’m looking forward to it. The voice cast also includes Lake Bell, Albert Brooks, Jenny Slate, Steve Coogan, Ellie Kemper, Bobby Moynihan, Hannibal Buress, and Dana Carvey.\n\n13th\n\nThe Infiltrator (Drama/Thriller – Broad Green Pictures)\n\nBased off the book by Robert Mazur, played by Bryan Cranston in the film, a U.S. Customs official uncovers a money laundering scheme involving Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. The film also stars John Leguizamo, Diane Kruger, Amy Ryan, Joseph Gilgun, Benjamin Bratt, Said Taghamoui, and Jason Isaacs. This one kind of snuck up on my radar, and I’m liking what I’m seeing so far.\n\n15th\n\nLimited Release: Café Society (Dramedy)\n\nThe new Woody Allen movie follows a young man (Jesse Eisenberg), who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry. There, he falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant café society that defined the spirit of the age. The film looks very Woody Allen, which is good thing, and has a pretty big-named cast of Kristen Stewart, Blake Lively, Anna Camp, Corey Stoll, Parker Posey, and Steve Carell.\n\nGhostbusters (Sci-Fi Action Comedy – Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Village Roadshow Pictures/Pascal Pictures/Feigco Entertainment)\n\nDirected by Paul Feig, the film takes a new approach to the Ghostbusters, and makes them all female now with Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, and Leslie Jones. The idea wasn’t taken too kindly by fans of the original films and even Ernie Hudson – who later took back what he said – but personally, with the team behind it, I’m looking forward to it. And guess what? If you don’t want to watch it, then don’t watch it! The film also stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Kenneth Williams, Matt Walsh, Andy Garcia, Elizabeth Perkins, Cecily Strong, Annie Potts, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Sigourney Weaver, and Bill Murray.\n\n22nd\n\nIce Age: Collision Course (Animation – 20th Century Fox/Blue Sky Studios)\n\nScrat pursuit for his elusive acorn sends his to space and he accidentally sets off a series of cosmic events that transforms and threaten the planet. Back on Earth, Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd set out to try to save themselves and meet new characters and new exotic lands. I didn’t see the last Ice Age movie and I think I’ve detached myself from the series at this point. The voice cast includes Ray Romano, Denis Leary, John Leguizamo, Keke Palmer, Wanda Skyes, Chris Wedge, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Max Greenfield, Adam DeVine, Michael Strahan, Jessie J, Simon Pegg, Jennifer Lopez and Neil deGrasse Tyson.\n\nLights Out (Horror – Warner Bros./New Line Cinema/Grey Matter Productions)\n\nBased on the short film of the same name, director David Sandberg brings his short film to the big screen that will be produced by James Wan. The short film is rather creepy and if Sandberg can bring that same atmosphere to the big screen than the film could turn out great. Teresa Palmer, Alicia Vela-Bailey, and Emily Alyn Lind star.\n\nStar Trek Beyond (Sci-Fi Adventure – Paramount Pictures/Skydance Productions/Bad Robot)\n\nJustin Lin takes over for J.J. Abrams to bring the third Star Trek outing that sees the Enterprise crew stuck on a planet facing down a new, deadly enemy. The film brings back the original cast and brings in new cast members in Sofia Boutella, Deep Roy, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Melissa Roxburgh, Joe Taslim, and Idris Elba as the villain. Of course, one of the big things going into this is the sudden death of Anton Yelchin who plays Pavel Chekov in the films.\n\n27th\n\nNerve (Mystery Thriller – Lionsgate/Allison Shearmur Productions)\n\nBased on the novel by Jeanne Ryan, a high school senior (Emma Roberts) finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, where her every move starts to become manipulated by an anonymous community of “watchers.” I don’t know how I feel about the film, the trailer was okay, but I’m not completely sold just yet. The rest of the cast includes Dave Franco, Jonny Beauchamp, Emily Meade, and Juliette Lewis.\n\n29th\n\nLimited Release: Equity (Drama)\n\nLabeled as the “first female-driven Wall Street film,” it follows a senior investment banker who is threatened by a financial scandal and must untangle a web of corruption. The film stars Anna Gunn, James Purefoy, Sarah Megan Thomas, and Alysia Reiner.\n\nLimited Release: Indignation (Drama)\n\nBased on the novel by Philip Roth, Indignation made some waves at the film festivals earlier this year and gain some very positive buzz. The film, set in 1951, follows Marcus (Logan Lerman), a working-class Jewish student from New Jersey, who attends a small Ohio college where he struggles with sexual repression and cultural disaffection, amid the ongoing Korean War. The film also stars Sarah Gadon, Ben Rosenfield, Tracy Letts, Linda Emond, Noah Robbins, Philip Ettinger and Susan Varon.\n\nBad Moms (Comedy – STX Entertainment/PalmStar Media/Block Entertainment)\n\nA woman who seems to have the perfect life – a great marriage, overachieving kids, beautiful home, stunning looks and a great career – is actually overworked and stressed out. Fed up, she joins forces with two other over-stressed moms and go on a un-mom like binge of freedom putting them up against a devoted group of perfect moms. Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell, Christina Applegate, Kathryn Hahn, Lily Singh, Emjay Anthony, Oona Laurence, and Kesha star in what looks like a great comedy.\n\nJason Bourne (Action Thriller – Universal Pictures/The Kennedy/Marshall Company/Double Negative)\n\nPaul Greengrass and Matt Damon return for another installment of the Jason Bourne series that sees Jason Bourne (Damon), now remember who he truly is, goes back to the world he thought he left behind to uncover more from his hidden past. I cannot wait any longer for this film. I love the Bourne series and seeing Damon and Greengrass return is awesome. Not only that, the films also brings back Julia Stiles and includes new (awesome) cast members Alicia Vikander, Riz Ahmed, Vincent Cassel, and Tommy Lee Jones.\n\nWhat are you looking forward to?"
