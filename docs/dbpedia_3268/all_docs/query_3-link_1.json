        "text": "Background\n\nVillage Roadshow Pictures is the American division of Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG), which in turn is a subsidiary of Australian company Village Roadshow Limited (the parent of Roadshow Entertainment, Roadshow Films, and FilmNation Entertainment).\n\nIn 1997, the company signed a five-year first-look deal with Warner Bros., which was later extended in 2012. Around that time, Bruce Berman was signed on as president of the studio. In May 2014, the company signed a co-financing production deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment, which ended in 2016. On September 27, 2021, Bruce Berman stepped down as the CEO of the company.\n\n1st Logo (December 21, 1989-1992)\n\nVisuals: Same as the Roadshow Films logo of the time, but the \"V\" is a darker shade of gold, the company name is farther from it and the text now reads \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\".\n\nVariant: A still version exists.\n\nTechnique: 2D animation.\n\nAudio: Same as the Roadshow Films logo. Otherwise, it's silent or uses the opening theme of the trailer. When run at 24 FPS, the pitch is lower as opposed to PAL sped-up.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe still version was seen on trailers for Over the Hill and Blood Oath.\n\nThe full version (without music) has been spotted on a Stan HD print of The Delinquents (1989), while the Australian DVD has the 3rd logo.\n\nA version in 4:3 with the jingle appears on the 1990 UK Warner Home Video VHS and 2000 Vision Home Entertainment VCD release of the film.\n\nLegacy: This logo was generally hard to find for the longest time, as most films the company produced at the time usually had only the logo of the film's distributor.\n\n2nd Logo (March 8, 1992-July 1, 2000)\n\nVisuals: Same as the Roadshow Films logo of the time, but with \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" in place of \"ROADSHOW FILMS\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThis logo can be cut short or still for TV shows and mini-series.\n\nSometimes, the \"PICTURES\" text is omitted.\n\nThe TV version sometimes uses the text \"A VILLAGE ROADSHOW COMPANY\".\n\nOn The New Adventures of Flipper S1 episode \"Treasure Hunt\", a blue toned version of the above variant exists.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The opening/closing theme of the film/show.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Night Man, it has the Tribune Entertainment music.\n\nFor the \"Village Roadshow\" version, it's a shortened version of the Roadshow Films music.\n\nAvailability: Only appeared on TV series and made-for-TV movies produced by the company.\n\nThe animated version is seen on The New Adventures of Flipper and Tarzan and the Lost City.\n\nThe still version can be seen on the mini-series Thorn Birds: The Missing Years, Tales of the South Seas, and the TV show Night Man, among others.\n\nThis also makes surprise appearances on Fat Pizza and December Boys.\n\n3rd Logo (October 16, 1998-June 8, 2018)\n\nLater variant\n\nLater variant (scope)\n\nVisuals: The logo starts with rows of bars turning inward extremely close to the camera, from bottom to top, as a spotlight lights up the background behind them. The spotlight fades as it zooms out to reveal the \"V\" in sky blue with a orange sheen on the left (different from the official logo). The company name in orange fades in below.\n\nLater Variant: Starting with Dark Shadows, the logo is silver, remade in higher quality, and the text is now in Calibri.\n\nTechnique: CGI by yU+Co.\n\nAudio:\n\nMarch 2, 2001-March 15, 2002: A shortened version of the Roadshow Films theme.\n\nFebruary 10, 2006-April 20, 2012: The 1996 Roadshow Entertainment theme.\n\nFebruary 24-September 23, 2016: An orchestral tune, recorded with a real orchestra in Australia and composed by Greg Dombrowski of Secession Studios with Immediate Music.\n\nOn Rogue, the 2006 theme is high-toned.\n\nMost of the time, it's silent or it uses the film's opening soundtrack.\n\nAvailability: Seen on all films from the company from Practical Magic to Ocean's 8. The 1998 version was last used on The Lucky One, but it later appeared on The Lego Movie and American Sniper (albeit as variants).\n\n4th Logo (October 4, 2019-)\n\nScope variant\n\nVisuals: Over a white spotlight background, the logo starts with the row of \"V\" bars slowly emerging one-by-one. As the camera pulls back, the company name (in Nexa Light) emerges letter-by-letter, now aligned to the right as shadows appear from behind. The entire logo is embossed onto the background.\n\nTrivia: This logo seems to be inspired by the variant seen on Collateral Beauty.\n\nVariants:\n\nA still version exists.\n\nOn Murder City, the logo is darker than usual.\n\nOn scope films (except for Murder City), the logo is zoomed out further than usual, has slightly different shading, and contains a vignette.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Trailer Park.\n\nAudio: A majestic orchestral rendition of the 1996 Roadshow Entertainment fanfare, composed by Ninja Tracks. Otherwise, none or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAvailability: First seen at the end of Joker."
