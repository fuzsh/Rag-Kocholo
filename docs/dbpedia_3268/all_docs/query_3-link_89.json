Louis was involved in negotiating and structuring deals with distribution partners across various platforms (streaming, premium cable, and theatrical features), and for production specific needs on a project to project basis. He acted as MRC’s point person with the financial community, was responsible for ensuring access to capital during a high growth period, and oversaw all finance, accounting, and tax aspects of the company.

He received his initial training in public accounting at PricewaterhouseCoopers in the audit and consulting arenas. He began his career in the entertainment industry when he subsequently joined New Regency Productions, having a long tenure with the company as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Spending nearly two decades working in a high growth and dynamic global production and financing environment, Louis handled all aspects of corporate finance, planning, accounting, production, and distribution through Warner Bros. and Fox. He also oversaw direct sales and distribution for international TV and was the key liaison to all areas of New Regency’s studio partners and global investors. New Regency’s best known film and TV titles at the time include JFK, LA Confidential, Heat, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Malcolm in the Middle, and The Bernie Mac Show.\n\nLouis is a native of the Los Angeles area and was the Founding President of Simi Valley Lacrosse.
