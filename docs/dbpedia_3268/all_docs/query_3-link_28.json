        "text": "Happy #InternationalWomensDay from Village Roadshow Group! Today, we celebrate the remarkable achievements and contributions of women around the world. At Village Roadshow Group we are proud to honour the strength, resilience, and talent of women in our organisation and beyond. Together, let's continue to empower and uplift each other, break barriers, and create a more inclusive and diverse world. In celebration, Village Roadshow Group celebrated all week long, highlighting some of our amazing team’s thoughts on this year’s theme #InspireInclusion. “Inclusion isn't just about diversity; it's about actively valuing and integrating everyone's voice, experiences and perspectives. Each unique viewpoint improves our understanding and fosters innovation. Let's ensure every voice is heard, every perspective is respected, and celebrate our differences!” – Tamara Joy, Head of People and Culture. On Thursday 7 March, as part of our celebrations we invited keynote speaker and award-winning author Megumi Miki, to share her insights on the topic of ‘Everyday Inclusion: Unlock the quiet superpowers in yourself and others’, and following this we hosted a special lunch for our team. During her talk, Megumi shared powerful insights on the theme of “being quietly powerful in the workplace” and the benefits those with quieter voices can make in leadership roles, and in teams. She also challenged us to consider: what can we do to better support and celebrate the quieter individuals among us, ensuring all voices are heard? The day was a celebration of the strength and potential of everyone in our organisation, and we are so excited to continue our commitment to championing diversity and inclusivity at Village Roadshow Group throughout 2024 and beyond. #InternationalWomensDay #VillageRoadshow #InspireInclusion"
