        "text": "Almost 10 years after my debut in the industry I finally made it to Gold Coast to check out Village Roadshow’s theme parks, which serve in many ways as benchmarks in Asia.\n\nMy first stop is Warner Bros Movie World, their most popular parks and home of numerous IP’s from DC Comics and Warner Bros. I am very interested to see how they treat IP’s that are not their own in the context of several IP setbacks in Asia (Dreamworks at Movie Animation Park Studios and 20th Century Fox at Resorts World Genting).\n\nIt is a beautiful hot summer day in the first week back to school but right in the middle of the Chinese New Year holiday so lots of Asian visitors (Hong Kong, Mainland China), some Australians and quite a few New Caledonians and Arabs. I bought a 3-day multi-park pass, which cost me only AUD129.\n\nMy views in a few words\n\nDefinitely worth the visit, great value for money, a good offering for all ages (Looney Tunes for young kids, great coaster for young adults and shows & shaded main hub with lots of tables and seats for families) and for all visitor origins (popular IP’s).\n\nThe quality of the music playlist, F&B offering (good variety, fresh and reasonably priced) contributed to make the park grow on me as the day passed. I arrived a bit skeptical and overwhelmed by an overload of slightly “dated” theming and left simply happy with a big smile. What more could Village Roadshow ask for?\n\nWhat I particularly liked\n\nSUPERMAN Escape roller coaster – Definitely the most popular ride in the park (45min wait). Simple and on-point theming with great consistency between the waiting area (MRT train station) and the ride (MRT train track with waste water flowing, walls falling). Super smooth and great speed sensations.\n\nGood choice of roller coasters for young adults with DC RIVALS HYPERCOASTER, GREEN LANTERN and ARKHAM ASYLUM, all very smooth and featuring well positioned viewing areas where friends can watch and take pictures.\n\nWild West Falls Adventure Ride – fun flume ride in a Disney-quality environment (quality Wild West theming and beautiful landscape).\n\nThe Looney Tunes kids area – very cute, well themed, arranged around a square with benches under the shade of a big tree (where old people were sleeping) and featuring cool kids attractions such as the covered Junior Driving School with a track designed as a mini Warner Bros Movie World theme park, the adorable Speedy Gonzales’ Tijuana Taxis and a popular water play area.\n\nIn-park pricing from the AUD59 family meal combo (2 adults, 2 kids) to the merchandise deal combos in a bag.\n\nWhat I didn’t like so much\n\nJUSTICE LEAGUE 3D – Another case supporting my theory that 3D shooting dark rides are totally overrated and probably imposed by ride manufacturers for the lack of better options: poor animation quality, shooting device not working half the time, storyline all over the place, in short boring and frustrating.\n\nMerchandising is a bit messy with different quality levels and too many brands.\n\nWhat I am not sure about\n\nThe park made an effort to address the strong Asian visitorship with Chinese New Year decorations, but they looked a bit simple. A good idea but failing in execution.\n\nAQUAMAN – The Exhibition features amazing (and surely expensive) props from the movie but the lack of interactivity and dark setting is probably not ideal for a theme park like this.\n\nThis leads to my comment on the treatment of IPs. There is a lot of IP content and theming but the treatment is not quite consistent and it shows the park owners don’t own the IP’s (one of the main concerns for our industry). For example the treatment of DC IP’s is from a different generation and it would be very expensive to change it all each time a new movie is released. Another example is the SCOOBY-DOO Spooky Coaster Next Generation, which even after upgrade still looks outdated.\n\nMerlin calls them midway attractions, Village Roadshow boxes, others still call them FEC. Whatever you want to call them, let me tell you they’re hot right now in Asia!\n\nThey were made popular by Merlin Entertainments, whose strategy essentially relies on clustering a bunch of them to generate synergies and economies of scale. It’s about multiplying the gates to make more $$ out of each visitor and saving on marketing $$.\n\nIn Asia they become the tools of the new lords of urbanization who need them to bring the culture and lifestyle they need to please both the authorities and the new urban consuming class.\n\nExamples of such new lords are Wang Jianlin (Wanda, China), Zhang Xin (SOHO, China) and Pham Nhat Vuong (Vincom, Vietnam). They have been early in embracing the trend and adding ‘cultural & lifestyle’ attractions and entertainment to their property developments to serve the ‘communities’ living around their projects and attract new ‘visitors’.\n\nAuthorities love a good box too and it’s always easier to give land or permits when developers lure them with content and facilities that help them with their education and tourism objectives.\n\nBut this is not a new phenomenon. There is a long tradition of quality indoor attractions in Europe and America, often used for similar purposes but in different contexts of urban redevelopment. Some of the world’s best attractions are science centres and natural history museums part of such urban projects e.g. Cité des Sciences et de l’Industrie in Paris or M Shed Museum in Bristol.\n\nEnough theory.\n\nI thought I would list some of the popular international concepts of boxes already available in Asia.\n\nKidZania (Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Tokyo, Osaka)\n\nMadame Tussauds (Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Tokyo, Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Seoul)\n\nSEA LIFE (Bangkok, Busan)\n\nLEGOLAND Discovery Centre (Tokyo, Osaka)\n\nGrévin (Seoul)\n\nWe are also seeing an increased interest from IP owners to come up with Location Based Entertainment (LBE) concepts to fit in a box.\n\nDreamWorks recently opened DreamPlay at City of Dreams Manila\n\nAngry Bird opened an Activity Park in Johor, Malaysia and is planning more in Asia\n\nBBC Worldwide is working on concepts for their Top Gear, CBeebies, Walking with Dinosaurs brands with FORREC\n\nWarner Bros & DC Comics are collaborating with Melco for an FEC and dark ride at the new Studio City Macau\n\nCartoon Network and UBISOFT are also working on concepts (for more details please contact the author!)\n\nOne of the problems for such licensors is to find someone they can trust to operate. And this is where operators such as Village Roadshow and Parques Reunidos are coming in.\n\nRetailers are also tempted to do their own concepts and roll them out. Parkson recently announced a concept of Little Kingdom edutainment centre in Malaysia and AEON is working on rolling out its Molly Fantasy and Kidzoona concepts in its malls in Thailand.\n\nNow let’s look a bit further in the future and let’s try to make sense of the recent announcement from Centre Pompidou to open pop-up branches in China. Actually it’s not the first time that a European cultural institution would be looking into China for growth. Both V&A and CORPUS Journey Through the Human Body – and probably a number of others I missed – have announced China plans.\n\nThis could be the future of boxes once the lords get tired of IP-based concepts (too commercial, too expensive) and realize that it is not easy to develop sustainable cultural attractions. And now I am suddenly realizing I could have been ahead of the game when I proposed to work with French museum operator Culturespaces for the Central Police Station in Hong Kong…"
