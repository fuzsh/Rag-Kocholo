        "text": "“I just want to know what the hell is going on!” Jupiter Jones cries, sounding like a confused teen girl might if her mom was dropping her off at Target instead of the mall.\n\nIt’s a question that no doubt will be asked by many in the audience long before this point in “Jupiter Ascending,” and one you’d think would have been figured out before a reported $175 million — before marketing — was spent on the original sci-fi action adventure from siblings Lana and Andy Wachowski.\n\nMila Kunis stars as the title character in the film, which is being released in 3-D and 2-D. She plays a young Chicago woman named after the largest planet in our solar system. Jupiter has grown with visions of stars, but instead finds herself as an adult toiling in her uncle’s house-cleaning business. Scrubbing out toilets seems to be her specialty. (We mention this because of how often she is shown doing it.)\n\nHer father, an astrophysicist, was murdered in Russia before she was born and her mother gave birth to her on the passage to the U.S., where the two would join her aunt’s family. There, Jupiter and her mother (Maria Doyle Kennedy) have inexplicably settled for dusting and mopping rather than pursuing an American dream.\n\nHer family is no prize. Her uncle just pushes them to slavishly work. Her greedy, lazy cousin (Kick Gurry) wants her to sell her eggs to a fertility clinic, and Jupiter doesn’t blink when he says he will take two-thirds of the money.\n\nMeanwhile, out there in the universe, three scheming siblings of the ruling royal family Abrasax are vying for rights to Earth, which their race had originally seeded and believe it is now ripe for reaping.\n\nTheir mother once owned the planet, but it turns out Jupiter can stop their plans. Somehow the unaware young woman is a genetic reincarnation of the siblings’ mother and can reclaim Earth. One of the three, Balem (Oscar nominee Eddie Redmayne from “The Theory of Everything”), dispatches assassins to deal with her. Another, Titus (Douglas Booth), with devious plans of his own, sends Caine (Channing Tatum), a genetically designed soldier with wolf DNA, to bring her back to him. The third, Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), has her own agenda.\n\nWhen Jupiter is on the clinic’s table about to have her eggs removed, the assassins make their move. Caine, as you might guess, swoops in to protect her. Chaos ensues, including the destruction of large swaths of Chicago. Though she has been tossed around like a rag doll in the fight to save her, Jupiter doesn’t seem too shaken or surprised when Caine apprises her of the situation, including that she is royalty.\n\nBesides, she thinks he is cute.\n\n“Your Majesty, I have more in common with a dog than I have with you,” Caine tells Jupiter. “I love dogs, I’ve always loved dogs,” she replies, liking the way he calls her “Your Majesty.”\n\nAt best, “Jupiter Ascending” might be called a shaggy-dog story. While the film stitches together elements of classical drama, “Oz” and sci-fi heroes’ journeys like “Star Wars,” the Wachowskis don’t spend much time integrating them into anything original, and like many of these overpriced fantasies, the film tries to cover up its holes with dizzying but ultimately mind-numbing action and noise.\n\nLast week, while on a panel at the Sundance Film Festival, “Star Wars” creator George Lucas noted that movies today are “more and more circus without any substance behind it.”\n\n“Star Wars” drew on some of the same sources — a space Western with archetypal heroes — but Lucas created a viable universe, which allowed for characters to develop and struggle with choices of good and evil. Decades later, people remain interested.\n\nLike “Star Wars,” the protagonist of “Jupiter Ascending” is someone clueless about her destiny. But Luke had warrior skills and ambitions; Jupiter has a toilet brush. It’s curious that such a passive woman would be put at the heart of the story today.\n\nDespite the cool special effects for the time, “Star Wars” spent most of its time developing its story and characters. Now, filmmakers spend large chunks of movies mindlessly destroying cities, without anyone caring. Remember the Death Star’s destruction of the planet Alderaan? Poof, and then a bit of superb acting by the great Alec Guinness made us feel it.\n\nThere are no moments like that in “Jupiter Ascending.” The Wachowskis should know better. They made their mark with “The Matrix” trilogy, which in its first film created an interesting futuristic world that audiences could understand through its slightly paranoid protagonist, Neo (Keanu Reeves). Ultimately the franchise self-destructed by the overwrought third film, though it made money.\n\nThe duo’s next film, “Speed Racer,” based on a Japanese anime series, failed at the box office. The Wachowskis’ last film, “Cloud Atlas,” based on the 2004 novel by David Mitchell, was a noble effort to bring something different to the screen — a smart, multi-storyline sci-fi fantasy with themes of reincarnation and destiny. It, too, failed at the box office.\n\nConsidering some of the sci-fi dreck from Hollywood in the last couple of decades, “Jupiter Ascending” isn’t that bad of a film, just one we have seen before in more interesting ways. The Wachowskis can still fashion some spectacular looking, intricate visuals, especially in the design of the other worlds where the Abrasax family lives.\n\nThe cast is universally fine, populated for the most part with British thespians you might recognize from some excellent BBC series. The problem is no one is given much to work with; there are too many characters and too little time to tell their stories since so much of the film is bang-bang, crash-crash.\n\nRedmayne is a wonderful actor, but as Balem, he is asked to do little more than exude evil and exhibit a mommy complex, which he does well. Booth and Middleton are solid as his siblings, more memorable for their good-looking presence than anything they do.\n\nTatum, as we have seen most recently in “Foxcatcher,” is an actor with depth, but you can only do so much as a dog soldier. I’ve always liked Kunis’ onscreen presence, but I can’t figure out the character and I’m not sure the actress did, either.\n\nPerhaps the weirdest bit in the movie is when Jupiter, trying to secure her title to Earth, runs into a succession of funky-looking outer-space petite bureaucrats. Just as you take notice and wonder if you have wandered into a sci-fi version of Terry Gilliam’s “Brazil,” Gilliam shows up as one of the cranky officials. Ah, kind of a cool joke, but it hasn’t much connection to the film. But then you realize, neither do you."
