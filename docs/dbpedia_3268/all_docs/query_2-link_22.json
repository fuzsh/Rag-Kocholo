        "text": "Village Roadshow has put together another strong slate of films between their first-look deal at Warner Bros. and a smaller co-financing deal at Sony Pictures Entertainment. At Warner Bros., Village Roadshow Pictures, under the tutelage of chairman and CEO Bruce Berman, is co-financing/producing another seven films in 2015 with hopes to raise that number to eight to 12 per year. Their slate, to date, from both studios is as follows (with release dates):\n\nAt Warner Bros., pictures include Mad Max: Fury Road, which will be released May 14 followed by San Andreas (via New Line) for release on Memorial Day weekend, specifically May 29. Next up for them will be In The Heart Of The Sea with Chris Hemsworth which bows in theaters December 11. Two other films are being put together for 2016: King Arthur, which is currently in production; and Tarzan, set for release on July 1, 2016 with Margot Robbie and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nAt Sony, their deal began with the Antoine Fuqua-helmed The Equalizer starring Denzel Washington, then the Annie remake. Other films via Sony is the Louis Leterrier-directed Grimsby starring Sacha Baron Cohen which will be released February 26, 2016, and the Goosebumps feature adaptation to be released this October 16. One of the more high-profile films with Sony will be the NFL drama Concussion, which stars Will Smith and gets a Christmas release.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFollowing the ginormous successes of The Lego Movie and Clint Eastwood’s American Sniper –– both of which have grossed half a billion each worldwide for Warner Bros. — Village Roadshow Pictures’ also produced the box office disappointment Jupiter Ascending. Although they shouldered that, the deal at Sony allows them to take a smaller risk and on only on a smattering of pictures. Sony continues to keep most of its territories internationally.\n\nIt’s no wonder that Village Roadshow is huddling with investment banker Moelis & Co. to put together about $400 million in equity. With that, the company would be allowed to fulfill its ambitions and help out Warner Bros. and Sony’s slate of films. Village Roadshow co-financed and produced seven films in 2014 and 2015.\n\nVillage Roadshow previously brought in new capital in 2012 when it struck a debt and equity deal for $275 million with Trinity Opportunities Limited. The new equity search for $400 million was first reported via Bloomberg News."
