        "text": "Logo descriptions by mr3urious and LogoArchive\n\nDescription: Village Roadshow Pictures is the American subsidiary of the Australian media company Village Roadshow Entertainment Group (VREG), co-producing most of its major films alongside Warner Bros. Pictures. Established by company executive Greg Coote in 1989 from remnants of the De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, it released its first film, The Delinquents, later that year on December 21.\n\nVillage Roadshow has produced many successful films alongside Warner Bros. such as The Matrix series, Sherlock Holmes, The LEGO Movie, the Ocean's series, and more. They also co-produced a few films with Sony Pictures Releasing from 2014 to 2016, including The Equalizer and the 2014 remake of Annie. On December 14, 2021, the studio signed a pact with Fox Entertainment to distribute several new films for the Tubi streaming service. The first film under the new pact, Cinnamon, was released on Tubi on June 23, 2023.\n\n1st Logo (December 5, 1985-1992)[]\n\nNickname: \"V of Gold\"\n\nLogo: Same as the Roadshow Home Video logo at the time, but the \"V\" is a darker shade of gold, the text \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" is farther from the \"V\" and the lasers don't form \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW CORPORATION\" and disappear instead.\n\nTrivia: The logo is based off the Roadshow Home Video logo of the era.\n\nVariant: A still version exists.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the Roadshow Home Video logo, minus the lasers forming the text. None for the still version.\n\nMusic/Sounds: Same as the Roadshow Home Video logo, silence or the opening theme of the trailer.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant: When played at 24 frames per second, the theme is lower-pitched.\n\nAvailability: Extremely rare. Most of the time, the home video version would be used in this logo's place on releases from the era, but it can still be found on some. The still version was seen on trailers for Over the Hill (1992; can be found on the UK VHS of Strictly Ballroom) and Blood Oath (1990; can be found on the Australian VHS of The Fabulous Baker Boys). The full version (without music) has been spotted on an Stan HD print of The Delinquents, while the Australian DVD has the 1998 logo in its place. A version in 4:3 with the jingle appears on the 1990 UK Warner Home Video VHS and iTunes version (no doubt using the same WHV master in 24fps) of the former. This also appears on at least one widescreen print of Dead Calm before the 1984 WB shield. Don't expect to see it on Live's VHS release of Bloodmoon, though rumors circulate a German Blu-ray (using the Australian theatrical cut) or a Live screener may contain it.\n\n2nd Logo (1992-April 24, 1998, September 14, 2007)[]\n\nLogo: Same as the Roadshow Films logo of the time, but with \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" underneath the \"V\".\n\nVariants:\n\nThis logo can be cut short or still for TV show and mini-series.\n\nThere is a variation where it just says \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW\"\n\nThe TV version might have the text \"A VILLAGE ROADSHOW COMPANY\".\n\nOn The New Adventures of Flipper S1 episode \"Treasure Hunt\", a blue tinted version of the above variant exists.\n\nFX/SFX: Same as the Roadshow Films logo.\n\nMusic/Sounds: The opening or closing theme of the show.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant: On Nightman, it has the Tribune Entertainment music playing over it.\n\nAvailability: Fairly common. The animated version is seen on The New Adventures of Flipper and Tarzan and the Lost City. The still version can be seen on the mini-series Thorn Birds: The Missing Years, Tales of the South Seas, and the TV show Nightman, among others. This also makes a surprise appearance on December Boys. Don't expect this to appear on Fortress (1993).\n\n3rd Logo (October 16, 1998-June 8, 2018)[]\n\nNicknames: \"The Other V of Steel\", \"V of Heaven\"\n\nLogo: Sort of like the 1980s New World Pictures logo, we see rows of bars turning inward extremely close to the camera, from bottom to top. A spotlight lights up the background behind them. The spotlight fades as we zoom out to reveal a large stylized filled triangle made up of six progressively smaller V's. \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" fades in below.\n\nVariants:\n\nStarting May 11, 2012 with Dark Shadows, the logo was remastered. The font for \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\" is now in the Calibri font instead of the corporate one, and the color was changed to silver.\n\nOn Ready Player One, the logo plays in warp speed.\n\nFX/SFX: The forming of the \"V\", animated by YU+Co.\n\nMusic/Sounds:\n\n1998-2005: A shortened version of the Roadshow Films theme.\n\n2005-: Uses the Roadshow Entertainment music.\n\n2016-: A nice orchestral tune composed by Greg Dombrowski of Secession Studios. First heard on The Brothers Grimsby.\n\nIn other cases, it uses the opening movie theme or music from any given soundtrack.\n\nMusic/Sounds Variant: On Rogue, there is a high toned variant of the 2005 version.\n\nAvailability: Very common. Appears on movies produced by Village Roadshow during this period such as Cats & Dogs, Happy Feet, Zoolander, and No Reservations. It first appeared on Practical Magic, released on October 16, 1998. The last film to use the original variant was The Lucky One, and made its final overall appearance on Ocean's 8.\n\nEditor's Note: The logo most people associate the company with. The animation over its two decade span held up well, and its music is very relaxing as well.\n\n4th Logo (October 4, 2019-Present)[]\n\nNicknames: \"V of Heaven II\"\n\nLogo: On a white background, rows of protruding curved bars start to emerge from bottom to top, forming a simplified version of the \"V\" as seen in the previous logos. The camera slowly zooms out and pans to the right of the \"V\" to make room for \"VILLAGE ROADSHOW PICTURES\", with each letter forming in the same way from left to right. After the logo fully forms, the camera stops panning.\n\nVariant: At the end of Joker (where it debuted), it is still.\n\nFX/SFX: The \"V\" and text appearing. None for the still variant.\n\nMusic/Sounds: An orchestral version of the Roadshow Films theme, composed by Ninja Tracks. In other cases, it's silent or uses the film's opening theme.\n\nAvailability: Current. It debuted at the end of Joker as a still variant and made its animated opening debut on The Matrix Resurrections (as a variant). Expected to be seen on future films by the company."
