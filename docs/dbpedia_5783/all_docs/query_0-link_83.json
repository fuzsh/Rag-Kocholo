        "text": "The Iban tribe in Borneo did not die out; they remain one of the largest indigenous groups in the region. However, they have faced challenges such as deforestation, loss of lands, and modernization which have impacted their way of life. Efforts are being made to preserve their culture and traditions.\n\nWhat are the influences of Borneo in the Philippine culture?\n\nBorneo has influenced Philippine culture through trade, language, and traditions. There are similarities in traditional music, dances, and food between the two regions. The influence can also be seen in the use of certain words in Filipino languages that have Malay or Indonesian origins.\n\nWhat Philippine tribe was found in the 1970s?\n\nThe Tasaday tribe in the Philippines was discovered in the 1970s. They gained international attention for their alleged &quot;Stone Age&quot; lifestyle, but later investigations suggested that the tribe may have been staged for publicity.\n\nWho was the leader of the Indian tribe?\n\nThe leader of an Indian tribe is typically known as the chief. The chief is responsible for making decisions, leading the tribe, and representing the tribe in various matters. However, it's important to note that there are many different Indian tribes with individual leaders, each with their own unique leadership structure."
