The Iban people are an indigenous group located in Sarawak, Malaysia. They traditionally live in longhouses made of bamboo and tree bark that can house multiple families along a main river. Their culture revolves around rice harvesting festivals like Gawai Dayak, which is celebrated on May 31-June 1. As part of the festival, they perform ceremonies involving tuak (rice wine), ranyai, and the miring ceremony. Other aspects of Iban culture include traditional foods, clothing like the pua kumbu, dances like the ngajat, and crafts such as weaving, beadwork, and wood carving. Their tattoos also symbolize warrior bravery.",
