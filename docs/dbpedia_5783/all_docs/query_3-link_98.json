        "text": "â\n\nIBAN numbers are short codes that are used to identify bank accounts all around the world.\n\nâ\n\nThese numbers refer to accounts at specific financial institutions. IBAN numbers were initially used in the EU, but they have since been adopted in other parts of the world including the Middle East and the Caribbean.\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers are formatted in such a way so as to reduce transcription errors through the use of checksums and standardized formatting. This ensures that payments are routed to the correct location.\n\nâ\n\nThe IBAN standard was brought into usage by various groups and standards bodies. It was initially adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS).\n\nâ\n\nIn 1997, the International Organization for Standardization formalized IBAN by publishing the ISO 13616 standard. Over time, various updates to the standard have increased or decreased IBANâs flexibility depending on demand from those involved.\n\nâ\n\nToday, national central banks and standards bodies can request their own IBAN format. The IBAN standard was updated in 2020 so that SWIFT became the registration authority for IBAN formats.\n\nâ\n\nThe widespread use of IBAN means you will likely encounter these numbers whether you live in Europe or abroad. Hereâs what you should know.\n\nâ\n\nWhat Does An IBAN Number Look Like?\n\nâ\n\nEach IBAN number consists of a string of characters. A specific IBAN number might look like this example, which identifies a bank account in the U.K.:\n\nâ\n\nGB33 BUKB 2020 1555 5555 55\n\nâ\n\nAn IBAN number may contain up to 34 different letters and numbers (an alphanumeric code). But, as seen in the example above, it may be shorter. Some national IBAN codes contain as few as 15 characters.\n\nâ\n\nRegardless of the length, characters are usually separated into groups of four for readability.\n\nâ\n\nEach position in an IBAN number represents specific information. The first and second positions indicate a country. In the example above, the letters âGBâ indicate that the IBAN account is located at a bank in the U.K.\n\nâ\n\nThe third and fourth characters contain a âchecksumâ that can be processed to validate the rest of the code.\n\nâ\n\nThe fifth to eighth characters identify a particular bank or financial institution, either with numbers or letters. In the above example, the characters âBUKBâ indicate that the bank account is at Barclayâs.\n\nâ\n\nThe remaining characters represent a Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN). This data contains an individual account number, a bank branch identifier, and other information. BBAN numbers add extra flexibility and information capacity to the IBAN standard.\n\nâ\n\nHow Does An IBAN Number Work?\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers are generally processed by banks and financial institutions in order to route payments to another bank or financial institution.\n\nâ\n\nThe bank in question must decode an IBAN number to obtain routing information from it. In fact, anyone can decode an IBAN number by using the validator on IBAN.com.\n\nâ\n\nThe process of decoding an IBAN number also involves validating that number. Any IBAN checking tool will validate a code by converting it into an integer and performing a mathematical operation on it. This validation process can determine whether characters are substituted, transposed, and shifted, and it can detect most other errors as well.\n\nâ\n\nThe IBAN number is valid if this operation produces the expected mathematic result. However, most tools will simply indicate whether the code is valid or not in plain language.\n\nâ\n\nOnce the IBAN number is decoded and validated, the payment in question is processed and routed to its destination---that is, it is routed to the bank account of the recipient.\n\nâ\n\nA transaction sent to an IBAN account can be carried out through any payment or settlement network.\n\nâ\n\nHow Do I Find My IBAN Number?\n\nâ\n\nYou can determine your IBAN number by looking at your bank statement. This information is usually found in the top-right hand corner of any bank statement.\n\nâ\n\nOften, you can also find your IBAN number in your online banking account or in your bankâs mobile app. Sometimes you can even find it on your payment card or debit card.\n\nâ\n\nYou can also determine an IBAN number by entering certain information into an online form. IBAN.com contains an IBAN calculator. There, you can input a country code, sort code, and account number to determine a valid IBAN code based on that information.\n\nâ\n\nIf you are not sure where to find your IBAN number, contact your bank. A representative will either tell you your IBAN number or tell you how to find it.\n\nâ\n\nWhich Countries Are IBAN Numbers Used In?\n\nâ\n\nAccording to IBAN.com, at least 79 countries make it mandatory or recommend using IBAN numbers for international transfers.\n\nâ\n\nMajor European countries with mandatory IBAN use for international transactions include France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands, and Ukraine. Over 20 other European countries also have mandatory use of IBAN as well.\n\nNordic countries with mandatory use of IBAN for international transactions include Denmark, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the Faroe Islands.\n\nMiddle Eastern countries with mandatory use of IBAN for international transactions include Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nâ\n\nVarious countries in Africa, South America, Central America, and the Carribbean also have mandatory use of IBAN for international transfers.\n\nâ\n\nIn some countries, IBAN is merely recommended for international transactions. Those countries include the U.K., Brazil, Egypt, El Salvador, Libya, and Pakistan, among others.\n\nâ\n\nSome of the above countries consider IBAN mandatory for international transactions, but not for domestic transactions. Refer to IBAN.comâs full list of countries for more details.\n\nâ\n\nBanks in other countries may also recognize and process IBAN numbers. For example, although banks in the U.S. and North America do not use IBAN numbers for their own accounts, they may decode IBAN numbers in order to route a payment.\n\nâ\n\nWhatâs The Difference Between IBAN, SWIFT & BIC Numbers?\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers are different from other types of identifier codes and numbers---particularly SWIFT numbers, which are also known as BICs (Bank Identifier Codes).\n\nâ\n\nDifference 1: Bank vs. Account Routing\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers identify a bank plus an account number. This means that IBAN numbers alone can be used to direct funds to a particular bank account.\n\nâ\n\nSWIFT numbers, on the other hand, only identify a bank (or a bank branch) and do not identify specific bank accounts. It is only with additional routing steps and information that SWIFT can be used to deposit funds into a specific account.\n\nâ\n\nBanks sometimes request more than one type of number to increase the likelihood that a transaction reaches its intended destination. As such, IBAN and SWIFT codes are often used together.\n\nâ\n\nDifference 2: Global Coverage\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers are primarily used in Europe and other nearby countries. The 79 countries that use IBAN numbers account for less than half of the worldâs nations.\n\nâ\n\nSWIFT numbers, on the other hand, are used much more widely around the world. At least 200 countries and regions use SWIFT numbers as of 2022.\n\nâ\n\nHowever, both systems are globally recognized. Though SWIFT codes have wider adoption, countries that do not use IBAN numbers may still refer to IBAN numbers for routing information.\n\nâ\n\nDifference 3: Format\n\nSWIFT codes and IBAN numbers have specific formats.\n\nâ\n\nSWIFT codes adhere to the ISO 9362 standard, also called the Business Identifier Code (BIC). The BIC code includes a bankâs business party prefix, country code, business party suffix, and, optionally, a branch code. These codes are 8 to 11 characters long.\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers adhere to the ISO 13616 standard. They may be considerably longer than SWIFT codes, as they can contain up to 34 characters. IBAN numbers also include a BBAN number, which is very flexible in terms of the information it includes.\n\nâ\n\nUltimately, both IBAN numbers and SWIFT codes contain very different information despite the fact that they are both used for related purposes.\n\nâ\n\nWhatâs The Difference Between An IBAN Number & An Account Number?\n\nâ\n\nIBAN numbers and bank account numbers are both used to route payments to a bank account.\n\nâ\n\nEvery IBAN number contains an individual bank account number. More specifically, each IBAN number ends with a Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN).\n\nâ\n\nThis means IBAN numbers contain sufficient information to route payments to an international account. Meanwhile, bank account numbers alone can be used to route payments domestically.\n\nâ\n\nIf you do not reside in a country that uses IBAN codes, your bank may use another unrelated format for account numbers.\n\nâ\n\nWhen Is An IBAN Number Needed?\n\nâ\n\nYou might need to use an IBAN number if you are making a transaction to a foreign country, either through your bank or through an online payment service.\n\nâ\n\nYou will typically need to provide a recipientâs IBAN number when you send a transaction. Your bank may also provide you with another way to send the transaction, in which case you might not need to provide an IBAN number at all.\n\nâ\n\nIf you are receiving funds, you will need to give your IBAN number to the individual who is paying you. The sender will in turn need to provide that number when they send the transaction.\n\nâ\n\nYou may not need to use an IBAN number if you are sending a domestic transaction, if you are sending a transaction to another client at your bank, or if you are sending a transaction to a country that does not use the IBAN standard.\n\nâ\n\nContact a bank representative if you are not sure whether you need to use an IBAN number.\n\nâ\n\nIs It Safe To Give Out Your IBAN Number?\n\nâ\n\nItâs perfectly safe to give out your IBAN number, as IBAN numbers are designed to route transactions to between individual bank accounts.\n\nâ\n\nItâs also safe to ask to ask another person or company for their IBAN number. If you are sending money abroad, you will probably need to know the IBAN number of the recipient before you make your transaction.\n\nâ\n\nYou should be cautious with bank statements and other documents containing your IBAN number and other personal and banking data. Criminals can commit fraud or identity theft if they also gain access to all of your information in one place.\n\nâ\n\nHowever, there is no reason to worry about giving out your IBAN number on its own.\n\nâ\n\nPaysetâs IBAN Solution\n\nâ\n\nAt Payset, we provide dedicated IBAN accounts with a wide variety of features.
