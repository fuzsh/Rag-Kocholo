        "text": "THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\nDivision of Banks\n\nMERRIMACK VALLEY CREDIT UNION (MERRIMACK VALLEY), Lawrence, Massachusetts has petitioned the Commissioner of Banks for permission to (1) merge with CABOT BOSTON CREDIT UNION (CABOT), Boston, Massachusetts; and (2) as part of this merger transaction, amend the bylaws of MERRIMACK VALLEY to include CABOTâ€™s current membership eligibility. Under the terms of the merger, CABOT will merge with and into MERRIMACK VALLEY under the charter, bylaws, and name of MERRIMACK VALLEY. The main office of MERRIMACK VALLEY would remain the main office of the continuing credit union and the sole banking office of CABOT would be retained as a branch office. Any objections or comments relative to this proposal must be communicated in writing to the Commissioner of Banks, 1000 Washington Street, 10th Floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02118 or via electronic mail to dob.comments@mass.gov no later than August 29, 2024. A public hearing may be held if the response is considered significant or circumstances warrant such a hearing, as determined by the Commissioner. The petitioner's application and all communications relative to this application are available from the Division by request at dob.rao@mass.gov.\n\nMARY L. GALLAGHER\n\nCommissioner of Banks"
