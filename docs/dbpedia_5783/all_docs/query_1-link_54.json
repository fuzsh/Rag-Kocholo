        "text": "This is me standing in front of the school on the last day (23 September 2022)\n\nWhere?\n\nAfter finishing my Bachelor of Teaching (Honours) Teaching English as a Second Language from Institute of Teacher Education, International Languages Campus, Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur in December 2017, I was assigned to Methodist National Primary School in Kapit, Sarawak.\n\nIt is located at a rural town 3 hours from a nearby town. From 2018 until 2020, the main transportation to the town was boat express that operated from 6.30a.m. until 3.30p.m. After the hour, I could not leave the place as there was no other transport to connect to the nearby town, Sibu.\n\nThe boat express was not that bad but I hated using then when it was raining and when I had to cross the other boats to reach the wharf. I hated the most when the boat swayed from one side to the other side. I am scared when I feel I am not stable.\n\nThis was the interior of one of the boat express that I took during the pandemic in 2020.\n\nThankfully, in the mid of 2020, there is a road connecting from Kapit to Sibu. It is such a relief to be able to connected using land where I can go to Sibu for any emergency services. When the accessibility increases, all the boat expresses ceased to operate. Since 2020, I have been using a van for my trip to the school. The 3-hours road trip to Kapit from Sibu is not a bliss. It is full of turns and mountains. If I am not feeling well during that day, I would take the medicine to have a pleasant journey.\n\nIf you are not well, please eat the car sick medicine before you take the road trip from Sibu to Kapit or vice versa.\n\nThis shows the road condition from Sibu to Kapit.\n\n2. Population?\n\nMost of the population in Sarawak are indigenous people. In Kapit, the largest population is Iban or Sea Dayak people. They mostly communicate in Iban language. All 34 pupils of mine are indigenous people where mostly is Iban and two are Punan.\n\nI did not know how to speak Iban language when I went there for the first time. Just after three years of teaching them, I acquired the language where I can communicate and understand the language. It is amazing how I learned the language through listening and speaking my pupils, colleagues and people surrounding me speaking the language.\n\nThese are my Year 4 pupils wearing their traditional costumes.\n\n3. Difficulty\n\nThe most difficult part of the first three years of working was the language. I could not understand the language my pupils were saying. I found myself just saying ‘yes’ to the things my pupils ask me if I could not understand them. However, the teachers in the school are very friendly. I would remember the words that they said in the class and I would ask my colleagues what does it mean. If I had certain important announcement I had to tell my pupils, I would ask a teacher who could speak the language to help me inform the pupils in Iban language.\n\nAsk a teacher that could understand the language to translate the words for you or give an important announcement to the class.\n\nSecondly, in a rural area, the amenities are lacking. I remembered very well that I needed a dentist appointment badly as my filling fall off. Instead, I had to wait for one month to get it fixed. Sadly, the filling fall off again after 1 month. I had to get a better filling in Sibu.\n\nBesides, medical emergency. There are a lot of things that I cannot do in Kapit as there is not branch available such as some banks and tax branch.\n\nThe good news is that the internet connectivity in Kapit town is getting better after the pandemic. Before the pandemic, the internet access is not good. There is also random electricity and water cut.\n\nAll in all, the conditions are getting better after the road completion. I am expecting better public facilities in the future."
