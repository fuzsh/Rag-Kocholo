        "text": "Iban, which was formerly known as Sea Dayaks, with a total of 876,000 which is 40% of the population of Sarawak, are the largest ethnic group among all. The majority of the Iban population is located the Kota Samarahan, Sri Aman, Sarikei, Sibu, Kapit, Bintulu and Miri. Most of the Iban longhouses are usually located at the riverside and on the side of the road because its easy for them to facilitate the work activities, connect and communicate with each other. Their lifestyle practices are based on customary law, tolerance, and based on the close ties of kinship with each other. Majority of the Iban community today accept Christianity as their main religion, but at the same time they are still maintaining the customs and cultural characteristics that became a symbol of the Iban tradition for a long time.\n\nIban people usually sit in the valley of the Saribas River, Skrang River, Batang Lupar, and the Rajang River. Ibans have a lot of interesting cultural practice. They live in a community inside the longhouses, which is led by the village head called Tuai Rumah. Nowadays, most of the Iban community now settled in big cities around the State.\n\nTRADITION\n\nIban tradition is storing pots, gongs, and urns called tajau. It is inherited hereditary and honored. Tajau serves as a treasure and can be obtained by barter system. A handful of indigenous Iban communities still practice ancestral beliefs.\n\nTajau\n\nGawai festival is the main festival of the Iban tribe. There are many types of Gawai celebration such as Gawai Dayak, Gawai Burung, Gawai Batu, Gawai Kenyalang, Gawai Panggul, Gawai Kelingkang, Gawai Tuah, Gawai Lelabi and Gawai Antu. Among the Gawai Dayak, the one thatconducted between the first and the second in June is important. Typically, there is a dance known as Ngajat, which is danced as a Thanksgiving purposes for their paddy harvest. Tuai Rumah is the person responsible for managing this important celebration. Gawai festival also will not be complete, if Tuak is not served. Tuak is made from yeast and rice which can be found in the longhouse.\n\nOne of the activity for the Gawai celebration.\n\nWRITING SYSTEM\n\nThe Iban are called ” Master of Language ” by the world. Professor Derek Freeman is one among the researchers stated that the Iban are indeed the master of language . He also noted that the Iban people are skilled in using the language in every line , creating and building with beautiful poetry, great in choosing and arranging sentences. They have a lot of poetry that the word are arranged suitable to the harmonic surrounding. Iban people who have their own language which is Bahasa Iban. Iban language is different in each place, not only in Sarawak but also in Kalimantan , Sulawesi and the Malaysian Peninsular. Iban language is uniform ( homogenous ). The Dayak – Iban community is the only indigenous people in Malaysia with the writing system called ‘ Turai ‘ . It has no less than 59 letters that represent sounds like a reference to the Roman character . The script works with an impressive degree of accuracy and also can record important events. One of the important events in the history of the Iban is the ‘ Pirate of Shoals, Maro‘, where they broke the advance of colonial invasion [ Ngayau ] and bring home the decapitated heads of enemies.\n\nECONOMIC ACTIVITY\n\nMost of the Iban community still live in the longhouses where the localization pattern of the longhouse is scattered throughout the river valley in the state of Sarawak. They are still engaging in agricultural activities that cultivate paddy or upland rice .Iban people in the older days are leading pioneers in opening up the forest for paddy planting. Exploration activities are carried out in an affordable area, with the goal of getting the crop harvesting more rice for their food source. In the Iban community, one who can harvest a lot is considered a wealthy and respected , intelligent and hardworking person. Thus Iban was once considered as one of the famous society that cultivate hill paddy. The Iban community that live in longhouses still carried out the hunting activities and harvesting the forest resources for food and medical supplies . Nowadays, some of them began settling in large cities in Sarawak. Most of the new generation have the knowledge and educational qualifications, and work in the government and the private sectors.\n\nTypical look of traditional Rumah Panjang (Longhouse)\n\nMalay’s community constitute 21% of the total community population in Sarawak. Most of them are fishermen. At the present time, many Malays have moved to the cities in which they have been engaged in various professions either in the public or private sector.\n\nMost of the houses in the village of Sarawak Malay mostly made ​​of wood and located on the banks of the river, which are still far from the city or town. They still rely on traditional industries such as wood carving, silver and make a woven cloth of gold. The house of an urban Malay family is a gracious structure, well adapted to the tropical climate. Like all local houses, it is built of wood. The Brooke era introduced lofty ideas on columns, stucco, and indoor plumbing. From as early on as the 1860’s, a few leading Malay families commissioned professional builders, often Chinese, to construct their stately homes; a few which may still be seen today in Jalan Ajibah Abol in Kuching.\n\nTraditional Malay house\n\nSarawak Malay man and woman in their traditional clothing\n\nSarawak Malays are Muslims, where Islam was brought to Asia over 1000 years ago. Islam affect the life of the Sarawak Malay community, especially through the aspects of culture and the arts. For other aspects of construction, most of the houses or buildings have symbols or characteristics connotations. Their marriage custom is also based on the teachings of Islam, similarly to the Malays at the Peninsular.\n\nMan and Woman of Melanau\n\nLong ago, Melanau, same as the Iban Communities, also live in longhouses (but it was built taller). However, Melanau nowadays has changed their way of life. They live in a village and their house is the same as built by the Malays. Most of them are built along the river and near the beach. The Melanau are consists of Islam and Christians in religion, but there are also those who believe of a supernatural being called Ipok.\n\nThe Tallhouse\n\nMelanau ethnic group gathered at the coastal such as the north area of the Rajang River valley, Igan, Mukah, Dalat, Oya, and Bintulu. The earliest community settled in Mukah in Sarawak.\n\nECONOMIC\n\nTheir main economic activity is the capture of fish and rice farmers for a fraction of those who live in rural areas. In addition, the sago plantation is also organized by them. Sago palm grows in swampy areas and can be cut down only after ten years. Lemantak or a cornstarch are a substance derived from sago called ripo. Ripo dried up dried and processed before being made a lemantak, which is the cornstach. Sago manufacturing techniques are also infused in Melanau dance like Mengarang. Sarawak is the largest exporter of sago palm in Malaysia.\n\nDIVISION\n\nMelanau is divided by the place where they live. Even their language is different based where they came from. Melanau Mukah and Melanau Belawai have a diverse way of interacting, but not overall of their language is different than others. They are divided by :\n\nMelanau Mukah\n\nMelanau Dalat – Dalat Town Sharing Channel\n\nOya Melanau\n\nMelanau Igan\n\nMelanau Matu-Daro\n\nMelanau Belawai-Rajang\n\nBa’ie Melanau (Bintulu)\n\nMelanau Balingian, and\n\nMiri Melanau.\n\nCULTURE\n\nThe Kaul festival is warmly celebrated by the Melanau in March / April of each year in accordance with the Pengejin month of the Melanau calendar. The festival is held to entertain the Ipok, which is their believe of the spirit that control the sea. The aim is to obtain a satisfactory and safe catch at sea and prevention of various disease and illness . This festival signifies the end of the rainy season and the coming or the beginning of the fishing season . In this day, Serahang is prepared to be consumed by Ipok . Serahang is made ​​of bamboo and palm leaves, which inside of the leaves contains chicken eggs, yellow glutinous rice , long strip or leaf tobacco. Even its sounds weird, this celebration comes with excitement and joy.\n\nThe atmosphere of Pesta Kaul\n\nApart from Kaul festival that is celebrated every year, there are still strong culture practices by the Melanau, especially those involving the death of a family member. However, these practices vary by county and village. For the Melanau who live in the Matu district, practices related to death are greatly influenced by religion. After the funeral , family members will be willing to hold the ceremony called ” Sare “. which is like an open house for 7 nights in a row. The family home of the deceased will be visited by relatives and the local community. Nowadays, it was already influenced by Islam practices in the religious prayers, recital, and feast or ‘Kenduri’. It is a common phenomenon for a Melanau that the parents are still practising traditional religion of his parents, and the children professing the religion of Islam and/or Christianity.\n\nMan and Woman of Bidayuh\n\nBidayuh is the collective term for a Land Dayak tribe in Sarawak. During the colonial period, this group better known as Land Dayak or ‘Dayak Darat’. The term is used to distinguish them from those Iban tribes who was known as ‘Dayak Laut’ or Sea Dayak. The term is given because of the Bidayuh residential location which is predominantly located in the inland, river and plateau.\n\nNowadays, the Bidayuh can be found in the southwestern part of Sarawak, especially the part Serian, Kuching and West Kalimantan.\n\nThey are mostly Christian. Only a few who converted to Islam and animism. They consist of four ethnic breakdown as follows:\n\nSelakau / Lara (Lundu District)\n\nJagoi / Singai (Bau District)\n\nBiatah (sub-district Padawan)\n\nBukar / Sadong (Serian District)\n\nTypical Bidayuh’s Longhouse\n\nIn ancient times the Bidayuh tribes lived in longhouses which is typically located far inland and hill area. The reason they build their house in this place is because to hid them from the enemy attacks and also for safety reason. The structure of the Bidayuh longhouse are not far different from the structure of the Iban longhouse in Sarawak.\n\nBidayuh language is quite unique compared to other languages from the other tribes. This uniqueness is based on pronunciation, speech, gestures and intonations of their spoken style. Typically Bidayuh language will change the intonation and language in certain villages and districts. This causes the tribe’s difficult to communicate with each other if they are of the different tribe.\n\nTraditional music instrument of Orang Bidayuh\n\nUtensils uses by the Bidayuhs\n\nFor the Bidayuh community, music plays an important role in all religious ceremonies performed by them. This music served to uplift and drive out evil spirits. Music also plays a role in the notification of a ritual carried out the motive. Bidayuh traditional music generally consists of a large gong that consists of two Oguong and Kitaak, cymbal, drum or Pedabat and Tawak (a small gong). There are also other traditional instruments such as flute / bamboo flute and guitar. Yet such instruments much less playable because the manufacturing process is quite complicated.\n\nThe Orang Ulu are made up of a few tribes namely the Kenyah, Kayan, Kelabit, the Lun Bawang, Penan as well as a few minor tribes in the interior. Orang Ulu, means the “up-river dwellers” mainly living in Central Borneo, which accounts for 5.5% of the population. The Penan, Kayan and Kenyah, live in the middle and upper reaches of and the Kelabit and Lun Bawang live in the highlands.\n\nThe Kayans live in the main territories in central Borneo. They are warlike, conservative and religious people. The Kayan are considered more skilled in handicraft then all other peoples and believed by early anthropologists to be the original people in Sarawak who adorned their bodies with tattoos.\n\nThe Kenyahs are found mainly in the highlands a little north of the centre of Borneo. As recorded in The Pagan Tribes of Borneo, physically they are without question the finest people of the country. Their skin-colour is decidedly fairer than that of Sea Dayaks or Kayans. They are of medium stature, with long backs and short, muscular, well-rounded limbs; a little stumpy in build, but of graceful and vigorous bearing. They are perhaps the most courageous and intelligent of the peoples; hospitable and somewhat improvident, sociable and of pleasant manners.\n\nThe Lun Bawang tribe are the people that come and reside in the rural eastern Borneo highlands of Kalimantan, Brunei, Sabah and Sarawak . The early history of the Lun Bawang tribes are the people of Kerayan-Kelabit tribe that built a settlement at highlands of the Borneo north central region. They had migrated to Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei around the 17th century and the 18th, but most of them are still live in Kalimantan. Lun Bawang from Sabah is known as Lun Dayeh which means Orang Ulu or Orang Pedalaman. While in Sarawak and Brunei,the Lun Bawang has its own meaning, which is local people or Orang Pribumi. The Lun Bawang tribe which was formerly known as the Murut also can be found along the shores of the Lawas and Limbang Trusan river.\n\nThe arrival of the Chinese community in Sarawak begins in the second quarter of the 19th century, after the the rule of Rajah James Brooke in 1841. Rajah James Brooke of Sarawak has sought to maintain peace by fighting the pirates and rebellion around the coast of Sarawak. Its success has led to the development of business activities in English and Chinese merchants at Singapore and Sarawak. The peace that exists in Sarawak has attracted the Chinese to come to Sarawak. In the early stages, the Chinese who immigrated to Sarawak was not originate from mainland China but made ​​up from the miner of Chinese Hakka ehtnic, who came from the Sambas, Pontianak. They were mining for gold in the area since the 1760’s.\n\nWhen the Dutch extend their power to through Pontianak in the 1820s, the Chinese community in Pontianak has been oppressed by their way of rule . When a pile of gold in Pontianak has been eased, many of them moved to Bau, Sarawak in 1841. Upon the opening of Kuching City in 1836 by the Crown Prince, many Chinese Hokkien traders began to settle at there, along with the Malay and Bidayuh. The Chinese, which is formally known as the precursor of the worldwide trade, of course will assume economic resources in Sarawak are sensible to be explored together. In addition to the gold mining in Bau and Marup, clove and pepper crops for export purposes also become an attraction to those coming to the state. As of 1857 it is estimated that there are about 4,000 Chinese communities in the western part of Sarawak State. A widen industrial pepper plantation are only started in 1876 when Raja Brooke offered free shipping to pepper growers from Singapore and allocate the land for pepper plantations purposes to Chinese merchants . Other than the Chinese Hakka descent, the Chinese Foochow descent community also moved to Sarawak to plant peppers in Sibu, Sarikei – Binatang ( now Bintangor ) and Serian in 1900. The rubber was first introduced in Sarawak in 1881 and became an important export material in 1906 when the price of rubber was booming high.\n\nRajah James Brooke had taken a good approach to ensure the rubber became a major commodity for the state of Sarawak at that time. Rubber was developed by encouraging small farmers and indigenous Chinese Foochow planting this crop. This is the start of a large scale of rubber cultivation. Chinese community population has increase after since. The statistics on the increased number of Chinese immigrants in Sarawak can be seen clearly that in 1908 there were an estimated 45,000 of them settled in the State of Sarawak. The rapid increase occurred between 1939 and 1960. Therefore it is clear that the driving factor behind the increase of Chinese population is caused by economic factors. Even the Brooke family policy that provides various facilities such as land ownership, financial aid, and the cruise fare has accelerated their arrival. The second Rajah also personally encouraging the Chinese Foochow descent to settled in Sarawak.\n\nNowadays, the Chinese in Sarawak became a major power in business related works in major cities such as Kuching, Sibu and Miri. Thanks to their involvement, Sarawak has become one of the major business powers in Malaysia."
