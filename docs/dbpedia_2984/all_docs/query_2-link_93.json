        "text": "When humans disturb the natural, protective vegetative cover of the landscape with settlements, roads, farms, etc., the types and amounts of materials dissolved or carried into the lakes by runoff change significantly (WATERENCYCLOPEDIA 2011). Nonpoint-source pollution is another term for polluted runoff (see also water pollution). Run-off is the water washing over the land, whether from precipitation, car washing or watering crops or lawns, etc., picks up an array of contaminants including oil, sand and salt from roadways, agricultural chemicals, and nutrients and toxic materials from both urban and rural areas. The term nonpoint is used to distinguish this type of pollution from point source pollution, which comes from specific sources such as sewage treatment plants or industrial facilities. The major types of pollutants are listed below (adapted from COASTAL CENTRE 2012):\n\nNutrients are compounds that stimulate plant growth, like nitrogen and phosphorous. In high concentrations, they can become both an environmental and health threat. Nutrients in polluted waters can come from agricultural fertilisers, septic systems, home lawn care products, and yard and animal wastes.\n\nPathogens are disease-causing microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses that come from the faecal waste of animals and humans. Pathogens wash off the land from wild animal, farm animal and pet waste, and can also enter the lake from improperly functioning septic systems, leaky sewer lines and boat sanitary disposal systems.\n\nToxins are substances that can harm aquatic and human life. They are created by a wide variety of human practices and products like heavy metals, pesticides and organic compounds like PCBâ€™s. Many toxins are resistant to breakdown and tend to be passed through the food chain to be concentrated in top predators. Oil, grease and gasoline from roadways, and chemicals used in home, gardens, yards and on farm crops, are major sources of toxic contaminants.\n\nEutrophication\n\nExcessive fertilisation (eutrophication) of lakes and reservoirs is recognised as one of the most important causes of water quality impairment of lakes, reservoirs, some streams, rivers, and near-shore marine waters (JONES LEE and LEE n.y.); see also water pollution. Eutrophication of lakes is best defined as the excessive addition of inorganic nutrients, organic matter, and silt that causes a corresponding increase in biological productivity. High concentrations of nutrients alone do not make a lake eutrophic; there must be a biological response as well. Nutrient concentrations, however, may be used as indicators for the potential of eutrophication. For example, phosphorus concentrations exceeding 30 micrograms per litre are sufficient to cause excessive algal growth in some lakes, and therefore eutrophication (WATERENCYCLOPEDIA 2011). Possible solutions to avoid eutrophication are wastewater treatment at the source, retention ponds to stop nutrients before entering the surface water source or buffer zones between agricultural land and open water sources. In the United States for instance, industrial agriculture is one of the leading causes of water pollution. Read more about it in the article by SUSTAINABLE TABLE (n.y.)\n\nHow to Avoid Pollution"
