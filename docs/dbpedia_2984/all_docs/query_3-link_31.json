        "text": "Everyone’s got their favourite lake in the Berlin summertime, from family-friendly Krumme Lanke to popular FKK (Frei Körper Kultur, or nude bathing) spot Teufelsee (where a piece of internet history was made back in 2020).\n\nSign up for our\n\nNewsletter\n\nBerlin events, freebies, food & news\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human:\n\n🌳 Through the trees: The best forest walks in and around Berlin\n\n🛥 BVG ferries: Berlin public transport by water\n\n🌊 Berlin by the water: The prettiest waterside spots\n\nWhat are you in the mood for? We’ve got great spots, whether you want to chill out in the calm of nature or are looking for more of a party vibe. Here are our recommendations for swimming lakes – and most can be visited with no entrance fee.\n\nKrumme Lanke in Zehlendorf\n\nKrumme Lanke is a very popular spot in the summertime. There are a lot of nice places to take a dip and not too much of that slimy vegetation that gets wrapped around your legs.\n\nKrumme Lanke has plenty of quiet corners, but if you prefer a more lively atmosphere, move to the southern end of Fischerhüttenstraße and join the masses on the sunbathing lawn. To the north, the lake is shallow, which is pleasant for not-so-strong swimmers and kids. Our tip: The path around the lake is 2.8 kilometers long and makes for a wonderfully relaxing walk.\n\nGetting there: Take the U3 or the 622 bus to U-Bahn Krumme Lanke, then it’s a 20-minute walk.\n\nGroß Glienicker See in Kladow\n\nGroß Glienicker See is half in Berlin, half in Brandenburg. During the Cold War it made up part of the border, and DDR citizens were not allowed to enter the water on the East German side.\n\nGlienicker lies on a chain of lakes, along with Sacrower See and Heiligen See, where the water quality is excellent. You’ve got two official bathing spots to choose from. The one at the south end of the lake has a sunbathing lawn and a seasonally-staffed DLRG (lifesaver) station, and the one at the north east end has a nice open beach. With volleyball courts, playgrounds and boat rental – this lake has something for everyone.\n\nIf you are willing to go looking for them – there are many small areas that are less crowded, where you can sunbathe and enjoy the quiet.\n\nGetting there: Take the N/X 34 bus to Gutsstr., the 135 line to Kurpromenade, or the 604 and the 638 to Potsdam, Am Park.\n\nJungfernsee in Wannsee\n\nWonderfully idyllic, Jungfernsee is worth a visit, even if you’re not in the mood for swimming. You can enjoy the water at two different bathing spots here. The first is not too far from the Glienicke Bridge, and the second near Cecilenhof Palace, which has sunbathing lawns. The north of the lake side is a little less accommodating for swimmers – a nature reserve keeps you from getting to the water.\n\nGetting there: Take the S-Bahn to Wannsee and then continue by bike, or take the bus to Glienicker Brücke.\n\nMüggelsee in Treptow-Köpenick\n\nA classic (not to mention, the biggest) of Berlin’s lakes, with plenty of opportunities to sun yourself, have a dip in the water or play sport. If you like a bit of luxury, you can escape to Strandbad Friedrichshagen for a fee. Alternatively, the beach near the Müggelsee lido is available, where there is a popular nudist area, if you’re so inclined. It’s worth checking up on the water quality before you go, because late in the summer there is the risk of algal blooms in the shallow warm water.\n\nGetting there: Take the 60/N61 bus to Bruno-Wille-Str. or Josef-Nawrocki-Str.\n\nNieder Neuendorfer See, Henningsdorf\n\nThe Nieder Neuendorfer See is part of a chain of lakes reaching all the way from central Havel to Berlin. And for those who want all the trimmings, Heiligensee with its lido is located right next to Nieder Neuendorfer See. A 20-kilometer cycle around the circumference of the lake is the perfect warm-up for a swim, and bike rentals are available.\n\nGetting there: Take the 124 bus to Schönbäumer Weg or Mattenbuder Pfad, or the 133, N22 or 124 to Heiligenseestr./Hennigsdorfer Str.\n\nFlughafensee in Reinickendorf\n\nFlughafensee used to have a bad reputation when tests showing bacterial contamination meant it wasn’t safe to swim there. But since 2019, the water has been declared squeaky clean and as safe as can be.\n\nThe best way to access the lake, which is a popular FKK spot, is on the eastern side. You can also walk or drive (parking spaces are available) along the JVA Tegel and then walk for roughly 500 meters through the forest. To the north and west, the shore is densely forested; there is even a bird sanctuary, which doesn’t make for the best swimming spot.\n\nGetting there: Take the U6 to Holzhauser Str. or the X33 bus to Sterkrader Str.\n\nOrankesee in Alt-Hohenschönhausen\n\nLike Obersee, Orankesee is located in the centre of the Hohenschönhauser villa district. Even though it’s one of Berlin’s lesser-known lakes, it has a beautiful lido right on the shore. This is the only swimming option, but if you pay the entry fee, you get to slide down the 52-meter-long water slide. The rest of the lake belongs to anglers. There is a lot to catch here, as the lake is populated with eels, pike, carp and perch as well as many other fish species.\n\nGetting there: Take the M13, M17 or the 27 tram and get off at the Stadion Buschallee/Suermondtstr. stop. By car, it is best to park in the Strandbad car park.\n\nPlötzensee in Reinickendorf\n\nPlötzensee stretches over about 7.8 hectares and is located near Volkspark Rehberge. The name of the lake comes from the carp fish Plötze, which could be found here in large schools at one time. For a fee, you can visit the shores of the Strandbad, which offers a sandy beach, children’s playground, as well as areas for volleyball, table tennis and soccer. For the nudists amongst you, you’re free to let it all hang out in the designated area. There’s also a fantastic hippy sauna zone just next to the beach, which is perfect in winter when you can use the lake as the cold plunge pool. Directly across the lake is a forested area where you can access the water without a ticket via the swimming pavilion.\n\nGetting there: Take the 106 bus to Sylter Str.\n\nSchlachtensee on the edge of Grunewald\n\nSchlachtensee is a true paradise – on hot days, it gets pretty packed. In the summer of 2020 CNN named it as one of the most beautiful swimming spots not only in Berlin, but worldwide.\n\nBut we don’t need an award to know how lucky we are. Joggers and strollers populate the circular path (seven kilometers) through the forest (and the adjacent Paul-Ernst-Park). It’s also the perfect spot for renting a boat, or Stand-Up-Paddle-boarding.\n\nGetting there: Take the S-Bahn 1 to Schlachtensee.\n\nSeddinsee on the banks of Schmöckwitz\n\nSeddinsee is part of an enormous nature reserve – but that doesn’t mean you can’t swim in it. The protective measures concern themselves more with the shore, so the full 270 hectares is open for water sports of any kind. Seddinsee connects the Spree and the Dahme rivers and even has a few islands, which (if you’ve got the stamina) you can swim to from the shore. You’ll need a bike to access the swim spots as they’re quite a hike from the S-Bahn, but that means you’ll be rewarded with an extremely tranquil spot.\n\nGetting there: Take the S-Bahn 3 to Erkner or the S9 to Altglienicke, then we recommend taking a scenic cycle the rest of the way (for 9.6km and 12.9km respectively).\n\nTegeler See in Reinickendorf\n\nThere are several bathing spots at the Tegeler See – however, there are also problems with algae. The situation can be unpredictable, so it’s worth Googling beforehand. After Müggelsee, Tegeler See is Berlin’s largest lake, with nine islands used for water sports and boating.\n\nThe boardwalk is also ideal for strolling, and steamboat rides can be taken from there. There are a total of four official bathing spots, Saatwinkel, Reiswerder Strand, Reiherwerder and the Strandbad Tegel, which we visited for its reopening.\n\nGetting there: Take the U6 to Kurt-Schumacher-Platz at the end of the line, the substitute U6 bus to U-Alt Tegel, then the 222 bus to Jörsstr., followed by a 10 minute walk.\n\nTeufelssee in Grunewald\n\nAlthough Teufelssee is surrounded by a nature reserve, you’re still allowed to swim, with access to the water on the southern shore. Sunbathing is extremely popular along this 254 meter long, 107 meter wide lake. In 2020, it made viral history when a family of wild boar harassed visitors and even stole someone’s laptop bag.\n\nGetting there: Take the S7 to Grunewald, then take a 10 minute scenic cycle.\n\nZeuthener See in Schmöckwitz\n\nLike many of the best lakes in Berlin, Lake Zeuthen is located in the southeast and borders on Brandenburg. If you want to get technical, Zeuthener See is a widening of the Dahme and thus strictly speaking not a lake.\n\nThe western shore is heavily built-up, while the eastern shore is more forested. At the bathing area on the northern side, which is accessible from Wernsdorfer Straße, visitors lie on the sand of the beach or happily wander around. The lido Eichwald on the Brandenburg side is also a must-visit."
