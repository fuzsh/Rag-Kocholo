        "text": "While a singular, first encounter may set the tone for an experience, it’s a series of encounters that ultimately composes a symphony of revelation.\n\nThe positive feedback loop of learning continues as previously tangential issues of interest become central focuses; today, we reference yesterday’s inspiring tour guide and election talk, only to move into a greener space. (click for yesterday’s post!)\n\nThis afternoon, I visited Tegeler See (Lake Tegel) for one last bout of summer fun before the official start of the week and this fall semester. We took a woodsy walk around the lake to our beachy destination, where half of us plunked down in enjoyment and the other half plunged into the (eerie) waters. I, one of the thrill-seeking souls, was driven by a sense of urgency to reach the rope swing I’d spotted across the lake. Within minutes, a group of us had reached the other side and were clawing our way up this rather imposing tree.\n\nMy carefree afternoon of swinging from the tree, the pure childish fun, couldn’t be categorized as anything but exceptionally satisfying. And yet this lake visit, a quintessentially German leisure activity, speaks volumes about the culture and its appreciation of the outdoors. Germany not only has respect for the human needs of rest and relaxation, but also has a great reverence for its widely spread greenery. And with said greenery as such a fundamental part of German living, it’s also therefore an essential piece of their political puzzle.\n\nReflecting upon this lake visit took me back to a comment yesterday’s tour guide had made about the importance of Germany’s recent governmental decision to phase out nuclear energy in this upcoming election. They’ve decided to take a breath of fresh air and breathe a sigh of nuclear relief, having committed to really implement renewable energy-run systems and forward their already-prospering economic situation. It’s a decision that supposedly will not only heighten their position as leaders of energy-efficient technological innovation, but will set an example for other governmental shifts worldwide. Shifts that should theoretically create more opportunities for employment and focus on intellectual (social and scientific) progress.\n\nBecause of the genuine German enjoyment of clean, energy-saving living, I wouldn’t be surprised if entrepreneurship and invention skyrocket in the next ten years (and beyond) here. Of course, responsible energy use is not an interest unique to Germany, but the government certainly knows its people, their priorities and how to cater to their mindsets. They’re catering to their ‘market,’ and, assuming the German people respond eagerly to green policies set forth, the society should really thrive in this group effort to further empower its country. It’s like giving your employee an assignment she’s excited to complete; she’s bound to enjoy the work and to do a better job.\n\nLet’s see how this strategy works on a slightly larger scale.\n\nEncounter. Engage. Experience.\n\nIf you feel like more, more-informed reading:\n\n“How Germany plans to succeed in a nuclear free, low-carbon economy” – The Guardian"
