        "text": "Social distancing will be difficult once the swimming pools reopen. Itâs hard enough already without someone breathing down your neck as soon as you leave your door, or snuggling up close behind you in the supermarket. Berliners had no issue whatsoever with Abstand before, but suddenly now they canât get near enough to strangers.\n\nYou can imagine what the pools will be like â festering cesspits of contact-starved individuals delighted to be in close proximity to others to cough, splutter, spit, sneeze and sweat upon.\n\nThe only hope to avoid virus-infested waters is to head to one of the cityâs abandoned swimming facilities. Thankfully there are many, though Freibad Lichtenberg has been destroyed, the Wernerbad has regressed into a lake, Blubâs a sorry mess, and there ainât any water at Pankow Schwimmhalle.\n\nStrandbad Tegelâs abandoned status looks secure. Campaigners are trying so hard to reopen it, that you can be sure that it wonât be opening anytime soon.\n\nOnly the ducks and swans use it now, the former quackling merrily as they amble under the branches of the trees overhanging the sandy waterfront. The playground is still and silent, the restaurant closed and empty. Locker doors hang open expectantly, but no one trusts them with their valuables anymore. Trees are sprouting up to reclaim the land for the surrounding forest.\n\nWhile others are fighting to get it going again, Strandbad Tegel itself seems to have given up. The rundown 40,000-square meter facility is wallowing in neglect and despair.\n\nStrandbad Tegel first opened in 1933 when a sandy part of the Tegeler See was cordoned off and swimmersâ facilities were built. It was a momentous year, but we wonât get into all that now.\n\nThe Strandbad sits on a 500-meter stretch of beach and had a separate FKK section where Berliners and die-hard East Germans could strip off completely without fear of being arrested. FKK stood for FreikÃ¶rperkultur (free body culture, or nudism) and was particularly popular in the DDR though it was âingrained as having mayonnaise with your chipsâ on both sides of the Berlin Wall divide.\n\nThe Nacktbaden (naked swimming) website says it was a âlovelyâ FKK beach but âunfortunately there is only one access point to the lake from the FKK section. The rest of the bank is covered with thick reeds and bushes.â Presumably to spare the poor ducks and swans from the show of wobbly bits.\n\nThe FFK section was closed down in 2014. The rest of Strandbad Tegel has been closed since the end of the bathing season in 2016. Even then it was already skating on thin ice with the Berliner BÃ¤der Betriebe seemingly determined to close it down. The BBB is Berlinâs municipal pools authority, the largest in Europe. Berliners love their pools.\n\nThe Strandbadâs problems began years before, when the BBB rented it out to investor Dirk Michehl in 2009 but didnât receive any money in return. Michehl contended that the BBB didnât keep its side of the bargain. The water was cut off in February 2010 so he had to close the restaurant. He sued for â¬500,000 in damages.\n\nâOur hands are tied,â BBB spokesperson Matthias Oloew said as legal proceedings were underway.\n\nMichehl even offered to buy the Strandbad from the BBB â for â¬1.\n\nâApparently no one wants the Bad. Nothing has happened for many weeks. No one has shown any interest in preserving this historical swimming area. Iâd save it and reopen it for the people,â Michehl said in May 2010. But the Strandbad remained closed that year.\n\nThe arguments continued even as the Strandbad reopened on an âemergency basisâ in the following years, until the BBB shut it down in 2016 for what it said were necessary repairs. The sewage pipe was sealed with cement.\n\nDie Tagesspiegel reported that the cost of fixing the sewage pipe was â¬450,000 and â¬1.4 million was needed to renovate the buildings. But the BBB didnât have this kind of money and wanted to privatize the Strandbad. So it did nothing.\n\nThe paper noted that the sewage pipe for the neighboring Scharfenberg Island was recently upgraded. They could have done a combined job. But there was no interest in doing so.\n\nThe BBB blamed low visitor numbers. Locals in turn complained about the reduced opening hours, the bus service being scrapped, and the Ordnungsamt rigorously checking cars for parking tickets. If thereâs one thing going to spoil anyoneâs fun, itâs the fucking Ordnungsamt.\n\nTagesspiegel also suggested that the BBB was giving false visitor numbers to suggest fewer bathers than were actually using the facility. Local Reinickendorf politician Tim-Christopher Zeelen came up with other, better, figures.\n\nZeelen, the local mayor, Felix SchÃ¶nbeck and others formed a committee to fight for Strandbad Tegelâs future, for it to be restored to its former glory. They laid the blame squarely on the BBB for killing their beloved Strandbad.\n\nâFrom the BÃ¤der-Betriebeâs point of view, thereâs no future perspective for our Strandbad!â they wrote in a petition to reopen it in 2016.\n\nTheyâre still waiting to get their way. The BBB clearly doesnât give a damn about Strandbad Tegel, which has since been deleted from their website.\n\nIt wasnât until 2018 that BBB got the state-run property management company Berliner Immobilienmanagement GmbH (BIM) involved to look at finding an investor, and even then it was September 2019 before they came up with a concept.\n\nZeelen and SchÃ¶nbeck say they have an investor ready to come in and take Strandbad Tegel off the BBBâs hands. The only thing missing so far is a signature. But then the coronavirus put everything in further turmoil. Youâd be mad to sign your name to anything now.\n\nSchÃ¶nbeck has a simple solution.\n\nâOpen the doors, set up portable toilets, bring in lifeguards, done!â he said.\n\nThis is Berlin, where simple is anything but."
