        "text": "This week I’ve headed to the Tegeler See, a lake in the north-west of Berlin. The boulevard with restaurants direct me to a boardwalk with ferries. Inlands of the Große Malche, a bay in this one lake, a peculiar oak looses its leaves because of the autumn season. That means, the leaves it still has. After a couple of centuries, the Dicke Marie (Fat Mary) has remarkably less bush to show off than the younger vegetation that surrounds her.\n\nIf you’d like to believe so, the oak’s history starts in the spring of 1107. That’s when an acorn came ashore in the bay of the Große Malche. It listened to growling bears and the songs of minstrels during the middle ages. In the middle of the 16th century, it was the first tree outside the domain of the Schloss Tegel (Tegel Palace). As a result, his fellow trees were cut and turned into a garden. By the end of the 18th century, the nearby town of Tegel already talked about the old oak. In 1778, Johann von Goethe -world’s most famous German that lived at the time- honoured the oak with his visit. A few years later, Alexander and Wilhelm (the boys from the Von Humboldt’s who lived in Schloss Tegel at the time) honoured the oak after their cook. The tree was given the nickname: Dicke Marie. In the meanwhile, sand slipped slowly on the banks. So, the oak stands about 30 meters inland now. The tree is listed as a natural monument.\n\nThis is a version of the story. But what is true of it? Let’s first try and find out how old Marie actually is. The answers though, have been more confusing as clarifying.\n\nThe age of Dicke Marie has been guessed more than once by editors of various newspapers. A journalist in 1956 overestimated Marie’s age – and wanted to celebrate her 1000th birthday. This gives me a bit of the creeps. I can’t ignore my impression that such an estimation came from nostalgia, projecting the idea of a Tausendjähriges Reich on this single oak. Oaks were popular among Germans in the first half of the 20th century. Especially the nazi-regime turned it a little too much a national symbol out of it. Their admiration for the oak and its long-life also already led to a monumental status for Dicke Marie in 1939.\n\nIn 1986 however, an article in the Berliner Morgenpost estimated Marie’s age to be 700 – while their competing editors from the Berliner Zeitung thought she was another age older. My gut feeling says: Berliner Zeitung tends to exegerrate a whole lot more than the Morgenpost. A more recent article in the B.Z. about the Dicke Marie, states that the tree can celebrate its 900th birthday – an estimation that seems to be generally accepted by now. But the truth is: no one really knows.\n\nIt’s even debated whether the nickname for this oak truely is given by the Von Humboldt’s. An article about the tree (dating to 1996) says: there is no written proof of this “in despite of extensive research.” It’s just that in the late 1980s the local authorities for environmental protection looked for a fitting name. There surely were nicknames such as ‘Mutter Dossen‘ and ‘Dicke Marie‘. But with only oral (and no written) suggestions that this nickname is given by 2 whizzkids more than 200 years prior? It makes that the nickname ‘Dicke Marie’ is mostly a publicity stunt.\n\nConclusion? Little is really known about the oak. I’ve noticed that people like to celebrate whatever birthday they project on it. I guess that the only way to find out the oak’s real age will be by cutting it and counting the annual rings – a rather fatal solution to solve this issue. And still, journalists rewrite the falsified history of this tree. Though, there is one relief for Marie. In her life-time, no one will be able to see her age by her appearance!"
