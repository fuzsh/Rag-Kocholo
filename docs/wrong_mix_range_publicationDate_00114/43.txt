On writing fantasy:

'A fantasy novel should be like an iceberg. The story is the visible ten percent but the reader should feel like there is another ninety per cent under the surface that they can't see: it's not in the story but they know it's there. They should feel that the novel is built upon its own unique history, myths and legends, depths that are hinted at and suggested by the author, never to be fully explored or explained.'

On creating characters:

'I always find my characters through story. I have a vague idea what they might be like when I start writing, but generally they develop as the story develops. They become what they need to be for the story. Of course they then influence where I take the storyâ€¦'

Favourite place

'The NSW south coast around Bawley Point has always been important and inspirational to me. I read many books for the first time at the coast, and have written at least part of every one of my books there.'
