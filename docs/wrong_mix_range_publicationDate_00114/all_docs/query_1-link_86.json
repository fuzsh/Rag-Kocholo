        "text": "Virginia Woolf Punks the Royal Navy (1910)\n\nIt was a cool February day when Virginia Stephens, then eighteen and two years before becoming Mrs. Leonard Woolf, dressed up for a special outing: caftan, turban, false beard, and a healthy dollop of black face. At the top of her to-do list that day: portray a royal Abyssinian and prank the flagship of the Royal Navy, the HMS Dreadnought.\n\nInveterate prankster Horace Cole had organized the stunt. He recruited a few friends, including future Bloomsbury painter Duncan Grant and Virginia’s brother, Adrian, but when several people dropped out, Adrian talked Virginia into portraying the emperor’s crown prince. With the help of theatrical costumes and beards, there would be four “Abyssinians” in all, plus Adrian playing an interpreter and Cole an official from the Foreign Office.\n\nThey sent a telegram to the ship, signed with the name of the Admiralty official, and convinced the railroad to provide a special coach for the trip to Weymouth. At the port, they were met by a ship’s officer who escorted them by boat to the Dreadnought. As they neared the ship, the sailors stood at attention along the side of the ship and the band performed the national anthem…of Zanzibar. Lacking an Abyssinian flag and music, the British Navy made do.\n\nFor forty minutes, the party of six were given a grand tour of the battleship. They talked among themselves in a mix of Swahili and Latin tags from Virgil and Horace, and at every new British marvel, cried out “Bunga bunga!” Everyone agreed that it was a successful diplomatic mission.\n\nThe news of the hoax hit the newspapers and torpedoed the Navy’s pride. A high navy official had to explain to Parliament how it happened. Children not only taunted sailors in the streets with cries of “bunga bunga” but also the real, and no doubt puzzled, emperor of Abyssinia when he visited England weeks later. Reporters sought out Virginia for an interview and described her as “very good looking with classical features”.\n\nEventually, the uproar died down, and apologies were accepted all around. The navy’s honor was restored when Cole and Grant were “punished” with ceremonial canings on their buttocks. Virginia was not only enormously amused at successfully passing as a man but learned something about masculine pride and honor that she would use in her fiction.\n\n-from Writers Gone Wild: The Feuds, Frolics, and Follies of Literature’s Great Adventurers, Drunkards, Lovers, Iconoclasts, and Misanthropes (Bill Peschel)"
