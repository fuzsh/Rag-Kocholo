        "text": "★★★★★\n\nIt is difficult to put into words how much I loved this book when I discovered it in my school library all those years ago. To my 13-year-old self, Sabriel was the peak of literature. At the time, I knew only that it was one of the most amazing books I had ever read. Now, as I look back, I know its impact on me was far greater than I realised. This was one of the stories that made me want to write stories of my own.\n\nBeloved childhood favourites can offer a bittersweet reading experience when revisited as an adult. Due to the risk of painful disenchantment, I rarely look back. On occasion, however, old friends offer a charming afterglow that no novelty or new release can beat. For me, Sabriel is one example.\n\nOur title character is 18 years old, and soon to graduate from the prestigious girls’ boarding school, Waverly College, in Ancelstierre. Sabriel’s loving but somewhat distant father is the Abhorsen, a necromancer whose unique duties keep him busy in the Old Kingdom across the border, where he works to send the restless and reawoken dead to their final resting place beyond the Nine Gates of Death. As his only child, it is implied that Sabriel is destined to inherit the weighty mantle of the role. The time to step up comes far sooner than expected, however, when our heroine receives an ambiguous message from her father, implying that he is trapped within Death, and needs her help. Accompanied by a talking cat, Mogget – one of the most iconic animal sidekicks ever written – Sabriel soon realises she must use her gifts and years of training to save not only her father, but the living, the dead, and herself.\n\n“I have a variety of names,” replied the cat. It had a strange voice, half-mew, half-purr, with hissing on the vowels. “You may call me Mogget. As to what I am, I was once many things, but now I am only several. Primarily, I am a servant of Abhorsen. Unless you would be kind enough to remove my collar?”\n\nSabriel was published in 1995, and has done an amazing job of standing the test of time. In fact, there is so little about this book which dates it that I had to check the publication year listed on Wikipedia against the opening flyleaf before I was prepared to believe it. I think the most lovely thing about Sabriel as a character is her down-to-earth normality. I find a lot to dislike about YA, but one of my biggest peeves about the genre is the way it so often pigeonholes young female characters into cliques and clichés that define their personality. A normal young woman with no gender-based hang-ups makes for a refreshing departure.\n\nThe worldbuilding of The Old Kingdom series is incredible, and the necromancy lore benefits from not being overexplained. Clever concepts are easy to overdo, but Garth Nix leaves plenty of space for the reader’s imagination, whilst still managing to avoid any sense that the setting is unrealised. This is a deep, immersive world, and the first book of the saga invites the reader not to observe Sabriel’s adventure as a distant outsider, but to walk the road with her.\n\nGiven how long ago it was that I first read this series, I returned to it with the full expectation that I would emerge disillusioned this time around. You can imagine my delight when I discovered that rereading Sabriel as an adult only allowed me to better appreciate Nix’s smooth, considered writing. I would live in books like this, if it was possible.\n\n“I have walked in Death to the very precipice of the Ninth Gate,” Abhorsen said quietly. “I know the secrets and horrors of the Nine Precincts. I do not know what lies beyond, but everything that lives must go there, in the proper time. That is the rule that governs our work as the Abhorsen, but it also governs us… I have not taught you as well as I should – let this be my final lesson. Everyone and everything has a time to die.”\n\nThough I am not the adolescent I was when I first read the book, Sabriel remains one of my all-time favourite literary personalities. There is a grounded truth to her character that rings with authenticity. I also really like that she is so inherently female, without this being sexualised or over-romanticised. With her woollen knickerbockers and quiet determination, Sabriel does not read like the type of character whose personality has been constructed to meet a set of ideals. She is a warrior, but she is also girlish, gentle and dignified. Simply put, she has a human complexity that feels entirely real.\n\nOverall, I think Sabriel is a modern classic. The book has a timelessness that will see me passing my copy down to any children I have when they become teenagers. It also embodies a specific subgenre that ranks high among my favourites: young women having scary adventures in dark fantasy settings, without romance as a defining feature. When it is done even better than Mark Lawrence’s Book of the Ancestor series, there is really just one question: why did I wait so long to reread it?\n\nI shall end this review here, because I need to go find my copy of Lirael and clear my schedule. If you need me, wait until next week. Until then, I will be busy devouring the rest of this series."
