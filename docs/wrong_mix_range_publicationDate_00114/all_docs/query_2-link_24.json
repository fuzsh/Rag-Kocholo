        "text": "Garth Richard Nix is an Australian writer who specialises in children's and young adult fantasy novels, notably the Old Kingdom, Seventh Tower and Keys to the Kingdom series. He has frequently been asked if his name is a pseudonym, to which he has responded, \"I guess people ask me because it sounds like the perfect name for a writer of fantasy. However, it is my real name.\""
