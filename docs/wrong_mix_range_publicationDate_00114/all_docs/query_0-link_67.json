        "text": "A Dirty Dozen with CATERINA NIX of CHAOS MAGIC – May 2019\n\nAccording to a recent press release: “Frontiers Music Srl is delighted to present the fabulous new album from CHAOS MAGIC, entitled Furyborn, on June 14! CHAOS MAGIC is centered around Chilean vocalist Caterina Nix who, for this sophomore release from the band, worked in close collaboration with fellow Chilean producer, singer, and musician Nasson. Together, they have created an absolute gem of a metal album. Today they release a lyric video for the title track of “Furyborn,” featuring Tom Englund of Evergrey on guest vocals.” We get Caterina to discuss new music, influences, and much more…\n\n1. Tell us a little about your latest release. What might a fan or listener not grab the first or second time they listen through? Are there any hidden nuggets the band put in the material or that only diehard fans might find?\n\nI know I should say you should listen to it and try to find the hidden nuggets haha, but sorry there aren’t any. Being the head of the project I wanted to take make something different in comparison with the previous Chaos Magic album, and with the work done during the production of Furyborn, that becomes quite evident. This record has a more ”in your face” attitude.\n\n2. What got you into music, and can you tell us about the moment you realized you wanted to be a musician?\n\nI’ve liked music since I can remember. At an early age (when you can’t play music yourself) you feel interpreted by it, so I’d sing my favorite tunes (kids music mainly… 4, 5 years old) and then I started listening to rock thanks to my bigger brother (maybe at 6 or 7). And we had good times, so that stuck to me. At 12 or so I started listening to metal bands and I thought… wow, this is incredible, this is what I want, this is me. Metal wasn’t the only type of music I listened to, I mean I still love bands like Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Music is the dye that colors your life experiences, that’s why it’s so important to me. When I finished high school (I was singing in like 3 or 4 bands at that time) I wanted to become an opera singer… but the chances of making a living here with that profession are very narrow. So I studied law and continued with music, getting singing lessons (both opera and pop), I never abandoned the idea of making a living as a musician.\n\n3. Building on that, is there a specific song, album, performer, or live show that guided your musical taste?\n\nI think there are many, but Bruce Dickinson was always an example for me, love his vocal technique and his live performance. Freddy Mercury of course, for obvious reasons and when I was a bit older, I heard Nightwish and I was stunned. In fact, at 17 or so I joined a Nightwish tribute band and started making original music thanks to that. Stratovarius was another band that built my musical taste.\n\n4. Who would be your main five musical influences?\n\nI think there are moments in your life where you see yourself influenced by different bands or songs. In my Aghonya times I wanted to mix Fear Factory with Evanescence and the darker songs of NIN with a twist of Nightwish. Now I tried to find a more unique sound but there’s definitely some of that young girl in there. I think I kept in mind some nostalgic feeling of the early days of Linkin Park, and also Lacuna Coil, Evergrey, Symphony X, and things like Drowning Pool and Amaranthe.\n\n5. If you could call in any one collaborator to do a song with, who would it be, and why?\n\nHard question! Russel Allen. One of the best singers I’ve heard, period. Besides, he’s a passionate and magnetic performer. I really hope I can make it happen in the future. One of my other dream collabs already came true with Tom Englund!\n\n6. How would you describe your music to someone who’d never listened to you before? What is the one comparison a reviewer or fan has made that made you cringe or you disagreed with?\n\nIf I had to describe my current music with the mixture of styles comprising it, I’d say there’s heavy, melodic, alternative and electronic metal, with mild traces of symphonic elements. If I had to describe it with words, I’d say it’s strong, passionate, engaging with dark lyrics and catchy melodies. I don’t think I’ve been angry at any comparisons, or maybe I haven’t read all the reviews or fan comments. I’ve heard a few comparisons but I haven’t minded really. I truly believe I have a voice and a sound of my own (with obvious influences), but I’m not gonna get angry if I’m compared to a band I happen to like. I’ll take it as a compliment.\n\n7. What’s the best thing about being a musician?\n\nMusic means a lot to me, it’s something that goes with me everywhere. It’s a vehicle for expression, it’s a canvass for your emotions, it helps people through, and it’s a universal language. So, just being able to create that, being able to manifest what you carry within through music is a gift. Giving others something to vibrate with is incredible. Singing is a gift also…you are an instrument yourself, you make music with your body, it’s primal and amazing. Plus, sharing that with your band is priceless, I love playing live.\n\n8. When the band are all hanging out together, who cooks; who gets the drinks in; and who is first to crack out the acoustic guitars for a singalong?\n\nMy husband! He’s not in the band but his part of the gang. He cooks and provides the alcohol. The acoustic guitars would be Nasson’s thing, and singing karaoke too.\n\n9. When was the last time you were star struck and who was it?\n\nI’ve had so many great chances of playing with incredible bands and meeting my favorite musicians! I don’t think I get paralyzed or anything weird, but when I met Zakk Wylde I’m pretty sure stars were shooting out of my eyes and I looked like a 5 year old in front of a birthday cake.\n\n10. If you weren’t a musician, what would be your dream job?\n\nIf rescuing animals were lucrative, that’s where I’d be. Or maybe I’d be a plastic surgeon or a makeup entrepreneur.\n\n11. Looking back over your career, is there a single moment or situation you feel was a misstep or you would like to have a “do over”, even if it didn’t change your current situation?\n\nNot really, all I’ve done has brought me here, and I’m at a happy place right now. Maybe I would have gone for a more determined image (like a character) for my previous album, but I don’t lose sleep over it. I own all my decisions.\n\n12. If you could magically go back in time and be a part of the recording sessions for any one record in history, which would you choose – and what does that record mean to you?\n\nI should have been Iron Maiden’s singer in The X Factor. J Imagine that. A woman from the bottom of the world, replacing Bruce Dickinson! I’d be a legend right now, hahaha! I love that album, and you know what? I think Blaze gave Iron Maiden a special twist, in spite of all the criticism that surrounded that record. I hold this album dear cause I heard it during a really good period of my life just being a kid, having fun.\n\nCATERINA NIX LINKS:\n\nOFFICIAL SITE\n\nFACEBOOK\n\nRelated"
