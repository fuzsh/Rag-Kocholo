I use some of the Sonlight stuff this year (20th Century, as I'm sure you can tell), but there isn't enough commentary, so we use Barron's booknotes and some SparkNotes on line. The first two years we used Omnibus--the lists for 9th and 10 include most of the Primary Readings, plus a few we added.\n\nHope this helps--now, or maybe in the future! lol\n\nMy youngest is dyslexic and has just this year gotten up to grade level in reading. I don't require her to read books relating to what we're studying yet. Right now, she can choose pretty much anything she wants to read for her silent reading as long as it's at least 4th grade level (3rd grade level from August through December). She can read pretty much anything she wants for out loud reading as long as it's at least 4th grade level, but I encourage her to try more difficult books since I'm able to help her out then. The numbers that you see after some of the books are Lexile levels.\n\naap = Animal Ark Pets series\n\nms = How I Survived Middle School series\n\nHannah 4th grade\n\nsilent reading - Hannah to herself, at least 3rd grade level (until December)\n\n(aap#2) Kitten Crowd - 530 (aap#3) Rabbit Race - 480\n\n(aap#4)Mouse Magic - 580 (ms#1) Can You Get an F in Lunch? - 640\n\n(aap#6) Chick Challenge - 570 (aap#7) Pony Parade - 710\n\n(aap#8) Guinea Pig Gang- 440 (aap#9) Gerbil Genius - 760\n\n(aap#10) Duckling Diary - 500 (ms#2) Madame President\n\n(ms#3) I Heard a Rumor (aap#11)Lamb Lesson - 680\n\n(aap#12) Doggy Dare - 580 (aap#13) Cat Craze - 540\n\n(aap#15) Ferret Fun - 600 (aap#) Frog Friends - 730\n\n(aap#) Pets Party - 540 (aap#) Spaniel Surprise\n\n--------------------------------\n\nsilent reading - at least 4th grade level (since January)\n\nRabbit Rescue (Costello)\n\nFrightened Fawn (Costello)\n\nLast Holiday Concert (Clements) - 800\n\nNo Talking (Clements) -\n\nThe World According to Kaley (Regan) - 910\n\nThe Princess and the Pirate\n\nThe Doll People (Martin) - 570\n\n(ms#5)Cheat Sheet\n\n(ms#4) The New Girl\n\n(ms#6) P.S.
