While society often teaches us the value of being outspoken and assertive, Nix reminds us that true strength lies in knowing when to hold our tongues. Keeping silent in certain situations can prevent unnecessary conflicts, maintain harmony, and even give us the upper hand. Often, words can be wielded as weapons, causing irreparable damage. By recognizing the times when it is necessary to keep our mouths shut, we gain the ability to preserve relationships, protect ourselves from harmful consequences, and uphold our integrity. It is in this self-restraint that we truly harness our greatest power.",
