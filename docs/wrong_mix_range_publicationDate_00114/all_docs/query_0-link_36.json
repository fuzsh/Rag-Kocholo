        "text": "Thinking of the wonderful song, but could also mean all the fall departures I’ve had – and will have. (Best version of ‘Autumn Leaves’? My favourite is Duke’s band on ‘Ellington Indigos’, with a stunning, soaring vocal.)\n\nI’m just back from really enjoyable experiences in Vancouver and Ottawa at their author festivals. Vancouver was the amusingly-billed ‘Intimate Evening with Guy Gavriel Kay’. I teased that I half-thought I was expected to wear a red velvet smoking jacket, carry a glass of armagnac, and sound like Vincent Price. No. None of that happened. I told some stories, read my elegy for my friend George Jonas, who died early this year, then read from Children, and there were a lot of really good questions. Ottawa was a shorter reading then an onstage interview with Kate Heartfield, writer, teacher, ex of the Ottawa Citizen editorial board. I had a first in that signing line: signed a book for a 4 1/2 months in the womb baby, at the mother-to-be’s request. Have signed for (very) small kids, as parents wanted them to read the books when they grow up, but this was new. In Toronto, at their festival Monday, I was on a panel discussing writing about history (yes, you know I love this stuff) and also introduced my dear friend and agent, Linda McKnight, as she received the Ivy Prize for lifetime contribution to Canadian publishing. A really lovely moment.\n\nNext up, tomorrow morning to Columbus, where World Fantasy Con is this year. I am Sad because my Aussie whisky-drinking chums, Garth Nix and Jonathan Strahan, are AWOL this year. Will expect to seek solace in various bars to cheer for the Cubs – in Ohio, yet!\n\nNext week is an event for the Writers’ Trust here Tuesday afternoon, then another visit to Waterloo for their Wild Writers Festival (yes, they called it that) on Thursday night. I’m in Halifax reading at the library on the 17th, then talking the next day to a graduate seminar at Dalhousie, which is studying my work as filtered through various medieval texts and themes.\n\nAnd yes, I’m reading. A lot. Trying to discover what the next novel wants to be. No, it hasn’t told me. Yet. Well, hints, gleanings, possibilities…the usual process for me, in fact.\n\nHere, so you have it in one place, is the fall schedule. Hope to see some of you yet as I move around.\n\nUpdate time.\n\nTomorrow I head for the west coast and a first appearance at the Sunshine Coast Festival in Sechelt, a little up the coast from Vancouver. There’s a pontoon plane that takes you there from near the Vancouver airport. If I miss the (tight) connection the gallant Penguin rep there has volunteered to hasten out to the aiport and whip me (well, drive me) to the ferry terminal for the alternative (scenic) route. I will owe her a Negroni or something if that happens.\n\nhttp://www.writersfestival.ca\n\nI’m reading there Friday evening, after which I might propose a mass migration down to the water to look up at the Perseid meteors… word is their biggest shower in a long long time (200 an hour!), and Friday midnight is peak time, we’re told. My favourite Perseid memory is watching them with my family in the countryside of Provence, the year we went back there, when I wrote Ysabel.\n\nThere are a whole slew of other appearances coming up in September and October, ‘festival season’, and I just signed off on a trip to Halifax in mid-November, too. I’ll get firm details posted on Bright Weavings, and on Twitter and Facebook nearer the dates. It is unusual for a spring book to still have ‘legs’ this far into the summer, with fall books already appearing, so I’m genuinely touched that Children has stayed on the Canadian hardcover lists for 12 weeks now. By this point that is going to be due to enthused readers and word of mouth, so when I say thank you (and I do!) I mean it.\n\nPenguin Canada are continuing with their rejacketing of their entire backlist. The first three came out when Children did (I posted images here) and the next three are in October. Here are those covers. (Autocorrect keeps wanting to make ‘rejacketing’ into ‘rejecting’…they are not rejecting the books!)\n\nI love what their designer has been doing with these (last three will appear in January; Penguin Canada have 9 of my backlist titles, Fionavar is HarperCollins in Canada). The idea of a uniform ‘look’ for an author’s work is awfully appealing.\n\nOver in UK the good news is that Fionavar will be out very soon as ebooks from Hodder, my new publishers. Under Heaven is now on sale in Turkey (a new market for me) and the German edition is slated for October. France’s River of Stars is November. In France, as well, Ysabel has now been nominated for the Prix Elbakin as best translated book, the award Under Heaven won there last year. I do better at foreign language updates over on Twitter, as they are the sort of quick hits that suit 140 characters!\n\nI had an essay run in Walrus Magazine last month; if you missed it, here’s the link:\n\nhttps://thewalrus.ca/something-to-write-home-about/\n\nAnd that’s (a bit of) the news for August 10th. Back to the Olympics with pleasure and the American elections with increasing disbelief.\n\nI have been thinking of my dad today, of course, and sharing the poem I wrote for him years ago seems apt on Father’s Day (Penguin have given me permission to do this, from Beyond This Dark House).\n\nNIGHT DRIVE: ELEGY\n\nDriving through Winnipeg this autumn\n\ntwilight, a sensation has lodged\n\nsomewhere behind my breastbone\n\n(impossible to be more precise).\n\nIt is at once a lightness and a weight,\n\npress of memory and a feeling\n\nas if tonight has insufficient\n\ngravity to keep me from\n\ndrifting back, so many\n\nlong years after leaving here.\n\nQuiet streets, the slowly darkening\n\nsky (it can take a while). I turn\n\non Waterloo and stop outside the house\n\nwhere we first lived. No curtains drawn\n\non the living room windows. I can see\n\ninto the past, almost. The willow in front\n\nis so tall now. My parents planted it.\n\nWe played football on this lawn\n\n(and the next one down, and next,\n\nas we grew older, needed room to run).\n\nUsed the willow sapling when cutting\n\npass patterns, slicing in front of it\n\nto shake a defender. I hear\n\nmy mother from the porch, ‘Don’t\n\nbreak the tree!’ A car approaches,\n\nslows, someone looks at me\n\nin the gathering night, moves on.\n\nSo do I, gliding a little further\n\nto Mathers Bay, where we’d race\n\nour bikes, the finish line\n\nright at the intersection,\n\nso we’d be flying flat-out\n\nand sometimes have to brake\n\nin a squeal and sideways skid\n\n(black tire marks on the road)\n\nif a car was coming east.\n\nI wouldn’t let my sons do that today.\n\nThe houses along the bay,\n\ndown to the curve and back\n\nup the other side, were homes of friends,\n\nor girls I longed for, and their\n\nparents – men and women mostly\n\ndead now. Each address marks\n\na grave. Ghosts water the night\n\nlawns, rake leaves under stars,\n\nlook up as I coast by\n\nand then turn away, as if politely,\n\nnot to seem to stare as this rented car\n\nstops again, this time outside\n\nour second home, the one\n\nmy parents built when I was nine.\n\nI am heavy and light tonight,\n\nentangled and drifting, both\n\nat once. The city\n\nis so full of my father.\n\nI used to ride with him to Saturday\n\nmorning rounds at the hospital.\n\nProud, anxious not to show it (Why\n\nwas that? Did he know?) as we’d step\n\noff the elevator and onto a post-op ward.\n\nI’d read a book by the nursing station\n\nthen cross the street to the\n\nSalibury House (long gone now)\n\nand order two sandwiches, a milkshake\n\nand a coffee, but only at the exact\n\nminute he’d told me to. And he’d\n\narrive from his last patient just\n\nas the waitress set the food in front of me.\n\nI’m guessing he’d watch from the window\n\nor door, to time it so exactly, for his son.\n\nEast on Mathers now, imagining kids\n\non bikes careening into my path forty\n\nyears ago. Waverley, and south. I’d\n\nhitchhike this route to campus, winter\n\nmornings, dreaming of away, anywhere\n\naway. My parents had their first\n\ndate at a nightclub out here on\n\nPembina Highway. My father just back\n\nfrom overseas. She thought he was\n\nphony-British, using words like ‘chap’\n\nand ‘bloody,’ all night long. Still, (she’d\n\nlater tell her sons), that night she\n\nwent home to Enniskillen Avenue and woke\n\nher mother. Sat on the edge of the bed and said\n\nshe thought she’d met a man she could love.\n\nWe never tired of that story.\n\nOur pretty mother,barely into her twenties,\n\nher immediate certainty, the dashing\n\nimage of our father, home from away,\n\naway, winning a woman for himself.\n\nThe city’s quiet on a Thursday night.\n\nThe forecast was rain but the sky’s been clear,\n\nthe air cooling down; football\n\ngames and burning leaves. Back north now,\n\non what seems to have become\n\na night drive entirely unplanned. I steer\n\nwith one hand at twelve o’clock and\n\nan elbow out the open window.\n\nThe downtown ‘Y’ has been demolished.\n\nMy Uncle Jack would take me there\n\non Sunday mornings for a steam and\n\na swim. Such a sweet man. White hair\n\nmy father always joked of envying, ruefully\n\nshaking his head in admiration. Dad’s\n\nwas a duller, white-grey, nondescript. Except,\n\nit seems, the morning of the day he was\n\nkilled in Florida, my mother said to\n\nhim over breakfast, ‘Sam, look at your\n\nhair! It’s white as Jack’s!’ Salt water,\n\nwinter sun, had bleached it bright.\n\nI imagine my father surprised\n\nand pleased, and thinking of his brother\n\nwhen he took that last walk\n\nwith the dog along the coastal highway\n\nin too much twilight.\n\nThere seems to be no crossing of streets\n\ntonight where I can avoid\n\nhitting my father or myself. Wellington\n\nCrescent now, west towards the park\n\nwhere I first kissed some girls, broke up\n\nwith others, dreamed of going away. My father\n\ntook a troopship to England in the\n\nlast year of the war, stayed over there\n\nin Scotland for five years, came back,\n\ncame back, married, had three sons.\n\nHe taught each of us to catch a football, lost\n\ndeliberately (to each of us) in table tennis,\n\ngrimacing elaborately at a drive mis-hit\n\ninto the net, not fooling anyone. He’d look\n\nshocked, shocked when we accused him\n\nof letting us win, as if the idea\n\ncouldn’t have even crossed his mind.\n\nHe quizzed me before high school tests,\n\ntsking with dismay at wrong answers\n\nthat were clear evidence of insufficient\n\napplication. He worked so hard.\n\nI think we knew that, even very young,\n\nbut still assumed he’d have infinite time\n\nand room for us. I wince, tonight, remembering\n\nthe absolute sureness of that. How did he\n\nelicit so much certainty? I wonder\n\nif he ever looked for and found\n\nclear signs of his own nature in\n\nthree very different sons,\n\nor if that kind of thinking\n\nrequired too much vanity.\n\nI liked coming home from a downtown\n\nappointment with him. Walking to\n\nthe Mall Medical Building, waiting\n\nin the doctors’ lounge, listening to the\n\ntalk of football and politics, grabbing\n\nmyself a Coke from the little fridge, and then\n\nthe feel of the room altering as he came in,\n\nloosening his tie, hanging up the white coat,\n\nraising an eyebrow at my soft drink\n\nbefore dinner. The drive back home,\n\njust the two of us, end of a work day. He’d steer\n\nwith one hand at twelve o’clock and\n\nan elbow out the open window. No one\n\never born had hands I’d ever rather feel\n\nenclosing mine. Then. Now. The day\n\nthe son we named for him was born.\n\nIf it was summer, turning west on Grant,\n\nthe sunlight would be on us. We’d put\n\nthe visors down. (I was too short for that\n\nto help, but copied him.) Or it might have been\n\ndarker, cooler, under a prairie sky\n\nin a twilight like the one that started\n\nand compels these images,\n\nif it was autumn then, as it is now,\n\nabove this ground of memories.\n\nHeaviness, and that so-strange\n\nsense of weightlessness. I thought,\n\nbefore, I couldn’t locate these feelings\n\nprecisely within myself. Not so,\n\nin the end. They reside, together,\n\nanywhere my father was in this city\n\nand in me, which is pretty much\n\neverywhere, and he’s been\n\ndead too many years now already,\n\nwith more years and more years\n\nand more long years of being gone\n\nstill to come.\n\nWith an unexpected, and pleasing, level of agreement the three editors for Children of Earth and Sky had amazingly similar shortlists for the photo contest. What makes it even nicer is that I also agreed!\n\nWe all muttered a lot (if you can mutter in an email) about other genuinely good candidates for prizes – and I’m going to share a number of honourable mentions in a later post.\n\nThe underlying idea, you’ll recall, was a photo of the book ‘in the wild’. Two of the editors specified this as significant in making their final pick, the notion that the photo needed to show the book clearly, to fit that concept and win.\n\nSo, without pretending to having trouble tearing open the envelope or anything so lame, herewith the winner as selected by Nicole Winstanley, Claire Zion and Oliver Johnson:\n\nTerrence Drake wins the leather-bound copy of Children of Earth and Sky. He and his photographer were, well, on fire. Unique? Check. Book clearly shown? Check. Wild in many ways? Check, indeed.\n\nWe have a tie for runner-up, however (in order to keep peace and harmony in the kingdoms, there’s enough warfare in the book!). These two will each receive signed copies of the new Penguin Canada reprints of three of their backlist titles (the first three of nine coming in next months). Thanks go out to Nicole and her team at Penguin Canada, not only for the leather-bound, but for shipping two sets of these!\n\nFirst runner-up, because everyone thought it was genuinely funny, is “Ichabod Noodle”, who captioned this one: “Half time at the footy. Giants up by 44, Senjani pirates raiding. ‪#TwoPassions”\n\nTwo passions, indeed. Though I lament I could only get his attention at the half! (And in a 44 point blowout, too!)\n\nThe other runner-up was picked for being simply beautiful and evocative. It is Jenna MacWhirter whose caption was “Though The Walls Crumble Around Me”. Gorgeously located, framed, the lovely colour of the blue dress (there’s a riff on blue in painting in the book), definitely in the wild.\n\nI’ll do that follow-up post soon with other photos that were discussed, and greatly enjoyed. You can see them all for yourselves under the hashtag #ReadThisGuy, on Twitter.\n\nHere’s a look at the prizes.\n\nIf the winners would send me Direct Messages on Twitter (I’ll follow them all now, to make that possible) with your preferred mailing addresses, and how you’d like the books inscribed, we’ll get you your prizes asap.\n\nCongratulations to all three of you! And thank you to everyone who entered. All my editors reported how much fun this was (despite how tough it also was), and I felt exactly the same way.\n\nSo, we spent January through mid-March working down south (San Miguel de Allende in Mexico, then northern California) to cleverly dodge the worst of winter and come home to spring – and it is freezing! My car is covered with snow. People lied to us. This is weather to stay inside and write a journal post…\n\nThe ever-changing online culture means that Twitter and now Facebook become my quick ways of sharing things, and if you want to see what I am saying regularly on subjects from baseball to puns to single malt to, well, my books, chase me down there. But this remains where I can come to go ‘longform’ and update things.\n\nWe are in full-on pre-release mode now, all publishers. My inbox overfloweth. I do count this as part of being a writer, though when I was younger I begrudged the extreme distraction from research and writing. Now, it is essentially part of what a writer owes his or her publishers (and family, and whatever bank has the mortgage!).\n\nThe earliest pre-publication reviews have been wonderful. I say this drawing a breath of pleased relief. It is simply the case that one never knows. The fact that readers and reviewers have liked earlier work does not mean they’ll like a new book. And as you build a body of work, to a degree you are competing with yourself. ‘Better than his last one!’ ‘I really like it, but I loved his X more years ago!’ There is no real way around this, for any artist, much as you might wish a book (or film, painting, piece of music) to be judged for itself. There are many overlapping contexts for assessments. As readers we bring – obviously – ourselves to a book and what we are, our needs in art, will change, year to year, even day to day.\n\nOne reviewer half-worried readers might find the ‘history’ as compelling as the characters. I don’t find that a worry! I love that effect. I was taken with a similar line in a review of Annie Proulx (great writer!) and her new book, meant there as high praise: ‘it becomes clear that history and time are the main characters here.’\n\nI like that! Not necessarily the ‘main’ characters (they aren’t, in mine) but definitely an awareness shaped in the reader of them. One reader’s worry is another’s catnip. Something we all need to be aware of, as writers and readers.\n\nPublishers’ Weekly today (April 4) released a starred review for Children. They are probably the most influential of the advance review organizations, they affect what bookstores and libraries order, and how many copies, so a starred review is really good news. The last lines are: ‘He wields plots and all-too-human characters brilliantly…This big, powerful fantasy offers an intricately detailed setting, marvelously believable characters, and an international stew of cultural and religious conflict writ larger than large.‘\n\nYes, everyone is happy about that. If you ever find me at a reading and buy me a drink I’ll tell you something ironic about it.\n\nAs to that, the tour is just about ready to be posted. Another new thing these days: some of the bookstores and venues have already announced my upcoming appearances on their own websites. That never used to happen. But the publicists coordinating (primarily Trish Bunnett at PRH Canada, who is doing heroic work on this) prefer to lock in and nail down (and other phrases!) as many dates as possible before posting an almost-full tour schedule. There are always later add-ons, nature of the game.\n\nWe’ll have finished books in the warehouse in 2-3 weeks. Always, always a ‘moment’ when a writer first sees the book. Publication date is May 10th Canada and United States – May 12th in UK – though it may be in some stores a few days ahead. The worldwide launch event (I can reveal this) will be here in Toronto the evening of May 11th, in the big Appel Salon of the main Reference Library.\n\nThe audiobook, narrated by the wonderful Simon Vance is finished, and will be out at the same time. He wrote me a beautiful note about needing to pause at times to control emotion as he read. (We met him and his wife in California last month – genuinely lovely people.)\n\nThere will be more from me here this month. Possibly the next post will be that link to the tour gigs when Trish is ready. Here’s something cool, meanwhile. Elizabeth Cameron, who handles online publicity/marketing for PRH Canada, had animated cover images made. Fun.\n\nchildren-of-earth-and-sky (1)\n\nI’ve always described these as ‘tour journals’ since my early model, back with the first one, was writers on tour offering insights (usually funny) as to the vagaries of life as a writer on the road. You know, arrive at a signing in one city and there is promotion but no books have arrived, arrive in another and books are in the bookstore but they forgot to promote the event. (Yes, both happen.)\n\nOver the years I’ve expanded the journal concept to include activities that start well before the tour itself (finishing the draft, copyediting, covers, first marketing meetings), but we’ve now reached that actual On the Road planning stage.\n\nWe could pause for an authorial lament at how damned early everything happens these days. Or did I do that rant already, about sending out the first Advance Reading Copies? Probably. I give good rant I have been told.\n\nSo, here’s the thing about book tours: they don’t happen nearly as much any more and the debate as to their efficacy concerning cost and time is ongoing, and varies case by case. Margaret Atwood or Stephen King on the road makes sense for everyone. There is guaranteed coverage and events will succeed by any measure one wants. Still, a lot of time, airports, hotel rooms, publisher money spent, but the calculation tilts strongly to ‘let’s do it’.\n\nWhen you see younger authors on tour, be kind, odds are good they are spending some of their own money, are speaking to small numbers, are stressed, and may be sleeping on someone’s couch. Buy a book.\n\nFor me, over the years, tours remain worth it if well set-up. That involves two different elements. Obviously bookstore reading/signing events, at a store committed to promoting the evening, and with a constituency in any given city that are legitimately excited that there’s a new book out. The second element has gotten trickier: media. The simple truth is that there are fewer newspapers out there, there’s less coverage of books (especially fiction), radio and tv coverage of books has dropped significantly, which means less to do on the road, and fewer chances to promote the signing event, too.\n\nThe slack, to a fair degree, has been picked up by online coverage. Book bloggers, online mags, and mainstream media that delegate book world coverage to their online sections. And all of these can just as easily interview a writer sitting at his or her computer typing answers to an e-interview. Why fly somewhere?\n\nIndeed, here’s a secret: many of the local print interviews you see with a writer who has arrived in town for an event were done online or by telephone the week before. But they were only done after the newspaper or magazine confirmed the author was coming to town! They wouldn’t have happened without that assurance. In other words, you have to commit to the tour to get the at-home interview.\n\nAnother variable (everyone taking notes?) is author festivals. Many cities now have these, with significant numbers of writers coming in sometimes. The upside for a publisher is that the festivals can (often via grants they get) cover much or even all of the cost of getting writers there. The downside is that bit about ‘significant numbers of writers’ … signal to noise ratio. It can be challenging for a publisher to get attention for their writer (and sometimes they have a few writers!). The upside for an author is, often, that the festivals can be a lot of fun. No, I am not about to tell the good stories.\n\nAll of this is prelude to the fact that last week I started getting draft itineraries and options to assess for hitting the road in May.\n\nPublicists get in touch with bookstores, festivals, media way ahead (not ranting, not!) because so much needscoordinating. There can be conflicts of a varied nature. You don’t want to do a reading on Mother’s Day! (Pro tip.) You don’t want two major authors doing events in a city on same day or evening. (Duh.) Reading with someone else can double the audience (if the authors are roughly matched in significance), reading with four others may not be not all that great for tour value. There’s a trend I like of doing onstage interviews not just readings, and if there’s a wonderful interviewer in a city, you need to check her schedule, too. Bookstores sometimes compete for a writer. Flattering, of course, but publishers need to be careful, and fair. If you give X store Y writer, you may need to give B writer to C store the next week. I always push for my events to be at indie bookstores (a crusade of sorts) but it is simply foolish not to acknowledge the importance of the chains in selling books, and dropping in to sign stock and meet fans on the staff at those is just good manners.\n\nSo, what we know now (what we think we know now) is that Children of Earth and Sky will have its worldwide launch in Toronto on May 11th, in the Appel Salon at the Toronto Reference Library. I’ve launched there twice, they do terrific work, and a bookseller will be there (it is obviously a plum gig for whichever bookseller does this, and that, too, can get political). I’ll head west in Canada the next day, then go down the west coast into the States at the end of that. All details will be released well ahead as they firm up. There will also be events later in summer, and in fall, at various festivals.\n\nDo I enjoy it? What curmudgeon ever admits to something like that? Seriously, people. My longstanding joke has been that the only people less happy than authors on tour are the authors not on tour.\n\nMore seriously, by now I mostly do have fun on the road. For one thing, I’m not prolific, this isn’t an annual exercise (some overseas tours and events can happen between books, though). I have old friends in many cities, media friends in some, and there are bookstores I love visiting. (McNally Robinson in Winnipeg, both the University store and Elliot Bay in Seattle, as examples…) There is even an invite this spring to a top secret single malt night if I have a free evening in a Particular City. This needs to happen.\n\nI also find it a really good way to get a bit of the pulse of the book business in any year. The online world can be insular, meeting the people selling books in their stores, meeting my own readers, talking to journalists …I learn a lot from all of this about the world in which I operate professionally.\n\nSo, yes, I enjoy it. Don’t tattle.\n\nSo, George Burns was glorious comedian (along with the equally glorious Gracie Allen for years and years). Late in life he developed a running joke about a sequence of ‘Farewell Tours’. I’ve been thinking about that in terms of writers and ‘finishing books’.\n\nWe’re finished, then we’re really finished, then…\n\nI’m done when the ending is written, then done when my first full revision with editor notes is finished, then done when I review the copy-editor’s careful pass-through, then finally done when I proofread (and trim, amend, sharpen) the typeset manuscript – which is a stage when I’m just supposed to be looking for typos. Yeah, right. Like that’s all that’s going to happen.\n\nThat last stage is, truly, an author’s (this author’s) last chance to make it better before the book gets printed and bound and, you know, bought and read. (Ideally.) So I am always doing small, but for me necessary, little fiddles. This, in turn, makes me a bad proofreader of my own books, because good proofreaders do not get sidetracked or hung up on reading for content, they are reading for errors, and getting drawn into the rhythm of sentences distracts, big time, from that.\n\nI’m grateful, always, that there are professional proofreaders who work separately from me, with a cold eye for a typo or dropped comma. Indeed, I just learned from the production editor an hour ago that the proofreader for Children of Earth and Sky spotted an umlaut instead of a tilde (!!) on a word in the map. That is an impressive catch, and underscores the detailed reading the good ones give you.\n\nAuthor adjustments, and the proofing ‘catches’ are the reason why if you ever see an Advance Reading Copy (ARC) of a book, you’ll notice a ‘not to be quoted without checking against the final version’ notice. (I do wonder how many reviewers actually do that, but…) The ARC is before this happens, it is a 95% or so version of a book, maybe 99% for some writers, but the book does get changed.\n\nIn any case, the fact that the production editor has the manuscript from both of us tells you that the final farewell for this book has happened here — it is, literally, out of my hands. Courier claimed it around noon. (Yes, I get edgy until I get a call or email that it has arrived at the publishers.)\n\nThis may require a Rob Roy or Negroni to deal with. Book’s done. Can’t call it home."
