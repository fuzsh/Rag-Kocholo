Submit a lot, even if you only get rejections (all writers get rejections). Most of all, don't give up.\" \"Most of my books seem to stem from a single image or thought that lodges in my brain and slowly grows into something that needs to be expressed. That thought may be a 'what if?' or perhaps just an image. Typically I seem to think about a book for a year or so before I actually start writing.\""
