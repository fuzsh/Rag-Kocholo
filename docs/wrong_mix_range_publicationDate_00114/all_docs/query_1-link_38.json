        "text": "Recommended by Chelsea\n\nBeautifully Me\n\nBy Nabela Noor, illustrated by Nabi H. Ali\n\nZubi is thrilled to dress for her first day of school until she hears everyone criticizing their bodies, so she turns her own critical eye on herself. This is such an important book for all ages, as it calls on us to remember the impact of our words — even when they are directed at ourselves.\n\nRecommended by Ann\n\nThe Beatryce Prophecy\n\nBy Kate DiCamillo, illustrated by Sophie Blackall\n\nThe Beatryce Prophecy is the definition of a modern classic. You turn the pages realizing that people will be moved by Kate DiCamillo’s words and Sophie Blackall’s drawings for generations to come. Brave Beatryce, fierce Answelica and gentle Brother Edik are indelible characters. Buy it in hardback and keep it forever.\n\nThis month’s Spark Book Club selection — read more below!\n\nRecommended by Becca\n\nMayor Good Boy: (A Graphic Novel)\n\nBy Dave Scheidt, illustrated by Miranda Harmon\n\nWe’re not sure if all kids are obsessed with dogs, or if our shop dogs happen to attract a crowd of dog and book-loving kids. Due to our canine-obsessed customers, we are quite literally always looking for the next great graphic novel for fans of the Dog Man series, and I think that Mayor Good Boy might just do the trick!\n\nRecommended by Jordan\n\nA Soft Place to Land\n\nBy Janae Marks\n\nDo you like mysteries? Stories about friendship? Contemplating what makes a house feel like a home? If so, you will love this story about Joy Taylor and her new friends and the secret hideout they discover in their apartment complex. The hideout becomes a refuge for Joy, who is struggling with a lot of changes, especially when she starts exchanging messages there with another anonymous kid.\n\nRecommended by Chelsea\n\nTo Break a Covenant\n\nBy Alison Ames\n\nSet in a town that is famous for its abandoned mine that draws in ghosthunters (and only sometimes spits them back out), To Break a Covenant tell the stories of four girls who are determined to find out what’s really going on in that mine. Perfectly atmospheric with eerie images and haunting scenery, this debut is the perfect fall read.\n\nRecommended by Brad\n\nBluebird\n\nBy Sharon Cameron\n\nWith her signature prose and twists and turns lurking around every corner, Bluebird is impossible to put down. Cleverly told during different points in time, Bluebird brilliantly shows what it means to have a change of heart, and what true justice means. Though my heart broke from these horrific historical events, these characters are a true beacon of hope. This is Sharon Cameron’s masterpiece.\n\nThis month’s ParnassusNext selection — read more below!\n\nRecommended by Aly\n\nOnce Upon a Broken Heart\n\nBy Stephanie Garber\n\nEvangeline will do anything it takes to get her happily ever after, including making a deal with a mysterious Fate. She quickly enters a storybook land of magic, romance, and murder, In this follow-up to the Caraval series, Stephanie Garber creates a glittering world where nothing is as it seems and even doorways whisper secrets. It may have started with a kiss, but be warned — this is not a love story.\n\nRecommended by Brad\n\nWhite Smoke\n\nWhite Smoke is another knockout novel by one of the most incredible and important authors in the YA world today. Tiffany D. Jackson is sure to chill readers to the bone with this harrowing novel that had my blood racing and my heart pounding. It’s hard to creep me out while reading, but Jackson managed to have my skin crawling and keep me looking over my shoulder — and I loved every second of it.\n\nRecommended by Brad\n\nBeasts of Prey\n\nBy Ayana Gray\n\nAtmospheric and dark as the jungle itself, Beasts of Prey is a fabulous debut that lands on every single mark. So many twists and turns can be found within this novel, and I truly found myself on the edge of my seat waiting to see what lurked in the shadows next. Beautiful writing, fascinating lore, and relatable characters make Beasts of Prey a standout of the year — and Ayana Gray an author to keep on your radar.\n\nSpark Book Club: October Selection\n\nThe Beatryce Prophecy\n\nBy Kate DiCamillo, illustrated by Sophie Blackall\n\nThe October 2021 Spark Book Club selection is The Beatryce Prophecy by Kate DiCamillo, illustrated by Sophie Blackall.

Tenderly illuminated by Caldecott Medalist Blackall’s atmospheric, fine-lined b&w art, this compassionate tale rejoices in “the wonder of being known,” the protective powers of understanding one’s identity, and the strength found in the hard head of a beloved goat.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\nSpark Book Club is the first editions club for middle grade readers.
