        "text": "With her angelic voice and emotionally incisive songwriting, Emmylou Harris has been a guiding influence on alt-country for decades. Born in 1947, the Birmingham, AL, native spent time in Greenwich Villageâs legendary folk-music scene before linking up for collaborations with the cosmic country star Gram Parsons, including on the 1974 album Grievous Angel. In the wake of Parsonsâ death, Harris launched a solo career that balanced originals (âBoulder to Birmingham,â a touching remembrance of Parsons) and transformative covers (a 1978 take on Delbert McClintonâs âTwo More Bottles of Wineâ). She topped the country charts with 1975âs Elite Hotel and 1976âs Luxury Liner and experienced mainstream success with Trio, a 1987 collaboration with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt. As the decades progressed, Harris settled into an Americana groove that suited her musical acumen, highlighted by the 2013 and 2015 Rodney Crowell duets albums Old Yellow Moon and The Traveling Kind; the latter honored country legends such as Kris Kristofferson and Roger Miller."
