        "text": "Emmylou Harris is scheduled to bring what she calls a \"strange hodge-podge\" of music to Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium next Friday night. She'll be singing songs from her latest album, \"Bluebird,\" which she describes as \"very special songs that I've been hoarding since about 1982. It's certainly not like a bluegrass album, although, in a strange way, it's very acoustic.\" The singer plans to mix her contemporary country sound with bluegrass, folk, country rock and popular standards in her Spartanburg show with the Bellamy Brothers. Born in Alabama, Harris' family moved often, necessitated by her father's career in the military. She spent time waiting tables and singing in clubs in North Carolina, Virginia Beach, New York City and Nashville, before becoming disillusioned and rejoining her parents in Maryland. She took a job as a hostess in a model home development, but was soon persuaded to return to singing with regular appearances in a Bethesda, Md., inn and Washington nightclubs. It was in a downtown D.C. club that she met country singer Gram Parsons. Parsons was so impressed with her plaintive voice that he invited her to sing on his next album and to accompany him on his 1973 tour. Harris also accompanied Parsons on what was to be his final album, \"Grievous Angel.\" Parsons' untimely death was a shock to Harris, but led her to form her own band out of a need to recover. Her album \"Pieces of the Sky\" in 1974 hit number one on the country charts. Her music is eclectic: her 1976 album, \"Elite Hotel\" contained selections ranging from the soft Beatles' ballad \"Here, There and Everywhere,\" to the haunting clarity of Patsy Cline's \"Sweet Dreams.\" She followed with country rock albums, then returned to pure, traditional country to win a 1979 Grammy for \"Blue Kentucky Girl.\" In 1981, she took another musical turn, re-working the old pop songs, \"Mister Sandman\" and \"How High The Moon,\" and foreshadowing a teaming with Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton in 1987. Their \"Trio\" album won the three singers a Country Music Association award for Vocal Event, a new category for artists who don't usually perform together. The Bellamy Brothers, Howard and David Bellamy, are sometimes referred to as \"old hippies\" and that's fine with them, they say. Besides having a hit song of that title, they think the phrase describes them. \"We were country hippies and now we're baby boomers,\" David Bellamy explains. He thinks the cultural phenomenon is widespread, as evidenced by the growing popularity of the Bellamys' music. As the brothers note in their song, \"Kids of the Baby Boom,\" people who listened to the Rolling Stones in their teens are listening to Merle Haggard and George Jones now. And next Friday night they'll be listening to the Bellamy Brothers and Emmylou Harris. Emmylou Harris and the Bellamy Brothers are scheduled to perform at 8 p.m. March 17 at Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium. Reserved seat tickets are $14.25.\n\nWARNER BROS.
