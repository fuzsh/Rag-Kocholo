        "text": "(born 1947). The American singer and songwriter Emmylou Harris established herself as “the queen of country rock” during the late 20th century. Able to move effortlessly among folk, pop, rock, and country-and-western styles, she brought old-time sensibilities to popular music and sophistication to country music.\n\nHarris was born on April 12, 1947, in Birmingham, Alabama. After being discovered while singing folk songs in a club, Harris added her satin-smooth, country-inflected soprano to former Flying Burrito Brother Gram Parsons’s two solo albums (1973–74), which became landmarks in country rock. After Parsons’s death, Harris carried his vision forward, first in the album Pieces of the Sky (1975), which included her tribute song to Parsons (“From Boulder to Birmingham”). Following this major-label debut album, she issued a remarkable string of critically acclaimed and commercially successful recordings produced by her husband, Brian Ahern."
