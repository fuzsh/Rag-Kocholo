        "text": "Born in Alabama, Harris, 68, has won 13 Grammys and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and this year sees her become a laureate of the prestigious Polar Music Prize. Next month she releases a new album, The Traveling Kind, with Rodney Crowell. She is three times divorced and lives in Nashville, where she has a dog sanctuary.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nAt the birth of my two daughters.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nForgetting the words to songs in the middle of a show.\n\nWhat is your earliest memory?\n\nI was in my crib, and I saw my father coming in from work. He was a radio operator in the police department.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire?\n\nMichelle Obama.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nI hate confrontation.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nCruelty.\n\nWhat was your most embarrassing moment?\n\nAbout 15 years ago, I was asked to sing the national anthem at a baseball game and, being arrogant, I refused to wear the headset that would block out feedback. And, of course, without it, the very first note I sang came back to me; so I immediately stuck my fingers in my ears and put my head down. I was on the huge screen in the stadium.\n\nProperty aside, what’s the most expensive thing you’ve bought?\n\nI am ashamed to say it was a leather stage outfit – a tomato-red, western-style jacket with a full skirt the same colour. I don’t wear leather any more, except on my feet.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nMy pets: three dogs and two cats.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nMy lips are too thin.\n\nWhat is your most unappealing habit?\n\nProcrastination.\n\nWhat is your favourite smell?\n\nThe pavement and the foliage after summer rain.\n\nWhich book changed your life?\n\nThe Living by Annie Dillard – it really helped me with my songwriting.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you were growing up?\n\nA vet and, later on, an actress.\n\nWhat is top of your bucket list?\n\nI want to see the northern lights.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nAmerican Idol.\n\nWhat or who is the love of your life?\n\nMy dogs.\n\nWhat does love feel like?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nWhat is the worst job you’ve done?\n\nI had to do a lot of waitressing, and I’m just not very good at it.\n\nWhat has been your biggest disappointment?\n\nI haven’t been able to make the kind of marriage that my parents had. But I am close to all my ex-husbands. I am a better friend than I am a wife.\n\nWhen did you last cry, and why?\n\nWhen my mother died last year. She lived with me for 21 years.\n\nHow do you relax?\n\nListening to This American Life and watching baseball.\n\nWhat keeps you awake at night?\n\nNothing.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nI am still working on that.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nAs someone who championed the lives of animals.\n\nWhat is the most important lesson life has taught you?\n\nJust to carry on."
