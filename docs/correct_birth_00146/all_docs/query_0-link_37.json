As it was later revealed, he was taken prisoner and managed to escape almost one year later. Emmylou was raised according to Christian canons.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEmmylou is a child of Marine Corps officer Walter Harris and his wife, Eugenia.

Nevertheless, she returned in the 2000s, with albums âRed Dirt Girlâ which reached No. 5 on the US Country chart, continuing with releases âStumble Into Graceâ (2003) and âAll I Intended to Beâ, which reached No. 4 and No. 5, respectively.\n\nEmmylou Harrisâ net worth is evaluated at $16 million. Generally, she earned money for her music and appearing in various brandsâ commercials.\n\nSpeaking about Emmylou Harrisâ relationships, she has had several husbands. 1969 was marked by the beginning of her first marriage with Tom Slocum.\n\nThe two welcomed a daughter named Hallie and parted ways in 1970. Seven years later, Harris shared vows with a new partner Brian Ahern. In 1979 they became parents of a daughter Megan Ahern. However, in 1984, the spouses officially annulled their marriage.\n\nIn 1985 she married her boyfriend Paul Kennerley. They split up in 1993. Emmylou Harris has several grandchildren.\n\nWho are Emmylou Harris siblings?
