        "text": "Blessed with the uncanny ability to interpret the songs of other artists in her own special way, Emmylou Harris is a singer and songwriter much loved for her eloquent and expressive songwriting. The singer has a strong social conscience and is known for her poignant songs on a number of social issues that plague the society today. One of her most touching songs was about a murder victim whose violent killing had left the nation shell-shocked. Emmylou has been on the musical front for over four decades now and in the course of her long and productive career she has enriched contemporary American music in ways too numerous to be counted. Born into a career military family, Emmylou chose an entirely different profession. Bright and confident from a young age she studied drama in college. However, she realized that her true love was music and dropped out of college to pursue her passion. She started performing folk songs and soon began collaborating with other musicians. She met Gram Parsons who became her mentor and the two went on to revolutionize the folk music scenario. She is also an animal lover and has a shelter for dogs in her property."
