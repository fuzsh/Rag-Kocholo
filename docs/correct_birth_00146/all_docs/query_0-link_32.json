        "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama --\n\nhas a sentimental streak for her hometown, but some of her most cherished recollections of Birmingham are not what you might think.\n\nThe taste of sweet tea on a hot summer afternoon? The aroma of cornbread, wafting through the kitchen windows? The sound of her mother’s voice, calling from the front porch?\n\nNope. For Harris, 65, it’s all about sulfur dioxide.\n\nWorking iron and steel companies were part of the landscape here during the first six years of Harris’ life, filling the air and her senses.\n\n“It’s just one of those things that was part of my childhood,” she says during a phone interview. “I remember that we would drive across the viaduct on Sunday after church, going to Morrison’s Cafeteria. The smell of sulfur dioxide was so sweet for me. It meant we were going on a family outing.”\n\nOthers might wrinkle their noses, but Harris breathed deep. Rotten eggs? To her young mind, it was the scent of a weekend adventure.\n\nThat industrial past lingers for Harris -- in a good way, she says -- as the country-folk star contemplates a return to Birmingham. Harris and her band, the Red Dirt Boys, will perform at the\n\non Oct. 17.\n\nThe silver-haired artist, who lives in Nashville, says she’s hoping some relatives will be in attendance at the 7 p.m. show. That includes her mother, Eugenia Lou Murchison Harris, who’s likely to ride down with her daughter in the tour bus.\n\nAlso on board for Birmingham: Harris’ close companion Bella, a black Lab mix and the inspiration for her song “Big Black Dog.” It’s one of the tracks on Harris’ latest album, 2011’s “Hard Bargain.”\n\nThe lyrics of “Big Black Dog” are a tribute to Bella -- “little too much gray around the muzzle ... why she ended up at the pound is a puzzle” -- and they showcase another topic that’s close to Harris’ heart: the plight of animals in high-kill shelters.\n\nDETAILS\n\nWho:\n\nEmmylou Harris and her Red Dirt Boys.\n\nWhen:\n\nOct. 17 at 7 p.m.\n\nWhere:\n\nJemison Concert Hall, Alys Stephens Center, 1200 10th Ave. South, Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nTickets:\n\n$54.50-$74.50.\n\nInfo:\n\n205-975-2787 or\n\n.\n\n“One of the reasons I like to do that song is that I can tell her story,” Harris says. “She was moments away from being euthanized when we got her. She’s an older dog, extremely well behaved, and no one knows why she was found wandering.”\n\nHarris adopted Bella, who soon became a symbol for her backyard nonprofit,\n\n. It’s a rescue center for dogs who’ve run out of time at Metro Nashville Animal Control, providing foster care for the critters until they’re placed in permanent homes.\n\n“For me, Bella is sort of the poster dog for dogs at high-kill shelters,” Harris says. “These dogs are out there, and they’re so wonderful. I try to put that idea in people’s minds. If you’re going to rescue a dog or a cat, do it from a high-kill shelter. That’s why I say (‘Big Black Dog’) is a love song. I’m so in love with this dog. She’s one of the sweetest souls in the world.”\n\nBella and another furry friend just might make an appearance on Wednesday at the Jemison Concert Hall, but Harris says the audience shouldn’t expect any stage tricks.\n\n“They keep me company, and that’s all I require of them,” she says. “They’re very good road dogs.”\n\n“Big Black Dog” made its Birmingham debut in March of last year, when\n\n. “Hard Bargain” was still a month from its release date, so Harris focused mostly on her back catalog, with tunes such as “Orphan Girl,” “Blue Kentucky Girl,” “Red Dirt Girl,” “If I Could Only Win Your Love,” “Sweet Old World,” “Michelangelo,” “Boulder to Birmingham” and “Beyond the Great Divide.”\n\nWith a wealth of recordings at her disposal -- more than 20 studio albums, to date -- Harris doesn’t lack for signature songs. “Hard Bargain,” however, gives her writing credits on 11 of its 13 tracks. That’s unusual for Harris, who’s made her fame mostly as an interpreter, choosing songs written by others and animating them with her precise, elegant vocals.\n\n“Every time I finish a song, I don’t know if I’ll ever write another one,” she admits. “You sit there, with a blank piece of paper and a guitar, trying to come up with something that’s real and tells some kind of truth.”\n\nMission accomplished with tracks such as “The Road,” “My Name Is Emmett Till,” “Home Sweet Home,” “Lonely Girl,” \"Big Black Dog\" and “The Ship on His Arm,” all credited solely to Harris. Veteran songwriter Will Jennings (an Oscar winner for the “Titanic” theme) collaborated with Harris on three tunes for the record, and she chose two covers: Ron Sexsmith’s “Hard Bargain” and Jay Joyce’s “Cross Yourself.”\n\n“For the most part, I’m a lone writer, but that might change,” Harris says. “I hope that anybody I’m writing with is a real professional ... and I’m counting on them to edit me. If I really feel strongly about something, though, I might stick to my guns.”\n\nNext up for Harris: a long-awaited duets album with\n\n, a friend and colleague who traces his relationship with Harris back to the 1970s. They completed a round of studio sessions earlier this year,\n\nA release date is set for the end of February.\n\n“Rodney was in my first band, the Hot Band, and I’ve been a fan since I first heard his songs,” Harris says. “We’ve been talking about this for a long time, ‘One day we’re going to do a duet record,’ and now we’re both in our 60s. You think you have all the time in the world.”"
