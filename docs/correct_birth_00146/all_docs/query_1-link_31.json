        "text": "A. According to an item in the Nov. 5, 1980, Wilmington Morning Star, the Alabama-born Harris does, in fact, have distant Port City roots. Her grandfather Armand DeRosset Harris and unnamed grandmother were native Wilming­tonians who left the city decades ago, according to the report, which ran ahead of her performance at Trask Coliseum that year.\n\nWhile her lineage hasn't changed, her prices certainly have.

Parsley Elementary School's commercial was created several years ago as a public service announcement to be aired on the school's station, said district spokeswoman Valita Quattlebaum. Former Superintendent Eddie West asked each principal to create public service announcements about their school.\n\nThe father of a former Parsley student \"was affiliated with Fox,\" Quattlebaum said, and that student asked her father to air the commercial as a public service announcement.\n\n\"He did, and it has been running ever since,\" Quattlebaum said. \"No school funds, other than the staff time to produce it, were expended.\""
