        "text": "DATE August 15, 2000 ACCOUNT NUMBER N/A\n\nTIME 12:00 Noon-1:00 PM AUDIENCE N/A\n\nNETWORK NPR\n\nPROGRAM Fresh Air\n\nInterview: Emmylou Harris discusses her 30-year career and her\n\nnew CD called \"Red Dirt Girl\"\n\nBARBARA BOGAEV, host:\n\nThis is FRESH AIR. I'm Barbara Bogaev in for Terry Gross.\n\nMy guest is Emmylou Harris. While most people think of Harris as a country\n\nsinger, her 30-year career has spanned country, folk and pop music. A\n\nnine-time Grammy Award winner, Harris is known for her distinctive\n\ninterpretations of others' music, as well as her skill as a harmonizer.\n\nHarris began her career singing harmony with the late Gram Parsons, the\n\nflamboyant member of The Byrds and The Flying Burrito Brothers. She went on\n\nto a distinguished solo career and has also sung with many country and rock\n\nstars, including Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen, Roy Orbison, Neil\n\nYoung; also Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, with whom Harris recorded two\n\nalbums, \"Trio\" and \"Trio 2.\" Her new CD, \"Red Dirt Girl,\" is Harris' first\n\nsolo album in five years since her ground-breaking CD \"Wrecking Ball\" with\n\nDaniel Lanois. It's only the second time she's written her own material. All\n\nbut one of the songs are hers. Here's the title track from the new album,\n\n\"Red Dirt Girl.\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"Red Dirt Girl\")\n\nMs. EMMYLOU HARRIS (Singer): (Singing) Me and my best friend Lily Ann(ph)\n\nand her bluetick hound dog Eddie sitting on the front porch cooling in the\n\nshade singing every song the radio played. Waiting for the hour for the sun\n\nwill go down, two red dirt girls in a red dirt town, me and Lily Ann, just\n\nacross the line and a little southeast of Meridian. She loved her brother. I\n\nremember back when he was fixing up a '49 Indian. Told her, `Little sister,\n\nI'm gonna ride the wind, up around the moon and back again.' He never got\n\nfarther than Vietnam. I was standing there with her when the telegram come\n\nfor Lily Ann. Now he's lying somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.\n\nShe said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl somewhere out there in a\n\ngreat big world. That's where I'm at. And the starlight fall on Alabama, one\n\nof these days I'm gonna swing my hammer down away from this red dirt town.\n\nI'm gonna make a joyful sound.\n\nBOGAEV: Emmylou Harris, welcome to FRESH AIR.\n\nMs. HARRIS: Well, it's a pleasure to be here. I love this show.\n\nBOGAEV: Now you first played guitar as a teen-ager. This is in the\n\n'60s--mid-'60s. Whose songs did you play? And who are you fashioning\n\nyourself after? Did you want to be Joan Baez?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, yes, we all wanted to be Joan Baez. When those records came\n\nout and that voice that was so pure and so beautiful combined with those\n\nincredibly haunting child ballads about, you know, the \"Great Silkie\" and\n\nthose--those just--Barbara Allen and those wonderful songs that have those\n\ngorgeous melodies that somehow have this primal quality. And Bob Dylan, who\n\njust made language and poetry explode for me and for, I think, everyone of my\n\ngeneration. I discovered folk blues also. But I also discovered very quickly\n\nthat I couldn't play slide guitar. So it was a great shock to me when--I\n\nthought it was a girl thing, so it was a great shock to me when I saw Bonnie\n\nRaitt at the Philadelphia Folk Festival and I went, `Wait a minute. She's\n\nnot supposed to be able to do that.' But, you know, Bukka White and Sun House\n\nand Robert Johnson and Mississippi Fred McDowell and all those--that great\n\nwealth of folk blues. I loved Ian & Sylvia, Tom Rush. I mean, there was just\n\nso much great inventive music. The real stuff, you know, the real traditional\n\nstuff, the music of the Carter Family. But then artists like Bob Dylan\n\nand--who were writing these wonderful songs and drawing on the traditions of\n\nWoody Guthrie but bringing it forward, you know, bringing it into the poetry\n\nof a new generation.\n\nBOGAEV: Well, after college you went to New York City, lived in Greenwich\n\nVillage. What was your grand plan?\n\nMs. HARRIS: To be Joan Baez. Well, I had a kind of a side trip at--into\n\nVirginia Beach. I quit school and went to Virginia Beach on the excuse that I\n\nwas going to earn money to go to a proper drama school 'cause I still was\n\nthinking that I wanted to be an actress. But most of my time was spent\n\nlearning songs and playing songs. And I divided my time in Virginia Beach\n\nbetween waitressing and singing in the clubs at night. There was quite a nice\n\nlittle folk scene there. And--but after I tried my hand at a few summer\n\nclasses--drama classes attached to Boston University where I had gotten--I'd\n\nauditioned and gotten in, I realized that my true love was music. And so I\n\nheaded to New York City where I assumed there was this flourishing folk scene,\n\nbut that's where the psychedelic movement had kind of moved in and shoved a\n\nlot of the folk scene out that I imagined was there.\n\nSo I went back to the other thing that I knew how to do, which was waiting\n\ntables. and got kind of sidetracked. I got married and I had a baby and\n\npretty much given up the idea of being an artist or being a singer. Just\n\ndidn't seem to be in the cards. But when I found that I had to make a living,\n\nI had a child to support--at that point, I found myself being a single parent.\n\nAnd though I had a lot of help from my parents, I did have to bring in some\n\nmoney. And discovered to my delight in Washington, DC, where I had moved to\n\nbe near my parents, that there was a really nice music scene there. And\n\nthat's where I met the seldom-seen, people like John Starling and John Duffey,\n\nBill and Taffy Danoff, who were Fat City at that time and went on to become\n\nThe Starland Vocal Band. And I fell in with a really nice supportive group of\n\nmusicians. And it was while I was playing those clubs--a different club every\n\nnight, six, seven nights a week, sometimes four shows a night, that I stumbled\n\ninto the path of Gram Parsons.\n\nBOGAEV: Now Gram Parsons is known from his work with The Byrds and The Flying\n\nBurrito Brothers. You credit him as your great inspiration, at least in the\n\nbeginning of your career. It took about a year since meeting Gram Parsons\n\nbefore you actually got into a studio in LA with him to record his first solo\n\nalbum, \"GP.\" What was he like in recording sessions? Did he--he's known for\n\nhis partying certainly. Did he drink?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Well, the first album, I just thought, `I can't believe that\n\nthis is how people make records.' It seemed so disorganized. Now he had a\n\nvery professional group of musicians, which a lot of them went on to become my\n\nhot band and that I recorded with, Glen D. Havain and James Burton. He had\n\nRonnie Tutt there on drums. Herb Peterson was there. And Al Perkins(ph) on\n\npedal steele. But Gram was drinking and it seemed very disorganized. Barry\n\nTashian was there and I sort of gleaned on to Barry. Barry seemed to be a\n\nlittle more together. And I just didn't know what was going on.\n\nBut in spite of it all, you couldn't help but really like Gram. He was so\n\ngenerous and he was funny and he just--he was somebody that you just wanted to\n\ntake care of. You just knew that he was a good old boy; you know, he was just\n\na good soul. And--but the whole experience--I mean, I left there thinking,\n\n`Well, I can't believe that there's gonna be a record.' But I was very\n\nsurprised when I heard the record and I thought it was great. And I got the\n\ncall to go on tour. And during the course of putting together that tour and\n\nactually touring, Gram seemed to really gather strength and really seemed to\n\nbe pulling himself together. And he was really making a conscious effort to\n\nstop drinking and was really getting whole and strong. And we were doing so\n\nmuch singing and we were so excited about the prospect of the next record. I\n\nguess that's why his death shocked me because it seemed like he was out of the\n\nwoods. You know, I was very naive about those things.\n\nBOGAEV: How did singing with Gram Parsons on that tour, and also on his two\n\nrecords, influence your development of your own voice, your own style?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, it had everything to do with my development as a singer. I\n\nmean, I had a pretty voice. I sang a lot of different types of songs\n\nadequately and maybe sometimes well. But there was something about, first of\n\nall, singing harmony, which required a certain discipline. And second of all,\n\nsinging country music, which has an inherent restraint and economy of emotion\n\nin the singing and in the phrasing. And coupled with the fact that my voice\n\nis not a traditional-sounding country voice like Loretta Lynn or Tammy Wynette\n\nor even a more contemporary singer like, let's say, Tanya Tucker. It, I\n\nthink, gave it a different sound. It occupied--it found its own place. It\n\nfound its--my voice found its own voice, its own footing. And it kind of\n\nhappened by osmosis. It wasn't a conscious thing.\n\nBOGAEV: Emmylou Harris is my guest. Her career has spanned country, folk,\n\npop, alternative music. She's the winner of nine Grammys. Her new album is\n\n\"Red Dirt Girl.\" Let's take a break and then we'll talk some more. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOGAEV: We're back with Emmylou Harris. Her new album is \"Red Dirt Girl.\"\n\nIt's her first solo album in five years. She wrote all but one of the songs\n\non the new album. I'd like to listen to one of the most well-known songs of\n\nthe songs that you've collaborated on with Gram Parsons, and that's \"Love\n\nHurts.\" It's from his second--his last solo album, \"Grievous Angel.\" Before\n\nwe play it, could you talk about a little. Is it a song that you did a lot of\n\nwork on while you were with him on the road?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, yeah. That was a song that I guess we started singing\n\neither on the bus or in a dressing room, or at some point, because we had\n\nalready recorded the first album. And after we got on the road, that was one\n\nwe really started singing stuff all the time, and Gram was an encyclopedia of\n\nsongs. He knew every Everly Brothers song ever recorded and some very obscure\n\nones. And I think \"Love Hurts\" had never been a single, it was probably a B\n\nside. And so that song very quickly found its way into our show, even though\n\nwe had not recorded it, because we only had it--when we first started out on\n\nthe tour, we had so few songs that when we finally got an encore we had to go\n\nback and start singing the set again. So we actually had a rehearsal and we\n\nhad to work on some more songs. And \"Love Hurts\" just became a real peak of\n\nthe show. So the song was sort of fully formed by the time we got into the\n\nstudio, and it was just a matter of doing, you know, singing it on--we had two\n\nmicrophones right together, and we sang--which is the way we did--we sang on\n\nstage. And we just sang it as the track went down just like we would do it,\n\nyou know, on stage.\n\nBOGAEV: Let's listen. This is Gram Parsons with my guest, Emmylou Harris.\n\nThe song is \"Love Hurts\" from Gram Parsons' 1973 album, \"Grievous Angel.\"\n\n(Soundbite of Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris performing \"Love Hurts\")\n\nMr. PARSONS: (In unison with Emmylou) Love hurts. Love scars. Love wounds\n\nand mars any heart not tough nor strong enough to take a lot of pain, take a\n\nlot of pain. Love is like a cloud; holds a lot of rain. Love hurts. Ooh,\n\nlove hurts.\n\nBOGAEV: That was Gram Parsons' \"Love Hurts,\" with my guest Emmylou Harris,\n\nfrom the 1973 recording \"Grievous Angel.\" Gram Parsons died just about a\n\nmonth after this album was recorded. His death was attributed to an overdose\n\nfrom a whole mix of drugs and alcohol. You had planned to put a band together\n\nwith Gram and go on the road again. And I imagine suddenly without this huge\n\nsupporter and presence in your life, how did you see yourself? Did you see\n\nyourself as a solo musician after Parsons died?\n\nMs. HARRIS: No, I didn't. I had just--I thought, `I have just got this\n\ngreat job,' you know, I want to sing with Gram. I loved the non-pressure of\n\nbeing up there as, you know, an acoustic guitar player and harmony singer,\n\noccasionally doing a solo song because Gram was very, very generous. You\n\nknow, and he was always polishing everybody else's dime, you know, and he\n\nwanted everybody to shine. And so it was kind of perfect. And I also still\n\nconsidered myself an apprentice. I felt I had so much to learn from him, and\n\nfrom the music that we were doing that I'd only recently sort of found my\n\nvoice, and I still had a long way to go. So, of course, it was very\n\ndevastating. And I just did not know what to do.\n\nAnd I was thinking, `Well, I'm just going to go ahead and move to Los\n\nAngeles,' without any plans at all. I really didn't know what I was going to\n\ndo. And a very good friend of mine, John Starling, just set me down and he\n\nsaid, `Listen,' he said, `You need to stay in Washington.' He said, `You have\n\nfriends here, you have family here. And you need to work on your music here\n\nand figure out who you are and what you're going to do.' Because I knew that\n\nI couldn't go back to being a folk singer, I had become, you know, completely\n\nentranced with the drummer. You know, before that as a folk singer I thought\n\nthe drummer was the Antichrist, you know, and you just didn't work with the\n\ndrummer if you were a folk singer. And I had to learn how to front a band.\n\nAnd so I just pulled a band together from the good local musicians there in\n\nWashington.\n\nAnother thing that John had said to me was, `You have a relationship with the\n\nclubs in this town. And so, you have an audience, and people know you here as\n\na local artist.' So I went back to the clubs that I had played as a folk\n\nsinger. I went back with a small country band, I had a drummer, bass player,\n\npedal steele player, electric guitar player and myself, and we called\n\nourselves Angel Band after the Stanley Brothers song. You know, we just\n\nstarted playing. And I got a record deal with Reprise and we went in and made\n\nthe first record.\n\nBOGAEV: I think a lot of people say that their favorite Emmylou Harris album\n\nis \"Blue Kentucky Girl.\" Apparently it wasn't a big hit with your record\n\ncompany when you decided to do it. They didn't know what to do with it. What\n\nwas their problem?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Well, it was very straight-forward country, comparatively. All\n\nthe other albums up to that point had been very eclectic. There had been\n\ncountry music, very traditional country music on it, but done with a slight\n\ntwist. You know, like \"Hello, Stranger\" being a very traditional part of\n\nCarter Family song but done with drums and bass, mandolin and electric guitar.\n\nThen \"If I Could Only Win Your Love,\" done very traditionally. But then you\n\nhad, you know, The Beatles songs, like \"For No One,\" \"Here, There, and\n\nEverywhere,\" a Chuck Berry cover. Songs by new writers that people haven't\n\nheard of before like Rodney Crowell, so it was very eclectic.\n\nAnd there was this sort of truth going around, sort of a fact--people\n\naccepting the fact that, `Well, sure, she's crossover country, but she's not\n\nreally country because she doesn't do pure country.' And I kind of resented\n\nthat, but I knew they were right, that there was a possibility. So I did\n\n\"Blue Kentucky Girl\" for a couple of reasons. I think first, for those\n\nreasons I wanted to prove to myself that I could make a record that, in the\n\nwords of Waylon Jennings, couldn't go pop with a mouthful of fire crackers.\n\nAnd also because I had been spending a lot of time with Ricky Skaggs, who had\n\njust joined my band, and also Sharon and Cheryl White(ph), who were doing some\n\ntouring with me. So a lot of the music we were making on the back of the bus\n\nand hanging around in dressing rooms was more and more kind of traditional,\n\nless left field, as it were. Because that was sort of what was happening\n\nmusically, so it seemed like, well, that's the record that we should do. But\n\nit was also to make a point that we were going to take more of the traditional\n\ncountry elements and make an album that was perhaps a little purer and more\n\ntruer to form than the other previous four albums.\n\nBOGAEV: Emmylou Harris' new CD is \"Red Dirt Girl.\" She'll be back in the\n\nsecond half of our show. Let's listen to a song from her 1979 recording \"Blue\n\nKentucky Girl.\" This is \"Sorrow in the Wind.\" I'm Barbara Bogaev and this is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of Emmylou Harris performing \"Sorrow in the Wind\")\n\nMs. HARRIS: (Singing) I hear the soft wind sighing in every bush and tree.\n\nThe sound of my heart crying when you are far from me. When we're apart, my\n\ndarling, there's sorrow in the wind. When we're apart, my darling, sweet\n\nsorrow in the wind. You leave me in the morning.\n\n(Credits given)\n\nBOGAEV: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Barbara Bogaev.\n\nLet's continue now with our interview with Emmylou Harris. Harris is a\n\nnine-time Grammy Award-winning musician who's known for interpretations of\n\ncountry, bluegrass, folk and pop music. She's credited with helping to make\n\ncountry music hip. In over 30 years' recording and touring, Harris has sung\n\nwith major stars in country and rock, including Gram Parsons, Bob Dylan, Neil\n\nYoung, the McGarrigle Sisters, Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt.\n\nHer new album, \"Red Dirt Girl,\" is her first solo recording in five years.\n\nIt's inspired in part by her CD, \"Wrecking Ball,\" Harris' foray into\n\ncontemporary folk.\n\n\"Wrecking Ball,\" which came out in 1995 and was produced by Daniel Lanois\n\ndidn't really sound like anything else you'd done before. Daniel Lanois is\n\nknown for having produced Peter Gabriel and U2, among other bands, and he has\n\na way of creating an eerie, Gothic quality to the work that he writes and\n\nproduces. What was it like to work with him? What was your process, bringing\n\nthat album, \"Wrecking Ball,\" together?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Well, the thing is, I was such a fan of his work. Actually, I\n\nknow that he had done that work with those people, and it was wonderful, but\n\nthe thing that really made me sit up and take notice was his own solo record,\n\n\"Acadie,\" the first one, and then the album he did with Dylan, the first album\n\nhe did with Dylan, \"Oh, Mercy,\" which I discovered around the same time, and\n\nyou're right about the quality he brings to a lot of his work, but there's\n\nsomething very close to the bone and traditional, and yet very spooky about\n\nthose two records, his solo record and \"Oh, Mercy.\"\n\nAnd I didn't find it that much a stretch of things that I had done in the\n\npast, or wanted to do, because I love that left-field sound. I love the\n\ncombination of real acoustic sounds and real raw sounds with all the things\n\nthat you can do technologically with amps, guitar sounds and things like that.\n\nSo I was intrigued with what he could do with the different, unusual songs I\n\nmight come up with, and my voice.\n\nBOGAEV: Let's play a cut from \"Wrecking Ball.\" Emmylou, do you have a song\n\nthat you like most from the album?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, gosh--well, I like everything on there, but...\n\nBOGAEV: I have to say I love the Daniel Lanois songs, \"Where Will I Be\" and\n\nalso...\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, well, let's do \"Where Will I Be,\" because maybe we need\n\nsomething a little up-tempo. It's kind of hard for me to find those up-tempo\n\nsongs.\n\nBOGAEV: Good. Let's play \"Where Will I Be.\" This is Emmylou Harris, from\n\nher 1995 album, \"Wrecking Ball.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Where Will I Be\")\n\nMs. HARRIS: (Singing) Oh, the streets are cracked and there's glass\n\neverywhere and a baby stares out with motherless eyes under long gone beauty\n\non fields of war trapped in lament to the poet's core. Oh where, oh where\n\nwill I be? Oh where, oh when that trumpet sounds?\n\nBOGAEV: My guest, Emmylou Harris, singing \"Where Will I Be\" from her album,\n\n\"Wrecking Ball.\"\n\nI really love your voice in this album. It sounds as if you're less carefully\n\narticulating the lyrics, and it gives it this--for me, at least, this more\n\ndreamlike and stream of consciousness sound. Did working with Daniel Lanois\n\ninfluence how you sang on this album?\n\nMs. HARRIS: I think it was the process of it, so, yes. I mean, I'd been\n\nmoving toward live vocals, and Daniel was very much into that. In fact, I\n\nfound out after the fact that he and Malcolm Burn had made the decision that\n\nwhatever take we ended up with was going to be determined by the live vocal.\n\nIf there was a really good live vocal, then that was going to be the take,\n\nwarts and all, which I was really glad I didn't know about that, because\n\nbasically all I did was sit there in the studio, where everybody was in the\n\nroom--there was very little separation--and it was a small band of people, and\n\nI just sang, and I love to sing songs a lot. I'm very happy to do 20, 30\n\ntakes of a song if I have to. I like to sing it with the band, as learning\n\nit. The more I sing it, the more comfortable I feel with it. I don't worry\n\nabout peaking, if you know what I mean.\n\nBOGAEV: Sure.\n\nMs. HARRIS: So what we got was live vocals with all the molecules and the\n\nsounds swirling around in the room, bleeding into the microphone, but in a\n\nvery professional way. I mean, there was method to this madness, you know.\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing. But I think that that probably added a lot\n\nto what you're talking about, that comes across on this record.\n\nBOGAEV: Well, you live in Nashville now. Do you listen to country radio?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Well, actually, I don't. I don't listen to country radio. The\n\nfew times I'm someplace where it's on, or, you know, the country--the video\n\nstation's on, I just--I find it to be a bit of a one-note kind of a thing. I\n\ncan't really tell the difference between one singer and the next, one song and\n\nthe next, one bit of production and the next, and you know, it takes a lot for\n\nmy attention to be drawn in by an artist or a piece of music, I will admit\n\nthat. But I don't think I'm wrong in saying that it seems to me that we're\n\ndealing with a whole lot of Big Macs out there--not a whole lot of choice.\n\nBOGAEV: I'd like to ask you about singing with other people. You do duets\n\nwith just--the list is too long to mention--but just greats of folk and rock\n\nand country. You've put out two albums with Dolly Parton and Linda Rondstadt.\n\nYou've also done a duets album that features Roy Orbison, George Jones, Neil\n\nYoung. You've sung with Bob Dylan. Does each artist have idiosyncrasies that\n\nyou have to adapt to, singing harmony with them?\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, yes. That's what makes it work. I mean, the fact that every\n\nartist is unique, not only in the way they phrase, which of course is a big\n\npart of singing with them. It's like dancing with somebody--not that I can\n\ndance with somebody, but I imagine that that's what it must be like, because\n\nyou have to follow them, but you also have to be completely comfortable and be\n\nyourself. And the way they pronounce certain words, so that--you know, the\n\nnote has to buzz with them. But for the most part, if you think about those\n\nthings, well, for me, I can't think when I sing. I just have to jump in and\n\njust hope that I'm going to get it.\n\nBOGAEV: Emmylou Harris, it's been such a pleasure talking with you on FRESH\n\nAIR. Thank you.\n\nMs. HARRIS: Oh, well, thank you. I really enjoyed it.\n\nBOGAEV: Emmylou Harris. Her new CD is \"Red Dirt Girl.\" She's currently on\n\nan international tour.\n\nHere's \"The Pain of Loving You,\" by Emmylou Harris, singing with Dolly Parton\n\nand Linda Ronstadt.\n\n(Soundbite of \"The Pain of Loving You\")\n\nMs. HARRIS, Ms. DOLLY PARTON and Ms. LINDA RONSTADT: (Singing) Oh, the pain\n\nof loving you. Oh, the misery I go through, never knowing what to do. Oh,\n\nthe pain of loving you.\n\nMs. HARRIS: You just can't stand to see me happy. Seem to hurt me all you\n\ncan.\n\nMs. HARRIS and Ms. PARTON: Still I go on loving you. But I never understand.\n\nMs. HARRIS, Ms. PARTON and Ms. RONSTADT: Oh the pain...\n\nBOGAEV: Coming up, writing horror for literature lovers. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Peter Straub, horror writer, discusses his work\n\nBARBARA BOGAEV, host:\n\nPeter Straub has been called `the thinking man's Stephen King.' He's known\n\nfor his horror novels, but in his 14 books, he's also wandered into the\n\nmystery, suspense, fantasy, Gothic and science fiction genres. Most of these\n\nliterary styles are represented in Straub's new collection of stories, \"Magic\n\nTerror.\" His other books include \"Mr. X,\" \"Ghost Story,\" the \"Hellfire Club\"\n\nand \"The Talisman,\" which he collaborated on with Stephen King in 1984. He\n\nand King are currently working on a sequel.\n\nStraub says that he became a connoisseur of fear when he was seven and was hit\n\nby a car while crossing the street. His long convalescence introduced him to\n\nwhat he calls fear's older brothers, terror and panic, and the rest of the\n\nfamily--nightmare, rage, depression and shame, all of which he explores in his\n\nfiction. Straub has said that horror is an essential, crucial part of human\n\nexistence, with its own considerable beauty. I asked him if writing horror is\n\nreally writing about morality, and if that's what he finds fulfilling in it.\n\nMr. PETER STRAUB (Author): Yes. I would say it is what I find fulfilling\n\nbecause it also kind of shades off into other moral areas, which mainly have\n\nto do with awareness, specifically, the awareness of what is generally\n\nrejected or denied. Someone in our society has to speak of what is generally\n\nconsidered unacceptable, if not unspeakable, and it is sort of a privilege to\n\nbe given that role. What I'm talking about are not merely moments of physical\n\ndistress, but of their emotional consequences. That is emotions like grief\n\nand terror, loss, sorrow, pain. Stuff like that, which is of immense human\n\nconsequence, is really what is the good horror writers' meat and drink. If\n\nyou deal simply with sensation then you're sort of cheating; you're cheating\n\nboth the subject and yourself.\n\nBOGAEV: As a child, you knew about scary stuff. You were in a serious car\n\naccident when you were--What was it? Seven?\n\nMr. STRAUB: I was seven, that's right. Alas, alas.\n\nBOGAEV: What happened?\n\nMr. STRAUB: Well, I was a little boy trying to cross the street holding an\n\nice cream cone. And I was far too concentrated on the ice cream cone\n\nthen--you know, far more so than I should have been. And I never noticed the\n\ncar bearing down on me until I glanced over my shoulder--or I glanced to my\n\nside, which I should have done before I stepped off the curb. And I saw this\n\ncar about 15 feet away from me, and I knew that there was no way I was going\n\nto get out of the way. Besides I experienced that well-known response of\n\npeople in abrupt peril; that of paralysis, so I literally was incapable of\n\nmoving. And I just saw this thing march toward me as in a series of frames;\n\ncloser, two feet closer, another foot closer, another foot closer, until\n\nfinally the curtain mercifully descends.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was in a hospital and I was in terrible pain. Life had\n\ntaken a turn for the worse, for sure. And that was a long experience. I went\n\nthrough what everybody goes through when something like that happens. I had\n\noperations, hospitalizations, further operations. And people telling me over\n\nand over, `Put this behind you, Peter. Forget about it.' Unfortunately, I\n\ndid manage to put it behind me and forget about it. And consequently, I had a\n\ntropism toward what other people saw as unacceptable. That is, at heart, I\n\nwanted to represent this extremely powerful experience, which had happened to\n\nme, but I had to transform it and put it into metaphorical terms. Hence, the\n\nbirth of a horror writer.\n\nBOGAEV: Well, before you put it behind you, did you have nightmares about\n\nwhat had happened? And what were they about?\n\nMr. STRAUB: Well, I had lots and lots of grotesque nightmares. And I think\n\nthey probably increased after I persuaded myself that I didn't have to\n\nremember what had happened to me, because that's what happens, you know. What\n\ndo they call that? The return of the repressed.\n\nBOGAEV: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. STRAUB: It's the return of the vicious, and the angry and the, you know,\n\nthe irrepressible, really. I had these dreams, which represented the kind of\n\nre-enactment of what had happened to me in symbolic terms. And that kind of\n\nexperience didn't stop happening to me until I had at last figured it out and\n\ngone back and faced, you know, this event, which I'd rather devalued and\n\ndowngraded. And which, you know, should be a really fully functioning, at\n\nleast, more or less, attached human being, I had to come to terms with.\n\nBOGAEV: Around this time, after you were recovering from the car accident,\n\nyou started to stutter. Did that plague you as a kid?\n\nMr. STRAUB: Oh, it was terrible. Here I was, this very verbose, garrulous,\n\nnon-stop talker, and all of a sudden, one day, I stood up in class, and I had\n\nto read a bit from the page of a textbook, at which I was really good, let me\n\ntell you. I was like--I don't know, I was like a professional reader or\n\nsomething, and so it was this great opportunity to show off. And I came to\n\nthe word Pittsburgh, and the word Pittsburgh refused to emerge. It just sat\n\nthere like a stone on my tongue, and that plagued me ever since. My stutter\n\nstill persists, but in a much, much smaller form. It mainly surfaces when I'm\n\ndealing with telephone operators or situations like that. It just, more or\n\nless, faded with age, but it was a terrible burden.\n\nBOGAEV: Peter, you didn't start out as a horror writer. You first wrote some\n\npoetry; wrote a novel, \"Marriages,\" about an adulterous affair. How did you\n\ndiscover horror?\n\nMr. STRAUB: I first became acquainted with horror when I was about 13 years\n\nold with the purchase of a book called--a modern library giant, called \"Great\n\nTales of Terror & the Supernatural.\" I was very attached to that book, and I\n\nhauled it around with me wherever I went for a couple of months, and I\n\neventually read all the stories in it. It's a huge, huge book. Then that\n\nsort of went away.\n\nI began reading H.P. Lovecraft and people like that in the early '70s, when\n\nmy wife and I were living in Dublin and London, and I met a friend named Tom\n\nTessier(ph), who was very well-versed in that sort of writing. And he\n\nencouraged me to begin reading it, and I did it and I liked it quite a bit.\n\nRemember, this was the time when \"The Exorcist\" had just come out, when\n\n\"Rosemary's Baby\" had just made a big splash and as had two novels by a former\n\nactor named Tom Tran. They were all horror novels, and they all did very,\n\nvery well. It was as though horror had, for some reason or other, experienced\n\na kind of rebirth.\n\nI wrote that first novel, \"Marriages,\" which was not very good at all. I sort\n\nof wallowed for a little while and thrashed about, unable to just, you know,\n\ndecide what to do. Then I decided to try to add my own little paper boat to\n\nthe, you know, horror stream, and the second I started--and it was with a book\n\ncalled \"Julia\"--really, almost the instant I started, in the first sentence I\n\nmean, I felt at home. I knew right away that that book was going to work.\n\nThis is a very unusual experience for a young writer. And, anyhow, it did it\n\nwork, and it worked in the best way; that is, that pieces of crucial\n\ninformation appeared to me just at the moment when they were needed. So the\n\nwhole thing fell together and sort of shaped itself. I knew it was\n\npublishable, and I knew it was going to do reasonably well, and thank goodness\n\nit was published and it did do reasonably well.\n\nBOGAEV: So even though horror was a new branch of literature, it was just\n\ndawning on the American consciousness with \"The Exorcist\" and \"Rosemary's\n\nBaby,\" it didn't have a stigma?\n\nMr. STRAUB: Oh, it did, of course, have a stigma. It was just my good luck\n\nto enter a field that was seen as low rent and sort of despicable because, in\n\nthat field, where my strengths really could flourish, I could sort of put on\n\nmuscle and learn my business unbothered. No critics were going to pay a lot\n\nof attention to me. The only people who were going to pay attention were\n\nreaders, and readers bought those books in great numbers and appreciated what\n\nI was doing and what I was trying to do. It gave me a chance to sort of\n\nflourish unobserved and, also, to have enough time to explore the dignity that\n\nactually existed in this field, which was considered so low rent.\n\nBOGAEV: Peter Straub is my guest. He's best known as a horror writer. His\n\nnovels include \"Ghost Story,\" the \"Hellfire Club,\" \"Mr. X\" and \"The\n\nTalisman,\" which he collaborated on with Stephen King. His new book, \"Magic\n\nTerror,\" is a collection of short stories.\n\nPeter, we're going to take a short break, and then we'll talk some more.\n\nMr. STRAUB: OK.\n\nBOGAEV: This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nBOGAEV: We're back with horror writer Peter Straub. His new collection of\n\nshort stories is \"Magic Terror.\"\n\nI'd like you to read a passage from another one of your books, \"Mr. X,\" which\n\nit's about a boy, who turns into a man, named Ned Dunstan, and he's haunted by\n\nvisions of horrors committed by something or a person he calls Mr. X. Ned\n\nDunstan seems to lead a kind of double life or be pursued by a kind of\n\ndoppelganger.\n\nMr. STRAUB: Right.\n\nBOGAEV: And he gradually finds out that Mr. X is part of his past. I'd like\n\nyou to read this passage. Maybe you could set it up for us.\n\nMr. STRAUB: Sure. This is part of memoirs of the villain, Mr. X, who's\n\nrecounting a very, very exciting event that happened to him in his last year\n\nat military school, where he had a perfectly good time. He has been accused\n\nof being mentally disturbed by Captain Squadron(ph) at the school, and Captain\n\nSquadron, with fatal consequences, wants to take his sacred book from--the\n\nsacred book is the \"Dunwich Horror\" by H.P. Lovecraft. Under the threat of\n\nthis loss, Mr. X experiences an odd surge of superpsychic ability, as\n\nfollows.\n\n(Reading) `I had no idea of what I was going to do. I certainly had no idea\n\nof what I was going to do to Captain Squadron. In fact, I still don't really\n\nknow how I did it, since duplication of the feat has resisted me ever since.\n\nI don't suppose any of those mothers ever picked up a car a second time\n\neither. I touched the book, and as if I had done this kind of thing a hundred\n\ntimes before, felt myself flow into his mind and voicelessly command its\n\nsurrender. With the book safely returned to my hands, I used the same\n\ninstinctive power to impel him toward the center of the room. The interior of\n\nSquadron's mind reported a sensation akin to that of being blown backward by a\n\ngreat wind.\n\nCaptain Squadron remained incapable of speech as I withdrew from his mind. An\n\nenormous battery deep within me thrummed into life. At that moment, a certain\n\ncrucial revelation that was to shape all the rest of my life came to me. I\n\nsay came to me, meaning that it entered me like a clear, silver stream and\n\ngave momentary form to the uproar. Once again, I had heard the voice from\n\nJohnson's woods(ph).\n\nCaptain Squadron stood in the center of my room, perhaps two yards away from\n\nme. I glided toward him, as if across an icy pond on a pair of figure skates.\n\nI don't think I touched him. I recall that almost impersonal sensation of\n\nemptying that accompanies evacuation. My joints suffered the bone-deep ache\n\nassociated with arthritis. My head seemed to have been split by an ax. Maybe\n\nthe mommies who hoist those automobiles off their babies feel the same way. I\n\ndon't know. What I do know is that Captain Squadron had vanished from the\n\nroom. A greenish puddle, about four inches in diameter, lay on the floor, and\n\na wet, deathly stink hung in the air.\n\nI overcame my agonies long enough to wipe up the captain's remains with a\n\ntowel, wash it off in the sink and fell on the cot to dwell on my revelation.'\n\nBOGAEV: Now an interesting thing about Mr. X: He believes the horror fiction\n\nhe's read.\n\nMr. STRAUB: Yes.\n\nBOGAEV: He's read this H.P. Lovecraft. He thinks those books aren't fiction,\n\nand that comes...\n\nMr. STRAUB: He thinks it's real.\n\nBOGAEV: ...up with another one of your villains, Dick Dart, in the \"Hellfire\n\nClub.\" And he's another murdering psychopath, who's a huge devotee of a\n\nchildren's fantasy novel.\n\nMr. STRAUB: That's right.\n\nBOGAEV: This is a book you made up. This isn't a real book.\n\nMr. STRAUB: That's right.\n\nBOGAEV: But it made me wonder whether you wonder about your fans or fans in\n\ngeneral of horror fiction. If anyone needs something to hook their insanity\n\non or their obsessiveness, I would think horror fiction would make an easy\n\ntarget.\n\nMr. STRAUB: Well, it could be. But you know what is the favorite book of all\n\nAmerican assassins, the one they're always carrying? One and all, they're all\n\ncarrying \"Catcher in the Rye.\" For some reason, that novel speaks to\n\npsychopaths like none other. And, of course, it's a very sweet, tender,\n\nlittle object. It is possible, of course, to imagine zanies fastening on a\n\nfantasy novel due to its kind of world-altering or world-evading qualities.\n\nAnd it was just sort of fun for me to imagine a set of people who have so\n\nadopted a fantasy novel called \"Night Journey\" that they virtually re-created\n\nit and went around using the names of the characters, re-created the\n\nenvironments of the novel in their own apartments and sort of disappeared into\n\nthe world created in that book.\n\nI'm not sure why this idea appealed to me. It's disturbing and funny. Maybe\n\nthat's why. It sounds as though I'm speaking of the dangers of imagination,\n\nbut I'm about the last person in the world who would ever, you know, allude to\n\nthe dangers of imagination because I think imagination is a primally creative,\n\nalmost sacred force.\n\nBOGAEV: Peter Straub, I want to thank you very much for talking with me\n\ntoday.\n\nMr. STRAUB: Thank you, Barbara. It was great fun.\n\nBOGAEV: Peter Straub's new book is \"Magic Terror.\"\n\n(Soundbite of music; credits)\n\nBOGAEV: For Terry Gross, I'm Barbara Bogaev.\n\n(Soundbite of music; credits)"
