        "meta_description": "In a distinguished folk/country rock music career that has spanned over 45 years, American singer/songwriter Emmylou Harris has had the opportunity to work with many legends in the music industry, including John Denver, Linda Ronstadt, Bob Dylan and Neil Young. Harris was born in 1947 in Birmingham, Alabama. After spending several years trying to position herself in the industry, Harris released a debut album, Gliding Bird, for Jubilee Records in 1969. When the album did not chart, Harris went looking for a new label. In 1974, she signed with Reprise records and went into the studio. In February of 1975, she released her second album entitled Pieces of the Sky. This time, the results were surprisingly good as the album peaked at #7 on the US Billboard Country Albums Chart. Later that same year, she came right back and released the album that would make her a star. Elite Hotel rose to #1 on the Country Chart and #25 on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart. It also gave Harris her first of many number one country singles, a song called \"Together Again\". Over her career, Harris has released a total of 40 albums, of which two others, Luxury Liner (1977) and Trio with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt (1987), would hit the #1 spot. In all, she also had seven #1 singles on the Country Chart. Harris has won 13 Grammy Awards over the years, including Best Female Country Vocal Performance on four different occasions (1976, 1979, 1984 and 2005). She also picked up four Country Music Association Awards, including the prestigious Album of the Year in 2001 with O Brother, Where Art Thou?. Over the years, Harris has maintained her presence as a recording artist.",
