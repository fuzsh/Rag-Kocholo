        "text": "Emmylou Harris, due in town for Pops concerts with the Oklahoma Symphony Orchestra at 8:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, was hard at work on a new album this week at her home studio in Brentwood, Tenn. Her 1986 album, Thirteen, was a modest success. Harris said she is going to \"keep mum\" on the new material being readied for No. 14.\n\nMeanwhile, she's busy choosing a symphony program. Such work is new for Harris who calls her Oklahoma City symphony engagements \"an experiment.\"\n\n\"This is my first one,\" she said. \"When I was approached with the idea of a Pops concert, I was intrigued by the idea. There are a lot of songs in my repertoire that will really be enhanced by this kind of program.\n\n\"It seemed like a good idea, because I can do songs I don't normally perform. Some of these songs will be familiar, and some will be my favorites that don't necessarily work in the usual band format,\" she said.\n\nThe results of this \"experiment\" may or may not lead to future Pops-style shows in her career.\n\n\"I've got dates this month, next month and the following months on the weekends just to test the waters,\" she said. \"If I feel I do a good job, and if the audience is responsive, I'll probably do more dates. But I'll never give up my band and touring.\n\n\"It would be nice to do both,\" she said. \"This is a way to do songs I would like to include on my performing repertoire. With some songs, the band format isn't necessarily the (proper) place.\n\n\"This will be a way to perform songs I've only done on record,\" she said. \"We'll do songs I haven't done in a long time like \"Sorrow in the Wind.' \"On the Radio' we don't do very much, but I feel we have a really wonderful arrangement of that. There are a couple of Beatles' songs I haven't done for a long time: \"For No One' and \"Here, There and Everywhere.' \" Harris' version of \"Here, There and Everywhere\" can be found on her second album, Elite Hotel, from 1976. Elite Hotel netted three No. 1 hits: Buck Owens' \"Together Again,\" along with \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"One of These Days.\"\n\nHarris said that pacing her new orchestra show is a pleasant problem with advantages and drawbacks.\n\n\"We don't do \"Luxury Liner,' \" Harris said, referring to the title track to her rollicking third album.\n\n\"We don't do the rowdy ones that require lots of blistering electric guitar. We don't do real fast, up-tempo songs. There were actually a lot of songs I felt would work, but the hardest part in selecting a symphony program was cutting it down to, like, an hour program that I would enjoy and the audience would enjoy.\n\n\"We started with a list of quite a few tunes and cut it down and cut it down,\" she said. \"We didn't want to take on more than we could handle we wanted to concentrate our efforts on the songs we felt would really work.\n\n\"Of course, this is something that I really don't know I depended a lot on Don Johnson, my musical director. He's done this kind of work before it's completely new to me.\n\n\"He helps me pick the songs, writes the charts, conducts the orchestra, plays piano and sings backup,\" she said of Johnson, an Oklahoma City resident.\n\n\"He's been one of my background singers for about eight years now, so he's really familiar with the material. He's very capable,\" she said.\n\n\"This program is completely without my band I'm not taking my band and putting strings on top of them. That didn't interest me at all. I feel my band is a complete unit that doesn't need strings. Most of my records don't even have strings.\n\n\"This is an experiment for me. If I went to a symphony program, I wouldn't be expecting honky-tonk music. I wouldn't be expecting a lot of up-tempo things, although we actually have a few numbers like \"Mr. Sandman' and \"How High the Moon' and a few nice medium-tempo numbers that are going to work, I think. Don's got some great orchestral ideas for those,\" she said.\n\n\"Pacing the symphonic show, I just say, \"I'd like this song following this song.' Actually, it's a delight, because I can put more of the slower songs back-to-back, because it's that kind of a program, where you're depending on the beautiful sounds of the orchestra.\n\n\"Being able to hear the vocals more, I'm having a couple of girls (Pam Rose and Mary Anne Kennedy) from the \"Ballad of Sally Rose\" tour come in and sing. That's going to be delightful to work with them again. 'Cause they're wonderful.\"\n\nThe 39-year old singer-guitarist was born in Alabama and spent most of the '70s turning rock audiences on to the \"emotional honesty\" of country music.\n\nHer Thirteen album is a follow-up to 1985's critically acclaimed Ballad of Sally Rose, which helped Harris net a Grammy nomination for best female country vocalist in 1985.\n\nFor ticket information: 23-MUSIC.
