        "text": "FLORENCE | Alabama has left its distinctive mark on every style of popular music, from country, jazz and gospel to blues, soul and rock 'n' roll.\n\nEvery other year, the Alabama Music Hall of Fame celebrates the state's/smusic heritage with a star-studded induction banquet and awards show. This year's black-tie affair features performances by legendary artists, ranging from rhythm-and-blues singer Clarence Carter to country-folk favorite Emmylou Harris.\n\n\"It's always an unbelievable show,\" said Muscle Shoals producer and musician Jimmy Johnson, who serves as chairman of the hall of fame's board of directors. \"This state has produced some of the finest musical talent in the world. These banquets prove that over and over again.\"\n\nWhen the curtain rises Saturday evening, Alabama-born music achievers like soul singer Eddie Floyd, the gospel group 4Him and pop artist Pat Upton will be backed by an illustrious band. The stage of the Arthur Outlaw Convention and Visitors Center will be filled with 18 top session players from/sthe recording industries of Muscle Shoals and Nashville.\n\n\"It's always a great experience,\" said Shoals guitarist Kelvin Holly, who tours with rock ën' roll legend Little Richard. \"The cool thing is that you get to play all kinds of music, which is always a good thing. You may play blues one minute and rock the next. It's all in there.\"\n\nSaxophonist Charles Rose, a member of the famed Muscle Shoals Horns and co-founder of the Muscle Shoals Soul Revue, directs the hall of fame's house band and writes arrangements for all of the evening's songs.\n\n\"As soon as I find out what the music is and what the keys are, I get tapes of the tunes and write rhythm charts and horn charts,\" Rose said. He has worked with artists from Elton John and John Lennon to Waylon Jennings and Lyle Lovett. \"I teach the music to the band, and then we rehearse with the artists once we're there.\"\n\nAlthough the hall of fame museum is based in Tuscumbia, the biennial banquets (which began in 1985) take place in major cities around the state. Previous banquets have been staged in Birmingham (ë85, ë87, ë89 and ë91), Huntsville (ë93, ë95, ë97 and ë99) and Mobile (ë01).\n\nFor this year's festivities, Rose and his band will back up Muscle Shoals mainstay Carter on his classic rhythm-and-blues hits \"Slip Away,\" \"Patches\" and \"Dr. C.C.\" as well as Floyd on his own ë60s soul standards, \"Knock on Wood,\" \"634-5789\" and \"I Never Found a Girl.\"\n\n\"I enjoy all of it, but that's what I get into the most the R&B stuff,\" Holly said. \"That's just my thing.\"\n\nMany of the musicians in the hall of fame's live band have already worked with the featured artists in a studio setting. Some of them played on the entertainers' biggest hits.\n\n\"The show gives people a chance to relive a lot of memories together,\" Lewey said. \"For the audience, it's a chance to see us working with a variety of different artists and different kinds of music. In that respect, it's representative of what we do in the studio.\"\n\nThe house band will also back up Muscle Shoals singer Alecia Elliott on her new R&B material, the Raybon Brothers on the country hits \"The Church on Cumberland Road\" and \"Butterfly Kisses\" and Upton on the Spiral Starecase chart-topper \"(I Love You) More Today Than Yesterday.\"\n\n\"I can't wait to hear Pat Upton sing again he still sounds great,\" Lewey said. \"I can't even sing as high as he does. That's not fair.\"\n\nHarris is bringing her own road band to the banquet, while the gospel group 4Him is a self-contained act. An acoustic segment of the show features songwriters Mack Vickery (\"The Fireman\"), Kim Tribble (\"Guys Do It All the Time\"), Steven Dale Jones (\"Ten Thousand Angels\") and Bobby Tomberlin (\"One More Day\").\n\n\"Charles is just an incredible arranger and director, and the band he puts together has some of the best musicians in the world,\" Johnson said. \"We've had performers come in, in the past, who were a little doubtful and said they wanted to bring their own band. Once they heard this group, they changed their minds. These players are that impeccable.\"\n\nTerry Pace is entertainment editor of the TimesDaily in Florence.\n\nCountry singer Emmylou Harris will perform at the Alabama/sMusic Hall of Fame 2003/sinduction banquet and awards show this weekend in Mobile.\n\nIF YOU GO"
