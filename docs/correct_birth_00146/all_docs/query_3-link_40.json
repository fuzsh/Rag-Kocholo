        "text": "Thirteen-time GRAMMY award winning songwriter, musician, and vocalist Emmylou Harris is one of the most highly regarded artists in contemporary music. A shining light in both Country Rock and Americana genres, her characteristic voice, musical style and songwriting have been acclaimed not only by her fans, but by critics and fellow recording artists as well. Born in Birmingham, AL, she moved to NYC in the 1960’s to pursue her folk music dreams, and was soon discovered by Gram Parsons, who sent her down the Rock Country path via Nashville and Washington D.C, and by 1980 she had accomplished four number one songs on the US and Canadian country charts.\n\nA string of commercially and critically acclaimed albums followed, and in 1987 Emmylou collaborated with Dolly Parton and Linda Rondstadt on the platinum-selling album, Trio. To date, Emmylou Harris has sold over 15 million records worldwide, earned 13 GRAMMYs, and placed 27 singles into the top ten of the US country chart. Several of her albums have received gold certifications in the US. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2008 and was ranked among Rolling Stone’s list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2022 and has gained admiration as much for her eloquently straightforward songwriting as for her incomparably expressive singing.\n\nFifty plus years into her career, Harris shares the hard-earned wisdom that comes with getting older, and her latest albums exemplify why she is one of the few in pop or country music who have achieved such honesty or revealed such maturity in their writing."
