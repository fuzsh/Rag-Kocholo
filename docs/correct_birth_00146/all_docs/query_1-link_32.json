        "text": "If I could go back to my younger self, especially in the most difficult times, I would just say, don’t worry. Just do what you feel in your heart and everything will be all right. Because it always did turn out okay. There was a time when I went into deep debt over a project, The Ballad of Sally Rose. But I don’t have any regrets about doing it at all because it was real creative reclaiming. After that I had to work my way back up but then, all of a sudden, I did this record called Trio with Linda Ronstadt and Dolly Parton, so the creative chances always seemed to come along. Certainly, there were times when it seemed like I was treading water. But I didn’t really have any other talents – the only thing I knew how to do was sing so, in a sense, I had no choice..\n\nEmmylou Harris\n\nI was riding that pony a bit hard. My voice was getting worn down, and my spirit was getting worn too. I was whining to my friend John Starling, ‘I need to take a year off.’ And John said, ‘Sam Bush has just left the New Grass Revival. Why don’t you give him a call?’ And suddenly it made sense to ‘go back to bluegrass school,’ as Chris Hillman says.\n\nNone of us remembered that we’d recorded that show,. That’s why I was so amazed when I heard it, because not a single note was out of place. I felt I owed it to that particular performance to put it out. What happened, I think, was this: All the songs on Ramble in Music City were material I’d already released. For my next album, we decided to work up all new songs for what became Live at the Ryman, like I had with The Hot Band on Last Date.It was a way to make the old material new, to give it a new coat of paint. I was worried. Would the songs have the same emotional impact? I shouldn’t have worried.\n\nEmmylou, releasing Ramble In Music City in 202, 1990 recordings\n\nBorn in Birmingham, Alabama to a military family, Emmylou Harris moved to Woodbridge, Virginia and graduated as the valedictorian of her high school class. After dropping out of college, she moved to Greenwich Village to participate in the folk scene in the late 1960s. Emmylou recorded her first release Gliding Bird in 1969 before relocating to the suburbs of Maryland in the early 1970s, and playing in local bars like the The Red Fox Inn in Bethesda, Maryland and The Childe Harold in Washington, DC. There, Chris Hillman of The Byrds saw her perform and recommended her to his friend Gram Parsons.\n\nEmmylou became a protege and performing partner of the great Gram Parsons until his untimely demise in 1973, They were together only a year but Gram's influence would last a lifetime. As she recalled, “I really believe no one would have paid me any attention if it wasn’t for Gram. When I met him I had not found my own voice. I was an imitator; you have to start that way. But I really do believe that it was Gram who gave me, not just my voice, but he taught me about understanding music and feeling music, the way it came through me. Of course, I certainly had something to build on, but he was that last rocket boost and, after that, everything kind of fell into place.”\n\nIn 1975, Emmylou began recording for Reprise Records, a label started by Frank Sinatra in 1960 and home to Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young, Frank Zappa and many others. Over her long and illustrious career, Emmylou has sold millions of records and garnered thirteen Grammys and counting.\n\nEmmylou did a very brief tour with Daniel Lanois in support of Wrecking Ball in November 1995, and Erin and I saw her at the Keswick Theater in Glenside, Pennsylvania. A small venue, maybe 1000 seats, Keswick is a converted movie theater. Emmylou came on first with just her acoustic guitar and she beautifully strummed \"My Songbird\" and \"Prayer In Open D\" with her crystalline voice soaring. Then her band appeared: Daniel Lanois on electric guitar, Daryl Johnson on electric bass, and Brady Blade on drums. They tore into a blistering cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"May This Be Love\" which was equal parts distortion, fuzz and wah wah pedals. There was a smattering of boos from some in the crowd who wanted their country music served neat with gingham check, not snarling leather. The response was not quite as heretical as Dylan plugging in at Newport in 1965, and I didn't hear anyone yell \"Judas\", but it was unsettling to some in the audience. Undaunted, Emmylou and her band played most of her (then) new album and ended with a 10 minute scorching version of Lanois' swamp gospel burner \"The Maker.\" The encore was a soulful version of William Bell's \"You Don't Miss Your Water\" from the fabled Stax canon of soul. Country meets Memphis near the New Orleans Bayou, it was an amazing band and performance.\n\nAfter the show, we hung around to get some records signed, and it was bitterly cold, polar vortex cold before it became de rigueur. Emmylou was so kind, she invited us on the bus to provide warmth and comfort. She laughed when I pointed out the original Elite Hotel album cover which was deemed too offensive because her fingers were crossed. Subsequent albums were issued with the fingers air brushed to avoid the appearance of \"flipping.\" She couldn't have been any more gracious, posing for pictures and signing away."
