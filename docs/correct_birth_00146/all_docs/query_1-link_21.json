        "text": "Happy Birthday Carlos Santana! Born this day - Carlos Humberto Santana Barragán in Autlán de Navarro, Mexico. Hits include: >>> \"Oye Como Va\", >>> \"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\", >>> \"No One to Depend On\", >>> \"Evil Ways\", >>> “Oye Coma Va”, >>> “Maria Maria” >>> \"Winning\", >>> “Love of My Life”, >>> \"Smooth\",... Born and raised in Mexico where he developed his musical background, he rose to fame in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States with Santana, which pioneered a fusion of rock and roll and Latin American jazz. Its sound featured his melodic, blues-based lines set against Latin American and African rhythms played on percussion instruments not generally heard in rock, such as timbales and congas. He experienced a resurgence of popularity and critical acclaim in the late 1990s. > He learned to play the violin at age five and the guitar at age eight, under the tutelage of his father, who was a mariachi musician. > The family moved from Autlán to Tijuana, on the border with the United States. Carlos' rock and roll career started in the city park: Parque Teniente Guerrero, his mother took him to see the Tj's, the pioneer rock and roll band from the city. TJ (tee jay) is a nickname for Tijuana. > The Tj's and Bátiz turned Carlos on to blues music, especially that of T-Bone Walker, Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Chuck Berry, Howlin' Wolf, and James Brown. > The Santanas then moved to San Francisco, where his father had steady work. In October 1966, Santana started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band had begun to incorporate different types of influences into their electric blues. > In 1966, he was chosen along with other musicians to form an ad hoc band to substitute for that of an intoxicated Paul Butterfield to play a Sunday matinee set at Bill Graham's Fillmore Auditorium. Graham selected the substitutes from musicians he knew primarily through his connections with the Butterfield Blues Band, Grateful Dead, and Jefferson Airplane. Santana's guitar playing caught the attention of both the audience and Graham. > Major rock music promoter Bill Graham, a Latin music aficionado who had been a fan of Santana from its inception, arranged for the band to appear at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival before its debut album was even released. Its set was one of the surprises of the festival, highlighted by an eleven-minute performance of a throbbing instrumental, \"Soul Sacrifice\". Its inclusion in the Woodstock film and soundtrack album vastly increased the band's popularity. Graham also suggested Santana record the Willie Bobo song \"Evil Ways\", as he felt it would get radio airplay. > Teenage San Francisco Bay Area guitar prodigy Neal Schon joined the Santana band in 1971, in time to complete the third album, Santana III. > He has won 10 Grammy Awards and three Latin Grammy Awards, and was inducted along with his namesake band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.\n\nR.I.P. Bob Newhart - George Robert Newhart was in Oak Park, Ill. A comedian and actor that was known for his deadpan and stammering delivery style. Beginning as a stand-up comedian, he transitioned his career to acting in television. His accolades include three Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award. He received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2002. > Newhart came to prominence in 1960 when his record album of comedic monologues, The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart, became a bestseller and reached number one on the Billboard pop album chart; it remains the 20th-best-selling album in history. > The Bob Newhart Show from 1972 to 1978 he was Chicago psychologist Robert Hartley and then as Vermont innkeeper Dick Loudon on series Newhart from 1982 to 1990. > Newhart acted in films such as Catch-22 (1970), Cold Turkey (1971), In & Out (1997), and Elf (2003). > Bob played Professor Proton on the CBS sitcom The Big Bang Theory from 2013 to 2018, for which he received a Primetime Emmy Award. > Newhart was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in the United States during the Korean War as a clerk until being discharged in 1954. > After the war, Newhart worked for United States Gypsum as an accountant. He later said that his motto, \"That's close enough\", and his habit of adjusting petty cash imbalances with his own money showed he did not have the temperament to be an accountant. > In 1958, Newhart became an advertising copywriter for Fred A. Niles, a major independent film and television producer in Chicago. There, he and a co-worker entertained each other with long telephone calls about absurd scenarios, which they later recorded and sent to radio stations as audition tapes. When the co-worker ended his participation by taking a job in New York, Newhart continued the recordings alone, developing this type of routine. > Dan Sorkin, a radio station disc jockey who later became the announcer-sidekick on Newhart's NBC series, introduced Newhart to the head of talent at Warner Bros. Records. The label signed him in 1959, based solely on those recordings. Newhart expanded his material into a stand-up routine that he began to perform at nightclubs. Newhart became famous mostly on the strength of his audio releases, in which he played a solo \"straight man\". > Guest hosted The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962) 87 times. > The idea for the famous ending for the \"Newhart\" show came from his wife. Ginnie observed that Dallas that had infamously revealed an entire season — and the death of a major character — to be a dream sequence, and that the series finale of St. Elsewhere revealed that show to have been a fantasy in the mind of the main character’s autistic son. Though both of those plot twists were divisive at best at the time, she looked at her husband and his former TV wife and told him, “You ought to wake up in bed with Emily (Suzanne Pleshette_ and describe this dream you had of owning this inn in Vermont.”\n\nHappy Birthday Martha Reeves! (Martha and the Vandals) > Martha Reeves & The Vandellas - founded by friends Annette Beard, Rosalind Ashford and Gloria Williams, the group eventually included Martha Reeves, who moved up in ranks as lead vocalist of the group after Williams' departure in 1962. The group signed with and eventually recorded all of their singles for Motown's Gordy imprint. Hits included: >>> \"Come and Get These Memories\", >>> \"Heat Wave\", >>> \"Quicksand\", >>> \"Nowhere to Run\", >>> \"Jimmy Mack\", >>> \"I'm Ready for Love\", >>> \"Bless You\", >>> \"Dancing in the Street\",... > Reeves was a solo artist under the name Martha LaVaille in the hope of getting a contract with emerging Detroit label Motown. After Motown staffer Mickey Stevenson saw Reeves singing at a Detroit club, he offered her an audition. > By 1961, the group, known as The Vels, were recording background vocals for Motown acts. Prior to her success as lead singer of The Elgins, Saundra Edwards (then going by her surname Mallett) recorded the song \"Camel Walk\", in 1962, which featured the Vels in background vocals. > That same year, the quartet began applying background vocals for emerging Motown star Marvin Gaye, singing on Gaye's first hit single, \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" > After Mary Wells failed to make a scheduled recording session feigning a short illness, the Vels recorded what was initially a demo recording of \"I'll Have to Let Him Go\". Motown was so impressed by the group's vocals – and Martha's lead vocals in the song – that the label CEO Berry Gordy offered to give the group a contract. > Martha and the Vandellas' \"Dancing in the Street\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 (they were nominated for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for the song in 1964). > Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nApollo 11 Launch (July 16) It was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. (Tonight look into the night sky - and stare at the Moon with the thought that we were there) > Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module Eagle on July 20, 1969. > Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. > Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5 kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module Columbia in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin Columbia. > The flight was part of the Space Race. It finished the plan set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 to \"land a man on the moon, and return him safely to the Earth\", before the 1960s ended. > The Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for \"peaceful lunar landing by the United States\". At Lovell's suggestion, he chose the bald eagle, the national bird of the United States, as the symbol. Tom Wilson, a simulator instructor, suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission. > The command module was named Columbia after Columbiad, the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft (also from Florida) in Jules Verne's 1865 novel From the Earth to the Moon. > Neil Armstrong's LM PPK (personal preference kits) contained a piece of wood from the Wright brothers' 1903 Wright Flyer's left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing. > After describing the surface dust as \"very fine-grained\" and \"almost like a powder\", six and a half hours after landing, Armstrong stepped off Eagle's landing pad and declared: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" > The astronauts planted the Lunar Flag Assembly containing a flag of the United States on the lunar surface, in clear view of the TV camera. Aldrin remembered, \"Of all the jobs I had to do on the Moon the one I wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising.\" > While on the surface, Armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the LM ladder, bearing two drawings of Earth (of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres), an inscription - \"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon July 1969, A. D. We came in peace for all mankind.\"\n\nHappy Birthday Stewart Copeland! (Drummer of The Police) Stewart Armstrong Copeland born this day in Alexandria, VA. He is best known for his work as the drummer of the Police from 1977 to 1986, and again from 2007 to 2008. Before playing with the Police, he played drums with English rock band Curved Air. > As a composer, his work includes the films Wall Street (1987), Men at Work (1990), Good Burger (1997), and We Are Your Friends (2015); the television shows The Equalizer (1985–1989), The Amanda Show (1999–2002), and Dead Like Me (2003–2004); He has also written various pieces of ballet, opera, orchestral music and music for video games. > His father - Miles Copeland Jr. was an American CIA officer. His fathers career - caused the family to move to Cairo, Beirut and other foreign assignments. > His eldest brother, Miles Copeland III, founded I.R.S. Records and became the Police's manager. > His other brother, Ian Copeland, was a pioneering booking agent who represented the Police and many others for Frontier Booking International (FBI). > He started taking drum lessons at age 12 and was playing drums for school dances within a year. He later moved to England, attending the American School in London and Millfield boarding school in Somerset. > He went to college in California, enrolling at Alliant International University and the University of California, Berkeley. > Copeland worked as road manager for the progressive rock band Curved Air's 1974 reunion tour, and then as drummer for the band during 1975 and 1976. > In early 1977, Copeland founded the Police with lead singer-bass guitarist Sting and guitarist Henry Padovani (who was soon replaced by Andy Summers). > Stewart also recorded under the pseudonym Klark Kent, releasing several UK singles in 1978 with one (\"Don't Care\") entering the UK Singles Chart that year, along with an eponymous 10-inch album on green vinyl released in 1980. > In 1982, Copeland was involved in the production of a WOMAD benefit album called Music and Rhythm. Copeland's score for Rumble Fish secured him a Golden Globe nomination in 1983. The film, directed and produced by Francis Ford Coppola from the S. E. Hinton novel, also had a song released to radio on A&M Records \"Don't Box Me In\" (UK Singles Chart n. 91)—a collaboration between Copeland and singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway, leader of the band Wall of Voodoo—that received significant airplay upon release of the film that year. > The Rhythmatist record of 1985 was the result of a pilgrimage to Africa and its people, and it features local drums and percussion, with more drums, percussion and other instruments and occasional lead vocals added by Copeland. > > He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Police in 2003, the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013. > He was ranked the 10th best drummer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2016.\n\nR.I.P. Ruth Westheimer - (Dr. Ruth) Dr. Ruth Westheimer’s media career began in 1980 when her radio show, “Sexually Speaking,” debuted on WYNY-FM in New York City, and by 1983, her show was the top-rated show heard in the nation’s largest radio market. > Standing just four feet and seven inches, Dr. Ruth Westheimer says she feels like she’s six feet tall. The Holocaust survivor, known as “America’s sex therapist,” has helped countless people reclaim their sex lives, gain ownership of their bodies, and feel like they’re “normal.” Then again, according to Westheimer, 91, who is known to everyone as Dr. Ruth, “Everything is normal.” > When she entered the public sphere in the 1980s with her radio show, Sexually Speaking, talking about sex and normalizing taboos was basically unheard of. She was met with immense criticism from people who thought she was blasphemous, or gave out advice too frivolously. But as a Jewish immigrant who prioritized education, nothing could stop Westheimer from preaching sex-positive gospel. > Her charisma belies her short stature — when Westheimer talks, people lean in to hear her say things like, “short people make the best lovers” (something we here at Kveller wholeheartedly agree with!) or “size doesn’t matter.” With her thick German accent, she became a vocal and formidable figure during the AIDS epidemic, and she fought homophobic misinformation by educating people about the disease. She also fought for a woman’s right to abortion, and became the point person to ask things no one dared ask anyone else. > She then launched a television show, The Dr. Ruth Show, which by 1985 attracted two million viewers a week. She became known for giving serious advice while being candid, but also warm, cheerful, funny, and respectful, and for her tag phrase: \"Get some\". In 1984 The New York Times noted that she had risen \"from obscurity to almost instant stardom.\" > She hosted several series on the Lifetime Channel and other cable television networks from 1984 to 1993. She became a household name and major cultural figure, appeared on several network TV shows, co-starred in a movie with Gérard Depardieu, appeared on the cover of People, sang on a Tom Chapin album, appeared in several commercials, and hosted Playboy videos. She was the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality. > In 1952 Ruth went to France, got her degrees focusing on marriage and family planning, then went to the United States, and worked at Planned Parenthood. It was there she realized she needed to learn more about human sexuality so she could answer people’s questions. > She was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame\n\nR.I.P. Shannen Doherty - Doherty had roles in both television and film, including Jenny Wilder in Little House on the Prairie (1982–1983), Maggie Malene in Girls Just Want to Have Fun (1985), Kris Witherspoon in Our House (1986–1988), Heather Duke in Heathers (1989), Brenda Walsh in Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990–1994), 90210 (2008–2009) and BH90210 (2019), Prue Halliwell in Charmed (1998–2001), and Dobbs in Fortress (2021). Shannen Maria Doherty was born in Memphis, TN. In 1978, at the tender age of seven, she and her family moved to Los Angeles, where her father started a West Coast branch of the family transportation business. She knew she wanted to pursue an acting career when she made her acting debut at age ten, with a role on the series Father Murphy (1981). > Father Murphy, which was created and produced by Michael Landon. The same year, 11-year-old Doherty won the recurring role of Jenny Wilder on Little House on the Prairie, which Landon starred in and produced. > Doherty's first major motion picture role was in the dark comedy Heathers, which premiered in 1988. She garnered worldwide attention and fame for her breakout role as Brenda Walsh in the Aaron Spelling-produced TV series Beverly Hills, 90210 in 1990. > Doherty's career afterward consisted primarily of made-for-TV movies, though she also had a lead role in Kevin Smith's 1995 film Mallrats and later cameoed in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. > In 1998, Spelling again cast her in another of his television series, Charmed, in which she played one of the lead characters, Prue Halliwell, the oldest of three sisters who are witches. Doherty also directed a few episodes for the series during the second and third seasons. Doherty left the show in 2001 at the end of the third season, resulting in her character's death. Reportedly, her departure was caused by on-set and off-set tensions between Doherty and co-star Alyssa Milano. > In 2003, Doherty hosted the Sci Fi Channel candid-camera show Scare Tactics during its initial season. > On March 1, 2010, it was announced that Doherty would be a celebrity contestant on Dancing with the Stars for the tenth season. The season premiered on Monday, March 22, 2010. She wanted to do Dancing with the Stars to make her ailing father proud. Doherty returned for the finale.\n\nHappy Birthday Dan Reynolds! (Imagine Dragons) Daniel Coulter Reynolds born on July 14th in Las Vegas. Lead vocalist and a founding member of the pop rock band Imagine Dragons, which formed in 2008. Hits include: >>> \"Believer\", >>> \"Thunder\", >>> \"Whatever It Takes\", >>> \"It's Time\", >>> \"Radioactive\", >>> \"Demons\", >>> \"Natural\", >>> \"Enemy\", >>> \"Eyes Closed\",... After he began attending Brigham Young University, Reynolds found that he could not \"do anything else\" and committed fully to a professional music career. In Utah, Reynolds met and recruited drummer Andrew Tolman to form Imagine Dragons. With Reynolds as lead vocalist, Imagine Dragons won BYU's \"Battle of the Bands\" and other local competitions. > Dan cites Arcade Fire, Nirvana, Muse, The Beatles, Paul Simon, Coldplay, Linkin Park, Harry Nilsson, and U2 as some of his and the band's artistic influences. > Reynolds, who grew up playing piano from ages six to 16, had diverse musical interests as a young person. With piano, he studied the classics: Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven. In middle school, he played tenor saxophone in the school jazz band. > Dan realized he was the only one around him recording a new song every day. That his middle school, and later, high school peers didn’t seem to have the same motivations. > “I wrote a song almost every day since I was 12,” he says. “I have thousands of these songs, fully recorded with verses, lyrical melody. It was a diary for me since I was a teenager and it still is. Repetition. The 10,000-hour rule is a real thing, I think. I believe that it has to be a lifestyle.” > He is a recipient of the Songwriters Hall of Fame Hal David Starlight Award. > Reynolds was invited to perform an opening set for Nico Vega in 2010; this was when he met Aja Volkman, the group's lead singer. He asked her to help him finish some demos he was developing. The two began collaborating, and formed Egyptian. > In 2016, Reynolds formed Night Street Records, an imprint label under Interscope Records. His first signing was alternative hip-hop artist K.Flay. > “Music never fails to bring me joy or to comfort me,” Reynolds says. “To delight my sense and bring me excitement, or sorrow and someone to mourn with. Someone to be angry with or happy with. Music is consistent. It’s always there. I can always count on it. It never lets me down.”"
