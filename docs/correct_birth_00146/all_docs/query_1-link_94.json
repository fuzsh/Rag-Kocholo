        "text": "9 am - FAME Recording Studios\n\nThe best place to start is with a tour of the studio that created the “Muscle Shoals Sound” — FAME Recording Studios, located on Avalon Avenue in Muscle Shoals. Still a working studio, this is where the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section got its start. FAME was host to artists such as Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Duane Allman, Otis Redding, the Osmonds, Paul Anka and many others. In the last 50 years, FAME Studios recorded or published music that sold over 350 million copies.\n\nTours are Mon – Fri 9 am & 4 pm; Sat 10 am – 2 pm\n\n603 E.

Recently renovated by Apple/Beats, the facility has become a recording studio once again, in addition to conducting tours of the studio where iconic hits like “Wild Horses” were made. The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, also known as the “Swampers”, created Muscle Shoals Sound Studios here, and later moved it to a location on the river in Sheffield.\n\nHours are 10-4 Monday - Saturday with tours on the half hour 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 1:30, 2:30, 3:30\n\nTickets $20.00 Veterans with ID and Senior discount offered\n\nPet Friendly\n\nGroups of 20 or more are $13.00 per person\n\n3614 Jackson Highway,\n\nSheffield, AL 35660\n\n256-978-5151\n\nwww.msmusicfoundation.org\n\n11:30 am - Cypress Moon Studios\n\nThe second Muscle Shoals Sound, now known as Cypress Moon Studios, brought in acts like Bob Dylan, Julian Lennon, Bob Seger, Steve Winwood and more.

You’ll be amazed at the number of talented people from Alabama who changed the course of musical history, including Tommy Shaw of Styx, Lionel Richie, Bobby Goldsboro, Jim Nabors, Emmylou Harris and many, many more.
