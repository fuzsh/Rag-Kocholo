        "text": "Emmylou did a very brief tour with Daniel Lanois in support of Wrecking Ball in November 1995, and Erin and I saw her at the Keswick Theater in Glenside, Pennsylvania. A small venue, maybe 1000 seats, Keswick is a converted movie theater. Emmylou came on first with just her acoustic guitar and she beautifully strummed \"My Songbird\" and \"Prayer In Open D\" with her crystalline voice soaring. Then her band appeared: Daniel Lanois on electric guitar, Daryl Johnson on electric bass, and Brady Blade on drums. They tore into a blistering cover of Jimi Hendrix's \"May This Be Love\" which was equal parts distortion, fuzz and wah wah pedals. There was a smattering of boos from some in the crowd who wanted their country music served neat with gingham check, not snarling leather. The response was not quite as heretical as Dylan plugging in at Newport in 1965, and I didn't hear anyone yell \"Judas\", but it was unsettling to some in the audience. Undaunted, Emmylou and her band played most of her (then) new album and ended with a 10 minute scorching version of Lanois' swamp gospel burner \"The Maker.\" The encore was a soulful version of William Bell's \"You Don't Miss Your Water\" from the fabled Stax canon of soul. Country meets Memphis near the New Orleans Bayou, it was an amazing band and performance.\n\nAfter the show, we hung around to get some records signed, and it was bitterly cold, polar vortex cold before it became de rigueur. Emmylou was so kind, she invited us on the bus to provide warmth and comfort. She laughed when I pointed out the original Elite Hotel album cover which was deemed too offensive because her fingers were crossed. Subsequent albums were issued with the fingers air brushed to avoid the appearance of \"flipping.\" She couldn't have been any more gracious, posing for pictures and signing away."
