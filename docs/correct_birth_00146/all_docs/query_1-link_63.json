        "text": "In 1987, one of the most important albums in county music history was issued by three of the most celebrated female singers of the era—Linda Ronstadt, Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. The album, known as “Trio” went on to sell in the millions, won a Grammy Award, produced four hit singles, and is credited with reviving the careers of these legendary stars. The album was so successful, that a second album, known as Trio II was issued in 1999, and again topped Billboard’s country and western chart. Saturday night at the Elks Theater in downtown Prescott, Khris Dodge Productions paid tribute to the music of these legendary performers with in a concert simply titled “Trio”.\n\nAll three of these performers were born within a year of each other–Parton and Ronstadt in 1946, and Harris in 1947. They were all superstars by the late 1960’s and dominated the country and western charts throughout the 1970’s and early 1980’s. They were still major figures by the mid 1980’s, but record companies and radio stations were always looking for newer and younger.\n\nAll three knew each other and had performed together at various venues. They had been planning to do an album together for years. But they were under contract with different record labels and had conflicting schedules. Getting together in the same studio at the same time complicated the project for years.\n\nRonstadt was born and raised in Tucson and briefly attended the University of Arizona before decamping for California where she sang with the Doors and did back up vocals for Neil Young and Jackson Browne. She had success in other genres before finding a lasting home in country music.\n\nHarris was born in Birmingham, Alabama. But her first success was in the coffee houses of Greenwich Village, and the folk music of the 1960’s. She eventually gravitated to county music in collaboration with singer-songwriter Grant Parsons who she later married. Her unique “teardrop” voice made her a chart topper with hits such as Evangeline, Sweet Dreams, Two More Bottles of Wine and Love Hurts.\n\nParton, born in Pittman, Tennessee is not just a beloved country and western singer but a cultural icon. Her 11 Grammys, 25 number one singles, movies, TV Specials and Dollywood theme park in the Smokey Mountains of East Tennessee have kept her country music’s biggest female star for decades.\n\nAll three of these legendary superstars received fitting tribute in Khris Dodge’s production of “Trio”. The tight harmonies of the of three performers on stage gave full credit to the original sound of the Trio albums. Jody Darling’s lovely soprano and impressive vocal range did honor to Dolly’s number one hits including Jolene, Coat of Many Colors, Joshua and Nine to Five.\n\nHeather Hardy’s smooth vocals and expert violin brought Emmylou Harris to life. Her versions of A Wayfaring Stranger and Two More Bottles of Wine were particularly effective show stoppers.\n\nExpectations were high for Mindy Ronstadt, niece of Linda Rondstadt. She did not disappoint. Unlike Harris and Parton, who still perform, Linda Rondstadt retired in 2011 due to a neurological disorder. Also, unlike Harris and Parton, whose biggest hits have been within the country genre, Linda Ronstadt enjoyed huge popularity in multiple genres including rock, folk rock, and country which earned her twelve Grammys and numerous top singles. Mindy Rondstadt’s warm vocal style paid homage to one of great legacies of country music. Her versions of Blue Bayou, Silver Thread and Golden Needles and When Will I Be Loved capped a memorable evening of tribute to three of the most important female vocalists of our time."
