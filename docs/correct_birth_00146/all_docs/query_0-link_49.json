        "text": "Alt-country godmother Emmylou Harris has one of the purest voices in music. The Alabama-born songbird was Gram Parsons' singing partner in the '70s before emerging as a solo artist and scoring a slew of country hits. She made her name as a master interpreter of other people's songs, helping to earn attention for the work of everyone from Townes Van Zandt to Rodney Crowell, but she's penned her own tunes too. A multi-GRAMMYÂ® award winner, Harris has become a grand dame of the Americana realm, influencing multiple generations of singers with her aching Alabama croon."
