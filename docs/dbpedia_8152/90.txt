Back to the Beach reunites Frankie and Annette for one last beach party.

Back Cover Synopsis[]

Veteran beach-movie favorites Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello return to the screen in this hip, hilarious update of their surf-and-sand adventures. Break Dancing may have replaced The Twist in the intervening years, but Frankie and Annette still know how to have a good time - and they teach their own '80's new-wave children a thing or two in the process. A host of familiar faces - Bob Denver, Tony Dow, Jerry Mathers, Don Adams, Edd "Kookie" Byrnes, Pee-Wee Herman and more - joins the fun in the California sun!
