        "text": "Annette Funicello, fresh from her peanut-butter commercials, plays a cheery Ohio Mom who practically force-feeds Skippy sandwiches to her teen-aged son. Frankie Avalon is her car-salesman husband - he was the Big Kahuna, the world's greatest surfer - who takes the family back to the scene of all those 60's Beach Party movies. Annette gets to sing and dance in a pink polka-dot bathing suit with matching headband. Frankie gets to flirt with Connie Stevens. There's even a guest appearance by the Cleavers - Wally, June and the Beaver. So with all this self-parody floating around, why isn't ''Back to the Beach'' funny?\n\nMaybe for sheer silliness nothing can match the originals: ''Muscle Beach Party'' or ''Bikini Beach,'' or any of the other movies where Frankie and Annette fight, she makes him jealous, they kiss and make up -and only kiss, because they're not married and they're good kids. Meanwhile, the surfers triumph in some petty feud with a black-leather motorcycle gang.\n\nIn ''Back to the Beach,'' Frankie and Annette go to California to visit their daughter, Sandi. They fight, she makes him jealous, they kiss and make up - and only kiss because they have to move on to the next scene, a confontation with the black-leather punks who have won their son's allegiance. Everything is resolved in the big Surf Off competition.\n\nOnce, the Beach Party formula must have seemed like a teen-age fantasy, but the movies have aged so badly they now play on television or video like goofy messages from outer space. In ''Back to the Beach,'' the only message from from outer space is Pee-Wee Herman's rendition of ''Surfin' Bird.'' (''Bird, bird, bird. Bird is the word.'') He does the lyrics justice. The rest is a series of telegraphed jokes that will fulfill your worst fears. When Annette's son complains about all that peanut butter and she offers a change, can't you guess she means chunky instead of plain? How many stiff-hairdo jokes can you stand? And when Don Adams appears, it's painful; you know he's going to say, ''Would you believe . . .?'', and he takes so long to get it over with."
