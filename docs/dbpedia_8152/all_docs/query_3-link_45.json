        "text": "The Frankie and DeeDee adventures or, as they are better known, 'The Beach Movies', were made between 1963 and 1965, featuring a group of beach-crazy surfing friends, and were set in the Malibu Beach area of California on the West Coast of America.\n\nAll five were produced by William Asher and starred Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello supported by an ever-changing cast, sprinkled with famous guest appearances and cameo roles with the backing of the 'West Coast sound' from artists like Dick Dale and The Deltones, The Beach Boys, Jan and Dean, The Surfaris, The Hondells and many other classic surf groups of the Sixties.\n\nThere were many similarly styled movies and a lot of them starred Annette Funicello, which probably gives her the title 'Queen of the Beach Movies'. Some have become cult films in their own right, but this series of five films with Frankie and DeeDee remain the definitive examples of the genre and are 'The Beach Movies'. Four other 'almost beach movies' may, at a push, also be included in this genre:\n\nBeach Party 1963 American International Pictures (AIP)\n\nDirected by: William Asher Producer: James H.

An anthropologist who is writing a book about the tribalism and mating habits of the Californian surf-dwellers takes to spying on them for new material. The story is punctuated by ho-daddy Eric Von Zipper doing his best to create havoc amongst the surfing pals.\n\nMuscle Beach Party 1964\n\nAmerican International Pictures (AIP)\n\nDirected by: William Asher\n\nProducers: James H.

All's well that ends well and Frankie and DeeDee are once again happily entwined by the end of the show.\n\nBikini Beach 1964\n\nAmerican International Pictures (AIP)\n\nDirected by: William Asher\n\nProducers: James H.
