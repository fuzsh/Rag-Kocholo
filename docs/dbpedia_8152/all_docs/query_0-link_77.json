        "text": "The Annette Biography\n\nVISIT THE ANNETTE DISCOGRAPHY AND MOUSEKETEER STORY (EARLIER POST – CLICK HERE)\n\nJust finished reading Annette Funicello’s autobiography, “A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes” by Patricia Romanowski …. a fun read but sad.\n\nUnlike so many other children who pursued careers in the entertainment would, the Funicello family did not journey to southern California to find fame for their daughter. In fact, Annette had no intention of becoming a performer. It was only her very casual participation in a school talent show which just happened to have sitting in the audience one Walter Elias Disney who was there on the invitation of a friend with a child in the presentation.\n\nA few days later the phone would ring at the Funicello household. Disney was calling regarding the darling 12-year old girl who captured his attention performing a ballerina-tap combination dance. An audition was offered for an new idea Walt had for a TV program which would feature little ‘mouseketeers’.\n\nAnnette’s mother was not excited about the prospect of a tryout. She misunderstood Walt thinking he had offered a role for Annette as a musketeer!\n\nWell, mom relented, Annette attended the audition – and a star was born. Disney was looking for 24 children – preferably with no or little entertaining experience for his idea – And as it turned out, little Annette would be the 24th and final pick for a group of 24 youngsters to become the famous Mouseketeers!\n\nThe 24 were assigned to one of three groupings, Red team – White team and Blue team with the Red team being the Mouseketeer primary team of eight with Annette joined by Sharon Baird, Darlene Gillespie, Bobby Burgess, Lonnie Burr, Tommy Cole, Karen Pendleton, and Cubby O’Brien (and occasionally a few others).\n\nAnnette’s Battle with MS – Farewell to a Nation’s Sweetheart…\n\nShe undertook this biography with the express intention of speaking frankly about her struggle with multiple sclerosis. Toward the end of the book Annette goes into much detail relating her initial symptoms and diagnoses. Most interesting for me was her detailed explanation of how MS occurs and how unpredictable it is.\n\nI learned that by itself, unlike Alzheimer’s, MS is not fatal. Other conditions developed perhaps assisted by the presence of the disease but every case is so very different. Symptoms can develop, worsen, disappear and return or never return.\n\nAnnette came from the east coast with her parents to California at a very early age when she was only four. Her mother and father had no idea of where they would live – where he would find work and what the future held for them. They ended up in Encino in a modest home. Her father was great with automobiles and landed a job as a mechanic.\n\nVisit this Annette with the Mouseketeers page which I published some time ago – Click on the image below:\n\nI decided to cover the motion pictures that Annette appeared in. She loved working with the casts of these movies and formed life-long friendships with many of the actors/musicians, especially Frankie Avalon. When she and Frankie were touring together in those later years Annette decided to finally tell Frankie about her illness which she had held back from her friends.\n\nTo her astonishment Frankie already knew. Her second husband – Glen Holt – had secretly confided her condition prior to their tour in order that Frankie could watch over her more closely – make certain that she was in stable situations (such as not near the edge of the stage) due to her imbalance which was worsening. Annette was furious at both Glen and Frankie initially but then quickly came to the realization that they both must have cared about her so much.\n\nAnnette was diagnosed in 1987, wrote her biography in 1994 – lost her ability to walk in 2004, could no longer speak by 2009 and in a very sad condition – bedridden and fed by tube, passed away on April 8th, 2013 – hospitalized – She was 70 years-old. Her family and her life-long friend, Shelley Fabares – were with her at the moment of her passing\n\nAnnette received the “Disney Legend Award” in 1992 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in September of 1993.\n\nThe Filmography of Annette Funicello & Promotion Scrap Book\n\n(The scrap book photos from the Facebook page follow the motion picture listings)\n\nThe Shaggy Dog –
