        "text": "Within the past few days or so, we have heard about the deaths of Roger Ebert and “Queen of Prep” Lilly Pulitzer.\n\nFollowing the rule of threes, we have also lost one of America’s sweethearts. Original\n\nDisney teen sensation and “Beach Party“\n\nstar Annette Funicello passed away yesterday, due to complications from multiple sclerosis. Discovered at the\n\nage of 12 by Walt Disney, Funicello\n\nwent on to be unarguably the most popular Mouseketeer (6,000 fan letters a week) in the newly formed “Mickey Mouse Club“ and to\n\nappear in such Disney classics as “The\n\nShaggy Dog.” By this time, Funicello was also releasing pop hits left\n\nand right, including “Tall Paul,” “First Name Initial,” and “Pineapple\n\nPrincess.” After outgrowing her Mouseketeer sweater, to the notice of young boys around the country, she moved onto the series of films she is\n\nprobably most famous for, the “Beach Party” movies.\n\nWith the smash hit “Beach\n\nParty,” Funicello and onscreen love interest Frankie Avalon became instant ’60s icons and spawned a whole genre\n\nof party films that mixed sand and surf. Playing the fun-loving albeit wholesome Dee Dee, girls wanted to be her friend and boys wanted to go steady with her. In this role, Annette set the trends in America for two-piece bathing suits\n\n(eventually donning the scandalous bikini) and immovable big hair (thanks to\n\ncans and cans of hairspray). If you’re not that familiar with the films (and\n\nyou should be after reading this), you may be with the parodies that poked fun\n\nat Funicello’s “wholesome teenager” image, including a Princess Leia Beach Party\n\nsketch on SNL, a line in the “Grease” song “Look at Me, I’m Sandra Dee” (“Keep your filthy paws off my silky draws, would\n\nyou pull that crap with Annette?”), and if you look closely enough, her picture appears in\n\nboth “Hairspray“ movies.\n\nAfter the surf craze hit its peak, Funicello and Avalon\n\ntoured the country as a singing act and re-teamed onscreen for the self-parodying\n\n1987 “Back to the Beach.” Shortly\n\nafter, Funicello’s health began to fail and she announced in 1992 that she was\n\nsuffering from multiple sclerosis. Taking this in stride and with her signature can-do attitude, Funicello started the Annette\n\nFunicello Research Fund for Neurological Disorders and sought to aid the\n\nsearch of a cure for multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases.\n\nWhether she was your first crush as a peppy Mouseketeer or you remember her fondly as a spokeswoman for Skippy peanut butter, she will be sorely missed and will continue\n\nto be beloved as an Americana icon. Below are the general overviews of five Annette Funicello movies that will live on….\n\n“Babes in Toyland” (1961)\n\nEvery holiday season, this film can be found on some cable\n\nnetwork and is usually shown a few too many times. Originally a box-office\n\nfailure, “Babes in Toyland“ has\n\nbecome a Christmas classic. Beginning with a talking goose named Sylvester (clearly a hand puppet), it’s a yarn about two\n\nnursery rhyme characters who are about to get married, although the local\n\nmiser tries to sabotage the impending nuptials at every turn. Annette Funicello plays the\n\ndarling bride-to-be, Mary Contrary, and object of evil Barnaby’s desire (played by post-Oz Ray Bolger), who goes as far to send two goons to steal her family’s sheep and get rid\n\nof her groom, Tom Piper (Tommy Sands).\n\nMusical numbers include a puzzled Annette singing in “I Can’t Do The Sum,” a\n\nduet between her and Tommy in “Just A Toy,” and Annette\n\nsinging and dancing with a creepy Bolger in “Castle in Spain.” While\n\nthis film definitely does not gain points for female empowerment (see the songs\n\njust mentioned), it can still be fun for kids with toy soldiers coming to life,\n\na shrinking machine and a multitude of Mother Goose characters, including\n\nLittle Bo-Peep and Willie Winkie. Reportedly, this was Annette Funicello’s favorite of all\n\nher films and a must-see for any Annette fan.\n\n“Beach Party” (1963)\n\nMeant to be merely a low-budget imitation\n\nof Elvis Presley’s musical movies popular at the time, “Beach Party” took on a life of its own as the first in a wave of\n\ndecade-defining beach party movies. The plot concerns a middle-aged\n\nanthropology professor (Robert Cummings)\n\nwho finds his next case study at the beach – “the wild mating habits” of teenagers.\n\nHis subjects include Dolores aka Dee Dee (Annette Funicello) and Frankie aka\n\nThe Big Kahuna (Frankie Avalon) along with local biker gang leader Eric Von\n\nZipper (Harvey Lembeck, who would have been pushing 40) and other\n\nsurfing teenagers. After the professor knocks Von Zipper out cold, Dolores\n\ndevelops a crush on him that makes Frankie retaliate by flirting with a\n\nHungarian waitress (Eva Six). Don’t\n\nworry, Dolores and Frankie end up together, the professor finds a mate (Dorothy Malone), and there are four more films in the official series, all following a similar formula. Contrary to popular belief that she was not allowed to wear a two-piece bathing suit, Funicello\n\ndoes wear a pink one in this film and helped bring the fashion to American shores. Tunes include the theme “Beach Party Tonight,” Annette singing to herself in a mirror in “Treat Him Nicely,” and “Promise Me Anything (But Give Me Love).” Keep your eyes peeled for Vincent Price playing Big Daddy and listen for his line, “Bring me my pendulum, kiddies, I feel like swinging!”\n\n“Bikini Beach“ (1964)\n\nOriginally written for The\n\nBeatles, the third “Beach Party” movie “Bikini Beach“ was reconstructed to fit the “Annette and Frankie” mold and sees another adult puzzling over these beach bum\n\nkids and their habits – “imagine… boys and girls sleeping on the beach\n\nside-by-side, unchaperoned. Now what kind of society is it that would allow\n\nsuch a thing?” This time, it’s a millionaire with the ridiculous name of Harvey\n\nHuntington Honeywagon III (Keenan Wynn,\n\nson of Ed Wynn) who believes that\n\nhis pet chimpanzee named Clyde is smarter than the whole lot of them. He may\n\nhave a point as Clyde can surf, drive, and watusi. Along the way, we are\n\nintroduced to Avalon’s personal acting range as he plays not only lovable Frankie but also\n\nPeter Royce Bentley aka “The Potato Bug” (a spoof of The Beatles and the Brits\n\nin general) who races cars and rocks hard (at least by the standard of these\n\nfilms). As you’d expect when Frankie acts a little commitment-phobic, Dee Dee\n\nturns to “The Potato Bug” and causes a jealous Frankie to challenge him to a\n\ndrag race. It all culminates in a massive brawl (including the gang, the ape,\n\nand the millionaire) at Big Drag’s Pit Stop (Don Rickles‘ bar) and ends with a performance by Little Stevie Wonder playing the film out.\n\nOther tunes include Annette sweetly singing “This\n\nTime It’s Love” and a darling duet between Annette and Frankie in “Because\n\nYou’re You.” Keep your eyes open for Boris\n\nKarloff in a brief cameo as an art dealer (a reference to Vincent Price’s\n\ncommercials for Sears – “the Vincent Price Collection of Fine Art”).\n\nAlso, listen for Elizabeth Montgomery\n\n(Samantha on “Bewitched“) as the\n\nvoice of Yvonne, the Lady Bug.\n\n“Beach Blanket Bingo” (1965)\n\nThe fourth “Beach Party” film, “Beach Blanket Bingo” marks Frankie Avalon’s final full appearance\n\nin a “Beach Party” movie and is considered by many the pinnacle of its genre, although I think it stands as a testament to how bizarre studio execs thought teenagers were in the ’60s. The\n\nplot involves a singer named Sugar Kane (Linda\n\nEvans) whose manager (the incomparable Paul\n\nLynde) is desperate to create a buzz and the regular Frankie and Dee Dee\n\nrelationship drama ensues. Kane gets kidnapped and its up to the beach gang to save\n\nher. Along the way, Beach Party regular Bonehead (Jody McCrea, son of Joel\n\nMcCrea) falls in love with a mermaid (Marta\n\nKristen), as much sense as that makes. Oh, and did I mention there’s\n\nskydiving? Yes, after Sugar Kane’s manager organizes a skydiving stunt, Frankie\n\ntakes it up as a hobby and a jealous Dee Dee follows. Keep your eyes open for Don Rickles again and\n\nsilent film star Buster Keaton. Tunes\n\ninclude the theme “Beach Blanket\n\nBingo” and another great duet with Annette and Frankie in “I Think\n\nYou Think.”\n\n“Back to the Beach“\n\n(1987)\n\nIn her last starring role, Annette Funicello plays her\n\nonscreen ’60s persona all grown-up, married to Frankie (Frankie Avalon) and\n\nsettled out in Ohio. “Back to the Beach” brings the duo back to the surf, sand, and sun when they visit their daughter\n\nSandi (Lori Loughlin – yes, that’s Rebecca\n\nfrom “Full House“) who is shacked up\n\nwith an unapproved surfer boyfriend (Tommy Hinkley). As Annette and Frankie try to make the beach fun\n\nagain rather than seedy, Frankie is challenged to prove his status as The Big\n\nKahuna by younger surfers and Connie\n\nStevens threatens his marriage to Annette. Don’t worry – true to form, his\n\ntitle and the duo are safe. The film’s myriad cameos include Bob Denver (Gilligan), O.J. Simpson, and Pee-wee\n\nHerman. Tunes include “Jamaica\n\nSka” with Annette Funicello paired with the against-type alternative rock band Fishbone and “We’ll\n\nGo On Forever” with the cast and ending the film. Although it may not be anybody’s favorite beach movie in lieu of others on this list, “Back to the Beach” was a pleasant albeit nostalgic update that kept the spirit of the original “Beach Party” movies and acted a peppy introduction to the genre for a younger generation of Annette and Frankie fans.\n\nAny fond memories of Annette Funicello from TV or the movies you’d like to share?
