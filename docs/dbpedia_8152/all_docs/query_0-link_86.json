        "text": "i met annette and her mother and father when i was about 15 years old in san antonio texas at the geranada hotel.this was in about 1955 or 1956 she had done a show here.i called to all the maine hotels looking for her.but i could not find her.i talked to bobby rydel at a hotel and he told me where she was. i called her the next day to meet her.i went to the hotel and we talked about one hour.then she had to catch a plaine. i have not seen or talk to her again. it would nice if i could talk to her befour i pass on. but it may never be posable.i know that she very well none and security is good around her.some times a dream will come true. all i can do is dream and hope that some day it would come true. i still live in san antonio texas. i will be 71 october 19 2012.there is a lot more to this story. i will leave my phone number in hopes my dream will come true some day.billy.\n\nI am one of millions of young boys whose first \"crush\" was Annette. If someone were to ask me to define a \"cute\" girl I would simply ask them to watch episodes of the Mickey Mouse Club, watch The Shaggy Dog movie or her beach movies. Her sincerity, inner sweetness, charm, and a sort of \"clean\" sex appeal showed through whenever she was on screen. I'm 65 now and my heart still skips a beat when I think of her.\n\nAnnette, you'll probably never see this little note but if you do \"Thank you for many great memories and a whole lot of excellent entertainment. Your star will always shine the brightest for me\".\n\nSincerely,\n\nLarry Larson (a fan forever)\n\nAnnette always stayed faithful to Walt Disney with her beach movies and never showing her navel she was always in a one-piece bathing suit. To me and I think to every guy in those days she was the perfect girl next-door. She was always trim and proper and also had such great talent and dancing singing and being an actress. I think a lot of people always pictured a nap and Frankie Avalon as a couple after seeing them on screen but no one could ever replace her second husband. I thank God that my wife is not as bad as Annettwas with her multiple sclerosis she is still with me but when Annette pass gone I cried. I don't know if we'll Disney parks have anything onering her but in my opinion they should even a pavilion. Showing clips of her income movies and the Mickey Mouse club she will live in my heart forever\n\nLiving in neighboring Glendale, California in the mid-50s, a friend and I used to bicycle to Burbank after school and wait outside the Disney Studio gates until we'd see Annette and her mother leave for home in a limo. We'd pedal like crazy to follow, but rarely lasted more than a block or two. Like a car-chasing dog, I have no idea what we'd have done if we ever caught up to them, but it was fun just being that close to her."
