        "text": "\"I am the girl next door. And I'm not moving.\"\n\nAnnette Funicello made that declaration in 1965, in the curiously titled film \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\nPlaying beach girl Didi in the film, Funicello was deflecting the attentions of a wolf played by Dwayne Hickman.\n\nBut in the real-world realm of popular culture, Funicello inhabited the girl-next-door station with her wholesome looks, sugary voice and on-screen charisma.\n\nFunicello — remembered as an original Mouseketeer on \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" and for a string of \"beach party\" movies co-starring Frankie Avalon — died Monday at age 70 of complications from multiple sclerosis.\n\nAs a child, the Utica, N.Y., native was a star in Walt Disney's stable. In addition to \"The Mickey Mouse Club\" (which debuted in 1955), Funicello appeared in Disney's \"Spin and Marty\" (1957-56), \"The Shaggy Dog\" (1959) and \"Babes in Toyland\" (1961). With her large, dark eyes, dark hair and infectious smile, she often sang and danced in Disney productions; in \"Babes in Toyland,\" she danced with \"The Wizard of Oz\" star Ray Bolger.\n\nBut \"Uncle Walt\" — as Disney was called by the young stars at his studio — fretted when, in 1963, Funicello was hired by American-International Pictures to star in \"Beach Party,\" the first of the beach party series.\n\nWhile Walt Disney Productions was the gold standard for family entertainment, AIP was a purveyor of drive-in fare such as \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\" and \"Dragstrip Girl.\" Besides, in \"Beach Party,\" Uncle Walt's sweet little Annette would be wearing — gasp! — a bathing suit.\n\nDisney background\n\nSamuel Z. Arkoff, co-founder of AIP and co-producer of the beach party movies, recalled this with a laugh when I spoke with him in 1990. (Arkoff died in 2001 at age 83.)\n\n\"Walt Disney created Annette Funicello,\" Arkoff then said. \"I don't mean to say he created her, but he built her up. And he had her under an exclusive contract.\n\n\"Walt was a creative, ingenious man, but he had some warped ideas about young people. If you look at any Walt Disney movie, the young people are very nice kids who never have any problems or talk back. They never have any opinions of their own. This is the way Walt liked it. It was the adult who got himself into trouble. Someone like Fred MacMurray as the absent-minded inventor or whatever.\n\n\"Annette had worked for Walt since 'The Mickey Mouse Club' on television. She would be on there singing, 'M-I-C ... K-E-Y ...' And, usually, she would be one of the nice kids in his features. Well, eventually Disney got rid of 'The Mickey Mouse Club,' and they signed Annette to a nonexclusive contract. So, now she could work for anybody else, though she would still do two or three pictures for Disney. When we heard about this, we signed her for the first beach party movie.\"\n\nArkoff said AIP then developed an advertising campaign for \"Beach Party\" that showed a girl in a bikini — a bathing suit style that was considered risque at the time, according to the producer.\n\n\"One day,\" Arkoff continued, \"Walt calls me, and he's livid. He's holding our 'slick' (advertisement) in his hand, and he goes, 'What are you doing, putting Annette in a bikini like this?' I said, 'We're not putting Annette in a bikini.' Which we weren't.\"\n\nAdded Arkoff, laughing again: \"She had a nice form, but it wasn't what you'd call a bikini form.\"\n\nA supporting player in the beach party films was singer-actress Donna Loren, who appeared in four movies with Funicello. In a statement posted shortly after Funicello's death, Loren alluded to the fact that, for years, Funicello kept private her multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Funicello's symptoms began in 1987, while she was promoting \"Back to the Beach,\" her reunion film with Avalon.\n\nSaid Loren: \"Annette was someone I always looked up to from the first time I met her on 'The Mickey Mouse Club' in 1957. We had quite a history stemming from 'The Talent Roundup' to the beach party movies.\n\n\"In the early '80s, I got wind of a 'Back to the Beach' film and wrote a song. I called Annette to tell her about the song I had written for the movie and I could hear the gravelly sounds of her voice. In the moment, I thought, 'Too many cigarettes? Too many cocktails?'\n\n\"How was I to know that her body was already being invaded by MS and affecting the sound of her voice? To think that a graceful ballerina became afflicted with a paralyzing disease is a tragic irony.\"\n\nDiagnosis revealed\n\nFunicello went public with her diagnosis in 1992. When I spoke with Avalon in 1998, he wasn't sugar-coating the situation.\n\n\"It's not easy at all and it's not getting better,\" Avalon said.\n\n\"She's trying all kinds of things. She's just very brave and very strong, and trying to keep that wonderful attitude up, whatever happens. She's a sweetheart. She just keeps saying to me, 'I have this (MS) for a reason. I don't know why, but I have this for a reason.' \"\n\nFunicello's final credited project was the 1995 TV movie \"A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes: The Annette Funicello Story.\" The film starred Eva La Rue as Funicello; Avalon and Dick Clark played themselves. In one scene, unaware of Funicello's diagnosis, Avalon and Clark try to pressure La Rue's Funicello into going on tour. According to Avalon, filming the based-on-truth scene was emotional, and not in a good way.\n\n\"To relive that situation and to play this to another actress, and to relive the moments again, is pretty tough,\" Avalon said. \"I found it difficult.\"\n\nAvalon had no illusions that the beach party movies would have been as successful without Funicello. After all, the chemistry between him and Funicello fueled those silly movies, which were shot in about 15 days each, often in the winter on a cold Malibu beach. \"Frankie and Annette\" became a brand, a symbol — a final flicker of romantic innocence before the '60s gave way to hippies and \"free love.\"\n\n\"What mattered was, there was a close relationship between Frankie and Annette, and a young romance,\" Avalon said. \"And of course, they're friends. There was a purity to them. There were morals. The girls were on one side, the boys on the other. It just worked. It was just fun.\"\n\nMark Voger can be reached HERE.\n\nBONUS: FUNICELLO MOMENTS\n\nWalt Disney fretted for naught when his protege Annette Funicello donned a bathing suit for the \"beach party\" movies co-starring Frankie Avalon. Yes, the movies were all about S-E-X. No, Funicello's character, Didi, was not a wanton woman. As evidenced in the following excerpts, Funicello's Didi may have been virginal, but she was hardly naive ...\n\n• From \"Beach Party\" (1963):\n\nDidi: \"I want Frankie to think of me as more than just a girl.\"\n\nRhonda (Valora Noland): \"There's something else?\"\n\nDidi: \"Yes! A wife.\"\n\nRhonda: \"A wife? Didi, you're not even a woman.\"\n\nDidi: \"But I'm close, and I'm not getting any closer until I'm a wife.\"\n\n• From \"Bikini Beach\" (1964):\n\nFrankie: \"There's a moon out there and it's calling us.\"\n\nDidi: \"I don't hear anything.\"\n\nFrankie: \"Okay, the moon isn't calling, but the waves are. We can go sit by them until we get the message — while the children sleep.\"\n\nDidi: \"Frankie, you go listen to the moon and the waves. Until I hear wedding bells, I'm children, too.\"\n\n• From \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" (1965):\n\nFrankie (discussing skydiving): \"Just imagine that feeling.\"\n\nDidi: \"Yeah, like a bird. When do we start?\"\n\nFrankie: \"We?\"\n\nDidi: \"Well, sure. It'll be a new thrill up there.\"\n\nFrankie: \"Yeah, for me, but not for you. A girl's job is in the kitchen. At least until she learns how to cook a hot dog. Dinner was burnt.\"\n\nDidi: \"Women have a few rights, in case you haven't heard. We can even vote.\""
