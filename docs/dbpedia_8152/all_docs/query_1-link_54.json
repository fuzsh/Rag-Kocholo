        "text": "The last name of script supervisor Julie Pitkanen is misspelled in end credits as \"Pitkanin.\"\n\nBack to the Beach was a spoof and homage to the beach-themed movies of the 1960s. As described in a 3 Aug 1987 LAT article, the genre launched in 1963 with the release of Beach Party, (see entry) starring Frankie Avalon, a singer and teen idol, and Annette Funicello, a member of television’s popular Mickey Mouse Club (ABC, 3 Oct 1955--Sep 1959). Beach Party was followed by several sequels, including Muscle Beach Party (1964, see entry), Bikini Beach (1964, see entry), and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965, see entry). These Beach movies, which were released by American International Pictures (AIP), typically had micro-budgets and limited shooting schedules. Beach Party, for example, cost around $500,000 and took three weeks to film, as noted in the 10 Aug 1987 People magazine. Most of the beach-themed movies were filmed on a soundstage, according to the Jun 1987 Los Angeles magazine.\n\nAIP merged with Filmways, Inc. in 1979, and Orion Pictures Corporation purchased Filmways in 1982. Orion was not interested in doing a Beach sequel, but also refused to sell the rights when Avalon began pursuing such a project. Consequently, distributor Paramount Pictures was careful to say in a 5 Jul 1987 LAT article that Back to the Beach was not a sequel, but rather “parodies all beach movies.”\n\nAlthough Avalon’s character was named “Frankie” in the Beach movies, the failure to secure the rights to those movies meant they could not call his character “Frankie” in Back to the Beach, as reported in the Los Angeles article. Consequently, Avalon’s character is listed in the credits as “Annette’s husband” and is referred to in the film only as “The Big Kahuna.” Funicello’s character was named “Dolores” in Beach Party and “Dee Dee” in the sequels, but the writers chose to simply call her “Annette” in the movie.\n\nWhen Avalon first started pitching the idea for another beach-movie in the late 1970s, several studios were interested in doing a television movie-of-the-week reunion. However, Funicello and Avalon, who are credited as co-executive producers, held out for the big-screen. The 3 Dec 1981 DV announced that screenwriter Steve Silver was writing a beach sequel, titled The Last Beach Party, which was scheduled to begin shooting in summer 1982 with a Christmas 1982 release date. However, nothing came of that.\n\nBy 1983, the film’s title had changed to Beach Party Reunion, according to the 7 Jun 1983 DV. By 1984, the title changed again, this time to Beach Party ‘85, with a $3 million budget and an Oct 1984 start date, as reported in the 7 Jun 1984 DV. This project was also stillborn.\n\nIn 1986, Frank Mancuso, Jr. came aboard as producer and sold his father, Paramount Pictures chief Frank Mancuso, Sr., on the idea of making the movie. However, the studio rejected the script and only approved the film when James Komack joined the project as writer and director. However, Komack did not stay, telling the 5 Jul 1987 LAT that Paramount wanted a “campier” version of the film than he was interested in doing.\n\nAustralian director Lyndall Hobbs, who had previously directed music videos and documentary shorts, took over. It was her first time directing a feature-length film. Using the working title of Back to the Beach, principal photography began on 9 Feb 1987 in the Los Angeles, CA area, according to the 17 Mar 1987 HR production chart. The movie had a shooting schedule of approximately two months, a $10 million budget, and filmed most of its beach scenes in Malibu, CA, rather than on a soundstage, according to the 15 Apr 1987 LAT.\n\nDuring filming, problems with the script became apparent and many writers were brought in to do quick rewrites. By the time filming was completed, a total of seventeen writers were involved and more than $2 million had been spent on writers. The 2 Aug 1987 LAT reported that all seventeen of those writers wanted onscreen credit, but after Writers Guild of America (WGA) arbitration, only Peter Krikes, Steve Meerson, and Christopher Thompson received screenplay credit, while James Komack, B.W.L. Norton, and Bruce Kirschbaum received “story by” credit. The WGA also required the film to include the credit, “based on characters created by Lou Rusoff.” Rusoff was the writer of the original 1963 Beach Party. Writers who are reported to have worked on the script but did not receive onscreen credit included Jeff Buhia, Steve Zacharias, Robert Kauffman, and David Obst.\n\nBack to the Beach opened 7 Aug 1987 on 1,080 screens, earning $3.3 million in its first three days of release, according to the 11 Aug 1987 DV box office.\n\nEnd credits include the following acknowledgments: “The producers wish to express their appreciation to: Trans World Airlines; Galpin Ford; ‘The Mickey Mouse Club,’ courtesy of The Walt Disney Company; ‘The Dick Clark Show,’ clip courtesy of Dick Clark Media Archives, Inc.”\n\nLess\n\nIn Ohio, fifteen-year-old Bobby worries that his parents have lost their “coolness” and are now boring, conservative, middle-aged parents. Twenty-five years ago, his parents were teen idols. His father was a popular singer and surfing enthusiast known as “The Big Kahuna,” while his mother, Annette, used to be a Mouseketeer on a television show. However, after they got married and moved to Ohio, his father became a car salesman and bought Friendly Ford, the largest car dealership in Ohio. His mother became obsessed with shopping and feeds him Skippy peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day. Bobby tells his parents about their problem. Dad decides they will take a family vacation to Hawaii. During a ten-hour layover in Los Angeles, California, they go to visit their eighteen-year-old daughter, Sandi, who lives above a bait shop on a pier in Malibu, California. Sandi has not told her parents that she has been living with her boyfriend, Michael, for the past six months, so when they arrive at her door unannounced, Sandi throws Michael and his clothes out the window into the ocean. Dad suspects Sandi had a man in the apartment and goes to the beach to confront him. Dad accidentally knocks over a line of surfboards, provoking the ire of “Zed,” the head of a surfing gang. Zed says that he is “God” and Dad is a “sinner.” The family goes for a drive and sees their old hangout, Daddy-Os, where Dick Dale and the Del-Tones have been performing for the past twenty-five years. A young man named Troy flirts with Annette, provoking Dad’s anger. However, he calms down upon seeing his old flame, Connie, who now owns Daddy-Os. ...\n\nMore Less\n\nIn Ohio, fifteen-year-old Bobby worries that his parents have lost their “coolness” and are now boring, conservative, middle-aged parents.

A young man named Troy flirts with Annette, provoking Dad’s anger. However, he calms down upon seeing his old flame, Connie, who now owns Daddy-Os. Connie has a special display dedicated to The Big Kahuna, which flatters him. Before they leave for airport to catch their flight, Connie persuades Dad to perform a song. Once he takes off his coat and tie and begins singing “California Sun,” Dad begins to relax and unwind. Annette becomes jealous of Connie’s effect on her husband, but Connie tells her to calm down since she is the one who married him. Annette and her husband get into an argument and go their separate ways. Meanwhile, Michael and Sandi get into an argument and break up as well. Annette suggests that she and Sandi take their mind off their problems by having a pajama party, so Sandi invites her friends over. Meanwhile, Dad becomes intoxicated at Daddy-Os' bar and sleeps in a surf shack. When he wakes up with a hangover, Michael provides him a hangover cure, which helps Dad perk up. When Michael asks permission to marry Sandi, Dad becomes angry. However, upon learning that Michael is Connie’s son, he warms to the young man. Annette, Sandi, and Bobby spend the day on the beach. Bobby hangs out with one of the surf gangs, while Annette flirts with Troy, which makes Dad jealous. Dad compliments Zed on the custom surfboards he makes. Zed says he does not sell many boards, so Dad offers his expertise on sales and marketing. Dad suggests they should have a bonfire on the beach, but Michael says the harbor master will never give them a party permit for after dark. Nonetheless, they go see the harbor master, flatter him, and get the permit. Sandi becomes angry when she sees the bonfire and did not get an invitation. She confronts Michael and they make up. Annette sees Dad give Connie a hug and becomes jealous. She spends more time with Troy, even going surfing with him. When that fails to get the response from Dad that Annette wanted, she goes to Connie announcing she can have the man. Connie reports that Annette is the only thing Dad has talked about and that she should go get her man. Annette makes up with her husband. As a large crowd gathers around the bonfire, Dad explains that twenty years ago, he wiped out while riding a big wave, and was in a coma for several days. Consequently, he has not surfed since then. Bobby comes to the party after spending the day with the surfing gang. He announces he is now president of the gang and they used Dad’s credit cards to buy motorbikes. His gang is taking over the beach, but the others get angry. Dad suggests the only way to settle a territorial dispute is to have a “Surf Off.” Michael is supposed to be one of the surfers, but when he breaks his leg, Dad has to take his place. He initially has trouble and does poorly on his first wave. However, storm clouds move in, creating a giant wave, “The Humunga Cowabunga from Down Under.” Dad rides the wave expertly and wins the competition. Everyone celebrates the return of the Big Kahuna.\n\nLess"
