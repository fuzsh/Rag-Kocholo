        "text": "Return guest Vera (Episode 58 on Kenny Ortega) comes back to talk about real life Disney Princess Annette Funicello and the legacy of the Beach Party movies.\n\nYou can find four of the first five Beach Party movies available to stream for free on Pluto and the other movies are available on various other platforms.\n\nThe API Beach Party movies have been almost completely forgotten today but they were a massive phenomenon from 1963-1965. Frankie Avalon (Philadelphia native) and Annette Funicello (who hated the beach) became the face of the Southern California surf craze and even actors in minor roles, like Jody McCrea (who played the resident himbo Deadhead/Big Lunk/Bonehead) would get mobbed at appearances. The book I keep referencing in the episode is Thomas Lisanti’s Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies (2005) and it’s not only an entertaining read but essential reading for anybody looking to delve further into the genre.\n\nAs I say in the episode, the Beach Party movies were riding the growing wave of a nationwide Southern California surf craze via films like Gidget (1959) and Endless Summer (1966) articles in Life Magazine, and the music of groups like the Beach Boys and Jan and Dean. The upbeat Southern California teen culture represented by the Beach Movies was overwritten by the San Francisco Love and Peace hippie culture by the late 1960s and today the Beach Party movies live on mostly as a echo captured in the film version of Grease (1978), the opening credits of which recall the goofy Hot Curl of Muscle Beach Party (1964) and which features Frankie Avalon as the divine Angel of “Beauty School Dropout.”\n\n(L: Rizzo (Stockard Channing) with her stuffed animal lover in “Look At Me I’m Sandra Dee”; R: Connie (Annette Funicello) with her stuffed animal lover in “Stuffed Animal”)"
