With special appearances by Bob Denver, Tony Dow, Pee-Wee Herman, Jerry Mathers and other familiar faces. Frankie and Annette grow up and have kids in the midwest. They return to LA to visit their daughter who is shacked up with her boyfriend and tries to hide the fact. They begin to have marriage problems when Frankie runs into Connie, who has erected a shrine to him in her night club. Their punk son has joined up with the local surf toughs, and things all come to a head when the toughs challenge the good guys to a surfing duel",

        "text": "The first time I watched Back to the Beach, I wasn’t expecting it to be as offbeat and tonally wacky as it is. The second time I watched Back to the Beach, I had forgotten how offbeat and tonally wacky it is, so I was consistently surprised again, much to my wife’s delight.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* The Paperboy from Better Off Dead* gets a sizeable part as one of Frankie and Annette’s children, who at one point joins a surfing gang (who look like Road Warrior cast members) and has an unhealthy infatuation with his switchblade comb, regularly flicking it at people in an aggressive manner. I call bullshit on this. Anyone who grew up in the mid to late…\n\nI can't remember the last film I saw their names in the opening credits, but I'm going to assertively (and preemptively ) say that Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins are the best casting directors of all time. (If anyone decides to do a women's casting directors series of reviews, I'm all for it!)\n\nI also want to thank Aya for misidentifying Connie Stevens, because I had to check to see who the character was (she plays a fictional version of herself, of course). On IMDb, under her popular films, I saw Mulholland Drive there, but when I looked at her film credits, Mulholland Drive wasn't there. I was like, huh? It was just there! So I searched and found out…\n\nSandi (Lori Loughlin) is currently living with her boyfriend at a beautiful place on the pier. He's got one complaint. For whatever reason, Sandi loves leaving the soap on the shower floor, which makes it get gross, squishy, and then it disappears! It was her boyfriend's favorite soap on a rope, but now all that's left is a rope.\n\nFrankie makes fun of a scary-looking punk surfer gang:\n\nBack in my day, a surfboard was about 9 feet long, weighed about 50lbs. Not like this sissy job. Yeah, it took a real man to handle one of those babies. You know, I think the sport has become a little bit effeminate, don't you think?\n\nThen after the leader of this…\n\nSummer of '88. Cable. Every single time it was on. I love it.\n\nI spent that summer at my mom's boyfriend's place in a bad neighborhood and in his liquor store. High Spirits Liquors. I was 9 and just watched TV and played in that store all summer. I watched this, Predator, Gleaming the Cube and a few others all the time. I had all of the ALF dolls that Burger King was giving away next door to the store. I played Nerf mini golf on the roof. I had a lot of good adventurous summers but that one... The loneliest most friendless one I ever had... that one made me who I am today. I learned how to enjoy…\n\nI think I saw a thing but I don't know what thing I thought I saw.\n\nFrankie and Annette are back tot he beach! But it's the 80s rather than the 60s. Times have changed! They play fictional versions of their real-life selves. In Back to the Beach, they're married, and their song introduces us to them by showing archival footage from their movies. They're no longer idols like they used to. They're in their 40s and have your typical boring adult jobs. They forgot how to have fun, like all adults seem to do.\n\nTheir son, Bobby, is a plaid pants- leather jacket-wearing punk who should not have switchblades or switchblade combs. He also hates peanut butter. This young…"
