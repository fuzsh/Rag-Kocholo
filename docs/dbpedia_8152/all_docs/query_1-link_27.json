        "text": "Day 13: Back to the Beach (1987)\n\nI am a HUGE Frankie and Annette beach party film fan. It is no surprise that I simply LOVE the 80’s reunion of the classic beach duo. The soundtrack is also the only place to find Fishbone’s Jamaca Ska! No summer is complete without some sort of Frankie & Annette film whether it be a classic Beach Party, Muscle Beach Party, Bikini Beach, Pajama Party, Beach Blanket Bingo, How to Stuff a Wild Bikini, Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine, or Ghost in the Invisible Bikini. Summer is the best time to go Back to the Beach.\n\nThe Cast\n\nThe old beach duo have hung up their surfboards and joined suburban life. When the opportunity to visit their daughter arises the two set out to prove they can still have fun on the beach. Annette Funicello plays Annette. Frankie Avalon is billed as Annette’s husband. This is due to the studio owning the name Frankie for his character since the film was made by a different studio. Instead they just call him the Big Kahuna, which is a reference to Gidget, which the studio could get rights to.\n\nPlaying their rocker son and the film’s narrative is Demian Slade as Bobby. Salde was in John Cusack’s Better Off Dead… Thier daughter Sandi is played by Full House’s Lori Loughlin. Playing Sandi’s boyfriend is Tommy Hinkley as Michael.\n\nBesides the main cast, there are tons of cameos. Pee Wee Herman and the Skipper and Gilligan make a special appearance in the film. Not to mention Dick Dale and Stevie Ray Vaughan both appear in the film playing the classic beach tune Pipeline. Dale was in the original Beach Party film playing the first dance number in the movie. Beaver himself Jerry Mathers and his on screen mom Barbara Billingsley and brother Tony Dow also have a cameo as do Get Smart’s Don Adams, singer and actress Connie Stevens and Edd Byrnes. Even O. J. Simpson has a small cameo. And legendary singer and sometimes actor David Bowie also appears in the film. And of course no 80’s Hollywood production is authentic without a cameo from Rodney Bingenheimer aka Rodney on the ROQ; especially if it has to do with music or feature musicians.\n\nTrivia\n\nIt was the last film Bob Denver (from Gilligain’s Island) did.\n\nAnnette opens a kitchen cabinet and replaces two jars of peanut butter on a shelf filled with nothing but Skippy peanut butter (10 jars). Annette was the star of a series of television commercials for Skippy peanut butter at the time. (The other shelves are similarly strangely stocked: the top shelf is nothing but Heinz ketchup (16 bottles), while the next is nothing but Campbell’s soup (29 cans)).\n\nAfter filming was completed, Annette Funicello was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She died in 2013 from complications to the disease.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBack to the Beach is a prefect reunion film for those who loved the Beach Party films of the 60’s. It is also a landmark film because it is the last Frankie & Annette beach movie. The amount of cult references and cameos only strengthen’s the movie’s awesomeness. It is simply a smorgasbord of wild times that would only happen in a Frankie & Annette movie."
