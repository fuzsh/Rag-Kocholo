        "text": "Mickey Mouse Club\n\nWhen she was 12 years old, Funicello was discovered by Walt Disney while performing in a production of Swan Lake as the Swan Queen. Disney cast her as one of the original \"Mouseketeers,” and one of the few cast-members to be personally selected by Disney himself. By the end of the first season of The Mickey Mouse Club, Funicello was reportedly receiving 6,000 letters a month.\n\nHawainnette\n\nFunicello, despite being uncomfortable with being defined as a singer, had a number of pop record hits in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including \"Tall Paul\" \"First Name Initial,\" \"O Dio Mio,\" \"Train of Love\" and \"Pineapple Princess.\" They were released by Disney's Buena Vista label.\n\nBack to the Beach\n\nFunicello and Avalon reunited in 1987 for Back to the Beach, which was an open parody of the 1960s beach party movies that they helped to make popular. Siskel and Ebert gave the film “two thumbs up.”"
