Tegan and Sara (left to right) at Town Hall, Friday, October 30th.

Longtime blog readers will know that one of my favorite albums of the past few years has been Tegan & Sara’s The Con. (In fact, the Canadian twin duo graced my very first Music Blogger column in our September 2007 issue.)

So for that reason, I’ve been excited about T&S’s new album, Sainthood, which came out last Tuesday, and extra-pumped for their show at Town Hall last Friday.

On Friday, the pair played a long set, heavy on new tunes from Sainthood, their sixth studio album. The new songs sounded great and I was glad to hear some old favorites from _The Con _and before, like "Where Does the Good Go," "Nineteen," and "Knife Going In."

Here’s the full setlist, (courtesy of setlist.fm)::
