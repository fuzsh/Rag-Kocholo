        "text": "Despite being one of the biggest names in pop music today, Lana Del Rey has generally managed to keep a low profile when it comes to her rumored romances and relationships.\n\nThroughout her career, the “A&W” singer has been romantically linked to fellow musicians, industry insiders, and even a reality TV cop. Today, as far as the public knows, she is single.\n\nIn an interview for Harper’s Bazaar’s December 2023/January 2024 cover story, the Grammy nominee opened up about her love life.\n\n“I’m definitely not in love right now. No,” she said. “Absolutely not in love. Have been, but no.” She added, “It hasn’t crossed my mind in the last five months on the road or here yet. But give it a week. My history, sure, it’s coming for me at some point. Yeah. It would be interesting if it didn’t.”\n\nRead ahead for a deep dive into Del Rey's complete dating history.\n\nEvan Winiker (2022–2023)\n\nWhile it’s unknown when Del Rey started dating Winiker, they first sparked romance rumors after attending the Malibu Chili Cook-Off together in September 2022. In March 2023, Billboard reported that the two were engaged, but Del Rey eventually confirmed her single status in an interview for Bazaar’s December 2023/2024 issue.\n\nLike Del Rey, Winiker has a career in the music industry. He joined Range Media Partners in 2021 as an artist-manager, bringing a host of clients from his previous agency, Full Stop Management, including Max, Daya, the Disco Biscuits, Skyler Stonestreet, and Walk Off the Earth. He also previously played in indie-rock band Steel Train alongside music producer Jack Antonoff.\n\nJack Donoghue (2022)\n\nDonoghue, a member of rock band Salem, sparked rumors he was involved with Del Rey after he posted a video of the two of them at a monster truck race on his Instagram Story in early 2022. In the clip, the singer can be heard referring to Donoghue as “babe.”\n\nIn July 2022, he continued fueling those rumors by posting a picture of himself and Del Rey outside of Chicago’s Cook County Department of Corrections facility. He simply captioned the post, “family visit.”\n\nClayton Johnson (2020–2021)\n\nAfter they reportedly met on a dating app, Del Rey got engaged to Johnson, a member of musical brother trio the Johnsons, according to People. Throughout their courtship, the couple often flaunted PDA-filled pictures of each other on social media and were seen out and about with each other on several occasions. They even coordinated Halloween costumes, with Del Rey dressing up as Dorothy and Johnson as the scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz.\n\nHowever, by the fall of 2021, the two had seemingly split up, and Johnson deleted posts featuring Del Rey from his Instagram account.\n\nSean Larkin (September 2019–March 2020)\n\nDel Rey and Larkin—a cop and a reality TV star from the Emmy-winning documentary series Live PD—confirmed their romance when paparazzi snapped photos of them on a Central Park date in September 2019. Del Rey addressed the fledgling romance in an interview with the Los Angeles Times the following month: “I didn’t know we were being photographed. I would’ve worn something different.”\n\nAfter that, the two graced multiple red carpets with their presence, with Del Rey even bringing Larkin as her plus-one to the 62nd Grammy Awards. But by March 2020, the relationship was over.\n\n“Right now, we’re just friends,” Larkin revealed that month in an interview with . “We still talk and whatnot, we just have busy schedules right now.”\n\nG-Eazy (April–August 2017)\n\nDel Rey reportedly had a brief fling with rapper G-Eazy, whom she was first spotted with in April 2017 at Coachella. A month later, the two were photographed clubbing together in Hollywood. But by the time August rolled around, his relationship with fellow musician Halsey became official, marking the end of his romance with Del Rey.\n\nWhile not much is known about the duo’s time together, fans have speculated that G-Eazy was dissing Del Rey on his 2020 track with Jack Harlow, “Moana.” The lyrics go: “I know a Keisha and I know Lana / They try to get me back, but I’m like, ‘No, nah, nah’ / I’m sorry, I don’t want no drama / Nah, that’s a hard no, pass.”\n\nFrancesco Carrozzini (July 2014–November 2015)\n\nDel Rey’s romance with Carrozzini, an Italian director and photographer, became public knowledge in July 2014, after paparazzi captured photos of the two spending time together in Portofino, Italy.\n\nCarrozzini reportedly told Turkish outlet Hürriyet Kelebek that he moved from New York to Los Angeles for seven months to be with Del Rey. “We have a quiet, isolated life in Los Angeles. We are in our own world,” he said at the time.\n\nSources later confirmed their breakup had occurred by November 2015.\n\nBarrie-James O’Neill (2011–2014)\n\nDel Rey began dating O’Neill, a Scottish singer-songwriter, in 2011. She talked about writing music with and about him in a 2012 interview with Just Jared.\n\n“When I met my boyfriend … we always say that the entire time we were writing for each other, but we didn’t know it until we met each other,” she said. “So, you feel like even though you didn’t know the person then, all the songs are for them now. That’s romantic.”\n\nIn 2013, O’Neill’s band, Kassidy, opened for Del Rey on her Paradise Tour. That same year, they sparked engagement rumors after Del Rey was seen wearing a massive diamond ring on her ring finger. But the following year, she revealed they were no longer together.\n\n“We are currently not together,” the singer told Swiss newspaper 20 Minuten. “He is a wonderful person. But there are some things he has to deal with. I will not explain it in detail. This was hard on our relationship. I no longer felt free.”\n\nDespite their split, the two seem to have remained on friendly terms. O’Neill is even credited as a producer and collaborator on Del Rey’s eighth studio album, Blue Banisters, which dropped in October 2021."
