        "text": "The GLAAD Media Awards, which honor media figures for “fair, accurate and inclusive representations” of LGBTQ communities, have announced their 2017 nominees. Frank Ocean, Tegan and Sara, Blood Orange, Lady Gaga, Sia, and Against Me! are among the 10 nominees for Outstanding Music Artist, a category that has doubled in size to reflect “growing inclusion in music,” Billboard reports. Also up for awards are Moonlight (Outstanding Film, Wide Release) and “Black Mirror’”s “San Junipero” (Outstanding Individual Episode, in a TV series without a regular LGBTQ character). See the full nominees list here.\n\nRead about Tegan and Sara’s LGBTQ foundation, and see their episode of Pitchfork.tv’s “Over/Under”:"
