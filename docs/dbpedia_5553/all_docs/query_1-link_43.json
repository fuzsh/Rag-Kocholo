        "text": "Since picking up guitars at age 15, Sara & Tegan Quin, twin sisters from Calgary, Alberta, have consistently grown as songwriters and performers to a unique spot where they can collaborate with DJs like David Guetta, tour with the likes of Neil Young (and, currently, FUN), and see their latest album debut at #3 on the Billboard 200—yet still be considered icons of indie music.\n\nThe sisters Skyped us from the back of their tour bus a few days ago when it was parked in Lake Tahoe, California: their first time performing there.\n\nSince you're twins, you probably have similar morning routines, right?\n\nSara: If I’m at home, I like to get out of bed between 8:30 and 9 a.m., and I will force myself to go for a run. If I wait too long, I won't.\n\nTegan: I wake up really slowly. Between 8 and 10 a.m. I milk it for all it's worth, and when I get up I like to spend at least an hour in silence. I read the news during that time. We’re pretty up on the news. I don’t drink coffee, so Sara says I’m grumpy,\n\nSara: I drink coffee, so I get up with the addict’s desire. Always black coffee. I’ll drink anything that looks and smells like coffee—that’s how I know I’m hooked. When I’m home right now I love Joe in New York City, I love Blue Bottle, I’m in that whole \"hipsters paying $5.50 for an Americano\" group.\n\nHow different are things when you’re on the road?\n\nSara: On the road, the key is 8 hours of sleep. Sometimes I will wait for the assistant road manager to make the coffee before I get out of bed. My late nights are not party nights—they are marathon nights of watching Shameless on the bus.\n\nTegan: Most mornings I just lay in my bunk until everyone’s off the bus.\n\nSara: I think that’s why our morning rituals are the way they are, out of respect, to stay out of the way, when we’re on the bus. Morning is the time to do errands and tasks, and run, and catch up on podcasts. I love Fresh Air, This American Life, Alec Baldwin, The Moth, The Grantland podcast, Andy Greenwald.\n\nWhat about songwriting? Does anyone touch a guitar?\n\nTegan: Not for me. Most of my songwriting happens in the afternoons and evenings. It’s like it’s still the hobby that I wont let myself indulge in until work is done.\n\nWhat does breakfast look like?\n\nSara: On the road it will either be fruit or cereal—something light to save space for the 3–4 cups of coffee. At home, maybe a scramble.\n\nTegan: On tour, we have English muffins, so I’ll eat peanut butter and jam, which I’d never eat at home. At home I have a smoothie. All we do is graze all day, so we must burn a lot of calories onstage.\n\nDo you have one of those obnoxiously difficult rock star “riders” for snacks backstage?\n\nSara: It’s a very specific list; it’s pretty healthy: We have Pop Chips, there’s a lot of fruits and vegetables, there’s a lot of blueberries being consumed… We’re fairly monastic. We’re all those 30-somethings trying to preserve our health. But what’s become amazing for us on the road is getting to go to amazing restaurants in every city on a day off. One that’s sticking out is Chin Chin in Melbourne; we were just in New York, and I went to Charlie Bird—that was one of the best meals I ate in a long time. I don’t do red meat. Tegan’s a little more health conscious—\n\nTegan: I just don’t eat cheese, and if I do red meat, it has to be somewhere really nice. Like I can meet the cow. We all went to India and got a parasite so we’re careful.\n\nOther than getting to collaborate with Taylor Swift, what kind of effect has your new level of popularity had on you?\n\nTegan: I think it's elevated the importance of our band in people’s eyes, which we’re not used to. But we’re so caught up in the middle of it, so it’s hard to know what impact we’re having. So I’m not sure Sara and I are so invested in it. But it’s nice to see so many new faces [at the shows] and they seem so invested already, and fitting in really well with the audience we’ve already established. So far so good.\n\nYou’ve been performing together for a long time now: has either one of you ever gotten the urge to “go solo\"?\n\n[In unison]: Nooo!!\n\nSara: Our motto is “share the burden.”"
