Below, sister duo Tegan and Sara – whose Tegan and Sara Foundation fights for LGBTQ girls and women – share theirs. Read more Pride Month love letters here.\n\nThe older we get the more significant Pride becomes for us. Taking time to celebrate our community — while also honoring and mourning LGBTQ people past, present, and future — is so important. This is why Pride is still so significant no matter how far we have come as a community.\n\nLGBTQ people are vibrant, beautiful, vast and valuable. Taking the time to show up and stand with our fellow LGBTQ friends, families and community members, as well as our allies, is how we continue to reflect to the world how wonderful we all are! While we are living in challenging and sometimes scary times, the experience of spending time with many leading LGBTQ organizations and activists in this country has continued to give us confidence in the future.\n\nThis year we are going to take time during Pride to learn more about our early LGBTQ history, because more than ever before it’s important we amplify those stories. We hope each and every LGBTQ person has a wonderful Pride, and let’s take time together to reflect on how far we’ve come, how far we have to go, how strong we are, and how proud we should be to be LGBTQ."
