        "text": "With an intimate, oft-minimalistic sound and almost stream of consciousness lyrics Buzz is an album for letting go of control and the learned behaviors of perfectionism in the favor of self-awareness, where NIKI processes \"a spectrum of world weariness, of excitement, of joy and pain and all the moments in between.\"\n\n\"Buzz\" is where she finds herself anew. She takes her time mulling over the hard questions on \"Nothing Can\", allows herself to grieve the loss of a great love on \"Paths\", breaks the cycle of generational trauma on \"Strong Girl\" and \"Heirloom Pain\", and learns that there is \"freedom in accepting that everything is just incomplete and messy all the time.\"\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nWhen I was reading about the album, it appeared that you faced an identity crisis while making it. Do you feel satisfied with it or are you anxious about how people will receive it?\n\nI think it's both. Anytime I'm on the cusp of releasing something, I'm always a little bit nervous as to how people are going to receive it. At the same time, I feel like I made this record with full conviction in myself and in my artistry.\n\nI think this is really the first time that I'm able to say that. I steered the making of this record myself.\n\nA lot of the songs on 'Buzz' felt like waves, with a very natural flow and progression to the songs on the album. It felt like you were giving into a feeling or embracing something. Did you allow yourself to feel [this flow] or did you have a concrete vision?\n\nBuzz was the first album that I made that I didn't actually have a concrete vision in mind. It was just an organic synthesis of what's been happening over the past two years.\n\nTwo years ago I started headline touring, and that inspired a lot of the album. Just this feeling of constantly being on the go, being uprooted time and time again, so the theme of acceptance is a huge one on this album. The acceptance of life being a constant state of uncertainty. We, as people, are constantly developing and irresolute. So this album was kind of made to process those feelings.\n\nIt’s an album of nuance, of nestling into this area of gray that we so often wrestle with in life. I definitely tend to see things as black and white. I was raised to think that way, with my Indonesian upbringing. My mom was very religious, so I think this album is about unlearning a lot of that stuff, taking what serves you from childhood and letting go of what doesn't, and embracing that things will feel messy very often.\n\nYet you ended the album itself on a very hopeful note. Was that intentional?\n\nAbsolutely. Sometimes I joke that the universe has its foot on my neck right now. But I think, in general, I'm quite an optimistic person, or at least I try to be. I gravitate towards art or music that tends to skew that way, because I think we all need a little bit of hope in this very difficult, scary world.\n\nThe record ends with \"Nothing Can.\" I love that song, because it's a blend of optimism, but also it's just telling it as it is. Like, nothing and no one will be able to save you and I think that was an important thing that I had to teach myself.\n\nGrowing up, you watch a lot of movies and so much of media is like, somebody's going to come swooping in knight in shining armor-style and maybe rescue you. Or a job will save you from your pain or the perfect fill-in-the-blank is gonna be the answer. That's impossible. You are responsible for your own happiness. What \"Nothing Can\" is about is that despite the mess and the suffering and the pain there are still moments in between that make everything worthwhile.\n\nDid you go through a similar process of realization when it comes to making music? A moment where you thought, 'Maybe I'm expecting my career to make me happy but it should be the other way around?'\n\nHow do I eloquently say this? It's like... before Buzz, and even before Nicole, the way I perceived making music was like aceing assignments. I think I had always been a little bit of an overachiever. Buzz was my first real, true exercise in just writing and making art just to make art for myself versus to fulfill expectations. I found a lot of artistic healing through making this album because it was the first time I really kind of put my head down and was like: I'm going to make an album for myself in a way that I want and that feels authentic.\n\nI realized quickly that every time I hit a milestone, I would aspire for the next milestone. And then there's always sky above sky — that is what my mom always told me. There is always something more to aspire to. So you really have to find peace and joy within yourself in order to show up the way you want to in your life. I wrote Buzz, just to help myself let go of the perfectionist streak.\n\nSo, if you were to describe the relationship between 'Nicole' and 'Buzz' knowing what you do now, what would you call it?\n\nI have fondly nicknamed Buzz Nicole's older, wiser sister. Nicole walked so that Buzz could run. Nicole was a very diaristic window into my past and Buzz is very much rooted in my present. Nicole is about the subject matter that's important to you when you're 17, like your first ever breakup with your first love that feels so cataclysmic and earth-shattering. That's no longer relevant to me the same way that things are happening in my 20s now.\n\nNicole was also sonically a lot more pop. On Buzz, I was inspired by a lot of artists. Obviously Joni Mitchell, and a current artist that I really love that I feel like echoes Joni Mitchell is Madison Cunningham. I am so inspired by her musicianship and guitar playing specifically. It made me think: I would want to have an album that I'd be so stoked to play every single night for however long on tour and I never get sick of these songs. Buzz is more musical, and there is a looseness to it that I feel Nicole lacked.\n\nI also remember you saying in an interview that back when you wrote 'Nicole,' you went very heavy on imagery and metaphors. In contrast, 'Buzz' is still poetic, but very rooted in practicality. Do you think that's a natural consequence of growing up, and dealing with the realization that once life has hit us in the face, we don't prefer not to look at things with rosy lenses?\n\n[Laughs.] I think it is a natural consequence of growing up. I think Nicole was so unapologetically schmaltzy. The way I wrote, I definitely cringe now because, you know, it's that 17-year-old drama. Everything feels so blown up out of proportion when you're 17, right? It was so emotional. The way I write [now] is totally different because there's a big dose of practicality and pragmatism in the way I perceive things. I think it's a lot more emotionally healthier to balance emotion and reason, than having emotions just completely drown reason.\n\nBuzz, specifically, is very much a reflection of the kind of writing that I gravitate to now, which is a lot less like \"My world is going to end because you're leaving.\" Because you know when you're 25, you don't really necessarily feel that anymore. I feel that's really obvious in songs like \"Take Care\" and \"Paths\" where it is an older kind of love. A significant relationship of mine ended, and I still very much have only respect and love for this person and also wanting the best for them. I feel like, on Nicole, it was all so punitive. It was like, \"You must be punished for how you hurt me!\"\n\nWas there anything that helped you learn to deal with things in this way? I did read that the album also contains some lessons that you learned in therapy.\n\nTherapy has had a direct link to this record. Therapy has been transformative in the way I think and therefore the way I think shapes the way I write, and the way I write shapes the album that I make.\n\nFor example, I call \"Heirloom Pain\" and \"Nothing Can\" my \"radical acceptance\" songs. That was a term that I learnt through therapy. Radical acceptance does not mean demeaning your grief or repressing your pain. Radical acceptance is saying, This really sucks, but I'm going to respond to this in a different way. Without therapy, I probably would still be writing very punitive schmaltzy Nicole songs.\n\nI think everything can be processed, though! I feel like Buzz has a balance. I feel like I'm still pretty petty on \"Colossal Loss\" and \"Focus\" is just shade central.\n\n\"Focus\" really made me think you must be in your 'I'm not your therapist\" era.\n\nExactly, I'm in my \"no clowns\" era. [Laughs.]\n\nRadical acceptance makes a lot of sense. \"Heirloom Pain\" has this keen realization that our parents did their best, and they're only human, so you can't really blame them.\n\nI think it humanizes everybody in [your family tree] that came before you, and at the very end, I flip it around onto [the listener] and [the song says] \"You're gonna fall in love and f— up too.\"\n\nWe are born and everyone does the same thing over and over. We never learn! But at the same time, it doesn't shy away from the genuine pain and trauma. I literally called out my dad's temper and my mom's mistakes. Sometimes I'm like, 'Why did you guys not think about this before you had kids?' [Laughs.]\n\nAs you grow up…your parents kind of fall off the pedestal, you start to get on their level. You see them as humans.\n\nThis is such a primitive album for you in some ways. What was the recording process for this like?\n\nWhen I am in work mode, I don't always feel it. If I'm singing a painful song, usually that hits me a little bit later. When I recorded \"Paths,\" that was basically a one-take thing that I did in my own studio at home. I remember just singing through the whole song for the first time, and at one point in the middle, I choked. I started to tear up because I felt so emotionally moved.\n\nWith this album specifically, I've learned my methods. I never do more than three takes, especially for vocals. If I do more than three takes, it starts to... you know the feeling of when you look at a word too long and the word doesn't look like a word anymore? When I sing the same thing too many times, I start to not feel it anymore. [\"Paths\"] felt like exposure therapy. I wrote the thing that I was really scared to write and then I was singing it.\n\nIt's interesting you say that you don't like singing your songs on repeat. What is your relationship with touring like then? Does it get exhausting performing the same song or set over and over?\n\nTouring is definitely a different beast. I feel like it's more important to get the right take when you're recording an album, because an album is forever. A show is different every single night. To be completely honest, sometimes as a performer, if you do it so many times like it's muscle memory. You can slip into autopilot over time. The constantly changing variable on tour is the crowd. So whatever is happening in the crowd is usually enough to inject a newness to the show.\n\nI also wrote Buzz for this reason. I wanted an album that felt looser and felt more relaxed even in its DNA so that when I go on tour, I can play it as loosely as possible to create space for variety.\n\nIt also feels like you've learned to be more accepting. Your recordings used to be a fairly solitary affair but now you've actively started involving more people in it.\n\nI definitely ventured out into involving more collaborators and it's not just me and my laptop and headphones anymore, but I definitely still am very selective with who I let into my musical universe, because I have a specific vision of how I want things to sound, and what kind of environments I work best in.\n\nThe way I like to work is that I start a skeletal framework for [a song], I produce it a little bit, record some parts. Then I call a producer that I respect, who I've seen work on my other favorite artists and then I give them that framework and then we finish it together. I worked with Ethan Gruska, who worked with Phoebe Bridgers, and Tyler Chester – who helped me produce \"Strong Girl\" – worked on all of Madison Cunningham's stuff. It's really fun to keep the circle small.\n\nA lot of songs on 'Buzz', like \"Blue Moon,\" \"Paths\" and \"Magnets\" talk about putting faith in a higher power.\n\nI grew up very religious. My mom was a singer at church, so God was always an integral concept growing up. I wouldn't call myself a Christian now, but I definitely still believe in something greater than all of us. Julia Cameron, who wrote The Artist's Way, said: \"God can be God to you, or it can stand for Good Orderly Direction.\" I think it is a beautiful way of thinking about it.\n\nI definitely am also an astrology girlie. I do believe that we were all made with intention. I do think there's a great creator out there and I believe that there is something out there — the universe, God, whatever you want to call it — that's guiding us or has our best interest.\n\nDo you like revisiting your past stuff? I ask this because it feels like with every new album, you have proverbially wiped the slate clean.\n\nI will literally listen to my work or my music a million times before it's out. And then once it's out, I rarely ever revisit it.I almost see it as yours; it's the world’s now. It's ours. It's not something that I have been intentional about. Even when I had a YouTube channel when I was 15, I did this. I would watch my video and edit it five million times. And then as soon as I uploaded it, I never watched it again.\n\nI guess I do this to process my life as it's happening. Once it's shared, it's difficult for me to view it as just my own anymore. That's why every time I move on to a new project it feels like a completely different thing, because I never look at my past work. I never draw from that as an inspiration. I look forward instead.\n\nListening to \"Imminent Redemption\" conjured a mental image of shaking up a two-liter bottle of Coca-Cola; You want to rock out, explosively, and you finally get to do it.\n\nTo me, it feels like a follow-up to Ritual. The band right now is in such a great place. We have the original lineup. God bless Chris Chaney, who's one of the best bass players in the world, one of my best friends. He stood in and he did two records with us,15, 20 years.\n\nA lot of the Jane's Addiction material is primarily written from basslines Eric Avery comes up with, and those are usually the memorable singable parts of the song. You might sing the vocal, but you're not singing the guitar part. Sometimes you're not singing the vocal part, but you're singing the intro to \"Mountain [Song]\" in your head, or the intro to \"Three Days.\" His input is really the musical backbone of the band. When we got together to do these [new] songs, that was immediately there.\n\nWe also wanted to keep the music under-produced. We didn't want to go crazy with modern-day technology and all kinds of crazy instrumentation, overdubs and tracks; we wanted to keep it pretty raw. In fact, I think there's parts of \"Imminent Redemption\" that are reminiscent of Ritual and Nothing Shocking, but I also think it's reminiscent of the Triple X record [1987’s Jane’s Addiction] because there aren't 15 guitar tracks. There aren't synths, there aren't all kinds of things that we ended up doing as we went on and probably will do on other songs.\n\nLyrically, Perry's coming from such a... I don't want to speak for him, but my interpretation is that it's an aggressive cry for unity and peace. There's a little bit of anger there, but anger in the name of let's not have any anger anymore, if that makes any sense.\n\nIt does.\n\nAnother weird thing about Jane's Addiction is a lot of our most well-known songs — \"Mountain Song,\" \"Stop,\" \"Ocean Size,\" \"Jane Says\" — they really don't have choruses. They just, say, have two parts to go back and forth.\n\nSo the fact that we got away with \"Imminent\" and we're able to put a chorus in there is kind of unusual. But I think it works, and it still kind of keeps it like the two-part formula of Jane's Addiction. But then the outro goes into another musical direction, which is also very us, because we get bored within songs.\n\nDo you think \"Imminent Redemption\" will grow into a record?\n\nThere might be stuff I can't talk about, but no one's told me not to talk about it, so that's their problem, I guess!\n\nThe idea is to release a full-length album; I would consider it the fourth Jane's Addiction record. The two records we did with Chris Chaney I love, but it's a different band. With this lineup, I really feel like this next record's going to be the follow-up to Ritual. It's really special to be back with Eric and writing with Eric; Eric and I have always worked really well off each other in terms of finding parts that work together and complement one another but are not really the same.It's like we picked up just where we left off.\n\nI don't know if we're going to put out a record or if we're going to put out a song every once in a while. Whatever that master plan is, that I can't speak to. It's either a song comes out every month until there's 12 songs, or we put out a couple songs and then we put out the record. I don't know. We have plenty of completed material already, so it's one way or another it'll all be out there.\n\nA \"follow-up record\" more than 30 years later…\n\nIn some ways, it was such a shame for the band to part at such a musical peak, because I think that record [Ritual] is really, really special. But it also saved us from following it up with something subpar. So it is just part of the legacy. It's part of the story. And so far I've been really happy with everything we've been making.\n\nHow has it felt being back on the road?\n\nWe just finished a two-month tour of Europe, and I was so grateful to be back out, and doing it with the band, and being able to do it. But man, it was challenging.\n\nIt still has that [feel of] the early days, where we were on this edge of this cliff where nobody really knew what was going to happen from time to time, from song to song, in between songs, what Perry was going to say or do. Or if he was going to all of a sudden just go into some stream-of-consciousness banter in the middle of a breakdown of a song. And you just kind of have to pay attention and just feel where it's going to change.\n\nWe kind of lost that for a long time. And now that element of surprise has come back to the shows. Also, I think the fact that this last tour was just the four of us on stage with minimal to no production, a couple of lights and four guys playing weird music, that's all we needed. It left room for there to be magical moments that gave you goosebumps because you weren't distracted by a bunch of stuff.\n\nThe Garza brothers have built their success through belief in one another. It paid off early on, when San Angelo, Texas club owner John R. Steele hired the group as his house band (and later became LLB's road manager). They also supported their musician father before branching out as a trio. In 2003, they struck gold when they got the opportunity to record their self-titled debut album at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Recording Studio in Austin.\n\nReleased in 2004, Los Lonely Boys' lead single, \"Heaven,\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard adult contemporary chart and reached the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The following year, the song took home a golden gramophone for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\n\nTheir success allowed them the chance to collaborate with the other musicians. Los Lonely Boys partnered with Santana on 2005's \"I Don’t Wanna Lose Your Love,\" performed with Ronnie Milsap on an episode of \"CMT's Crossroads,\" and released music with Dr. John, Enrique Garza Sr. and Willie Nelson. LLB also released a string of popular studio albums, including 2006’s Sacred, 2008’s Forgiven, 2011’s Rockpango, and 2013’s Revelation.\n\nRecorded in part at Henry’s home studio in Texas, Resurrection finds the trio continuing to channel their love of making music together. Their unique sound continues on the album, featuring everything from the Beatles-eque pop of \"Wish You Would\" to the smooth R&B and soulfulness of \"Dance With Me.\"\n\nFamily continues to be important for the brothers. The album comes at a challenging period as they’ve tried to help and make their father comfortable after he suffered a stroke and heart attack earlier this summer. Ahead of the Resurrection's release, the group spoke with GRAMMY.com about the importance of their brotherly bond and how music has a magical quality that lets them connect with others.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nThe new album is the band’s first in 11 years and comes on the heels of a recent return to the road. What brought everyone back together?\n\nHenry Garza: We got to give all that credit to the man upstairs, brother. Of course, we could take some little bit of credit for that being brothers and family, but we accredit the higher power man. It's just the way things happen. It's like why are the stars in the places they are and why did that one shine brighter tonight than the last?\n\nJoJo Garza: We need to pay our bills, man. I'm kidding. I mean, it is our livelihood, but it ultimately comes down to realizing that we still have a major purpose. While we have life in our bones, we still have a purpose to express what the creator has given us as a blessing, but also to express purpose in needing to show how important music is and what it means to us to do with it.\n\nHenry: Yeah, we’ve got to still keep spreading that message of love through music.\n\nWhat made the band start thinking about creating new music?\n\nJoJo: We never stopped creating music. Even when we took our much-needed sabbatical, we were still in the process of always writing music. And I think when Covid happened, that really put a halt on what musicians could do as far as touring goes. So, we were able to really sort of almost start over. The songs that we chose for the album were given an ample amount of time to be something we felt really positive about.\n\nSome of [those songs] are about having a good time and a lot of them are about life's lessons, but there's a few tunes in there too that are really, really deep as far as offering some input to the people, to the youth, as well as people in our age bracket as well.\n\nJoJo: We were also personally affected by losing some family members and things like that, just like everyone across the world. Whenever we finally did regroup and saw each other for the first time, one of the first things we did was we gave each other big hugs and big kisses and a lot of crying.\n\nI know that Henry and Ringo had done some work together. One of the first things I told Henry when I had heard \"Send More Love\" was the last time he had delivered a song like this it went global, we went worldwide. We won a GRAMMY.\n\nIt's got the basis of what was going on through Covid and it's kind of like a letter to or a phone call to the man upstairs saying, \"Hey, could you send more love down here because this world is going crazy.\"\n\nWas it challenging starting to play again after a few years apart?\n\nHenry: Oh man. It was hard to remember any of the songs that we had played. It was a really emotional gettogether. When we first started rehearsing again together, every song that we played, even old songs, tears were falling because you just didn't know during that time if and when that was ever going to happen again.\n\nWere there things the band was able to do better or differently on 'Resurrection' with everyone older and wiser?\n\nJoJo: I think as far as the music goes, it’s very apparent that we have matured and grown. We actually embraced a little bit more of the digital aspect of what you can do in a studio.\n\nHenry: There was growth during that period with technology for us and getting into the actual recording part of it ourselves and creating a studio to do the work in. We never had that gift or the comfortableness to be able to do that. We were always recording in somebody else's studio where you're paying a thousand dollars for every second that counts. So, we had some kind of freedom to be able to do that on our own and we grew in that aspect.\n\nJoJo: We were always a live band, [that recorded live to tape]. The magic happens when you're live because then you can't go back and recut it or you can't go back and overdub it. Even when you record a live show, there's just a spark between each of us, a connection that it's really hard to capture. But building our own little studios and having the ability to do it ourselves, it's actually brought us closer and to the idea of maybe we should do a little more of this or a lot more of this instead of having to tour so much. So, that's in the cards for Los Lonely Boys as well. Squad goals.\n\nMy brothers gave me the opportunity to sit in the producer's seat on most of these songs. I was actually mixing some of the record while driving from Texas to California, listening in the car speakers. I was able to tell him, \"Oh no, this has too much bass. We need to move that to the left or the right. Let's swap places.\" The ability to do that. Mix a record while you're driving. Come on man.\n\nThe band’s sound has been called \"Texican Rock n' Roll\" due to the diverse influences and that continues with this new album. Why is it important to have that dynamic, diversified sound?\n\nHenry: We created what we call Texican rock and roll, which is anything and everything that has to do with real music from real musicians. This record really still expresses that about what we're about: family, love, brothers, the message of truth through music and resurrection. There's a little bit of flavor of everything in these songs, so it's kind of hard to just classify it as a certain genre.\n\nRingo Garza: Every single one of our albums has always had a song that you could put in another genre of music, country or pop or rock.\n\nJoJo: It really is because we don't see or feel the boundaries between music. What we promote is not exclusivity, but inclusiveness because we're all one people…We're the human race and music is food for the soul.\n\nHenry: Our dad taught us that music was the universal language, it didn't matter where you were from even if you didn't understand what they were saying. It speaks to everybody all across the board. I think that's our main focus with music.\n\nRingo: When I'm recording drum tracks or vocal tracks, I want my brothers to be impressed more than anything in the world. My brothers and my family. When we can get a song together and it brings a tear to our eyes and makes us love each other even more, that's what I strive for.I think my brothers are the same in that aspect of trying to impress and please one another.\n\nYou've all followed in the footsteps of your father, who himself had a band with his brothers called the Falcones. Why is that brotherly bond and honoring tradition so important?\n\nHenry: If you can imagine a cup being filled with water and it spills over and there's another cup that takes on that water too. Our dad did it with his brothers, our mom's family did it with their brothers and my grandpa. Music was so natural, we thought everybody did it growing up. We owe all that to our greatest teacher, which of course for us is our dad. It began with him, and he’s our biggest hero.\n\nHe's the guy that showed us anything from the Beatles to Willie [Nelson] and Waylon [Jennings] to Richie Valens to Fats Domino. Every song he showed us growing up, we thought he wrote all those songs that he was showing us, and we believed he came on the radio, and we'd be like, \"They're playing your song.\" He didn't deny it either.\n\nRingo: Having each other to play in this band together, it was just as natural as being brothers. I think when we were younger, we knew that we were brothers and we were a band, but I don't think that really dawned on us until we started playing out everywhere and knowing that there's not too many bands of brothers. I think that's where our strength comes from.\n\nJoJo: We're family first. Even if we were doctors or we were lawyers or roofers, we were always going to stick together because that's the way we were raised. That's part of our destiny and that's part of what we're here to express. As beautiful it is as it is to have friends and extended family or whatnot. There's nothing like having true family, true blood.\n\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of Los Lonely Boys' debut album and one of your biggest hits \"Heaven.\" What do you recall about recording that record?\n\nHenry: The way we grew up, we had zero expectations for anything because it just wasn't in the cards for where we came from. We were completely shocked and completely amazed when we were grabbing success.\n\nRingo: When we were younger playing and writing and recording, we knew that if we continued something was going to happen. But I don't think that we ever thought to ourselves, Hey, let's put this on the album so we can win a GRAMMY or so that we can sell millions of records.\n\nJoJo: We have a very close connection to all the songs [on our debut album], but when it came to \"Heaven,\" that was the only song that it seemed like everybody would pick on. All the people that were the Lonely team [were] basically saying that they didn't see nothing special in that song. The special thing to us was that it was a prayer that Henry had written that he was instructed to write down as a song. So, what a turn of events for everyone that said \"nay\" to have it turned up being the song.\n\nRingo: The first single was supposed to be \"Real Emotions,\" and when we sent out [our music to radio stations in Austin], DJ Jody Denberg played \"Heaven\" instead. It lit the fire. It stayed up there [on the charts] for a little bit, and it broke. We're still able to reap the benefits of that.\n\nWhat was your favorite memory of working at Willie's studio?\n\nHenry: We can't talk about that man. Oh man. [Laughs.]\n\nJoJo: The fact that we were there in a place that belonged to Willie Nelson. We had seen him on TV and heard him on the radio or whatever, you don't imagine that you're going to be that close to people. Basically, that was his home away from home. And so that's pretty freaking huge, man.\n\nHenry: I'll never forget him driving up in his pickup and visiting us while we were outside drinking a couple of herbal refreshments. He treated us just like family. There's a lot of things to remember, but I think the fact that Willie was even around or took the time to make that connection with us.\n\nJoJo: We were able to start meeting other artists and things like that, but he was the first one that said \"these guys got something special. You might want to check him out.\"\n\nHenry: Right around that time when we were recording the record, 9/11 had happened. \"Heaven\" was the only song that was recorded that day, on the day that the Twin Towers were hit and everything, man.\n\nYou later recorded a song with Willie and your dad called \"Outlaws.\" What was your favorite memory from working on that song?\n\nHenry: Our dad always considered himself the missing outlaw. So just to be working with Willie and having our dad work with him and be on the same song, man, that was the treat in itself. TWhen we hear that song, it's like tears to the eye because we were given the blessing to help our dad's dream come true a little bit.\n\nRingo: And it's a rocking song. It's pretty badass.\n\nThe album’s title 'Resurrection' continues the trend of using religious terminology. What drew you to that word?\n\nJoJo: You can definitely tie it to religion, but resurrection exists without religion. When you look at how grass dies every winter and comes back to life and how trees, leaves fall through the fall and the winter and then they return. And resurrection is also like music. It's a gift that most people don't recognize as a gift or as something considered resurrection.\n\nThe reason we chose the term resurrection is because we were off the road for nearly three years and we weren't even sure we were going to play again. When we finally made that decision to come back I felt like…I mentioned the trees, the grass, how the sun rises and sets every day. It's a constant resurrection.We were given a chance to breathe new life into something.\n\nRingo: I love the fact that it does bring people closer to our father, closer to the love of this world in just that name.\n\nHenry: When you got a band like us who won a GRAMMY for a song called \"Heaven,\" and I think that speaks all in itself. So, when you hear a name title for a record called Resurrection, it ties into what we believe and how we were brought up, but it's definitely not something that we were going to go off and say that \"Hey, this is religious.\"\n\nWhat songs from the album surprised you most and how they came together?\n\nHenry: Oh man, all of them. Songs seem to come out of thin air sometimes. Even when you try to write a song, it doesn't [always] happen. So, all of them are really just a surprise.\n\nJoJo: Our song \"Natural Thing\" is really special because something we had already had [written years ago]. The way Ringo delivered it, I can't wait for the rest of the world to be able to hear this song. Ringo usually sings one song per album or something like that, but this one is very dear to us, but it's also very dear to Ringo because he sang it to his wife at their wedding.\n\nHenry: It's a resurrected song.\n\nJoJo: It really is. That's the true resurrection on the album.\n\nThe band's song \"Wish You Would\" has a pretty encouraging message about going for your dreams, while being careful. And conscient. Has becoming parents and grandparents shifted your perspective?\n\nJoJo: We've been parents for a long time. Some of our oldest kids are in their twenties...There’s the old saying of \"be careful what you wish for.\" If you're not careful about what you call dreams and aspirations, it can come with some serious consequences.\n\nAnother song on the album, \"See Your Face\" is a very emotional one as it pays tribute to your mother who passed away in 2015 as well as other family and friends. How was it helpful writing that song?\n\nHenry: It's about our mother and how memories are in your head when you haven't seen someone for so long. You don't want to forget their face, but it's crazy how a memory pops up and you wish you could just hold it and control it.\n\nHenry: Our dad had a massive stroke and a heart attack at the same time. And it's been a really tough time right now.\n\nRingo: It’s crazy how that song came out and the video and everything having to do with our mama and our dad is having a pretty rough time. Nothing is coincidental. Everything is meant to be, there's no such thing as coincidence.\n\nJoJo: \"Wish You Would\" and \"See Your Face\" are kind of intertwined. That's one thing we're here to really express to people, is tell the people you love them or you're going to wish you would because someday you're going to be wishing just to see their face.\n\nJoJo: Do it while you have the time, express to the people that mean the most to you, that they mean that to you.\n\nRingo: I think it ties into even \"Send More Love\" because I think a lot of that is being forgotten.\n\nHenry: Love is growing cold in this world, man.\n\nJoJo: We do music purely because first off, it's a given to us. Secondly, we do it purely for the music and each song that is given to us sort of appears out of thin air. It's definitely given from the creator of all things. There's nothing greater than being able to have the consciousness that we're given as human beings to be able to express these things so deeply."
