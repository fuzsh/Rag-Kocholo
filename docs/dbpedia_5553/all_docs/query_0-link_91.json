        "text": "I took a walk by my local record store here in the beautiful moose-ridden kingdom of Sweden. Summer is still clinging on, while Fall is trying to push its way in. Soon, the time of hot vegan coco, a burning fireplace and a soothing LP on the record player is upon us.\n\nThe local record store is small. A mom and pop-store located in what I believe once housed a small gallery framing paintings. The record store is mostly selling used vinyl, but with a small and growing selection of new releases. The guy running the store is very friendly. I think he once were in a semi-successful Swedish rockband, but I do not know the name of it.\n\nWe talked about how expensive vinyl has gotten. I mentioned the prices I believed to have seen of Eddie Vedder's latest album. An 1 LP release for something like $41-42. Way too expensive for me. Almost at the level of being obscene I told the friendly Record store guy.\n\nThe guy looked at me with a blank expression. To my surprise he had bought two or three copies of Vedder's latest album to his small Record store. But the price of 41 or 42 dollars was not what the album was priced at. He directed me to the crate labeled \"New arrivals\" and I sifted through it, ending up on the beautiful photo of Eddie reaching for the sky with his guitar, taken by Danny Clinch. The price tag was located at the upper right: 500 Swedish krona ($46,5).\n\nI told the friendly guy that this was not almost at the level of being obscene, it had surpassed that level. The friendly guy nodded in agreement. And he told me, that the price of $46,5 was not the standard price he should charge for it. He said he just couldn't charge over $46,5 - as in breaking 500 Swedish krona - for an one LP album. So he had to lower his margin on this album, this album released by Eddie Vedder. Looking at other sellers, I noticed that the standard price for the album is 519 Swedish Krona - roughly $48.\n\nIn Sweden the price of an LP, is set across the board by using this formula: The PPD (Published Price to Dealer, by the distributor) times 1.25 (sales tax) times 1.3 (the record stores margin). The margin had to be lower than the usual 1.3 on this album, to not cross this friendly Record Store owner's limit of what he had in him to charge for a single LP wide-release studio album.\n\nThe formula, gives us the distributors PPD. 519 Swedish krona divided by 1.25 divided by 1.3 = 319 Swedish krona ($29.5).\n\nEddie Vedder and the distributor have agreed to charge record stores $29,5 (not counting huge resellers like Amazon's discounts) for this album.\n\nObviously Sweden is considered an expensive country, and we have a sales tax that might be a bit higher than in other countries.\n\nSo let's compare this to other albums in this somewhat pricey country. To see what these 519 Swedish Krona ($48) actually means in comparison to other recent and upcoming releases:\n\nOzzy Osbourne - Patient Number 9 349 Swedish Krona ($32)\n\nMuse - Will of the People 269 Swedish Krona ($25)\n\nTegan and Sara - Cry baby 369 Swedish Krona ($34)\n\nRHCP - Return of the Dream Canteen (2 discs) 429 Swedish Krona ($39.5)\n\nSoul Asylum - Grave Dancers Union 289 Swedish Krona ($27)\n\nBen Harper - Bloodline Maintenance 329 Swedish Krona ($30.5)\n\nPixies - Doggerel 339 Swedish Krona ($31)\n\nThe Mars Volta - The Mars Volta 329 Swedish Krona ($30.5)\n\nI left the store without Eddie Vedder's new album. It felt weird. I had always bought everything by Pearl Jam and Eddie Vedder at release. Most often having it pre-ordered. From the self titled in 2006 forward. I believe I was a few weeks late on buying Riot Act. The releases before that, were before my time as a fan.\n\nI walked out of the friendly guy's Record store. A guy who just couldn't charge what Eddie Vedder and the distributor expected him to charge. The weather was now a bit cooler. A chilly fall breeze.\n\nI left asking myself, who is a 519 Swedish Krona album for?\n\nAnd who would argue 519 Swedish Krona is a fair price?\n\nPost edited by Spiritual_Chaos on September 2022"
