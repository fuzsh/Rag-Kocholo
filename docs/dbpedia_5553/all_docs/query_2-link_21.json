        "text": "Reflective ghost imaging through turbulence\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHardy, Nicholas D.; Shapiro, Jeffrey H.\n\n2011-12-15\n\nRecent work has indicated that ghost imaging may have applications in standoff sensing. However, most theoretical work has addressed transmission-based ghost imaging. To be a viable remote-sensing system, the ghost imager needs to image rough-surfaced targets in reflection through long, turbulent optical paths. We develop, within a Gaussian-state framework, expressions for the spatial resolution, image contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio of such a system. We consider rough-surfaced targets that create fully developed speckle in their returns and Kolmogorov-spectrum turbulence that is uniformly distributed along all propagation paths. We address both classical and nonclassical optical sources, as well as a computational ghostmoreÂ Â» imager.Â«Â less\n\nGhost imaging via optical parametric amplification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Hong-Guo; Zhang, De-Jian; Xu, De-Qin; Zhao, Qiu-Li; Wang, Sen; Wang, Hai-Bo; Xiong, Jun; Wang, Kaige\n\n2015-10-01\n\nWe investigate theoretically and experimentally thermal light ghost imaging where the light transmitted through the object as the seed light is amplified by an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). In conventional lens imaging systems with OPA, the spectral bandwidth of OPA dominates the image resolution. Theoretically, we prove that in ghost imaging via optical parametric amplification (GIOPA) the bandwidth of OPA will not affect the image resolution. The experimental results show that for weak seed light the image quality in GIOPA is better than that of conventional ghost imaging. Our work may be valuable in remote sensing with ghost imaging technique, where the light passed through the object is weak after a long-distance propagation.\n\nEvaluating imaging quality between different ghost imaging systems based on the coherent-mode representation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Qian; Bai, Yanfeng; Shi, Xiaohui; Nan, Suqin; Qu, Lijie; Li, Hengxing; Fu, Xiquan\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe difference in imaging quality between different ghost imaging schemes is studied by using coherent-mode representation of partially coherent fields. It is shown that the difference mainly relies on the distribution changes of the decomposition coefficients of the object imaged when the light source is fixed. For a new-designed imaging scheme, we only need to give the distribution of the decomposition coefficients and compare them with that of the existing imaging system, thus one can predict imaging quality. By choosing several typical ghost imaging systems, we theoretically and experimentally verify our results.\n\nGhost Imaging without Discord\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShapiro, Jeffrey H.; Venkatraman, Dheera; Wong, Franco N. C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRagy and Adesso argue that quantum discord is involved in the formation of a pseudothermal ghost image. We show that quantum discord plays no role in spatial light modulator ghost imaging, i.e., ghost-image formation based on structured illumination realized with laser light that has undergone spatial light modulation by the output from a pseudorandom number generator. Our analysis thus casts doubt on the degree to which quantum discord is necessary for ghost imaging.

The present study demonstrates that the ghost components carry useful dynamic information and should not be discarded. Specifically, ghosts of different orders indicate the intensity and phase of the corresponding harmonics contained in the quasi-periodically varying spin-density distribution. A summation of the ghosts weighted by appropriate temporal phase factors can give a time-dependent dynamic image that is a movie of the object motion. This dynamic image reconstruction technique does not necessarily require monitoring of the motion and thus is easy to implement and operate. It also has a shorter imaging time than point-by-point imaging of temporal variation, because the periodic motion is more efficiently sampled with a limited number of harmonics recorded in the motion ghosts. This technique was tested in both moving phantoms and volunteers. It is believed to be useful for dynamic imaging of time-varying anatomic structures, such as in the cardiovascular system.\n\nQuantum ghost imaging through turbulence\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDixon, P. Ben; Howland, Gregory A.; Howell, John C.\n\n2011-05-15\n\nWe investigate the effect of turbulence on quantum ghost imaging. We use entangled photons and demonstrate that for a specific experimental configuration the effect of turbulence can be greatly diminished. By decoupling the entangled photon source from the ghost-imaging central image plane, we are able to dramatically increase the ghost-image quality. When imaging a test pattern through turbulence, this method increases the imaged pattern visibility from V=0.15{+-}0.04 to 0.42{+-}0.04.\n\nGhosting in anaglyphic stereoscopic images\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWoods, Andrew J.; Rourke, Tegan\n\n2004-05-01\n\nAnaglyphic 3D images are an easy way of displaying stereoscopic 3D images on a wide range of display types, e.g. CRT, LCD, print, etc. While the anaglyphic 3D image method is cheap and accessible, its use requires a compromise in stereoscopic image quality. A common problem with anaglyphic 3D images is ghosting. Ghosting (or crosstalk) is the leaking of an image to one eye, when it is intended exclusively for the other eye. Ghosting degrades the ability of the observer to fuse the stereoscopic image and hence the quality of the 3D image is reduced. Ghosting is present in various levels with most stereoscopic displays, however it is often particularly evident with anaglyphic 3D images. This paper describes a project whose aim was to characterize the presence of ghosting in anaglyphic 3D images due to spectral issues. The spectral response curves of several different display types and several different brands of anaglyph glasses were measured using a spectroradiometer or spectrophotometer. A mathematical model was then developed to predict the amount of crosstalk in anaglyphic 3D images when different combinations of displays and glasses are used, and therefore predict the best type of anaglyph glasses for use with a particular display type.\n\nComputational Ghost Imaging for Remote Sensing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nErkmen, Baris I.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis work relates to the generic problem of remote active imaging; that is, a source illuminates a target of interest and a receiver collects the scattered light off the target to obtain an image. Conventional imaging systems consist of an imaging lens and a high-resolution detector array [e.g., a CCD (charge coupled device) array] to register the image. However, conventional imaging systems for remote sensing require high-quality optics and need to support large detector arrays and associated electronics. This results in suboptimal size, weight, and power consumption. Computational ghost imaging (CGI) is a computational alternative to this traditional imaging concept that has a very simple receiver structure. In CGI, the transmitter illuminates the target with a modulated light source. A single-pixel (bucket) detector collects the scattered light. Then, via computation (i.e., postprocessing), the receiver can reconstruct the image using the knowledge of the modulation that was projected onto the target by the transmitter. This way, one can construct a very simple receiver that, in principle, requires no lens to image a target. Ghost imaging is a transverse imaging modality that has been receiving much attention owing to a rich interconnection of novel physical characteristics and novel signal processing algorithms suitable for active computational imaging. The original ghost imaging experiments consisted of two correlated optical beams traversing distinct paths and impinging on two spatially-separated photodetectors: one beam interacts with the target and then illuminates on a single-pixel (bucket) detector that provides no spatial resolution, whereas the other beam traverses an independent path and impinges on a high-resolution camera without any interaction with the target. The term ghost imaging was coined soon after the initial experiments were reported, to emphasize the fact that by cross-correlating two photocurrents, one generates an image of the target. In\n\nDefocusing effects of lensless ghost imaging and ghost diffraction with partially coherent sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Shuang-Xi; Sheng, Wei; Bi, Yu-Bo; Luo, Chun-Ling\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe defocusing effect is inevitable and degrades the image quality in the conventional optical imaging process significantly due to the close confinement of the imaging lens. Based on classical optical coherent theory and linear algebra, we develop a unified formula to describe the defocusing effects of both lensless ghost imaging (LGI) and lensless ghost diffraction (LGD) systems with a partially coherent source. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the influence of defocusing length on the quality of LGI and LGD. We find that the defocusing effects of the test and reference paths in the LGI or LGD systems are entirely different, while the LGD system is more robust against defocusing than the LGI system. Specifically, we find that the imaging process for LGD systems can be viewed as pinhole imaging, which may find applications in ultra-short-wave band imaging without imaging lenses, e.g. x-ray diffraction and Î³-ray imaging.\n\nGhost imaging with atoms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKhakimov, R. I.; Henson, B. M.; Shin, D. K.; Hodgman, S. S.; Dall, R. G.; Baldwin, K. G. H.; Truscott, A. G.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nGhost imaging is a counter-intuitive phenomenonâfirst realized in quantum opticsâthat enables the image of a two-dimensional object (mask) to be reconstructed using the spatio-temporal properties of a beam of particles with which it never interacts. Typically, two beams of correlated photons are used: one passes through the mask to a single-pixel (bucket) detector while the spatial profile of the other is measured by a high-resolution (multi-pixel) detector. The second beam never interacts with the mask. Neither detector can reconstruct the mask independently, but temporal cross-correlation between the two beams can be used to recover a âghostâ image. Here we report the realization of ghost imaging using massive particles instead of photons. In our experiment, the two beams are formed by correlated pairs of ultracold, metastable helium atoms, which originate from s-wave scattering of two colliding Bose-Einstein condensates. We use higher-order Kapitza-Dirac scattering to generate a large number of correlated atom pairs, enabling the creation of a clear ghost image with submillimetre resolution. Future extensions of our technique could lead to the realization of ghost interference, and enable tests of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement and Bellâs inequalities with atoms.\n\nTwo-wavelength ghost imaging through atmospheric turbulence.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Dongfeng; Fan, Chengyu; Zhang, Pengfei; Shen, Hong; Zhang, Jinghui; Qiao, Chunhong; Wang, Yingjian\n\n2013-01-28\n\nRecent work has indicated that ghost imaging might find useful application in standoff sensing where atmospheric turbulence is a serious problem. There has been theoretical study of ghost imaging in the presence of turbulence. However, most work has addressed signal-wavelength ghost imaging. Two-wavelength ghost imaging through atmospheric turbulence is theoretically studied in this paper. Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel integral, the analytical expressions describing atmospheric turbulence effects on the point spread function (PSF) and field of view (FOV) are derived. The computational case is also reported.\n\nOptical image hiding based on computational ghost imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Le; Zhao, Shengmei; Cheng, Weiwen; Gong, Longyan; Chen, Hanwu\n\n2016-05-01\n\nImaging hiding schemes play important roles in now big data times. They provide copyright protections of digital images. In the paper, we propose a novel image hiding scheme based on computational ghost imaging to have strong robustness and high security. The watermark is encrypted with the configuration of a computational ghost imaging system, and the random speckle patterns compose a secret key. Least significant bit algorithm is adopted to embed the watermark and both the second-order correlation algorithm and the compressed sensing (CS) algorithm are used to extract the watermark. The experimental and simulation results show that the authorized users can get the watermark with the secret key. The watermark image could not be retrieved when the eavesdropping ratio is less than 45% with the second-order correlation algorithm, whereas it is less than 20% with the TVAL3 CS reconstructed algorithm. In addition, the proposed scheme is robust against the 'salt and pepper' noise and image cropping degradations.\n\nHigh visibility temporal ghost imaging with classical light\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, Jianbin; Wang, Jingjing; Chen, Hui; Zheng, Huaibin; Liu, Yanyan; Zhou, Yu; Li, Fu-li; Xu, Zhuo\n\n2018-03-01\n\nHigh visibility temporal ghost imaging with classical light is possible when superbunching pseudothermal light is employed. In the numerical simulation, the visibility of temporal ghost imaging with pseudothermal light, equaling (4 . 7 Â± 0 . 2)%, can be increased to (75 Â± 8)% in the same scheme with superbunching pseudothermal light. The reasons for that the retrieved images are different for superbunching pseudothermal light with different values of degree of second-order coherence are discussed in detail. It is concluded that high visibility and high quality temporal ghost image can be obtained by collecting sufficient number of data points. The results are helpful to understand the difference between ghost imaging with classical light and entangled photon pairs. The superbunching pseudothermal light can be employed to improve the image quality in ghost imaging applications.\n\nA self-synchronized high speed computational ghost imaging system: A leap towards dynamic capturing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSuo, Jinli; Bian, Liheng; Xiao, Yudong; Wang, Yongjin; Zhang, Lei; Dai, Qionghai\n\n2015-11-01\n\nHigh quality computational ghost imaging needs to acquire a large number of correlated measurements between the to-be-imaged scene and different reference patterns, thus ultra-high speed data acquisition is of crucial importance in real applications. To raise the acquisition efficiency, this paper reports a high speed computational ghost imaging system using a 20 kHz spatial light modulator together with a 2 MHz photodiode. Technically, the synchronization between such high frequency illumination and bucket detector needs nanosecond trigger precision, so the development of synchronization module is quite challenging. To handle this problem, we propose a simple and effective computational self-synchronization scheme by building a general mathematical model and introducing a high precision synchronization technique. The resulted efficiency is around 14 times faster than state-of-the-arts, and takes an important step towards ghost imaging of dynamic scenes. Besides, the proposed scheme is a general approach with high flexibility for readily incorporating other illuminators and detectors.\n\nGhost microscope imaging system from the perspective of coherent-mode representation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Qian; Bai, Yanfeng; Shi, Xiaohui; Nan, Suqin; Qu, Lijie; Li, Hengxing; Fu, Xiquan\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe coherent-mode representation theory of partially coherent fields is firstly used to analyze a two-arm ghost microscope imaging system. It is shown that imaging quality of the generated images depend crucially on the distribution of the decomposition coefficients of the object imaged when the light source is fixed. This theory is also suitable for demonstrating the effects from the distance the object is moved away from the original plane on imaging quality. Our results are verified theoretically and experimentally.\n\nEntangled-photon compressive ghost imaging\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nZerom, Petros; Chan, Kam Wai Clifford; Howell, John C.\n\n2011-12-15\n\nWe have experimentally demonstrated high-resolution compressive ghost imaging at the single-photon level using entangled photons produced by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source and using single-pixel detectors. For a given mean-squared error, the number of photons needed to reconstruct a two-dimensional image is found to be much smaller than that in quantum ghost imaging experiments employing a raster scan. This procedure not only shortens the data acquisition time, but also suggests a more economical use of photons for low-light-level and quantum image formation.\n\nHigh-quality compressive ghost imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Heyan; Zhou, Cheng; Tian, Tian; Liu, Dongqi; Song, Lijun\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe propose a high-quality compressive ghost imaging method based on projected Landweber regularization and guided filter, which effectively reduce the undersampling noise and improve the resolution. In our scheme, the original object is reconstructed by decomposing of regularization and denoising steps instead of solving a minimization problem in compressive reconstruction process. The simulation and experimental results show that our method can obtain high ghost imaging quality in terms of PSNR and visual observation.\n\nHigh Speed Computational Ghost Imaging via Spatial Sweeping\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Yuwang; Liu, Yang; Suo, Jinli; Situ, Guohai; Qiao, Chang; Dai, Qionghai\n\n2017-03-01\n\nComputational ghost imaging (CGI) achieves single-pixel imaging by using a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) to generate structured illuminations for spatially resolved information encoding. The imaging speed of CGI is limited by the modulation frequency of available SLMs, and sets back its practical applications. This paper proposes to bypass this limitation by trading off SLMâs redundant spatial resolution for multiplication of the modulation frequency. Specifically, a pair of galvanic mirrors sweeping across the high resolution SLM multiply the modulation frequency within the spatial resolution gap between SLM and the final reconstruction. A proof-of-principle setup with two middle end galvanic mirrors achieves ghost imaging as fast as 42âHz at 80âÃâ80-pixel resolution, 5 times faster than state-of-the-arts, and holds potential for one magnitude further multiplication by hardware upgrading. Our approach brings a significant improvement in the imaging speed of ghost imaging and pushes ghost imaging towards practical applications.\n\nGhost imaging of phase objects with classical incoherent light\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nShirai, Tomohiro; Setaelae, Tero; Friberg, Ari T.\n\n2011-10-15\n\nWe describe an optical setup for performing spatial Fourier filtering in ghost imaging with classical incoherent light. This is achieved by a modification of the conventional geometry for lensless ghost imaging. It is shown on the basis of classical coherence theory that with this technique one can realize what we call phase-contrast ghost imaging to visualize pure phase objects.\n\nMultispectral computational ghost imaging with multiplexed illumination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHuang, Jian; Shi, Dongfeng\n\n2017-07-01\n\nComputational ghost imaging has attracted wide attention from researchers in many fields over the last two decades. Multispectral imaging as one application of computational ghost imaging possesses spatial and spectral resolving abilities, and is very useful for surveying scenes and extracting detailed information. Existing multispectral imagers mostly utilize narrow band filters or dispersive optical devices to separate light of different wavelengths, and then use multiple bucket detectors or an array detector to record them separately. Here, we propose a novel multispectral ghost imaging method that uses one single bucket detector with multiplexed illumination to produce a colored image. The multiplexed illumination patterns are produced by three binary encoded matrices (corresponding to the red, green and blue colored information, respectively) and random patterns. The results of the simulation and experiment have verified that our method can be effective in recovering the colored object. Multispectral images are produced simultaneously by one single-pixel detector, which significantly reduces the amount of data acquisition.\n\nImage quality enhancement in low-light-level ghost imaging using modified compressive sensing method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShi, Xiaohui; Huang, Xianwei; Nan, Suqin; Li, Hengxing; Bai, Yanfeng; Fu, Xiquan\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDetector noise has a significantly negative impact on ghost imaging at low light levels, especially for existing recovery algorithm. Based on the characteristics of the additive detector noise, a method named modified compressive sensing ghost imaging is proposed to reduce the background imposed by the randomly distributed detector noise at signal path. Experimental results show that, with an appropriate choice of threshold value, modified compressive sensing ghost imaging algorithm can dramatically enhance the contrast-to-noise ratio of the object reconstruction significantly compared with traditional ghost imaging and compressive sensing ghost imaging methods. The relationship between the contrast-to-noise ratio of the reconstruction image and the intensity ratio (namely, the average signal intensity to average noise intensity ratio) for the three reconstruction algorithms are also discussed. This noise suppression imaging technique will have great applications in remote-sensing and security areas.\n\nSingle-shot thermal ghost imaging using wavelength-division multiplexing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDeng, Chao; Suo, Jinli; Wang, Yuwang; Zhang, Zhili; Dai, Qionghai\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGhost imaging (GI) is an emerging technique that reconstructs the target scene from its correlated measurements with a sequence of patterns. Restricted by the multi-shot principle, GI usually requires long acquisition time and is limited in observation of dynamic scenes. To handle this problem, this paper proposes a single-shot thermal ghost imaging scheme via a wavelength-division multiplexing technique. Specifically, we generate thousands of correlated patterns simultaneously by modulating a broadband light source with a wavelength dependent diffuser. These patterns carry the scene's spatial information and then the correlated photons are coupled into a spectrometer for the final reconstruction. This technique increases the speed of ghost imaging and promotes the applications in dynamic ghost imaging with high scalability and compatibility.\n\nHigh-resolution computational ghost imaging and ghost diffraction through turbulence via a beam-shaping method\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuo, Chun-Ling; Zhuo, Ling-Qing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nImaging through atmospheric turbulence is a topic with a long history and grand challenges still exist in the remote sensing and astro observation fields. In this letter, we try to propose a simple scheme to improve the resolution of imaging through turbulence based on the computational ghost imaging (CGI) and computational ghost diffraction (CGD) setup via the laser beam shaping techniques. A unified theory of CGI and CGD through turbulence with the multi-Gaussian shaped incoherent source is developed, and numerical examples are given to see clearly the effects of the system parameters to CGI and CGD. Our results show that the atmospheric effect to the CGI and CGD system is closely related to the propagation distance between the source and the object. In addition, by properly increasing the beam order of the multi-Gaussian source, we can improve the resolution of CGI and CGD through turbulence relative to the commonly used Gaussian source. Therefore our results may find applications in remote sensing and astro observation.\n\nGhost imaging with bucket detection and point detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, De-Jian; Yin, Rao; Wang, Tong-Biao; Liao, Qing-Hua; Li, Hong-Guo; Liao, Qinghong; Liu, Jiang-Tao\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe experimentally investigate ghost imaging with bucket detection and point detection in which three types of illuminating sources are applied: (a) pseudo-thermal light source; (b) amplitude modulated true thermal light source; (c) amplitude modulated laser source. Experimental results show that the quality of ghost images reconstructed with true thermal light or laser beam is insensitive to the usage of bucket or point detector, however, the quality of ghost images reconstructed with pseudo-thermal light in bucket detector case is better than that in point detector case. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason for this is due to the first order transverse coherence of the illuminating source.\n\nTheoretical scheme of thermal-light many-ghost imaging by Nth-order intensity correlation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiu Yingchuan; College of Mathematics and Physics, University of South China, Hengyang 421001; Kuang Leman\n\n2011-05-15\n\nIn this paper, we propose a theoretical scheme of many-ghost imaging in terms of Nth-order correlated thermal light. We obtain the Gaussian thin lens equations in the many-ghost imaging protocol. We show that it is possible to produce N-1 ghost images of an object at different places in a nonlocal fashion by means of a higher order correlated imaging process with an Nth-order correlated thermal source and correlation measurements. We investigate the visibility of the ghost images in the scheme and obtain the upper bounds of the visibility for the Nth-order correlated thermal-light ghost imaging. It is found that themoreÂ Â» visibility of the ghost images can be dramatically enhanced when the order of correlation becomes larger. It is pointed out that the many-ghost imaging phenomenon is an observable physical effect induced by higher order coherence or higher order correlations of optical fields.Â«Â less\n\nGhost image in enhanced self-heterodyne synthetic aperture imaging ladar\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Guo; Sun, Jianfeng; Zhou, Yu; Lu, Zhiyong; Li, Guangyuan; Xu, Mengmeng; Zhang, Bo; Lao, Chenzhe; He, Hongyu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe enhanced self-heterodyne synthetic aperture imaging ladar (SAIL) self-heterodynes two polarization-orthogonal echo signals to eliminate the phase disturbance caused by atmospheric turbulence and mechanical trembling, uses heterodyne receiver instead of self-heterodyne receiver to improve signal-to-noise ratio. The principle and structure of the enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL are presented. The imaging process of enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL for distributed target is also analyzed. In enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL, the phases of two orthogonal-polarization beams are modulated by four cylindrical lenses in transmitter to improve resolutions in orthogonal direction and travel direction, which will generate ghost image. The generation process of ghost image in enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL is mathematically detailed, and a method of eliminating ghost image is also presented, which is significant for far-distance imaging. A number of experiments of enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL for distributed target are presented, these experimental results verify the theoretical analysis of enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL. The enhanced self-heterodyne SAIL has the capability to eliminate the influence from the atmospheric turbulence and mechanical trembling, has high advantage in detecting weak signals, and has promising application for far-distance ladar imaging.\n\nGhost imaging for three-dimensional optical security\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChen, Wen, E-mail: elechenw@nus.edu.sg; Chen, Xudong\n\n2013-11-25\n\nGhost imaging has become increasingly popular in quantum and optical application fields. Here, we report three-dimensional (3D) optical security using ghost imaging. The series of random phase-only masks are sparsified, which are further converted into particle-like distributions placed in 3D space. We show that either an optical or digital approach can be employed for the encoding. The results illustrate that a larger key space can be generated due to the application of 3D space compared with previous works.\n\nComparison of the signal-to-noise characteristics of quantum versus thermal ghost imaging\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nO'Sullivan, Malcolm N.; Chan, Kam Wai Clifford; Boyd, Robert W.\n\n2010-11-15\n\nWe present a theoretical comparison of the signal-to-noise characteristics of quantum versus thermal ghost imaging. We first calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of each process in terms of its controllable experimental conditions. We show that a key distinction is that a thermal ghost image always resides on top of a large background; the fluctuations in this background constitutes an intrinsic noise source for thermal ghost imaging. In contrast, there is a negligible intrinsic background to a quantum ghost image. However, for practical reasons involving achievable illumination levels, acquisition times for thermal ghost images are often much shorter than those for quantummoreÂ Â» ghost images. We provide quantitative predictions for the conditions under which each process provides superior performance. Our conclusion is that each process can provide useful functionality, although under complementary conditions.Â«Â less\n\nOptical image encryption scheme with multiple light paths based on compressive ghost imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhu, Jinan; Yang, Xiulun; Meng, Xiangfeng; Wang, Yurong; Yin, Yongkai; Sun, Xiaowen; Dong, Guoyan\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAn optical image encryption method with multiple light paths is proposed based on compressive ghost imaging. In the encryption process, M random phase-only masks (POMs) are generated by means of logistic map algorithm, and these masks are then uploaded to the spatial light modulator (SLM). The collimated laser light is divided into several beams by beam splitters as it passes through the SLM, and the light beams illuminate the secret images, which are converted into sparse images by discrete wavelet transform beforehand. Thus, the secret images are simultaneously encrypted into intensity vectors by ghost imaging. The distances between the SLM and secret images vary and can be used as the main keys with original POM and the logistic map algorithm coefficient in the decryption process. In the proposed method, the storage space can be significantly decreased and the security of the system can be improved. The feasibility, security and robustness of the method are further analysed through computer simulations.\n\nOptical image encryption via high-quality computational ghost imaging using iterative phase retrieval\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiansheng, Sui; Yin, Cheng; Bing, Li; Ailing, Tian; Krishna Asundi, Anand\n\n2018-07-01\n\nA novel computational ghost imaging scheme based on specially designed phase-only masks, which can be efficiently applied to encrypt an original image into a series of measured intensities, is proposed in this paper. First, a Hadamard matrix with a certain order is generated, where the number of elements in each row is equal to the size of the original image to be encrypted. Each row of the matrix is rearranged into the corresponding 2D pattern. Then, each pattern is encoded into the phase-only masks by making use of an iterative phase retrieval algorithm. These specially designed masks can be wholly or partially used in the process of computational ghost imaging to reconstruct the original information with high quality. When a significantly small number of phase-only masks are used to record the measured intensities in a single-pixel bucket detector, the information can be authenticated without clear visualization by calculating the nonlinear correlation map between the original image and its reconstruction. The results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed computational ghost imaging mechanism, which will provide an effective alternative for enriching the related research on the computational ghost imaging technique.\n\nGravitational lensing and ghost images in the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchee, Jan; StuchlÃ­k, ZdenÄk, E-mail: jan.schee@fpf.slu.cz, E-mail: zdenek.stuchlik@fpf.slu.cz\n\nWe study deflection of light rays and gravitational lensing in the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. Flatness of these spacetimes in the central region implies existence of interesting optical effects related to photons crossing the gravitational field of the no-horizon spacetimes with low impact parameters. These effects occur due to existence of a critical impact parameter giving maximal deflection of light rays in the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. We give the critical impact parameter in dependence on the specific charge of the spacetimes, and discuss 'ghost' direct and indirect images of Keplerian discs, generated by photons with low impact parameters. The ghostmoreÂ Â» direct images can occur only for large inclination angles of distant observers, while ghost indirect images can occur also for small inclination angles. We determine the range of the frequency shift of photons generating the ghost images and determine distribution of the frequency shift across these images. We compare them to those of the standard direct images of the Keplerian discs. The difference of the ranges of the frequency shift on the ghost and direct images could serve as a quantitative measure of the Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. The regions of the Keplerian discs giving the ghost images are determined in dependence on the specific charge of the no-horizon spacetimes. For comparison we construct direct and indirect (ordinary and ghost) images of Keplerian discs around Reissner-NÃ¶rdstrÃ¶m naked singularities demonstrating a clear qualitative difference to the ghost direct images in the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes. The optical effects related to the low impact parameter photons thus give clear signature of the regular Bardeen no-horizon spacetimes, as no similar phenomena could occur in the black hole or naked singularity spacetimes. Similar direct ghost images have to occur in any regular no-horizon spacetimes having nearly flat central region.Â«Â less\n\nPolarization-multiplexing ghost imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDongfeng, Shi; Jiamin, Zhang; Jian, Huang; Yingjian, Wang; Kee, Yuan; Kaifa, Cao; Chenbo, Xie; Dong, Liu; Wenyue, Zhu\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA novel technique for polarization-multiplexing ghost imaging is proposed to simultaneously obtain multiple polarimetric information by a single detector. Here, polarization-division multiplexing speckles are employed for object illumination. The light reflected from the objects is detected by a single-pixel detector. An iterative reconstruction method is used to restore the fused image containing the different polarimetric information by using the weighted sum of the multiplexed speckles based on the correlation coefficients obtained from the detected intensities. Next, clear images of the different polarimetric information are recovered by demultiplexing the fused image. The results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method is effective.\n\nAdaptive compressive ghost imaging based on wavelet trees and sparse representation.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Wen-Kai; Li, Ming-Fei; Yao, Xu-Ri; Liu, Xue-Feng; Wu, Ling-An; Zhai, Guang-Jie\n\n2014-03-24\n\nCompressed sensing is a theory which can reconstruct an image almost perfectly with only a few measurements by finding its sparsest representation. However, the computation time consumed for large images may be a few hours or more. In this work, we both theoretically and experimentally demonstrate a method that combines the advantages of both adaptive computational ghost imaging and compressed sensing, which we call adaptive compressive ghost imaging, whereby both the reconstruction time and measurements required for any image size can be significantly reduced. The technique can be used to improve the performance of all computational ghost imaging protocols, especially when measuring ultra-weak or noisy signals, and can be extended to imaging applications at any wavelength.\n\nPseudo color ghost coding imaging with pseudo thermal light\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDuan, De-yang; Xia, Yun-jie\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe present a new pseudo color imaging scheme named pseudo color ghost coding imaging based on ghost imaging but with multiwavelength source modulated by a spatial light modulator. Compared with conventional pseudo color imaging where there is no nondegenerate wavelength spatial correlations resulting in extra monochromatic images, the degenerate wavelength and nondegenerate wavelength spatial correlations between the idle beam and signal beam can be obtained simultaneously. This scheme can obtain more colorful image with higher quality than that in conventional pseudo color coding techniques. More importantly, a significant advantage of the scheme compared to the conventional pseudo color coding imaging techniques is the image with different colors can be obtained without changing the light source and spatial filter.\n\nIdentification of ghost artifact using texture analysis in pediatric spinal cord diffusion tensor images.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlizadeh, Mahdi; Conklin, Chris J; Middleton, Devon M; Shah, Pallav; Saksena, Sona; Krisa, Laura; Finsterbusch, JÃ¼rgen; Faro, Scott H; Mulcahey, M J; Mohamed, Feroze B\n\n2018-04-01\n\nGhost artifacts are a major contributor to degradation of spinal cord diffusion tensor images. A multi-stage post-processing pipeline was designed, implemented and validated to automatically remove ghost artifacts arising from reduced field of view diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the pediatric spinal cord. A total of 12 pediatric subjects including 7 healthy subjects (mean age=11.34years) with no evidence of spinal cord injury or pathology and 5 patients (mean age=10.96years) with cervical spinal cord injury were studied. Ghost/true cords, labeled as region of interests (ROIs), in non-diffusion weighted b0 images were segmented automatically using mathematical morphological processing. Initially, 21 texture features were extracted from each segmented ROI including 5 first-order features based on the histogram of the image (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis and entropy) and 16s-order feature vector elements, incorporating four statistical measures (contrast, correlation, homogeneity and energy) calculated from co-occurrence matrices in directions of 0Â°, 45Â°, 90Â° and 135Â°. Next, ten features with a high value of mutual information (MI) relative to the pre-defined target class and within the features were selected as final features which were input to a trained classifier (adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system) to separate the true cord from the ghost cord. The implemented pipeline was successfully able to separate the ghost artifacts from true cord structures. The results obtained from the classifier showed a sensitivity of 91%, specificity of 79%, and accuracy of 84% in separating the true cord from ghost artifacts. The results show that the proposed method is promising for the automatic detection of ghost cords present in DTI images of the spinal cord. This step is crucial towards development of accurate, automatic DTI spinal cord post processing pipelines. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

D.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nAn optimum image restoration filter is described in which provision is made to constrain the spatial extent of the restoration function, the noise level of the filter output and the rate of falloff of the composite system point-spread away from the origin. Experimental results show that sidelobes on the composite system point-spread function produce ghosts in the restored image near discontinuities in intensity level. By redetermining the filter using a penalty function that is zero over the main lobe of the composite point-spread function of the optimum filter and nonzero where the point-spread function departs from a smoothly decaying function in the sidelobe region, a great reduction in sidelobe level is obtained. Almost no loss in resolving power of the composite system results from this procedure. By iteratively carrying out the same procedure even further reductions in sidelobe level are obtained. Examples of original and iterated restoration functions are shown along with their effects on a test image.\n\nGhost imaging based on Pearson correlation coefficients\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYu, Wen-Kai; Yao, Xu-Ri; Liu, Xue-Feng; Li, Long-Zhen; Zhai, Guang-Jie\n\n2015-05-01\n\nCorrespondence imaging is a new modality of ghost imaging, which can retrieve a positive/negative image by simple conditional averaging of the reference frames that correspond to relatively large/small values of the total intensity measured at the bucket detector. Here we propose and experimentally demonstrate a more rigorous and general approach in which a ghost image is retrieved by calculating a Pearson correlation coefficient between the bucket detector intensity and the brightness at a given pixel of the reference frames, and at the next pixel, and so on. Furthermore, we theoretically provide a statistical interpretation of these two imaging phenomena, and explain how the error depends on the sample size and what kind of distribution the error obeys. According to our analysis, the image signal-to-noise ratio can be greatly improved and the sampling number reduced by means of our new method.

This collected signal is a time sequence corresponding to the optic absorption information on the spherical surfaces, and the values at the same moments in all the sequences are used as the bucket signals to restore the corresponding spherical images, which are assembled as the object 3D reconstruction. Numerical experiments show this method can effectively accomplish the 3D reconstruction and by adding up each sequence on time domain as a bucket signal it can also realize two dimensional (2D) ghost imaging. The influence of the measurement times on the 3D and 2D reconstruction is analyzed with Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) as the yardstick, and the transducer as a bucket detector is also discussed.\n\nPhase-Sensitive Coherence and the Classical-Quantum Boundary in Ghost Imaging\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nErkmen, Baris I.; Hardy, Nicholas D.; Venkatraman, Dheera; Wong, Franco N. C.; Shapiro, Jeffrey H.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe theory of partial coherence has a long and storied history in classical statistical optics. the vast majority of this work addresses fields that are statistically stationary in time, hence their complex envelopes only have phase-insensitive correlations. The quantum optics of squeezed-state generation, however, depends on nonlinear interactions producing baseband field operators with phase-insensitive and phase-sensitive correlations. Utilizing quantum light to enhance imaging has been a topic of considerable current interest, much of it involving biphotons, i.e., streams of entangled-photon pairs. Biphotons have been employed for quantum versions of optical coherence tomography, ghost imaging, holography, and lithography. However, their seemingly quantum features have been mimicked with classical-sate light, questioning wherein lies the classical-quantum boundary. We have shown, for the case of Gaussian-state light, that this boundary is intimately connected to the theory of phase-sensitive partial coherence. Here we present that theory, contrasting it with the familiar case of phase-insensitive partial coherence, and use it to elucidate the classical-quantum boundary of ghost imaging. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that classical phase-sensitive light produces ghost imaging most closely mimicking those obtained in biphotons, and we derived the spatial resolution, image contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio of a standoff-sensing ghost imager, taking into account target-induced speckle.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL AREAS OF PHENOMENOLOGY(INCLUDING APPLICATIONS): Experimental Investigation of Quality of Lensless Ghost Imaging with Pseudo-Thermal Light\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Xia; Bai, Yan-Feng; Qin, Tao; Han, Shen-Sheng\n\n2008-11-01\n\nFactors influencing the quality of lensless ghost imaging are investigated. According to the experimental results, we find that the imaging quality is determined by the number of independent sub light sources on the imaging plane of the reference arm. A qualitative picture based on advanced wave optics is presented to explain the physics behind the experimental phenomena. The present results will be helpful to provide a basis for improving the quality of ghost imaging systems in future works.\n\nHigh-performance compression and double cryptography based on compressive ghost imaging with the fast Fourier transform\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeihong, Zhang; Zilan, Pan; Luying, Wu; Xiuhua, Ma\n\n2016-11-01\n\nTo solve the problem that large images can hardly be retrieved for stringent hardware restrictions and the security level is low, a method based on compressive ghost imaging (CGI) with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is proposed, named FFT-CGI. Initially, the information is encrypted by the sender with FFT, and the FFT-coded image is encrypted by the system of CGI with a secret key. Then the receiver decrypts the image with the aid of compressive sensing (CS) and FFT. Simulation results are given to verify the feasibility, security, and compression of the proposed encryption scheme. The experiment suggests the method can improve the quality of large images compared with conventional ghost imaging and achieve the imaging for large-sized images, further the amount of data transmitted largely reduced because of the combination of compressive sensing and FFT, and improve the security level of ghost images through ciphertext-only attack (COA), chosen-plaintext attack (CPA), and noise attack. This technique can be immediately applied to encryption and data storage with the advantages of high security, fast transmission, and high quality of reconstructed information.\n\nApproach for removing ghost-images in remote field eddy current testing of ferromagnetic pipes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuo, Q. W.; Shi, Y. B.; Wang, Z. G.; Zhang, W.; Zhang, Y.\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn the non-destructive testing of ferromagnetic pipes based on remote field eddy currents, an array of sensing coils is often used to detect local defects. While testing, the image that is obtained by sensing coils exhibits a ghost-image, which originates from both the transmitter and sensing coils passing over the same defects in pipes. Ghost-images are caused by transmitters and lead to undesirable assessments of defects. In order to remove ghost-images, two pickup coils are coaxially set to each other in remote field. Due to the time delay between differential signals tested by the two pickup coils, a Wiener deconvolution filter is used to identify the artificial peaks that lead to ghost-images. Because the sensing coils and two pickup coils all receive the same signal from one transmitter, they all contain the same artificial peaks. By subtracting the artificial peak values obtained by the two pickup coils from the imaging data, the ghost-image caused by the transmitter is eliminated. Finally, a relatively highly accurate image of local defects is obtained by these sensing coils. With proposed method, there is no need to subtract the average value of the sensing coils, and it is sensitive to ringed defects.\n\nApproach for removing ghost-images in remote field eddy current testing of ferromagnetic pipes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLuo, Q W; Shi, Y B; Wang, Z G; Zhang, W; Zhang, Y\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn the non-destructive testing of ferromagnetic pipes based on remote field eddy currents, an array of sensing coils is often used to detect local defects.

Although CGI can obtain two- or three-dimensional images with a single or a few bucket detectors, the quality of the reconstructed images is reduced by noise due to the reconstruction of images from random patterns. In this study, we improve the quality of CGI images using deep learning. A deep neural network is used to automatically learn the features of noise-contaminated CGI images. After training, the network is able to predict low-noise images from new noise-contaminated CGI images.\n\nMagneto-optical imaging technique for hostile environments: The ghost imaging approach\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMeda, A.; Caprile, A.; Avella, A.\n\n2015-06-29\n\nIn this paper, we develop an approach to magneto optical imaging (MOI), applying a ghost imaging (GI) protocol to perform Faraday microscopy. MOI is of the utmost importance for the investigation of magnetic properties of material samples, through Weiss domains shape, dimension and dynamics analysis. Nevertheless, in some extreme conditions such as cryogenic temperatures or high magnetic field applications, there exists a lack of domain images due to the difficulty in creating an efficient imaging system in such environments. Here, we present an innovative MOI technique that separates the imaging optical path from the one illuminating the object. The techniquemoreÂ Â» is based on thermal light GI and exploits correlations between light beams to retrieve the image of magnetic domains. As a proof of principle, the proposed technique is applied to the Faraday magneto-optical observation of the remanence domain structure of an yttrium iron garnet sample.Â«Â less\n\nThree-dimensional ghost imaging lidar via sparsity constraint\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGong, Wenlin; Zhao, Chengqiang; Yu, Hong; Chen, Mingliang; Xu, Wendong; Han, Shensheng\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) remote imaging attracts increasing attentions in capturing a targetâs characteristics. Although great progress for 3D remote imaging has been made with methods such as scanning imaging lidar and pulsed floodlight-illumination imaging lidar, either the detection range or application mode are limited by present methods. Ghost imaging via sparsity constraint (GISC), enables the reconstruction of a two-dimensional N-pixel image from much fewer than N measurements. By GISC technique and the depth information of targets captured with time-resolved measurements, we report a 3D GISC lidar system and experimentally show that a 3D scene at about 1.0âkm range can be stably reconstructed with global measurements even below the Nyquist limit. Compared with existing 3D optical imaging methods, 3D GISC has the capability of both high efficiency in information extraction and high sensitivity in detection. This approach can be generalized in nonvisible wavebands and applied to other 3D imaging areas.\n\nMultiple-image encryption via lifting wavelet transform and XOR operation based on compressive ghost imaging scheme\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xianye; Meng, Xiangfeng; Yang, Xiulun; Wang, Yurong; Yin, Yongkai; Peng, Xiang; He, Wenqi; Dong, Guoyan; Chen, Hongyi\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA multiple-image encryption method via lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and XOR operation is proposed, which is based on a row scanning compressive ghost imaging scheme. In the encryption process, the scrambling operation is implemented for the sparse images transformed by LWT, then the XOR operation is performed on the scrambled images, and the resulting XOR images are compressed in the row scanning compressive ghost imaging, through which the ciphertext images can be detected by bucket detector arrays. During decryption, the participant who possesses his/her correct key-group, can successfully reconstruct the corresponding plaintext image by measurement key regeneration, compression algorithm reconstruction, XOR operation, sparse images recovery, and inverse LWT (iLWT). Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations validate the feasibility of the proposed method.\n\nPhased array ghost elimination (PAGE) for segmented SSFP imaging with interrupted steady-state.\n\nPubMed\n\nKellman, Peter; Guttman, Michael A; Herzka, Daniel A; McVeigh, Elliot R\n\n2002-12-01\n\nSteady-state free precession (SSFP) has recently proven to be valuable for cardiac imaging due to its high signal-to-noise ratio and blood-myocardium contrast. Data acquired using ECG-triggered, segmented sequences during the approach to steady-state, or return to steady-state after interruption, may have ghost artifacts due to periodic k-space distortion. Schemes involving several preparatory RF pulses have been proposed to restore steady-state, but these consume imaging time during early systole. Alternatively, the phased-array ghost elimination (PAGE) method may be used to remove ghost artifacts from the first several frames. PAGE was demonstrated for cardiac cine SSFP imaging with interrupted steady-state using a simple alpha/2 magnetization preparation and storage scheme and a spatial tagging preparation.\n\nPhased array ghost elimination.\n\nPubMed\n\nKellman, Peter; McVeigh, Elliot R\n\n2006-05-01\n\nParallel imaging may be applied to cancel ghosts caused by a variety of distortion mechanisms, including distortions such as off-resonance or local flow, which are space variant. Phased array combining coefficients may be calculated that null ghost artifacts at known locations based on a constrained optimization, which optimizes SNR subject to the nulling constraint. The resultant phased array ghost elimination (PAGE) technique is similar to the method known as sensitivity encoding (SENSE) used for accelerated imaging; however, in this formulation is applied to full field-of-view (FOV) images. The phased array method for ghost elimination may result in greater flexibility in designing acquisition strategies. For example, in multi-shot EPI applications ghosts are typically mitigated by the use of an interleaved phase encode acquisition order. An alternative strategy is to use a sequential, non-interleaved phase encode order and cancel the resultant ghosts using PAGE parallel imaging. Cancellation of ghosts by means of phased array processing makes sequential, non-interleaved phase encode acquisition order practical, and permits a reduction in repetition time, TR, by eliminating the need for echo-shifting. Sequential, non-interleaved phase encode order has benefits of reduced distortion due to off-resonance, in-plane flow and EPI delay misalignment. Furthermore, the use of EPI with PAGE has inherent fat-water separation and has been used to provide off-resonance correction using a technique referred to as lipid elimination with an echo-shifting N/2-ghost acquisition (LEENA), and may further generalized using the multi-point Dixon method. Other applications of PAGE include cancelling ghosts which arise due to amplitude or phase variation during the approach to steady state.

Through high-speed electro-optic modulators, the randomly modulated OFPA can provide much faster speckle projection, which can be precomputed according to the geometry of the fiber array and the known phases for modulation. Receiving the signal light with a low-pixel APD array can effectively decrease the requirement on sampling quantity and computation complexity owing to the reduced data dimensionality while avoiding the image aliasing due to the spatial periodicity of the speckles. The results of analysis and simulation show that the frame rate of the proposed imaging system can be significantly improved compared with traditional systems.\n\nGhost imaging with paired x-ray photons\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchori, A.; Borodin, D.; Tamasaku, K.; Shwartz, S.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report the experimental observation of ghost imaging with paired x-ray photons, which are generated by parametric downconversion.

The information is first encrypted by the sender with DRPE, the DRPE-coded image is encrypted by the system of computational ghost imaging with a secret key. The key of N random-phase vectors is generated by the sender and will be shared with the receiver who is the authorized user. The receiver decrypts the DRPE-coded image with the key, with the aid of CGI and a compressive sensing technique, and then reconstructs the original information by the technique of DRPE-decoding. The experiments suggest that cryptanalysts cannot get any useful information about the original image even if they eavesdrop 60% of the key at a given time, so the security of DRPE-CGI is higher than that of the security of conventional ghost imaging. Furthermore, this method can reduce 40% of the information quantity compared with ghost imaging while the qualities of reconstructing the information are the same. It can also improve the quality of the reconstructed plaintext information compared with DRPE-GI with the same sampling times. This technique can be immediately applied to encryption and data storage with the advantages of high security, fast transmission, and high quality of reconstructed information.\n\nEdge detection based on computational ghost imaging with structured illuminations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Sheng; Xiang, Dong; Liu, Xuemei; Zhou, Xin; Bing, Pibin\n\n2018-03-01\n\nEdge detection is one of the most important tools to recognize the features of an object. In this paper, we propose an optical edge detection method based on computational ghost imaging (CGI) with structured illuminations which are generated by an interference system. The structured intensity patterns are designed to make the edge of an object be directly imaged from detected data in CGI. This edge detection method can extract the boundaries for both binary and grayscale objects in any direction at one time. We also numerically test the influence of distance deviations in the interference system on edge extraction, i.e., the tolerance of the optical edge detection system to distance deviation. Hopefully, it may provide a guideline for scholars to build an experimental system.\n\nSingle-pixel computational ghost imaging with helicity-dependent metasurface hologram.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Hong-Chao; Yang, Biao; Guo, Qinghua; Shi, Jinhui; Guan, Chunying; Zheng, Guoxing; MÃ¼hlenbernd, Holger; Li, Guixin; Zentgraf, Thomas; Zhang, Shuang\n\n2017-09-01\n\nDifferent optical imaging techniques are based on different characteristics of light.

In the scheme, the weak thermal light is split into two paths. Photons in one path are spatially diffused according to their frequencies by a spatial dispersion component, then illuminate the object and record its spatial transmission information. Photons in the other path are temporally diffused by a temporal dispersion component. By the coincidence measurement between photons of two paths, the object can be imaged in a way of ghost imaging, based on the frequency correlation between photons in the two paths. In the experiment, the weak thermal light source is prepared by the spontaneous four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide. The temporal dispersion is introduced by single mode fibers of 50 km, which also could be looked as a fiber link. Experimental results show that this scheme can be realized over long-distance optical fibers.\n\nThe x-ray time of flight method for investigation of ghosting in amorphous selenium-based flat panel medical x-ray imagers.\n\nPubMed\n\nRau, A W; Bakueva, L; Rowlands, J A\n\n2005-10-01\n\nAmorphous selenium (a-Se) based real-time flat-panel imagers (FPIs) are finding their way into the digital radiology department because they offer the practical advantages of digital x-ray imaging combined with an image quality that equals or outperforms that of conventional systems. The temporal imaging characteristics of FPIs can be affected by ghosting (i.e., radiation-induced changes of sensitivity) when the dose to the detector is high (e.g., portal imaging and mammography) or the images are acquired at a high frame rate (e.g., fluoroscopy). In this paper, the x-ray time-of-flight (TOF) method is introduced as a tool for the investigation of ghosting in a-Se photoconductor layers. The method consists of irradiating layers of a-Se with short x-ray pulses. From the current generated in the a-Se layer, ghosting is quantified and the ghosting parameters (charge carrier generation rate and carrier lifetimes and mobilities) are assessed. The x-ray TOF method is novel in that (1) x-ray sensitivity (S) and ghosting parameters can be measured simultaneously, (2) the transport of both holes and electrons can be isolated, and (3) the method is applicable to the practical a-Se layer structure with blocking contacts used in FPIs. The x-ray TOF method was applied to an analysis of ghosting in a-Se photoconductor layers under portal imaging conditions, i.e., 1 mm thick a-Se layers, biased at 5 V/ microm, were irradiated using a 6 MV LINAC x-ray beam to a total dose (ghosting dose) of 30 Gy. The initial sensitivity (S0) of the a-Se layers was 63 +/- 2 nC cm(-2) cGy(-1). It was found that S decreases to 30% of S0 after a ghosting dose of 5 Gy and to 21% after 30 Gy at which point no further change in S occurs. At an x-ray intensity of 22 Gy/s (instantaneous dose rate during a LINAC x-ray pulse), the charge carrier generation rate was 1.25 +/- 0.1 x 10(22) ehp m(-3) s(-1) and, to a first approximation, independent of the ghosting dose. However, both hole and electron transport\n\nThe x-ray time of flight method for investigation of ghosting in amorphous selenium-based flat panel medical x-ray imagers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRau, A.W.; Bakueva, L.; Rowlands, J.A.\n\n2005-10-15\n\nAmorphous selenium (a-Se) based real-time flat-panel imagers (FPIs) are finding their way into the digital radiology department because they offer the practical advantages of digital x-ray imaging combined with an image quality that equals or outperforms that of conventional systems. The temporal imaging characteristics of FPIs can be affected by ghosting (i.e., radiation-induced changes of sensitivity) when the dose to the detector is high (e.g., portal imaging and mammography) or the images are acquired at a high frame rate (e.g., fluoroscopy). In this paper, the x-ray time-of-flight (TOF) method is introduced as a tool for the investigation of ghosting inmoreÂ Â» a-Se photoconductor layers. The method consists of irradiating layers of a-Se with short x-ray pulses. From the current generated in the a-Se layer, ghosting is quantified and the ghosting parameters (charge carrier generation rate and carrier lifetimes and mobilities) are assessed. The x-ray TOF method is novel in that (1) x-ray sensitivity (S) and ghosting parameters can be measured simultaneously (2) the transport of both holes and electrons can be isolated, and (3) the method is applicable to the practical a-Se layer structure with blocking contacts used in FPIs. The x-ray TOF method was applied to an analysis of ghosting in a-Se photoconductor layers under portal imaging conditions, i.e., 1 mm thick a-Se layers, biased at 5 V/{mu}m, were irradiated using a 6 MV LINAC x-ray beam to a total dose (ghosting dose) of 30 Gy. The initial sensitivity (S{sub 0}) of the a-Se layers was 63{+-}2 nC cm{sup -2} cGy{sup -1}. It was found that S decreases to 30% of S{sub 0} after a ghosting dose of 5 Gy and to 21% after 30 Gy at which point no further change in S occurs. At an x-ray intensity of 22 Gy/s (instantaneous dose rate during a LINAC x-ray pulse), the charge carrier generation rate was 1.25{+-}0.1x10{sup 22} ehp m{sup -3} s{sup -1} and, to a first approximation, independent of the ghosting dose. However\n\nForming positive-negative images using conditioned partial measurements from reference arm in ghost imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nWen, Jianming\n\n2012-09-01\n\nA recent thermal ghost imaging experiment implemented in Wu's group [Chin. Phys. Lett. 279, 074216 (2012)] showed that both positive and negative images can be constructed by applying a novel algorithm. This algorithm allows us to form the images with the use of partial measurements from the reference arm (even which never passes through the object), conditioned on the object arm. In this paper, we present a simple theory that explains the experimental observation and provides an in-depth understanding of conventional ghost imaging. In particular, we theoretically show that the visibility of formed images through such an algorithm is not bounded by the standard value 1/3. In fact, it can ideally grow up to unity (with reduced imaging quality). Thus, the algorithm described here not only offers an alternative way to decode spatial correlation of thermal light, but also mimics a \"bandpass filter\" to remove the constant background such that the visibility or imaging contrast is improved. We further show that conditioned on one still object present in the test arm, it is possible to construct the object's image by sampling the available reference data.\n\nPulse-compression ghost imaging lidar via coherent detection.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeng, Chenjin; Gong, Wenlin; Han, Shensheng\n\n2016-11-14\n\nGhost imaging (GI) lidar, as a novel remote sensing technique, has been receiving increasing interest in recent years. By combining pulse-compression technique and coherent detection with GI, we propose a new lidar system called pulse-compression GI lidar. Our analytical results, which are backed up by numerical simulations, demonstrate that pulse-compression GI lidar can obtain the target's spatial intensity distribution, range and moving velocity. Compared with conventional pulsed GI lidar system, pulse-compression GI lidar, without decreasing the range resolution, is easy to obtain high single pulse energy with the use of a long pulse, and the mechanism of coherent detection can eliminate the influence of the stray light, which is helpful to improve the detection sensitivity and detection range.\n\nHigh performance optical encryption based on computational ghost imaging with QR code and compressive sensing technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Shengmei; Wang, Le; Liang, Wenqiang; Cheng, Weiwen; Gong, Longyan\n\n2015-10-01\n\nIn this paper, we propose a high performance optical encryption (OE) scheme based on computational ghost imaging (GI) with QR code and compressive sensing (CS) technique, named QR-CGI-OE scheme. N random phase screens, generated by Alice, is a secret key and be shared with its authorized user, Bob. The information is first encoded by Alice with QR code, and the QR-coded image is then encrypted with the aid of computational ghost imaging optical system. Here, measurement results from the GI optical system's bucket detector are the encrypted information and be transmitted to Bob. With the key, Bob decrypts the encrypted information to obtain the QR-coded image with GI and CS techniques, and further recovers the information by QR decoding. The experimental and numerical simulated results show that the authorized users can recover completely the original image, whereas the eavesdroppers can not acquire any information about the image even the eavesdropping ratio (ER) is up to 60% at the given measurement times. For the proposed scheme, the number of bits sent from Alice to Bob are reduced considerably and the robustness is enhanced significantly. Meantime, the measurement times in GI system is reduced and the quality of the reconstructed QR-coded image is improved.\n\nOptical image transformation and encryption by phase-retrieval-based double random-phase encoding and compressive ghost imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYuan, Sheng; Yang, Yangrui; Liu, Xuemei; Zhou, Xin; Wei, Zhenzhuo\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAn optical image transformation and encryption scheme is proposed based on double random-phase encoding (DRPE) and compressive ghost imaging (CGI) techniques. In this scheme, a secret image is first transformed into a binary image with the phase-retrieval-based DRPE technique, and then encoded by a series of random amplitude patterns according to the ghost imaging (GI) principle. Compressive sensing, corrosion and expansion operations are implemented to retrieve the secret image in the decryption process. This encryption scheme takes the advantage of complementary capabilities offered by the phase-retrieval-based DRPE and GI-based encryption techniques. That is the phase-retrieval-based DRPE is used to overcome the blurring defect of the decrypted image in the GI-based encryption, and the CGI not only reduces the data amount of the ciphertext, but also enhances the security of DRPE. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed encryption scheme.\n\nGhosted images: old lesbians on screen.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrainitzki, Eva\n\n2015-01-01\n\nScreen images of old lesbians combine modes of representing female gender, lesbian sexuality, and old age, all of which contain layers of otherness within a hetero-patriarchal and youth-centered society. Analyzing a range of films, from independent to mainstream cinema, this article explores how the ghosted lesbian paradigm intersects with narratives of aging as decline in representations of lesbian characters who are over the age of sixty. The spectral matters of illness, death, mourning, and widowhood inevitably culminate in an unhappy ending. Removed from a lesbian community context, intergenerational continuity vanishes and the old lesbian emerges as the cultural other.\n\nGhosting reduction method for color anaglyphs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChang, An Jin; Kim, Hye Jin; Choi, Jae Wan; Yu, Ki Yun\n\n2008-02-01\n\nAnaglyph is the simplest and the most economical method for 3D visualization. However, anaglyph has several drawbacks such as loss of color or visual discomfort, e.g., region merging and the ghosting effect. In particular, the ghosting effect, which is caused by green penetrating to the left eye, brings on a slight headache, dizziness and vertigo. Therefore, ghosting effects have to be reduced to improve the visual quality and make viewing of the anaglyph comfortable. Since red lightness is increased by penetration by green, the lightness of the red band has to be compensated for. In this paper, a simple deghosting method is proposed using the red lightness difference of the left and right images. We detected a ghosting area with the criterion, which was calculated from the statistics of the difference image, and then the red lightness of the anaglyph was changed to be brighter or darker according to the degree of the difference. The amount of change of red lightness was determined empirically. These adjustments simultaneously reduced the ghosting effect and preserved the color lightness within the non-ghosting area. The proposed deghosting method works well, and the goal of this paper was to detect the ghosting area automatically and to reduce the ghosting.\n\nA novel semiconductor-based, fully incoherent amplified spontaneous emission light source for ghost imaging\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHartmann, SÃ©bastien; ElsÃ¤Ãer, Wolfgang\n\n2017-01-01\n\nInitially, ghost imaging (GI) was demonstrated with entangled light from parametric down conversion. Later, classical light sources were introduced with the development of thermal light GI concepts. State-of-the-art classical GI light sources rely either on complex combinations of coherent light with spatially randomizing optical elements or on incoherent lamps with monochromating optics, however suffering strong losses of efficiency and directionality. Here, a broad-area superluminescent diode is proposed as a new light source for classical ghost imaging. The coherence behavior of this spectrally broadband emitting opto-electronic light source is investigated in detail. An interferometric two-photon detection technique is exploited in order to resolve the ultra-short correlation timescales. We thereby quantify the coherence time, the photon statistics as well as the number of spatial modes unveiling a complete incoherent light behavior. With a one-dimensional proof-of-principle GI experiment, we introduce these compact emitters to the field which could be beneficial for high-speed GI systems as well as for long range GI sensing in future applications.

An automatic ghosting correction technique was developed based on an alternating EPI acquisition and the phased-array ghost elimination (PAGE) reconstruction method. The direction of k-space traversal is alternated at every temporal frame, enabling lower temporal-resolution ghost-free coil sensitivity maps to be dynamically estimated. The proposed method was compared with conventional one-dimensional (1D) phase correction in axial, oblique, and double-oblique scan planes in phantom and cardiac in vivo studies. The proposed method was also used in conjunction with two-fold acceleration. The proposed method with nonaccelerated acquisition provided excellent suppression of ghosting artifacts in all scan planes, and was substantially more effective than conventional 1D phase correction in oblique and double-oblique scan planes. The feasibility of real-time reconstruction using the proposed technique was demonstrated in a scan protocol with 3.1-mm spatial and 60-msec temporal resolution. The proposed technique with nonaccelerated acquisition provides excellent ghost suppression in arbitrary scan orientations without a calibration scan, and can be useful for real-time interactive imaging, in which scan planes are frequently changed with arbitrary oblique orientations.\n\nGhostly Remnant of an Explosive Past\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2007-03-07\n\nThis enhanced image from the far-ultraviolet detector on NASA Galaxy Evolution shows a ghostly shell of ionized gas around Z Camelopardalis, a binary, or double-star system featuring a collapsed, dead star known as a white dwarf, and a companion star.\n\nCalcium pump kinetics determined in single erythrocyte ghosts by microphotolysis and confocal imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nKubitscheck, U; Pratsch, L; Passow, H; Peters, R\n\n1995-07-01\n\nThe activity of the plasma membrane calcium pump was measured in single cells. Human red blood cell ghosts were loaded with a fluorescent calcium indicator and either caged calcium and ATP (protocol A) or caged ATP and calcium (protocol B). In a suitably modified laser scanning microscope either calcium or ATP were released by a short UV light pulse. The time-dependent fluorescence intensity of the calcium indicator was then followed in single ghosts by repetitive confocal imaging. The fluorescence intensity was converted into calcium concentration, which in turn was used to derive the kinetic parameters of the calcium pump, the Michaelis-Menten constant Km, and the maximal transport rate vmax. Km and vmax values derived in this manner were 24 +/- 14 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.6 microM/(ghost s) for protocol A, and 4 +/- 3 microM and 1.0 +/- 0.6 microM/(ghost s) for protocol B, respectively. The difference between A and B is presumably caused by calmodulin, which is inactive in the experiments with protocol A. The possibilities to extend the new method to living nucleus-containing cells transiently transfected with mutants of the plasma membrane calcium pump are discussed.\n\nGhost free systems with coexisting bosons and fermions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKimura, Rampei; Sakakihara, Yuki; Yamaguchi, Masahide\n\n2017-08-01\n\nWe study the coexistence system of both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. Even if a Lagrangian does not include higher derivatives, fermionic ghosts exist. For a Lagrangian with up to first derivatives, we find the fermionic ghost free condition in Hamiltonian analysis, which is found to be the same as requiring that the equations of motion of fermions be first order in Lagrangian formulation. When fermionic degrees of freedom are present, the uniqueness of time evolution is not guaranteed a priori because of the Grassmann property. We confirm that the additional condition, which is introduced to close Hamiltonian analysis, also ensures the uniqueness of the time evolution of the system.\n\nEntangled spins and ghost-spins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJatkar, Dileep P.; Narayan, K.\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe study patterns of quantum entanglement in systems of spins and ghost-spins regarding them as simple quantum mechanical toy models for theories containing negative norm states. We define a single ghost-spin as in [20] as a 2-state spin variable with an indefinite inner product in the state space. We find that whenever the spin sector is disentangled from the ghost-spin sector (both of which could be entangled within themselves), the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing over all the ghost-spins gives rise to positive entanglement entropy for positive norm states, while negative norm states have an entanglement entropy with a negative real part and a constant imaginary part. However when the spins are entangled with the ghost-spins, there are new entanglement patterns in general. For systems where the number of ghost-spins is even, it is possible to find subsectors of the Hilbert space where positive norm states always lead to positive entanglement entropy after tracing over the ghost-spins. With an odd number of ghost-spins however, we find that there always exist positive norm states with negative real part for entanglement entropy after tracing over the ghost-spins.\n\nRobust reflective ghost imaging against different partially polarized thermal light\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Hong-Guo; Wang, Yan; Zhang, Rui-Xue; Zhang, De-Jian; Liu, Hong-Chao; Li, Zong-Guo; Xiong, Jun\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe theoretically study the influence of degree of polarization (DOP) of thermal light on the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the reflective ghost imaging (RGI), which is a novel and indirect imaging modality. An expression for the CNR of RGI with partially polarized thermal light is carefully derived, which suggests a weak dependence of CNR on the DOP, especially when the ratio of the object size to the speckle size of thermal light has a large value. Different from conventional imaging approaches, our work reveals that RGI is much more robust against the DOP of the light source, which thereby has advantages in practical applications, such as remote sensing.\n\nAn improved algorithm to reduce noise in high-order thermal ghost imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Xi-Hao; Wu, Shuang-Shuang; Wu, Wei; Guo, Wang-Yuan; Meng, Shao-Ying; Sun, Zhi-Bin; Zhai, Guang-Jie; Li, Ming-Fei; Wu, Ling-An\n\n2014-09-01\n\nA modified Nth-order correlation function is derived that can effectively remove the noise background encountered in high-order thermal light ghost imaging (GI). Based on this, the quality of the reconstructed images in an Nth-order lensless GI setup has been greatly enhanced compared to former high-order schemes for the same sampling number. In addition, the dependence of the visibility and signal-to-noise ratio for different high-order images on the sampling number has been measured and compared.\n\nStudy on the algorithm of computational ghost imaging based on discrete fourier transform measurement matrix\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Leihong; Liang, Dong; Li, Bei; Kang, Yi; Pan, Zilan; Zhang, Dawei; Gao, Xiumin; Ma, Xiuhua\n\n2016-07-01\n\nOn the basis of analyzing the cosine light field with determined analytic expression and the pseudo-inverse method, the object is illuminated by a presetting light field with a determined discrete Fourier transform measurement matrix, and the object image is reconstructed by the pseudo-inverse method. The analytic expression of the algorithm of computational ghost imaging based on discrete Fourier transform measurement matrix is deduced theoretically, and compared with the algorithm of compressive computational ghost imaging based on random measurement matrix. The reconstruction process and the reconstruction error are analyzed. On this basis, the simulation is done to verify the theoretical analysis. When the sampling measurement number is similar to the number of object pixel, the rank of discrete Fourier transform matrix is the same as the one of the random measurement matrix, the PSNR of the reconstruction image of FGI algorithm and PGI algorithm are similar, the reconstruction error of the traditional CGI algorithm is lower than that of reconstruction image based on FGI algorithm and PGI algorithm. As the decreasing of the number of sampling measurement, the PSNR of reconstruction image based on FGI algorithm decreases slowly, and the PSNR of reconstruction image based on PGI algorithm and CGI algorithm decreases sharply. The reconstruction time of FGI algorithm is lower than that of other algorithms and is not affected by the number of sampling measurement. The FGI algorithm can effectively filter out the random white noise through a low-pass filter and realize the reconstruction denoising which has a higher denoising capability than that of the CGI algorithm. The FGI algorithm can improve the reconstruction accuracy and the reconstruction speed of computational ghost imaging.\n\nSecret shared multiple-image encryption based on row scanning compressive ghost imaging and phase retrieval in the Fresnel domain\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xianye; Meng, Xiangfeng; Wang, Yurong; Yang, Xiulun; Yin, Yongkai; Peng, Xiang; He, Wenqi; Dong, Guoyan; Chen, Hongyi\n\n2017-09-01\n\nA multiple-image encryption method is proposed that is based on row scanning compressive ghost imaging, (t, n) threshold secret sharing, and phase retrieval in the Fresnel domain. In the encryption process, after wavelet transform and Arnold transform of the target image, the ciphertext matrix can be first detected using a bucket detector. Based on a (t, n) threshold secret sharing algorithm, the measurement key used in the row scanning compressive ghost imaging can be decomposed and shared into two pairs of sub-keys, which are then reconstructed using two phase-only mask (POM) keys with fixed pixel values, placed in the input plane and transform plane 2 of the phase retrieval scheme, respectively; and the other POM key in the transform plane 1 can be generated and updated by the iterative encoding of each plaintext image. In each iteration, the target image acts as the input amplitude constraint in the input plane. During decryption, each plaintext image possessing all the correct keys can be successfully decrypted by measurement key regeneration, compression algorithm reconstruction, inverse wavelet transformation, and Fresnel transformation. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations both verify the feasibility of the proposed method.\n\nRecovering a hidden polarization by ghost polarimetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nJanassek, Patrick; Blumenstein, SÃ©bastien; ElsÃ¤Ãer, Wolfgang\n\n2018-02-15\n\nBy exploiting polarization correlations of light from a broadband fiber-based amplified spontaneous emission source we succeed in reconstructing a hidden polarization in a ghost polarimetry experiment in close analogy to ghost imaging and ghost spectroscopy. Thereby, an original linear polarization state in the object arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration which has been camouflaged by a subsequent depolarizer is recovered by correlating it with light from a reference beam. The variation of a linear polarizer placed inside the reference beam results in a Malus law type second-order intensity correlation with high contrast, thus measuring a ghost polarigram.\n\nOptical identity authentication technique based on compressive ghost imaging with QR code\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWenjie, Zhan; Leihong, Zhang; Xi, Zeng; Yi, Kang\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWith the rapid development of computer technology, information security has attracted more and more attention. It is not only related to the information and property security of individuals and enterprises, but also to the security and social stability of a country. Identity authentication is the first line of defense in information security. In authentication systems, response time and security are the most important factors. An optical authentication technology based on compressive ghost imaging with QR codes is proposed in this paper. The scheme can be authenticated with a small number of samples. Therefore, the response time of the algorithm is short. At the same time, the algorithm can resist certain noise attacks, so it offers good security.\n\nInformation Security Scheme Based on Computational Temporal Ghost Imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Shan; Wang, Yurong; Long, Tao; Meng, Xiangfeng; Yang, Xiulun; Shu, Rong; Sun, Baoqing\n\n2017-08-09\n\nAn information security scheme based on computational temporal ghost imaging is proposed. A sequence of independent 2D random binary patterns are used as encryption key to multiply with the 1D data stream. The cipher text is obtained by summing the weighted encryption key. The decryption process can be realized by correlation measurement between the encrypted information and the encryption key. Due to the instinct high-level randomness of the key, the security of this method is greatly guaranteed. The feasibility of this method and robustness against both occlusion and additional noise attacks are discussed with simulation, respectively.\n\n'Ghost of Mirach' Rears its Spooky Head\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2008-01-01\n\n[figure removed for brevity, see original site] [figure removed for brevity, see original site] [figure removed for brevity, see original site] Visible/DSS Click on image for larger version Ultraviolet/GALEX Click on image for larger version Poster Version Click on image for larger version The 'Ghost of Mirach' galaxy is shown in visible light on the left, and in ultraviolet as seen by NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer on the right. The fields of view are identical in both pictures, with the Ghost of Mirach a galaxy called NGC 404 seen as the whitish spot in the center of the images. Mirach is a red giant star that looms large in visible light. Because NGC 404 is lost in the glare of this star, it was nicknamed the Ghost of Mirach. But when the galaxy is viewed in ultraviolet light, it comes to 'life,' revealing a never-before-seen ring. This ring, seen in blue in the picture on the right, contains new stars a surprise considering that the galaxy was previously thought to be, essentially, dead. The field of view spans 55,000 light years across. The Ghost of Mirach is located 11 million light-years from Earth. The star Mirach is very close in comparison it is only 200 light-years away and is visible with the naked eye. The visible data come from the Digitized Sky Survey of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.\n\nObjective lens simultaneously optimized for pupil ghosting, wavefront delivery and pupil imaging\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOlczak, Eugene G (Inventor)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAn objective lens includes multiple optical elements disposed between a first end and a second end, each optical element oriented along an optical axis. Each optical surface of the multiple optical elements provides an angle of incidence to a marginal ray that is above a minimum threshold angle. This threshold angle minimizes pupil ghosts that may enter an interferometer. The objective lens also optimizes wavefront delivery and pupil imaging onto an optical surface under test.\n\nGhost detection and removal based on super-pixel grouping in exposure fusion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Shenyu; Xu, Zhihai; Li, Qi; Chen, Yueting; Feng, Huajun\n\n2014-09-01\n\nA novel multi-exposure images fusion method for dynamic scenes is proposed. The commonly used techniques for high dynamic range (HDR) imaging are based on the combination of multiple differently exposed images of the same scene. The drawback of these methods is that ghosting artifacts will be introduced into the final HDR image if the scene is not static. In this paper, a super-pixel grouping based method is proposed to detect the ghost in the image sequences. We introduce the zero mean normalized cross correlation (ZNCC) as a measure of similarity between a given exposure image and the reference. The calculation of ZNCC is implemented in super-pixel level, and the super-pixels which have low correlation with the reference are excluded by adjusting the weight maps for fusion. Without any prior information on camera response function or exposure settings, the proposed method generates low dynamic range (LDR) images which can be shown on conventional display devices directly with details preserving and ghost effects reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed method generates high quality images which have less ghost artifacts and provide a better visual quality than previous approaches.\n\nBuilding Shadow Detection from Ghost Imagery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, G.; Sha, J.; Yue, T.; Wang, Q.; Liu, X.; Huang, S.; Pan, Q.; Wei, J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nShadow is one of the basic features of remote sensing image, it expresses a lot of information of the object which is loss or interference, and the removal of shadow is always a difficult problem to remote sensing image processing.

The DBM and the interior and exterior orientation elements of the image are used to calculate the zenith angle of sun. Then this paper combines the scope of the architectural shadows which has be determined by the zenith angle of sun with the region growing method to make the detection of architectural shadow areas. This method lays a solid foundation for the shadow of the repair from the ghost image later. It will greatly improve the accuracy of shadow detection from buildings and make it more conducive to solve the problem of urban large-scale aerial imagines.\n\nTwo-Photon Ghost Image and Interference-Diffraction\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShih, Y.
