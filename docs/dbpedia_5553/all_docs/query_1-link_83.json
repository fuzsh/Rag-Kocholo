        "text": "Tegan and Sara have something to say, and they're going to make you listen.\n\nIt helps, of course, that their new album, Love You To Death, is filled with the kind of pop music that can only be described as perfect. It's unapologetic, upbeat, and very danceable. But just as important is the fact that their music is a space for LGBTQ fans to not only hear themselves, but be represented by the artists they love.\n\nThe song \"Faint of Heart\" tells a classic story of love despite all odds. \"This love ain't made for the faint of heart / real love is tough,\" the sisters, who were born in Canada, assert over a dreamy, '80s-inspired beat. \" At the time I was in a new relationship and felt anxiety over my decision to pursue it,\" Tegan told Teen Vogue. \"The song was simply a reminder to listen to my heart and not worry about what other people think.\"\n\nBut rather than star in the music video when it came time to film, the duo opted for something else: They cast members of the LGBTQ community to be center stage — and Teen Vogue has the world premiere.\n\nThe clip stars Tyler Ford as Prince, Ella Giselle as Madonna, Dominic Ravina as Elvis, Olabisi Kovabel as Grace Jones, Cooper Treibel as David Bowie, and Eli Erlick and Ni Ching-Marino as Sara and Tegan, respectively. \"To be able to meet so many people from the LGBTQ community who are doing such important work was an honor and an added bonus to making this video,\" Tegan said, adding that she and Sara \"chose not to be in the video (other than a small cameo) as a way to truly showcase the talented performers and not overshadow them in any way. We knew we had a special opportunity to highlight these artists and didn't want to take away from them or their performances.\"\n\nThe video held extra weight as it was filmed the day after the tragic shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. \"Working with other trans and gender non-conforming folks fills my heart up, and the fact that LGBTQ youth will be able to see possibilities for themselves in this video is so vital,\" Tyler said of the process. They added that \"being on set with so many LGBTQ folks — especially the day after the Pulse shooting — was so necessary, nurturing, affirming, and healing. It's so important to be able to create with and within our communities.\"\n\n\"There was something very personal about this tragedy and that was undoubtably on our minds as we arrived on set,\" Tegan adds. \"From the second we walked in, I felt incredibly emotional. The cast was so young, so excited, so talented, so friendly and so diverse. It was clear this video was going to be very special. I felt honored to be included... which sounds silly since it was a music video for our band. But from the second we arrived, my brain recognized the music video as something we were doing together with our community to present the bravery, the talent, the love, the art, and the connection we all have, rather than just a vehicle for our music — which was a relief. It might be hyperbolic to say this, but I think it altered how we looked at how we were going to proceed in our career. The video had meaning, and that felt very important in that moment of time.\"\n\nThe video, which features the performers lip syncing in character as iconic singers, also \"allows for the world to see that trans youth embody more than just their trans identities. We are unique, diverse, and talented individuals,\" Dominic added, noting that \"the current media has painted a negative portrait of the trans community as a whole and I hope this video defies that.\"\n\n\"First and foremost we just hope it reaches LGBTQ people and makes them feel realized,\" Tegan says. \"Some of the themes of the video — mentorship, finding community, expression, bravery — are things you see so many LGBTQ youth actively pursuing in order to thrive. We need to be strong against a lot of hate in this world.\" Hopefully, she adds, \"a wider audience is able to see the incredible talent and beauty of LGBTQ youth. I hope that it reminds people to not be consumed with what others might think, but instead to follow their hearts and feel empowered to express themselves freely, openly, and happily.\"\n\nRelated: Watch These Dancers SLAY Voguing Choreography to Raise Awareness for LGBTQ People of Color\n\nCheck this out:"
