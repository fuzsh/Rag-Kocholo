        "text": "At the 2024 Juno Awards held in Halifax on Sunday, Canadian indie pop duo Tegan and Sara used their spotlight moment to make a powerful statement against the Alberta government's proposed changes to policies affecting transgender youth.\n\nTheir acceptance speech for the Humanitarian Award, presented by Canadian actor and transgender rights advocate Elliot Page, emphasized their advocacy for 2SLGBTQ+ rights and their unwavering support for the transgender community.\n\nAs they stepped onto the stage, the Quin sisters didn't hold back in their critique of the province's proposed policies.\n\n\"Receiving this recognition is meaningful but also a reflection of the complexities our community faces today. If the world were not so hostile to 2SLGBT+ people, we would see ourselves purely as musicians,\" Sara Quin said.\n\n\"We are dedicated to confronting any form of discrimination that threatens the wellbeing of the community. Threats like the Alberta government's attempting to prevent trans youth from accessing vital care,\" she added.\n\nThe proposed policies in question include limitations on hormonal treatments, puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgeries for minors. These legislative measures have sparked a national conversation about the rights and protections owed to transgender and 2SLGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nFollowing the sisters' speech, fans praised them for speaking out.\n\n\"Tegan and Sara slamming the Alberta government for their transphobic agenda live at the JUNOS just added 10 years to my life,\" a fan penned on X (formerly known as Twitter).\n\n\"Real talk: Tegan and Sara were hugely influential and important to me while I was a teen deep in the closet figuring it out. Feeling so proud watching them win a humanitarian award for LGBTQ+ activism on the other side of it all,\" a fan wrote.\n\n\"Tegan and Sara are appropriately qualified to weigh in on this debate… They are from here, having grown up in Calgary, and no doubt know better than most Canadians just what an appalling government we now have in Alberta, on this and many other issues,’\" another person mentioned on X.\n\n\"Tegan and Sara for president TBH,\" someone else shared."
