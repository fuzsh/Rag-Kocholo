        "text": "The most famous Canadian musicians have made a name for themselves by getting onto your playlists, but they also earned a pretty penny in the process. But just how wealthy are they?\n\nThrough the years, Canada has given the world some amazing musicians across many different genres. For this list of the richest musicians born in Canada, we excluded rich musicians considered Canadian but born elsewhere — think Rufus Wainwright, who was born in New York City; K’Naan, who was born in Somalia; or actor-musician Kiefer Sutherland, who was born in the UK.\n\nHere are 21 of the richest musicians in the world who were born in Canada, ranked by estimated net worth in US dollars, according to available online sources like Celebrity Net Worth and Wealthy Gorilla.\n\n21. Robbie Robertson (Estimated net worth: $50 million)\n\nAs lead guitarist and songwriter for the Band, Robbie Robertson brought us iconic songs like The Weight. It is said that he honed his guitar-playing skills while visiting his Indigenous mother’s relatives on the Six Nations Reserve near his hometown of Toronto.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOutside of the Band, he’s played with some of the richest rock stars and released his first solo album in 1987. He’s also contributed to the soundtracks of several Martin Scorcese movies and wrote/co-wrote three books, including his autobiography. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada and Celebrity Net Worth estimates his fortune at $50 million.\n\nYou may also like: All the Golden Globes 2023 TV acting award nominees, ranked by net worth.\n\n20. Anne Murray (Estimated net worth: $50 million)\n\nNova Scotia-native Anne Murray had already gained popularity in Canada when, in 1969, she released the song Snowbird. This hit made her the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in the United States and catapulted her to fame. The hits kept coming throughout the 1970s and ’80s, as did the awards, among them 24 Juno Awards — more than any other artist — and four Grammys. She is a Companion of the Order of Canada and has been awarded the Order of Nova Scotia.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, this trailblazer for female Canadian singers has an estimated net worth of $50 million.\n\n19. Sarah McLachlan (Estimated net worth: $50 million)\n\nYou can’t think of female musicians of the ’90s without Angel playing in your head. Sarah McLachlan’s most famous song wasn’t her first hit, though.\n\nThe singer, who was born in Halifax and adopted by the local McLachlan family, had already made her mainstream breakthrough in Canada seven years earlier, in 1991. Around the same time, she released Angel, she launched the Lilith Fair tour, which showcased female musicians only, in response to concert promoters and radio stations that wouldn’t feature two female musicians in a row.\n\nAmong Sarah’s awards are three Grammys and 12 Juno Awards. She is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Member of the Order of British Columbia. Wealthy Gorilla estimates her net worth at $50 million.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSee also: How much adoption actually costs in Canada.\n\n18. Mylène Farmer (Estimated net worth: $50 million)\n\nFrench superstar Mylène Farmer actually hails from Canada. She was born in Pierrefonds in Quebec.\n\nShe started her career as a model and with small acting parts before releasing her debut album in 1986. She’s since had a record-breaking 21 number-one singles in the French charts, among them a duet with Sting, Stolen Car. She regularly plays to packed stadiums.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, she has around $50 million to her name.\n\n17. Alanis Morissette (Estimated net worth: $60 million)\n\nIf you were old enough to sing in the mid-’90s, you probably belted out “You, you, you oughta know!” at least once. Ottawa native Alanis Morissette was a child star and had two pop albums to her name when, in 1995, Madonna’s Maverick Records signed her on and released Jagged Little Pill. The album has become such a classic that it spawned two re-releases, an acoustic re-recording and a musical nominated for 15 Tonys.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nShe was the leather-clad ‘It Girl’ of the decade. She even played God in Kevin Smith’s Dogma. There have since been more acting roles, including a stint in Weeds, a podcast, seven more albums and a total of seven Grammys and 14 Juno Awards, among others.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, she’s worth around $60 million.\n\n16. Avril Lavigne (Estimated net worth: $60 million)\n\nBorn in Belleville and raised in Napanee, Ontario, Avril Lavigne was only 14 when she won a radio competition and got to perform with Shania Twain in front of 20,000 people. The next year, she landed a record deal and at the age of 17 in 2002, she released her debut album, Let Go, which would become the best-selling album of the 21st century by a Canadian artist.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nJust like her subsequent albums, her style evolution has been reflecting the different points in her life’s journey since then. She launched her own clothing line, Abbey Dawn, in 2008, has released three fragrances and has a few acting roles under her studded belt. Celebrity Net Worth estimates her fortune at $60 million.\n\nRelated: Juno Awards 2022: the best-dressed celebs.\n\n15. Ryan Peake (Estimated net worth: $65 million)\n\nConsidering how many people claim they hate Nickelback, the band’s members are doing quite well for themselves, thank you very much. Ryan Peake isn’t even the leader of the band, and he’s made it onto our list of the top richest Canadian-born musicians.\n\nHe was born in Brooks, Alberta and grew up some 130 km to the north in Hanna, where he met Chad and Mike Kroeger. Their first band played mainly Metallica covers.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIt was Ryan who took out a $30,000 loan to fund the group’s new band, Nickelback, in the early days. With the $65 million the guitarist, keyboardist and singer has to his name now, as estimated by Celebrity Net Worth, it’s safe to say going into debt back then was well worth it.\n\nYou may also like: The 20 richest YouTubers — based on net worth.\n\n14. Bryan Adams (Estimated net worth: $75 million)\n\nThink of celebrities rocking the Canadian tuxedo through the years, and chances are that an image of Bryan Adams pops into your head.\n\nBorn in Kingston and raised in Ottawa and North Vancouver, the rocker bought his first guitar when he was 12. He dropped out of school to play in a band and used his college fund to buy a grand piano. His first three solo albums did well but it was the fourth, Reckless — released in 1984 — which spawned the megahits and the comparisons to Bruce Springsteen.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAlongside his prolific career as a musician – he has a Grammy and 18 Juno Awards to his name – he’s had a successful second career as a photographer. He’s received the Order of British Columbia and is an Officer of the Order of Canada. Wealthy Gorilla estimates his fortune at $75 million.\n\n13. Chad Kroeger (Estimated net worth: $80 million)\n\nSinger and guitarist (and former Mr. Avril Lavigne) Chad Kroeger was born and raised in Hanna, Alberta.\n\nIn 1995 he co-founded Nickelback with his brother Mike, their cousin Brandon and their friend Ryan Peake. While Brandon was later replaced by Daniel Adair, the band is still going strong. Chad also plays in another band, The Suits XL, and has collaborated with artists as diverse as Carlos Santana and Timbaland. He also co-wrote hits for Daughtry and Tim McGraw.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn 2001, he co-founded 604 Records, whose artists have included My Darkest Days, Carly Rae Jepsen and Tommy Lee.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, he has an estimated $80 million to his name.\n\nYou may also like: The 20 wealthiest skateboarders in the world.\n\n12. Michael Bublé (Estimated net worth: $80 million)\n\nIt took a Canadian to help make the Great American Songbook popular again. Born and raised in Burnaby, BC, young Michael Bublé originally wanted to play professionally for the Vancouver Canucks. His musical talents won in the end, though.\n\nInitially he sang wherever he got a paying gig, did some acting and released three indie albums. He later convinced producer David Foster to sign him on to his record label, 143 Records. In 2003, Michael Bublé was released, followed by a Christmas EP and a live DVD/CD, earning him a Juno Award for Best New Artist of the Year in 2004.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSince then, he’s released one chart topper after another, won four Grammys and multiple Juno Awards, and received the Order of British Columbia. He has a fortune of an estimated $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nSee also: The 20 richest hockey players on the planet, according to net worth.\n\n11. Paul Anka (Estimated net worth: $80 million)\n\nThe son of Syrian and Lebanese immigrants, Paul Anka was born and raised in Ottawa.\n\nWhen he was 15, his uncle gave him $100 and he used it to travel to New York, where he recorded Diana. The song became a smash hit and is still one of the most successful songs ever by a Canadian artist.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nSubsequent hits turned him into a teen idol. He also wrote songs for other artists: among these were the theme tune for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and the English lyrics for Frank Sinatra’s signature song, My Way.\n\nHe made a comeback in the 1970s and another one in the ’90s. He’s also done quite a bit of acting, had a nightclub in Las Vegas and is co-founder of a tech startup. He is an Officer of the Order of Canada and Celebrity Net Worth estimates his net worth at $80 million.\n\n10. William Shatner (Estimated net worth: $100 million)\n\nCaptain Kirk is a musician? Some might call it a stretch but yes, he’s worked with artists ranging from Brad Paisley to Iggy Pop.\n\nBorn and raised in Montreal, William Shatner graduated from McGill University with a degree in economics, but the stage was his calling. His acting career is still going strong, as is his career in music. He released his first album in 1968, introducing the world to his dramatic, somewhat-bizarre spoken-word covers of hit songs, with musical accompaniment.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHis music hasn’t raked in awards like his acting has — he has two Emmys and a Golden Globe — but his other side gig has earned him several awards: he breeds champion horses on his farm in Kentucky.\n\nHe is an Officer of the Order of Canada and Celebrity Net Worth says he’s worth an estimated $100 million.\n\nRelated: 18 hidden gems across Canada to see before you die.\n\n9. Joni Mitchell (Estimated net worth: $100 million)\n\nJoni was born in Fort Macleod, Alberta and grew up in Saskatoon. After dropping out of art school, she played in folk clubs in Calgary and Toronto. In 1965 she left for the United States, where her first big successes came from other artists recording her songs. Her debut album was released in 1968.\n\nTrending Now\n\nMpox is on the rise.

David Foster (Estimated net worth: $150 million)\n\nVictoria-born David Foster isn’t famous so much for his own music — although he has recorded some hits earlier in his career — as for the music he composed and produced for others. His songwriting credits include Earth, Wind and Fire’s After the Love Has Gone, Peter Cetera’s Glory of Love, several songs for Chicago, the Canadian charity single Tears Are Not Enough and the themes for the 1988 and 2002 Winter Olympics and the 1996 Summer Olympics.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe’s produced music for a wide range of artists, including fellow Canadians Michael Bublé, Celine Dion and Bryan Adams.

Plus, he is an Officer of the Order of Canada. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his fortune at $150 million.\n\n7. Neil Young (Estimated net worth: $200 million)\n\nBorn in Toronto, Neil Young grew up in several places in Canada and even spent a stint in Florida to recover from polio. He started playing in bands in high school in Winnipeg and after dropping out, played the city’s folk circuit.

In the 1990s, he became known as the “Godfather of Grunge.”\n\nIn addition to his music, he’s been co-owner of a model-train manufacturer and developed a digital media player.

Wealthy Gorilla puts his estimated net worth at $200 million.\n\n6.
