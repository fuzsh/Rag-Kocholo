They have been honoured with 3 Juno Awards, 2 Polaris Prize nominations, and a Grammy nomination.\n\nAbout JR JR\n\nBased in Detroit, MI the duo of Joshua Epstein and Daniel Zott came together in 2009. Working out of a basement studio, the pair worked to create a sound that was danceable without sacrificing anything in the songwriting department, merging intricate and airy melodies with solid programmed beats and synth atmospherics. Their hard work bore fruit in 2010 when they released their first debut EP, Horse Power. That same year the pair was also tapped to do a remix of Moby’s “Wait For Me”. In 2011, the duo released their full-length debut It’s a Corporate World. In 2013, they returned with the Patterns EP before releasing their sophomore full-length The Speed of Things later that year. In 2015, Epstein and Zott released the album JR JR to critical acclaim. The hit single “Gone” reached the Billboard Alternative top ten.\n\nTo view this piece of content from cts.businesswire.com, please give your consent at the top of this page.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160627005369/en/\n\nContact information"
