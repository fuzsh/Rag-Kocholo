Something about gay people that went to college in the late 90's. They think the world owes them something.

I agree with you anon. I love the music but the personas seem like an archetype.

not really. i came here around 2010-2011 and people in the consistent weekly Mondayx3 threads say that they were in their height of popularity on /mu/ during the Sainthood release.

if it was similar to the pic i posted, thats iirc from the ship concerts they did with paramore. the u mad or whatever version you are looking for was added most likely on tumblr.
