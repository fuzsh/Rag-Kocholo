Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer appears to be a sure-fire winner in the restructuring of Carolco Pictures.

Details of the five-year distribution pact, which Carolco and MGM signed late last week, reveal that MGM will have distrib rights to Carolco films in far more territories than just the U.S.

Carolco also comes out ahead.

“Carolco gets more back-end from MGM than TriStar, (and) one of Carolco’s problems in the past was not protecting back-end profit on hit pictures. In the new restructuring, their upside is much more substantial,” the source close to the deal said.

Carolco will take about 50% of the gross box office. MGM’s average distribution fee will be about 20% of that. “They’re preserving more of the upside potential of their hit films,” the source said.

The business plan calls for distribution of 25-30 features, which will likely pump a minimum of $ 300 million into MGM in five years, the source estimated.

The deal divvies up world rights like a well-sliced pie, with Carolco’s strategic foreign partners getting their own territories.

Pioneer gets Japan. Le Studio Canal Plus takes France and French-speaking Africa. RCS Video Intl. Services B.V. (Rizzoli) gets Italy and Italian-speaking Africa. Carolco will handle the rest of Western Europe, including the U.K., via pre-sales.

Aside from domestic, MGM has all Asian rights except in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.

MGM takes all rights in Central America, South America (except Brazil, which will also be pre-sold by Carolco), and Eastern Europe (except Hungary and Poland).

The domestic portion of the deal applies to any Carolco film with a minimum budget of $ 15 million that begins principal photography on or after Jan. 1, 1994. However, the foreign rights portion kicks in as soon as the Securities & Exchange Commission approves the restructuring, the source noted.
