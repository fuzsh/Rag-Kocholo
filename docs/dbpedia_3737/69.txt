Mayer was tapped to lead the newly formed MGM, with 24-year-old wunderkind Irving Thalberg appointed as its head of production. MGM quickly established itself as one of Hollywood's most prestigious studios, known for the quality of their film offerings, their commercial success and for having "more stars than there are in heaven."
