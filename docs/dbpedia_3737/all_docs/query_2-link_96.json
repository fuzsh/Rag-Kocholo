        "text": "The consolidation of Hollywood continues. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that MGM Holdings, Inc. is looking to be sold. The studio is in talks with investment banks to begin a formal sale process. It’s hoping that bigger studios will look at its classic back catalog to bolster their film and streaming slates.\n\nMGM, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., is one of the oldest film studios around, originally founded in 1924. It owns the rights to straight-up classics like The Wizard of Oz, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, West Side Story, In the Heat of the Night, Platoon, Rain Man, Dance With Wolves, and Silence of the Lambs. MGM also has the right to some smaller franchises, like the Rocky and Creed films, Stargate, RoboCop, and uhh… Legally Blonde? (Look, they tout the last one on their own website.)\n\nBut most folks care about the crowning jewel in their stable: the James Bond franchise.\n\nOn The Right Side of the Rights\n\nThe long-running film franchise is the one from which the concept of spies in pop culture is mostly drawn. Across 25 films, 58 years, and six lead actors, the brand has had varying levels of success. Not every film is great, but everyone knows who James Bond is. You can’t buy that kind of clout. Well, I guess you can.\n\nMGM doesn’t outright own the James Bond films though. In fact, they’re a little bit of a mess. A quick rundown: The rights to the earlier films in the franchise are co-owned by MGM and Danjaq, the latter of which is a holding company established by Eon Productions’ founders Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. Eon makes the films and Danjaq holds the rights.\n\nThe rights to the the Daniel Craig films — Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, and Spectre — are co-owned by MGM, Danjaq, and Columbia Pictures (a subsidiary of Sony Pictures). The upcoming film, No Time to Die, was co-produced by MGM and Eon Productions, and distributed by United Artists in North America (co-owned by MGM and Annapurna Pictures) and Universal internationally. And in terms of home video — which might including streaming rights — it seems like MGM owns the rights for all of Eon Productions’ films, though Universal has the physical home distribution rights for No Time to Die.\n\nGot all that? Good.\n\nWho Can Buy James Bond?\n\nSo, let’s put aside that there could be some shenanigans that happen between Eon Productions, Danjaq, and whoever buys MGM. Let’s assume the Broccoli family that manages Eon would just go along with whoever ends up with the rights to MGM’s library.\n\nI should also note that Apple and Netflix both tried to pick up No Time to Die for streaming this year. That follows news back in January that MGM held talks with both companies to “gauge their interest in an acquisition”.\n\nDisney\n\nThis is the one that’s always on the top of everyone’s list, because it feeds into the general “evil empire” vibe surrounding the company. Yes, Disney is big on acquisitions, having picked up Pixar, Lucasfilm, and Marvel, giving it a stranglehold on pop culture. But it also largely makes decisions that fit into its general family-friendly monoculture strategy.\n\nAs an example, when it was announced that the Paramount Consent Decrees were terminated, everyone assumed that Disney would buy up a couple of theaters. But Disney doesn’t need to; it’s already got a prime spot in theaters from owning Marvel and Star Wars. Why add the cost of operating theaters for no real gain?\n\nSo looking at MGM, and James Bond in particular, does buying the studio make sense for Disney? Not really. You get James Bond, but Disney isn’t huge on utilizing its more adult-oriented properties. It doesn’t particularly care about the films it already owns through Touchstone Pictures and 20th Century, so why would it throw more on the pile?\n\nJames Bond isn’t necessarily a universe that can be expanded in the way that Disney prefers either. You get James Bond, and then you have to make up other ideas and concepts in that universe to fill it out. At that point, why not make your own spy franchise? Which… Disney technically has with the Kingsman brand over at 20th Century.\n\nThe only thing that would lean towards the idea of Disney picking up MGM is former CEO and current executive chairman Bob Iger telling Time that he’s a James Bond fan back in 2019.\n\nWhen asked which IP he would buy if in some fantasy world he could: Harry Potter, Gandalf or James Bond, Iger smiles. “We’re not looking to buy anything right now,” he says. “But I’ve always been a huge James Bond fan.”\n\nBut I doubt that means it makes good business sense for Disney.\n\nViacomCBS\n\nI admit, that ViacomCBS would love to pick up the rights to Bond and rest of the MGM library for Paramount+ (formerly known as CBS All Access). But compared to the rest of the companies on this list, ViacomCBS is simply going to get outbid. If anything, ViacomCBS is probably the next in line to get acquired.\n\nSony Pictures\n\nSony Pictures already spent good hard cash to get in on the Craig films, before losing those rights in 2018. It needs the major franchises, as it currently leans heavily on Spider-Man, which is a co-production with Marvel Studios, and the growing Spider-Man universe with films like Venom and Morbius. The rest of its slate is mixed, with the last Men In Black film flopping, but successes like the Jumanji reboot.\n\nSony Pictures is likely to jump in the bidding war, but like ViacomCBS, I feel that they’re get beat out in terms of pure money.\n\nNetflix\n\nNow we’re getting into actual options in the bidding war. As I noted before, Netflix has already been in talks with MGM for No Time to Die and a potential acquisition. The company is also up during the pandemic, with around $5 billion cash on hand. That’s just under the $5.5 billion valuation for MGM in the Wall Street Journal’s report.\n\nThat means Netflix would get everything MGM. A decent back catalog of classic films, a few smaller franchises to build on, and part of the rights to James Bond. All of that is attractive to the streaming giant as it loses films and shows to competitors spinning up their own services. I can see Netflix making a play for MGM, but the last three options are going to be there to shove them out of the way.\n\nUniversal\n\nThis item says “Universal”, but it’s really Comcast. Universal Pictures already has its foot in the door with the international and physical home video rights for No Time to Die. And acquisition merely firms up that existing partnership with Eon. James Bond would join other adult-oriented franchises like The Fast and the Furious, Jurassic World, and Halloween on a more permanent basis.\n\nPeacock also gets an infusion of additional content. The streaming service already has TV hits like The Office, SNL, and 30 Rock, or older classics like The Sting, Spartacus, and Psycho. Throw the MGM catalog in there and you have an excellent overall catalog, with something for everyone. And NBCUniversal gets the chance to craft spin-off TV shows and reboots for Stargate, RoboCop, or the Addams Family as Peacock Originals.\n\nComcast purchased DreamWorks Animation for $3.8 billion in 2016 and acquired Sky for $38 billion in 2018, so it’s not afraid to spend money to get what it wants. MGM is a good all-around purchase in terms of content for Comcast.\n\nAmazon\n\nThis is the first of two companies with more money than God. Amazon has a strong task record of buying up brands in order to get people to care about Amazon Prime Video. The shopping megacorp spent $250 million to pick up the TV rights for The Lord of the Rings, with a potential price tag of around $1 billion for five seasons. It was looking to spend another billion on a potential three-season series based on The Three-Body Problem, but that deal fell through and Netflix picked up the rights.\n\nThose price tags were for single properties. Amazon has money to burn.\n\nThe problem is Amazon doesn’t see much of a need for theatrical release anymore. It’ll do the limited theater engagement, but otherwise, its focus is streaming.\n\n“We know our customers love movies. We’re just trying to shift — it’s not closing the door on theatrical release. We will continue to [make] and acquire movies that will embrace that strategy. But it really is trying to get these movies to our Prime subscribers as soon as possible,” said Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke back in 2019, prior to the pandemic gutting movie exhibition.\n\nIn contrast, Eon Productions producer and boss Barbara Broccoli has been heavily in support of the theatrical experience according to reports. That said, she’s open to changes in the future.\n\n“We make these films for the audiences,” Broccoli told Variety earlier this year. “We like to think that they’re going to be seen primarily on the big screen. But having said that, we have to look to the future. Our fans are the ones who dictate how they want to consume their entertainment. I don’t think we can rule anything out, because it’s the audience that will make those decisions. Not us.”\n\nSo, it could happen."
