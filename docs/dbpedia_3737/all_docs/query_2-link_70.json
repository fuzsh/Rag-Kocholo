        "text": "Irwin Winklerâs career as a producer, director and writer encompasses popular and influential movies that have impacted contemporary culture. With a passion for big, bold, meaningful stories, his films include an array of true screen classics, garnering among them 12 Academy Awards and 52 Oscar nominations.\n\nAmong Winklerâs multiple nominations include five Best Picture nominations, each for a pioneering film: the tale of underdog sports triumph, ROCKY, which forged one of most globally recognizable movie characters and themes in history; RAGING BULL, which turned the biopic into a gritty, lyrical work of art; the history-capturing look at the U.S. space program, THE RIGHT STUFF; the iconic gangster tale, GOODFELLAS; and THE WOLF OF WALL STREET. Winkler is the only producer honored with three films on the American Film Instituteâs list of the âTop 100 Films.â\n\nWinkler most recently produced CREED II, the eighth installment of the ROCKY franchise to be released November 2018. Sylvester Stallone, Michael B. Jordan and Tessa Thompson all reprised their roles with Steven Caple Jr. directing.\n\n2018 also saw Winkler producing THE IRISHMAN for Netflix, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci that tells the true story of Frank âThe Irishmanâ Sheeran.\n\nWinkler was honored in 2017 by the Producers Guild of America with the prestigious David O. Selznick Achievement Award which recognized his lifetime body of work.\n\nIn April 2016, Winkler spoke at Harvard Universityâs Kennedy School on the political and social influence his films have had on both the U.S. and international culture.\n\nThe American Cinematheque held a three-day retrospective in 2016 to honor Winkler by showcasing such works as GOODFELLAS, NEW YORK, NEW YORK and RAGING BULL, culminating with an onstage conversation alongside Martin Scorsese to discuss Winklerâs storied career.\n\nWinkler produced the critically acclaimed SILENCE in 2016 with Martin Scorsese directing a script by Jay Cocks and starring Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver.\n\nAlso in 2016 Winkler produced CREED, the seventh installment of his Academy Award winning franchise, ROCKY. Starring Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan, with Ryan Coogler directing, the film garnered both commercial and critical success; earning a Golden Globe nomination and Academy Award nomination for Sylvester Stallone. The film was named Outstanding Motion Picture from the NAACP Image Awards, the Black Film Critics Circle and named as one of the top films by the National Board of Review.\n\nDuring 2013, Winkler Executive Produced the Academy Award and Golden Globe nominated THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, illustrates his continual presence as one of Hollywoodâs most prolific producers making an indelible impact with his ability to showcase emotional storytelling with hard hitting relevance.\n\nFor Winkler, success has come from his constant instinctual draw to fresh, current, even controversial subjects and visionary talents. As a storyteller he has been fascinated by both the dangers of corruption and the beauty of courage and compassion.\n\nWinkler first made a resounding impact producing a series of raw, edgy human dramas that helped to define the gritty landscape of 70s and 80s cinema. Thus the the fiercely original THEY SHOOT HORSES, DONâT THEY?, about the desperate contenders in a Depression-era dance contest, starring Jane Fonda and Michael Sarrazin, which would seal Winklerâs reputation with 9 Academy Award nominations and status as a Hollywood classic.\n\nOther highlights from this period include NEW YORK, NEW YORK, starring Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro, which produced one of the most recognizable songs in pop culture; the enduring masterpiece, RAGING BULL, considered by many to be among the great cinematic works of the 20th Century and highlighted by DeNiroâs Oscar winning performance; and GOODFELLAS, which was honored with numerous criticsâ awards and has become etched in filmgoersâ consciousnesses as the paragon of the American crime drama.\n\nIn that era, Winkler also produced the Mafia comedy Jimmy Brolinâs THE GANG THAT COULDNâT SHOOT STRAIGHT starring Bob DeNiro ; UP THE SANDBOX a look at the womenâs movement starring Barbra Streisand; THE GAMBLER a penetrating look at gambling addiction, starring James Caan; the stirring modern Western, COMES A HORSEMAN teaming Caan with Jane Fonda, directed by Alan Pakula; TRUE CONFESSIONS written by Joan Didion and John Dunne starring Robert DeNiro and Robert Duvall; the critically-acclaimed suspense thriller about a woman who discovers her father is an accused Nazi war criminal, MUSIC BOX, which earned an Oscar nomination for star Jessica Lange and the homage to the Jazz Era, ROUND MIDNIGHT, with Herbie Hancock winning an Academy Award for his musical composition and a Best Actor nomination for Dexter Gordon.\n\nIn 1989, Winkler made his directorial debut from his own screenplay, GUILTY BY SUSPICION, hailed by the New York Times as âA stirring and tragic evocation of terrible timesâ about Hollywoodâs all-too-real blacklisting era. Starring Robert DeNiro as a prominent director asked to âname namesâ and Annette Bening as his wife, the film presaged a writing and directing career that would, like Winklerâs producing career, be focused on taut human drama and politically-charged themes and nominated for the Palme dâOr at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWinklerâs next directorial outing reunited him with both Robert DeNiro and Jessica Lange in the noir crime drama, NIGHT AND THE CITY, which would close the prestigious New York Film Festival in 1992 and become a rousing critical success. He went on to direct and produce AT FIRST SIGHT, a romantic drama based on a true story by Dr. Oliver Sacks, starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino and Nathan Lane and the prescient cyber-crime thriller THE NET, starring Sandra Bullock, one of the big box-office hits of 1995.\n\nWinklerâs directorial career would continue to take intriguing turns. He broached the thought-provoking question of what happens when a man suddenly faces his own mortality in the poignantly complex LIFE AS A HOUSE, featuring a landmark performance by Kevin Kline.\n\nRadically switching gears, Winkler next directed one of his most distinctive features, the musical biography of the legendary composer Cole Porter: DE-LOVELY. Featuring Golden Globe-nominated performances from Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd, as well as performances from pop and rock music talents, including Sheryl Crow, Alanis Morissette, Elvis Costello, Robbie Williams, Natalie Cole, and Diana Krall, all performing Porterâs classic songs, the film was selected as the closing night gala event at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nWinkler became one of the very first American filmmakers to turn his camera on an issue currently of vital significance -- the return of U.S. veterans from the war in Iraq â when he directed and produced the provocative drama HOME OF THE BRAVE, starring Samuel L. Jackson, Curtis â50 Centâ Jackson, Jessica Biel and Brian Presley.\n\nWinkerâs motion picture producing career began in the late 1960s when he produced his first film, the Elvis Presley movie DOUBLE TROUBLE, with the legendary director Norman Taurog. Soon after, he entered into a partnership with Robert Chartoff, producing such films as the classic revenge thriller POINT BLANK. In 1970, an eclectic trio of Winkler/Chartoff films each made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival: LEO THE LAST won the Best Director prize, the counter-culture cult film, THE STRAWBERRY STATEMENT received the Jury Award THEY SHOOT HORSES, DONâT THEY? garnered the closing night honors.\n\nFor his contributions to the popular culture, Winkler has been the recipient of numerous American and international honors, including the Commandeur des Arts et Lettres, the French governmentâs highest decoration for contribution to the arts. In 1989, the British Film Institute saluted him with a retrospective of his work and in 1995, Winkler became the first producer to be honored with a showcase screening of ten of his films at the Deauville Film Festival. He has also received a Lifetime Achievement award from the Chicago Film Festival, a star on the Hollywood Boulevard Walk of Fame and retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which had not honored a producer since their tribute to David O. Selznick in 1980. Winkler also received the National Board of Reviewâs highest honor for Career Achievement in Producing, which Kevin Kline presented to him at their annual gala in January 2007 in New York. Winkler was a Governor of the New York City Ballet and is currently on the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\nCHARLES WINKLER is the son of producer/director Irwin Winkler. He was raised in Los Angeles and from an early age expressed a desire to be a filmmaker.\n\nCharles spent many years working in low-level assistant positions on such films as Raging Bull, Rocky II, and New York, New York, learning the craft of movie making. After making a series of short narrative films and documentaries in his early 20's, Charles wrote and directed his first feature film, You Talkin' To Me?, for United Artists in 1987. Two years later he co-wrote and directed the feature Disturbed starring Malcolm McDowell. From then on Charles alternated writing and directing features and MOW's with episodic television directing assignments, including work on such shows as Beggars and Choosers, Baywatch, The Chris Isaak Show, The Outer Limits, and many others.\n\nIn 1996, Charles wrote and directed the AIDS action-comedy Red Ribbon Blues with RuPaul, Lypsynka, and Deb Mazar, which was invited to over 40 film festivals around the world. In 1998 he co-wrote and directed the award winning television docudrama Rocky Marciano, starring Jon Favreau and George C. Scott in one of his last roles. In 2000 Charles directed the musical MOW At Any Cost for VH1. During 2003 he produced and directed the second-unit for Irwin's Cole Porter biopic De-Lovely, starring Kevin Kline and Ashley Judd.\n\nCharles then directed the award-winning Shackles in 2004. This highly stylized and award-winning high school in prison drama starring D.L. Hughley (in his first dramatic role) has been utilized in various Safe Streets and youth diversion programs around the country.\n\nIn 2005 Charles traveled to Istanbul, Turkey to direct The Net 2.0, which was the first American movie to be shot completely in country with an all-Turkish crew. 2006 saw the revival of Rocky Balboa, starring Sylvester Stallone on which Charles was a producer and the second unit director as well. Charles also preformed the same duties on Irwin's latest directorial effort, the Iraq war drama Home of The Brave, starring Sam Jackson, Curtis \"50-Cent\" Jackson, and Jessica Biel.\n\nIn 2009 Charles directed STREETS OF BLOOD. Set in New Orleans in the wake of Katrina, Streets of Blood centers around Detective Andy Devereaux (Val Kilmer) who sets out to investigate the murder of his partner, brutally shot to death during the hurricane. Joined by his new partner Stan (50 Cent), Andyâs journey leads him into the dark and vicious world of police corruption. Counseled by police psychologist Dr. Nina, Andy strips away at these layers of corruption while attempting to remain clean himself, even as those in his very department conspire against him. Ultimately, Streets of Blood is a story of one manâs search for justice in a place where lawlessness and brutality reign.\n\nCharles currently lives in Los Angeles with his wife, the actress Sandra Nelson, and their two children."
