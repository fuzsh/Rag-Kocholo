The following study, mandated by the National Film Preservation Act of 1992, describes the current state of preservation in the U.S. film industry and in public and nonprofit archives. Information was gathered at hearings in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., (transcribed in Volumes 2 and 3) and through written comments from the field (Volume 4), as well as through interviews and published documents. The first of two submissions to Congress by the Librarian of Congress, this study lays the framework for a national film preservation program.\n\nFilm is a fragile medium, and motion pictures of all types are deteriorating faster than archives can preserve them. Preservation practices slow film's inevitable decay by environmentally controlled storage and by copying endangered works onto more durable film stock. Today's film preservation crisis is not merely the result of substantially decreased public funding but also arises from a growth in the types of films now valued and requiring preservation. Newsreels, documentaries, avant-garde works, anthropological and regional films, advertising shorts, and even some home movies (especially of ethnic groups invisible in the mainstream media) are now seen as important records of America's social memory.\n\nFueling the crisis is the deterioration of films from the last 40 years, films previously thought not-at-risk. Preservation efforts were once directed solely at copying nitrate- base film, an older, unstable film stock. \"safety film\" replaced nitrate in the early 1950s, and now preservationists must deal with recently discovered problems of this less flammable substitute--the fading of color film and \"vinegar syndrome\", an irreversible film base decay--in addition to the still-pressing task of nitrate conversion. Research is increasingly demonstrating the critical role of low humidity and low temperature storage in extending film life. As technical expertise grows, better copies are being made from older film materials. Film preservation is increasingly perceived as an ongoing activity, not a one-time copying \"fix\". These factors point to the need to re-think the current approach.\n\nFilm preservation in practice. While many types of organizations have motion pictures of cultural interest, preservation efforts vary greatly with funding and commercial rights. Studios with large film libraries, once little interested in \"last-year's pictures,\" now earn less revenue from a film's theatrical release than from later ancillary distribution by cable, network, and home video. Although industry practices vary, most studios are now investing in sophisticated storage facilities and restoring older features for which they own commercial rights. Independent producers and distributors, owners of films financed outside the large studios, generally lack the resources and organizational continuity to mount such expensive \"asset protection\" programs. The works of avant- garde and documentary filmmakers are among those most at risk.\n\nIn the public and nonprofit sectors, the defining problem for film preservation is funding. For the largest archives, the priority has long been the duplication of nitrate film. For more specialized archives--smaller archives that collect films relating to a specific region, subject or ethnic group--the first preservation task has been to bring endangered film into archival custody.\n\nFearing legal action, foreign archives, like U.S. collectors, have been reluctant to reveal their holdings of American films. A large number of \"lost\" American films of the 1910s and 1920s survive abroad in unique prints.\n\nFederal programs. Federal film preservation funding has supported the copying of deteriorating film in tax-exempt institutions. The major conduit has been the grant program funded through the National Endowment for the Arts and administered by the National Center for Film and Video Preservation at the American Film Institute. Between 1979 and 1992, 37 institutions received a total of $5.5 million in matching federal grants, stimulating at least double that dollar amount in laboratory copying. This AFI-NEA program provides a limited safety net for films unlikely to receive preservation by commercial interests--particularly silent films, older independent features, ethnic films, dance documentation, and avant-garde works. Federal funds also support the preservation programs of the National Archives and the Library of Congress.\n\nThrough critically important, these programs merely chip away at the film preservation crisis. When adjusted for inflation, federal funding for the AFI-NEA and Library of Congress programs has fallen to half its 1980 level. The diminished funding is more strikingly seen in terms of the amount of laboratory work federal dollars can support. In 1980 the AFI-NEA grants of $514,215 (not counting matching funds) could support the preservation copying of the equivalent of 159 black-and-white silent features; in 1992 the AFI-NEA awards of $355,600 could fund copying for fewer than 26.\n\nOther federal programs support preservation-related activities on a project-by-project basis, although none specifically addresses the need for improving storage conditions. Certain types of films--most documentaries and newsreels, for example--fall between the cracks of existing programs. Some foundations have become preservation funders, though very few support projects in this area.\n\nAccess. Preservation is incomplete without public access to the preserved film. For public archives, access must be balanced against the need for physical preservation and the rights of the copyright owners. Archives share films with the public through screening programs, museum exhibitions, educational distribution, and on-site study. Materials unrestricted by copyright and donor agreements can be made more widely available through sale or licensing. Film preservation also brings benefits to the copyright holders. Public archives store early generation nitrate film for many studios (generally at no expense to the donors), provide technical preservation assistance, and locate missing film materials in foreign archives.\n\nHow can we measure success in film preservation? Standard quantitative measures-- feet of nitrate film copied and safety film produced--presume that the preservation battle centers exclusively on nitrate film and that the earliest nitrate-to-safety conversions are still acceptable by today's standards. Better indicators of success are the increased number of institutions with archival programs, the change in industry attitude toward the value of film libraries, the growth in public-private partnership projects, the shift from quantity measurement to quality standards in laboratory work, the repatriation of \"lost\" American films, and the growing recognition of importance of film types beyond the Hollywood fiction feature.\n\nToward a national program. This report recommends several topics to be explored and integrated into a national program, to be developed over the next twelve months:\n\nSecuring a viable and ongoing source of public funding for preserving films of cultural and historic value, particularly those not preserved by commercial interests.\n\nRe-framing physical preservation as an integrated \"whole film\" activity, recognizing the trade-offs of storage and film-to-film copying, examining the adequacy of electronic transfer for some films, and planning how technology will change preservation processes within the next decade.\n\nDeveloping mechanisms to coordinate public-private ventures and to facilitate communication among archives, industry and technical experts, as well as legal incentives for stimulating such preservation ventures.\n\nCreating a framework for providing greater access to publicly preserved films, and for educational use of others currently inaccessible.\n\nThe Librarian of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board invite written suggestions for the program as well as comments on the study. Responses received by September 30, 1993, will be folded into the next stage of the planning process.\n\n1. Scope of the Study\n\nA hundred years after the birth of motion pictures in the United States, this report asks: What are we doing to save America's film heritage for future generations? Film Preservation 1993 is a snapshot of film preservation as it is practiced today in the U.S. film industry and in public and nonprofit organizations. Mandated by the National Film Preservation Act of 1992,1 it is the first of two submissions to Congress by the Librarian of Congress and his advisory panel, the National Film Preservation Board. By describing the current state of film preservation, this report lays the framework for a planning document, which will present to Congress a national strategy for coordinating film preservation, developed in consultation with archivists, copyright holders, educators and others concerned with the survival and accessibility of American film.\n\nThis report has modest parameters. It describes only the current state of preservation and its problems, not future solutions (which is the goal of the Librarian's second Congressional submission). It is an outline of key issues, rather than a history of American film preservation, and chronicles the past only to the extent that comparisons to former practices, assumptions, and funding help illuminate the contemporary situation. Although video and film are increasingly interdependent, this report adheres to the legal directive of the National Film Preservation Act of 1992 and confines itself to preservation issues relating to film, not to television or video. It defines film narrowly as moving images captured on motion picture stock and intended for exhibition or documentation, not broadcast. (There are indeed serious preservation problems confronting America's television materials, and it is hoped that these might be the subject of another fact-finding effort.)\n\nInformation was gathered through interviews and library research, as well as through the public testimony and written statements--from over 100 organizations and individuals-- that form the core of this four-volume study. In a sense, the report in Volume 1 serves as a preface to those public comments. Transcripts of the two National Film Preservation Board public hearings, held in Los Angeles on February 12, 1993, and in Washington, D.C., on February 26, are reproduced in their entirety in Volumes 2 and 3. All written statements received before April 1, 1993 are reprinted in Volume 4. (The written statements include responses from those unable to testify in person as well as additional comments from participants in the hearings.)\n\n2. Urgency\n\nNow that the movies have reached their centennial, the idea that they deserve saving requires little defense. Films are not simply the province of \"buffs\" or exercises in nostalgia, but this century's most vital social memory and its most distinctive art form-- one at which the United States has excelled.\n\nFor all the evident values of film, one fact is clear: The battle for their preservation is being lost, despite certain inspiring efforts and hopeful signs. There are ways to quantify this failure, particularly in terms of public funding and of uncopied, decaying nitrate-base footage. But put most simply, the problem is this: Films of all types are deteriorating faster than archives can preserve them.\n\nFilm is a fragile medium, generally intended for a brief commercial life. Preservation tries to slow film's inevitable decay by controlling storage conditions and by copying endangered works onto more durable film stock. The director Peter Bogdanovich recalls writing in 1960 an article entitled \"Who Cares?\" about the importance of film preservation and having its title ironically borne out by being unable to get it published.(2) Because such articles and published expressions of concern are more common now,3 one might presume that the problems are well in hand. If, instead, film survival is at a crisis point, it is because three critical changes--conceptual, technical, and financial--have conspired.\n\nMore types of film are of cultural interest to scholars and the public, and thus seen to merit preservation attention. Traditional preservation efforts directed largely toward the Hollywood feature seem shortsighted, in light of the relative neglect of other types: newsreels, documentaries, experimental or avant-garde films, anthropological and regional films, advertising and corporate shorts, dance documentation, and even amateur home movies, especially of ethnic groups invisible in mainstream media.4\n\nSerious physical deterioration has been discovered in films produced within the last four decades. The traditional preservation efforts of public archives directed almost exclusively at copying volatile pre-1951 nitrate- base film may also be shortsighted, in light of two more recently discovered problems in \"safety film\": color fading and \"vinegar syndrome,\" an acetate-base decay (issues discussed further in Section 4).\n\nWhile public interest in saving older films seems never to have been higher, federal funding continues to decline and is now less than half of what it was in 1980. In that year, the AFI-NEA Preservation Program, the principal conduit for federal funds to the nation's archives, distributed an amount sufficient to copy the equivalent of 159 black-and-white silent features; in 1992 the grants could support the copying of fewer than 26.5 The Library of Congress' film copying funding has experienced a similar decline, in spite of the growth of its motion picture collections (as discussed further in Section 6).\n\nThat the United States is fighting a losing battle to save its film heritage is clearest from a sobering, often-noted historical fact. Current efforts of preservationists begin from the recognition that a great percentage of American film has already been irretrievably lost-- intentionally thrown away or allowed to deteriorate.\n\nExactly how much of America's film production has already been lost remains difficult to say. The most familiar statistic, which has attained its authority primarily through repetition, is that we have lost 50% of all titles produced before 1950.6 This estimate may not be inaccurate so long as one qualifies it in three ways. First, it would apply only to full-length fiction films. Anecdotal evidence suggests that survival rates for other film types, even major studio newsreels and shorts, are lower. Second, among those studio features, there is a sharp break in survival rates at 1929, the year that sound film became the industry standard. Features of the 1930s have been recently documented to survive at a rate of no less than 80%, probably closer to 90%.7 However, fewer than 20% of the features of the 1920s survive in complete form; for features of the 1910s, the survival rate falls to slightly above 10% (and those in copies generally made from projection prints, not negatives, which are almost entirely lost). Figure 1 details approximate survival rates for American silent features. Third and last, the familiarity of that 50%-before-1950 statistic also implies, by omission, that there are few preservation problems with films produced after that year--something which is not the case, as will be discussed.\n\nFigure 1: Survival Rates of American Silent Feature Films (PDF, 115KB)8 (Based on working lists of holdings in U.S. and foreign archives)\n\nThere is in the testimony and submissions that follow a general recognition among the industry and public/nonprofit sector respondents of the urgency of these preservation problems. There is universal agreement that more must be done in the few remaining years of this century if the next generation is not to look back on current efforts as little more than a tragic failure.\n\nWhere there is less agreement is in the balance of priorities and responsibilities. Disagreements arise particularly over films which are publicly experienced but privately owned. If there is a single division that separates most of the preservation issues discussed in this report, it is between two categories of films: those that have evident market value and owners able to exploit that value; and the other films, often labeled \"orphans,\" that lack either clear copyright holders or commercial potential to pay for their continued preservation. In practice, the former are primarily features from major Hollywood studios; the latter--numerically the majority--include newsreels and documentaries, avant-garde and independent productions, silent films where copyright has expired, even certain Hollywood sound films from now defunct studios. For these films the urgency may be greatest.\n\n3. What Is \"Preservation\"?\n\nFilms are ephemeral and fragile products. For the technical reasons outlined in the next section, even the most durable of films can become unusable in less than a single human lifespan, although some types have proven to deteriorate more rapidly and spectacularly than others. While preservation can be thought of as any effort to keep a film in a viewable form, most archivists consider a film preserved only when it is both (1) viewable in its original format with its full visual and aural9 values retained, and (2) protected for the future by \"preprint\" material10 through which subsequent viewing copies can be created.\n\nIn practice and in casual language, preservation has usually been synonymous with duplication. The archival rallying slogan for the last two decades has been \"Nitrate Won't Wait,\" and the primary preservation task--still far from accomplished--has been to copy unstable, nitrate-base film without significant loss of quality onto more durable \"safety\" stock. For a variety of reasons, this definition of preservation is being rethought and broadened to include the costly issue of storage conditions, as well as the apparently contradictory issue of public access. Preservation is increasingly being defined less as a one-time \"fix\" (measurable in footage copied) than as an ongoing process.11\n\nRelated terms needs to be distinguished from preservation. \"Restoration\" goes beyond the physical copying of surviving material into reconstruction of the most authentic version of a film. Ideally, this requires comparison of all surviving material on a given title, consultation of printed records of the production and exhibition history, and then decisions regarding the film's \"original\" state.12 Also distinguishable from preservation is \"conservation,\" which requires no physical copying, only the decision to treat film material with greater care because of its perceived use as a future preservation source. Typically, a print which has been regarded as an access or \"reference\" copy becomes a conservation copy when it is suspected to be the best surviving material on that title.13\n\nIn the widest sense, preservation is the assurance that a film will continue to exist in something close to its original form. Thus, to the extent that preservation is a commitment made to the future, it has further complexities. The issue has often been put this way: Can a film be considered \"preserved\" if it is physically protected but held only under private ownership? That question has surfaced in a number of widely publicized contexts, including the \"colorization\" controversy of the late 1980s14 and the concerns in 1989 and 1990 over foreign purchases of American studio film libraries.15 Recently, it has been reasonable for studios to suggest that films to which they hold copyright are their own preservation responsibility and that public archives might direct their resources elsewhere.16 It has also been reasonable for public archives to point to the studios' poor record of saving their films, alongside a commercial history of \"lowest-bid\" preservation quality.17 However, several new public-private partnerships suggest that these positions are not so intransigent or contradictory as they once seemed.\n\nIn what sense preservation is now also understood as a trust to the present as well as to the future is a question taken up in Section 8, \"Public Access.\"\n\n4. Technical Background\n\nA few technical notes may be useful before turning to current preservation practices. Some of these facts relate to longstanding preservation problems; others have taken on new prominence.\n\nPhysically, all motion picture film consists of two primary layers with a binder to hold them together: emulsions (which carry the image) and a transparent support base. Film preservation is necessary because of the very nature of these materials: emulsions fade, the binder breaks down, and the plastics of the support base decompose.\n\nA. Film Bases.\n\nHistorically, motion-picture bases have been of three main types: (1) cellulose nitrate (usually called simply nitrate), in commercial use through the early 1950s; (2) cellulose acetate (usually called acetate), available for some uses since the 1910s but widely employed only after 1950;18 and (3) polyester, available since the mid- 1950s but still in only scattered use. Both acetate and polyester are sometimes called \"safety\" film, in distinction from nitrate.\n\nNitrate base had certain excellent qualities, but its chemical composition destabilizes over time. As it ages it has a tendency to shrink, to give off gasses that destroy the emulsion, and to become highly flammable at relatively low temperatures. Once a nitrate fire begins, it is nearly impossible to extinguish, since in burning it creates its own oxygen. It was a rash of fires in the late 1940s that led to the industry's conversion to triacetate safety film. More recently, large nitrate fires have occurred in the United States (notably at vaults of the National Archives in 1977 and 1978 and at the George Eastman House in 1978) and in foreign archives (most disastrously at Mexico's Cineteca Nacional in 1982, and at a warehouse for the Cinémathèque Française outside Paris in 1980).\n\nThe hazards of nitrate should not be minimized but it is also possible to exaggerate them. Under the right conditions, nitrate film can have a long useful life, as demonstrated by surviving 90-year-old examples, such as an original negative for The Great Train Robbery (1903).19 In some stages of decomposition, nitrate can ignite spontaneously, though not so easily as is sometimes feared.20\n\nFor many years nitrate was considered discardable after being copied onto safety stock, but increasingly archives are rethinking this policy. The chief reason for retaining usable nitrate is that it is closer to the original, often carrying a shimmering visual beauty lost in even the best new copies, whose emulsions are incapable of reproducing nitrate film's tonal qualities. The nitrate retained is then available for reuse as duplication technology improves, as well as for color-tinting records and for special public screenings.21 It is also increasingly expensive to dispose of nitrate in a way that meets environmental and health standards.22\n\nAcetate-based film solved the fire hazard and was long considered an ideal preservation material. Kept properly stored, it may still be that. But the discovery in the 1980s of what is popularly called \"vinegar syndrome,\" from the acetic acid smell given off when acetate base begins to decay, is currently giving film preservationists serious pause. There is increasing scientific evidence that, kept under identical conditions, acetate film decays at approximately the same rate as nitrate, though with nothing of nitrate's volatility. This is not illogical: Both are cellulosic plastics and apparently deteriorate at similar speed. The later stages of acetate decay do not destroy emulsions in the same way as does nitrate but nevertheless renders the film unusable.\n\nOne basic archival principle is that preservation is not accomplished unless the new medium has a considerably longer life than the original from which it is copied. On the surface, continued copying onto acetate base would seem to violate that principle. But there are two reasons to qualify such a conclusion: First, the original nitrate print is older and usually well into its decomposition cycle; and, second, the new acetate print can be given proper storage right from the start. Thus vinegar syndrome has not been detected in films duplicated under archival conditions and put into ideal storage immediately. The implications of vinegar syndrome in acetate have not yet been fully assimilated into preservation practice, but scientific research into its causes has also been accompanied by compelling evidence that it can be delayed by proper storage.23\n\nPolyester base seems to promise a significantly longer lifespan than acetate, although archivists have been reluctant to embrace it. Only after the evidence of vinegar syndrome in acetate was there much renewed consideration of polyester, especially because, at least in its early manufacture, it showed problems with the binder separating from the emulsion, leading to loss of the image. It also was long unavailable in the 35mm intermediate stocks needed for preprint copies.24 Among the largest public archives, only the George Eastman House and the National Archives have made limited nitrate conversion onto polyester stocks. Institutions dealing primarily in 16mm have had wider access to polyester; the New York Public Library's Donnell Media Center has ordered all its film copies on polyester since 1980.\n\nB. Emulsions and Color Fading.\n\nOne other current preservation concern rivals that of uncopied nitrate in significance: the fading of the color dyes in \"dye-coupler\" films-- better known as \"Eastmancolor\"--which won over the industry in the early 1950s. It is the least quantifiable, least easily solvable, and probably most expensive of current preservation problems. Among theatrical prints and home movies of the 1950s through the 1970s, the problem is often painfully obvious in color images that have turned a low-contrast brownish pink. The technical irony is that earlier color prints--in the \"Technicolor\" process--have essentially retained their original hues, though of course those before 1950 are on unstable nitrate base. This problem with color emulsions parallels that facing libraries in the preservation of twentieth-century books on acetic paper, which deteriorates much more rapidly than older papers. In both cases new technology created a less expensive product--and a nightmare for the future.\n\nThe Technicolor system differed from Eastmancolor at both the negative and the print stages. To produce its negatives, the bulky \"three-strip\" Technicolor camera (in use from 1933 through the early 1950s) filtered the visible light spectrum to capture the blue, red, and green portions on three separate black-and-white negatives, not subject to fading because they involved no color dyes. (A two-strip Technicolor system, in use from 1922 to 1933, functioned similarly but caught less of the full spectrum.) Eastmancolor's supreme commercial advantage came in producing a \"monopack\" multilayer emulsion that captured color on a single negative, although the complex chemistry that allowed for this also made the vegetable dyes, when \"coupled\" in developing, unstable. Technicolor release prints for theaters--known also as \"imbibition\" or \"dye-transfer\" prints--were created by the transfer of previously manufactured coal-tar dyes onto blank film through matrices, in a way roughly comparable to printing with inks on paper. In Eastmancolor's dye-coupler prints, the dyes are created, as they are in the negative, through a chemical processing that again leaves certain colors unstable.\n\nThere are several complications about the relationship of color fading in negatives and in release prints that are worth mentioning. Technicolor prints continued to be made until 1974, or for twenty years after the Technicolor negative process was abandoned (the three matrices necessary for prints being created by filters from the single dye-coupler negative).25 Thus it is possible for the color in Technicolor projection prints to look superb even while the original negative is in danger. Contrarily, it is common for dye- coupler prints to fade to that dull purple even while preprint material exists that allows for the striking of excellent new prints. There remains, however, dispute about the state of the original studio negatives from this era and of preprint backup material made from those negatives. (Although the fading rate is slower in some preprint material, restoration expert Robert Harris in his submission claims that \"we have lost the original negatives to almost every [color] film of the 50s into the 60s.\")26 Undoubtedly there is great variation in the rate of fading depending upon when the original stock was manufactured and the quality of the original processing.\n\nOver the last two decades, the Eastman Kodak Company has introduced a number of lower-fading preprint and print stocks. 27 These have found use in both public archives and private preservation programs (such as the Turner Entertainment Company's recent recopying of MGM duplicate negatives, originally copied in the 1970s). If Kodak's lower-fading stocks were long ignored by the industry, it was essentially for economic reasons (the low-fade stocks of the late 1970s cost about 10% more).\n\nDespite a few imaginative experiments, there remains only one proven method to prevent color fading: through what are known as \"separations.\" In this widely used process, color film is copied through red, blue, and green filters to create three separate black- and-white records (roughly equivalent to what the Technicolor process created in the camera), each of which holds one of the three color records and which cannot fade because no dyes are involved. In theory, it is then a simple matter to recreate the color by combining the separations. In practice, there have been frequent problems, especially since most separations are not tested at the time of their creation to see if they can be recombined. Such a full testing would essentially double the initial cost of making separations, currently running at least $25,000 for two-hour feature.28 Even if tested, separations can develop their own preservation problems; shrinkage differences among the three rolls can prevent their alignment, creating a hazy, unfocusable image in the new color print.29\n\nOnly one other method is known to reduce, if not completely prevent, color fading: cold-and-dry storage.\n\nC. Storage.\n\nSeveral of the technical matters described above--especially vinegar syndrome, color fading, and the retention of nitrate after copying--have conspired to give a new prominence in current preservation practice to storage conditions. The combined effect of lowered temperatures and lowered relative humidity in retarding both vinegar syndrome and color fading is startling and increasingly well documented. The one encouraging finding about these deterioration processes is how significantly both can be slowed by the right storage conditions.\n\nThe variations are complicated, but to take one example, the lowering of storage temperatures by 20 degrees Fahrenheit, from 80 degrees to 60 degrees, while lowering relative humidity by 20 percent, from 65% to 45%, delays the onset of vinegar syndrome from approximately 15 years after filmstock manufacture to 100 years (as illustrated on Figure 2). The effect of storage conditions on color fading is less easy to quantify because fading depends so much on the initial stock and processing quality, but the effect of cold-and-dry storage on relative rates of fading are equally dramatic. For instance, by lowering temperature from 75 degrees F to 45degrees, the color fading which would have occurred in 10 years will take 100 years (as illustrated on Figure 3).\n\nFor such reasons, several large and specially designed storage vaults have recently opened or are under construction both at private studios (Paramount, opened in 1990; Warner Bros., opened in 1993) and public archives (the Museum of Modern Art and the National Archives, both due to open in 1994).30 For such reasons too, recommended storage temperatures and relative humidities from the national organizations ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) have been lowered in the last few years. SMPTE's pending proposal for \"extended term\" storage of color prints suggests a maximum of 35 degrees F and of 20-30% relative humidity and of black-and-white prints a maximum of 70 degrees F and 20-30% RH.31 For public archives particularly these are difficult and expensive proposals. In its 1986 survey of public collections, the National Center for Film and Video Preservation found only 11 of the 28 responding institutions able to maintain their safety film at temperatures of less than 61 degrees F, and only 8 institutions could maintain a relative humidity of 45% or less.32 Still, since any lowering of temperature and humidity has major impact on film longevity, the SMPTE storage proposals can be thought of as goals. In practical terms, it has proven easier and cheaper to lower temperature than to lower humidity.34 For certain types of films (especially local history and ethnic culture on 8mm and super 8mm) where laboratory copying is essentially unavailable, proper storage is the only viable preservation alternative.\n\n[Chart: Average Storage Temperature]\n\nFigure 2: Effect of Temperature and Humidity on Acetate Film: When Will Vinegar Syndrome Begin Under Varying Storage Conditions? (PDF, 151KB) (Based on data from The Image Permanence Institute Storage Guide for Acetate Film)33\n\nFigure 3: Effect of Temperature on Color Fading (Holding Relative Humidity at 40%) (PDF, 54.7KB) (From proposed SMPTE RP 131)\n\nStorage is not the simple or full solution to current preservation problems: The start-up costs are huge (the Museum of Modern Art's two-building facility will cost around $12 million), the ongoing electrical expenses are considerable (Paramount's electric bill for its new vault alone runs to several hundred thousand dollars annually),35 and access to the films becomes problematic (since major changes in temperature and humidity may also be damaging to film).36 Nevertheless, storage is increasingly regarded as the critical factor in film longevity and is still not adequately integrated into public preservation plans and funding programs.\n\nD. Technology and the Future.\n\nAlthough this report is concerned only with current practice, it is worth commenting briefly on upcoming regulations and evolving technologies. Within the next few years, two chemicals routinely used in film preservation are expected to be banned for environmental reasons. Laboratory experts have not yet found adequate substitutes for use in film cleaning (essential in preparing older film for copying) and wetgate printing (a method which fills in scratches and other flaws, also essential for copying from older film).37\n\nIt also needs noting that there is no reasonable-cost electronic preservation solution on the immediate horizon, for two reasons: (1) a 35mm frame of film holds a huge amount of information, nearly 5 million pixels, expensive to capture electronically without loss; even the currently proposed digital standard for high definition television (HDTV), which should begin to be publicly available in the United States in 1995, will capture less than half of the visual information on 35mm film;38 and (2), should a reasonably priced method of electronic preservation develop, archivists would need to be cautious in its adoption because of the history of rapid obsolescence of electronic technologies. (Already a central problem in video preservation is the difficulty in constructing equipment to play recordings made only a few years ago; at least six major incompatible formats have evolved into obsolescence the last 20 years.)39 Clearly, an electronic preservation medium will develop sometime in the future--and that expectation reinforces the importance of proper storage--but while the technology evolves and the experiments continue, there is general agreement that film remains its own unrivaled preservation medium.\n\n5. Film Preservation in Practice\n\nWhile film base decay and color fading affect all motion pictures, the approach for addressing these problems varies greatly across the film industry and public/nonprofit organizations. The approaches reflect the funding available for preservation as well as the commercial rights owned by the repository. To compare the approaches, those holding film materials have been grouped below into broad categories: (A) studios with large film libraries, (B) independent producers and distributors, (C) stock footage libraries, (D) large public archives, (E) specialist film archives, (F) public institutions with small film collections, (G) private collectors, and (H) foreign archives.40\n\nA. Studios with Large Film Libraries\n\n41\n\nFilm studios traditionally captured their revenue from exhibiting new films. For the industry's first 60 years, there was no mass audience for \"last-year's pictures\"; after a film's theatrical release cycle, most prints were destroyed and the preprint material, if still useable, was shelved and perhaps used as a source for clips.42 The advent of television brought a new market for some older sound films but still left studios with many other titles of little apparent commercial value. Confronted with limited markets, rising storage costs, and increasing insurance premiums for keeping nitrate film on the backlot, most studios either sold their libraries or copied more valuable titles onto safety stock, disposing of the nitrate. During the 1960s and 1970s some major studios, such as Columbia, MGM and United Artists, deposited their nitrate materials with public film archives.\n\nThe growth of secondary markets over the past decade has reversed the industry's traditional revenue sources. After their theatrical run, films now have several additional lives through licensing to cable, network television, home videotape and laserdisc (and can be expected to have more as new electronic delivery technologies develop).43 For an \"average\" major studio feature in 1990, revenues from these ancillary markets outstripped those from domestic and foreign theatrical release by about a million dollars, and the balance continues to shift.44 With films generating revenue over an extended time span, the studio library has become a key corporate asset. (For diversified corporations, film libraries also serve as \"software\" for other operations.45 For example, after purchasing MGM/UA in 1986, Ted Turner sold off the production operations but retained the MGM library for broadcast on his cable networks.)\n\nThe actual value of film libraries has been hotly debated by industry analysts.46 Each title's evaluation depends on anticipated audience interest over time and ownership of the exploitation rights as well as new technological applications. Commercial rights can be divided among different parties by geographic market, time period, distribution medium, language, and other factors. The approximate size of the libraries of industry respondents participating in the Los Angeles hearing is shown in Figure 4.\n\n[Figure 4: Film Libraries of Studio Respondents (PDF, 64.7KB)]47\n\nSince the beginning of the \"home video era\" around 1980, most studios have come to recognize the potential long-term value of their film libraries and some have embarked on ambitious \"asset protection\" programs. Paramount is a case in point. In the last five years it has spent over $35 million inspecting its negatives, audio tracks and color separations, doing film repair, and printing new preservation materials. In 1990 it opened a new $11-million archives building, with low-humidity cold vaults for preprint and color materials. Paramount stores second master printing copies in an underground facility in Pennsylvania and tracks its 750,000 items worldwide through an automated inventory system. By investing in the physical care of its collections, the studio expects to extend the shelf life of film elements and expedite retrieval.48 Industry storage practices, of course, vary. For example, two studio respondents store most film material at commercial vaults; several are in the process of automating their film inventory.\n\nMost large studios now routinely keep preservation masters49 of films they produce as well as additional materials--such as foreign-language soundtracks or edited airline versions--required for ancillary markets. For each title, the studio may keep many different preprint and sound elements. For films distributed by major studios but produced by an independent company, the situation is somewhat different. Studios usually hold sufficient materials to generate release copies, but not the preservation back- up of color separations or the original camera negative. The depth of preservation protection depends on the scope and duration of the studio's commercial rights and the film's expected value over time. Films in which studios hold limited commercial interest generally do not receive the same depth of protection as the studio's own productions.50\n\nPost-1950 safety films made before the introduction of studio asset protection programs present other complicated problems. According to some witnesses, the preprint materials of many well-known films of the 1950s and 1960s have deteriorated through color fading and soundtrack decay.51 The inherent physical problems were aggravated by substandard laboratory work, poor storage conditions, and inadequate inventory control. To redress past archival practices and capitalize on public interest in older titles, some studios have mounted well-publicized restoration campaigns. In 1990, for example, Warner Bros. announced the restoration of 26 \"classics,\" including Rebel Without a Cause.52 Disney, Paramount, Sony and Universal have undertaken similar efforts.53 One central question remains about studio preservation: Will the secondary markets stimulate high-quality preservation of all studio-held films, including newsreels, 54 shorts and B-pictures?55 While industry sources see that potential, others wonder if efforts will be extended beyond the more commercially viable titles and urge public-private programs to verify the quality of preservation materials for privately owned American film titles.56\n\nB. Independent Producers and Distributors\n\nhe film preservation practices of independent producers and distributors are as varied as the types of organizations in this catch-all category. Independents range from corporations that produce outside the major studio structure to single avant-garde artists distributing films from their basements. In general, these operations are alike in lacking the resources and organizational continuity to mount the aggressive asset protection programs of the larger studios. Several examples suggest the range of practices.\n\nLucasfilm, founded by director George Lucas, has gone to great lengths to preserve film, paper records and artifacts related to its productions.57 To use Star Wars (1977) as an example, Lucasfilm's distributor keeps the usual master cut negative and printing materials in a climate-controlled vault but, in addition, Lucasfilm has retained all other production elements. The firm has built its own archives building to house these materials.\n\nFilmmaker Victor Nunez, whose Ruby in Paradise shared the 1993 Sundance Festival best picture award, represents the other end of the feature-production spectrum. To Nunez's independent company, raising funds is of more immediate concern than preserving past works. Nunez pays for storage of some preprint materials at a commercial lab, and discards outtakes and the original camera negatives. He does not own prints of his features. In fact, since the distributor of his 1984 feature A Flash of Green went bankrupt, he has been unable to get a print for theatrical screenings and cannot legally make a new one. He suspects that the Library of Congress copy, deposited for copyright protection, is one of the few prints in existence.58\n\nProblems with distributors have led some independents to store and release films themselves. Documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman distributes through his own company, Zipporah Films, and has retained the full record--outtakes, preprint, one- quarter-inch tape, magnetic soundtrack and prints--for his 26 films. This amounts to roughly 16.5 million feet of film, tape and track and a $7000 yearly storage bill.59\n\nThe works of avant-garde and documentary filmmakers are among the most at risk--due to the conditions under which the films were originally made, the limited number of release prints, and inability of filmmakers to pay for adequate storage for preprint materials.60 For many years laboratories filled a gap by storing films free of charge to clients that used their services. Lab closings in New York City, however, left filmmakers and archives scurrying to rescue abandoned films and revealed the shortcomings of this arrangement.61 Filmmaker cooperatives and media centers sometimes house and distribute the only known print of contemporary avant-garde works.\n\nAs witnesses in Los Angeles point out,62 probably the first step is educating filmmakers about the preservation needs of their works. Canyon Cinema, a filmmaker-run distribution cooperative in San Francisco, recently recognized that some of its prints were rare works on color reversal stock and initiated a preservation program, funded by the Andy Warhol Foundation, through which filmmakers supervise the making of preprint material and new prints of their own works.63 The Estate Project for Artists with AIDS now assists filmmakers with AIDS to plan for the orderly disposition and archival housing of their films.64\n\nThe point to be gleaned from these examples is that independently made films are much less likely than studio productions to be maintained under conditions that will prolong their survival. Nationally distributed independent features present a particular problem, as their print and preprint materials may be scattered and controlled by different commercial interests who have limited rights and hence little incentive to invest in long- term preservation. Most smaller independents who maintain rights to their own films lack the resources, information, and scale of operations to develop comprehensive archival programs.\n\nC. Stock Footage Libraries\n\nStock footage libraries are as open-ended a category as independent producers. The term \"stock footage\" refers to any sort of existing moving images sold or licensed for reuse in another context. Footage 89, the most extensive guide to American footage sources, estimates that there are 160 American companies characterizing themselves as stock footage libraries and hundreds of producers who license footage for reuse on an occasional basis.65\n\nStock footage libraries have, in some cases, the only known copy of films of historical interest and fill a special niche by their documentation of regional lifestyles, popular pastimes and daily life and work--activities generally considered too ordinary for national newsreels but whose documentation has increased in value over time. As market-driven operations, such businesses pay for their own preservation work and generally give priority to the most salable footage.\n\nMoviecraft, Inc., is a typical example. Moviecraft specializes in abandoned films-- educational, industrial, and advertising shorts produced for specialized audiences, discarded after use and no longer under copyright protection. The firm licenses footage to researchers and copies its nitrate, preprint and print materials as income permits.66 Moviecraft and other commercial archival respondents point out that the Copyright Amendments Act of 1992, which effectively extends the initial copyright term of all post-1963 titles to 75 years, has had the result of discouraging stock footage libraries from salvaging and copying abandoned films of that era.67\n\nD. Large Public Archives\n\nThe largest U.S. public archives--the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the International Museum of Photography and Film at George Eastman House (GEH), the UCLA Film and Television Archive, and the Library of Congress (LC)--have among them 224,000 film titles (see Figure 5). Adding the collections of the National Archives, these five institutions hold an estimated 89% of the total film footage in public repositories.68\n\nThese archives began collecting film before the industry took an active interest in preservation. MoMA, the oldest U.S. fiction film archive, started collecting films in 1935 to guarantee that copies of important titles would be preserved as a cultural record; it reached special agreements with studios to distribute films for educational use. The George Eastman House, opening in 1949 with the support of Eastman Kodak, formed a study collection of silent and independent films as part of its documentation of the history of photography. UCLA Film and Television Archive, founded in 1965 as part of the University of California, has developed extensive holdings of Hollywood fiction film and newsreels to support academic research and study.\n\nThe two federal film repositories began as collections of government and cultural record. The National Archives retains preprint and print material for U.S. government-produced films as well as actuality footage69 documenting U.S. history. In a sense, the National Archives serves as the \"studio archive\" for the federal government. 70 The Library of Congress selects prints of films deposited for U.S. copyright protection and has extensive holdings of American film productions of all types.\n\nIn their early years, these archives acquired culturally significant films in whatever form was available. Prints were obtained for in-house study and exhibition, but preprint material was also sought, as its acquisition assured that the title could be preserved and eventually made available to the public. In the 1960s and 1970s studios transferred to MoMA, GEH, UCLA, and LC extensive nitrate preprint collections; many newsreels, notably the series Universal News and The March of Time, were donated to the National Archives which completed conversion of its nitrate to safety film in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe four large fiction film archives now house a wide range of preservation source materials--nitrate preprint, nitrate prints representing the best surviving copy, vintage theatrical prints on safety film, and preservation masters created by the archives. In terms of number of titles, these collections are far larger than industry collections (compare Figures 4 and 5). But for each feature title, particularly for the post-nitrate period (post-1950), the public archives have less depth and variety of preservation source material. To return to the Star Wars example, the Library of Congress has copyrighted release prints and reference videodiscs, but the distributor Twentieth Century Fox holds extensive preprint materials and some circulation copies, and Lucasfilm maintains other production elements.\n\nThe preservation priority for the large public archives has been the duplication of nitrate film, particularly from the silent and early sound periods. Specialists have learned to restore films by working backward from the surviving prints and piecing together preprint elements. All five archives share information on preservation activities through International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) and have on-going programs to copy deteriorating film.71 UCLA, for example, has five full-time preservation employees as well as vault attendants who inspect and service its collections. The UCLA preservation staff coordinate restoration projects and physically prepare film for copying at specialized commercial laboratories. Like most archives outside of the federal government, UCLA contracts out for photographic and sound recording services (see Section 6.B.3).\n\nThe defining problem for public archive preservation programs is funding. The increasing difficulty in securing funds for routine film copying was a recurrent theme in the interviews, written submissions and hearings. While the federal institutions support most preservation copying internally, MoMA, UCLA, and GEH are heavily dependent on outside fund-raising and piece together their preservation budgets from many sources. MoMA's $350,000 1992 laboratory copying budget, for example, came entirely from endowment income, grants, and donations.72 In 1992 UCLA funded nearly 92% of its laboratory expenditures of $292,694 from outside sources.73 With federal grants and state arts council support decreasing (see Sections 6.B.1 and 7), these archives are increasingly turning to high profile preservation projects to generate income for more routine work.\n\nCan the sale and distribution of films by these tax-exempt archives become a funding source for preservation? Only to a limited extent. It should be remembered that the large fiction archives hold copies, but not the rights to most films in their collections. In cases where the films are in the public domain or the rights have been transferred, the archive may sell footage to help sustain its program. In 1992 UCLA raised 29% of its entire operating budget though revenue-generating activities, principally the licensing of footage from the Hearst Metrotone News, the rights to which, along with the physical copies were donated to the University in the early 1980s.74 George Eastman House preserved and distributed through Kino International the Josephine Baker film Princess Tam-Tam (1935), netting some $20,000 for other projects.75 To judge from the submissions, however, this funding option seems more immediately feasible for regional archives holding primarily news and amateur footage.\n\nWith recent research reinforcing the importance of environmentally controlled storage, many archives are now working to improve vault conditions. MoMA's facility now under construction consists of a 28,000-square-foot building for safety film and a separate 9000-square-foot structure for nitrate. Aside from a small studio vault since converted to other uses, this is probably the first U.S. building specifically designed for nitrate storage in the last three decades.76 Archives II, the new National Archives building nearing completion in College Park, Maryland, will store color film at 25 degrees Fahrenheit and 30% relative humidity and black-and-white preprint at 65 degrees F, 30% RH. The vaults feature an air filtration system to strain out pollutants.77\n\nOther archives are struggling to retrofit existing buildings to meet to new storage standards. LC has spent several years upgrading the mechanical systems in two of its three vault facilities, at Suitland, Maryland, and Dayton, Ohio. Within the next few years, UCLA will place its acetate film in the University of California southern library storage facility, now under construction. Its nitrate, however, will remain in commercial storage, built over forty years ago and lacking mechanical humidity and temperature controls.78\n\n[Figure 5: Collection and Access Programs of Public Archive Respondents (PDF, 356KB)]\n\nE. Specialist Archives\n\nThe specialist archives acquire and preserve films relating to a specific subject, region, ethnic group or genre. Taking root in the 1970s and 1980s, specialist archives answered the public's growing interest in independent, documentary and avant-garde film and brought together source materials in emerging areas of film and cultural studies. Some have become international leaders in their field. Founded in 1970 as an exhibition space for alternative film, the Anthology Film Archives, for example, has built one of the major avant-garde film collections in the world.\n\nSpecialist archives may be units within larger libraries, museums or universities, such as Iowa State University's American Archives of the Factual Film, or autonomous nonprofits such as Northeast Historic Film, a regional collection devoted to the moving images of northern New England. Fifteen specialist archives submitted comments for this study; the range of interests is suggested in Figure 5.79\n\nNewer to the field, these specialists generally do not have as well-established (or as well- funded) preservation programs as the five large public archives. With several significant exceptions,80 these archives are primarily safety-film collections, and thus have not been compelled by the nitrate threat to focus energies on film copying. Indeed, as is pointed out in the submissions, their first preservation task is identifying endangered material and bringing it into archival custody.81 The Southwest Film/Video Archives at Southern Methodist University rescued from disposal entertainment films made for African American audiences; the Japanese American National Museum has located home movies of Japanese American daily life in the 1920s-1940s (including film clandestinely shot in World War II internment camps) through ties with the Japanese American community; the National Center for Jewish Film has searched several continents for films relating to the Jewish experience. It should be mentioned, too, that some collections, such as the New York Public Library's Donnell Media Center, were never intended as archives. They were started as film screening and study centers and were pressed into a preservation role, as titles dropped out of distribution and prints became increasingly rare. Others--particularly the regional archives like the Oregon Historical Society--hold small gauge stock (8mm and super 8mm), reversal film for which there is no economical and practical means of film copying.\n\nThe common thread for these organizations is an \"as-funds-permit\" approach to preservation. Usually they support preservation copying through a patchwork of funding sources, and their small staffs juggle many other duties. Among the specialist archives participating in this study, only half received funds from their own institution for laboratory work in 1992; most supported film preservation primarily through outside grants or gifts. To offset operational expenses, some collections of amateur and documentary film are turning to licensing footage. The Bishop Museum Archives promotes itself as one of two sources of Hawaiian actuality film in that state. The National Center for Jewish Film (NCJF) helps subsidize preservation through the sale of videotapes and the rental of exhibition prints as well as the licensing of footage for which it controls the rights. The NCJF likens these operations to its \"museum store,\" a means of raising money while increasing public access to its collections.\n\nIncreasingly concerned by vinegar syndrome and color fading, specialist archives are stepping up efforts to improve storage conditions and regularize film inspection. A few, like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, have new environmentally controlled facilities; others, like the American Archives of the Factual Film and the Pacific Film Archive, are refitting storage areas in their parent institutions. Large and small alike, public archives generally see their fundamental preservation problem as funding: As films decay and public demands increase, how can they raise the funds to accelerate copying and improve storage?82\n\nF. Public Institutions with Small Film Collections\n\nHundreds of government offices, historical societies, museums, universities, libraries, and nonprofit associations hold films scattered among their own organizational records or among collections of personal papers and educational resources. Just how many public institutions hold the best surviving copies of films of historic or cultural interest is difficult to say. Neither the American Association for State and Local History (AASLH) or the Society of American Archivists has surveyed members regarding film holdings in recent years, although the AASLH notes an eight-fold growth since 1959 in the number of local history collections, some of which could have amateur footage or locally produced films.83 In his survey of stock footage sources, Richard Prelinger identified 1,750 public and commercial collections holding \"unique moving image material (or material not easily accessed through other sources)\" and allowing some form of public access. At the Washington hearing, Prelinger concluded that for films scattered in U.S. repositories, the \"the state of information is pretty terrible;...decentralization makes it very difficult to have a broad picture of what actually still exists in this country.\"84\n\nIn terms of film preservation, the major problem for these disparate \"non-film\" organizations is simply finding out what to do. The Grand Rapids Public Library submission85 describes the effort required by smaller generalist organizations to save deteriorating films found in their collections. Receiving the Blissveldt Romance as a gift, the public library discovered through research that the locally produced 1915 nitrate film contained the earliest known footage of Grand Rapids, Michigan, and represented a rare surviving example of a type of regional fiction filmmaking common to the Teens. After the city historian made numerous contacts, the library eventually received an AFI-NEA grant to cover part of the laboratory copying costs. Using this $1,100 in federal money as leverage, it then worked to raise an additional $5,000 locally to cover the full preservation of Blissveldt and a second early nonfiction film. The copies have since been shown in Grand Rapids and reproduced in several productions. The point here is that most small public organizations with historically valuable films are not equipped to preserve them without expert technical advice and support.\n\nG. Collectors\n\nThe most shadowy part of the U.S. film-holding community is the private collector. Collectors range from filmmakers with prints of their own works to film buffs. Although the vast majority hold poorer copies of films also held in studio or public collections, some hold rare materials, like the recently discovered tinted, silent Frankenstein (1910) or the scenes censored from King Kong (1933).86 Some public- spirited film collectors have donated their personal collections to archives.87\n\nStudios have long argued that collectors are a major market for pirates trafficking in unauthorized prints. The industry-funded Motion Picture Association of America, through its Film Security Office, has investigated film collecting activities. Several well- publicized law suits in the 1970s discouraged collectors from openly discussing their holdings.88\n\nStudio restoration projects, however, have spurred new interest in working with private collectors. Seeking lost stereo sound tracks for some its 1950s films, Warners Bros., for example, put out a call to borrow stereo release prints in private hands. The studio guaranteed immunity from legal prosecution to those who lent the prints for copying.89 Several studio archivists privately admit to obtaining copies from collectors of titles the studio has lost. At both hearings, there was discussion among industry representatives of the possibility of an amnesty for collectors of Hollywood film.90\n\nH. Foreign Archives\n\nForeign archives also hold valuable preservation source material for American film. Particularly in the early years of distribution abroad, foreign archives scooped up American release prints left over from theatrical runs. Like their American counterparts, they also absorbed private collections. Foreign archives have been especially reluctant to reveal their exact holdings of American films, fearing confiscation and possible legal action.\n\nIt is known, however, that a large number of lost or damaged American films exist in copies held abroad, particularly in Eastern Europe. For the film production of the 1920s, for example, approximately 35% of complete American features survive only in foreign archives (see Figure 11). In an international survey of archival holdings of films listed in the National Film Registry, foreign archives, when guaranteed anonymity, reported holding some form of preprint material for about 50%. There were three European archives that each had 20 to 25 titles, roughly equal to numbers found at the Museum of Modern Art or the Library of Congress.91\n\n6. Federal Funding of Film Preservation\n\nA. Preservation Copying and the Copyright Law\n\nThe public funding of film preservation brings up questions of film ownership. Public archives are limited legally in the ways they may use most films in their collections. U.S. copyright law distinguishes between ownership of copyright (or of any of the exclusive rights of copyright) and ownership of the \"material object\" in which the work is \"embodied.\"92 For motion pictures, the original work can be embodied and distributed in 35mm film, 16mm film, videotape, laserdisc and other formats. Thus the owner of a physical copy, such as a videotape, might watch it privately in the home but is generally prohibited from duplicating or publicly exhibiting that copy without consent of the copyright holder. Public archives hold the physical copies, not the commercial rights, to most films in their collections.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee's discussions preceding passage of the 1976 Copyright Act took note of the copyright questions surrounding film preservation work and cited a \"fair use\" exemption for archives copying deteriorating films for preservation purposes.93 Archives, however, are restricted in certain other uses of the copyright-protected films they physically preserve. (They may make films available for on-site study but without permission of the copyright holder or the transfer of rights, archives generally cannot publicly exhibit copyrighted films or distribute them for sale. For further discussion of these access questions, involving copyright, fair use, and \"public domain\" films, see Section 8.)\n\nB. Direct Federal Support of Preservation Copying\n\n1. AFI-NEA Film Preservation Grants.\n\nThe principal public funding mechanism for film preservation in tax-exempt institutions is the American Film Institute-National Endowment for the Arts (AFI-NEA) Film Preservation Program. This grants program is administered by the National Center for Film and Video Preservation (NCFVP), a unit within the AFI coordinating film acquisition, preservation and cataloging among U.S. archives.94 By terms of an agreement between the AFI and NEA, the NCFVP acts as a \"pass-through\" organization for federal grants and deducts the cost of running the program from the federal allocation.95 Since 1985, the annual federal allocation for the program has been frozen at $500,000. The NCFVP's Washington Office distributes the grants and takes about $144,000 yearly to operate the program and acquire films for placement in American archives.\n\nThe AFI-NEA grants subsidize laboratory costs for copying deteriorating film onto new stock.96 To qualify for support, applicants must demonstrate the cultural value and rarity of the films proposed for copying, give evidence of a sound implementation plan (including laboratory estimates), and match the federal money with local funds on at least a one-to-one basis. Like many federal arts grants, the AFI-NEA awards are decided through a peer review panel.\n\n[Figure 6: AFI-NEA Film Preservation Grant Distribution, 1979-92 (PDF, 161KB)]97\n\nProgram scope and participation. The AFI-NEA program grew from the AFI's effort to collect and copy nitrate films in the late 1960s. Since 1979 about 85% of the funds have gone to the largest nitrate archives: the Museum of Modern Art, the International Museum of Photography and Film at George Eastman House, and the UCLA Film and Television Archive, which, taken together, report approximately 97% of the uncopied nitrate in public hands (not counting the Library of Congress).98\n\nThe AFI-NEA grants now fund copying of decaying acetate as well as nitrate film in a broad range of non-federal institutions. (Major recipients are shown in Figure 6). Between 1979 and 1992, 37 archives, historical societies, libraries, and universities received grants; 99 overall 65% of the yearly applicants are awarded some amount of support. Recipients of smaller awards emphasize that the value of the federal grants goes far beyond the actual dollars.100 The grants help validate the cultural interest of the preservation projects and thus attract matching funds from local donors. From 1979 to 1992, the program awarded over $5.5 million in grants, stimulating at least double that dollar amount in film preservation expenditures. (For yearly totals, see Figure 8.)\n\nWhat types of films are copied with federal grants? The AFI-NEA program provides a preservation safety net for lesser-known American films of cultural and historic value. The overwhelming number of titles copied with grant funds are silent, factual, avant- garde, or dance films--film types less likely to receive asset protection in the industry or to attract preservation donations to public archives. The program has consistently worked to preserve America's oldest motion pictures. Over 50% of the titles copied between 1979 and 1992 were made before 1929, the year that \"talkies\" became common (see Figure 7). Without the AFI-NEA program many American silent films would not survive today.\n\n[Figure 7: What Types of Films Are Preserved with AFI-NEA Grants? (PDF< 72.4KB)101 (Based on grant records for titles copied, 1979-92)]\n\nThe remaining titles are a diverse group. The studio sound features on nitrate were largely funded in the early years of the program, before the industry began its major retrospective preservation efforts. Roughly 2% of the total are nitrate sound features by smaller or now-defunct independent producers. Most of the post-nitrate era films are experimental or dance works. Since 1979 three specialist archives--the National Center for Jewish Film, the New York Public Library Dance Collection and Anthology Film Archives--have received roughly 10% of the total funding, thus assuring a certain threshold of preservation copying in these recipients' subject areas. All told over the last 14 years, the AFI-NEA program has funded copying of over 3,300 films.\n\nThe gray area for AFI-NEA grants is nonfiction film. The AFI-NEA grants are administratively linked with the NEA's Media Arts, a unit mandated to support works of \"artistic excellence\" and the AFI-NEA grants are expected to follow the general principles of the larger program.102 In practical terms, this means that the AFI-NEA program is asked to distinguish between films of \"artistic\" and purely factual interest. Working within these guidelines, it has awarded preservation funds to nonfiction film and actuality footage, some 16% of the total titles copied.103\n\nDeclining funding. Though interest has expanded, the AFI-NEA preservation funding has declined markedly since 1979, in both actual and inflation-adjusted dollars (see Figure 8). Federal support has not kept pace with rising laboratory costs (see Section 6.B.3) or with the growing list of film preservation problems documented in recent scientific research. In 1980 the program distributed $514,215 in federal grants, an amount sufficient to copy the equivalent of 159 black-and-white silent features (not counting the matching funds provided by recipients); in 1992 the $355,600 in awards could support copying for fewer than 26.104 Thus U.S. film archives have been competing for decreasing federal preservation money that buys decreasing amounts of preservation copying. In 1979, the AFI-NEA program funded 82% of the preservation project dollars requested by applicants; in 1993 it funded only 27%.\n\n2. The Library of Congress and the National Archives Programs.\n\nThe federal government also supports preservation copying through the programs of the two major federal film repositories--the Library of Congress (LC) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Each has an in-house laboratory handling most internal film preservation work105 and contracts with commercial labs for color film processing or complex soundtrack restoration.\n\nThe Library of Congress established its own preservation lab in 1971,106 with the funding assistance of the NEA, to manage conversion of its extensive nitrate holdings to safety film. Now located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, the conservation laboratory specializes in black-and-white nitrate film, duplicating over a million feet yearly. It has customized equipment to handle brittle and shrunken filmstock and other problems common to deteriorating nitrate.\n\n[Figure 8: AFI-NEA and LC Funding for Film Preservation Copying, 1979-92] (PDF, 178KB)107\n\nBy the mid-1980s the National Archives and Records Administration had copied all federally held nitrate titles, outside of those in the LC.108 Its laboratory work now involves safety film and videotape. The NARA actively promotes preventive measures to slow film deterioration; it has used polyester-base film and low-fade color stock for copying projects and encourages federal agencies to place government-made films under archival conditions soon after production.\n\nLike the AFI-NEA grants, the LC funds for film preservation copying have markedly declined from their 1980 level. When adjusted for inflation (see Figure 8), the LC 1992 film copying allocation109 was less than half of the 1980 amount, although the size of its film collection has grown by some 100,000 reels. Putting aside the NARA expenditures for film preservation copying, which are difficult to isolate, 110 the total federal funding for film preservation through the AFI-NEA and the Library of Congress was $796,080 in FY 1992.\n\n3. The Role of Commercial Laboratories\n\nWith the exception of LC and NARA, U.S. public and nonprofit archives contract with commercial laboratories for most preservation copying and restoration. Since the early 1970s a handful of commercial firms have sprung up that specialize in this work.111 As experts testified, film preservation differs substantially from routine processing and printing. Most medium and large-sized commercial motion picture labs make their profit from the mass production of new theatrical release prints. Specialist preservation labs instead work on a much smaller scale and concentrate on preprint preparation. Deteriorating film can pose many types of technical problems, and specialist labs adjust their approach to suit the job at hand. Thus, because of the scale and degree of customization, film preservation is more like a craft than a mass production operation. 112 In view of the concerns voiced by archival users--the cost of preservation work, the capacity of preservation laboratories, and lack of facilities for non-standard gauge film--it is worth examining the vital role of these small business operations in national film preservation efforts.\n\nWhile serving both public and industry clients, commercial preservation laboratories receive most of their work from the private sector. All specialist labs responding to this study reported that 40% or less of their business came from public and nonprofit archives. Generally preservation labs employ fewer than 20 technicians. To fully train an employee for film preservation work, one lab estimates, requires two years.\n\nPreservation laboratory work is priced by the labor and time required for the task. The cost for even so seemingly standard a product as a black-and-white duplicate silent-film negative varies with the condition of the deteriorating film and the preparation work required. With more complex reconstructions--sound, color, widescreen formats--costs increase. Costs therefore vary within a range and are difficult to reduce to a single price-per-foot measurement.\n\nThat said, average film preservation copying costs have indeed increased over the last decade. Based on figures supplied by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, the average cost for copying a 90-minute black-and-white silent film has more than doubled over the last 12 years, even after adjusting for inflation (see Figure 9). Preservation of sound film or of two- or three-strip Technicolor is more expensive, due to the greater amount of material examined and copied.113 With the declining level of federal funding, these cost increases are more difficult to absorb for public archives than for industry clients. To put this in terms of the shrinking federal preservation dollars, in 1980 the UCLA AFI-NEA preservation grant of $107,349 would have funded the copying of 33 deteriorating black-and-white silent films; in 1992 its $101,000 grant could only preserve 7.\n\n[Figure 9: Cost of Preserving a Black-and-White Silent Feature (PDF, 126KB) (Based on UCLA figures for a 90-minute 35mm film, copied from a print)]114,115\n\nSpecialist labs argue that their facilities are now operating below peak capacity and could better serve public and nonprofit clients if the flow of preservation copying work were regularized. To justify investment in customized equipment or training additional staff, labs have to be confident of receiving a certain threshold of work over time.116 Publicly funded projects are now a less reliable source of revenue than commercial work. The very nature of the AFI-NEA grant program--its annual cycle and project-by-project approach--discourages multi-year commitment to broad initiatives with large start-up costs.117\n\nC. Support of Preservation-Related Activities\n\nIn addition to funding ongoing film copying programs, federal money supports other preservation-related efforts on a project-by-project basis.\n\nAFI Catalog. The AFI Catalog of Motion Pictures Produced in the United States, an authoritative description and index, has over the years received research grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the NEA. The project has completed volumes on the features of the Teens, the 1920s, 1930s and 1960s, and begun research on the earliest U.S. films (1893-1910) and the features of the 1940s. It hopes to extend coverage eventually to American shorts and newsreels.\n\nThe AFI Catalog has many applications. For scholars of film and American culture, the Catalog is a basic reference book and will probably become even more accessible when issued on CD-Rom, as is currently under discussion. For film archivists, the Catalog defines the baseline for U.S. film production. It gives accurate information for identifying films acquired without titles or credits, and verifies the length, technical processes and versions of features as they were originally released. By recording studio and independent production decade-by-decade, the Catalog provides a statistical population against which film survival rates can be reliably calculated.\n\nNational Moving Image Database. A project less visible to scholars is the National Moving Image Database (NAMID), launched in 1984 as means for sharing information on archival film holdings. NAMID is conceived as a family of databases linking public/nonprofit archives and studio collections through a common communication format; the goal is to facilitate film preservation, scholarly research, and shared cataloging. Between 1984 and 1993, the project received $1,370,000 in NEA support.118\n\nNAMID currently operates as a data-purchase program. NAMID awards selected tax- exempt archives \"conversion funds\" to organize and automate their film catalogs and submit data to the National Center for Film and Video Preservation in Los Angeles.119 The program has been a major vehicle for introducing automated systems to smaller archives. As of April 1993, it had collected data from 21 archives120 and amassed a database of 165,000 records representing some 100,000 feature, short, video and avant- garde titles.121\n\nNAMID, however, has failed to become a regularly consulted preservation tool among U.S. archivists. Little of the database is available for direct, dial-in consultation. Access protocol complexities and the delays in updating holdings information have discouraged use.122 To find out if specific titles have been copied, most archivists still prefer calling colleagues or requesting a search of the AFI-NEA grants database, an in-house tool developed for tracking the distribution of grants and AFI Collection materials.123\n\nNational Film Registry. The National Film Registry was created by Congress in 1988 to single out American films of particular cultural, historical, or aesthetic significance. Films listed in the Registry are collected and preserved by the Library of Congress in their original release version. Each year nominations to the Film Registry are solicited from the public, and 25 selections are added by the Librarian of Congress, in consultation with the National Film Preservation Board (NFPB), an eighteen-member advisory group of film industry, academic and archival representatives. The National Film Registry now numbers 100 titles. While some respondents fault the Registry for overrepresenting studio-produced Hollywood features,124 the Registry has moved toward greater coverage of independent and documentary film.\n\nThe renewal of the National Film Preservation Act in 1992 reauthorized the activities of the NFPB for four more years and expanded the role of the Librarian of Congress and the National Film Preservation Board in preservation planning.125 The 1992 law mandated this study and a national film preservation program, both to be submitted to the appropriate Congressional committees. Congress authorizes $250,000 yearly for the National Film Preservation Board activities. In 1992 the funds supported the cost of National Film Preservation Board meetings, the two hearings, preparation of this study, and acquisition and preservation of several independent films listed on the National Registry.\n\nOther federal support. Other grantmaking agencies play a lesser role in film preservation. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission (NHPRC), a statutory body affiliated with the National Archives and Records Administration, funds efforts to organize, describe and preserve collections of paper and non-textual records of documentary importance for American history. To date, among tax-exempt moving image archives, NHPRC has funded largely television newsfilm projects, although it has been open to proposals involving other types of unpublished documentary footage.126 Motion picture collections within large research libraries are eligible for support through the \"strengthening Research Library Resources Program\" (Higher Education Act, Title II-C). Administered by the Department of Education, Office of Educational Research and Improvement, this effort funds the cataloging and preservation of publicly accessible collections; relatively few film-related applications are received.127\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), a long-time supporter of the AFI Catalog, has no program specifically designed for film archives. While traditionally deferring to the NEA in funding the physical preservation of motion pictures, the NEH Division of Preservation and Access has, as of June 1993, a pending grant for a newsreel preservation project, its first for motion picture preservation in nearly a decade.\n\nSummary. To sum up, federal funds, through the in-house programs of the Library of Congress and the National Archives and more recently the AFI-NEA grants, have sustained film preservation copying for several decades, although support has decreased by half in the last fourteen years. The NEA, NHPRC and Department of Education also fund, on a more occasional basis, projects to collect and organize motion pictures and film information in institutions that meet application criteria. What is missing from this national framework is funding for improving film storage conditions128 and for the preservation copying of documentaries and newsreels produced and circulated outside of the federal government.\n\n7. Foundations Funding Film Preservation\n\nAs the level of AFI-NEA grants has declined and laboratory costs increased, corporate and private foundations have helped bridge the gap in funding preservation in public and nonprofit archives.129 Film projects are usually supported through foundations' general cultural or community outreach programs. A small number of foundations, however, have made film preservation a primary concern.\n\nProbably the foundation most actively supporting American film preservation has been the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. Between 1981 and 1992, the Packard Foundation distributed over $2 million for film copying, exhibition, and research to the National Center for Film and Video Preservation, the Library of Congress, the Pacific Film Archive, and the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The Packard Foundation has been a major funder of the AFI Catalog and the nitrate conversion of newsreels and feature films of the 1930s. It is particularly concerned with the quality of film access and has supported the striking of new 35mm prints so that the public can experience films as they were originally intended to be seen.130\n\nThe John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's principal film interests are independent filmmaking and public affairs documentaries. The MacArthur grants to media centers, $7 million from 1987-1991, support a variety of local access, exhibition and preservation activities as well as production facilities for independent filmmakers and videomakers. The foundation has also funded public screening programs; in 1991, for example, UCLA received a MacArthur grant to make prints of films by Mexican directors for exhibition in the U.S. and Mexico.131\n\nSeveral foundations developed from the estates of filmmakers are involved in film preservation. The Louis B. Mayer Foundation is funding a demonstration project to create new Technicolor prints from original three-strip Technicolor negatives at the Beijing Film and Video facilities.132 Both the Andy Warhol and the Mary Pickford Foundations have underwritten preservation efforts in their respective areas of interest-- the avant-garde and the Hollywood film.\n\nThe Film Foundation, begun in 1990 by Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, and Steven Spielberg, presents a very different profile. The Film Foundation is, in a sense, a grassroots organization started by successful filmmakers to increase preservation awareness within the industry and cooperation with public archives. Scorsese has lobbied studios to protect older films in their libraries and persistently pushed to improve the quality of preservation laboratory work.\n\nThe Film Foundation has gone directly to the public to convey the urgency of current preservation problems. This March it cosponsored with the American Movie Classics (AMC) cable network a three-day festival of film preservation. The AMC festival broadcast features, shorts, and nonfiction films restored by the public archives as well as short documentaries and celebrity interviews on film preservation, and solicited preservation donations from the audience by means of an 800-number.133\n\n8. Public Access\n\nIncreasingly, preservation is understood to be incomplete without access to the preserved film.134 Laudable as a principle, it raises many questions.\n\n\"Access\"--as it is used in the hearings, submissions, and elsewhere--is a catch-all term for a wide variety of film uses, including study, public exhibition, distribution, and footage licensing. Some of these uses are broadly educational, others clearly commercial. A correspondingly wide array of public constituencies seek access to preserved films, including scholars, classroom viewers, telejournalists, filmmakers, cable operators, video distributors, filmgoers and video renters. Access means different things to each of these groups. Access to film also requires either on-site viewing or a method of off-site delivery, and formats for both are also varied, chiefly 35mm prints, 16mm prints, videotape, videodisc, and electronic transmission.\n\nAmong the institutions and businesses that hold film, the policies regarding access are as multiple as the possible combinations of uses, users, and formats suggest. For the major studios and other rights holders, access is a key commercial decision. The Walt Disney Studio's longstanding policy of regular seven-year theatrical re-releases of its animated features is only the best known example of the way that cycles of access and access-denial can prolong a title's commercial life. A number of filmmakers, including Alfred Hitchcock, John Wayne, and John Cassavetes (and their estates), turned the withholding of access into a tool for creating scarcity and audience anticipation that probably adds to commercial value. No doubt the public's right to view a privately owned cultural heritage needs to be factored in here, but the commercial principle is fairly clear.\n\nAccess and the public archives. Where the question of access is currently most contentious is in regard to films held by public archives. For many of those seeking copies of films, archivists can look as if they are perversely saving films for a posterity that never quite arrives.135 The frustration is understandable, but it needs also to be noted that archivists are working under certain constraints, both legal and practical.\n\nAccess to a great many films held in public archives is restricted legally in two ways: through copyright and through contracts. As mentioned at the opening of Section 6, U.S. copyright law distinguishes between \"ownership\" and the \"material object\" in which that ownership is embodied. For film titles under copyright protection, public archives typically hold only the material objects--the film copies--which \"fair use\" exceptions allow archives to make available for on-site educational study and to duplicate for preservation purposes.136 Other rights to reproduce, distribute, and publicly exhibit the film are generally retained by the copyright owner.\n\nFilms without copyright protection, and thus available for use without licensing, are usually labeled \"public domain,\" a sometimes confusing term because of its application to several groups of films. The term deserves a brief digression because of its frequent use in the submissions and testimony.\n\nPublic domain. Titles most clearly in the public domain are those created and distributed over 75 years ago--the greatest length for which copyright is generally allowed. By the end of 1993, therefore, films distributed before 1919 will have fallen into public domain. (There are, however, exceptions even to this rule, notably for so-called \"unpublished\" films.)137 Other more recent films are also labeled \"public domain,\" and for them the determination of copyright status can become extremely complicated. Under the 1909 Copyright Act, registered works could enjoy two terms of protection, a 28-year first term and, if renewed at the end of that term, a second 28-year term. In the 1960s Congress made various extensions for works already in their renewal term, eventually adding 19 years, thus bringing the total potential protection to 75 years. However, if an owner neglected to submit a renewal at the end of that first term, the film fell into public domain. Current law has simplified this procedure so that, in effect, films registered after 1963 have a single 75-year term.138\n\nWhat further muddies public domain is the copyright status of \"underlying works,\" such as a film's literary source or music. Even if the film itself lacks copyright protection, these underlying works may have owners different from the film's owner and who may possess some control over it. The current legal battle over two videotape versions of John Wayne's 1963 film McLintock! suggests the complexity of public domain issues. Although copyright for the film itself lapsed, several copyrights involving the music score were renewed and the dispute centers over those rights.139 Even the most famous example of a film long presumed to be in the public domain, Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946) whose copyright expired in 1974, is now claimed to be controlled by rights holders of the original short story and soundtrack music.140 Public archives have been reluctant to insert themselves into these legal disputes by releasing films less than 75 years old, especially as archives would be liable for copyright infringement should they exceed the narrow fair use exceptions.141\n\nIn addition, the use of films at public archives is often governed by legally binding instruments of gift or deposit. In certain rare cases, these contracts give the archives the copyright ownership as well as the physical material (as with the Hearst Metrotone News collection at the UCLA Film and Television Archive). More often, the contracts restrict the use of both the donated or deposited material and of the "
