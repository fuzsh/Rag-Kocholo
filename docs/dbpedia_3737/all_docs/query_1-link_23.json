Once again, Dixie changes Henry's mind by telling him that if Clayton is re-elected, he will neglect his civic duties and possibly cause her death in a fire. Thus inspired, Henry declares his candidacy and brings a circus to town to kick off his campaign. While Henry is impressing his potential voters by wrestling a circus bear, his doting mother Ma is kidnapped by Clayton's men. Henry then is notified through an anonymous telephone call that if he wants to see his mother alive, he must pull out of the race. To save Ma, Henry prepares to meet the kidnappers' demands and, after a reformed Dixie reveals Morgan's scheme to him, telephones the newspaper to report his withdrawal. The reporters, however, are suspicious of Henry's call and fail to print the story in their next edition. Before Clayton and his men make good on their threats, Henry decides to act crazy in order to turn the voters against him and, wearing a lampshade on his head, runs screaming through the streets. During Henry's run, Clayton is arrested for the kidnapping, and Ma is saved. Henry then appears in a radio studio summing up the \"third act\" of his fire chief \"opera.\" After revealing that Ma, Dixie and he lived happily ever after, Henry says goodbye to his appreciative radio listeners.\n\nLess"
