In celebration, Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. (Red Robin) is offering guests a new burger of mythical proportions! Available now through Sept. 1, The Colossus Burger is a fire-grilled beef patty piled high with an unbeatable combination of finely chopped smoked brisket, provolone cheese, grilled onions, and Red Robin's Campfire and Triple S BBQ sauces served on a sesame seed bun.\n\nRed Robin's latest Burgers & A Movie™ promotion provides guests with exciting offers.

Unimaginable villains will test the mythical power of Hercules in director Brett Ratner's gritty take on one of the most epic action heroes of the ages. The film also stars Ian McShane, Rufus Sewell, Joseph Fiennes, Peter Mullan, Aksel Hennie, Ingrid Berdal, Reece Ritchie, Tobias Santelmann, Rebecca Ferguson, Isaac Andrews and John Hurt.\n\n\"Hercules\" is produced by Beau Flynn, Barry Levine and Brett Ratner.

Directed by Brett Ratner.\n\nAny guest who sees \"Hercules\" during opening weekend** and brings their ticket stub into participating restaurants from Monday, July 28 through Thursday, July 31, will receive $3 off their visit.\n\nThe Gourmet Burger Authority™ is also offering two new beverages to pair with The Colossus Burger and \"Hercules\" sweepstakes. Following the success of last summer's Can-Crafted Cocktails™, a unique combination of beer and liquor served in a first-to-market, reusable beer can for 21-and-over guests, Red Robin is debuting two new flavors, including:\n\nWildbeer –y Can-Crafted™ Cocktail – a berry-licious mix of Tito's Handmade Vodka®, Redd's® Strawberry Ale, Red Robin's strawberry-raspberry purée and Minute Maid® Lemonade; the Wildbeer-y is available in a collector's edition baseball and American flag-themed can\n\nBeer 'Rita Can-Crafted™ Cocktail – a refreshing combination of Sauza® Blue Silver 100% Agave Tequila, triple sec and Red Robin's house-made sweet & sour mix topped with a cold Coronita®\n\n\"Our new Wildbeer-y Can-Crafted Cocktail is served in a souvenir beer can featuring Red Robin's signature baseball American flag and is definitely a fun treat for our guests this season,\" said Donna Ruch, Red Robin's master mixologist. \"In true Red Robin style, we are continuing our focus on remixing American classics to bring innovative beverages to our adult guests that they can't find anywhere else.\"\n\nRed Robin continues to embrace its heritage of innovative mixology and is offering two additional adult beverages, including:\n\nGreen Twist Tea – a twist on a Long Island Iced Tea featuring Beefeater® gin, SVEDKA® Clementine vodka, BACARDI® Superior rum, triple sec and Red Robin's fresh, house-made sweet & sour with green tea and club soda\n\nOrange Blitz – an adults-only take on an orange and cream treat made with Pinnacle® Whipped® Vodka, orange juice, Sprite®, a burst of candied orange flavor, topped with whipped cream and a fresh orange wedge\n\nFor more information on the promotional partnership, sweepstakes, and summer menu items, or to find the restaurant location nearest you, visit www.redrobin.com.\n\nAbout Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.
