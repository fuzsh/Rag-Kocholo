        "text": "LeRoy left Warner Brothers for the greener pastures of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he was offered an unusual deal that allowed him to function as either a producer or a director. He began by producing the films of other directors: Robert Sinclair’s Dramatic School (1938), W.S. Van Dyke’s Stand Up and Fight (1939), Eddie Buzzell’s At the Circus (1939), and, most enduringly, Victor Fleming’s The Wizard of Oz (1939). Finally, in 1940, LeRoy stepped behind the camera again. His first picture was Waterloo Bridge, adapted from the Robert E. Sherwood play about a London dancer (Vivien Leigh) and a soldier (Robert Taylor) who fall in love during an air raid.\n\nEscape (1940) starred Taylor again, as an American trying to get his mother out of a concentration camp with the help of a Nazi officer’s mistress (Norma Shearer), and Blossoms in the Dust (1941) offered Greer Garson in one of her most sentimental roles, as the founder of an orphanage. Unholy Partners (1941) was an offbeat period crime yarn about a newspaper baron (Robinson) who must make a deal with a gang lord (Edward Arnold) to get his paper published. The crime opus Johnny Eager (1941) was driven by the star chemistry between Taylor and Turner.\n\nRandom Harvest (1942), based on James Hilton’s novel, was a big box-office success. A soldier (Ronald Colman) is left with amnesia and shell shock after World War I, but his frustration melts away under the tender ministrations of a dancer (Garson), whom he falls in love with and marries. They have a child; then a collision restores his memory of his former life but wipes out that of his years of marriage, though she does not forget him. LeRoy earned his only Oscar nomination for best direction, and the film was also nominated for best picture. Madame Curie (1943) was a popular biopic about physicists Marie (Garson) and Pierre Curie (Walter Pidgeon) and was a best picture nominee.\n\nLeRoy had been on a successful streak, and his next film was the World War II epic Thirty Seconds over Tokyo (1944), based on participant Ted Lawson’s book about the first U.S. bombing raid on Japan in 1942, which was led by Lieut. Col. James Doolittle. Van Johnson starred as Lawson, and Robert Walker, Robert Mitchum, and Spencer Tracy (as Doolittle) were among the other fliers. Another exercise in patriotism was a documentary short about religious tolerance, The House I Live In (1945), written by Albert Maltz (later of the Hollywood Ten), with Frank Sinatra delivering the message. LeRoy, Maltz, Sinatra, and three others won a special Oscar for the film; it was the only Oscar LeRoy would ever receive. Without Reservations (1946) was a pleasant romantic comedy with the offbeat pairing of John Wayne and Claudette Colbert. Homecoming (1948) was about the romance between a World War II battlefield surgeon (Clark Gable) and a nurse (Turner). LeRoy remade Little Women (1949) with Janet Leigh, Elizabeth Taylor, June Allyson, and Margaret O’Brien as the March sisters.\n\nLeRoy had not had a hit since Thirty Seconds over Tokyo, and make-work pictures such as Any Number Can Play (1949), which featured Gable as a gambler with marital problems, did nothing to reestablish him. East Side, West Side (1949) had the benefit of a great cast—Ava Gardner, James Mason, Barbara Stanwyck, and Van Heflin—but was not a success. Quo Vadis (1951), MGM’s $7 million epic about the persecution of Christians under the Roman emperor Nero, had actually been initiated in 1949 with John Huston directing, but LeRoy took over the production, which was filmed on location in Rome over six grueling months. The film was Oscar nominated for best picture and received seven other Oscar nominations, including one for Peter Ustinov’s outrageous interpretation of Nero. Quo Vadis was MGM’s second highest grossing picture ever, behind Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nFrom that height, LeRoy returned to more-routine projects. Lovely to Look At (1952), with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel, was a handsome if unnecessary remake of Roberta (1935), and Million Dollar Mermaid (1952), starring Esther Williams and Victor Mature, was a biopic about Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman (Williams), who became a Hollywood star in the silent era; Berkeley handled the musical numbers. Latin Lovers (1953), was a semimusical with Turner and Ricardo Montalbán, and Rose Marie (1954) was another inferior remake of a 1930s classic.\n\nReturn to Warner Brothers: Mister Roberts, The Bad Seed, and Gypsy\n\nRose Marie completed LeRoy’s tenure at MGM. He returned to Warner Brothers, where he both produced and directed. Strange Lady in Town (1955) was a minor western starring Garson as a frontier doctor, but then LeRoy was asked to take over the service comedy Mister Roberts (1955) from John Ford, who was ill and had disagreed violently during shooting with Henry Fonda, the star of the original Broadway success. Nevertheless, the film was a major box-office hit and was Oscar nominated as best picture. For the rest of his career, LeRoy made a specialty of adapting Broadway hits.\n\nThe Bad Seed (1956) had also been a hit on Broadway. LeRoy’s popular but slavishly faithful version of Maxwell Anderson’s play about a sweet little girl who is actually a murderer imported most of the original cast, of whom Nancy Kelly, Eileen Heckart, and child actress Patty McCormack all earned Oscar nominations. Toward the Unknown (1956) was a story about air force pilots, with William Holden and James Garner in his film debut. The hit service comedy No Time for Sergeants (1958) captured the spirit of Ira Levin’s Broadway show and laid the groundwork for Andy Griffith’s television career. Home Before Dark (1958) was a drama about a woman’s (Jean Simmons’s) efforts to readjust to a normal life after spending a year in a mental institution. The FBI Story (1959) was a capsule dramatization of the agency’s most famous cases; it starred James Stewart as an FBI agent and Vera Miles as his long-suffering wife.\n\nThe comedy Wake Me When It’s Over (1960) featured Dick Shawn and Ernie Kovacs as army pals who, out of boredom, build a resort on the Japanese island where they are stationed. The Devil at 4 o’Clock (1961) starred Tracy and Sinatra in a drama about the evacuation of a children’s hospital after a volcano erupts, and A Majority of One (1962) was a lengthy adaptation of the Broadway success, with the unusual casting of Rosalind Russell as a Jewish divorcée and Alec Guinness as a Japanese diplomat. Russell was better served in Gypsy (1962) as Rose Hovick, the frightening stage mother of Gypsy Rose Lee (Natalie Wood) and Baby June (Morgan Britanny).\n\nThe marital farce Mary, Mary (1963) was another adaptation of a Broadway success. LeRoy’s last credit was Moment to Moment (1965), a romantic thriller starring Jean Seberg and Honor Blackman. LeRoy also assisted Wayne on the Vietnam War film The Green Berets (1968) before retiring. His autobiography, Take One, was published in 1974, and he received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1976.\n\nMichael Barson"
