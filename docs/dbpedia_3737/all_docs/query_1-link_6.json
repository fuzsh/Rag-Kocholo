        "text": "Duration: 1h 34m Director: William Nigh\n\n35MM\n\nMGM’s 1926 blockbuster production stars Charles Ray as the youngest in a long line of fearless Irish American firefighters. Things get complicated when he falls in love with the daughter (May McEvoy) of a crooked building contractor. Spectacular fire sequences with hand-colored effects included in this recent Library of Congress restoration.\n\nThis film is showing as part of our Silents, Please! series, the Somerville Theatre’s series of vintage silent classics shown on the big screen with live music. All films in the series will be shown using 35mm prints, with most on loan from the U.S. Library of Congress.\n\nSupplying music will be silent film accompanist Jeff Rapsis, who specializes in creating live scores for silent film screenings at venues around New England and beyond.\n\nIn the tradition of theatre organists of the 1920s, Rapsis improvises each film’s score on the spot, making up the music as the movie is screened.\n\nThe Fire Brigade Tickets"
