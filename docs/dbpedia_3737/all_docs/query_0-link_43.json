Specifically, Leonard Maltin credits Oelze with the fire engine in the Cabin Fever video release.\n\ntitles - Louis McManus probably designed the main titles.\n\nthe kids:\n\nWally Albright as \"Wally\"\n\nLead role. He's the leader of the gang and has the idea to build the fire engine.\n\nGeorge \"Spanky\" McFarland as \"Spanky\"\n\nFeatured role. He's present throughout the film, providing most of the humor.\n\nMatthew \"Stymie\" Beard as \"Stymie\"\n\nSupporting role. He has quite of lot of the dialogue, and serves as the brakeman on the fire engine.\n\nJerry Tucker as \"Jerry\"\n\nSupporting role. He's the snobby rich kid with the shiny new fire engine.\n\nJackie Lynn Taylor as \"Jane\"\n\nSupporting role. The cutting continuity refers to her as \"Jacquie.\" Maltin & Bann listed her as Jacqueline Taylor. She decides to ride in Jerry's vehicle.\n\nScotty Beckett\n\nSupporting role. His name doesn't turn up in the dialogue, but the cutting continuity refers to him as \"Scot.\" He's present through most of the proceedings, but isn't given too much specific attention, other then during the construction sequence, in which he's paired with Spanky. This was his debut appearance.\n\nTommy Bupp\n\nSupporting role. He's introduced in a treehouse, and later brings some lumber, but otherwise is an ensemble player.\n\nTommy Bond\n\nSupporting role. He brings the wheels, but otherwise isn't given much of anything specific to do.\n\nMarvin Strin as \"Bubbles\"\n\nSupporting role. Listed by Maltin & Bann as Marvin Trin. The cutting continuity refers to him as \"Marvin.\" He's present through most of the film, but is given very little of anything specific to do, other than knock down a clothesline.\n\nDonald Proffitt\n\nSupporting role. His name doesn't turn up in the dialogue, but the cutting continuity refers to him as \"Donald.\" He's seen on a sawhorse, and later steals a hose, but is otherwise an ensemble player.\n\nCharles Donnelly\n\nSupporting role. Judging by his presence throughout the making of this film, which otherwise is only the case with the boys who ride the makeshift fire engine, it seems that he's one of them, and must be the boy seen earlier carrying the ladder with Stymie and Spanky.\n\nBobbie \"Cotton\" Beard\n\nSmall part. The nickname wasn't used in this film. He's seen only during the opening sequence with Stymie.\n\nJean Aulbach\n\nBit part. Her name doesn't turn up in the dialogue, but the cutting continuity refers to her as \"Jean.\" She's the girl on Donald's sawhorse.\n\nJane Withers as \"Jane\"\n\nShe was present for the first three days of shooting, but was replaced by Jackie Lynn Taylor, who retained the character name. Withers never made it into the finished film. Maltin & Bann state that she was paid for two weeks' work, but this doesn't jibe with the payroll ledger.\n\nTony Kales\n\nHe worked for one day on this film. This seems to rule out his presence on the makeshift fire engine, since those boys worked throughout the production. Presumably, his footage wound up on the cutting room floor.\n\nthe animals:\n\nPete the Pup IV as \"Pete\"\n\nSupporting role. He's present throughout most of the film, and is given a few comic bits of business.\n\nLeo\n\nBit part. The MGM lion appears at the opening of the film.\n\nJoe the Monk\n\nBit part. This is presumably Joe. He's up in the tree with Tommy Bupp.\n\nother animals\n\nBit parts and extras.\n\n(1.) Scotty's two white rabbits, one of whom is named \"Pansy.\"\n\n(2.) The animal in the pen as Donald walks by with the hose.\n\nthe adults:\n\nStanley \"Tiny\" Sandford as one of the moving men\n\nSmall part. He asks for directions to Cherry Street, and seems to be the one in charge between the two movers. The cutting continuity refers to him as \"Tiny.\"\n\nRoscoe \"Tiny\" Ward as \"Jack,\" one of the moving men\n\nSmall part. I haven't familiarized myself with this actor yet. He drives the moving van and is the taller of the two movers. Listed by Maltin & Bann as Jack \"Tiny\" Ward.\n\nCharlie Hall as the window washer\n\nBit part. He finds himself missing a ladder.\n\nHarry Bernard as the man watering his lawn\n\nBit part. He appears to be a bit drunk as he realizes his hose is incomplete.\n\nother adults\n\nBit parts and extras. There are seven pedestrians (five men and two women) knocked into the air by the runaway fire engine. Maltin & Bann list Ernie Alexander among them, but I can't tell which one he is. There is also a billposter in this scene. Otherwise there are occasional pedestrians shown in the backgrounds of other shots.\n\nthe music:\n\n\"Good Old Days\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Jan. 10, 1931.\n\n(A14.) This is played over the opening titles and as Wally and Spanky first see the fire engine. A small portion is repeated during the end title.\n\n\"Look At Him Now\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted 1931. This is played as each kid joins the gang on their way to the new kid's house.\n\n\"All Together\" by Leroy Shield\n\nAlso known as \"Tune.\" This is played as the kids follow the moving truck and say hi to Jerry. It's played again as Spanky begins to help Stymie.\n\n\"The Moon And You\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Jan. 10, 1931. This is played, minus the introduction, as the moving men take the fire engine off the truck.\n\n\"Riding Along\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Dec. 23, 1930. This is played as Jerry gets the other boys away from his fire engine. This is the faster version.\n\n\"Little Dancing Girl\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Jan. 10, 1931. Also known as \"Dancing Girl\" and \"Dancing Girls.\" This is played, with a rare introduction, as Jane takes a ride with Jerry, and the boys decide to build their own fire engine. It's played again as the boys show their fire engine to Jerry and Jane.\n\n\"Yearning\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Aug. 13, 1931. A short part of this piece is played as we see various things with missing wheels.\n\n\"Hide And Go Seek\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Dec. 23, 1930. This is played, with three introductions, during the scavanger hunt.\n\n\"Bells\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Jan. 10, 1931. This is played as Spanky passes Stymie a wheel.\n\n\"Candy Candy\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Dec. 23, 1930. This is played twice as Spanky and Scotty keep having to get out of the way of the older boys, and Jerry loses his pants.\n\n\"Teeter-Totter\" by Leroy Shield\n\nA short portion of this piece is played as the boys look at the finished fire engine.\n\nthe locations:\n\nFargo Hill\n\nShown in the longshot looking downhill. Located on Fargo Street between Allesandro Street and North Alvarado Street in Los Angeles. Visible at the bottom of the hill is St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Church.\n\n3510 Glendon Ave., Los Angeles\n\nThis is the location of Jerry's house, near the intersection with Palms Boulevard. The Porter Sanitarium can be seen on the hill in the background.\n\nSouth Robertson Boulevard\n\nThis seems to be the stretch of road shown as Stymie, Spanky, and Tony Kales carry the ladder.\n\nCherry Street\n\nAccording to Jackie Taylor's book, this was where the bulk of the downhill race sequence was shot. It's also the street the moving men are looking for at the beginning of the film.\n\nmiscellaneous:\n\nAt least 9 shooting dates went into the making of this film. Almost five months had passed since shooting finished for \"Wild Poses\" (no. 125). Shooting for \"Hi'-Neighbor!\" started on Jan. 20th and continued until Jan. 30th. No shooting took place on Jan. 21st or 28th, both of which were Sundays. There was also a day player given a check charged to this film on Jan. 17th, though it's difficult to imagine which scene could have possibly been filmed. After this, about three weeks would pass before the Our Gang unit began filming \"For Pete's Sake!\" (no. 127).\n\nA press item of January 8, 1934, reveals that a party was planned to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Roach studio. Several past and present Our Gang kids were scheduled to attend, including Spanky, Tommy Bond, Dorothy \"Echo\" DeBorba, Stymie, Sunshine Sammy, Joe \"Fatty\" Cobb, Johnny Downs, Jackie Condon, Skooter Lowry, Mary Ann Jackson, Farina, Wheezer, and Jean Darling.\n\nOn January 31st, Robbin Coons wrote the following: \"Only 'Spanky' McFarland, the chubby 'hero,' and 'Stymie' Beard, the little Negro menace, will be retained in a studio shake-up of 'Our Gang,' to get new faces. The others will be released to go into obscurity or to try for further success in films emulating the example of Jackie Cooper.\" This item seems rather belated, as the new batch of kids had just been added, and the \"shake-up\" happened months earlier.\n\nReissue and television prints are titled without punctuation: \"Hi Neighbor.\"\n\nReel two starts with Spanky helping Stymie with the wheels.\n\nA story version of this film appeared in the book Our Gang in 1934.\n\nThe script submitted to MGM was given the catalog number B451."
