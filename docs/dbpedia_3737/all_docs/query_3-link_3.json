        "text": "Did you know that the International Building Code requires high-rise buildings be provided with a Fire Command Center (FCC)? A fire command center is a room dedicated as the Fire Department response point, and serves as the center for their emergency operations. The FCC consolidates life safety system components and information to allow responders to efficiently evaluate and manage an emergency in the building.\n\nThough the requirements for the FCC reside in the Fire Protection section of the Building Code (Section 911.1), there are numerous requirements which impact other disciplines and can be inadvertently missed. Some of these include:\n\nMinimum 200 sq. ft. size, with minimum 10 foot width, constructed with 1-hr separation from the rest of the building\n\nFCC design review by AHJ prior to installation:\n\nLocation and accessibility of room\n\nLayout of room and equipment\n\nElevator annunciator panel and selector switches\n\nStatus indicators and controls for air distribution systems\n\nControls for unlocking interior exit stairway doors\n\nDedicated telephone for fire department use\n\nSchematic building plans\n\nBuilding Information Card\n\nGenerator and ATS annunciators\n\nAny unique local Fire and Building Department requirements\n\nParties having involvement in the FCC design and installation can include:\n\nArchitect\n\nEngineer\n\nVertical transportation (elevator) consultant\n\nElectrical and fire alarm contractor\n\nMechanical contractor\n\nLow voltage and Security designer and contractors\n\nBuilding owner and operator\n\nCoordination early in a project can help avoid painful changes, costs, and delays when FCC deficiencies are found at the time of final inspections. To view the complete list of FCC requirements, refer to IBC section 911.1."
