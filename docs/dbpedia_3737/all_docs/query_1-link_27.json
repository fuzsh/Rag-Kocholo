He's a constant nuisance to the bigger kids, and consequently provides most of the gags.\n\nMatthew \"Stymie\" Beard as \"Stymie\"\n\nFeatured role. He's the 'hoseman cheef.'

He's one of the two firemen talking to Sandstrom, but doesn't actually do the talking. Listed by Maltin & Bann as Gene Morgan.\n\nDon Sandstrom as the man guilty of a fire hazard\n\nBit part.

It's repeated one and a half times as Spanky drinks the bottle of medicine and the end title appears.\n\n\"Little Dancing Girl\" by Leroy Shield\n\nCopyrighted Jan. 10, 1931. Also known as \"Dancing Girl\" and \"Dancing Girls.\" Most of this piece is played as the kids talk about being 'volumeteers.' It's played in full as Dickie and Stymie struggle to get Spanky to put on his pants. This is the version reproduced on the first Beau Hunks CD.\n\n\"Me-Ow\" by Mel B. Kaufman\n\nPublished in 1918 with lyrics by Harry D. Kerr. Most of this piece is played as Pete chases the cat.

It could possibly be more than one piece.\n\npiece 116f\n\nThis is played briefly as the two firemen arrive at the scene.\n\nthe locations:\n\nLos Angeles City Engine Co. 43, Palms district, Los Angeles\n\nLocated at 10416 Featherstone (now part of National Boulevard). The sign over the door reads 'Engine 43.' This is where the fire engine is leaving the station. In his book on movie locations, Leon Smith states that this address is at 10420, but if so, then the number has changed over the years. The film clearly shows it as 10416.\n\nMotor Avenue, Palms district, Los Angeles\n\nAt least part of the gang's journey takes them down this street between Woodbine and Featherstone Streets. Visible are the People's Water Company at 3392 Motor Avenue, Moycey Barber Shop at 3388 Motor, the grocery store at 3384 Motor, Master Ornamental Iron and Electric Welding Shop at 3316 Motor, and the Palms Garage at 3304 Motor. There's a Texaco station beyond the garage. Buddy is seen riding past the Home Made Bakery at 3466 Motor. Stymie rides south past the Shoe Repairing shop run by J. A. Pryor at 3411 Motor. This business had been relocated in recent years from across the street.\n\nmiscellaneous:\n\n11 shooting dates went into the making of this film. Nine weeks had passed since shooting finished for \"The Pooch\" (no. 115). The studio was closed for five of those weeks. The 'start' date for \"Hook And Ladder\" arrived on May 18th, and shooting continued until the 'finish' date of May 28th. Included in the shooting schedule was a rare working Sunday on May 22nd. After this, seven weeks passed before the Our Gang unit began filming \"Free Wheeling\" (no. 117). The studio was closed during one of those weeks.\n\nThe Portland Evening Express (ME) of May 25, 1932, reported the following: \"After five weeks' holiday, little three-year-old Spanky, child wonder of Hal Roach's group of Our Gang youngsters, returned to Hollywood to be greeted by Dickie Moore, who recently signed a contract as a member of the famous gang. Master Moore congratulated Spanky on his screen achievements in Our Gang and expressed his pleasure on becoming one of them.\"\n\nThe newspaper article that opens the film mentions \"Fire Chief Robert Scott.\"\n\nQuoted in the Apr. 21, 1975, Independent-Gazette of Berkeley, CA, Dorothy DeBorba had this to say: \"Another time I had to hitch up a billygoat to a little fire cart and he butted me in the breadbasket.\"\n\nReel one ends as Dickie requests Stymie's help in getting Spanky's pants on.\n\nA story version of this film, entitled \"The Fire Brigade,\" appeared in the book Our Gang Annual in 1933.\n\nThe script submitted to MGM was given the catalog number B455."
