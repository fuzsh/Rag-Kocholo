        "text": "A storybook ending it is not. But the $1.3 billion sale of the legendary Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by an ailing French state bank to a group led by one of America's most eccentric billionaire investors is certainly a twist worthy of Tinsel Town.\n\nThe latest buyer of MGM — the Hollywood studio that gave the world \"Gone with the Wind,\" \"Some Like It Hot\" and \"Rocky\" and was once the home to stars such as Clark Gable, Judy Garland and Greta Garbo — is a consortium led by Kirk Kerkorian, the Armenian-American casino king and corporate raider.\n\nThe deal, meanwhile, leaves a French government company, which last year took over MGM from the Crédit Lyonnais banking group, with roughly $1 billion dollars of losses. The price being paid is also said to be less than had been hoped for by Lazard Frères of New York, advisers to the French sellers of MGM.\n\nMr. Kerkorian, 79, who was most recently in the news when he and the former Chrysler boss Lee Iacocca failed last year in a bid to take control of Chrysler, is actually buying MGM for the third time.\n\nHe first invested in MGM in 1969 and later sold and rebought pieces of the studio, including a 1986 sale to Ted Turner, the founder of CNN; a partial repurchase, and the ill-starred 1991 sale of MGM to Giancarlo Parretti, a controversial Italian financier with a police record that includes check-bouncing and fraud.\n\nMr. Parretti, who has faced various investigations by U.S. law enforcement authorities, was partly backed in his 1991 purchase by the late Steve Ross, the Time Warner chief who put up some of his group's money in exchange for a distribution deal. But Mr. Ross then found himself denying claims from the Italian that he was one of Mr. Parretti's close friends.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
