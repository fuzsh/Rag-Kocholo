        "text": "The following overview should help you better understand how to cite sources using MLA 9th edition, including how to format the Works Cited page and in-text citations.\n\nPlease use the example at the bottom of this page to cite the Purdue OWL in MLA. See also our MLA vidcast series on the Purdue OWL YouTube Channel.\n\nCreating a Works Cited list using the ninth edition\n\nMLA is a style of documentation that may be applied to many different types of writing. Since texts have become increasingly digital, and the same document may often be found in several different sources, following a set of rigid rules no longer suffices.\n\nThus, the current system is based on a few guiding principles, rather than an extensive list of specific rules. While the handbook still describes how to cite sources, it is organized according to the process of documentation, rather than by the sources themselves. This gives writers a flexible method that is near-universally applicable.\n\nOnce you are familiar with the method, you can use it to document any type of source, for any type of paper, in any field.\n\nHere is an overview of the process:\n\nWhen deciding how to cite your source, start by consulting the list of core elements. These are the general pieces of information that MLA suggests including in each Works Cited entry. In your citation, the elements should be listed in the following order:\n\nAuthor.\n\nTitle of source.\n\nTitle of container,\n\nOther contributors,\n\nVersion,\n\nNumber,\n\nPublisher,\n\nPublication date,\n\nLocation.\n\nEach element should be followed by the corresponding punctuation mark shown above. Earlier editions of the handbook included the place of publication and required different punctuation (such as journal editions in parentheses and colons after issue numbers) depending on the type of source. In the current version, punctuation is simpler (only commas and periods separate the elements), and information about the source is kept to the basics.\n\nAuthor\n\nBegin the entry with the author’s last name, followed by a comma and the rest of the name, as presented in the work. End this element with a period.\n\nBhabha, Homi K. The Location of Culture. Routledge, 1994.\n\nTitle of source\n\nThe title of the source should follow the author’s name. Depending upon the type of source, it should be listed in italics or quotation marks.\n\nA book should be in italics:\n\nHenley, Patricia. The Hummingbird House. MacMurray, 1999.\n\nAn individual webpage should be in quotation marks. The name of the parent website, which MLA treats as a \"container,\" should follow in italics:\n\nLundman, Susan. \"How to Make Vegetarian Chili.\" eHow, www.ehow.com/how_10727_make-vegetarian-chili.html.*\n\nA periodical (journal, magazine, newspaper) article should be in quotation marks:\n\nBagchi, Alaknanda. \"Conflicting Nationalisms: The Voice of the Subaltern in Mahasweta Devi's Bashai Tudu.\" Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature, vol. 15, no. 1, 1996, pp. 41-50.\n\nA song or piece of music on an album should be in quotation marks. The name of the album should then follow in italics:\n\nBeyoncé. \"Pray You Catch Me.\" Lemonade, Parkwood Entertainment, 2016, www.beyonce.com/album/lemonade-visual-album/.\n\n*The MLA handbook recommends including URLs when citing online sources. For more information, see the “Optional Elements” section below.\n\nTitle of container\n\nThe eighth edition of the MLA handbook introduced what are referred to as \"containers,\" which are the larger wholes in which the source is located. For example, if you want to cite a poem that is listed in a collection of poems, the individual poem is the source, while the larger collection is the container. The title of the container is usually italicized and followed by a comma, since the information that follows next describes the container.\n\nKincaid, Jamaica. \"Girl.\" The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories, edited by Tobias Wolff, Vintage, 1994, pp. 306-07.\n\nThe container may also be a television series, which is made up of episodes.\n\n“94 Meetings.” Parks and Recreation, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, performance by Amy Poehler, season 2, episode 21, Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2010.\n\nThe container may also be a website, which contains articles, postings, and other works.\n\nIn some cases, a container might be within a larger container. You might have read a book of short stories on Google Books, or watched a television series on Netflix. You might have found the electronic version of a journal on JSTOR. It is important to cite these containers within containers so that your readers can find the exact source that you used.\n\n“94 Meetings.” Parks and Recreation, season 2, episode 21, NBC, 29 Apr. 2010. Netflix, www.netflix.com/watch/70152031?trackId=200256157&tctx=0%2C20%2C0974d361-27cd-44de-9c2a-2d9d868b9f64-12120962.\n\nLanghamer, Claire. “Love and Courtship in Mid-Twentieth-Century England.” Historical Journal, vol. 50, no. 1, 2007, pp. 173-96. ProQuest, doi:10.1017/S0018246X06005966. Accessed 27 May 2009.\n\nOther contributors\n\nIn addition to the author, there may be other contributors to the source who should be credited, such as editors, illustrators, translators, etc. If their contributions are relevant to your research, or necessary to identify the source, include their names in your documentation.\n\nFoucault, Michel. Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason. Translated by Richard Howard, Vintage-Random House, 1988.\n\nWoolf, Virginia. Jacob’s Room. Annotated and with an introduction by Vara Neverow, Harcourt, Inc., 2008.\n\nVersion\n\nIf a source is listed as an edition or version of a work, include it in your citation.\n\nThe Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998.\n\nCrowley, Sharon, and Debra Hawhee. Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students. 3rd ed., Pearson, 2004.\n\nNumber\n\nIf a source is part of a numbered sequence, such as a multi-volume book or journal with both volume and issue numbers, those numbers must be listed in your citation.\n\nDolby, Nadine. “Research in Youth Culture and Policy: Current Conditions and Future Directions.” Social Work and Society: The International Online-Only Journal, vol. 6, no. 2, 2008, www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/60/362. Accessed 20 May 2009.\n\n“94 Meetings.” Parks and Recreation, created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur, performance by Amy Poehler, season 2, episode 21, Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2010.\n\nQuintilian. Institutio Oratoria. Translated by H. E. Butler, vol. 2, Loeb-Harvard UP, 1980.\n\nPublisher\n\nThe publisher produces or distributes the source to the public. If there is more than one publisher, and they are all are relevant to your research, list them in your citation, separated by a forward slash (/).\n\nKlee, Paul. Twittering Machine. 1922. Museum of Modern Art, New York. The Artchive, www.artchive.com/artchive/K/klee/twittering_machine.jpg.html. Accessed May 2006.\n\nWomen's Health: Problems of the Digestive System. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2006.\n\nDaniels, Greg and Michael Schur, creators. Parks and Recreation. Deedle-Dee Productions and Universal Media Studios, 2015.\n\nNote: The publisher’s name need not be included in the following sources: periodicals, works published by their author or editor, websites whose titles are the same name as their publisher, websites that make works available but do not actually publish them (such as YouTube, WordPress, or JSTOR).\n\nPublication date\n\nThe same source may have been published on more than one date, such as an online version of an original source. For example, a television series might have aired on a broadcast network on one date, but released on Netflix on a different date. When the source has more than one date, it is sufficient to use the date that is most relevant to your writing. If you’re unsure about which date to use, go with the date of the source’s original publication.\n\nIn the following example, Mutant Enemy is the primary production company, and “Hush” was released in 1999. Below is a general citation for this television episode:\n\n“Hush.” Buffy the Vampire Slayer, created by Joss Whedon, performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar, season 4, Mutant Enemy, 1999.\n\nHowever, if you are discussing, for example, the historical context in which the episode originally aired, you should cite the full date. Because you are specifying the date of airing, you would then use WB Television Network (rather than Mutant Enemy), because it was the network (rather than the production company) that aired the episode on the date you’re citing.\n\n“Hush.” Buffy the Vampire Slayer, created by Joss Whedon, performance by Sarah Michelle Gellar, season 4, episode 10, WB Television Network, 14 Dec. 1999.\n\nLocation\n\nYou should be as specific as possible in identifying a work’s location.\n\nAn essay in a book or an article in a journal should include page numbers.\n\nAdiche, Chimamanda Ngozi. “On Monday of Last Week.” The Thing around Your Neck, Alfred A. Knopf, 2009, pp. 74-94.\n\nThe location of an online work should include a URL. Remove any \"http://\" or \"https://\" tag from the beginning of the URL.\n\nWheelis, Mark. \"Investigating Disease Outbreaks Under a Protocol to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.\" Emerging Infectious Diseases, vol. 6, no. 6, 2000, pp. 595-600, wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/6/6/00-0607_article. Accessed 8 Feb. 2009.\n\nWhen citing a physical object that you experienced firsthand, identify the place of location.\n\nMatisse, Henri. The Swimming Pool. 1952, Museum of Modern Art, New York.\n\nOptional elements\n\nThe ninth edition is designed to be as streamlined as possible. The author should include any information that helps readers easily identify the source, without including unnecessary information that may be distracting. The following is a list of optional elements that can be included in a documented source at the writer’s discretion.\n\nDate of original publication:\n\nIf a source has been published on more than one date, the writer may want to include both dates if it will provide the reader with necessary or helpful information.\n\nErdrich, Louise. Love Medicine. 1984. Perennial-Harper, 1993.\n\nCity of publication:\n\nThe seventh edition handbook required the city in which a publisher is located, but the eighth edition states that this is only necessary in particular instances, such as in a work published before 1900. Since pre-1900 works were usually associated with the city in which they were published, your documentation may substitute the city name for the publisher’s name.\n\nThoreau, Henry David. Excursions. Boston, 1863.\n\nDate of access:\n\nWhen you cite an online source, the MLA Handbook recommends including a date of access on which you accessed the material, since an online work may change or move at any time.\n\nBernstein, Mark. \"10 Tips on Writing the Living Web.\" A List Apart: For People Who Make Websites, 16 Aug. 2002, alistapart.com/article/writeliving. Accessed 4 May 2009.\n\nURLs:\n\nAs mentioned above, while the MLA handbook recommends including URLs when you cite online sources, you should always check with your instructor or editor and include URLs at their discretion.\n\nDOIs:\n\nA DOI, or digital object identifier, is a series of digits and letters that leads to the location of an online source. Articles in journals are often assigned DOIs to ensure that the source is locatable, even if the URL changes. If your source is listed with a DOI, use that instead of a URL.\n\nAlonso, Alvaro, and Julio A. Camargo. \"Toxicity of Nitrite to Three Species of Freshwater Invertebrates.\" Environmental Toxicology, vol. 21, no. 1, 3 Feb. 2006, pp. 90-94. Wiley Online Library, doi: 10.1002/tox.20155.\n\nCreating in-text citations using the previous (eighth) edition\n\nAlthough the MLA handbook is currently in its ninth edition, some information about citing in the text using the older (eighth) edition is being retained. The in-text citation is a brief reference within your text that indicates the source you consulted. It should properly attribute any ideas, paraphrases, or direct quotations to your source, and should direct readers to the entry in the Works Cited list. For the most part, an in-text citation is the author’s name and the page number (or just the page number, if the author is named in the sentence) in parentheses:\n\nImperialism is “the practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory” (Said 9).\n\nor\n\nAccording to Edward W. Said, imperialism is defined by “the practice, the theory, and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory” (9).\n\nWork Cited\n\nSaid, Edward W. Culture and Imperialism. Knopf, 1994.\n\nWhen creating in-text citations for media that has a runtime, such as a movie or podcast, include the range of hours, minutes and seconds you plan to reference. For example: (00:02:15-00:02:35).\n\nAgain, your goal is to attribute your source and provide a reference without interrupting your text. Your readers should be able to follow the flow of your argument without becoming distracted by extra information.\n\nHow to Cite the Purdue OWL in MLA\n\nEntire Website\n\nThe Purdue OWL. Purdue U Writing Lab, 2019.\n\nIndividual Resources\n\nContributors' names. \"Title of Resource.\" The Purdue OWL, Purdue U Writing Lab, Last edited date.\n\nThe new OWL no longer lists most pages' authors or publication dates. Thus, in most cases, citations will begin with the title of the resource, rather than the developer's name."
