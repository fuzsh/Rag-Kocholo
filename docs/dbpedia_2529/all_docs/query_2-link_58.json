        "text": "PASADENA, Calif.â€” The City of Pasadena Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department will host its 9th Annual Centennial Square Boxing Show event in front of City Hall, 100 N. Garfield Ave., on Friday, Aug. 23, 2024, from 7-10 p.m. This free, family-friendly event features 12 bouts of action-packed, Olympic-style boxing, with both male and female competitors ages 8 and older. Boxing promotes physical and mental discipline, strength, and well-being, and is often a good fit for youth.\n\nThe evening kicks off with the national anthem and a color guard presentation from Pasadena's 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marine Regiment. Attendees will also enjoy DJ music, classic cars on display, and food for purchase.\n\nFor more information about the Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department and its programs, visit CityOfPasadena.net/Parks-And-Rec or call (626) 744-6530."
