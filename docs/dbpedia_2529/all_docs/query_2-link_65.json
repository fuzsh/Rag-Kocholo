The FSB has asked the IFRS Foundation to take over the monitoring of the progress of companies’ climate-related disclosures.\n\nAs of November 2023, this website will no longer be updated or monitored but will remain available to serve as a resource for materials developed by the Task Force. The Task Force is deeply grateful to all parties involved for their input, support, and adoption of the TCFD recommendations."
