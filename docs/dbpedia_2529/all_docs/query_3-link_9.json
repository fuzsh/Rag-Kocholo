        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIt was the last day of sophomore year, Eddie couldn't wait to get the hell out of school and start the beginning of his summer. But, he couldn't just leave without pulling off some kind of prank.\n\nEddie had been planning it for weeks, gathering his friend group to help him execute his prank. He was a jokester by nature, a trouble-maker who loved to push boundaries and create chaos. This prank was no exception.\n\nAs the last bell rang, signaling the end of the school day, Eddie's adrenaline spiked. It was show time. With a group of his friends beside him, he made his way through the halls, his heart pounding with excitement and nervousness.\n\nThey reached their destination: the principal's office. Eddie and his friends waited around the corner, listening intently as the principal gathered his things for the day.\n\n\"This is such a bad idea,\" David said in worry.\n\n\"Relax. If we are fast enough, no one will know it was us.\" Eddie reassured.\n\n\"Besides, it's not illegal, just a bit mischievous,\" Gareth added. He was the second to Eddie in terms of trouble-making, always ready to join in on Eddie's schemes.\n\n\"What if we get caught?\" Jeff asked in a whisper of anxiety, his dad was a police officer in their small town... Eddie didn't blame him for being worried.\n\n\"I'll take the blame, relax,\" Eddie waved a dismissive hand. He wasn't new to pranks or trouble.\n\nThe sound of footsteps grew louder, signaling the principal was exiting his office. Eddie looked at his friends, a mix of excitement and nervousness on their faces.\n\n\"Alright, everybody ready?\" he whispered.\n\nHis friends nodded, all of them tense with anticipation.\n\n\"On my count,\" Eddie said, raising his hand. \"One... two... three!\"\n\nAs Eddie got to three, the four of them lifted up their buckets of red paint, dousing the principal completely.\n\nThey quickly bolted down the hallway, trying to contain their laughter as the principal let out a loud cry of surprise and anger.\n\n\"Run!\" Eddie shouted, leading the charge as they made a beeline for the exit.\n\n\"Think he knew it was us?\" Gareth panted as the four of them ditched the buckets, tossing them aside as they ran like hell down the hall.\n\n\"Munson!!!!\" The principals voice boomed from behind them.\n\nEddie looked back over his shoulder as he ran, seeing the principal dripping in red, slipping and sliding around. \"Looks like you forgot your tampon!\" Eddie yelled out with a snicker.\n\nThis earned a laugh from his friends, who were all running alongside him. The principal's face turned bright red with anger, and Eddie could see the veins popping out of his neck.\n\n\"I'll get you for this, Munson!\" the principal yelled, continuing to slip and slide around.\n\n\"Next year, Principal Oaks,\" Eddie gave a salute. Eyes widening as the principal began sprinting after them. Panic filled his chest, his heart hammering against his ribcage as the principal's voice echoed through the empty halls. \"Go, go, go!\" he urged his friends, picking up the pace as they barreled towards the exit doors.\n\n\"HURRY!\" he yelled over his shoulder.\n\nGareth and Jeff were in the lead, pushing through the doors and darting towards the parking lot. Eddie and David were right behind, glancing over their shoulders to see the principal gaining ground on them.\n\nEddie and David pushed through the exit doors. \"My van! get to my van!\" eddie yelled but the four came to a hard stop at the end of the steps, Eddie's van coming to a hard stop in front of them. The passenger door was opened from the driver side. \"Get in!\" Robin urged.\n\nThe boys didn't need to be told twice, scrambling into the van. Robin climbed over to the passenger seat while Eddie hopped in the drivers seat as he slammed on the gas. They shot out of the parking lot, the principal still yelling after them.\n\n\"Holy shit,\" Gareth sounded like he had just saw a ghost, the boys and Robin all laughing as they stared out of the back windows at the principal.\n\n\"Oh god, he's so pissed,\" Robin laughed even louder.\n\nEddie's eyes flicked to the rear view mirror. He knew he was safe. Home free. While he may have to deal with the consequences come September, right now... there was nothing the principal could do.\n\n\"Jesus,\" he breathed out, heart pounding as he pulled out onto the road.\n\nThe adrenaline rush was intense, leaving Eddie feeling almost dizzy. He chuckled as he looked at his friends in the rearview mirror.\n\n\"That was insane,\" he said with a wild grin, still trying to catch his breath. \"We frickin' got away with it.\"\n\n\"Thanks to Robin,\" Jeff chimed from the back. \"Who knew she was such a good getaway driver,\" David added on with a laugh.\n\nRobin snorted, \"As if I haven't been saving your guys asses all year,\" she chimed.\n\n\"Good point,\" Eddie laughed hard, beginning to feel his heart rate steady.\n\n\"Have to drop me off first â€” my moms going to be pissed if I'm late,\" David said from the back, his family was going to his grandmas for the summer.\n\n\"Me second,\" Jeff added on. \"By tomorrow I will be in Florida living there high life... well, at least for three weeks.\" He said.\n\n\"What about you two?\" Eddie's eyes flicked to robins then to Gareths in the rear view mirror.\n\n\"I figured I'd hang at the trailer with you.\" Robin said with a shrug.\n\n\"Yeah same,\" Gareth agreed. \"Not like we have any cool places to be.\"\n\nEddie nodded. \"Alright, then it's settled,\" he said, feeling a sense of satisfaction. Hanging out with Robin and Gareth for the summer sounded like a perfect plan, a nice break from school and all the other bullshit that came with it.\n\n\"Alright, dropoff central,\" Eddie joked as he parked in front of David's house.\n\nDavid climbed out of the van, waving a farewell. \"See you losers in August,\" he said as he walked up to his house.\n\nEveryone's bye became a choir of one big collective goodbye, everyone waving before Robin shut the back door.\n\nEddie began driving again, Jeff's house was only a block away. As they approached Jeff's house, Eddie couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness. He was going to miss his friends over the summer. But he knew August would bring them all back together again.\n\nHe pulled into Jeff's driveway, giving a wave to Jeff's mom who stood on the porch. \"Good luck sweating your balls off in Florida,\" Eddie teased as he loooked back at Jeff.\n\n\"Oh please, like you don't wish you were going somewhere nice and hot too,\" Jeff retorted with a laugh, knowing damn well Eddie hated the hot weather.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" Eddie chuckled, rolling his eyes. \"Get your ass out of my car. We'll see you in August.\"\n\nJeff climbed out of the van, giving the group one last wave before heading up to his house.\n\nEddie started driving again, \"Shit, low on gas,\" He huffed. he looked at Robin in the passenger seat then Gareth in the back. \"Which one of you will pump?\"\n\n\"Jesus, Eddie, you're so lazy,\" Robin said in a laugh mixed scoff.\n\n\"No.. no. i just want to go in and buy some smokes... some snacks,\" Eddie said in his defence.\n\n\"You must have made some good deals to have cash on you,\" Gareth said curiously.\n\nEddie shrugged, \"What can I say, I'm in high demand,\" he said with a smirk. \"But seriously, can one of you just pump the gas for me?\"\n\n\"Fine,\" Gareth groaned, taking on the task as Eddie pulled into the gas station.\n\n\"Can you buy me a soda? Please? It's so hot out,\" Robin grumbled from the passenger seat.\n\nEddie scoffed as he parked beside a pump, \"No. there's soda at my place,\" he said as he climbed out of the van.\n\n\"Oh come on,\" Robin groaned, her and Gareth climbing out of the van too.\n\nEddie shook his head slowly while Robin rounded the van to him, Gareth laughed as he grabbed the gas pump.\n\n\"You suck,\" Robin grumbled.\n\n\"Hey guys, look,\" Gareths void caught both Eddie and robins attention, their eyes following what he was looking at.\n\nEddie perked up at the sight of a moving van parked by another pump, a boy, his age and jaw droppingly pretty, though misplaced with his high end polo shirt and put together appearance, was pumping the gas.\n\n\"Holy fuck,\" Eddie said in a gasp of a whisper.\n\n\"So what, there's a new kid? Big deal.\" Robin blew it off, not interested in the slightest.\n\nEddie couldn't take his eyes off the boy at the other pump. Robin may not be interested, but Eddie was feeling all sorts of emotions in that moment.\n\n\"Dude, he's hot,\" Eddie muttered, still staring.\n\nGareth leaned in. \"Dude, you're drooling,\" he teased.\n\nRobin and Gareth both snickered. Both knew Eddie swung both ways, just like everyone knew Robin was into girls.\n\n\"Since when are you into the preppy type?\" Robin quipped as she leaned against Eddie's van.\n\nEddie tore his eyes away from the pretty boy, focusing back on Robin. \"I have diverse tastes, Robin. Don't box me in,\" he said with a smirk.\n\nGareth chimed in, \"Yeah, remember that one time you had a thing for that goth girl in our French class?\"\n\nEddie rolled his eyes, \"She wasn't goth â€” she was a punk,\" he clarified.\n\n\"Or that boy who was heavily into Star Wars,\" Robin murmured with a laugh.\n\nEddie felt his cheeks heat up slightly at the mention of the Star Wars boy. That had been a short, yet intense, crush. \"What can I say? I was intrigued by his love for lightsabers and X-wing fighters,\" he replied, trying to play it cool.\n\nGareth snickered. \"Yeah, bet you wanted to see his light saber,\" he said, taking the pump from the tank and putting it back.\n\nEddie shot Gareth a glare, his cheeks now definitely flushed red. \"Oh, shut up,\" he retorted, knowing he had walked right into that one.\n\nRobin burst into laughter, clearly enjoying the exchange.\n\nAs if on cue, the pretty boy who had been pumping the gas looked up, his gaze meeting Eddie's for a brief moment.\n\nEddie's brain short-circuited for a moment, his heart skipping a beat before he managed to look away, acting natural. He Went to look away, only, whipping his head a little too dramatically, ending up colliding it with robins.\n\nRobin let out a small yelp of pain as they bonked heads. \"Jesus, Eddie!\" she exclaimed, rubbing the now throbbing spot on her forehead. Gareth struggled to contain his laughter, watching the scene unfold.\n\nEddie winced himself, cursing himself under his breath. He prayed the boy didn't see that.\n\n\"Just go pay for the gas and get your snacks or whatever,\" Robin grumbled, a little moody now from the unexpected head bonk.\n\n\"Should I say something to him â€” to the boy?\" Eddie looked from Robin to Gareth.\n\n\"Knowing your clumsy ass, before you can say anything you'll fall in front of him or something,\" Gareth poked fun.\n\nEddie rolled his eyes, knowing damn well what Gareth said was probably true.\n\n\"Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence,\" he grumbled, running a hand through his messy hair.\n\nGareth sighed, \"Look at him. you think a guy like that is going to give any of us the time of day? Hes probably moving to the rich end of Hawkins or maybe even just passing through to some big, busy city.\"\n\nEddie couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment at Gareth's words. The pretty boy did seem out of the group's league.\n\n\"Yeah, you're probably right,\" he admitted, trying to sound casual about it. But inside, he couldn't help but feel a bit deflated.\n\n\"Come on, Eddie, let's just go,\" Robin pulled on his shirt in attempts to pull him forward.\n\nEddie relented, taking one last look at the boy before turning around. He followed Robin and Gareth into the store, his mind still preoccupied with the handsome stranger.\n\nThe bell above the gas station door chimed as the three of them entered. it was cool compared to the heat outside.\n\n\"That must be the boys mom,\"Robin whispered as the three of them started down an aisle. Eddie looked at the woman at the counter, She definitely was of higher class. blonde hair styled to perfection, a designer skirt and coat, high heels. \"You know they're rich when they wear fancy coats in this kind of heat,\" Eddie snickered.\n\nGareth laughed in agreement. The three split off to roam around, Eddie grabbed a bag of chips for himself and then made his way to the cold aisle, eyeing the fridges than the cashier who was busy ringing someone up. Eddie quickly grabbed a single tall can, shoving it into his jeans waist band and pulling his shirt on top of him.\n\nEddie gave a sly grin, feeling the cold can pressed against his skin. He had gotten good at this by now, and it felt like a small victory every time he successfully stole something without getting caught.\n\nHe made way to the cigarettes, picking the cheapest pack off the shelf, looking around until the coast was clear and pocketing those too.\n\nhe made his way to the counter, Robin and Gareth behind him to buy their own snacks.\n\nEddie placed his bag of chips on the counter and a ten dollar bill, the majority of it going to the gas.\n\nThe cashier rang him up and took his money. Eddie tried his best not to look suspicious as he waited for his change, he could feel his heart rate increase slightly, the thrill of the possible chance he could get busted in any second.\n\nThe man gave him his change, which Eddie gladly stuffed into his pocket. \"Have a nice day,\" the man said in a monotone voice.\n\n\"You too,\" Eddie grinned, taking his bag of chips and heading out the door, peering in to see ricin and Gareth buying their own items. Eddie made his way to his van, opening the driver side door, tossing his chips in then pulling the van of beer from his waistband.\n\nHis eyes flicked up to the moving van and the expensive car parked in front of it, eyes landing on the boy who was looking at him and then the can in his hands as he climbed into the driver seat.\n\nEddie cursed under his breath, his eyes widened as he caught the boy's gaze. The pretty boy was definitely eyeing the can in Eddie's hand. Eddie's heart felt like it was going to leap out of his chest. He tried to act natural, he's been in situations like this before but something about the judging look on the pretty boys face was making him feel nervous.\n\nHe quickly acted like he had no idea the boy was there, climbing into his van and anxiously awaiting Robin and Gareth to leave the store. Eddie took out the pack of cigarettes he stole, opening the carton and slipping one out, putting it between his lips as he finally saw Robin and Gareth heading towards the van\n\nRobin hopped into the passenger side once again, Gareth in the back. \"Ready?\" Eddie asked as he lit his cigarette.\n\nBoth Robin and Gareth said a quick \"Yup,\" but Gareth continued on. \"You're really getting bold with the five finger discounts.\" He said as he noticed the beer in the Center console.\n\nEddie shrugged, taking a drag of his cigarette as he started his van, trying to look casual, \"Better than paying for it.\"\n\nHe looked out of his driver's seat window, checking to see if the pretty boy was still there. But he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nEddie sighed, pulling away from the pump and out of the lot, onto the street. He took slow drags of his cigarette. Flicking the ashes out of the window.\n\nThe ride back to trailer park was a short one. The three of them rode in silence as they munched on snacks and Eddie continued to smoke.\n\nHe tried to shake the encounter with the pretty boy from his mind, telling himself he'd probably never see the guy again anyways. But he couldn't stop thinking about how those chocolate brown eyes seemed to look right through him.\n\nPulling up to his trailer, he turned off the van and hopped out, Robin and Gareth in tow. Eddie walked over to the off brown, dingy couch on his porch and flopped down on it with a sigh, chips and stolen beer in hand.\n\nGareth settled into a plastic chair while Robin took up the other end of the couch, it was hot and muggy, but the three often hangout there when Wayne - Eddie's uncle was home.\n\nEddie cracked open the beer, taking a long satisfying sip with an equally satisfied sigh.\n\n\"So, are we thinking movie night here or what?\" Gareth leaned forward with a raised brow.\n\nEddie laughed as he placed his beer on the table. \"I swear you two are here more than your own homes,\" he said. not like they lived far anyways, Robin lived a few trailers down, across the way. Gareth a few trailers behind.\n\nRobin snorted in agreement, \"Can you blame us? My mom is still hell bent on finding me a boy to bring on 'dates'.\"\n\nEddie frowned at that. \"She really isn't giving up, huh?\"\n\n\"Nope.\" Robin groaned, tossing a handful of chips into her mouth.\n\n\"And my dad is well, my dad,\" Gareth mumbled, opening his already melting chocolate bar.\n\n\"Your dad is a dick,\" Eddie muttered with a scowl.\n\nThey all knew about Gareth's dad. It was no secret in the trailer park that the old man was a straight up jerk to him and his mother.\n\nNot like Eddie's dad was any better, a king of petty crimes, fraud, theft, in and out of jail most of his life and leaving eddie to fend for himself â€” until Wayne, Eddie's uncle, took him in.\n\nEddie pushed those thoughts down, \"Movie night here it is,\" he said, picking up his beer to take another swig only for his jaw to drop as he watched a familiar expensive olds mobile drive past and then a moving van, parking at the trailer right across from Eddie's.\n\n\"Is.. is that...\" he stuttered.\n\nRobin twisted in her seat, her eyes widened. \"No way...\"\n\nGareth popped his head up, looking in the same direction. \"Oh wow...\"\n\nThe three exchanged glances. Eddie felt his heartbeat pick up speed.\n\n\"That's the moving van from the gas station,\" Eddie mumbled, trying to keep his cool.\n\nRobin gave him a side eye glance, a sly smile on her face. \"And that is defiantly the car from gas station.\"\n\nGareth couldn't help but let out a small laughed. \"Well would you look at that.\"\n\n\"They have to have the wrong place right? There's no way people like that are moving in here,\" Eddie said in a hushed tone to Gareth and Robin.\n\n\"Maybe they're just visiting someone?\" Gareth suggested as he leaned forward, watching the movers bring boxes in.\n\nRobin was quiet for a moment. \"Then why are they unpacking?\"\n\nEddie swallowed hard, feeling nervous. The odds of those people actually living here were slim to none. But if they did...\n\nHe tried to calm down and pushed down the anxiety and excitement bubbling up inside him at the thought of seeing the pretty boy again.\n\nThe small group continued watching, seeing more boxes being carried into the trailer. They were definitely moving in.\n\nGareth was the first to break the silence. \"This is going to get...interesting.\"\n\nEddie played dumb, \"What do you mean?\" He asked, taking a slow sip on his beer\n\n\"Oh please,\" Robin laughed, taking Eddie chips as her own which earned her a glare. \"You having that guy as a neighbour? That's free entertainment at its finest.\"\n\n\"I have no idea what you're talking about,\" Eddie protested in an over dramatic manner.\n\nRobin rolled her eyes, \"You're a terrible liar you know that?\"\n\n\"You checked out that guys ass so hard, I thought your eyes were gonna pop out of your head.\" Gareth snickered from his seat.\n\nEddie sunk into the couch, trying to turn invisible from the heat in his cheeks. His eyes locked on the boy, perfect, preppy and in all his glory as he sat on the front steps of the trailer, looking like he'd rather be anywhere else.\n\nEddie was debating going over, saying something, but that thought quickly left his mind as he heard police sirens. \"Shit, shit,\" Eddie panicked, eyes locking on a police car coming towards them. \"Hide my beer,\" Eddie hissed, handing it to Gareth.\n\nEddie knew the police had to be coming for him, that was more likely than them not coming for him. He was use to it.\n\nRobin and Gareth froze as the familiar sound of police siren approached.\n\n\"What'd you do this time?\" Robin asked with a deep sigh as she and Gareth hid the beer out of sight.\n\n\"what haven't I done?\" Eddie stood up, walking to the edge of his porch as the police car pulled up. \"Great, it's Hopper,\"!Eddie huffed. if there was one police officer that was the most hard on him, it would be Hopper.\n\nThe chief stepped out the car and headed towards Eddie, a serious expression on his face. \"Edward Munson,\" he greeted with a gruff tone.\n\nGareth and Robin, who were still sitting, shared looks. Gareth knew Eddie hated being called Edward.\n\nEddie cleared his throat, trying to keep his cool. \"How's it going, Chief?\"\n\n\"Oh, how's it going? How's it going?! I was in the middle of â€”- something â€”- when I got a call from James,\" Hopper huffed, voice raising as he approached eddie, cigarette dangling from his lips.\n\nEddie, Gareth and Robin asked collectively in confusion, \"Whose James?\"\n\nHopper let out a growl, even with sunglasses on, Eddie knew he was scowling. \"principal Oaks,\" Hopper stated sharply.\n\nEddie internally groaned, he knew exactly where this was going.\n\nGareth and Robin snickered at Hop's annoyance.\n\n\"Let me guess,\" Eddie began, \"He told you there was an incident at the school today?\"\n\nHopper pinched the bridge of his nose, \"Incident? Incident?\" He laughed. \"Kid, you drenched your principal in red paint!\"\n\nRobin couldn't help but chuckle, her face buried in her hands. Gareth was hiding a smile behind his fist.\n\nEddie feigned innocence, \"What can I say? I was feeling artistic.\"\n\nHe went to walk away, only to be grabbed by the collar by Hopper. Eddie grimaced at the strong grip on his shirt, hating the fact that Hopper could easily overtake him if he wanted to.\n\nRobin and Gareth were trying â€” and failing miserably â€” to hold back their laughter at the sight.\n\n\"Cut the bullshit, Munson.\" Hopper spat, releasing Eddie's collar.\n\n\"So I might've gotten a little paint on the principal,\" Eddie shrugged, acting nonchalant. \"He'll live.\"\n\nHopper laughed hard, finishing off his cigarette then stomping it out with his foot. \"Yeah, he will leave.\" He nodded. \"But you seem blissfully unaware that what you did can count as assault.\"\n\nEddie froze, his eyes widened. \"Now you're overreacting.\"\n\nGareth and Robin went quiet, knowing this wasn't looking good for Eddie.\n\n\"I'm overreacting?!\" Hopper threw his hands up. \"You're lucky he's not pressing charges!\"\n\nGareth and Robin couldn't help the relieved sighs that passed their lips at that.\n\n\"I'm warning you, Munson,\" Hopper said in a deep voice. \"Stay out of trouble or the next time I'm hauling your ass down to the station and throwing you in a goddamn cell.\"\n\nEddie was about to speak when the trailer door opened, Wayne, Eddie's uncle stepping out. \"What'd he do this time?\" Wayne sighed.\n\nEddie groaned, \"You heard?\"\n\nHopper chuckled, \"Of course he heard. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone in the trailer park heard.\"\n\n\"I did in fact hear,\" Wayne confirmed. \"How the hell did you manage to get red paint to soak the principal?\"\n\nWayne gave Eddie a disapproving look. \"Damn it, Kid.\"\n\n\"Hey, I was doing him a favor! That suit was hideous.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, he's not pressing charges,\" Hopper held up a hand.\n\n\"What's the damage then?\" Wayne sighed, coming to a stop beside Eddie and pulling out his pocket.\n\nA satisfied, cruel idea of a smirk crept up on Hoppers lips. Eddies stomach turned. He didn't like where this may be going.\n\n\"No damage, but a deal,\" Hopper said confidently.\n\nWayne glanced at Eddie then back to Hopper, \"I'm listening.\"\n\nEddie knew he was not going to like whatever deal Hopper had in mind.\n\nHopper gave a cocky grin. \"Twenty hours of Community service, Or a week behind bars. Your choice.\"\n\nEddie stuck out his wrist, already having made his choice. \"Take me away,\" he said wistful, flinching as Wayne whacked him in the shoulder. \"Ow,\" Eddie mumbled.\n\n\"20 hours of community service,\" Wayne agreed with Hopper.\n\nEddie knew he was not going to like whatever deal Hopper had in mind.\n\nRobin and Gareth were trying to keep themselves quiet as they watched the interaction happen. They couldn't help the smiles on their faces.\n\n\"Fine,\" Eddie sulked, dropping his wrist.\n\n\"But one more screw up and you're getting the week in a cell,\" Hopper warned with a serious tone. \"Understand?\"\n\nEddie rolled his eyes, \"Understood,\" he mumbled.\n\n\"And don't think I don't smell the beer on you,\" Hopper pointed at Eddie accusingly. \"I'll see you tomorrow at the station, eight am sharp.\"\n\nRobin snickered as Eddie let out a huff like a moody teenager.\n\n\"Sure,\" he grumbled, not looking forward to seeing Hop tomorrow.\n\nHopper gave a stiff smile before stalking back to his car, leaving Eddie with an unamused Wayne.\n\nEddie braced himself for a scolding from his uncle, he knew he would be paying for this one.\n\nWayne said nothing, merely staring at Eddie with a stern glare. That was worse than a scolding.\n\nWayne finally spoke, \"I'd ground you but it's not like you ever listen to that anyways, so instead, tomorrow after you're done community service, you and I are going to take a drive up to the prison and maybe your father can knock some sense into you.\"\n\nEddie's heart dropped. \"No,\" he protested. \"There's nothing for him to teach me anyways â€”\"\n\nEddie was cut off by a straightening up, angry Wayne. \"Do you not see what path your going down? whose footsteps you're following in?\" he looked Eddie dead in the eye. \"You keep going like this and your father isn't going to be the only Munson in prison.\"\n\nThat struck a nerve with Eddie. He would never end up like his deadbeat dad.\n\nHe clenched his jaw, \"I'm not him,\" he said with anger in his tone. \"It was just some stupid prank â€” it's not my fault the principal couldn't handle it.\"\n\nWayne shook his head, his disappointment was obvious. \"Don't give me attitude, Kid,\" his voice was still stern. \"Maybe next time you'll think before you do. You don't have anyone to blame but yourself.\"\n\nEddie didn't say a word, knowing he had messed up and pissed off his uncle.\n\nHis shoulders slumped in defeat as Wayne headed back inside the trailer. A silence between Eddie, robin and Gareth ensued before Robin let out a hushed whisper. \"That boy you we're drooling over? Totally watching,\" she subtly gestured to the trailer across from them.\n\nEddies cheeks flushed, forgetting the boy was there and moving in. Great, what a nice introduction.\n\nEddie followed her gaze, his cheeks heating up once he laid eyes on him. 'Oh god,' he internally groaned.\n\nGareth chuckled, amused by Eddies reaction. \"You've got it bad, man.\"\n\nEddie looked over at the other trailer, the boy still sitting on the steps and watching with a face of amusement. Eddie opened his arms wide, \"Welcome to the shit show,\" he yelled out. Not like he could embarrass himself further.\n\nThe boy laughed, covering his mouth with his hand. It took all of Eddie's willpower not to melt right then and there.\n\n\"You're such a goner, man,\" Gareth snickered. \"How are you so hopeless?\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" Eddie mumbled, unable to tear gaze away from the boy. \"He's probably just laughing at how pathetic I look right now.\"\n\n\"We all are,\" robin laughed, lounging back on the couch.\n\nEddie shot her a glare then turned to Gareth, \"Give me my beer,\" Eddie grumbled with a grabby hand.\n\nGareth rolled his eyes, grabbing the beer which he had hid out of view from Hopper and handing it to Eddie.\n\nEddie took the beer from Gareth and took a long much-needed drink.\n\nAs he pulled the bottle away, he chanced another look at the boy. To his dismay â€” and slight satisfactionâ€” the boy was still looking at him.\n\n\"He's still looking over here,\" he said to the other two, trying his best to remain cool.\n\n\"He's probably just waiting for the next sideshow,\" Robin said, crunching on chips.\n\nEddie huffed, \"I'm not a sideshow,\" he muttered.\n\n\"But you do give great entertainment,\" Gareth pointed out, earning a punch to the shoulder from Eddie.\n\n\"I'm going to go over there,\" Eddie said determined, downing his beer for some semblance of confidence.\n\nGareth and Robin immediately perked up, wide-eyed excitement on their faces.\n\n\"What?! You can't be serious â€”\" Robin protested.\n\n\"Since when do you have any game?\" Gareth added.\n\nEddie crushed the beer can, tossing it into the recycling bin. \"Can you guys be helpful... at least once in your lives?!\" He hissed.\n\nBoth Gareth and Robin let out a unison \"no\" which Eddie was expecting.\n\n\"I got this,\" he said through gritted teeth as he walked across the space between his own trailer and the one across. He felt all their eyes on his back.\n\nHe made it halfway between his trailer and the boys, the boys eyes locking on him curiously as he sat on the porch, the moving van driving away and the boys mom coming up to the steps. Parents. Eddie was terrible with them, especially rich ones. He was like a fish out of water, short circuiting and spinning on heel to walk back to his trailer. Cursing himself. Knowing he looked like an idiot.\n\nGareth and Robin watched in disbelief as Eddie turned to walk back at a brisk pace.\n\nGareth shook his head, \"What a waste.\"\n\nRobin laughed loudly. \"What happened to 'I got this'?\" she mocked in a fake deep voice.\n\nEddie ignored them, focusing on getting back to his trailer as fast as possible.\n\n'Idiot! You are such an idiot!' He repeated in his head. Why was it always so awkward talking to attractive people?\n\nEddie kept his head down as he slumped back onto the couch on the trailers porch in defeat.\n\nGareth and Robin immediately started laughing as Eddie returned, looking utterly defeated.\n\nGareth couldn't help but tease. \"What happened? Get tongue-tied?\"\n\nEddie huffed, burying his face in his hands. \"This is a nightmare.\"\n\nRobin chuckled, \"Why did you walk away? You were doing fine!\"\n\n\"His mom came over,\" he mumbled into his palms.\n\nBoth Gareth and Robin snickered at that. \"And?\" Robin said with a smirk. \"That's it? You got scared of a mom?\"\n\nEddie dropped his hands from his face. \"She just witnessed me almost get arrested, you think a prissy mom like that is going to be cool with me talking to her son?\"\n\nGareth nodded, \"Fair point, I guess.\"\n\nEddie let out a frustrated noise from the back of his throat. He really did mess that up, huh?\n\n\"I bet he thinks I'm an absolute weirdo,\" he said with a groan.\n\n\"So much so that he went inside,\" Robin motioned to the boys trailer, the boy and his mom now gone.\n\nEddie followed her gaze. Damn, maybe that was for the best.\n\n\"I think I'll go back to celibacy,\" he grumbled.\n\nGareth and Robin both let out a snicker, clearly amused. \"What celibacy? You never get any anywayâ€”\" Gareth teased.\n\nEddie shot Gareth a glare, throwing a bottle cap over at him.\n\n\"I have gotten plenty,\" Eddie argued. \"more than either of you.\"\n\nRobin laughed, \"It's so ironic. I'd die for a girl to be into me and yet they throw themselves at you to get some of that bad boy brag but when it comes to guys.. it's like you've never talked to a human in your life.\"\n\nEddie grabbed a cigarette from his pack, \"Yeah, that's because I don't have to do the whole talking thing with girls. They want to have a taste of rebellion. They just come up to me. We do a lil foreplay or hook up and then they're on their way,\" he paused as he lit his cigarette and took a slow drag. \"Guys tho.. I mean, no one's out here but me and the guys that are in the closet either aren't my type or aren't into me.\" He explained.\n\n\"Okay, fair point,\" Robin nodded as she looked at Eddie.\n\n\"And a guy like that? Come on, I don't stand a chance,\" Eddie motioned to the other trailer.\n\n\"Well... you'd have to talk to him to find out,\" Gareth laughed.\n\n\"Oh yeah? What'd I say? 'Hey I'm the local hellion who just almost arrested, wanna be my friend?'\" Eddie muttered, taking a drag from his cigarette.\n\nBoth Robin and Gareth laughed, knowing Eddie absolutely would say that. \"I'm afraid it'd be worse,\" Robin said through her laughs.\n\n\"Yeah, that and you'd probably start sweating,\" Gareth teased, trying not to laugh further.\n\n\"And.. and he'd do that thing where he lips his licks and fiddles with his rings,\" Robin began talking directly to Gareth now.\n\n\"Oh god and the mumbling and the stumbling,\" Gareth snickered.\n\nThe two mimicked him, mumbling incoherently and fiddling with imaginary rings, pretending to be a nervous Eddie.\n\n\"This is bullying,\" Eddie said through a laugh as he took another drag from his cigarette. \"I am a victim here -\" he began, getting cut off.\n\n\"A victim of your own awkwardness,\" Gareth finished, grinning.\n\nEddie pouted, stubbing out his cigarette in the ashtray on the table. \"I'm rethinking this whole movie night since you two want to be assholes,\"\n\nBoth Robin and Gareth immediately protested.\n\n\"Cmon, we're just messing with you!\" Robin protested.\n\n\"Yeah, relax,\" Gareth chimed. \"We'll be nice. We swear.\"\n\nEddie stared at the two of them with a suspicious look on his face, not fully buying into their word. They would be nice for now at least.\n\nHe let out a dramatic and exasperated groan. \"Fine, you're both forgiven,\" he said sarcastically.\n\nHe stared back at the other trailer, unable to rid the boy from his mind. Eddie knew he'd have to do something to get the boys attention. But not tonight. Tonight he'd made way too big an idiot of himself."
