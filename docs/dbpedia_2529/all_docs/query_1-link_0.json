        "text": "American rapper and record producer (born 1990)\n\nFor the fictional characters, see Soldier Boy.\n\n\"Souljah Boy\" redirects here. For the Cleveland-based rapper, see Mo Thugs.\n\nMusical artist\n\nDeAndre Cortez Way (born July 28, 1990), known professionally as Soulja Boy (formerly Soulja Boy Tell 'Em), is an American rapper and record producer from Atlanta, Georgia. He rose to prominence after his self-released 2007 debut single, \"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\" peaked the Billboard Hot 100 for seven non-consecutive weeks.[4] After its commercial re-release by Collipark Music, an imprint of Interscope Records, the song and its follow-up, \"Soulja Girl\" led to the release of his debut studio album, Souljaboytellem.com (2007). Despite unfavorable critical reception, it peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and spawned the single \"Yahhh!.\"\n\nHis second album, iSouljaBoyTellem (2008)—supported by the Billboard Hot 100-top 20 singles \"Turn My Swag On\" and \"Kiss Me thru the Phone\" (featuring Sammie)—was met with moderate commercial reception and a further decline in critical reception. Way was listed at number 18 on the Forbes list of Hip-Hop Cash Kings of 2010, as he earned US$7 million that year.[5] His third album, The DeAndre Way (2010)—supported by the top 40 single \"Pretty Boy Swag\"—saw a steeper decline in commercial reception before he parted ways with Interscope in favor of an independent career.\n\nWay has become notable for his pioneering use of grassroots social media and digital marketing strategies during his mainstream popularity.[6] Outside of recording, he has pursued side ventures including video game development, record production for other artists, and his record label Stacks on Deck Entertainment, through which he has signed rappers including Lil B and Riff Raff. He has received a Grammy Award nomination, as well as three BET Award and four Teen Choice Award nominations.[7]\n\nEarly life\n\nWay was born in Chicago and at age six moved to Atlanta,[8] where he became interested in rap music.[9] At age 14, he moved to Batesville, Mississippi, with his father.[10]\n\nMusical career\n\nWay's father provided a recording studio for Way to explore his musical ambitions.[8] In early 2005, he was a frequent poster on the website Newgrounds,[11][12] and in November that same year, Way posted on the music website SoundClick. Following positive reviews on the site, he established accounts on YouTube and Myspace.[13][14] In March 2007, he released his first independent album, Unsigned & Still Major: Da Album Before da Album.\n\nAlso in March 2007, Way recorded \"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\", followed by a low-budget video demonstrating the \"Crank That\" dance. On May 2, \"Crank That\" was released as a single; by month's end, it had received its first airplay, and Way met with Mr. Collipark to sign a recording contract with his record label Collipark Music, which later entered a joint venture with Interscope Records shortly after.[15] On August 12, \"Crank That\" was used on the television series Entourage, and on September 1 it topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and Hot RingMasters charts.[16] During the 50th Annual Grammy Awards, \"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\" was nominated for Best Rap Song, losing to Kanye West's and T-Pain's \"Good Life\".\n\nWay's major label debut album, Souljaboytellem.com, was released in the United States on October 2,[17] peaking at number four on both the Billboard 200 and Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts.[18] The album was reportedly recorded using just the demo version of FL Studio.[19][20] Souljaboytellem.com received a favorable review from Allmusic[17] but mainly negative reviews from other sources, such as Entertainment Weekly.[21] Several reviewers credited Soulja Boy with spearheading a new trend in hip-hop, while speculating that he would be a one-hit wonder.[22][23][24]\n\nThe follow-up to Souljaboytellem.com, iSouljaBoyTellem, was released on December 16, 2008, to negative critical reception.[25] The first single from the album, \"Bird Walk\", peaked at number 40 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and the top 20 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. It was performed on YouTube Live on November 22, 2008, with an introduction from MC Hammer.[26] \"Kiss Me Thru the Phone\" (featuring Sammie) followed, peaking at number three on the Hot 100 and number one on the Hot Rap Tracks charts.[27] Chris Brown was Way's first choice to sing the hook, but respectfully turned down the offer. Way then tried to do it on his own with Auto-Tune but found it unacceptable.[28] The song sold over 2 million digital copies in the U.S., becoming Way's second to reach two million downloads.[29][30] On January 26, 2009, Way released the third single, \"Turn My Swag On\". It topped the U.S. rap charts and peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. As of August 23, 2009 , it has sold more than 1 million digital downloads in the U.S.[30]\n\nWay said his third studio album, The DeAndre Way,[31] was intended to be his most personal and successful album thus far. He said he wished to collaborate with artists such as Jay-Z, Lil Wayne, Kanye West[32] and Eminem.[33] The album's lead single, \"POW\", was released in January 2009 but failed to garner success and was dubbed a promo single. On October 30, 2009, Way released three mixtapes: Paranormal Activity, Dat Piff and Cortez.[34] It was announced on February 18, 2010, that the first single from the album was going to be \"All Black Everything\", but the single was canceled and the track was put on another promotional mixtape, Legendary.[35] The album's title was changed to Dre in an early 2010 commercial with a video snippet for \"Do It Big\" as the first single, but this was also canceled.[36] The album title reverted to The DeAndre Way in July 2010.\n\nOn June 8, 2010, the album's official lead single was \"Pretty Boy Swag\". It reached number 34 on the Billboard Hot 100, number six on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number five on the Rap Songs chart.[37] The album's second single was due to be \"Digital\", which was instead used on his promotional mixtape Best Rapper.[38] Then it was announced that \"Speakers Going Hammer\" was going to be the second single, but \"Blowing Me Kisses\" was released on August 31, 2010, as the second single instead.[39] On October 13, Way performed \"Pretty Boy Swag\" and a snippet of \"Speakers Going Hammer\". On October 19, 2010, he released \"Speakers Going Hammer\" on iTunes; it peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs.[40] Way backed out of the Summerbeatz tour in Australia in November 2010, where he was to have performed alongside Flo Rida, Jay Sean and Travie McCoy,[41] in order to embark on his \"Who They Want\" tour in support of his upcoming album. The DeAndre Way was released on November 30, 2010, and has so far[when?] sold only 70,000 copies, making it Way's lowest-selling album.\n\nIn 2011, Way released a series of mixtapes. The first, on January 22, was titled Smooky and had cartoon cover art of Way doing a 360 on a bicycle.[42] On March 17, Way released the mixtape 1UP which had cover art based on the Naruto anime, with Way stating: \"If I was in a video game, this mixtape would advance me to the next level with an extra life. Power up with the new offering.\"[43] On April 20, Way released his mixtape Juice with cover art based on the film of the same name. Way said he would also release a mini-movie of his own to go along with the mixtape, and that he was headed to greatness with the mixtape.[44] On July 15, Way released his EP mixtape titled Bernaurd Arnault EP (Limited Edition).[45] Then on August 1, Way released another ep mixtape titled 21: EP.[46] On August 31, Way released the mixtape The Last Crown, the cover of the mixtape is based on the artwork the Flammarion Engraving.[47][48] In September 2011, Way confirmed that he is working on a new album, Promise, which would be released in October.[49] Way also released the cover and title of his second independent album via Twitter, titled Skate Boy, with a notice that it would be available in stores on November 1.[50][51] On September 19, Way released the mixtape Supreme.[52] On October 30, Skate Boy (Deluxe Edition) was released as a mixtape, rather than an album.[53][54] On December 30, 2011, Way released another mixtape titled Gold On Deck.[55]\n\nIn 2012, Way released additional mixtapes while his album continued to be delayed. On January 9, Way released a mixtape for the beginning of the year, titled 50/13, with the cover based on that of ASAP Rocky's mixtape Live. Love. ASAP.[56] On January 24, Way released a collaboration mixtape with his artist Young L titled Mario & Domo vs. the World with cover art based on the video game Super Mario Bros.[57] On March 23, Way released a mixtape titled OBEY which featured the promotional single \"Too Faded\".[58][59][60] On June 3, 2012, Way talked about his upcoming album Promise and said he has released so many mixtapes in the last two years because he feels he has to put out a lot of music and be as creative as possible.[61] On June 11, Way released another collaboration mixtape with rapper Vinny Chase titled Double Cup City.[62] On September 4, Way released the sequel mixtape Juice II, in which Way returned to his old production style with the beginning lines \"Soulja Boy Tell 'Em\". It is Way's most-downloaded mixtape.[63] His mixtape titled Young & Flexin was released on November 6.[64] On December 25, 2012, Way released LOUD, which was his first mixtape distributed on iTunes.[65][66]\n\n2013 was marked by further album delays while Way's record deal expired, and he continued to release mixtapes. On February 22, Way released his first mixtape of the year, titled Foreign.[67] In March, it was rumored that Way was signing to Cash Money Records after getting a face tattoo saying \"Rich Gang\" the same weekend he was seen with his manager and Cash Money artists Birdman and Bow Wow.[68] This continued after he added \"Rich Gang\" or \"YMCMB\" to his social media platforms. Way had earlier reported that he was no longer with Interscope Records after his record deal ended in February.[69] Way also announced that his album Promise had been retitled USA DRE. On March 15, he released the first single from the album, titled \"Handsome\".[70][71] Following that, on March 25, he released the EP, All Black.[72] On April 24, Way released his mixtape Foreign 2.[73] Three days later, Way revealed the cover art to his next mixtape titled King Soulja which was released on May 5.[74] On May 26, Way released his second EP titled Cuban Link.[75][76] On June 13, Way announced another album title change, to Life After Fame, and that it would be released to stores on July 30, 2013.[77] On June 25, Way released his first single from the album titled \"Ridin Round\" to iTunes, but it was later dubbed a promotional single.[78][79] On June 30, Way released Life After Fame as a mixtape instead of an album.[80] On September 24, Way released his mixtape titled 23.[81][82] On November 30, Way released his mixtape The King.[83][84] On December 28, 2013, rapper/singer Drake collaborated and remixed Way's intro track \"We Made It\" from his mixtape The King.[85][86]\n\nIn 2014, Way continued work on his fourth studio album while collaborating with other artists and releasing additional mixtapes.

At some point, you have to get serious. But don't get it twisted, Soulja doesn't wanna be the next Lupe Fiasco. I don't want to be super-Lupe-Fiasco-lyrical and niggas don't know what the fuck I'm talking about,\" he added. \"I want to be the best,\" he continued. \"I want to be recognized in that category where I'm nominated for Best Rapper with Jay-Z and Kanye and Wayne. I wanna get a Grammy. I want Best Rap Album of the Year ... I've made millions of dollars off of doing my style, but, hey, I can rap, too.\n\nOn December 5, 2010, Way clarified this statement that Lupe Fiasco was too \"lyrical\", explaining that he wanted to keep the rudimentary music style he developed and justified why he doesn't keep a lyrically based flow and more substantially profound lyrical subject matter on every song.[164] According to Way:\n\n[XXL Magazine] didn't [publish] my whole statement. And basically, the interviewer dude, he was asking me why do I make lyrical songs like 'Only God Knows,' 'Born' ... 'The World So Cold,' and why do I make non-lyrical songs like 'Crank That' and 'Pretty Boy Swag'? And he was like, why don't I just be lyrical all the time? And I was telling him on [a] specific song, like 'Pretty Boy Swag,' I ain't wanna be all lyrical. I just wanted to be straight-up, and just be simple, [so] people can get what I'm saying 'cause it's a club song. But I wasn't saying as far as my whole music [output, with] all of my songs, that I don't wanna be rappin' like Lupe Fiasco.\n\nWay further clarified there was no animosity between him and Fiasco and that the two had planned to record a song together.[165]\n\nOther ventures\n\nStacks on Deck Entertainment\n\nWay founded his record label Stacks on Deck Entertainment (SODMG) in 2004 while he was signed to Interscope and Collipark Music.

In 2009, it was reported that Way would be producing for Kanye West's fourth studio album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Kanye would be producing for Way's third studio album, The DeAndre Way, but for unknown reasons neither of them used each other's beats.[178] On May 13, 2011, Way said he had produced and submitted beats for 50 Cent's fifth studio album, Street King Immortal.[179] In 2013, Way also produced on the track \"Wowzers\" of Lil Wayne's album I Am Not a Human Being II.

Supply\"; the store is located in Los Angeles, California.\n\nActing career\n\nOn January 7, 2009, Soulja Boy announced that he was to be releasing his own cartoon, Soulja Boy: The Animated Series, but only one episode was released.[189][190]\n\nIn August 2010, Soulja Boy announced a desire to make a film about himself, having told MTV News that he discussed the idea with Nick Cannon.[191] He was later approached by Peter Spirer, who presented his own concept for a documentary about the artist.[192] Directed by Spirer, Soulja Boy: The Movie was released direct-to-video on October 18, 2011, a date that coincided with Soulja Boy's arrest on a drug charge.[192][193][194] The film contains live performances from his DeAndre Way Tour and interviews with his father and current and former members of Stacks on Deck Entertainment.[192] The documentary's visual quality was panned by DVD Verdict as a result of poor video transfer, since much of its music detail was taken from YouTube clips.[195]\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Way announced that he would make his acting debut playing the main role of Bishop in the Juice remake and that it would air on BET.[196]\n\nIn 2013, Way announced and confirmed that he was guest-starring in the upcoming movie Officer Down.[197] On November 12, 2021, he announced upcoming roles on ATL and an upcoming movie role with Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nWorld Poker Fund Holdings\n\nIn May 2016, Soulja Boy signed a deal from World Poker Fund Holdings for five years.[198] World Poker Fund is a builder and operator of online and event-based social gaming platforms and imprints.[198] Soulja said of the deal: \"I enjoy music, and of course gaming. Being an influencer is a form of currency.\"[198] Way initially tweeted that the deal was for $400 million; however, that is the cap for the contract and not his payment from the company.[198]\n\nIn December 2018, Soulja Boy patented a video game console called the SouljaGame.[199] It drew criticism for being an \"overpriced\" emulator of Nintendo and Sega handheld games.[200][201] On December 15, 2018, he announced the release of two more consoles: the Retro SouljaBoy Mini, which resembles a Nintendo Game Boy, and the SouljaGame Fuze, which looks similar to Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.[202] As of December 30, 2018, Soulja Boy has pulled the SouljaGame consoles off his store amid threats of a lawsuit from Nintendo.[203] The SouljaGame website was seized by Nintendo and now leads to Nintendo's website. On January 12, 2019, Soulja Boy released another handheld on his SouljaWatch website called the SouljaGame Handheld; this console looks similar in appearance to Sony's PlayStation Vita.[204]\n\nPersonal life\n\nFamily\n\nOn the night of March 22, 2011, Way's younger brother, Deion Jenkins, was killed in a car crash.[205] On September 30, 2022, Way's girlfriend Jackie gave birth to their first child, a son.[206]\n\nDomestic violence case\n\nRecent court proceedings have led to significant legal and financial consequences for rapper Soulja Boy, born DeAndre Cortez Way. Following a lawsuit filed by ex-girlfriend Kayla Myers, which alleged kidnapping and assault at his Malibu home in February 2019, a judge ordered in April that Soulja Boy pay $471,800, including punitive damages. The order, authorized the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to seize various personal items from his Bell Canyon home. This includes luxury vehicles like a yellow Bentley, a red Lamborghini, a yellow Mercedes-Benz, and other valuables such as a diamond-studded neck chain with his stage name, jewelry, and any cash found, often kept in backpacks. These developments are part of a pattern of allegations against the rapper; in 2021, model Nia Riley accused him of assault during their relationship, including an incident where she was allegedly kicked in the stomach while pregnant, leading to a miscarriage.[207]\n\nRobbery\n\nOn December 30, 2008, Way was robbed and battered in his home. Initial reports indicated that the robbers were six masked men with AK-47s and pistols; however, on December 31, 2008, videos surfaced on the Internet of two masked men claiming sole credit for the crime.[208]\n\nWay described the incident to MTV News a month later: he had come home very late at night after attending an album release party and was recording songs with friends when the robbers came in pointing their guns.[209] On January 26, 2009, during another interview, Way said it was three robbers, not six: \"I got back to my house at around 3 in the morning and I was in the studio recording. So two of my homeboys was in the living room and me and Arab we was in the studio recording. And somebody kicked in the door. One dude ran in put the AK to my homeboy head, put him on the floor [...] The other two ran in my homeboy jumped in the other room, so the other two dudes ran back so I peeped in the door and they running through my house with Ks and pistols so I ducked back. I really can't dwell on what happened after that, but it was a messed-up situation and I'm glad everyone made it out alive.\"[210]\n\nLegal issues\n\nSee also: Cryptocurrency bubble and Cryptocurrency and crime\n\nOn December 9, 2007, Way was sued by William Lyons (a.k.a. Souljah Boy of Mo Thugs Family), who created the stage name Souljah Boy in 1996.[211] On October 7, 2009, Way was arrested in Atlanta, Georgia, on one count of obstruction, a misdemeanor, for running from police when he'd been ordered to stop while filming a video in an abandoned house. The rapper was released on a $550 bond.[212]\n\nIn May 2011, Way and his labels were sued by a local Pennsylvania promoter for failing to make promised payments in connection with a rescheduled concert.[213] On October 18, 2011, Way was traveling west on I-20 in Carroll County, Georgia, with four other men when their vehicle was pulled over for a vehicle equipment violation. The police officer who made the stop searched the vehicle and found more than five ounces (140 g) of marijuana. Way was arrested and released on bond the same day.[214]\n\nOn January 22, 2014, Way was a passenger in his vehicle when the driver ran a stop sign in the San Fernando Valley, California, and police discovered a loaded handgun in the car. Way was arrested immediately and taken to jail.[215] His manager claimed that a neighbor had left the gun under the seat and that Way was unaware it was there. Way admitted to owning only the vehicle, not the weapon.[216] He was convicted and sentenced to two years' probation.[217] On February 15, 2014, Way announced on Twitter that he was going to jail in five days. He did not give a reason. He ultimately never turned himself in to authorities and the details of his charges are unknown.[218]\n\nIn October 2016, Way was sued by the musician Skrill Dilly for allegedly making death threats to him in a video filmed by the rapper.[219] The same year, he received additional probation time after police found weapons at his home.[217][220] On March 15, 2019, Way was arrested for violating his probation, and on April 30, he was sentenced to 8 months in prison, with credit for time served.[157][217][220]\n\nOn January 21, 2021, Way was sued by an unnamed former personal assistant of his who alleged that he locked her in a room, physically and verbally abused her, and repeatedly raped her. Way denied the allegations, with a spokesperson saying: \"Soulja would never put his hands on a female. He wouldn't beat a woman or put his hands on a woman … this is nonsense.\"[221][222]\n\nOn February 18, 2022, in a class-action lawsuit filed against the cryptocurrency company SafeMoon that alleged the company is a pump-and-dump scheme, Way was named as a defendant along with professional boxer Jake Paul, musician Nick Carter, rapper Lil Yachty, and social media personality Ben Phillips, for promoting the SafeMoon token on their social media accounts with misleading information.[223][224] On the same day, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[225]\n\nLegacy\n\nWay is known for having the first single to sell over three million digital copies, his debut single \"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\".[226]\n\nWay has garnered popularity through the use of social media. Since 2006, his YouTube channel has accumulated 1.9 billion views and more than 3.3 million subscribers.[227] Way was one of the first rappers to capitalize on social media for marketing at the beginning of his career.[228][229]\n\nControversies\n\nWay's music has been banned from some school dances[which?] for alleged sexual or violent content and/or innuendos.[citation needed] In the original YouTube video for \"Shootout\", Way demonstrates his dance while holding a handgun in each hand and pretending to shoot into the audience.[230]\n\nIce-T\n\nIn June 2008, on DJ Cisco's Urban Legend mixtape, Ice-T told Way to \"eat a dick\" and criticized Way for \"killing hip-hop\" and his song \"Crank That\" for being \"garbage\" compared to the works of other hip-hop artists such as Rakim, Das EFX, Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube.[231] The two then traded videos back and forth over the Internet.[232] Rapper Kanye West defended Way by arguing that he had created a new, original hip-hop work, thus keeping the authentic meaning of the music.[233] The feud was parodied in a 2010 episode of The Boondocks.\n\nIn May 2011, Way's feud with Ice-T somewhat reignited over the film Juice. Way said he would release a movie of his own to go along with his mixtape of the same name, following a statement during Ice-T's interview with Shade 45 in late April 2011. Ice-T said that Way's role as Bishop, which was famously originated by rapper Tupac Shakur, was not an issue. But Ice-T found it problematic that the film was being remade, saying \"What? But that's Pac ... At some point, somebody gotta stop it. I came out. I made some statements. Man, I don't know. Do you, dude, do you. If the masses accept it, it shows you the state we're in ... Come on man, you think I'd try to remake Pac's movie? Good luck though, I'm not a hater ... eh.\" Way barraged Ice-T with retaliatory tweets on the same day, saying someone should \"get this guy a hairline.\"[234][235]\n\nCharles Hamilton\n\nOn December 9, 2008, Charles Hamilton said in an interview that Way was making it more difficult for new artists to be signed.[236] Way responded, \"X out the Sonic and fuck with Mario, you might want to got damn eat a mushroom\" (Hamilton is a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, dedicating a whole mixtape depicting himself as the titular character).[237][238][further explanation needed] Hamilton responded with a diss song, \"I'm You Last Year With Talent\",[239] followed by another, \"Word Aight\".[240]\n\nBow Wow\n\nOn February 2, 2009, Way challenged Bow Wow to a race in their Lamborghinis and claimed Bow Wow's Lamborghini was a rental.[241] On February 4, Bow Wow proved that he owned his Lamborghini and said \"its halloween in Bankhead for you everyday nigga ... you scared ... you all nervous and shit\". Way responded on Twitter by saying \"HE FUCKED UP!!!! IM BOUT TO SHITTTT ON THIS NIGGA!! LOL!!!!!\"[242] On February 7, both artists sent diss songs to each other, such as Way's \"Fuck Bow Wow\" and Bow Wow's \"What I Think About You\".[243] Later that day during a phone conversation both rappers settled their differences.[244] In 2016, they released a joint mixtape titled Ignorant Shit.[245]\n\nU.S. Armed Forces\n\nIn September 2011, Way released the song \"Let's Be Real\". One of the lines of the song is: \"Fuck the FBI and fuck all the army troops / Fighting for what? Bitch, be your own man / I'll be flying through the clouds with green like I'm Peter Pan.\"[246] After the song was released, Way was criticized by military members and their families, especially in regard to the timing in relation to the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.[247][248][249] Way apologized, \"When I expressed my frustration with the U.S. Army, not only did my words come out wrong, I was wrong to even speak them.\" He added, \"So, I write this to give my sincerest apology to all members of the United States military services, as well as their families that were offended by my most recent lyrics.\"[246] Representatives for Way indicated that the song had been pulled from his upcoming album, Promise, and would not be available for sale. They were also attempting to remove the video from the internet.[250]\n\nOn September 6, 2011, TMZ reported that Way's album would not be sold at the 3,100 Army and Air Force base exchanges if it included the song \"Let's Be Real\".[251]\n\nHopsin\n\nOn August 25, 2012, Way made controversial comments towards fellow rapper Hopsin on one of his webcam chats with his fans, when Way stated \"fuck Hopsin, I'm about to go in the studio and record this Hopsin diss real quick\". Way continued on by stating the words \"that nigga's a bitch, fuck that bitch-ass nigga\".[252] The situation was caused by Hopsin's controversial song \"Sag My Pants\" which was a direct diss towards Way with the lines \"Soulja Boy you got a corny flow, So you can suck my fucking dick through a glory hole\" though Way previously didn't focus on the diss.[253] On August 28, 2012, on Way's Tinychat, Hopsin and Way confronted each other: though Hopsin admitted he liked Way, nothing was really resolved.[254] On September 3, 2012, Way released a Hopsin diss titled \"That Nigga Not Me\". Hopsin stated the song was horrible, but did not respond with a diss track of his own.[255][256]\n\nChief Keef and Ballout\n\nOn April 19, 2013, Way sent a number of death threats to Chicago rapper Chief Keef via Facebook. The threats were likely provoked by an earlier incident, where Keef's affiliate Ballout stole Way's chain and bragged about it on Twitter. Way posted both Keef's cellphone numbers, urging people to notify him he's coming for him with a gun. He continued posting, stating he's in Keef's hometown of Chicago and asking Keef and Ballout to come to him. Chief Keef responded that he is currently in London but would talk to Way on his new number. Later the same day, Way issued a statement that his Facebook, Instagram and email were hacked and none of the earlier messages were written by him.[257][258] On June 1, 2014, Way revealed on his Instagram that he and fellow artist Chief Keef had resolved their differences. Little is known as to whether Way has settled his differences with Ballout.[259]\n\nChris Brown\n\nOn January 3, 2017, Way was entangled in a debacle with singer Chris Brown. The feud started after Way intimidated Brown's former girlfriend, model Karrueche Tran, when Way liked a photo that involved her.[260] The two began to exchange Instagram videos toward each other in a matter of minutes. Brown accused Way of \"snitching\" and Way poked fun at Brown's daughter and his infamous incident with singer Rihanna in 2009.[261] The next day, Way apologized to Brown and fans and said he wished to collaborate with Brown.[262][263]\n\nTyga\n\nIn early 2019, Soulja Boy drew attention for claiming he had the biggest comeback of 2018 over fellow rapper Tyga on the radio show The Breakfast Club, which started a series of exchanges between the two.[264] The feud eventually resulted in the two trading diss tracks back and forth over the instrumental from Blueface's song, \"Thotiana\".[265]\n\nJake Paul\n\nLater the same year, YouTube celebrity Jake Paul published a tweet directed at Way, saying \"i wanna box @souljaboy\",[266] to which Way responded, \"boy I'll knock you out\".[267] The feud was started by Paul in reference to his participation as an undercard in the Logan Paul vs. KSI boxing fight. The two eventually confronted each other in person when Paul drove to Way's house to confirm they would have an official boxing match, which Paul had said he would bet $20 million on.[268] Paul posted a video on YouTube the same day saying his status in the rematch between Logan Paul and KSI was undecided, leaving the status of the fight between him and Way in question.[269]\n\nAtari\n\nOn August 18, 2021, Way claimed during an Instagram Live stream that he had gained ownership of the video game company Atari—\"I am now the owner of Atari. I own the video game company Atari\"–and said he had been given control of the company after it had been impressed with his SouljaGame console. The next day, Atari's Twitter account made a post indirectly referencing and refuting Way's claim of ownership: \"We know that CEO of Atari is a dream job, but that honor belongs to Wade Rosen.\"[270][271] In a video responding to the tweet, Way showed a contract that promised him Atari tokens, Atari's cryptocurrency.[272][273]\n\nBlueface\n\nIn December 2023 and January 2024, Way feuded with California rapper Blueface, after Blueface asserted on a podcast that he could win a hypothetical Verzuz freestyle battle against Way. During the feud, Way proposed that he and Blueface \"meet up and die\".[274] Way announced the end of the feud on a January 20, 2024 Instagram Live stream, citing their mutual threats to harm each other in prison as proof that the situation escalated too far.[275]\n\nMetro Boomin\n\nOn May 12, 2024, Way sent condemnatory tweets directed at the American producer Metro Boomin in response to a ridiculing 2012 tweet, mocking his mother who died in a murder–suicide. After much public backlash, Way apologized and deleted the tweets three days later.[276] Soon after the apology, he condemned fellow rappers 21 Savage and Meek Mill's support of Metro Boomin in the controversy.[277][278]\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Soulja Boy discography\n\nStudio albums\n\nSouljaboytellem.com (2007)\n\niSouljaBoyTellem (2008)\n\nThe DeAndre Way (2010)\n\nKing Soulja 3 (2014)\n\nLoyalty (2015)\n\nBest to Ever Do It (2018)\n\nYoung Draco (2018)\n\nBig Draco (2021)\n\nBig Draco 2 (2021)[279]\n\nBig Draco 3 (2022)[280]\n\nTours\n\nAmerica's Most Wanted Tour (2009)\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm Year Film Role Notes 2007 YouTube Live Himself Small Role 2008 What's at Stake?
