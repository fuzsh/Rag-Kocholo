        "text": "Total Public Debt Outstanding Disclaimer\n\nThere are six datasets on Fiscal Data which include the national debt, which is referred to as Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO). TPDO is the sum of Debt Held by the Public and Intragovernmental (Intragov) Holdings. Some datasets include debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB). The datasets listed below only include debt issued by the Treasury Department. The list below provides information on where there are differences in debt calculations related to the national debt.\n\nDebt to the Penny contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB.\n\nHistorical Debt Outstanding contains TPDO, but no breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, TPDO includes debt issued by the FFB.\n\nDaily Treasury Statement (DTS) contains Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings, but does not aggregate these two categories into TPDO. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values for Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset. Please note that the published reports on the Fiscal Service site contain TPDO values.\n\nMonthly Treasury Statement (MTS) contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB.\n\nMonthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD) contains TPDO, as well as a breakout of Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings includes debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset.\n\nSchedules of Federal Debt contains Debt Held by the Public and Intragov Holdings, but does not aggregate these two categories into TPDO. In this dataset, Intragov Holdings do not include debt issued by the FFB. Dollar values are rounded in millions to cohere with other data in the dataset.\n\nEnd Total Public Debt Outstanding Disclaimer\n\nDebt broken out by intragovernmental holdings and debt held by the public has not always been provided. Where this occurred, the dataset shows a value of $0.00 instead of a null value. Debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings data is available yearly (on a fiscal basis) from 9/30/1997 through 9/30/2001, monthly from 9/30/2001 through 3/31/2005, and daily from 4/4/2005 to today. Some columns in this dataset overlap with the Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD), Monthly Treasury Statement (MTS), Daily Treasury Statement (DTS), and Schedules of Federal Debt datasets. Debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank (FFB) is included in the intragovernmental holdings in the Debt to the Penny dataset, but not in the Schedules of Federal Debt dataset because it is not debt managed by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The difference between these datasets is equal to the amount of debt issued by the FFB.\n\nDownloaded CSV files with values greater than $10 trillion may have the final two digits (cents) excluded due to digit limits enforced by the application used to access the file. The JSON and XML file downloads are not impacted by this limitation.\n\nTotal Public Debt Outstanding = Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings\n\nPlease note that Total Public Debt Outstanding may be calculated differently within different datasets. See those datasets Notes & Known Limitations section for calculation details."
