        "text": "Holy crap! It seems like only yesterday When Everybody Loves Raymond premiered on Sept. 13, 1996, introducing audiences to Ray Barone (Ray Romano) and his dysfunctional family.\n\nAiring for nine seasons from 1996 to 2005, CBS' live-studio sitcom starred comedian Romano as the titular character, an Italian sports columnist living in Long Island with his wife (Patricia Heaton), three kids and meddlesome parents right across the street. The show went on to win 15 Emmy Awards, including two for outstanding comedy series and several for acting.\n\nAlthough fans have missed the Barones' weekly antics, the show lives on with all 210 episodes available to stream on Peacock and Paramount+ — a binge undertaken by Romano in April 2024, who watched and rated all the episodes for the first time since the series finale in 2005.\n\n\"I got on a little kick there. I hadn't seen the episodes,\" the actor told PEOPLE. \"They took on a new look to me. I was appreciating them more. I was very hard on them back then … But you see when you're removed from it a little, I felt like an audience member. And then I said, 'Let me rate them.' I rated them, and I was hard on some.\"\n\nWhether you're a newbie to the series or a longtime fan interested in catching up with the stars who brought the Barone family to life on-screen, here's what the Everybody Loves Raymond cast is up to now.\n\n01 of 08\n\nRay Romano as Raymond Barone\n\nRomano — in the role of sportswriter Raymond Barone — kept the laughs coming through interactions with his overbearing parents and put-upon wife, Debra (Heaton). The role earned him one Emmy and a handful of nominations, however, he's admitted that not every episode was award-worthy.\n\n\"When you do 210 episodes, you're going to have episodes that you think are brilliant and you're going to have episodes that you think, 'Wow, you know what? We kind of missed it on that one,\" Romano told PEOPLE of his Everybody Loves Raymond rewatch. \"Then you're going to have episodes that are very good, great, and somewhere in the middle, you know what I mean? That's just to be expected when you're cranking an episode out every week.\"\n\nFollowing Romano's run on the hit show, the Queens-born actor remained a fixture on TV, appearing on Men of a Certain Age, Parenthood, Vinyl, Get Shorty, Made for Love and Bupkis. He's set to star alongside Lisa Kudrow, Linda Cardellini, Luke Wilson and more on the Netflix comedy series No Good Deed, slated for a 2025 release.\n\nRomano also voiced Manny in the Ice Age film series and appeared in The Big Sick (2017) and Martin Scorsese's The Irishman (2019). Before his appearance in Greg Berlanti's 2024 film Fly Me to the Moon, he wrote, directed and starred in 2022's Somewhere in Queens, opposite Laurie Metcalf.\n\nHe shares four children — Alexandra, Matthew, Gregory and Joseph — with wife Anna Romano (née Scarpulla).\n\n02 of 08\n\nPatricia Heaton as Debra Barone\n\nHeaton played Debra on the sitcom, a hard-working mom who just couldn't see eye to eye with her in-laws, though she had a soft spot for her brother-in-law, Robert (Brad Garrett). She won back-to-back Emmys for her performance in 2000 and 2001.\n\nAfter Raymond's end, Heaton joined actor Kelsey Grammer on Fox's Back to You before finding a new home on the small screen as an overworked mom on ABC's The Middle, then as a mom pursuing medical school on CBS' Carol's Second Act, which inspired the title of her 2020 book, Your Second Act: Inspiring Stories of Reinvention.\n\nSince 1990, Heaton has been married to British actor David Hunt, with whom she has four sons.\n\n03 of 08\n\nBrad Garrett as Robert Barone\n\nAs Raymond's slightly less beloved big brother Robbie, a New York City cop, Garrett earned lots of laughs with his \"woe is me\" attitude and comebacks to his mom and dad, with whom he lived for much of the series. Like his costars, Garrett scored several Emmy nominations and took home three trophies — as well as a green dial telephone he snagged from the set.\n\n\"I wanted to steal [the phone], and they were like, 'What are you doing?' And I'm like, 'Nothing.' It was really lame,\" he told PEOPLE in June 2023. \"They said, 'Would you like that phone?' And Rhonda, who was the head of props, gave it to me, and so I treasure it.\"\n\nFollowing Raymond, he appeared on 'Til Death and other series, including Single Parents, High Desert and Not Dead Yet. He's done a fair amount of voice work for Disney, too, though he's also known for his stand-up.\n\nAfter finalizing his divorce from his first wife, Jill Diven — with whom he shares two kids, Maxwell and Hope — Garrett wed actress IsaBeall Quella in November 2021.\n\n04 of 08\n\nMonica Horan as Amy MacDougall\n\nMonica Horan joined the cast slightly later as Robbie's girlfriend (and later, wife) Amy MacDougall. Like sister-in-law Debra, Amy couldn't win with her future in-laws, sparking a bond between the two over the sheer absurdity of the Barones.\n\nFollowing the show's end in 2005, she appeared on Enlightened, The Bold and the Beautiful, The Middle and Better Things.\n\nHoran is married to Raymond creator Philip Rosenthal; together, they have two sons.\n\n05 of 08\n\nPeter Boyle as Frank Barone\n\nPeter Boyle had quite the career in the years before Raymond, appearing in Joe (1970), The Candidate (1972), Young Frankenstein (1974) and Taxi Driver (1976), as well as on and off-Broadway.\n\nThough he never won an Emmy for his work as the patriarch on Raymond, fans adored him in the role of Ray and Robbie's deadpan, slightly cranky dad, Frank. However, off-screen, he was nothing like his character, as Romano told PEOPLE, \"He made me feel welcome. He made me feel part of the club.\"\n\nShortly after Raymond wrapped, Boyle died of multiple myeloma and heart disease in 2006 at age 71.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Loraine Alterman, and their two daughters.\n\n06 of 08\n\nDoris Roberts as Marie Barone\n\nAs the overbearing Barone family matriarch, Doris Roberts was the queen of LOLs, doting on her sons, berating her two daughters-in-law and bickering with her husband.\n\nRoberts earned four Emmys for her work on the series and, like Boyle, had a long list of credits prior to Raymond, including the shows Angie and Remington Steele.\n\nBefore she died at age 90 in 2016, Roberts kept working, reuniting with Heaton for a few episodes of The Middle and bringing laughs in 2006's Grandma's Boy.\n\nRoberts was twice married and had one son, Michael Cannata Jr.\n\n07 of 08\n\nSawyer and Sullivan Sweeten as Geoffrey and Michael Barone\n\nTwin brothers Sawyer and Sullivan Sweeten — along with older sister Madylin Sweeten — starred as Barone children Geoffrey, Michael and Ally, respectively. The boys were cast on the series when they were just 16 months old and were featured on 142 episodes (the series ran for 210).\n\nWhen the show ended, the brothers chose to remain out of the spotlight until Sawyer died by suicide in 2015. He was 19.\n\n\"Sawyer was more than just a brother,\" Madylin told PEOPLE following her brother's death. \"He was a strong and selfless friend. When confiding in one another, Sawyer always had the kindest words of encouragement. He will live on in my head and those shared moments forever.\"\n\nIn 2019, the Sweeten family restored two old theaters and dedicated them in Sawyer's name.\n\n08 of 08\n\nMadylin Sweeten as Ally Barone\n\nLike her brothers, Madylin played one of the Barone children, appearing on 206 episodes. She has worked steadily since the show ended, popping up on TV shows like Grey's Anatomy and Lucifer.\n\nAs revealed on her Instagram, Madylin is married to Sean Durrie, whom she started dating in 2014, according to a post she shared of the couple."
