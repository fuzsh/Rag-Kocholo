        "text": "Consider choosing a test date at least two months ahead of the application deadlines of all the colleges and scholarship agencies you might want to apply to.\n\nMultiple-choice scores are normally reported within 2–8 weeks after the test date. If you take the ACT with writing, scores will be reported only after all of your scores are available, including writing, normally within 5–8 weeks after the test date.\n\nYou may not receive scores from more than one test date during a scheduled national (Saturday, non-Saturday, or rescheduled test date arranged by ACT). If you are admitted and allowed to test a second time, we will report only the scores from the first test. The second or third set of scores will be cancelled without refund.\n\nYou may not receive scores from more than one test date per state administration (initial or makeup) if your school participates in ACT State and District Testing. If you are allowed to test more than once, we will report only the scores from the first test. The second set of scores will be cancelled.\n\nAfter you register for a test event, you will be able to make changes to your record. For a small fee, you can make a test center change and a test date change (if changes are made at the same time).\n\nTest Center Change for the same test date - If a seat and materials are available for your test option at your new preferred test center on your preferred test date, you will be able to make a test center change. You cannot request a test center change after the late registration deadline. Instead, find out about requesting standby testing.\n\nTest Date Change - A test date change can be used to sign up for a different test date if you are absent or unable to test on the original test date or if your registration is cancelled for failure to meet ACT's test security requirements.\n\nNote: If you paid with an ACT Fee Waiver, the waiver will be reapplied to your new test date, but covers only the test fee or late fee for your test option, you must still pay the change fee.\n\nTest Option Change – Before the late registration deadline, you can add the writing option or change between paper and online testing, if a seat is available.\n\nIf you miss the test for any reason, including illness, injury, being denied admission at the test center for lack of ID, or late arrival, your options are listed below.\n\nIMPORTANT: Once you break the seal on your test booklet, you cannot later request a test date change, even if you do not complete all your tests. You must register again and pay the full fee for your test option if you want to retest.\n\nRequest and pay for a test date change\n\nLog in to your MyACT account and select \"Make Changes to Your Registration\" or call ACT Registration at 319.337.1270 by the regular deadline for the new test date. You will be charged the full fee for the new test date in addition to the test date change fee.\n\nIf you call during the late registration period, you will also be charged a late fee. In either case, your basic fee for the original test date will be refunded. (If you register for a new test date instead of making a test date change, your basic fee for the original test date will not be refunded.)\n\nIf you decide you do not want to test on another test date, your registration fee and any additional fees (such as late fee or test center change fee) are nonrefundable. If you do not test, no score reports will be sent."
