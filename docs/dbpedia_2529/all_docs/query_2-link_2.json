        "text": "The MLA Handbook highlights principles over prescriptive practices. Essentially, a writer will need to take note of primary elements in every source, such as author, title, etc. and then assort them in a general format. Thus, by using this methodology, a writer will be able to cite any source regardless of whether it’s included in this list.\n\nHowever, this guide will highlight a few concerns when citing digital sources in MLA style.\n\nBest Practices for Managing Online Sources\n\nBecause online information can change or disappear, it is always a good idea to keep personal copies of important electronic information whenever possible. Downloading or even printing key documents ensures you have a stable backup. You can also use the Bookmark function in your web browser in order to build an easy-to-access reference for all of your project's sources (though this will not help you if the information is changed or deleted).\n\nIt is also wise to keep a record of when you first consult with each online source. MLA uses the phrase, “Accessed” to denote which date you accessed the web page when available or necessary. It is not required to do so, but it is encouraged (especially when there is no copyright date listed on a website).\n\nImportant Note on the Use of URLs in MLA\n\nInclude a URL or web address to help readers locate your sources. Because web addresses are not static (i.e., they change often) and because documents sometimes appear in multiple places on the web (e.g., on multiple databases), MLA encourages the use of citing containers such as Youtube, JSTOR, Spotify, or Netflix in order to easily access and verify sources. However, MLA only requires the www. address, so eliminate all https:// when citing URLs.\n\nMany scholarly journal articles found in databases include a DOI (digital object identifier). If a DOI is available, cite the DOI number instead of the URL.\n\nOnline newspapers and magazines sometimes include a “permalink,” which is a shortened, stable version of a URL. Look for a “share” or “cite this” button to see if a source includes a permalink. If you can find a permalink, use that instead of a URL.\n\nAbbreviations Commonly Used with Electronic Sources\n\nIf page numbers are not available, use par. or pars. to denote paragraph numbers. Use these in place of the p. or pp. abbreviation. Par. would be used for a single paragraph, while pars. would be used for a span of two or more paragraphs.\n\nBasic Style for Citations of Electronic Sources (Including Online Databases)\n\nHere are some common features you should try to find before citing electronic sources in MLA style. Not every web page will provide all of the following information. However, collect as much of the following information as possible:\n\nAuthor and/or editor names (if available); last names first.\n\n\"Article name in quotation marks.\"\n\nTitle of the website, project, or book in italics.\n\nAny version numbers available, including editions (ed.), revisions, posting dates, volumes (vol.), or issue numbers (no.).\n\nPublisher information, including the publisher name and publishing date.\n\nTake note of any page numbers (p. or pp.) or paragraph numbers (par. or pars.).\n\nDOI (if available, precede it with \"https://doi.org/\"), otherwise a URL (without the https://) or permalink.\n\nDate you accessed the material (Date Accessed). While not required, saving this information it is highly recommended, especially when dealing with pages that change frequently or do not have a visible copyright date.\n\nUse the following format:\n\nCiting an Entire Web Site\n\nWhen citing an entire website, follow the same format as listed above, but include a compiler name if no single author is available.\n\nAuthor, or compiler name (if available). Name of Site. Version number (if available), Name of institution/organization affiliated with the site (sponsor or publisher), date of resource creation (if available), DOI (preferred), otherwise include a URL or permalink. Date of access (if applicable).\n\nEditor, author, or compiler name (if available). Name of Site. Version number, Name of institution/organization affiliated with the site (sponsor or publisher), date of resource creation (if available), URL, DOI or permalink. Date of access (if applicable).\n\nThe Purdue OWL Family of Sites. The Writing Lab and OWL at Purdue and Purdue U, 2008, owl.english.purdue.edu/owl. Accessed 23 Apr. 2008.\n\nFelluga, Dino. Guide to Literary and Critical Theory. Purdue U, 28 Nov. 2003, www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/. Accessed 10 May 2006.\n\nCourse or Department Websites\n\nGive the instructor name. Then list the title of the course (or the school catalog designation for the course) in italics. Give appropriate department and school names as well, following the course title.\n\nFelluga, Dino. Survey of the Literature of England. Purdue U, Aug. 2006, web.ics.purdue.edu/~felluga/241/241/Home.html. Accessed 31 May 2007.\n\nEnglish Department. Purdue U, 20 Apr. 2009, www.cla.purdue.edu/english/. Accessed 31 May 2015.\n\nA Page on a Web Site\n\nFor an individual page on a Web site, list the author or alias if known, followed by an indication of the specific page or article being referenced. Usually, the title of the page or article appears in a header at the top of the page. Follow this with the information covered above for entire Web sites. If the publisher is the same as the website name, only list it once.\n\nLundman, Susan. “How to Make Vegetarian Chili.” eHow, www.ehow.com/how_10727_make-vegetarian-chili.html. Accessed 6 July 2015.\n\n“Athlete's Foot - Topic Overview.” WebMD, 25 Sept. 2014, www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/tc/athletes-foot-topic-overview.\n\nAn E-Book\n\nCitations for e-books closely resemble those for physical books. Simply indicate that the book in question is an e-book by putting the term \"e-book\" in the \"version\" slot of the MLA template (i.e., after the author, the title of the source, the title of the container, and the names of any other contributors).\n\nSilva, Paul J. How to Write a Lot: A Practical Guide to Productive Academic Writing. E-book, American Psychological Association, 2007.\n\nIf the e-book is formatted for a specific reader device or service, you can indicate this by treating this information the same way you would treat a physical book's edition number. Often, this will mean replacing \"e-book\" with \"[App/Service] ed.\"\n\nMachiavelli, Niccolo. The Prince, translated by W. K. Marriott, Kindle ed., Library of Alexandria, 2018.\n\nNote: The MLA considers the term \"e-book\" to refer to publications formatted specifically for reading with an e-book reader device (e.g., a Kindle) or a corresponding web application. These e-books will not have URLs or DOIs. If you are citing book content from an ordinary webpage with a URL, use the \"A Page on a Web Site\" format above.\n\nAn Image (Including a Painting, Sculpture, or Photograph)\n\nProvide the artist's name, the work of art italicized, the date of creation, the institution and city where the work is housed. Follow this initial entry with the name of the Website in italics, and the date of access.\n\nGoya, Francisco. The Family of Charles IV. 1800. Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid.

Accessed May 2006.\n\nIf the work cited is available on the web only, then provide the name of the artist, the title of the work, and then follow the citation format for a website. If the work is posted via a username, use that username for the author.\n\nAdams, Clifton R. “People Relax Beside a Swimming Pool at a Country Estate Near Phoenix, Arizona, 1928.” Found, National Geographic Creative, 2 June 2016, natgeofound.tumblr.com/.\n\nAn Article in a Web Magazine\n\nProvide the author name, article name in quotation marks, title of the web magazine in italics, publisher name, publication date, URL, and the date of access.\n\nBernstein, Mark. “10 Tips on Writing the Living Web.” A List Apart: For People Who Make Websites, 16 Aug. 2002, alistapart.com/article/writeliving.

Include a DOI if available, otherwise provide a URL or permalink to help readers locate the source.\n\nArticle in an Online-only Scholarly Journal\n\nMLA requires a page range for articles that appear in Scholarly Journals. If the journal you are citing appears exclusively in an online format (i.e. there is no corresponding print publication) that does not make use of page numbers, indicate the URL or other location information.\n\nDolby, Nadine. “Research in Youth Culture and Policy: Current Conditions and Future Directions.” Social Work and Society: The International Online-Only Journal, vol. 6, no. 2, 2008, www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/60/362.

Accessed 8 Feb. 2009.\n\nAn Article from an Online Database (or Other Electronic Subscription Service)\n\nCite online databases (e.g. LexisNexis, ProQuest, JSTOR, ScienceDirect) and other subscription services as containers. Thus, provide the title of the database italicized before the DOI or URL. If a DOI is not provided, use the URL instead. Provide the date of access if you wish.\n\nAlonso, Alvaro, and Julio A.
