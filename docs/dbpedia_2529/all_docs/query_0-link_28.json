        "text": "Mornings at my house always begin identically. My alarm goes off at 6:30am, I do my best to tiptoe out without waking anyone, and then I start work. But last Thursday was different. Last Thursday, my wife woke me up at 5am to inform me that she was deep in the throes of a debilitating migraine and it was all she could do not to vomit everywhere. And then she vomited everywhere.\n\nShe’s had these migraines before. They’re full-day affairs, and she spends them either throwing up or crying herself to sleep as gently as possible so as not to exacerbate the sensation that her skull is exploding. But Thursday’s migraine was her first since our son was born. And, with her laid up, this meant that I would have to be Parent Number One for the day. I’d have to wriggle out of work and devote my time to looking after the boy. In short, I’d get to see what life has been like for my wife these past few months.\n\nIt started well. In fact, by midday, I was convinced that she had it easy. I got to play with my son – neatly assuaging all the guilt I have about working too much – while catching up on podcasts and watching a film, then doing some laundry and cooking that evening’s dinner, all with him strapped to my front. It was productivity on such a blistering scale that it would make Frederick Winslow Taylor weep. This is what my wife did, while I was toiling away for pennies? It hardly seemed fair.\n\nBut then, in the afternoon, out of absolutely nowhere, time suddenly screeched to a halt. It was just me and him until bedtime, and bedtime was a million years away. What was I supposed to do? We stuck our tongues out at each other until we both got bored. We played with a set of plastic keys, but that got old just as quickly. Tummy time came and went, as did the new game I invented where I make a whistling noise and then bop him on the nose with my thumb. Copious unnecessary selfies were taken. After all this, I checked the clock. It was still only 2pm. I was outraged.\n\nFrom that point, the structure of the day fell apart totally. It became a paragraph without punctuation, an infinite game of Buckaroo! where the sole objective was to keep my baby from crying. I love him and everything but, wow, babies are boring.\n\nUntil her maternity leave ends, this is my wife’s entire life. How on earth does she manage it? A week of this and I would be a permanently undressed alcoholic who subsisted on a diet of chips and biscuits, but somehow she’s kept it together for six entire months. It’s amazing.\n\nMy wife gives herself a lot of grief about her skills as a mother. She writes vast to-do lists, then beats herself up when she doesn’t accomplish everything on them. She compulsively reads bullshitty “A day in the life of a typical mum” blogposts written by smug liars with Smeg fridges and secret nannies, then worries that she isn’t keeping up – as if she’s somehow letting our son down by not baking fresh wholewheat muffins every morning while simultaneously feeding him and doing pilates.\n\nIf only she knew how jealous of her I am. She’s incredible at this. I’ve got work to hide behind, but she spends every day deep inside parenting’s guts. She’s taken to it so naturally, so much more naturally than I have. I knew this already, but last Thursday’s events reinforced it. We’re both so lucky to have her.\n\n@stuheritage"
