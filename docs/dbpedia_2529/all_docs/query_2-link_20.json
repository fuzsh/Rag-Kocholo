        "text": "Approximately 21.5 million individuals were impacted by the cyber incident involving background investigation records OPM announced in 2015. Approximately 4.2 million individuals were impacted by the separate but related cyber incident involving personnel records OPM announced in 2015. Most of those people were also impacted by the cyber incident involving background investigations records; approximately 600,000 individuals were impacted only by the cyber incident involving personnel records.\n\nIf you received a notification letter and 25-digit PIN code from the Office of Personnel Management, we have determined that your Social Security number and other personal information were compromised in the 2015 cyber incidents.\n\nWe are offering you a comprehensive suite of credit and identity monitoring, identity theft insurance, and identity restoration services. We are also offering your dependent minor children, who were under the age of 18 as of July 1, 2015, identity monitoring, identity theft insurance, and identity restoration services.\n\nHere are the services the Federal Government is providing to individuals impacted by the 2015 OPM cybersecurity incidents:\n\nEnrollment for Impacted Individuals\n\nIf you’ve received a notification letter and PIN code from OPM, please sign up for MyIDCare.\n\nSign Up Online\n\nReturning?

These services are also available to your dependent minor children who were under the age of 18 before July 1, 2015. Please enroll with the service provider to access this service.\n\nCredit monitoring\n\nCredit monitoring services includes monitoring of credit reports at all three national credit reporting agencies (e.g., Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion). Please enroll with the service provider to access this service.\n\nIdentity restoration services\n\nIf your identity is compromised, representatives from the service provider will work with you to take steps to restore your identity. You and your dependent minor children have access to this benefit at any time during the coverage period without having to enroll in monitoring services; however, to utilize the restoration services, impacted individuals will need to verify that they are eligible to access services with the service provider.\n\nIdentity theft insurance\n\nIdentity theft insurance is being provided to impacted individuals and their dependent minor children regardless of whether they enroll in monitoring services. For those whose data were impacted by the background investigation records incident, identity theft insurance became effective on September 1, 2015. For those whose data were impacted by the personnel records incident, identity theft insurance became effective on December 2, 2016. The insurance covers all incidents of identity theft that occur during the coverage period, regardless of the source. It also covers you for expenses incurred in restoring your identity, with no deductible.\n\nIf you have received a notification letter and PIN code from OPM, please enroll with the service provider.\n\nBack to Top\n\nVerify if You Were Impacted in the OPM Cybersecurity Incidents Announced in 2015\n\nContacting the Verification Center\n\nVerify Online\n\nOr by phone:\n\n800-750-3004 (Toll Free)\n\nMonday-Saturday, 9AM–9PM ET\n\nPrivacy Statement\n\nThe Federal Government has set up a Verification Center to assist individuals who believe their data may have been impacted in the incidents involving background investigation records and personnel records.
