We do not yet know the cause of death, only that it was announced by a press release from Karl's team. Karl was an integral part of The Waterboys from 1983 to the end of 1985, and was one of the original touring line-up. He made many powerful contributions to the band during his membership, many of which are included and described in the recent 1985 box set and book. Among his great Waterboy moments were the synthesisers on The Whole Of The Moon, piano on This Is The Sea itself and incredible hammond organ on Rags and Beverly Penn. He also co-wrote Don't Bang The Drum and played unique synth bass on half the This Is The Sea album, and the demos he and Mike recorded at Karl's home studio, Seaview, were integral to the development of the band's sound during that era. Karl went on to lead World Party through many albums and successes and composed the smash hit She's The One, made famous by Robbie Williams. Mike Scott posted on Twitter: \"Travel on well, my old friend. You are one of the finest musicians I've ever known\". All of us at the Waterboys send our condolences to Karl's family.\n\n1985: HOW THE WATERBOYS MADE THIS IS THE SEA AND SAW THE WHOLE OF THE MOON. Coming 23 Feb: a fantastic 6CD box set covering the making of the classic album This Is The Sea, with 95 tracks (64 previously unreleased) - demos, outtakes, live, TV & radio sessions, unheard songs PLUS an incredible photo-illustrated 220-page hardcover book by Mike Scott about the creation of the album.\n\nTo celebrate the release of HOW THE WATERBOYS MADE THIS IS THE SEA AND SAW THE WHOLE OF THE MOON, Mike Scott will participate in Q+A events at Rough Trade East London with Pete Paphides, and Tower Records Dublin with Pat Carty. Both will be followed by signing sessions for any releases pre-ordered with tickets. Details are included at the link below.\n\nThe original video for The Whole Of The Moon has been newly remastered in HD, and is on YouTube and streaming services now.

You can order here.\n\nA Rock In The Weary Land was the The Waterboys' seventh studio album, originally released in September 2000. The recording saw the return of the band name after Mike Scott's two solo albums and featured contributions from two original Waterboys, Kevin Wilkinson and Anthony Thistlethwaite, new ones including keyboard players Thighpaulsandra and Sir Richard Naiff, and even a future Waterboy, bassist Mark Smith who was a member 2006-9. British rock weekly New Musical Express described the album as \"a masterpiece\".\n\nThis Cooking Vinyl release marks its first ever release on vinyl. Mike has curated this definitive version, with the sequence on the LPs and CD Disc 1 based on the 14-song 2001 US edition, which added Lucky Day/Bad Advice and My Lord, What A Morning to the original UK tracklist. The 2CD version features twelve previously unreleased tracks and the 4th side of the 2LP vinyl is a spectacular 16-minute live version of Waterboys' classic Savage Earth Heart.\n\nScott has also overseen a re-working of the artwork, using a different Steve Gullick photo from the original cover session on the front, while both vinyl and CD formats include many previously unseen shots. The CD package includes a 28-page booklet, and the vinyl album comes in a gatefold sleeve.\n\nPre-orders for the reissue of A ROCK IN THE WEARY LAND begin today, Thurs 10 Nov.

CD and digital release date is Fri 17 June.\n\nMike writes: \"The demos for the Mr Yeats stage show and album were recorded between 2005 and 2009 in Findhorn and Dublin, and I've always wanted to release them. They have their own magical sound and in many cases were recorded as I was writing the music, so they are super fresh with the imprint of the original inspiration. The demos also include a number of tracks that didn't make it to the finished show or album, but which form a greater picture of Yeats' poetry and its adaptability to music. The previously unheard poems include A Coat, The Mask, Paistin Finn, The Pilgrim, Freddie Stevenson's beautiful demo of Tread Softly (For You Tread On My Dreams), and Steve Wickham's delightful rendering of Come Gather Round Me, Parnellites. There are 23 in all.\"\n\nPre-order AN APPOINTMENT WITH MR YEATS from The Waterboys Official Store here and scroll down for bundle options.\n\nAs part of this week's 'one-a-day' series on Patreon Mike has posted a fantastic 1985 BBC radio version of Behold The Sea/This Is the Sea. In the post Mike writes:\n\n\"I spent a lot of time over the past six months working on the box set and book about the recording of This Is The Sea, to come out, we think, sometime in late 2023 or the first half of 2024. The box gathers studio and live recordings, songwriting demos and radio broadcasts, and includes a huge amount of music that hasn't been released before. Among the items is this version of This Is the Sea, with alternate lyric and retitled Behold The Sea, from a BBC radio session recorded in November 1985.\n\nThis was the last recording to feature the old line-up of The Waterboys and will be the final track on the box...or almost. This is a slightly alternative version in which I asked mixing engineer Mick Glossop to mute my vocal for the second chorus because the preceding line is \"heard nothing but silence silently saying to me...\" - and I had the brainwave that the vocal should then indeed be silent. It was worth a shot though in the end the mix for radio included the vocal.

Steve will return for projects in the future but won't be part of the regular Waterboys touring line-up anymore. He's made the decision so he can concentrate on his own work. We wish him every success and look forward to when future Waterboys projects bring him back for more adventures. We'll keep you posted on what he gets up to. Steve has explained to us his reasons and Mike and Brother Paul have commented too:\n\nSteve: \"The downtime during covid changed my life and priorities. It reconnected me with my creativity, and I need to go deeper with this. In the recent years I'd become more of a legacy musician within the Waterboys, playing a big part in the older music onstage but less in the new music and recent albums. So I've decided to retire from Waterboys touring to concentrate on my own work and interests, which include my Sligo-based band No Crows, my art studies, solo music, theatre composing and things yet to come into focus. I still consider myself part of the Waterboys family and will return from time to time as projects require. My time as fiddler with The Waterboys, and specifically with Mike, has been a life defining and soulful experience and I've loved every moment of it. Mike is a great musician and writer and it's been a privilege and joy to work and share that space of high inspiration with him for so long.\"\n\nMike: \"Steve's been part of the heart and soul of The Waterboys for so long it's gonna be strange working without him. But I know we're not finished yet; there'll be more at some stage, and it will be great. I always enjoy his extra-curricular activities so I'm looking forward to seeing how they develop. Most of all I want to thank him for his continued brotherhood, for enhancing my songs with his unique magic and for twenty-six years of great playing in the band.\"\n\nPaul: \"There are so many things I'll miss about being in a band with Steve. Among the top is his genuine kindness, his never-dimming crazy-beautiful infectious energy on stage, and the glowing energy we've shared on the stage night after night. I will continue channeling his Spirit through each and every performance of my own. And, while I join Mike and the rest of you all in wishing him an AMAZING new life and musical journey, I will still always look forward to new adventures in some way, place, and time! Thank you and epic love and best wishes from here Stevo~~~~!!\"\n\nWe've put together a pdf of photos from Steve's long lifetime with The Waterboys, which you can download here. Photos were taken by Colm Henry, Philippe Herriau, Frank Miller, Cindy Palmano, Steve Gullick, Paul Mac Manus, Gavin Kelly, Howard Rankin and other Waterboys.\n\nAs we move ever closer to the end of the live music drought Brother Paul has been keeping busy and is thrilled to announce not one, but TWO video premieres this weekend!\n\nThe first video, which will premiere Sat 22 May at 12pm CST (3pm EST/6pm GMT), features The Waterboys performing a stunning 8 plus minute version of Prince’s Purple Rain at no other venue than First Avenue in Minneapolis. The video was shot around the same time that Prince was performing The Whole Of The Moon live at his shows and The Waterboys wished to repay the compliment. It features legendary Swamper David Hood on bass, who prior to touring with The Waterboys had not toured since 1975 with Traffic. The video will go live here.\n\nThis should get you all warmed up for the second video, which will premiere Sun 23 May at 12pm CST (3pm EST/6pm GMT). This is Brother Paul’s second video for Musicares entitled Only Love. Musicares provides preventative recovery and emergency assistance to safeguard the well-being of music people in need. As you can imagine access to support is vital during this period when so many people in the music industry have been impacted by Covid19. You can check out their website here.\n\nOnly Love will go live here.\n\nOR you can use the convenient end card on the Purple Rain video to click straight through once Only Love goes live. Brother Paul has also graciously added an end card that allows you to hear Prince’s live version of The Whole Of The Moon for anyone who is interested in checking it out.\n\nLove and miss live music? Yep, us too. As those of you who frequent shows realise, it takes many hands and a lot of hard work to make live music possible. We see the performers on stage giving it their all, but behind the scenes the crew and technicians are working every bit as hard to make the magic happen. During these trying times, these unsung heroes who have lost incomes due to coronavirus need our support to keep them going until live shows get off the ground once more.\n\nThe I LOVE LIVE memorabilia prize draw, arranged through Crowdfunder and Stagehand Charity, is your chance to contribute. For a donation of £5 you can show your support as well as be entered to win a copy of a set of lyrics to THE WHOLE OF THE MOON, FISHERMAN'S BLUES and HOW LONG WILL I LOVE YOU each handwritten and signed by Mike Scott. The drawing for the prize will take place on Thurs 17 Dec at 6pm GMT and you can enter here.\n\nWe're thrilled to announce that The Waterboys launch their Patreon page today - an exciting new way to interact with the band. For a universal monthly fee of £10 a month subscribers will receive exclusive and behind the scenes material including at least 4 unreleased tracks each month plus videos, stories, texts and photos - both current and from the band's huge archive . New subscribers will immediately access a start-off \"motherlode\" of 11 fabulous unreleased tracks, a photo exploration of Mike's home studio, two exclusive videos and two stories - one in text form, the other as audio. New material will be getting posted weekly. Says Mike: \"Patreon is a way for us to share with fans the music that might not make it onto the records: jams, demos, strange songs, experiments. We also have a lot of great live recordings that have never been made public. We'll be posting these too. I also have ideas for video content and other stuff. It's gonna be a lot of fun.\" To subscribe click here.\n\nAnd Mike has posted a short and entertaining video inviting fans to join.\n\nBritish musician and sometime Waterboys bassist Matthew Seligman has died from complications arising from Coronavirus. Matthew came into the early Waterboys orbit after playing with Anthony Thistlethwaite in The Soft Boys. On Anthony's recommendation, Matthew was asked to join Mike Scott's pre-Waterboys band The Red And The Black for whom he made five live appearances around London in 1982. Matthew was later recalled to play bass on Be My Enemy on the album This Is The Sea and also gave Mike the title The Crash Of Angel Wings which finally turned into a song on 2007's Book Of Lightning. Matthew's best known work was with Thomas Dolby and he also played with David Bowie at Live Aid and with many other acts and bands. Mike tweeted that Matthew was a \"true gentleman\" and added: \"The last time I saw him, strangely enough, was at Mark Smith's funeral in 2009 - another Waterboys bass player passing on. We sat together and talked about old days. I'll always remember Matthew as a very kind man, and as a brilliant, fluid bass player - easily the best bassist I'd ever played with when I first met him. He cut a dash too in his elongated paisley jacket, like a long louche cat onstage. Later he became a barrister and human rights lawyer - so he was also a cat who could excel in different worlds.\"\n\nMike Scott was present when Sharon Shannon's first recordings were made in the west of Ireland back in 1989. The sessions featured Sharon's accordion and fiddle, Donal Lunny and Eoin O'Neill on bouzouki, Mike on bodhran and many other great musicians playing together in a relaxed but wild atmosphere - and all captured in beautiful sound. The recording weren't released at the time because Sharon joined the Waterboys and toured for a year. By then her music had changed. The \"Winkles Tapes\" remained in a dusty box for 30 years until six months ago Mike went through them and assembled an album of the best performances. \"It is some of the best Irish trad music ever made\" he told us, \"a charismatic performer at the early peak of her powers, backed by some of the all-time greats including the old master Donal Lunny. It was an incredible scene to witness and be a small part of, and I'm happy to help bring it to you now\". Mike himself features, playing bodhran on the track Bonnie Kate. The album is available to buy, download or stream here and below is Mike's longer description of the sessions, extracted from his book Adventures Of A Waterboy.\n\nThe Waterboys had released Fisherman's Blues six months before. We were deep in our Irish/Scottish/Celtic adventure, and word had reached us of a remarkable young button accordion musician called Sharon Shannon. Our soundman, John Dunford, was working with her and invited Wickham and I to her first recording session in the village of Kinvara, a funky hamlet on the west coast of Ireland. The venue was Winkles, a long dark bar with décor from the 1950s or ‘60s. At the front end a circle of musicians was gathered, led by the twenty-year-old Sharon, who hurtled through set after set of exquisitely played tunes, notes scattering from her fingers like machine gun fire, an impossibly fast but exquisitely articulated stream of music. I’d never considered the idea that an accordion player could be a star, yet here was the reality. She sat on a low chair, bobbing her head as if to say “Hello, isn’t this fun!”, welcoming all to her music with a magnetic smile, while functioning as the dynamo in the centre of an ever-changing group of musical backers: Donal Lunny strumming his bouzouki as always like a happy clockwork toy; the kindly giant Eoin O’Neill on his; guitar picker Gerry O'Beirne. The topline accompanists - whistlers, fiddlers, flute players - revolved as well, each taking their turn to partner Sharon. Even U2’s Adam Clayton, entering the scene with an air of genial bemusement, added some bass to a set. Sharon's younger sister, Mary, a freckled, banjo-playing sprite, was there too, and when Sharon switched to fiddle, the two led the ensemble in a series of rattling, shattering reels that seemed never to end, each tune leaping higher then the last in a music as wild and promethean as any rock and roll.\n\nA note from Mike Scott:\n\nThank you to everyone who came to see us on what was our 11th North American tour. We played to great audiences and were thrilled to make music for you. We also want to thank Neil Mahony and Jeff Adams who stepped in when our bassist Aongus Ralston was recalled to Dublin. Aongus' brother, our great friend and colleague Gavin died of cancer on September 22nd. Tragedy also touched Brother Paul whose brother Pete died in Memphis on 10th October. Both Aongus and Paul were able to get home to be with their brothers before they died, and we're grateful for that. Logistics and great tour management by Keith Anderson made both possible. I'd also like to thank our show crew - Production Managers Neil and Stu, lighting man Donal, onstage sound cat Doug, stageside tech Aaron and our fab merchandising lady Annie. What a pleasure to roam the new world with them all. Thanks also to our great management Gold Village, who oversaw everything with their usual care and dedication. Lastly thanks to our guests - the great Earl Slick who played lead guitar on Whole Of The Moon and Dead Flowers in New York, my songwriting partner James Maddock who sang and strummed on Novemeber Tale and Nearest Thing To Hip also in NY, and Irakli Gabriel and Anana Kaye who played and sang on Rosalind and Purple Rain at the second show in Chicago. Anana also filmed the version of In My Time On Earth that you can view here or on the link below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tGEzwUZpVMs\n\nYou can read some show reviews from various cities by visiting the links below:\n\nSanta Ana:\n\nhttps://rockwrite.blogspot.com/2019/10/the-waterboys-bring-magic-and-firepower.html?m=1\n\nSan Diego:\n\nhttps://americanahighways.org/2019/10/17/show-review-the-waterboys-at-north-park-observatory-in-san-diego/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\n\nToronto:\n\nhttps://thepopbreak.com/2019/10/17/mike-scott-and-the-waterboys-deliver-classics-covers-in-toronto/\n\nLA:\n\nhttps://buzzbands.la/2019/10/16/the-waterboys-share-the-love-at-first-l-a-show-in-four-years/\n\nMinneapolis:\n\nhttps://twincitiesmedia.net/blog/waterboys-storm-the-varsity-like-a-hurtlin-fevered-train/\n\nFollowing the release of Where The Action Is, The Waterboys release the Out Of All This Blue EP today.\n\nWritten for a friend who's been to a dark place, Out Of All This Blue is a compassionate song of reassurance; a Waterboys classic in the making.\n\nYou can hear the original 2015 demo version of the title track from the EP here.\n\nThe EP also features the studio recording of Out Of All This Blue from Where The Action Is, the 2015 demo and two live tracks, London Mick and The Whole Of The Moon (featuring Blaine Harrison from Mystery Jets), recorded on the Chris Evans Virgin Radio Breakfast Show and capturing the band's rock ‘n’ roll edge.\n\nOut Of All The Blue EP tracklist:\n\n1.

All tickets already purchased for the 20th will of course be valid for the 19th. The reason is to accommodate a radio broadcast concert on New York station WFUV on the 24th. Moving the Northampton date means the band will now play 6 shows in a row, not 7. Mike Scott says \"I can't sing 7 nights in a row without losing some of my voice, so we've moved The Calvin by a day which makes a big difference. We need this broadcast because wide radio promotion isn't something we often get offered in North America. I'm really sorry that this means everyone who bought tickets to The Calvin has to bring their night out forward by a day, especially as the original date was a Friday. We will pull out all the stops to make it up to you and will make The Calvin a super special show\". Contact Northampton Box Office at 413-586-8686 during normal business hours (10-6 Mon-Sat & 12-5 Sun) with any questions or to buy tickets for the show if you haven't already.\n\nOn the Sunday after playing Fujirock with The Waterboys, Mike Scott went to Harajuku to meet and hang out with the STRANGERS, the rock and roll club who are featured dancing on the recent video for London Mick. He told us: \"When I made the film of the Strangers dancing back in February I didn't know them and they didn't know me, but yesterday when I arrived they gave me a wonderfully warm welcome and I had the honour of being introduced to every member of the club by their leader Kazuyo Inui. Then the club founder, Mr Jess Yamanaka, arrived with great charisma. I could feel the true spirit of rock and roll radiating from them. They presented me a club T shirt and rocker's comb and we all posed for photos together. That's Yamanaka san beside me with the pale hat and Kazuyo Inui on my other side, with collar up.\"\n\nIf you haven't seen the video for London Mick yet, you can watch it here.\n\nWe are excited to announce the release of the Waterboys fantastic new album Where The Action Is on 24 May 2019 through Cooking Vinyl Records.

Mike Scott says of the record: \"Out Of All This Blue is 2/3 love and romance, 1/3 stories and observations.

The album was recorded in Nashville, produced by Mike Scott and mixed by the great Bob Clearmountain. Modern Blues is an electric, soulful, bold, freewheeling rock'n'roll record with a skinful of killer new songs, some of which have been premiered live over the past few years. Ralph Salmins, a mainstay on drums for the past four years, appears alongside the talismanic Steve Wickham, who weaves a dizzying fuzz fiddle spell on several tracks. Fresh to the ranks are Memphis keyboard player “Brother” Paul Brown and David Hood, legendary bassist from Muscle Shoals, Alabama. Additional lead guitars are played by 2013 US Waterboy Jay Barclay and Austin soul guitarist Zach Ernst. Guest backing vocalists include southern soul legend Don Bryant. The album cover is a green man photograph titled The King Of Weeds, by New York artists Kahn and Selesnick. Modern Blues will be accompanied by a worldwide tour and details will be announced soon.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. Destinies Entwined 5.45\n\n2. November Tale 5.18\n\n3. Still A Freak 3.59\n\n4.

These will be very special shows in a smaller, more intimate venue than the band would normally play.\n\nDirector Robert Jan Westdijk is proud and amazed: \"It all started with an e-mail in which I wrote that I've been a fan since the 80s and that I was about to make a road movie about a father and son who come closer together through the music of The Waterboys. Not much later I was in Dublin facing my musical hero Mike Scott. He responded enthusiastically and two months later, it was agreed.\" Westdijk emphasises that the experience of the concert will not be affected by the film recordings: \"I want to record the concerts in the way a fan experiences the concert, so I trust the participation of the real Waterboys fans.\"\n\nSupport for these shows will be provided by Freddie Stevenson. Doors open at 19:00 and support begins at 19:30.\n\nSales to the general public begin on Sat 6 Sept at 10am and will be available for 5 Dec here andfor the 6th here"
