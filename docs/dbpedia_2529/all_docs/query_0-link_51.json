        "text": "Will Supernatural’s Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles both end up on the final season of The Boys??\n\nIt’s a question that has already set the internet on fire even though Season 4 of The Boys is airing now and Season 5 hasn’t started filming yet. As a huge fan of both Supernatural and The Boys (and anything Eric Kripke does, actually), nothing would make me happier. Over the past year, I’ve talked to all three of them about the possibility – which it looks like might actually happen!\n\nI was hopeful that Jensen Ackles would join ‘The Boys’ long before the news came out that he would indeed play Soldier Boy in Season 3 of the series – I had been watching the show since Season 1 and so had he, and we’d had several conversations about how much we both loved it. So I was thrilled when it happened (and he was too).\n\nAckles, of course, had worked with showrunner Eric Kripke before on Supernatural, portraying a character that Kripke created who is one of the most popular fictional characters ever, the beloved Dean Winchester. (Long time Supernatural fans like me will never stop loving the Winchesters). The two had remained close, along with the other Winchester brother, Jared Padalecki. So both were thrilled to work together again.\n\nWhen I spoke to Jensen for an exclusive interview chapter in the new book on The Boys, ‘Supes Ain’t Always Heroes’, he told me there was only one person whose opinion of his portrayal of Soldier Boy he cared about very much, and that was Kripke.\n\nWhen I spoke to Kripke, he had only glowing reviews, so I’d say mission accomplished – you can also read Eric’s insights in Supes, along with Jensen’s.\n\nHere’s a little tidbit from my chat with Kripke:\n\nMe: I just knew that Jensen would be so damn good at portraying Soldier Boy, in that he can make you understand every emotion his character is feeling, so I think alot of us were just uncomfortably blown away – in a good way – because people loved Soldier Boy and knew they should hate him!\n\nKripke: What’s funny in regard to Jensen playing Soldier Boy is, you know, he’s fucking fantastic, and he’s just so good at bringing the audience. It’s almost like, what I laugh about is like he was probably like a little too good at his job! I could have gone for the audience being like oh, I hate that guy, but so many people took his side in the finale like, we’re on his side, he’s the guy, fuck everyone! And you’re like, but he’s the bad guy and he’s trying to kill a ten year old…\n\nI love their mutual appreciation that has stayed strong all these years.\n\nAs a huge fan (obviously) of both The Boys and Supernatural, I’ve also been thrilled every time an SPN alum makes an appearance. Christian Keyes crossed over to play A Train’s brother. Alex Calvert memorably played a character on Gen V. This season, Jeffrey Dean Morgan joined the fun and Rob Benedict made an appearance that no one will ever forget. Even if they want to.\n\nI spoke to Eric Kripke after Season 3 had aired to ask him about where the series was headed, and I asked about the possibility of Jared Padalecki taking a turn on The Boys. I mean, he’s definitely a fan of the show – and of Soldier Boy! (Who we know is not dead…)\n\nTurns out they had already chatted about it.\n\nMe: Soooooo any possibility that the other Winchester brother might turn up on The Boys? I’d love to see Jared on the show.\n\nKripke: I told him, I’m like, you have an open door, man, so whenever you’re free from Walker, let’s talk about it. We’d have to pull it off with scheduling but yeah, ideally that would be great.\n\nMe: I’m crossing my fingers. And if whoever Jared is playing ends up on screen with Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy, I don’t know what will happen to the Supernatural fandom. An implosion maybe? An awesome one?\n\nKripke agreed.\n\nI also, of course, chatted with Jared. He’d been too busy with filming and EPing Walker until recently, but that didn’t stop me from asking him about being on The Boys a few months ago. He most definitely did not say no, and he and Jensen both had some ideas about roles he could play that I won’t spoil, but let’s just say it seemed like a possibility.\n\nSo I wasn’t surprised to see Deadline break the story that Kripke and Padalecki have been texting and talking about it, and in fact had spoken about it yesterday – and it looks like a go!\n\nJared said in the Deadline article: We talked today…I only want to work on projects that I really care about or with people I really care about, and obviously Eric and I are indelibly connected forever… I adore Kripke’s storytelling, I will be ready when he makes the phone call. The answer is yes!\n\nLooks like this might actually be happening – and I am so ready!!\n\nWhat sort of role do you hope Jared would be playing? An ally of The Boys (and an antagonist to Soldier Boy)? A supe villain? A Vought corporate villain? So many possibilities!\n\nYou can read more of my exclusive interview with Jensen Ackles all about Soldier Boy (have I mentioned that we know he’s not dead?), plus insights from many of the other actors and some deep dives into all the characters and what makes the show so intriguing in ‘Supes Ain’t Always Heroes’. Catch up now and get ready for more of the wild ride that is ‘The Boys’!\n\nInfo at:"
