        "text": "Creating a comfortable and organized shared bedroom/nursery for my boys, was top priority when planning this space. It has not been easy keeping my almost 6 year old out of this room as I worked on it. Every time I attempted to photograph it, there would be what looked like a tornado of toys splattered across the room.\n\nThis post contains sponsored links from Cricut.\n\nDIY projects in this pic include: the paper mobile, I made with my Cricut Expressions 2 machine, wall art (which is temporary and something I totally just threw together), pillows, Monogram wall art, crib skirt, and I painted the dresser.\n\nWe started this room years ago in this theme—-there’s something about red, white and blue that just says little boys to me, Love it!\n\nThe lower half of the walls are treated with Allen and Roth bead board paint-able wallpaper, which was really easy to put up and has help up pretty well over the years.\n\nAlthough Cayden has graciously accepted the fact that his baby brother will be joining him soon, he was rather irritated with my constant cleaning and kicking him out as I prepped the space. Sorry kiddo, that’s what happens when you have a nesting mama!\n\nMy guy loves cranking out art pieces rapidly! So, I hot glued some clothes pins to a painted 1×4 piece of scrap wood and screwed it to the wall to display his work, awards and the silver bucket that holds the chalk.\n\nI had to utilize several bins and baskets for organization as this is such a small space. In fact Cayden’s bed is on risers to provide extra storage space under his bed.\n\nI love wooden toys and how they lend a classic feel to the space.\n\nThe “Let’s hear it for the BOYS” sign started out as string art, but I am so IMPATIENT decided to go in a different direction and hand painted it, which took a very, very long time, but I like how it came out. That song was one of my favorites growing up, I can just picture Kevin Bacon dancing in Footloose, every time I read that sign, lol.\n\nThe Strong, Brave, Wise wall art here, is just fabric, actually an old sheet stretched over canvas, with cricut letters hot-glued to it (crookedly, lol) but I needed something quick to fill the wall.\n\nThe light fixture was a steal for $30 at Lowes, the lamp was only $8 at Christmas tree shop, I just added gross grain red ribbon to the shade. The rug is from Ikea, which is super soft, but collects lint like no tomorrow, not sure if I would recommend it.\n\nHe’s had the table and chair set for a while and can use repainting, but due to the snow that we’ve been getting in Rhode Island, that is a project that’ll have to wait until spring.\n\nI bought some cheap white panels at Walmart, which may be replaced, they don’t seem to fall right and are very stiff, or I may eventually add some coordinating material to add length and weight to them.\n\nFun Fact: NOT ONE of my 3 children have slept in their cribs, I’m really hopeful for #4!\n\nThe striped sheets and duvet are from Target, the throw pillow fabric is from Hobby lobby. I usually purchase a yard to make 2 pillows, and then use scrap fabrics or extra sheets as backing fabric, which I did here.\n\nNeedless to say, my little guy is very cozy in his new space, hope he feels the same way once his brother is born! Thanks so much for visiting!"
