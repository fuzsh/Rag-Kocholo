        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nOberon and Titania, king and queen of the fairies, quarrel over possession of a young Indian boy. Oberon orders Robin Goodfellow, a hobgoblin or “puck,” to obtain a special flower that makes people fall in love with the next creature they see. Oberon wants to make Titania fall in love with a beast and use her infatuation to get the Indian boy from her. Demetrius enters pursued by Helena, whom he tries to drive off. When Robin returns, Oberon, who sympathizes with Helena’s love, orders him to find the Athenian man (i.e., Demetrius) and apply some of the flower’s magic nectar to his eyes.\n\nEnter a Fairy at one door and Robin Goodfellow at\n\nanother.\n\nROBIN\n\n0365 How now, spirit? Whither wander you?\n\nFAIRY\n\n0366 Over hill, over dale,\n\n0367 Thorough bush, thorough brier,\n\n0368 Over park, over pale,\n\n0369 5 Thorough flood, thorough fire;\n\n0370 I do wander everywhere,\n\n0371 Swifter than the moon’s sphere.\n\n0372 And I serve the Fairy Queen,\n\n0373 To dew her orbs upon the green.\n\n0374 10 The cowslips tall her pensioners be;\n\n0375 In their gold coats spots you see;\n\n0376 Those be rubies, fairy favors;\n\n0377 In those freckles live their savors.\n\n0378 I must go seek some dewdrops here\n\n0379 15 And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.\n\n0380 Farewell, thou lob of spirits. I’ll be gone.\n\n0381 Our queen and all her elves come here anon.\n\nROBIN\n\n0382 The King doth keep his revels here tonight.\n\n0383 Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,\n\np. 37\n\n0384 20 For Oberon is passing fell and wrath\n\n0385 Because that she, as her attendant, hath\n\n0386 A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;\n\n0387 She never had so sweet a changeling.\n\n0388 And jealous Oberon would have the child\n\n0389 25 Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild.\n\n0390 But she perforce withholds the lovèd boy,\n\n0391 Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her\n\n0392 joy.\n\n0393 And now they never meet in grove or green,\n\n0394 30 By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,\n\n0395 But they do square, that all their elves for fear\n\n0396 Creep into acorn cups and hide them there.\n\nFAIRY\n\n0397 Either I mistake your shape and making quite,\n\n0398 Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite\n\n0399 35 Called Robin Goodfellow. Are not you he\n\n0400 That frights the maidens of the villagery,\n\n0401 Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quern\n\n0402 And bootless make the breathless huswife churn,\n\n0403 And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,\n\n0404 40 Mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?\n\n0405 Those that “Hobgoblin” call you and “sweet Puck,”\n\n0406 You do their work, and they shall have good luck.\n\n0407 Are not you he?\n\nROBIN 0408 Thou speakest aright.\n\n0409 45 I am that merry wanderer of the night.\n\n0410 I jest to Oberon and make him smile\n\n0411 When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,\n\n0412 Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.\n\n0413 And sometime lurk I in a gossip’s bowl\n\n0414 50 In very likeness of a roasted crab,\n\n0415 And, when she drinks, against her lips I bob\n\n0416 And on her withered dewlap pour the ale.\n\n0417 The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,\n\n0418 Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;\n\np. 39\n\n0419 55 Then slip I from her bum, down topples she\n\n0420 And “Tailor!” cries and falls into a cough,\n\n0421 And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffe\n\n0422 And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear\n\n0423 A merrier hour was never wasted there.\n\n0424 60 But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.\n\nFAIRY\n\n0425 And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!\n\nEnter ⌜Oberon⌝ the King of Fairies at one door, with his\n\ntrain, and ⌜Titania⌝ the Queen at another, with hers.\n\nOBERON\n\n0426 Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.\n\nTITANIA\n\n0427 What, jealous Oberon? ⌜Fairies,⌝ skip hence.\n\n0428 I have forsworn his bed and company.\n\nOBERON\n\n0429 65 Tarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?\n\nTITANIA\n\n0430 Then I must be thy lady. But I know\n\n0431 When thou hast stolen away from Fairyland\n\n0432 And in the shape of Corin sat all day\n\n0433 Playing on pipes of corn and versing love\n\n0434 70 To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,\n\n0435 Come from the farthest steep of India,\n\n0436 But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\n\n0437 Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,\n\n0438 To Theseus must be wedded, and you come\n\n0439 75 To give their bed joy and prosperity?\n\nOBERON\n\n0440 How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,\n\n0441 Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,\n\n0442 Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?\n\n0443 Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering\n\n0444 80 night\n\n0445 From ⌜Perigouna,⌝ whom he ravishèd,\n\np. 41\n\n0446 And make him with fair ⌜Aegles⌝ break his faith,\n\n0447 With Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\n\n0448 These are the forgeries of jealousy;\n\n0449 85 And never, since the middle summer’s spring,\n\n0450 Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\n\n0451 By pavèd fountain or by rushy brook,\n\n0452 Or in the beachèd margent of the sea,\n\n0453 To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\n\n0454 90 But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.\n\n0455 Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\n\n0456 As in revenge have sucked up from the sea\n\n0457 Contagious fogs, which, falling in the land,\n\n0458 Hath every pelting river made so proud\n\n0459 95 That they have overborne their continents.\n\n0460 The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,\n\n0461 The plowman lost his sweat, and the green corn\n\n0462 Hath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.\n\n0463 The fold stands empty in the drownèd field,\n\n0464 100 And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.\n\n0465 The nine-men’s-morris is filled up with mud,\n\n0466 And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\n\n0467 For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.\n\n0468 The human mortals want their winter here.\n\n0469 105 No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.\n\n0470 Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,\n\n0471 Pale in her anger, washes all the air,\n\n0472 That rheumatic diseases do abound.\n\n0473 And thorough this distemperature we see\n\n0474 110 The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\n\n0475 Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,\n\n0476 And on old Hiems’ ⌜thin⌝ and icy crown\n\n0477 An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\n\n0478 Is, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,\n\n0479 115 The childing autumn, angry winter, change\n\n0480 Their wonted liveries, and the mazèd world\n\np. 43\n\n0481 By their increase now knows not which is which.\n\n0482 And this same progeny of evils comes\n\n0483 From our debate, from our dissension;\n\n0484 120 We are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON\n\n0485 Do you amend it, then. It lies in you.\n\n0486 Why should Titania cross her Oberon?\n\n0487 I do but beg a little changeling boy\n\n0488 To be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA 0489 125 Set your heart at rest:\n\n0490 The Fairyland buys not the child of me.\n\n0491 His mother was a vot’ress of my order,\n\n0492 And in the spicèd Indian air by night\n\n0493 Full often hath she gossiped by my side\n\n0494 130 And sat with me on Neptune’s yellow sands,\n\n0495 Marking th’ embarkèd traders on the flood,\n\n0496 When we have laughed to see the sails conceive\n\n0497 And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\n\n0498 Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,\n\n0499 135 Following (her womb then rich with my young\n\n0500 squire),\n\n0501 Would imitate and sail upon the land\n\n0502 To fetch me trifles and return again,\n\n0503 As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\n\n0504 140 But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,\n\n0505 And for her sake do I rear up her boy,\n\n0506 And for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON\n\n0507 How long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA\n\n0508 Perchance till after Theseus’ wedding day.\n\n0509 145 If you will patiently dance in our round\n\n0510 And see our moonlight revels, go with us.\n\n0511 If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON\n\n0512 Give me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\np. 45\n\nTITANIA\n\n0513 Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.\n\n0514 150 We shall chide downright if I longer stay.\n\n⌜Titania and her fairies⌝ exit.\n\nOBERON\n\n0515 Well, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this grove\n\n0516 Till I torment thee for this injury.—\n\n0517 My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb’rest\n\n0518 Since once I sat upon a promontory\n\n0519 155 And heard a mermaid on a dolphin’s back\n\n0520 Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath\n\n0521 That the rude sea grew civil at her song\n\n0522 And certain stars shot madly from their spheres\n\n0523 To hear the sea-maid’s music.\n\nROBIN 0524 160 I remember.\n\nOBERON\n\n0525 That very time I saw (but thou couldst not),\n\n0526 Flying between the cold moon and the Earth,\n\n0527 Cupid all armed. A certain aim he took\n\n0528 At a fair vestal thronèd by ⌜the⌝ west,\n\n0529 165 And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow\n\n0530 As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.\n\n0531 But I might see young Cupid’s fiery shaft\n\n0532 Quenched in the chaste beams of the wat’ry moon,\n\n0533 And the imperial vot’ress passèd on\n\n0534 170 In maiden meditation, fancy-free.\n\n0535 Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.\n\n0536 It fell upon a little western flower,\n\n0537 Before, milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,\n\n0538 And maidens call it “love-in-idleness.”\n\n0539 175 Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.\n\n0540 The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\n\n0541 Will make or man or woman madly dote\n\n0542 Upon the next live creature that it sees.\n\n0543 Fetch me this herb, and be thou here again\n\n0544 180 Ere the leviathan can swim a league.\n\np. 47\n\nROBIN\n\n0545 I’ll put a girdle round about the Earth\n\n0546 In forty minutes.⌜He exits.⌝\n\nOBERON 0547 Having once this juice,\n\n0548 I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep\n\n0549 185 And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.\n\n0550 The next thing then she, waking, looks upon\n\n0551 (Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\n\n0552 On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)\n\n0553 She shall pursue it with the soul of love.\n\n0554 190 And ere I take this charm from off her sight\n\n0555 (As I can take it with another herb),\n\n0556 I’ll make her render up her page to me.\n\n0557 But who comes here? I am invisible,\n\n0558 And I will overhear their conference.\n\nEnter Demetrius, Helena following him.\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0559 195 I love thee not; therefore pursue me not.\n\n0560 Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?\n\n0561 The one I’ll stay; the other stayeth me.\n\n0562 Thou told’st me they were stol’n unto this wood,\n\n0563 And here am I, and wood within this wood\n\n0564 200 Because I cannot meet my Hermia.\n\n0565 Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.\n\nHELENA\n\n0566 You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!\n\n0567 But yet you draw not iron, for my heart\n\n0568 Is true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,\n\n0569 205 And I shall have no power to follow you.\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0570 Do I entice you? Do I speak you fair?\n\n0571 Or rather do I not in plainest truth\n\n0572 Tell you I do not, ⌜nor⌝ I cannot love you?\n\nHELENA\n\n0573 And even for that do I love you the more.\n\np. 49\n\n0574 210 I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,\n\n0575 The more you beat me I will fawn on you.\n\n0576 Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,\n\n0577 Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave\n\n0578 (Unworthy as I am) to follow you.\n\n0579 215 What worser place can I beg in your love\n\n0580 (And yet a place of high respect with me)\n\n0581 Than to be usèd as you use your dog?\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0582 Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,\n\n0583 For I am sick when I do look on thee.\n\nHELENA\n\n0584 220 And I am sick when I look not on you.\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0585 You do impeach your modesty too much\n\n0586 To leave the city and commit yourself\n\n0587 Into the hands of one that loves you not,\n\n0588 To trust the opportunity of night\n\n0589 225 And the ill counsel of a desert place\n\n0590 With the rich worth of your virginity.\n\nHELENA\n\n0591 Your virtue is my privilege. For that\n\n0592 It is not night when I do see your face,\n\n0593 Therefore I think I am not in the night.\n\n0594 230 Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,\n\n0595 For you, in my respect, are all the world.\n\n0596 Then, how can it be said I am alone\n\n0597 When all the world is here to look on me?\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0598 I’ll run from thee and hide me in the brakes\n\n0599 235 And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.\n\nHELENA\n\n0600 The wildest hath not such a heart as you.\n\n0601 Run when you will. The story shall be changed:\n\n0602 Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;\n\n0603 The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind\n\np. 51\n\n0604 240 Makes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speed\n\n0605 When cowardice pursues and valor flies!\n\nDEMETRIUS\n\n0606 I will not stay thy questions. Let me go,\n\n0607 Or if thou follow me, do not believe\n\n0608 But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.\n\nHELENA\n\n0609 245 Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,\n\n0610 You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!\n\n0611 Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.\n\n0612 We cannot fight for love as men may do.\n\n0613 We should be wooed and were not made to woo.\n\n⌜Demetrius exits.⌝\n\n0614 250 I’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell\n\n0615 To die upon the hand I love so well.⌜Helena exits.⌝\n\nOBERON\n\n0616 Fare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,\n\n0617 Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.\n\nEnter ⌜Robin.⌝\n\n0618 Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.\n\nROBIN\n\n0619 255 Ay, there it is.\n\nOBERON 0620 I pray thee give it me.\n\n⌜Robin gives him the flower.⌝\n\n0621 I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,\n\n0622 Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,\n\n0623 Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine,\n\n0624 260 With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine.\n\n0625 There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,\n\n0626 Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.\n\n0627 And there the snake throws her enameled skin,\n\n0628 Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.\n\n0629 265 And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes\n\n0630 And make her full of hateful fantasies.\n\n0631 Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.\n\np. 53\n\n⌜He gives Robin part of the flower.⌝\n\n0632 A sweet Athenian lady is in love\n\n0633 With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes,\n\n0634 270 But do it when the next thing he espies\n\n0635 May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man\n\n0636 By the Athenian garments he hath on.\n\n0637 Effect it with some care, that he may prove\n\n0638 More fond on her than she upon her love.\n\n0639 275 And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.\n\nROBIN\n\n0640 Fear not, my lord. Your servant shall do so.\n\nThey exit."
