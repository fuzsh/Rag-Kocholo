We answer phones, make sales, hire counselors, and lay the foundation for a successful summer every year. There is someone behind the scenes who guides us with his wisdom and helps make sure we […]\n\nAfter four years of Pinnacle summers, we are saying goodbye and thank you to our Office Administrator, Madison Bain. Many of you had the chance to interact with Madison during your phone calls, emails, and opening day camp store shopping at Camp Pinnacle. You were surely greeted with a warm smile and excitement for the […]\n\nIn our leadership program at camp, affectionately known as the “Wolfe Pack,” campers take part in conversations facilitated by our director team geared towards growing as leaders, as members of a community and, most importantly, as individuals. Each workshop focuses on a theme that we think is important. One of the themes for our Pups […]\n\nOn Sunday, November 5th, I ran the New York City Marathon. The sense of pride and accomplishment I felt crossing the finish line after running (and a little bit of walking) for 5 hours and 20 minutes was something I have never felt before. I have done a lot of reflecting over the past month […]\n\nHappy Halloween, Camp Pinnacle families! Alice here! As a lifelong theater kid and camp kween, I am a big costume person and I lean hard into Halloween. I have gone with silly puns, cultural commentary, pop music icons, beloved animated characters, and inanimate objects. I used to save every costume in a giant bag *just […]\n\nWestern North Carolina is a beautiful place to send your child to summer camp. With lovely weather, unmatched nature, high adventure, there is a peacefulness that is hard to find beyond the Blue Ridge. We are so grateful that you chose to send your child to Camp Pinnacle, and you deserve to enjoy the area […]\n\nDo you have a camper who loves to help? A child that, while you were baking cookies, desperately wanted to help and ended up getting batter all over the kitchen? Or that time when your child spilled red paint on the carpet and decided to “help” by mopping it up with the fancy towels reserved […]\n\nHey Y’all! I adopted “y’all” while living in Texas. It didn’t feel natural saying it. I grew up in a “you guys” household in the northeast, so even hearing “y’all” was unfamiliar. But after adjusting to it, it became my favorite way of addressing a group of people. “Y’all” is inclusive. You don’t have to […]\n\nOn opening day, I met 15 teenagers who were excited to be the Wolfe Pack but didn’t quite know what they were in for. There were challenges at first. Waking up early, being on time, running their own schedule, communicating with younger campers, public speaking, facilitating activities, etc. did not come easy for all. Despite […]\n\nFrom Greg Golf – A few years ago a friend asked, “What are the top 3 experiences in your life that made you the person you are today?”. Without skipping a beat I was able to answer this question with certainty: traveling solo to countries where I didn’t speak the language, starting my own business […]\n\nAs we take a deep breath and wrap up another amazing summer, we’re left with incredible memories of all our campers and staff – evenings in the Council Ring singing “Pinnacle Kids” across the lake, cold plunges into the Nantahala River on rafting days, and starting the day with our Good Morning song led by […]\n\nSpring at Camp Pinnacle brings a lot of excitement to our camp family. Inflatables and boats are making their way back into Wolfe Lake, mountain biking trails are getting a fresh trim, and flowers are peaking out to welcome our pre-summer weddings. Everywhere you look there is progress being made and noticeable evidence of the […]\n\nWe are getting closer and closer to camp, so here in Flat Rock we are full steam ahead getting ready for campers to arrive! As you are making your own preparations, you probably have a mental checklist of tasks related to camp. Forms? Done. Sorting out travel plans to camp? Done. Packing? Let’s talk about […]\n\nAs we approach the summer, we are delighted to welcome our Hillside director, Margaret Timberlake to the leadership team. In her past three summers at Camp Pinnacle, Margaret has developed a deep appreciation for our wonderful camp community. Margaret is excited come back to Camp Pinnacle for her fourth summer and to contribute to creating […]\n\nThis blog comes to us from Nurse Anne. Originally from Wales, Anne has lived in the US since 1988. Anne has worn many hats, enrolling in nursing school in 1993 and gravitating immediately towards pediatrics. Anne is a certified pediatric registered nurse with 29 years of practice experience, and three of those were in Africa […]\n\nWe are incredibly excited to welcome Walker Hendry back to our director team this summer. After two summers away, it did not take too much convincing that this is where he is supposed to be. Walker rejoins us for 2022 over seeing the boys’ side of camp. Known for his skills branding paddles, Walker will […]\n\nMeet Corey Elliot How did you find out about Camp Pinnacle? I found Camp Pinnacle through one of my lifelong friends Max Albers, who will be returning for his third summer at camp this year – watch out for this dynamic duo! That photo is of Max and me on a camping trip. After going […]\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce our newest year round staff member, Anna Terry as our office administrator. Anna is a Furman University graduate with a Masters degree from Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. After seventeen years as a community development practitioner internationally and in the Southeast, Anna is excited to bring her administrative skills to […]\n\nWell, it’s much too early for parents of current campers to be thinking about college. We like to think that camp is just one of many stops (college being another) that if approached properly will help our kids transition to adulthood and live bold lives filled with growth, adventure, and learning. Parents often mistake preparing […]\n\nAs we enter a new season at Camp Pinnacle, we are thrilled to introduce our newest year round team member: Jack Privette. Jack hails from North Wilkesboro, NC and has worked at Camp Pinnacle for the past two summers. In 2020 Jack joined Pinnacle’s summer staff as our Head of Ropes and he returned in […]\n\nBy Jane Dockendorf As we wrap up summer 2021 and the completion of 10 summers as the “new” Camp Pinnacle, we are so grateful and humbled by what we have accomplished and the trust you have placed in us. In 2012, our first summer, we served a total of 102 campers (about half of whom […]\n\nLate May is always the time for “all-hands-on-deck” as we make sure that Camp Pinnacle is ready to go by opening day. Even though we have been preparing since last August, getting camp ready always seems to come down to the wire. We bite off too many projects each year and then keep dreaming of […]\n\nBy Steve Baskin I want to share a few thoughts about Fayssoux Moss. Almost eight years ago, we conducted a nationwide search for an assistant director to join our brand-new team at Camp Pinnacle. Back then, camp was much smaller and less complicated. We had no Sky Park, only half as many biking trails, and […]\n\nHi! I’m Charlie Kendrick, and I’m happy to be returning to Pinnacle this summer. I grew up coming to Pinnacle as a camper and later as a counselor. When I became a school teacher (currently I’m the media specialist at Blue Ridge Middle School in Greenville County, SC), I got to return to camp in […]\n\nAs summer draws closer, we are getting so excited about welcoming our campers on opening day! We want to reaffirm our commitment to our mission: to create the safest, most exciting, and most substantive summer camp experience through our personal attention to every camper, our caring, and our competence. To help fulfill this mission, we […]\n\nReturning parents know it, and first-time camp families will soon understand: Seeing photos of your child having fun while they’re away at camp is a huge deal! The Camp Pinnacle media team understands that the photos and videos we upload in the summer are a window into your child’s Pinnacle experience, and we take that […]\n\nGoing to sleepaway camp from the first time can be nerve-wracking due to the uncertainty of a new experience. However, Camp Pinnacle campers and their families will tell you that spending a few weeks at camp is an incredible way to try activities that they don’t do at home and step out of your comfort […]\n\nTom and the entire facilities team have been hard at work preparing camp for summer 2021! For our returning campers who weren’t able to attend in 2020, we know you’ll be wowed with two years’ worth of renovations and additions to explore on opening day. And for those who came last year, we can’t wait […]\n\nIt’s with great eagerness that we look toward the hope and change that 2021 will surely bring. But as we reflect on 2020, we are truly thankful for continued good health in our Pinnacle community as our hearts go out to the many folks who have suffered loss and illness this year. Though this has […]\n\nIn fall, winter, and spring, there is so much that goes on behind the scenes at Camp Pinnacle. On Instagram, we asked campers and parents what they want to know about our off-season, and wow, we had some great inquiries! Below, the low-down on all things camp. What’s it like being at Pinnacle without campers? […]\n\nIt’s been an unusual autumn at Camp Pinnacle—no surprises there. Back when things were “normal,” we barely noticed the transition from summer camp to our fall weddings and school programs. In a typical fall, the day after our summer campers depart, we host a week-long program for underprivileged kids in our community. Every succeeding weekend […]\n\nIt has been an absolute privilege to be able to operate Camp Pinnacle this summer. To be able to see the joy on children’s faces as they reveled in face-to-face connections with friends for two weeks at camp in the middle of a pandemic has been the most rewarding summer we have ever had! The […]\n\nBy Andrea Little Gray, head nurse A healthy camp experience starts at home The build-up to going to camp is an exciting one. There’s the anticipation of meeting new friends, reunited with old ones, packing camp flair and gear, and maybe even getting to pick out a new pair of shoes or backpack. There also […]\n\nThe framework for this article comes from Emily Oster, a professor of economics at Brown University. A mother of two, she writes a newsletter called “Parent Data,” which, as the name suggests, applies data to parenting decisions. We highly recommend reading her recent article, “How to Think Through Choices About Grandparents, Day Care, Summer Camp, […]\n\nLike many other people, spending so much time at home has gotten us a little more acquainted with our baking tools! Has anyone made a new recipe recently? If you haven’t, or maybe you want to try another, we have three great options for you, each from Chef Richard’s recipe box. If you make one, be […]\n\nDuring this unique time, we hope to be a resource for you. By now we can only assume your child has played the same board game 17 times, exhausted their coloring books, and beat the final level on their favorite video game—twice! Don’t fret, we are here to help. The Camp Pinnacle Brain Buster Challenge […]\n\nWe know many of you will be attending Camp Pinnacle for the first time this summer. The thought of spending two to three weeks away from home can be overwhelming for a first-time camper… But don’t fret—we are here to help! Let’s talk about the basics: What does a typical day at Camp Pinnacle? You’ve […]\n\nIt’s a strange world out there. Schools across the country have moved to virtual learning, restaurants can only offer take-out, and ski areas, movie theaters, concerts, and sporting events have been cancelled.

We are adding space to […]\n\nWhen I first heard of the job of “camp counselor” through a mutual connection, it was a tough sell.

These days, we rarely hear “I’m […]\n\nAfter six years of service to Camp Pinnacle, Ben Lea is moving on to accept new challenges.

But there is something about a handwritten letter […]\n\nWe are so excited—the new dining room completely exceeds our expectations! It’s a beautiful space, and the wood floors, made from refinished wood milled more than 100 years ago from native hardwood, are absolutely gorgeous.

To give back to an amazing group of kids and to spend the summer outside with them is […]\n\nWhen people ask me what other programs we compete with, I don’t first think of other outdoor or youth development companies—our competition is actually video games and technology.

We still have space in every session […]\n\nWe are not among the legions that see technology as an evil to be feared. (We love our I-phones). However, we do believe we should think through the ramifications of how technological changes affect our children before we automatically embrace the next and newest gadgets. To our knowledge no one has yet written a parenting […]\n\nDespite over 10 inches of rain this year (and no snow yet,) we are continuing to make all kinds of improvements to Camp Pinnacle. Below are pictures of the new walkway along the lake which replaces the old sea wall. The new fishing pier is beautiful. Thanks Tom, Nick, Alaska and Joe! Construction on the […]\n\nAs the parent of four children, I witness an improvement in family dynamics whenever we are able to spend time outside together as a family. Whether it’s just playing games or better still going on a family hike or bike ride, we just seem to get along better outside. Conversations come more easily and we […]\n\nWe just wanted to say Hi and Happy 2013! This weekend Ben will be in Atlanta with the Mohler family and Dock will be in DC with the Norry family. Ella and Ava are going with Dock to visit with Will and Emily Norry and Kate Lamkin. Next weekend Dock and Ella will be in […]\n\nThere is so much going on at Camp. We’re screaming into the Christmas Holidays with lots of projects. We are taking advantage of a warm fall to get a jump on our huge To Do list before next summer. We’ve finished a new copper roof on the Gym! The waterslide is making huge progress. We […]\n\nI’m serving on an exploratory committee for our municipality, Flat Rock, NC that is studying the feasibility of converting an unsuccessful 55 acre golf course into a public park. If the park becomes a reality I foresee differences in opinion over what the playground “should” look like. Having already heard public comment in which well-intentioned […]\n\nMy family did something different on Thanksgiving morning. We went to a “Turkey Trot” at Camp Pinnacle. We ran/walked fast for 3.1 miles (5K) through Camp Pinnacle’s trails and saw many friends. Camp looks different this time of year. I saw that many things had changed since I had been there this past summer. I […]\n\nThe last group has left, leaves have been raked, re raked and raked again. The roofs have been cleaned off and the water has been turned off in preparation for winter. It’s been a busy fall. We’ve hosted weddings, fund raisers, a sorority gathering, a retirement party, a rehearsal dinner, and several school groups. A […]\n\nI’m going to use pumpkin carving as a metaphor for how ridiculously high the bar is getting set in our global and digitized world. Long ago, my parents would present me my annual pumpkin just before Halloween. I would take my knife, hack out a couple triangles for eyes and a nose, try to cut […]\n\nWe sure had fun in 2012! Hopefully this video will bring back many great memories from this fantastic summer! The video is a great way to share the many amazing things you did at camp with parents, grandparents and friends! …And the good news? Summer 2013 is going to be even better! We are already […]\n\nThe sounds of laughter and outdoor play are still echoing at Camp Pinnacle as we work with schools from across the Southeast this fall. Great food is still being served in the dining room and Tom and Nick are hard at work building decks, upgrading cabins and making improvements. A movie is being filmed here […]\n\nTo say we are excited is an understatement. It’s already day nine of twelve days of staff training and it’s going extremely well. Counselors have taken an intensive lifeguarding course, gone on a hiking overnight, freshened their teaching and activity skills, and painted, cleaned and organized. Trisha Miller a noted area psychologist has taught […]\n\nWe are getting ready! All kinds of new toys are arriving at camp. We are building decks on the girl’s cabins and hope to move the carpentry crew over to “Boy’s Land” soon. The new bathhouses are finished. We are feverishly planning activities and the details for our off campus “Ventures”. A second new mountain […]\n\nMemorial Day weekend conjures up vision of a beach, a lounge chair and a slew of summer reading opportunities. As the Executive Director of Camp Pinnacle, one of my many jobs is to stay in touch with trends affecting kids, the environment, education and the outdoor industry. Though none of these books would qualify as […]\n\nFor the past 20 years, Dock and I have enthusiastically endorsed summer camp as a great growth experience for children. Every year we become more passionate about the benefits. At times, we wondered if we might be overstating our case. We are now convinced that we have been understating both the power and the importance […]\n\nThank you to the many of you who attended our Open House last Saturday. We were gratified that close to 50 folks streamed in to see the many improvements at Camp Pinnacle, meet Ben, Cait, Dock and Jane and begin making friends for the incredible summer ahead. Campers came from Virginia, Georgia, and North and […]\n\nWe are excited to meet several of our new campers this Saturday, May 5 between 10 and 2 for an Open House at Camp Pinnacle. We aren’t quite ready for summer, yet but we are eager to show off all of our hard work this winter and to point out the many new improvements still […]\n\nThe magic of Camp Pinnacle can be summed up with 1 C and 4P’s • Place • Philosophy • Program • People • Culture Less important than the others is PLACE. We believe that you could give us your camper and we could not leave a grassy field for14 days, and parents and campers would […]\n\nFridays are the most important day of my week. It’s the day I interview potential Camp Pinnacle counselors. If a candidate makes it to my interview, (their third interview) they have already been carefully screened and there is a high likelihood they will be hired. I feel the weight of responsibility. This year our hiring […]\n\nSomeone has to be first! In 1928, it was Jervey DuPre who signed up to be Camp Pinnacle’s first camper. He is still alive today and 3 generations and countless members of the extended DuPre family have attended Pinnacle over the years! Jervey would see many changes at Camp Pinnacle if he visited today but […]\n\nA prevailing theme in American life today is that the more digitally connected we are, the better off we are “supposed” to be. We all generally accept the rush to new and better digital technology and the pace of change is so fast, there is no framework to judge if ultimately our digital world is […]\n\nRelaxing after a Sunday dinner, my wife Margo and I engaged in a lively conversation about camp with my visiting parents. I asked what it was 31 years ago that inspired my parents, who had never been to an overnight camp themselves, to make a huge financial stretch and send their 8 year old son […]\n\nHow much fun is this? Bringing this great camp back to life is so much more fun than if we were starting our own. It’s an absolute joy to see the smiles on alumnae’s faces and hear the laughs in their voices when they discover that the institution that meant so much to them and […]\n\n6/1/2012 – Camp is still abuzz with construction crews and our maintenance staff working hard to complete pre-season projects. A crew is building a new novice mountain bike trail through the north woods, the remodeled bathrooms look fantastic, and the new staircase leading to the infirmary is an attractive, albeit small, new detail to main […]"
