        "text": "Scores for the ACT Test\n\nHow can I see my scores?\n\nWhen available, your scores are posted online and accessed using your MyACT account.\n\nACT Customer Support cannot provide your scores by phone, email, chat, or fax.\n\nMultiple choice scores are normally available two weeks after each national test date, but it can sometimes take up to eight weeks.\n\nWriting scores are normally available about two weeks after\n\nyour multiple-choice scores.\n\nIf you took the writing test, your overall scores are not officially reported until your writing scores have been added. Viewing your scores online does not speed up reporting.\n\nOn select test dates, ACT performs equating activities to ensure that scores reported have a constant meaning across all test forms. During equating test dates, scores are available within 3-8 weeks.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 testing year, equating will be adminstered in October.\n\nScore reporting dates\n\nScores are delivered over a window of time after the test date and are processed continuously during business hours. ACT is committed to providing your scores as quickly as possible but cannot guarantee a specific date for your scores to be reported.\n\n2023-2024\n\nNational test dateReporting Timeframe\n\nFebruary 10, 2024February 20 – April 5\n\nApril 13, 2024April 23 – June 7\n\nJune 8, 2024June 18 – August 2July 13, 2024July 23 – September 6\n\n2024-2025\n\nNational test dateReporting TimeframeSeptember 14, 2024September 24 – November 8October 26, 2024November 5 – December 20December 14, 2024December 24 – February 7February 8, 2025February 18 – April 4April 5, 2025April 15 – May 30June 14, 2025June 24 – August 8July 12, 2025July 22 – September 5\n\nIf your scores are not yet available, while during the posted timeframe, ACT is unable to provide a status or timeline about a specific score.\n\nDelivery timelines\n\nACT sends score report data to the recipients you provided during registration; these include your high school and any institutions with college codes you provided. ACT also provides your scores through your web account.\n\nType of reportWhere it's deliveredWhen it's deliveredWhat it reportsStudent reportYour MyACT accountAbout 2–8 weeks after the test dateACT scores, college and career planning informationHigh school reportYour high school via\n\nonline reportingAbout 2–8 weeks after the test dateACT scores, college and career planning informationCollege reportEach valid college code you listed and paid for when you registered or tested (up to six)Varies based on college and when ordered\n\nEverything on the Student and High School Report, plus the grades you reported in up to 30 high school courses; it may also include predictions about your performance in specific college programs and courses\n\nYour scores in MyACT\n\nMyACT is mobile-accessible and friendly and all results can be accessed on a PC, tablet, or mobile device.\n\nWhen you select score recipients, you’ll have the option of sending either score reports from the specific test event or you can choose to send your superscore.\n\nYou may print an unofficial copy of your ACT test score by using your browser’s print option. A PDF student report is currently unavailable.\n\nAdditional Services\n\nNeed to send more scores?\n\nCan scores be cancelled?\n\nACT reserves the right to cancel test scores when there is reason to believe the scores are invalid. See the Compromises/Disruptions in the Testing Process—Limitation of Remedies section of the ACT Terms and Conditions (PDF) for details.\n\nOutside of state testing and district testing, you may request to cancel scores for a particular test date. Contact us online and we will provide you a form to complete and return to us. We will then permanently cancel that score record for the indicated test date and send cancellation notices to any score recipients.\n\nUnderstanding Your Scores\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThere's a lot of information provided in the ACT score report.\n\nFollow the link below to learn why we show individual reporting categories, how we arrived at your Composite score—and more!\n\nNational ranks\n\nHow do you compare?\n\nYour national ranks tell you how your scores compare to those earned by recent high school graduates who took the ACT. Colleges use this information to help make admissions decisions, and scholarship agencies may base awards on it.\n\nHow schools use results\n\nYour current and future schools want to learn more about you.\n\nJust as you can use national ranks to get a sense of your strengths and weaknesses, so can your high school and potential colleges. A high rank in a content area may suggest a good chance of success in related college majors and careers. A low rank may indicate that you need to develop your skills more by taking additional coursework in that area. This information is helpful for you as well as your current and future schools.\n\nShould I retest?\n\nTest Security Hotline\n\nCheating hurts everyone – if you see it, report it. You can make an anonymous report by using the Test Security Hotline. Discussing test content—including on social media—is not permitted. Students who don't do their own work put honest students at a disadvantage. If you suspect that someone is trying to take unfair advantages or encounter anything else out of the ordinary, please report it to ACT.\n\nCompromises and disruptions"
