        "text": "A student seeking State financial aid (including TAP) for the first time, beginning with the 2007-08 academic year, must pass a federally approved ATB test identified by the Board of Regents if the student does not possess a U.S. high school diploma or its recognized equivalent. (Section 661 of the Education Law, as amended by Chapter 57 of the Laws of 2007)\n\nNote: to learn more about acceptable U.S. High School diplomas and their equivalents, please see our ATB questions and answers.\n\nThe purpose of this and related ATB requirements is to ensure the effective use of financial aid funds and to help align admission requirements, level of curricula, and academic support.\n\nRequired Institutional Statement on ATB Tests\n\nAs part of the amended ATB requirements, all degree-granting and non-degree public vocational institutions must submit the Statement on Ability-to-Benefit Tests (NYSED ATB Form 1) by July 1, of each year, to identify the following:\n\nthe approved ATB tests the institution will use for students without U.S. high school diplomas or the equivalent and who wish to qualify for State student aid;\n\nminimum passing scores on those tests, consistent with admissions criteria, curricula and academic support; and\n\nhow the institution will administer the tests.\n\nThe following six tests have been approved by the Regents for ATB purposes:\n\nTest: Wonderlic Basic Skills Test (WBST), Verbal Forms VS-1 & VS-2\n\nQuantitative Forms QS-1 & QS-2. This is a paper and pencil test.\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2015\n\nTest: Wonderlic Basic Skills Test (WBST), Verbal Forms VS-1 & VS-2\n\nQuantitative Forms QS-1 & QS-2. This is an online version of the tests.\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2015\n\nTest: Spanish Wonderlic Basic Skills Test (Spanish WBST), Verbal Forms VS-1 & VS-2\n\nQuantitative Forms QS-1 & QS-2. This is a paper and pencil test\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2015\n\nTest: Spanish Wonderlic Basic Skills Test (Spanish WBST), Verbal Forms VS-1 & VS-2\n\nQuantitative Forms QS-1 & QS-2. This is an online version of the tests.\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2015\n\nTest: Combined English Language Skills Assessment (CELSA), Forms 1 and 2\n\nEffective Date: November 1, 2002.\n\nNote: The CELSA test is approved as provided in 34 CFR 668.153(a)(2) as the additional ATB English language proficiency test that must be taken by students whose native language is not English and who are not fluent in English if the academic program includes an English as a Second Language (ESL) component.\n\nTest: ACCUPLACER (Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic)\n\nEffective Date: July 1, 2020.\n\nThe minimum passing score an institution sets on an approved ATB test must first be approved by the Board of Regents. Determinations about minimum passing scores on approved ATB tests should be strongly linked to the institution’s admission and financial aid policies, as well as with the level of curricula and academic support provided to students.\n\nAnnual Certification\n\nBeginning in 2011, each institution that offers ATB tests to qualify students for financial aid will certify annually, by July 1, that its procedures meet the requirements of Section 145-2.15 of Commissioner’s Regulations, which implements the amended ATB requirements.\n\nAnnual certification form (ATB Form 2)\n\nQuestions and Answers"
