        "text": "CINEMA PACIFIC GLOBAL INDUSTRIES FORUM with ERIC LIN\n\n12:30 p.m. 141 Allen Hall\n\nFree\n\nThe Chinese film industry has become a vital center for global film and media activity. As Hollywood aims to co-produce with Chinese companies to gain access to its lucrative market, China continues to grow its robust domestic movie industry. Sharing his insight into this phenomenon, Eric Lin (alumnus of UO’s School of Journalism and Communication, 1997) will participate in the Cinema Pacific Global Producers Forum.\n\nAs Senior Manager of Film Production at Bona Film Group, the largest privately owned film distributor in China, Lin brings years of film experience working in Hong Kong and Beijing. Lin’s work involves working on China and Hong Kong legal agreements, coordinating day-to-day operations including various film projects’ production and payment schedules, and reviewing shooting scripts and English production notes and subtitling.He recently helped shepherd Taking of Tiger Mountain, the latest blockbuster film by director Tsui Hark, who revolutionized the “wuxia” film in the Nineties (Hark’s Once Upon a Time in China screens in Cinema Pacific on April 29). Join us for talk and conversation with Lin, which will be moderated by Daniel Steinhart, Assistant Professor of Cinema and Media.\n\nWUXIA CINEMA AFTER CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON\n\nA talk by Dr. Kin-Yan Szeto\n\n3:00 p.m. Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art\n\nFree\n\nThe wuxia genre had attracted great interest and investment in China when Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) became an international box-office hit and won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. This presentation will look at how wuxia films made after 2000 navigate the demands of commercial entertainment and the promotion of Chinese culture and nationalism. Dr. Kin-yan Szeto, associate professor in the Department of Theater and Dance at Appalachian State University, is the author of Martial Arts Cinema of the Chinese Diaspora, a study of the international films of Ang Lee, John Woo, and Jackie Chan.\n\nFRINGE FESTIVAL PREVIEW\n\n5:30–8:00 p.m. Broadway Commerce Center, 44 West Broadway in Eugene\n\nFree\n\nCatch a preview of video works by artists who will unveil installations and performances at Saturday night’s Fringe Festival. Media artist Violet Ray, animator Joanna Priestley, and street artists Hyland Mather and Amanda Marie will project works interspersed with video remixes of martial arts classic A Touch of Zen submitted to the Fringe Festival competition. Also on display will be an exhibit of new prints by UO art students. Meet the artists, preview their work, grab food and drinks at the adjoining Barn Light, then join us at the JSMA on Saturday night for the Fringe Festival extravaganza!\n\nTRANSIT\n\n6:45 p.m. Bijou Art Cinemas\n\nTickets: $6 students/seniors, $8 general public\n\nThis powerful debut feature from Filipino director Hannah Espia explores the intersecting stories of Filipinos in Tel Aviv when the threat of a law deporting the children of migrant workers looms over their precarious lives. Janet (Adlawan), a domestic worker on an expired visa, struggles to hide her half-Israeli daughter, Yael (Curtis-Smith)—a rebellious teenager caught up in a juvenile romance. Most endangered in the situation is Janet’s four-year old nephew, Joshua (Alvarez), whom Janet and Yael watch over because the boy’s father, Moises (Medina), must work out of town during the week as a caregiver.\n\nTransit is told through multiple characters’ perspectives, producing a multilinear effect in which certain scenes are repeated to reveal different facets of their situations. Oggs Cruz of Twitchfilm describes the film as “a document of fractured identities, an essay that declares the very familiar concepts of citizenship and nationality as shallow facades that are maintained by laws and enforced by borders.” Transit won a slew of Filipino film accolades, among them the Gawad Urian Award and the Golden Screen Award. It was also selected by the Philippines as the official submission for the 2014 Oscar best foreign language film category.\n\nBALIKBAYAN #1 (aka MEMORIES OF OVERDEVELOPMENT)\n\nWith director Kidlat Tahimik\n\n7:00 p.m., Whitsell Auditorium in the Portland Art Museum, Portland\n\nSee here for details. Presented with the Northwest Film Center.\n\nCROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON\n\nWith an introduction by Dr. Kin-yan Szeto\n\n9:15 p.m. Bijou Metro, 43 West Broadway in Eugene\n\nTickets: $6 students/seniors, $8 general public"
