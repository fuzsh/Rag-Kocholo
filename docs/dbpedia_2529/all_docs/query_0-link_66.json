        "text": "Stanley - To me , being a 1gen student is... Anamaria - Everything is a little bit harder... Jennifer - A great privilege but also being help to a higher responsibility... Travis - There is not a lot of room for error Destin - I’m the second person ever in my high school to go to an Ivy league school Kim - it means that I am ABLE TO DO AS WELL AS MY PEERS WHO HAVE HAD BETTER RESOURCES THAN I HAD. Stanley - Sort of like a blessing and a curse HEADLINE INTERSTITIAL - VOICES MAKING FRIENDS AT BROWN WAS A BIT DIFFICULT because I ‘ve never been surrounded by people THAT RICH IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. because you are sort of wondering - what do I have in common with those people? Do I truly belong????” STANLEY - I do feel that 1gen students need support that’s different from the support that’s typically offered to students. They haven’t been to a college before. THERE IS A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE KNOW. “That we know how to o and talk to professors, that we know how to use office hours, that we know...that our parents know everything that’s going on “because so much of my life is about going to classes, those esoteric authors that my family isn’t used talking about. ” NATPOP - Stanley’s teacher in class talking about Power and Marxist economy etc Stanley: OFTEN WHEN I CALL HOME THE ONLY TOPIC I CAN TALK ABOUT IS - HOW IS THE WEATHER. NATPOP - Stanley talking about “discourse on liberation” in class Stanley “On the other hand, there are time where I feel really proud, when I CALL MY MOM BACK HOME AND SAY - YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT. THIS KID DOESN’T KNOW HOW TO DO THEIR LAUNDRY. How do you go so long without knowing how to do your own laundry?” That’s what makes me proud - “I KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF, AND THAT’S WHAT MY FAMILY TAUGHT ME TO DO. ” INTERSTITIAL - VOICES Destin: In some ways I’M PRIVILEDGED AS A 1gen student because I’m WHITE. BUT CLASS PRVILEDGE IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ISSUE. BEING 1gen AND BEING GAY MEANS I’M COMING FROM A BACKGROUND THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS AREn’t. “IF YOU DON’T LOOK LIKE OTHER STUDENTS AT BROWN, IT’S NOT LIKE YOU’re GOING TO BE REJECTED IN ANY WAY, Brown is a great campus full of great students, but the thing is YOUR CLOTHES SHAPE YOUR SENCE OF SELF AND YOUR SELF-CONFIDENCE. ” And that was a process that was very difficult for me in terms of finding money for what I wanted to look, how I wanted to present myself. ” I had to get a job on campus pretty quickly “The university had to offer help in my junior year, because I needed a suit, but I didn’t have access to money to buy that suit. ...It’s a really hard ordeal. “TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO EVERYONE AROUND WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONFIDENCE, YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO BE CONFIDENT WITH THE WAY YOU LOOK INTERSTITIAL - VOICES Anamaria “WHEN I COMPARE MYSELF WITH MOST OF STUDENTS AT BROWN, sometimes I GET ANGRY AT THEM. “WHEN THEY COMPLAIN THAT THEY ARE REALLY BUSY HERE, and eveyone is very busy here, and I think - WELL, YOU DON’t have to work. They ARE BUSY IMPROVING THEIR RESUMES, you know. ” My first job was a food server at the so called Dining services. When I was making salads, my dorm mates were AT THE SCIENCES LIBRARY, they were finishing their projects in chemistry. “So you have to catch up, learn how to talk, like professionals want you to talk. To not mention certain things. ” I’m originally from Colombia, my family moved here when I was 6 and my sister was 8 “If I try to conceal my 1gen identity, I don’t mention work, I don’t mention my family life really. NATPOP - Dean of Brown School of Professional Studies asking Anamaria during the seminar - “Where Are you from? Anamaria - ah, New Jersey” If they ask me where I am from, I say - New Jersey - because anyone could be from New Jersey. ” NATPOP - Dean of Brown School of Professional Studies asking Anamaria during the seminar - “There are a lot of Students from New York and New Jersey” OR “Does it make you a Giants fan.” Anamaria: “SOMETIMES I AVOID TELLING PROFESSORS ABOUT MY BACKGROUND. I DON’t want to feel like a burdain, and I DON’t WANT THEM TO PITY ME, BECAUSE I THINK I’M REALLY CAPABLE. SO I OFTEN ACT LIKE I’m LIKE ANY OTHER STUDENT THAT GOES HERE.” Stanley IvyG started as a project between friends who wanted to explore what dies it mean to be a 1gen college student It’S ACTUALLY PRETTY SURPRISING TO SEE HOW MUCH IVYG has grown <...> from a group of 3 students... NATPOP - Conference opening party - “Are we still good here” ... now to the conference that’s spanning all across the Ivy League NATPOP - music/conference registration Transition into a lecture during the conference NATPOP- “You can always learn about Renaissance painters, but you can’t always LEARN the values that you guys have” Stanley The one thingI hope people get out of the conference is the feeling that they’re not alone, because they aren’t. TRANSITION -MUSIC CHANGE VOXPOP Jennifer, Stanford alumni: I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME I TOLD MY MOM ABOUT A JOB THAT I GOT ON CAMPUS, I was making around 14-15 dollars an hour, AND SHE WAS SHOCKED THAT I WAS ALREADY MAKING WHAT TOOK HER YEARS TO MAKE. Liliana, Brown, freshman: MY GRANDMA I LEARNED WAS ILLITERATE, AND KNOWING HOW FAR MY FAMILY HAS COME FROM THAT IS VERY VERY HUMBLING. Stanley “EVER SINCE I WAS A FRESHMAN, I WAS SAVING UP FOR MY MOM’s plane ticket here. ” None of my family has ever been here. Has actually never been able to afford visit Brown. SO PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME THEY’LL BE ABLE TO VISIT THIS CAMPUS IS WHEN I GRADUATE. I DON’t KNOW IF EVERYONE NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THEIR LIFE IN COLLEGE THIS WAY. Mandeep, Columbia senior: It’s a reality that those institutions were CREATED BY WHITE PEOPLE AND FOR WHITE PEOPLE, AT THE TIME, SO YEAH, white privilege it does exist, BUT NOW THAT YOUR HAVE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND 1GEN FOLKS COMING TO THOSE SCHOOLS IN LARGE NUMBERS, THAT PRIVILEDGE IS BEING CHALLENED. Travis - YALE What makes me most proud is the empathy I have, which I think, is one of the big issues in AMERICA - THERE IS AN EMPATHY GAP. And it puts me in a unique position where I can push for change that needs to happen."
