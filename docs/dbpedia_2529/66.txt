The Bad Boy and The Tomboy is now published as a Wattpad Book! As a Wattpad reader, you can access both the Original Edition and Books Edition upon purchase. Nicknames, a love of soccer, and school rumors are all the bad boy and the tomboy have in common. But if they give each other a chance, will they find something more? ***** Seventeen-year-old Macy Anderson is a tomboy that plays soccer, hangs with the guys, can't stand girls (except her best friend Jasmine) and doesn't know who Sam Cahill is. But when the pair unexpectedly meet, everything goes downhill from there. Because Sam Cahill is the school's bad boy, known for skipping classes and getting into trouble. Not to mention his cocky attitude, British accent, and magnetic charm, which seems to work on all the girls -- except Macy, who has a rule not date in high school. But when Sam starts showing her his moves (on and off the soccer field), Macy begins to see a different guy under the leather-clad exterior. Will that be enough to convince her that he's the one guy worth breaking the rules for? [[Word count: 300,000 - 350,000 words]] [[2015 Watty Winner]] All Rights Reserved- ©nikki20038
