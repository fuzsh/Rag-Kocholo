        "text": "Dr. Moura is an Associate Professor of Marine Biology at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBiography from his website:\n\nI was born in São Paulo (1972) and was raised in Santos, a beautiful coastal city in São Paulo State, Brazil, where I first learned to dive, to sail, and to get angry with what we are doing to the Ocean - thanks to my father, one of the pioneers of SCUBA diving in Brazil. I went back to São Paulo in 1996 and got a PhD Degree in Zoology from the Universidade de São Paulo (USP) in 2003. During this period at USP I had the chance to dive along most of my country's coast, collecting and counting reef fishes, seeing its beauty and drama. At that point I felt I needed to learn marine conservation by doing it, and worked for Conservation International for almost a decade, where I lead the Brazil Node of the Marine Management Areas Science Program and managed their field station in Abrolhos, the region that hosts the highest marine biodiversity in the South Atlantic. In 2010 I went back to the academia as a Visiting Professor at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz (UESC) in Ilhéus, Bahia, where I still teach and advise graduate students. In December 2011 the Moura family moved to Rio de Janeiro, as I started working as an Associate Professor at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, one of Latin America's largest universities, where I advise undergaduate and graduate students. Together with a team of students and co-workers from all over the world, I am currently engaged in several projects and outreach initiatives that are described in this website, which is also aimed at spreading the results of our work."
