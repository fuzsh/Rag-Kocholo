        "text": "Brazilian jazz great and Latin Grammy winner Paulo Moura has died after a fight against cancer.\n\nA spokeswoman at the Sao Vicente clinic in Rio de Janeiro said Tuesday that Moura died late the night before. He was in the clinic receiving treatment for lymphoma. She spoke on condition of anonymity as she was not authorized to discuss the case.\n\nThe 77-year-old clarinet player was famed for his versatility as well as his virtuosity and he ranged across Brazilian folk music, jazz and classical orchestral music.\n\nHe won a Latin Grammy in 2000 for the best Brazilian roots album and was nominated but did not win in 2004 for best Latin instrumental album.\n\nIn 1962, he played with Sergio Mendes’ group at the historic Bossa Nova night at Carnegie Hall that helped launched the genre’s mass appeal.\n\nMoura was considered by many critics to be one of Brazil’s greatest instrumentalist."
