        "text": "Antônio Moura was born in 1963 in Belém, capital of the state of Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon. After periods living in São Paulo and Lisbon, he has now returned to Belém. Four collections of his poetry, and three of his translations, have been published: his collections Dez (1996), Hong Kong & outros poemas (1999), Rio Silêncio (2004) and A sombra da ausência (2009), and his translations of Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, Quase-sonhos (2004) and Traduzido Da Noite / Traduit De La Nuit (2009), and of César Vallejo, Contra o segredo profissional (2005). Antônio Moura’s poems have also appeared in many Brazilian journals and newspapers, as well as in a number of contemporary anthologies in Brazil and abroad, including Nothing the Sun Could Not Explain: 20 Contemporary Brazilian Poets (2nd edition; 2003). He is currently being translated into Spanish, Catalan, German, and English. Earlier versions of some translations in this collection have appeared in the UK journals Shearsman and Modern Poetry in Translation, as well as in Crossing / Travessia, a pamphlet from the São Paulo small press Arqueria Editorial."
