It was only 3 years later, by his father’s influence, that Moura joined a local Gracie Barra jiu-jitsu school, during his 2009 school holiday.\n\nVitorio “Furão” was Italo Moura’s first grappling coach at the aforementioned Gracie Barra affiliate. The young athlete would later switch to the Academia Núcleo gym, where he worked under the guidance of Rhuando Cavalcante, earning his blue belt from Cavalcante.\n\nBy the time Italo was a blue belt, a few of his higher-ranked teammates opened a “PSLPB Cicero Costha” school affiliate, and Italo followed their lead, working with coach Mauricio Antunes, as well as Rafael Naves, Willian Von Sohsten, Aquila Lanza, Ramon Delsin and Higor Paterra at this new gym.\n\nIt was through this connection that Moura met and befriended the legendary instructor Cicero Costha, particularly thanks to Rafael Naves, who took Moura to São Paulo for a competition in 2012. Naves and Italo stayed at Cicero’s team headquarters for a few days, training in preparation for the said tournament, an event that propelled Italo to seek a life as a professional grappler. Fueled by his first stay at the PSLPB Academy, Moura returned to train there with every chance he had, particularly during prolonged public-school holidays. After Moura finished high-school, he decided to move to the state capital, São Paulo, to become a full-time athlete under a scholarship with Cicero.\n\nAlthough not part of the team, the Cicero Costha had a long-standing friendship with black belt Murilo Santana, as he and the team’s leader trained in the same team for many years. During one of Santana’s frequent training sessions at the PSLPB headquarters, Italo met the well-known competitor and, soon to be, founder of the Unity Jiu-Jitsu Academy in New York, USA.\n\nIn 2016 Italo started doing his training camps at Santana’s NYC gym, ahead of any the major tournaments in the America circuit. Having a solid base from where to train while preparing for the biggest tournaments in the sport, was a key asset in Moura’s development, who, after a series of strong performances as a brown belt, was promoted to black belt by coaches Murilo Santana and Cicero Costha, on June 2019.\n\nItalo Moura NoGi Highlight"
