        "text": "Dear Forum Members,\n\nBack in february 2002 I enjoyed a performance of the late Brazilian sax/clarinet player Paulo Moura and his band in Amsterdam in february 2002.\n\nPaulo Moura a former member of Sergio Mendes Bossa Rio Sextet in the early 1960’s played on this event amongst 3 other unknown musicians with another member of Sergio’s Brasil 77 group, percussionist extraordinaire Laudir Oliviera Soares (later a member of supergroup Chicago). Great Concert...\n\nThe concert concept was exclusively work of the Brazilian Choro composer,arranger, flautist and sax player\n\nAlfredo da Rocha Viana Filhos, better known as Pixinguinha.\n\nVirtuoso flautist Pixinguinha played the genres Choro, Samba, Waltz and Brazilian Jazz, his musical style had a great influence on Jobim, Ary Barrosa Dorival Caymmi and countless other Brazilian musicians.\n\nPixinguinha lived from april 23 1897 till February 7, 1973. He toured Europe in 1922.\n\nHis well known composition ‘Carinhoso’ and especially the recording of Cellist Yo-Yo Ma is a\n\nbreathtaking high quality peace along with Paquita Rivera on clarinet, Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista, and Brazilian Romero Lubambo on acoustic guitar.\n\nAll the best,\n\nAqua do Brasil (AKA Sjef Nix)"
