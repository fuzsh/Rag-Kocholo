        "text": "In 2015, he landed the role of Pablo Escobar in the Netflix series \"Narcos.\" Though he earned many accolades throughout the show's three seasons, including a Golden Globe nomination, Moura has also been candid about the toll the performance took on him physically and mentally.\n\n\"I got rid of the weight of Pablo Escobar, but the energy somehow is in your body, the way you move,\" he tells Business Insider. \"I don't know. It's hard to explain, but it's still there. And with Joel, it was the same thing.\"\n\nAhead of the theatrical release of \"Civil War,\" Moura spoke to BI about the film's harrowing warzone sequences, the most emotional scene to film, and how he's navigated his international breakthrough.\n\nThis is an intense film — particularly the entire third act. Did it take a toll on you during filming, feeling like you were in an actual warzone?\n\nYeah. It felt very real because Alex, that was his goal — to make the film as immersive as possible, both to the actors and to the audiences.\n\nSo all that noise that you were hearing in the third act, we were hearing it while we were all shooting it. He used full rounds. So it was very, very, very noisy and it really made you feel that you were in the middle of a battle.\n\nYou said in another interview that other actors wore earplugs during those explosion sequences and you chose not to. How is your hearing doing now?\n\nRelated stories\n\nHorrible. I can't hear anything. [laughs] No, I was supposed to do it for safety reasons. That's something that I was asked to do, but I kind of took it off because I wanted to be as immersed as possible.\n\nI read that most of the performers around you in those warzone sequences were actual military veterans.\n\nThat's right. Many Navy SEALs. They would say things to us to make us move. They were like, \"Get the fuck out of this. Stay here. Come on.\" They would guide us in a way that was very organic and real.\n\nI want to talk about that very tense scene where Joel and the others encounter Jesse Plemons' character, the xenophobic soldier who threatens them. What was it like working alongside Jesse and your costar Kirsten Dunst together in that scene, given that they're married in real life?\n\nThey were very professional, and they gave each other lots of space, I remember that day.\n\nFor me personally, that was the most difficult scene emotionally — me being an immigrant and having to hear that kind of thing over and over again: \"What kind of American are you?\" Which is kind of the core of the movie — the polarization also brings all its demons with it, racism, xenophobia, all that. It was a very hard scene for me to play.\n\nDid it resonate on a personal level for you with anything that you'd experienced in your own life?\n\nYes, of course. I'm an American citizen, but I was born in Brazil. I grew up in Brazil. I've been living here for less than 10 years only. And I always thought about, how would I react if I was somewhere and someone would see me speaking with this accent and go like, \"What are you doing here? What's your business here?\"\n\nI don't know what I would do. Would I react violently? Would I say something back? Would I just go? I don't know.\n\nThat uncertainty really hit me in that scene with Jesse. My character Joel is the character in the film that has the word as a weapon — he's the writer, he can speak. But slowly, slowly, slowly, all his repertoire of words just disappears because of facing that amount of violence and prejudice.\n\nOne of the most intense scenes for me was right after that, in the car when Joel and Cailee Spaeny's character Jessie are both screaming and hyperventilating. How did you get into that mindset, and how did you get out of it after?\n\nThe whole mass grave scene took us two days to shoot. It was very intense, very hardcore like I said. The last day, I laid down. I was exhausted and I cried, and I just let it go. And then we started shooting other scenes because we shot the film in chronological order. So we were shooting something else already.\n\nAnd then Alex said, \"We should go back there, just you and Cailee, and I think we need some reactions of you guys in the back of the car.\" So I was like, oh, I'll have to go back to that.\n\nThey put the cameras in the car and we spoke with Alex briefly and it was just Cailee and I there. The good thing about shooting in order is that you have the memory of what happened. You have the real memory of what just happened. So I just try to connect again with that feeling.\n\nBefore this, you were known for playing Pablo Escobar in \"Narcos.\" You put yourself through the wringer in a different way in that show — you've talked about how you had to put on 40 pounds for that and how it really took a toll on your body. Would you ever do that sort of physical transformation again for a role?\n\nNo, no. No, that was too much. It was too much. I gained 40 pounds. No, my health was destroyed after that and I'm not willing to do that again. No.\n\nDid you find it more difficult getting out of the mindset of Pablo Escobar after \"Narcos\" or Joel after \"Civil War\"?\n\nIt was similar. I think they were very similar situations. I keep saying this, but it's not in your mind. It's not rational. These things, somehow they're still here.\n\nI got rid of the weight of Pablo Escobar, but the energy somehow is in your body, the way you move. I don't know. It's hard to explain, but it's still there. And with Joel, it was the same thing.\n\nBut the antidote for that, I think, is to be with people that you love. And jump to another project and do something else.\n\nYou had a long and successful career in Brazil for many years before \"Narcos.\" Did you find it hard to advocate for yourself and for your worth in Hollywood when you crossed over to the international sphere?\n\nThat's a good question. I tend to act very — I don't want to say politically, but to advocate for what I believe. I don't want to do anything that would be a stereotype of Latinos. And that's hard, because things are getting better, but I think that Hollywood is still full of stereotypes. It still is. It's getting better.\n\nBut I want to go for the same characters that white American actors are going for, because I represent a big part of this country too, as an immigrant, as a Latin American person. So we are not only the drug dealers, the bad guys, or the sexy Latinas. We can be journalists, war journalists, or doctors or engineers or whatever, or something that's not at all connected to the way I speak or the way I look. So that's a political position that I've been having here, but I'm happy with it. It makes sense to who I am and the way I carry myself.\n\n\"Civil War\" is in theaters April 12."
