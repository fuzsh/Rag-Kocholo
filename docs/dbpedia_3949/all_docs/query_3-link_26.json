        "text": "Marianna is a fairly nice place to live if you're already well established in your career or looking to retire. It is a small community with a bit of a slow pace to it. Nice, laid back, friendly atmosphere overall.\n\nIt is better for older folks, as this is not a good town for starting career prospects. The economy is quite poor; many young adults have jobs that pay only $11/h.\n\nThere is NO \"night life\" as to speak of. There is really only one bar, and it is new. Aside from that, most establishments in town close early.\n\nThat being said, it has essentially everything you'll need: A handful of excellent local restaurants, a lot of cheap fast food options, a couple gyms, plenty of outdoor recreation opportunities, spas, boutiques, dollar stores, groceries, and a Walmart.\n\nHowever, the local hospital is absolutely horrible! Be mindful of that.\n\nMarianna is a nice place to stay, have fun and explore all the opportunities it has to offer. I would like to see the rent level go down, but inflation is happening so I donâ€™t think it will go down. I would also like to see more places to shop for clothes."
