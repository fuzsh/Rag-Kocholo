One respondent said, “This is a sex offender, drop-out, and check-in yard.”\n\nLevel of Violence\n\nThere is minimal violence at this prison, though there are some fights. One inmate said, “For the most part, this is a safe yard except for the drop-out druggies fighting amongst themselves over debts and drugs.”\n\nAnother concurred, stating, “There is very little violence. That which does occur is centered around drug use and drug bills.”\n\nAnother Marianna federal prison inmate explained that the violence is getting worse “due to the drugs and what comes with them.” One respondent said he would “rate the safety at roughly an 8 out of 10.”\n\nVulnerable Populations\n\nSex offenders, informants, and LGBT inmates can stay. According to one inmate, “They are all safe here.”\n\nAnother inmate stated, “Sex offenders, informants, gays, and transgender people are all allowed to walk here. There is a pretty high population of transgender and gay inmates.”\n\nOne respondent noted that “staff sometimes discriminate against sex offenders regarding employment, medical, and commissary.”\n\nGood at FCI Marianna Federal Prison\n\n“Great recreation department. Good chapel and psychology services.” “The scenery and landscape are great.” “Good food and medical care.” “Safe, calm yard; nothing is going on.”\n\nBad at FCI Marianna Prison\n\n“Staff disrespectful, poor commissary selection, and bad food.” “Pay is crap all over; nothing going on.”\n\n“Overall, fine for anyone. Lots of sex offenders, so a very soft yard.” “The federal prison in Marianna, FL, is generally horrible.”\n\n“Overall, the Marianna Florida prison is a nice yard, fairly slow-paced and somewhat boring at times, just the place to finish a bid.”\n\n“Lack of politics means the staff have free reign and sometimes make off-the-wall proclamations that nobody stands up against.” “It’s safe to a point but getting worse due to all the drugs.”\n\nFCI Marianna in the News\n\nIn June 2012, Steven M.
