It is a favorite kyaking, canoeing and tubing spot for youth, especially college students, from all over the Florida Panhandle.\n\nIt is only a short drive from Marianna to other great outdoors spots such as Three Rivers State Park, Ocheessee Pond, the Apalachicola River, and, of course, Panama City Beach and surrounding beaches.\n\nThere are several historical sites in or near Marianna, including the St. Luke Baptist Church, The First Bank Building, L&N Railroad Depot, The White (Stone) Hotel, the Marianna Post Office, St. Lukes’s Episcopal Church, the Russ House, and many more.\n\nThe center of the town’s community activities is Madison Street Park.
