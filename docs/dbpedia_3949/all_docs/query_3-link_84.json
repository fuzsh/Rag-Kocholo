This helps us provide public information on this website.\n\nExploring Marianna\n\nBest known as the location of Florida Caverns State Park, Florida’s only show cave, Marianna is one of the larger communities along Interstate 10 west of the Apalachicola River.\n\nThis area is healing after the devastation of Hurricane Michael in October 2018. Its parks and forests will never look quite the same.\n\nBut there are many public lands to explore. Paddlers, swimmers, and divers will appreciate the beauty of Jackson Blue Spring (open seasonally) and Merritts Mill Pond.\n\nThe underground wonders of Florida Caverns were not affected by hurricane damage, although the park no longer is home to a lush forest.\n\nThe Florida Trail passes south of Marianna across the northern extent of Calhoun County, following roadwalks on back roads between Blountstown and Econfina Creek WMA.\n\nAlong this very rural segment, the Altha section provides a view of the Look-and-Tremble rapids of the Chipola River when water levels are just right.\n\nTrails and Parks near Marianna\n\nAngus Gholson Nature Park Above the Apalachicola River, the community of Chattahoochee hides a natural treasure in its deep ravines—a park named for its native son, botanist Angus Gholson.\n\nBaltzell Spring Made up of liquid pools of beauty on the edge of Florida Caverns State Park, Baltzell Spring is a compelling destination for spring hunters along the Chipola River in Marianna.\n\nBellamy Bridge Heritage Trail A shady trail leads deep into the Chipola River swamp to an eerie bridge, where it is said the spirit of Elizabeth Bellamy ceaselessly searches the banks looking for a long-lost love.\n\nBlue Springs Recreation Area With a developed swimming area surrounding a first-magnitude spring, Blue Springs Recreation Area is a liquid playground in hues of blue, a broad open basin pouring forth a major spring run.\n\nDry Creek Trail In the folded uplands above Lake Seminole, the Dry Creek Trail leads hikers along an interpretive loop through rugged terrain where alluvial streams cut deep gashes through the slopes\n\nEagle Trail A loop atop the ridges standing above Lake Seminole, the Eagle Trail offers a different perspective on the uplands of Three Rivers State Park\n\nFalling Waters Sinkhole Trail Iconic as the home of Florida’s tallest waterfall, Falling Waters State Park is a showcase for Florida geology just south of I-10 in Chipley. Follow the Sinkhole Trail to see the waterfall and some very deep sinkholes.\n\nFalling Waters State Park Geology is the focus of Falling Waters State Park, which sits atop a tall ridge south of Chipley.\n\nFlorida Caverns Sinkhole Trail Starting near the campground at the north end of Florida Caverns State Park, a simple loop trail provides views of Sugar Mill Run and access to seasonally available trails leading to the Chipola River.\n\nFlorida Caverns State Park A dip into Florida’s only show cave brings on an instant sense of cool. But the cave tour isn't the only delight you'll find at Florida Caverns State Park.\n\nFlorida Caverns Trail System Rugged karst topography, showy spring wildflowers, and Florida's only hike through a cave make this showy loop atop Florida Caverns a compelling hike.\n\nFlorida Trail, Altha 1.7 miles. Following Bauldree Branch to the bluffs of the Chipola River, the Altha section of the Florida Trail is a fabulous destination for spring wildflowers.\n\nFlorida Trail, Central Panhandle 99.5 miles. West of the Apalachicola River, the Florida Trail stitches a series of public lands together along the corridor of the Northwest Florida Greenway.\n\nFlorida Trail, Econfina Creek 18.4 miles. Winding along rolling hillsides north of Panama City, the Econfina Creek section of the Florida Trail offers a challenging hike with stunning views of its namesake creek.\n\nGarden of Eden Trail Try one of Florida's toughest day hikes on for size: local legend has it this was the Garden of Eden, and from the lush forests and rare flora along this trek, they might be on to something.\n\nHinson Conservation and Recreation Area A network of wide trails explores rugged karst topography alongside the Chipola River at Hinson Conservation and Recreation Area, including a cave large enough to climb inside.\n\nLakeview Trail Enjoy views of Lake Seminole from forested slopes on the 2.5 mile loop created by the Lakeview Trail and the Ridge Trail at Three Rivers State Park at Sneads\n\nMerritt’s Mill Pond The astounding hues of spring-fed Merritt's Mill Pond make it a compelling destination for paddling and diving.\n\nSpring Creek Park A gentle boardwalk leads to the crystalline waters of Spring Creek at Spring Creek Park in Marianna.\n\nThree Rivers State Park Hugging the state line with Georgia at Lake Seminole - the reservoir behind the dam where the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers form the Apalachicola - Three Rivers State Park is a prime getaway for anglers\n\nTorreya Hiking Trail One of the most rugged hikes in Florida, the Torreya Hiking Trail treats you to an scenic landscape of ravines and bluffs rising 300 feet above the Apalachicola River.\n\nTorreya State Park Perched on bluffs above the Apalachicola River, Torreya State Park is one of Florida’s first state parks, developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s\n\nTorreya Weeping Ridge Trail A short though challenging hike the Weeping Ridge Trail offers unusual views for the state of Florida, crossing tall ridges and ending at a small waterfall.\n\nArticles\n\nSpring Hopping Around Tallahassee Between Madison and Marianna and across Wakulla County, explore a colorful collection of natural springs for swimming and snorkeling, all within an hour of Tallahassee.\n\nBoulders and blossoms at Florida Caverns Looking for a compelling wildflower walk?
