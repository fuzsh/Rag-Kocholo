I have a version of it that was printed in a magazine or newspaper, but I'll have to dig it out. It's also mentioned in my book The Green Family of Jackson County Florida on p. 55.\n\nThe town was originally called Allison. Uncle \"Bud\" Nichols (James Wylie Nichols 1870-1946) ran a general store there. The store is still standing at the cross roads of Green Road and 69 A, SW corner. At least, I know Bud owned that store, and I have assumed it was the same one. Supposedly, the name of Two Egg was coined by drummers (salesmen) who came to the store and observed customers bartering for two eggs worth of tobacco, snuff, sugar, flour, candy, or whatever. The salesmen dubbed it a \"two-egg town,\" and the name stuck My dad was born near there. The area of Two Egg seems to have been quite populated by the Hamilton, Nichols and Dykes families--the three husbands of Rebecca Hewett.\n\nI would certainly be interested to hear any other versions of the name Two Egg.\n\nCynthia Green Dean\n\n23 Aug 1999\n\nStory # 2\n\nMy grandmother, Ruth McClain Sasser, told me this: Her father , James McClain, married his last and much younger wife, Malzie Davis. Grandma Malzie was the only mother my gm could remember. After the death of James McClain, Grandma Malzie married Jim White. They lived at Two Egg. This is the story I was told:\n\nA rolling store stopped at the intersection now known as \"Two Egg.\" It was the habit of the local children to bring 2 eggs to trade for a candy bar. In time, kids would say \" where you goin?\" \"I'm going to 2 egg.....\"\n\nI remeember going there when I was about 7 years old. Would love to hear if my story is not right.\n\nDeborah Sasser Isaza\n\nStory # 3\n\nThe graphic really should come from one of the Two egg tee-shirts if they still sell them at the store! Anyone live close enough to run down to the store and see if they still have the Two Egg tee shirt? I got one a couple of years ago but my son took off with it and left me his Alaska Weather tee.\n\nMy Dad tells a different version of the name story. He claims that the town was named by the traveling preacher that used to come through. The store (supposedly according to my Dad) would give 2 eggs to the family that was \"hosting\" the preacher (putting him up for the night). The preacher was heard to say (in a neighboring town) \"My next stop is that 2 Egg town.\"\n\nHey, Betty, maybe we should start a Two Egg Web Ring...all of us with a connection to Two Egg could be in the ring. that would be fun!! Maybe we could create a map and all of us that own land in Two Egg could have our land marked on the map!\n\nAny more Two Egg ideas? Light and Love to all... Nancy B (Nancy G. Bellucci)\n\nStory # 4\n\nBetty: during the Vietnam War a military unit out of Yokoto Ab, Japan went to \"Tachale(?spelling) Thialand\" the advance crew went in from Yokoto to get the runway ready for the planes as it had not been used since WWII. at the end of the runway was a sign that said \"10,050 mile to Two Egg, Florida\". Gail Stephens\n\nStory # 5\n\nFlorida A&M University\n\nHow Two Egg Got its name\n\nby\n\nRoy W Russell\n\nSYD 3600 Community Structure and Analysis\n\nInstructor: Linda Nixon Hudson\n\nApril 6, 1988\n\nHow Two Egg Got its Name\n\nThe Jackson county courthouse has no records of when the town changed its name.\n\nThere are more theories about the town name than there are residents.\n\nListed below are several versions of how the town got its name.\n\n--They dropped two eggs in the road and changed the town name.\n\n--A woman sent a child to the store. He had two eggs and spent the two eggs for a weasel of snuff.\n\n-- The first sale at the store was two eggs for breakfast.\n\n--A legend about a man in the area, a long time ago, who supposedly had fiftyseven children.\n\n--A legend about a grumpy store owner and some bartering children. (1)\n\nThere are several stories about Two Egg, which lies northeast of Marianna, FL, but it is best not to claim that you know the most accurate vesion.\n\nPeople get into terrible fights about it.\" (2)\n\nA lot of people wnt to know how Two Egg came by its unusual name.\n\nMany people look for the answer in one of the town's two general stores, located near each other in northeast Jackson County, FL.\n\nOne of the store owners, Caret Lawrence, tells visitors when Bill Allen, his granddaddy, owned a grocery store there a long time ago, there was a man, Will Williams, who had fortysix children by three wives.\n\nWay back then, he didn't have any money to give them. Nobody had any money. It was during the depression. Will Williams had more chickens than he had children, and his children used the hen's eggs for barter. Back in those days, drummers (traveling salesmen), came around to the stores and Will's little boys would come in with two eggs to exchange for candy. As a surprised salesman might do, one stepped back and said, \"We'll just call this Two Egg.\"\n\nSome say the drummers, the traveling salesman, used to mark down the stores orders as coming from \"Two Egg Crossroad\" and it all stemmed from that. Folks just forgot about the name Allison and Two Egg evolved. (5)\n\nIn the 1800's, the community of Allison ws founded around the towns sawmill. Mr. Edward Hamilton worked in the sawmill as a boy and tells this story: Mr Hamiltonbelieves the name stemmed as a result of a \"panic\" during the persidential administration of Grover Cleveland. In those days, people traded farm produce at the village store for flour, meal and other staple groceries. Henry Grubb, a bachelor who ran that community store, who was short on patience, would \"vent his spleen\" on the Negro children when they came in with one or two eggs to trade for a loaf of bread, some meal or side meat. One day, two young ladies were in the store when Mr. Grubb exploded with the statement, \" I'm getting tired of having to get up every now and then to trade in two eggs for groceries. The two ladies pinned the name of Two Egg on Henry Grubb to pester him and as a consequence the name of Allison soon became know as Two Egg. (16)\n\nMr Grubb said, \"Two Eggs! Two Eggs! If you don't stop pestering me for two eggs, I'm gonna snatch you baldheaded.\"\n\nThere are many stories circulated about the way Allison School community lost its identity and became know as Two Egg. The following version has been handed down through four generations of the Bevis family which lived in Allison or as we prefer, Two Egg.\n\nThe community is believed to have been settled around 1860. Thomas R Bevis, who built the first general store there in 1875, migrated from Quincy. In those days, batering was the method of exchange. About 1905, a dirt farmer named Will Williams, started raising a family about a quater of a mile from Tom Bevis' store.\n\nAll that he was able to give his children was a hen when they attained the age of six. Whatever eggs these produced, became the kids' spending money.\n\nOne child spending his eggs doesn't sound like much, but Will Williams sired fiftyseven \"young'uns\" by eleven wives before his death in the mid-fifties.\n\nSeldom did the children have over two eggs at a time to buy anything and the drummers often commented on the two egg purchases, say \"this won't ever be nothin' but a two egg town.\" The name stuck. (15)\n\nThe two brothers opened a country store here and they didn't know what to call the place until a youngster came in carrying two eggs and told them, \"Mamma says send her one eggs worth of bladder snuff and one egg's worth of ball potash.\" (14)\n\nWill Williams' Story (12)\n\nWill Williams' Story (9)\n\nWill Williams' Story (6)\n\nWill Williams' Story (4)\n\nBill Bevis' Story (3)\n\nNo reference to name orgin (7,8,11 &13)\n\nBibliography\n\n1.

Edmon worked at the sawmill as a kid and is also a great uncle of mine. His father, M.L. (Mealy Hamilton) was one of the many sons of Rebecca Hewett. Rebecca married Levi Hamilton in 1857. He went to fight in the 6th FL Infantry and died at Camp Chase Ohio in 1865. Rebecca went on to marry James Nichols and then William Dykes. Mealy ran the store that is currently operated by the King's. Mealy's half-brother James \"Bud\" Nichols ran the store across the street from it. I guess you could say Rebecca made a big contribution to the population of Two Egg. My mother Carol, daughter of Kenneth Hamilton, remembers driving through Two Egg as a little girl in the 1950's on a family vacation. A caravan of cars made the trip from St. Pete, FL and included Kenny and his family, Mildred and her family, Lorraine and her family, and their parents W.D. (Sam) and Tommie Hamilton. My mother recalls all of the nice folks of Two Egg out on their front porches waving and shouting \"Hi Kenny, Hi Kenny\" as they drove through. The gang stopped to visit with fellow kin Carmalita Brooks. The family went to Lake Talquin for a fishing venture and after a fun time came back and had a fish fry out under the huge pecan tree in Carmalita's front yard. The tree is still there, and I guess you could say it is a family monument. If anyone has any pictures of the old sawmill I would love to get copies. I am also working on the family tree and trying to find out who Levi's parents were. If anybody has any info I would love to hear from you.

And St Petersburg resident Eliza Belle Nichols Conrad wants to set the record straight about which general store.\n\nEarlier this summer, wire service reports told the story of the naming of Two Egg, but Mrs Conrad contents that the store mentioned was the wrong one. Recently a local television station aired a report on Two Egg, a small community in northern Florida, and once again Mrs Conrad said the sources were not completely correct.\n\nShe is the unofficial holder of lore for the Nichols family, which owned the original mercantile store in what was then the town of Allison. Her father, James W Nichols, built and ran the store until 1921. It was in that two-room, wooden structure that the name Two Egg was coined.\n\nAs the St Petersburg Times reported in June, children of an Allison resident brought eggs - usually one or two - to trade for candy, snuff and tobacco. A traveling salesman who often did business with proprietor Nichols noticed this practice and began calling the tiny place Two Egg Town. Mrs Conrad said the \"Town\" was dropped as the name caught on.\n\nAlthough the Nichols family sold the store and moved to St Petersburg in 1922 - \"We bought the population with us\" said Mrs Conrad, one of 11 children (7 boys, 4 girls) - the Nichols's have never forgotten their roots in northern Florida.\n\nMrs Nichols still remembers her father's frequent wagon trips to pick up supplies at Neal's landing on the Chattahoochee River. The first telephone she saw was in the back room of the store where her uncle practiced medicine. It had one of those crank things on it,\" she recalled.\n\nToday the store has a gas pump where the cotton scale used to be, glass windows instead of shutters and an additional room. But those are the only changes said Mrs Conrad. It is the original building built by her father in the early 1900's.\n\n(Bud Nichol's store is not the same as the Lawrence Store where the tee shirts are beling sold. It's across the street.)\n\nEliza Belle Nichols Conrad (died April 19, 1997, age 89), the daughter of James Wylie and Henrietta Green Nichols. The unofficial family historian, had much lore and stories committed to memory.\n\nInformation from: Charles G Mohr of Tallahassee, Florida\n\nStory # 9\n\nFrom: Young, Thomas R.\n\nTwo Egg & Merritt's Ice Plant\n\nBetty,\n\nIf you'd like additional info for the Two Egg & Merritt Ice plant sites, you may wish to contact my father, Roy H. Young, who now resides in Sneads.\n\nHe was employed at the ice plant prior to the \"war\", & was known many years as the \"mayor\" of Two Egg. At one time a chamber of commerce was formed, & my dad mailed license plates (steel ) nationwide for folks that were willing to pay the $.50 plus postage. . I understand he still has a copy of chamber's charter, as well as one of the original license plates. .\n\nStory # 10 (The real thing)\n\nThe CANE GRINDING, In Two Egg\n\nFirst Saturday in December\n\nBetty, I talked to Mrs. Long, the owner of the sugar cane operation. The event has has always been called the CANE GRINDING. I have been there a couple of times myself.\n\nIt is the FIRST SATURDAY OF DECEMBER and is located there at ROBERT LONGS\n\nBREAKFAST starts \"early\" then she said 7 O'Clock Central time\n\n(this breakfast of biscuit, sausage, and syrup is free)\n\nRIBS (by slab and are usually $10)\n\nCANE JUICE IS $2 1/2 GAL and $3 gallon\n\nCANE SYRUP $3.25 quart and they dont usually give discount for buying case lots or more....\n\nI hope you come and enjoy with US The crowd is large all morning, and the breakfast is good !\n\nThe syrup is the best, very mild and does not sour or sugar, so for the syrup soppers it is delicious !\n\nGlen Nobles.....I love syrup !\n\nHi there: Sure appreciate your interest in helping find out about the Bar-B-Q in Two Egg. I called Nell King this AM. Here's the scoop. Robert E. Long, grinds syrup and has sort of an all day affair starting around 06:30am with sausage, biscuits, etc., and progresses into a pork, chicken, etc., event as the morning goes along. Nell suggest you come early. The event is scheduled for December 4th this year. Robert had just been in Nell's store and informed her he was now out of syrup, but is in the process of getting more cane, etc., ready for the 4th. Hope to see you all there. Chuck\n\n# 11\n\nFrom: [email protected] (Don Sellers)\n\nBetty, Et Al;\n\nI have just returned from the metropolis of Two Egg. This journey was a trip back into time. First I stopped at Mr & Mrs Young's house in Sneads and sat on the porch of a 107 year old home and discussed the events for the day. We decided to load up in his van and travel to Two Egg.\n\nAt this point you should understand that Mr. Roy H. Young was born in 1917 and has a long heritage in the Two Egg area. Although there was no school in Two Egg Mr. Young did get a part of his schooling in a one room schoolhouse located in Dellwood, a community just south of Two Egg. After Mr. Young returned from WWII he and several of his friends started a Hill-Billy band. This band played for several years on a program called \"Hill-Billy Jamboree\" broadcast by WTYS out of Marianna, Fl.\n\nDuring the Hill-Billy band period Mr. Young became the Mayor of Two Egg. He served the city from 1945 until 1959. During his mayorship a Junior Chamber Of Commerce was established and numerous local business men became members. A strong contingent of the members either joined in politics, state and county, or became leading business men in Jackson County.\n\nMr. & Mrs. Young, myself and my wife then drove over to Two Egg. On the trip Mr. Young provided continous commentary about people and places. One of the stops we made was at Dr. C.H. Ryals old homesite in Dellwood. From there we proceded to the Robert E. Long cane grinding mill and then on into Two Egg.\n\nIn Two Egg I met the Darrell & Betty Porter who have recently opened up a Flea Market insid the old \"John Henry Pittman\" store. Interestingly there are several artifacts in the store, including an old butcher block made from a section of oak tree with legs nailed on to place it at the proper working height. I also learned, while there, that Mrs. Young's father \"Ashley Daniel Hart\" had constructed a store which is now, sadly, almost falling down due to age.\n\nI'll stop for now since I really need to take all of this and put it into it's proper context. Be advised that I did take photo's of 'everyting' and will make them available to Betty as soon as she let's me know how to get them to her. These are on standard 3.25 disks and all you need is a photo program to make copies.\n\nI should state the Mr. Young stands by the Two Egg name story that relates to two small Black children who came to a store, each with one egg, while a drummer(salesman) was taking an order. The store owner took the two eggs and gave the children candy in exchange for them. At this point the drummer stated that he would call this stop Two Egg. Prior to becoming Two Egg the town was known as Allison.\n\nStory # 12\n\nFaye Dunaway\n\nBorn January 14, 1941 in Bascom, FL\n\nBiography Filmography TV Credits Discography\n\nActor\n\nClaim to Fame:\n\n1967: Played Bonnie Parker in the Bonnie and Clyde\n\nQuote: \"The whole era when I was busy being a big movie star was terribly disconcerting.
