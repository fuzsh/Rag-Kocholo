Yingling, Jr., John Zondlo ANARC Representative: Jim Thomas Back Issues: Dave Nieman Original Cover Design: Harry Hayes FROM THE STHEF: SKIP! Late June and early July saw an increase in E-skip activity almost everywhere on the continent. Tropospheric enhancement was also on the upswing. While no one seems to be calling this ‘one of the best seasons ever’ it certainly showed major improvement after a lackluster beginning. Now, let’s hope for a repeat of that explosive mid-August E-skip episode that we had last year. WEBMASTER: Several members have expressed interest in assuming the position of WIFDA webmaster. There will be an announcement soon. CONVENTION: The timing of our gathering at Rick Shaftan’s a couple of weeks ago didn’t allow for composition of a convention report for the VUD. Next month you can read all about it. If you still have convention fever this year, there are two more major DXer events coming up: NRC: Holiday Inn, Bridgeport WV on Sept 3-6, 1999. Reservations 1-304-842-5411, $70.95 for two double bed room, no limit on how many in a room. Convention registration - $35. Host is William Swiger, One Casey Ln, Bridgeport WV 26330, 304-842-4635. ODXA: “Radio Fest 99”... September 24-26 at the Ramada Inn & Convention Centre, Oakville, Ontario. TV and FM DXers are welcome. Contact the Ramada Inn by telephone (905)849-5950, toll free 1-800-357-0880. Events commence Friday at 7PM. Registration takes place Saturday morning. CHAT: Every Tuesday and Friday at 10PM EDT you’ll find anywhere between 5 and 15 of your counterparts talking DX on IRCnet chat channel #wtfdxa. If you’re on the internet, it’s free. Don’t know much about it? Want information? Need help making it work? E-mail Mike Bugaj <ikon@netcom.com>. It’s a lot of fun and a great way to get to know others in the club. When there’s skip in progress occupants of the channel help identify stations on the spot. REMINDER: WTEDA and VUD are only as good as what’s contributed to them. In the case of your monthly VUD, a lot of man-hours go into the preparation and assembly of the finished product that (we hope) you enjoy. Support the column editors by participating. Submit reports of your loggings to the appropriate FM and TV news editors; give Doug Smith and Greg Coniglio a hand with station news...particularly network or format changes; share your photos with the rest of us via Jeff Kruszka’s “PHOTO NEWS” column. Got a beef about something? A question? A suggestion? “MAILBOX” (Mike Bugaj again) is the place to go. Have any historic stories or graphics? Tom Bryant might use them in “TV TIME TUNNEL”. Yes, we are aware that mentioning these things is repetitious, but if we don’t they seem to be taken for granted. 2 <=, WTFDA MAILBOX a % A i P.O. Box 501 Sy * Somersville, CT 06072 Mike Bugaj Ikon@netcom.com WELL,WELL,WELL Well, what a difference a few days make! Last time we were moaning about the lack of Es and a few days later the whole season tums around. Outside of the Pacific Northwest and the Los Angeles area, I can’t find too many people who are unhappy with the amount of Es they received. I hope everyone got so much Es that it'll take them months to sort our their logs. A couple of longtime Dxers are back in the fold. A big WTFDA welcome to Tim McVey and Danny Buntin. Very glad to have your smiling faces back here! And a great big thanks to all of you for renewing for another year: Edward Ritchie, John Johnson, George Jensen, Frank Aden, Alfred Laun, Charles Bernth, William Eckberg, David Austin, Ron LeBlanc, Mike Lapinski, Jeff Lockwood, Mike Hawk, William McGuire, James Paige, Greg Coniglio, Rod O’Connor, Stan Weisbeck, Robert Ross, Jeff Kruszka, Al Tobia, Jeff Wolf, Neil Kazaross, Roderick Jorgenson and Mark Humenyk.

Ait right, Jim Ayers, make yourself comfortable on the couch and tell Dr. Mike and all the rest of us about it: “I have four digital locals on-air. Have not seen any of them decoded yet, but their signals on an analog set are as distinctive (from analog) as they are devastating to DX. One digital local (ch10) is adjacent to full-power analog 11. 1 sometimes note what I assume is a het on 9 which is a mixture of the two signals on 10 and 11. That is, I see analog 11's signal plus the dark snow from digital 10. Fortunately, this is usually only on bearings toward their (shared) tower. Meanwhile, adjacent channel overload from a local appears to not be as severe, generally, from a digital signal as from an analog local. Those locals relocating from UHF to UHF or from VHF to VHF don’t present an adjacent-channel overload problem yet, anyway, because they are lowering ERP substantionally. Relocating from VHF to UHF, however, is a different issue, since ERPs are higher than stations moving within VHF or UHF. For instance, local channel 2 is also on 39 with 490kw. I sometimes get overload on channel 38 and 40. However, local channel 5 is also on 27 with 846kw and I’m NOT seeing any overload to adjacent channels. The two towers are at 13 and 11 miles, respectively. When it comes to overload, perhaps this is what we Dxers have to fear the most from DTV...NOT just the locals moving from V to U with their higher power than stations moving within V or U, but rather the big slate of UHF locals who can apply to increase their digital power from, say 75kw to 1000kw, as WDSI is doing. What’s to keep every digital on UHF from applying for the maximum 1000kw ? Great for DX, I guess, if you have any channels left on which to DX!” GREETINGS FROM THE PAST. Anemail came in from former WIFDA member John Combs currently living in Florida. John informed me that he has a collection of old VUDs from 1972-1996 (with a few gaps), as well as copies of old AIPA bulletins from the 1950s and early ‘60s, that he plans to put up for bid on eBAY sometime around the middle of August. At the present time John is not interested in selling to any one person (I told him I would take some but he was not interested), but wants to go the auction route. If you are interested in bidding, please check out eBAY as soon as you get this VUD. HTTP:/PAGES. CTHOME.NET/FMDX. This is the address of my very own website! | invite everyone to take a look. In my Mailroom, you will find the most current club stats, email address of all the WTFDA members I know of, articles on E skip, filter modification, my favorite Realaudio, antenna photos in color, super F2 photos and much more. I update regularly, and I plan even more. There’s even a head shot of me for you to throw darts at! So check out Mike’s WIFDA TVFM DX and Computer page! 3 IT’LL MAKE YOU CRY! From Biil Mitchell: “I have a Carver TX-11 FM tuner that had its front end damaged during a thunderstorm, losing about 95% of its sensitivity. I sent it to Carver service, and it was retumed as “repaired”, sadly with only about 20% of its original sensitivity. I do not know how they missed this in checking out the unit (I do -Mike). I tried to return it, but in the meantime Carver and its service folded. Everett Audio in WA picked up repairs, but not tuner repair. So, I am stuck with a TX-11 that works with 33db of system gain ramming a signal through its front end. Is there anybody in the membership that is aware of anyone or a facility that can repair these units? This is such a fine RF performer that it is sad to se it relegated to receiving only locals with all of that antenna gain and preamplification.” Can anyone help Dr. Bill? Email him at eastsyc272@aol.com. LIGHTNING DOES STRIKE TWICE! You might remember an article in the May 1998 VUD oe about a lightning strike at the home of Mike Condon. Well, would you believe it happened again! It happened on the first weekend in May. Here are parts of Mike’s email: “Things could have been much Fa worse, now that I reflect back on it and I’m grateful it happened as @ it did. I lost 4 VCRs, a video switcher and several of those Radio Shack remote switching relays that plug into the wall outlets from surging, and one 14” monitor which works but looses it’s mind when it gets overheated. & The single point ground did it’s job and shunted most of the two i strikes, one at 8pm and the other at midnight, to ground. I did lose the VHF amp up on the tower through rf saturation even though it was not on and disconnected. After investigating fully for days, it turns out that the cable TV company did not ground their system. I blame myself for this because I just neglected to cut their lock and look into their box on the side of the house. When I did so, I became very angry to see that they did not ground, but did pull a small wire in with the coax from the road 200 ft away. Who knows if it even did go to ground out at the road box. I then cut into the system and added my own ground cable and ran it two feet to my system which was right there to catch the house and phone systems. I also grounded it at the panel in the basement where it distributes to the other rooms of the house. I also installed a surge shunt device in the electrical panel with the circuit breakers. | then installed ground fault outlets where any electronic equipment may be connected. In retrospect, the lighting came in on the cable and found it’s way through the VCRs on the shield of the coax to the neutral of the house electrical system back to ground.” Mike estimated the damage from these strikes to be around $2,500. Mike also says “Jim Detrich sent me a story of a fellow who had his house set afire by a strike that hit the house downspout for the gutters, which set off the fire alarm of the neighbor’s house who came and put the fire out. Those folks were lucky. Jim has doubled the prices of the RDX Labs amps, so | installed a Channel Master VHF amp this time. Don’t see much difference in performance.” US TELEVISIONIN EUROPE? \\ received this from a Dxer in Germany in response to a question he posed on the European email list regarding US TV reception in Europe. Have US stations ever made it there by Es? You might find this interesting: “It is possible, but more likely with multi-hop Es than F2. Over the years we’ve had some freaky observations, but no 100% proof of US/Canadian stations. In August 1986, during a strong Icelandic opening, Dxers in Finland noted weak stations (with music only) on frequencies that match with those of St. John Nfld. Also in 1989 (if I remember right), a Norweigian Dxer heard two stations fading with each other on 88.9, both spoke English with an American accent. Hams have also reported (in QST magazine) a Transatlantic opening on FM between Spain and New York area, I guess that was in 1988. The best TV conds ever were in June 1988 when North American stations were widely seen in England on all band I'll channels. The furthest station was from Atlanta, GA on ch A2. There are many Dxers around Finland with the same dream...but to hear NA stations needs good equipment and patience; the signals are often very weak after having travelled so far.” This response came from Jukka Kotovirta in Finland. If you are a East Coast TV Dxer...doesn’t this make you want to swing your antenna eastward and keep it there? LAST, BUT NOT... Thanks everyone for contributing. I have to hold over some items for next issue. The FM Atlas was to go the printer on June 22™. IRC has been loads of fun this summer. If you want to 4 >w how to get on IRC, you'll find out how at my web site. See you next month!

Revolucion PIRATE WATCH: + DENVER, COLORADO. On July 13\", the FCC shut down a station operating in the suburb of Federal Heights, on 89.7. It was running about 30 watts into an omnidirectional gain antenna about 50’ AGL. According to the FCC, it could be received throughout the Denver area. The station, “The Flick”, was automated, and being run out of a pager sales office at W 84\" Ave & Pecos St. According to an employee at the pager business, the station owner claimed that he received a valid license for his station on the internet! (Source: Rick Lewis —- AMFMTVDX list server) * DES MOINES, IOWA. M Street reports that the FCC shut down a pirate in this city operating on 90.5, after a warning to voluntarily shut down. No other information about format or power is available. e Steve Dahl, a Chicago-based radio host (WCKG 105.9) who is syndicated, was not happy with his measly 0.4 share rating on his Detroit affiliate WKRK-FM 97.1. So he pulled 1 ] e the plug on the broadcast to that station, literally! This was all broadcast live over his program. After calling WKRK GM Steve Sinicropi some choice names, he personally when over and pulled the cord out of the patchbay linking Detroit! WKRK was his only affiliate outside Chicago. e The FCC has recently redesigned its web page. This is hoped to clear up some technical issues that have been plaguing the site. Check it out at http://fcc.gov e President Clinton has nominated FCC Commissioner Susan Ness for another five year term. The appointment will still need to be confirmed by the Senate. e Here’s an FCC fine that should help DXers! KXOJ, Inc. (KEMX 94.5 Locust Grove, OK, KEOJ 101.1 Caney, KS, And KXOJ 100.9 Salpulpa) was fined for messing up its fegal ID! The station was inserting “Tulsa” before the correct city of license. The city of license must follow the call. Some information, such as the frequency, the licensee name (i.e. “Chancellor Broadcasting”) may be inserted between the cails and city, but no “impermissible information” such as another city. It was a rough day for KXOJ — they were also fined for not keeping a studio within the station’s primary contours. The station claimed it had to move the studio to Tulsa for economic reasons, but the FCC did not accept that. The station did, however, contest the FCC’s assertion that it did not keep a local or toll-free number so that those within its community could call without a charge. « WTFDA member Peter George (1995 Lake Placid Convention host, and up-coming host as well!) writes to tell us that he is now the chief engineer at WBIM 91.5 Bridgewater, MA (180 watts), and WSHL 91.3 Easton, MA (100 watts). He will gladly QSL if you hear his stations! During the summer months, these two college stations mainly broadcast the “Massachusetts Reading Network\", a radio service for the visually impaired. The network has a legal ID every hour, but WBIM and WSHL insert local Ids every top of the hour (Thanks, Peter, hi! -— grc). The full list of stations on this reading network is: WJUL 91.5 MA Lowell WNMH 91.5 MA Northfield WDJM 91.3 MA Framingham WVBF 1530 MA Middleboro WBIM 91.5 MA Bridgewater WSHL 91.3 MA Easton « Doug Smith recently caught an extensive network ID for the “Christian Radio Network / La 1 Cadena Cristiana” service. This is a Hispanic religious network, mostly located in the Southwest. While the programming is in Spanish, the ID he heard was in Spanish. Here were the stations they mentioned: KMFM 100.7 TX Fremont KPP? 88.5 TX Brownsville (? Doug speculates this is really KOIR Edinburg?) KBRN 1500 TX Boerne KIBL 1490 TX Beeville KDFM 93.1 TX ??

Doug, | see a lot of grants to translate KCZO in M Street, so look for this list to be growing rapidly, like WAFR, KAW, etc. e Chip Kelley notes that KLTY 94.1 Dallas has been sold from Suburst (which paid over $60 only a few months ago) to Hispanic Broadcasting (formerly known as Heftel). The new owners plan to install some form of Spanish language programming on the 94.1 frequency. e KLTY had been one of the most successful contemporary Christian stations in the U.S. The old KLTY format may live on, however, on Suburst’s future move in to the Dallas market: KRJT 100.7. Stay tuned to this column for updates from \"The Big D’. « Thanks to Fernando Garcia for the rare Cuban information. He received that info from Alexeis Marrero, from San Andres, Holguin, Cuba. Fernando also mentions that Radio Taino is a tourism station. It's address is Calle O No. 216, Vedado, P.O. Box 3040, La Habana 3. (Femando also sent the Monterey slogan change!)

CKCO-TV-4 [11] Huntsville, Ontario has been granted permission to stop relaying CKCO-TV-2 Wiarton (which, in turn, is mostly a relay of CKCO-TV [13] Kitchener). It will instead become a relayer of CKNY-TV [10] North Bay, with a small amount of locally-originated programming. One might presume a call change, probably to CKNY-TV-1, will also follow. Forum & Other Stuff Thanks to Dave Zantow, Neil Griffin, Robert Grant, Dennis Smith, Tim Noonan, Fernando Garcia, Keith Knipschild, Tim Caldwell, Bill Dvorak, and Eric Bueneman for information appearing elsewhere in this column. A number of “high channel” translators have applied for renewal this month. They include the Leakey, Texas system of K70FD/K72DN/K74DP and K74BO Santa Rosa, NM. Robert Grant says WDWO-LP [44] has been displaced by WWJ-DT and not yet reappeared on any other channel. It holds a CP for channel 18 though I wonder if that has been bumped by WHTV in Jackson? The WBKP {5] translator in Marquette, MI mentioned in last month’s column is W28BX, according to an email reply from WBKP’s general manager. Neil says the Colquitt, GA and Ottumwa, IA wireless-cable systems are not yet operating. Neither are LPTVs WISBT, W35BN, and W47BZ in Tallahassee; WO2CI and W02CE in Cairo and Camilla, GA; or full-power stations WBIF [51] Marianna, FL or KWKB (20] Iowa City. Danny Oglethorpe has seen KNAZ [2] several times this summer, after their purchase by KPNX [12]. He says channel 2 relays the noon and Spm KPNX news, but the 6 and 10pm newscasts are local to Flagstaff. The quality of the Flagstaff newscasts seems to have improved somewhat as well. Unfortunately Danny has a local on channel 6 so we don’t know how (and if) this change has also affected co-owned KMOH [6] Kingman. Jeff Kadet and Eric Bueneman both report K49FC on the air in St. Louis. This is a 3ABN (religious) affiliate and a LPTV displacement, formerly K48ER. Michael Lazaro reports that the WMHQ [45] switch to WB, reported last month, has not yet happened. Femando Garcia is seeing new K68FU Laredo, Texas. So far, they're only running color bars with 80% of an ID. (It reads “K68F\"!) WAOE [59] Peoria is scheduled to come on the air July 21 with UPN. Jeff also has some offset notes. He relays a report from Frank Merrill that CHAT-TV [6] Medicine Hat, AB is operating on minus offset. According to Industry Canada, they're supposed to be zero offset. (They do have one relay station also on channel 6 at Maple Creek, but it’s supposed to be plus offset - and in any case, is only 10 watts..) K64FO in Fayetteville, Arkansas also seems to be operating on the wrong offset; Jeff finds it between minus and zero, while the FCC thinks it’s plus. He’s also seeing unID color bars towards Huntsville, Alabama on channel 52+. I see nothing likely. (My local W52CT is running color bats, but with an ID - albeit with the wrong calls WS9AW - and they’re supposed to be zero offset though I don’t have equipment to confirm that.) Finally, Jeff has a bit of good news to those with DTV locals. He’s reported several Dxers have succeeded in DXing narrowband FM audio through DTV interference, even when no video is present. Dennis forwarded a wealth of Califomia LPTV information and bandscans - most of which will have to wait for later, when there’s more space. I had to delete most LPTV information this month as it is; there’s just too much DTV activity. With a fair (but late) E-skip season this year, there will be plenty of DX reported this month... 73 Doug 18 Your WTFDA Marketing Board Introduces Now you can be a dxer’s buddy, by sponsoring a TV/FM dxer that lives in a financially disadvantaged part of the world. Some people in second & third world countries that are TRUE dxers, are limited financially. By joining the Dxer's Buddy System, you can give your buddy a one year (or more) membership in the Worldwide TV/FM DX Association. Not only will it increase the joy of that persons interest in dxing, you'll also be spreading the word about TV/FM dxing to the world. And then there's the possibility of being named the Dxer's Buddy of the Year.... Your buddy also receives the VHF-UHF VAFUnIDIGEST. Digest for a full year (or longer), which 7 can really make them feel like they belong to the WTFDA. They get on the road to learning even more about the hobby they love, where they can be in touch with other persons that like the same activity they do. One day, someone might say to you, \"Thanks for being my buddy!!\" WVFMa ms To get an instruction sheet and form for the Dxer's Buddy System, e-mail % marketing team leader fim Thomas at 1) oldwest@oneimage.com, of, mail him 5 at 280 E.

Es continued on TV until at least 2102. My car battery died at 1145 (that's what Es will do to your brain). By the time AAA jumped me, | was no longer noting Es on FM. Thanks to several DXers who offered !Ds from my initial posting, and to any who can help with the UNIDs above.. Can anyone clarify what | was hearing as \"WKNM\"? Thanks! Still reviewing my tapes for more hidden clues. Locking forward to the new FMA! My wrist hurt after 3 hours of this.
