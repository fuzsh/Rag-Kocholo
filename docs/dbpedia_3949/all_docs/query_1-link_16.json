Buxton ^IFmiPisiiiisx IL^Siff 0 ONE OF THE MOST attractive facets of life is that we can start anew. If things have not gone as we had planned, we can start over. Perhaps it will not be as easy as it is for a boy to erase a blackboard after making a mistake in an arithmetic problem, yet we can begin again. God gives man an innate desire to mend his ways, to improve, to move toward perfection. At the be- ginning of a new year, the drinker may resolve to quit drinking, the smoker may resolve to quit smoking, and the fat man may resolve to quit overeating. Desiring to improve and refine himself, man may go to great ends to change. Some persons do quit bad habits by their own willpower. However, such self- discipline is hard to come by without the sustaining influence of God's help. A preacher was heard to say that he found it impossible to lose weight until he made his desire to do so a matter of earnest prayer. Too often man fails to seek for help when he de- cides to improve himself, or as we sometimes say, when he turns over a new leaf. Hence the wind of temptation soon blows the leaf backward to its old position, resulting in frustration to the individual. There is . something good and pure about a per- son wanting to become a better individual; nonethe- less, he errs greatly when he tries to do this within himself, not seeking God's help. The Bible comes right to the point on this subject, for it states: \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accus- tomed to do evil\" (Jeremiah 13:23). Of course, the unconverted man who would make godly resolutions must first repent of his sins and ask God to save him. The Lord is willing and waiting to forgive and to convert. This sort of leaf turning we call the new birth, and it is nothing short of miraculous. God can turn more leaves in a man's £9° wM heart within a few minutes than the man can bring about by himself in a lifetime. When the Lord Jesus turns leaves for us, they stay turned, unless we flagrantly turn them back. Speaking of a person whom Christ has changed, Paul the apostle said, \"He is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new\" (2 Corinthians 5:17). The Christian should resolve to redouble his efforts to be godly and guard closely his thoughts, his con- versation, and his actions. While making his list of seventy resolutions to live by, the great preacher Jonathan Edwards wrote: \"Resolved, never to do any- thing which I should be afraid to do if it were the last hour of my life.\" What a sobering thought! Roscoe Conkling once said, we should \"hew to the line, and let the chips fall where they may.\" Further, we should strengthen our devotion to Christ through more Bible study and prayer. Prayer- lessness is a plague among Christians today. Being busy with things, even church duties, is no excuse for bypassing the prayer closet. May we resolve to have set times for seeking the Father in secret. The way to spiritual strength is through prayer and Bible study; hence let us resolve to read the Book, thereby letting God speak to our hearts daily. The Lord has very important truths to impart to us through His Word; so if we do not read the Bible, we will miss important communications from Him. Jesus said, \"Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures\" (Matthew 22:29). When we have sought the Lord in Bible study and prayer, we are ready to face life. We can then re- solve with Longfellow: Let us then be up and domg With a heart for any fate; Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labor and to wait. • WINDS WHEN WINTER COMES,\" reads an advertise- ment of a certain heating plan, \"you can't put the leaves back on the trees, but — \" It then goes on to describe their particular method of neating. Reading it, I thought, \"How true. We can't put the leaves back on the trees; we can't- 'turn the calendar back a couple of months. When winter arrives, it ar- rives on schedule — whether we like it or not! And it stays around for quite a spell.\" If you are from a winter-gripped, snow-drifted state (as I am) and you like the outdoors, there are many things to do: skiing, sledding, skating and hunting. But what can one do on blizzardy days, or on long, bone-chilling nights? For one thing you will have more time for reading— ri'f-you are a reader. (If you aren't, you should be!) The old, old Book with its up-to-date message should be first on your list. l \\- .^'- There are many good boo^ of Christian fiction available (if you like fjctltfn\"), inspiring biographies, helpful devotional books, books of poetry, and many others. If you have not found\" the joy of reading good books, you reallyjajfte missed a lot! To make reading especially. enjoyable, have a big bowl of pop- corn, buttered, and seasoned just right^Or a crisp, red apple around to munch on while you read! Another thing, you will have more time for your private prayer life: to tell the Lord all about your needs, your desires, and plans. He wants to share them with you. He may see fit to change some of your plans, but His plans will be far better for you — as someday you will see. Pray for your loved ones, your friends, your neighbors, your world' leaders and your spiritual leaders. You will never run out of peo- ple to pray for— for who is it that does not need prayer? Do not confine all of your prayer time to asking; spend much of it in praising God for His goodness to you. Be thankful that you believe in prayer; many do not. Be thankful that you know how to pray in ' childlike simplicity; many do not. The only prayers they know are flowery words they read from a book. Be thankful that you are \"on praying ground\"; many are not. You have much to praise God for; we all do. You will also have more time to relax with some entertaining, as well as instructive, games and amuse- ments in which all members of your family can par- ticipate. There are many good games available and ! surely some will appeal to you. Other than reading, as has been mentioned al- ready, you will find more time to devote to your hobbies — whatever they may be. Some folks go \"for photography, some for music, 'Others -foL-painting or drawing, writing letters, trying their\"*hand at put-.- ting words together in poetic form, or whaJjiSave ' you. Surely, if you try hard enough, you- will find something to do on a long\" winter's evening besides sitting spellbound before a TV screen or leafing through a comic book! Find some worthwhile thing to do when the wild winds of winter start blowing! • i = mm A mmm By GRACE V. SCHILLINGER :-,j AT THREE ON that dreary January day, the fog hid the willows near the Rock River. Our motorboats, winter-moored, were lost in the grayness. The sky dripped. I was tired of the radio and television and knew I would feel better if I took a walk. The warm clothes I pulled on would have been suit- able for visiting the rain forest in the Northwest. When I stepped outside the lonely smell of winter fog surrounded me. A thin glaze of ice slicked the cement stoop. My cleated boots held me safely on the sidewalk and I headed west; the neighboring houses disappeared into the fog shroud seconds after I had passed. Old Baldy was the hill I was headed for, the highest hill around here. I sensed where it was, but could not see it. I walked slowly and came to the row of nine mailboxes at the crossroads. As usual, newspapers and torn envelopes lay strewn beneath them. Disgust made me burn! Why do folks not carry their mail home? I slid along the bank, gathered up the boxholders and sales sheets, and piled them in a soppy stack. I kicked a rock loose to anchor the pile; I would take it home to burn when I drove by with the car. After my litter-picking, I walked west, down the road toward the break in the barbed wire fence. Where I crossed through, moss, thick and green, clung to the washed-out hollows of the road bank. I tried to scrape off a gob of the bright moss to take home, but it was frozen tightly to the earth. I began climbing. Frost covered the dead poplar and oak leaves. Now and then a wind gust loosened slivers of ice from the brush, sounding like Christmas tree ornaments breaking. Wild crabapple trees and old gray stumps offered their help as I pulled myself past them. The top of the conical hill was in sight now. From time to time the fog blew away and I saw the tall pinkish grass on Old Baldy's sandy knob. A few more struggling feet and I reached my look- out. It was a different world, unearthly. The wind- ing road was gone; I could not see the river. No one saw me. Sensible folks were indoors, cozy, not wan- dering about on eerie Old Baldy. But the sensible ones missed my exhilaration, my contact with nature, my release from tenseness that rewarded me up there. Heavenly Father, I prayed silently, lift the fog of prejudice and hate and mis- understanding from men's hearts. Let them feel the healing warmth of brotherly love. Amen. Coming down, I caught onto brush to keep from rolling. Once when I clutched at a stump, a wild rabbit dashed out, jumped on down the hill and out of sight. I put my hand in and felt his bed. It was dry and warm, rounded out to fit his furry body. A little later I reached the road and the mailboxes. I even smiled at the rubbish with the gray stone on top. + The lleverend ). E. DcVore is id' overseer of the Church of God in Wisconsin. He is an excellent speaker and appears on programs of both state and area conventions. PETER'S HEALING SHADOW By J. E. DeVORE THE BIG fisherman, impul- sive, impetuous, hotheaded, described as one who was always \"speaking before he thought and leaping before he looked,\" was General Booth's hero. When his son, Bramwell, was a little boy, he once said, \"I don't think much of Peter, for in that story when he tried to walk on the sea, even though Christ was there, he had so little faith that he began to sink.\" \"Bramwell,\" replied the General, \"you would never have gotten out of the boat at all.\" Heaven is not reached at a single bound. Reaching our goal in glory is not the work of one passing day. It is the occupation of a lifetime. This was true for Simon Peter. It is true for most of us. We are not born spiritual giants. We must be born again. Then, we must grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ (2 Peter 3:18). When Christ called Cephas (John 1:42), he was no more than a pebble on the beach, but the Son of God promised, \"Thou shalt be.\" This unstable one, so entirely hu- man and encouragingly faulty, for- ever attempting impossible feats, storming inaccessible heights and falling into all but hopeless depths, by the grace of God came at last to higher ground. He was no longer a babe in the Lord when people placed their languishing loved ones along the streets so that his shadow might fall on them. He had reached a Pentecostal level. He had received Holy Ghost power. And now, his very shadow fright- ens disease away, for \"they were healed every one\" (Acts 5:16). He is a long, long way from those dull days when all the strength he seemed to need was muscle enough to pull the oars or drag in the nets. He is a flaming fagot, a torch of truth, with a message that burns with eternal fire until it wakes the city! This man lived to become a world-shaking, age-making apostle. His Lord had promised, \"I will solidify your character; I will call you Cephas or Peter, which means 'a rock.' \" Oh, that the dynamic power of the Holy Spirit might be coupled to each vacillating Simon until a solidified godliness of soul charges him with true Christian character as solid as the granite mountains for God! Simon said, \"I will never forsake you,\" but he did (Mark 14:31, 50). Spirit-filled, flint-faced Cephas said: \"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard\" (Acts 4:19, 20). Simon spoke the more vehement- ly, \"Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee\" (Matthew 26:35). But he did! Filled with holy boldness, intrepid Peter fearlessly said to the authorities, according to tradition, \"I am not worthy to be crucified as was my Lord. Cru- cify me with my head down.\" It was not hero worship which inspired the people to bring their sick ones on beds and pallets into the streets. It was a testimony of confidence in a man who was transformed by the Spirit of Christ. Yonder comes a father carrying an invalid boy. Here comes a moth- er up the street with her sick baby. Yonder comes a husband by the side of his ailing wife, who is being carried by friends. \"What meaneth this eager, anx- ious throng?\" \"Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.\" But He comes in the person of Cephas, the mighty minister of holiness and healing. Someone says. \"I hope the shadow of Peter pass- ing by shall fall upon my dear one.\" Oh. this man left his mark on the people of his generation. His shadow (influence) was not ephemeral in character. He is say- ing to us today: \"Do not fall from your own steadfastness. Do not be led away with the error of the wicked. But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.\" If we are growing in grace, we will be a blessing to others. They may even watch for us to walk down the street so that our shadow falling on them should bless them. The brokenhearted may forget to sob when they stand in our pres- ence, if we are \"full of grace\" (John 1:16). In the book. The Glossolalia Phenomenon, Dr. Ray H. Hughes has written. \"In the shadow of the return of Christ, be- lievers throughout all Christendom should arise and appropriate the power which is provided through the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.\" Peter's healing shadow was a re- sult of this Pentecostal Baptism. • Civic Auditorium, Glendale, California Memorial Auditorium, Greenville, South Carolina I By HOLLIS L. GREEN TWIN NATIONAL Sunday School Conventions in the spring of 1967 have been announced by Donald S. Aultman, national Sunday school and youth director. Moving from a centralized con- vention program in the 1965 con- vention in Cincinnati, a dual pro- gram is being planned for 1967. The Civic Auditorium, Glendale, California, will be the site for a West Coast convention, March 21- 23. The Reverend Floyd McClung is to serve as general chairman of the West Coast Steering Committee. An East Coast convention will be held in Greenville, South Carolina's Memorial Auditorium, April 25-27. General chairman of the Greenville Steering Committee is the Reverend John Lemons. Conventions have been the work- ing core of the Sunday school movement since it began, and they have made significant contribu- tions to the advancement of Chris- tian education in the Church of God. The convention program has become a practical and functional force in leadership training and worker development, primarily be- cause a Sunday school convention communicates an atmosphere of involvement. \"Together We Build\" will be the theme that unites the two conven- tion programs. Both three-day con- ventions will feature nearly two hundred Christian education work- shops and seventy-five exhibit booths of Christian education ma- terials and equipment. The warm and inspirational cli- mate of a Sunday school conven- tion allows for variety in program- ing. In addition to participation in the workshop process, delegates will be inspired and challenged by congregational worship and dynam- ic preaching. Public worship-ser- vice speakers will include Dr. Charles W. Conn, general overseer; C. Raymond Spain, assistant gen- eral overseer; James A. Cross, president of Lee College; Lewis J. Willis, editor in chief; Paul L. Walker, pastor from Atlanta. Georgia; O. W. Polen, pastor at West Flint, Michigan; and Haskel Jenkins, pastor at Middletown, Ohio. A special guest speaker will be J. Floyd Williams, director and executive secretary of the Pente- costal Holiness Church. The Reverend C. Raymond Spain, executive representative for the Sunday school and youth depart- ment, has said that the twin con- vention programs will strengthen the creative leadership of the church and will better prepare Christian education workers to plan and administer meaningful programs and activities, e Mil By WILLIAM E. WINTERS \"Money answer eth all things\" (Ecclesiastes 10: 19 1 The Reverend William E. Winters is a regular contributor to the LIGHTED PATHWAY. He pastors in Dayton, Ohio. IN THE BIBLE we read about a \"talking mule.\" Just the other day a little girl told me she had received a \"talking parakeet\" for her birthday. A young man who could neither read nor write was thrilled when he purchased a \"talking Bible.\" I would like to tell you about another very important talker: \"talking money.\" Someone may ask, Can money talk? It surely can. The text says it can answer all things. It is said that the word hallelujah is the same in every language. Money, too, has a universal language. Get off a boat or an airplane in Honolulu or Hong Kong with money and see that it does not need an interpreter. Money says a lot. It can talk men and women into social clubs and exclusive societies. Money talks behind your back and like your chil- dren you are responsible for what both say. Money talks about its owner. It calls him a spend- thrift, a tightwad, or a skinflint. It may even tell him good-bye. Money may talk complimentary and tell that its owner is thrifty, a good manager, generous, and God- honoring. It should always tell him, \"In God We Trust.\" The rich man in the Word of God let his money make him a fool. His money talked loud. It talked of land, of full barns, and then bigger ones. God tried to talk to him, but his money made too much noise. Finally, God spoke louder and when he heard God's voice, it was saying, \"Thou fool, this night thy soul is required of thee.\" John Wesley's philosophy of money was: Earn all you can; save all you can; and give all you can. Sometimes \"talking money\" loses its voice, stands dumb, and has laryngitis. Before sorrow money can- not say a word; at the grave money is speechless. In the midst of heartache and heartbreak money is dumb. Money should glorify God by being used for the right purposes. Not only does it feed and clothe, but money can send the gospel to the unconverted. The preacher or missionary cannot go without funds. It is a proven fact that money properly used can bring about salvation to the lost. \"Money answereth all things,\" the Bible says. Is your money answering the right kind of questions? # 8 THE BEGINNING OF the New Year is a time of reflection as well as a time of prospect. During the past seventy years (the promised life-span of man) the world has undergone rapid chang- es. We have come from the gay nineties to the turn of the century, through the war-torn teens, the roaring twenties, the depressing thirties, the fighting forties, and the post-war revolutionary fifties. And now we have passed the mid- way mark of a decade of destiny — the unpredictable sixties. In the future, the accelerating rate of change will be the domi- nant feature of our existence. Un- like most of our forebears, we will never have the opportunity to be- come fullv adjusted to the world, as we know it, before we have thrust upon us new ideas, new con- cepts, and new products which will change the way we live. The days just ahead are full of challenge, decision, and sobering import. This decade is called by some \"the decade of decision.\" No doubt, the decisions of 1967, if Jesus tarries, will determine whether we move ahead in freedom, or in locked-step with Communism. The decisions of this year could mean the difference between freedom and a garrisoned state. Prognosti- cators and would-be prophets are peering into the future, making their predictions and publishing their guesses. But the only authori- tative picture of tomorrow is found in the prophecies and predictions of God's Word. A KNOWLEDGE EXPLOSION This day was predicted by Daniel, the prophet, many hundreds of years ago. The Bible states in Daniel 12:4 \". . . many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in- creased.\" Daniel was definitely speaking of our day. This rapid in- crease in travel and knowledge cov- ers a relatively short period of time. Just over a half century ago, the Wright brothers flew their first plane. Today, supersonic jets are common, and man has made orbital flights around the earth. It is pre- dicted that in the next few years satellite traffic relatively close to the earth will grow increasingly congested. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an- nounced that in the period during the sixties, there will be unmanned reconnaissance of Venus and Mars, and a man is expected to be landed on the moon. Knowledge has in- creased so rapidly, until master- minds are making one major in- vention every twenty-four hours. Just a century ago there was only one major invention every twenty- five years. Time is fast running out, and the earth is speeding toward the closing scene of the drama of time. We are fast approaching the end! The Word of God informs us that we will be able to see the day approaching (Hebrews 10:25). WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS This year will bring wars and rumors of wars on an increased scale. Even as our Lord Jesus Christ has said, \"And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars . . .\" (Matthew 24:6). Almost two thousand years have now passed since the Prophet of Galilee stood on the Mount of Olives and pre- dicted this day of bloodshed and war. Our newspapers are so filled with accounts of war until we are no longer sensitive to the threats, Please turn to page 21 A FORECAST OF THE FUTURE Dr. Ray H. Hughes Dr. Hay H. Hughes, assistant general over- seer of the Church of God, was president of Lee College for six years. He has been pre- vailed upon by the editor to submit to the LIGHTED PATHWAY updated manuscripts of chapel addresses given to Lee students dar- ing his presidency. It is with a great deal of pleasure that we begin this regular feature in the LIGHTED PATHWAY. Dr. Hughes is widely known for his unusual speaking ability and for his scholarly mind in things both secular and spiritual.— Editor 010 DRESS By IRMA HEGEL □ D □ D □ D D □ □ □ □ D □ D □ D D □ D D D D □ D D □ □ □ D D D D D D D D □ □ D □ D □ D □ □ D D D a d ■ a □ d a □ □ d □ d a □ a D D D a D D a D D D a □ a a a d a a a d d a □ a D a d □ □ a d a d a d □ ri HE SALESGIRL pushed the curtains of the dressing room aside. For a moment she stood quite still in admira- tion, her hands clasped together, an ecstatic expression on her freckled face. \"Oh, Mrs. Harvey, that dress was made for you.\" Jean glanced again at her reflec- tion in the long mirror. The blue formal did match the deep blue of her eyes. The tiny waist fitted to perfection. The skirt fell in bouf- fant froth about her slender legs. Why not buy it? She had not bought a formal since she had married Glenn. Interstate Insur- ance Company was holding its New Year's Eve party this Saturday night. Why not, for once, act as if she were dressed like a future dis- trict manager's wife. \"Charge or cash?\" the salesgirl had drawn out her book, her pencil poised above the slips. Jean unzipped the dress and shook her taffy-colored head. \"I can't. The Christmas bills will be arriving the fifth of January. They're all the budget can take.\" The salesgirl laughed. \"Every- one's in debt, including the Gov- ernment, Mrs. Harvey. Better join the rest of us debtors.\" Jean stepped from the formal and hastily pulled on her green knit. It had a patch beneath the right armpit and a snag carefully mended. \"I had better leave before I change my mind. Thanks so very much for your help.\" Outside, in the brisk December morning, her eyes brimmed. I should have bought the dress, she told herself. I will attend that party in the same white formal they have seen me wear for two years. The crowd already thinks we are queer for not joining them in drinking and smoking. For all I know, my prudish rules might be the very thing holding Glenn from that district managership which he wants so badly. She bought canned fruit on sale in the grocery department — always a brown bag of foodstuff instead of a box with something for herself. Her bitterness in- creased. Even the noonday lun- cheon with the mission group from church did not dispel her gloom. She and Glenn had pledged one hundred dollars for the African mission, yet she could not afford one dress. 10 DDDDD DDDOD DDDDD DDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD DDDDDDDDDDDDDD a a. a a a d a a a a a a d a a a d a a a d d a a DDDD a a d a DDDD a a a d a a a a d ana a d a d a a d a d a a a d a a DDDD DDDD D D a D DDDD a a d a DDDD DDDD a a a a DDDD It was three o'clock before Jean returned home where Grandma Harvey was baby-sitting with one- year-old Iona. \"Baby's still napping,\" Grandma informed her, smiling. She was a plump wholesome woman who hardly looked her forty-five years. \"Suppose I stay over tonight and let you and Glenn attend your New Year's party at Interstate?\" \"That's sweet of you, Mom. Are you sure Gramps won't mind?\" \"Certainly not. You did buy a new dress, didn't you, Jean?\" \"I couldn't.\" \"Why not? Finefrocks had a sale on formals today. Oh, that reminds me. Finefrocks had a fire in the office right around noon. The news came over the radio. The manager made the announcement that all purchase records for the morning were destroyed. Those who made purchases today are to send in an account of the merchandise charged.\" Grandma shook her head. \"I doubt if many will. Honesty is a lost virtue these days.\" Jean was thoughtful for a mo- ment, \"Why didn't I buy and charge that dress? I could have had it free. No record of a charge. No bill would have ever arrived. I would have looked beautiful to- night. I would have made Glenn proud of me.\" As quickly came the stinging rebuke from her well- trained conscience. What on earth am I thmking? I'm the wife who sits beside her husband in church every Sunday. I teach a Sunday school class. Glenn and I pray be- fore every meal. We read our Bible. Puzzled at her silence, Grandma asked, \"Is anything wrong?\" Jean aroused herself to the world of reality about her. \"Everything's right,\" she answered quickly. \"I'll make us some coffee. Glenn won't be home for dinner till six.\" Grandma followed her into the kitchen. \"You and Glenn don't like these company New Year's Eve par- ties, do you, Dear? You're like Gramps and myself. Liquor, ques- tionable jokes, smoking — that isn't the way we want to celebrate our New Year's Eve. If I were home, Gramps and I would be attending the Watch Night services at our church. I dare say your mother and father on their farm are doing that selfsame thing.\" Jean nodded and her small face was wistful. \"Sometimes I get just plain homesick for Sawyerwood, Mom. I guess once a country gal, always a country gal.\" She mea- sured the coffee into the percola- tor. \"Stay that way,\" said Grandma. \"Know who you are, why you're here and where you're going.\" Glenn arrived home promptly at six. He barged into the kitchen door, the storm door slamming be- hind him. His dark eyes were shm- ing in his wide young face. He seized Jean about the waist and spun her round and round the shiny tiled floor. They halted and she laughed, pushing a strand of hair from her eyes and glancing breathlessly up at her husband. \"What's all this for?\" \"We're not going to that boring company party tonight, Jean. Glad?\" \"Um-hum.\" She frowned. \"Why not?\" \"You know how we both wanted to hear Pastor Ryder's son preach tonight? Just once I had the cour- age to speak my piece to the boss. 'Mr. Powell,' I said, 'Jean and I don't smoke or drink or dance. We're rather lost at these company parties. We happen to be church members and we like to attend our Watch Night services on New Year's Eve. We feel that we need prayer and worship more than noisemak- ers and liquor for 1967. So would it be all right with you if we passed up the party completely?' \" \"And?\" Jean urged. \"This is the wonderful part of my whole story. Mr. Powell grinned and said, 'You've never quite ad- justed to our young moderns, have you Glenn? I've been saying to myself all along that you're exactly the manager I want for our Sawyerwood area. They are honest, God-fearing, church-going folk in that territory. They would like you. I think you'll like them. How long would it take to sell that house of yours and move to Sawyerwood?' \" Jean covered her face with her hands and sobbed. She must have cried much too noisily because Grandma Harvey marched into the kitchen. \"Glenn Harvey,\" she stormed at her son, \"what have you been saying to Jean? What have you done?\" \"Mom — \" Glenn spread his hands out helplessly. \"I don't know. I only told Jean the news she's been pray- ing for, hoping for, living for. Look at her — she's crying.\" Jean rushed to her tall husband and flung her arms tightly about his neck. \"Darling, darling, don't you know that a girl cries when she's deliriously happy and enor- mously grateful? Have you ever passed up a big temptation and been just plain glad that you did? Before I start putting dinner on the table, I want to tell you both the story of a dress that would have looked so-o out of place at a Watch Night service and on a dis- trict manager's wife.\" \"Do you suppose Jean's feeling all right?\" Glenn asked his mother. Grandma smiled. \"She's never looked better to me. Go on, Jean — tell us your story now.\" % 11 II II the BACKBENCH iy EVELYN P. JOHNSON E OFTEN HEAR the term \"back-seat sitters,\" used half-humorously and half-derisively in speaking of adults who sit near the back of the church. I am one of those persons who takes a backseat, merely be- cause I feel more comfortable and am able to view the pulpit and choir loft better when I do not sit too near the front of the sanc- tuary. And after several experienc- es of arriving right at the begin- ning-time and having to sit on the back — or second to the back — bench, I have come to the con- clusion we need more adults on those seats. Why? Because the temptations on those back benches are too great for the teen-agers and pre-teens in the congregation. Last Sunday I was surrounded. Two girls, approximately eleven and thirteen years old, sat on one side of me. Two boys of the same age group sat on the other side. Another woman sat at the end of the bench, but she and I could just as well have been fixtures of the building. Since neither of us was a parent of any of the young- sters, our disapproving glances had absolutely no effect. Before we opened our hymnals, one of the girls kept patting the bench beside her and, in a stage whisper, urging the younger boy to sit there. As we stood for the offertory prayer, she reached be- hind me to hand a note to him. During the entire sermon she read letters the other girl handed to her — letters from a boy, judging by the rapturous sighs and not-too- muffled giggles which accompa- nied the reading. The boy leaned forward in his seat during the services — the bet- ter to ogle his girl friend. The older boy spent his time in nudg- ing his companion and peeking across me, trying to read the letters and notes. I was so disgusted I could not enjoy the sermon. But I was also deeply concerned, because I have heard similar giggles and whispers Sunday after Sunday, as I sit some- where near the back benches which often are filled only with young people. Is it right for us, as adults, to leave this part of the church to be- come a source of temptation to the young? \"If they're taught right at home . . .\" we say. But do we know our own children are above yielding to the temptation to whisper? to pass notes? Especially when they see their friends doing so. Many adults continue to whisper and \"visit\" long after the opening bar of music has sounded. If we, who are sup- posed to be \"seasoned Christians,\" find it difficult to still our tongues and center our thoughts on wor- ship, how do we expect a half dozen youngsters with a whole pew to themselves to be duly attentive? We must teach, yes; but removal of the temptation would help. This can be done if a heavier sprinkling of adults will sit on the back bench- es with the youngsters — with their youngsters. A few parents of some of the group a bench or two away would serve as a silencer on the whole group. These small flurries of activity here and there in the back rows must be distracting to the preach- er. But if he should mention it from the pulpit, some of his flock might say he \"has stopped preach- ing and gone to meddling,\" be- cause, being human, we dislike hav- ing our offspring criticized. Late-arriving visitors get a poor impression of a church when they cannot hear the preaching for the prattle of boys and girls on the back benches. Perhaps we should speak more seriously of the \"back-seat sitters,\" and, instead of urging them up front, request that they continue to sit among the young people for the benefit of the church as a whole. • 12 By PAUL CONN Dr. Delton L. Alford, Director THEY HAD BEEN good robes, but enough was enough. The Lee Singers had been wearing them, after all, for over ten years. And ten years with the Lee Singers is a lot of miles. It in- cludes hundreds of performances from Pittsburgh to Nassau to Dal- las to New York, performances in churches and high schools, in col- leges and civic auditoriums. The Lee Singers had been wear- ing them for ten years — putting them on and taking them off for ten years, zipping and unzipping a million times. By spring of '66 the robes were frayed and worn and patched and about all that held them together was a little bare thread and a lot of tradition. And that is where this story be- gins. The Singers swept through Ohio on a tour last year and stood in those worn robes and sang their hearts out. Every- one was blessed and thrilled and went home talking about how good the music was. But Mrs. June Allen of Dayton, Ohio, noticed the robes. And she went to work. With help from friends, ministers, and church members, Mrs. Allen initiated a drive to buy new robes for the Lee Singers. It was not easy. Almost a thou- sand dollars had to be raised in contributions from individuals and local businesses and industries. Let- ters were written. People were visit- ed. Contacts were made. And grad- ually the prayers that went up changed from supplication to thanksgiving. A brisk little man from a cus- tom robe manufacturer came to Lee and measured fifty times. Shortly afterward there came to Dr. Alford's door fifty long, flat boxes. And then it was one of those times when it is hard to know just how to say Thank-you, because you mean it so much. When you hear the Lee Singers again, there will be forty college kids on the risers. Each one of them will be wearing a new robe, deep maroon, the best that money can buy. Many people helped to pay for these robes, but someone had to care enough to start the ball rolling. Look around. There is plenty to do. And God still does it through people. • *0m I he Reverend Paul Conn. writer of this article, has been with the tec Sing- ers far more than three years, and is a very valued member of the ^roup.

Moye, Director Pioneers for Christ International By CLIFFORD MULLINS BPmnm BEMiFSis §f PHI HI: I: IIS FOR CUIUS! 1USED TO HATE to go to church, now I can hardly wait.\" This statement was made by a sixteen-year-old girl who had become active in a Pi- oneers for Christ group. Her whole concept of religious worship, Chris- tian service, and the work of God had changed. Her experience in Christ had become vital and alive, because she had developed a pur- pose for its existence. This same story and similar statements can be repeated many times, because being an active Pioneer for Christ is the most en- lightening and spiritually invigora- ting experience a born-again Chris- tian can go through. The personal spiritual benefits derived from being an active Pi- oneer for Christ are varied and many. It certainly increases one's vision and burden for lost souls. On an invasion by the Ashland district corps of Pioneers for Christ in Norwalk, Ohio, one lady, after having covered her designated area of visitation, was so deeply stirred that she stood on the street corner and wept over the lost con- dition of men and women. When I picked her up, she said, \"I did not realize the desperate need of souls and the awful darkness of sin that prevails in the lives of people. It just breaks my heart.\" This is the kind of experience that changes one's life. This woman be- came a devoted Pioneer for Christ and is active in the club today. Pioneers for Christ have a built- in incentive for Bible study: the \"must\" of having the right an- swer. In another invasion on this same district in a different town, a Sunday school teacher, who was a good teacher and well qualified by our standards, said — after hav- ing faced the need of a lost soul who inquired of him how to be saved from the power of sin — \"I realize how little I know. I am go- ing to have to study the Bible more.\" He realized that a general knowledge of the Bible was not enough; he must know the specific way of life as taught in God's Word. This man went on to become the district director of that corps of the Pioneers for Christ. Then there was the woman who, after having been on an invasion and seeing the need of the lost, recognized her personal need of a greater knowledge of the Bible and said, \"I am going to really study and be prepared for the next in- vasion.\" This lady has since grown very strong in God and is a wit- ness wherever she goes. Shyness or fear is a problem to practically every person who gives his heart to God. In most churches this is the reason for a sad lack of personal soulwinning. People are just plain afraid! The influence of Pioneers for Christ will break this down to a great degree. People like to feel they are not alone in a project and teaming them with someone for a common goal really does the job. In a jail service our church was conducting, a man was with us who had been won to God and the church. Previously, he had been in this same jail for drunk- enness. This was his first opportu- nity to work for God. While sing- ing with the group, his heart had been gripped by a spirit of com- passion for the men; when the op- portunity was given for the group to testify, he stepped forth with tears flowing down his face and told the prisoners how he had spent 16 days in that same cell and how God had saved him and his family. This was the most powerful in- fluence of God that the prisoners could have felt. They all were aware of God's presence and of Jesus' power to save from sin. It is difficult to remain quiet about what God has done for you when someone else has the same needs you had prior to your con- version. One fellow who had never testified in church, was prevailed upon to go as a silent partner with a Pioneers for Christ member. While doing house-to-house visita- tion, they found a man who was lost and wanted to be saved, but he could not seem to understand the way of salvation. Our silent partner, who was too shy to testify in church, stood praying and shifting from one foot to the other with a growing agita- tion of impatience at the man's in- ability to understand. Finally, he could stand it no longer and blurted out, \"Look! It's like this!\" and he found himself trying to win a soul to Christ. This is the way soulwinners are born. It burns inside every man and woman who knows Jesus Christ as his personal Saviour. Fear and ig- norance lock the lips of many Christians, but Pioneers for Christ will help unseal lips and give vent to all the pent up desires of a man or woman to witness and win. There is a revival of personal soulwinning in the land. The Church of God is blessed with the greatest instrument for soulw'n- ning and spiritual growth it has ever known — the Pioneers for Christ. This brings the challenge to everyone, gives purpose to our knowledge of the power of the Spir- it, and makes each member know that his labor in the Lord is not in vain. If each district of our great church would organize and pro- mote an active group of Pioneers for Christ, the Church of God could have not just a few special- ists in soulwinning, but a mighty army of soulwinners that could storm the strongholds of hell and deliver the souls of men who have become captives of Satan. * COMING UP ZESTIER THAN EVER!

Several of this group car- ried bulky bundles, and appeared to be workmen of some sort. When they reached the terrace which served as our front yard they moved immediately to a large win- dow and began their work. I had been completely oblivious By DENZELL TEAGUE to the actions of these strange workmen, but suddenly I was awak- ened as they began their task. What was happening? Were these burg- lars intent upon breaking and en- tering our home? Did they intend to do violence to me and my fami- ly? Actually, none of these thoughts passed through my mind because the sound that awakened me was a sweet sound. It was the sound of music, sweet and harmonious. This was my introduction to the Guatemalan custom of the birthday serenade. I jumped out of bed and looked out the window. There they stood on the terrace — a local pastor with his church orchestra. Three guitars, a bass viol, and an accor- dion served as accompaniment to twelve clear voices. In the glow of the streetlight I could see their faces, mirroring the affection of their hearts. It was my birthday, and they had come with this token of their love. It was true that the night was disturbed. Its silence had been shattered. The status quo had been upset. But I was neither angered nor annoyed. I was delighted. Dashing to the door I threw it open and invited them in, and then rushed to put on the coffeepot and bring out the sweets. As I listened to them sing several more songs, my eyes welled up with tears — tears of love and gratitude because these strange people, whom six weeks before I had not even known, had sacrificed their own personal rest and comfort to bring this bit of joy to me. Two young mothers in the group had come with their large babies strapped to their backs. The other men and women also had walked some distance in the darkness to our house — all for the purpose of bringing to us this serenade in the night. When the last cup of coffee and piece of cake had disappeared and the last Feliz Cumpleanos (Happy Birthday) had been said, and the last visitor had gone, I reflected upon the situation. This little epi- sode had been a parable of the work of the missionary in particu- lar and the Christian witness in general. Christ Jesus set the ex- ample when he came into a world steeped in paganism and sin. His was a life of deprivation and self-sacrifice, but he brought peace and light to the world. His self- giving death brought salvation and healing to all who would ac- cept. He provided hope for the hopeless, help for the helpless, sight for the sightless. He gave strength to the weak, food to the hungry, joy to the bereaved. In the black- ness of sin His life was a burst of light — a serenade in the night. The Christian witness finds him- self surrounded by the darkness of depravity. Around him swirl the IS mists of sin. Darkness has shroud- ed the minds of men in perpetual night. It is a dark, doomed world, but there is a ray of light. Jesus said to the disciples, \"Ye are the light of the world.\" And again, \"Go ye into all the world.\" Into the inky blackness we must go; into the unreached areas, carrying the light of the gospel of Christ. Just as I was disturbed from my sleep, so must we disturb the spiritual sleep of the sinner. We must allow the power of the Holy Ghost in us to shatter the soundproof barrier with which Satan has surrounded his captives. The status quo of the sinner must be disturbed, that he also might become a new creature in Christ Jesus through obedience to the Word. The sinner is groping in dark- ness, but we can help him to find his way out. Just as the Sirens of ancient mythology guided hapless sailors to their doom with their sweet singing, so can we guide lost souls, not to doom, but to eternal life. In answer to God's query \"Whom shall I send, who will go for us?\" may we be like Isaiah who said, \"Here am I; send me.\" Will you be a \"serenader\" to those in sin's night? Carry to them the joy- ous news of salvation which is truly a serenade in the night. # SERVICEMAN ABROAD?

Now it was not easy, the culture being dif- ferent, the language difficult, and at times the living even danger- ous. But these things were not nearly so difficult to bear as when the natives whispered and lied about the missionaries and stole their goods. This was hard for the missionary to take and to keep on loving these people. In fact, he seemingly could not take it. When someone stole from him, he began to avoid that person; and if one lied or whispered about him, he simply could not love him but rather ignored him from that very day. Because of his attitude, the mis- sion board called him home. And upon hearing of it, the home folks, those of his own church, gos- siped such things as, \"Didn't he know before he left that mission- aries must love the unlovely? What's wrong with him? The per- son who lies and steals is the very person who needs his help most. He should have done everything to get next to those people spiritual- By JOHN M. DRESCHER ly, rather than avoiding them when they stole from him.\" And with many other such expressions did they speak one to another. Now it happened that in that missionary's home church there were many fine orthodox families. There were also nearby others who were unsaved, whom the pastor was laboring hard to win. It was known that these neighbors to the church sometimes lied, even stole. And so it came to pass on a certain night that one whom the pastor and other saints were seeking to help to Christ stole a small item from a member of the church (at least it was reported so). Even worse, it seemed he lied about taking it. Ah, that was hard. What should be done? This is what was done. From that day the soul that needed help, the soul who stole and lied, was avoided. \"If he should come to this church, I would quit attending,\" said the church member. \"If that's the way he acts, the best one can do is to stay as far from him as possible. Don't give him a chance to get you again.\"' And with many other expressions did they speak one to another. And thus the one who needed help most, the one. of all people, who should not have been avoided, the one whom the pastor was seeking to save for the Saviour, was driven farther from Christ. It came to pass that when some- one asked how the church mem- bers could so freely criticize the actions of the missionary, yet treat the people in the neighborhood in the same manner that the mission- ary had treated the heathen, the common answer was, \"The situa- tions are different.\" Nonetheless, some persons doubted this reason- ing. A few brave souls were heard to say, \"We think that a lost soul should be saved, whether that soul is in the homeland or on the mis sion field.\" The sinner who was accused of stealing from the church member lived within a stone's throw of the church for years afterward, yet no church member ever witnessed to him. Finally, that neighbor died, having never known God, and no church member felt guilty for not witnessing to him. However, the church gave freely to foreign mis- sions each year, for the people said they loved lost men of other lands© 20 A Forecast of the Future Continued from page 9 rumors, or even the bloodshed. We are not aware that every new war, every outbreak of violence, every threat, and every rumor are indica- tions that the hourglass of time is running out. The materialistic American who is wrapped up in pleasure, moneymaking, and crea- ture comforts of this life, is cal- loused to the prophecy of the Lord Jesus Christ. The face of the world is changing overnight. Maps are redrawn. Geography books are rewritten. And the man who specializes in current events is sometimes embar- rassed by their obsolescence by the time they get off the press. It is not a question any longer of when will war come; we are already engaged in a global struggle. The United States of America has failed to realize that the Communists have already declared war. As Bertram Wolfe has said, \"They know that they are engaged in a war to the finish — a war for the world.\" We must not be fooled by their cry for peace, and even their will- ingness to negotiate. For this is but another tactic of war. Lenin once said, \"There will come times when we talk peace and we talk war, but always toward world revolution.\" While the world stands in a state of shock, dreading the future, awaiting the outcome of this race for ruin and this suicidal compe- tition, Communism is waging war with sabotage, propaganda, and subversion of the government and the teachers in our classrooms. If Communism can accomplish its purpose — world domination — with- out the use of atomic bombs, its leaders will pursue this course. We must remember that China with its hundreds of millions was won to Communism through propaganda. Today there is enough Communistic literature distributed throughout the world to furnish three pieces for every inhabitant of the earth. In only five decades Communism has brought one billion people un- der its spell. To the Communist, there is no difference in hot or cold war. Hot or cold are merely terms of intensity in the same war. We are locked in a mortal conflict with an anti-God force. A TIME OF TERROR AND FEAR Nineteen hundred sixty-seven will be a time of terror and fear. Men's hearts will fail them for fear of the things that shall come upon the earth. The future will be filled with dread. Since the destruction of the first world, there has been no period of history so filled with fear and terror as this era has been. I am appalled by the prospects of this year. The fear and distress have produced one million mentally un- balanced teen-agers in the United States. The number of mental pa- tients increases by the day. Heart failures mount, and hundreds have lost their balance and their sense of values. The word nuclear-phobia has been coined to describe the fear of nuclear weapons and nu- clear fallout. This fear has liter- ally driven men and women in- sane. But if we are in Christ Jesus, these times need not trouble us. Jesus Christ has given orders for our conduct and attitude in these last days. He can give personal, undisturbed peace in the midst of war, tranquility and poise in the midst of fear, and composure and contentment in the midst of Com- munism's threat. In connection with the happenings of the last times, Jesus said, \"See that ye be not troubled,\" and \"Be not terri- fied.\" All of these things are the prelude to the redemption of God's purchased possession. With this concept of life, we can face the future with confidence! A VERY IMPORTANT FACT!

MOVES FORWARD The beautiful Southside Estates Church of God in Jacksonville, Florida, where Fred G. Swank is the pastor, is making excellent prog- ress. November 13, 1966, was the date of our annual homecoming and dedication of our new educa- tional plant. State Overseer James Stevens preached the dedicatorial message. It was a challenging and stirring message, and our hearts were greatly blessed. There were 252 in Sunday school, and many more came in for morning worship to join us for the homecoming din- ner. Clyne W. Buxton, editor of youth and Sunday school literature, preached a soul-searching message. There were two young men saved and three adults united with the church. We were truly delighted to have our overseer and the Reverend Clyne Buxton with us. Their visit will be remembered for a long time. A new church has been organized in the Arlington area. Our church tithed twenty-six members and ap- proximately 45 Sunday school schol- ars to this church. Our average Sunday school attendance last year was 169; but in spite of the fact that we lost some to the newly organized church, our average in October was 193. On November 6 our attendance was 212. October was a record-breaking month for our church in the amount of tithes received. We are thankful to God for this growth and for the lovely facilities which were built, for the most part, while J. W. Peeples was the pastor. Under his leadership the beautiful audi- torium and educational plant was erected. The eighteen-room educa- tional plant was nearing comple- tion before Brother Peeples left and was completed under the super- vision of our present pastor, Fred G. Swank. The Southside Estates Church of God has some of the finest, most sincere, and consecrated Christians to be found anywhere. It had a very humble beginning in the home of the Reverend Buck Gillispie a little over nine years ago. By the help and grace of God and with the direction of the Holy Spirit, this church will continue to be a shining light and a soul-saving station in this spiritually benighted world. # TSSN CHOIR PLATS CUPID If you were to ask Judy Files Brown what the South Greenwood (South Carolina) Teen Choir has meant to her, it would take her a good while to tell you. The Teen Choir was organized last April in the spirit of revival. That Sunday night the Spirit of God moved the young people greatly. They began running and crying to the altar as wave after wave of glory moved over the con- gregation. When the service was over, twenty-three had been saved and thirteen had been filled with the Holy Ghost. That night they decided to or- ganize a teen-age choir and en- ter the district Teen Talent Pa- rade which was to be held the fol- lowing night. After winning in the district competition, the choir went to Co- lumbia, South Carolina, for Teen Day. There they were chosen to compete for state honors at the camp meeting in July. The South Greenwood teen-agers were thrilled beyond words when they were an- nounced winners for the State of South Carolina over several out- standing teen choirs. Mike Brown came to our Fam- ily Training Hour (YPE) one night and a few days later heard the choir sing. Right away he wanted to know if it would be possible for him to become a member of the choir. He joined the choir and be- came a faithful member of it. Words cannot tell what the Teen Choir has meant to the church. Also, it has blessed the entire city of Greenwood. The choir's picture has appeared in the paper several times with articles telling all about them. The local radio station has taped several of their numbers and played them on later programs. 22 The choir has made several per- sonal appearances and were a blessing wherever they went, not only with their singing but with their Christian testimony. The trip to Memphis, Tennessee, was an outstanding climax to a wonderful summer for the South Greenwood Teen Choir. One firm was so thrilled with the possibility of their winning that it gave the choir seven hundred dollars to charter a bus for the trip. Although the choir did not win in Memphis, one is hard put to convince these teen-agers they are not winners. Last Sunday night as they sang for the service the power of God fell on the entire congregation. They are still sing- ing for the glory of God. Oh yes, Mike and Judy began their courtship when he started singing in the choir. Their dating ended in a beautiful church wed- ding with the Teen Choir singing at the wedding. Mike has joined the church, and he and Judy are now in charge of children's church. They both are leaders in the YPE. A few weeks ago Mike received his call into the ministry. We feel the Lord has used the Teen Choir to help shape the lives of this couple who are working for Him. — James W. Childress, pastor Mike and Judy Brown with Pastor James W.

WITH- OUT OBLIGATION, INFORMATION ON YOUR ' FUND RAISING PLAN, NAME AGF (if under ?l) ADDRESS CITY STATF 1 PHONF — — — 25 By CLARE MISELES Tte Uprai ARRY practically pushed LBud out of the door in an awful hurry to get out of the house before his mother saw them. First, she insisted on meeting the boy who was driving the car on the field trip — and now — (he could feel irritation mounting by the second) now — if she came run- ning to \"Godspeed\" them off — well . . . this apron strings bit was getting to him, that's what! And his mother came running, all right! She dashed out of the kitchen and made it to the front door like a regular track star. Her brown head peeked out, her hand waved lovingly, and her voice oozed with devotion, as she called out, \"Have fun . . . and God be with you both.\" Larry gave Bud a quick glance and exclaimed, \"Mothers!\" It was all he could say, and he hoped Bud would understand and not take him for a \"mama's boy.\" Bud just kept his eyes on the road and didn't answer. \"Sometimes, they just won't let go — \" Larry tried hard to laugh it off, and turned to Bud so that he could join in. But Bud was serious and his mouth a grim line. He made a half turn, eyed Larry for a mo- ment, and said, \"You're lucky!\" \"Me, lucky?\" Larry laughed, and scratched his head, wondering how Bud had reached that conclusion. \"Maybe I shouldn't say lucky — maybe I should say blessed, in- stead,\" said Bud, still dead serious. \"I don't get it — \" Larry scratched his head, again. \"You've got a mother—\" \"Don't we all?\" laughed Larry. Bud shook his head. \"I — I don't. . . .\" \"Oh, I'm sorry — \" Larry's laugh- ter halted. \"I— I didn't know your mother is dead—\" \"She isn't — \" \"I — I don't understand — \" \"My mother and dad are sepa- rated.\" \"Oh—\" Larry shook his head. \"That's — that's tough — \" \"You can say that again!\" Bud's voice dripped with bitterness. \"I — I don't even know where I belong!\" \"Oh!\" Larry was beginning to understand, and asked, \"Do you live with your mother?\" Bud's head shook fast. \"Can't you?\" asked Larry. Bud's head went up and down. \"I could,\" he went on to explain, \"but my mother doesn't care — \" Larry didn't know what to say, but Bud did. \"So you're blessed!\" He turned to Larry. \"See what I mean—\" \"Sure—\" answered Larry, sheep- ishly. \"I — I guess I am — but you know mothers, sometimes they try to tie you with the apron strings—\" \"Apron strings?\" repeated Bud in a rising tone. \"You mean because your mother cares what happens to you, you call that apron strings?\" Larry opened his mouth, but Bud beat him to it. \"Look at the greats! Behind every one there's been a woman — usually a mother! Look at Lincoln! He had two! Both his own mother and stepmother believed in books and learning. They pushed him — they cared! If it weren't for them, he might have ended up clearing land like his father wanted him to do!\" \"Yes, you sure are blessed—\" grinned Bud, later, when he dug into a three-layer sandwich Larry's mother had prepared. Larry ate in silence, flashing a grin back at Bud, and thinking all the time. There was a lot to what Bud said, all right. The more he thought, the more he realized that the \"apron strings\" bit was highly over-played. His mother never really held him back. All she did was listen and suggest and guide whenever she could. \"What if she didn't?\" he asked himself. \"Would he like it?\" He didn't have to probe for the answer. He knew he wouldn't. By the time he got home it was dark, but his heart was lighted up with a thousand candles. \"Did you have a good time?\" asked his mother, eager to hear what happened. \"Better than that!\" grinned Larry. \"You learned something!\" laughed his mother. \"Sure did!\" Larry laughed with her. \"What?\" \"That I'm blessed—\" answered Larry, half smiling, half serious. \"That I know,\" said his mother, sitting down beside him to lovingly touch the curve of his well-shaped head and broad shoulders. \"That I have known ... for a long time. . . . Thank God.\" • 26 THOUGHTS When wicked thoughts come to your mind, These evil things are caused by sin. And wickedness will boomerang, So cleanse your heart and soul within. But when your thoughts are kindly ones — Full of friendliness, joy, and cheer, An inner glow will radiate And charm those people who are near. — Roy Z. Ke?7ip UNAPPRECIATIVENESS I held my hands toward my God And hoped that from His vast, rich store, He'd fill my hands and arms until They could not hold a fraction more. WE TELL ALL OTHERS We tell all others loud and strong, Just what we are the whole day long. We tell by what we do and say, And how we live from day to day. So we will watch each word and deed; The will of God we'll learn and heed. —Wallace A. Ely But greedy heart and selfish hands Felt not the weight and tug and pull Of added things. God cannot add To heart and hands already full. — Roy Z. Kemp IN HIS HANDS God is in my tomorrows, And He cares for me today; I felt His presence near me, This morning while kneeling to pray. He gives me strength and courage, And helps me keep my heart clean, He opens wide the eyes of my soul, And lets His joy be seen. The habit of holy silence Gives me childlike faith and trust. Yes, God is in my tomorrows And today, prayer is a must! — Katherine Bevis NO TIME? While I was working with my flowers, A neighbor, watching, said to me, \"My mother used to grow flowers too. For my wife and I — it just can't be. We haven't time.\" I looked up at him with pity, And thought, he'll never, never know How very close to God I get With these small flowers I grow. Because I've time. I plant the seed, tend with care, And as the days and weeks go by, God gives them life, sends sun and rain, We're working \"partners,\" He and I. We both have time. — Lena Sprague GOSPEL RECORD CLUB SKLP 6001 Just a Rose Will Do— Little Troy Lumpkin SKI.P 6000 Singing Time in Dixie— Statesmen Quartet ANY 3 when you join the Gospel Record Club and agree to purchase six additional records within the period FOR ONLY $298 SKI.P 5995 At Home SKI.P 5998 Big With the Blackwood Chief's Golden Brothers Stairs Choir SING I.P ioor, Gospel Rhythm — Prophets Quartet SING LP 458 Rose Covered Lane — Blue Ridge Quartet SING LP 905 SING LP 403 TV Request— Sing Harmony- Harvesters Quartet Johnson Sisters Sing LP 302 for Meditatio David Reece SING LP 9051 Ho Green Is Your Valley— Gary McSpadde SING LP 2081' The Ministers — Forward in Faith Trio SING LP 7002 The Big Gospel Sound — Goss Brothers SING LP 7071 Old Time Religion- Bob Daniels SKLP 6020 Sing I You — Oak Ridge Boys SKLP 6013 Garden of Melody — Speer Family PLUSoneFREE ALBUM FOR EACH TWO YOU BUY HOW THE CLUB OPERATES Each month the Club's staff of music experts choose out- standing records by the world's most popular Gospel re- cording artists.

GROUNDS tells of a young mother who left her twins bathing upstairs while she answered the cry of another child downstairs in the kitchen. She found the child seriously burned from scalding water pulled from the stove; so she dispatched another child to a neighbor's house to secure help. While racing across the street, this child was killed by an automobile; the scalded child lived only a few minutes; the twins left alone in the bathtub drowned; and the shock of the mutiple deaths was too much for the mother, who slumped to the floor and died. A home that was perfectly normal at sunrise was completely destroyed before nightfall, and the shock and sorrow that came to the relatives must have been nearly unbearable. A tragedy of this proportion is most unusual, but it does point up the fact that we never know what a day may bring to us. Christ is a source of genuine solace and comfort when reversals come; God must pity the person who does not know Him in times of difficulty. Human nature is such that some people seemingly get along fairly well without God when the sun is shining; but when clouds of adversity come — such as the home burning to the ground, or the death of the bread- winner, or the loss of a job with no prospects of another — then persons need something stronger than themselves to which they can hold. They need the assurance that the Lord whom they have followed in the sunshine will be with them in the storm. A man's world caving in is nothing new, for an- cient Job had the experience. All was going well with this man of God: he had property, family, and pres- tige. The day his world caved in started normally: his plowmen went to the fields, his herdsmen went to the pastures, his camels left with their burdens, and his children began a party at the oldest son's house. Then tragedy came to poor Job with machine gun rapidity. The first messenger raced up and panted out the news that the plowing oxen and the feeding donkeys had been stolen and the plowmen slain. Before he finished his incredible story, another mes- senger appeared and breathlessly said that all the sheep and the shepherds had been burned to death, When Your World Caves In while a third runner came and with shortness of breath said that all the camels had been stolen and the drivers slain. As stunned Job heard these shatter- ing reports, a fourth messenger ran in and stated that a storm had blown down the oldest son's house and killed all of Job's children. What would you do in the face of such tragedy? What did Job do? Did he turn his head and forget it? Of course not. A person just does not brush off such experiences lightly. Job turned to God for sustenance when his world caved in. He arose, worshiped God, and said, \"The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord\" (Job 1:21). God has His reasons for allowing trouble to come to us. In the case of Job it was to prove to Satan that Job would remain true to God under adversities. The Father has His secret plans for us, and His way is always best. It is not meant for us to understand everything; we would be as wise as God if we did. Troubles do bring men nearer to God, if they will let them. Adversi"
