        "text": "Acute peritonitis developing in response to gram-negative bacterial infection is known to act as a trigger for the development of acute lung injury which is often complicated by the development of nosocomial pneumonia. We hypothesized that endotoxin-induced peritonitis provokes recruitment of monocytes into the lungs, which amplifies lung inflammatory responses to a second hit intra-alveolar challenge with endotoxin. Serum and lavage cytokines as well as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells were analyzed at different time points after intraperitoneal or intratracheal application of LPS. We observed that mice challenged with intraperitoneal endotoxin developed rapidly increasing serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cytokine and chemokine levels (TNFalpha, MIP-2, CCL2) and a nearly two-fold expansion of the alveolar macrophage population by 96 h, but this was not associated with the development of neutrophilic alveolitis. In contrast, expansion of the alveolar macrophage pool w...\n\nC-X-C chemokines play an important role in the migration and activation of neutrophils (PMNs) during an inflammatory event. We measured mRNA and protein expression of the murine C-X-C chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and KC in the lungs, liver, blood, and peritoneal cavity of Swiss Webster mice after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Neutralizing antibodies to MIP-2 and KC were also used to determine the biological effects of these chemokines on neutrophil sequestration and organ injury in the CLP model. The data showed that early after CLP, MIP-2 mRNA and protein were expressed predominantly by the lung, whereas KC mRNA and protein were expressed by the liver. Inhibition of MIP-2 reduced both lung neutrophil sequestration and peritoneal neutrophil migration. Inhibition of KC had no effect on overall neutrophil sequestration in liver but reduced injury as measured by serum transaminases. An early survival benefit was found with anti-KC treatment, although overal..."
