        "text": "About\n\nJackson County, Florida was established in 1822 making it one of the oldest counties in the state. The County was named after Andrew Jackson, the 7th president of the United States. Marianna, the county seat, was founded by Scottish native, Robert Beveridge, and is still the home to the courthouse and other local governing organizations for the County. Jackson County is home to Chipola College and the Baptist College of Florida. Jackson County is part of a tristate community, bordering Georgia and Alabama.\n\nThough considered a predominantly rural agricultural community, Jackson County is also known for its rich historical heritage and one-of-a-kind historical landmarks. People from all over the world travel to Jackson County to enjoy scuba diving in the natural spring water, taking the only walk-through cave tour in Florida, sightseeing the local “haunted” attractions, or to try to catch a glimpse of local endangered plant life and animals only found in our County."
