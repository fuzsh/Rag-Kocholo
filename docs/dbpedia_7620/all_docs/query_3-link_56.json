They collaborated with several international organizations for PR professionals, except the PRSA, who still wants direct editing to be allowed.

(which would then update automatically)\n\nlooks like this ↑ ~ benzband (talk)\n\nThis week's The Straight Dope column (by Cecil Adams) address the question of Wikipedia's reliability. The verdict? \"From a reliability or any other standpoint, Wikipedia is considerably better than could be accomplished by gorillas.\"\n\nOh, and \"... for settling bar bets, satisfying idle curiosity, or, truth be told, getting an initial fix on a serious research subject, Wikipedia is an indispensable resource. The problem is when even those who know better rely on Wikipedia as the last step rather than the first in finding the facts.\"\n\n-- Powers T\n\nNYRB's Martin Filler really did have the balls to say, in the July 12 issue, \"I am surprised that for someone so concerned about his image and the spread of misinformation, neither Koolhaas nor his office has bothered to correct his Wikipedia entry\". To me it's rather big news that someone of Filler's stature, writing in a serious magazine, would reason this way.\n\nI always wonder why discussions of Wikipedia's reliability always fail to note Wikipedia's transparency. Adams argues that it can be hard to know which Wikipedia articles are up to Britannica's level of accuracy, particularly if the Wiki errors are cloaked in well-composed prose. What he fails to note is that the article history and the talk page discussion are a proverbial open book. The ability to know who wrote it, and why, is the real key to Wikipedia. You don't get that in traditional sources; you only see the final product but not how it was made. --Dennis Bratland (talk)\n\nI've always liked Cecil, and I particularly liked his conclusion \"Probably it would be helpful if all popularizers, including Wikipedia, Britannica, and us at the Straight Dope, permanently emblazoned at the top of our pages BELIEVE NOTHING YOU READ HERE. IT MAY ALL BE LIES.\" In other words, if it is important enough, always do your own research, check out all assumptions, and understand that no source is perfect. The phrase also roughly equates the Straight Dope's quality with Wikipedia's quality. I'd agree with that, Cecil might be a bit more entertaining, but then again, we've got about 4 million more articles than he does.\n\nI'd also mention, as the Signpost already has:\n\n\"If Wikipedia is good enough for the Archivist of the United States, maybe it should be good enough for you.\"\n\nWikimania 2012 Closing Plenary by David Ferriero, Archivist of the United States, see especially (15:00-16:00), and (22:50 - end).\n\nThe word \"maybe\" is important, but still ...

Then all of a sudden, it vanished, and I can't figure out how to turn it back on. Can you remind us technophobes how to do it? Thanks! -- Ssilvers (talk)\n\nHere is the signpost article and here is a link on how to customize the watchlist. --J36miles (talk)\n\nHi. Two Wikimedians are going to the 2012 Summer Paralympics to cover them for Wikimedia projects. This is a great opportunity not just to improve Paralympic content, but also to work towards the goal Jimmy mentioned on his talk page back in January of getting Wikimedians on press passes to the Olympics. If we can successfully pull this off, it offers a great case for going further with this. Wikinews:Paralympic Games‎ is the organising space for this, and some of the flow on will obvious end up on Wikipedia as Wikipedia doesn't allow original reporting or pictures in the same way. It would be great to see this mentioned. :) --LauraHale (talk)\n\nIf we're going to do a write up of this, it should also be mentioned that apparently the International Paralympic Committee is not allowing pictures to be taken and licensed at the event under any license other than CC-BY-NC - i.e. not acceptable for Commons and (because the athletes are all still alive) not acceptable for Wikipedia's fair use criteria). Sven Manguard Wha?\n\nDislike — Crisco 1492 (talk)\n\nYeah. That. I've mentioned it elsewhere. The IOC license is as restrictive if I understand things correctly. It is annoying on the other front because we can't upload pictures taken to Commons because of the need to allow commercial re-use. : / --LauraHale (talk)\n\nDisclaimer: this post should be checked by someone with legal expertise before any of it is taken at face value. From personal experience, similar conditions apply for many other music and sporting events in the UK. But the only enforceable measures that I am aware of are refusal of entry to/ejection from the venue, or confiscation of devices deemed capable of taking images or recordings of a professional standard. It is for that reason that I don't take photographs for Wikipedia. However, I have never known of claims of this nature being enforceable if despite those risks photographs or other media are taken. —WFC—\n\nI've basically been told by the APC that unless we have a special press pass for photography, we can't even really take pictures with a professional camera for a news publication at the event. These were rules stipulated by the IPC, not by the APC. (Thus, I'm debating if I should haul my camera around as I'd rather not risk losing it.) The Olympic bid process often requires the country being willing to change the law to accommodate Olympic rules. If you're not willing to change the rules, you don't get the Games. I'm not certain how much this applies to the Paralympics. (I do know we have freedom of panorama in Australia, and you cannot copyright a live sporting event like you can in the USA. Thus, I own my pictures I take.) --LauraHale (talk)\n\nSee A Reporter's Guide to Sports and Olympics Reporting - TrustMedia.\n\n—Wavelength (talk)\n\nThat's good. Where is the packet for the Paralympics, which is what Wikimedia is sending reporters to? --LauraHale (talk)\n\nI do not know where there is a packet specifically for the Paralympics, but I suppose that much of the advice for sports and Olympics reporting applies to Paralympics reporting also.\n\n—Wavelength (talk)\n\nUnfortunately, nothing in that PDF mentions photography :( Kaldari (talk)\n\nMy press credential says in very tiny print: \"I agree that all photographs and moving images taken by me at the Paralympic Games, including those of athletes competing within any Paralympic venue, shall be used solely for personal and non-commercial purposes, unless prior written consent is obtained from the IPC.\" --LauraHale (talk)\n\nThe Wikipedia:Education_Working_Group met last week in Washington D.C., and we have a lot to do over the next few months. We've posted a brief note on a couple of education program related noticeboards as follows:\n\nSince 2010, the Wikimedia Foundation has actively supported university professors who engage students in making high-quality constributions to Wikimedia projects as part of educational assignments. On July 16 and 17, 2012, a diverse working group of Wikipedians and academics met to begin formulating an enhanced structure for the U.S. and Canada Wikipedia Education Program (WEP) to enable future growth and innovation. Between now and December 2012, the working group will develop a collaborative plan for the future of the WEP. The working group knows that the wider community wants and should have a voice in this process, and so a Request for Comment (RFC) will be issued within the next few months to solicit feedback from the Wikipedia community, educators and ambassadors.\n\nIf the Signpost is interested in mentioning this, we'd be delighted; if you have any more questions about the working group or the plans please contact any of us. I'm the lead person in the working group for communications with the Wikipedia community, so I'd be glad to help; another key person is Jami Mathewson, who is one of the two members of the group from the Wikimedia Foundation, and whose primary responsibility is the US/Canada education program. Mike Christie (talk - contribs - library)\n\nMeet the 'bots' that edit Wikipedia — unusual article, in that it concerns an aspect of Wikipedia I've never before seen discussed outside Wikipedia: bots. Refers to ClueBot, rambot, Chris Grant, Brad Jorsch. Says bots are now vital to the functioning of Wikipedia.

Says you can't do away with human editors.—A bit iffy (talk)\n\nGood to see ol' ClueBot getting the recognition it deserves. (Squirt of oil) The Interior (Talk)\n\nThe article also states \"In 2008, another bot created thousands of tiny articles about asteroids, pulling a few items of data for each one from an online Nasa database.\" I vaguely remember having seen part of this back then, but when I was checking up right now, I only found User:EagleAstroidBot, whose activity ceased (in 2007) at 109 edits rather than after creating the ca. 13k articles envisaged in its BRFA. -- Daniel Mietchen - WiR/OS (talk)\n\nYes, I read this. Don't think that it is worth mentioning in the Signpost though, perhaps point it out in some bot related venues?

Besides an obvious item, this strikes me as again indicating there would be some interest in a feature or Op-Ed debating Wikipedia's possible role in future activism. Note, I am not volunteering.

Nick-D (talk)\n\nI'm pleased to share with all spanish wikipedia lovers a new book entitled \"Wikipedia de la A a la W\" (Wikipedia from A to W; ISBN: 978 84 9029 012 5) authored by Tomás Saorín, assistant professor at the Information Department in the University of Murcia and member of the Spanish Chapter of Wimikedia. It's a compact book aimed to GLAM practitioners and communication studies. It's published into the series \"information professional\" of one of the biggest acadmic presses in Spain, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya(UOC).\n\nWe hope that it helps to spread glam wiki projects in Spain and more a more librarians, archivist and cultural heritage people concerned in a stronger Wikipedia.

As a personal idea, I think it would be extremely useful if we could get lists of m.e.a. for most of the projects which have multiple specialized encyclopedias on their topics, and that having such would be a significant incentive to developing the articles which exist in those published sources, but don't yet exist here.

In this case the alleged central point is that Wikipedia has reached a turning point in its loss of admins. The truth as even the graph they used demonstrates is that the number of Active admins has now been falling for over four years - the turning point was in February 2008 so this isn't exactly news. The next turning point will come when the number of admins falls to a point where we can't maintain adequate 24/7 cover at places like AIV, I don't think we are there yet, but it is only a matter of time.

Like in the \"old days\" perhaps you can try a once-a-week hangout and if successful, revise accordingly. -- kosboot (talk)\n\nSee Wikipedia:IRC.—Wavelength (talk)\n\nmeta:Talk:Requests for comment/Travel Guide#Board statement\n\n-- Powers T\n\nNote: The Wikimedia Foundation has filed its second ever lawsuit - see here. Definitely should be included.--Jasper Deng (talk)\n\nMr. Roth has submitted An Open Letter to Wikipedia through the New Yorker. He was unimpressed by his biographer's failure to remove an inaccuracy from his novel's article, The Human Stain. This episode is now in the article, and the inaccuracy appears to have been fixed. The Interior (Talk)\n\nWhoever writes up the Signpost article on this incident, I hope they will discuss not just this incident, but show that there's a pattern of such incidents: \"Person X complains that Wikipedia is wrong and is seemingly powerless to do anything about it.\" Same with Andrew McAfee last year. I think all of this stems from WP's failure to clarify what it is: the general public thinks it's an online monolithic encyclopedia, but it isn't; the general public thinks it's filled with facts, but it isn't. I think Roth's, McAfee's et. al. criticism point to a way for WP to go forward, by clarifying what it is clearly and succinctly - perhaps as a link from every page to a clarifying statement. -- kosboot (talk)\n\nIn some ways Roth's letter is sad, in some ways it's hilarious, but you have to admit that he's a great writer. I'll suggest somebody (at the Foundation?) reach out to him. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nWhat I find interesting about this is that Roth, by dint of his literary reputation, can publish a complaint about his article in a Reliable Source. Which then allows us to use his personal information as citable info, and the article is improved. The Interior (Talk)\n\nThat's one of the sad things about this. Only if you have a reputation like Roth's can you correct something in the article on you (or similar) that you know is wrong. But see below. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nI don't understand why Roth's original request wasn't considered reliable. Its a primary source, but we do allow primary sources when we're citing someone's opinion as long as we don't attempt to analyze that opinion. We could certainly have said, \"According to Roth, the original model for The Human Stain was...\" and cited the letter as something like \"Personal correspondence from Philip Roth, dated...\" Whoever corresponded with Roth needed to read WP:PRIMARY. BTW, Roth is a wonderful writer an The Human Stain is a remarkable book. I highly recommend it. GabrielF (talk)\n\nIt certainly seems like it could have been handled better (of course I haven't gone through the details) if only by a judicious application of WP:IAR. The other side is that authors do sometimes wish to be mysterious about their sources of inspiration - for many reasons. I've never seen \"personal communication\" used as a source in Wikipedia, and don't think it could be except by an expensive system of verification that we're actually communicating with the person who claims that identity. Sort of OTRS squared. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nUsing personal communication violates our Wikipedia:Verifiability precept. No one else can go and check to make sure we have our facts right, which diminishes us as a source of information. Powers T\n\nRoth's letter notes that he was sending the message through an intermediary, which I'm assuming is an agent or publisher. In that case I don't think verifying the provenance of the sender is difficult. The correct approach in this case would have been to find a way to make this work. We could have asked Roth for permission to post the letter on WikiSource or, failing that, we could have noted that the original correspondence was filed in OTRS with a note that readers could contact an OTRS agent for more information. My understanding is that OTRS agents already do something similar when they make an edit by placing the case ID in the article talk page. Sources don't need to be immediately accessible to all users - we have no problem with academic journals that are held in only a handful of libraries for instance. The wrong approach here was to put Roth into a, frankly Kafkaesque, situation where he had to create his own published source in order to get us to make a change. GabrielF (talk)\n\nBecause in the relevant field, literary criticism, the death of the author is a significant methodological issue that can only be properly resolved by expert secondary sources. Fifelfoo (talk)\n\nThat's what I was thinking. There is no general agreement on the right way to interpret art: to think what the author tells you to think about it, or whether you should interpret it in isolation, or through the lens of your own subjective experience. NPOV requires that we simply cite what good secondary sources have said about the question of inspiration, and never pretend we know the \"right\" answer is merely because the one author insists he has the right answer for us. --Dennis Bratland (talk)\n\nThat's a sophistry which seems to be advocated to excuse Wikipedia - to parody, the article couldn't be wrong, since there's no such thing as wrong when it comes to Aahhrt. However, the author's state of mind - inspiration - is not subject to the same sort of expansive interpretation. One can reasonably interpret a story in terms of X even if that's not the intent of the author. One can't reasonably say an author was inspired by X if the author never heard of it. The author's statements here are privileged above everyone else, even if that's anti-democratic. To be fair, authors can lie or be mistaken or give PR versions (Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds). But also to be fair, none of that seems to apply here. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nStrangely, I find myself agreeing with Seth ;) Kaldari (talk)\n\nReally, it's not such a terrible thing. Often unpopular maybe, but sometimes expert :-) :-) :-) -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\n\"The author's statements here are privileged above everyone else, even if that's anti-democratic.\" that's nice Seth. It isn't what is \"true\" given our penchant for relying on the opinion of experts for our epistemology. If an author's analysis of their own text is published in an appropriate forum, then we can rely on that. We don't evaluate the contents of statements about reality, we evaluate the form with which the content is conveyed in order to determine if it meets our requirements to include. An author's ramblings on their blog about their intentionality mean jack shit. If a review of books publishes an author's opinion of the role of their intentionality in relation to their work, then someone with a field competence to determine if they're speaking crap or not has surveyed the work and approved it as true enough to publish under their imprint. Fifelfoo (talk)\n\nPeople don't believe me, but I find Wikipedia absolutely fascinating, as it's the same way I think in general (tech), but truly taken to absurd extremes. It's like those subgenre science fiction stories. Imagine - \"On Wikiworld, the inhabitants believe nothing is true unless appearing in a Reliable Source, even one's own state of mind. Thus, an author stating \"My book is based on X\" will be sneered at, derided, as \"ramblings\". Were the lowest scribbler to write \"Author's book is based on Y\", it would be unassailable, no matter if it were in fact the most arrant nonsense. They are not totally unaware of the absurdity, but have a saying \"Verification, not truth\". They will passionately defend their creed, explaining that if one person were to claim public authority above the crowd, even in terms of discussing his or her own thoughts, their society would collapse\". One can follow the reasoning, but it ends up in a mind-bogglingly weird place. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nI prefer my discipline's method of producing knowledge, but it is incompatible with the project of producing an encyclopaedia and probably incompatible with an open editing process. Reliability is a smidge more respectable than consensus for establishing that knowledge exists—it puts the problem onto another, external, group of people. It is however compatible with the encyclopaedic project of reflecting existing human knowledge instead of generating new knowledge. Fifelfoo (talk)\n\nHold the phone, that isn't true at all. A blog or any website's interview explaining the theme to a book is perfectly reliable as long as the author wrote or is the interviewee, respectively. cf. an excellent essay I read this week: User:Tom Morris/The Reliability Delusion. Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nExcept, The ed17, they're not. We recognise source escalation as the solution to source conflict, RS/N has regularly recognised limited and tenuous reliability from non-experts in areas covered by expert work, and the expert disciplinary systems (which we esteem) claim very strongly that they produce the best available work and that work produced outside their systems cannot begin to speak about stuff (as in literature) like intentionality. You'd get more leeway if this was criticism of contemporary popular culture where the equivalent of the intellectual review of books is often the semi-intellectual review of doijinshi published in blog format—but even in popular culture, consider the quagmire of heavy metal genre criticism which only escalates towards expertise. I'd suggest that a non-expert forum review of the author won't know how to interview them to access the literary context and won't know whether he's talking crap or not; in a way an outlet with experience will push. I wouldn't trust the NY Review of Books for Touhou evaluation, for example, they lack experience and context in doijinshi criticism. Fifelfoo (talk)\n\nExcept, Fifelfoo, they are. I'm not saying that we should use a blogger's criticism of Insert Book Here, I'm saying that we use author statements no matter where they appear. If the someone is interviewing the author of a book, we don't care who the interviewer is – all we care is that it's the author making a statement about his own book. They don't have to know how to interview if we're quoting the author's words directly. Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nMake sure you note in the Signpost that Roth was improperly trying to get his biographer to remove information that he shouldn't have ever touched, i.e. the opinions of literary critics about his book. Especially when his refutation of the critics' statements was included in the article already in the next sentence. Furthermore, that there was nothing for us to use as a reference. Him saying something to us on Wikipedia isn't a primary source, it's not a source at all. If he had stated the information on his personal website or blog, then it would have been a primary source and good to use. SilverserenC\n\nAside from the question of sourcing, this incident also raises a question of customer service. Could the community have communicated with Roth and his representatives in a way that didn't leave Roth wanting to write a letter in The New Yorker? There are certain things that customer service people are trained to do in order to leave customers feeling like they've been helped and not hindered in their interactions. For instance: demonstrating that you understand where the customer is coming from and offering alternatives. I think we would be well served to look at what we can do as a community to make article subjects feel like the process of having their concerns addressed is not onerous. GabrielF (talk)\n\nIt would have been much easier for everyone involved if Roth had written some sort of blog post explaining the background to the book; other than that, it gets difficult, because I don't think he ever actually stated what the true inspiration for the book was before his open letter. Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nThe letter has now been picked up on by the BBC. It Is Me Here t / c\n\nAgain, the entire incident and its coverage illustrate that the vast majority of people do not understand how Wikipedia works and fault it for not being like traditional forms of print where a simple phone call will result in an immediate retraction. I bet Roth and his agent *still* do not understand this. What are we doing to correct the erroneous impression? -- kosboot (talk)\n\nI wouldn't say it's \"traditional forms of print\" (my emphasis), but more like \"traditional scholarly norms\". The problem is that trying to correct this runs straight into the public image of Wikipedia, to put it gently. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nI think this is a good point worth exploring further. We are an encyclopaedia. Encyclopaedias may have been edited in the past, but they certainly couldn't circulate rapid retractions and were vast collective efforts which lacked the (as a whole effort) scholarly expertise. The closest I can think of is the OED which crowd-sourced much of its work. It took OED ages to push a diff or version change in the past. Even more so than OED, we are a collective non-expert and edit as a collective non-expert. Even when many of us possess expert experience in disciplines, professions or sub-cultures; we still edit as non-experts and in a non-expert fashion. None of us have the capacity to believe Philip Roth's personal communication (OTRS are not \"one of us\"). All of us have the capacity to use consensus decided systems of knowledge verification to believe what someone has published about Philip Roth.

It is a 'Learning Project' within Wikiversity, a sister project to the highly regarded Wikipedia. A wiki is a website which allows its users to add and modify its content via a web browser.\n\nThis new wiki is called The Science Behind Parkinson's Disease and everyone throughout the world, particularly those affected by Parkinson's, is invited to participate as a reader or a contributor. Go to http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:The_Science_Behind_Parkinson%27s to have a look at what has been produced so far.\n\nWhat's the general idea?\n\nPeople affected by Parkinson's want to know what the prospects are for better treatments and a cure. There is an increasing amount of research going on but it is a difficult and time-consuming job to follow this and to understand the significance of the various developments. For the lay person, understanding the science is a big hurdle. But a lot of people around the world want to do this and many are trying to do this in their own individual ways.\n\nThis wiki has been set up so we can share the results of our often painstaking investigations and explain to others in straightforward terms what we have learned. Through this wiki we envision building a framework to make sense of the concepts, ideas and discoveries about what Parkinson's is, how it affects the nervous system and how it might be confronted and we can keep updating it as progress is made. Above all we can explain new discoveries and their significance in terms that are clear and understandable.\n\nThe sources of knowledge and understanding\n\nWe learn from the experts – i.e. from the researchers doing invaluable work in various disciplines – whose papers and reviews we read and whose talks we hear at conferences and meetings. We hope we can go further and encourage such professionals to engage with and contribute to this wiki, adding new insights and correcting any misconceptions we as a largely lay community may have.\n\nWe know that full-time researchers welcome contact with those for whose benefit they are ultimately working. We hope, therefore, that the wiki can be another example where interaction and collaboration can help inform strategic research decisions to bring closer the achievement of effective therapies towards a cure.\n\nAll may join this creative community\n\nThis wiki is an entirely volunteer-run initiative, is not controlled or sponsored by any organisation and is open to anyone to participate by editing and contributing material. It operates under the same principles that underpin community projects like wikipedia and wikiversity. It is globally accessible (although at present the language used is confined to English).\n\nPlease publicise this initiative to anyone who might be interested. And do consider participating yourself! http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:The_Science_Behind_Parkinson%27s\n\nAn Active Community - Contemplating and Communicating - the Complexities of Parkinson's\n\nComprehensively and Comprehensibly\n\nThis Parkinson's Science wiki has been started by a few individuals and now is being opened up globally to interested parties who would like to participate in its development.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions about the initiative or want more guidance about how to be involved.\n\nJohn Telford\n\n(Alias Droflet: my Wikiversity User Name)\n\nThe plural: magic word recently broke in a number of localizations with the introduction of Common Locale Data Repository–based plural rules.

Mostly a fairly well-done recap of past controversies, but also including some criticism of Wikipedia's PR and transparency. Dcoetzee\n\nBatten down the hatches. While it's \"mostly a fairly well-done recap ...\", there's some phrasing in there which could be a problem. I'm not sure how much we'll see in public, but I'm pretty sure there's going to be an angry missive in reaction. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nWikipedia has serious issues. Even its most diehard supporters admit that. Wikipedia is also not particularly good at solving those issues; most of the time the pattern goes 1) realize an issue exists, 2) debate endlessly about it and fail to agree on a solution, 3) a scandal that people saw coming but couldn't stop (because of step two) happens, 4) a reactionary, somewhat poorly thought out, usually poorly implemented fix is rushed through by either the WMF or the community, 5) the problems with the quick fix are never addressed because not enough people agree on how to fix it and everyone is too afraid of the type of the scandal repeating.\n\nI actually welcome criticism of Wikipedia, if it's done right. The issue is that it usually isn't. There's a rather significant difference between \"I've identified X problem, it's occurred here and here, and I suggest Y to fix it.\" and \"The idiots over at Wikipedia keep doing X, and so Wikipedia is garbage.\". Both options identify a problem, but while the first posits a solution and tries to back up the problem with some sort of context, the second does neither, and opts to go straight for insults. I suppose that at least for groups like Wikipedia Review and Wikipediocracy the reason that they go to insults so quickly is that their communities are heavily populated with people who have been chased out of Wikipedia, and hold deep personal grudges against the project. That taints their view of everything Wikipedia just as much as my having spent several years happily editing the project taints my views in the other direction. I don't know why the writer in the piece above went the insult route himself; it could be that his brand of snark is what gets reads, it could be any number of other things. I suppose it really doesn't matter though. Ultimately, the author's own writing style undermines his credibility.\n\nHostile snark has its place, but it's awfully poor at offering analysis and starting intelligent discussions. Sven Manguard Wha?\n\nThere's some excluded-middle in your analysis above. And critics are not obligated to fix Wikipedia's problems - \"Wikipedia is garbage\" is a maximal statement, to be knocked-down, but \"Wikipedia has huge amounts of garbage and extensive garbage issues\" is quite defensible. There is a place for that sort of polemic _per se_ (abstractly), against the extensive hype promoting Wikipedia. You might also take into account that too many Wikipedians wallow in being obnoxious to people who criticize Wikipedia, even to the point of making vicious personal attacks bordering on libel against those who cannot fight back (i.e. banned users). This might be said to undermine their credibility, but that argument is rarely raised (can't say never, I've seen it happen, but it's unfortunately not common), and certainly more honored in the breach than the observance. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nYou're correct on many counts. There is a middle ground. I never stated that there wasn't, my intention was to illustrate the gulf between the ideal and some of the worst that we see. There is certainly value to the middle ground, and I have little issue with people pointing out problems but not offering solutions, so long as they give at least some context and avoid being utter douchebags.\n\nAs to your comment on \"too many Wikipedians wallow in being obnoxious to people who criticize Wikipedia\", this is also correct. In some cases, however, we get into a 'which came first' style debate. Rarely have Wikipedans gone after the banned users that quietly faded away. Rather they tend to go after the ones that continue to cause trouble in one way or another. Wikipedians, like all humans, can get obsessive and protective of the things that they value (in this case, Wikipedia). When a banned user goes to large numbers of news articles that mention Wikipedia and leaves nasty, misleading comments about Wikipedia, it's going to understandably cause blowback, and some of that blowback is going to be from people handle the situation more poorly than others. An ideal world would have Wikipedians leave the banned users alone, but would have the banned users leave Wikipedia alone as well. I seriously doubt that a vast majority of Wikipedians would spend the time to go after banned users if they didn't feel that the project was under threat. There are simply too many other more interesting and important things to do. Sven Manguard Wha?\n\nWell then, forgive me my mistaken inference from \"done right ... it usually isn't\" that suggestions to fix are a requirement. But regarding \"cause trouble\", I find that to be an unfortunately elastic phrase, where continued criticism of Wikipedia might qualify in some minds, and hence \"blowback\" of borderline-libel personal attack. I must strongly disagree with any implication (note, this means it need not be stated explicitly) that even \"nasty, misleading comments about Wikipedia\", justifies retaliation. That's way too close to fair-game cult smearing tactics (\"An ideal world would have existing acolytes leave the apostates alone, but would have the apostates leave the Church alone as well.\"). When you talk about \"under threat\", you might consider that snarky articles can arise from motives that Wikipedia can appear very threatening for understandable reasons, feared as a top-ten website apparently run by cliques (not cabals), infested with martinets, fakers, and hucksters. That's a downright scary picture, given the power Wikipedia wields overall. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nIndeed, the language of article was so sensationalistic that once I saw references to Fox as a legitimate news organization, then I realized that objectivity was not part of the author's purpose. -- kosboot (talk)\n\nDoesn't look like there's anything new in the article.

On Nov 9, WMF took down a series of such images by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen as part of a DMCA takedown - see commons:Commons:Village_pump#DMCA_Take-Down. They are arguing that although German law protects reproduction of the works, US law does not, and so the images are illegal derivative works inside the US. If this viewpoint is accepted it will lead to a dramatic change in policy (images of copyrighted sculptures would become forbidden worldwide) and the deletion of many thousands of images, so the decision is highly controversial, reviving prior discussions on how assets might be moved to other nations.

I find it a little bit behind the times, but at least this significant organization broaches the idea that Wikipedia is actually a valid resource to be used. -- kosboot (talk)\n\nPerhaps significant (not my area) but I'd still be wary having college students citing Wikipedia. Sure, if I cite something on a featured article like Sudirman to Wikipedia it might be viable, but what about messes like Abdurrahman Wahid or Islam in Indonesia?

Then, from this 8 November 2012 post, I found that Wikipedia has two new namespaces: Education Program:Main and TimedText:Main. I missed the project wide consensus discussion to add these two new namespaces. I didn't find any policy or guidelines on either of these namespaces. I discussed this a little with Justin here, but there does not appear to be any Wikipedia standards by which these new namespaces are to be used. Perhaps you can put a reporter on digging up the who, what, where, how, why, and when of these new namespaces. Thanks! -- Uzma Gamal (talk)\n\nJust a moment ago, I clicked on and Education Program:Main saw \"The action you have requested is limited to users in one of the groups: Administrators, Course coordinators, Course online volunteers, Course campus volunteers, Course instructor.\" That was not there a few minutes ago!

The Interior (Talk)\n\nAccording to the article BP turned to Wikipedia to estimate size of spill, U.S. alleges in The Globe and Mail, an executive at BP is alleged to have relied on Wikipedia (specific WP articles are not mentioned) to estimate how much oil was being spilled into the Gulf of Mexico as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, ignoring the company's engineers' estimates. Mindmatrix\n\nThis sounds pretty bizarre even for BP, even for Wikipedia. I tried to track down where that might have come from in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill article and it seems like nobody had much of an idea in the first few days, maybe 1,000 barrels per day (BPD), instead of the 5,000 BPD given by the exec a week or two later, vs. 62,000 BPD now estimated. The lower numbers seem well-sourced at the time coming from BP execs (!) via AP or the BBC, and later from the Navy as well. There's an incredible circularity in this - would anybody try to fool himself this way? I'm skeptical of how or why a Wikipedian could be (even unintentionally) involved. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nI think the executive was looking at other articles for information about estimating the size of the spill. For example, here's the 19 April 2010 version of the article Oil spill, which already contained the section Estimating the volume of a spill. Mindmatrix\n\n(EC below) That sounds much more likely (though still incredibly stupid on the exec's part) than the 2 scenarios the newspaper account suggested to me.\n\nA. that some Wikipedia editor did some OR or just guessed at 5,000 and then the exec relied on this; or\n\nB. that BP was trying to pull the wool over people's eyes and planted the 5,000 figure.\n\nA doesn't seem to have happened (the numbers were properly sourced to BP), and B wouldn't fool anybody since the estimates were sourced to BP. Still, your possible version (I'll call it C) would involve some use of the referenced software, so BP scientists would almost certainly be involved. Which leads me to another possibility D. somebody just wanted to put down the exec's intelligence, but rather than just saying \"the guy's a dumb jerk\" dressed it up as \"the guy got that from Wikipedia.\" In short, it still doesn't look kosher to me. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nThere's more detail here: \"...David Rainey cobbled together information from Wikipedia and internet sources to produce a falsely low flow rate estimate ... pegged by a very preliminary National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration report at 5000 barrels per day. ... performed his own daily estimates, purportedly using the ASTM and Bonn methods ...\"--Yannick (talk)\n\nWell, it looks like I'm making the same type of mistake as the exec - talking about things I don't know anything about. From the upstream source: \" \"Rainey's Bonn estimates resulted in best-guess estimates that were significantly higher than 5000 bpd and high-end estimates of up to 92,000 bpd. Rainey withheld his estimates from individuals working on flow rate estimates within United Command and, later, also withheld them from Congress.\" He also \"manipulated\" ASTM calculations to arrive at estimates of between 5000 and 6000 bpd, but they were not achieved using that method, the bill said. \"\n\nSo it looks to me he went beyond Wikipedia. I'm still guessing Wikipedia had almost nothing to do with it. Smallbones(smalltalk)\n\nThe Upstream article links to the indictment itself: \"After learning of NOAA's preliminary and heavily-qualified 5,000 BOPD estimates, defendant RAINEY, an executive who had no prior experience in spill estimation, surfed the Internet for information about how to conduct oil-spill-volume estimates based on observations of oil floating on the surface of a water body, known as \"mass balance\" estimates. Defendant RAINEY's internet search led him to a website where he found a Wikipedia entry that described some generally accepted mass balance methodologies, including the American Society for Testing and Materials (\"ASTM\") method and the European \"Bonn\" method.\" and later \"Defendant RAINEY falsely labeled the estimates he included in the memorandum as \"ASTM\" calculations.\"\n\nSo he was an amateur pretending to do science, and tried to sound smart by using some keywords and formulas found in Wikipedia. Rather than snipe at the Globe and Mail reporters, who probably know more about journalism than we do, why don't we just include this in the \"Wikipedia in the News\" segment?--Yannick (talk)\n\nOk, I'm starting to figure out what's going on. I would (if I had anything to do with it) include it in \"Wikipedia in the news\". But as long as I'm sniping I'll blame it all on the headline \"BP turned to Wikipedia to estimate size of spill, U.S. alleges.\" That whole concept seems so strange, I had to look into it and be skeptical. Turns out the guy is alleged to have intentionally \"reverse engineered\" his estimates and intentionally lied to the public and to Congress. Wikipedia is mentioned once in the indictment (your quote above), makes the lede of the newspaper article and the headline as well. Attention grabbing, not an outright lie, great journalism!

I actually had a discussion along these lines just yesterday with a relative who is a public school teacher. On their faculty mailing list someone opened a discussion of how students should use Wikipedia and everyone expected fireworks. What happened instead was broad agreement that it is an appropriate starting point for research.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Greg Kohs is bad mouthing Wikipedia in the comments section. I hope I never get so bitter about something that I feel like I have to monitor the internet 24/7 for any mention of it so I can leave negative comments.

Beeblebrox (talk)\n\nPerhaps I shouldn't do this, but I feel the need to defend Wikipedia criticism, especially in article comment sections. It seems to me there's a nasty catch-22 - Wikipedia can have an enormous hype-machine, full of puffery ranging to dishonesty - but that's considered OK. However, let someone repeatedly try to counter that hype, and just doing so is too often taken as a per se basis for making personal attacks on them. It's one thing to criticize the content of what someone says, and if it's repeatedly false or wrong, to take them to task personally for it. But Wikipedians should really be the last people to criticize devotion to a topic itself, abstractly. There's very much a glass house in that case. I don't think you'd react well to someone saying \"Oh, Wikipedians, I hope I never get so obsessed with an Internet site that I feel I have to monitor some sort of watchlist 24/7 for anyone messing with it. Maybe there's a story about obsessives who should get a life already ...\" -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nQ100.000 reached at Wikidata, a mile stone reached 25 days after opening the wiki.

(FC does run on a slightly different timespan, which is noted at the top of each edition) Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nIn a new article \"Invasion of the cyber hustlers\", Wikipedia figures prominently, for example \"It is surprising how often Wikipedia is cited by such cyber-pedlars as a paradigm of communal \"knowledge creation\", given that Wikipedia explicitly bans the creation of any new knowledge. Its highest law is \"no original research\", barring any mention of either \"facts\" or \"ideas\" that are not already published elsewhere. Observance of this edict has the effect that Wikipedia is entirely dependent on its cited sources, including newspaper and journal articles, for the \"knowledge\" it contains. This does not mean that Wikipedia is useless - far from it - but it is not an example of what it is so often claimed to be.\" -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nFor all of Steven Poole's blustery cynicism about \"free content\", I find it ironic that he released his first book as a free PDF. Kaldari (talk)\n\nHe does note - \"There you go: if you write a book with the book as the goal, you are a fool. A book's correct function is that of a business card that gets you invited to where the real action is.\" There's nothing that prevents him from practicing it :-). More seriously, there are people who play a game while at the same time despising it, hating what it does, and loudly decrying it. We shouldn't let any superficial irony there discredit a well-grounded indictment of that game (even from a player). -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nPoole sets up a straw man stating that \"Wikipedia is cited by such cyber-pedlars as a paradigm of communal \"knowledge creation\"\", a claim I've never seen made in the media or by WP supporters. The claim usually made is that Wikipedia is a knowledge repository, collection, or aggregator, which of course is consistent with \"barring any mention of either \"facts\" or \"ideas\" that are not already published elsewhere\".

I had assumed Cla68 intended this as a joke. --Demiurge1000 (talk)\n\nActually, the article has a good point. How can Jimbo complain about libel when WP, which he cofounded, has a track history as one of the biggest websites used for defamation in the history of the web? He complained and WND altered their article text within days. Many people have complained about their BLPs in Wikipedia and have had to wait months to obtain help, if indeed they were helped. Cla68 (talk)\n\nI suppose it comes down to one's stance on the amount of humor in irony. He can complain, as a matter of right. But, in the purest sense it's ironic to be reading material like this: \"Wales also argued that the factual accuracy of Wikipedia's own \"Bomis\" entry is irrelevant: \"We are not discussing Wikipedia. If there are errors in Wikipedia, this does not relieve you of the moral and legal responsibility not to defame me, sir. You know that.\" \". It may be a true statement - but that doesn't mean it can't also be a humorous one, on a certain level recognized by the many people who have had to deal with false statements in their Wikipedia biography. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nThe photo of Cap'n Jimmy and the Babes is just priceless. The Interior (Talk)\n\n(with apologies to Gilligan's Island) \"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a site's gray shades. That started from some web ring ads, and ended with Bomis Babes\" -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nHere we are at December 19 and it appears DYK has only four Christmas hooks to feature. We are desperately in need of someone to pen a few Christmas hooks to fill the DYK stocking. Any chance the next Signpost (assuming it is due before the 25th) could include a request for some Christmas submissions? Thanks, Gatoclass (talk)\n\nSee \"How Wikipedia Edits Tragedies\", \"What Wikipedia can tell us about the future of news\". Dcoetzee\n\nI was just wondering if we could get a mention of the Simple English Wikipedia in an upcoming Signpost. Here is a link to the discussion there.\n\nHere is some suggested verbiage that we worked up.\n\nAre you interested in expanding your role in other MediaWiki projects outside the English Wikipedia? Do you find that the the English Wikipedia is too hard to read, use or edit? Try the Simple English Wikipedia version of Wikipedia. It uses fewer words and easier grammar. At the start, it was designed for people learning English. Its style may help readers understand difficult concepts. With just over 90, 000 articles, less rules and easier to read articles it offers possibilities to editors who may feel limited in what they can do in the English Wikipedia.\n\nIf this isn't the right place for this or if you need to modify it just let me know. Kumioko (talk)\n\nUnless you can convince Mabeenot to put it in the WikiProject Report's In Brief, I'm afraid not. There's no 'newsworthy' news to cover from Simple, and we don't do advertisements, even from projects. Apologies, Ed [talk] [majestic titan]\n\nOk thanks. I think hitting 100, 000 articles will probably meet the notability criteria so maybe I'll come back then. Kumioko (talk)\n\nSee \"Wikipedia doesn't need your money - so why does it keep pestering you?\" Needless to say, it's very selective with its facts. I don't find any of the expenditures it highlights to be particularly objectionable. Dcoetzee\n\nAbstractly, I can see both sides of the argument over expansion and reserve. But having two sides also means it's a legitimate topic of debate. Some poor student donating their lunch money because they are under the impression that Wikipedia is running on a shoestring and server costs are dominant, might have a different view to find out about how relatively little is going to servers and similar, versus various very arguable initiatives. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nIt is important that our donation campaign doesn't give the wrong impression about what donations are used for, and that spending info is immediately available and easy to understand during the donation process (rather than buried somewhere), but an honest account would break down overall spending by percentage, rather than cherry picking a few very small items intended to incite an emotional reaction like this article does. Dcoetzee\n\nWhile I understand your objection, I think it's a valid journalistic technique to give a small example which is a concrete illustration of a much larger problem. The article does have information about overall allocation. But specific dubious spending is helpful too. Yes, this sort of presentation can be abused. It's a fact-specific matter, as to whether it's illustration or manipulation. However, the motto of Wikipedia fundraising is essentially \"incite an emotional reaction\" (remember the supposed little girl in Africa), so it can hardly be out of bounds itself. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nI completely appreciate criticisms of the WMF's rapid expansion, but this is a carefully crafted smear piece and nothing else. Let's look at a few of the more ridiculous statements:\n\nClaim: Wikipedia is now a powerful lobbying organization; Truth: Wikipedia temporarily contracted 1 guy in DC to keep tabs on SOPA as it was going through Congress.\n\nClaim: Wikipedia is getting millions of dollars from corporate grants and is thus beholden to corporate interests; Truth: None of the grants he cited are from this year and Wikipedia has continually worked towards accepting fewer and fewer grants, especially any with strings attached. Part of that effort is why we ask the public for donations.\n\nClaim: Wikipedia has more money than it knows what to do with; Truth: We only collect as much money as we have budgeted for each year. The budget process is completely transparent and widely open to public input (probably more so than any other non-profit on earth).\n\nClaim: Part of why Wikipedia participated in the SOPA blackout was due to influence from Google; Truth: The opposite is closer to the truth, as I'm sure anyone involved in the blackout knows. The decision to participate in the SOPA actions wasn't even decided by the WMF, it was decided by the community. Once the decision was made, we did inform Google, but certainly not because they are our corporate taskmasters.\n\nKaldari (talk)\n\nSigh. I have a (perhaps mistaken) belief that it's beneficial for someone to participate in Wikipedia discussions from the critic's point of view. But I'm not sure it does any good, especially when there are such great differences in perspective. I fear I cannot devote the time necessary to write a lengthy rebuttal to your contentions above - there is simply too vast a gulf separating us. To note one point, for extensive evidence on the influence of Google, and the manipulations of the Wikipedia community, I refer you to this ongoing discussion. If you do not find that material highly supportive, I believe nothing I say will be productive. -- Seth Finkelstein (talk)\n\nAll I see is some absurd conspiracy theory about Fight for the Future and Reddit also being controlled by Google. Besides, the community being influenced by Google is not what Andrew's article is claiming. Andrew's article is suggesting that the Foundation is influenced by Google (which it isn't), and that this influence is due to money. You can accuse the Foundation of a lot of things, but you can't accuse it of being controlled by corporate interests. Freedom from corporate influence is the Foundation's religious mantra. It's the only reason we have the stupid annual fundraiser. The Foundation could easily just seek large gifts and grants (with all the strings attached) like every other non-profit and skip the fundraiser entirely. Kaldari (talk)\n\nFor those of us who know a bit about Wikifinances, the ideas in the article seem somewhat sensationalist or just off-point, but I do think the author is doing us a favor, by letting people know that there is information here that can be looked into. In short the article is inoculating us to more serious misinformation that is almost certain to come. My biggest complaint is the last sentence \"But the organisation does seem to be presenting an incomplete picture.\" Not so, th"
