        "text": "by Gideon Marcus\n\nVicious Varangians\n\nReliving the Middle Ages \"as they ought to have been\" is all the rage now, from Renaissance Pleasure Faires to The Society for Creative Anachronism to The Byrd's song, \"Renaissance Faire\". Not to be left out, our corner of San Diego has decided to put on its own Viking Fest, featuring axe-throwing, mead-drinking, and general revelry.\n\nOf course, the seasoned time-traveling Journey crowd attended!\n\nSomething to cheer about\n\nIt's been a while since I've been able to report on a issue that's good from bow to stern (recognizing that such things are rare, of course–Sturgeon's Law ensures much of what anyone reads must not be the best). I'm happy to report that this month's issue of Fantasy of Science Fiction was quite enjoyable.\n\nby Chesley Bonestell; as usual, it doesn't illustrate any of the stories inside\n\nHome the Hard Way, by Richard McKenna\n\nChief Biotech Skinner Webb of the Galactic Patrol Ship Carlyle is determined to jump ship. The why: planet Conover is the loveliest world Webb has ever espied, and its richest denizens have offered him the moon…and a chance at love with a plump and gorgeous scion.\n\nSadly for Skinner, he's got a seven year hitch. And so, he does his damndest to get out of it, going AWOL, starting fights, even consorting with a criminal element. All it does it lose him stripes and put him under Vry Chalmers, his former adjutant and long-suffering friend. Will Webb ever get to paradise?\n\nAuthor Richard McKenna seems to write more now that he's dead than he did when he was alive. I quite enjoyed this space-based yarn, and I particularly appreciated the frequent appearance of women in the navy–as high rated enlisted men, no less. I don't think I've ever seen that particular touch in a story. We've had women officers (q.v. Star Trek and Starship Troopers), but no women grunts. Certainly, it's a rare thing.\n\nOf course, as my wife notes, why anyone would fall for Skinner Webb, when he's something of a lummox, is a bit of a mystery. But perhaps we just have an unsympathetic narrator. In any event, this story gets an unreserved four stars.\n\nThe Inner Circles, by Fritz Leiber\n\nThe artful Leiber offers up this tale of a family that seems to create its own reality. The father molds ebony companions out of shadow, with whom he converses over watered-down martinis. The mother sketches fanciful worlds and imagines that the machines of the house talk to her. And the son is an interstellar rocket jockey, aided by just a few toys as visual aids.\n\nNotable for including the second use of the word \"shit\" in as many months in F&SF (will the mails stop carrying this trashy publication?) and for a surprising but welcome happy ending, this is another good piece. Leiber, a veteran stage actor, has mastered the art of rendering the theatrical in his prose. Four stars.\n\nSpeaking of Leiber…\n\nCamels and Dromedaries, Clem, by R. A. Lafferty\n\nCleminger is a big man, one of the hottest traveling salesmen in the country. In fact, he's a little too big: one day, he falls asleep in a hotel and splits into two beings–externally identical, but somehow each half a man. The two go on to live separate lives, until their desirable and desiring wife, Veronica, demands an end to the intolerable situation.\n\nLafferty is always whimsical, but this piece feels a bit more grounded than most–more Ellison than Lafferty. Once again, it's enjoyable from beginning to end. That's three four-star stories in a row!\n\nThe Power of Every Root, by Avram Davidson\n\nNow off to sunny Mexico, where Carlos Rodriguez Nunez, police officer of the municipality of Santo Tomas, finds himself increasingly afflicted with physical maladies, as well as furtively derided by his townsfolk. Is it a disease? A hex? The doctor cannot help, and the witch doctor's advice seems spurious. Surely his luscious wife, Lupe, is above suspicion…\n\nDavidson, once editor of F&SF, fled to Mexico for a while after abandoning the helm of this magazine. He clearly absorbed enough of the local color to vividly paint this tale. While ably told and a beautiful travelogue, the plot itself is rather slight, so I'm afraid three stars is my limit for this one.\n\nCorona, by Samuel R. Delany\n\nI've often complained that everybody else gets to review Chip Delany's work but me. Well, I got what's coming to me. This story involves a troublemaking hulk of a blue collar man named Buddy, who forms a rapport with \"the prettiest little colored girl\" named Lee, afflicted with uncontrollable telepathy. Said nine-year old has seen too much to want to live any longer. But her love for the popular music of Bryan Faust, particularly sharing it with Buddy, may give her a new lease on life.\n\nIf it weren't for the sentimentality, I'd say this is more Analog than F&SF. That said, despite the obvious attempts to be moving, I found myself curiously unmoved by this tale.\n\nThree stars.\n\nMusic to My Ears, by Isaac Asimov\n\nSpeaking of music, Dr. A manages to take a potentially interesting topic–namely, the mathematical relationships between wave frequencies that underlie the fundamental scales of music–and make it not only dull as dishwater, but also virtually impenetrable.\n\nAnd I have both a math and a music degree!\n\nTwo stars.\n\nAlas, Poor Yorick! I Knew Him Well Enuff, by Joan Patricia Basch\n\nEquity's a great gig. It's virtually impossible to get canned from a show when you're equity, even if you're dead! But what if you really need that not-dead skull who's a member of the guild to shut up so you can finish the damned play?\n\nBasch has written a cute story, and it's likely to wring a grin or two from you, if nothing else.\n\nThree stars.\n\nTime, by L. Sprague de Camp\n\nPoetry by a regular contributor of same, this time lamenting over the greats he'll never meet, and the fans he'll never know.\n\nThree stars, I guess.\n\nCry Hope, Cry Fury!, by J. G. Ballard\n\nWe return to the crystalline seas of Vermillion Sands. A yachter by the name of Melville is stranded when his sand boat blows a tire. A wraith-like vision of a woman named Hope offers succor, but her obsession with an old flame (whom she may or may not have killed) belies the pleasant qualities of her namesake.\n\nI tend to prefer Vermillion Sands stories to the more kaleidoscopic stuff Ballard has been turning in of late. There's more of a through-line. I also like the idea of photographic paints that depict ever-changing portraits of their subjects.\n\nI don't think I'd give it four stars, but it's definitely interesting.\n\nPraise be to Odin!\n\nWith no bad fiction and some solid hits in the first half of the mag, this issue of F&SF is definitely something to foray from home for (it's not as if the Vikings got home delivery of their sf mags.) That's something to toast to!\n\nHere's looking forward to more of the same in the issues to come.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\nIf you're here, you're obviously a big fan of classic fantasy and science fiction. As you know, I founded Journey Press to revive lost classics and to bring into bring new works that evoke that same timeless quality.\n\nI think you'll very much enjoy our newest release. You've probably heard of Marie Vibbert, one of the biggest names in SFF magazines these days. Her book, The Gods Awoke, is what I've been calling \"a new New Wave masterpiece\":\n\nDo check it out. You'll not only be getting a great book, but you'll be supporting the Journey!\n\n</small\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nImitation is…\n\nI think it's safe to say that, for almost twenty years there have been three Big Science Fiction Magazines. Each aims at a specific branch of the scientification fandom. For instance, John Campbell's Analog (formerly Astounding) is at once the hardest of the Big Mags, focusing on near-future gizmo tech or sweeping galactic epics with a scientific core, and also one of the softest, given John's weakness for psi stories.\n\nThe Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction covers the literary end of the STF spectrum, and it also veers into the outright fantastical (q.v. the masthead). Galaxy navigates a sort of middle path between the two.\n\nBut the most recent issue of FS&F had me wondering exactly which magazine I was reading again, for this month, Ed Ferman's publication feels a lot like Campbell's. Perhaps writers have finally answered FS&F's plea for harder works, or maybe Ferman finally had a sufficient number of such pieces to fill (most of) an issue. Either way, it's an interesting departure, especially with the increased art throughout. Does it work? Let's find out!\n\nby Ronald Walotsky\n\nNuts, Bolts, and Dragons\n\nReduction in Arms, by Tom Purdom\n\nMy good friend Tom Purdom offers up this fascinating piece set in the early '80s. The superpowers have bound themselves by the Treaty of Peking to curtail the development and implementation of terrible weapons. But there is always the suspicion that one side or another is working on some version of a \"ninety-five plus virus\"–one that will wipe out most of a non-incoluated population.\n\nSure enough, American agents are tipped off when a Soviet biologist, supposed to be a patient in a specialized \"role-play\" treatment center, is found cavorting with ladies at a bar 30 miles away. A raid is authorized. Between hostile Soviets and rogue team members, the investigation quickly becomes fraught with peril.\n\nTom himself has this to say about the tale:\n\nAfter I got out of the army in 1961 I became very interested in arms control and disarmament. I did a lot of reading on the subject and ended up writing two articles for the Kiwanis magazine (a good middle market for a new writer). An opportunity to write an article for Playboy didn't work out but I got to interview some of the people I'd been reading.\n\nFred Pohl suggested I write a story on the subject for Galaxy. I didn't think I could handle the technical stuff needed for a story about detecting nuclear weapons so I decided to write about biological weapons which seemed like they might be the next big threat. Microbiology labs, in addition, can be hidden in all sorts of small spaces. I decided to focus on a treaty banning secret research because I had come to the conclusion we tended to run the arms race against ourselves. Our people thought up a possibility and we had to work on it because the Russians might be working on it. If we could determine they weren't, both sides could avoid another cycle in the arms race.\n\nI picked a mental health facility as the hiding place because it raised interesting human and moral issues. The story revolves around ethical and political issues instead of a duel between inspection technologies and evasion technologies. The programmed environment therapy seemed like a natural extension of Pavlovian conditioning.\n\nFred Pohl rejected the story. My agent, Scott Meredith, tried it on Redbook and Esquire with near misses at both places. The fiction editor at Esquire said he wanted to buy it but he was overruled by higher ups.\n\nThe story was a novelette, about ten thousand words. Playboy said they'd buy it if I could cut it in half. I did but they rejected it. Ed Ferman at F&SF liked the short version but felt it needed to be longer. So I expanded it to its original length. He bought it and now it's the August cover story. One of the peak moments in my writing career, so far.\n\nThe story grew out of intense, solid research and some deep thinking on the whole problem of arms control. When I finished it, I felt I had summarized and dramatized the key issues and dilemmas. Perhaps the sweeping treaty in the story isn't very plausible. We live in a time when the advance of technology makes serious arms control seem a necessity–so necessary even the politicians will have to see it. Science fiction explores What might happen if? The If may seem unlikely, but is still worth exploring.\n\nI originally called the story \"1980\". Ed Ferman asked for a change and I thought Reduction in Arms had a nice military clatter. I also suggested War and Peace and A Farewell to Arms but he preferred Reduction in Arms.\n\nThere's no question that Tom has gotten a feather in his cap for the placement of this tale. I will say that, although I found the concept interesting, it suffers for being an action piece told in third-person by a largely uninvolved party. Visceral immediacy would have given the story more punch.\n\nStill, it was interesting to see a Reynolds-esque thriller outside of Analog— and without the nardy slang Reynolds employs.\n\nThree stars.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\nThe Conflict, by Ilya Varshavsky\n\nHere is an import from the Soviet Union, about the large and small scale strife between humans and their increasingly sapient \"servants\".\n\nI think it loses something in translation. Two stars.\n\nThe Baron's Dog, by L. J. T. Biese\n\nWhen an unemployed governess in Italy is offered 25,000 lira a month to walk a Transylvanian wolfhound, what's a girl to think? Especially when the employer is tall, dark, handsome…and strictly enjoins against photography of his pet?\n\nI found this tale delightful, such a nice contrast from all the creeping horror that such a setup normally would have entailed. It's not quite Analogian, but it is good. And if L.J.T. Biese isn't a woman, I'll eat my hat.\n\nFour stars.\n\nSoft Come the Dragons, by Dean R. Koontz\n\nKoontz is a brand new author, and he offers up the tale of a far-off world, the miners who live in fear upon it, and the gossamer dragons that turn beholders to stone. It's all rather metaphorical and lyrical and not quite sensical, rather as if Koontz spent the night reading Zelazny's works and then tried his hand at it.\n\nI'd say it works more than it doesn't, but Koontz' rawness definitely shows through. Three stars.\n\nEarthwoman, by Reginald Bretnor\n\nWill Adamson, born on a distant world, is human in all qualities save one: he and his race are possessed of telepathy, knit into a consciousness collective. He is sent to Earth to discern how it is that we can love without the possibility of true connection. And if we truly be human, is there an innate telepathic skill just waiting to be awakened?\n\nBretnor usually write silly stories or bad puns, so this more serious piece is a welcome change. I found it a touch too affected, but otherwise enjoyable. And definitely something that could have appeared in Analog.\n\nThree stars.\n\nby Ed Emshwiller\n\nMosquito, by Theodore L. Thomas\n\nF&SF's story seeder suggests mosquitos might be laden with vitamins and inoculants such that their bite becomes a beneficial distribution method. As usual, he misses some important aspects of his invention. To wit, mosquito bites are not controllable in distribution or quantity. And even if they provide needed drugs and nutrients, they still aren't pleasant to receive.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nBugs, by Charles L. Harness\n\nSpeaking of bugs, Charles L. Harness (who used to team up with Thomas under the pen name Leonard Lockhard) has authored this story of living bugs employed as espionage bugs.\n\nThere's a lot of \"as you know\" explanations, and the smugness with which the Americans subvert their KGB counterparts is pure Analog.\n\nMildly interesting, but just a bit too glib as well as prolix. Two stars.\n\nThe Bubble, by J. W. Schutz\n\nThe destruction of humanity's first and only space station has spooked the government, and now they've decided to pull the plug on space investment. Deane Aircraft, the largest space contractor, is faced with a pivotal decision: retool back to making conventional vehicles, or become the first private space presence. The linchpin to the success of the operation isn't Theodor Deane, President of the company, nor the thousands of engineers he employs. It's certainly not Theodor's greedy wife, Lillian, nor her paramour, Briggs, who is also Theodor's financial wiz.\n\nIt's Georgia Lighton, Theodor's secretary, who comes up with all the brilliant, cost-saving ideas.\n\nThe whole thing reads like a cross between Silverberg's Regan's Planet and a soap opera. Again, very Analog.\n\nNot great, but Analog. Three stars.\n\nMoondust, the Smell of Hay, and Dialectical Materialism, by Thomas M. Disch\n\nThe first man on the Moon, Mikhail Andreivich Karkhov, is dying. Does he die for science? For love? For the state? Or something else entirely?\n\nA beautiful, moving piece, made all the more poignant by the recent twin tragedies that claimed the lives of three astronauts and one cosmonaut.\n\nFive stars.\n\nby Ed Emshwiller\n\nArgent Blood, by Joe L. Hensley\n\nA man is being treated in a ward for the incurably insane. Between fits of \"disturbance\" he begins to mistrust the charitable nature of his doctor and nurse. But he has a plan…\n\nA good, atmospheric piece. Three stars.\n\nKaleidoscope in the Sky, by Isaac Asimov\n\nIn a rare return to topics astronomical, Dr. A. submits a nonfiction piece on the moons of Mars, and how these extremely low flying rocks would appear to a surface observer. If, indeed, they are even suitably placed to see them, for unlike our Moon, Phobos and Deimos orbit so close to their planet that Martian pole-dweller could not see them.\n\nGood stuff. Four stars.\n\nQuick with His Hands, by Avram Davidson\n\nCapping things off, this vignette of sibling rivalry on Mars, ably told and with a tearjerking finale.\n\nFour stars.\n\nDoing the math\n\nSo, did F&SF's experiment in apery succeed? Well, there were high points and low points, but the overall impression I was left with was favorable. We'll just have to compare it to the real thing in just over a week to see if Brand X beat the competition!\n\n(Speaking of kooky stunts, it looks like F&SF is joining forces with several other organizations to hold a writing contest. I wish them the best of luck, although the last time a magazine (Galaxy in that case) did this, in the early '50s, they got bupkis, and Fred Pohl had to write as a novice under a pseudonym to give them anything worth publishing.)\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nJoke's on me\n\nI have a buddy in the Costume Designers Guild (you know her, too — she's Gwyn Conaway). She keeps me up to date with the inside dope on Hollywood. One tidbit she offered up recently was something she paraphrased from a manual for actors published this year: the last words of the actor, Edmund Gwenn, who passed away in 1959. A visitor to his deathbed exclaimed that his final ordeal must be hard for him.\n\nGwenn replied, \"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.\"\n\nI think it was in Lighthouse, a fanzine for pros, that Lester del Rey suggested more writers should go into comedy rather than flogging the same tired \"serious\" science fiction canards. The problem is that humor is harder than seriosity. An inexerpt attempt to make one laugh produces the opposite effect.\n\nAnd God help us all if an editor decides to fill an entire magazine with failed attempts. This month's Fantasy and Science Fiction, for example…\n\nNo laughing matter\n\nby Howard Purcell\n\nSabotage, by Christopher Anvil\n\nChris Anvil normally writes for Analog. His stories often pit humans outstmarting aliens with a bit of clever sophistry those stupid ETs (inevitably made of straw) could never conceive of, let alone counter. How one of these tales got into F&SF, I'll never know.\n\nThe setup: the vaporous Tamar and Earth are in a stalemated war. Earth has the technology, but Tamar has the psychology. They possess our people and try to sabotage our efforts. None of their attempts have been particularly successful, but the latest threatens to be a doozy. College students are becoming increasingly disaffected by something they're being taught, and while the immediate effect is small, the cascade could be disastrous. Luckily, Officer McAmerican (every character's name is in Rank Surname format) is able to counter the insidious teaching with a lesson plan of his own.\n\nObviously, this is some kind of anti-Communist metaphor; again, one wonders why Campbell didn't pick it up. Perhaps he's full up on Anvil stories. F&SF may pay more these days, too. Anyway, Sabotage is three times longer than it needs to be — or it's infinity times longer, if you feel the story never needed to be written.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\nThe Mystery of the Purloined Grenouilles, by Gerald Jonas\n\nIn his first published story, Jonas gives us a baroquely told tale of a man who creates energy through reverse Galvanism: he hooks frogs up to a generator and tickles their legs.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nDoubting Thomas, by Thomas M. Disch\n\nDisch is an author who started so promisingly, but if this story, of a computer designed to suss out the veracity of magical events, is any indicaton of where he's headed, he might as well throw in the Smith-Corona.\n\nIt just ain't funny, nor is it fun to read. One stars.\n\nThe Martian Atmosphere, by Theodore L. Thomas\n\nThe \"science\" article describes what we know about the components of Mars' atmosphere. Thomas seems to believe that because there's no oxygen that something must have happened to it. Which presupposes it was ever there in the first place. He also assumes that the carbon dioxide that makes up the majority of the Martian atmosphere is a byproduct of respiration.\n\nAt some point, we're going to have to come to terms with the fact that there's no life on Mars.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nVon Goom's Gambit, by Victor Contoski\n\nTake any position of the pieces on the chessboard. Usually it tells of the logical or semi-logical plans of the players, their strategy in playing for a win or a draw, and their personalities. If you see a pattern from the King's Gambit Accepted, you know that both players are tacticians, that the fight will be brief but fierce. A pattern from the Queen's Gambit Declined, however, tells that the players are strategists playing for minute advantages, the weakening of one square or the placing of a Rook on a half-opened file. From such patterns, pleasing or displeasing, you can tell much not only about the game and the players but also about man in general, and perhaps even about the order of the universe.\n\nContoski's tale, also apparently his first, is about an opening so repulsive, it is irresistible. I'm a sucker for chess stories, and this is the first readable piece in the issue.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Green Snow, by Miriam Allen deFord\n\nAt first, it seems deFord will provide a bulwark against the droll tide. After all, deFord is quite deft with menace and creep, skilled at eliciting deep and dark emotion, but she doesn't do comedy. Thus, while a story that begins with the gentle falling of green-tinted snowflakes could have been a romp for others, in deFord's hands, it's clear we're in for a horror.\n\nShe executes it well-enough, though there's something of the last decade about it in its flavor. But then, as if prodded by an editor overeager to have every story fit his chosen theme for the month, deFord adds a heavy handed joke at the end.\n\nWhich, of course, falls flat. deFord doesn't do comedy…\n\nThe Gods, by L. Sprague de Camp\n\nIf there is humor in this short poem about the passage of the gods from human devotion, it is ironic. In all fairness, I did enjoy this piece quite a bit.\n\nFour stars.\n\nThe Symbol-Minded Chemist, by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe always good-humored Doctor A manages to stave off the jokeyness for another dozen pages, writing on the origin of chemistry's alphabet soup. I always enjoy etymological articles, although the list of elements by alphabetical order of their chemical name seems a bit of padding.\n\nFour stars.\n\nBumberboom, by Avram Davidson\n\nIt is centuries after The Bomb, and the resulting, almost anarchic society that sprawls across the Eastern Seaboard is threatened by Bumberboom. It is a great cannon, though it has not fired a shot in generations, tended by an increasingly inbred crew, whose Captain Mog, somewhere between an idiot and a moron, is the brightest of the bunch.\n\nEnter Mallian, son of Hazelip, who sees the ancient gun as an opportunity to carve a feudal realm out of the upstate New York, with him as its sovereign.\n\nBumberboom reads something like a cross between Jack Vance and R. A. Lafferty, combining the poetic resonance and creative settings that are the signatures of the former with the sometimes incomprehensible whimsy of the latter. Davidson's problem is that when he decides to go for funny, he often writes himself into a twisted corner, his sentences meandering to get free of themselves.\n\nStill, once you're into it, it's not so bad. Three stars.\n\nThe punchline\n\nBut not so bad is also not so good. My nephew, David, called me last month to let me know he'd let his subscription to F&SF lapse. I told him he was overreacting, that things had gotten better since Ferman had taken over from Davidson. Now I can already hear an \"I told you so\" coming my way.\n\nNo joke!\n\nNot me this month.\n\nby Jason Sacks\n\nOne of my favorite sci-fi publishers these days is Ace Books. We've talked about their double novels a lot on the Journey, so I'm sure you're well aware of them, but I'd like to take a moment to consider just how delightful their line has been over the last decade-plus.\n\nFor the last 15 years or so, Ace's flip books, or tête-bêches if you want to get all French about them, have presented a wide spectrum of science fiction from some of the grand masters. Asimov, Brackett, deCamp and Dick have all been published under the Ace banner along with more modern writers like John Brunner, Kenneth Bulmer and Damon Knight. And while some of these little novels haven't been great – Agent of the Unknown, to choose one at random, has a fun cover but an uninspiring story – others are thoroughly delightful.\n\nAnd best of all, all these little novels are all short! Most are 120 pages or less: a quick couple hours' read while on the bus or after school.\n\nWhether delivered as an opportunity to repackage Ziff-Davis novels, or a chance for a young writer to experiment with his or her craft, or a chance for an older writer to burn off an unpublished tale, the reader gets real value from his or her 35¢ (in the '50s) or 50¢ today. And whether the reader discovers a nice treasure or total drek, the low price point and quick-read style of the books seldom leaves a bad taste in the mouth.\n\nThe biggest thrill for me with these Ace novels is to get to see a growing science fiction talent spread his or her wings a bit and deliver a terrific first novel. Rocannon's World is exactly that kind of thrill. Written by up-and-coming author Ursula K. LeGuin, this expansion of an earlier Amazing Stories tale shows a passion for alien cultures that demonstrates a unique and intriguing viewpoint.\n\nRocannon's World is a kind of sci-fi/fantasy hybrid. Our protagonist is Gaverel Rocannon, an ethnologist on a mission to explore the biology of the planet Fomalhaut II. Though Fomalhaut II is nominally under an exploration embargo by the League of All Worlds, the League's enemy establishes a base on Formalhut to battle them.\n\nIf you're thinking this sounds like the launch of one of those novels all about the lone hero fighting and defeating a staunch enemy, you're both right and wrong. Eventually Rocannon is able to win, but he only does so after a long and arduous — and exciting — journey, and only after causing himself great trauma and pain.\n\nFormalhut is an intriguing planet, and LeGuin gives this planet an clever sort of fantasy feel. Rocannon and his native companions fly on \"windsteeds,\" giant flying cat creatures, he encountrers dwarflike Gdemiar, rodent like Kiemhir, elven Fiia, even nightmarish creatures just called Winged Ones. It all feels like a bit of lesser Tolkien, and that gives this brief book a lot of its charm.\n\nBut charming as this book is, LeGuin wrote something more interesting and complex than a simple story about a battle on another planet. Rocannon goes through an archetypical journey to his heroism. He starts a bit feckless but soon learns the importance of his journey. After enlisting the help of newfound friends, Rocannon gains confidence and trust. His moment of transformation happens when he goes into a mountainside cave. While in the cave, he encounters \"the Old One\", a strange entity who grants Rocannon \"mindspeech\", or telepathy, in exchange for giving himself to the planet.\n\nThat mindspeech is a blessing and curse, granting Rocannon the ability to win his war but also granting him the chance to psychically feel the pain of all the beings he has killed.\n\nAll of this is heady stuff that expands on the considerable promise Ms. LeGuin has shown in her short stories. Though the novel has some flaws, most of them are tied to its abbreviated length. There's a feeling throughout of playing with key ideas and concepts, a kind of authorial exploration of her own mind. I hope we get to return to this world, but even more I hope the author has more good novels in her.\n\nRocannon's World 3.5 stars\n\n[Note: This novel appears to be a sequel of sorts to Dowry of the Angyar, reviewed in these pages two years ago (ed.)]\n\nI was surprised and happy to discover I liked the flip side of this double novel nearly as much. I've never been a big fan of Avram Davidson's stories in the mags, finding them a bit wordy and dull. Somehow, though, this novel clicked in for me much more than his short stories usually do, and I found myself intrigued and captived by a lot of The Kar-Chee Reign.\n\nKar-Chee takes place in a far-future Earth. Hollowed out by over-mining and ecological collapse, Earth has been abandoned and forgotten by her children who have long since settled on distant planets. Only a small number of humans remain on the planet, eking out a small subsistence lifestyle. Those humans, though, are imperiled by an insectlike alien race called the Kar-Chee, out to strip Earth of its few remaining minerals, for reasons completely unknown to humans.\n\nAs with the LeGuin novel, you can probably guess how Mr. Davidson's story will play out: a group of humans rally their forces, gather up their courage, build smart weapons and begin to beat back the invaders and reclaim Earth's birthright.\n\nLike Rocannon, the pleasure in Kar-Chee lies in its journey, not in its destination. Davidson delivers large amounts of expository text in this book, giving readers the background of Earth's downfall in a lyrical style that feels as evocative as stories told around a campfire. Those sections of this novel have a suprising power and I found myself missing the expository elements when the book settled back into its action-packed elements. I wonder if Mr. Davidson has any interest in writing a future history chronicle, because I would love to read something like that.\n\nThe Kar-Chee Reign: 3 stars\n\nThe April '66 Ace Double turned out to be… well, aces, or at least a Jack and a Queen. Who knows what the next publication will bring? I'll be haunting the paperback rack at my local Woolworth's till the next book arrives.\n\nby Victoria Silverwolf\n\nKeep Watching the Skies!\n\nThe good citizens of Michigan were recently reminded of the warning I've quoted above, from 1951's The Thing from Another World (a loose cinematic adaptation of John W. Campbell's 1938 novella Who Goes There?).\n\nFather and son describe what they saw.\n\nFolks in Washtenaw County (just look for the city of Ann Arbor on the map, and you're smack dab in the middle of it) reported seeing strange lights in the sky last month. Supposedly, a UFO even landed in a swampy area near the tiny community of Dexter Township.\n\nLooks like a classic flying saucer to me.\n\nAbout one hundred people witnessed these phenomena. Naturally, the federal government got involved. They sent astronomer J. Allen Hynek to the area to check things out. Reportedly, he thinks at least some of the sightings can be explained as swamp gas. One politician isn't so sure.\n\nNote that the article uses the phrase marsh gas. One person's swamp is another person's marsh, I suppose.\n\nGerald R. Ford is a United States Congressman from the Grand Rapids district of Michigan, so this situation strikes close to home for him. (He's a Republican, and the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives. Maybe this event will make him famous.)\n\nHere's a picture of Representative Ford and wife Betty on a recent fishing trip, so you'll recognize him if his face shows up in the news in times to come.\n\nIt Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\n\nWhile some Americans are tracking down UFO's, others are searching for ways to justify their nation's involvement in the conflict in Vietnam. As a counterpoint to the many demonstrations against the war, a patriotic song celebrating the heroism of the Army Special Forces has been at the top of the charts for several weeks. The Ballad of the Green Berets, sung by Sergeant Barry Sadler, seems to have struck just the right note with many conservative music lovers.\n\nPersonally, I prefer the Tom Lehrer song I have alluded to above.\n\nHunting Through the Pages\n\nMeanwhile, I've been searching for good reading. Take, for example, the latest issue of Fantastic. Fittingly, many of the stories feature characters who are on quests of one kind or another.\n\nArt by Frank R. Paul.\n\n(I might add that I had to search through piles of old pulp magazines to find the original source of the magazine's cover art. It turned out to be the back cover of the September 1944 issue of Amazing Stories.)\n\nConfused? We'll get to an explanation of this weird scene later in the issue.\n\nThe Phoenix and the Mirror, by Avram Davidson\n\nLet's begin our journey with a new novella from the former editor of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.\n\nIllustrations by Gray Morrow.\n\nThe author's introductory note explains that the ancient Roman poet Virgil, author of the Aeneid, was depicted as a sorcerer in legends of the Middle Ages. (Davidson prefers the spelling Vergil, which I will use for the name of the fictional character in this story. He also prefers nigromancer to necromancer and Renascence to Renaissance, but that's typical erudite eccentricity on his part.) He also notes that this tale is the first part of a series to be called Vergil Magus.\n\nAnyway, we begin in medias res, with Vergil trying to escape from an underground labyrinth full of malevolent manticores. (These are not the lion-scorpions of myth, but something more like large, clever weasels.) He manages to get out, winding up at the palace of an aristocrat with magical powers. She forces him to undertake the extremely difficult quest of creating a very special enchanted mirror, so she can see where in the world her daughter might be. He can't say no, because she steals one of his souls.\n\nYou read that right. People in this world have more than one soul, it seems. Losing one isn't fatal, but it seems to be so traumatic an event that Vergil feels compelled to undertake the nearly impossible task. He has to obtain unrefined tin and copper ore from the far ends of the known world, and then form the mirror through a long and laborious process. After many struggles, with the help of his alchemist sidekick, he manages to complete this onerous undertaking.\n\nThe mirror in use.\n\nThat isn't the end of his troubles, however. After instantly falling in love with the daughter after one glimpse in the mirror, he treks through desert wastelands, with an enigmatic Phoenician at his side, to rescue her from a Cyclops.\n\nThe lady and the cyclops.\n\nThis isn't the typical brutal, dimwitted Cyclops from mythology, but an intelligent, even sensitive creature. Multiple plot twists follow, and we find out why a phoenix is mentioned in the title.\n\nDavidson keeps his baroque writing style under control here, and the plot is cleverly crafted. The background, which is kind of a mixture of the ancient world and the Middle Ages, with a strong dose of pure fantasy, is unique and interesting. Some readers may be impatient with several pages describing in great detail the exact method of creating the mirror, but I found it fascinating.\n\nMy one major complaint is that Vergil's lengthy and dangerous voyage to obtain copper ore is skipped over almost entirely, related in just a few sentences of flashback. I would like to learn more about his adventures there. Maybe Davidson plans to expand this novella into a novel, as authors of science fiction and fantasy often do. Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed this witty and imaginative excursion into a past that never existed.\n\nFour stars.\n\nSeven Came Back, by Clifford D. Simak\n\nCover art by Robert Gibson Jones.\n\nAs usual, the rest of the magazine is filled up with reprints. Let's start with a tale from the pages of the October 1950 issue of Amazing Stories.\n\nIllustrations by Arthur Hutah.\n\nThe setting is Mars, the favorite world of SF writers. Like many fictional versions of the red planet, this is a place where humans can survive without spacesuits. It's still a very dangerous environment, however, with all sorts of deadly creatures living in the endless desert.\n\nThe protagonist is on a quest to find the fabled lost city of the nearly extinct Martians. He hires a couple of tough guys to guide him through the wasteland. As we'll see, this turns out to be a big mistake.\n\nSix Martians show up at their camp. It seems that they're the last of their kind, and they think that the men can lead them to a seventh. The Martians have seven sexes, you see, and this is their last chance to reproduce. (That must certainly make things complicated.)\n\nIf the humans help them out, they'll take them to the city, which is supposed to be full of fabulous treasures. The two roughnecks take off on their own, leaving the protagonist alone in the deadly desert.\n\nThings get a lot stranger after this, and I don't want to give too much away. Suffice to say that the main character manages to survive, wins an unexpected ally, and has a mystical experience at the city.\n\nThe lost Martian city.\n\nAt first, I thought this was more or less a science fiction Western, with the hero heading for a showdown with the no-good polecats who left him to die. I have to admit that the plot went in completely unexpected directions. I'm still pondering the meaning of the ending. The author mixes space adventure with his usual warmth and concern for all living things and a touch of Bradbury's magical Mars.\n\nFour stars.\n\nThe Third Guest, by B. Traven\n\nThe mysterious author of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre offers a fable of life and death that appeared in the March-April 1953 issue of Fantastic.\n\nCover art by Richard Powers.\n\nLike everything else about the author, the provenance of this story is puzzling. As far as I have been able to determine, it was written under the title The Healer, was first published in German in 1950 as Macario, and somehow wound up with its current title when it showed up in Fantastic.\n\nIllustrations by Tom O'Sullivan.\n\nOne of the few facts known about the author is that he — or she? — lives in Mexico, the setting for most of his — or her? — fiction. This tale is no exception. It takes place when the region was still known as New Spain, during the colonial period.\n\nMacario, a dirt-poor woodcutter, barely manages to feed himself, his wife, and their many children. For most of his life, his greatest dream has been to eat an entire roast turkey by himself. Over several years, his wife saves the tiny payments she receives for doing chores for slightly less poverty-stricken folks. She buys a turkey, prepares it exquisitely, and presents it to her husband, telling him to go into the woods and devour it alone.\n\nBefore he can enjoy the delicious feast, however, three strange visitors show up. The first is a sinister fellow, richly dressed. He offers Macario enormous wealth for a share of the turkey. Macario refuses.\n\nThe first guest.\n\nThe second one is poorly dressed, gentle, and saintly. Despite his kindly manner, Macario again refuses to share his meal. The visitor blesses him anyway.\n\nThe second guest.\n\nThe third guest, as the title suggests, is the one most vital to the plot. Macario knows he cannot refuse this cadaverous figure, so he at least manages to keep half of the turkey for himself. In exchange, the guest gives him an elixir that will cure all ills, but only if the visitor chooses who will live and who will die. The rest of the story follows Macario as he wins a reputation as a great healer. A summons from the Viceroy of New Spain, whose child is dying, leads to a final confrontation with the third guest.\n\nThis is a remarkable fantasy, with the simplicity of a folktale but the sophistication of great literature. It appeared in The Best American Short Stories 1954 (edited by Martha Foley), so I'm not alone in my opinion. It was even made into a Mexican movie in 1960, which you might be able to catch at your local arthouse cinema, if you don't mind subtitles.\n\nFive stars.\n\nThe Tanner of Kiev, by Wallace West\n\nThe last time we met this author, it was with a reprint of the antifeminist dystopia The Last Man, to which my esteemed colleague John Boston awarded one star. Even if we ignore that story's political stance, it's poorly written. Will this tale, from the October 1944 issue of Fantastic Adventures, be any better? It could hardly be worse.\n\nCover art by J. Allen St. John.\n\nThe first thing to keep in mind is that this is a story about World War Two, written and published during the height of the conflict. You have to expect Our Side to be heroic Good Guys, and Their Side to be sadistic Bad Guys. In particular, the Soviets are definitely on the side of the angels here.\n\nIllustrations by Malcolm Smith.\n\nThe hero parachutes behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied Ukraine. His mission is to deliver a radio transmitter to the underground resistance. Things get weird pretty quickly, as he runs into an immortal magician from Russian folklore.\n\nThe wizard and his pets.\n\nNext thing you know, he's at the chicken-legged hut of the legendary old witch Baba Yaga. None of this supernatural stuff seems to bother him, and soon he's on his way into Kiev. He contacts the Russian guerillas, including the pretty female one with whom he falls in love. With the help of the warlock and witch, as well as a talking squirrel and a were-rat, the brave Soviets overcome the craven Germans.\n\nGiven the fact that, inevitably, a wartime story is going to paint things in black and white, this isn't a bad yarn at all. It's pretty well written, and the wild and wooly plot held my interest. The changes in mood from whimsical to romantic to horrific are disconcerting, and the love story is a little sappy, but's it worth a read.\n\nThree stars.\n\nWolf Pack, by Walter M. Miller, Jr.\n\nCover art by Leo Summers.\n\nThe Second World War is also the background for this story, from the September-October 1953 issue of Fantastic, but this time the battle rages in Italy instead of the Soviet Union.\n\nIllustrations by Bernard Krigstein.\n\nThe main character is the pilot of an American bomber who has already flown nearly fifty missions, raining destruction from the skies. He has recurring dreams about a alluring woman he thinks of as La Femme, or just La. It would be easy to dismiss this as a predictable fantasy for a young man deprived of female company for an extended period of time, or as an idealized image of his girlfriend back home. Yet she seems very real, and he appears to be in some kind of telepathic communication with her, even while awake.\n\nThe woman known as La.\n\nDuring his latest bombing run, he nearly aborts the mission, terrified that he might destroy her. The other members of the crew have to physically restrain him to complete their gruesome task.\n\nA bomber's world.\n\nThe author was a radio operator and tail gunner during World War Two, participating in as many bombing missions over Italy as the story's protagonist. It's no surprise, then, that the details of life as a bomber pilot are extremely realistic and convincing. Miller took part in the bombing of the Benedictine Abbey at Monte Cassino in 1944, which certainly had an influence on the writing of his award-winning novel A Canticle for Leibowitz (1959), already considered a modern classic.\n\nUnlike the previous story, which, understandably, was full of gung-ho patriotic glory (much like Sergeant Sadler's hit song, come to think of it) this is a somber, emotionally powerful account of the way that war turns men into machines, and how the innocent suffer as much as the guilty.\n\nFive stars.\n\nBetelgeuse, in Orion: The Walking Cities of Frank R. Paul, by Anonymous\n\nI wasn't sure if I should even bother discussing this little article, but what the heck. It originally appeared under the slightly different title Stories of the Stars: Betelgeuse in Orion, supposedly by a Sergeant Morris J. Steele in the September 1944 issue of Amazing Stories. This is probably a pseudonym for the magazine's editor, Raymond A. Palmer, but I can't prove that.\n\nCover art by Julian S. Krupa.\n\nAnyway, after some facts about the giant star, we get wild speculation about the beings who might live there. It's pretty much just a way to fill up some space.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe End of the Search\n\nWell, my search for enjoyable fiction certainly paid off! This was an outstanding issue. Even the worst story was pretty good, and the best were excellent. It makes me ponder my skepticism about reprinting old stuff. After all, I don't complain when an movie from yesteryear shows up on television, as long as it's a good one.\n\nCheck your local listings to see if this decade-old classic will be showing in your area any time soon.\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nLeaving things hanging\n\nThere's something compelling about things left incomplete – from Schubert's Unfinished Symphony to President Kennedy's first term. In the gaps of what could have been, we can fill in countless possibilities rather than just the one.\n\nThis month's Fantasy and Science Fiction (like this month's Galaxy, an \"All-Star\" anniverary issue) trades almost exclusively in incompletes, its pieces ending in ellipses dots rather than hard stops.\n\nDoes this make for an effective magazine? Let's dig in and find out:\n\nBeginnings…\n\nby Chesley Bonestell\n\n… And Call Me Conrad (Part 1 of 2), by Roger Zelazny\n\nHundreds of years from now, a war-ravaged, radiation-scoured Earth is little more than a colony of the blue-skinned Vegans who lease our planet out of historical curiosity. Humanity is much reduced, confined to the former backwaters of civilization.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we are introduced to Conrad Nomikos, head of the world's antiquities preservation bureau, who is tapped to escort a Vegan journalist as the alien gathers information for a travelogue of blasted Earth.\n\nBut there is far more to Conrad than he likes to let on. Something of a rogue, and possessed of pretenatural strength, skills, and psychic abilities, he is actually Konstantin Karaghiosis – mutated into a Methusaleh by radiation and erstwhile leader of a radical anti-Vegan colonial movement that had, decades before, spiked Vegan ambitions to take all of Earth.\n\nNow Conrad finds himself embroiled in multiple intertwined plots as the Vegan journalist becomes the target of an assassination attempt, his mission to Earth having a more significant goal than just a John Gunther volume. Conrad, too, is personally imperiled, though who wants him dead and why are open questions.\n\nThis first part of a serial leaves off just as the second attempt on Conrad's life (if such they were; he cannot be certain) has failed. It looks as if Conrad may well have to resume the revolutionary mantle of Konstantin to navigate the crisis.\n\nZelazny can sometimes be a tough pill for me to swallow. One of the Journey's regular readers observed that he's done more than any current SF writer to bring Hemingway to our genre, and I feel that Roger sometimes trades readability for that stylistic choice. That said, after a somewhat plodding beginning, the fleshed out background and advanced storyline becomes quite compelling.\n\nCall it three stars for now, but with potential for the ending (if and when it come) to raise things retrospectively.\n\nMirror, Mirror, by Avram Davidson\n\nMilquetoasty fan of A. Merritt spends his spare hours scouring local second-hand shops for jade mirrors with which to escape our reality into something more fantastical and swashbuckling. What he doesn't count on is someone from another reality with a similar passion finding their way to his world.\n\nAs a premise, it's a fantastic mirror to works like The Incomplete Enchanter. As a vignette, however, it suffers for an overlong beginning (relative to the length of the piece) and the lack of a real resolution. In this case, unfinished means unsatisfying.\n\nThree stars.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\n(here's a rather pointless doodle by Mr. Wilson, one that doesn't even pertain to our genre; the reason for its inclusion escapes me)\n\nThe Future, Its Promoters and False Prophets by E. Brandis and V. Dmitrevskiy, and\n\nReplies by Poul Anderson and Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury and Mack Reynolds\n\nHere's an interesting piece: a critique of American science fiction by two Soviets followed by replies by the authors specifically mentioned (including reference to Asimov's foreword to More Soviet Science Fiction). It makes for a fascinating debate, one that is clearly ongoing. I hope F&SF continues to cover it.\n\nFive stars.\n\nNo Jokes on Mars, by James Blish\n\nA journalist is sent to the Red Planet to check up on a colleague whose work has become perfunctory and cynical. While on a tour of the Martian wilderness, her escorts poach a pomander from the pouch of a native dune-cat; the aromatic ball is of high value on Earth as a perfumed ornament, but its heist dooms the Martian creatures (who prove to be sentient) to a slow death. Can she make it off Mars with the story?\n\nIt's a good story, but it suffers both for its 1950s depiction of Mars and the extremely sudden ending, which I ended up reading several times, wondering if I'd missed a paragraph or two somewhere. Here, the unfinished nature left me wanting rather than dreaming.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Glorious Fourth, by Jack Sharkey\n\nThree astronauts from Earth land on an Eden teeming with an ecology so vigorous that its creatures refuse to die. One of the crew, despairing of service under the martinet captain, goes native – literally. And while the process is pleasant for him, the interaction between the remaining two and the planet's life forms is ultimately less enjoyable.\n\nJack Sharkey's byline is one I'm normally wary of, but he delivers a decent story here, and the vague ending, only hinting at the horrors the two spacemen will face (and the reason for their unpleasantness), is effective.\n\nThree stars.\n\nMinutes of A Meeting At The Mitre, by Robert F. Young\n\nOld Nick meets Samuel Johnson. With a punchline telegraphed from the beginning, the only motivation for this piece seems to be Young's desire to do a Boswell pastiche.\n\nWell, the story may have finished, but it's clear that the hoary \"Deal with the Devil\" subgenre of fantasy is not.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Land of Mu, by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Good Doctor picks up where he left in his elementary physical particles, this time discussing the differences between electrons and mu mesons (muons). It's an absolutely fascinating piece, and it's very clear from its conclusion that there is still so very much we don't know about the universe's tiniest components.\n\nFive stars.\n\nSomething Else, by Robert J. Tilley\n\nA punctilious, nature-hating music professor crashlands on a deserted planet with only a clarinet and box of jazz music spools to keep him company. Well, not quite deserted: there is also a solitary shaggy alien with the ability to mimic music perfectly. Thus begins an interspecies friendship.\n\nPerhaps intentionally, the ultimate story in this collection does have a definite ending, which is sadly to its detriment. Rather than building to some kind of revelatory peak offering some sort of interesting insight on the human condition, there is, instead, a pointless downer of a conclusion, better suited to a lesser episode of The Twilight Zone. Tilley, the piece's author, is also about 20% more wordy than he needs to be.\n\nThree stars.\n\nEndings?\n\nI would say that this month's reliance on the unfinished story had mixed results. However, at the very least, I am now looking forward to the conclusion of the Zelazny piece; at most, I find my thoughts returning to the other uncertain endings, imagining the myriad outcomes that might have better resolved these otherwise unsettled lines.\n\nArt reflects reality indeed!\n\nOur next Journey Show: At the Movies, is going to be a blast!\n\nDON'T MISS IT!\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nThose of you who have been following the Journey over the past several years know that my appraisal of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction has changed a few times. Back in the days when Anthony Boucher and then Robert Mills were editing F&SF, it was my favorite magazine, a dessert I saved for reviewing last.\n\nThen Avram Davidson took over in 1962, and while there were still standout issues, Davidson's whimsical, somewhat obtuse preferences led to a pretty rough couple of years. Recently, Joe Ferman, son of the owner of the magazine, took over, and quality has been on a slow but perceptible rise.\n\nOne thing about F&SF is that it has always been unique amongst its SFF magazine brethren (which once numbered 40 and now less than ten). It was the literary sibling, the most highfalutin. Composed largely of vignettes and short stories, it contrasted sharply with the crunchier digests like Analog.\n\nWhich is why the current July 1965 issue is so unusual. It's not bad; indeed, it's pretty good. But it reads much like an issue of Galaxy or IF, one of the more mainstream mags. I'm not disappointed. It's just odd is all. Read on and see what I mean.\n\nby Jack Gaughan (he likes dragons — he did the illos for Vance's The Dragon Masters too!\n\nRogue Dragon, by Avram Davidson\n\nLast year, Davidson left editing to go back to writing full time, and Rogue Dragon is his first major work since his departure from the helm of F&SF. From the title, I expected a fantasy piece, or perhaps the dragon would even turn out to be metaphorical. Both suppositions were wrong: Rogue Dragon is pure science fiction set on a far future Earth, one that had been conquered and then abandoned by the merciless insectoid Kar-chee.\n\nNow simply called Prime World, humanity's original home has devolved to a handful of city-states. The planet's economy is based on Hunts, wherein the dragons introduced by the Kar-chee are slain by off-world big game hunters. These dragons are nigh invulnerable things, their chest armor only pierceable in a weak spot identified with a painted white cross.\n\nEnter Jan-Joras, the Private Man (representative) of the great off-world leader, Por Paulo. Sent to arrange a vacation for the elected king he serves, Jan-Joras quickly gets caught up in a political struggle between the aristocratic Gentlemen class, who raise the dragons, the base-born (known pejoratively as dogcatchers and potato-growers), and the outlaws, who have hatched a scheme that will strike at the very foundation of the Hunt system.\n\nBut Rogue Dragon is no political thriller. Rather, after a slightly difficult to read opening act (Davidson introduces many concepts and an abundance of idiomatic language in a short space), Rogue Dragon is an adventure story filled with derring-do, great escapes, and much traveling across increasingly hot frying pans — and we all know what destination lies at the end of that trail.\n\nI found that I liked the story quite a bit, although it is perhaps less substantial than it might have been. I waver between giving it three stars (perfectly adequate entertainment) and four stars (there's creative worldbuilding here).\n\nGenerosity wins. Four stars it is, and welcome back to where you belong, Avram.\n\nComputer Diagnosis, by Theodore L. Thomas\n\nFor his latest science fact vignette, Thomas discusses computer-assisted medical diagnosis — feed the data in, get a determination of malady and a life expectancy out. Expanded, this could have made a nice article. As is…\n\nThree stars for being harmless.\n\nThe Expendables, by Miriam Allen deFord\n\nIn this odd bird of a story, the first astronauts sent to Mars are senior citizens. The logic is that the mission is so hazardous, with so remote a chance of returning, that it is kinder to send folks with fewer years remaining in their lives.\n\nIt doesn't make a great deal of sense, and the story is hampered by some clunky \"as you know\" dialogue. On the other hand, I thought the characters were pretty well drawn, and I appreciated the non-standard protagonists (two men, two women, all over 68).\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Eight Billion, by Richard Wilson\n\nMany have made the dire prediction that Earth is heading toward massive overpopulation. Indeed, the tremendous-sounding number, \"Eight Billion\", may well be reached by the end of the century. Now imagine that crowding was such that eight thousand thousand thousands were crammed just into the island of Manhattan!\n\nWilson's story is mostly humorous fluff supporting a twist ending, but I enjoyed it.\n\nThree stars.\n\nBecalmed in Hell, by Larry Niven\n\nNiven continues to impress with his fourth tale, sequel to The Coldest Place, which appeared in IF. In his hard as nails variation on McCaffrey's The Ship who Sang, Howie and Eric-the-cyborg-ship explore the boiling planet of Venus. There, floating twenty miles above the molten surface, Eric develops a fault and is unable to blast back into orbit. Is the problem mechanical or psychosomatic?\n\nThis is the first story set on post-Mariner 2 Venus, and what a delight it is to see what is probably a much more accurate representation of the Planet of Love. I do balk at the notion that it would be pitch black under Venus' clouds — it's not under an equivalent pressure of ocean, after all. On the other hand, perhaps they were exploring the night side.\n\nIn any event, it's a neat story (albeit one I might have expected to find in Analog). Four stars.\n\nExclamation Point!, by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Good Doctor continues his streak of turning his frivolous meanderings through mathematics into readable but not particularly momentous articles. In this latest, he expounds on the \"Asimov series\", a cute way he has developed to approximate the value of the special constant, e.\n\nAn enjoyable ride, I suppose. Three stars.\n\nA Murkle For Jesse, by Gary Jennings\n\nGary Jennings last appeared in print in this very magazine, some three years ago, with the story Myrrha. It was nominated for the Hugo, though I didn't think it merited such acclaim.\n\nIn any event, I think I liked Murkle better. It stars an eight-year-old boy, a section of the rural Northeast, a little lost girl, and a 400-year old Irish fairy who is most certainly not lost.\n\nIf Clifford Simak and R.A. Lafferty were put in a blender, this piece might pour out. Three stars.\n\nThe Pterodactyl, by Philip José Farmer\n\nThe book concludes with a short poem about the wing-fingered flying reptiles of the Mesozoic. A difficult read, it also seems to suggest that pterodactyls were the evolutionary precursors of birds.\n\nThe weakest piece of the issue; two stars.\n\nWrapping up\n\nAnd there you have it: a pleasant, above-average issue, but with stories that seem slightly odd fits for F&SF. I'm not really complaining, though.\n\nUnless, of course, it means the other mags suffer…\n\n[Don't miss the next episode of The Journey Show, featuring singer-songwriter Harry Seldon. He'll be playing a mix of Dylan, Simon, and some unique original compositions!]\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nMissing Something\n\nScience fiction and fantasy are closely aligned genres. Indeed, there is no hard line between them (like the continuum from sharks to rays) and one person's \"soft\" science fiction is another's fantasy. Each of the monthly SFF mags has carved out its own turf in the spectrum between hardest SF and fluffiest fantasy.\n\nAnalog has chosen the firmest of grounds, its stories highly scientific; even the recent Lord D'Arcy tales are a kind of highly rigorous fantasy. Galaxy, IF, and Worlds of Tomorrow also hew solidly to \"reality\". The magazines that trip more fantastic tend to indicate such in their titles: Fantastic, Science Fantasy, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction.\n\nThe name of the last one belies the fact that precious little, if any, science fiction appears within its covers these days. It didn't used to be so; during the Mills era, Naked to the Stars, and many other definitive science fiction works appeared. But ever since Avram Davidson took over, and even though he has been gone two issues now, F&SF has been a horror/fantasy mag.\n\nAnd this is a problem. While SF is an ever-evolving genre, powered by new discoveries that unlock entire subgenres, fantasy is an unstructured, amorphous mass. And horror is (at least for now) a pile of cliches. Seen five Alfred Hitchcock Presents (the TV analog to F&SF) and you've seen them all. You may enjoy those five very much, but after a season of them, you're through with the genre.\n\nF&SF's all-starring January 1965 issue is chock full of stories that might have been passable, if lesser, tales back in 1949. These days, they are frustratingly inadequate, especially given the new 50 cent price tag.\n\nExibit F (for Fantasy/Failure)\n\nby Mel Hunter (depicting a landing on Neptune's moon, Triton — the closest this issue will get to SF)\n\nEnd of the Line, by Chad Oliver\n\nWe start with an \"after the Bomb\" piece, which I guess qualifies it as a low form of SF. However, its premise is sheer fantasy. In brief, it is centuries down the line, and civilized humanity has lost the ability to breed. The more comfortable we become, the lower our fertility, the sicklier are our children. Only the ignorant savages outside the last City remain fecund.\n\nOne City-dweller is a throwback, leading raiding parties into savage lands to kidnap children to be raised back at home. Whence come this spark of atavistic vigor? Of course, it turns out he's a kidnapped savage. And also that the primitives, themselves, are descendants of City-dwellers abandoned as children. Because all it takes to regain the spark of life is utter deprivation.\n\nIt's a dumb story, and women are portrayed as neurotic wives and would-be wet nurses.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nDimensional Analysis and Mr. Fortescue, by Eric St. Clair\n\nMargaret St. Clair (and as her alter ego, Idris Seabright) is one of the best known names in the genre. Her husband, Eric, is an up-and-comer. Unfortunately, his latest story, about a fellow who opens a funhouse but finds it was inadvertently equipped with an interdimensional rift, is a down-and-goer. Just too broadly written and inconsequential; the kind of frothy stuff Davidson dug. Meringue can be tasty, but you can't live on it.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nBegin at the Beginning, by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Good Doctor's article is on calendar year system. Entertainingly spun, and including a few tidbits I had not been hitherto aware of, it nevertheless is a history lesson rather than a scientific piece. That's okay, as far as it goes, but it's much easier to present a non-technical piece for a layman than to explain an abstruse topic.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Mysterious Milkman of Bishop Street, by Ward Moore\n\nTurn-of-the-Century fellow engages a new milkman who promises to deliver his goods right to the doorstep rather than let it freeze on the street. The product is superb, the service excellent — too excellent. When it starts mysteriously appearing inside the house, the fellow decides he's had too much of a good thing and abandons his residence.\n\nI liked that this story turns the \"if it seems too good to be true\" cliche on its head (there's never anything untoward about the milk; in fact, during the term of the milkman's engagement, life had been significantly better for the drinker). However, it ends abruptly and with insufficient development. It needed another sting for its tail.\n\nThree stars.\n\nFamous First Words, by Harry Harrison\n\nBrilliant scientist devises a contraption to record the genesis of great inventions. It's really just an excuse for a brace of ha-ha vignettes, which aren't very funny.\n\nA disappointment, both given the author and the promising title (which is now useless).\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Biolaser, by Theodore L. Thomas\n\nThe Science Springboard is back, this time positing a time when laser scalpels are so thin, they can splice DNA like reel-to-reel tape. Maybe it's possible?\n\nThree stars, I guess.\n\nThose Who Can, Do, by Bob Kurosaka\n\nAn impudent college student interrupts his teacher's math lecture with a demonstration of magic. The teacher responds in kind.\n\nNo really, that's it.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nWogglebeast, by Edgar Pangborn\n\nMolly, a middle-aged woman with an inherited fancy for magical (if mythical) creatures, befriends a Wogglebeast when it emerges from a pot of chicken soup. She keeps the odd animal, which is never really described until the end, as kind of a pet, kind of a good luck charm. Fortune does seem to follow, and she even, at the age of 41, manages to become pregnant. The story, however, has a sad ending.\n\nA sentimental and well-written tale, it doesn't have much more than emotion going for it. And I'm getting tired of women portrayed solely as mothers or wanting to be mothers.\n\nThree stars.\n\nLove Letter from Mars, by John Ciardi\n\nGood meter on this poem, but after reading it five times, I've still no idea what the author is trying to communicate.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe House the Blakeneys Built, by Avram Davidson\n\nUgh. Davidson.\n\nAlright. I won't leave it at that. The Blakeneys are the descendants of a four-person crew stranded on a (entirely Earthlike, of course) planet hundreds of years ago. Severe inbreeding has dulled their intelligence and bred in odd superstitions. When a fresh foursome of shipwreckees arive, the results are not happy ones.\n\nAnother vaguely promising tale that comes to an unsurprising, uninspiring end.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nFour Ghosts in Hamlet, by Fritz Leiber\n\nFinally, we have the longest piece of the mag, about the goings on in a Shakespeare company which culminate in a seemingly spectral conclusion during the Ghost's appearance in Hamlet.\n\nLeiber, of course, recounts from experience, being a prominent actor, himself. But unlike the excellent No Great Magic, there is not a hint of fantasy or science fiction in this F&SF story. And while I appreciated the 30 page, (deliberately) gossipy and meandering behind-the-scenes look at life in an acting company, that's not why I subscribed to this mag.\n\nThree stars.\n\nBack to Reality\n\nWhat a disappointment that was! If new editor Ferman can't find anyone to write proper SF, or even imaginative F for F&SF, he might as well change the magazine's masthead. As is, it's false advertising.\n\nOh well. There are plenty of interesting magazines and books next to it on this month's newsstand…\n\n[Holiday season is upon us, and Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1958-1963), on the other hand, contains some of the best science fiction of the Silver Age — many from F&SF's prouder days. And it makes a great present! A gift to friends, yourself…and to the Journey!]\n\n[Have you gotten your copy of Rediscovery: Science Fiction by Women (1958-1963)? It's got some of the best science fiction of the Silver Age, many of the stories first appearing in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction!)\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nThe Good Fight\n\n1964 has been a year of struggle. The struggle to integrate our nation, the struggle against disorder in the cities, titanic power struggles in the U.S., the U.K. and now the U.S.S.R. The struggle to hold on to South Vietnam, to preserve Congo as a whole nation. The struggle of folk, rock, Motown, country, and surf against the inexorable British invasion.\n\nSo it's no wonder that this month's Fantasy and Science Fiction makes struggle the central component of so many of its stories. This magazine is wont to have \"All Star Issues\" — this one is an \"All Theme Issue\":\n\nby Ed Emshwiller\n\nThe Issues at Hand\n\nGreenplace, by Tom Purdom\n\nPurdom, who just wrote the excellent I want the Stars (review coming in the next Galactoscope), depicts a 21st Century in which immortality has created a stranglehold on politics. Canny machine bosses can hold on to power indefinitely. Nicholson is a man who would break this power, loading himself up on psychically enhancing drugs and personally investigating \"Greenplace\", a stronghold neighborhood of the 8th Congressional District. There, he encounters resistance, violence, and a secret…\n\nRemarkable for its melange of interesting ideas and surreal execution, it's a little too consciously weird for true effectiveness. Three stars.\n\nAfter Everything, What? by Dick Moore\n\nTwo thousand years ago, genetic supermen ruled the galaxy. They weren't dictators; rather, they were created by humans to be the best that humanity could be (that's what the story says — I'm not endorsing eugenics). After a century of dominance, they all died out.\n\nIt's a well-written piece, but the conclusion is obvious from the beginning: the ubermenschen struggled against boredom…and lost.\n\nThree stars.\n\nTreat, by Walter H. Kerr\n\nIt used to be that, on Halloween, people would wear scary masks so that when they encountered bonafide spooks on their day of free reign, they would be mistaken for compatriots. Nowadays, the shoe is on the other foot — spooks can only freely walk the Earth on Oct. 31 since everyone mistakes their frightening faces for masks.\n\nCute? Three stars.\n\nBreakthrough, by Jack Sharkey\n\nHere, the struggle is Man vs. Machine. A chess-playing computer betrays its sentience by developing a sense of humor. So its creator, tormented with feelings of inferiority, shoots the machine dead.\n\nSharkey can be good. More often he can be bad. Here, Sharkey is about as bad as he ever gets.\n\nOne star.\n\nDark Conception, by Louis J. A. Adams\n\nWhen the Savior comes again, will it be in the form of another virgin birth? And what happens when the new Mary happens to be Black?\n\nThis is the first piece of the issue that has some of the old F&SF power, but the ending doesn't pack a lot of punch since the conclusion is telegraphed, and the author doesn't do much with it.\n\nThree stars for this missed opportunity of a tale.\n\nOne Man's Dream, by Sydney Van Scyoc\n\nAgainst age, all mortals struggle in vain. A Mr. Rybik has himself \"tanked\" in life-sustaining fluids in the hopes of purchasing a few more years. But not for himself — he wants to preserve the other personality who lives in his head, the pulp adventurer called Anderson. This Anderson is more real to him than even his wife or his kids, entertaining, sustaining, allowing Rybik to enjoy a life of vicarious excitement.\n\nBut when Rybik's money runs out, he finds that no one in the real world wants to pony up dough to save a crazy dreamer who neglected his family. Can Anderson save him now?\n\nWell crafted, it engages while it lasts, and then sort of fades away. Like Anderson.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe New Encyclopaedist – III, by Stephen Becker\n\nAnother of these faux articles written for an encyclopaedia, copyright 2100 A.D. This one details a latter day crusade against immorality by a McCarthy parody. Mostly a bore, though there is one genuinely funny line.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nWhere Do You Live, Queen Esther? by Avram Davidson\n\nEsther is a Creole house-servant. Her struggle is with her employer, Eleanor Raidy, who treats her poorly. In typically overwritten fashion, the author details Esther's revenge. Only Avram can make seven pages feel like 20.\n\nI understand Davidson is quitting the editorship of F&SF to devote more time to his writing. If this is the kind of stuff we can look forward to, he might consider an altogether different career. And it's a reprint, no less!\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Black of Night, by Isaac Asimov\n\nDr. A's article for the month details the struggle to answer Olbers' paradox: if the universe be infinite, and stars evenly distributed, why isn't the night sky as bright as the day's?\n\nAs one might guess, the issue is with the postulates. Neither are correct, as we now know. Asimov does his usual fine job explaining things for the layman.\n\nFour stars.\n\nOn the House, by R. C. FitzPatrick\n\nIn the earlier story, Dark Conception, the husband of the pregnant Mary confronts Mary's doctor. Both husband and doctor are Black, but the husband considers the doctor a \"Tom\" and won't be satisfied with mere equality:\n\n\"I don' want what you want, man. I want what they got and for them to be like me now. I want to lead me a lynch mob and hang someone who looks at one of our girls. I want to rend me some of my land to one of them and let them get one payment behind. I want them to try to send they kids to our school. I want 'em to give me back myself like I was before, when I didn't hurt so bad that I better off dead.\"\n\nFitzpatrick's On the House is a deal with the Devil story, but the protagonist is a Black woman, and all she wants is to change places with \"one of them\".\n\nIt's another piece that would do a lot better with development beyond the punchline, but I at least appreciate the variation on the theme.\n\nThree stars.\n\nPortrait of the Artist, by Harry Harrison\n\nIf there is going to be one struggle that defines the modern age, it's the struggle to reconcile automation with personal dignity. Harrison, in this piece, shows the mental devastation that happens when even such an imagination-laden field as comic artistry can be done by a machine.\n\nIt was pretty good up to the end where (if you'll pardon the unintentional pun, given how the story ends), Harrison fails to stick the landing.\n\nThree stars.\n\nHag, by Russell F. Letson, Jr.\n\nIs a witch's pox effective against modern vaccination?\n\nAnother pleasant (if forgettable) prose poem.\n\nThree stars.\n\nOversight, by Richard Olin\n\nWacky doctor wins his struggle against aging by infusing his cells with planaria (flatworm) DNA. It has unintended consequences.\n\nAnother story with an obvious ending — and this one doesn't make biological sense.\n\nOlin's last (and first) story was better. Two stars.\n\nThe Third Coordinate, by Adam Smith\n\nWe end with the struggle to reach the stars. The concept is novel: humanity has invented a teleporter, but while direction can be controlled, distance cannot. What its operators need is three known destinations, coordinates that can be used to calibrate the device so that accurate ranging can be done.\n\nGreat idea. Very poor execution. Nothing happens for the first 20 pages but some of the clunkiest exposition and character development I've read in a while. And there's no tension in the end, either. Pilot succeeds, end of story.\n\nTwo stars, and a hope that the theme gets picked up by someone with more chops.\n\nSumming Up\n\nAs it turns out, the biggest struggle this month was finishing the damned magazine. Conflict is vital to any story, but it's only one component. Execution and development matter, too. Even Davidson's story intros have lapsed into badness. I'm looking forward to the editor's departure from F&SF; any change has to be an improvement, right?\n\n[Come join us at Portal 55, Galactic Journey's real-time lounge! Talk about your favorite SFF, chat with the Traveler and co., relax, sit a spell…]\n\nby Victoria Silverwolf\n\nIn the Wrong Place at the Wrong Time\n\nI belonged in Idle Valley like a pearl onion on a banana split.\n\nRaymond Chandler, The Long Goodbye\n\nWe've probably all felt out of place from time to time, like the philosophical private eye Philip Marlowe quoted above. I'll bet that the Rolling Stones, a British musical group newly introduced on this side of the pond, felt that way when they made a very brief appearance on the American television variety show The Hollywood Palace this month. Their energetic version of the old Muddy Waters blues song I Just Want to Make Love to You lasted barely over one minute. The sarcastic remarks made about them by host Dean Martin took up at least as much time.\n\nHere are the shaggy-haired troubadours at a happier moment, shortly after their arrival in the USA.\n\nIn Tears Amid the Alien Corn\n\nSimilarly, the latest issue of Worlds of Tomorrow is full of characters who aren't where they belong, along with a couple of authors who might feel more at home elsewhere.\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nI trust that the shade of John Keats will forgive me for stealing a few words from his famous poem Ode to a Nightingale, because they movingly evoke the emotions of those far from where they feel at home. The stories we're about to discuss may not have many tears, but they've got plenty of aliens, as well as, unfortunately, quite a bit of corn.\n\nValentine's Planet, by Avram Davidson\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nBetter known, I believe, as the current editor of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, a fact that does not endear him to all readers, Davidson may seem a bit out of place as the author of a long novella of adventure in deep space. Be that as it may, his story takes up half the issue, so it deserves a close look.\n\nWe start with mutiny aboard a starship. The rebels kill one of the officers in a particularly brutal way, sending the others, along with a few loyal crewmembers, off to parts unknown in a lifeboat. They wind up on an Earth-like planet, inhabited by very human aliens. (There's one small hint, late in the story, that the natives came from the same ancestors as Earthlings.) The big difference is that the men are very small, no bigger than young boys. The women are of normal size, so they serve as rulers and warriors. (There's a male King who is, in theory, the source of all power, but he's little more than a religious figurehead, living in isolation from the world of war and politics.)\n\nThe survivors of the mutiny get involved with local conflicts, while they try to find a source of fuel so they can make their way home in the lifeboat. Things get complicated when the insane mutineer in command of the starship lands on the planet, intending to plunder it. After a lot of hugger-mugger, and a dramatic final confrontation with the rebels, the Hero gets the Girl, achieves a position of power, and is well on his way to reshaping the local matriarchy into something more to his liking.\n\nAs you can tell, I was not entirely comfortable with the implication that replacing a woman-dominated society with a male-dominated one is a laudable goal. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt, and assume he was aiming at nothing more than escapist entertainment. On that level, it's a pretty typical example. The feeling of the story changes from space opera to science fantasy halfway through, and the transition is a little disorienting. Davidson avoids most of the literary quirks found in many of his works, although he indulges in a little wordplay now and then. (I lost count of how many times he told us that the armor of the Amazon warriors was black, scarlet, black and scarlet, scarlet and black, black on scarlet, scarlet on black, etc. He also gives names to a large number of the political factions on the planet, apparently just to amuse himself.)\n\nTwo stars.\n\nWhat Weapons Tomorrow?, by Joseph Wesley\n\nA nonfiction article, among a bunch of tales of wild imagination, may seem, as the old song goes, like a lonely little petunia in an onion patch. In any case, this is a rather dry piece, imagining what the tools of war might look like in 1980. The author describes satellites that could rain destruction from above, and energy beam weapons that could defend against them. He then explains why neither of these methods is practical. It's informative, if not exciting.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Little Black Box, by Philip K. Dick\n\nby George Schelling\n\nThis strange, complex story begins with a woman who is definitely not where she belongs. She's an expert on Zen Buddhism, sent to Cuba in an attempt to distract the Chinese Communists living there from their political philosophy. This quickly proves to be a deception, as she's really there so a telepath can read her mind and track down a religious leader. It seems that the woman's lover, a jazz harpist so popular that he has his own TV show, is a follower of the enigmatic mystic Wilbur Mercer.\n\nMercer is a mystery. He broadcasts an image of himself walking through a desert wasteland on television. His devotees use devices that allow them to experience his sensations, primarily his suffering as he approaches his death. Both sides of the Cold War consider him a danger. There is speculation that he may not even be human, but some sort of extraterrestrial. The United States government declares the empathy machines illegal, driving the Mercerites underground. The story ends in what seems to be a miraculous way.\n\nLike most stories from this author, this peculiar tale contains a lot of a characters, themes, and subplots. Sometimes these work together as a whole, sometimes they don't. It certainly held my interest throughout, even if I didn't fully understand what Dick was driving at. Your enjoyment of it may depend on your willingness to accept that some things have no rational explanation.\n\nThree stars.\n\nWe from Arcturus, by Christopher Anvil\n\nEverything about this story makes it seem as if it fell out of the pages of Astounding/Analog and landed in a place where it doesn't belong. That's no big surprise, since Anvil has been a regular in Campbell's magazine for quite a while. You also won't be startled to learn that it's a comedy about hapless aliens who fail to invade Earth. The author can write that kind of thing in his sleep by now, so he pulls it off in an efficient manner.\n\nA pair of shapeshifting scouts from another planet suffer various misadventures as they try to prepare the way for their leaders to conquer the world. Five such teams have already disappeared, so the new duo is cynical about the chance of success. (Like in many of these stories, even when it's human beings making the attempts, you have to wonder why they don't just give up.) One big problem is that the aliens get all their ideas about Earthlings from television. Eventually, they find out why the other scouts vanished, and the story ends with a mildly amusing punchline.\n\nIt's refreshing to have a comic science fiction story that doesn't degrade into crude slapstick, and Anvil has a light touch that can provide a few smiles. It's a pleasant enough thing to read, even if it will fade from your memory as soon as you finish it.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Colony That Failed, by Jack Sharkey\n\nby Jack Gaughan\n\nHere we have not just one person in the wrong spot, but a whole community. Colonists disappear, one by one, from an agricultural settlement on a distant world. Norcriss, a fellow we've seen before in the so-called Contact series, arrives to take care of the problem. As in previous stories, he uses a device that allows him to enter the mind of other beings. One problem is that, in this case, he doesn't know what mind to enter. Adding a touch of what seems to be the supernatural is the fact that the coffin of a dead woman burst open, her body went missing, and other colonists heard her voice after she died.\n\nThe author provides a scientific solution to the mystery that is interesting, if not extremely plausible. The story accomplishes what it sets out to do, without anything notable about it. At least Sharkey wasn't trying to be funny.\n\nThree stars.\n\nDay of the Egg, by Allen Kim Lang\n\nby Nodel\n\nTalk about being in the wrong place! This story was supposed to be in the April issue, but because of some kind of goof it's only showing up now. I can't say that its disappearance was a bad thing.\n\nThis is a silly farce, set in a solar system where stereotyped British folks rule one planet, stereotyped Germans rule another, and bird people rule another. The protagonist, Admiral Sir Nigel Mountchessington-Jackson (are you laughing yet?), competes with his nemesis, Generalfeldmarschall Graf Gerhard von Eingeweide (still not laughing?), to sign a treaty with the birds. The egg containing the new monarch of the avian planet hatches, and the baby chick thinks the German is her mother. The Englishman comes up with a scheme to turn the tables on his opponent.\n\nI found the whole thing much too ridiculous for my taste. The way in which the British guy wins the day was predictable, and the jokes fall flat. The author makes Anvil look like the master of sophisticated wit.\n\nOne star.\n\nNot Fitting In\n\nReading this issue made me feel like I should have been somewhere else, doing something else. The stories range from poor to fair, with only Philip K. Dick rising above mediocrity. Even his unique story fails to be fully satisfying, and seems to have been shoved into a place where it doesn't quite belong. As science fiction fans in the mundane world, I'm sure we can all identify with that situation.\n\nThis newly published book provides a fit metaphor, but don't bother reading it. It's all about the pseudoscience of matching people to their proper careers through physiognomy.\n\nNevertheless, we're also a hardy breed, and we know that even when times are rough, something good is right around the corner. Like this month's Fantastic…\n\n[Come join us at Portal 55, Galactic Journey's real-time lounge!
