        "text": "FOOL’S PARADISE\n\nDave Achelis ©2013\n\nIn the still of the night, Ace stole into town,\n\nHis health was failing, his fortunes were down.\n\nThe hungry dogman was hot on his trail,\n\nThe bounty was big, Ace had just skipped bail\n\nChorus\n\nAt night when he’s not sleeping, he tries to catch his breath.\n\nHe thinks of all he once had…now there’s nothing left,\n\nNothing except to die a young man’s death\n\nA story so old the pages turn into dust\n\nOne dream of fortune, one dream of lust.\n\nTo look back on your life, and see all you’ve done…\n\nNothing but waiting for the end to come.\n\nChorus\n\nHis blood is racing like his heart’s in a vice\n\nBut he still keep searching for that Fool’s Paradise\n\nOne more payday then he’ll pack it all in\n\nHe’s played by his own rules for the wages of sin…\n\nChorus\n\nThe Great Unknown\n\n©Roger Murdock& Rusty Seeger\n\nThe Ties that bind, your lips unwind\n\nThe hurt that stay while the hours grind\n\nI must be stupid that my excuse\n\nFor falling facedown in love with you\n\nYou throw my red bathrobe on,\n\nYou’re out the door\n\nWhere you goin’?\n\nYou’re walking to the great unknown\n\nWhat’s underneath is overgrown\n\nYou think your rolling back the stones but really,\n\nThey don’t move at all\n\nI wanted fun\n\nShould have just played dumb\n\nStarted acting smart and\n\nI lost my heart\n\nYou said” hey babe, we can work it out”\n\nThen you left me here top twist and shout\n\nYou’ve got places you must go\n\nAnd so and so And so and so\n\nYou’re walking to the great unknown\n\nWhat’s underneath is overgrown\n\nYou think your rolling back the stones but really,\n\nThey don’t move at all\n\nCHASING SHADOWS\n\nBy Dave Achelis\n\n©2013\n\nJonnie served his country in Afghanistan\n\nNow he’s home from his tour\n\nBut his service cost him dearly and he’s hurting quite bad\n\nSeems we don’t have a cure\n\nIt’s like chasing shadows,\n\nA cry from the deep\n\nThe rain falls so slowly,\n\nClose your eyes go to sleep\n\nJoannie works at night in the emergency room\n\n10 or 12 hours a day\n\nBut when she finally gets home to her husband and kids,\n\nShe’s got nothing to say\n\nIt’s like chasing shadows,\n\nA cry from the deep\n\nThe rain falls so slowly,\n\nClose your eyes go to sleep\n\nEddie got a Harley on the 4th of July\n\nTook it out for a whirl\n\nThat wall couldn’t stop him but his wife’s gonna try\n\nIt’s the end of the world\n\nIt’s like chasing shadows,\n\nA cry from the deep\n\nThe rain falls so slowly,\n\nClose your eyes go to sleep\n\nIt’s like chasing shadows,\n\nA cry from the deep\n\nThe rain falls so slowly,\n\nClose your eyes go to sleep\n\nMOVIE STAR\n\nDave Achelis ©2013\n\nI’m gonna show you something you’ve never seen\n\nI’m gonna show you what the Dreamers dream.\n\nIt’s 95 acres, a big, big estate\n\nIf there’s something you want, you won’t have to wait\n\nSome fine new clothes, a shiny new car\n\nThe money flows\n\nWhen you’re a Movie Star!\n\nWear out that mirror going over your lines\n\nCan’t watch the children ‘cause you don’t have the time.\n\nYou know that stand in, he looks nothing like me,\n\nI assumed that all this champagne was supposed to be free\n\nStrike a pose…look how fine you are\n\nThe money grows\n\nWhen you’re a Movie Star!\n\nThis chateau only has a four car garage,\n\nThis RV is too small for my entourage\n\nThat script you gave me is really sub-par,\n\nDon’t forget you’re dealing with a big Movie Star!\n\nSome fine new clothes, and a shiny new car\n\nThe money flows when you’re a Movie Star!\n\nDON’T LOOK BACK\n\nDave Achelis © 2013\n\nMy Cadillac was motivating over the hill\n\nI got my 8 track on playin’ Cheap Thrills\n\nGot a fresh pack of Luckies sitting on my dash\n\nLevi pocket’s with a whole weeks cash\n\nGas is cheap, life’s cheaper, still,\n\nIt’s easier to split than to pay those bills\n\nYou old folks just don’t understand…\n\nI way to young to give a damn!\n\nEvery stranger is a brand new lover\n\nIt’s either that, or “duck and cover”\n\nLife’s way to short for those who care,\n\nBut there’s people like us everywhere\n\nThere’s a simple answer a simple plan,\n\nGrab your partner and dance while you can\n\nYou old folks just don’t understand…\n\nI way to young to give a damn!\n\nThose that can’t, they have to teach\n\nYour neighbor’s dreams seem out of reach\n\nYou try to live like you’ve been told,\n\nBut no one ever plans on growing old\n\nBreak that mirror and don’t look back\n\nJust drive that engine right off the track\n\nYou old folks just don’t understand…\n\nI way to young to give a damn!\n\nCountdown\n\nDave Achelis © 2013\n\nJust another day…the temperature was rising,\n\nThere was bad news on the radio\n\nOver in the middle lane was a crazy driver\n\nHe pushed me off the road he had a lot of nerve\n\nCountdown, countdown who can you trust?\n\nCountdown, countdown, turn into dust\n\nDriving through the summer haze\n\nBurning like a house on fire\n\nThis heat has made me mad,\n\nI’ve got to getaway\n\nMy throat was raw and dry\n\nI stopped off at a roadside tavern\n\nThere she sat alone\n\nI tried to catch her eye\n\nCountdown\n\nLooking at her broken watch\n\nShe turned to me and asked the time\n\nI told her that I didn’t know and that I didn’t care.\n\nLying in a pool of light the bartender just mumbled,\n\n“ Just another night”\n\nWe made our getaway….\n\nCountdown\n\nTV Casualty\n\n© By Glenn Danzig\n\nThere are paint smears on everything I own\n\nThe Vapo Rub lies on a table of filth\n\nChristmas cards to which I never reply\n\nMy eyeballs absorb only blue filtered light\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nIt’s alright\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nI wish they’d put prince Namor on the tube,\n\nHold on, I think I have to puke\n\nThere’s a spot in the corner where I always go\n\nI like to feed the flies that I know\n\nBut please don’t feed my television screen\n\nBut please don’t feed my television screen\n\nBut please don’t feed my television screen\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nIt’s alright\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nBabies in prison, they call it a womb\n\nNine months sentence, no parole\n\nSlivers of steal stuck in your lungs,\n\nBreath deep, we need a donor for blood\n\nJaguars at the cemetery\n\nCadillac grazing at your grave\n\nSonys grazing at your grave Zeniths grazing at your grave\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nIt’s alright\n\nTV casualty TV casualty\n\nCeremony\n\nBy Dave Achelis 2013\n\nYou’ve got to lock down your windows\n\nPull down your shade\n\nHear that cold wind howling\n\nYou’re right to be afraid\n\nThe sky keeps getting darker\n\nIt fades from grey to black\n\nAnd if you’ve made it this far\n\nYou can never go back\n\nIt’s a ritual you live by\n\nA ceremony of hate\n\nAnd whatever your plans are\n\nThere’s no changing your fate\n\nThe sky keeps getting darker\n\nIt fades from grey to black\n\nAnd if you’ve made it this far\n\nYou can never go back\n\nWhen the moments over\n\nAnd the dust has cleared\n\nYou’ll just be starting over\n\nIt’s everything you feared\n\nThe sky keeps getting darker\n\nIt fades from grey to black\n\nAnd if you’ve made it this far\n\nYou can never go back\n\nNoonday Sun\n\nDave Achelis© 2013\n\nWhy is there something Instead of nothing,\n\nWhy do I think the little that I do\n\nThere’ got to be something\n\nI can believe in There’s got to be something I know is true\n\nDid I sleepwalk through life Or dream it instead?\n\nAnd if I’m not dreaming, it’s just like I’m dead..\n\nIs life really this simple or really this hard\n\nIt’s like betting against the house\n\nWhen you can’t see the cards\n\nIt’s so hot\n\nIn this noonday sun.\n\nIt almost over\n\nBut I’ve barely begun\n\nThe whole worlds alive But to be self aware…\n\nWhere does that come from\n\nAnd why do I care\n\nIf you ask the right questions\n\nit will soon ease your doubt\n\nOr you can sleep through the ages\n\nWhile the sun burns out\n\nIt’s so hot\n\nIn this noonday sun.\n\nIt almost over\n\nBut I’ve barely begun\n\nTime flows like a river\n\nIt’s relative they say\n\nAnd as I keep getting older\n\nA month seems like a day\n\nPut away your cell phone\n\nTurn off your TV\n\nUnplug your IPod\n\nLet your mind roam free\n\nThe Same Song\n\nDave Achelis©2017\n\nI was trying to write this song but I couldn’t think of\n\nNothing to say\n\nThat didn’t sound worn out, used, lifted, just another cliché\n\nAin’t it funny how emotions sometime get you carried away\n\nIt’s the same song, the same words, the same old way\n\nNow when you left me you hurt me, but I won’t say\n\nIt cuts like a knife\n\nAnd though I really love you, you won’t ever be my wife!\n\nYou know I love you honey, I didn’t sleep at all last night\n\nIt’s the same song, the same words, the same old way\n\nI’m looking at the TV, but I only have eyes for you,\n\nJust yesterday my Mama told me\n\n“Breakin’ up is hard to do!”\n\nI still love you baby, But what’s a poor boy to do?\n\nIt’s the same song, the same words, the same old way"
