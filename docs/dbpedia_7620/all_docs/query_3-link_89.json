        "text": "by David Levinson\n\nJoining the mainstream\n\nEvery Sunday, the New York Times publishes a list of the best selling books of the last week. It tends to be a mix of high-brow, literary novels and potboilers—especially spy thrillers—along with the occasional gothic romance and a mystery once in a blue moon. But to the best of my knowledge, it’s never had a science fiction novel prior to this year. As of the latest list, it has not one but two, both of which have been reviewed here at the Journey. There’s even a third that could be said to have sfnal elements if you stand on your head and squint a bit.\n\nIn its tenth week on the list and slipping one spot to number six is Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five. Of course, Vonnegut is none too happy about his work being labelled science fiction. Meanwhile, Michael Crichton’s The Andromeda Strain hit the list for the first time in eighth place. The potential third novel is Vladimir Nabokov’s Ada, or Ardor, which seems to be set on an Earth exactly like ours with a slightly different history or on a counter-Earth on the other side of the sun. Other than that, there doesn’t seem to be much science fiction in the plot, so I’m not really inclined to include it.\n\nDoes this mean our beloved genre has finally hit the big time? Probably not. As I said, Vonnegut doesn’t want to associate with us, and I wouldn’t be surprised if Crichton thinks of his book as a thriller. (I could be wrong, but that’s how it’s being marketed.) 2001 did all right at the box office, but was panned by critics (including some SF critics). Star Trek has been canceled, leaving Land of the Giants—a show so bad it makes Lost in Space look smart—the closest thing to SF on television. But just maybe the boundaries are weakening, even if we wind up having to sneak in the back door with those who won’t acknowledge us.\n\nSophomore or sophomoric?\n\nThe second issue of Mercury Publishing’s second attempt at Venture SF is on the stands. How is it? Well, before we crack it open, let’s look at the outside.\n\nMore geometric shapes and color washes. Art by Bert Tanner\n\nIf the last issue could be mistaken for a horror magazine, this one could easily be taken for a mystery. That’s probably the eye. Dell used to use an eye looking through a keyhole as the logo for their mysteries (and maybe still do; it’s been a while since I bought one), and this is very reminiscent of that. The best thing about the outside of the magazine continues to be the title logo.\n\nThe League of Grey-eyed Women, by Julius Fast\n\nDiagnosed with terminal cancer, a desperate Jack Freeman will grasp at any straw. A Canadian doctor has had some small success injecting rats with artificial DNA, but his studies are nowhere close to being ready for human experimentation, no matter how much Jack begs. His beautiful, pale-eyed assistant, however, is willing to bend the rules, since she and the many women with gray eyes she knows have their own agenda. The treatment may cure Jack’s cancer, but it may kill him in other ways. It will certainly change his life.\n\nThis confused mess makes sense if you’ve read the book. Art by Bert Tanner\n\nIf the name Julius Fast sounds familiar, you may have read one of his well-received mysteries or one of his non-fiction books such as the one on Human Sexual Response by Masters and Johnson or last year’s book about the Beatles. (That or you’re thinking of Howard Fast, who wrote Spartacus, among many other things.) He’s not a complete stranger to SF, so he doesn’t make a lot of the mistakes that many mainstream authors do when trying to write our stuff.\n\nThat said, there are parts that don’t hold up if you think about them too hard. Some of those may be better propped up by things that were cut from this condensed version; others make no sense at all. Still, the narrative pulls the reader along, even despite Jack being a fairly unpleasant person early on. There’s enough here to make it worth reading, but you might want to see if your local library has a copy rather than spending your own money.\n\nA solid three stars. The complete novel may come in a little higher, but probably not enough for another star.\n\nWith Ah! Bright Wings, by Edward Wellan\n\nPollution seems to be in the news more every day. In the last two weeks alone, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio caught fire (and not for the first time) and a pesticide spill in the Rhine caused a state of emergency in West Germany and the Netherlands. What if there’s more behind it than just industrialization and a lack of concern by the government and the companies producing most of the pollution? It’s an old theme in SF, but Wellan has come up with a moderately new twist. Unfortunately, the telling is as dry and dusty as the two UN bureaucrats who are the story’s protagonists.\n\nA high two stars.\n\nBradbury on Screen: A Saga Perseverance, by F.E. Edwards\n\nIt’s no secret that Ray Bradbury loves the movies. He’s written a few, and several of his stories have been adapted for the big screen, but many more have never made it into or out of production. Those that do have not served the source material well. This article follows the career of Bradbury and his work in Hollywood. Interesting but inconsequential.\n\nThree stars.\n\nDragon in the Land, by Dean R, Koontz\n\nOver the years, the focus of the military has shifted to biological warfare. A virus escaped from a Chinese lab and is so devastating it brought down the Communist government. The American doctor heading the Analysis and Immunization team that is part of the military intervention in the country must struggle with his own sense of inadequacy, which stems from growing up in the shadow of his Nobel laureate father.\n\nPlumbing the depths of the bombed-out lab. Art uncredited\n\nImagine if The Andromeda Strain had ended badly and someone had to enter the ruins of the lab to find the original team’s notes; that’s the action of this story in a nutshell. I don’t think Koontz has cribbed from Crichton. The timing of the two stories makes that nearly impossible, but it implies that both men have done their homework.\n\nI keep saying that Koontz is getting close to breaking through. This might be it. It’s certainly the best thing he’s written so far. If he can maintain this level of depth and quality, he’s going to be a big name.\n\nFour stars.\n\nProject Amnion, by Larry Eisenberg\n\nA story in the style of a magazine article on efforts to teach children in the womb, it ignores countless aspects of human physiological development, not just in the brain, but the whole body. Eisenberg has apparently never met a baby. The nicest thing I can say bout this one is that at least it’s not an Emmett Duckworth story.\n\nA low two stars.\n\nPithecanthropus Astralis, by Robert F. Young\n\nA caveman questions the wisdom of the elders and breaks the rules. While this piece lacks the saccharine romantic elements that have often led me to complain about Young (who has been largely silent in the last few years), it also lacks the positive elements that his past stories have had.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nSumming up\n\nElsewhere in the issue, there’s a weak Feghoot and a word scramble to see how well you know your -ologies. The condensed novel is decent, and there’s one other good story, but the rest is trivial to terrible. The cover is bad and not designed to sell the magazine, and there still isn’t much in the way of promotion over in F&SF. If things don’t turn around soon, this incarnation of Venture isn’t even going to last as long as the 10 issues of the first go-round. Let’s hope things improve in the fall.\n\n[Today is the last day you can sign up at the reduced rate for next year's Worldcon. Don't miss your chance to vote in next year's Hugos!]\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nScience Fact\n\nIn '57, Asimov stopped being a full-time science fiction writer to become a full-time science columnist, a change in vocation that has largely been a positive one. Why did the creator of Nightfall, Foundation, and Susan Calvin make the leap? Because, with the launch of Sputnik, science fiction had suddenly become reality, and the front page of the newspaper contained some of the most thrilling SF headlines going.\n\nThat trend has only accelerated. This month, we entered the next stage of space travel, not with a flashy Gemini launch (though those are nifty!) or our first manned trip to the Moon, but with something called ATS.\n\nNASA's \"Advanced Technology Satellite\" went up on December 7, 1966. Some satellites, like TIROS, are weather satellites. Some, like SYNCOM, relay communications. ATS is the first to do both, and from geostationary orbit. At its altitude of 36,000 km, it takes exactly 24 hours to circle the Earth. Thus, from the ground, it appears to be standing still. Equipped with a \"spin-scan\" camera, every 20 minutes, ATS sends back a full-globe image of the Earth with a resolution of just 3km. For the first time, we have essentially real-time weather coverage of an entire hemisphere.\n\nNo less ambitious, but sadly less successful, was last week's three-day \"Biosatellite\" mission. Biosat is the first in a series of spacecraft that will observe the long term effects of orbital life on a variety of organisms. On board are a menagerie of bugs (including the ever popular fruit flies) as well as seeds and plants. The plan was to launch the mission on the 14th and then bring it back on the 17th, observing the effects of weightlessness and radiation on the living cargo. A retrorocket malfunction stranded the satellite in orbit, however. I suspect the SPCA is filing a lawsuit as we speak…\n\nNASA isn't the only American agency conducting science. Last week, the Air Force launched two satellites at once in its low-cost \"Orbiting Vehicle\" series, OV1-9 and OV1-10. Normally, these go into polar orbits, but the latest duo follow more conventional paths. For the most part, these little guys investigate radiation, radio propagation, and other near-Earth conditions. This is all of great interest to an organization that wants to put flyboys in a Manned Orbiting Laboratory next year, but there's also a valuable scientific yield for the rest of us.\n\nScience Fiction (and Fantasy)\n\nAfter all that exciting real-world news, could an SF magazine hope to provide the same thrills? Turns out the first 1967 issue of Fantasy and Science Fiction does!\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nThe Little People (Part 1 of 3), John Christopher\n\nBridget Chauncey is the heir to a most unusual estate in rural Ireland: a run-down country home built on the site of a ruined castle. Enchanted with the place and its commercial opportunities, she essays a trial season running the place as a vacation lodge. An odd assemblage of characters are introduced: a bickering middle-aged couple and their daughter on the edge of womanhood, a ruddy Wehrmacht veteran and his half-Jewish wife, Bridget's practical fianceé, Daniel, the estate handler's son, Mat, and the cook and maid.\n\nThe Little People is slow to start, author Christopher allowing us to settle into the heads of each member of this queer group. But when a two-inch sandaled footprint is discovered, and linked to the recent rash of minor thefts, the identity of the culprit(s) quickly is determined.\n\nFairies are real.\n\nThis is where we leave off this compelling chapter. I look forward to the ramifications of \"first contact\" between giant and wee folk. Four stars.\n\nThe Star Driver, J. W. Schutz\n\nLess impressive is this tale of a man stranded on an asteroid with rapidly diminishing air reserves. Rescue depends on propelling a beacon to orbital velocity. This Analog-ish tale would have been better served had the ending not been spoiled from the start by editor Ferman (and to some degree, the title).\n\nOn the other hand, I don't want to discourage F&SF from publishing, well, SF. So, a low three stars.\n\nInterplanetary Dust, Theodore L. Thomas\n\nThomas suggests that the flux of micrometeoroids around the Earth might be netted up and squashed into a planetoid to live on. I don't think he's researched how thin that flux actually is.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Disenchanted Symphony, James G. Huneker\n\nHere's a reprint from the turn of the century! A Russian composer, infatuated with the link between music and mathematics, creates a symphony that punches a hole through the fourth dimension, whisking his wife and his orchestra away from our plane of existence. Can he get them back?\n\nI was impressed with how modern this story felt. Judith Merril expressed in her Books column this month that SF owes much of its present sparkle to works created more than fifty years ago. She was talking about H.G. Wells. This sentiment could easily be said of Mssr. Huneker as well.\n\nFour stars.\n\nBait, Bob Leman\n\nSometimes what a door-to-door salesman is peddling isn't the product he has on display. This is a deliciously subtle tale that gets better after a night's thought on it.\n\nFour stars.\n\nThe Knight-Errant, the Dragon, and the Maiden, Gahan Wilson\n\nSometimes the dragon is a chaperone, not a jailer.\n\nCute. Three stars.\n\nRight Beneath Your Feet, by Isaac Asimov\n\nWe're back to lists and geographical tidbits from The Good Doctor this month, this time describing what places lie directly opposite others on the globe. Well, at least I learned the etymology of the word \"antipodes\" (still don't know how to pronounce it, though…)\n\nThree stars.\n\nKingdom Come, Inc., Robert F. Young\n\nLast up, a Christmas story. Robert F. Young has never found a myth he hasn't wanted to shoehorn into a science fictional story. This time, he adapts a reliable well: Christianity. On the Seventh Heaven pleasure satellite, an angelic fellow named Mike shows up looking for a job. He and his six brothers (Gabe the trumpter, Raf, etc.) are out of work of late since no one has gotten into their particular establishment for many years.\n\nIt's an obvious tale and a tedious one, opting for the easiest, least challenging conclusion. Two stars.\n\nBack to Earth\n\nWith the exception of the final tale (accepted more for its fortuitous length and timely theme, perhaps), this is a quite good issue. And with the unusual inclusion of a serial, there's all the more reason to look forward to the February issue when it arrives early next month.\n\nHappy New Year, indeed!\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\n[Today is the last day you can sign up at the reduced rate for next year's Worldcon. Don't miss your chance to vote in next year's Hugos!]\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nBlitzkrieg\n\nSometimes war is a crackling thing, a coiled spring of conflict that sees an enemy pouncing on and through a hapless foe. Such a campaign marked the German invasion of France through the \"impassable\" Ardennes forest in May 1940; a similar campaign occurred in December 1944 by the same combatants at the same spot.\n\nThey say, \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" and indeed the Americans and British soldiers in France should have known better than to pooh pooh the idea of a Wehrmacht onslaught at exactly the same location they'd used four years prior. Nevertheless, it happened, the Nazis made a big indentation in the Allied lines, and so \"The Battle of the Bulge\" forever got its name.\n\nThere's little surprise that Avalon Hill has made a game out of the battle. It's a fight with a lot of appeal (odious ideologies aside): As the Germans, there's the hope that enough momentum will push the tide of your forces to the coast, splitting the Allies irrevocably. As the Allies, there's the desperate holding action while you wait for reinforcements to gird the lines and throw back the Hun horde.\n\nThis year, a new war epic debuted on the 21st anniversary of the start of the battle simply called The Battle of the Bulge. Of course, we drove up to Los Angeles on the new interstate to see it. Verdict: not bad, though it's always a little disorienting to see American tanks play the role of German panzers.\n\nTo truly mark the occasion, we also started another game of Battle of the Bulge, this time switching sides. We're playing it out day by day, exactly matching the turns of the game to the days they represented. This time-shifted experience is actually a lot of fun. I wonder if I can find other opportunities to do it…\n\nSitzkrieg\n\nIf The Battle of the Bulge represents the essence of the blitzkrieg, this month's Fantasy and Science Fiction is a recreation of World War 1 — overlong, with little movement, ultimately pointless. Such a sad contrast to last month's issue, which was the best in years. Ah, such are the vicissitudes of war. Come slog along with me, would you?\n\nby Jack Gaughan\n\nL'Arc De Jeanne, by Robert F. Young\n\nWe start with the story illustrated on the front cover, sort of a cross between Young's science fiction-tinged fables and actual SF. The rapacious O'Riordan the Reorganizer, a would-be tyrant of the Terran Empire, invades the world of Ciel Bleu only to be thwarted by a young virgin with a bow and arrow named Jeanne. Her arrows, by the way, create torrential thunderstorms.\n\nRather than continue a hopeless fight, O'Riordan retreats his forces, instead dispatching a handsome young fellow to seduce and capture the Maiden of New New Orleans before she can fully rally the planet's defenses.\n\nLike most Young stories, it is a bit rambling and sentimental, but it avoids the over-saccharine nature of his worst works (while missing the sublime levels of his best). It also takes a while to get going, but I enjoyed it well enough by the end.\n\nThree stars.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\nBeaulieu, by Margaret St. Clair\n\nA young man on the edge of a losing battle with a fatal disease is picked up by an enigmatic woman. Will she be able to drive him down the wind in the road that leads to an alternate universe where things have gone right instead of tragically wrong?\n\nA nice psychological piece. Three stars.\n\nBooks, by Judith Merril\n\nI don't usually review the reviews, but Merril's column is especially good this month, describing fandom and publishing in the United Kingdom, as well as devoting inches to Aldiss and Ballard. Worth a read (Mark Yon, are you reading?)\n\nTo the Rescue, by Ron Goulart\n\nSpace private dick wrestles with his sentient car companion, which is suffering a progressive nervous breakdown. Is the detective just unlucky? Or is his dissatisfaction with his chosen profession unlocking his psychic abilities?\n\nPerhaps better suited to Analog, it's the kind of frivolous story I had to keep revisiting to remember just what had happened.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Most Wonderful News, by Len Guttridge\n\nA Welshman with a hospital-bound wife is desperate for news, any news, which he can relate to her on this week's visit. When all the usual sources dry up, he is left with one tidbit that is certifiably out of this world.\n\nThis story just goes on and on, and you won't be at all surprised by the ending. Two stars.\n\nSmog, by Theodore L. Thomas\n\nAfter a nice summary of what smog is, Thomas suggests using additives to combat automotive emissions rather than filters or oxidizers. I'm not sure how this makes any sense; oxidizers are additives. Moreover, I'm not sure one could make an emission less harmful than the carbon dioxide and water a catalytic converter produces (in the short term — in the long term, of course, we could see an accelerated global greenhouse effect).\n\nSo two stars, and learn some chemistry, Ted.\n\nSurvey of the Third Planet, by Keith Roberts\n\nGreedy aliens arrive on Earth to add it to their collection of worlds only to be repulsed by the doughty primitives. The gimmick to the story is the revelation of who the primitives actually are.\n\nShrug. We saw this trick in Garrett's Despoiler of the Golden Empire, and I didn't like it much there, either.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Proton-Reckoner, by Isaac Asimov\n\nHere's a fun article about how big Archimedes thought the universe was, how big the universe actually is, and why the proton is the smallest meaningful unit of volume.\n\nThere is also a brief plug for the Steady State model of the universe, which is unfortunate given that, between the article's writing and its publication, the Big Bang model has garnered overwhelming favor.\n\nFour stars.\n\nRepresentative From Earth, by Gregory Benford\n\nA Jovian skydiver from Earth is scooped up by aliens and given a series of tasks to complete to prove his worthiness. All of them have some element of physical prowess and intellectual cunning involved. In the end, we find out just whom he's trying to impress.\n\nIt is a story at once too overwrought and too sketchy to please, all of it in service to an off color joke.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nApology to Inky, by Robert M. Green, Jr.\n\nHaunted by an incident from his past he can only vaguely remember, but which tore apart his one true love, experimental musician Walton Ulster finds himself living in several times at once: 1930, 1944, and 1965. At the intersection of these three eras is a double-murder and, perhaps, true love.\n\nAt half the length, and in more capable hands, this interminable novelette could have been something special. As is, it wavers between interest and boredom, settling in for the latter by the end.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nCasualties of War\n\nI suppose after last month's all-star issue, it was a matter of course that the follow up would be dismal. Part of the issue is the abundance of new/newish writers (Green, Benford, Guttridge). Ah well. I'm inclined to take the long view.\n\nAfter all — one battle does not a war make!\n\nThe holidays are coming! Looking for the perfect gift for a niece, nephew, or other young relative? Kitra is the hopeful, found family novel that they've been waiting for. Buy a copy for them today…and perhaps one for yourself!\n\nby David Levinson\n\nAmericans have an odd relationship with revolution. They’re quite proud of their own, but extremely leery of anyone else’s. But revolution seems to be the natural order of things in the 20th century. Not all of them have been violent, nor have all of them been political. And no doubt we will see many more – political, scientific, economic, social and even sexual – before the decade, let alone the century is out.\n\nRevolution turned upside-down\n\nSince the end of the War, the major colonial powers of the 19th century have been gradually handing over control of their colonies to the native people. It hasn’t always been voluntary, nor has it always been smooth. But the British seem to be doing better than the others at handing over power. Most transitions have gone smoothly, though not perfectly. Until now.\n\nNegotiations have been ongoing with Rhodesia since last year. The sticking point has been an improvement in the status of Black Rhodesians and an end to racial discrimination, insisted on by the United Kingdom. The white Rhodesian government led by Prime Minister Ian Smith is vigorously opposed the idea of equality for Blacks.\n\nTalks broke down on October 8th over the issue of majority rule. With rumors circulating that Rhodesia will declare independence, the U. N. General Assembly voted 107-2 to call on the United Kingdom to use military force to prevent such an event. Ten days later, the Organization of African Unity passed a similar declaration. British Prime Minister Harold Wilson has gone to Rhodesia to continue negotiations, apparently without success. On the 30th, Wilson gave a press conference before returning home in which he stated that a unilateral declaration of independence would be treason, but that the United Kingdom would rely on trade sanctions and ruled out the use of military force against “kith and kin”. A peaceful resolution does not seem to be at hand.\n\nHarold Wilson (l.) and Ian Smith (r.)\n\nRevolutions start to finish\n\nAmericans may not like the idea of revolution in the real world, but as part of their national mythology it turns up frequently in fiction. This month’s IF is filled with revolution, both political and otherwise.\n\nThere’s no clue what this odd revolutionary slogan means. Fred Pohl promises an answer next month. Art by Morrow\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress (Part 1 of 5), by Robert A. Heinlein\n\nIn 2075, the Moon has been a penal colony for nearly a century. A prison without walls or guards, because there’s nowhere to run, and after just a few months, permanent physiological changes caused by the low gravity mean no one can go back to Earth. That means that many people living there are free men and women descended from former prisoners, but still subject to the Lunar Authority.\n\nOne such is Manuel Garcia O’Kelly-Davis. Mannie, who lost his left arm in a mining accident and has several interesting prosthetics, is a computer repairman. One of his jobs is maintaining the Lunar Authority’s central computer, a High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluation Supervisor, Mark IV – a HOLMES FOUR. Somewhere along the way, so many different modules were added to the computer it gained consciousness. Only Mannie has noticed and dubbed this new “person” Mycroft, Mike for short, after Sherlock Holmes’s smarter brother. Mike is quite the joker, with a fondness for practical jokes and puns, but he’s lonely, since everyone else is too stupid to have figured out that he’s alive.\n\nAt Mike’s request, Mannie attends a political meeting where he is introduced to Wyoming Knott, a rabble-rouser from Hong Kong Luna, and runs into his old teacher, Professor Bernardo de la Paz. After Wyoh (as she prefers to be called) gives a stirring speech encouraging revolution against the Authority and the Prof agrees with her goals but pokes holes in her methods, the meeting is broken up by the Warden’s goons and turns deadly.\n\nMannie helps Wyoh escape and, while they’re hiding out, introduces her to Mike, who eventually creates a feminine personality called Michelle to talk to Wyoh. The next day, they meet with the Prof and have a discussion about revolution. Mannie and Wyoh exchange a knowing look when the Prof points out the importance of communications; that’s one of Mike’s bailiwicks. After the Prof expounds on the idea of revolutionary cells, Mannie suggests a few improvements and suddenly finds himself nominated to head the revolution. To be continued.\n\nMannie wearing his Number Three arm. Art by Morrow\n\nAll but the most rabid Heinlein fans will agree that his last few novels have been uneven at best. But this is Heinlein at his best. We have the standard Heinlein characters here: Mannie, the competent man who mostly goes along to get along until pushed to do more by circumstance; Wyoh, the strong, beautiful, brilliant woman who does the pushing (though not a love interest so far); and the Prof, the older man who loves teaching and the sound of his own voice. Mike is a bit different. He obviously has a role to play, but we need to see more.\n\nNot much really happens in these 50 pages, but Heinlein keeps you reading, even through long discussions of Lunar marriage customs and revolutionary organization. And once again, Heinlein has slipped a minority protagonist into his work. Mannie is not only Latin as his name suggests, but he probably counts as Black, with a grandfather deported from South Africa. When he first sees her, Mannie notes that pale, blonde Wyoh is clearly first generation since the genes tend to get all mixed up pretty quickly, so most of the people we meet are probably of mixed race.\n\nFour stars and I’m eager to see more.\n\nSecurity Syndrome, by Gerald Pearce\n\nProfessor James Brown has arrived at the regional headquarters of the Society to report someone as politically unreliable: himself. Despite his double-A rating, he feels that his sensitive position and his exposure to older texts full of “unescoism” have rendered him unfit. To say more would give the whole story away.\n\nThe United States has clearly undergone a revolution prior to the time of this story. The unnamed Society merely advises the government on the political reliability of citizens, and we hear of a second Bill of Rights, which includes a guarantee of “freedom from seditious, false and heretical doctrines”. It also seems that Brown’s actions are going to trigger another revolution.\n\nThis is a good story, though not without problems. I had some difficulty keeping the various Society members straight, and the story sagged in places. Still, a solid three stars.\n\nToys for Debbie, by David A. Kyle\n\nSix-year-old Debbie Curtis likes to play with toys for both girls and boys, but she does have a tendency to break them. Insurance salesman Mr. Black has offered her father some excellent terms and occasionally drops by with a present for Debbie. What could be the harm?\n\nI often complain that an author has attempted a “Twilight Zone ending”, an ironic twist that hasn’t really been set up. Long-time fan David Kyle (who most recently appeared in these pages as an artist) has written what would be an excellent episode of The Twilight Zone. It’s easy to imagine Rod Serling popping up at the end to offer a terse epilogue. Every moment is earned, and it ends not with a twist, but a shudder. Three stars.\n\nSt. George and the Dragonmotive, by Robert F. Young\n\nLieutenant George St. George of the International Pastpolice has gone to sixth century England to investigate an anachronism. There he meets a few knights, including one from Camelot, hunting for a dragon which has devoured a fair maiden and several peasants, who miraculously remain “on live”. The dragon proves to be a train, resembling the Stourbridge Lion, driven by a young woman he dubs Cassiana Jones. Train-lover George must work his way into her favor to track down the source of this industrial revolution.\n\nAn unusual comic style for Gray Morrow, but the best thing about this story. Art by Morrow\n\nTypically for Young, the protagonist is an addlepated twerp. Worse, though he falls in love with the engineer, it’s clear he’s more in love with the idea of driving a train. Worse than that, she doesn’t get a name in her own right until the very end. It’s also far too long for such a thin story. Two stars.\n\nThe Girls on USSF 193, by Stephen Goldin\n\nAstronauts are coming back from their tours of duty in space with weakened hearts, because they won’t do the cardiac exercises prescribed by the National Space Agency. Director Jess Hawkins came up with a plan that is dubious to say the least, morally questionable and probably illegal.\n\nYou sometimes hear the phrase “sexual revolution” about changing attitudes towards sex. In the past it’s sometimes meant being open about what people are doing anyway, and sometimes it’s about real changes in sexual attitudes. This story dabbles in the latter, but is highly implausible. It hinges on a career bureaucrat making a move that puts his job on the line, a job he knows others are gunning for.\n\nGoldin is this month’s first time author. The writing here is decent, despite the implausible plot, but the attitudes towards women are deeply questionable. Two stars.\n\nLONCON II or Through a Monocle? Darkly, by Robert Bloch\n\nBloch’s report on this year’s Worldcon was allegedly written on a hotel typewriter between the end of the con and his departure for home. I believe it. This rambling nonsense reads like it was written by a man short of sleep with his brain in a different time zone. You’ll learn much more about the con from our colleague Kris Vyas-Myall’s report. One star.\n\nMercury, by J. M. McFadden\n\nMercury is an alien predator with an unusual hunting style. She is captured by an expedition and brought to an Earth zoo. There will be consequences.\n\nThe story is quite obvious and depends on some rather stupid behavior, but it’s short and not a bad read despite all that. This is McFadden’s second sale, and I’m not averse to seeing more from him. Three stars.\n\nRetief’s War (Part 3 of 3), by Keith Laumer\n\nRetief continues his search for Fifi. Unable to find his army, he joins forces with the remaining Terries and prepares for a last stand against the Voion hordes. Rescue arrives at the last minute in the form of the Federated Quoppina army led by Fifi, who is none other than Retief’s cousin Princess Fianna Glorian Deliciosa Hermione Arianne de Retief et du Lille. A typical Retief plan is put together to save the rest of the CDT mission, knock Ikk and his Voions out of power, quash Groaci schemes and get Retief mostly out of trouble.\n\nTief-Tief rides to the rescue. Art by Gaughan\n\nWhat a disappointing ending. A number of things happen that make little or no sense, but happen to move plot forward. Back in the first part, I noted that there was more room for things to develop, but Laumer seems to have run out of room anyway and it all rushes to a slam-bang ending. Two stars for this part and a very low three for the novel as a whole.\n\nSumming up\n\nThere’s lots of revolution in these pages, political, industrial and sexual. But there’s nothing revolutionary. IF is by no means mired in the past like Analog and the outward forms often acknowledge the changes happening to the genre, but the bones are still those of a decade ago or more. IF is still worth reading, and Fred Pohl has never struck me as averse to change, but he really needs to pick one of his three magazines to at least experiment with bringing them into the 1960s and beyond.\n\nNothing here looks terribly new either.\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nLeaving things hanging\n\nThere's something compelling about things left incomplete – from Schubert's Unfinished Symphony to President Kennedy's first term. In the gaps of what could have been, we can fill in countless possibilities rather than just the one.\n\nThis month's Fantasy and Science Fiction (like this month's Galaxy, an \"All-Star\" anniverary issue) trades almost exclusively in incompletes, its pieces ending in ellipses dots rather than hard stops.\n\nDoes this make for an effective magazine? Let's dig in and find out:\n\nBeginnings…\n\nby Chesley Bonestell\n\n… And Call Me Conrad (Part 1 of 2), by Roger Zelazny\n\nHundreds of years from now, a war-ravaged, radiation-scoured Earth is little more than a colony of the blue-skinned Vegans who lease our planet out of historical curiosity. Humanity is much reduced, confined to the former backwaters of civilization.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we are introduced to Conrad Nomikos, head of the world's antiquities preservation bureau, who is tapped to escort a Vegan journalist as the alien gathers information for a travelogue of blasted Earth.\n\nBut there is far more to Conrad than he likes to let on. Something of a rogue, and possessed of pretenatural strength, skills, and psychic abilities, he is actually Konstantin Karaghiosis – mutated into a Methusaleh by radiation and erstwhile leader of a radical anti-Vegan colonial movement that had, decades before, spiked Vegan ambitions to take all of Earth.\n\nNow Conrad finds himself embroiled in multiple intertwined plots as the Vegan journalist becomes the target of an assassination attempt, his mission to Earth having a more significant goal than just a John Gunther volume. Conrad, too, is personally imperiled, though who wants him dead and why are open questions.\n\nThis first part of a serial leaves off just as the second attempt on Conrad's life (if such they were; he cannot be certain) has failed. It looks as if Conrad may well have to resume the revolutionary mantle of Konstantin to navigate the crisis.\n\nZelazny can sometimes be a tough pill for me to swallow. One of the Journey's regular readers observed that he's done more than any current SF writer to bring Hemingway to our genre, and I feel that Roger sometimes trades readability for that stylistic choice. That said, after a somewhat plodding beginning, the fleshed out background and advanced storyline becomes quite compelling.\n\nCall it three stars for now, but with potential for the ending (if and when it come) to raise things retrospectively.\n\nMirror, Mirror, by Avram Davidson\n\nMilquetoasty fan of A. Merritt spends his spare hours scouring local second-hand shops for jade mirrors with which to escape our reality into something more fantastical and swashbuckling. What he doesn't count on is someone from another reality with a similar passion finding their way to his world.\n\nAs a premise, it's a fantastic mirror to works like The Incomplete Enchanter. As a vignette, however, it suffers for an overlong beginning (relative to the length of the piece) and the lack of a real resolution. In this case, unfinished means unsatisfying.\n\nThree stars.\n\nby Gahan Wilson\n\n(here's a rather pointless doodle by Mr. Wilson, one that doesn't even pertain to our genre; the reason for its inclusion escapes me)\n\nThe Future, Its Promoters and False Prophets by E. Brandis and V. Dmitrevskiy, and\n\nReplies by Poul Anderson and Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury and Mack Reynolds\n\nHere's an interesting piece: a critique of American science fiction by two Soviets followed by replies by the authors specifically mentioned (including reference to Asimov's foreword to More Soviet Science Fiction). It makes for a fascinating debate, one that is clearly ongoing. I hope F&SF continues to cover it.\n\nFive stars.\n\nNo Jokes on Mars, by James Blish\n\nA journalist is sent to the Red Planet to check up on a colleague whose work has become perfunctory and cynical. While on a tour of the Martian wilderness, her escorts poach a pomander from the pouch of a native dune-cat; the aromatic ball is of high value on Earth as a perfumed ornament, but its heist dooms the Martian creatures (who prove to be sentient) to a slow death. Can she make it off Mars with the story?\n\nIt's a good story, but it suffers both for its 1950s depiction of Mars and the extremely sudden ending, which I ended up reading several times, wondering if I'd missed a paragraph or two somewhere. Here, the unfinished nature left me wanting rather than dreaming.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Glorious Fourth, by Jack Sharkey\n\nThree astronauts from Earth land on an Eden teeming with an ecology so vigorous that its creatures refuse to die. One of the crew, despairing of service under the martinet captain, goes native – literally. And while the process is pleasant for him, the interaction between the remaining two and the planet's life forms is ultimately less enjoyable.\n\nJack Sharkey's byline is one I'm normally wary of, but he delivers a decent story here, and the vague ending, only hinting at the horrors the two spacemen will face (and the reason for their unpleasantness), is effective.\n\nThree stars.\n\nMinutes of A Meeting At The Mitre, by Robert F. Young\n\nOld Nick meets Samuel Johnson. With a punchline telegraphed from the beginning, the only motivation for this piece seems to be Young's desire to do a Boswell pastiche.\n\nWell, the story may have finished, but it's clear that the hoary \"Deal with the Devil\" subgenre of fantasy is not.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Land of Mu, by Isaac Asimov\n\nThe Good Doctor picks up where he left in his elementary physical particles, this time discussing the differences between electrons and mu mesons (muons). It's an absolutely fascinating piece, and it's very clear from its conclusion that there is still so very much we don't know about the universe's tiniest components.\n\nFive stars.\n\nSomething Else, by Robert J. Tilley\n\nA punctilious, nature-hating music professor crashlands on a deserted planet with only a clarinet and box of jazz music spools to keep him company. Well, not quite deserted: there is also a solitary shaggy alien with the ability to mimic music perfectly. Thus begins an interspecies friendship.\n\nPerhaps intentionally, the ultimate story in this collection does have a definite ending, which is sadly to its detriment. Rather than building to some kind of revelatory peak offering some sort of interesting insight on the human condition, there is, instead, a pointless downer of a conclusion, better suited to a lesser episode of The Twilight Zone. Tilley, the piece's author, is also about 20% more wordy than he needs to be.\n\nThree stars.\n\nEndings?\n\nI would say that this month's reliance on the unfinished story had mixed results. However, at the very least, I am now looking forward to the conclusion of the Zelazny piece; at most, I find my thoughts returning to the other uncertain endings, imagining the myriad outcomes that might have better resolved these otherwise unsettled lines.\n\nArt reflects reality indeed!\n\nOur next Journey Show: At the Movies, is going to be a blast!\n\nDON'T MISS IT!\n\nby David Levinson\n\nWar is something of a constant in human history, with nearly every generation facing at least one. Fifty years ago, the great powers of Europe – with a late assist from the United States – fought the “war to end war” (a phrase probably coined by H. G. Wells). Twenty years later, we got to do it all again. And ever since, brushfire wars have flared up around the globe almost continually. War permeates our language and culture even in times of peace. In his State of the Union address last year, President Johnson referred to his Great Society program as a “war on poverty”. It even shows up in our entertainment: war movies are popular; there must be half a dozen TV shows in the new fall line-up set during the War or with military themes (more if you count spy shows); and one of the current best selling novels is a barely fictional account of the U. S. Army’s special forces, The Green Berets. Sometimes it’s enough to make you believe we really are on the Eve of Destruction.\n\nThe rawness of the recording makes it that much more powerful\n\nThe War in Viet Nam\n\nOn August 5th, America got a rather shocking look at the war in Viet Nam. CBS reporter Morley Safer accompanied a Marine unit to the village of Cam Ne, where they came under sporadic fire from the Viet Cong. Communist forces soon withdrew as the Marines advanced. As they entered the village, the Americans found a number of entrenchments and a few booby traps. Their orders were to destroy any village from which they received fire, so the villagers were herded into the nearby fields, and the Marines set fire to the homes with flamethrowers and cigarette lighters. Despite the villagers’ pleas to be allowed to remove their personal belongings, everything, including all the rice stores, was destroyed. Four old men who couldn’t understand the soldiers’ English were arrested. The public is understandably outraged. Alas, most of the ire seems to be directed at CBS and Mr. Safer. President Johnson is also said to be livid.\n\nA Marine uses his lighter to set fire to a peasant hut\n\nWar at the foot of the Roof of the World\n\nOn August 5th, several thousand Pakistani soldiers crossed into Indian-controlled Kashmir disguised as civilian locals. The belief was that the local Muslim population would rise up and welcome their coreligionists. Instead they reported the intruders to the Indian authorities. Ten days later, the Indian army crossed the ceasefire line. Thus far, both sides have made progress. As this is written, India has captured the Haji Pir pass, roughly 5 miles inside Pakistani territory, though there are also reports of a massive push by Pakistani forces. Hopefully, another ceasefire can be brought into effect and a long-term peaceful solution can be found.\n\nIndian forces in the Haji Pir pass\n\nWar across time and space\n\nWar is also a prominent feature of this month’s IF. As one war ends, another begins, along with a couple more and a very uneasy peace negotiation.\n\nThere are three living being depicted here. Art by Gaughan\n\nRetief’s War (Part 1 of 3), by Keith Laumer\n\nThe natives of the planet Quopp are part insect, part machine and come in a variety of forms, each making up their own tribe. There has also been a sizable human presence for a century or so, to the point that there are human farmers and traders who have lived their whole lives on the planet. Now the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne has decided it is time for a native government to be established and, in the person of Ambassador Longspoon, has chosen the Voions to form the government and the Federal police force. Unfortunately, all the other tribes on the planet see the Voions as bandits and thugs.\n\nAs usual, Second Secretary and Consul Jame Retief has learned several of the local dialects and made friends with many of the common folk. There follow a number of adventures. He discovers crates of weapons labeled as educational material, which he manages to divert. Despite severe restrictions on tourism, a shipload of young women is requesting emergency permission to land. Their captain, by the name of Fifi, seems to know Retief, but he has no idea who she is. Defying orders, Retief grants them permission to land, but the ship crashes out in the jungle. Then there’s an attack on the embassy using smoke bombs which appear to be of Groaci manufacture.\n\nPrime Minister Ikk has Retief arrested, hoping to find out where his guns are. He declares he is executing a coup, after which Retief makes his escape. Retief manages to disguise himself as a native with some help, and steals a barely flight worthy spaceship. He crashes in the jungle and is captured by some Ween, who call him Meat-fall-from-sky. As the situation goes from bad to worse, some more Ween drag in a Voion, loudly pointing out that he is a member of the Planetary Police. To be continued.\n\nMeet the bad guys. While other Quoppians like colors, the Voions prefer basic black. Art by Gaughan\n\nI’ve noted over the last few months that Retief is getting stale, as if Laumer is just going through the motions. This time around, he’s writing with more verve. It feels like Laumer is enjoying himself again. Maybe it’s because there’s more room. Retief pulls off at least three escapades here that would normally have had to resolve the whole situation in a shorter piece. So even though we’re getting all the usual story beats, there’s more flavor to it all.\n\nThat said, I’m hoping for a bit more depth as the story progresses. Laumer has set things up for some solid satire on colonialism as well as the sort of Cold War proxy conflicts that are really just colonialism in different clothing. The colonial powers frequently set one tribe over all the others, and it was often the least liked tribe, even before they wound up in charge, just as the CDT has done here with the Voions. We’ll have to wait and see if Laumer makes use of the situation he’s created. Three stars for now.\n\nA Leader for Yesteryear, by Mack Reynolds\n\nWhen his time capsule materializes above deep water, Lucius Rostock is barely able to escape it before it sinks. He is rescued by some very surprised fishermen and brought to shore. The local people take him in, and Lucius discovers that he is neither where nor when he expected to be. Rather than the future, he is in the distant past. Gradually, he learns the language and finds out where fate has brought him, though he is rather taken aback at how unwarlike the people are.\n\nTo say more would give the whole story away. I figured out where and when Lucius found himself quite a while before he did, though I suspect Reynolds expected the reader to do that. I also figured out who the text implies Lucius will become, although that is never spelled out. What I didn’t see coming was who Lucius is. The end really caught me by surprise. I do have a couple of quibbles with this otherwise very good story. There’s an odd gap in the languages that Lucius knows, which would have allowed him to communicate much sooner (but not without some difficulty, nevertheless). Also, the final paragraphs – even though the reveal did catch me by surprise – are a bit stilted and clumsy. Still, a solid three stars.\n\nThe Smiling Future, by Miriam Allen deFord\n\nIn an overpopulated world where nearly everyone works at producing enough food to keep the human race alive, an intelligent dolphin appears on the California coast and summons the world government to a summit meeting. Five hundred years of dumping radioactive waste into the oceans has resulted in highly intelligent, technologically advanced dolphins. In need of more room, they are planning to flood the world, but one faction has an offer to help preserve the human race.\n\nWhat bleak, bleak story. It’s made worse by the plodding narrative style, too. Mrs. deFord has been in the writing business for well over 40 years, and up until recently her work has been generally very good. She does spend most of her time writing mysteries, even winning an Edgar a few years ago, and I admit I don’t read all that much in the genre, so perhaps her level of quality there has held steady. But her work in science fiction and fantasy has really fallen off in quality. Two stars.\n\nOrigin of Species, by Robert F. Young\n\nAlan Farrell has traveled to the Upper Paleolithic in search of an anthropology professor and his secretary, who have gone missing. Exiting his own mammothmobile (regular readers may remember a similar concept with dinosaurs in Young’s “When Time Was New”), he finds first the professor’s “paleethnologivehicle” and then the professor’s body, apparently killed by Neanderthals. Farrell presses on, searching for the secretary, Miss Larkin, on whom he is developing a crush based solely on her picture and very wholesome résumé.\n\nEventually, he discovers a cave guarded by a force field, some Neanderthals who shoot blue sparks out of their mouths, and Miss Larkin. As the two make their escape, Farrell is shocked to learn first that the Neanderthals are bringing in what appear to be Cro-Magnon people as prisoners through some sort of portal, and second that Miss Larkin is not the wholesome girl she seemed to be, but rather an ecdysiast attempting to better her lot in life. Will the pair be able to stop aliens from using Earth as a prison? Will Farrell learn that exotic dancers can be nice girls, too? It’s Young. What do you think?\n\nHonestly, this picture tells you everything you need to know about this story. Those gorillas are supposed to be Neanderthals. Art by Morrow\n\nThe good news is that Young hasn’t written another modern take on a myth or fairy tale, nor has he written one of his overly sentimental romances. The bad news is that he attempted to write a sex farce (I think). Without the sex. Farrell is a dope, who took forever to figure out the mystery of the spark-shooting Neanderthals, and a hypocrite. He developed his low opinion of strippers by… visiting strip clubs. Two stars.\n\nPurpose, by Edward V. Dong\n\nAll life on Earth has been destroyed by an interstellar nucleonic storm. All that is left is the Machine. It was created to save the human race, but failed. In the last moments, technician John Michelson reprogrammed the Machine to be a monument to Man and to wait for new life to appear in the solar system. Eventually, the Machine is freed of its programming and seeks fulfillment.\n\nDong is this month’s first time author, and I suspect this story was written for F&SF’s Univac/unicorn contest. I’m not terribly impressed. It really felt like I’d read this before. Indeed for most of its three pages I was expecting something along the lines of Asimov’s “The Last Question”. That’s not quite where the author went with his story, but he didn’t get where he was trying to go either. Two stars.\n\nAn Ounce of Emotion, by Gordon R. Dickson\n\nTyrone Ross and Arthur Mial are the Earth delegation on their way to attempt to broker a peace between the Laburti and Chedal using a computer known as a statistical analysis instrument, or Annie. Earth is in Laburti space and, if war breaks out, could be devastated. Unfortunately, the two men hate each other with an inexplicable passion and have from the moment they met. Ross, the viewpoint character, is the technician who can run Annie, while Mial is a diplomat and ostensibly in charge.\n\nTempers flare between the two as Mial grows ever more high-handed and seems to be making a corrupt deal with the Chedal. Ross goes so far as to attempt to kill Mial, though he fails. Can Ross keep Mial from wrecking the negotiations? And why would Earth send two people who are so incapable of getting along?\n\nI’m not sure why Annie is blowing up here. That didn’t happen. Art by Giunta\n\nThe situation Dickson has created feels rather implausible, even given the explanation at the end. Nevertheless, it’s a decent story, if you can get past the tense atmosphere between the two human characters. Gordy has really settled in as a solid writer who rarely wastes his readers’ time. Three stars.\n\nShort Trip to Nowhere, by Robert Moore Williams\n\nJim Eiler comes home late. His wife Marta is already asleep, as is his three-year-old daughter Nelda. As he slides into his anti-gravity bed and plugs in the cords of the sleep machine, a voice in his head cheerily greets him. There’s a nasty fight with his wife, and eventually he agrees to call in their friend Harold, a psychiatrist. Eventually, it turns out the voice is coming from Nelda’s imaginary friend, who isn’t so imaginary after all. Then Nelda disappears.\n\nThis is another one I felt I had already read in better form. Williams is clearly using Peter Pan as his basis, but there were other resonances. Though different, I was strongly reminded of both Henry Kuttner’s “Mimsy Were the Borogoves” and Mark Clifton’s “Star, Bright”. The bitter relationship between the Eilers makes for an unpleasant read and serves no real purpose, when it could have prompted Nelda’s search for something happier. Instead it’s just bickering. Two stars.\n\nSkylark DuQuesne (Part 5 of 5), by E. E. Smith\n\nSigh. This story does not deserve a detailed summary. In a nutshell, using Ray-See-Nee magic the Skylarkers and friends come up with a new way to combine mind power. They devise a whole bunch of new science and use it to solve the Chloran problem for good. A final solution, you might say. They take the stars from one galaxy and smash them into the stars of planets the Chlorans live on, while taking all the planets with humans living on them and moving them to a third galaxy. And they called Edmond Hamilton the planet killer.\n\nMidway through this attack, the Chlorans counterattack, leaving Seaton and Crane unconscious. DuQuesne leaps into the breach and finishes the job. Afterwards, he proposes to Hunkie de Marigny and the two go off to conquer a galaxy on the rim of the universe. The end. At last.\n\nDick Seaton gets what’s coming to him. Art by Morrow\n\nLet’s start with the slightly less egregious denouement. From the title of this novel, one would expect that we would witness the redemption of Blackie DuQuesne. He does decide that there is room enough in the universe for both him and Dick Seaton and he does open up his shell just a little bit to let someone else in. But that’s as far as it goes. He still plans to make himself the emperor of a galaxy. Worse, he openly states that he’s planning a program of eugenics, one based not just on sterilization, but extermination. Marc C. “Blackie” DuQuesne remains an evil man to the end.\n\nAnd then there’s Dick Seaton. In my review of Part 1, I declared Seaton to be a war criminal, based on his destruction of the Fenachrone homeworld in an earlier novel. Here, after general discussion of what to do about the Chlorans – including a proposal to convert them – he compares the Chlorans to a cancer that must be rooted out (a disgustingly familiar argument) and comes up with a plan to kill every single Chloran before they spread to other galaxies. There are nearly 150 million Chloran planets. We’re talking about the deaths of trillions at the very least. War criminal doesn’t even begin to describe it.\n\nZero stars for genocide and an ending that completely poisons an otherwise mediocre novel whose only redeeming feature is excessive nostalgia.\n\nSumming up\n\nWell, a bleak issue for a bleak month. It got off to a decent start, though the Reynolds story does have a dark tone to it. The Dickson was unpleasant, but in a good way. It was intended to be so and to make readers think. Other than that, poor efforts topped off by a steaming pile of genocide and eugenics. But at long last, it’s over. Do we have anything to look forward to? Let’s hope so.\n\nA wraparound cover this month, so here it is in all its glory. Art, as before, by Gaughan\n\nby John Boston\n\nContinuity and Change\n\nYeah, yeah, I know that’s the most boring headline since the last time Hubert Humphrey made a speech. But that’s what everybody (well, somebody) wants to know: how is the new Amazing different, or not, from the old one?\n\nSome things we already knew. It’s still digest size, now bimonthly, with 32 more pages for a total of 162. On the cover there is a piece of retro-continuity; the new regime has dropped the old title logo for the older title logo, the one used from October 1960 to December 1963, with very minor variations—an improvement, to my taste. There’s a fairly generic cover by Alex Schomburg (I am certain the departed editor Lalli had a closet full of these) portraying, as you see, a guy in a loincloth brandishing a spear at a giant computer: Progress vs. Savagery, or Regimentation vs. Natural Freedom, as you prefer. It is said on the contents page to illustrate Keith Laumer’s Time Bomb. It does not. There are a number of interior illustrations. Coming Next Month has not returned.\n\nby Alex Schomburg\n\nAnd on the contents page . . . oh no. The blazing insignia of continuity are . . . Ensign De Ruyter and Robert F. Young. Forty-six pages of Robert F. Young. Well, let us keep an open mind; here, brace it with this two-by-four. Anyway, it’s a mistake to infer too much from this month’s fiction contents, since the new management will likely be burning off the inherited Ziff-Davis inventory for some months.\n\nThe non-fiction includes another of Robert Silverberg’s articles on scientific hoaxes, and Silverberg’s book review column—good signs if they are signs, but they too may just be what Lalli left behind. Ironically, the review column is devoted entirely to reprints, ranging from Wells to Sturgeon. There is also an editorial, in which Sol Cohen—listed on the contents page as Editor and Publisher—first demonstrates that he can be just as boring as his predecessor in editorializing Norman Lobsenz, and then offers a lame explanation of his plans regularly to publish reprints from old issues of the magazine.\n\nAs for the reprints themselves, Cohen has gone for big names, with early short stories from Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury: respectively, The Weapon Too Dreadful To Use from the May 1939 issue, and Final Victim (with Henry Hasse), from February 1946. Each is accompanied by an unsigned introduction, shorter and less bombastic than those by Sam Moskowitz for the “SF Classic” selections of the Ziff-Davis years. The original illustrations are reprinted along with the stories.\n\nTime Bomb, by Keith Laumer\n\nKeith Laumer’s novelet Time Bomb begins with Yondor, the son of the chief, going over the mountain to look around. And he sees—danger! Wounded on the way back, he makes his way home and reports to the chief that their way of life is at risk and they must act! But the chief doesn’t want to hear it—hey! Wake up back there! If you’re bored, do something useful, like listing all the stories you’ve read that begin with this particular cliche.\n\nby Nodel\n\nAnyway, these primitive characters are the descendants of a human outpost, now menaced by the evil alien Tewk, and Yondor gets away from their attack and into a machine with a transportation system requiring only that he sit in a chair and pull a lever and he’ll be somewhere else. This is a convenient substitute for a plot, as Yondor blunders his way from place to place before learning enough to get back, rescue his people, and smite the bad guys. As generic melodrama goes, it’s smooth and clever enough that it might be mildly entertaining, say, if one were stuck in an airport waiting for a late plane. Two stars.\n\nThe City of Brass, by Robert F. Young\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nOn the other hand, remarkably, Robert F. Young’s The City of Brass is actually fairly amusing, and not offensively stupid like most of his other rehashes of myths, legends, testaments, etc. Billings of Animannikins, Inc., has flown in his time sled back to the days of the Arabian Nights in order to kidnap Scheherazade, here rendered Shahrazad, bring her back to the present so his employers can work up a facsimile for public performance, and then return her to her fate. But Billings kicks some wires in the sled out of place and they wind up stranded in the age of the Jinn (which proves to be about 100,000 years in the future), not far from the Jinn’s brazen city of the title.\n\nShahrazad is undaunted. She doesn’t much like Jinn, and is in possession of a Seal of Solomon (here rendered Suleyman) with which she proposes to force all the Jinn into bottles and seal them up. Billings considers this a reckless plan, and goes out to reconnoiter, setting in train a ridiculous plot involving ridiculous revelations about the Jinn, their origin, and what has happened to humanity in the intervening millennia. This actually might have made it into John W. Campbell’s fantasy magazine Unknown if he had run short of material one month. Young’s familiar sentimentality about beautiful women and the men who are captivated by them threatens to take over, but the story ends quickly enough not to ruin the comic mood.\n\nThree stars. I’ll put that two-by-four back in the shed.\n\nThe Weapon Too Dreadful to Use, by Isaac Asimov\n\nby Julian Krupa\n\nThe reprints from Amazing’s past nicely illustrate the problems with reprinting from Amazing’s past. Asimov’s The Weapon Too Dreadful To Use is his second published story and shows it, with stilted writing, cliched characters and dialogue, and a muddled point. Humans have occupied Venus and are oppressing the natives, though supposedly racial discrimination and hostility have been eliminated on Earth. (Not too plausible.) The protagonist and his Venusian friend Antil trek to the ruins of a Venusian city and visit the science museum, which is largely intact, but no one has looked at it in living memory. (Even less plausible.) In a formerly sealed room, Antil finds the eponymous weapon, which can destroy people’s mental functions at interplanetary distances. (Plausibility meter breaks.) Venus rebels, Earth sends troops, Venus destroys the minds of a lot of them, Earth backs down and grants independence. It’s clear there’s a smart guy here trying to figure out how to write stories, but he’s not there yet. Two stars.\n\nFinal Victim, by Ray Bradbury and Henry Hasse\n\nby Hadden\n\nBradbury and Hasse’s Final Victim is much worse. It is essentially a Bat Durston—a transplanted Western—about a bad deputy, excuse me, Patrolman, Skeel, who always kills the fugitives he is supposed to apprehend. His superior Anders knows his excuses are no good but can’t do anything, until Miss Miller, the sister of Skeel’s most recent kill, who has proven to be innocent of the accusation against him, decides to go after Patrolman Skeel. Anders, noting “the firm line of her chin, the trimness of her space uniform, the hard bold blueness of her eyes which he imagined could easily be soft on less drastic occasions than this,” decides to set her up to ambush Skeel herself out on the plains, I mean asteroids, and take revenge. But when things get really tough, Miss Miller faints. I stopped there. Forget stars. One mud pie.\n\nThe Good Seed, by Arthur Porges\n\nArthur Porges’s The Good Seed, as mentioned, is another in the series about Ensign De Ruyter. As usual it has some Earth guys at the mercy of treacherous primitive aliens, and they solve their problem with a scientific gimmick that you might find in the Fun with Science column of a kids’ magazine. One star.\n\nJohn Keely’s Perpetual Motion Machine, by Robert Silverberg\n\nRobert Silverberg comes to the rescue in his article about a guy who managed to make a pretty good career out of the perpetual motion con, but ironically might have had a better one developing the means of his fraud in the light of day. This is by far the best story in the issue, despite the fact that it is apparently true. Four stars.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWell, that was dismal, wasn’t it? Except for the Mitigation of Robert F. Young (can someone make a ballad out of that?) and Silverberg’s matter-of-fact competence at storytelling and -finding, nothing to see here, move on, move on.\n\n[Come join us at Portal 55, Galactic Journey's real-time lounge! Talk about your favorite SFF, chat with the Traveler and co., relax, sit a spell…]\n\nby Gideon Marcus\n\nMilestones\n\nGalaxy has now finished 15 years of publication, two thirds of it under the tenure of H. L. Gold and the last five years with Fred Pohl as editor. If Analog (ne Astounding) is representative of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, and Fantasy and Science Fiction represents the literary fringes of the genre, then Galaxy is emblematic of Science Fiction's Silver Age.\n\nNow, in the editorial for this month's issue, Pohl notes that Galaxy has evolved with the times and is a different magazine from the one that debuted with an October 1950 cover date.\n\nI'm not sure I agree. The magazine still looks largely the same, there's still a Willy Ley article in the middle, and the contents still feel roughly within the same milieu: a bit \"softer\" than the nuts and bolts in Analog, a little meatier than the often light fare of F&SF. Certainly nothing so avant-garde as what we're seeing from the \"New Wave\" mags in the UK.\n\nIn any event, Pohl undercuts his own assertion by trumpeting next month's issue, which will feature nothing but alumni from the early days of the magazine. I'm quite looking forward to it, and clearly Pohl is, too.\n\nAnd after reading this month's issue, boy can I see why…\n\nRecipe for Disaster\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nDo I Wake or Dream?, by Frank Herbert\n\nThe creator of Dune and other lesser titles dominates the current issue: a full 119 pages are devoted to this short novel. I was dreading it last month, and my dread was well-founded. Here's the premise:\n\nA giant sphere of a ship, the Earthling, is headed out of the solar system toward Tau Ceti. On board are six normal human crew, two thousand frozen and dehydrated people, and a thousand embryos. The humans are all genetic duplicates (with full memories, natch) of actual people, and their main job is to tend the ship-controlling disembodied human brains of \"defectives\" that have been integrated and trained for the task since birth (a la McCaffrey's The Ship who Sang or Niven's recent series starring Eric the Cyborg).\n\nOne by one, the three brains go nuts and either commit suicide or have to be shut down. Two of the tending crew are murdered in the process. Now the remaining four have to decide whether to turn back or not. Complicating the decision is the fact that running the ship without a built-in brain is virtually impossible — the ship has been designed to be extremely delicate to handle, even to the point of having artificial crises pop up just to keep the crew on their toes!\n\nUltimately, the crew decides to thaw a frozen doctor (so they have, you know, one woman in their ranks) and then, together, create an artificial computer brain to run the ship.\n\nAnd if that's not enough random factors to juggle, it is also noted that the Earthling is the seventh ship to have its brains all give up. So this problem has happened twenty one times (what is it that Einstein is reputed to have said about the definition of madness?) And the last time humanity tried to build a sentient computer, the computer, the installation in which it was developed, indeed the entire island disappeared off the face of the Earth into some other dimension, destination unknown.\n\nHerbert is nothing if not ambitious.\n\nby John Giunta\n\nHe is, however, also a lousy writer. I said as much after reading the sprawling, tedious, and humorless Dune World and its second half, Prophet of Dune. One of my readers suggested that Herbert's third-person omniscient perspective, switching viewpoint characters almost every line, accented by (often superfluous) musings in italics was a deliberate stylistic choice to render the telepathic resonance shared by users of the spice melange. But he uses the exact same style in Do I Wake, and there is nothing supernatural in this book.\n\nI also found the overt anti-woman prejudice annoying, with the woman doctor character starting out pumped full of anti-sex drugs to keep her from being too excited all the time (one of the men debates taking some, himself, because he worries he'll be too attracted to the doctor; he decides against it because they reduce intelligence. Fine for her, though.) Even the drawing of the doctor features her tawdrily topless.\n\nThen there is the endless technical jargon that is not only gibberish, but often archaic gibberish: describing the ship's computer's \"relays\" (as opposed to transistors or microcircuits) is anachronistic for modern times, more so for machines of the future.\n\nSo, not only is Do I Wake a distinct displeasure to read, but it also is utterly implausible every step of the way. At the Journey, we attempt to review everything in the genre that gets put to print, but we refuse to do it to the point of mortification. I gave up on page 40, and you should feel no shame if you follow suit.\n\nOne star.\n\nPeeping Tommy, by Robert F. Young\n\nYet another Robert F. Young reworking of a fable. It keeps you engaged until the end, which is typically terrible.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Galactic Giants, by Willy Ley\n\nThe one bright spot in the issue is Ley's competent science article, the majority of which is devoted to giant stars. The rest deals with tape as a medium for data storage.\n\nInteresting stuff. Four stars.\n\nPlease State My Business, by Michael Kurland\n\nA traveling salesman from the future ends up in the wrong century. High jinks ensue. Well, given that the story starts with a sexual assault and ends with a whimper, the jinks are rather low.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nThe Shipwrecked Hotel, by James Blish and Norman L. Knight\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nSeven hundred years from now, the Earth houses One Trillion Humans in relative comfort. This piece details the unfortunate saga of the \"Barrier-hilthon\", a beach-ball shaped hotel loosely anchored in the South Pacific. Thanks to some literal bugs in the system, it becomes unmoored, ultimately crashing into an undersea mountain. A rescue follows.\n\nHotel could have made an excellent novel by Arthur C. Clarke — a cross between A Fall of Moondust and Dolphin Island. As is, it's not only surprisingly amateur, but it's also just sort of lifeless, more plot thumbnail than story.\n\nI was a bit surprised as Hotel's expository style did not feel like James Blish at all (I don't know who Norman L. Knight is). Then I got to the end where it says the story was by James H. Schmitz and Norman L. Knight. I'm not sure whether its Blish or Schmitz, but Schmitz makes a lot more sense. Schmitz is often good, but he's also often not, and in just this sort of way.\n\nTwo stars.\n\nGalaxy Bookshelf, by Algis Budrys\n\nI don't normally devote inches to the book columns. Nevertheless, I've given Budrys a long rope since he came on few months ago, and I can now say with certainty that not only is his judgment orthogonal to mine, but his writing is impenetrable, too. This is a pity. I've liked much of the fiction Budrys has written (at least long ago when he was writing consistently), and I used to greatly value Galaxy's book reviews.\n\nAll Hope Abandoned\n\nWow. That was just dreadful. The only faint praise I can damn with is that the Herbert novel was so bad, it meant I didn't have to waste time on 80 pages of the magazine. This is, without a doubt, the most worthless issue in the Galaxy series.\n\nAt least the bar to clear for next month is nice and low!\n\nIf you need to get the bad taste out of your mouth (and I know I do!) come register for this week's The Journey Show!\n\nWe'll be discussing the latest fashion trends of 1965, and we have some amazing guests including the founder of Bésame Cosmetics. Plus, you'll get to see the Young Traveler show off her newest outfits!\n\nDON'T MISS IT!\n\nby Victoria Silverwolf\n\nThe Four Forbidden Topics\n\nGathered around the dinner table with the family, or just chatting with friends, it's generally a good idea to avoid controversial subjects. Religion and politics, for example, are likely to lead to unpleasant arguments. Maybe Uncle Fred is a Goldwater buff, and Cousin Sue goes all the way with LBJ. Possibly you've got buddies who belong to different faiths, or none at all. Better to let sleeping dogs lie, and talk about something else.\n\nThe topic of money, or economics in general, may not be as controversial, but talking about how much you've got, or what somebody else earns, is generally considered to be in bad taste. As for sex, well, that's usually too personal to discuss, particularly if the kiddies are around.\n\nMaybe it's a sign of the times, or maybe it's the influence of the British New Wave on science fiction, but the lead serial in the latest issue of Worlds of Tomorrow deals with religion, politics, and economics. That leaves sex, which shows up at the end of the magazine, like a tempting dessert.\n\nCover art by John Pederson, Jr.\n\nOf Godlike Power (Part One of Two), by Mack Reynolds\n\nIllustrations by Jack Gaughan\n\nAs indicated in the picture above, this novel takes place in a world of flying cars and other futuristic stuff. More relevant to the plot is the fact that automation results in a majority of folks being unemployed, but enjoying a reasonably comfortable existence in an affluent welfare society.\n\nThe protagonist hosts a radio show dealing with flying saucers, reincarnation, and other weird stuff. He's dating the daughter of the tycoon who owns the station, mostly in an attempt to move up to a position in television. Dad, daughter, and the station manager all belong to a right-wing organization dedicated to ferreting out commies and pinkos. (To give you some idea of this group, they think of the John Birch Society as too liberal.)\n\nThe manager asks our hero to check out the revival meetings of a preacher whom they suspect of subversion. He's supposed to be on a date with his wealthy girlfriend, so she reluctantly tags along.\n\nThe preacher speaks in vaguely religious language of an eccentric sort, frequently making reference to something called the All-Mother. What he really talks about, however, is the world's economic system, condemning wasteful practices such as pointless changes in car design, fads and fashions that come and go, planned obsolescence, and conspicuous consumption.\n\nThis is too much for the rich woman, so she heckles him. The preacher loses his temper and rants against makeup, fancy clothing, and elaborate hairdos. The next thing you know, the woman changes her ways, dressing simply and avoiding cosmetics. Not that she agrees with the guy, you understand; it's just that those things make her itch unbearably. Pretty soon the same thing happens to women all over the world, ushering in an era of down home, farm girl fashions.\n\nCrisis in the radio studio!\n\nThe preacher winds up on the protagonist's radio show. Things get out of control, so the fellow goes into another tirade, this time against radio and, by extension, television.\n\nThe reader is way ahead of the characters by this point, so it's not a big surprise when all broadcasting goes haywire, forcing people to abandon their favorite forms of entertainment. With all those unemployed folks desperate for something to fill their hours, there's a sudden shortage of comic books and magazines. Bars and movie theaters are packed to overflowing. Even the preacher's revival meetings attract huge crowds, just because they have nothing else to do.\n\nWould you buy a used car from this man?\n\nAlthough not comic in tone, the novel has a strong satiric edge to it. The setting may be some years from now, but the author is really talking about today. The targets of his barbed examination of modern society are overproduction and excess consumption, as well as the seductive power of the electronic media.\n\nThe style is very readable, carrying you along as you follow the misadventures of the hapless hero. The preacher's astonishing ability to transform the world may not be particularly plausible, but once you swallow the premise the way it plays out is enjoyable.\n\nReynolds likes to play games with politics, and perform thought experiments with different economic systems, so I predict the second half of the novel will portray a new society, possibly a utopian one. We'll see if I'm right a couple of months from now.\n\nFour stars.\n\nComing Out Party, by Robert Lory\n\nIllustration by Norman Nodel\n\nThis brief tale begins with a young woman getting ready for the event mentioned in the title. Our first hint that something strange is going on is the fact that she's stark naked in front of her parents. The ceremony is also full of nude women. (Sorry, ladies, all the erotic content of this issue is obviously aimed at a male audience.)\n\nI dare not say anything else about what happens, except to mention that the shock ending is an effective one. This is one of those stories that depends entirely on the twist in its tail. It succeeds at the modest goal it sets for itself.\n\nThree stars.\n\nThe Shape of Us to Come, by Michael Girsdansky\n\nLet's take a break from controversial topics of discussion and learn something about the way people might alter their bodies in the future. The author considers the fact that viruses inject their genetic information into the cells of other organisms, using the biological machinery of their hosts to reproduce themselves. The article speculates about the possibility of harnessing this ability to alter the genetics of humans in desirable ways.\n\nUsing this technique to treat diseases such as cancer seems reasonably plausible. The suggestion that the body might be changed in radical ways, to ensure survival on alien worlds, is a little less so. In any case, it's an interesting subject, and I learned something about viruses.\n\nThree stars.\n\nWorld of the Spectrum, by Emil Petaja\n\nIllustrations by John Giunta\n\nTake a look at that picture. We've got a muscular hero with a bladed weapon and a big, ugly monster. Am I reading the wrong magazine? Is this a sword-and-sorcery yarn, rescued from the yellowing pages of Weird Tales?\n\nThat's what it seems like at first, but we soon find out that this world of mighty barbarians fighting bizarre creatures exists for the amusement of the upper class on Earth, who vicariously experience the thrill of battle through a kind of telepathic sensory television.\n\nThe hero is in mental communication with a woman he thinks of as a princess in a castle located at the top of a cliff that nobody can climb. Naturally, he overcomes impossible odds and reaches the place, only to discover that things are not what they seem.\n\nDon't look down!\n\nThe woman is actually a member of the upper class, who secretly belongs to a group of folks working to overthrow their repressive society. She uses a teleportation device to bring the man to Earth, teaching him about the place and enlisting him in her struggle. After many adventures, she confronts the ruler of the world, who turns out to be truly grotesque.\n\nThe heroine is shocked by what she sees.\n\nDespite the science fiction explanation for everything, the story feels more like a fantasy adventure. The ruler of Earth might as well be another hideous monster for the hero to destroy. At first, the woman seems to be nothing more than a sexually provocative nitwit, but this is only a role she plays in order to further her plans. The main flaw is the need for a lot of expository dialogue to explain the complex background, with people telling each other things they should already know.\n\nThree stars.\n\nLunar Weapons Tomorrow, by Joseph Wesley\n\nBefore we move on to sex, let's talk about something much less shocking, like war. (There's something wrong with that sentence, but I'll think about it later.)\n\nThe author starts this piece about military use of the Moon by dismissing the idea that it could be used to launch missiles at an enemy on Earth. He points out that this method is more difficult, more expensive, less effective, and less defensible than other ways of destroying the planet. Somehow I'm not reassured.\n\nHe goes on to imagine lunar military installations, assuming that these will be common in about twenty years or so. His prediction is that these will engage in a kind of lukewarm war, neither one completely destroying the other lest it be wiped out as well. Instead, the opposing forces make relatively minor forays against each other, fighting for territory in a futuristic version of the trench warfare of World War One.\n\nThe dry and rather frightening subject of this article is made more readable through the use of a fictional soldier on the Moon. We follow him as he watches for an enemy advance, and even engages in hand-to-hand combat, of a sort, in a spacesuit.\n\nThree stars.\n\nA Glass of Mars, by Robert F. Young\n\nIllustrations by Gray Morrow\n\nThe version of the Red Planet depicted in this story is closer to the imaginings of Ray Bradbury than what most scientists believe. Maybe the Mariner 4 spacecraft, now on its way to Mars, will tell us who's right. Anyway, the plot takes place at least a full generation after people colonized the planet, building on the ancient ruins of the long-vanished Martians.\n\nThe main character is a new arrival, with romantic ideas about the distant past. In sharp contrast, his secretary, born on Mars, is all about the present. Like other women native to the planet, she is sexually assertive, openly boasting about her measurements, calling herself a sex machine, and offering to sleep with her boss (with the assumption that they will be married soon after.)\n\nWhile commuting across the surface of Mars, the fellow is miraculously transported to the past. He meets a Martian woman, as delicately beautiful and demure as he imagined.\n\n(In just about all ways except language, the Martian is completely human. We're told, more than once, that she has hyacinth hair. This rather obscure metaphor is taken from Edgar Allan Poe's ode To Helen, and it's not much clearer in the original. The allusion seems designed to suggest the man's dreamy vision of the ancient Martian woman, as romantic as Poe's poem.)\n\nThe ancient Martian and the modern human. Gentlemen, which one would you pick?\n\nWithout giving too much away, let's just say that the man's assumptions aren't completely accurate. I expected this to be a simple fable about the superiority of the past over the vulgarity of the present, but it's a little more complex than that. The author, no stranger to sentimental love stories and idealization of women, almost seems to be chiding himself for his romantic tendencies. The plot is pure fantasy, of course, but if you can get past that, it's worth a look.\n\nThree stars.\n\nShall We Talk About It?\n\nOverall, this was a pretty decent issue. Nothing was less than average, and the serialized novel was a high point. Maybe I'm just in a good mood. In any case, I would caution you to make sure that you discuss the themes raised in the magazine only under the right circumstances. Remember what Mom told you!\n\nShe didn't mention money or sex. Two out of four ain't bad.\n\nhttps://event.webinarjam.com/register/34/3q3prsl6\n\nby John Boston\n\nChanging of the Guard\n\nSo here we are at the end of the Ziff-Davis Amazing and the editorship of Cele Lalli. What’s next? The magazine doesn’t say. “Coming Next Month” is conspicuous by its absence, as are interior illustrations. But the story is being told elsewhere. The banner headline on Science Fiction Times for last month—if “banner” is the word for large crude mimeographed lettering—says “ ‘AMAZING’ AND ‘FANTASTIC’ GO BI-MONTHLY & ADD 32 PAGES,” just above “DON FORD IS DEAD!”\n\nThe first post-Z-D issue will be the August Amazing, and thereafter the magazines will be published in alternate months as the new owner and editor try to build circulation, by leaving each issue on sale for a longer time, in preparation for a return to monthly publication. The new publisher, as previously disclosed, will be Sol Cohen, and now it is announced that the managing editor—presumably, the guy who picks the stories—will be Joseph Ross, actual name Joseph Wrzos, but he is showing mercy to native English spellers.\n\nPart of the plan for the new Amazing (and the new Fantastic too) is to use reprints as part of the contents, along with the original illustrations, a policy the SF Times describes as a “well-liked” recent feature of the Ziff-Davis Amazing. Well-liked by some, no doubt, but most of the stories seemed to me to have only historical interest.\n\nWorse, even partial reliance on reprints from Amazing is a bad bet at least for any long term, since Amazing has been pretty mediocre through most of its history. During the 1930s it fell progressively further behind the limited competition of the day, both in circulation and in interest, and then was purchased by Ziff-Davis and put in the charge of the notorious Ray Palmer, whose instruction to writers is said to have been “Gimme bang-bang.” From 1938 to 1949 Palmer filled the magazine with formulaic and juvenile adventure fiction, much of it produced by a coterie of local Chicago writers who mostly published little or nothing elsewhere, with much of their output in Amazing appearing under “house names” (pseudonyms maintained by the publisher for work by multiple writers).\n\nThe magazine enjoyed a brief renaissance (well, maybe a nascence) starting in 1953 when it switched from pulp to digest size and, more importantly, raised its pay rates, attracting bigger names and better material. But it didn’t last; the rates were cut, and the magazine reverted by late 1954 to calculated mediocrity: mostly formulaic contents written by a new stable of regulars, though they kept some of the old house names, such as the durable Alexander Blade, a byline that flourished from 1940 to 1958. Little improvement was visible until about 1959, when new editor Cele Goldsmith began her salvage operation.\n\nSo the past of Amazing is a barrel whose bottom will be scraped quickly, full of fish mostly not worth shooting. One hopes for something more forward-looking as well from the new regime.\n\nThe Issue at Hand\n\nby Gray Morrow\n\nThis final Ziff-Davis issue exemplifies the decidedly mixed bag of the Cele Goldsmith/Lalli regime: a potboiler of a serial from a prominent writer, an exercise in the higher self-parody by one of her best-known discoveries, a brief inconsequential story by a completely unknown new writer . . . the inescapable nemesis Robert F. Young . . . and David R. Bunch, the writer the readers loved to hate. Not only is his story flagged and illustrated on the cover, but Bunch is also profiled and quoted extensively in the final editorial. (Usually they’re by Lobsenz, but this one isn’t signed. Lalli, maybe, at last?) This celebration of Bunch might be viewed as a final gesture of defiance from the editorial team, especially given the cover illustration of a robot waving two sledge hammers in fury. But . . . probably not. After all, Lalli is sticking around Ziff-Davis to edit Modern Bride.\n\nThe Corridors of Time (Part 2 of 2), by Poul Anderson\n\nThe largest fiction item is the conclusion of Poul Anderson’s perfectly adequate but neither inspired nor inspiring serial The Corridors of Time, the title of which is unfortunately literal. Our hero Lockridge has been hired by the beautiful, enigmatic, and imperious Storm Dalloway to help her find some buried treasure in Jutland, but what she’s really about is a time war. Turns out there are two contending factions, the Wardens and the Rangers, the former (Storm’s side) supporting a relaxed social philosophy consonant with matriarchal religion and traditional knowledge, the latter supporting a more regimented view consonant with science and patriarchal religion (to oversimplify grossly—and it is a bit of a set-up on Anderson’s part).\n\nSo how does this time war work? Well, there’s the rub, or lack of one. Unlike its predecessors—Leiber’s Change War series, Jack Williamson’s The Legion of Time, Anderson’s own Time Patrol stories—in this one, you can’t change history. So . . . what’s the point? Well, as the synopsis (presumably written by Anderson) puts it, an agent can “become part of it, setting the mark of his own civilization on a culture and thus building up reserves for a final showdown.” That’s not changing history? Maybe just a little?\n\nThis makes no sense at all, and undermines the story. The time travel mechanism doesn’t help either. The Corridors of Time are just that, long corridors buried in the earth at various places, with access to various times over spans of a few thousand years; just walk or ride down the corridor, and you go 35 days per foot, and you take the exit you want for the time you want, and also you can have chases and shootouts up and down the corridor, as happens within the first few pages. As icons of the imagination go, this is pretty unimaginative.\n\nOn the plus side, Anderson gets to chase his characters around various historical eras, which Anderson seems to know well and in most cases to prefer to the present, and Lockridge reluctantly finds himself with an appealing Neolithic girlfriend (setting up an . . . unusual . . . triangle with Miss Dalloway), and ultimately Lockridge decides not to go back to the Twentieth Century, in a final affirmation of the barbarian virtues. Overall, perfectly readable product, but below standard for a writer who has done much better. Three stars, barely. There’s a note indicating an expanded version is to come from Doubleday later.\n\nThe Furies, by Roger Zelazny\n\nRoger Zelazny’s novelet The Furies is ridiculous—purposefully so, it seems. The author spends the first six pages in exposition, introducing us to Sandor Sandor, catastrophically disabled, but also a non-idiot savant with encyclopedic knowledge and memory of places all around the galaxy; Benedick Benedict, who upon shaking hands with another person, becomes privy to all that person’s most shameful secrets, which he proceeds to gossip about—and his talents extend to inanimate objects and animals; Lynx Links, who “looked like a beachball with a beard” but by calling is the galaxy’s most accomplished assassin; and (former) Captain Victor Corgo, “the man without a heart” (literally, replaced by a machine), formerly “a terror to brigands and ugly aliens, a threat to Code-breakers, and a thorn in the sides of evil-doers everywhere,” but now gone wrong.\n\nThe first three of these are the Furies, so-called by the author after the ancient Greeks’ “chthonic goddesses of vengeance” (says the Britannica), here retained by the authorities to chase down Corgo, a sort of Captain Nemo figure who has turned against humanity based on outrages we need not recount. The story is rendered throughout in extravagant language and stylized dialogue. A mid-range sample of the former:\n\n“One time the Wallaby [Corgo’s spaceship] was a proud Guardship, an ebony toadstool studded with the jewel-like warts of fast-phase projectors. One time the Wallaby skipped proud about the frontier worlds of Interstel, meting out the unique justice of the Uniform Galactic Code—in those places where there was no other law. One time the proud Wallaby, under the command of Captain Victor Corgo of the Guard, had ranged deep space and time and become a legend under legendary skies.”\n\nSo what we have here is midway between a technical exercise and a barroom bet. Zelazny has taken about the most hackneyed materials available and tried to render them publishable by pure force of his considerable writing skill, no doubt enhanced by his theatrical background, and he has succeeded. That is, he has dazzled enough rubes to get this into print, and has considerably amused me. If the young Shakespeare had started out in comic books (the names and talents of the Furies certainly suggest comic-book superheroes), the result might have been similar. Four stars, but watch it, guy: you can’t get away with this more than once. Or can you?\n\nThe Walking Talking I-Don't-Care Man, by David R. Bunch\n\nAs for Bunch (and speaking of extravagant language) the latest Moderan tale The Walking Talking I-Don’t-Care Man is made of that, though it’s more straightforward and lucid than some of its predecessors. The titular Man has had himself entirely replaced with metal, unlike Bunch’s protagonist in his Stronghold who still hangs on to his flesh-strips. The Man purports to have resolved the great philosophical dilemma of human existence by giving up humanity . . . but he still wouldn’t mind finding God and going after it with his sledge hammers.\n\nOne could conclude that this meditation, or harangue, on last things might be the end of the Moderan series . . . except the point seems to be that last things really aren’t last. But hey, four stars, at least in the spirit of “best of breed,” which I’d say this is for Bunch. Note to future bibliographers: the commas in the title on the cover do not appear inside the magazine.\n\nRumpelstiltskinski, by Robert F. Young\n\nAnd now comes the inexorable reckoning: Robert F. Young, square athwart the road, and no shoulder to slip by on. First the bad news: Rumplestiltskinski is another of Young’s affected fairy tale rehashes, beginning “Once there was a miller who was car-poor but who had a luscious dish of a daughter named Ada.” The good news: it’s quite short and ostentatiously pointless, a sort of shaggy fairy story, perhaps signifying that Young is getting tired of himself. Let me encourage him in that. One star.\n\nSatyr, by Judith E. Schrier\n\nFinally, and almost imperceptibly, we have Satyr, a (very) short story by Judith E. Schrier. Who? Precisely—no one else has heard of her either, at least according to the available indexes. An unmarried older woman works the night shift as a computer operator and the computer professes its love, she realizes how masculine it is, etc. etc. to the obvious end. Slickly written, at least. Two stars, barely.\n\nLo! The Poor Forteans, by Sam Moskowitz\n\nSam Moskowitz plays out his season (rumor having it that he won’t be part of the new Amazing) with Lo! The Poor Forteans, a moderately interesting biographical sketch of Charles Fort and history of the Fortean movement, such as it is or was. There is also some rambling and mostly perfunctory discussion of the Fortean influence in science fiction, much of which we know about because the authors (like Edmond Hamiliton and Eric Frank Russell) have commented on it, but much of which is questionable (The Children’s Hour by Lawrence O’Donnell a/k/a C.L. Moore? I doubt it). Moskowitz has also omitted some other fairly obvious candidates like Heinlein’s The Puppet Masters. Moskowitz also tediously belabors his own disdain for Forteanism. But still, three stars, chiefly for the history and not the commentary.\n\nSumming Up\n\nThe Ziff-Davis Amazing under Lalli was always full of promise but never managed to deliver on it for more than a month or two at a time. It winds down on a respectable note, with above-average stories from two of its most characteristic authors, plus a competent middle-of-the-road serial. Quo nunc vadis Amazing?\n\nSpeaking of changed circumstances at publishing houses, please read this — it's important!"
