Then contact us now.\n\nDecloak Music Collaborates on Hard Techno Tracks with DJ TRY for \"Freedom\" Art Project\n\nIn a collaboration that merges art and music, Decloak Music joined forces with Manchester based artist Maggie Stick, AKA DJ TRY to produce two hard techno tracks for her thought-provoking art project \"Freedom.\" This cutting-edge venture, comprising powerful vocals provided by DJ TRY, amplifies the project's message of migration, home, and the fight for freedom.\n\nMaggie’s \"Freedom\" project revolves around creating a sense of belonging in a foreign land and shedding light on the challenges faced by migrants in search of a place to call their own. The installation features a second-hand shed transformed into a free home, a poignant symbol of cultural fusion.\n\nThe heart of the project is embodied in \"Hardcore Cracovianka,\" a resilient alter ego representing DJ TRY's journey from Kraków, Poland, to the UK. Through captivating visuals and an emotive narrative, the character's struggle and determination to fight against oppressive forces come to life.\n\nDecloak Music's Jack Barton collaborated with DJ TRY to produce two hard techno tracks, where DJ TRY's vocals take center stage. These tracks serve as an aural backdrop to the \"Freedom\" installation, complementing the immersive experience with evocative beats and powerful lyrics.\n\nDJ TRY's aggressive and emotive vocals weaves into the hard rhythms, mirroring the emotional and narrative depth of the art project. The tracks, produced in Berlin, add an extra layer of intensity to the character's transformation as she confronts the metaphorical \"Red Dragon,\" a representation of the government.\n\nThe collaboration culminated in a performance where Maggie, under her alter ego, delivered a set at an anti-fascist protest in Kraków, Poland. This powerful performance not only showcased the musical prowess of the two but also highlighted the importance of using art and music to drive social change.\n\nThe \"Freedom\" project was the final stage in Maggies studies at the University of Salford and her BA Fine Art Degree. It showcased a testament to the strength and resilience of migrants, aiming to spark conversations and challenge societal attitudes towards migration. By blending personal narratives, cultural symbolism, and elements of protest, the installation invites viewers to reflect on their perceptions of home, migration, and the pursuit of freedom.\n\nDecloak Music's collaboration with DJ TRY not only elevates the impact of the \"Freedom\" project but also demonstrates the potential of art and music to drive social awareness and change.\n\nThrough this unique artistic synergy, Maggie Sticks's \"Freedom\" installation has become an even more potent force in sparking empathy, understanding, and dialogue about the universal human longing for a place to call home. The two hard techno tracks provided the ideal soundtrack to accompany this thought-provoking journey of migration, resilience, and the fight for freedom.\n\nVisitors to the \"Freedom\" installation were able to experience the immersive power of the tracks with the art project's narrative to create a captivating experience that lingered long after the performance ended.\n\nYou can keep up with her future projects and art works on Instagram via through the username maggiestick.art_ or via her website.\n\nDecloak Deep-Tech Sample Pack In Association With Zonal Audio\n\nIt’s Time To Get Deep…\n\nDive into a world of mesmerising melodies, groovy basslines, soulful chords, atmospheric pads, crisp drum loops, and a wealth of unique one-shots.

Undeterred by the craziness of the world around us at that time, he was the first one to jump at the chance to continue with his learning following our hasty scramble to take things online with our classes, something we are incredibly grateful for to this day.\n\nWith a solid focus on techno as the style he wanted to create, his commitment to the craft was clear from the start. Like many who came through our doors before him Tom was already DJing in and around Manchester and he came to us to take the next step in learning how to produce within Ableton Live.\n\nSince completing his course towards the end of 2022, Tom has been on quite the journey. Moving down to London for a short while he fine tuned and crafted his sound and continued master his skills, culminating in a combination of groovy and rolling percussive rich techno which is so popular on the underground dance floors across Europe currently.\n\nTom had his first release picked up by Berlin’s SYXT, joining a roster of underground names such as Temudo, no.name and RONY Group on a label which has been making waves in the city since their first release back in 2018. A full EP consisting of 4 original tracks, this would be the first of many productions to reach the release phase for the up and coming artist.\n\nFollowing this his second EP, Nebula was picked up by the formidable Canticle Records run by Berlin’s very own Assumption. Released in Febuary of 2023, with the mastering done by the man himself Rene Wise, this subsequent EP was to cement Tom in a groove that set the tone for what would be a productive year to come.\n\nHis next release was picked up by Influenced Records for their second VA, which featured a total of 13 tracks.\n\nInfluenced Records, a London based techno label has been pushing out up and coming Underground producers for the past few years.\n\nFollowing this, Tom’s next release came in the form of a remix with Japan’s established techno producer and fellow Ableton tutor Toru Ikemotu on his Chimera series of releases which can be found on Toru’s Bandcamp page below.\n\nIn this past month Tom has seen the release of his third full EP, featuring 4 original tracks and a remix by Toru Ikemotu. Released on Dublin’s Syncopated Records, the whole release is a complete banger from start to finish. With his sound now fully established in the popularised grooves that are dominating the underground dancefloors of Europe, this EP is a must have for any techno producer in 2023.\n\nCheck out the full EP below and show your support by getting your copy on Bandcamp.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for more upcoming gigs and releases from Tom Healey over on his Instagram page.\n\nAnother Decloak Client Gets Music Signed to Label\n\nMore good news from Decloak veterans this week as another client of ours, Dave Louca, has just had his first track signed as his new solo artist alias, Love Assassins.\n\nLove Assassins “Brighter In The Darkness” fuses piano house with happy hardcore chords and rave breakbeats. A classic house vocal combines to give an anthemic party tune. Dave, aka Love Assassins draws on his wide range of influences as a DJ, Producer and A&R to make a track full of old-skool influences.\n\nSigning the track to LFTD Global (Light From The Dark) [lftdglobal.com] and is due for release on 25th August 2023 with club promotion starting in June.\n\nLove Assassins found early success in 2006 working with fantastic producers at Big In Ibiza records, Pete Pritchard and Josh McInnes, with vocals from JoBabe who all worked on their debut club smash, Teardrops which featured killer remixes from Fonzerelli and Agent X, gaining big international DJ support, global radio spins, exclusive licenses around the world and features on no.1 selling compilation albums from Ministry of Sound.\n\nFor over 20 years, Dave has rocked parties, clubs and radio with no nonsense, fun, party tracks across an eclectic mix of dance genres including house, trance, hard house and hardcore.\n\nFor 8 years Dave was Head of A&R and Marketing at the influential records labels Nukleuz Records, Big In Ibiza and Media Records. His big break came following a monthly residency on Ministry of Sound Radio, playing at Turnmills and warming up for Basement Jaxx before then DJ mixing numerous compilation albums, reaching a height with several #2 UK compilation albums (CD) and #1 UK and US iTunes dance albums.\n\nAfter a break from the music industry, in 2021 Dave decided that he wanted to produce his own house music which he could then put out on his own label, Freshcrew Records (freshcrewrecords.co.uk) or sign to other record labels around the world. To help, he worked with Decloak music and Zonal Studios for mentoring, tuition, guidance and inspiration.\n\nDave adds, “Decloak got me where I wanted to be, able to produce to a high standard and compete in the crowded house music field. ZNL Mastering also helped add that extra polish and final tweaks to really help elevate my sound.”\n\n“Brighter In The Darkness” is Dave’s first signing of his solo production material and marks the start of a fun adventure in the world of music production, continuing the big, commercial, party house sound that Love Assassins are known for.\n\nMasterclass Student Get Featured in Local Paper After Reaching Number 4 in the Charts.\n\nThis month one of our past Ableton Live Masterclass students was featured in the Shropshire Star with news he had released his first track and it reaching the number 4 spot on Beatport.\n\nManaging to crawl up the charts, only being pipped to the top spot by heavy-hitters Floorplan and Master As Work, Kevins track settled at the Number 4 spot - a great achievement for someone who had only began to learn music production less than 6 months prior.\n\nMany thanks for Kevin for the plug within the article, sharing the love and giving our humble little teaching platform a little push.\n\nYou can read the full article here: Shropshire DJ releases first track to raise money for charity\n\nDecloak Masterclass Student Gets First Track Played on BBC Introducing.\n\nKevin Taylor has been mixing tracks up and down the country for the best part of four decades and is part of the Underground Kollektiv - a global collective of house and techno DJs delivering regular radio shows and events.\n\nIt was his love of deep and progressive house music that brought him to us back in summer of this year as he wanted to apply his years of experience in listening and playing the music into learning music production.\n\nWith little to no knowledge in music production or Ableton Live he began on our Online Ableton Live Masterclass back in June. Delivering the sessions around his preferred tastes in dance music, Kevin soon showed why a passion for the music and a solid amount of experience listening to and DJing this music can fast-track the learning experience.\n\nQuickly taking to the theory and practical sides to the course, within 16 weeks Kevin had created his first track from scrach completely on his own and this month had a track picked up by BBC Introducing and played on air on 3rd December.\n\nAn upbeat, french house inspired banger with a beautiful vocal it was only an experiment by Kevin as he continues to explore his artistic direction. However, since sharing it with some of his network it has received some nice critiques from various DJs such as RobinVP and radio show hosts prompting him to send it out under the alias DJ Kevski.\n\nBBC Music Introducing is BBC Radio's platform supporting unsigned, undiscovered, and under-the-radar UK music talent since 2007. It has given a springboard opportunity to acts such as London Grammar, JME & Skepta and Alt-J to name a few. In 2017 BBC Music Introducing was present at Creamfields and the Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), focusing solely on DJs and electronic acts for the first time.\n\nThe full show can be found at the link below and Kevins track can be found by forwarding to 1:39:30.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0dg2xv2\n\nFollow Kevins socials here for regular DJ mixes.\n\nMixcloud\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFacebook\n\nUnderground Kollektiv\n\nYou can also see what Kevin thought about his time with us via his review on Facebook.

Learning quickly he began releasing a few years later and has now mastered his sound. Groovy, stripped back techno.

Their focus is on the the deeper, edgier and darker side of electronic music, and there are forthcoming packs from several talented artists.\n\nOne of the packs we decided to take a closer look at is the “Weird & Wonderful Textures” pack which has loads of mind bending textures and drones which really are inspiring and can be used in so many ways. We tried dropping in some full samples length and keeping them low in the mix for some unique atmosphere and depth, and we also decided to throw them into Ableton’s sampler then using the slice mode in conjunction with a sequencer and it yielded some very interesting results indeed! They have even included some presets that were used to create these samples which we had a play with - you could see these sounds fitting into cinematic sound design pieces just as well as almost any genre of music.\n\nZonal Audio have kindly offered a discount code for Decloak students and associates - just enter the code “decloak20” when checking out for a full 20% off your cart total, this code will be live for all of 2022.\n\nIf you’re not yet ready to take the plunge there are several taster packs that you can check out for free today, including for the first fully featured pack “Driving Techno Essentials” - this really is a high quality sample pack! It has all the necessary building blocks needed for any sub-genre of techno. There’s an abundance of one shots, kick and rumble loops, ride loops, top loops etc. Further to this there is a dozens of lead, bass and pad loops that even have the exact MIDI used to create them. This is really great if you want to quickly access the notes for layering up with your own synth, or maybe get the route notes of a lead to create a bass lines, top work ZA on that one! There is even an Ableton Live template included in the pack which show’s off beautifully just some ways that the samples can be utilised. This also give great insight for new producers of how to organise, mix and master you Live sessions.\n\nWhat’s more is that Zonal Audio have a unique opportunity for Decloak alumni by offering a stepping stone into the world of professional audio.

The fact they actually include presets in some of the sample packs is a great idea and definitely allows you to get more creative than just warping and chopping up samples, and both new and experienced producers can learn a lot from taking a deeper dive into the patches and processing chains used.\n\nCheck out ZonalAudio.com today and don’t forget to use the code “decloak20” for a juicy discount!\n\n#SAVEOURNIGHTLIFE - Manchester Area Producers Band Together To Help Local Venue\n\nThis week saw a massive release from Manchester and North West based producers in aid of the local nightlife. With music venues being one of many industries struggling with COVID restrictions many community based projects have come up all around the country to help keep the doors open to those establishments without enough support to keep their doors open, and with lockdown easing seemingly just around the corner, a group of Manchester based house and minimal producers banded together to help one of Manchester oldest nightclubs, Stage & Radio.\n\nLocated on Port Street in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, the place has always held a special place in Decloak’s heart as it was right next door to our old studio on Hilton Street, so it was our local by default. Not only this but Decloak Music’s Jack was the Events Manager their for a year before lockdown happened, so getting involved in this project was a no brainer.\n\nBrought together by DJ and producer Kerouac and featuring local artists like KRS-two, Kerouac&SMILE, Adam Nahalawitz, Bokah, Notraab and a Brawther remix by Zweizig (all of whome have had something to do with Decloak along the way) the release is out now on Bandcamp.\n\nAll of the proceeds from the EP goes towards helping keep the doors of Stage & Radio open, so show some support and be ready to join us in the not so distant future in the basement of the venue for a good old knees up.\n\nBuy Here: https://savestageandradio.bandcamp.com/album/save-stage-radio-a-fundraising-va\n\nTo contribute to the Stage & Radio Crowd funder: https://bit.ly/39GCNy1\n\nDecloak Tutors and Clients Part of Massive Techno Release In Aide of Honduras Hurricane Effort\n\nIn a year of seemingly never ending struggle and strife the string of hurricanes that ripped through the Central American country of Honduras largely avoided any news time over in Europe. With Covid reigning supreme in regards to media attention a band of DJ’s, producers and record label owners from the nation decided to do something about it and help.\n\nThis small band has turned into an Army with a huge release now compiled by artist from around the world. Some of Decloak’s patrons are also involved, including J. Barton, Phil Denton, Renwick and Josh Reeves.\n\nIn total there are 35 tracks available for less than £17.\n\nCheck them out below and get it in your Christmas stocking!\n\nBLACK FRIDAY - 50% OFF ALL WEEK!\n\nThis year we are joining in with the commercial hype train that is Black Friday.

Seven years since the inception of Decloak Music Studio in the basement of this building it is time to part way. From floods, robberies, crumbling walls and even ghost sightings the place was a labour of pure, unadulterated love. Friends were made along with a mountain of music from many people who came through our doors.\n\nWe knew the writing was on the wall however. Recently the property was purchased by the owner of Boohoo.com, a business located around the corner from ours and one who has been redeveloping large parts of the city centre. Last month tenants of Marslboro House were served notice bringing to an end our time here over the past seven years. It is one of the final city centre bastions of independent, creative spaces, so the loss of the building is far greater than the loss of Decloak’s home.\n\nWe cannot thank enough everyone who has supported and believed in Decloak Music, and I can not thank enough those who have been that positive about the services they received it has meant I have barely had to run a single advert in four years - seriously, thank you!\n\nBut this is certainly not the end. Decloak will be continuing to help anyone looking for support in underground electronic music production. With the massive influx of online students over the past 6 months a larger amount of our focus has moved over to this format.\n\nDecloak Music and the services we offer lives on in the next chapter of the story and I look forward to giving more details on this in the next few weeks.\n\nMuch love,\n\nDecloak Music\n\nManchester Based Promoter and DJ ‘Renwick' Releases First of a String of Techno belters.\n\nOnce again we are celebrating a release from those involved with Decloak Music Studio.\n\nManchester based, Honduras born Renwick has been getting entirely stuck in to both the Manchester techno scene with his co-run club night, One Night Collective, and his mastering of the techno craft since he arrived in the city a few years back.\n\nHe started the club night One Night - Manchester Techno Sessions with fellow resident DJ Carlos Sousa and it has been building up support and respect amongst the locals, having played host to the likes of Manchester born, Berlin dwelling techno producer Setaoc Mass among others dedicated to playing the darker, heavier sides of techno.\n\nIn 2018 Renwick came to us at Decloak to get a helping hand on the production and Ableton Live front and it’s beginning to pay off with several of his new tracks being picked up over the past few months, with others bubbling away on his hard drive waiting to be unleashed.\n\nThe most recent is a collaboration with Decloak Music’s Jack Barton and is part of a large VA celebrating 4 years of Solemn Records.\n\nTheir track titled ’String Theory’ is a trippy, rolling number and is the first of a series of collaborations by the two.\n\nYou can check the track out below, along with the other tracks on the VA.\n\nDirect Link: https://solemnerecords.bandcamp.com/track/barton-renwick-string-theory?fbclid=IwAR3cZakKl4XSQWY8Vu6AkqT5uP9J8fo09IwqO3m5FWGEBXXjsF2q7bn8uK0\n\nFurther releases coming for the pair include a VA on Illegal Alien Records which will be announced soon. In the meantime you can check out the live jam for Decloak Jams they did a few months back!\n\nOne Night Collective Podcast Series w/ Phil Denton\n\nOne Night Collective is an event, podcast series and soon to be record label run by former Decloak student, Renwick. Having also featured another Decloak alumni in the form of a belting mix from Josh Reeves, this instalment sees Phil Denton lay down a heavy slab of his trademark hard hitting techno.\n\nThe mix features unreleased tracks from Phil’s production alias, Zonal, as well as one from One Night label boss Renwick called “To Follow The Worms”. This track was mastered at Decloak studios so we have had a nice sneak preview, and we expect it to be big when it drops!\n\nThe mix also includes tracks from artists such as Eric Axelsson, Keikari, Phara, Stef Mendesidis, Callum Plant, Vinicius Honorio, Michal Jablonski, Blawan and Berg Jaar. Labels featured include several British imprints such as Ear To Ground, Platform 22, Zeca Records and DeadCERT as well as plenty of tackle from over the water from the likes of Klokworks, Planet Rhythm, Subsist and RAW plus others.\n\nThis is a heavy mix that should help you forget about lockdown, whilst also evoking imagery of dark dirty basements, to large warehouses reappropriated for no-nonsense raving. We will be back on the dance floors soon! Enough chat about it now, take a listen for yourself…\n\nFollow One Night Collective on Facebook\n\nFollow Phil on Bandcamp, Instagram and Soundcloud\n\nFor more information on our Mixing & Mastering services click here, or for Ableton Lessons click here\n\nDecloak x MIF - Getting Started With Ableton Free Webinar\n\nDecloak x MIF - Ableton Live webinar for musicians and producers looking to keep creating during the pandemic\n\nRead More"
