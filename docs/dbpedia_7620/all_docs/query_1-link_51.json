[cheering] I look like-- yes, thank you, yeah. →\n\nI mean, it's expensive, but we can try it after the show. →\n\n[laughter] I feel like I look like that uncle that says that he coaches kids' soccer, but he actually just disposes of bodies in the lake. →\n\n[laughter] Or, what was it we're talking about earlier? Oh, I look like a youth pastor on the first night of camp. →\n\n[laughter] Do you guys ever do that? I used to do that. →\n\nI guess what I'm saying is, guess what I'm saying is, if you see someone dressed like me in the audience tonight, call the fucking police at once. →\n\nOkay, so we have a couple of little ground rules to go over. →\n\nIf you haven't been to a Critical Role live show before, welcome! It's fun. →\n\nIt's fun. →\n\nWe want you to have a good experience tonight. →\n\nWe want all the folks at home watching all around the world to have a good experience and on YouTube later and all that. →\n\nSo we ask a few things of you in attendance at this live show. →\n\nPlease don't shout anything out to the players or to each other during the show. →\n\nA lot of people think it's cool to be like, \"You forgot Hunter's Mark!\" from the 39th row. →\n\nI'm not going to have any of that shit tonight. →\n\nLet them make their own mistakes. →\n\nThat's my favorite part of the show. →\n\nNo need to correct anyone. →\n\nAlso, don't yell out anything you think might be funny. →\n\nTake it from someone who knows, there's nothing worse than bombing in front of 3,875 people. →\n\nThe only thing that you should yell during the show besides if there's a natural 20 or a natural one, or something that's actually, you know, happening is if there's a fire, you are welcome to yell. →\n\nWe just ask that you yell the word \"Fire,\" or maybe \"actual fire,\" yell \"actual fire.\" [laughter] That way we know it's an actual fucking fire and we don't end up with another Caleb's family situation. →\n\n[dismayed groaning] On our hands. →\n\n(laughs) You guys don't understand. →\n\nIf a room is 50% laughs and 50% groans, Taliesin adds five years to my life. →\n\n[cheering] (laughs) There's a reason they had me stand this far back, too. →\n\nThere is going to be a break. →\n\nSo we do ask that you try to keep your sitting and standing up to a minimum. →\n\nWe don't want to block anyone's view of Sam's hot pink crotch. →\n\n[laughter] Which is why you're all here this evening. →\n\nAnd last, but most important, don't forget to love each other. →\n\n[cheering] I know that they're serving booze to you filthy animals, and (laughs)-- I just want to say please be respectful of the Critters around you, especially if they're in cosplay. →\n\nThat can be kind of tricky. →\n\nJust be careful when you're getting up and be respectful. →\n\nDon't be the drunk guy who says shit and gets in a fight. →\n\nLet me do that. →\n\nIt's my favorite part of coming to these things. →\n\nAnd yeah, don't be an asshole is the bottom line. →\n\nThat's my job. →\n\nSo without further ado. →\n\n[cheering] I would like to introduce the cast of Critical Role. →\n\n[cheering] âª Role Critical Role âª âª Critical Role âª Laura Bailey! âª Critical Role âª âª Critical Role âª âª Critical Role âª âª The adventure begins âª âª They were always beside you âª →\n\nTaliesin Jaffe! âª And the DM to guide you âª âª And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead âª âª Villains beware âª →\n\nIt's Ashley Johnson!

Purple horseshoes! Green clover! World Anvil is compatible with (laughter) any RPG system and any setting from fantasy to sci-fi to hoity toity toity. →\n\n(laughter) I may kiss the Blarney Stone because they have a special promo for you Critters, 20% off all six or 12 month memberships when you use code CRITROLE to check out at worldanvil.com. →\n\nIt's a digital pot of gold! Ryanair, Frank McCourt, the Cranberries, Liam Neeson, Bono, World Anvil. →\n\n(laughter) [cheering] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat's the first time you took your hat off. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI... →\n\nI still love you. →\n\n(laughter) It's going to be okay. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nThank you, World Anvil, and thank you, Sam. →\n\nSecond sponsor tonight, our friends from the beginning of this campaign, D&D Beyond. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nâª D&D Beyond! âª [cheering] →\n\n# MATT\n\nThere you go, you've heard of them, cool. →\n\n(laughter) Thank you guys so much for continuing to support the show. →\n\nAnd once again, if you haven't checked them out yet, check them out at dndbeyond.link/criticalrole. →\n\nWe're nearing C2E2 this weekend. →\n\n[cheering] Which is kind of fantastic. →\n\nThose of you who are going to be there, we have a panel on Saturday at 11:00am on the main stage. →\n\nSuper stoked about that. →\n\nSo if you're going to come, please come see us. →\n\nI know we have some friends in the audience here from Rivals of Waterdeep as well. →\n\n[cheering] There we go, they're there. →\n\nIf you're there on this Sunday, they're also doing an awesome live show at noon in room S4O4, so definitely check them out if you guys get the chance. →\n\nThey're fantastic. →\n\nI think, let's see if we have any other announcements, Laura, you have an announcement? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, hi. →\n\nYeah, so there's no merch here tonight, but guess what, you guys, there's merch at C2E2, so if you don't have any-- [cheering] if you don't have some CR goodies, go to the C2E2 booth and there's going to be some there. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\n# MATT\n\nThere you go. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThank you for the encouragement, I really appreciate it. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll righty. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nThanks, babe. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nHeads up, too, for those at home, there will not be a Wyrmwood sweepstakes tonight during the break, so don't wait for it, but I'm sure they'll be back up real soon. →\n\nI think that's all of our announcements. →\n\nSo I think let's go ahead, [cheering] let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHello up there. →\n\n[cheering] (water bubbling) (explosion) âª Role Critical Role âª âª Critical Role âª âª Role!

[laughter] Here we are. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI'm assuming the butler's going to come in about three, two-- →\n\n# SAM\n\nOh shit. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\n-- one. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(quick footsteps) →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nSo close, you were was so close. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Hello, what's going on?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, hi. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nSorry. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHello. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, I figured it was that much. →\n\n[laughter] Need to be let out?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYes, please. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThat'd be nice. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"All right, come on downstairs.\" And the goblin rushes off, and leads you guys down the spiral staircase. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nSee, we don't need to let them know, he expects this now. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right, make your way down to the base of the tower. →\n\nThe door (creaking) opens on its own as you approach. →\n\nAnd you can see the sunlight now pouring through from the exterior of the midday, bright, coastal city of Nicodranas. →\n\nThe smell of sea spray and various coastal breezes pouring through. →\n\nYou can hear the sound of gulls off in the distance and the day is yours. →\n\nWhat would you like to do? →\n\n# AUDIENCE MEMBER\n\n(yelling) I love you, Taliesin! →\n\n# MATT\n\nThat's sweet, but remember what Brian said. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nI suppose we should go check on the ship unless, or I suppose you want to say hi to your mom? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWell, always, yes, but, yeah, we should check on the ship too. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, why don't we start at the ship, see what we are doing, when we can depart, and then finish up any business we have in here in town. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOkay. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nShould we start at the ship and then head to your mother's? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nSure. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAll right. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat way you can see your family. →\n\n# SAM\n\nYes, yes, we should. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOddly comforting to be back here. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYou okay, Nott? →\n\n# SAM\n\nI mean, I'm okay, yeah. →\n\nWe're near the water, so that's real fun. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI was thinking-- I was-- I thought it was way deeper, I'm sorry. →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo, no, you're not wrong. I, um, I've been doing a lot of thinking and I sort of promised Yeza that the next time I saw him it wouldn't be like this, so. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh. →\n\nDo you want do the spell before we go see your family? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, you set the timetable on that. →\n\nWe could do it on the ship. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI've been doing some meditating, you know. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWow!

(laughs) →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nThat's a strange place for a dog. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOh, you're a good boy. →\n\nI will call you Henry. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(snarling) →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nOh, the goodest of boys! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAre there any Dwendalian ships? →\n\n# MATT\n\nNumerous, actually. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOr sorry, not Dwendalian, Xhorhasian ships. →\n\n# MATT\n\nNo. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nNo, there are none. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat would be super bad. →\n\n# SAM\n\nHenry looks like a nice lunch. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI thought we were past that months ago. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI just, it's my last day, so... →\n\n[laughter] Just want that sweet, sweet dog flesh. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYeah, I actually know a very good dog recipes if that is what you want to be your last meal. →\n\n# SAM\n\nOh, really? Is it grilled or fried or? →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNo, we don't eat dogs in The Mighty Nein. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nWell, everything is a meal if you prepare it correctly. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh wow. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nIt's not entirely untrue. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI'd try it. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt is better than babies, though, I suppose. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nBabies are very tender. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhat f-- [laughter] I quickly walk over to one of the closest Zhelezo and say: Excuse me, if I might trouble you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yes, yes, what do you--\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nThat large ship over there, The Blue Heaven, I see.

[laughter] →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\n(coughing) [laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\n(repeated kissing) →\n\n# LAURA\n\nStop it with the mouth. →\n\nStop it, no stop it, no! Stop it! [laughter] Don't! →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nOh my god. →\n\n# SAM\n\nAre we getting banned on Twitch right now? →\n\nStop, Sam, please. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh, for the love of god. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI'm having the weirdest Planet of the Ape fantasy right now. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRight, to the Winds of Aeon. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAs you continue walking along the dock to the front of the ship, the first thing that greets you is about a half-dozen Righteous Brand soldiers that immediately begin to flank up at the front of the gang peak that leads onto the ship as you approach. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nI will reach into one of my satchels and pull out the symbol of the Bright Queen, but we'll keep it close. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNo. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNot the Bright Queen. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nTo the middle of my chest, flanked by both of my arms and just keep it in front. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAnd say we request an audience. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right. →\n\n# SAM\n\nDidn't we have a symbol from the Empire? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWe have a symbol from-- →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nI'm sorry, yes. →\n\nDid I say, I said the fucking Bright Queen. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYou did it, too! You did it, too! You fucking did it, too! →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nIt's my fault. →\n\n[laughter] It is contagious. →\n\n# MATT\n\nSo would you like to correct the symbol you've prepared? →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYes retcon. (imitating speaking backwards) →\n\n# MATT\n\nThere you go, okay. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, we would like to request a meeting with Martinet Da'leth and Master Ikithon, if they're present. →\n\n# MATT\n\nThey look at each other. →\n\nThe one that looks to be a little more decorated just goes forth and goes, \"And who might you be, if I could ask, please.\" →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWe're The Mighty Nein. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThey are expecting us. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWe're here as liaisons to the meeting. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I'll return momentarily. →\n\nDo not move or make any sort of aggressive actions, please.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWhat about just, like, dancing? Can we just dance? If our hands are down at our sides the whole time? [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nThey all check in with eye contact once more. →\n\n\"I think that would be allowed, ja.\" [laughter] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nAll right we'll be here. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Commence.\" [laughter] Turns around onto the ship. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWe're going to die. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou watch as the five other Righteous Brand soldiers stand there staring awkwardly and one of them starts to get into the groove, too. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nShut up! (laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nBefore the others notice and slap his arm and he's like, (throat clear) back into place. →\n\n# SAM\n\nThat's why they call them righteous. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nEventually the one returns and goes, \"You may step aboard,\" steps aside and you guys are able to step onto the gangplank, onto the Wind of Aeons. →\n\nThere, the ship deck is mostly clear, beautifully made, the inlay along the edges of the deck and the handles have a whether it's gold leafed or at least painted the look gold, it's garish in the way that you would expect from the Cerberus Assembly's singular ship that is so rarely used, that they have to make an impression when they do go to sea. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nGross. →\n\n# MATT\n\nWhich, to a certain extent, is probably a step down from those who can jump from place to place in the world without issue. →\n\nSo if they're going to do it, they have to do it in style. →\n\nBut there on the deck you see three figures in the middle of a conversation. →\n\nYou see Ludinus Da'leth, the older elven figure there in the middle of a conversation with two other individuals. →\n\nYou see a human male in maybe his late forties or so, in this long black robe with silver and blue detailing on it. →\n\nHe has this salt and pepper hair that's a little long and it's got this curl to it pushed to one side. →\n\nYou can see he's very much a mage who wants to put together a good impression in a social space. →\n\nMake a history check, both Beauregard and Caleb for me. →\n\n# LIAM\n\n16. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\n19. →\n\n# SAM\n\nOoh. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay. →\n\nCaleb, you know this from your studies and you as well would know from reading about it and some couple of, especially this individual. →\n\nThis is Lord Athesius Uludan. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\nWho is the arch mage of Diplomatic Union. →\n\nIt is the member of the Cerberus Assembly that largely goes out as the ambassador of the Assembly to foreign powers and foreign interests and noble circles that are beyond the Empire, or even within the Empire that needs some smoothing over. →\n\nYou could already see in the way that he's talking to the Martinet, there's, like, a half-cocked grin to his expression and very much a practiced, very smooth, tailored persona to a social charismatic and persuasive interaction. →\n\nThe third individual you see looks to be another male elf, though younger, pale skin and silver and teal robes. →\n\nThe hair is a faint, dirty blonde and very short coming to a point in the front. →\n\nNeither of you recognize this figure, but this figure seems to be engaged in conversation. →\n\nAs they're all talking, the Martinet notices you as you step aboard and goes, \"Oh, hello so glad you could make it?\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYou were expecting us to be here, were you not? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, you discussed the possibility of joining, so, welcome. Hmm. →\n\nI'm sorry, my manners. →\n\nThis is Lord Athesius Uludan,\" who bows and goes, (light French accent) \"It is a pleasure to meet all of you. →\n\nWhat is your name?\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nWe're The Mighty Nein. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Mighty Nein.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nWe're a band of heroes who has set out to save the world and we're darn tootin' nearly done. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, that is mighty impressive. →\n\nI am extremely humbled by your presence.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nI think we've heard of you, actually. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Really? I did not know that my name got around in the goblin circles. →\n\nThis is very exciting.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nYeah, we talk. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, whoever cares, tells them that I say hello.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWe are less familiar with your friend over here. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"This is a Lord Dezran Thain,\" and he points over and the other figure, that one figure, steps forward and goes, \"My apologies for not introducing myself. →\n\nI am just one of the lords of here in Nicodranas and I'm meeting with some friends in preparation for the journey ahead.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWould I recognize him them? →\n\n# MATT\n\nMake a history check. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nâª Has he been to your mom's house âª [laughter] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nâª Has he done a lot of fucking âª Just five. →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou do not recognize this person at all. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI don't recognize him. →\n\nIt's been a couple years, you know, so... →\n\nHas it been? I don't know how long it's been. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nIt's been years. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nâª It's been... âª →\n\n# MATT\n\nDon't. →\n\n[laughter] Caduceus and Caleb, this elven figure does seem a bit nervous in your presence upon meeting. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIs he bullshitting us? →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou don't know. →\n\nThe person immediately seems to be like, like when you approached the expression was like, what the? (as Dezran Thain) \"But nevertheless, it is a pleasure to meet you, Mighty Nein. →\n\nI apologize. I must be off,\" and the Martinet says-- →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nAre you going to be joining us for the voyage? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"No, I will be staying here with my home in Nicodranas, but I wish you all luck on the journey, Have a good day.\" →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHow do you get your hair so pointy? →\n\n# MATT\n\nAnd as he casts Prestidigitation, you watch the hair continue to find a majestic spire seemingly almost pointing southward. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWhile Yasha does that and he's distracted, can I case him a little bit? Can I do, like, a once over? →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, what are you trying to discern? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI want to discern... →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHow firm is buttocks are? [laughter] →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nButtress. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI want to see if he's hiding anything on his belt. →\n\nIf he looks like he has any papers or anything. →\n\n# MATT\n\nSure, go ahead. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nA weapon or something like that. →\n\n# MATT\n\nGo ahead and make a perception check for me. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'm going to look at his butt while she's doing that. →\n\n# MATT\n\nMake a perception check for me. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRoll better. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nBalls. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRoll better. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nBalls eater! →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRoll better. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nEight. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nEight! →\n\n# MATT\n\nOh-oh. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nEight. →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou both find the butt. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI just look at Jester. →\n\n# MATT\n\nIt's not a bad butt, but that's about all you discern. →\n\nThe Martinet goes, \"Of course, Dezran, we will see you tomorrow. →\n\nWhen is the actual event happening, if you don't mind me requesting? And the Lord Athesius goes, Oh yes, actually, if you're interested in coming at all, there is an event, a party that is to happen. →\n\nThis is in two nights from now before we head out, if you're interested. →\n\nWe'd love to have such esteemed individuals who are saving the world around here and the Martinet has spoken of you, I believe, previously. →\n\nSo if you'd like to come the actual information regarding this is at the Marquis Zaif's Demesne,\" which you know. →\n\nThat's the Marquis of Nicodranas. →\n\nHis demesne is this small palace in the Opal Archways. →\n\nThat's not far from where your mother works. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, yeah, that's, like, a really fancy house. →\n\n# MATT\n\nIt's super fancy and it's where largely all the major diplomatic events and parties happen within Nicodranas and where a lot of the political business between the Empire and the Concord tend to happen at Zaif's home. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, I think Mama got asked to perform there one time at a party, but she didn't end up accepting. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhy not? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShe didn't want to-- →\n\n# MATT\n\n(as Lord Athesius) \"Who is your mother, then?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThe Ruby of Sea. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nInsight check, what was that look? →\n\n# MATT\n\nMake an insight check. →\n\n[laughter, cheering] →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\n23. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWhoa. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWoo! →\n\n# MATT\n\nThat is a look of immediate recognition and then a person immediately falling into a series of fond memories. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nOkay. →\n\n# SAM\n\nOoh. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I am quite familiar with your mother. →\n\n[laughter] She is a brilliant performer and I'm-- She was never, I believe, denied an invitation.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, no, no, she was asked to go, she just was unable to attend. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Then I apologize that our personage does not meet her standard.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNot at all, no. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Beyond myself, of course.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShe was very ill and so she wasn't able to leave at that time. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, if she would like to come and perform perhaps for this event that my cousin is holding, that would be wonderful.\" →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNo, Jester's just being nice. →\n\nIt's about the standards. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, it's not, no! [laughter] It's really not. →\n\nNo, my mama, she-- →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, I'm not offended. My cousin is a dead dog, but, I mean, I've been by the Chateau myself a number of times. →\n\nShe is a wonderful woman. →\n\nIt is a pleasure to meet you.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYou too. →\n\n# MATT\n\nGives you a kiss on the fingers. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHow far are we from the docks where we are? →\n\n# MATT\n\nOh, you guys are, like, out on the wharf docks themselves, and you're on the ship as it's set there in the harbor. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAre we close-ish from where we are to the docks? →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou're, I'd say walking on the docks, you're probably a good 80 or so to a hundred feet away from the shore. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAway from the shore. →\n\nBut are we onboard the boat or are we-- →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou're on the deck of the boat. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOkay. →\n\nWould I be able to summon Frumpkin the monkey on the docks, not on the boat, maybe behind some schmutz there? →\n\nSure. →\n\nAs you begin, I assume there's somatic components to this as well as verbal. →\n\nYeah well, summoning him for the first time, but I don't know about bringing him in and out. →\n\n# MATT\n\nJust an action? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\nIf you just bamfed him out and then I'd say you're fine. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nSo yeah, you can definitely do that. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOkay, so he is sitting behind a crate or some other sort of shipping stuff on the dock. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right. →\n\nLudinus looks towards Dezran and goes, \"Actually, Dezran, if we could have a conversation before you leave, that would be wonderful. →\n\nAnd if you will attend, I think that would be a glorious event to introduce you to some of the more important figures that are going to be part of this negotiation, as well as the local society here in Nicodranas.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThat is an excellent idea. →\n\nWe want to become more familiar with each other before we set out. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Of course.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWe are going to be working together. →\n\nIt is going to be wonderful. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"What is your means of transportation? I apologize there is not room for more passengers.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, we've got our own ship. It's really fancy. →\n\nDon't you worry about us. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"All right. If I might have the name of the ship to ensure that is\" [laughter] \"approval from the Wharfmaster.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nWe traveled by ball. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nCaptain, would you-- you can introduce your ship. →\n\nI know it's a place of great pride for you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"You're the captain of the ship? Oh, so you've traveled the Lucidian Ocean quite a bit, I see. Impressive.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYep. Yeah. →\n\nGrand vessel by the name of the Ball-- (mumbling) [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll three of them look at each other. →\n\n\"I'm terribly sorry, I did not catch that. →\n\nWhat was the name again?\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh, I'm so sorry it was the Ball-- [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I'm afraid you're sneezing mid-sentence. →\n\nI'm not catching the final--\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\n(loudly) The Balleater. →\n\n(laughter) [cheering] →\n\n# MATT\n\nThe silence hangs. →\n\n[laughter] As a gentle ocean wind blows through. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nA wind of Aeons, maybe? [laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nMartinet, there is no man alive who knows more about the sea and ships specifically than this man before you. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYou should quiz him. →\n\n(laughter) [laughter] The sailing terms that he knows is really spectacular. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYou know what, I think I ate something that disagreed with me. →\n\nI'm going to just-- If you don't-- Pardon me. And I walk off the ship. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nLord Athesius follows you and goes, \"Do not worry, friends, but please do come. →\n\nIt would be a pleasure to have you and to introduce you to the delights of Nicodranas.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI would love to to do a party. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Wonderful.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nTwo nights from now, then? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yes, tomorrow night.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nTomorrow night?!

Ehh. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat makes sense. →\n\n# SAM\n\nNot really. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nDo we just show up or are we on the list? Do we need to bring an invite or what? How does-- →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I'll go ahead and ensures that the doorman is aware of your arrival and what to look for.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Dress nicely, please.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNow is probably a good time to state that the Bright Queen, who we are here on behalf of, has requested that we inspect the artifact in question before setting sail to make sure that it is intact. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(as Ludinus) \"That can certainly be arranged.\" Caduceus, you notice that Dezran's eyes dart back and forth a bit. →\n\n\"Certainly. Immediately before the end of the voyage, we'll be happy to allow you a moment to inspect the artifact.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI was hoping to look at it maybe before the party. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Perhaps tomorrow midday?\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nFair enough. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWhy can't we look at it now? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"It's not currently on this ship and it's in the process of being prepared for the journey.\" →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nBefore we set sail at the very least. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Not to worry. →\n\nIt'll be provided, I promise.\" →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nAll right. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"All right, well good luck. →\n\nEnjoy your preparation and safe voyage to all of you.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nCan I insight check him based on what he said about preparing it and not being on the ship and all that shit. →\n\n# MATT\n\nSure, go ahead and make an insight check. →\n\n# SAM\n\nCome on, come on. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nGet it, girl. →\n\n(squealing) Oh, that's five. →\n\nOkay, 13. →\n\n# MATT\n\n13. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\n2013. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n2013. →\n\n# MATT\n\nMuch better year. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# LIAM, MATT\n\n(resigned sigh) →\n\n# MATT\n\nLong for the simpler days. →\n\nSo, yes, he seems upfront and honest as best as you can tell. →\n\nHe's hard to read in general, but there's no signs of any sort of deviousness or deception. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nBut \"Enjoy and if you require anything, I believe you can just let me know,\" and looks towards you, Jester. →\n\n# SAM\n\nToodles. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nMost gracious. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Dezran,\" and the two of them leave below deck. →\n\nWhat would you like to do? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWhere did Thain go? Thain went below deck with the Martinet. →\n\nAll right. →\n\nWhile we're standing there, I telepathically tell Frumpkin to keep an eye on the boat and keep an eye out for Thain and to follow Thain around town. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nDoes this boat have, like, porthole windows or anything like that? →\n\n# MATT\n\nIt looks like there are a few wooden, window elements for a gun deck, though you're unsure if it's outfitted. →\n\nThey are currently closed, but they are currently designed to be opened. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI don't want to be in earshot. →\n\nSo as we step away, I don't want to be by guards. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, so you move a bit past the guards and you're now back onto the dock. →\n\nProbably a good 40, 50 feet from where they were standing. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nCaleb. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI want to know that conversation. →\n\nI want to know what's being said. →\n\nThink you can get Frumpkin in there? Or at least over in these canon docks over there. →\n\nYou see what I'm, here look at my eye line. →\n\nLook down, you see that? And you see how there might be, like, a little opening that maybe Frumpkin can get in. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, my cat could probably climb over there and open it up with his little cat monkey paws. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's got little monkey hands, yeah. →\n\nI want to know what's being said, man. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nIs it a cat or a monkey? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt's a cat. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHe's just in the shape of a monkey. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's a Frumpkey. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nWhat? [laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nCan you do it? →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(laughter) Yeah. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAll right, well, let's get away from the boat. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAll right. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHey, Caleb. →\n\nI step away from the rest of the group and whisper to Caleb. →\n\nYou know what you could do? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWhat? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYou could let Nott eat Frumpkin tonight. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThat's a lot to process. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nJust because, you know, you can bring him back really easy and Nott what they really appreciate getting to eat a monkey. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI mean, just from a flavor and culinary angle, I am not sure he tastes the way Nott is accustomed cat tasting. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWell, I remember you saying that Nott used to try to eat Frumpkin all the time. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, but she was never satisfied. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYeah, and also there's not much to eat, right? I mean, Frumpkin doesn't have that much health. →\n\nYou just take a bite and it's like, (poofing) →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat's true. →\n\nThat's a good point, Fjord. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nMy cat is as healthy as any fucking cat in the Empire or Nicodranas or anywhere. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYou want to test that? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWell, he's not a tarrasque, but for cats, he's pretty good. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nCan you get your monkey cat into the cannon? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHe's already going. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nTo hear this-- Okay. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSo I've told Frumpkin to try to, monkey along underneath the gangplank and try to find his way over to the porthole. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nCan we be walking away at the same time as these shenanigans? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nSo we're not staring at the boat as it's happening. →\n\n# MATT\n\nCompletely inconspicuously slow walking away. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah just, Jester, tie your shoe about 90 feet away from the side of the boat. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay, tell me when. →\n\nIs this 90 feet? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNow. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nIs anybody watching us or following us, or are we being... →\n\n# MATT\n\nNo. I mean, the guards are watching you leave, but they're not, like, intensely casing you. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nAnybody even just following us. →\n\nJust, I want to keep an eye on for a tail the next hour. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, keeping an eye out, no worries. →\n\nOkay, if you could go ahead and roll a stealth check for Frumpkin, as a monkey. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nCome on. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nCome on. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nFrumpkin always fucks it up. →\n\nOoh, good! Oh, okay, I've got a baboon prepped for Frumpkin. →\n\nHold on. →\n\n# MATT\n\nThe stealthiest of creature. →\n\n# LIAM\n\n18. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nHey! →\n\n# MATT\n\nThat's great! →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThat's okay. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHe's actually a baboon?! I thought he was, like, a teeny tiny little spider monkey. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI just searched 5e monkey on Google. →\n\nThat's what they taught me at Soltryce Academy. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat huge, Caleb, a baboon is a really big. →\n\n# MATT\n\nWell, he's using the stats for the baboon. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWell, I rolled 16. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAnd baboon says plus two. So go with it, okay? →\n\n# MATT\n\nThe Righteous Brand unaware, you can sense Frumpkin complete the journey beneath the gangplank, onto the edge of the ship and then grasping onto the rougher edges of the outside of the actual ship hull, make his way to the edge of one of the gunship portholes, slowly open it, and slip barely inside. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI put my arm on Beauregard's shoulder and say: Just look at the ocean, it is so beautiful. (whooshing) →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWhat a beautiful sight to behold. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nSo gorgeous. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWow. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSo blue. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nTake it all in. →\n\n(whispering) What's he saying, can you hear anything? →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, so as-- →\n\n# LIAM\n\nDon't forget that I cannot hear anything, so if you try to talk to me I can't hear you. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, this'll be interesting. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOh, fuck. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nFocusing through Frumpkin eyes, you look into the interior of this darkened gun deck of the ship. →\n\nThere are two cannons within there as opposed, it looks like it was built for multiple canons, but there's only two in there very beautiful make, and immediately just at a glance, you can see these are not standard cannonball based canons. →\n\nThese are arcane in nature, and who knows what they're capable of when fired. →\n\nIt is very dark and you watch two figures waltz in with haste. →\n\nYou hear one voice, Ludinus, say \"I couldn't help but gauge your discomfort with the conversation.\" And the other figure goes, \"Well, I just wasn't expecting to see them.\" And Ludinus goes, \"Shh, hold on,\" does some hand motions. →\n\nAs he releases a simple spell, there's this faint shockwave, (explosion) that dissipates within a radius of them. →\n\nUncertain what it does. Though you gather, in the moment, that it's probably some sort of a radial dispel to lock down or destroy any localized magic. →\n\nHowever, the illusion around Lord Dezran Thain vanishes. →\n\n(gasping) and there standing in his place is a gently floating male drow with short hair. →\n\n[shocked noises] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNo. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasping) →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's the traitor? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHe's the tra-- →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's a mole? →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nShh, shh, shh. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nSo blue, so beautiful. →\n\n[laughter] Look at it, the waves are so beautiful. →\n\n# MATT\n\nTo which the revealed Essek responds. →\n\n(shocked gasping) [screaming] →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nNo. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nBuddy, don't! →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Of course I'm uncomfortable with this. →\n\nI did not know they were going to be coming directly here.\" And you can see, there's conflict in his eyes, and Ludinus goes, \"I understand, but it's extremely important how we enforce and oversee the control and the exchange of the prisoners and the delivery of the beacon.\" Essek thinks for a second, \"I agree.\" Ludinus goes, \"We each have what we want. →\n\nAnd when this business is behind us, we need not interact ever again. →\n\nThe Assembly will share its research per the deal and beyond and we never have to speak.\" And Essek sits and thinks for a second and goes, \"I look forward to never seeing your face again, but we're too far in at this point. →\n\nIt's taken a lot of effort to ensure the tracks have been covered and no one undeserving was hurt. →\n\nBut I want no other part in this once this is done.\" Ludinus steps forward and goes, \"I'm surprised to see such affection from such a previously cold individual.\" And Essek turns his glance away and goes, \"Well, I am surprised myself. →\n\nMaybe you should try friends sometime.\" [awwing] →\n\n# SAM\n\nIt's going to feel real bad when we kill him. →\n\n(laughter) (laughter) (laughter) (laughter) (laughter) (laughter) →\n\n# MATT\n\nLudinus goes, \"Hold it together for time being. →\n\nWe cannot have you mysteriously disappearing with that poor attempt at hiding your discomfort earlier. →\n\nDo your part, all right?\" and Essek nods. →\n\n\"(as Essek) (sighing) I hate parties,\" and turns around and you watch as the illusion takes over once more as his feet touch the ground and heads back out to the deck of the ship. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nMan, look at the seagulls. →\n\n[laughter] Just the pinnacle of beauty they are. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYou know what you're saying is actually worse than if you were just commenting on the ocean, making more suspicious. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThese are genuine comments. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSo if Frumpkin peeks back out of the porthole that he crawled into, is this... →\n\nfriend of ours leaving the ship? →\n\n# MATT\n\nYes. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI send Frumpkin to follow him at a distance. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right. →\n\nAs you guys are walking away from the docks, you hear the footfalls quickly approaching of the Lord Dezran Thain, who gives a nod. →\n\n\"(throat clear) Hello.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, hey again. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nHey. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Have a good day and--\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nSee you at the party. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nSee you tomorrow night. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yes, indeed see you then.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nPleasure meeting you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"You as well (throat clear),\" and continues on past you with a hurried pace. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nIf you feel like visiting the Lavish Chateau, you can go there and see my mama perform. →\n\n# MATT\n\nNo response. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWell? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nSo are we walking now or definitely away from-- →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYep, no, let's walk and talk. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nSo, I don't normally say this, but man, I have not seen such an untrustworthy group of people as far as I can remember. →\n\nThere were some shifty people on there. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh god, I thought you were talking about us for one second. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nI mean, normally that'd be fair, but yeah. →\n\nThat was, everybody was very nervous. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYou know, perhaps it would be a good time to stop back at the Balleater. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAll right. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nBack to the ship now? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nDid you get something? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI just have a hankering to examine the ship top to bottom. →\n\nMake sure that it's in working order. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAll right. →\n\n# SAM\n\nSure. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAll right, let's go inspect the ship again? We'll head back to the Balleater. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right, you guys make your way back to the Balleater and you see Marius LePual is there in the process of tying one of the sails back up onto the main mast and glances over and goes, \"Ah, back so soon?\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nHave you killed anyone yet? [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"(sighs)\" He grudgingly begins to pull a shortsword. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWell, speak to Yasha, she's very disappointed. →\n\nWe'll be a below decks if you need us. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, the captain would like to inspect his quarters. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Of course, of course. →\n\nI was just kidding about the shortsword. →\n\nYou're kidding about the killing part, right?\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nDo I look like, I'm kidding? →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYou had, like, 20 whole minutes. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Aye aye, captain.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nBetter get ready for the week, Marius. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Whoa, okay, Mighty Nein's back.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAnd Marius? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yes?\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nDon't get caught. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"You're hazing me, right, like, you're not serious.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOf course not. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Aw. (relieved chuckling)\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYeah, we're serious. →\n\nNo, we're not serious. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I'm going to get a drink,\" and he just heads right into the Restless Wharf. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nOh man. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nBelow decks? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right, you find your guys' way. →\n\nYou head down the gun deck where there's the cargo hold below, which is where a lot of the bedrooms are as well. →\n\nThere's bedrooms on both ends. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nLooks like everything's in order. →\n\nWhat did you want to inspect? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nShut the door, please. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nShut the door. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShould we check and make sure nobody-- →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI want to make sure no one's following us along the-- →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHey, Fjord maybe you can do your thing where you can see if there's little orbs following us. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh, yes, good point. →\n\nI'll summon the Star Razor, and I will cast See Invisibility. →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou got it, all right. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nDo I see anything? →\n\n# MATT\n\nGlancing around the interior of the chamber right now, you do not see any sort of a scrying bauble or glowing orb that would lead you to believe you're being scryed upon. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nGod, there are orbs everywhere. →\n\n[Laughter] →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasps) →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWe're in terrible danger. →\n\nNo, I'm shitting you, we're fine. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nCaleb starts putting it necklace back under his shirt. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWhat'd you hear? What'd you see? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nDezran Thain, he is actually our good friend, Essek Thelyss. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhat do you mean is? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nHe's working for-- →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt is a disguise. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nBut he was walking. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nIt's kind of a brilliant disguise, if you think about it. →\n\n[laughter] Always looking at the guy's feet. I've never really... →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAre you sure? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI elaborate and recount everything. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHoly shit! [Laughter] Oof! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI mean, it oddly makes a lot of sense. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nDoes he-- oh! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWhen you look back at everything. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nAnd he said we were friends. →\n\n[awwing] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHard to read. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh! →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHard to read. →\n\n# SAM\n\nBut to what end? What is he trying to gain out of this? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nResearch was mentioned. →\n\nI don't entirely understand the context. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYou mentioned an exchange. →\n\nIt sounded like the beacon for, did you say prisoners? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nWell, we know there's a prisoner exchange. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nThat was part of the deal always. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nSure. →\n\n# SAM\n\nBut it seems like the beacon is-- is either not what it appears to be, or it's going to into Essek's hand instead of the hands of the queen. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, but Essek is probably the one that delivered it. →\n\nHe's the guy that leaked the beacons in the first place. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAll bells are ringing. →\n\nEvery fear we have seems to be coming true. →\n\nThis is some sort of ploy. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWell, we just need to ask him. →\n\n# SAM\n\nUh. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI mean, why not? You know, he really like us. →\n\nHe could probably tell us the truth once we know. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThis is going to be a very weird party. →\n\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nCaleb, how do you feel? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI feel like a fool. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhy, because he didn't loop us in? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNo, I worried about him for ages, thinking that he was perhaps the mole we were worried about and when I finally did away with that fear, I had it confirmed. →\n\nHe seemed somewhat conflicted, but not enough to slow his pursuit. →\n\nMaybe sense could be talked to him, but I worry that if we confront him, or stop, whatever they're doing-- →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasping) Oh my god, you know what we could do? I have the perfect plan. →\n\nLet's go to the party and while we're there and he's, like, kind of around, we can talk about Essek. →\n\n[laughter] And we'll just, you know, we'll just be, like, talking about, \"Oh my gosh, you know who I wish was here, is Essek. →\n\nI love him so much I'm so glad that we're such good friends with him now. →\n\nI never knew that anyone could be so wonderful.\" You know? →\n\n# SAM\n\nAnd then after a few moments, he'll say, \"It's me, I'm Essek!\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, yeah! →\n\n# SAM\n\n\"I can't take it anymore, the guilt is too much.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nEither one, he'll feel really guilty, or number two, he'll want to take credit for it all, because he's so wonderful. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nMaybe. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI think it's a really good idea. →\n\n# SAM\n\nWell, we definitely need to go to this party and see what else we can find. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nTail him or investigate him or knock him out or something. →\n\nDo we have any poison, can we poison him? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWell, if we remove him from the equation. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNone of this happens. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNone of this happens. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's integral to this entire thing. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nBut he said he wasn't even coming, I mean, he was another guy, but... →\n\n# SAM\n\nFjord could disguise himself as Dezran Thain. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhoa, uh... →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah! [laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nAnd then we'd have a mole on the ship. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, oh my god, that's really good. →\n\n# SAM\n\nWe take out Essek, and we replace him with one of us. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, and Martinet already knows that there's an illusion, so he would be like, \"Oh, I see that's it an illusion.\" But he would not realize it's another person in the illusion. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nExcept that the other person would be in the same room. →\n\nI mean, then he would definitely know it was an illusion. →\n\nIf I'm doing my math right, there's-- →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo, we take out the Essek. →\n\nWe're going to knock him out with some sort of poison. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nAnd Essek isn't at the meeting, then? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWhat? →\n\n# SAM\n\nFjord is. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWell, Fjord would be Essek as Deylas Thain. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWow. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nThis is complicated. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAs not bad of a plan as that is-- wait, wait, wait. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhat?! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWe do not have near enough information for any of that to be pulled off smoothly. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThat is true. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nGood point. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThat is true. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAnd we are also dealing with the most intelligent, ruthless and cunning practitioners of the arcane in all of the Empire. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nUgh. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nI don't think he's talking about us. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, I know. I forgot to ask Martinet If he wanted a tattoo. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nThat-- That is unfortunate. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThat sounds like party chitchat to me. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOkay so, tomorrow night, before we weigh doing any of this crazy bullshit, we have a night to prepare. →\n\nNott, do you still want to go forward with your-- →\n\n# SAM\n\nI mean, I'm a little distracted now that we've been betrayed. →\n\nAlso ,Essek is the one who gave us this, who helped unlock the secret of this spell? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI mean, we can-- →\n\n# SAM\n\nIs it a bad thing? →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasping) I got a really good idea. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh no. →\n\nDoes it involves tattoos? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo. Oh my god. (excited noise) While we're around Dezran Thain I'm going to send a message to Essek. →\n\n[laughter] [cheering] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThat's so Cheaters of you. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nThat's pretty good. →\n\n# SAM\n\nThat's amazing. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nIt's not bad. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nIt's actually a very good idea. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nIt's pretty good. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHey, Jester. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYes. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYour tattoos. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHow much did Orly teach you about making, like, enchanted tattoos? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, well. →\n\nHe started to-- →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nMm-hmm. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n-- and then I think I remember noticing how many wrinkles were on his neck [laughter] and I couldn't tell, like, where it goes when his head goes in there, does it come, I don't know I just got, I remember not hearing what he was saying. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWhat did he say, Nott? [laughter] →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nAh! Ha! →\n\n# LAURA, TALIESIN\n\nThat was good. →\n\n# SAM\n\nGood one. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWait, I'm confused. →\n\nSo we're betrayed because Essek is going to take the beacon back to the Dynasty. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWe don't know enough. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAnd then the Empire is going to get their prisoners. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo he-- oh. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRight? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe said he wanted the research. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAnd the beacon. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nRemember when he came over and we pressured him into getting into the hot tub? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAnd we like, bonded. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe was talking about his pursuits and about he how badly he wants to see how far he can take dunamancy. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAnd how far he could reach beyond what is sanctioned or structured within the Empire or within the Dynasty, I mean. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeah, and we know the Empire has been monkeying around with it, yeah? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSo perhaps Essek is trying to learn more about their own artifact from the Empire, what the Empire has twisted it into. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nMaybe, oh man, maybe. →\n\nI mean, in theory there's a second beacon. →\n\nMaybe he knows and do we know for sure if those prisoners were executed back when we were-- →\n\n# LAURA\n\nLike, his friends? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nYeah, I mean, we don't really know, do we? There could be second deal. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWell, if they're exchanging the prisoners, the prisoners are high-ranking members of the Assembly and the Empire. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nMaybe this is just another deal. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nIt is another deal. →\n\nThat's exactly what it is. →\n\nBut if you put it under the guise of a prisoner exchange, it becomes acceptable. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nRight, but we trust Essek. →\n\nWe have to at least give him the opportunity to fail, right? I mean, he might be altruistic. →\n\nHe might be doing this for good reasons. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nOr at least given the opportunity to explain himself and then maybe give us the opportunity to-- →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nKill him. →\n\n[Laughter] What? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nOr cover and try and help make sure that everything goes well for everybody. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nThat's what I meant, I just said it in a different way. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nI mean, I respect the initiative. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI see it as a choice between: Are we going to confront Essek before this journey, or just tag along in the journey and hope to learn more. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nBut he said he wasn't coming. →\n\nI mean, he said Lord Thain wasn't coming on the journey. →\n\n# SAM\n\nHe's clearly coming. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHe's coming. →\n\nHe wouldn't be here if he wasn't coming. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nHe'll be in the other boat, I imagine. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHe could maybe be disguised as someone else. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nAbsolutely. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nAll we know is that there is a lot we do not know. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nAnd we can't endanger him at this party and that's not the opportunity of to confront him. →\n\nIt should be some other time. →\n\nWe don't want to put him in danger if his intentions are... →\n\ngood. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHe did say we were friends. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nIf his intentions are good, then why is he hiding it? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt's possible he is playing your home country. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nIt's also possible, you know, that he thinks we're kind of fuck-ups and we might ruin his plan if we knew about it. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI just worry if we confront him or take him out of the picture, all of this deal will fall on its face. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNo, we have to let him go. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nIntentions and actions are rarely connected. →\n\nThey're distant cousins. →\n\nI mean, it's true. →\n\nThink about everybody here. →\n\nThis is a whole group of people with, I mean, I'll just say it, we have some issues. →\n\n[laughter] [laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nAll right, we're going to this party. →\n\nWe can learn more there possibly. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nIn the meantime, let's go see your mom. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nI offer gems, I offer clay. →\n\n# SAM\n\nYou what? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nI offer gems, I offered clay. →\n\nEveryone keep their eyes open. →\n\n# SAM\n\nOkay, all right, all right. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWe should do this. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasps) Oh my gosh. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThis is important. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'm a sapphire, you're Caduceus Clay. →\n\nWe already found them. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nSo I just have to grind you guys up and lie down in you? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nThat'll work. →\n\n# SAM\n\nCool. →\n\n# MATT\n\nThat's wonderfully poetic and not intentional at all. →\n\nI love that. →\n\nSo you guys head back into the Opal Archways. →\n\nYou pass through the market on the way. →\n\nIt's easy enough for you to gather numerous gems, or you can get a singular gem for the cost of 150 or a little higher than that. →\n\nAnd with your jeweler's kit, you can crush it down. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSo we need to purchase? →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou do. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWe don't have it? →\n\n# MATT\n\nUnless you have a gem that you want to try and crush down that's worth 150. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, I want to keep the gems that we have. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI would prefer to buy these gems. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. →\n\nWe'll make them really colorful. →\n\n# SAM\n\nSure, yeah. →\n\n# LAURA, MATT\n\nOkay. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nJust a bunch of little ones, all different colors. →\n\nSo it's like fun glitter on Beau right now. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay. →\n\nThere are a number of individuals who who work in pottery and various clay-based decor, so you can acquire, relatively cheaply, about the 50 pounds of clay that you require. →\n\nJust the equal amount of physical body weight to roughly what Nott is in goblin. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nYeah, how much will that run? →\n\n# MATT\n\nFor 50 pounds of clay, I'd put it at, like, maybe gold and a half. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nWow. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nI can carry it. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nSo can I, no big deal. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYeah, me too. Fuck. →\n\nNow it's only, like, 15 pounds each, that's not cool. →\n\nYou can have it. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNo, I don't-- oh. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nFjord, I can carry it for you if it's too heavy. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNot a problem. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYou look like you've gotten shorter because of the weight. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNo, it's my casual way of walking. →\n\nThis means I don't care. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThat's pretty good, actually. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nIt's working. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nIs it? →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYeah. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nI feel like I have to fart. →\n\n(laughter) →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOn that, I run up to Jester. →\n\nHey, that tattoo thing. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh yeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOkay, I have a weird question. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay, I like weird questions! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nSometimes when you go to these, like, fancy upper echelon parties-- →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\n-- there's a tattoo artist there giving out free tattoos and after, like, a few drinks, people are like, \"I think I do want a tattoo.\" If you tattoo someone, can you then scry on that tattoo? Is that like, since it's using ink and stuff? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI mean, I would have intimate knowledge of something on their body, so yeah, I probably could scry pretty easy. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWhat if we just pick up some henna? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI think it works better if it's, like, permanent. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nWait, what do you mean you'll have intimate knowledge of their body? Did I, sorry, am I misunderstanding what you said? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'm not saying I sleep with people when I tattoo them, I'm saying-- →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nBut, like, you tattoo them and then you see everything. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, I just would know-- Like, if I tattooed your bicep, Yasha. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nYeah. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI would have intimate knowledge of your bicep. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\n(impressed and excited laugh) (laughter) (laughter) That's a cool trick. →\n\n[laughter] I'm going to keep carrying this clay. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right, are you you guys making your way to the Lavish Chateau, then? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYes. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, you make your way through the entrance to the archways, the streets are beautiful. →\n\nThe multicolored stone work that lays across the roads in front of you are matched by the large multicolored banners that stretch across the different squares and the large tall buildings where all the nobles either own establishments to stay in or there are rentable establishments, those who are traveling through Nicodranas, since that is a hub of travel along the coast and to the Empire. →\n\nIt's beautiful in the daylight as it is in the night, though a different type of more colorful aesthetic. →\n\nAnd there you see the Lavish Chateau, the welcoming architecture of the multi-tiered, beautiful home to Marion, the mother of Jester. →\n\nAs you enter the interior of it, it's early enough in the day, you're pushing the afternoonish now, I'd say, it's early enough in the day where there isn't a lot of patronage yet. →\n\nYou see Carlos Remedi, who is the keeper of the bar down below, looks over towards you with his thicker mustache and his combed over hair. →\n\nHe's like, \"Hi, welcome, it's good to see you, Jester. →\n\nIt's been a while. →\n\nAnd your friends as well.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nâª It's been... âª →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Is your mother know you are coming?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nMy who? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Your mother.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, you're surprising her?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Very nice, very nice. →\n\nWell, she's probably upstairs if you want.\" At which, point you hear (quick footsteps) and you see running down the stairs, lighter footfalls and coming down you see, looks to be halfling feet. →\n\n# SAM\n\n(panicked noises) I go invisible. →\n\n[laughter] Okay, and down the stairs, you see, holding a wooden sword, you see Luc [awwing] running down and kind of like, \"(exertions) Oh, hi.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHello, little fellow. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHi Luc. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHello. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nLong time no see. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yeah. Where's Mom? Is Mom with you guys?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShe is on her way. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nShe'll be here very soon. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, cool.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShe wanted to get super pretty to see you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Okay.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAnd he hits the banister and dents it and you can see Carlos is like, \"Hey, hey, what you doing? I polished that. →\n\nThis kid is driving me crazy.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nLuc, Luc, Luc, come here. →\n\nI take him by the hand. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(as Luc) \"Yeah?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI want to show you my paint stash that I left here. →\n\nYou can make additions all over the Chateau. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Okay!\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'll bring him-- oh, well, I guess I'll wait until we get into the room. →\n\nIt's hiding in my room. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, as you head upstairs, you can see Carlos looking at Luc as he goes up the stairs there. →\n\nHe look back at him and goes-- And he looks up at him and-- [laughter] You make your way up. →\n\nYou see Bluud there is in the process of smoking a pipe, with his immense Minotaur form, lean against the door and kind of, \"Oh, Jester.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHi, Bluud. →\n\n# MATT\n\nStands up and opens the door to your mom's chambers. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThank you, is she...? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, she's available.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOkay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAs you walk inside you can see the balcony doors open, the breeze is blowing through, the silk curtains are slowly swaying with each gust. →\n\nShe's set up on her bed with a book open and she immediately looks up and closes it and sets it aside. (thunk) \"Jester?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHey, mama. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh my sweet sapphire,\" and she jumps off the bed and runs up and just gives you a big hug and lifts you up and spins you a bit. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nMama. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yes?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(whispers) I got a tattoo. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nThere's a a brief look of like, oh? And then a look of like, \"Well, show me!\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nIt's really big. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"That is beautiful, my Sapphire. I love it.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nSee, it sparkles. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"It does, oh, bring it here, bring it here.\" And she pulls you over towards where the light is coming in from the the window and you see it glittering, And you're like this-- \"Aw. →\n\nSee, you are the gem you were always meant to be.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nMy friends. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"It's a pleasure to see you all again.\" →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHello. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt's good to see you again. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHi. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh! I kneel down and I say: Luc go in my room, look behind the bookshelf. →\n\nThere's a loose plank on the wall. →\n\nIf you open it, you'll find a treat. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAnd he runs off. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThat's not a pastry you left here, like, four years ago, is it? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, no, no, it's a box of paint. →\n\nIt's a box of paint. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nOkay, okay. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nShould I tell him not to eat it? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNo. →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo, he's not an idiot. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, hi, Nott. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\n(startled noise) →\n\n# SAM\n\nI'm over here. →\n\nSorry, I'm here, too. →\n\nUm, Ruby of the Sea, Mrs. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Where is this sound coming from?\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nSorry. Hi, I'm over here. I pick up a pillow and just wave it around. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh! All right. →\n\nThe small girl. Yes, it's good to see you.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nDo you have a bathtub? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I have quite a nice bathtub, actually.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nCould we fill it with clay? [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nHer expression darts throughout the group and then back at Jester. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWe'll cover it with fabric before we do. →\n\nIt won't get stained. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Very well. As long as you promise not to harm the bathtub, then, you know, I'm not one to kink shame.\" [laughter, cheers] →\n\n\"Just make sure you clean up when you're done.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYes, it's not like that, but thank you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"No judgment.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nThank you. →\n\nThe pillow just sort of nods. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"That is a bit expensive, however,\" and she takes the pillow. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nYou'll be happy to know your daughter has been quite the adventurer. →\n\nShe's accomplished quite a bit. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Really? Oh, I knew she would. →\n\nWhat have you done?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOh, well, you remember the Traveler? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I remember you talking quite a bit about him since you were very little, yes.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nTurns out he's not a god. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Every child comes to a point in their life...\" [laughter] \"...where things-- fleets of fancy and imagination from childhood--\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI mean, he's real, Mama! He's still real. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Of course.\" [laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSorry to interject-- →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nWe actually met him. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNot a god, but we have all, in fact, met this individual. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nIt's true. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nMm-hmm. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nYeah. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Who is it, is she is safe? [laughter] I told you to take care of her.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNo, I did, we've taken that very seriously. →\n\nShe is quite safe. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nIt's a little predatory though, let's be honest. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nNo! [laughter] N-no, that's-- No! →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nA grown man was sneaking into a young girl's bedroom all the time, what? I mean, it turned out okay. →\n\nLike, it's fine, but-- →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nShe's actually in more control than you might imagine. →\n\nShe actually is dictating quite a bit of what happens in this relationship. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nYeah, If anything, she's the god. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"That's my girl.\" [cheering] \"I knew it.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nNo, but seriously, he is an ancient fey being. →\n\nIt's complicated. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nKind of like Frumpkin. →\n\nBut, like, a man. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nAnd, like, really old and has lots of power, but looks young, super handsome. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, I know all about that.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nWait a minute, Mama, did you ever-- okay. →\n\nYou remember how I told you he had no face? Like, I couldn't see his face? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Right.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI know what he looks like now. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh!\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nDid you ever meet a man who had fiery red hair, super fluffy and he had very handsome, vibrant green eyes and really large eyebrows, but in a good way? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I have seen such a man occasionally downstairs in the Chateau, but not as a client. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThat's him, that is him! →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I don't know if this makes it less weird.\" [laughter] \"But it's good to have a face to the name, I suppose. →\n\nAre you okay?\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'm kind of glad that he wasn't ever a client. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"In hindsight, me as well.\" [laughter] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHey, you're invited to a party, do you want to come? →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\n(disapproving grunting) →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"What kind of a party is--\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nThere's a party's tomorrow at the Marquis' demesne. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, yeah!

[cheering] →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI give her a big hug. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThis party is going to be dope. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nI'm so proud of you, Mama! I'm so proud of you. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"We're not there yet, so don't think that-- but I'm going to work on it. →\n\nI've been working on my... →\n\nexcursions a bit, so.\" At this point you can hear from the steps coming up. →\n\n(as Yeza) \"I couldn't find any, like, bread that was as fresh as we hoped for.\" And you hear Yeza as he's coming up the stairs. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhat about that pillow? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, wow, you're... →\n\nYou're all Veth's friends, it's good to see you.\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYeza, hello, it is so good to see you again. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Caleb, Beauregard.\" →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nNailed it. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Fjord, Yasha, Caduceus, Jester, of course. →\n\nIt's so good to see you guys. →\n\nWhere's my wife?\" →\n\n# LIAM\n\nSoon following on our heels. →\n\nShe will be here soon. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Wonderful.

Oh, because he knows that I'm coming. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nOh, okay. →\n\nLike a little prep. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(sweetly) Yeah. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI better do the same. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, well we're going to a bathroom. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYou know, just a little bit of revivification. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh my god. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Well, I was not performing tonight. →\n\nI was planning to perform at the Chateau tomorrow, but I can cancel that easy and be ready for this party.\" →\n\n# LAURA\n\nAre you sure? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Of course! I run this place, are you kidding me? Well, thank you for keeping her safe. →\n\nAnd I look forward to this event tomorrow night. →\n\nAnd of course, Jester, it's so good to see you. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYou too, mama. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"All right, well I should... →\n\nor at least I want to finish my book, if you don't mind. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nOf course we'll go to the bathroom. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Right.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nOh, to put the clay, yeah. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, okay. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Have fun.\" [laughter] She goes and lays back in her bed and pulls open her book. →\n\n# SAM\n\nMaybe we should, like, turn on a fan or something, to-- →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThis bathroom is enormous. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nYeah, it's pretty wonderful. →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nShould I put this in the tub? →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHold on, hold on, let me-- I'm just going to lay one of the green cloaks in the tub, just to keep the tub from getting stained with clay. →\n\n# MATT\n\nOkay, you lay the cloak down within the tub and it's a beautiful tub. →\n\nIt's one of those classic, long, claw-footed bathtubs, like a silver rim on the edge. →\n\nYou can see this was probably a gift to Marion. →\n\nIt's beautiful. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nWe're about to demolish this tub. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nNo, no, no! →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou set the cloak within, put the clay in there, situate a small pocket of it where Nott can lay into and it is like-- it's a very, very tiny element that, like a tub within in a tub and Nott, you can get into there fairly easily. →\n\n# SAM\n\nSure, yeah, I'll break invisibility and go in. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThis is going to take a while and I pull out a bit of red ribbon and tie it in a bow on the knob on the outside of the door and close it. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nSmart. →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nWhat's that for? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nThey'll know. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nWe need about hour of privacy. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThey won't come in. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAll right, Nott as you settle into the clay and find this thin pocket that bends around you because it's not terribly thick, but enough where you can at least feel like you're cradled within. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nCaleb, what do I do with all this glitter? →\n\n# LIAM\n\nHold on a moment and I hold out my hand to Nott. →\n\nYou sure you are ready? →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo! [laughter] But I'm going to do it anyway. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\nAnd I'm not sure what will happen afterwards, but you know, no matter what, you guys will help me get through it. →\n\nAnd if for some reason I don't come back or come back different or leave or something, you know how much you all mean to me and Jester, I hope we have more adventures together. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nMe, too. →\n\nI give Nott a kiss on the nose. →\n\n# SAM\n\nCaduceus, thank you for being honest and showing us that you can be scared, too. →\n\nAnd that's okay. →\n\nYasha, I'm, like, 60% sure you're not evil now. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nThat should be a lower percentage. →\n\n(laughter) Would you like a sip of your wine? →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo, thanks. →\n\n[cheering] Fjord, I'm sorry that I always call you weak, but I only do that because I know you're strong enough to take it. →\n\n[awwing] Beau, thank you for taking care of Mr. Caleb. →\n\nAnd Caleb, you know, I love you and you're the second love of my life. →\n\nThank you for being with me. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nI love you, too. →\n\n[cheering] Veth the Brave. →\n\n# SAM\n\nWell, we'll see. →\n\nAll right, glitter me, Jester. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nCan I, can I, can I? Glitter bomb! →\n\n# LIAM\n\nThat was more of an antiquing than I was anticipating, but it will do the job. →\n\nAll right, everybody have a seat. →\n\nThis is going to take a while. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAs you all situate into this now somewhat cramped bathroom, you go ahead and begin to set up the necessary ritual components, making the appropriate sigils on the floor, setting up the candles, having Beau aid you in burning the proper incense to begin to get the energy centered and focused on this particular tub. →\n\nAs you initiate the first rise of this ritual, you can see some of these symbols begin to glow that same faint color you saw in Essek's tower. →\n\nAs they begin to grow brighter and brighter, you can see the clay begin to slowly form on its own around Nott's body. →\n\nAs at that moment as the clay creates this thin barrier around the entirety of Nott form, eventually covering the face and the eyes, you, Caleb can feel yourself connecting on a very mental, psychic emotional level as part of this with Nott. →\n\nAnd in that connection, you urge Nott to think of her true form, who she always was and hopefully always will be. →\n\nAs you both sit there and concentrate, pushing into the next level of glyphs on the ground, glowing brighter and brighter, the clay begins to harden and warm up. →\n\nAnd you can feel the clay getting hot on your body to a point where it's alarming, but not too much to take. →\n\nAnd it's extended for minutes and minutes and minutes. →\n\nThis heat is there, but you hold tight to the trust as part of this and all of you quietly just watch on as Caleb mutters the incantations under his breath, his eyes in a trance. →\n\nEventually, the clay begins to go orange hot. →\n\nIt doesn't burn you, but it begins to just brighten and brighten and brighten. →\n\nThe outside light of the small glass windows in the chamber begin to slightly darken. →\n\nThe chamber becoming fainter and fainter. →\n\nAs the shadow swells around it, the glowing clay form of Nott's goblin body begins to emit this bright orange light. →\n\nYou push into the next wave of incantations, getting louder and louder. →\n\nThe windows themselves seem to black out at this point. →\n\nThere is no daylight making its way in. →\n\nThe only light source you see are the glowing glyphs steadily circling the base of this tub and the slightly lifting clay form of Nott. →\n\nAs you finish the final rights, you finished the incantation with a shout. →\n\nThe clay shatters across the room. →\n\nAll of you are pushed back from the impact of this arcane shockwave. →\n\nYou feel the wood beneath your feet growl and moan. →\n\nThe bathtub shatters. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(groans) [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\nBut that same orange glow is maintained. →\n\nWhile the clay is gone, there is still an orange form healthier and more halfling. →\n\nAs the light begins to fate and the body drifts down into the numerous pieces of shattered porcelain, there laying before you is Veth Brenatto. →\n\n[extended cheering] [more cheering, whooping] →\n\n# LIAM\n\nYou... →\n\nare not the goblin I first met. →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(wakka wakka sounds) →\n\n# SAM\n\n(sultry deep voice) Did it work? →\n\n# LAURA\n\n(gasps) [cheering] →\n\n# SAM\n\n(coughing) (normal Nott voice) Sorry! Sorry. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\nThere was some clay in my throat there. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nFuck. →\n\n# SAM\n\nIt's dry. →\n\nDid it work? →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nI pick up one of the mirrors from Marion's... →\n\n# LAURA\n\nBathroom. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nBathroom counter, cabinet. →\n\n# MATT\n\nSure, yeah. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nJust hold it up. →\n\n# LIAM\n\nIt is good to meet you again. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nHi! →\n\n# ASHLEY\n\nHi. →\n\n# SAM\n\nHi. →\n\n# TALIESIN\n\nHey. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\n'Sup. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\n# SAM\n\nI do a little curtsy, and just sort of twist my hair a bit and just sort of... →\n\n(voice breaking) just hug Caleb. →\n\n[awwing] [applause, cheering] →\n\n# LIAM\n\n(fervently) I'm so proud of you. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI'm so proud of you. You can do anything. →\n\nWell, I love you all, but I really want to go see my family now, so, I'm sorry about your mom's bathtub. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nIt's okay, it's worth it. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI really don't think it is okay, but-- [laughter] →\n\n# MATT\n\n(knocking) →\n\n# SAM\n\nOh shit. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(as Yeza) \"Is everyone okay in there?\" I heard a commotion. →\n\n# MARISHA\n\nHang on, we're getting dressed. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\nHeh heh heh heh. →\n\n# SAM\n\nI'll swing open the door. →\n\n# MATT\n\nYou see there a look of panic in his eyes, your husband, who immediately goes from, like, a... →\n\n# SAM\n\nHi. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Hi.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nI'll just grab him and tilt him back and kiss him. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Wait.\" After he breaks apart. \"Wait!\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nIt felt different, right? →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"There's-- There's not as much teeth.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nNo, no. →\n\nThere's, like, a regular amount of teeth. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAnd he just grabs you and kisses you again. →\n\n[cheering] →\n\n# SAM\n\nI'm me again. I'm back. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"I'm so happy to have you back,\" and you can see just, like, tears coming down his face. →\n\n# SAM\n\nLet's go find Luc. →\n\n# MATT\n\n(whoosh, thud) You immediately get hit in the forehead with a wooden crossbow bolt. →\n\n# SAM\n\nFuck. →\n\n[laughter] →\n\nYou've been learning, huh? →\n\n# MATT\n\n(as Luc) \"I've been practicing!\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nYeah, you have! That was good! That was good. →\n\nI'll teach you about how to keep below the neck for indoor shots. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Oh, okay.\" →\n\n# SAM\n\nHey, come here. →\n\n# MATT\n\nAnd he runs up and gives you a big hug. →\n\nAs he's holding you, you can see your husband just looking back at you with a smile and then it looks briefly at all of you and goes, \"Thank you. →\n\nThank you.\" →\n\n# TRAVIS\n\nThank you for sharing her with us as long as you have. →\n\nShe's been amazing. →\n\n# LAURA\n\nThe bravest halfling we've ever met. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"That's the truth.\" [applause and cheering] →\n\n# SAM\n\nI do feel a little bit braver. →\n\nA little bit weaker, too. →\n\n[laughter] I might need to lie down. →\n\n# MATT\n\n\"Yeah, no, of course,\" which by the way, both of you gu"
