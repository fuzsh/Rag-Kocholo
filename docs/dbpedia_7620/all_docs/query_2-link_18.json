        "text": "European-American racism has used African America as a screen on which to project repressed emotion, particularly sex and aggression. One aspect of this projection is that whites are attracted to black music as a means of expressing aspects of themselves they cannot adequately express through music from European roots. Thus twentieth century expressive culture in the United States has been dominated by an evolving socio-cultural system in which blacks create musical forms and whites imitate them. It happened first with jazz, and then with rock and roll. The sexual revolution and the recent floresence of blacks in television and movies suggests that white America has had some success in using black American expressive forms to cure its affective ills. The emergence of rap, from African America, and minimalism, from European America, indicates that this system is at a point where it is ready to leave Western expressive culture behind as history moves to the next millennium.\n\nWith their focus on world musical inspirations, the late suites of Duke Ellington offer a rich source for exploring his relationship with jazz identity beyond the American dichotomy of black and white. While the spread of jazz around the globe during the 1950s and 1960s on one level represented American prosperity, it could also be understood as presenting a threat to the uniquely American identity of jazz. Through his experiences on numerous State Department tours, Duke Ellington also recognized both the positive and negative implications of globalization, as evidenced in many of his comments about musical identity from this time. His own ambivalence resonated with statements of Marshall McLuhan, a popular intellectual icon whose ideas challenged people to reconsider their relationship with media and with others around the globe. When Ellington encountered McLuhan’s ideas, he incorporated them into his presentation of his late suite, the Afro-Eurasian Eclipse (1970). By exploring Ellington’s discussion of the suite, its relation to Marshall McLuhan’s notions of globalization and identity loss, and its employment of musical tropes, we can begin to understand Ellington’s evaluation of jazz identity in a context beyond the stereotypical black and white of America. I argue that the suite represents Ellington’s attempt to negotiate the expanding horizons of jazz in an era when its definition had evolved largely beyond the communities who had directed its development. By incorporating musical signifiers of other cultures into his language, Ellington could reenact a kind of microcosmic “global village” on his own terms, while continually renegotiating his own musical identity as an aging bandleader in a fast changing world."
