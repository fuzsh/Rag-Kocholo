Professional customers should contact the Licensing department directly to enquire about a title's availability: [email protected]\n\nImportant:\n\nThe cost quoted is an estimate only and may differ when you apply for a licence.\n\nThis stage adaptation of Ken Kesey's celebrated novel explores the brutality of life in a mental institution with humor, candor and unforgettable characters.\n\nAfter being convicted of a petty crime, a charming, rebellious rogue named McMurphy contrives to serve his short sentence in an airy mental institution rather than in a prison. This, he soon learns, was a mistake. He immediately clashes with the authoritarian head nurse, a fierce martinet named Nurse Ratched. Despite Ratched's strict reign, MacMurphy quickly takes over the yard, leading others out of introversion, staging a revolt so that they can see the World Series on television, and arranging a rollicking midnight party with liquor and women. But MacMurphy's brash insubordination has its consequences; Ratched ultimately triumphs by subjecting MacMurphy to a frontal lobotomy."
