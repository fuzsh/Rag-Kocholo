Train Station\n\nI was born with a club foot and had to wear orthopedic shoes as a kid. My mother would take me to Phila. 30th street station and then taxi to center city Phila to a shoe \"store\" in an office building that made special shoes. We did this a couple times a year and I still remember those smells from the train stations. I also remember the \"news stand\" and the enormous size of 30th street station. This \"journey\" would take the better part of a day. I always enjoyed the train ride - wasn't too crazy about the foot measurements. The treat would be to eat lunch at Horn & Hardart where food would come out of a machine.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate: 2/20/2012, 1:25 pm, EST\n\nName: Bill\n\nLocation: Delaware\n\nOld Neighborhood(s): 4th & Harrison, East Lake\n\nSchools Att'd: several\n\nEmployers:\n\nMessage: On Saturday, 20 February, 1937, the new Post Office and Federal Building on Rodney Square , was open for the public to inspect.

U of D\n\nEmployers:\n\nMessage: The Wilmington train station had a character all it's own. I remember the distinctive smell of old cigar smoke and shoe shine polish mingled with the smell of the trains, themselves, as they pulled in and out of the station. Although there probably wasn't any smell to the steam that the engine or undercarriage of the Pullman cars exhausted, like a tired old dog, I imagined at the time, there was a distinctive aroma to the place, undoubtedly added to by the odor of greasy food that drifted across Front Street from Fakis' Lunchenette mixed with the exhaust fumes of a Yellow Cab or two idling at the curb outside the street level doors to the station, just beneath the platform. And I seem to remember bundles of newspapers, tied in bundles with the smell of fresh ink and not yet creased paper that carried the \"up-to-the-minute\" news of the day: Wasn't there a Mayor named \"Lamott\" then who wore a flower in his lapel, and a sale on at the Wilmington Dry? Freer and Williams were two of the names that seemed to find their way into those bundles of newsprint. And I remember that we were a \"company town\" then, as well..... Where were we all coming and going to from that train station? Maybe someone was heading up to New York to try and sell some new fabric to one of the hosiery mills there...... maybe a couple of Wilmington bankers were going to a meeting in Philadelphia or Baltimore..... What was so important about all those journeys? I remember that someone shouted \"All Aboard,\" just a moment before our departure.......\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate: 2/19/2012, 8:40 pm, EST\n\nName: Jerry T.\n\nLocation: at the shore, de.\n\nOld Neighborhood(s): Hedgeville(S.Jackson), S.Broom, N.Broom, Klair Ests.\n\nSchools Att'd: St. Hedwig's, Archmere, U. of D.\n\nEmployers: U.S. Army, State of Dela.(retired)\n\nMessage: I know the mystery of the Wilmington/Harrisburg train stations has already been solved, but one clue that gave it away to me, was the absence of the clock tower.

I was in the Class of '66. I broke off with the nursing student, just before I got drafted in '69. If it was Bill Gunther Jr., who I remembered, he dated a student nurse whose last name was Toomey.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDate: 2/11/2012, 8:47 pm, EST\n\nName: Garent Gunther\n\nLocation: Bear, DE\n\nOld Neighborhood(s): Seton Dr., Woodsdale Rd,\n\nSchools Att'd: Mt.

But the main question is: Did you marry the nurse?\n\nYou probably graduated Archmere about 1965 or 66?
