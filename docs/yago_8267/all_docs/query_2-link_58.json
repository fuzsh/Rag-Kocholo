        "text": "Police say they do not suspect foul play in Sunday’s discovery of the body of a male individual at Rodney Heights.\n\nInvestigators identified the deceased as long-serving Justice of the Peace, John Daniel.\n\nDaniel was a former President of the Saint Lucia Justice of the Peace Association.\n\nA family member discovered the former police officer unresponsive at about 3:25 pm.\n\nTedburt Theobalds, the deceased’s friend for many years, expressed condolences to Daniel’s family.\n\nTheobalds described Daniel, who had been ailing, as someone who was ambitious and hardworking.\n\n“He worked assiduously as a JP throughout the length and breadth of Saint Lucia and he represented the profession very well,” Theobalds recalled.\n\n“I really feel saddened by his death and I trust that he will go to the greater beyond and we’ll all meet at some time,” he told St. Lucia Times.\n\nAny third-party or user posts, comments, replies, and third-party entries published on the St. Lucia Times website (https://stluciatimes.com) in no way convey the thoughts, sentiments or intents of St. Lucia Times, the author of any said article or post, the website, or the business.
