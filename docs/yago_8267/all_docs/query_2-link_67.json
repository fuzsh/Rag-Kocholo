Rodney was a loving husband, father and was an especially devoted grandfather. He was an avid gardener, a voracious reader and was known for his witty sense of humor.\n\nRodney is survived by: wife Janet; sons Jason (Krista), Curtis (Tracy), Daniel (Tonia), Timothy (Alyssa); 13 wonderful grandchildren; brothers David (Jean), Michael, Allen (Lois).\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents.\n\nRodney’s family would like to extend special thanks to Quiet Oaks Hospice, the St. Cloud Hospital Hospice, and family, friends and neighbors that supported us."
