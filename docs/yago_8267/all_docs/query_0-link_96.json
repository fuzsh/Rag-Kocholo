Interment in West End Cemetery.\n\n[Source: Allentown Morning Call, Wednesday, October 14, 1896. Submitted by Jerri.]\n\nFrederick, Adam Benneville\n\nAllentown lost one of its most esteemed citizens yesterday afternoon in the death of Adam Benneville Frederick, of the firm of Butz, Frederick & Co., owners of the plaining mill on Maple street, above Tenth. Mr. Frederick's death came entirely unexpected and the members of his family were prostrated when the sad news reached them. The deceased was in the office of the mill chatting pleasantly with his brother, Solomon S. Frederick, at about 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, when he was suddenly taken ill and reeled over and was caught by his brother. He gave a few gasps and expired in his brother's arms. Drs. Frey and Stough were hurriedly summoned, but they at once saw, upon their arrival, that the man was beyond all human aid. The remains were removed by employes of the mill to the home of the deceased, No. 36 South Tenth street, where they were met by the stricken family who had been informed of the death. Mr. Frederick had an attack of pneumonia about four weeks ago, but had almost entirely recovered. He had, however, been in ill health for three or four years prior to that time and he was warned by his physicians that he would probably at any time be seized with attacks of heart failure. The deceased, however, could not relinquish his work at the mjill, having led a very busy life and he was very often at his desk when his condition was such that his family urged him to remain at home. Mr. Frederick was born at Longswamp, Berks county, October 30, 1830, and was, therefore, in his 70th year. He was a son of Mr. and Mrs. Solomon Frederick and was raised on his father's farm. When he was 13 years of age his father died. He remained at home a year longer and then hired out to farmers living in the vicinity of his home, until he was 18 years of age. About this time he was confirmed in the Lutheran Church at Mertztown by Rev. Isaac Roeller. After his confirmation he entered the employ as apprentice of Thomas Wilt, the miller, who conducted the Trexler Grist Mills, at Longswamp. Mr. Frederick remained there for six of seven years, when he started work as a millwright and continued at that trade for about six years. The last year of that time he spent with the Grim, Mickley & Weaver mill, in South Allentown, later known as the Schnurman mill. He then formed a partnership with the late Daniel H. Greenawald, in the carpentering and building business. In 1864 he associated himself with Levi Butz in the planning mill business. The firm was known as Butz & Frederick. In 1865 the firm of Butz, Frederick & Co. was formed with Joseph Kline. Mr. Kline remained in the firm for a few months, when he sold out to Solomon S. Frederick, the deceased's surviving brother. This firm continued until spring of 1892, when Solomon Frederick sold out his interest to Elmer E. Butz and Frank H. Frederick, son of the deceased. The firm name remained as Butz, Frederick & Co. The partnership of Levi Butz and the deceased was continued uninterrupted for thirty-six years. The deceased was married three times. His first wife was Caroline Baumer. A son born to this union died in infancy. Mr. Frederick was married a second tim to Maria Rebecca Sellers. One son was born to them, William J. Frederick, who resides at No. 38 South Tenth street. The deceased was married to his surviving widow, who is Sarah C., daughter of Jacob and Hannah Ritter, on February 17, 1861. This union was blest with the following children: Frank H., Joseph, Mrs. John Sefing, Allentown, and Charles S., of Lancaster, all of whom survive. The parents of the deceased, who have long since departed, were Solomon and Mary (nee Smith) Frederick. Six sons and two daughters were born to them of whom only one brother of the deceased, Solomon S. Frederick, of Allentown, and one sister, Mrs. James Smith, of Fogelsville, survive. Mr. Frederick was one of the organizers of St. Paul's Lutheran Church of this city, and served at various times as an officer in the church and Sunday school. In 1876 when St. Michael's Lutheran Church was organized, he withdrew from St. Paul's and joined the new congregation. Here he again became an active church worker and was foremost in all efforts tending to the upbuilding and advancement of the church and congregation. He lived a strictly Christian life and was an exemplary man and father in all his habits. His business dealings were marked with strict honesty and integrity. To the employes of the mill, who loved and trusted him implicitly, his death comes as a personal loss. His friends, too, whom he numbered in hosts, lose an associate whose life was an inspiration to them and whose kind words of sympathy in the hour of sorrow tempered the "
