The Park also includes the site of the 1777 Battle of Red Bank (American victory against the Hessians, which was part of the Philadelphia campaign) and the site of Fort Mercer. The Whitall home served as a field hospital after the battle. The Park, as you may know, is on the Delaware River and is directly across from Fort Mifflin and the Philadelphia airport.\n\nwww.gloucestercountynj.gov/depts/p/parks/parkgolf/redbank/\n\nThe fellowship, which is renewable yearly, is named after former Red Bank curator Megan Giordano, a 2005 graduate of the Winterthur Program who passed away in 2011.\n\nAs you can imagine, I am really excited to start this position as I finish up my dissertation on material culture and disability in early America at Delaware.

The food was wonderful, the decorations elegant, the mood cheerful and pleasant. From the guest register ( although not everyone who came signed in) it looks like we had at least 120 people in and out throughout the day. A record for sure! Beth and Cathy's key chains, book marks, postcards much appreciated---as is the fact they stayed from 10 am to 10 p.m., always on their feet, always gracious. Linda Moss's and Bill Lindsey's music was perfect, subtle and appropriate and very much appreciated. Dick Niekamp's colonial muskets, Rich Paul's lighting collection, and Lois Niekamp's gentle showing of our Isaiah Thomas Bible were of great interest to our visitors, and Bob Selig's evening talk was so well-received that I was afraid the Q & A would keep that wonderful man here until midnight! Kathy deSimone, Linda Duffy, Debbie Poffenberger, Donna Draper, Nancy Parker, the twins, Oriole O'Neill, Barbara Miller and AnnaMay Case, what would we do without you? Awesome ladies, all! See you in April for our first program in 2014, when Ms. Kip Cherry will be our first Round Table speaker, updating us on the new Battle of Princeton which is currently raging between developers vs Princeton Battlefield Society.\n\nNovember 13, 2013\n\nThis link is to a White Clay Creek Newsletter article by Kate Miller. \"Will The White Clay Run Silver Again?\" [ HERE ]\n\nOctober 18, 2013\n\nCongratulations to Barbara White, immediate past president of the Hale Byrnes House!
