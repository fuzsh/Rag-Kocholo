        "text": "Adjust Text Size: A+ A-\n\nRODNEY DANIEL STAFF It is with great sadness that we announce the sudden death of Rod Staff, of heart failure, at the age of 41. Rod leaves to cherish his memory and mourn his passing Cheryl, his loving, devoted wife and dearest friend of 22 years; his son Danny; daughter Rachena (Stewart) son-in-law Troy and granddaughter Makayla. He also will be greatly missed by his mother Marion Staff; sisters, Judy and Sharon; brother Rob; parents-in-law Jake and Adina Goertzen, and the rest of his extended family as well as many friends. He was predeceased by his father Daniel Staff. Rod was born in Winnipeg on July 24, 1959, where he was raised and has resided, except for brief periods of time in Wadena, Sask., and Okotoks, Alta. He worked as a pipeliner operator for Conoco Canada. He had many hobbies and interests, especially racing and watching Danny play hockey. His passion for racing started as a snowmobile racer. It progressed to mini-sprints, and then on to his status as an expert modified racer at Victory Lane Speedway for the last six years. Rod is lovingly remembered for his devotion to his family and care for his friends. He especially enjoyed working alongside of his wife and son on their race cars and other projects. He was proud of his daughter and adored his granddaughter. He was well known for his expertise as a mechanic, and generosity as someone who was always helping others. He had a wonderful laugh and thrived on discussion and knowledge about all the things that interested him. Rod, you were the most wonderful husband and father, and your voice, your touch, your love and your laughter will be remembered in our hearts forever. Viewing will be held on Thursday, March 8 from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. at Kilcona Alliance Church, 1977 Norris Rd., east of Lagimodiere at McIvor. The funeral service will be held on Friday, March 9 at 2:00 p.m. at Kilcona Alliance Church with interment at Glen Lawn Cemetery. The family wishes to thank all the friends and family for their support and love during this difficult time. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Variety Club of Manitoba - Childrens Heart Foundation, 611 Wellington Cres., Winnipeg, Man., R3M 0A7. Arrangements entrusted to Klassen Funeral Chapel; 338-0331.\n\nAs published in Winnipeg Free Press on Mar 08, 2001"
