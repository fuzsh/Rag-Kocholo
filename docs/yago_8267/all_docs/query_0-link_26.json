        "text": "Two patriots of the American Revolution were honored recently for their service to Sussex County and the United States.\n\nMembers of the Sons of the American Revolution paid tribute to Henry Neill and John Rodney at their graves Oct. 24. Each contributed to the war effort, but in different ways.\n\nNeill's military service began in 1776 when he was appointed adjutant under Col. David Hall. He earned the rank of lieutenant in 1778 and rose to the rank of colonel, assigned to command a Continental regiment. Born in Lewes in 1742, Neill worked as an attorney and was married twice, said Thomas Urban, who researched the patriot for the Sons. His second wife Mary Blount was the widow of North Carolina Gov. William Blount. Though Neill had no children from either marriage, Urban said, historical documents show he was loved by people of all ages.\n\n“Col. Neill was a man of great energy and of stern integrity and generous in his hospitalities,” Urban read from a family history. “The old people of Lewes who remember him say that although without children himself, he was beloved by those who were young.”\n\nThe documents also note Neill lived an expensive lifestyle but not beyond his means.\n\nA marker was placed at Neill's grave in the cemetery of the Lewes Presbyterian Church.\n\nWhile Neill was directly connected to the war through his military service, John Rodney was a caretaker on the home front. A member of the famous Rodney family, John was a half first cousin of Caesar Rodney, signer of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nJohn was the sheriff of Sussex County before the Revolution. When the war began, Rodney was already 50 years old. In November 1776, he became a member of the Committee of Safety of Sussex County. He also served as military treasurer for the county and was a member of the Committee of Accounts of Military Expenses for the county.\n\nHe was the father of Caleb and Daniel Rodney, who each served as governor in the early 1800s and resided in Lewes.\n\nJohn Rodney is buried in the cemetery of St. Peter's Episcopal Church on Second Street.\n\nTroy Foxwell, state president of the Sons of the American Revolution, said his group is making a concerted effort to locate and acknowledge patriots buried throughout the state. As gravestones weather over time, he said, it is important to document where patriots are buried so they can be honored justly."
