        "text": "Dr. Rodney Andrews, a renowned labor economist and Fellow, Vibhooti Shukla Professor of Economics and Political Economy at The University of Texas at Dallas, died May 12 at the age of 47.\n\nAndrews, who joined the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences (EPPS) in 2009 and was one of the leaders of the Texas Schools Project (TSP) at UT Dallas, was an expert on health policy, public finance and labor economics. His recent focus included the economics of education, specifically concerning issues of access and success in higher education. He also studied the effects of prekindergarten attendance on student achievement.\n\n“Dr. Andrews was an energetic scholar who worked on one of the most important issues in education. He worked to understand which interventions worked best to create opportunity,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmes, EPPS dean and the Lloyd V. Berkner Professor of political science and of public policy and political economy.\n\n“He was an exemplary friend and mentor. His loss as a colleague and scholar is immeasurable,” she said.\n\nAndrews, an associate professor of economics, was research director of the TSP, which supports and conducts research to improve academic achievement and teacher effectiveness, to increase transitions to and success in postsecondary education, and to improve labor market outcomes of students in Texas and the nation. He previously served as the TSP director from 2011 to 2015.\n\n“Dr. Andrews was a great mentor to many colleagues and students over the years,” said Dr. Trey Miller, associate professor of economics and director of the TSP. “In his capacity as director of the UT Dallas Education Research Center, he collaborated with researchers and students nationally to craft a research agenda utilizing Texas’ unparalleled education data for the improvement of education in the state.”\n\n“He was an exemplary friend and mentor. His loss as a colleague and scholar is immeasurable.”\n\nDr. Jennifer Holmes, dean of the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences\n\nAndrews’ expertise in the economics of education was highly regarded, said Dr. Daniel G. Arce, Ashbel Smith Professor and department head of economics.\n\n“Under his guidance, the Texas Schools Project at UT Dallas has become the premier database for research on education in the world. He was a rigorous teacher who was extremely popular with his students,” he said.\n\nDuring his career, Andrews mentored dozens of PhD candidates and was principal advisor to many of them. He served on numerous dissertation committees and continued to collaborate with his students as they advanced in their research careers.\n\nSara Muehlenbein BS’11, PhD’17, a labor economist for Charles River Associates in Tallahassee, Florida, was the first PhD graduate Andrews mentored as principal advisor. She said he took a genuine interest in his students and was always eager to sit down for a chat. His teaching centered around applying critical thinking and sparked interest in research.\n\n“His eager mentorship instilled grit and grace that fostered a community creating knowledge and launching students into their careers on a solid foundation,” Muehlenbein said. “I would not be the scholar, economist, nor the person I am today if not for Rodney Andrews. He brought out the best in everyone around him, and I have no doubt his legacy will live on.”\n\nAndrews’ impact on UT Dallas and its students was so profound that EPPS plans to rename its undergraduate teaching award in his honor, Arce said. But the impact of his life extended far beyond the campus.\n\n“Most importantly, he was the father of four, and he never tired of describing the joy his children brought to his life,” Arce said.\n\nMiller said: “The world lost a brilliant scholar, great colleague and mentor to so many, but most importantly, a good and humble man with a kind and gentle soul. I am so grateful for the years I was blessed to work with him to improve the lives of our students at UTD and everywhere.”\n\n“I would not be the scholar, economist, nor the person I am today if not for Rodney Andrews. He brought out the best in everyone around him, and I have no doubt his legacy will live on.”\n\nSara Muehlenbein BS’11, PhD’17\n\nAndrews served as co-editor of Economics of Education Review, was on the editorial board of Education Finance and Policy and was a faculty research fellow at the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nHe received his Master of Arts and PhD in economics from the University of Michigan and earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the Georgia Institute of Technology. From 2007 to 2009, Andrews was a Robert Wood Johnson Scholar in Health Policy Research at Harvard University.\n\nIn addition to his children, Taylor, Radha, Rodney and Brendan, and his granddaughter, Fallon, Andrews is survived by his wife, Tanya."
