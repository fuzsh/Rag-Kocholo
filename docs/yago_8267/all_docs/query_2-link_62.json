        "text": "The remaining 6 matches of the Premier League will be absolutely exhilarating, even for the neutrals. In a weekend where Liverpool dropped points, this would have been Arsenal's chance to cement their lead at the top of the table. Alas, Man City were the beneficiaries after gameweek 32. The silver lining for Arsenal is Mikel Arteta. Despite not having much success of his own in his playing days, he is now leading, coaching and managing a hungry, determined, passionate group of players. What he needs now is for them to match his hunger, determination and passion. His relentless quest for success, for performance excellence, sometimes rubs people the wrong way. Some would say he may at times have let his values go in his unending pursuit to be a champion. However, it is because of this unsatiable motivation that makes him such a key makeup of this Arsenal team. Have a think: which Arsenal player is indispensable to this current squad? What about Arteta? Here, he is rallying for them to bounce back by highlighting their incredible run of results. He perceives the current situation as a challenge. These are positives. The players, now more than ever, need to step up and show where their fighting spirit is. #psychologicalskills #sportpsychology\n\nArsenal and Spurs don't do business. I don't know if you know? There are speculation that Spurs are interested in signing Arsenal Striker and US International, Folarin Balogun to replace Harry Kane in the attack. But guess what? Arsenal and Spurs don't do business and this is a relic of the age long rivalry at North London. The rivalry between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal brings some lessons about conflicts and dispute Resolution to the fore : 1. The closer the relationship between the parties- the stronger the rivalry when there is a fallout. 2. Where there is a dispute between parties with close filial or business relationship, the stakes are higher and acrimonious tendency in event of total breakdown of relationship outweighs whatever each of the parties stands to gain at the moment. 3. Their business of affiliates are affected. In 2001, Arsenal signed Spur's captain and center back, Sol Campbell on a free transfer. Spurs Fans were unhappy with their ex-captain who insisted that he joined Arsenal to win trophies. A move that earned Sol a fulfilling and rewarding career. if Folarin is interested in joining spurs - he must wait till his contract with arsenal expires. The fate of Romeo & Juliet was also caused by the rivalry between Their families. Developing corporative or Win- Win approach to dispute resolution when conflicts arise, especially between parties with existing relationship will preserve the status quo and promote both personal and business interest of parties. Speaking as an Arsenal Fan. Rivalry makes football more interesting. Looking forward to crushing Fulham this Weekend. #tgif #disputeresolution #mediation #conflictresolution #mediationskills #negotiation #business #arsenalfc #rivalry #tottenhamhotspur #adr #football"
