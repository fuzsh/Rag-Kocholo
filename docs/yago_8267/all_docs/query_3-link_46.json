        "text": "SUSSEX COUNTY.\n\nOf the three counties of Delaware, Sussex is the most southerly. Its boundaries are, Kent County on the north; Maryland on the south; Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and Maryland on the west. The territory which this county now occupies was known in its early history as the Hoornkill, or Horekill, and extended from Bombay Hook to Cape Henlopen. This name came, in all probability, from Hoorn, a little city in Holland, the birthplace of De Vries the director-general of the first expedition which landed on Delaware soil, on the present site of Lewes, in 1631. The name was afterwards corrupted into Whorekill or Horekill, but the most reliable authorities now substantially agree that the correct name was Hoorn Kill, and that it was first applied to the creek (now Lewes creek) on which the earliest settlement was made, and the name was afterwards applied to all the region lying south of Bombay Hook.\n\nUntil the establishment of the Mason and Dixon Line in 1775 (the boundary between Delaware and Maryland having been in dispute, and unsettled, in all the intervening years from the earliest settlements), the southerly boundary line of Delaware was uncertain and undefined. It is claimed that Lord Baltimore, as Proprietor of Maryland, exercised owner ship over all that part of the territory embraced in Sussex County, as at present constituted, lying south and west of a line drawn from the present town of Farmington in a south easterly direction to the mouth of Rehoboth Bay. Many of the land records at Annapolis and data obtained from old church records tend to prove that prior to the Revolution, what is now southwestern Sussex, was part of Worcester County, Maryland. The part of the county lying northeast of the line, above described, was for a time called \"Old Sussex,\" and the remaining portion was known as \"New Sussex.\" Some effort was made about the year 1786 to make a new county in the State by taking part of Sussex and part of Kent and giving the parts thus taken a new county seat. The movement met with some favor, but did not succeed. The first mention of the term Hundred was in 1690 when on April 9th of that year, the Provincial Council instructed the magistrates and grand juries of the counties to divide them into Hundreds. The term Hundred is supposed to be derived from a suggestion made by William Penn, that the land be divided between ten families in accordance with an old English custom, assuming that each family was ten in number, making one hundred. This is generally believed to be the origin of the term Hundred, as applied to the subdivisions of the counties of this State. The Hundreds of Sussex County are thirteen in number with the following names: Cedar Creek, Nanticoke, Northwest Fork, Seaford, Broadkiln, Lewes and Rehoboth, Indian River, Baltimore, Dagsborough, Georgetown, Broad Creek, Little Creek and Gumborough.\n\nThe records show that Lewes was the first county seat of Sussex, not by reason of any official action, but rather by general consent. This is probably due to the fact that it was formally made the place for the transaction of county affairs from its establishment as a trading-post in 1658, until the county seat was moved to Georgetown. For a long period the Dutch commanders held their military courts in a fort which had been built at the Hoorn Kill (now Lewes), and this practice was subsequently followed by the English in 1664. Lewes remained the seat of county government until 1793. There is no certainty as to the exact time when Sussex County obtained its first court house. The project of building a courthouse was discussed for years, and while courts were held at public houses and village taverns for a long period of time, there is nothing to show that a court house was built in Sussex County until sometime between 1740 and 1750. The records establish the fact that a court house consisting of a frame structure, adequate to the needs of the county at that time, was built between the above-mentioned dates at Lewes, and that a jail was also erected about the same time. In 1786 a spirited agitation arose in Sussex County for a change of the county seat. It was claimed that Lewes, being at the extreme eastern side of the county, was not convenient for a majority of the people. Petitions were presented to the Legislature of 1791 to that effect, and an act was passed January 29, 1791, authorizing George Mitchell, Robert Houston, William Moore, John Collins, Nathaniel Young, William Peery, Rhodes Shankland, Woodman Stockley, Daniel Polk and Thomas Batson, to act as commissioners, and authority given to them to purchase in fee not exceeding one hundred acres of land near the center of the county for the purpose of building thereon a court house and jail. The purchase was made and the place called Georgetown, in honor of George Mitchell, in which place a court house and jail were completed in 1792. By an act of the General Assembly of 1793, the whipping-post and pillory were removed from Lewes to Georgetown. In 1835 there was a general demand through out the county for a more commodious court house. This demand meeting general public favor, a brick structure, two stories high, with the public offices on the first floor, and the court room above, was erected. This building was completed in 1839, and in the fall of the same year the first term of court was held therein, and it has continued in use since that time. In 1798, on the recommendation of the Levy Court, an addition was made to the jail. In 1854 a new jail was erected, which was destroyed by fire in November, 1865, and in the following year, 1866, the present jail was built at the same location.\n\nAt a very early period laws were enacted for the relief of the poor in Delaware. In December, 1793, the trustees of the poor for Sussex County purchased four hundred acres of land lying on White creek, in Baltimore Hundred, and established an almshouse on it, and it was used as such until 1800, when an exchange of property was made for four hundred acres of land in Broad Kiln Hundred (now Georgetown Hundred), on which new buildings were erected, which were used as the county almshouse until 1877. In 1878 the present building for the insane was erected at a cost of seven thousand dollars. The present almshouse was erected in 1885, and the present almshouse farm consists of about three hundred and sixty-five acres. The almshouse record for Sussex County begins from June 1, 1791, when John Anderson was appointed first overseer. From the establishment of this institution to the present period, great credit is due those who have had charge of the same, for the excellent care which has been taken of the inmates and buildings. In the year 1793 an act was passed providing for the election of Levy Court Commissioners. From the organization of said court until 1798, the records are not given, but there is sufficient evidence to show that the provisions of the law of 1793 defining the number and duties of the Levy Court have continued substantially in force from its organization to the present.\n\nThe soil of Sussex is for the most part fertile, the staple products being corn, wheat, potatoes, pork, lumber and cattle. The main line of the Delaware railroad traverses the county from north to south, its terminus being at Delmar on the Maryland line. The Delaware, Maryland and Virginia railroad, being really a merger of the old Junction and Breakwater and Breakwater and Frankford roads, enters the county at Milford and serving as a main line for the county seat and Eastern Sussex, puts the populace in close touch with the Atlantic seaboard. A competing line, known as the Queen Anne's railroad, crosses the county from west to east and gives direct and easy access to the eastern shore and Baltimore. There has been a wonderful improvement in all the interests of Sussex County since its early settlement. With the progress of education has developed growth in all branches of business. Highly improved farms dot its surface in all directions. The hum of factories betokens activity and prosperity. In recent years Sussex County has developed largely as a fruit growing section, and large shipments of fruit, consisting of berries and peaches are made to various points. The railroads have materially assisted Sussex County in all stages of its growth by affording to the people rapid and convenient means of access to the various markets. Both early records and tradition unite in support of the assertion that Sussex County has not failed to keep pace with her sister counties in the development of agricultural and industrial enterprise, and in every measure of local improvement.\n\nPrevious to the adoption of the Free School Law of 1829, the school privileges in Sussex County were extremely limited. While the Constitution of 1792 recognized the necessity of taking steps looking towards the education of the people, it was not until 1817 that any action was taken with reference thereto, and even the, on a limited and unsatisfactory scale. In the above year the Legislature passed an act appropriating one thousand dollars to each county, for the establishment of schools for the instruction of poor children in \"reading, writing and arithmetic.\" Under this law a few schools were organized, and the way was opened for further improvement, but the law being administered as \"charity,\" did not meet with general approval. In 1829 the free school system came into existence, the Hon. Willard Hall being known as the \"father\" thereof. This law provided for the laying out and establishing school districts in each county, and committed to the voters the whole power over common schools established in said districts.\n\nWhile one important point was gained by the passage of this law, the recognized necessity for educating the masses, many defects were apparent, which greatly hampered its efficiency. Among these was the power given the school voters to determine whether or not a school should be opened each year, and for how long a time, by voting for or against a school tax. In many parts of the county this power was used to the injury of the district, and for several consecutive years, the tax was voted down, in some localities, thereby depriving the children, sometimes for a period of years, of all school privileges. The act of 1829 was amended by supplementary acts in 1830, 1832, 1833 and 1835, all of which tended to the improvement of the school system. In 1867 a large convention of progressive men of the State was held at Dover, at which many needed reforms in the school law were suggested; among which was the recommendation that a State superintendent be appointed and that a change be made in the mode of laying school taxes. In 1875 the present school system of the State was established, under which, with changes from time to time, the schools of Sussex County have been revolutionized.\n\nIt was no uncommon thing in the early days for teachers in this county to itinerate from district to district. The teachers were not examined, and often incompetent persons were hired by equally incompetent committeemen. The school buildings and furniture were of an inferior character. In recent years, many new and commodious school buildings have been erected in various Hundreds of the county; and the necessity of educating the masses has been generally recognized. Improved methods of teaching have been introduced and a systematic supervision of the schools established, all of which has contributed to elevate the standard of the profession of teaching and has given greater efficiency to the cause of education.\n\nThe old subscription schools and academies of Sussex County are remembered by many of the older people of the present day. Some of these were well conducted and are held in grateful remembrance, but time has clearly proven that this class of schools left the poorer classes without an opportunity to obtain an education, hence with the march of educational progress these institutions have disappeared, and given place to the present excellent system of free public instruction. Where the residents of a school district are intelligent and progressive, good schools are found thoroughly equipped with all the modern appliances for teaching, and accordingly an active interest is manifested in educational matters. Where this spirit is not dominant poor schools exist. It is but just to say, however, that within the past fifteen or twenty years, Sussex County has taken rapid strides in popular education; and this is shown in the increased expenditures from year to year for school purposes; and in the growing popularity of the free school system.\n\nCIVIL LIST FOR SUSSEX COUNTY.\n\nProthonotariet.\n\nNehemiah Field . . . 1694-1730\n\nPhillip Russell . . . 1730-1753\n\nRyves Holt . . . 1753-1763\n\nJacob Kollock . . . 1763-1777\n\nDavid Hall . . . 1777-1788\n\nNathaniel Mitchell . . . 1788-1805\n\nFrancis Brown . . . 1805-1825\n\nJohn Stockley . . . 1825-1830\n\nGeorge R.
