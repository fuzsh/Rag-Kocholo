He enjoyed golf and participating in many fundraising tournaments. The gift of a lemon donut or peanut butter cups would be sure to make him smile with delight.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife, Sharon Cyr; and his children, Laurie Bradbury and husband, Arthur, Patricia Pattow and husband, Jeff, Dwayne Cyr and partner, Cathy James, Marianne Cyr and partner, Joe LeBlanc. He was his children’s first and always enduring hero.\n\nHe is also survived by his step-children, Scott and Brenda Seavey, Sean and Victoria Seavey, Mark and Sherri Albanese; grandchildren and great-grandchildren, Brian and Christie Tatro, Zackary Pattow, Myles Bradbury, wife, Rene and son, Maverick, Melanie and Nicholas Cyr; step-grandchildren, Jacob, Amy, Joseph, and Madeline Seavey, Abigail Rogers, Nicolas Rogers, and Brandon Albanese; and godchild, Colleen Carney.\n\nRodney is survived by his sister, Claudette Krisko.
