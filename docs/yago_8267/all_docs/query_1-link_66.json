The state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control was investigating Mon- day whether the sulfur-like smells were caused repair work on the plant's first-stage refining unit, idled by fire before dawn Friday. \"We feel that when they started it back up, there was still some leakage,\" said Don White, a spokesman for Delaware's By JEFF MONTGOMERY Staff reporter ATH WAT ATTA Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.

Natural Resources and Environmental Control officials logged 10 complaints about odors from the plant on Saturday and 11 on Sunday .\n\nMotiva could face fines of $50 to $500 for each of the offenses. Wind and unusual weather conditions might have pumped some of the odors north as well.

Diner: Apartments could help add I to bottom line FROM PAGE B1 The brick-and-stucco building would include 10 apartments on the second and third floors. The ground floor would serve as a covered parking area .\n\nThis design will save the diner's existing parking spaces. But that might not be enough to meet city requirements for the apartments. If so, Schwab might request a waiver. The designers also plan to meet with adjacent property owners to discuss combining several small parking lots into one large lot, the plans say. Built in the 1950s on a former gas station site, the diner has had several owners and names, including Hollywood Diner, Jimmy's Diner and Jude's Diner .\n\nThe diner closed several months ago. \"I'd say it has to be Newark's most favored nostalgic landmark,\" said Bob Thomas, president of the Newark Historical Society. Thomas said the possible loss of the old diner building is sad, but he understands economics prevail. \"I don't think it's fair to tell the \"I'd say it has to be Newark's most favored 99 nostalgic landmark,\" Bob Thomas, president of the Newark Historical Society owner he can't make changes if the community doesn't support\" the business. The redevelopment plans also call for the demolition of the kitchen and construction of a new one .\n\nThe seating area also would be rearranged so it i is accessible to disabled people. One reason leasing the restaurant is difficult is because the interior is outdated, Schwab said. \"We like the fact that it's a landmark to Newark,\" he said. \"The thing is how do we financially appease all those involved.\" Reach Charlotte Hale at chale Do you have the power to protect her?
