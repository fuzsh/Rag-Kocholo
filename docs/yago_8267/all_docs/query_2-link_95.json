        "text": "The man charged with second-degree murder in the Jan. 11, 2017 death of Rodney Wailing has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.\n\nDaniel Forest was originally charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of Wailing. Forest pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter last week at Court of Queen's Bench. He'll be back at the same court in September for a contested sentencing hearing.\n\nDaniel Forest to stand trial in beating death of 45-year-old Rodney Wailing\n\nPolice found Wailing in his home on the 200 block of Avenue I South after responding to reports of an injured man. Wailing died in hospital.\n\nForest had been sought as a person of interest in the case, and eventually turned himself into police.\n\n​Defence lawyer Brian Pfefferle says he ordered a Gladue report as part of the sentencing.\n\nThe Gladue principle, which arose from a 1999 Supreme Court decision, says judges should consider an Indigenous offender's personal background — for example, a history of substance abuse, poverty, victimization, or experience in residential schools or the child welfare system — in sentencing.\n\nGladue reports provide the court with background about those personal circumstances, and also suggest alternatives to jail."
