Under his direction, basic procedures and techniques, including proper levels of supervision, were drilled into the Battalion Group. The result of his efforts was a highly disciplined unit ready to meet the challenges on the streets of Kabul. Chief Warrant Officer Bradley's steadfast leadership and dedication became evident in the aftermath of the two hostile attacks that resulted in the death of three of the Battalion Group's soldiers. His remarkable performance during this highly stressful period exemplified the reputation of the Canadian Forces within a widely diverse international environment."
