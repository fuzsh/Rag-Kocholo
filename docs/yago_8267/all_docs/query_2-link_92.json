        "text": "Rodney Daniels, 48, has been arrested by police in South Fulton, Georgia, charged in connection with the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Patricia “Tricia” Moreno in 1991.\n\nMoreno was shot in the head around 3 a.m. on July 20, 1991, and died about 12 hours later at Massachusetts General Hospital, Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan announced during a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMoreno was shot on a third-floor fire escape attached to a Department of Children & Families (DCF) foster home on Henry Street in Malden, where she had been living for about two months, the district attorney said.\n\nRyan said Daniels was in a relationship with one of Moreno’s foster sisters and occasionally stayed at the home. She said there had been arguments between Daniels and Moreno leading up to the shooting. Daniels is now married, Ryan said.\n\nDaniels had engaged in threatening behavior toward Moreno in the weeks before her death. Numerous parties were interviewed over the course of many years but no arrest was made in the case, according to Ryan.\n\nPolice noted that there was no evidence of forced entry into the home and that those in the apartment, who claimed that they had heard a pair of gunshots, could provide no information as to the identity of the shooter. Police also noted that Daniels had been in possession of multiple handguns around the same time of the murder.\n\nDuring the subsequent investigation police interviewed Daniels, who claimed that he had been sleeping in an armchair in the living room when he was awakened by the sound of two gunshots. He told police that he subsequently walked out onto the fire escape which is where he saw Moreno. Moreno’s foster mother then called for police and an ambulance.\n\nDaniels was arrested at his home in Georgia without incident by Massachusetts State Police Detectives assigned to the Middlesex District Attorney’s Office, Malden Police detectives and the City of South Fulton Police in Georgia with the assistance of their Metro South Swat Team.\n\nHe was arraigned in Georgia as a fugitive from justice and is being transported back to Massachusetts to be arraigned at the Middlesex Superior Court on Thursday.\n\n“After three decades we have taken the first steps today to hold accountable the person who we allege took Tricia’s life. It is always with mixed emotions that we make these announcements as we know this will not fill the void caused by the loss of a daughter, a sister and a friend to many,” Ryan said."
