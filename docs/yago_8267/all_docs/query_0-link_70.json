He became one of the foremost citizens of the State in his day, and ably filled many public positions of great honor and trust. He was a member of the Council of Safety in 1776, served under Washington as captain of the Dover Light Horse, was a member of the Delaware Constitutional Convention of 1776, and also a delegate from Delaware to the convention that framed the Constitution of the United States. He was chosen United States Senator in 1789, but resigned September 6, 1793, upon his appointment to the Chief Justiceship of the Court of Common Pleas, holding that office until 1799, when he was elected Governor of Delaware. He resigned his position in 1801, and President Adams appointed him United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, which then comprised the States of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.\n\nLate in life he became a convert to Methodism, and thereafter devoted a great part of his energies to the promotion of that cause. The eloquent Abel Stevens, L.L.D., in his history of American Methodism, referring to his residence on Bohemia Manor as one of his three homes, where the great Asbury found a refuge and a warm hospitality in the early days of Methodism when the sharp persecution of the great bishop threatened his liberty, if not his life, says:\" We may also mention the late Richard Bassett, Esq., well known as a distinguished character not only in this State but in the United States. At different times he filled high and honorable stations. He was a lawyer of note, a legislator, judge, and a Governor of Delaware.\"\n\nJudge Bassett died in 1815 at his home on Bohemia Manor, and was buried by the side of his son-in-law, the Hon. James Bayard, who had died but a few days before.\n\n[History of the State of Delaware by Henry C. Conrad, Volume III, Published by the Author, Wilmington, Delaware, 1908, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nMore . . .\n\nRichard Bassett\n\nThe Founding Fathers: Delaware\n\nBassett (Basset) was born in Cecil County, MD., in April 1745. After his tavern-keeper father deserted his mother, he was reared by a relative, Peter Lawson, from whom he later inherited Bohemia Manor (MD.) estate. He read for the law at Philadelphia and in 1770 received a license to practice in Dover, DE. He prospered as a lawyer and planter, and eventually came to own not only Bohemia Manor, but homes in Dover and Wilmington as well.\n\nDuring the Revolution, Bassett captained a troop of Dover cavalry militia and served on the Delaware council of safety. Subsequently, he participated in Delaware's constitutional convention and sat in both the upper and lower houses of the legislature. In 1786 he represented his state in the Annapolis Convention.\n\nAt the U.S. Constitutional Convention the next year, Bassett attended diligently but made no speeches, served on no committees, and cast no critical votes. Like several other delegates of estimable reputation and talent, he allowed others to make the major steps.\n\nBassett subsequently went on to a bright career in the state and federal governments. In the Delaware ratifying convention, he joined in the 30-0 vote for the Constitution. Subsequently, in the years 1789-93, he served in the U.S. Senate. In that capacity, he voted in favor of the power of the President to remove governmental officers and against Hamilton's plan for the federal assumption of state debts.\n\nFrom 1793 until 1799 Bassett held the chief justiceship of the court of common pleas. He espoused the Federalist cause in the 1790s, and served as a Presidential elector on behalf of John Adams in 1797. Two years later, Bassett was elected Governor of Delaware and continued in that post until 1801. That year, he became one of President Adams' \"midnight\" appointments as a judge of the U.S. Circuit Court. Subsequently, the Jeffersonian Republicans abolished his judgeship, and he spent the rest of his life in retirement.\n\nTwice married, to Ann Ennals and a woman named Bruff, Bassett fathered several children. He was a devout Methodist, held religious meetings at Bohemia Manor, and supported the church financially. He died in 1815 at the age of 70 and is interred at the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery, Wilmington, DE.\n\n[ The U. S.

When the revocation was signed by King Louis in XIV in 1685, by perpetual and irrevocable decree the fundamental and irrevocable edict was pronounced null and void. Places of worship were demolished and religious gatherings were forbidden. All Huguenots unwilling to convert to the Roman Catholic religion had 15 days to leave France. For the Baudouin families life in France had become unbearable. Huguenots were under the threat of certain death if they stayed and did not conform. The Baudouin's were a prominent Huguenot family living in La Rochelle France, a holdout for many of the New Reformed Religion.\n\nThe final Edict had been signed and they prepared to leave their beloved land.\n\nPierre Claude Baudouin his wife Elizabeth Fixe and four children, John, James. Mary and Elizabeth left France forever. Pierre had been a Doctor of medicine in La Rochelle\n\nand lived in fine large home that was confiscated . His life in France had afforded him money enough to own a large ship used by some of the family for the maritime business.\n\nThis ship was called \"La John \"and it became the families life line. Hastily the family closed out their life in France, hired a crew, packed what they could carry and boarded that ship and sailed into the unknown long dangerous journey.\n\nDuring the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the other member of the family of Baudouin were Huguenot and also had to leave France. One of the branches of the family sought refuge in Prussia, another established themselves in the Lowlands, and a third set up in England. Pierre was the head of the branch which took roots in what became America.\n\nAfter many months sailing the rough seas Pierre Baudouin and his family landed in Dublin Ireland where they spent two years. On May 6, 1686 Pierre left the port town of Wexford with his family and is accompanied by his friend Steven Bouiteau and set out for the British Colonies. In April 1686 the family arrived at Casco Bay Maine. In December 1690 Pierre Baudouin was granted 100 acres on Banbury Creek. Only a few short years in Casco Bay Indians begun an uprising with skirmishes occurring everywhere. In 1697 feeling uneasy Pierre escapes with his family to Boston. Twenty-four hours later the Indians attack the British settlements at Casco Bay. They ravaged and burned the settlement to the ground. Every one in the settlement were massacred.\n\nThe Baudouin family arrived in Boston in 1697. They become the beginning of the Bowdoin family in America. On July 16, 1700 Pierre Baudouin is named godfather to Peter Faneuil in Boston. The Faneuil family gave Faneuil Hall to Boston in 1640.\n\nFour years after Pierre becomes godfather to Peter Faneuil he makes out his will; it is June 16,1704. Two years later he is dead. The date is September 12, 1706. His wife follows him in death on August 20, 1720. The children are grown and on their own.\n\nJohn is married to Suzanna Stokley, they move to Virginia, James stayed in Boston. James Baudouin/Bowdoin was one of the leading merchants of America and at his death in 1747 had accumulated what was the largest estate in New England. One of his sons was James Bowdoin (1726-1790) was a merchant, revolutionary leader, member of the Constitutional Convention in 1779, and governor of Massachusetts from 1785-1787. Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Main, chartered in 1794 is named in his honor. He was a delegate and was to be a signer on the deceleration of independence but because of illness was unable to attend. His son also a James ( 1752-1811) donated liberally both money and lands to BOWDOIN College. He was U.S. minister to Spain 1804-1811, and conducted negotiations in Paris with Napoleon's minister regarding the Florida purchase.\n\nBaudouin/Bowdoin connection to Queen Elizabeth II of England\n\nPierre Claude Baudouin nephew of Mathieu Baudouin Du Peux\n\nMathieu Baudouin Du Peux\n\ndaughter Marie Baudouin Du peux\n\nson in-law Alexandre Desnier d'Olbruse\n\nSon, Alexandre Desnier d'Olbruse\n\nwife, Jacquette Poussard de Vandre\n\ndaughter, Eleanore Desnier d'Olbruse\n\nson-in-law Prince William de Brunswick\n\ndaughter, Sophie Dorothee\n\nson in-law, Prince Georges Louis de Hanover = King George I\n\nson, Georges Auguste = king George II 1727-1760\n\ndaughter Sophie her husband Prince William Frederic de Prussia= Frederic The Great!\n\nGeorge III 1760-1820 he was Grandson of King George II\n\nGeorge IV 1820-1830 son of King George III\n\nWilliam IV 1830-1837 third son of King George III\n\nQueen Victoria 1837-1901 she was niece of William IV,\n\nchild of his brother, Duke of Kent\n\nEdmond VII 1901-1910 second son of George V\n\nGeorge V 1910-1936\n\nEdward abdicated 1936\n\nGeorge VI 1926-1952\n\nQueen Elizabeth II 1952-_____daughter of George VI\n\nPrince Charles & sons\n\nPrince William b. 1982 and Prince Harry b. 1984\n\nThere are many Kings and Queens the Baudouin/Bowdoin in America who are related however this list is blood related.\n\nNicholas Bayard\n\nThe Delaware Bayards are descended from Nicholas Bayard, who fled from France to Holland, and married Anneke, a sister of Stuyvesant. They had three sons, Belthazar, Peter, and Nicholas. Peter left New York, and came to Delaware with the Labadists. In 1675 he received a grant of Bombay Hook Island. Four years afterwards he purchased the right of the Indian owner, Maeesitt, Sachem of Canswick, for one gun and some other matters. From this Bayard it is believed the Bayards of Delaware are descended. Bayard street, in New York, is named after this family. The Bayards, like many of the other patriarchal Dutch Huguenot families, have well maintained their social and political standing. The family have been distinguished for great talents. Three succeeding generations of them have represented the state in the United States Senate, viz.: the celebrated James A. Bayard, who signed the treaty of Ghent, then his sons, Richard Bayard and James A. Bayard, who went there at different times, and Thomas F. Bayard, the son of the second James A. Bayard, who at the time of this writing represents the State in that body.\n\n[A History of the State of Delaware by Francis Vincent, published in Philadelphia in 1870, contributed by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nThomas F. Bayard and His Ancestors\n\nGIRARD'S TALK OF THE DAY\n\nIn the matter of United States Senatorship in Delaware, the Bayards have had it.\n\nShould Thomas F. Bayard, just nominated for that high office by the Democrats, be elected, he will take the fifth generation of his family and the fourth generation of Bayards to the Senate. More than a century ago the Bayards began their career in our highest legislative body. After the original Senator Bayard passed from the turbulent scenes of Wilmington politics into the next world, his son represented that State in the Senate.\n\nAnd while that son was still a Senator, his own son, Thomas Francis Bayard, was chosen, making the only instance in our country's history where father and son were elected United States Senators by the same Legislature.\n\nBut even before the first Bayard went to the Senate, his father-in-law, Richard Bassett, was Governor of Delaware and a United States Senator. Bassett helped frame the Constitution of the United States and as a Senator was the first to cast his vote to remove the National Capitol from Philadelphia to Washington. Hence the electors of the Blue Hen Commonwealth will decide in November if the Bayard Senatorial record shall embrace five generations and read: Great-great-grandfather, great-grandfather, grandfather, father and son.\n\nDELAWARE imported her first Bayard from Philadelphia, as James Ashton Bayard was born here eight years before the Battle of Lexington. Graduating at Princeton when seventeen, young Bayard studied law under the famous General Joseph Reed, and the still more renowned attorney, Jared Ingersoll.\n\nHe was a youth of twenty, but a member of the bar when he migrated to Wilmington. In our day we have looked upon the Delaware Bayards as Rock-bound Democrats, yet the original Bayard was no follower of Jefferson, but a strong Federalist and friend of Hamilton. However, when the House of Representatives had to choose Jefferson or Burr for President of the United States, Bayard, then a Congressman, followed his leader, Hamilton, and voted for Jefferson, thereby electing him.\n\nBayard was a supporter of Chief Justice John Marshall against the Jeffersonian policies of that day. He was in the United States Senate for some eight years and battled against the declaration of war with England in 1812.\n\nJohn Adams appointed Bayard Minister to France, but he declined it, as later he refused the Russian mission offered him by President Madison.\n\nTHE second James Ashton Bayard was born in Wilmington just a month before the death of Washington. Unlike his father, he became a Democrat, and held Federal office under President Van Buren. He first became a United States Senator in 1851; was re-elected by the Democrats in 1857 and again during the Civil War. It was then that his opposition to Lincoln's administration and his alleged sympathy for the Confederate cause welded to his name a sort of political taint-a spectre which rose to confront his more famous son in the latter's ambitious hope to go to the White House.\n\nIn 1863 the Republicans demanded that Senators take the \"iron-clad oath\" - an oath which Senator Bayard denounced as an indignity and an invasion of State rights. But he took the oath and as a protest at once resigned the Senatorship.\n\nHis successor died soon afterwards, and Bayard went back to the Senate to finish the term which expired on March 4, 1869.\n\nIn 1868 his son, Thomas Francis Bayard, was elected United States Senator by the Delaware Legislature.\n\nTHOUSANDS recall the distinguished \"Tom\" Bayard-called \"Tom\" behind his back, because I venture to assert few had the hardihood to address that austere statesman so familiarly.\n\nHe was one of the Democratic giants in the United States Senate for fifteen years, or until President Cleveland made him Secretary of State. Bayard was a full-rigged candidate for President on several occasions, but his family's alleged leaning toward the South during the Civil War was one of those intangible factors which ever stalked before the voters and loomed as a bar to his aspirations.\n\nThomas F. Bayard was a member of that famous Electoral Commission which was created to settle the question of whether Hayes or Tilden had been chosen President.\n\nAND now the democrats of Delaware have put their Senatorial standard in the hands of the present Thomas F. Bayard, who is known to a wide circle of friends as \"a quiet gentleman and scholar.\"\n\nIn this contest he will face du Pont, a family name which, like his own, has been a Delaware institution for more than a hundred years.\n\nThe Adams family gave our country two Presidents, father and son, while the Harrison family contributed two in Old Tippecanoe and his grandson, Benjamin, but so far as Congress goes the Bayards have all others left at the post.\n\n[Philadelphia Inquirer (Philadelphia, PA) Thursday, August 31, 1922, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nGunning Bedford, Jr.\n\nThe Founding Fathers: Delaware\n\nBedford was born in 1747 at Philadelphia and reared there. The fifth of seven children, he was descended from a distinguished family that originally settled in Jamestown, VA. He usually referred to himself as Gunning Bedford, Jr., to avoid confusion with his cousin and contemporary Delaware statesman and soldier, Col. Gunning Bedford.\n\nIn 1771 signer Bedford graduated with honors from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton), where he was a classmate of James Madison. Apparently while still in school, Bedford wed Jane B. Parker, who bore at least one daughter. After reading law with Joseph Read in Philadelphia, Bedford won admittance to the bar and set up a practice. Subsequently, he moved to Dover and then to Wilmington. He apparently served in the Continental Army, possibly as an aide to General Washington.\n\nFollowing the war, Bedford figured prominently in the politics of his state and nation. He sat in the legislature, on the state council, and in the Continental Congress (1783-85). In the latter year, he was chosen as a delegate to the Annapolis Convention but for some reason did not attend. From 1784 to 1789 he was attorney general of Delaware.\n\nBedford numbered among the more active members of the Constitutional Convention, and he missed few sessions. A large and forceful man, he spoke on several occasions and was a member of the committee that drafted the Great Compromise. An ardent small-state advocate, he attacked the pretensions of the large states over the small and warned that the latter might be forced to seek foreign alliances unless their interests were accommodated. He attended the Delaware ratifying convention.\n\nFor another 2 years, Bedford continued as Delaware's attorney general. In 1789 Washington designated him as a federal district judge for his state, an office he was to occupy for the rest of his life.\n\nHis only other ventures into national politics came in 1789 and 1793, as a Federalist presidential elector. In the main, however, he spent his later years in judicial pursuits, in aiding Wilmington Academy, in fostering abolitionism, and in enjoying his Lombardy Hall farm.\n\nBedford died at the age of 65 in 1812 and was buried in the First Presbyterian Churchyard in Wilmington. Later, when the cemetery was abandoned, his body was transferred to the Masonic Home, on the Lancaster Turnpike in Christiana Hundred, DE.\n\n[ The U. S. National Archives & Records Administration, Delaware's Founding Fathers at www.archives.gov, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nBENJAMIN F. BEESON.\n\nThis gentleman, one of the most prominent and successful farmers of Wayne county, whose home is in Washington township, was born on the farm where he yet resides, August n, 1824, and is a worthy representative of one of- the most distinguished pioneer families of this region, being a son of Benjamin and Dorcas (Starbuck) Beeson, natives of North Carolina, where their marriage was celebrated. The paternal grandparents were Benjamin and Phoebe Beeson, and the former was the son of Isaac Beeson, who was of the sixth generation in direct descent from Edward Beeson, the founder of the family in the New World. He was reared in Lancastershire, England, where George Fox originated the Society of Friends, and with that denomination the family became connected. Edward Beeson came to America in 16S2 with one of William Penn's colonies and located first in Pennsylvania, later removed to a Quaker settlement in Virginia, and subsequently to one near Wilmington, Delaware. He had four sons, Edward, Richard, Isaac and William. Of these Isaac went to North Carolina, and from him the Indiana branch of the family is descended. They continued their connection with the Society of Friends until coming to this state, but finally left it, and they wished to be more enterprising and progressive than accorded with the customs of that sect. However, they still adhered to the good religious qualities of the Friends' church, doing all the good possible and as little harm. Three brothers came to Indiana: Isaac settled near Richmond, Wayne county in 1812; Benjamin located where our subject now resides, in 1814, and Thomas, on first coming to the county in 1818, lived with Benjamin for a few years and then bought the farm where his son, Elwood, now resides. Although they came here in limited circumstances, they were soon in possession of comfortable competencies, secured by their enterprise, energy, industry and perseverance, and, in advancing their own interests, did much toward the building up and beautifying of their adopted county. They also won the respect and confidence of the entire community.\n\nBenjamin Beeson, father of our subject, was a blacksmith and wagon-maker by trade, and before leaving North Carolina made himself a good wagon, in which he brought his family to this state with a four-horse team. While on the road he sold the wagon and after his arrival in Wayne county returned it to the purchaser in Tennessee and rode his horses back to Indiana.\n\nIn 1813 he had come to this section of the state and selected his tract of land, which he entered at Cincinnati. On bringing his family here the following year he left them with his brother Isaac while he delivered the wagon. On his return he erected a cabin upon his place, and began the arduous task of clearing and improving the wild land, which he at length transformed into a fine farm. He soon found out that eighty acres adjoining his one-hundred-and-sixty-acre tract was for sale, and as he desired it and had no money, he again went to Tennessee, where he was able to borrow the needed money, at twenty-five per cent. For three years he made a trip to that state to pay the interest and was then able to cancel the debt. His family assisted him in every possible way, spinning, weaving and making all the clothes needed, and as prosperity crowned their combined efforts the boundaries of the farm were extended from time to time, and the father was at length able to give to all of his children a good home. He was ever a friend to the poor and needy, was charitable and benevolent, and the latch-string of his cabin was always out. Many an early settler has been aided by him, and in assisting in opening up the country to civilization Wayne county owes to him a debt of gratitude which can never be repaid. In connection with general farming, he engaged in stock-raising, and in early days drove his hogs to Cincinnati, while he went to Lawrenceburg on the Ohio river to mill. He was a strong Democrat in politics, and most acceptably served as justice of the peace for many years, his decisions being always final. When he had a log-rolling his neighbors would come from far and near without his notifying them as he was held in high regard by the entire community and had a host of warm friends. Although he was a member of no religious denomination he led an upright, honorable life and will certainly reap the reward of the just. For many years he suffered with one of his legs, and as amputation was at length necessary he made his will, giving everything to his wife, and prepared to die if the operation was not successful. He lived only a month after it was performed, dying March i, 1852, at the age of sixty-four years. His wife survived him many years and passed away in October, 1872. She was a devoted wife and affectionate mother. To this worthy couple were born eleven children, the birth of the first two occurring in North Carolina, the others in Indiana. They were as follows: Bezaleel; Othniel; Templeton; Delilah, wife of John Patterson; Rachel, wife of James Harvey; Gulelma, wife of William Dick; Cinderella, wife of William Harvey; Benjamin F., our subject; Amanda M., wife of Thomas Emerson; Mark D., a prominent farmer of Wayne county; and Charles, who died in 1852. Only three are now living: our subject, Mark D. and Mrs. Dick, of Kansas.\n\nBenjamin F. Beeson, of this review, was reared on the farm where he still resides, and obtained his education in the subscription schools which he attended for three months during the winter season. The school-house was a primitive structure, built of logs, with a puncheon floor, and seats also of puncheons, with pegs for legs. He remained at home until his marriage, in January, 1848, when he located upon a tract of new land given him by his father, and during the four years he resided there he placed eighty acres under cultivation, and built thereon a commodious residence, to replace the little log cabin where he commenced his domestic life. He and his wife then returned to the old homestead to care for his widowed mother in her declining years. He purchased the interest of the other heirs in the place, and there continues to reside. He has cleared sixty-five acres of the two-hundred-and-forty-acre farm, erected thereon a pleasant residence, large barns and other outbuildings, and now has one of the finest improved farms of the locality. The place is conveniently located, three and a half miles south of Milton, and is adorned with a beautiful grove of ornamental trees. He has successfully engaged in both farming and stock-raising, and has bought large tracts of land, most of which he has given to his children, except one tract which he sold. He still retains the old homestead, however, and is still actively engaged in his chosen calling.\n\nIn January, 1848, Mr. Beeson married Miss Catherine Howard, who was born in Wayne county, January 22, 1827. Her parents, John and Sarah (Calaway) Howard, natives of North Carolina, came to the county about 1814 and located at Nolan's Fork, where the father entered and improved the farm now occupied by Elijah Hurst. There his children were all born, but he finally sold the place and moved to Madison county, Indiana, where he improved another farm. On disposing of that place he returned to Wayne county and bought the farm where the Valley Grove church now stands. After his children were all grown, he gave that farm to a son and bought a small piece of land in the same neighborhood, built a residence thereon and spent the remainder of his life upon that place. In politics he was a Democrat. He was three times married and by the first union had two sons: Samuel and Joseph. The latter, an able financier, died at the age of forty-eight years, leaving a fine estate. There was one son, Charles, by the last marriage. Twelve children, two sons and ten daughters, were born of the second union. The following are most of their names: Mary E., wife of N. Waymore; Sarah, wife of B. Hurst; Mrs. S. Dwiggins; Ged-dia, wife of James Thorp; Rachel, wife of E. Waymore; Cynthia, wife of A. Lowery; Catherine, wife of our subject; John A., a resident of Franklin, Indiana; Neill, of Oklahoma; and Margaret, widow of M. Pursnett and a resident of Kansas. The children born to our subject and his wife were: William, who died in 1873, aged twenty-two years; Oliver H., a prominent farmer of Wayne county; Joseph F., who died in 1S73, aged eighteen years; Elizabeth, wife of Albert Williams, a farmer of Wayne county: Sanford G., who died in 1873, aged thirteen years; Elmer E., who conducts a meat market in Cambridge City; Ira J., who died in infancy; May, wife of J. Coyne, a farmer; and Minnie, wife of F. Flora. The wife and mother died April 14, 1873, her death and that of her three children occurring within four months, and being caused by spinal meningitis.\n\nMr. Beeson was again married in 1879, his second union being with Miss Kate Roadcap, who was born in Virginia, August 5, 1844, but was only eight years old when brought to Indiana by her parents, Henry and Lydia (Myres) Roadcap, also natives of the Old Dominion. Her father improved a farm in Henry county, where he still resides, at the age of eighty-four years. He is of German descent and a consistent member of the Dunkard church. After the death of Mrs. Beeson's mother he married again. His children, are: Elizabeth, wife of Milton Rains; Frances, wife of Conrad Koontz; Mary, wife of joab Rains; Barbara, wife of George Mathias; Kate, B. F. Beeson, Benjamin F., Joseph and Peter. Mr. Beeson has no children by his second marriage.\n\nPolitically, Mr. Beeson follows in the footsteps of his father and gives his support to the Democracy, and though he has often been solicited by his friends to accept office he has steadity refused, as he cares nothing lor political honors. He is very charitable, being always ready to respond to the appeals of the needy and distressed, and ever ready to pay his last respects to the dead. He is one of the most honored and highly esteemed citizens of his community, and it is safe to say that no man in Wayne county has a wider circle of friends and acquaintances than Benjamin F. Beeson. Jacob Broom\n\nThe Founding Fathers: Delaware\n\nBroom was born in 1752 at Wilmington, DE., the eldest son of a blacksmith who prospered in farming. The youth was educated at home and probably at the local Old Academy. Although he followed his father into farming and also studied surveying, he was to make his career primarily in mercantile pursuits, including shipping and the import trade, and in real estate. In 1773 he married Rachel Pierce, who bore eight children.\n\nBroom was not a distinguished patriot. His only recorded service was the preparation of maps for George Washington before the Battle of Brandywine, PA. In 1776, at 24 years of age, Broom became assistant burgess of Wilmington. Over the next several decades, he held that office six times and that of chief burgess four times, as well as those of borough assessor, president of the city \"street regulators,\" and justice of the peace for New Castle County.\n\nBroom sat in the state legislature in the years 1784-86 and 1788, during which time he was chosen as a delegate to the Annapolis Convention, but he did not attend. At the Constitutional Convention, he never missed a session and spoke on several occasions, but his role was only a minor one.\n\nAfter the convention, Broom returned to Wilmington, where in 1795 he erected a home near the Brandywine River on the outskirts of the city. He was its first postmaster (1790-92) and continued to hold various local offices and to participate in a variety of economic endeavors. For many years, he chaired the board of directors of Wilmington's Delaware Bank. He also operated a cotton mill, as well as a machine shop that produced and repaired mill machinery. He was involved, too, in an unsuccessful scheme to mine bog iron ore. A further interest was internal improvements: toll roads, canals, and bridges.\n\nBroom also found time for philanthropic and religious activities. He served on the board of trustees of the College of Wilmington and as a lay leader at Old Swedes Church. He died at the age of 58 in 1810 while in Philadelphia on business and was buried there at Christ Church Burial Ground.\n\n[ The U. S.

His primacy as her foremost citizen is indisputable whether we compare his achievements and fame with those of the great of old, or with those later worthies. No fuller-orbed name appears in all her history. He did many things eminently well, won the highest distinction in many diverse fields of thought and action. As an advocate he shone pre-eminently in the forum; as a judge, in profundity of legal and other learning and in wisdom of decree, he fully sustained the best traditions of the Bench; while as a youthful Senator at thirty-three he signalized in the United States Senate the rising of a new star of the first magnitude among that splendid galaxy of orators and statesmen who composed the senatorial zodiac of 1829. But it was as Secretary of State in President Taylor's administration in 1849 that his brilliant qualities of constructive statesmanship found for a brief period that fuller exercise for his genius which no previous field had afforded.\n\nA sketch of his life has already been given, and it remains only to recount his career as Judge of the Supreme Court of Delaware, and briefly to notice more at length one or two of his notable acts as Senator; and more especially to allude to the famous episode in American history with which his name is linked, the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty with Great Britain. The gravest injustice has been done his memory in reference to that treaty, consequent upon the cruel calumnies which most unjustly assailed him living, and which indeed hastened his untimely death. No history of Delaware should fail to do justice herein to this illustrious son of hers, as a duty due alike to him and his State, and the cause of historic truth as well. As Chief Justice John M. Clayton added to the high fame he had already won as a lawyer, and an advocate, although the brief period, less than three years, in which he exercised his judicial functions, and the restricted arena of his own little State, together with the smallness and paucity of the issues involved, gave him but slight opportunity to make any adequate display of his extensive erudition and skill and experience as a jurist.\n\nHad it been his good fortune, like another Hardwicke or Marshall, to have urged his judicial career in some formative period of the law, and in a forum fitted to evoke his best powers, he would have won a high position among the world's great creative jurists. The late Chief Justice Comegys, who, as a youth, read law in his office, and knew him well, pays him the following tribute: \"As a judge he could not have had a superior in any respect. He had legal learning; quickness and acuteness of perception; great patience to hear; an entire freedom from prejudice or passion, and an impartiality remarkable in one so fresh from bitter political contests. He resigned after he had held the place for nearly three years, and no writ of error was ever taken from any of the court's decisions during his time.\" his longest opinion, and if not the most important one he ever wrote, certainly the one best calculated to exhibit his great and versatile erudition, was in the case of State vs. Thomas Jefferson Chandler, 2 Harrington, 553, in which the defendant was charged with having publicly spoken a vulgar blasphemy upon our Savior. As a desperate makeshift, his counsel sought, upon the sole authority of Thomas Jefferson, whose infidel bias is well known, to impugn the historical and legal accuracy of the maxim of English and American law, which declares Christianity to be a part of the common law, a doctrine even then long settled by the adjudication of the courts of both countries. Mr. Jefferson attempted to buttress his erroneous opinion by a display of mistaken learning, wherein he alleged a mistranslation of an early Norman-French decision by Prisot, C. J., in the Year Books, upon which he mistakenly claimed the doctrine in question was founded, and had, moreover the temerity to charge the great and good Mansfield with judicial forgery. Judge Clayton, in a learned excursus into those rarely visited regions of the ancient Year Books, and far more at home among their musty lore, legal and linguistical, than Jefferson himself, and vastly his superior as a lawyer, totally confutes these assertions, and while vindicating the memory of Mansfield, impales Mr. Jefferson upon one of the horns of the dilemma of being ignorant of the well-settled fact that this maxim was much older than the decisions of Mansfield or Hale, of wilfully perverting this historical fact to have a thrust at the Christian religion!\n\nIn Tindal vs. Hudson, 2 Harr., wherein a free negro sought to hold his own child as a slave, the Chief Justice showed his hatred of slavery as an institution by refusing to permit negroes themselves to become slaveholders. The doctrine of the law relating to cattle, \"partus ventrem sequitur,\" was brutally applied to a slave mother and this child, till bought by its own father. The opinion not only does credit to the judge's humane sentiments, but is also worth citing as a fine bit of reasoning in a case of first instance. \"Humanity forbids a father to own his own child in slavery. The natural rights and obligations of the father are paramount to the acquired rights of the master; and the moment the father purchased the child these obligations and rights blended in the same person, and the child is free. It is no more master and slave, but parent and child. Humanity revolts at the idea of a parent selling his own child into slavery. We think the petitioner is entitled to his freedom.\" As a specimen of logical reasoning at once concise and clear, this opinion shows the hands of the master. The simplicity and brevity of his style is one of the ear-marks of all great literary performances, whether it be the Bible or Blackstone, Bunyan or Defoe. One notes in all his opinions the absence of that involved verbosity and technical jargon which makes much of the res judicata difficult for the profession and impossible for the laity. Observe the above brief excerpt and see if one superfluous word can be found in it!\n\nEven this short sketch should mention one extraordinary service he rendered his country while a Senator from this State, a service whose perennial benefits will prove co-equal with the life of the nation itself. Like another Hercules, single-handed and alone, and despite the vicious antagonism of President Jackson, his party and his press, he turned a river of investigation through the Augean stables of the post office department in 1831 and cleansed it of the gross corruption that had for years accumulated there. The credit for this great reform is his alone; for nearly all his associates either stood neutral, or endeavored, at the dictation of Jackson, to hamper or defeat his plans. In the course of his expose he showed thirty-six forgeries in a single document, and demonstrated to the Senate the amazing fact that the post office department from its institution at the founding of the government, until that time, December, 1831, had been administered in an unconstitutional manner, wholly at variance with the plan upon which, in the Constitution, it had been originally established. That for a period of over forty years Congress, unmindful of its rights and duties under the great charter, had allowed the Postmaster-General annually to expend millions of public moneys without warrant of law, and with no other check than his own pleasure or caprice! But he not only discovered and diagnosed this serious disease in the body politic, but like a skilful physician prescribed a remedy for its permanent cure, viz., bringing the post office department under the control of Congress, and making its expenditures dependent upon annual appropriations by Congress as the Constitution intended and provided. This total revolutionizing of this department of the government was adopted by Congress, precisely as Senator Clayton proposed, and is to-day its method of administration. He disclosed in this affair those great qualities of constructive statesmanship which he afterwards so notably employed as President Taylor's Secretary of State. But had Senator Clayton done nothing further in his public career, this single act of wise and courageous statesmanship would entitle him to be enrolled among the few great names that have signally benefited the republic.\n\nYet this piece of far-reaching statecraft was but a large copy of what he had done for his own State many years before when as Auditor of Public Accounts, he brought order and system out of the chaos that had previously reigned in the conduct of that office, and established therein the orderly accurate business methods which to this day prevail. Space is wanting to tell how in 1832, Senator Clayton repeatedly warned the Senate and the Jackson administration of the deadly consequences which their monetary policies would entail, picturing in his earnest words on the floor of the Senate, with startling prevision the awful calamities which afterwards befell in the panic of 1837. During his entire service in the Senate, he had been honored with the first gift in the power of that body, the chairmanship of its Judiciary Committee. His valuable services in that capacity have already been recounted; and it remains only to narrate at best an outline of the most important act in President Taylor's administration, wherein as Secretary of State he drew up and negotiated the famous Clayton and Bulwer Treaty, one of the half-dozen great compacts ratified by the United States since that of John Jay, its first.\n\nIn 1786 a few English traders got from Spain, then sovereign of nearly all of South America, permission to cut mahogany and logwood on the coast of Honduras, but upon the express condition that no settlements should be made, nor any claims of title asserted. But with characteristic British greed, and in shameful and repeated violations of her solemn treaties, England kept the foothold thus gained, and in a half-century thriftily managed to juggle this wood-chopping license, and her subsequent wanton trespass, into a right in fee, and called the region British Honduras. Again, for over fifty years before the making of the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty, this same land grabbing England had been engaged in seeking, under the thin pretense of a \"protectorate\" of the ''Mosquito Coast,\" yet further to extend these usurped possessions of hers in Central America, and more especially to get control of the then mooted Nicaragua Canal. Mosquitia, or Mosquito Coast, was a narrow strip of land along the northeast coast of Nicaragua, and occupied by a handful of brutalized, mongrel savages of the lowest type, called Zamboes. The territory belonged rightfully to Nicaragua. The project of a canal throughout the narrow isthmus that unites North and South America, though not like that of the Suez, dating back to the Pharoahs, was as old as the time of Philip II of Spain to whom it was suggested by Galvas, a Portuguese.\n\nCalifornia was then approaching the meridian splendor of her marvelous development; thousands were pouring into her territory which then occupied the entire Pacific coast clean to British America, truly in size and resources a new Western empire. But her isolation was as complete as that of the Philippines to-day, aye more so, for a vast, unexplored, impassable wilderness lay between her and the East. Railroads west of the Mississippi, there were none, and even the hardy pioneer Fremont had not yet pierced the terra incognita of the \"Great West;\" while the wildest enthusiast had not dreamed of a transcontinental railway. The interoceanic canal at Nicaragua was then deemed the quickest and the best means of reaching California and the whole Pacific coast, and had at that time an importance purely local to the United States that far transcends its international importance now. Instigated by England, this savage puppet \"King\" of Mosquitia, whose ''crowning\" at Jamaica, West Indies, in 1815, under English auspices, was more grotesque than any opera bouffe ever was, had fraudulently stretched his \"Kingdom\" some hundred or more miles down the Costa-Rican coast until his usurpation included the banks of the San Juan river where the canal must pass. Next the English government benevolently seized the town and renamed it Greytown. These acts of open, audacious spoilation of a helpless state in our own hemisphere and a territory too, of such strategic importance, were justly deemed a menace to the United States, and a direct blow at the Monroe Doctrine; and aroused deep resentment throughout the land. President Polk''s administration had just closed, and the Van Hise imbroglio, adding fuel to the flames, had brought the country to the very verge of war with England. This was the situation when Secretary Clayton, as President Taylor's \"Premier\" took the portfolio of State. War was imminent, and this deep feeling of anger at the atrocious course of England was hourly augmenting and might any moment burst all bounds, and coerce a bloody arbitrament of the question.\n\nSecretary Clayton's first act was to undo the folly of Van Hise, as promptly as Lincoln receded from the untenable position of the seizure of Mason and Slidell by Commander Wilkes. Next he invited to a conference Sir Henry Bulwer, England's most experienced and renowned diplomat, who had been sent to this country to settle, if possible, the grave questions between our land and his own. But at the very moment when Secretary Clayton was honorably seeking a peaceful adjustment of the difficulty, the English government with its customary punic faith, was engaged in making further seizures of territory adjacent to the projected water-way, viz., an island in the gulf of Fonseca dominating the Pacific entrance, and when the United States in justifiable self-defence retaliated by taking possession of Tigre island, an armed expedition, commanded by English officers, seized the island under a pretended claim of debt. The situation had grown yet more critical; the sword of war was hanging by but a single Damocles' thread, and Secretary Clayton must act quickly. He framed a short treaty of nine articles not less comprehensive than clear in its provisions, in which each nation disclaimed all rights of exclusive control of the canal and guaranteed its neutrality, etc., etc. After a careful consideration of the treaty in every particular by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, of which Senator William R. King was chairman and Webster and several other leading Senators, members; and after a full explanation in open Senate of it and every circumstance connected with its negotiation by the Secretary, it was ratified by the Senate by a vote of 42 to 12.\n\nFinding that her astute veteran diplomatist, Sir Henry Bulwer, like Napoleon, after a long series of triumphs, had met his Waterloo at the hands of the American Secretary of State, the British government, to escape the disastrous consequences of her own solemn treaty act, at once entered upon a course of perfidious evasion and contemptible quibbling that is probably without a parallel save in the disgraceful history of her own diplomacy. Thus, through the shameless pettifogging of England, the purposes of this great treaty were rendered nugatory, and its plain provisions made the occasion of over a half-century of dishonest trickery and chicanery which only ceased upon its abrogation in 1902. But it accomplished one highly useful end, viz., it averted a bloody war between the two nations. England had abundant occasion for chagrin in the utter drubbing administered her pet statesman Bulwer. Secretary Clayton found that nation, after sixty-four years of fraud and force, intrenched in Central America, and in possession of territory as completely dominating both the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the future canal, as the Gibralter does the Mediterranean, and left her completely ousted from all her vantage ground, and that, too, by the voluntary act of her own first diplomat especially commissioned as Minister Extraordinary to the United States for that purpose. And yet as an equivalent for this large surrender of such advantages upon the part of England, Secretary Clayton did not yield one iota for his own country. What the outwitted Bulwer thought was a concession, was in reality what had been since the time of Washington the traditional policy of this Government with reference to the interoceanic canal, repeatedly re-affirmed by the Presidents and cabinets of both parties, and even so late as 1894 announced by President Cleveland. T his traditional policy was a purpose to share with all the nations the benefits and the control of the great international highway. The present policy of an exclusive control of the present route for such a canal, represents a much later doctrine and national purpose.\n\nSecretary Clayton returned to his home in the summer of 1850, consequent upon the death of President Taylor. In January, 1850, Senator Cass, of Michigan, aided and abetted by Senators Mason of Virginia and Douglas of Illinois, made an attack upon the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, and besides misrepresenting its character and purposes, grossly assailed and vilified its author, the late Secretary Clayton personally, boldly declaring that not only had the Secretary been outwitted by the English diplomat, Sir Henry L. Bulwer, but that he had deceived the Senate into ratifying the treaty by withholding a secret agreement with Sir Henry, which in effect betrayed his own country into the hands of England. These attacks upon Mr. Clayton were as cowardly in manner as they were false in matter. Cass and the rest knew that he could illy meet these lying accusations in the only forum then open to him, the public prints; and they moreover thought themselves safe in their contemptible course, for the Delaware Legislature had just failed through a political deadlock to choose a Senator. But they little knew the high patriotism of Mr. Clayton's State, and her just pride in her distinguished son; for when he requested an opportunity to meet his traducers upon the floor of the Senate, this hopelessly-tied Legislature was forthwith summoned in special session, and Senator Clayton triumphantly returned to the Senate from which he had previously resigned, and for which before the arising of this emergency, though strongly importuned, he had refused to be again a candidate.\n\nThis disinterested act upon the part of the Legislature of Delaware, especially of the Democrats who really held the key to the situation, in choosing a United States Senator of the opposite party, is a unique illustration of lofty state pride and patriotism without a fellow in the history of American politics, and justly reflects great honor upon this State and its people. On March 8, 1853, Senator Clayton, in presence of a highly interested auditory of his fellow Senators, made the first of a series of brilliant addresses in which he fully vindicated the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty, of which he was the author, and as completely refuted the base slanders cast upon his official and personal conduct in connection therewith. These speeches were characterized by an amount and variety of exact learning upon every phase, ancient and modern, of the whole lengthy episode that was marvelous. His calumniators found, as Sir Henry Bulwer to his chagrin already had, that Senator Clayton was conversant with every detail of the complicated affairs of the Central American States, and British Honduras in their relations to Great Britain; with their geography, together with the history of the tortuous diplomacy of England for nearly three-quarters of a century in that behalf. With biting sarcasm he twitted some of his senatorial assailants as \"learned Thebans\" for confounding Mexico, and even New Granada as parts of Central America. He showed, by the letter of Vice-President William R. King, Chairman in 1850 of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, that the charges of duplicity towards the Senate were totally and maliciously false, or as Senator King wrote, \"cruelly untrue.\"\n\nThe animus of the whole affair was the wish by Cass and his fellow conspirators to make political capital out of the charges, and thus injure the Whig party; although Cass had also a purely personal motive prompting his act, viz., a desire to revenge himself upon Senator Clayton for helping defeat his darling ambition to reach the great seat. Senator Clayton was probably the only eminent public man who in his day was not infected with an insane desire to be President. Clay, Webster, Douglas, Cass, Calhoun, etc., etc., had the disease dreadfully. So these monstrous accusations against as loyal and as disinterested a patriot as ever eminently served his country, were fulminated again and again in the Senate, then printed by the authority of Cass himself, and taken up the whole country over by as rabid a partisan press as ever basely sought ''to make the worse appear the better reason,\" till the land was deluged with the cunningly fabricated calumnies. Then the changes, with new falsehoods added, were rung upon the charges by every political huckster in the campaign, till what with the spoken and the printed lies, this remarkable piece of political conspiracy, as adroit as mendacious, has acquired an immortality truly diabolical.\n\nSo, too, despite the fact that the victim of this conspiracy had torn to shreds the whole garment of cunning lies, for base partisan purposes the wretched calumnies were uttered a second time in the Senate, in the winter of 1853; and although Senator Clayton again drove the slander-mongers in confusion before him, yet, amazing as it may seem, those stale \"campaign lies\" were for the third time, and, if possible, with increased ferocity, repeated in the year 1856 upon the floor of the Senate, and Senator Clayton was forced to leave the sickbed to which he was soon to return for aye, to face for the third time his implacable tormentors, and to repel, as he superbly did, their lying attacks upon his good name and fame.\n\nExcept perhaps the long-continued and bitter pursuit of Washington himself by the like slander-assassins of his day, no man in public life was ever more unjustly and persistently beset by mendacity and hate than Senator Clayton; and stranger still these oft-repeated slanders of Cass and Douglas, reiterated, in the very teeth of refutation \"strong as proof of Holy Writ,\" in the hustings, and sown broadcast by a venal press, have come to possess such a semblance of truth as to be yet taken by thousands of intelligent readers for historic verity. Indeed, a recent cyclopedia, edited by one of the first editorial writers in the country, in an article on the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, revamps these exploded lies of Cass as the actual facts in the case. The truth is that probably no treaty ever framed by this nation was drawn with more scrupulous care and prevision, indeed, with what would seem in advance of the subsequent actual occurrence, an absurd excess of caution, the adroit Secretary had the word \"occupy\" defined before the signing of the treaty, as intending a present as well as a future meaning. Than Secretary Clayton none knew better the quibbling, dishonest diplomacy of England, and so tightly did he close every loop-hole, that an evasion of the plain provisions and purposes of the instrument drawn by him, was only possible by such a course of downright dishonorable refusal by Great Britain to abide by their own solemn treaty obligations, coupled with a silly crucifixion of the English language, as amounted to a national shame.\n\nHear what his most distinguished contemporaries had to say about this great piece of statesmanship, words of eulogy pronounced over his ashes in the very Senate chamber where but a few days before, even then a dying man, he had made his last masterly defence of his work and name. The great Seward spoke this lofty eulogium upon it. ''The first universal fact, a fact indicating an ultimate union of the nations, was the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty. It was the felicitous good-fortune of John M. Clayton, not more than his genius and ability that enabled him to link his own name with that great and stupendous transaction, and so win for himself the eternal gratitude of future generations not only in his own country, but throughout the great divisions of the earth. \"The eminent lawyer and statesman, Reverdy Johnson of Maryland, said : \"This treaty is the first instance within my knowledge in which two great nations of the earth have thus endeavored to combine peacefully for the prosecution and accomplishment of an object which when completed must advance the happiness and prosperity of all men.\" Senator Henry Wilson, afterwards Vice-President, said in congressional debate, ''The Senator from Delaware, as the negotiator of the treaty on the part of the United States government entered upon that service inspired with the sublime conception and generous purposes that the grandeur and magnitude of such an occasion was calculated to inspire. That he entered upon the work with the high and patriotic object of framing a treaty which should confer lasting benefits upon our own country and the world, none can doubt.\"\n\nAgain Senator John J. Crittenden of Kentucky, said February 25, 1856, in Congress, \"I consider that the negotiation of this treaty was the highest honor of which any statesman might well be proud.\" And even Senator Cass, chief of his relentless traducers, admitted with unblushing self-stultification in one of his attacks, \"that the Clayton and Bulwer Treaty if carried out in good faith would peaceably do the work of the Monroe Doctrine, and free an important portion of our continent from foreign interference.\" It was no fault of Secretary Clayton's that a measure so expansive in its world-wide philanthropy and so humanely fostering peaceful commerce and international brotherhood as to elicit such eulogies, should be aborted and defeated in much of its intended benefits by the dishonorable conduct of one of the signatory nations; and still less any fault of his that by the irony of fate, because of the now recognized seismic character of the Nicaraguan route, the great project that gave birth to this famous treaty, the Nicaraguan Canal will never be realized ; but it will, nevertheless, ever remain an imperishable monument of the far-seeing wisdom and earnest patriotism of the great brain that conceived and the bold heart that executed this noble specimen of statesmanship.\n\n[History of the State of Delaware by Henry C. Conrad, Volume III, Published by the Author, Wilmington, Delaware, 1908, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nHISTORY OF CHENEY CLOW. (1734-1788)\n\nFrom our earliest infancy, we are taught to look to our war of independence, for examples of the purest self-devotion, and most exalted patriotism, which ever adorned the pages of a nation's history. Upon the brilliant actions of our ancestors, in that memorable struggle, time has set his seal; and admiring millions of their grateful sons, daily offer up at the shrine of liberty their orisons, for the perpetuation of the inestimable blessings, won by their valor, and transmitted to posterity. No one now, doubts, the high and holy motives, which impelled them to hazzard in the doubtful contest their fortunes and their lives. And the world has long since admitted the justice of their cause. Every child in the nation among the first words of his language should be learned to lisp the names of the heroes of the revolution; and be made familiar with their deeds of noble daring, in the cause of liberty and their country; that early appreciating, the worth of their inheritance, and the price paid for it, they may ever stand ready to defend it.\n\nRemoved as we are, far from those portentious days, which, as has been aptly said, \"tried men's souls,\" we can now look back, and view through the calm medium of reason, the causes which led to the revolution; and the motives which actuated the different parties, which by their conflicting opinions and actions, convulsed the infant republic, and protracted the period of the consummation of its independence. A considerable portion of the people in all sections of the country, had a different notion of the causes which led to the sanguinary contest, from that entertained by the whigs. They had been educated in the belief that England was not only the greatest nation known to the world, but that she had also been a most kind mother, - watching with anxious solicitude over the safety and welfare of the infant colonies in the days of their weakness, and that it would be the height of ingratitude, now that they began to wax strong, to rend asunder their union, cemented as it was, by the ties of consanguinity, a common language, and like manners and customs. They were proud of their paternity, and did not believe the grievances complained of by the patriots, of sufficient consequence to warrant a resort to arms for their redress. They looked upon the whigs as traitors to their king, whose supremacy they believed themselves bound, as good subjects to maintain. Many of this class, at first, took sides with England; while others entertaining the same opinions, endeavored to maintain a strict neutrality.\n\nFor a time, the war, on the part of the patriots was. Conducted solely by the aid of volunteers. But their ranks, by losses in battle and other causes, began to grow thin; and it was considered indispensable to their success, to resort to drafts from the whole body of the militia, for the purpose of filling them up again. In carrying out this system, it would of course, often happen, that the lots would fall upon some, whose hearts were with the cause of the enemy against whom they were detailed to do battle. It should not therefore be a cause of wonder, that when these were compelled to mingle in the strife, they should prefer giving their aid to that side, with which their feelings were enlisted. And it is hardly to be doubted, but that the extreme measures of coercion resorted to in many instances by the whigs, was productive of far more evil to the cause than good; fur they often made active enemies of such as would have gladly remained quietly at their homes, pursuing their ordinary domestic avocations.\n\nTwo most violent parties were thus formed among the people; wholly dissimilar in their opinions and sentiments, and uncompromising in their hostility towards each other, And it is deeply to be deplored, that in those days there were false patriots, who called themselves whigs, eager to gain a name in arms without much risk of their persons. Of such, were some militia captains and their followers, who never joined the regular army, nor sought the enemy in their serried ranks, where fame was only to be found at the point of the bayonet, or the cannon's mouth; but whose time was wholly occupied in hunting and persecuting the unarmed and powerless, and commonly unresisting royalists. These were not of the heroes of the revolution; and to them and their memory we owe neither gratitude, nor veneration. When the tories as they were called, were attacked in their homes, when their property was pillaged and destroyed by these pretended patriots, they would some times attempt defending themselves. Upon which they were proclaimed traitors to their country - informations lodged against them in the criminal courts for treason, - and their persons dragged forward for trial. Indictments for treason were found against many of them; all of whom we believe were acquitted.\n\nAmong the cases alluded to above, there was one which from its sad consequences, seems to deserve recording, as a warning in all time to come, against the indulgence of party animosity, by which, reason is often dethroned, and blind unthinking vengeance rules in her stead. Even in our days of law and good government, in our calm moments of reflection, we are compelled to own to ourselves, that party feeling sometimes makes the best of us unjust. How much greater then, must have been its influence, when life and living were staked on the issue, and the only arbiter was the sword. No wonder then, that wrong and oppression sometimes took place in the sacred name of liberty. The case we mean, is that of Cheney Clow; against whom, in 1782 a charge of treason was made in the court at Dover, for Kent county; in pursuance of which a warrant for his arrest was issued, directed to John Clayton, Esq., then sheriff of said county. The sheriff having been informed that Clow had notice of the proceedings against him, and well knowing his character for courage, apprehended difficulty in arresting him, and therefore called to Lis assistance a considerable number of persons, whom he caused to be well armed, and proceeded at night to the house of Clow, which was situated in the forest of Kent about twelve miles from Dover. When he arrived there, he found the door closed and barred against his entrance. He made himself and his business known, and commanded Clow to open the door and surrender himself a prisoner. The summons was answered by the discharge from the house, of several muskets, none of which how ever took effect. The sheriff and some of his party immediately commenced in earnest to break down the door, with axes, and whatever other means was in their power, some using the buts of their guns for that purpose, while in the mean time those in the rear continued constantly firing at every part of the house where they supposed a ball might enter. The assailed during this time fired many shots in such rapid succession against the party, that they supposed he had gathered for his defence a number of friends. During the contest, a musket ball passed quite through the body of a man by the name of Moore, belonging to the sheriffs party, of which he died immediately; and another was wounded slightly, in the neck, the ball first striking the brass of his bayonet belt and glancing in that direction; by which circumstance it was supposed his life was saved. At length the door gave way; and the sheriff and his party rushed into the house, (over bedsteads, barrels, boxes, chairs and other lumber, with which the entrance had been barricaded,) seized and secured the delinquent. They were considerably surprized to find within, no one save Clow and his wife. She had as it appeared been moulding bullets, and there was then lead melting over the fire for the purpose of continuing that occupation. From the quick succession of shots fired by Clow, it was supposed that his wife kept constantly loading guns (of which several were found,) up to the time when their bullets gave out. She had received a serious wound in the breast, of which she made no complaint; nor did it impede her efforts to assist her husband in his defence. A fond, devoted, and confiding wife; she did not stop to consider the justice of the cause, but resigned herself to live or die with him, who, what ever he might be in the estimation of others, was more than all the world to her. Clow now asked permission to dress himself, which Mr. Clayton readily granted. He put on a full suit of British uniform, such as was then worn by captains in their army, and expressed his readiness to set off for his prison. The sheriff then secured him on a horse, placed him in the midst of his company and started in the direction of Dover.\n\nWhen about half way from Clow's house to Dover, the sheriff and his company, were confronted by a furious militia captain and his troop of horse. The captain demanded his prisoner from Mr. Clayton, and swore he would hang him on the next tree. But Mr. Clayton, who was as brave as generous, determined to maintain the supremacy of the civil power against the military arrogance of the officer alluded to, and for which he was famous, and refused to deliver his prisoner to his hands. The sheriff was nobly supported by his men, and the discomfitted captain had to depart without effecting his sanguinary purpose. A violent quarrel was the consequence, between the civil and military officers, which was never made up during their lives. Mr. Clayton was justly indignant at the conduct of this lawless leader, who had thus openly avowed his intention to commit a murder on the body of his prisoner. The prisoner shortly after this interruption, was lodged securely in jail to await his trial.\n\nA court of Oyer and Terminer was called expressly for the purpose of the trial of Clow, and held at Dover on the tenth day of December 1782, before William Killen and David Finney, justices of said court. An indictment for treason was found by the grand jury against the prisoner, and he was placed at the bar of the court for trial. He plead not guilty - exhibited a captain's commission in the British army, and placed himself upon the footing of a prisoner of war. He was acquitted. But so great was the excitement of the multitude against him, (of which feeling it is supposed the court in some degree participated,) that they demanded a continuance of his imprisonment; which it is thought was the cause of the following sentence which appears in the record, immediately after the entry of his acquittal. \"Whereupon, it is considered by the court here, that the prisoner enter into a recognizance in the sum of ten thousand pounds, with two sureties, in the sum of five thousand pounds each, conditioned for the good behaviour of the said Cheney Clow, during the continuance of the war: that he pay the costs of prosecution, and stand committed until this judgment is complied with!\" The amount of bail demanded, and the order of the court that he should pay the costs, precluded all possibility of his enlargement; for he was a poor man, and such friends as he had, were in like circumstances. While he was still detained in prison, his enemies fatally bent on his destruction, having failed to effect their purpose in his trial for treason, prefered against him a charge for the murder of Moore.\n\nAgain a court of Oyer and Terminer was called, and held before William Killen and John Jones, justices of said court, at Dover on the fifth day of May 1783; at which Cheney Clow was indicted by the grand jury, for the murder of Moore. The record of the trial and conviction, is in the following words: -\n\n\"The prisoner being brought to the bar and charged upon the indictment aforesaid, pleads not guilty; and for trial, puts himself upon God and his country, and Gunning Bedford, Esquire, attorney general, who follows for the said Delaware State in like manner. Whereupon, came a jury by the sheriff empannelled and returned to wit: - Rich'd. Banning, George Saxton, Caleb Furbee, Henry Bell, Robert M'Clyment, Thomas Emory, Ja's. Johnson, Ferdinand Casson, Waitman Furbee, John Brown, John Cole and Nathan Pratt, good and lawful men, who being tried, chosen, sworn and affirmed to say the truth in and upon the premises, do say, that they find Cheney Clow, the prisoner at the bar, is guilty of the murder whereof he stands indicted, and so they say all. Whereupon, it is considered by the court here, that the said Cheney Clow be taken from the place from whence he came, and from thence to the place of execution, and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead.\"\n\nWhile the trial was proceeding, a Col. Pope officiously drew up a troop of horse before the court house, with a view, it was thought, of intimidating the jury; while a general clamor was raised out of doors for his conviction.\n\nClow undertook to defend himself on the grounds, that it was not proved that Moore was killed by him; that if he was, it was by accident and without malice, while defending himself; and that such killing could not be considered murder, even if proved against him; as he was at the time a British officer, and had the right to defend himself to the last extremity, against the citizens or soldiers of any other nation, who offered to deprive him of his liberty.\n\nThe evidence given by John Clayton, Esq., the sheriff, at the trial, was sufficient in itself to have insured Clow's acquittal, had due weight been allowed to it. It was in substance, that from the circumstances attending the death of Moore, he was fully of opinion, that he did not meet his death by a shot from Clow, but was accidentally killed by one of his own men, who was firing in the rear of some of the party among whom was Moore, at the time he fell. And he gave as a reason for the correctness of his opinion, that the hole in Moore's back, (the bullet having passed quite through his body) was small and smooth, while that in front, was much larger and ragged, or torn. Thus satisfying him that the ball must have entered his back; so that it was impossible it should have been fired from the house, as Moore's face was towards the house when he fell. And in this statement the sheriff was supported by such of his company as were examined.\n\nIt is said the only testimony which bore the semblance of evidence against him, was that of a certain John Bullen; who stated simply, that in a conversation he had with Clow in the jail, Clow said to him \"that if he did kill Moore it was by accident.\" The testimony of Bullen was of very little consequence in itself; and taken in connexion with Mr. Clayton's testimony and those who agreed with him, it amounted to no evidence against Clow. But in the then state of high party excitement, it was enough, and was made the ground of the verdict of guilty against the prisoner.\n\nAt that time it was the duty of the governor to fix on the time and place of execution, and issue his warrant in accordance there with, to the sheriff of the county. The governor was greatly inclined to pardon Clow, for it is said he did not believe him guilty. The consequence was, that he kept respiting him from time to time; still delaying to issue his warrant, but deterred from granting his pardon by the clamors of the multitude who were exceedingly anxious for his execution. A few persons were bold enough to ask for his pardon, and strange as it may appear to us at this day, petitions were widely circulated and numerously signed, calling on the governor to cause him to be executed. So great was the fury of the people, that sheriff Clayton was in constant apprehension that they would attempt to break the jail, for the purpose of murdering his prisoner; to prevent which he slept in the same room with Clow, well armed, every night for many months; for Mr. Clayton was among the few who thought he ought not to suffer the punishment of death, for the murder of Moore, of which he believed him innocent, or for any other cause.\n\nAnd here let us pause in the progress of our history, while we endeavor to account for the apparently savage disposition of the people towards Clow. We may perhaps find the causes of it in the state of the country at that time. The war, on the issue of which, they had staked their all, had been raging for seven years. They had not only been contending with a powerful foreign nation, but were much impeded in their operations, by the motions of a body of men living within their own borders; who were constantly acting as spies upon them, or openly taking part with the enemy. These they called tories, and to them attributed the protraction of the war; which had been so disastrous in its consequences. For they had not only become impoverished in their estates, but there was scarcely a man, who had not to mourn the death of some dear friend, or near relative, who had bravely fought and fell while nobly struggling for that independence, which they believed would have been long since attained, had that class of people to whom Cheney Clow belonged, instead of exerting their influence and power against their country, taken part, heart and hand, in its favor.\n\nThe vacillating course of the governor was so long continued, and Clow's mind kept in such constant inquietude, that life to him became a burthen. He was also under daily apprehensions from the violence of the people, who were constantly demanding their victim. Under this state of feeling he wrote to the governor either to grant his pardon at once, or send to the sheriff the warrant for his execution; for that life under the circumstances of his case was worse than death. On the receipt of this letter, the governor yielded to the dictates of the multitude, instead of the pleadings of mercy; and soon after, the sheriff received Clow's death warrant! It is said that Clow heard the news of his fate, with the utmost composure. His once indomitable spirit had been quelled. Life seemed to have lost in his eyes every charm; and his thoughts were wholly placed on another state of existence. His heart had become as soft as that of a little child. No more he asked for mercy; he complained of his fate no more, and uttered no reviling against the authors of his death. When the day, and the hour came for his execution, with a steady step he walked to the place appointed for that purpose, singing all the way in a clear and unbroken voice, a hymn which he had learned in the prison. While under the gallows, and in his last agony, a strange, but strong revulsion of feeling seized upon the crowd assembled to witness the last sad act of the tragedy, which they had labored so long and so hard to get up! And a late, but unavailing remorse, sunk deep into the hearts of many. Soon every one agreed, that Cheney Clow had fallen a victim to the ill-judging violence of party feeling - but the scene had closed, and repentance and mercy came too late, to prevent an act which must ever be deplored; and which ought to be ever remembered, as a warning against the madness of party spirit.\n\nAmong the few who would have saved the life of Clow, had it been in their power, was Caesar Rodney. The same who signed the declaration of independence; whose patriotism was undoubted; and who had recently been governor of the State. He declared on the day of the execution that he had never wished to be governor until then, and then only, for the sole purpose of having it in his power to pardon Clow.\n\nHis wife, who had so bravely participated in his defence, never deserted him. She continued to plead for his pardon up to the last hour of his life. She remained in Dover until he was taken down from the gallows, then departed with his lifeless body, which she interred, we know not where. The humble dwelling, the scene of his arrest, and of his exhibition of such daring bravery, untenanted, was suffered to fall to decay. In a deep, dark forest, apart from all other dwellings, near Kenton, in Little creek hundred, there yet remains a heap of logs, which are pointed out to the curious, as CHENEY CLOW'S FORT.\n\nSource: The Delaware Register and Farmer's Magazine, From February to July, 1838. William Huffington, Dover, Delaware. Transcribed by Mary Kay Krogman. John Dickinson\n\nThe Founding Fathers: Delaware\n\nDickinson, \"Penman of the Revolution,\" was born in 1732 at Crosiadore estate, near the village of Trappe in Talbot County, MD. He was the second son of Samuel Dickinson, the prosperous farmer, and his second wife, Mary (Cadwalader) Dickinson. In 1740 the family moved to Kent County near Dover, DE., where private tutors educated the youth. In 1750 he began to study law with John Moland in Philadelphia. In 1753 Dickinson went to England to continue his studies at London's Middle Temple. Four years later, he returned to Philadelphia and became a prominent lawyer there. In 1770 he married Mary Norris, daughter of a wealthy merchant. The couple had at least one daughter.\n\nBy that time, Dickinson's superior education and talents had propelled him into politics. In 1760 he had served in the assembly of the Three Lower Counties (Delaware), where he held the speakership. Combining his Pennsylvania and Delaware careers in 1762, he won a seat as a Philadelphia member in the Pennsylvania assembly and sat there again in 1764. He became the leader of the conservative side in the colony's political battles. His defense of the proprietary governor against the faction led by Benjamin Franklin hurt his popularity but earned him respect for his integrity. Nevertheless, as an immediate consequence, he lost his legislative seat in 1764.\n\nMeantime, the struggle between the colonies and the mother country had waxed strong and Dickinson had emerged in the forefront of Revolutionary thinkers. In the debates over the Stamp Act (1765), he played a key part. That year, he wrote The Late Regulations Respecting the British Colonies . . . Considered, an influential pamphlet that urged Americans to seek repeal of the act by pressuring British merchants. Accordingly, the Pennsylvania legislature appointed him as a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress, whose resolutions he drafted.\n\nIn 1767-68 Dickinson wrote a series of newspaper articles in the Pennsylvania Chronicle that came to be known collectively as Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania. They attacked British taxation policy and urged resistance to unjust laws, but also emphasized the possibility of a peaceful resolution. So popular were the Letters in the colonies that Dickinson received an honorary LL.D. from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton) and public thanks from a meeting in Boston. In 1768, responding to the Townshend Duties, he championed rigorous colonial resistance in the form of nonimportation and non-exportation agreements.\n\nIn 1771, Dickinson returned to the Pennsylvania legislature and drafted a petition to the king that was unanimously approved. Because of his continued opposition to the use of force, however, he lost much of his popularity by 1774. He particularly resented the tactics of New England leaders in that year and refused to support aid requested by Boston in the wake of the Intolerable Acts, though he sympathized with the city's plight. Reluctantly, Dickinson was drawn into the Revolutionary fray. In 1774 he chaired the Philadelphia committee of correspondence and briefly sat in the First Continental Congress as a representative from Pennsylvania.\n\nThroughout 1775, Dickinson supported the Whig cause, but continued to work for peace. He drew up petitions asking the king for redress of grievances. At the same time, he chaired a Philadelphia committee of safety and defense and held a colonelcy in the first battalion recruited in Philadelphia to defend the city.\n\nAfter Lexington and Concord, Dickinson continued to hope for a peaceful solution. In the Second Continental Congress (1775-76), still a representative of Pennsylvania, he drew up them> Declaration of the Causes of Taking Up Arms. In the Pennsylvania assembly, he drafted an authorization to send delegates to Congress in 1776. It directed them to seek redress of grievances, but ordered them to oppose separation of the colonies from Britain.\n\nBy that time, Dickinson's moderate position had left him in the minority. In Congress he voted against the Declaration of Independence (1776) and refused to sign it. Nevertheless, he then became one of only two contemporary congressional members (with Thomas McKean) who entered the military. When he was not reelected he resigned his brigadier general's commission and withdrew to his estate in Delaware. Later in 1776, though reelected to Congress by his new constituency, he declined to serve and also resigned from the Pennsylvania Assembly. He may have taken part in the Battle of Brandywine, PA (September 11, 1777), as a private in a special Delaware force but otherwise saw no further military action.\n\nDickinson came out of retirement to take a seat in the Continental Congress (1779-80), where he signed the Articles of Confederation; earlier he had headed the committee that had drafted them. In 1781 he became president of Delaware's Supreme Executive Council. Shortly thereafter, he moved back to Philadelphia. There, he became president of Pennsylvania (1782-85). In 1786, representing Delaware, he attended and chaired the Annapolis Convention.\n\nThe next year, Delaware sent Dickinson to the Constitutional Convention. He missed a number of sessions and left early because of illness, but he made worthwhile contributions, including service on the Committee on Postponed Matters. Although he resented the forcefulness of Madison and the other nationalists, he helped engineer the Great Compromise and wrote public letters supporting constitutional ratification. Because of his premature departure from the convention, he did not actually sign the Constitution but authorized his friend and fellow-delegate George Read to do so for him.\n\nDickinson lived for two decades more but held no public offices. Instead, he devoted himself to writing on politics and in 1801 published two volumes of his collected works. He died at Wilmington in 1808 at the age of 75 and was entombed in the Friends Burial Ground.\n\n[ The U. S. National Archives & Records Administration, Delaware's Founding Fathers at www.archives.gov, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nGeorge Gray\n\nCould the verdict of all classes within the borders of the Diamond State irrespective of party affiliations be had, a consensus of opinion would undoubtedly nominate George Gray to the post of honor of Delaware's first living citizen. Since the genesis of any man's character and fame, rightly begins with his great-grandfather, it may be useful to recur a moment to Mr. Gray's ancestors.\n\nEarly in the eighteenth century George Gray's paternal great-grandfather, William Gray, son of Andrew Gray, sailed from Belfast, Ireland, for America, with his wife and young son William. Both he and his wife died on the voyage of ship fever. Having fortunately inherited an ample estate, the young orphan was carefully reared by his guardian, and when a young man became a successful merchant. He married Jean Caldwell, the daughter of Major Andrew Caldwell, of a prominent Revolutionary family. Their son, Andrew Gray, who was born in Kent County, Delaware, after receiving an excellent education in his youth, graduated later from the University of Pennsylvania. Until 1808 young Andrew Gray lived upon the large landed estates in Kent County inherited from his maternal grandfather, Andrew Caldwell, but lived thereafter upon a farm in Mill Creek Hundred near Newark. Though five times elected to the House and Senate of the General Assembly of the State, between 1816 and 1824, he took little active part in public affairs, spending much time in the study of the classics, of which he was very fond, and in the composition of essays, chiefly of a philosophical character.\n\nHe married Rebecca Rodgers, daughter of Colonel John Rodgers, of Hartford County, Maryland, and sister of Commodore John and George Rodgers who won distinction in the navy in the War of 1812. Of this marriage was born, in Kent County, May 25, 1804, a son, Andrew Caldwell Gray. Young Andrew graduated from Princeton College in 1821 at the early age of seventeen, and shortly after began the study of law under James R. Black, Esq., later an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of Delaware.\n\nIn 1826, upon his admission to the bar, he settled at New Castle. His professional success was pronounced, and he speedily acquired prominence both in legal and in commercial circles, becoming counsel for the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal Company, and in 1853, its president. Retiring in 1854 from active practice as a lawyer, he became prominently identified as director, president, etc., with the new railroad development in the State, and as president, with a number of its most important banking and manufacturing enterprises. Against all importunity he refused political honors, though as a Democrat taking a lively interest in public affairs. Andrew C. Gray was a man of spotless integrity, everywhere reverenced and loved for his unselfish and benevolent character. He married Elizabeth Scoffield of Stamford, Conn.\n\nGeorge Gray, one of their four children, was born in New Castle, May 4, 1840. After receiving the invaluable benefit of an early training in the public schools of his town, young George Gray was prepared for college by the Rev. A. M. Wiggins and Professor William F. Lane, and in 1857 entered Princeton in the junior year, graduating thence with high standing at the age of nineteen, in two years thereafter. He was ever as a youth of a studious habit, fond of machinery and much given to haunting the machine shops and manufactories of his native town and of Wilmington, examining the construction and uses of the machines employed in the various manufacturing processes therein. He was likewise fond of boating, and on the nearby Delaware, acquired sufficient knowledge of boats and sail-craft and of their practical handling to make him quite a sailor. Soon after leaving college he began reading law under the tutelage of his father and the Hon. William C. Spruance, now one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the State. He then spent a year at Harvard law school, and in 1863 was formally admitted to the bar.\n\nHis legal brethren and the State at large were not long in discovering in him the possession of those high qualities of brain and character which have not only placed him at the very front of the profession in his own State, but have also brought him distinction and influence in the counsels of the nation, and indeed made his name known beyond the sea. As a lawyer he was careful and thorough in the preparation of his cases, and although not a brilliant trial lawyer yet he was a strong one, and had the habit of securing verdicts, which after all is the main thing. He was always a Democrat, and while taking a great interest in the political and in all other State interests, George Gray never in his life sought office. But his party, appreciating his qualifications for service and leadership, often urged his candidacy, but it was not until 1879, when for sixteen years he had been before the public as a lawyer, and active in the counsels and battles of the party, that he consented to take at the hands of Governor John W. Hall the office of Attorney-General for the State. His able conduct of that position as he followed the ambulatory court throughout the State, more than ever brought him into prominence as a lawyer, while his kindly methods deservedly attached to him hosts of admirers and friends of all political views, who with flattering unanimity demanded his reappointment by Governor Charles C. Stockley, which was done.\n\nMr. Bayard entered President Cleveland's Cabinet as Secretary of State in 1885, and the Democracy of Delaware instinctively turned to Mr. Gray as the most fit successor to his mantle of leadership in State and Senate, and accordingly on March 16th of that year the General Assembly chose him to fill the remaining two years of Mr. Bayard's term, and at the end of that period re-elected him for the full term of six years, and again in 1893 for six years more. During his fourteen years' career in that great forum many weighty questions of national and several of international importance were debated and decided, and Senator Gray at length took his station among the few leading spirits who through their learning, wisdom and force of character shaped the legislation and policies of those years. He warmly supported the International Arbitration Treaty, that beneficent principle which is ever gathering force, to bring at last the day \"when the war-drum will throb no longer and the battle-flags be furled in the Parliament of Man.\" His arraignment of the Election Bill of President Harrison was very forcible. The strong hatred of war, which he shared with President McKinley, led him to give his adherence to the latter's reluctance to call a halt in Spain's unparalleled brutality towards Cuba. His final action as a member of the Peace Commission which met at Paris after the close of the war with Spain displays the frankness and the high moral courage of the man. What heightens the quality of this courageous act is the further fact that it was done in the very teeth of the sentiments of his own party leaders and press everywhere denouncing that course as imperialistic. He had at first opposed the retention by the United States of the Philippines, but when convinced of the wisdom of that course withdrew his objections and signed the treaty. At a reception given him by the Board of Trade of Wilmington, January 15, 1899, upon his return from Paris, he ably vindicated his changed attitude in an address, which is a fine specimen of robust reasoning couched in eloquent dress.\n\nIn 1898 his party was about to return him to the Senate for the fourth time, when he declined the honor in view of his expected assignment by President McKinley to one of the two additional United States Circuit Court Judgeships for the Third Circuit of which office he is now a distinguished incumbent. Although Senator Gray was one of the leaders of the opposite party, President McKinley, sharing the unbounded confidence of the whole country in his character and attainments, frequently availed himself of his wide experience and intelligent judgment in solving some of the difficult problems in statesmanship in his administration, no other Senator being summoned, it is said, to the White House for consultation oftener than Senator Gray. No loftier compliment could possibly be paid the political candor and patriotic integrity of any man. Judge Gray served on the Joint High Commission to settle certain disputes between the United States and Canada; and was a member of the International Arbitration Commission which met at the Hague in 1900; and also of the Alabama Coal Strike Commission. His frequent choice for these offices of arbitration and the uniform success of his efforts therein, prove that in addition to his high legal and other qualifications and his unquestioned integrity, he is also the possessor, to an eminent degree, of an impartial and judicial temper that peculiarly fits him for these important tasks. Evidently President Roosevelt so believed when in 1902 he conferred upon him the exalted honor of chairman of the famous Anthracite Coal Strike Commission, with wide powers to settle the perplexing questions involved in the Pennsylvania coal strike of that year, one of the gravest industrial crises that ever arose in this country.\n\nHis selection commanded the respect of the immediate parties to this bitter controversy, and of the nation at large whose comfort, not to say, indeed, whose very lives were being imperiled. And his earnest and sagacious labors contributed in a large measure to avert a colossal calamity whose measureless evils appalls the imagination to contemplate. The difficulties these arbitrators met, by reason of the complex character of the interests represented, and the acrimonious antagonisms aroused between those interests, were prodigious! The quiet, poised temper of Chairman Gray and the native honesty of his character were never better shown than in his skillful guidance of this Commission. All knew him learned and experienced in the law, and believed him fair; and this trial disclosed him also gifted with a tactful diplomacy which happily composed seemingly irreconcilable differences, and made possible the settlement which was satisfactory to the principals themselves and to the whole country. An eminent lawyer not of his political faith, declared that no other man in the country \"could have brought these opposing elements to the common agreement of appending their approving signatures to the Commissioner's report. \"Judge Gray wrote his own and his state's name right nobly anew on the rolls of fame that day. Since George Read signed the three great charters of the nation's freedom, and John M. Clayton accomplished \"the world's first universal fact,\" the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, no son of Delaware has written history in characters at once so large and so enduring! On the 4th of July, 1903, he addressed at Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania, a large concourse of citizens composed of both mine operators and mine workmen, giving words of wise counsel to both, and declaring that their late peaceful meeting signalized a splendid advance towards the true principles that should govern the mutual relations of capital and labor.\n\nJudge Gray has always been a strong Democrat, and from his early entrance into professional life has zealously championed the principles and candidates of his party. With one exception, viz., that Quixotic episode in his party's history, wherein, among other doctrines equally sound, their candidate solemnly proclaimed it as one of the principles of his economic system, that the Almighty had foreordained that a bushel of wheat and a 16 to 1 silver dollar should be eternally joined in indissoluble bonds of matrimony! The Senator \"gagged\" at that and much more like it.\n\nHe was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1876, 1880, 1884 and 1892, and took a prominent part in them all. In 1880, at the Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, and again in 1884 at Chicago, he presented the name of his distinguished fellow-citizen, Hon. Thomas F. Bayard as a candidate for President. His eloquent speech in placing Mr. Bayard in nomination at Cincinnati is quoted in full in the Chapter entitled \"Great Speeches on Great Issues,\" in Thomas V. Cooper's \"American Politics.\"\n\nJudge Gray himself was honored with the nomination as the Democratic National Standard Bearer at the Convention held at St. Louis in 1904, L. Irving Handy, Esq., in an able speech pursuant to the unanimous instructions of the Democratic State Convention at Dover June 8, 1904, offering his name for the suffrages of the convention. Beyond doubt, his candidacy would have saved the party the inglorious Waterloo they met under the banner of the feeble \"sage of Esopus.\" Mr. Gray was married in 1870 to Harriet, daughter of Charles H. Black, M. D., of New Castle, Delaware. Two daughters and three sons were born to them. May 26, 1880, Mrs. Gray suddenly died. August 8, 1882, Judge Gray married Margaret J. Black, the sister of his first wife.\n\n[History of the State of Delaware by Henry C. Conrad, Volume III, Published by the Author, Wilmington, Delaware, 1908, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman]\n\nMRS.
