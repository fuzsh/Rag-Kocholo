        "text": "KENT COUNTY.\n\nKent County is the middle county of the State, having an area of about 615 square miles. On the north it is bounded by New Castle County, on the east by Delaware Bay, on the south by Sussex County, and on the west by the State of Maryland.\n\nIn the early history of the State, Kent County had no distinct political identity. Under the Dutch regime, the confines of what is now Kent County were included in the larger county known originally as Hoornkill, later as Horekill or Whorekill, the county seat of which was at the town of Whorekill (now Lewes). At that time the county of Hoornkill extended from Bomptyes Hoejjck (Bambo Hook, now Bombay Hook) to Cape Hinlopen, including in its boundaries what is now both Kent and Sussex Counties.\n\nAbout the year 1680, after the Dutch had been supplanted by the English, the following petition was addressed to Governor Andros:\n\n\"Wee whose names are hereunto subscribed, living and ambitious to abide under the sunshine of yor Honors Govemmt Inhabetinge in the upland part of the Whorekill County:\n\n\"In all humble manner show unto yor Honor the great greivances Hazards and perils both by land and water that wee undergoe in going to the Whorekill Court, not only the distance beinge to some of us 50, some 60 miles, want of commodacons of man or beast there, butt the unpassable, dangerous waies by reason of perillous Creeks, which many tymes can not bee past over by man or beast, the hazardous large Marshes and myreous and difficult branches which are past through to the said Court, which doth onely nott putt us greate straits and jeopardy of our lives, butt hath and doth give great discouragement to others intendinge to seat in these upwardparts from Maryland, that some have deserted in their designee rather than in hazard of their lives to goe down to the said Whorekill Court; And for as much as the grievances aforesaid are Insupportable to us, and these parts dayly increasing with diverse considerable families with considerable Estates, and more intendinge to remove from Maryland, that wee are in these altogether yf nott more populated than the other part of the County, and nott onely the Inconveniences aforesaid yf nott by honor remedied, butt also the downe of Delaware beinge in like manner inconvenient to these upward parts, That should the inhabitants hereoff appeare att either Court ytt would not onely cause the present Seaters to withdraw back hence, and disencouragement to others designed to seate here;\n\n\"The premises considered with all humble reverence wee leave the discuss of the whole matter to yor Honors grave and wise consideracon and hope yor Honor for the Encouragement of us, the present inhabitants and others that are cominge to seate in these parts, Out of your wonted clemency, Tender Care and Willingness at all tymes for encouragement of Seaters and Preservinge us under the sunshine of yor happy Government from all danger, and removeing Inconveniences and perils that might ensue, for the ease and prosperous setlement of these parts will be graciously pleased to order, authorize, constitute and appoint a Court to be held in some convenient place in St Jones Creeke, at such tymes and upon such daies as yor Honor in yor wisdom shall thinke fitt, and that all prsons in habiting from the north side of Cedar Creeke to the south side of Blackbird Creek, be ordered and required to appeare, doe suit and service, obey process in law and bee deemed and taken to be within the jurisdiction of the said Court, and yield obedeyance to the authority thereof, Nott doubtinge butt yor Honor may make and find persons capable in the prcincts thereof for administration of Justice, and others as ministerial officers to attend the same Court and execute all process and orders, and keepeing and makeing Records of proceedings and acts done by authority thereof, And we, as in duty bound, shall ever pray for yor Honors health, and happiness, That age may Crown your snowy haires with Caesors honors and with Nestor's years.\"\n\nGriff Jones, John Glovear, Robert Porter, Arthur Alstone, Robert Miller, Thomas Millen, William Millen, John R.

Hayes, Robert Johnson.\n\n\"The shipe goeing away, wee had nott time to gitt ye rest of there names, butt we think there may be about 100 tithabell,\" (meaning taxpayers).\n\nThis petition was favorably received by the Governor, who, the same year, divided the old Whorekill County into two parts, calling the southern portion Whorekill, which later took the name Deale, and afterwards Sussex; and the northern portion, now Kent, he called St. Jones. Why the name St. Jones was selected for the new county is largely a matter of doubt, the most plausible explanation being that it was taken from the parish of St. Jones in Kent County, England.\n\nThe name St. Jones had, however, but a brief existence. Just when it was dropped for the present name, Kent, cannot be stated with certainty. In the Act of Union, annexing the Delaware Counties to the State of Pennsylvania, dated December 17, 1682, Kent County is called St. Jones, or rather Jones, showing the adoption by Penn himself of the name Jones. Hazard makes the statement that in November, 1682, Jones was changed to Kent, Deale to Sussex, and Cape Henlopen was ordered by Penn to be changed to Cape James. The Act of Union confirms Hazard's statement as to \"Sussex\" and \"Cape James,\" for in that act the change in these names is mentioned, but the name \"Jones,\" in the same act, is still retained. If Penn had ordered the change in the name of Jones at the same time that he ordered the change of the other names, as Hazard states, it is difficult to understand why mention should not have been made in the act of the new name, Kent, in connection with the mention of the new names, \"Sussex\" and \"Cape James.\"\n\nEbeling is authority for the statement that in the year 1683 all the counties were known by their present names. It seems, therefore, that the new name \"Kent \" succeeded the name \"Jones \" some time about the year 1682 or 1683, the probabilities being in favor of the latter date. Why the name \"Kent \" was selected is likewise a matter of doubt, there being some authority for the statement that it was taken from the old County of Kent, in England.\n\nThe Kent County of Andros and Penn's time was indefinite in its boundaries. The line separating it from New Castle County was undefined, as was also the line separating it from Sussex County, and its western limits were involved in the long drawn out dispute that lasted for many years between the Proprietaries of Delaware and Maryland over the boundaries of the two provinces; Duck creek marked the northern boundary. This boundary line was well defined throughout the length of the stream, but Duck creek not extending across the whole breadth of the county the western end of the northern boundary was therefore left undefined. On the south, Cedar creek was the original line marking the limits of Kent County. But the western end of the southern line, like the western end of the northern, was uncertain, Cedar creek extending only partially across the county. In the year 1775 an Act of Assembly was passed in which these lines were accurately defined.\n\nBy this act, Bombay Hook, being on the east and north side of Duck creek, was left in New Castle County. But in 1841, the outlet called \"Thoroughfare,\" which had been cut from Duck creek to the bay, was made a part of the northern line, thus throwing Bombay Hook into Kent County. With the exception of this addition of Bombay Hook in 1841, the northern and southern boundaries of the county have remained unchanged since they were defined in 1775.\n\nThe western line separating Kent County from Maryland was run in accordance with certain agreements between the Baltimore and Penn families, under certain decrees of the Court of Chancery, in England, touching the matter of the limits and extent of Penn's three lower counties. After a survey by commissioners appointed as a result of these agreements and decrees, the exact line was proclaimed April 8, 1765, by the Governor, thereby permanently fixing the western boundary of Kent County.\n\nIn the early days of exploration and settlement, what is now Kent County seems to have been neglected. The date of the earliest land grant appears to be June 16, 1671, when Governor Lovelace warranted \"Poplar Neck \" to Thomas Young, a date that indicates the comparative slowness that marked the early settlement of Kent County. The explorers and settlers either stopped at the Whorekill or sailed on up the bay past the shores of Kent to New Castle County, and there settled along the shores and creeks. In 1638, Minuit, with his colony of Swedes, touched the shores of Kent County at the mouth of Mispillion creek, naming the spot where he landed \"Paradise Point.\" But he stopped only in passing. No permanent settlement resulted. The settlers who came into the county did not, in the first instance, come in groups direct from their native lands, but migrated from various parts of the country up and down the seaboard, mostly from Pennsylvania, New Castle and Sussex Counties, and from Maryland. The fact of Kent County being swallowed up in Whorekill County, that the county seat was so far distant, and the journey thither was so difficult, as well as hazardous, made the lands of Kent rather undesirable, comparatively speaking, for prospective settlers. Indeed, so unattractive had Kent County appeared to settlers, that shortly after the formation of the county by Andros, in 1680, a census taken of the people, shows only ninety-nine persons from \"ye upper part of Cedar creek to ye upper part of Duck creek.\" In 1683, according to Penn's estimate, the whole State contained 4,000 people, a fact which emphasizes the sparseness of Kent's population.\n\nThe land of Kent County was disposed of by patents, grants and warrants from the Proprietaries or their Governors, and from the Whorekill Court. One Christian, the Indian, alias Petrocaquewam, seems also to have assumed the right to make grants in Kent County, styling himself lord and owner of all the land between St. Jones and Duck creek. He granted \"Lisburn\" to John Brinckloe, February 21, 1681, for three match coats, twelve bottles of drink, four double handfuls of powder and four of shot. The same tract was warranted to Brinckloe by the Whorekill Court, 1679-1680, he receiving his patent in 1684. John and Richard Walker also purchased land of Petrocaquewam, their deed calling for the tract \" Brother's Portion.\" In their deed, Petrocaquewam styles himself \" Lord and owner of all the land between the Murder Kill and Duck creek.\" Doubtless the purpose of these purchases from Christian, the Indian, was simply the quieting of titles.\n\nWhen the new county was erected settlers began to come in, taking up land along the creeks and streams. Duck creek, St. Jones creek, Little creek and Murder Kill creek, each at tracted the newcomers, and on the banks of these streams the earliest settlements were made. The county gradually and steadily grew in population. There is no early census other than the crude one taken upon the formation of the county in the time of Governor Andros. There is, however, a statement in Ebeling's History of Delaware, to the effect, that in 1716, Dover contained three hundred persons, which, if true, is indicative of a rapid growth in the county after its formation in 1680. In the year 1742, a rough census taken privately by an Episcopal clergyman, accords to Kent County 1,005 families. About the year 1760 a similar census was taken, and it is stated that \"at a moderate computation\" the whole county contained about 7,000 souls. The population of Kent County, according to the United States Census Reports from 1790 to the present, was as follows:\n\n1790 . . . 18,920\n\n1800 . . . 19,554\n\n1810 . . . 20,495\n\n1820 . . . 20,793\n\n1830 . . . 19,913\n\n1840 . . . 19,872\n\n1850 . . . 22,816\n\n1860 . . . 27,804\n\n1870 . . . 29,804\n\n1880 . . . 32,874\n\n1890 . . . 32,664\n\n1900 . . . 32,762\n\nFrom the beginning the urban population consisted of but a small percentage of the total, and at the present time the county remains essentially rural. The fertility of its soil, its genial climate and abundant but not over-plentiful rain-fall, render the production of corn, wheat, oats, peaches, apples, pears, tomatoes and truck, easy and profitable. Its shores along the bay are so flat, its rivers and creeks so narrow and winding, that it is doubtful if its inhabitants will ever be turned by the prospects of industrial and commercial activity from the agricultural pursuits for which nature has best fitted them.\n\nWhen the county was first formed, the county seat, or what seems to have served for the county seat, was a place called \"Towne Point\" at the mouth of St. Jones creek. Hazard claims that courts of justice were held in 1675 at a place called \"Troy,\" for we read that courts were held \"at a place now called 'Troy' on Jones's creek, near Dover, for Jones, now Kent; at Whorekill, now Lewistown, for the County of Deale, now Sussex.\" While the courts may have been held at \"Troy,\" yet it cannot be that they were held there as early as the year 1675, for the county was not formed until the year 1680, and the names \"Kent\" and \"Sussex\" were not adopted before the year 1682. Towne Point, therefore, was the first county seat for Kent County. It is quite likely that the courts were at a later date held at \"Troy,\" for one of the justices of the peace, namely, John Briggs, was the owner of \"Troy\" at the time of his service as justice of the peace.\n\n\"Towne Point\" was owned by Edward Pack, a justice of the peace, and it was at his house that the court was held. The place is now known as the Sidney Algernon Logan farm. \"Troy\" is now owned by William Dyer, of Dover, and lies in Jones Neck, about two miles out of Dover.\n\nThe year 1689 or 1690 marks the latest dates of holding courts at \"Towne Point.\" In this year the county seat was removed to the tavern of James Maxwell, who had purchased one hundred acres of William Berry, a portion of \"Berry's Range,\" adjoining the two hundred acre tract afterwards purchased for a county seat. The identical location of this tavern is not known, but it is supposed to have been near the site of the water-works in the present town of Dover.\n\nAs yet there had been no provision made looking towards the establishment of a permanent county seat. In the year 1694, for some reason or other, it was impossible to secure a quorum to hold court at James Maxwell's tavern, two of the justices of the peace refusing to sit, one of them declaring that he never would sit at James Maxwell's tavern. Accordingly, a term of court was lost. Upon the representation of these facts to the Lieutenant-Governor, the advice of the Provincial Council was sought, and the recalcitrant justices were ordered to hold their courts. At the same time the provincial judges were commanded in their next circuit \" to inspect and inquire into the disorders of the County of Kent, in reference to the time and places of holding their courts, and to see what may be the most proper place in the sd counties to hold their courts in, for the most universal care of the sd Countie, and make report to the Lieutenant-Governor and Council.\"\n\nActing under these instructions, the provisional judges, William Clarke, of Sussex, Edward Blake and Richard Hallowell, of New Castle, consulted with the magistrates, grand jury and others of the Kent court. The outcome of the consultation was that the county courts should be \"held on some part of ye land belonging to Wm. Southby, situate on the south side of the Head of St. Jones Creek, which is next adjoining unto David Morgan's land,\" as near a landing as possible. Delegates were appointed, Richard Wilson and William Morton, to purchase the ground from Wm. Southby, and on November 3, 1694, they received a deed from Southby of two hundred acres of a tract of land called \"Brother's Portion,\" adjoining David Morgan's calf pasture, and described by metes and bounds. On February 4, 1695, it was conveyed to the inhabitants of Kent County for the sum of twenty-five pounds.\n\nThough the county seat was thus established, yet the town of Dover had not been laid out. The town was in contemplation as early as 1693, in which year Penn ordered that a town be laid out for the Governor, to be called Dover, and that the court house and prison be built on the cross street of the said town. But the location of the new town was not prescribed. It was finally determined by this action of the Provincial Judges, grand jury and others in selecting the two hundred acres of the \"Brother's Portion\" for a county seat. Penn's intention being that Dover should be the county seat, the town was accordingly laid out on these two hundred acres, but not until the year 1717.\n\nConcerning the early administration of the affairs of Kent County as a county, there is comparatively no information. In a general way, it may be said that it was done by the only constituted administrative body of the three counties, that is, the Lieutenant-Governor and Assembly, with the assistance of the county court. It was not until 1736 that a levy court was constituted. The act creating it was styled \"An Act for Raising County Rates and Levies,\" from which arose the term levy-court. By that act the Levy Court was to consist of the justices of the peace of the county or any three of them, eight grand jurymen, or such as would attend, and the assessors, or the majority of them. Their place of meeting was the court house of the county, and their duties were prescribed as follows:\n\nTo calculate and settle the public debts and charges of the respective counties, allowing all just debts and demands which now are or hereafter shall be charge able upon the said respective counties, and shall settle and adjust the sum and turns of money, which ought of necessity to be raised yearly, to defray the charges of building and repairing court houses, prisons, work-houses, or for destroying wolves, crows and blackbirds, with such other uses as may redound to the public service and benefit of the said counties, respectively; and shall also ascertain and set down such competent sums and sums of money, as shall be yearly applied toward every of the said duties and services; together with such sum or sums as may be needful to make good deficiencies in county rates assessed and not yet collected, and to enforce the collection thereof as need may require.\n\nIn 1757 power was given the Levy Court to appoint a county treasurer, and in 1791 the Levy Court was reorganized, taking the name of Levy Court and Court of Appeal. Its powers were the same as formerly, but its composition was altered. Under this act, the Levy Court and Court of Appeal of Kent County consisted of \"the two oldest justices of the peace resident in each Hundred, the president of the Quarter Sessions in the said county always to be one of the two persons to represent the Hundred in which he may reside,\" and in case it should happen that no justice of the peace, or only one, should reside in any Hundred, then, to fill the place or places of such justice or justices, there should be an election of discreet and experienced free-holders.\n\nBy act of 1793 the Levy Court and Court of Appeal was again reorganized. Its members were called Commissioners, and in Kent County were nine in number, two from each of the Hundreds of Duck Creek and Mispillion, one from each of the Hundreds of Little Creek and St. Jones, and three from the Hundred of Murderkill. Their powers continued the same. Down to June, 1898, the Levy Court retained its original number of nine, though the apportionment of members among the various Hundreds changed as the Hundreds were changed, and its powers were, of course, enlarged to meet the conditions that growth and progress imposed. In 1898, each of the Hundreds had one commissioner in the Levy Court. By act of Legislature of that year, the Levy Court as then organized was abolished, and a new Levy Court of ten members was constituted, one member to be elected from each of the ten election districts into which the county had been divided by the new constitution of 1897. By this act the clerk of the peace was given a vote in case of a tie.\n\nKent County is divided into nine Hundreds, namely, Duck Creek, Kenton, Little Creek, East Dover, West Dover, North Murderkill, South Murderkill, Mispillion and Milford. This division of the county into Hundreds was of English origin. When the original Hundreds were formed and what constituted their limits, is so confused in the early history of the State as so admit of no definite statement. Indeed, the boundaries of the earliest Hundreds were so vague, that the people as late as 1775, were in doubt as to their exact limits. Accordingly, in that year, it was enacted that \"the justices of the peace - as soon as conveniently may be, in the courts of General Quarter Sessions - shall ascertain the bounds and limits of the several ancient Hundreds - and lay out such and so many new Hundreds as may be found necessary and convenient.\" What the justices of the peace did under this law, or whether indeed they did anything, is unknown.\n\nOriginally, at least as early as 1778, there were five Hundreds, for in that year there was passed by the General Assembly of Delaware \"An act for free pardon and oblivion,\" which extended amnesty to all who had aided or abetted the British forces in the struggle against the king. But certain persons were excepted from the benefits of this act, and in naming these persons the Hundreds in which they resided are mentioned. In that act we read the names of the following Hundreds: Little Creek, Duck Creek, Mispillion and Dover. In the act of reorganizing the Levy Court (1793) the same Hundreds are mentioned with the exception of \"Dover,\" which in that act was called \"Jones.\" In the course of time, four new Hundreds were added to the original five. Out of Jones and Murderkill Hundreds, East and West Dover Hundreds were formed, and the old Jones or St. Jones Hundred disappeared. Out of Duck Creek and Little Creek Hundreds Kenton Hundred was carved, and what remained of Murder kill, after a portion had been taken to form the two Dover Hundreds, was broken into North Murderkill and South Murderkill Hundreds. Milford Hundred was erected out of the original Mispillion.\n\nBefore the new constitution of 1897, this division of the county into Hundreds was much more important than it now is. Before that date, the Levy Court Commissioners were distributed according to the Hundreds, the administration of the affairs of the county was conducted largely in respect to them, voting districts were located with reference to them, and in the politics of the State the Hundreds have always played a prominent part. The new constitution, however, by creating a new species of sub-division, namely, representative and senatorial districts, has deprived the term \"Hundred\" of much of its original significance. Their lines are, nevertheless, still well-drawn, and they continue to maintain their individuality.\n\nIt has been before stated that a tract of two hundred acres was conveyed to the county in 1694 or 1695 for the purpose of establishing a county seat. On this tract a court house was built about the year 1698, for in a petition of citizens dated May 15, 1699, mention is made of the recently purchased tract \" where the court house now stands.\" It will be remembered that Penn, in giving his directions for the establishment of the county seat at Dover in 1683, had specified that the court house should be on the cross street of the said town. In accordance with this instruction, when the town was subsequently laid out in 1717, a cross street was plotted in the two hundred acre tract in such position that the court house stood on the southeast corner where the present court house now stands. The present Main or State street of Dover was the north and south street in the cross; and a street running from Jones's Creek westward, in front of what is now the residence of the Hon. John R. Nicholson, the court house, Delawarean office, and the home of the late Hon. Joseph P. Comegys, formed the east and west street in the cross.\n\nThis court house was sold in 1722 and a new court house was erected on the site of the present state house. It was in this building that the old bell, now in the State Library, was hung by Thomas Rodney in 1770. In 1774, from its place in the court house, the tones of the old bell sounded for the assembling of the free-holders of Kent, at the court house, in the town of Dover, to take into consideration the acts of the British Parliament in shutting up the port of Boston. It was in this building also that the zealous citizens of Kent County, under the leadership of the patriotic Csesar Rodney, snatched from the wall the portrait of George III and carried it out upon the public square, where they burned it in the presence of the convention there assembled, while Caesar Rodney, president of the convention, pronounced the following words over the flaming portrait of his majesty: \"Compelled by necessity, thus we destroy even the shadow of that king who refused to reign over a free people.\" Here, too, the Assembly met when it came to Dover in its various flights during the Revolution.\n\nIn 1777 Dover was made the capital of the State in the place of New Castle, at which town the Legislature had hitherto met. The old court house was found too meagre in its appointments to accommodate the courts of law, the Levy Court and the Assembly as well. Accordingly, in 1787-88 steps were taken looking towards the construction of a new court house, and commissioners were appointed to draw the plans; the Legislature requesting that provision be made for its accommodation when in session. The commissioners complied with this request, and memorialized the Assembly for an appropriation to enable them to carry out the work. The committee to which this memorial was referred, reported that the treasury was too low to warrant the appropriation. To raise the money, however, in the year 1788, all marriage and tavern licenses were devoted to the court house fund, and in 1789, the Legislature passed a bill providing for the raising of one thousand pounds by lottery for the purpose, first, of \"fitting up and preparing chambers in the new court house for the accommodation of the General Assembly,\" and second, if there were any proceeds left after the fitting up of these chambers, for the purpose of \" finishing and completing the said court house.\"\n\nWhen completed, the building contained offices for the Register of Wills (northwest corner), the Register in Chancery and Clerk of the Orphans' Court (northeast corner), Prothonotary (southwest corner), and Recorder of Deeds (southeast corner). The courts occupied the space between, and the Legislature had the second floor.\n\nIn 1792 \"the office at the southeast corner of the State house\" was to be fitted up for the Auditor of Accounts. Later, in 1795, the office on the second floor was, by act, appropriated to the use of the Auditor of Accounts as well as for the Legislature. The building was thus both a State house and a court house. At an early date (before 1807) it is thus described: \"On the east side of the parade (Dover green) is an elegant state house built of brick. It gives an air of grandeur to the town.\"\n\nIn the year 1792 trouble seems to have arisen between the Levy Court and the Assembly over the matter of defraying the expenses for the court house improvements. The quarrel must have waxed bitter, for the sheriff, John Clayton, by order of the Levy Court, demanded with drawn sword possession of the house for the use of the workmen. In high wrath, the Assembly withdrew to Duck Creek Cross-roads (now Smyrna), and in the tavern of Thomas Hale, May 4, 1792, the lower house, after reciting the facts, \"Resolved, unanimously, that in the opinion of this General Assembly the Legislature of the State ought not to be subject to the caprice of any individual in the State, and that it will not be proper for them to hold their sessions in the town of Dover until the Levy Court of Kent County or some other proper authority shall appropriate to their use the chambers in the said court house agreeable to the intention heretofore expressed.\" This resolution was lost in the Senate. By the following November the quarrel had been adjusted, and ever since that time the Assembly has continued its sessions in this building.\n\nUntil 1873, the building now used as a State house retained its double function of court house and State house. The land originally belonged to the county. The county had built the original building, but the State defrayed most of the expense of additions and repairs. In 1795 the Legislature authorized an appropriation for a copper roof, the completion of the battlements, the erection of stone steps and the painting of the building, at a total cost of $1,066.67. In 1835 it furnished the money for enlarging the Assembly chambers and for providing a library room. In 1836 it authorized the construction of a two-story and basement addition. These improvements provided an Executive chamber, a secretary's office and library on the lower floor, committee rooms on the upper floor, and an enlargement in the representative hall. In 1873 negotiations were entered into between the Legislature and the Levy Court of Kent County for the purchase of the building by the State. The Levy Court demanded $15,000.00, and by an act of April 3, 1873, the Legislature provided for the purchase at that price. The preamble to this act recited the joint-ownership of the property by the county and state, that the title to the building was in trustees, all of whom were dead, and that at that time (1873) the title was in the heir of the survivor.\n\nJacob Stout was the surviving trustee. The estate of a trustee descends according to the law of primogeniture. At the time of this act, therefore, the legal title was in Henry Stout, eldest son of Jacob Stout. The heir of the survivor being a non-resident, it was enacted that the Attorney-General take the necessary steps, in the Court of Chancery, for a decree for the appointment of a trustee in lieu of the non-resident trustee. All the necessary steps were taken to carry out the bargain and sale of the building, and on April 30, 1873, the title was conveyed by the Register in Chancery, in accordance with a decree to that effect, to Edward Ridgely, in whom it was vested until the time of his death. From the date of this conveyance the Kent County court house became the State house.\n\nIn June of the same year, the Levy Court began the consideration of plans for the construction of a new court house. Two lots were purchased on the southeast corner of the intersection of Main or State street and the Public Square, the east lot from Tobias B. Merritt, and the west lot from Curtis S. Watson. Conveyance of these lots was made to Edward Ridgley, trustee. By October, 1874, the new court house was completed, though not used until the following term of court, when Chief-Justice Gilphin presided over the first court held in the new building.\n\nThe court house thus finally returned to the spot in which it was originally intended to stand when Penn gave his instructions in 1683. The first floor of the building was at first used for office purposes, mostly by lawyers, but is now practically unoccupied. On the second floor is the court room proper, and the third floor was originally intended as a town hall and place for the assembling of conventions. The inconvenience of ascending so long a stairway, and the fear that the place was not as safe as it should be, combined to induce its abandonment as a hall. This particular function of the court house has been supplied by the new town hall of Dover erected in 1904.\n\nIt remains to trace the subsequent history of the old court house. In 1873, as has been already stated, this building became the State House. By the same act which provided for the purchase of the old court house by the State, it was provided that the building should be rearranged. Commissioners were appointed to superintend the work, and by August, 1874, it was completed at a cost of about eight thousand dollars. The refurnishing was finished by December of the same year, and in January, 1875, Governor Cochran was inaugurated in the renovated building amid great display.\n\nAccording to the rearrangement of the building, the Governor's office was in the north part of the building, the Secretary of State's office in the south part, and the offices of the State Treasurer and Auditor of Accounts were on the right and left of the main entrance. The second floor was devoted to the purposes of the Assembly, the House occupying the north side and the Senate the hall on the south side. The rear of the building was devoted to the State Library.\n\nStarting in the year 1895, a series of improvements to the State house was begun, which resulted in an enlargement and complete rearrangement of the building. By an act of Legislature in 1895, a committee was appointed to superintend the construction of an addition to the State Library, by extending the east wing of the building forty feet, at a cost not exceeding $10,000. This extension was finished by the following session of the Legislature, and in 1897 a committee was appointed \"to make necessary changes, improvements and alterations in the interior arrangement of the State house and repairs to the same,\" at a cost not exceeding $8,000. An additional appropriation of $4,467.19 was authorized by act of March 10, 1898, for the purpose of paying the balance due on this work. In the same year provision was made for repairing the roof, repainting the building, and refurnishing its different offices and halls, at a cost not exceeding $3,000.\n\nWhen completed, an act was passed, June 1, 1898, \"assigning the rooms in the State house to certain public officers.\" By this act the second and third floors were reserved for the exclusive use of the Legislature, the two rooms at the north west corner for the Governor, the room on the north side adjoining the Governor's offices to the State Treasurer, the three rooms and fire-proof vault at the southwest corner to the Secretary of State, the room on the south side adjoining the offices of Secretary of State to the Auditor of Accounts, the next room on the south side adjoining the office of Auditor of Accounts, to the Judiciary of the State, the room on the south side adjoining the Judiciary Chamber, on the east to the State Librarian, and the east wing, as extended, to the State Library. At the present writing this assignment of rooms remains unchanged.\n\nOriginally the county goal and county offices were located in the same building. This building was made of brick, about twenty by thirty-six feet, and stood on lot No. 33 of the town plot made in 1740, the site of the present county building.\n\nBy Act of Assembly passed in 25 George II (1753), recital is made of the fact that the \"inhabitants of Kent County are raising and levying a sum of money for the erecting a new prison in the town of Dover, in the said county, and that the lot whereon the old goal now stands, is not conveniently situated for such purpose,\"and commissioners were appointed to sell the goal and goal lot. The goal itself was, it appears, never sold, for it was a part of the office building. But the goal lot was sold to Nicholas Ridgely, November 15, 1754, and is still owned by his heirs. By 1775 the people of the county had raised enough money to buy lot No. 27 for the site of their new goal, and on this lot the goal was erected and stands to-day. The date of the construction of the building is unknown. Its material was brick, in size about forty by fifty feet, and it stood partly on the site of the rear of the present stone part of the goal building. On the night of October 27, 1827, one William Greenly, serving sentence for horse-stealing, set fire to the prison. Pending its repair, the prisoners were removed to the old goal building, that is, to the county office building, in which were still the old cells, relics of the time when the building was a goal as well.\n\nAbout 1870 agitation for a new goal was begun, and in the next year the Levy Court appointed a committee to devise plans for its construction. The work was completed in May, 1872, at a cost of $40,241.90. The goal proper was built of stone, and comprises the north section of the building, while the south section was built of brick and serves as a residence for the sheriff of the county.\n\nThe county office building remains to-day where it was originally built, namely, on lot No. 33. In 1858, this old building, which had served the double purpose of gaol and offices, was ordered torn down, and a committee was appointed by the Levy Court \"to cause to be erected a new fire-proof county building.\" On February 8, 1859, the new building was completed and soon after occupied. In this building are the offices of the Register of Wills, Recorder of Deeds, Clerk of the Orphans' Court and Register in Chancery, Prothonotary, Sheriff, Clerk of the Peace, County Treasurer, and a room for the use of the Levy Court. In the year 1903-4, owing to the cramped condition of the Recorder's office, a two-story addition was built on the east side, by which the Recorder's office on the first floor, and the Levy Court room on the second floor were spaciously enlarged. In the same year a steam heating plant was installed, the pipes being attached to the boilers in the gaol.\n\nIn matters of religion, the people of Kent County, in their early history, were not unlike the people of other sections of our country, in that, as soon as convenience would permit, the gospel followed close upon the heels of the immigrant. Owing to the exceeding sparseness of its population and the manner in which its people were scattered, Kent County did not, in its earliest history, maintain churches nor even support itinerant preachers.\n\nThe earliest sect, it appears, that attempted anything like an organized religious movement, was the Society of Friends. The beginnings of Episcopal worship were almost as early, and the Presbyterians seem to have followed close upon the Episcopalians. The next church to make its appearance was the Baptist. Then came the Methodist Episcopal. Through out the county at present, in addition to these, are to be found Baptists of the new school, Methodist Protestant, Roman Catholic and Dutch Reformed. The Friends, Episcopalians and Presbyterians, down to certain dates in their histories, were so organized that all the churches in their respective denominations were closely identified. The center for the Friends Society was Duck Creek, the center for the Episcopalians and for the Presbyterians was Dover. Around these places, more or less, revolved the early religious history of the county. In treating the history of the Friends, we shall carry all their meetings together and treat their history as the history of one, down to the time of their separation from each other. And similarly, we shall trace the history of the Episcopalians and Presbyterians.\n\nThe distinction of having been the first to hold a religious service in the county of Kent belongs to the Society of Friends, derisively called Quakers. A number of these plain simple folk had emigrated to Kent County at an early date and settled for the most part in what is now Duck Creek Hundred. There are no statistics showing their strength in the early days of Kent history, the earliest estimate being that of Rev. Arthur Usher, an Episcopal missionary, who is authority for the statement that in 1741, in his parish in Kent County, there were 109 Quakers. The next year, 1742, he says in the whole county there were sixty Quakers; a rather odd discrepancy in numbers that discredits the Rev. Usher's estimate. How ever that be, the Friends made much of a showing in Duck Creek, Little Creek, Mispillion and Murderkill Hundreds. But with the advance of time and the innovations that attend it, the Friends began to decline in their influence until now, the only meeting-house that is in use in the county is the one at Camden, and the whole membership of the denomination in Kent County has dwindled to about fifty.\n\nDuck Creek was the parent of the various meeting-houses established in the Hundreds above named. It was the center of influence of the Friends, as Dover was of Episcopal influence, but its position was eventually usurped by Camden. Probably as early as 1790, Duck Creek had lost its control, or at least had ceased to be aggressive, for in that year conveyance of land for a meeting-house, near Milford, was made to the trustees of Murderkill Meeting (the predecessor of Camden Friends), which fact would seem to indicate that at that time the Murderkill Meeting had assumed the position of leader, and already had overshadowed the Duck Creek Friends so far as active work was concerned.\n\nIn the year 1705, December 19th, first mention is made of the \"monthly meeting of Friends at Duck Creek\" (Old Duck Creek, now Salisbury), \"by order of the people called Quakers at Chester County, Pennsylvania.\" This date, therefore, marks the entrance of the Quakers into Kent County. The minutes about a month later of their next meeting show that they had a meeting-house, for it was resolved that \"the meeting-house be floored, and the graveyard made.\" From the report of this same meeting it would seem that Friends from other parts of the county, even at this early date, were in touch with the Duck Creek Friends, for it is recorded that \"none appeared for George's Creek, neither any from the lower parts.\" The meeting-house must have been built originally on ground not owned by the Friends, for it was not until the year 1769, sixty-four or sixty-five years after the house had been erected, that they received a deed for the land.\n\nThe old meeting-house constructed on this land was used uninterruptedly down to the year 1800, after which date it went rapidly to ruin, and by 1831, had entirely disappeared. It was built of stone, and its dimensions were about thirty by twenty-five feet. In addition to this meeting-house, the Friends of Duck Creek also built a school-house, which like wise has disappeared, and nothing now remains of this ancient place of Quaker meetings but the old graveyard, a melancholy monument of departed days.\n\nThe first mention of Mispillion Friends occurs on the 19th day of the third month, 1707, when, according to the minutes of the Duck Creek meeting, \"Joseph Booth and Mark Man love appeared for Mushmillion\" (Mispillion). Mispillion, at that time, it must be remembered, included the present limits of Milford Hundred. Friends in that vicinity, the lower part of Mispillion, in these early years, were holding their meetings under the direction of Duck Creek Friends, first at the house of Matthew Manlove, and then at the house of Reynear Williams. The first mention of their meeting-house is in 1790, when on the thirteenth of November, five acres of land were conveyed to the trustees of Murderkill Meeting for the erecting and supporting a meeting-house and school-house. This meeting-house was used for many years, but has now entirely disappeared.\n\nThe Friends of Little Creek Hundred soon took steps looking to the establishment of a meeting of their own, for the records show, that as early as 1710, a request was received from the Friends of Little Creek (Hundred), that they have the privilege of \" a meeting of worship every first day among themselves.\" This request was granted, and in 1714 they were accorded the right to maintain \"a meeting of worship distinct from Duck Creek, of which it (they) hath hitherto been a part.\" A meeting-house was built in 1771, but subsequently abandoned for the present meeting-house, which was erected on land sold in 1802 by Jabez Jenkins, \"in trust for the people called Quakers.\" This old meeting-house still stands near Little Creek, its original location. Since 1865 it has ceased to be used for religious purposes. In 1888 it passed out of the hands of the Friends. Its old graveyard is yet used for purposes of interment.\n\nIn the year 1712 the Duck Creek Friends went into Murderkill Hundred and held a Monthly Meeting at the house of the widow Needham at Murder Creek. At this meeting one Robert Porter was appointed overseer of the weekly meetings at Murder Creek. Thus a meeting was established there under the supervision of Duck Creek. Their house was erected on the road from Dover to Magnolia, where their old graveyard now is. Their deed was dated May 17, 1760, and the land is described as being a part of the tract \"Folly Neck,\" comprising one acre,\" by the Branch at the going over of the Kings Road.\" This house was burned in 1760. In 1759, Ezekiel Nock and others, had put in a request, which was duly granted by the Duck Creek Friends, that they might hold a meeting during the winter season at a certain house near Tidbury. Now that the Murderkill house had been burned (it was located not far from Tidbury), these Friends who had had the privilege of a meeting near Tidbury during the winter season, further petitioned for another meeting, and stated \"that the members being few, some of them inclined to have a house built that might accommodate them and their friends settled about Tidbury, who lye remote from any meeting.\" The petition was granted, and after some discussion as to the location of the new meeting-house, a committee finally decided upon the old site. A brick structure was thereon erected. This building was used until 1844, when Henry McIlvaine purchased it and razed it to the ground. The old graveyard remains, and has recently been neatly enclosed by a substantial fence.\n\nThe last meeting of Friends to be established in Kent County was that at Camden. In 1805 or 1806 a building was erected which was intended to serve the double purpose of a meeting-house and a school-house. It stands to-day on the road from Camden to Wyoming, and was described in the original deed as \"lying in or near the village of Camden, on the main road leading from said village to the Poor-house.\" In 1828 Murderkill Meeting was united to Duck Creek, and in 1830 both these were united to Camden. Under the name \"Camden Monthly Meeting,\" meetings were held alternately at Camden and Little Creek. At present Camden is the sole survivor of the Friends congregations in Kent County, all the others having passed with the passing years.\n\nThe Episcopalians were close rivals with the Quakers for the honor of having been the first to plant a church in the county of Kent. The venture was purely a missionary undertaking inaugurated by the venerable \"Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts.\" For a period of about three-quarters of a century, the Episcopalians of Kent County were under the spiritual care of one clergyman, or rather one missionary. Strictly speaking, Dover was his residence, and Kent County his parish. In the year 1781 Christ Church at Milford became detached from the Dover rector's parish, but the other churches, Dover and Duck Creek, continued their union until the year 1831.\n\nThe first mention of religious work by this denomination in Kent County appears in the form of \" a memorial to the Bishop of London, signed by twenty-two inhabitants of Dover, representing the increase of sin and crimes and the consequent great want of a minister of the gospel, and their willingness to contribute as far as they are able to his maintenance,\" recorded in 1703. The next year subscriptions to the amount of Â£55 17s. were raised by the Dover people, and Col. Robert French donated the glebe for the embryonic church. At this date (1704) Dover had not been laid out, though its location was to all intents and purposes fixed upon. The glebe, a portion of the tract, \"Porter's Lodge,\" consisted of one hundred and ten acres, and lay on the east side of Jones' creek, about a mile and a half below the present town of Dover. Just where on the glebe the church was built, is uncertain. \"Tradition has it,\" says the Rev. L. W. Gibson, \"at the southwestern corner, near the creek, and beside the road which then ran along the bank of the creek.\" The exact date of its construction is also unknown, though it seems to have been about the year 1707, for in 1708 Rev. Thomas Crawford mentions preaching in \"the church,\" and of its being \"near finished.\"\n\nThomas Crawford was sent over as a missionary to the people of Dover in the year 1705. Under his influence the church grew rapidly, for in addition to building the church at Dover, he increased the number of his congregation, having baptized in his own church in three years two hundred and twenty or two hundred and thirty persons. His work was not confined to Dover. He preached at stated intervals at both the upper and lower end of the county, and even went down into Sussex, preaching the word. For all of this work he complains that he \"had not had Â£20 Pennsylvania money per annum.\" Under the Rev. Crawford's charge, the beginnings of St. Peter's church of Smyrna were made, for he visited the people of that vicinity then known as Duck Creek, in the performance of his ministerial duties, though their church was not permanently established until about 1740, when it was known as the Duck Creek Church. In the lower end of the county the Rev. Mr. Crawford preached in Mispillion, about three miles west of the present town of Milford. The precise spot is unknown, but he laid the foundation of what became Christ Church, Milford. This church had no building of its own, no building at least of which there is accurate knowledge, until about the year 1745.\n\nMr. Crawford returned to England in the year 1711, and in that same year his successor, the Rev. Mr. Henderson, came over to minister to the spiritual wants of the people of Kent. Upon the arrival of Mr. Henderson, it became apparent that the Presbyterians had gained considerable strength in Dover, the center of Episcopalian activity, for a Mr. Medstone of the Presbyterian persuasion protested against the coming of Mr. Henderson, alleging that the ground on which the Episcopalians had erected their primitive little church had been given by a gentleman of the Presbyterian faith, and that, by the terms of the deed granting it, any orthodox minister could preach there, that the greatest number of the people were Presbyterians, and, therefore, Mr. Henderson should be rejected, and in his stead a minister should be secured who was reared in the doctrines of Presbyterianism. Mr. Henderson, however, remained, but only for a short time, leaving probably the same year.\n\nSoon after his departure, it seems that the people were about ready to receive a Presbyterian minister in their church, for, in 1715, the missionary at New Castle wrote \"that design was entirely ruined by my preaching amongst them, that every Sunday the Dissenters were to take possession of our own pulpits.\" From this letter it would appear that after the departure of Mr. Henderson, the Dover Church was occasionally visited by the missionary at New Castle, and possibly was under his supervision.\n\nIn 1717 the church was in danger of decay because of the inroads made by the Dissenters. A long vacancy in the post of missionary was the opportunity for its opponents, both ecclesiastical and secular, to check its growth, and in 1722 a petition from Thomas French and one hundred and twenty five others, from Kent County, requesting that an orthodox minister be sent among them, set forth the destitute condition of the church and the dangers which threatened its existence in Kent County. It states, \"We have, since 1711, been wholly destitute. A great number of our people are by this means gone over to the Presbyterians and Quakers; our house, built for religious worship, is empty, meeting-houses are full; enthusiasts abound; the Sabbath is profaned; the interest which the Church of England once had here is in great danger to be entirely lost, and we have no opportunity to worship God publically in a manner agreeable to the word of God and our Consciences.\" Petition followed upon petition, and finally, in 1733, the Rev. George Frazier was sent to the Dover church.\n\nShortly after his arrival, a subscription was begun for the purpose of building a new brick church at Dover, the old one along the creek having fallen into a state of ruin. This new building was begun; but was not sufficiently completed for the purposes of use until after the arrival of the Rev. Arthur Usher in 1740. Under the Rev. Usher's ministry two chapels were begun and completed. Both of these chapels were within the territory under the care of the Dover rector. One of them built by the Duck Creek congregation between 1740 and 1744; the other one was built by the Mispillion congregation, near Milford, and was completed before 1745. Much delay was encountered in completing the brick church at Dover owing to the poverty of its communicants.\n\nUsher was succeeded in the rectorship by the Rev. Mr. Morrison, who was succeeded by the Rev. Hugh Neill, who in turn was succeeded by the Rev. Charles Inglis. Mr. Inglis arrived as missionary at Dover in 1759. During the years covered by the work of the first three men, the Episcopal church at Dover and its branches at Duck Creek and Mispillion experienced great discouragements. In 1751 the Rev. Hugh Neill says \"Dover Church is in a miserable condition. It looks more like a refuge for wild beasts than a house dedicated to the service of God.\" The two chapels were, presumably, in as destitute a condition as the main church.\n\nWith the coming of Charles Inglis, a man who seems to have been the greatest among the pioneer missionaries of Kent County, sent out by the venerable society, and who late in life attained to a position of lofty eminence in his church, the good Episcopalian people of Dover, Duck Creek and Mispillion seemed to take fresh hope and to rouse themselves to renewed activity. \"The Dover Church which lay in a most shocking condition when I came here,\" says Mr. Inglis, \"was repaired.\" In 1762 the congregation at Duck Creek was moved by the power of his preaching to subscribe liberally to building a \"new brick church of larger dimensions,\" and the Mispillion congregation made an addition to their building. It seems that a fourth church, which Mr. Inglis called St. Paul's, was in process of building on the border of Maryland. Under the rectorship of Mr. Inglis the Duck Creek church was named St. Peter's, and the Mispillion church was named Christ Church, both of which names have been retained by the Smyrna and Milford churches respectively.\n\nThe Rev. Charles Inglis having terminated the period of his successful labors in Kent County in the year 1766, the Rev. Samuel Magaw took charge of the church in the same year. During his rectorate the Duck Creek church was completed. With the departure of Mr. Magaw, the church at Mispillion seems to have severed its connection with the Dover and Duck Creek churches, and from that time to the present it has been a separate station.\n\nThe Rev. Samuel Magaw served his churches from 1766 until about 1781. During his rectorate, about 1767, Dover church adopted the name Christ Church. The advent of the Revolution absorbed the attention of the people, and the churches consequently suffered. A lapse occurs in their records until the year 1786. From that date the names of Christ Church, Dover, and St. Peter's, at Smyrna, are intimately associated. The Revolution having passed, these churches took steps to revive interest in their work, for they appointed a committee to attend to the securing of \"a clergy man of piety, religion, morality, and sound principles.\" The outcome was the employment of the Rev. Samuel Roe at a salary of $300.00, two hundred to be paid by the Dover church, and one hundred by the Duck Creek or Smyrna church. Upon the termination of Mr. Roe's rectorship, about 1790, the history of the two churches becomes obscure. The Rev. Robert Pigott was the last clergyman to serve both the parishes of Dover and Duck Creek. From the termination of his rectorship, in 1833, the churches have a separate history.\n\nAs to the size of the Episcopal church in these years, we have the statement of Mr. Crawford in 1705 that Dover church had a congregation from thirty upwards as high as two hundred. In 1741 the Rev. Arthur Usher says that in his \"parish there are three hundred and eighty-two adults of the Church . . . My communicants are about thirty-two.\" In 1743 he says, \"In the County there are five hundred and eight of the Church of England.\" At about 1761 the Rev. Charles Inglis says there are seven thousand souls in the county, and \"upwards of one-third are members of the Church of England.\" The Rev. Samuel Magaw states, in 1769, that his communicants numbered ninety-four. In 1818 about twenty families were attached to Christ Church at Dover. At a comparatively early date in the religious history of Kent County, the Presbyterians make their appearance. By 1711 a goodly number of that sect were residing in Dover, and it was the Presbyterians, as well as the Friends, whom the Episcopalians designated as the \"dissenters,\" who made such inroads upon their congregations. In 1723 there was a sufficient number of Presbyterians in Kent County to warrant a request to the Presbytery that a minister be sent them who could devote the whole of his time to them instead of a minister who could come into the county only once a month. Down to 1726, however, they were compelled to content themselves with occasional supplies. But in that year one McCook, a licentiate, was ordered by the Presbytery to \"supply the people of Kent, on Delaware, for ordinary (regularly) until the next meeting.\" On June 8, 1727, Mr. McCook was duly ordained and installed the first regular pastor of the Presbyterians of Kent County.\n\nThe exact date of the construction of the various church buildings under Mr. McCook's charge is largely a matter of doubt, as is also the exact date of the organization of the congregations themselves. By the year 1727 there were Presbyterian meetings at Dover, Duck Creek, Murderkill, and at a place called St. Jones. Where the St. Jones church was is problematical. There seems to be some authority for its identity with the Dover church. All the facts considered, however, it is more reasonable to believe that it was a distinct church, located probably in what is now \"Jones Neck.\"\n\nSubsequent to the formation of these congregations, the \"Three Runs\" church in Mispillion, near Milford, was organized. Its name appears of record as early as 1793, when it is spoken of as one of the churches under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Mr. McKee. All of these churches were under the care of one minister, and Dover was the central point for his activities. The church in Dover was the parent church, dating its birth probably to the year 1714 or 1715.\n\nMcCook served the people of Kent County until his death in 1729, a little over two years after his installation. The congregations were then served by supplies for two years, when Robert Cathcart was called. He declined to come. The church records are 6ilent from this time down to the year 1758. During this period of silence, though the Presbyterians of Kent County may have been compelled at intervals to content themselves with occasional supplies, yet they had at times resident ministers. From 1734 until his death in 1744, the Rev. Robert Jamison preached near Smyrna, and a part of that time at least in Dover, for in 1743 a deed confirming the title to the Dover church lot was made to \"Robert Jamison, minister,\" and others. Jamison was probably the first regular minister to officiate in the new church edifice near Smyrna. This building was erected about the year 1733, a little south of the town of Smyrna, on a tract known as Holy Hill, now used as a cemetery. His duties extended to the care of all the Kent County congregations.\n\nFive years after his death, the Rev. John Miller took charge of the congregations, receiving a call from the Dover and Smyrna churches in the year 1749. He served them for over forty-two years. Under his pastorate the old log church in Dover, that stood just south of the present Presbyterian church, was torn down and replaced by a brick one in 1790. John Miller was succeeded by his son, Samuel Miller, who later became the distinguished professor of Princeton Seminary. He remained but a short time, for a call from the United Presbyterian congregations of New York induced him to leave Kent County.\n\nVarious attempts were made to secure a suitable successor to Mr. Miller. Mr. Francis McMullen Gardner, Mr. McKee, one Mr. Hindman, and the Rev. John C. Brush, served in turn for short periods each, the last of whom was removed because of the erroneous doctrines of Priestly, which he entertained. After this date there seems to have fallen upon the Presbyterians of Kent County a depression of spirit. At all events the churches ceased to be active. In 1818 it was recorded that \"the congregations of Dover and the Three Runs were for some time extinct.\" The Smyrna church shared also in the decline of interest, and the Murderkill church entirely and permanently succumbed.\n\nIn the year 1818, however, there was a general revival. The Rev. Elisha P. Swift resuscitated Dover, and the churches at Three Runs and Smyrna were revived. Dover, however, soon relapsed into its former state, as also did Three Runs and Smyrna. In 1823 there was no Presbyterian church in Dover, and Presbyterians had the privilege of hearing service conducted by a preacher of their own faith only \"once or twice a year, when some missionary passed along.\" The services at Dover at about this time were conducted in the State house, the church having fallen into a state of decay. But in 1825, through the influence of Mrs. Leah W. Morris, the church was reopened, and regular services held therein. The preacher was probably Rev. Alexander Campbell, who preached also at Smyrna. From 1825 to 1846 Presbyterianism in Kent County, it seems, barely maintained itself. In this period Dover church dwindled so in membership, that about 1831 the Legislature appointed a committee to look after the church property, inasmuch as there was no congregation to do so. The constitutional convention of that year held its sessions in the Presbyterian church, as had the convention of 1792. In 1834 only two members of the Presbyterian church could be found in Dover, but the next year it was reorganized by Dr. John Patton with a membership of ten. But its fortunes continued precarious, the church having only occasional services under the charge of preachers who came and went, until 1844, when the Rev. Thomas G. Murphey came to its assistance. From the time of his coming the church was put on a permanent basis and has continued an unbroken career down to the present, excepting during the years 1860 and 1861, immediately following Mr. Murphey's retirement from the charge.\n\nDuring these years the church at Smyrna materially decreased, the Dover pastor ministering also in Smyrna. With the arrival of Mr. Murphey, the Smyrna church, like the Dover church, took a fresh start. It purchased, in 1846, a building from the Methodist Protestants on Mount Vernon street in Smyrna. Mr. Murphey served the Smyrna congregation until October 5, 1859. From this date the Smyrna church, originally called Duck Creek, maintained a separate existence from the Dover church.\n\nThe history of the Three Runs Church, afterwards known as the Milford Church, during the years last mentioned, is almost unknown. It shared, however, in the revival that came to Presbyterianism in the county in the year 1818, for in 1819 there was an election of trustees in the Three Runs church. But from that date down to 1849 the church was inactive, probably favored with occasional meetings under the charge of the Dover and Smyrna preacher. From 1849 this church has a separate history of its own.\n\nMethodism did not make its appearance in Kent County until the last quarter of the eighteenth century. The churches of the other denominations, above spoken of, had already attained a comparatively firm footing. But it was not long before the Methodists had attained to a remarkable growth. A history of the State, published in 1807, is authority for the statement that \"the Methodists compose nearly one-half of the population of the counties of Kent and Sussex.\" The method of work with the Methodists was characteristic of them, decidedly evangelistic. Freeborn Garretson, Francis Asbury, Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Coke, were among the pioneer preachers of this denomination in Kent County. They went about preaching wherever they could gather together an audience; in the open, as when Garretson preached to the mob from the steps of the old academy in Dover in 1778, and Asbury to a congregation of three hundred in an orchard near Smyrna in 1780; or in the homes of people throughout the county, as was done at the home of Judge Thomas White in Mispillion. The church grew rapidly, and meeting-houses soon began to spring up all over the county. In 1779 Thomas Chapel was built; in 1780 Barratt's Chapel, Bethel Church, White's Chapel, and Green's Chapel at Canterbury. Dover and Severson's followed soon after, and then came Milford and Blackistons and Camden, all before the year 1800. Thus, in about a quarter of a century, Methodism made phenomenal gains, and continued its development until at present the Methodists constitute a large majority of the church-going population of the county.\n\nThese churches were, in 1773, a part of the Baltimore circuit, and the preachers in charge were Francis Asbury, Robert Strawbridge, Abraham Whitworth and Joseph Yearby. The next year the old Kent County, Maryland, circuit, was formed, in which was included all the territory now embraced within the limits of the Wilmington Conference. This circuit was divided in 1778, and the Kent County, Delaware, churches were thrown into the new Caroline circuit. In the following year the Delaware circuit was formed. Kent County was within its bounds. In the year 1781 three circuits were formed out of Delaware circuit, namely, Kent, Delaware, and Sussex circuits. In 1782 Kent was merged into Sussex circuit. The whole State of Delaware is now included within the bounds of the Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nCIVIL LIST OF KENT COUNTY.\n\nProthonotaries.\n\nWilliam Rodeney . . . 1693-1702\n\nBenjamin Shurmer . . . 1702-1735\n\nHugh Durburrow . . . 1735-1736\n\nJohn Houseman . . . 1736-1738\n\nSamuel Chew . . . 1738-1743\n\nNicholas Ridgley . . . 1743-1755\n\nJohn Vining . . . 1755-1770\n\nSamuel Chew . . . 1770-1777\n\nJames Sykes . . . 1777-1793\n\nJoseph Hale . . . 1793-1803\n\nJohn Hamin . . . 1803-1805\n\nJonathan Pollen . . . 1805-1807\n\nJames Harper . . . 1807-1810\n\nNathaniel Smithers . . . 1810-1820\n\nJoseph Smithers . . . 1820-1830\n\nJohn H.

Conrad, 1908 ] tr. by mkk\n\nANOTHER SOURCE\n\nAs of 1899\n\nNext in order as we move down the peninsula comes the County of Kent. It is the middle one of the tier. Originally it formed a part of the \"Hoorn Kill\" district, and became an independent territory under the name of St. Jones County in 1680, and until Dover was laid out there was not a village of any importance within its borders. It was little better than a wild. When it was changed to Kent county is not certainly known, but it was probably done when, in November, 1682, William Penn summoned the magistrates of St. Jones and \"Hoorn Kill\" to meet him at New Castle, in order to confer regarding the condition of the people and the territory. In 1683, the year after this meeting, Penn ordered Dover to be laid out. The General Assembly, sitting at New Castle, passed a bill making Dover the State Capital May 12, 1777, and it has so continued to the present time.\n\nDover is beautifully situated on a rich alluvial plain, at the head of tide on St. Jones' Creek, six miles west of Delaware Bay, thirty-six north from Georgetown, the county seat of Sussex county, and forty-five south of Wilmington. It was founded soon after the arrival of William Penn, by English settlers who were attracted thither by the beauty and fertility of the land, and the easy means of communication with the bay via St. Jones' Creek, which is navigable for small vessels. Kent county contains 613 square miles and is divided into nine hundreds, viz: Duck Creek, Little creek, Kenton, West Dover, East Dover, North Murderkill and South Murderkill.\n\nThe county is apportioned into ten Representative and five Senatorial districts. According to the census of 1890 Dover had a population of 3,061. The number has somewhat increased since that time. The country surrounding Dover is highly cultivated and yields luxuriant crops. THe surface is rolling and presents a charming appearance, There are many handsome residences in the town, which betoken wealth and culture on the part of their owners. The public buildings are plain modern brick structures, facing the square. As the House of Representatives consists of only thirty-five members, a large hall is not required for their accommodation. The Senate is composed of seventeen members, consequently a small chamber suffices. The executive and other departments are in the same building, and are conveniently arranged for the transaction of public business. The State Library, which contains a very full collection of the laws, is convenient of access. In addition to legal books and general literature, its unique treasure is a copy of one of the earliest printed Bibles known to be in existence. This precious volume is, by direction of the Legislature, securely preserved in a glass case. A free circulating library, well supplied with books, is kept in a room over the post office, and is open to the public two days in the week.\n\nDover is easy of access by railroad. When its age and beauty of situation are considered, the wonder is that it has not attained greater size. However, there is an air of quiet dignity about the place which favorably impresses visitors, and on every hand there are evidences of refinement and culture, such as are not found in every state capital. Beautifully shaded streets are inviting for drives in summer time. Churches and schools betoken the good character of the inhabitants. In the cemeteries repose the remains of many men who were eminent as statesmen and divines, and their stately monuments show that their memories have been sacredly preserved by those who came after them.\n\nMispillion Creek, which is the dividing line between Kent and Sussex counties, also runs through the borough of Milford, a small portion of which is thrown into Sussex county. The Mispillion is a stream of some magnitude and is navigable for several miles for small boats."
