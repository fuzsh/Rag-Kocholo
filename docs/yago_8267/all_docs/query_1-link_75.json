        "text": "Could a dead woman's body really fit into a fishing cooler?\n\nErin Reilly Lee, also known as Juror No. 8 on the capital murder trial of wealthy Wilmington lawyer Thomas J. Capano, was trying to answer that question when she wedged herself into the white Igloo cooler that played a grisly role in one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nIt was a key piece of evidence in the haunting case that still resonates 20 years after Capano's November 1997 arrest because it echoes current headlines: men in positions of power trying to exert absolute control over their alleged victims.\n\nThe 12-week trial kept the public riveted from October 1998 to January 1999.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of his younger, secret girlfriend, Anne Marie Fahey, into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by Deborah A. MacIntyre, one of his other longtime mistresses. Capano, married with four daughters, would later blame MacIntyre for Fahey's death.\n\nThe day after Fahey's mysterious June 1996 death, Capano, with the help of his youngest brother, Gerry, used the cooler to transport Fahey's body to Gerry's boat Summer Wind at Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nSummer Wind motored east about 60 to 75 miles, Gerry testified, where he then gave his brother an anchor and chain and turned his back on the scene unfolding on deck. Gerry told the court that Tom Capano vomited, then put a body into the ocean. According to testimony, he turned around in time to see a human foot sink into the deep waters.\n\nTom Capano told his attorney Joseph S. Oteri that he first rejected putting Fahey's body into a brand-new garbage can. Instead, Capano used a 40½-gallon cooler, purchased two months before Fahey's death. Capano’s brother Joseph, who died of a heart attack in 2015, said he told Tom to buy the cooler as a gift for brother Gerry.\n\nTwo and half years after Fahey died, the jury hearing Capano's murder trial was sequestered at the Hilton Wilmington/Christiana near Stanton.\n\nDeliberations lasted three days.\n\nCapano case: For complete coverage, including past stories, videos and more\n\n\"Honestly, a lot of people would be surprised to know that when we first went in to deliberate, first thing we did was take a poll to see where everybody stood and it was half and half,\" said Lee, who counted herself among the not-guilty votes.\n\nLee recalled one of the jurors said: \"'We should see if she could really just fit [into the cooler].'\"\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time and known as Erin Reilly, was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey. Sitting at a big table in a hotel conference room, she felt all eyes on her.\n\nAlthough one of her fellow jurors said she didn't need to do it, Lee agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler that served as a makeshift coffin. She left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height.\n\n\"This is important,\" Lee remembers telling herself. \"It's important for everybody. It's important for me because I didn't know.\"\n\nJurors helped the young woman into the cooler and then watched as Lee tried to \"squoosh myself smaller\" to give others an accurate picture.\n\n\"My eyes were closed for sure,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why. Probably because I didn't want to see.\"\n\nAs jurors attempted to shut the cooler's lid, Lee recalls being surrounded by a darkness she had never known.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones to make her body fit. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nBut Lee and the other jurors soon learned it wasn't the gentle tuck-in Capano had described.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became real and overwhelming.\n\n\"OK,\" Lee remembers another juror saying. \"That's enough. Let's get her out.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. Lee sat alone and sobbed.\n\nTears fell for Fahey, a troubled, insecure, single woman who wanted to end an off-and-on, three-year affair with the then 46-year-old Capano, a controlling, jealous, married lover who wouldn't let her walk away.\n\nAs she cried, Lee, only two years younger than the victim, said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\nThe climb into the cooler-turned-casket convinced Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nIt was Capano who shot Fahey, the jury determined.\n\nWilliam Swain Lee, the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, said he was walking on the beach Saturday, January 16, 1999, when his beeper went off.\n\n\"I had to run about a mile to get back to my car, drive to my house to get to a telephone, and call in,\" he said.\n\nThe jury had reached a verdict.\n\n\"We had to go find everyone,\" Judge Lee added. \"The lawyers were in different restaurants in a three-state area. So, the soonest we could get together was Sunday morning and I did not think that once it was announced that the jury had reached a verdict that we could take a day off.\n\n\"We needed to get it out, so I scheduled the unusual Sunday morning session.\"\n\nSunday morning the jury found Capano, then 49, guilty of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nJudge Lee sentenced Capano to death.\n\nIt was a stunning fall from grace for the prominent Wilmington attorney who had once counseled a Delaware mayor and governor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder. In just 31 months, Capano had gone from admired power broker to pariah.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\nMore: Prosecutor Colm Connolly: Tom Capano tried to take a hit out on me\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Search set for Carper assistant\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: 300 Join in Fahey search\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: FBI search for Fahey may go on\n\nThe case was revived again in 2006 when Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nBy then, years of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" said Colm F. Connolly, the unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation and endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks and, at one point, plans to put a hit on him.\n\nCapano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" Judge Lee said.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial and now lives near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nMore: 'This is Tom, Tom Capano,' said the man on the phone\n\nCapano's obituary said he \"was many things to many people, but most of all he was a loving father who will be greatly missed by his [four] daughters.\"\n\nIt touched upon Capano's love of music and places in Wilmington, some no longer open. The man the family called \"Tommy,\" the obituary said, was known for \"his impeccable taste: blasting old classics – the Temptations, the Four Seasons, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones – at full volume while waiting to pick up pizza from Gallucio's; allowing his daughters to skip school on their birthdays for a luxurious lunch at the Rodney Square Club; ordering an assortment of mouthwatering seafood from DiNardo's with extra Old-Bay seasoning.\"\n\nThe obituary did not mention the murder conviction.\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Capano held in murder of Anne Marie Fahey\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: The Capanos: A house in ruins\n\nTwenty years after he was arrested, the Thomas J. Capano murder mystery continues to fascinate because of its alluring – and grim – elements: sex, power, wealth, politics, secret affairs, lurid moments and an extraordinary reversal of fortune that wouldn't ring true if written in a crime novel.\n\n\"It was amazing the twists and turns throughout the case, especially during the trial,\" said Connolly, then an assistant U.S. attorney who had never before tried a murder case.\n\nWorking with Ferris W. Wharton, a seasoned state prosecutor with nearly 20 years' experience running murder trials, Connolly and his team won a first-degree murder conviction and a death sentence – even though there was no body, no witnesses to the killing and no found murder weapon.\n\nMore: Prosecutor Ferris Wharton: The moment I remember the most is the cooler\n\nIt would be Connolly's one-and-only murder trial. He is now managing partner of the Wilmington law office of Morgan Lewis.\n\n\"I do think the reality is, and I'll have to accept, it was the ultimate professional experience I will ever have, and I was very young to have had it,\" said Connolly, who was 33 when the trial began.\n\nOn the other side of the courtroom, Capano's defense was made up of four well-known criminal defense lawyers who frequently squabbled with their client.\n\nMore: Defense attorney Maurer: I wanted to withdraw from Tom Capano case\n\n\"Often dubbed the ‘Dream Team,’ the defense in this case became a nightmare,\" Eugene J. Maurer Jr. wrote in an essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\nAdded Maurer: \"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life.\"\n\nJoseph S. Oteri, the Boston lawyer who led Capano’s “Dream Team,” was more blunt about representing Capano: “I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.”\n\nOteri said he is usually the man in charge. But Capano’s insistence on running the case got in the way.\n\n“He was taking advice from people in the jail rather than the people he was paying for and it was tough,” Oteri told The News Journal. “It didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, ‘You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?’”\n\n“‘Nah, nah,’” Oteri quoted Capano as saying. “We're doing fine. We're all right.\"\n\nJudge Lee said it was tough going for the defense.\n\n“Capano was always confident he was going to win and it was clear he considered himself smarter than his excellent group of lawyers,” the judge said.\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Cooler found in Fahey case\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: FBI sought weapons in Capano's home\n\nAnne Marie Fahey wanted – and believed – she had escaped Capano's dominance and intimidation.\n\n\"For one whole year, I allowed someone to take control of every decision of my life,\" she wrote in her diary April 7, 1996 – one of the final entries.\n\nHer plan was to move forward with a kind man younger than Capano. It was not to be. A little more than two months after that last entry, Fahey was reported missing.\n\nFahey's remains have never been found. One of the few places to mourn and remember her is a memorial bench erected in 2006 that sits in Wilmington's Brandywine Park. “In our hearts forever,” reads the inscription.\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Power broker now pariah\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Guilty as charged\n\nEvidence from the case, relatively untouched since 1999, today collects dust in a vault at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center on Wilmington's King Street, formerly called the New Castle County Courthouse.\n\nIt serves as both an elegy and a 1990s time capsule with cassettes and videotapes of interviews with Capano's brothers, handwritten lists of state and defense witnesses –– and pieces of a life that ended much too soon.\n\nUsually, evidence is given away to the defense or destroyed after a defendant’s death.\n\n\"This is the only dead person I still have evidence for,\" said Colleen Redmond of the Prothonotary's office as she looked over items from the trial.\n\n\"The court said we shouldn't get rid of it,\" despite Capano’s death six years ago, she said.\n\nFolded up is a then-fashionable, size 6, cream-and-blue floral Laura Ashley dress. It is possibly the long, springtime dress Fahey bought to wear to Winterthur's Point-to-Point steeplechase races with her boyfriend Michael Scanlan, then community affairs chief of MBNA America Bank, whom she hoped to marry.\n\nAuthorities believe one of the reasons Capano killed Fahey was his jealousy of Scanlan, a devout Catholic who testified his relationship with Fahey was not sexual. Scanlan didn't know about Fahey's involvement with Capano until after her death.\n\nAccording to his Linkedin profile, Scanlan left MBNA in June 1999 and is now assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. He also works as a photographer shooting high school sports, portraits and does some commercial work.\n\nGone from the evidence vault are Fahey's wallet, jewelry box and the diary that gave investigators much-needed clues that pointed to her murderer. Her family took those items years ago, court officials say.\n\nBut, still in the vault are the copies of letters mistress MacIntyre wrote daily to Capano in prison before she turned on him in February 1998 and became a key witness for the prosecution. Some of the letters from the divorced MacIntyre, a Capano girlfriend for more than 15 years, begin with the greeting, \"Hey Handsome.\"\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Death for Capano\n\nMore: ARCHIVE: Capano found dead in prison\n\nFinally, there are two 162-quart Igloo ice coolers – one used as a demonstration in court, and one the actual cooler, and Fahey's coffin. Inside of it rests a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nIn one of the case's most surprising twists, the abandoned cooler was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean by four fishermen about a week after Gerry Capano unsuccessfully tried to sink it by firing a slug into it with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun.\n\nThe fishermen, who kept it in a shed, turned it over to prosecutors the day after reading media accounts of Capano's arrest in November 1997.\n\nJudge Lee, in a recent interview, said it is astonishing that the cooler had been discovered off Indian River Inlet, 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\n\"It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Judge Lee said. \"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now.”\n\nConnolly said bringing the actual cooler into court on Dec. 2, 1998, just before the state rested its case, still stays with him nearly 20 years later.\n\n\"I will never forget that moment. It was dead silent. It was a dark day, so not much light was coming in the windows of the courtroom,\" he said. \"Ferris and I walked the cooler in front of the jury. It was as if we were pallbearers carrying the coffin into the court.\"\n\nJuror Erin Reilly Lee, no relation to Judge William Swain Lee, still gets chills seeing pictures of the Igloo cooler.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she told The News Journal after viewing photos. “You talk about divine intervention. There’s a great example.”\n\nWharton, now a Superior Court judge, said the court retains all the evidence while there's still ongoing litigation. But, after a defendant's death, it is then offered to the defense and/or destroyed after a period of time.\n\n\"It would surprise me if they got rid of all that evidence just because of the interest in it. People kept wanting to look at it for various reasons,\" Wharton said.\n\nOn the anniversary of Capano's arrest, The News Journal has asked some principal players to recall their memories of the investigation and trial.\n\nEssays and \"As Told To\" stories include thoughts from Connolly and Wharton, defense attorneys Maurer and Oteri, retired Judge Lee, former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck, former Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella, juror Erin Reilly Lee and psychiatrist Neil Kaye.\n\nTime has a way of fraying memories and, 20 years later, some participants have slightly different versions of the same story and others share never heard before details. The News Journal has tried to clarify and add context to some of their words using information from court records and articles from the paper's archives.\n\nStill, some of the people who were caught up in Capano's web of lies are more than ready to put the past behind them.\n\nMacIntyre is remarried and now working at the American Society of Cytopathology, a nonprofit organization in Wilmington. The office is near the old Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, now the home of the law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor. In the old courthouse two decades ago, she talked about her longtime affair with Capano and about buying a gun for him six weeks before Fahey died.\n\nMacIntyre, known now as Debby MacIntyre Sheldon, declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen reached by The News Journal via email on Nov. 13, she replied: \"I have no interest in talking about the case. Best regards, Debby MacIntyre Sheldon.\"\n\nThe Fahey family declined to be interviewed or write about their memories.\n\nAfter Anne Marie’s disappearance, her brothers, sister and extended family said they decided as a group to talk to media to keep attention on the case.\n\nWhile family members were concerned they would appear as seeking attention, they felt it was proper to keep the case in the public eye, and keep pressure on the Capano family.\n\nAfter the trial, the Faheys decided as a group to stop talking to the media, and to draw no more attention to themselves.\n\nMembers of the Capano family reached by The News Journal declined to comment.\n\nThe Thomas J. Capano case captivated Delaware that's known, for better or worse, as a clannish community, especially concerning its native sons and daughters.\n\n\"What's your name? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school?\" are frequent questions that start a connect-the-dots conversation about common acquaintances.\n\nTies could be made to Capano and Fahey, both from large Wilmington-area families with high-profile jobs.\n\n“You have Anne Marie Fahey who worked for the governor and she had a family that a lot of people knew. She was very attractive and very personable, and young,” Wharton said.\n\n“Everybody knew of the Capanos. He (Tom) was very prominent. He had been a prosecutor, a public defender, the administrative assistant to the Wilmington mayor. Capano had been a partner in a couple big law firms, Morris James and Saul Ewing. He had been the governor's legal counsel. And everybody knows of Capano because of all the development that they did,” Wharton said.\n\nFor a few days in the summer of 1996, the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey seemed to be little more than a missing person case.\n\nYears before being selected as a juror, Erin Reilly Lee remembers longtime friends talking about search parties being formed for a missing woman who’d grown up near her childhood neighborhood.\n\nFahey, a pretty and vivacious woman, went to dinner on June 27 with Capano at Ristorante Panorama on Front Street in Philadelphia. The eatery, which is still there, was considered one of the city's great wine destinations and featured classic Italian cuisine.\n\nCapano, married for 24 years, had recently separated from his wife. Going to Philadelphia was his routine. He had multiple mistresses and liked to take them on dates far away from his home and nosy, prying eyes in New Castle County.\n\n\"Wilmington is a small town, a gossipy place,\" he said on the witness stand on Dec. 17, 1998.\n\nAccording to a waitress that night, dinner wasn’t going so well. Capano ordered the food without consulting Fahey. They drank wine and picked at calamari and bruschetta, both looking miserable.\n\nFahey had met Capano in 1993, and wrote in her diary she fell in love with him on her January 1994 birthday. He lavished her with attention, gifts and visits to expensive restaurants. Capano also knew some of Fahey’s hidden secrets, such as she suffered from eating disorders.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Scanlan, who was unmarried and closer to her age. She wanted to end the affair with Capano. But when they left the Panorama restaurant at about 9:30 p.m. June 27, it would be the last time Fahey was seen in public.\n\nTwo days later, family and friends, concerned that she failed to keep a dinner date with Scanlan at her brother’s house, went to her 1718 Washington St. apartment on the third-floor and found it empty. They also find a diary Fahey kept where she wrote that Capano was “a jealous maniac.”\n\nCapano was questioned twice on June 30 at his $2,000 a month rental home at 2302 Grant Ave. in the city’s Highlands neighborhood. Police looked through his home and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but, at that time, found no signs of Fahey.\n\nMissing person photos of Fahey, a blue-eyed beauty with dark, curly hair, and yellow ribbons begin appearing on telephone poles, trees and signs around Wilmington. A billboard went up on I-95. Her family started a vigil on the front porch of the Washington Street apartment. They frequently met up at O’Friel’s Irish Pub, a then-popular bar in downtown Wilmington. Time marches on and the bar has closed. The building went up for sale in 2001 and later became a salon and spa.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton called Fahey’s boss, Gov. Tom Carper, now Delaware's senior senator, whom Fahey had worked for since her 1991 graduation from Dover's Wesley College.\n\nOn July 5, 1996, Clinton said the federal government would help with the search. However, it seems he forgot to notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, according to Connolly.\n\n“I was in the grocery store, the Acme on [U.S.] 202, and I ran into Judge Greg Sleet, who was the U.S. attorney, my boss. The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him,” Connolly said.\n\n“If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him. He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.”\n\nState prosecutors later agreed to bow out of the picture. A federal grand jury investigation, which had to remain secret, began.\n\nConnolly, leading a team of investigators, began methodically chipping away at the investigation by conducting interviews, searches, and combing through phone and financial records.\n\nOn July 26, 1996, he and Wilmington police investigator Bob Donovan discovered, through financial records, Capano had made a purchase at a company listed as Wallpaper Warehouse two days after Fahey was last seen in public alive.\n\n“I knew enough about Capano at that point, because we're a week or so into the investigation, I know that he was not the kind of guy who does home improvements himself. I know he's living in a rental house, so he wouldn't be buying wallpaper. I thought it was very weird,” Connolly said.\n\nThey called the number, the person who answered said, “Airbase Carpet.”\n\n“Immediately, Bob and I looked at each other, and thought, 'Oh my goodness, he rolled her up in the carpet. That's what this is all about,'\" Connolly said.\n\nInvestigators also learn later Capano has replaced a love seat, and an employee of Capano’s brother, developer Louis L. Capano Jr., tells them on July 1 he was ordered to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site.\n\nThey also find Capano has visited a Happy Harry’s store in Trolley Square on June 30 and asks about a blood remover.\n\nInvestigators search Capano’s house for 11 hours on July 31 and find two tiny drops of blood that they later learn matches a sample of Fahey’s blood plasma.\n\nA search takes place Aug. 12-16 of two local landfills to try and find the rug, sofa and other evidence. The search is messy, and officers come up empty.\n\nA turning point arrives in October 1997 when federal agents raid the Wilmington home of Capano's brother Gerry and find illegal drugs and guns.\n\nCapano's brothers Gerald and Louis agree to began cooperating with the authorities in November 1997 to avoid federal charges.\n\nGerry becomes a cooperating witness. He tells authorities that he took out his boat, Summer Wind, and helped Capano dispose of a body in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, June 28, 1996. He provided other incriminating evidence, including getting rid of a sofa with a basketball-sized bloodstain, and a rug.\n\nHis brother Louis says the stained sofa and rug were put into a dumpster on one of his properties.\n\nAfter the brothers began cooperation with the prosecution as part of a plea agreement, Capano is arrested on Nov. 12, 1997.\n\nWharton said Capano seemed to think he could get away with murder. Why?\n\n“Because he always had. He had done a lot of bad things that nobody ever called him into account for and he thought he could control things,” Wharton said.\n\n“He thought the investigation would be confined to the Wilmington police looking for a missing person which they were never going to be able to find.”\n\nIn February 1998, Deborah MacIntyre, a longtime Capano girlfriend, also signs a plea agreement and becomes a witness for the prosecution. She shares that she bought a .22-caliber gun at Capano’s request. It has never been recovered. MacIntyre also turns over her steamy letters she wrote to Capano and begins taping phone calls he makes to her from prison.\n\nAn outraged Capano asks an inmate, Nicholas Perillo, to arrange to burglarize MacIntyre’s house to intimidate her. The burglary never happened.\n\nDefense attorney Maurer will later accuse MacIntyre of firing the shot that killed Fahey. She vehemently denies it.\n\nThe case takes a twist when Capano attorney Joseph A. Hurley announces in early April 1998 he's quitting the defense team. Hurley, who had been friends with Capano for at least eight years, at that time would give no reason saying only that he will take it \"to his grave.\"\n\nOn Friday – 19 years later – he shared for the first time exclusively with The News Journal that a moment of moral clarity came to him while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill for public defender James F. McCloskey Jr.\n\nHurley sat in a pew, in his childhood church, and said he had a conversation with God.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way.'\"\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality he was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe said he'd never asked Capano what happened the night Fahey disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't want to ask him and hear the answer,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe left church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the case.\n\nNo longer considering him a friend, Hurley never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No. That's the end of friendship,\" Hurley said.\n\nCapano’s trial begins Oct. 6, 1998, with jury selection. Capano’s attorneys try to talk him out of selecting young women.\n\n“The last thing we wanted on a jury was women under 30 with a college education because they would identify immediately with the victim,” Boston lawyer Oteri said.\n\nJudge Lee recalled after the women were included on the jury, he was approached by Oteri who said, \"'Can I go off the record, Judge?' And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\nOteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\nOteri told The News Journal last week that he didn't recall the conversation.\n\nJudge Lee said he didn't know Capano when \"he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nOteri, who joined the defense team only months before the trial started, drops a bombshell in his opening statement: He says while Capano did dump Fahey’s body at sea, she died from an “outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.”\n\nCapano claims Fahey was shot to death accidentally by MacIntyre in a jealous fit of rage, while she was attempting suicide. \"His story is nonsense,\" Wharton said.\n\nAnd it just gets keep getting stranger.\n\nNeil S. Kaye, a psychiatrist who met Fahey hours before she meets Capano for dinner, shows up to testify in a wooden hat. It earns almost as much attention as what he has to say about Fahey’s fear of ending her relationship with Capano because of his “rage and anger.”\n\nKeith R. Brady, who is then Delaware’s chief deputy attorney and Wharton’s superior, is called to testify about a sexual encounter he had five years earlier with MacIntyre while Capano watched. Capano has said he was supposed to golf with Brady the day after Fahey's death. Connolly questions him on the stand for the prosecution, and Oteri delves into the encounter with MacIntrye. Brady takes an unpaid leave of absence after leaving the stand.\n\n“I don't think Keith ever really accepted the fact that he was going to be a witness. He always thought that was not going to happen,” Wharton said. “We were very discreet about that, the way we phrased our questions, but Oteri was not. Keith looked like he was a dead man up there.”\n\nConnolly reads up on Capano’s cases when he was prosecutor and believes the Wilmington lawyer killed Fahey based on a 1976 murder Capano had prosecuted. Connolly says a man called Robert “Squeaky” Saunders shot a victim in the head, threw the body in a canal and disposed of the gun.\n\nConnolly also continues to get under Capano’s skin. In a burst of anger, he calls Connolly “a heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace of a human being” and is removed from the courtroom.\n\nA final last-minute surprise comes when a neighbor of MacIntyre comes forward in the remaining few days of the trial to say she saw a sobbing MacIntyre stumble out of her car on the night around when Fahey is killed. The neighbor claims the area was lit by floodlights.\n\nBut Connolly tracks down a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, handyman who says he installed a new, brighter light fixture at MacIntyre’s house – six months after Fahey’s death.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the trial continues to be surreal for Erin Reilly Lee, whose willing venture into Fahey's plastic coffin helped bring focus to a divided jury and sealed Capano’s fate.\n\nHer journey began in Trolley Square, where Lee lived nearly oblivious to the developing Capano-Fahey saga.\n\nShe received a jury duty summons but was certain there were too many similarities between her and Fahey to be picked for jury duty. Lee went to the courthouse believing she would be sent away soon.\n\nWharton remembers that day. “Erin Reilly was a potential juror. She came in, in a plaid sort of jumper. She could have been Anne Marie Fahey. Tall, attractive. The defense lawyers wanted to strike her, but Capano insisted on keeping her because, I think, he thought, he could charm her.”\n\nAt voir dire, the process through which potential jurors are questioned by either the judge or a lawyer, Lee was interrogated then asked to leave the courtroom. When she returned, she was stunned when the judge said she’d been selected.\n\n“My brain just kind of stopped,” she said. “I was so shocked that I looked at him and I said, ‘I’m sorry. Excuse me, what did you say?’”\n\nShe remembers the somewhat taken aback judge reiterating that she’d been selected as a juror.\n\n“I kind of didn’t really hear a whole lot after that because I was thinking, ‘My mom is going to kill me. How am I going to be on this trial?’” Erin Reilly Lee said.\n\nAs the monthslong trial began, Lee watched the attorneys present evidence and question witnesses who would later help her, and others jurors, reach their conclusions. This includes Connolly questioning Capano about how he placed Fahey in the cooler.\n\n“Colm Connolly did such a phenomenal job of getting us to think about, could he really place this girl’s body into a big fishing cooler,” she said. “The way he would just keep pushing Tom.\n\n“Tom said, ‘I had this cooler that I was going to give to my brother and I panicked and so I just figured I’d put her body in there.’ ”\n\nBut Connolly kept pushing, wanting to know – and the jurors – if the body easily fit in or if bones had to be broken to make it fit.\n\n“When we were deliberating, it’s something that we kept coming back to,” Lee said. “You know, could she just fit?”\n\nWhen Lee didn’t fit, jurors realized that Capano was lying. It made it easier to find holes in other parts of his testimony.\n\nConnolly’s ability to bring out the anger in Capano, showed jurors another picture of the former prosecutor who, on the stand, was portraying himself as a meek man.\n\n“Colm did a great job at letting us see [Capano’s] anger and how he could turn,” she said.\n\n“It definitely was surprising. It’s not something I ever would even thought of happening in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.
