        "text": "Versions of this social media post admonishing food bank donors to do better has been floating around Facebook for a couple of weeks. A post that’s been appearing regularly on social media admonishing people to change the way they donate to food banks has valid points, but may apply mostly to small food pantries rather than large food banks. The post, which appears under many different names but is often dated Nov. 19, offers 20 tips it says were gathered from food bank customers the writer personally talked to. Among them: Don’t donate Kraft macaroni and cheese because it requires milk and butter, which is hard to get from “regular food banks.” Oil and spices are rarely donated and would be appreciated. People picking up food can’t use canned goods unless someone also donates a can opener. Feminine hygiene products and dishwashing detergents are items that people want and need. “The list is valid,” said Kim Turner, spokeswoman for the Food Bank of Delaware. “We do try to fill in some of the gaps but I think a very small food pantry that might not have the buying power that a food bank has.” The Food Bank relies on cash donations as well as food from individuals, corporations, food industry companies and the federal government. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, for example, started providing boxes of fresh produce as the COVID-19 pandemic began and that still continues. The Food Bank also buys additional fresh produce boxes because they are so popular. The cash that’s donated allows the Food Bank to bulk purchase items at discounts, she said. The Food Bank provides so much milk and butter that one person who attends their monthly drive-thru pantries sent a note saying they didn’t need as much butter. It’s true that oil and spices are rarely donated and Turner is sure their clients would appreciate them. She’s not aware of requests for can openers, but believes they also would be appreciated. “For people like us who have a kitchen that’s pretty much fully stocked, you don’t always think about ‘does a person have a can opener to open this can,’ so I think that’s something nice for people to think about,” she said. The Food Bank of Delaware does provide feminine hygiene products, as well as diapers and paper products. “We do try to purchase non-food products,” she said. “So whether that’s like toilet paper or paper towels, diapers for babies, we do try to keep those in stock so that our member agencies have access to them.” Turner pointed out that the Food Bank considers itself a supplemental source of food and necessities. “We’re hoping that people are also utilizing other resources,” she said. “If they’re eligible for SNAP (food stamps), we’re hoping that they’re applying for SNAP benefits so that they can buy those other items at the grocery store and then use us to supplement what they might not have enough money left over to purchase or for some of the more expensive items.” The Food Bank has pathways for people to donate meat and also fresh produce. Many farmers and home gardeners donate produce in the summer. Perdue, for example, has been donating massive quantities of chicken for almost a decade. Many area grocery stores freeze meats as they near their fresh buy-by date and donate them to the Food Bank. “We really like to build off our relationships with retailers to help eliminate food waste, so we pick up a lot of frozen meats from the grocery stores like hamburger, chicken, steaks, things that they aren’t able to sell but are still perfectly fine,” she said. The Food Bank gets weekly deliveries of milk and typically has butter on hand, she said. The social media post also goes on to say that those using a food bank would appreciate tea bags, coffee, fresh meat, eggs, cake mix and frosting. “We do try to get eggs out into the community. I don’t think it’s something that happens on a regular basis, but we do receive a lot of liquid egg product from USDA,” Turner said. “So that is a good supplement.” Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are on the Food Bank’s request list for holiday food drive donations. The Food Bank of Delaware typically asks for shelf-stable items from average donors. Its list for holiday food drive donations, for example, includes applesauce, cranberry sauce, oatmeal, cold cereals, pudding mix, canned pumpkin, graham cracker pie crust, canned gravy, rice, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, stuffing, hearty soups, corn muffin mix, canned sweet potatoes and yams, canned peas and green beans, 100% fruit juice, hot chocolate, coffee and tea, evaporated milk, turkey pans and frozen turkeys. As of 10 a.m. Wednesday, Nov. 24, the Food Bank and its partners had given away 5,926 turkeys. Bread is not routinely donated, but when it is, workers try to get it out quickly into the community. Turner said she had not heard of anyone asking for or “loving” Stove Top Stuffing or Rice-A-Roni in her 13 years at the Food Bank, although she personally likes Stove Top. The Food Bank asks for stuffing for the holidays, but she says they don’t buy Hamburger Helper or Rice-A-Roni, to her knowledge. Cake mixes also are something the Food Bank does not ask for or buy. That is something she hopes their clients would use their SNAP benefits for. “We do have a nutrition policy where we try to bring in as much nutritious foods as possible and then distribute those back out into the community because oftentimes what we hear from low-income people is that they have difficulties accessing fresh foods, nutritious foods,” Turner said. They also serve a lot of people who have diet-related conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease. “We don’t want the foods that we provide people to perpetuate those health conditions,” she said. “Obviously, everybody wants a cake and frosting for their birthday but it’s not like a basic staple.” […]\n\nIt’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas in these tasty Delaware spaces decorated for a festive holiday. Klondike Kate’s Sleigh Bar in Newark and Blitzen in Wilmington have returned to serve a cup of good cheer. To the south, Above the Dunes in Rehoboth is debuting a Miracle Pop-Up on Nov. 21. Schellville in Rehoboth has expanded its food and beer offerings, and Benvenuto in Milford has become a lovely Italian village during Christmas. Sleigh bells ring Once again, Klondike Kate’s has morphed into the pop-up Sleigh Bar, which has a special menu in addition to Kate’s regular offerings. Holiday Hummus, for instance, is a mix of green pesto and roasted red pepper hummus, while the Atomic Yule Log is a crisp pile of mozzarella sticks with a “yuletide” marinara sauce. To sip, try Goose Island IPA, Breckenridge Christmas Ale and Breckinridge Vanilla Porter. However, it’s the venue’s festive holiday décor, not the food, that will have you humming “Jingle Bells.” Picture glittery tinsel Christmas balls, nutcrackers, giant candles and barstool backs wearing Santa hats. The showpiece is the sleigh — the site of countless selfies. The promotion is the brainchild of special events director Nick Manerchia, who saw similar transformations in New York. Owner Gianmarco Martuscelli felt the concept would attract customers at a time when many students leave college for winter break. The Sleigh Bar started in 2019. “We experimented that first year, and it was a huge hit,” he recalled. “Every year, we add to it.” The Sleigh Bar appeals to families, friends and moms who brunch — and then gather in the sleigh for a photo opp. “It’s such a melting pot,” Martuscelli said. “You see kids smiling when they come in. People just love Christmas.” Hangin’ with Blitzen In downtown Wilmington, Blitzen is back for the fourth year. The bar imagines Blitzen’s seasonal den, and this reindeer certainly has style.

Owner Mike Day, who also has Farmer & the Cow on Market Street, wants to add a food element this year. Meanwhile, the holiday-inspired cocktails remain a draw. Festive holiday Miracle On Nov. 21, Above the Dunes in downtown Rehoboth Beach will open Miracle, a Christmas-theme pop-up bar with classic and kitschy décor and seasonal cocktails. Events will include a Santa Bar Crawl on Saturday, Dec. 3, Christmas trivia on Dec. 10 and an ugly sweater contest on Dec. 17. The restaurant is in the space previously occupied by Greene Turtle. Who’s Who in Schellville No doubt you’ll run into someone you know at Schellville, Schell Brothers’ over-the-top winter village in Seaside Outlet on Route 1 in Rehoboth. The event, which started in 2017, attracts more than 100,000 people. This year, there’s a sledding hill, live entertainment, tree houses, a snow zone, games and a train. Frosty’s Food Trucks are in the Magical Maze, and you can buy beer from Dewey Beer Co. and Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. Benvenuto to Tuscany! This popular Milford restaurant is the perfect place for dinner during the holidays, thanks to owner Lisa Johnson’s eye for detail. Johnson, who owns Benvenuto with her husband, Walton “Pancho” Johnson, has carefully decorated the dining areas, named for areas in Italy. There are shimmering Christmas trees, boughs of evergreen, flickering candles and tasteful touches of holiday red. The restaurant specializes in Tuscan-inspired cuisine, but if you love crab cakes, you must try Chef Jesus Gordiany’s version, which is full of sweet snowy lumps and comes with homemade sauces.\n\nDespite several recently announced changes to Wilmington’s towing contract, one outspoken critic is still worried. Ken Grant, who has been following the issue for the past 10 years, said that he doesn’t have faith that the proposed changes will be implemented. “They’re not addressing the real issue,” Grant said. “This is what the city does consistently. When they’re facing the kind of legitimate criticism that they’re facing now on this issue, they turn around and say, ‘Oh, we’re announcing a bunch of reforms.’ So you can find the reforms that they announced back in 2019 over all this. Which, again, absolutely positively, none of those reforms were put into place in 2019 or 2020 or 2021.” Grant said that he also has an issue with the money the city makes from parking tickets and impounding fees. “While this administration is not doing anything to proactively change anything, it did not initiate all of this stuff,” Grant said. “This goes back more than 20 years. What the city did was decide this was going to be a revenue generator. They were going to use parking tickets and enforcement to make money for the city. That’s when they raised the ticket price to $40.” John Rago, deputy chief of staff for the mayor of Wilmington, said people like Grant blow up issues to seem more noteworthy than they are. “What happens here in these situations is the Ken Grants of the world, they just use one or two instances, and then make it sound like there are 30 or 40 others,” Rago said. “But we’re fine with looking at anything that anyone brings to our attention. So far, nobody’s done that…we have to deal with facts here in the government.” In the city’s $275.3 million budget for the 2024 fiscal year, tickets and booting are projected to account for $1.4 million in revenue, down from $2.8 million in the previous fiscal year, $3.9 million in the 2016 fiscal year, and $5 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Related Story: Coalition asks Wilmington for info, talk about parking tickets, booting, towing The city of Wilmington announced May 23 that it would be updating its contract with City Towing Services. The changes to the contract include: City Towing will not charge towing or storage fees to owners of average-sized vehicles. City Towing will charge a towing fee and daily storage fee for oversized vehicles beginning on the eighth day of storage. Increasing the time City Towing must hold a vehicle in storage, from 45 days to 60 days. City Towing must tell the city’s Police Chief and Finance Director at least two weeks prior to taking a title to a vehicle when the vehicle owner fails to retrieve it. City Towing can’t take a vehicle title until the Police Chief or Finance Director confirms that City Towing has held the vehicle for the required time period under the contract. City Towing has to get prior written approval from the city to hire a subcontractor to tow vehicles beyond the towing weight capacity City Towing can handle. City Towing must provide the city with a copy of the notice City Towing sends to registered owners and lienholders of towed vehicles no later than 72 hours after the vehicle was towed. City Towing must allow a vehicle owner access to the storage lot where their vehicle is being kept at all times to get the vehicle or personal items from the vehicle at no charge to the owner. The adopted contract will expire on March 31, 2024. In May 2021, the city put out a statement claiming comments made by the Wilmington Parking Coalition were misleading and misinterpreted data. Grant was the primary organizer of the Wilmington Parking Coalition, which has not been active for two years. One claim was that the company with which the city contracted in 2020, Conduent, got a 30% cut of booting and towing revenue, which could lead to impropriety. The city responded by saying that it was unfortunate the coalition made that connection and that it was good to offer an incentive to collect unpaid fees because, at the time, they had only collected $18,335 of the $4.2 million owed to the city. Grant pointed to an August 2022 news report outlining five instances of people being charged storage fees when City Towing was contractually obligated not to. Because the names of the people involved were not listed in the article, Rago said he believes they aren’t true, “I think they just don’t have the information.” Rago said he isn’t familiar with people being improperly charged storage fees “I’ve not personally handled any storage fee issues,” Rago said. “I don’t remember the last time I got a call from anyone. I mean, I do a lot of these cases myself, or I like to get in and take a look at them, because I think it helps the city, learn what works and what’s not working. And so you can make changes that way. So I like to look at these cases. And I’ve not handled any having to do with storage.” Separately, the city was sued on Sept. 22, 2021, by Ameera Shaheed and Earl Dickerson for issues they had with their cars being towed. According to the complaint filed against Wilmington, City Towing Service and First State Towing, the towing company the city employed before City Towing, both Shaheed and Dickerson felt they were wronged by the city. Shaheed received six parking tickets between Sept. 9 and Sept. 17, 2019, while being legally parked, according to the complaint. Because those tickets totaled over $200, her car was towed and impounded. The complaint doesn’t clarify what the six parking tickets were for. Shaheed’s car, a 2005 Hyundai XG350, was ultimately scrapped because she was unable to pay the $320 necessary to release her car from First State Towing’s lot. According to the complaint, Shaheed still owes the city $580 for the parking tickets. Dickerson had his car towed on […]"
