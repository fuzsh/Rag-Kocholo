        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt produced among others the great Bhimsen Joshi, the only male vocalist to have been given the Bharat Ratna. This may also be the moment to remember that it was Bhimsen who composed that wonderful song in Raag Miya ki Malhar\n\nBy Saba Naqvi\n\nThere is sometimes a march of history and politics that erases memories of the fragile, beautiful things our civilization has given us. Kairana, a dusty little town in Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. It is allegedly the scene of what is now called the “Hindu exodus”.\n\nBJP MP from the Kairana Lok Sabha seat, Hukum Singh, recently produced a list of 346 Hindu families that he claimed have been forced to flee the town—it has an 85 percent Muslim population—because of attacks and extortion by members of the minority community.\n\nNaturally, the VHP quickly jumped in and spoke of “jehadi activities” driving Hindus out. Since Uttar Pradesh is election bound and Shamli district part of the stage for what came to be referred to as the Muzaffarnagar riots, it’s hardly surprising that the national BJP has given legitimacy to the tale of the flight of ‘terrified’ Hindus. Reporters who have gone to the ground have not been able to verify these claims, but no matter, Kairana is now a place associated in our minds with strife and lawlessness.\n\nBut it is this very Kairana whose name is attached to one of the greatest gharanas of Hindustani classical music. Phrases like Hindu-Muslim synthesis sound too clichéd to describe the expanse of human cooperation, talent and generosity that went into the evolution of a gharana such as Kairana.\n\nIt produced among others the great Bhimsen Joshi, the only male vocalist to have been given the Bharat Ratna. This may also be the moment to remember that it was Bhimsen who composed that wonderful song in Raag Miya ki Malhar—one of the important ragas to be produced by the Kairana gharana—Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, sung by musicians from across the country and across genres. It was meant to celebrate our unity in diversity.\n\nBut let’s flashback a little earlier to the story of Ustad Abdul Karim Khan, born in Kairana, who is widely acknowledged to be one of the artists who defined Hindustani classical music (he died in 1937). His statue still stands at the entrance of the premises of All India Radio in Delhi.\n\nIt is said that when Rabindranath Tagore first heard Abdul Karim Khan perform in his sweet, almost womanly voice, he burnt his fingers on the forgotten lit cigarette as the master’s voice filled the room. Abdul Karim Khan’s life would be colourful. He was employed as a court musician by the Gaekwads of Baroda. It was there that he met Tarabai Mane, a member of the royal family, and the two fell in love. Because the family disapproved, they left the state and moved to Bombay.\n\nThey would separate in 1922, apparently the reason for the Ustad getting greater pathos in his voice in his later years. Yet there were five children of that union whose childhood names were Suresh, Krishna, Champakali, Gulab and Sakina.As adults they came to be known as Hirabai Barodekar, Kamalabai Barodekar, KrishnaRao Mane, Sureshbabu Mane and Saraswati Rane. Hirabai Barodekar needs no introduction to anyone familiar with Hindustani classical music. She would along with brother Sureshbabu Mane, also train her younger sister, whose name changed from Sakina to Sarawati after the parents’ separation. Saraswati Rane would also be an accomplished vocalist. The personal life of Abdul Karim Khan sublimates the Hindu, the Muslim, to the passion and the music. It must be understood beyond boxed in identities.\n\nHe left a musical legacy of the truly great artist that just grew over the decades as we moved into Independent India. The Kairana gharana can also be called among the most influential also because it blends the influence of south and north. It would travel to the Hubli-Dharwad belt, now in the state of Karnataka, still a nursery for musical talent. One of the most famous students of the ustad was Ramachandra Kundgolkar Saunshi, popularly known as Pandit Sawai Gandharva. He would in turn be the guru of Bhimsen Joshi and Gangubai Hangal, among others.\n\nBhimsen Joshi, born in Dharwad in 1922, heard a recording of Abdul Karim Khan singing a thumri on radio and would say that inspired him to want to pursue singing seriously. Legend has it that the young Bhimsen would go all over India in search of the perfect guru and would eventually find him in Sawai Gandharva, the great disciple of the great teacher. Bhimsen would later begin the Sawai Gandharva music festival and concert series in Pune where he settled, as homage to his guru. It is now among the most popular in India and is the venue at which budding classical singers yearn to perform.\n\nThere’s a lesser known festival in Miraj, Maharashtra, near the Karnataka border where Abdul Karim Khan is said to have halted in the middle of a train journey in 1989. Feeling unwell, he had stopped at a Sufi shrine, believed to have miraculous healing powers. On being healed, he would for the rest of his life visit the shrine, donate generously to the annual Urs festivities and would eventually move to Miraj. A few years after his death in 1937, his students began an annual concert that still takes place in the courtyard of the dargah. It’s attracted many of the big artistes, including those from the Kairana gharana, such as Bhimsen and Gangubai Hangal in the past. This year the 82 nd edition of the festival took place.\n\nWhat of Kairana, the town that’s been left behind to fester in this season of hate and politics? The many ustads and music teachers from this gharana say they wish to weep when they recognize what Kairana is associated with today. Should we at the very least recognize it is the same place that lies at the origin of such beautiful melody? Can we at least break our hearts a little when we hear the harsh grunts of hate and false testimony emerging from there? Could we possibly imagine and then plan a concert for Kairana by the singers of the Kairana gharana? KAIRANA: At a time when western UP is simmering with news of Hindus reportedly being forced to leave their villages, a mound of sand in Bhora Kalan, has become a subject of controversy. Considered a place of healing by both communities, the mound, near Budhana, is close to where most of the Muzaffarnagar riot victims are staying.\n\nThis mound is in a plain, empty farm, located amid lush sugarcane fields, just 10 km on Luhsana road where Muslims, f leeing Muzaffarnagar after 2013, are staying now. Ompal Prajapati, a 60-year-old farmer who owns the land where the mound exists, said there was a mahua tree here that people started worshipping in 2014, believing it could cure them of financial problems and ill health. Muslims come in large numbers on Friday while Hindus pray here on Mondays. At peak hours, there are at least two policemen guarding the place. The tree was chopped off after the riots when hundreds of ‘devotees’ started thronging here.\n\nFearing a potential law and order problem, the administration cut all the trees around the farm. Undeterred, people now make little mounds of sand there to worship. A ‘chamatkari ‘ baba who used to reside in the mahua tree transferred magical properties to the soil, said Sitadevi, who visited on Wednesday, seeking a cure for her husband, a labourer who has been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nDevotees take packets of soil home after prostrating in front of the mounds, believed to contain the remains of the tree. Some also apply it on their bodies. “The trunk that is left is not even of the mahua tree but of some poplar (eucalyptus) tree, but still they come here,” said Prajapati. “Lotne ki jagah ban gayi hai (they come here to roll in the mud). We are just hoping they don’t start asking for a mandir. Muslims come here in large numbers on Jumraat,” he added. Last month village elders of both communities, sat together and discussed this issue, villages said. Bhora Kalan police station incharge Digambar Singh said they are watching over the place so that untoward incidents are prevented. “We feel this was started by some people who spread rumours about some baba and made money out of devotees. We want to spread awareness about it. At the same time, we don’t want crowds to assemble here. It gets difficult to control them, and the issue of harassing women always comes up.\n\nThis place in Bhora Kalan is one of several places symbolic of the syncretic relationship between the two communities in this region but today, policemen guard this place and are actively discouraging people from coming here. The policeman that ET spoke with said complaints were filed in the last three months of eve-teasing and local fights breaking out which led the administration to post police at the spot. “We are just being careful and telling people not to crowd here. They may not want to fight but some groups from outside can come and incite riots here. Since Holi when there was an expected surge in the crowd, we have become careful. This is all andh-vishwas as there is no baba or devi here as the Muslims or Hindus claim,” he said.\n\nProfessor Sudhir Panwar, Member Planning Commission, UP said it was a common code among both communities of Uttar Pradesh to accept all religious motifs except mosques and mandirs as part of shared culture, not just out of respect but largely to get blessings in times of distress.\n\nFor instance, in Bhainswal village of Shamli, Hindus pray at sayeed ki mazaar on Deepawali and Holi. “They draw symbols of their forefathers in the fields on these days. And they do puja at the mazaar first,” Panwar said. The pyjamas sported by many Hindus in western UP and not dhotis also showed Muslim influence. “Even in Ramlila which is popular here, elements such as music and dance, curtains, comedy shows where Muslim influences are clear, have stayed on.”\n\nOn the way to Roorkee from Meerut, the Piran Kaliyar a dargah of a sufi saint near Hardwar on the banks of Ganga is equally revered by Hindus and Muslims and attended by lakhs of devotees, known as ‘jayarins’ which include Hindus in December.\n\nMJ Khan, who was originally general secretary of the Uttar Pradesh-based Peace Party feels symbols of Hindu-Muslim unity should be encouraged and terming them as “law and order” issues will lead to separation and misunderstanding between the two communities. “The relationship between Hindus and Muslims from Bareli to Banaras has always been built on a shared value system,” Khan said.\n\nIn Lucknow, on five Tuesdays of the month of ‘Jeth’, Hindus worship Hanuman. Free food, mostly puri, subzi, pulav and even ice-creams, are distributed, often by Muslims. “Deva Sharif, 25 km from Lucknow was built with the contribution of non Muslims and even today, eighty per cent of visitors were Hindus,” Khan said.\n\nIslamudin a 60-year-old farmer in Shamli said in the early days Hindus would host Muslims but would later “wash the utensils with fire by slightly roasting them. That is because we eat meat but there was no malice, it was done openly. If you ask the person his identity, he would always say he is a Jat or a Chamar, not his religion. But things have changed now. Both communities are conscious of their identities.”\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nRemember the July 19 global computer outage?
