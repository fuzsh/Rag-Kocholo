        "text": "Mathura (Uttar Pradesh), June 13 (ANI): Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday advised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to indulge in constructive works rather than indulging in petty politics on the false claims of Hindus being forced to leave their homes in the Muslim dominated town of Kairana in Shamli district for electoral gains in next year's assembly polls. \"The BJP is saying the Samajwadi Party workers are chasing away the people in Kairana. How corrupt these BJP members can be? The list provided by the BJP on Kairana must be scrutinized. Many fled years ago when the Samajwadi Party wasn't even in power,\" Akhilesh told the media here. \"Since the elections are near and they don't have any issue to raise they are trying to downplay the development work done by us with such false assertions,\" he added. The Chief Minister advised the BJP to indulge in some constructive work rather than raking up this issue unnecessary for electoral gains. \"I want them to work and say we distributed laptops to the people and not just talk about 'Digital India',\" he said. BJP legislator and Muzaffarnagar riots accused Hukum Singh had earlier reportedly said that the Hindus were being forced to leave their homes in the Muslim-majority town in Uttar Pradesh. According to reports, the police have ordered a probe into the alleged migration after Singh presented a list of 346 families from the Muslim-majority town while claiming that they had to leave their homes after attacks and extortion attempts.
