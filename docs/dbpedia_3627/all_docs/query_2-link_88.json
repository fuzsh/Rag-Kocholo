        "text": "The Social media went abuzz recently, owing to the controversy regarding the exodus of people from Kairana in Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh. Politicians cited religious persecution as the reason for the exodus of people from the village despite the fact that exodus includes many of the Muslim families also. Ä BJP MP had blamed Muslims for the reason of the exodus, however, investigation and the turn of events have led him ruling out the communal aspect of the issue. The BJP MP later said, “calling it Hindu exodus a mistake by my team”.\n\nLet us take a look at the timeline of the event:\n\nAllegations made by Hukum Singh a week ago\n\nBJP MP Hukum Singh alleged last week that a large no. of Hindus are moving out of Kairana, as Muslims gangs are posing threats to Hindu families with support from the Samajwadi Party.\n\nWith his statement, the BJP MP also released a list of 346 people who have been forced to migrate from Kairana.\n\nHukum Singh alleged that a gang leader called Mukhim Kala was extorting the Hindus, which made them to migrate.\n\nHowever, after Kala was arrested in October last year, it was found that he had 14 murder charges against him — three Hindus and 11 Muslims.\n\nRepurcations\n\nThe statement resulted into the rise of political temperature in the Shamli district in western UP which heads for an assembly election next year. The BJP president Amit Shah also brought up the Kairana issue at a public rally in Allahabad on Monday.\n\nOwing to such controversial statements, the UP administration has conducted door-to-door survey in the last few days, in which after looking for 119 people on the list, they found four were dead, 68 people left Kairana a decade ago and 35 of them left the place five years ago in search of better livelihood.\n\nThe BJP list did not mention that 115 Muslim families also migrated from the town.\n\nShamli district magistrate Sujeet Kumar reported that most of the people have migrated in search of jobs as the area lacks any industrial progress.\n\nSome of the Hindu families in the area met Times of India reporters and said that the list made by Hukum Singh was “off the mark and had exaggerated facts”. Many of the families have claimed that their names have been wrongly placed on the list. They clarified that the families that have migrated from Kairana went looking for better opportunities, not for communal violence.\n\nTaking a dig at the BJP, the Samajwadi party chief minister of UP, Akhilesh Yadav said that BJP leaders are “dishonest”and are “lying”. He told reporters, “The BJP is alleging that the Samajwadi Party Government forced the people flee from Kairana… BJP can be dishonest to this extent.”"
