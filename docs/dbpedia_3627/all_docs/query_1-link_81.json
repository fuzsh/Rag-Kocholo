        "text": "Author of this article is Laxman Burdak लक्ष्मण बुरड़क\n\nJat Belt is the area of continuous Distribution of Jat population. This comes in discussions frequently during elections in India. The support of these areas is very crucial for the political parties in winning elections. The States in India with significant Jat population are: Rajasthan, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh. The other States with lesser number of population of the Jats are: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra.\n\nThere is an estimate of about 33 million population of Jats. Main concentration of the Jats is in North Western India. Other than India they are found in Pakistan, Balochistan, NWFP etc.\n\nDistribution of Jat population\n\nHukum Singh Panwar (Pauria) [1] writes that adequate statistics are available in the Census Report of India, 1931, which is the last and the most comprehensive source of information on the Jats, who were estimated to be approximately one crore in number at that time[2] . They are believed to be distributed in about a thousand cans or gotras, while their clans virtually exceed three thousand[3]. Nearly six million Jats lived in the pre-partitioned Panjab (which included Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and the present Panjabs of the India and Pakistan), nearly one million in Rajasthan about 8,00,000 in the Uttar Pradesh while large groups of them resided in Jammu and Kashmir the Western Frontier Province, Baluchistan and Sindh[4]. Their number in Kirman and Iraq was about 20,000, in Makran and Afghanistan about 50,000[5]. They are also found in the Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujrat-Kutch, but not in very large.\n\nThe census in 1931 in India recorded population on the basis of ethnicity. In 1925, according to Professor Qanungo[6] the population of Jatts was around nine million in South Asia and was made up of followers of three major religions as shown below.\n\nReligion Jat Population % Hinduism 47% Sikhism 20% Islam 33%\n\nProfessor B.S. Dhillon, states by taking population statistical analysis into consideration the Jatt population growth of both India and Pakistan since 1925, Professor Quanungo's figure of nine million could be translated into a minimum population statistic (1988) of 30 million.[7]\n\nAccording to earlier censuses, the Jatt or Jat people accounted for approximately 25% of the entire Sindhi-Punjabi speaking area, making it the one of \"largest single socially distinctive group\" in the region.[8]\n\nHukum Singh Pawar (Pauria) states, adequate statistics about Jat people population are available in the Census Report of India of 1931, which is the last and the most comprehensive source of information on the Jat people, who were estimated to be approximately ten million in number at that time.[9] From 1931 to 1988 the estimated increase in the Jat people population of the Indian subcontinent including Pakistan respectively is 3.5% Hindu, 3.5% Sikh and 4.0% Muslim.[10] Dr Sukhbir Singh estimates that the population of Hindu Jatts, numbered at 2,210,945 in the 1931 census, rose to about 7,738,308 by 1988, whereas Muslim Jatts, numbered at 3,287,875 in 1931, would have risen to about 13,151,500 in 1988. The total population of Jatts was given as 8,406,375 in 1931, and estimated to have been about 31,066,253 in 1988.\n\nThe region-wise break-up of the total Jat people population, (including the Hindu Jats, Sikh Jats and Muslim Jat Gotras), is given in the following table. The Jat people, approximately 73%, are located mainly in the Punjab region:[11]\n\nName of region Jat Population 1931 Jat Population 1988 Approx\n\nPercentage Punjab region 6,068,302 22,709,755 73 % Rajasthan 1,043,153 3,651,036 12 % Uttar Pradesh 810,114 2,845,244 9.2 % Jammu & Kashmir 148,993 581,477 2 % Balochistan 93,726 369,365 1.2 % NWFP 76,327 302,700 1 % Bombay Presidency 54,362 216,139 0.7 % Delhi 53,271 187,072 0.6 % CP & Brar 28,135 98,473 0.3 % Ajmer-Marwar 29,992 104,972 0.3 % Total 8,406,375 31,066,253 100 %\n\nAccording to Hawa Singh Sangwan[12] the state-wise estimated Jat population is as under:\n\nS.No. Name of State Jat Population (Lakh) 1. Rajasthan 100.00 2. Punjab 72.00 3. Uttar Pradesh 68.00 4. Haryana 64.00 5. Delhi 12.00 6. Madhya Pradesh 7.50 7. Gujarat 6.50 8. Jammu and Kashmir 5.50 9. Uttaranchal 2.30 10. Himachal Pradesh 1.30 11. Bihar 0.80 11. Andhra Pradesh 0.40 11. Maharashtra 0.30 Total 340.60\n\nDistribution of Jat population in India\n\nRam Sarup Joon[13] writes that ....In the present era, people called Jats live in Northern India all around Delhi. The entire land in this area is owned by Jats. A minority of tradesmen and the so-called low or scheduled castes who live along with the Jats are landless. Brahmins possess has been obtained, at sortie time or the other, in charity and that owned by businessmen has been mortgaged by some Jats to clear their debts. It is difficult to find, anywhere in the world, a more homogeneous and closely-knit settlement than that of the Jats. Jat gotras are found mixed up amongst other communities in India like Rajput, Gujar and Ahirs but there is no adulteration amongst the Jats.\n\nHistory of the Jats, End of Page-3\n\nThese Jats, however, are only a small representative group, of a once great and vastly populated race, who have retained their original name. The only other members of this race who are partially retaining the title of Jat are Jat Sikhs or Jut Sikhs, as they are called in Punjab. Some of these have even put forward the views that they are called as such not because they are originally Jats but because Jut means an agriculturist. Unless Jats regain their past glory, so that it becomes a matter of pride to be called a Jat, these Jat Sikhs may also, with the passage of time, stop calling themselves Jats, as has already been done by other communities comprising a major part of this race.\n\nJat is in fact only another name of Chandravanshi branch of Aryans which, at one time, extended in the entire area from Northern India to Central Asia and Central Europe. At different times, and in the ancient histories of various countries they have been known by one of the derivatives of word Jat like Yayat, Yat, Yet, Yeti, Yates, Yuchi Jat, Jati, Jutes, Juton, Gat, Gatae, Gatak, Goth etc or by the name of their major sub castes like Shavi, Takshak, Madrak etc.\n\nThe word Jat may not be, but these names would be familiar to the student of modern history. In India most of the population of North Western part: of the country, including the area astride River Sindh in West, the Gangetic planes in the East and down to Prayag, Bundel Khand in the South is of Jat origin. This area contains Punjab, part of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Brij and Mewat. Jats have thus lived, from times immemorial, on the most fertile part of India. They did not find it necessary to spread in to the less fertile hilly tracts to the North, the waste lands of Central India or the deserts in Southern and\n\nHistory of the Jats, End of Page-4\n\nWestern parts of Rajasthan. The density of the population of Jats, therefore, becomes thinner as one goes further East or South from Delhi. The reason for this homogeneous settlement on the most productive part of India is that 95 percent Jats are of the Yayati Vansh, which inhabited North Western India from the earliest times and have never been dislodged from it inspite of loss of power.\n\nStates with significant Jat density\n\nRajasthan\n\nJat population 1931 :\n\nThakur Deshraj has given an analysis of Jat population in Rajasthan as on 1931. Rajasthan was called Rajputana prior to independence. As per 1931 census the population of Jats in Rajasthan was as under:\n\nRajputana…………….1042152\n\nAjmer-Merwara………….30000\n\nBisnoi Jats………………69873\n\nTotal Jat population…. 1142025\n\nThe population of jats in then princely states where they were in sizable proportion was as under:\n\nBharatpur state…………72378\n\nBikaner state………….215947\n\nJaipur state……………313609\n\nMarwar sate…………..283933\n\nBisnoi jats mainly inhabited the areas of Bikaner, Jaipur, Bharatpur, Marwar, Kishangarh and Mewar and their combined population was 69873.\n\nThe Jats in Bikaner, Jaipur and Jodhpur States were always a formidable factor. The Jat community was the most numerous and largest single community in the Princely States of Bikaner, Jaipur and Jodhpur.\n\nA glance at the ‘Census Report of Marwar (Jodhpur State) for 1941’ [14], would make one aware of the size of the Jat community in the State. The total population of the State was 25,55,904 out of which 3,54,342 or approximately 14% were Jats. In the Jat belt extending from Malani paragana (present Barmer District bordering Sindh province), Jodhpur paragana (Jodhpur district) Merta, Nagaur, Didwana and Parabatsar paraganas (present Nagaur district) the Jats formed nearly 30% of the total population, not an insignificant proportion by any standard. Their capacity to create trouble in the State can, therefore, be easily visualized.\n\nHighest Jat density areas in Rajasthan:\n\nThakur Deshraj has mentioned that the maximum density of Jats was in following tehsils in each princely state as under:\n\nBharatpur state – Dyodi, Deeg, Kumher and Nadwai\n\nBikaner state – All tehsils\n\nJaipur state – Malpura, Sambhar, Shekhawati, Torawati, Khetri and Sikar\n\nKishangarh state – Arai, Kishangarh, Rupnagar and Sarwar\n\nMarwar state – Bilada, Didwana, Jodhpur, Barmer, Merta, Nagaur, Parbatsar and Sambhar\n\nMewar state – Bhilwara, Kapasan and Rashmi\n\nHaryana\n\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab State of India and Punjab province of Pakistan were included in the Punjab region in 1931. Hence its Jat population in not known separately as on 1931.\n\nDelhi\n\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab State of India and Punjab province of Pakistan were included in the Punjab region in 1931. Hence its Jat population in not known separately as on 1931.\n\nPunjab\n\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab State of India and Punjab province of Pakistan were included in the Punjab region in 1931. Hence its Jat population in not known separately as on 1931.\n\nUttar Pradesh\n\nThe exact Jat population in Uttar Pradesh at present is not available as there is no caste wise census after 1931 in India. We can take 1931 Jat population as an indication of the proportion of it to the other castes. It can also be extrapolated on the ration of 2001 census and 1931 census, which can give approximate Jat population.\n\nThe total population of India in 1931 was 27.09 crore and in 2001 was 102.7 crore. Thus there is an increase of 3.681 times. On this basis the present Jat population in Uttar Pradesh must be 3.681 times 759830 = 2796900. Thus we can say population of Hindu Jats in Uttar Pradesh is 2796900.\n\nThakur Deshraj has given an analysis of Jat population in Uttar Pradesh as on 1931. Uttar Pradesh was called United Province prior to independence. As per 1931 census the population of Jats in Uttar Pradesh was as under:\n\nRegion wise Districts, tahsils and Jat population in Uttar Pradesh\n\nName of Region District Tahsils in district Percentage of Jats in district out of total Jat population in state (1931) Upper Doab 1.Muzaffarnagar Budhana, Jansath, Kairana, Muzaffarnagar, Shamli 09.94 % 3.Meerut Mawana, Meerut, Sardhana 26.26 % 4.Baghpat Baghpat, Baraut, Khekada 5.Ghaziabad Garhmukteshwar, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Modinagar 6.Bulandshahar Anupshahr, Bulandshahr, Debai, Khurja, Shikarpur, Siana, Sikandrabad 10.84 % 67.Saharanpur Behat, Deoband, Nakur, Saharanpur 01.43 % Middle Doab 10.Aligarh Atrauli, Gabhana, Iglas, Khair, Koil 12.22 % 14.Mathura Chhata, Mat, Mathura 16.36 % 15.Hathras Hathras, Sadabad, Sasni, Sikandra Rao 16.Etah Aliganj, Etah, Jalesar, Kasganj, Patiyali 00.03 % 19.Agra Agra, Bah, Etmadpur, Fatehabad, Kheragarh, Kiraoli 07.03 % 20.Firozabad Firozabad, Jasrana, Shikohabad, Tundla Rohil Khand 2.Bijnor Bijnor, Chandpur, Dhampur, Nagina, Najibabad 06.95 % 7.Jyotiba Phule Nagar Amroha, Dhanaura, Hasanpur 8.Moradabad Bilari, Chandausi, Moradabad, Sambhal, Thakurdwara 03.97 % 9.Rampur Bilaspur, Milak, Rampur, Shahabad, Suar 11.Budaun Bilsi, Bisauli, Budaun, Dataganj, Gunnaur, Sahaswan 00.53 % 12.Bareilly Aonla, Baheri, Bareilly, Faridpur, Meerganj, Nawabganj 00.80 % 13.Pilibhit Bisalpur, Pilibhit, Puranpur 00.08 % 17.Shahjahanpur 00.02 % Lower Doab 21.Mainpuri 22.Farrukhabad 00.02 % 26.Etawah 00.10 % 27.Kannauj 28.Auraiya 29.Kanpur Dehat 00.08 % 30.Kanpur Nagar 40.

The rest 24 districts like Dehradun, Farrukhabad, Itawa, Kanpur, Fatehpur, Allahabad, Varanasi, Mirjapur, Gazipur, Balia, Gorakhpur, Basti, Azamgarh, Mainpuri, Etah, Shahjahanpur,Pilibhit, Jhansi, Jalon, Hamirpur, Banda, Nainital, Almoda, Garhwal had a combines Hindu Jat population of 27847 (3.66 %).\n\nIn addition to this there are about 2.63 % Muslim Jats.\n\nStates with lesser population of Jats\n\nJammu & Kashmir\n\nHimachal Pradesh\n\nHaryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab State of India and Punjab province of Pakistan were included in the Punjab region in 1931. Hence its Jat population in not known separately as on 1931.\n\nAccording to some estimates ate present there are about 95,000 Jats in Himachal Pradesh, they are mainly Hindu Jats. They are about 1%(approx) of the total population of the state.\n\nUttarakhand\n\nMadhya Pradesh\n\nThe population of Jats in Madhya Pradesh at present is not so significant to affect its policies but it has a sizable population in certain areas. The present Jats found in Madhya Pradesh trace their ancestors to have come from out side.\n\nJats migrated from Rajasthan: The Narmada River attracted them and they settled in Narsinghpur, Hoshangabad, Harda, Dewas, Indore and Dhar districts situated on the banks of Narmada.\n\nJats migrated from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab:They settled in Bhind, Bhopal, Morena, Hoshangabad, Sagar, and Narsinghpur.\n\nDistrict wise distribution : Jats are found in districts:- Bhopal, Dewas, Dhar, Harda, Hoshangabad, Indore, Jabalpur, Khargone, Narsinghpur, Raisen, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Sehore, Shajapur, Tikamgarh, Ujjain, Vidisha.\n\nGujarat\n\nGujarat state has a sizable Hindu Jat population. The Jats came from a place in Iran called Half (to be known latter as Jat) and they were herders by occupation. Around five hundred years ago they came to Kutch and Sind in search of new grazing pastures and settled there. Those who joined agriculture called themselves Garasia Jats and those who continued their ancestral occupation were known as Dhanetah Jats, and those who chose to study the Koran became Fakirani Jats. [15] Kachchha-desa in Gujarat is also known Jartra–desa, the modern Kutch.[16]\n\nThe Jats of Kutch are a cattle breeding nomadic Muslim community. They are one of a number of communities of Maldhari pastoral nomads found in the Banni Grasslands Reserve region of Kutch.[17]\n\nThe Jat, or Jath in Kutch claim descent from Hindu Jats of the Indus delta region of Sindh, in Pakistan, where a good members of the tribe still reside. Those who remain in Sindh are referred to as the Sindhi Jats. From there, they moved into the Bani region in search of pastorage. With the partition of India, the Jats of Kutch have lost all contact with their kinsmen in Sindh. They appear to be distinct from the Jat community of North India and Pakistan.[18]\n\nThe Gujarati Muslim Jats are a Maldhari cattle hearding group, and are mainly distributed in Kutch and Saurashtra region. They have three territorial divisions, the 1. Halai Jat (found in Jamnagar and Porbandar), 2. Verai Jat (Banaskantha District), and 3. Kutchi Jat (found in Kutch District).\n\nThe Kutchi are further subdivided into the Dhanetah, Girasia and Fakirani, the latter consider themselves superior to the other two, and are strictly endogenous. They are further divided into clans like the Badajang, Podani, Aamar, Vangayi, while the Girasia are divided into the Mudrag, Bhallad and Hallayi. All these clans, except the Fakirani, enjoy equal status. The Saurashtra Jat, known as Malaks, maintain a system of Gotra exogamy.[19]\n\nIn addition to cattle rearing, the community are also involved in the breeding of camels, especially the Fakirani. A good many of the Saurashtra community are small scale peasant farmers. A few are landless, and work in as agricultural labourers. The Kutch Jat are also known for their embroidery work.\n\nThe Jats in Gujarat have come from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Patels and Chaudharys of Gujarat consider themselves to be Jats of Gujarat. They are settled mainly in Mehsana district and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Jats of Gujarat have many similarities with those of Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. Signifant Jat population is in Banaskantha district, Ahmedabad. They are settled mainly in Mehsana district and surrounding areas. A few villages in Gujarat were jats live are Sherpura, Laxmipura, Yavarpura etc.\n\nMaharashtra\n\nMaharashtra is the state which is not normally regarded as having any Jat population. It is not true. The Jats had gone to some parts of Maharastra about 4 – 5 generations back. They are settled in the interior areas and doing cultivation. They came from states like Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana etc. Jats are dwelling in Nasik, Jalgaon, Dhuliya, Aurangabad, Amravati districts. The Jat villages in these areas are called ‘Bavisi’. The villages in Jat ‘Bavisi’ are:\n\nNasik – Tokada, Jalkoo, Rajmana, Palarde, Hatane, Saytarpara, Jatpara (Nimbayatpada), Bhutpara, Dapaura, Chinchagyaha, Nardana, Palasdara, Lakhane\n\nJalgaon – Pinjarpara (Ramnagar), Rajoon, Manur, Talonda\n\nDhuliya – Kulthe\n\nAurangabad – Pardi, Anjangaon, Jalna, Lodhebari, Bamnod\n\nTokra (tehsil – Malegaon) in Nasik district is the main village of Jat Bavisi. This village is famous for cooperative societies in dairy. National leaders like Dara Singh, Dharmendra, Ram Niwas Mirdha etc have visited Tokra village.\n\nJats live in other districts of Maharashtra also. There is one taluka named Jat in Sangli district situated in south Maharashtra.

Many historians and academics have asserted that the Jats are descendants of Aryans, Scythians, or other ancient people that arrived and lived in northern India at one time. Essentially, the specific origin of these people has remained a matter of contention for a long time.\n\nThis study demonstrated that the Origins of Jats can be clarified by identifying their Y-chromosome haplogroups and tracing their genetic markers on the Y-DNA haplogroup tree. A sample of 302 Y-chromosome haplotypes of Jats in India and Pakistan was analyzed. The results showed that the sample population had several different lines of ancestry and emerged from at least nine different geographical regions of the world. It also became evident that the Jats did not have a unique set of genes, but shared an underlying genetic unity with several other ethnic communities in the Indian subcontinent. A startling new assessment of the genetic ancient origins of these people was revealed with DNA science.\n\nDetails of this study can be seen here."
