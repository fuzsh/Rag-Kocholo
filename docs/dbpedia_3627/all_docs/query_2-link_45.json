She pointed out the need for a train line that connects Haryana and Western UP, which would greatly benefit the region.\n\n“Our district is a new district, formed 10 years ago from Muzaffarnagar. We lack many essential facilities, especially local transportation like trains. A line connecting Haryana and Western UP has been a long-standing demand,” Hasan said.\n\nShe also mentioned the absence of train services to Prayagraj, where the High Court is located, and to Vaishno Devi, a popular pilgrimage site. “We have many devotees who face problems due to the lack of train services. We are working to address these issues,” she added.\n\nIn her maiden speech in the Lok Sabha, Hasan emphasized the need for rail connectivity between Shamli, Prayagraj, and Vaishno Devi. She won the Kairana seat against BJP’s Pradeep Kumar with a margin of 69,116 votes. The Samajwadi Party emerged as the single largest party in the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha polls, winning 37 seats. SP Chief Akhilesh Yadav and leader Dimple Yadav also won their respective seats with large margins. The BJP secured 33 seats, losing several key constituencies.\n\nDoubts Revealed"
