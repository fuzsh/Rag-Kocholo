        "text": "A probe team of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has found that many families “migrated” from Kairana in Uttar Pradesh due to threats pertaining to “increase in crime” and “deterioration” of law-and-order situation there.\n\nBased on its findings, the Commission has sent a notice to the chief secretary and director general of police of the state to submit an action taken report, on the observations and recommendations of the team within eight weeks.\n\nThe team also examined relevant witnesses, victims, independent witnesses, police officials concerned and SDM. Copies of relevant records were also obtained and analysed.\n\n“The team also obtained list of 346 displaced families or persons from PS to the MP, Kairana. Out of that list three residential localities were selected and at random at least six alleged victims or displaced families or persons were chosen for verification.\n\n“The team also had telephonic verification from at least four displaced families mentioned in the list who had migrated to distant places such as Dehradun and Surat from Kairana town in Shamli district,” the NHRC said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nRead: No exodus but fear in Kairana, says fact-finding team of saints\n\n“Most of the witnesses stated that many families migrated due to threats pertaining to increase in crime and deterioration of law-and-order situation,” the Commission says, quoting the team’s findings.\n\nHowever, in June, a probe conducted by the Shamli district administration into the alleged migration from Kairana had found that in the list of 346 families, 188 had left over five years ago. The inquiry had then found that only in three cases the families had faced ‘rangdari’ threats and police took timely action.\n\nA home department spokesman had said that on verification of the list provided by BJP MP Hukum Singh, it was found that 66 families had left Kairana 10 years ago.\n\nThe NHRC probe team has also found that in 2013, after resettlement of about 25,000-30,000 members of Muslims community in Kairana town from Muzaffarnagar, the demography of Kairana town changed in favour of the Muslim community”, it becoming the “more dominating and majority community”.\n\n“Most of the witnesses examined and victims feel that the rehabilitation in 2013 has permanently changed the social situation in Kairana town and has led to further deterioration of law-and-order situation,” says the team’s findings.\n\nRead: Marriages in a knot: Would-be brides dumping Kairana men over safety\n\nA Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson said, “We are yet to receive the NHRC notice. And, we will respond to it only after receiving it.”\n\nAt least 24 witnesses said the youths of a “specific majority community” in Kairana “pass lewd/taunting remarks” against the females of a “specific minority community” as per the NHRC findings. Due to this, females of the specific minority community in Kairana avoided going outside frequently.\n\n“Some of the displaced persons also verified that it was one of the reasons for their migration from Kairana town,” the NHRC said quoting the team’s findings."
