        "text": "Muzaffarnagar: Prohibitory orders have been enforced across Shamli district and the borders of Kairana have been sealed even as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) Sangeet Som suspended his march to the town on Friday and gave a 15-day ultimatum to the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government to bring back those who allegedly migrated from Kairana.\n\nSom had started his rally to Kairana from his house in Sardhana with thousands of followers but was stopped at the border of the town, Meerut district collector Pankaj Yadav said.\n\nA rally by the Samawadi Party, led by party leader Atul Pradhan, was also stopped some distance from Sardhana town limits, he said.\n\n“As a precautionary measure police and PAC have been stationed in heavy numbers. Section 144 is in force. No one will be allowed to break the law in this situation,” Yadav said.\n\nShamli district magistrate Sujit Kumar told PTI that prohibitory orders have been enforced across Shamli district, including Kairana town, and any march or yatra with political leaders would not be allowed without permission.\n\nAll entrances to Kairana have been sealed with the deployment of paramilitary forces and security officials.\n\nSom said he postponed his ‘Nirbhay’ rally after prohibitory orders were enforced. “We’ve given a 15-day ultimatum. Either the government gets back the people who’ve migrated or we’ll have to take to the streets,” he said. “If in 15 days they do not return we’re warning that no one will be able to stop BJP workers from going to Kairana or to any other place,” he said.\n\n“We’ll follow the law. The senior authorities gave us notice that section 144 of the CrPC (code of criminal procedure) was imposed so we’ve postponed the rally,” Som said. “UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya called up and said that wherever the authorities stop you, you have to abide by the law,” Som said while appealing to people to follow the law.\n\nPradhan said Som is an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and it was to counter his “malicious” efforts that he attempted to hold the Sadbhavna rally.\n\nBJP Member of Parliament (MP) Hukum Singh had earlier released a list of 346 families who had allegedly been forced to flee the town, which has an 85% Muslim population.\n\nKairana is in the Shamli district, which witnessed communal riots in 2013.\n\nThe BJP MP later made a contradictory statement, saying the “migration” of Hindus from Kairana was “not communal” in nature but had more to do with the poor law and order situation even as he claimed the number of families that have to flee can go up to 400-500.\n\nA delegation of leaders of five parties that visited the town yesterday hit out at the BJP for giving a “communal” angle to the event as the saffron party took a swipe at Janata Dal (United) (JD(U)) and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). However, JD(U) MP and spokesperson K. C. Tyagi, who along with D. Raja of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and Mohammad Salim of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M), D P Tripathi of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the RJD’s Manoj Jha went to the western Uttar Pradesh town and found that the area has poor law and order services, forcing many families to leave over the years.\n\n“BJP has given it a communal colour for political reasons. It is condemnable. Thanks to media probe it was forced to backtrack. Poor law and order is a problem there, as is the case in many parts of Uttar Pradesh,” he said.\n\nBJP national secretary Shrikant Sharma, however, insisted that the party had called it a law and order problem from day one and had not linked the migration to religion."
