One such important city is Kairana. A municipal board has been set up to look after its administration. Kairana has been located in the district of Muzaffarnagar of the same state of India.\n\nThe geographical location of Kairana is quite significant. It is situated approximately at 29.4Â° N 77.2Â° E. It has an average height of 242 metres or 793 feet.\n\nIn order to study any place it becomes imperative for any one to know about its demography quite well. There are several demographers who have worked out day and night in order to throw some light on the demography of Kairana. Regarding this, the Census report that has been brought out in the year 2001 is quite important. As per the report, the total population of Kairana has been measured to be 73,046. Out of the total population, males constitute of 53 percent. The population of female in Kairana is less and it has been counted to be 47 percent of the total population. In Kairana town, 22 percent of the total population is below six years of age.\n\nAlso from this report, one can even get to know about the literacy rate of Kairana. It is to be noted that in Kairana the average literacy rate is 29 percent. Thus it is even lower than that of the whole nation, which has been measured to be 59.5 percent. If one considers the status of literacy of males and females it is to be found that the rate of male literacy is 36 percent. 22, is the percentage of female literacy.\n\nIt is the opinion of the experts that the Kairana town is quite beautiful and magnificent place. The place is also well connected by rails and airport. Closest railway station is the Shamli Railway Station. Indira Gandhi International Airport also lies in close proximity. That the entire district has got sound growth of industries is apparent from the fact that mills of various industrial goods like paper, sugar, steel rolling etc have developed here over the years. Being an integral of Muzaffarnagar district, it becomes obvious that the Kairana town too is going to follow the same trend and tradition of it."
