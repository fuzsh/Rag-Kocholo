However, the town was not always synonymous with being the \"black patch of western UP\". Residents say they long to go back to the townâs âgolden ageâ, a time when the area was known for its flourishing trade and musical gharanas that trained the likes of Mohammad Rafi, Prabha Atre, and Bhimsen Joshi.\n\nKairana is home to the Kirana gharana, an Indian classical 'Khyal' gharana, rooted in the guru-shishya tradition. The gharana was founded by the revered Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan.\n\n(BJPâs Mriganka Singh, daughter of former MP Hukum Singh, says this election is a \"do-or-die\" situation for the people of Kairana)\n\nâWhen Ustad Wahid sahab was in Kairana, the place used to reverberate with alaap, sarangi, and tabla. His instruments, now broken, along with old pictures are still kept inside a locked storeroom here,â said Ishrat Ali, wife of Mohammad Shakil, kin of Ustad Wahid. He is one of the last members of his family to take the legacy of music forward. His family still stays in their ancestral home.\n\nIn Delhi, Samiulla Khan, also the kin of Ustad Wahid, recalled his days in Kairana. Samiulla works in a music school and visits the town often.\n\n(Ustad Wahid's instruments, now broken, along with old pictures are still kept inside a locked storeroom in their ancestral home)\n\nâUnfortunately, the town doesnât have a single school of music despite its bright past. Today's Kairana is highly divorced from the days of yore. People have lost interest in music,â he said.\n\nPerhaps the founders of this gharana had foreseen what lay in store for this small town, situated on the banks of the Yamuna river, that they eventually moved to Karnataka.\n\n(Ustad Wahid's family inside their ancestral home in Kairana)\n\nâDuring the Mughal era, the town was famous for its sweet sugarcane due to its fertile land. Kings thought this was because the land was situated between the Ganga and Yamuna rivers. Trade flourished since it was directly connected to Haryana,â said Mohd Shibu, a resident of the town.\n\nSince then, a lot has changed.\n\nâItâs like the music has been muted, the rich culture lost,â said Satish Pradhan, a resident of the town.\n\n(Ikra Hasan, sister of current MLA from the Kairana assembly seat Nahid Hasan, is campaigning for the latter as he is in jail)\n\nIn 2016, Kairana was propelled into the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Former BJP MP Hukum Singh published a list of 350 families and claimed their exodus because of crime. Later, an NHRC report said the claims were true. However, some Hindu families in the town told reporters the claims were false. This triggered a political dust storm that remains unsettled to date. Reports of dreaded gangsters dealing in drugs were also brought to the fore. The area also became known for long-standing political feuds. Parties have therefore been using the name of the town as an election pitch to take jibes at one another.\n\nKairana is again reverberating, but not with mellifluous ragas but venom-filled political statements. The daughters of the two powerful political clans, the Singhs and the Hasans, are at loggerheads with each other yet again.\n\n(Samiulla Khan, also the kin of Ustad Wahid, is taking his family's legacy of music forward)\n\nThe fight is between Ikra Hasan, sister of current MLA from the assembly seat Nahid Hasan and BJPâs Mriganka Singh, daughter of Hukum Singh. Nahid is in jail for several criminal cases against him.\n\nâThey say Nahid bhai is a gangster. You know what he has done for you. They know how to divide and rule. We cannot let them win,â Ikra said to a crowd of voters on the bylanes of the town, surrounded by a broken highway, poor sanitation in both the city and outskirts, and heavily encroached markets.\n\nMriganka, who has lost two elections against the Hasan clan, told her supporters that the election was âdo or die.â\n\nâIf we lose again, they (Muslims) will take over. This time, the situation is very serious,â she proclaimed in front of a crowd of voters.\n\nAmong the 3.18 lakh voters in Kairana, 1.37 lakh are Muslims. Over 27,000 Gujjars live in the town as well, followed by 25,000 Jaats and 10,000 Dalits.\n\nNeeraj Jain, 44, who is a fifth-generation resident of the town told TOI that he feels that the town has become âwhat it never was.â\n\nâMuslims have always been over 80% of the population in Kairana. My childhood was happy and safe. Yes, things went wrong over the past decade. I feel sad that the place I was born and brought up in is becoming notorious. Still, the Kairana being projected by leaders in political rallies is not the real one. I long for the old days,â he said.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\n8 plants that can be grown inside a bathroom\n\nLifestyle\n\n8 ideal walking exercises that also help with quick weight loss\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 must-try vegetarian Mexican dishes\n\nFood\n\n10 must-try Punjabi sweets\n\nFood\n\nPowerful phrases to calm an angry child\n\nLifestyle\n\n8 Curd recipes from different parts of India that deserve a try\n\nFood\n\nIn pics: Indiaâs 8 top national parks and their popular âBig Catsâ\n\ntravel\n\nâ10 animals with remarkable abilitiesâ\n\nLifestyle\n\n10 herbs and plants that will keep mosquitos away from your home naturally\n\nLifestyle\n\n9 most beautiful island nations in the world\n\ntravel"
