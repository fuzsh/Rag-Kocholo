        "text": "WASHINGTON — A key al-Qaida operative whom the CIA returned to Pakistan after he gave the U.S. information that eventually led to the location of Osama bin Laden has since rejoined al-Qaida, U.S. officials say.\n\nThe agency sent Hassan Ghul back to Pakistan not long after closing its remaining secret prisons in eastern Europe in 2006.\n\nThe CIA had been given assurances that Ghul, a native of Pakistan, would not go free. But Pakistan failed to keep its word. Ghul was let go and later rejoined al-Qaida, angering the CIA officers who worked so hard to take him off the battlefield, according to former and current U.S. intelligence officials.\n\nPakistan’s decision to free Ghul is another troubling revelation at a time when the U.S. is rethinking whether Pakistan can be a trusted ally in fighting terrorism.\n\nGhul’s return to Pakistan also raises questions about how the Bush administration could hand over the man who provided the key information about bin Laden’s trusted courier.\n\nCIA officers thought that Ghul should have been moved to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nFormer CIA officials say that Ghul was part of a clandestine network of moneymen and couriers. He was well-known to the CIA before the 9/11 attack. But after 9/11, Pakistan’s spy service, the ISI, refused to pick him up.\n\nThe CIA, working with Iraqi Kurds, nabbed Ghul in northern Iraq in January 2004, former CIA officials said. Pakistan was furious when it found out and pressed the U.S. to return him.\n\nGhul was taken to a CIA secret prison in eastern Europe, where he provided crucial information about bin Laden’s most-trusted courier. Ghul’s information later allowed the CIA to realize that finding the courier probably would lead to bin Laden.\n\nWhen the CIA closed its secret prisons, Pakistan offered to take Ghul and pledged not to release him.\n\nIt’s not clear why Pakistan wanted Ghul back so badly, but former CIA officers said that he had ties to the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group, which had the backing of ISI."
