        "text": "The following is a list of persons believed to be in U.S. custody as \"ghost detainees\" -- detainees who are not given any legal rights or access to counsel, and who are likely not reported to or seen by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The list is compiled from media reports, public statements by government officials, and from other information obtained by Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch does not consider this list to be complete: there are likely other \"ghost detainees\" held by the United States.\n\nUnder international law, enforced disappearances occur when persons are deprived of their liberty, and the detaining authority refuses to disclose their fate or whereabouts, or refuses to acknowledge their detention, which places the detainees outside the protection of the law. International treaties ratified by the United States prohibit incommunicado detention of persons in secret locations.\n\nMany of the detainees listed below are suspected of involvement in serious crimes, including the September 11, 2001 attacks; the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania; and the 2002 bombing at two nightclubs in Bali, Indonesia. (One of the listed, No. 25, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, was indicted in U.S. federal court for his role in the 1998 attacks.) Yet none on this list has been arraigned or criminally charged, and government officials, speaking anonymously to journalists, have suggested that some detainees have been tortured or seriously mistreated in custody.\n\nThe current location of these prisoners is unknown.\n\nList, as of December 1, 2005:\n\n1. Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi\n\nReportedly arrested on November 11, 2001, Pakistan.\n\nLibyan, suspected commander at al-Qaeda training camp.\n\nPreviously listed as \"disappeared\" by Human Rights Watch.\n\n2. Abu Faisal\n\nReportedly arrested on December 12, 2001\n\nNationality unknown. See next entry.\n\n3. Abdul Aziz\n\nReportedly arrested on December 14, 2001\n\nNationality unknown. In early January 2001, Kenton Keith, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, produced a chart with the names of senior al-Qaeda members listed as killed in action, detained, or on the run. Faisal and Aziz were listed as detained on Dec. 12 and 14, 2001. See: Andrea Stone, \"Path to bin Laden may lie behind bars; US interrogates al-Qaeda, Taliban prisoners in hope of nailing down war on terror's prime targets,\" USA Today, January 8, 2002; Bradley Graham and Walter Pincus, \"Al-Qaeda Trainer in U.S. Hands,\" The Washington Post, January 5, 2002.\n\n4.

Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi\n\nReportedly arrested in January 2002\n\nNationality unknown, presumably Iraqi, suspected commander of al-Qaeda training camp.

Previously listed as \"disappeared\" by Human Rights Watch (see note 27).\n\n7. Muhammed al-Darbi\n\nReportedly arrested in August 2002\n\nYemeni, suspected al-Qaeda member. The Washington Post reported on October 18, 2002: \"U.S. officials learned from interviews with Muhammad Darbi, an al Qaeda member captured in Yemen in August, that a Yemen cell was planning an attack on a Western oil tanker, sources said.\" On December 26, 2002, citing \"U.S. intelligence and national security officials,\" the Washington Post reports that al-Darbi, as well as Ramzi Binalshibh [see below], Omar al-Faruq [reportedly escaped from U.S. custody in July 2005], and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri [see below] all \"remain under CIA control.\"\n\n8.

Muhamad Abdel Rahman was arrested in Quetta, Pakistan, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\" David Johnston, New York Times, March 4, 2003: \"On Feb. 13, when Pakistani authorities raided an apartment in Quetta, they got the break they needed. They had hoped to find Mr. [Khalid Sheikh] Mohammed, but he had fled the apartment, eluding the authorities, as he had on numerous occasions. Instead, they found and arrested Muhammad Abdel Rahman, a son of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric. . .\"\n\n11.

Yassir al-Jazeeri (aka al-Jaziri)\n\nReportedly arrested on March 15, 2003, Pakistan.\n\nPossibly Moroccan, Algerian, or Palestinian, suspected al-Qaeda member, linked to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Details of arrest reported: Alex Spillius, \"FBI Questions al-Qaeda Man in Pakistan,\" Daily Telegraph, March 17, 2003; Paul Haven, \"Al-Qaida suspect begins cooperating with authorities, Pakistani security officials say,\" Associated Press, March 17, 2003.\n\n15. Ali Abdul Aziz Ali (aka Ammar al Baluchi)\n\nReportedly arrested on April 29, 2003, Karachi, Pakistan.\n\nA Pakistani, he is alleged to have funneled money to September 11 hijackers, and alleged to have been involved with the Jakarta Marriot bombing and in handling Jose Padilla's travel to the United States.\n\nU.S. Judge Sidney Stein ruled that defense attorneys for Uzair Paracha could introduce statements Baluchi made to U.S. interrogators, proving that he was in U.S. custody.
