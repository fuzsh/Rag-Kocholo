        "text": "Even before the CIA captured its first prisoner under the detention and interrogation program, agency lawyers began thinking about how to get approval for interrogation methods that might normally be considered torture. Such methods might gain wider approval, the lawyers wrote in a November 2001 memo, if they were proved to have saved lives.\n\nAfter a Senate committee’s report on the interrogation program was released Tuesday, the CIA acknowledged that its statements were sometimes inaccurate or speculative, and it promised to do better in the future. But it said the committee’s report unfairly dismissed the value of intelligence gathered from detainees, particularly in understanding al-Qaeda and tracking Osama bin Laden.\n\nHere are seven cases cited in the report where the CIA made the case that its tactics thwarted plots and led to the capture of terrorists, and how the committee’s report undercut those accounts:\n\nKILLING OF OSAMA BIN LADEN\n\nCIA's case: No counterterrorism mission was more successful or higher-profile than the secret raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Almost immediately, CIA officials began telling Congress that its interrogation program led them to a secretive courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, who in turn led the CIA to the doorstep of the world's most-wanted terrorist.\n\nSenate report: In page after page of previously classified evidence, the committee calls those statements inaccurate. The report shows that, as early as 2002, the CIA received a wealth of evidence about the courier, including his alias and his association with bin Laden, as well as a physical description and family connections that would later prove crucial in finding him. The linchpin in the hunt for the courier was a detainee named Hassan Ghul. But Ghul was cooperative from the outset. Ghul spoke expansively about the courier, describing him as bin Laden's closest assistant. Despite the cooperation, the CIA decided to torture Ghul, subjecting him to sleep deprivation and stress positions. But he provided \"no actionable threat information.\" Nevertheless, after the bin Laden raid, the CIA provided Congress with a document listing Ghul as a detainee who had been subjected to enhanced interrogation and provided valuable intelligence on bin Laden's courier.\n\nJOSÉ PADILLA\n\nCIA's case: José Padilla, who was accused of plotting a radiological dirty bomb attack inside the United States, was one of the first American citizens designated an enemy combatant. The Bush administration credited the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah with uncovering the plot and leading investigators to Padilla. His arrest has been held up for years as proof that waterboarding and other tactics worked.\n\nSenate report: Zubaydah's information on Padilla was sketchy, and he provided it well before he was waterboarded. Padilla, in fact, was arrested in May 2002, three months before the CIA interrogation program began.\n\nKARACHI PLOTS\n\nCIA's case: President George W. Bush credited the CIA interrogation program with helping to prevent an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. The tip can be traced back to the interrogations of Ammar al-Baluchi and Khallad bin Attash, who were subjected to harsh CIA interrogations in May 2003. Intelligence reports from those interrogations state that al-Qaeda was plotting attacks on the consulate and other Western targets in Karachi.\n\nSenate report: The CIA already knew that information. Baluchi and bin Attash had provided it weeks earlier to Pakistani officials, who relayed it to the CIA. So when the intelligence report on the Karachi plot was issued, CIA officials in Pakistan were nonplused. They issued a cable saying they \"had become aware of most of this reporting\" already. Security at the consulate had been increased based on earlier threats, the officers reported.\n\n'SECOND WAVE' PLOT\n\nCIA's case: In 2006, the White House announced that the Sept. 11 attacks had been conceived as an attack on two fronts, with a \"second wave\" planned on the West Coast. The plot, as described by Bush, involved hijacking an airplane and crashing it into Library Tower in Los Angeles. In a memo to the Justice Department, the CIA credited the waterboarding of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed with uncovering this plot.\n\nSenate report: The CIA learned about the plot in January 2002 with the arrest of Masran bin Arshad, a Malaysian who was involved. Mohammed confirmed the existence of the plot after being tortured, to the frustration of CIA interrogators who said he was confirming only what they already knew.\n\nIYMAN FARIS\n\nCIA's case: In 2003, the Justice Department charged an Ohio truck driver, Iyman Faris, in an al-Qaeda plot to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge by cutting its suspension cables. In government briefings, CIA officials repeatedly credited the interrogation program with uncovering the plot and identifying Faris.\n\nSenate report: It was actually a court-approved wiretap of another American suspect, Majid Khan, that prompted the FBI investigation into Faris. Khan's capture and interrogation by a foreign government — without any harsh tactics, according to CIA documents — led to the identification of Faris as an al-Qaeda member.\n\nHEATHROW AIRPORT AND CANARY WHARF PLOT\n\nCIA's case: After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mohammed hoped to use hijacked airplanes to attack Heathrow Airport and Canary Wharf, a business district in London. The CIA credited its enhanced interrogation of him with uncovering the plot.\n\nSenate report: The CIA knew that al-Qaeda had targeted Heathrow months before Mohammed was captured and waterboarded. The plot was labeled \"not imminent\" because al-Qaeda had not identified pilots for the mission. The CIA also said that intelligence acquired after enhanced interrogations allowed the CIA to conclude the plot had been disrupted.\n\nKHALID SHAIKH MOHAMMED\n\nCIA's case: Bush credited the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and senior al-Qaeda operative Ramzi bin al-Shibh with providing \"information that helped in the planning and execution of the operation that captured Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\" The CIA also credited its interrogation of Abu Zubaydah with revealing Mohammed as the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. \"It was Abu Zubaydah, early in his detention, who identified K.S.M. as the mastermind of 9/11,\" Michael Hayden, director of the CIA, told Congress. \"Until that time, K.S.M. did not even appear in our charge of key al-Qaeda members and associates.\"\n\nSenate report: CIA documents show that Mohammed was a suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks almost immediately. Also, in a section of the report that was heavily redacted by the CIA, the committee showed that a source — referred to as Asset X — led the CIA to Mohammed, seeking a $25 million reward.\n\nThe New York Times,\n\nThe Associated Press"
