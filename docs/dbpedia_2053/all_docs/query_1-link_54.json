        "text": "A hotly disputed US Senate torture report concludes that waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods provided no key evidence in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, according to congressional aides and outside experts familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe CIA still disputes that conclusion.\n\nFrom the moment of bin Laden's death almost three years ago in what was America's biggest counterterrorism success, former Bush administration and some senior CIA officials have cited the evidence trail leading to the al-Qaida mastermind's compound in Pakistan as vindicating the \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" they authorized after the September 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nBut Democratic and some Republican senators have disputed that account. They described simulated drownings, sleep deprivation and other such practices as cruel and ineffective. With the release edging closer for the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on interrogations, renditions and detentions, they hope to make a persuasive case.\n\nThe report, congressional aides and outside experts said, examines the treatment of several high-level terror detainees and the information they provided on bin Laden. The aides and people briefed on the report spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the confidential document.\n\nThe most high-profile detainee linked to the bin Laden investigation was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, whom the CIA waterboarded 183 times. Mohammed, intelligence officials have noted, confirmed after his 2003 capture that he knew an important al-Qaida courier with the nom de guerre Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.\n\nBut the report concludes that such information wasn't critical, according to the aides. Mohammed only discussed al-Kuwaiti months after being waterboarded, while he was under standard interrogation, they said. And Mohammed neither acknowledged al-Kuwaiti's significance nor provided interrogators with the courier's real name.\n\nThe debate over how investigators put the pieces together is significant because years later, the courier led US intelligence to the sleepy Pakistani military town of Abbottabad. There, Navy Seals killed bin Laden in a secret mission.\n\nThe CIA also has pointed to the value of information provided by senior al-Qaida operative Abu Faraj al-Libi, who was captured in 2005 and held at a secret prison.\n\nUS officials have described how al-Libi made up a name for a trusted courier and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Al-Libi, they said, was so adamant and unbelievable in his denial that the CIA took it as confirmation he and Mohammed were protecting the courier.\n\nBut the report concludes evidence gathered from al-Libi wasn't significant either, the aides said.\n\nEssentially, they argued, Mohammed, al-Libi and others subjected to harsh treatment confirmed only what investigators already knew about the courier. And when they denied the courier's significance or provided misleading information, investigators would only have considered that significant if they already presumed the courier's importance.\n\nThe aides did not address information provided by yet another al-Qaida operative: Hassan Ghul, captured in Iraq in 2004. Intelligence officials have described Ghul as the true lynchpin of the bin Laden investigation after he identified al-Kuwaiti as a critical courier.\n\nIn a 2012 news release, Dianne Feinstein, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Carl Levin acknowledged an unidentified \"third detainee\" had provided relevant information on the courier. But they said he did so the day before he was subjected to harsh CIA interrogation. \"This information will be detailed in the Intelligence committee's report,\" the senators said at the time.\n\nIn any case, it still took the CIA years to learn al-Kuwaiti's real identity: Sheikh Abu Ahmed, a Pakistani man born in Kuwait. How the US learned of Ahmed's name is still unclear.\n\nWithout providing full details, aides said the Senate report illustrates the importance of the National Security Agency's efforts overseas.\n\nIntelligence officials have previously described how in the years when the CIA couldn't find where bin Laden's courier was, NSA eavesdroppers came up with nothing until 2010 â€” when Ahmed had a telephone conversation with someone monitored by U.S. intelligence.\n\nAt that point, U.S. intelligence was able to follow Ahmed to bin Laden's hideout.\n\nFeinstein and other senators have spoken only vaguely of the contents of the classified review. But they have made references to the divergence between their understanding of how the bin Laden operation came together and assertions of former CIA and Bush administration officials who have defended harsh interrogations.\n\nFeinstein will push to release a summary of the intelligence committee's review later this week, starting a declassification process that could take several months before any documents are made public."
