Ghul is described as an al-Qaeda facilitator in the 9-11 Commission Report, which also confirms that Ghul was in U.S. custody. On January 26, 2004, President Bush congratulated U.S. intelligence agents for their role in Ghuls apprehension. After his apprehension, Ghul was reportedly interrogated by U.S. military and intelligence officials. On December 5, 2005, ABC News reported that he had been held in a secret U.S. detention facility in Poland.3 On July 19, 2006 his name was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List.4 No other information about Ghuls fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAli Abd al-Rahman al-Faqasi al-Ghamdi (Abu Bakr al Azdi)\n\nIn May or June 2003, al-Ghamdi, a national of Saudi Arabia, turned himself in to authorities in Medina, Saudi Arabia, reportedly because his wife had been arrested several weeks earlier. The 9-11 Commission Report, referring to al-Ghamdi as a candidate hijacker for the attacks of September 11, 2001, acknowledged that al-Ghamdi was in U.S. custody. On July 19, 2006, his name was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List. No other information about al-Ghamdi has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAli Abdul-Hamid al-Fakhiri (Ali Abd-al-Hamid al-Fakhiri, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi)\n\nAround November 11, 2001, al-Fakhiri, a national of Libya, was apprehended in Kohat, Pakistan by Pakistani officials. Al-Fakhiri is allegedly a member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and the leader of the Al Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan from 1995 until 2000. Soon after his apprehension, al-Fakhiri was in U.S. custody in Kandahar, Afghanistan and reportedly came under the control of the CIA in January 2002 after a dispute between the CIA and the FBI regarding who would have control over al-Fakhiri. Reports indicate that al-Fakhiri was transferred to the U.S.S. Bataan by January 9, 2002 and then transferred to Egypt in January 2002. Al-Fakhiri may have been held in another country before being sent to a secret U.S. detention facility in Afghanistan in 2003. Al-Fakhiri was reportedly transferred out of Afghanistan in late 2003 to a secret U.S. detention facility and then transferred to Libya in late 2005 or early 2006. On December 5, 2005, ABC News reported that he had been held in a secret U.S. detention facility in Poland.5 Statements allegedly made by al-Fakhiri after his apprehension were reportedly a key part of U.S. pre-war intelligence on Iraq. In January 2004, al-Fakhiri is reported to have withdrawn his statements. Al-Fakhiri is now reportedly held in isolation in Tripoli, and said to be suffering from tuberculosis and to be in very poor health. At least one U.S. official has acknowledged U.S. involvement in elements of al-Fakhiris treatment, including questioning al-Fakhiri and transferring al-Fakhiri to a third country for interrogation. On July 19, 2006 his name was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List. No other information about al-Fakhiris fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain officially unexplained.\n\nCategory 2: Individuals about whom there is strong evidence, including witness testimony, of secret detention by the United States and whose fate and whereabouts remain unknown\n\nMustafa Setmariam Nasar (Abu Musab al-Suri, Umar Abd al-Hakim)\n\nOn or about November 1, 2005, Nasar, a dual Syrian-Spanish citizen, was apprehended in Quetta, Pakistan, by Pakistani officials. In November 2004, Nasar was identified on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists List and on November 18, 2004, the U.S. Department of State offered a reward of $U.S. 5 million for information concerning his location through its Rewards for Justice program and described Nasar as an al-Qaeda member and former trainer at camps in Afghanistan. Other reports describe Nasar as an ideologue and strategist, best known for his writings. Nasar is also wanted in Spain in connection with al-Qaeda activities. In April and May 2006, Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed that Nasar was wanted by both the U.S. and Syria, had been handed over to U.S. custody at least two months earlier, and was not in Pakistan. At around the same time, in March 2006, Nasars name was removed from at least one U.S. government list of terrorism suspects. On July 19, 2006, his name was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List. No other information about Nasars fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain officially unexplained.\n\nTwo, possibly three, Somalis [Names Unknown] (one of whom is either Shoeab as-Somali or Rethwan as-Somali)*\n\nSometime prior to December 2004, two Somali nationals were apprehended and detained in a secret U.S. detention facility. Between December 2004 and late 2005, Marwan Jabour6 reports that two Somalis were held in the cells next to his and that he sometimes would hear the Somalis talking with each other in Somali.\n\nWhile in that facility, Jabour was also shown a photograph of a Somali man whom he had known previously and recognized as either Shoeab as-Somali or Rethwan as-Somali. Jabour recognized that the photograph had been taken in his previous cell in the same facility. The Somali man in the photograph may or may not have been one of the Somalis held in the cells next to Jabour between December 2004 and late 2005.\n\nNo information about these detainees fates has been released by the U.S. government, and their whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nMohammed Naeem Noor Khan (Abu Talha, Abu Talaha)\n\nOn July 13, 2004, Khan, a national of Pakistan, was reportedly apprehended by Pakistani authorities with the assistance of the CIA and other U.S. agencies. Media reports since his disappearance have alleged that Khan is suspected of working as a computer and communications expert with al-Qaeda. In his 2006 memoir, In the Line of Fire, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf provides details of the apprehension and subsequent treatment of an unnamed Pakistani national that strongly correlate with information available regarding Khan.7 President Musharraf records that the individual was apprehended by Pakistani officials based on vital leads provided by the U.S. who had also been tracking him and that British authorities were given direct access to the individual. At least one detainee held in a secret U.S. detention facility was shown photos of Khan that suggested he was in custody. On July 19, 2006, the name Abu Tallah was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List. No information about Khans fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAbdul Basit\n\nBefore or during June 2004, Basit, a national of probably either Saudi Arabia or Yemen, was apprehended and transferred to a secret U.S. detention facility where according to Marwan Jabour he spoke with other prisoners held in the facility and gave his name as Abdul Basit. No information about Basits fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAdnan [Last Name Unknown]\n\nBefore or during June 2004, Adnan was apprehended and transferred to a secret U.S. detention facility where according to Marwan Jabour he spoke with other prisoners held in the facility and gave his name as Adnan. No information about Adnans fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nHudaifa\n\nBefore or during June 2004, Hudaifa was apprehended and transferred to a secret U.S. detention facility where according to Marwan Jabour he spoke with other prisoners held in the facility and gave his name as Hudaifa. No information about Hudaifas fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nMohammed [Last Name Unknown] (Mohammed al-Afghani)\n\nMohammed, an Afghan born in Saudi Arabia, was apprehended in May 2004 in Peshawar, Pakistan. According to Marwan Jabour, Mohammed was transferred with him and two other prisoners out of a facility in Islamabad, Pakistan on June 16, 2004 and imprisoned with Jabour in a secret U.S. detention facility. No information about Mohammeds fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nKhalid al-Zawahiri\n\nOn February 25, 2004, al-Zawahiri, a national of Egypt, was apprehended in Azam Warak in the South Waziristan region of Pakistan by Pakistani officials. He was reportedly questioned by both Pakistani and U.S. intelligence officials shortly after his apprehension, and there are indications that he was transferred to U.S. custody, possibly in Afghanistan.

Jabour heard Ayoub al-Libi call out to him once during the first month of captivity in the secret U.S. detention facility. A prisoner with the surname al-Mahdi-Jawdeh (aka Ayoub al-Libi) (see page 13), was reportedly transferred from secret U.S. detention to Libyan custody in 2006, and may well be the same person. No information about al-Libis fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nAbu Naseem\n\nNaseem, a national of Tunisia, was apprehended in Peshawar, Pakistan, on June 17, 2003 by Pakistani authorities. He was reportedly suspected of providing forged documents to al-Qaeda, and of facilitating other al-Qaeda operations. Reports at the time of his arrest suggested that he may have been transferred to U.S. custody. Another suspect arrested on the same day was reportedly transferred to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan. A witness reported hearing his voice in a secret U.S. detention facility in Afghanistan in late 2003. No information about Naseems fate has been released by the U.S. government, and his whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nSuleiman Abdalla Salim (Suleiman Abdalla, Suleiman Abdalla Salim Hemed, Suleiman Ahmed Hemed Salim, Issa Tanzania)\n\nOn March 18, 2003, Salim, a national of either Yemen or Tanzania, was reportedly apprehended in Mogadishu, Somalia. Somali warlords reportedly abducted him from a hospital and delivered him to an airport in Mogadishu, where U.S. officials took custody of him. Salim was reportedly sought by the U.S. for alleged involvement in the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. Witness testimony indicates that Salim was held in at least two secret U.S. detention facilities in Afghanistan during 2004. The former detainee who saw Salim said that Salim had been badly tortured while in U.S. custody: his arms had been broken, and he had been hit in the head with the butt of a gun.

Reports indicate that al-Jazeeri was jointly interrogated by Pakistani and U.S. agents. Although al-Jazeeri was not included on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists List at the time of his apprehension, he was characterized as among the top seven leaders of the al-Qaeda network by Pakistans Federal Information Minister.\n\nWitness testimonies indicate that al-Jazeeri was held in a CIA-operated portion of Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan, in late 2003 through early 2004. Al-Jazeeri was transferred to a secret U.S. detention facility in April 2004, where Marwan Jabour reports that he was allowed to meet with him several times as late as June 2006. According to Jabour, al-Jazeeri told him that he had been in a place with U.S. interrogators where he had been tortured, and that he had permanent damage to his arm as a result of being badly beaten.

Information from Abdel-Rahman reportedly led to the joint U.S.-Pakistan arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a detainee who the U.S. government has acknowledged was in the U.S. Secret Detention Program and is presently held at Guantánamo Bay. Reports indicate that Abdel-Rahman was in U.S. custody after his apprehension and that Abdel-Rahman was being questioned by U.S. authorities in early March 2003. On December 5, 2005, ABC News reported that he had been held in a secret U.S. detention facility in Poland.9 On July 19, 2006 his name was included in the Terrorists No Longer a Threat List.
