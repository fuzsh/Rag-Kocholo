        "text": "WASHINGTON â€” Former and current U.S. intelligence officials say the terrorist described as the linchpin in the hunt for Osama bin Laden has rejoined al-Qaeda after the Bush administration released him from a secret CIA prison.\n\nThe CIA returned Hassan Ghul to his native Pakistan shortly after the U.S. decided to close its secret prisons in Eastern Europe in early 2006. Officials say Pakistan held Ghul for at least a year before he was released."
