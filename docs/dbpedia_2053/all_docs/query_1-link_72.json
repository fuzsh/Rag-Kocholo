        "text": "Dead Man's Quadrangle: The Brave and the Bold #127 (1976): he ignores a criminal's mayday call, deducing it to be fake. It then transpires that the call was genuine, and the criminal has drowned as a result of Batman's inaction\n\nBatman-Ex - - As in Extinct: Batman #288 (1977): he uses a bad guy as a human shield by hurling him into the trajectory of the Penguin's gunfire, killing the man in the process\n\nSkull Dugger's Killjoy Capers: Batman #290 (1977): he electrocutes Dugger by throwing him into a nest of electrified cables\n\nTime...My Dark Destiny: The Brave and the Bold #157 (1979): he causes a helicopter to crash and the pilot is killed in the explosion\n\n*the pic was lost for this panel. Sorry.\n\nWhere Walks a Snowman: Batman #337 (1981): he uses the flash of a marker flare to knock Klaus Kristin (aka. the Snowman) off a cliff.\n\nThe Crystal Armageddon: The Brave and the Bold #159 (1980): he kills a member of the League of Assassins by throwing him against a wall made from a lethal formula, which then causes the assassin to turn to crystal and die. Batman knew this would happen and had actually warned someone against touching the wall earlier in the same scene\n\nThe Monster in the Mirror: Detective Comics #517 (1982): he kills Marley and drinks his blood\n\nThose Who Live By The Sword: The Brave and the Bold #193 (1982): he stomach throws Bloodclaw off the Woodrow Wilson Bridge\n\n*the pic was lost for this panel. Sorry.\n\nThe Messiah of the Crimson Sun: Batman Annual #8 (1982): he kills Ra's Al Ghul by drawing his spaceship into lethal sun rays\n\nNight of Blood: The Brave and the Bold #195 (1983): he stabs the vampire Gunnarson through the chest with a wooden table leg.\n\nBatman: Year Two: Detective Comics #575-578 (1987): he takes Chill to Crime Alley, whereupon the Batman unmasks himself and reveals his true identity. He disarms Chill and turns the gunman's own weapon against him. Batman places the gun to Chill's forehead and is about to shoot him when suddenly the Reaper kills him first. Disappointed, Batman chases down and confronts the Reaper for the last time. At the end of the confrontation, the Reaper plummets to his death, taking the secret of Batman's true identity with him. But before he falls, he tells the Dark Knight \"I didn't think you were a killer? I see now I was wrong\", implying that Batman would have killed Joe Chill had he not got to him first\n\n*The pic was lost for this. Sorry.\n\nSon of the Demon(1987): he causes a helicopter crash that kills everyone aboard. At the end of the story he kills Qayin by kicking him into some electric cables\n\nSkeeter: Action Comics Annual #1 (1987): he stabs Skeeter through the back with a wooden stake\n\nThe fate of the second assassin is less ambiguous, as Batman snares him with a grappling hook and hauls him off a water tower. Batman appears totally unrepentant afterwards, remarking: \"Tough, Trooper Omega &#8211; but when you play deadly games, you can't cry 'fingers'!\"\n\nIn 'A Monster Walks Wayne Manor' (Detective Comics #438, January 1974) Batman kicks Ubu onto a splintered railing. The actual impalement happens off panel, but Dr. Varnov is present to caption the incident: \"H-he impaled himself on the splintered railing...\" However, the artwork clearly shows that it was the momentum of Batman's kick that sent Ubu to his doom.\n\nThe Earth-Two Batman was responsible for the death of his wife, Selina Wayne, as depicted in 'Huntress: From Each Ending... A Beginning!' (DC Super-Stars #17, December 1977). During a fight with some criminals Batman kicked an opponent's gun, causing it to veer to the side and discharge. The resultant shot hit Catwoman, knocking her over a balcony and sending her plummeting to her death.\n\nThis event caused the Earth-Two Bruce Wayne to burn his Batsuit and retire as Batman. And in case there was any doubt as to Bruce's culpability in his wife's death, he openly acknowledges it in 'United We Fall!' (All-Star Comics #69, November 1977).\n\nBatman tries to kill Cat-Man in 'Nine Lives Has the Cat' (Detective Comics #509, December 1981) by knocking him off a boat. He then stands by and watches as Cat-Man apparently drowns. Of course Cat-Man's nine lives allowed him to show up again in later stories. But to all intents and purposes, Batman tried to kill him at the end of this story.\n\nIn 'The Doomsday Book' (Detective Comics #572, March 1987) Batman uses a dazed criminal as a human shield to protect himself from gunfire, sacrificing the criminal to save his own life.\n\nIn 'Infected' (Legends of the Dark Knight #84, June 1996) Batman tries several times to kill the villain, a hallucinating soldier who's been driven kill crazy by military experiments. He finally succeeds in killing the solider by shooting him several times with a handgun and knocking him off a dam. The Caped Crusader's internal monologue makes it pretty clear this was a deliberate, albeit regrettable, premeditated killing.\n\nIn Year One: Batman/Ra's al Ghul (2005) Batman intentionally kills two bad guys who are pursuing him on snowmobiles by firing a flaregun at a mountain and creating an avalanche that buries them.\n\nIn 'An American Batman in London' (Detective Comics #590, September 1988), Batman knocks Abu Hassan out of a window by throwing one of his goons into him. Hassan falls and is impaled on a fence. Batman shouts \"No!\" as this happens, so it clearly wasn't intentional. We'll just chalk it up to clumsiness.\n\nBut there's nothing accidental about what he does to a group of Hassan's terrorist henchmen later in the story. Batman steals a car and uses it to mow them down at high speed, leaping out of the vehicle just before it hits them.\n\nAnd just in case any of the terrorists survived, the impact of the collision triggers an explosive device one of them was carrying, blowing them all to smithereens.\n\nIn 'The Fear' (Detective Comics #592, November 1988) Batman kicks a drug-addicted suicide bomber into a safe, triggering the bomb he was carrying and killing him.\n\nIn 'Our Man in Havana' (Detective Comics #595, February 1989) Batman discovers a munitions factory belonging to the Alien Alliance. It is heavily guarded by representatives from several different alien species, including members of the Thangarian race. In the end Batman blows up the factory and everyone inside by ramming a boat filled with explosives into it.\n\nIn 'Family' (Legends of the Dark Knight #31, June 1992) Batman travels to the Corto Maltese to rescue Alfred from a South American racketeer named El Vato. As they are escaping El Vato's base, Alfred runs down a pair of soldiers using a stolen lorry. Batman then triggers some explosives he'd planted in a weapons depot, blowing the villains' base to smithereens and killing many of El Vato's men in the process. This was clearly a calculated and premeditated act. Right at the beginning of the comic Batman had thought to himself: \"I want to kill them [...] God help me, Alfred. I may just kill tonight. If that's what it takes to save you.\"\n\nAnd indeed he did.\n\nIn Batman #340 (1981), Batman seemingly killed a mutated madman called The Mole, who was seeking revenge at a woman who was part of a parole-board hearing that denied him release from jail.\n\nIn a short story titled Second Face: The Avenger - Innocent Blood during Batman Annual #9 (1985), Batman ingeniously killed off two criminal groups: a local militia and a gang of bank robbers who disguised themselves by stealing the militia&#8217;s identity. As the two groups met to negotiate a deal to settle their dispute with each other, Batman lit up a firecracker, which tricked the two groups into thinking they were shooting at each other. As both gangs started firing, the bullets happen to hit a crate of explosives and blew up their hideout -instantly wiping each other out in the process. This example clearly shows that Batman wanted to avenge the deaths of all the innocent people who lost their lives because of these gangs.\n\nFinally, I found an example where Robin killed too, although not in cold blood. In Ten Nights of the Beast (1988), Robin prevented a suicidal bomber from murdering an entire police escort protecting President Ronald Reagan (who was actually Commissioner Gordon in disguise). Robin knocked the bomber&#8217;s parachute just in time before the crook fell to his fiery death.\n\n-Batman throwing a torch to burn supernatural flowers that keep an evil Mexican couple alive for more than a century in Detective Comics #395 (1970)...\n\n...as the flowers burn, the couple slowly disintegrate into decaying corpses...\n\n...and once they die, Batman writes down the year of their deaths on their tombstones.\n\n-Batman jumping above two armed thugs before they shoot him, and both of them end up murdering each other instead, in Batman #425 (1988). But it must be said that Batman regrets this happening.\n\nWhile I&#8217;m at it, I found another example of Robin having some blood on his hands yet again. In Batman #424 (1988), Jason Todd was outraged that Felipe Garzonas was about to get with murder because he had diplomatic immunity, despite the fact the crook&#8217;s violent abuse and harassment of a young woman drove her to commit suicide. It is implied, albeit ambiguously, that Robin had sent Garzonas falling to his death.\n\nSome of these are kind of a stretch tho. I wouldnt call them blatant murders of Batman.\n\nIndeed. Most of them are a stretch or invalid.\n\n- All the ones from the Golden Age were retconned when DC decreed Batman does not kill, and readers complained about him killing. DC editor Whitney Ellsworth then made it official that Batman does not kill; https://books.google.ie/books?id=rE...ge&q=whitney ellsworth batman killing&f=false\n\n- Batman #221 he throws a crook against a wall which turns out to be a secret hidden door that Batman didn't know about. Batman was trying to knock him out by slamming him into the wall. That's why he said \"Only chance his unpadded head\"\n\n- Absolutely nothing to suggest that guy died just because he fell into the water\n\n- Batman #235 a stray bullet shattered a beaker a second before Batman hit the guy. His hand accidentally touches the lethal stuff in it.\n\n- Batman #240. Read the dialogue. He was tricked into unknowingly killing the guy.\n\n- Batman #270. He punched the guy. He accidentally fell against a statue that toppled on him. No intention to murder him.\n\n- Batman #455. He killed a vampire. Vampires are already dead.\n\n- Brave and the Bold #127. Ignoring a mayday call he genuinely thinks is fake is not him killing someone.\n\n- Batman #337. He killed a snowman monster. If killing monsters makes him a killer, then BTAS Batman is a killer, too.\n\n- Brave and the Bold #159, he kicks away a guy who's attacking him, who accidentally hits the lethal crystal wall. This is like the third example of him just fending off an attacker in which the guy accidentally falls against something that kills him. No lethal intent on Batman's part.\n\n- The Monster in the Mirror: Detective Comics #517....Batman as a vampire. Does this even need explanation as to why it's not valid?\n\n- Batman Annual #8. Robin: \"You killed Ra's\", Batman: \"Have I, Robin?\". Ra's lived.\n\n- The Brave and the Bold #195. Another vampire kill.\n\n- Son of the Demon was written as an out of continuity story in 1987.\n\n- Action Comics Annual #1. Skeeter is another vampire.\n\n- The Cult(1988). Batman shooting someone in a hallucination dream. What is this doing on the list?\n\n- Batman #420. He reneged on leaving KGBeast there to die. He called the authorities and told them where to collect him.\n\n- Batman #425. Read the dialogue. It says the guy ignores the cars starting to fall just so he can try and kill Batman. Accident.\n\n- Legends of the Dark Knight #1. \"I didn't mean for him to die\".\n\n- Detective Comics #613. Another case of him kicking away an attacker who accidentally ended up dying. See; http://i1130.photobucket.com/albums/m536/Mybattyscans/tec613.jpg\n\n- Detective Comics Annual #4. A vision of the future that never happened. No idea why that one is on the list either.\n\n- All Star Batman is elseworlds and doesn't count. You're talking about a version who makes a child Dick Grayson eat rats here lol. Miller extreme.\n\n- Detective Comics #821. He hit a guy, who then went staggering away on to some train tracks in front of a train. Batman didn't kill him.\n\n- Superman and Batman VS Vampires and Werewolves. 'Nuff said.\n\n- Bronze Night: Batman/Doc Savage #1. Elseworlds story.\n\n- Legends of the Dark Knight #84. Yet another example of him kicking away an attacker who accidentally ends up dead. He even tries to warn the guy of it in this panel.\n\n- Detective Comics #423. gun shot wound to the arm doesn't kill you. He caught the second guy with his rope.\n\n- Detective Comics #438. And another one where Batman kicks someone off him in defense, they accidentally die.\n\n- DC Super-Stars #17, December 1977. This one even says a stray bullet hit Catwoman in the arm which accidentally caused her to fall to her death. It's not even an in continuity story, or even Batman's fault.\n\n- Detective Comics #509. Catman lived.\n\n- (Legends of the Dark Knight #84, June 1996. The guy was turned into an unstoppable monster. Batman had no choice.\n\n- Year One: Batman/Ra's al Ghul (2005). Batman didn't kill these guys, he just smashed their snow mobiles.\n\n- Detective Comics #590. And yet another example of him knocking some away in self defense and it accidentally ending in a death. You can even see him shout NO when it happens. The second incidence happened because one of the guys was wired with a bomb. That's why they blew up. Batman had just been trying to stop them from shooting the U.N. guys.\n\n- Detective Comics #592. Batman did not trigger the bomb the guy was carrying. He was a suicide bomber who was planning to take himself and everyone in the room. Batman contained it by shoving him in the steel vault so he'd only kill himself.\n\n- Legends of the Dark Knight #31. He didn't kill anyone. He created a diversion. He even says so himself in the panel.\n\n- Batman and the Outsiders #26. It says right there Batman had no idea that injecting the guy with truth serum would kill him.\n\n- Batman and the Outsiders #30. He doesn't trick them into doing anything. He just dodges their attack.\n\n- Flashpoint (2011). The Thomas Wayne Batman kills Eobard Thawne/Reverse Flash. The Thomas Wayne Batman?

Another guy falls into the water and disappears. Doesn't make him dead.\n\n- Detective Comics #395. Destroying supernatural flowers that have allowed immortals to live for years. That would be like destroying a Lazarus pit on Ra's. Doesn't make him a killer.\n\n- Batman #425. He just dodged their gun fire, and he even says he didn't want any more deaths.\n\nOne he kicked a guy who bumped into another guy who fell in a trash compactor and another was Batman jumping out of the way of 2 gunman who shot eachother. I wouldnt count those as murders.. there are a few more in here like a few Elseworlds stories that I wouldnt count either.\n\nHalf of them are cases like that. A guy accidentally falling into something, or against something. Some are elseworld tales. Some are him killing monsters and vampires. Some are him just dodging gun fire and crooks accidentally shooting themselves. Then there's all the Golden age ones that got retconned.\n\nIndeed. Most of them are a stretch or invalid.\n\n- All the ones from the Golden Age were retconned when DC decreed Batman does not kill, and readers complained about him killing. DC editor Whitney Ellsworth then made it official that Batman does not kill; https://books.google.ie/books?id=rE...ge&q=whitney ellsworth batman killing&f=false\n\n- Batman #221 he throws a crook against a wall which turns out to be a secret hidden door that Batman didn't know about. Batman was trying to knock him out by slamming him into the wall. That's why he said \"Only chance his unpadded head\"\n\n- Absolutely nothing to suggest that guy died just because he fell into the water\n\n- Batman #235 a stray bullet shattered a beaker a second before Batman hit the guy. His hand accidentally touches the lethal stuff in it.\n\n- Batman #240. Read the dialogue. He was tricked into unknowingly killing the guy.\n\n- Batman #270. He punched the guy. He accidentally fell against a statue that toppled on him. No intention to murder him.\n\n- Batman #455. He killed a vampire. Vampires are already dead.\n\n- Brave and the Bold #127. Ignoring a mayday call he genuinely thinks is fake is not him killing someone.\n\n- Batman #337. He killed a snowman monster. If killing monsters makes him a killer, then BTAS Batman is a killer, too.\n\n- Brave and the Bold #159, he kicks away a guy who's attacking him, who accidentally hits the lethal crystal wall.
