(Added August 11, 2011) Abu Nidal Organisation ANO Fatah Revolutionary Council aka Arab Revolutionary Brigades aka Black September aka Revolutionary Organisation of Socialist Muslims Iraq & Lebanon Abu Nidal is a terrorist organization widely known for deadly attacks in the 1980s on Western, Palestinian, and Israeli targets. They were attempting to derail diplomatic relations between the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and the West, while advocating for the destruction of Israel. The organization was named for a former member of the PLO who split off in a dispute over establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade AAMS Palestinian Territories The Palestinian group al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade evolved in recent years from a Fatah linked coalition of militias seeking an end to Israel’s presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip into a more radical organization. Emerging around the time of what Palestinians call the “Second Intifada” in 2000, the brigade at first targeted Israeli settlers and military outposts. Al-Aqsa Foundation AAF Europe / Pakistan / Yemen The al-Aqsa Foundation is an international charity with alleged ties to the Palestinian militant organisation Hamas. The head office of the foundation was located in Germany until it was closed by the German authorities in July 2002. The organisation is known to have local branch offices in the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Pakistan, South Africa, Yemen and elsewhere. Al-Takfir Wa Al-Hijra Europe The movement, Al-Takfir Wa Al-Hijra (Excommunication and exile), has gradually built its presence in Europe in recent years through loose networks of imams and supporters, according to Jane’s Intelligence Review. ‘‘It is so extreme that it once tried to assassinate bin Laden and its members are thought to have aided Madrid train atrocity,’’ the report said. Babbar Khalsa Previously active groups included the Azad Khalistan Babbar Khalsa Force, Khalistan Liberation Front, and Khalistan Commando Force. Pakistan Sikh terrorism is sponsored by expatriate and Indian Sikh groups who want to carve out an independent Sikh state called Khalistan (Land of the Pure) from Indian terroritory. Active groups include Babbar Khalsa, International Sikh Youth Federation, Dal Khalsa, Bhinderanwala Tiger Force. A previously unknown group, the Saheed Khalsa Force, claimed credit for the marketplace bombings in New Delhi in 1997. Many of these groups, mentioned under AKA,operate under umbrella organizations, the most significant of which is the Second Panthic Committee. Communist Party of the Philippines NPA New People’s Army Philippines The Communist Party of the Philippines/National Democratic Front (CPP/NDF) networks abroad have effectively influenced the activities of Insurgents in the Philippines. The CPP/NDF started as a small core group in 1971 and reached its zenith in 1980 when it led a successful campaign against the government. Gama’a al-Islamiyya IG Al-Gama’a al-Islamiyya aka Islamic Group Egypt Jamaat al-Islamiyya is a radical group that seeks to install an Islamic regime in place of the secular Egyptian government. According to the State Department’s 2007 Country Report on Egypt, the group is responsible for the deaths of dozens of foreign tourists in Egypt in the 1990s. It has been listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department since 2001. Although the group has not carried out an attack in over a decade and the Egyptian-based leadership has rejected violence, some members of a more extreme faction are alleged to have connections to al-Qaeda. A spiritual leader who is aligned with the extreme faction of Jamaat, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, was convicted and jailed in the United States as the perpetrator of the 1993 World Trade Center attacks. İslami Büyük Doğu Akıncılar Cephesi IBDA-C Great Islamic Eastern Warriors Front Turkey The organisation is listed among the 12 active terrorist organisation in Turkey as of 2007 according to Counter-Terrorism and Operations Department of Directorate General for Security (Turkish police).[5] In December 2001, IBDA-C was labeled an “illegal organization” by the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. It is also one of the groups and entities to which European Union’s Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism applies.[6] In April 2003, the U.S. Department of State (DoS) designated the group as a “terrorist group” in their annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report. Hamas including Hamas-Izz al-Din al-Qassem Palestinian Territories Hamas is the largest and most influential Palestinian militant movement. In January 2006, the group won the Palestinian Authority’s (PA) general legislative elections, defeating Fatah, the party of the PA’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, and setting the stage for a power struggle. Since attaining power, Hamas has continued its refusal to recognize the state of Israel, leading to crippling economic sanctions. Historically, Hamas has sponsored an extensive social service network. The group has also operated a terrorist wing, carrying out suicide bombings and attacks using mortars and short-range rockets. Hizbul Mujahideen HM Pakistan Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) is one of the largest terrorist groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir and stands for the integration of J&K with Pakistan. Since its formation the HuM has also wanted the islamization of Kashmir. The HM was formed in 1989 in the Kashmir Valley with Master Ahsan Dar as its chief. Dar was later arrested by security forces in mid-December 1993. It was reportedly formed as the militant wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) at the behest of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistan’s external intelligence agency, to counter the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), which had advocated complete independence of the State. Many of the early Hizb cadres were former JKLF members. Hofstadgroep The Netherlands The Hofstadgroep is an Islamist terrorist organization of nine young Muslims in the Netherlands. The name “Hofstad” was originally the codename the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service used for the group, which leaked to the media in 2003. The name refers to a popular name for the city of The Hague, where some members had been active. The group was influenced by the ideology of Takfir wal Hijra, a violent Islamist organization. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development HLF USA The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, once considered the largest Muslim charity in the U.S., has been shut down by the government for funding Hamas. International Sikh Youth Federation ISYF Pakistan The International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF), proscribed in India under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) on March 22, 2002, was founded in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1984 after Operation Blue Star, conducted on June 5, 1984, to flush out Sikh terrorists from the Golden Temple complex, in Amritsar, in the Indian Punjab. Amrik Singh and Jasbir Singh Rode, a nephew of Jarnail Singh Bhinderanwale, founded the ISYF. Bhinderawale, a key figure in the secessionist Khalistan movement, was killed in Operation Blue Star. The ISYF has been declared as a proscribed organisation in the UK, along with 20 more outfits, on March 29, 2001. Besides, the ISYF has been disbanded in Canada on February 10, 2002. Khalistan Zindabad Force KZF Pakistan The Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), a proscribed group under The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, aims to establish a ‘sovereign Khalistan state’. Although the exact cadre strength and organisational structure of the KZF is not known, it is largely comprised of Jammu-based Sikhs. Ranjit Singh Neeta heads the KZF. Originally a resident of the Sumbal Camp area in Jammu, Neeta is reportedly now based somewhere in Pakistan. One of the 20 terrorists that India wants Pakistan to deport, Neeta began his career as a small-time criminal and subsequently developed links with smugglers in the R.S. Pora and Samba areas. His name figures in at least six First Information Reports filed after bomb blasts on trains and buses running between Jammu and Pathankot between 1988 and 1999. He is also alleged to have been involved in the killing of Deputy Superintendent of Police Devinder Sharma in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir in October 2001. Kurdistan Workers Party PKK KADEK aka KONGRA-GEL Turkey Tensions on the border between Turkey and Kurdish separatists in northern Iraq have reached a fever pitch. Turkey’s parliament voted in October 2007 to authorize military force inside Iraq, capping months of frustration over escalating violence and Iraq’s inability to reign in the Kurdistan Workers Party. Known as the PKK after its Kurdish name, Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan, the group is labeled a terrorist organization by US & EU, and continues to conduct strikes inside Turkey. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam LTTE Sri Lanka The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), also known as the Tamil Tigers, are a separatist group in Sri Lanka. Since the 1980s, the LTTE have been agitating for a homeland for ethnic Tamils, who feel persecuted by Sri Lanka’s ethnic majority, the Sinhalese. The LTTE is notorious for having pioneered the suicide bomb jacket, as well as the use of women in suicide attacks. They are blamed for a dozen high-level assassinations, over two hundred suicide attacks, and its war against the government has cost more than seventy thousand lives. In May 2009, the Sri Lankan government declared the twenty-six year long conflict had ended. Ejército de Liberación Nacional ELN National Liberation Army Colombia The National Liberation Army is one of the two main guerilla armies with left-wing political ideologies operating in the Colombian territory. Initially a Marxist-Leninist nationalist movement, it now appears more focused on kidnapping, extortion and attacks on economic infrastructure. Palestinian Islamic Jihad PIJ Palestinian Territories PIJ has been based in Damascus, Syria since 1989. PIJ was originally based in Egypt, later moved to the Gaza Strip and, following its exile from Gaza in the late 1980s, it was moved to Lebanon, then later to Damascus. Operates in the Palestinian territories, Israel, Lebanon and Syria. Receives essential support from Syria, which permits it sanctuary and from Iran, which provides significant funding (and, according to some sources, nearly the entirety of PIJ’s budget). Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine PFLP Palestinian Territories Lefist Palestinian nationalist group that formed after the Six Day War of 1967 and pioneered terrorist strategies in the early 1970s. Once a key player in Palestinian politics,the PFLP lost influence in the 1990s and was sidelined as Yasir Arafat established the Palestinian Authority. The PFLP, which pioneered such terror tactics as airline hijackings, formed in December 1967, after the Arab states’ overwhelming defeat in the Six Day War. In 1968, the PFLP joined the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the main umbrella organization of the Palestinian national movement, which was then committed to a strategy of “armed struggle.” The PFLP became the second-largest PLO faction, after Arafat’s own al-Fatah. The PFLP sought to topple conservative Arab states, destroy Israel, and apply Marxist doctrine to the Palestinian struggle, which it saw as part of a broader proletarian revolution. The group received support from the Soviet Union and China. Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command PFLP-GC Palestinian Territories Split from the PFLP in 1968, claiming it wanted to focus more on fighting and less on politics. Violently opposed to Arafat’s PLO. Led by Ahmad Jabril, a former captain in the Syrian Army. Jabril’s son, Jihad, was killed by a car bomb in May 2002. Closely tied to both Syria and Iran. Carried out dozens of attacks in Europe and the Middle East during the 1970s and 1980s. Known for cross-border terrorist attacks into Israel using unusual means, such as hot air balloons and motorized hang gliders. Primary focus now on guerrilla operations in southern Lebanon and small-scale attacks in Israel, West Bank, and Gaza Strip. Fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de Colombia FARC Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia Colombia As the biggest irregular guerrilla army in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) operates in different regions of the country mainly in search for financial sources to fight their 40-year old war against the government and maintain their army. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) is the oldest and most important guerrilla group in Western Hemisphere. It has long financed its political and military battle against the Colombian government by kidnapping, extortion and participating on various levels in the drug trafficking business. Devrimci Halk Kurtuluș Partisi-Cephesi DHKP/C Devrimci Sol aka Revolutionary Left aka Dev Sol aka Revolutionary People’s Liberation Army/Front/Party Turkey A Marxist, anti-Western splinter group of the Turkish terrorist group Devrimci Sol (Dev Sol). Dev Sol originated as a splinter group of Devrimci Yol (Dev Yol) which was itself a splinter group of the Turkish People’s Liberation Party-Front (THKP/C). The THKP/C was an offshoot of the broader Revolutionary Youth movement (Dev Genc) within Turkey. Sendero Luminoso SL Shining Path Peru Former university professor Abimael Guzman formed SL in Peru in the late 1960s, and his teachings created the foundation of SL’s militant Maoist doctrine. In the 1980s, SL became one of the most ruthless terrorist groups in the Western Hemisphere approximately 30,000 persons have died since Shining Path took up arms in 1980. The Peruvian Government made dramatic gains against SL during the 1990s, but reports of a recent SL involvement in narcotrafficking indicate that it may have a new source of funding with which to sustain a resurgence. Its stated goal is to destroy existing Peruvian institutions and replace them with a communist peasant revolutionary regime. It also opposes any influence by foreign governments, as well as by other Latin American guerrilla groups, especially the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Stichting Al Aqsa AAF Stichting Al Aqsa Nederland aka Al Aqsa Nederland The Netherlands Al Aqsa Foundation (AAF) is a critical part of the HAMAS terrorist support infrastructure. Through its headquarters in Germany and branch offices in the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Pakistan, South Africa, Yemen and elsewhere, AAF funnels money collected for charitable purposes to HAMAS terrorists. Like other HAMAS-affiliated charities, AAF uses humanitarian relief as cover to provide support to the HAMAS terrorist organization. Mahmoud Amr, the Director of AAF in Germany, is an active figure in HAMAS. Teyrbazen Azadiya Kurdistan TAK Kurdistan Freedom Falcons aka Kurdistan Freedom Hawks Turkey Militant Kurdish group operating in Turkey. The TAK is sometimes referred to as the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons. Though the group fits into the context of a wider Kurdish nationalist movement, its precise goals are not completely clear. It claims to oppose Turkey’s “false policies on the Kurdish issue,” and to be seeking revenge for the deaths of Kurds at the hands of the Turkish government. What this means in practice is uncertain, though the TAK could be seeking something as big as an independent Kurdish state that includes some of southeastern Turkey.\n\nJune 21, 2011 – Commission
