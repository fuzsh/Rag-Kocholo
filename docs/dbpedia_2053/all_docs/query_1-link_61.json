        "text": "Next character in Lucy W.‘s list is quite an obscure one, but somewhat fundamental nevertheless: Henri Ducard, the French mercenary who trained Bruce Wayne. Ducard appeared only in Batman Begins, and not exactly in the guise we expected: the name, in fact, was but an alias for Liam Neeson‘s Ra’s al Ghul, and he used it to hide his true identity from Bruce Wayne… and from the public, actually. Just as in the comics, “Ducard” trained Bruce and taught him how to fight, but the relationship between the two deteriorated when Bruce learnt that his mentor’s methods included killing people for a “higher good”… much like what happened in the comics. Let’s see together (we’ll integrate his classic New Earth biography with some elements uncovered on Prime Earth that do not contradict anything of the previous story apart from minor details. So yup, this Ducard has a family).\n\nHenri Ducard was born in France, most likely in Paris, the city where he lived when he was not working. He made quite a name for himself as a mercenary, and one of the most skilled man-hunters on the planet. He accepted jobs from pretty much anyone, and this obviously created him a lot of dangerous enemies. When on behalf of Interpol Ducard stopped a terrorist attack from Jeremiah Hassan, a French-Algerian extremist, Hassan organised a complex revenge on him, and sent one of his agents, Felicity Strode, to seduce Ducard, to win his trust, and to kill him right after breaking his heart. The plan succeeded only in its first part: Henri Ducard fell for it and was smitten by Felicity, but the woman eventually became pregnant with Henri’s child, so she decided not to kill him. Felicity faked her own death and freed herself from Hassan’s control; she confessed everything to her lover, and the two of them started a new life together. Felicity gave Henri a son, Morgan, whom Henri started to train as soon as he was old enough. The happy family didn’t last long, however: a little more than ten years later, Hassan found out Felicity was alive, and he blackmailed her to complete her mission and kill Ducard, if she didn’t want her son to be killed in her place. With no choice left, the woman agreed to do as she was told, but she didn’t realize Morgan was overhearing the conversation: as soon as she hung up, her own son stabbed her to protect his father. Henri was clearly shocked, but as soon as he realized what had actually happened he decided to continue Morgan’s training. Some time after that, after he had tried to track down Hassan for years, Ducard was met in Paris by a young American man, Bruce Wayne, who had found him using his contacts with Interpol: Wayne claimed to know where Hassan was hidden, and offered Ducard the information in exchange of being trained by the best man-hunter in the world. Ducard tested Wayne by ordering Morgan to attack him, and when the American managed to overpower his son, he decided to accept the offer, and spent the following months training Bruce along with Morgan. Much to his satisfaction, the American boy learnt quicker and better than his son had ever done, and he eventually grew closer to him than he had ever been to Morgan.\n\nBruce learnt the best from Ducard’s man-hunting skills, and eventually Henri put him on the test. Interpol, in fact, had hired the mercenary to take out another terrorist cell, and the leader was Jeremiah Hassan himself. Bruce proved to an even better man-hunter than his master, and located the terrorists… and Henri used the information to kill the man responsible for his wife’s death. At that point, finally, the naive Bruce Wayne saw clearly who his mentor was: an assassin for hire, quite far from the moral standards he wanted to adopt for himself. The two clashed over the rightfulness of taking lives, and parted ways; Ducard, however, sent Morgan to deliver a “final message” to Bruce, but when his son was defeated and humiliated once again, he disowned him and abandoned him, resuming a solitary life. Years passed before the two crossed paths once again: Henri Ducard was among the witnesses summoned to Gotham City to testify against Bruce Wayne, who was suspected to be a communist spy. Ducard had to clarify part of Bruce’s eight years of absence, and he agreed to help the commission in exchange of some diplomatic favors. Once in Gotham, however, it took a very short time to Ducard to realize that his former disciple was the man behind Batman‘s mask and, admired, he decided to help him instead. After uncovering a plot to assassinate Wayne within the commission, Ducard proceeded to kill every member of the commission itself, clearing for a new, honest commission to examine Bruce’s case and absolve him. Wayne was horrified by his mentor’s methods, but he still owed him his own freedom, and he let him go. Henri Ducard, on his side, wrote a letter to him expressing all his admiration for the “new persona” he had created, and encouraged him in continuing on that path; on the other hand, he decided to keep the information about Batman’s secret identity for himself, realizing that masked heroes and villains offered a great distraction to allow “normal” killers like himself to operate relatively undisturbed on an international scope. This wasn’t the last time Batman and his associates would have heard of Ducard: he would have crossed paths with Robin, Nightwing, Catwoman, Deadshot and the Suicide Squad, everytime managing to cure his own interest in the best way possible.\n\nHenri Ducard is a highly intelligent and cunning man (“The greatest waste of a brilliant mind I ever hope to see”, according to Batman), but also an amoral man who only pursues his interest in everything, and who considers murder just another business. He’s most likely the world’s best man-hunter, a remarkable investigator and tracker who can find pretty much anyone everywhere; he’s also an expert marksman and hand-to-hand combatant, as well as a remarkable strategist and a spy who can speak a variety of languages and blend in in every environment. An incredibly deductive mind accompanied by a total lack of human empathy and morality, Henri Ducard is a mercenary who works for both sides of the law, basing his ideals exclusively on the highest bidder."
