        "text": "A mundane email from the wife of an associate of Osama Bin Laden led to a drone strike that killed him, according to the latest story based on the NSA leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Hassan Ghul, whom the U.S. has never officially acknowledged killing, died in Pakistan in 2012. The story, from the Washington Post, is notable for two reasons: it gives more details on what happened to Ghul. And, it connects the NSA into the CIA's drone program, detailing how the agency relies on the NSA's intelligence collection programs, such as SIGNIT, to target its attacks.\n\nHere's how Ghul was found, as told by the Post:\n\nGhul has been known by U.S. intelligence since at least 2003. In 2011, he provided a bit of intelligence that helped to disclose Osama Bin Laden's safe house. Ghul was captured, and told interrogators of the leader's trusted courier, who was later identified and followed to the compound. Because of this, Ghul is a much-discussed figure in the ongoing debate on counterterrorist interrogation programs. the documents also show that the NSA was responsible for confirming that Ghul was killed:\n\nThe Post notes that the documents don't outline how specifically the emails were collected, but notes that the agency has a \"silent raid\" program of sorts to divert files from al Qaeda officials for further analysis. Those missions are extremely efficient. The Post writes, \"A single penetration yielded 90 encrypted al-Qaeda documents, 16 encryption keys, 30 unencrypted messages as well as “thousands” of chat logs\""
