        "text": "The Ethics of Forensic Psychologists in Detainee Interrogations\n\nThe executive summary reviews counterterrorism policies after the September 11, 2001, attacks (9/11), establishing the basis for CIA detainee interrogations. Six days after 9/11, President Bush signed a covert Memorandum of Notification permitting the CIA “to capture and detain persons who pose a continuing, serious threat of violence or death to U.S. persons and interests or who are planning terrorist activities” (Ref. 1, p 10). On February 7, 2002, President Bush issued another memorandum that detainees, as enemy combatants not as part of any state military, did not qualify for protections as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions, initiating deliberations among the CIA, Department of Justice, and advisors to the National Security Council on detainee treatment.1 Eventually, Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee issued a memo to White House Counsel Alberto Gonzalez in August 2002 defining physical and mental torture outside of the Geneva Conventions, which pertain only to state signatories.11 Rather than human rights standards, definitions were based on biomedical standards of “organ failure” and “psychological harm of significant duration,” enabling clinician participation in interrogations.10\n\nAlthough the above facts have been deduced through previously available documents, the executive summary's unique contribution is its account of the events leading to psychologists' involvement in detainee interrogations. Two psychologists, Grayson Swigert and Hammond Dunbar (the pseudonyms used in the report), developed EITs based on the theory of learned helplessness, defined in the summary as situations “in which individuals might become passive and depressed in response to adverse or uncontrollable events” (Ref. 1, p 21). (Psychologist Martin Seligman recently stated that he was “horrified” that his theory “may have been used for such dubious purposes” and denied discussing his work with them.12) The summary remarks on the psychologists' lack of relevant qualifications: “Neither psychologist had experience as an interrogator, nor did either have specialized knowledge of al-Qa'ida, a background in terrorism, or any relevant regional, cultural, or linguistic expertise” (Ref. 1, p 21). The CIA's response to the summary dissented, noting that the contractors “had the closest proximate expertise available to CIA” and that they had “written a number of research papers on such topics as resistance training, captivity familiarization, and learned helplessness” (Ref. 7, p 49). The CIA's response does not address the qualifications specified in the executive summary, proposing its own relevant qualifications.\n\nAnother contribution is the summary's details on the mental health consequences of EIT. An extant CIA contractor, Swigert proposed 12 techniques from the military's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) school as EITs in July 2002 and suggested that he and Dunbar be further contracted for services.1 The Attorney General approved 11 EITs that month, including waterboarding, facial slap, cramped confinement, wall standing, stress positions, sleep deprivation, and use of diapers on detainees.1 Abu Zubaydah was the first detainee to experience EITs, from August 4 through August 23, 2002, on a “near 24-hour-per-day basis” with waterboarding two to four times daily and confinement in a box lasting 266 hours (11 days, 2 hours).1 Detainees were transported to rendition sites abroad where they received buckets for human waste and were chained to bars above their heads for sleep deprivation, such that Ridha al-Najjar was described in September 2002 as “a broken man.”1 In November 2002, Gul Rahman was found dead of hypothermia after his clothing was removed for not cooperating during an interrogation.1 In October 2003, after 56 hours of sleep deprivation, Arsala Khan was “barely able to enunciate” and “visibly shaken by his hallucinations depicting dogs mauling and killing his sons and family” (Ref. 1, p 109). In January 2004, Hassan Ghul experienced hallucinations after 59 hours of sleep deprivation, but a psychologist told him that his reactions were “consistent with what many others experience in his condition” (Ref. 1, p 132) and sleep deprivation continued. Three additional detainees (Janat Gul, Sharif al-Masri, and Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani) “experienced auditory hallucinations following sleep deprivation” (Ref. 1, p 139). The summary's example of the longest period of sleep deprivation with psychologist oversight occurred with Muhammad Rahim: Rahim was subjected to 104.5 hours of sleep deprivation from July 21, 2007, to July 25, 2007. Sleep deprivation was stopped when Rahim “described visual and auditory hallucinations.” After Rahim was allowed to sleep for eight hours and the psychologist concluded that Rahim had been faking his symptoms, Rahim was subjected to another 62 hours of sleep deprivation. A third, 13-hour, session was halted due to a limit of 180 hours of sleep deprivation during a 30 day period [Ref. 1, p 165].\n\nThese examples substantiate speculations that psychologists were systematically involved in detainee interrogations. The CIA's response to the summary affirms that hallucinations occurred and disappeared upon sleep: “A review of the cases cited in the Study indicates that short periods of sleep effectively addressed the hallucinations and that the detainees were conscious of the fact that they had hallucinated” (Ref. 7, p 55). Civilian bioethicists have warned that interrogators could be more aggressive if health professionals are present to examine detainees and render them medically fit for further interrogations.13,14 A chart review of nine Guantánamo detainee records has also demonstrated that temporary psychological symptoms such as hallucinations after EITs did not lead psychologists to recommend treatment.15 The executive summary and the CIA response indicate that interrogators acted with psychologists' involvement and that psychologists may have recorded mental health symptoms without recommending treatment aside from sleep.\n\nThe executive summary also shows that health professionals raised unheeded ethics-based warnings. One CIA psychologist wrote to the Office of Medical Services (OMS) objecting that the two psychologist contractors interrogating Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of 9/11, were also entrusted with assessing his “psychological stability” (Ref. 1, p 65). In March 2003, the chief of base detaining Mohammed prohibited the on-site medical officer from reporting on the interrogation to OMS outside of official CIA cables.1 In another case, a draft cable from CIA headquarters that went unsent raised a conflict of interest in 'Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri's interrogation: “We note that [the proposed plan] contains a psychological interrogation assessment by [REDACTED] psychologist [DUNBAR] which is to be carried out by interrogator [DUNBAR]. We have a problem with him conducting both roles simultaneously” (Ref. 1, p 72). The CIA's response denied these allegations: “Early in 2003, Headquarters promulgated guidance on the scope of the contractor psychologists' involvement in individual interrogations. It affirmed that no contractor could issue the psychological assessment of record” (Ref. 7, p 48).\n\nIt remains unclear why some CIA health professionals continued to raise objections about the dual clinical–forensic role of the psychologist contractors if CIA headquarters promulgated such guidance. What is clear is that some health professionals attempted to differentiate clinical responsibilities to detainees from forensic duties to the CIA, challenging any portrayal of the intelligence agency as monolithic in practice. Some observers have suggested a need for more bioethics training among military and intelligence health professionals so that they can better appreciate differences between their clinical and forensic roles.16 The executive summary and the CIA response indicate that the problem seems not to be a lack of such appreciation, but with commanding personnel's prioritizing forensic over clinical responsibilities or problems with the implementation of existing policies.\n\nFor this reason, the Committee's summary should reinvigorate debates on the ethics-based responsibilities of forensic psychologists. By appealing to the Geneva Conventions against torture, civilian bioethicists have demanded that health professionals avoid detainee interrogations, whether planning EITs, sharing clinical information, or examining detainees for further interrogations.14,17,18 Simply stated, their argument is that military bioethics do not differ from civilian bioethics.19 However, military bioethicists have countered that military health professionals, like soldiers, prioritize organizational imperatives to fulfill their mission above all else and that new policies in the War on Terror obfuscate what types of treatment constitute torture.20,21 The executive summary insinuates that CIA headquarters prioritized a mission to conduct interrogations over medical care starting in July 2002,1 a trend that had only been suspected when President Obama declassified EIT guidelines from the CIA's OMS in 2009.22\n\nThe executive summary therefore raises crucial questions for forensic mental health based on changed social and legal circumstances in the War on Terror. First, are the bioethics responsibilities of health professionals to nonstate detainees the same as to state soldiers protected under the Geneva Conventions? Some have argued that medical ethics should not be changed if new policies seem to negate decades of international precedents.23 At the same time, international treaties against torture have addressed medical protections for soldiers of state militaries, and invoking such treaties for detainee bioethics risks irrelevance to real-life practice if military and intelligence agencies can claim that they are not breaking laws.24 For example, CIA psychologists operated under new legal definitions of torture that were created after conscious deliberation among government attorneys. Similarly, even though President Obama's administration has applied the Geneva Conventions to detainees, Army Medical Command has designated health professionals in interrogations as “combatants” and stripped them of clinical privileges.25 The executive summary should therefore invite discussions on the extent to which the inapplicability of medical protections under the Geneva Conventions to detainees was illegal or unethical.\n\nSecond, how should conflicts between core bioethics principles be resolved, when nonmaleficence against individuals conflicts with social justice? The CIA invoked social justice to justify EITs against individual detainees: “The use of more aggressive methods is required to persuade Abu Zubaydah to provide the critical information we need to safeguard the lives of innumerable innocent men, women and children within the United States and abroad” (Ref. 1, p 33). Some may object, believing that the use of aggressive methods does not necessarily guarantee the production of critical information to safeguard innumerable lives. Others can object on the ground that society's ethics standards may be eroded if a precedent is set permitting the use of aggressive methods with certain individuals. Despite such objections, however, justifications such as the CIA's may persist as long as there are no guidelines for reasoning through conflicting bioethics principles or independent mechanisms for adjudication, such as referral to third parties."
