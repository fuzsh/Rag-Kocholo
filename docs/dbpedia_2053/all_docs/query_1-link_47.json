        "text": "Background[]\n\n1975 - 1988: Morgan Ducard[]\n\nMorgan was born to the elusive Henri Ducard & his lover Felicity Strode. While the public was ignorant to the truth, Morgan was well aware of who both his parents were. His father was in fact Ra's al Ghul, a known international terrorist. His mother was also a member of Ra's organization, the League of Shadows. However, Ra's had Felicity raise Morgan in Nice & secretly visited the boy when he could. When Felicity was killed by an assassin trying to protect Morgan, he showed his potential by shooting his mother's killer. His father took him in, having him raised by various handmaidens during the day & assassins at night.\n\n1988 - 1997: La 'Ahad[]\n\nHis father soon became a father figure & trainer to a newcomer by the name of Bruce Wayne, teaching him in combat & crime fighting. Morgan did not let this get to him until his father announced Bruce as his successor. To test Bruce's true potential, Morgan decided to challenge Wayne to a dual. Though he gained the upper hand for a moment, his arrogance got the best of him & Bruce proved his worth when he defeated Morgan.\n\nEmbarrassed by his son's loss, Ra's spent the next several months pairing Bruce with Morgan in the hopes of them working together as an elite killing force. It was clear Morgan resented Bruce for taking what he believed to be his rightful spot as Ra's heir. Bruce eventually parted ways with the Shadows because he didn't share their views on taking a life for the greater good. Morgan attempted to stop Bruce from leaving but fails with Bruce leaving his unconscious body on the compound. From that moment, Ra's looked at his son with great disappointment & cut all ties he had left with his son, leaving him as a shunned \"nobody.\"\n\n1997 - 2018: Nobody[]\n\nNo longer working with the League, Ducard made a name for himself as a professional manhunter. Every organization from the CIA to KGB wanted his services, which also had him gain several enemies including a French Algerian named Jeremiah Hassan. Hassan was a Muslim fundamentalist who had several terrorist cells spread out through Europe but one of his attempts were thwarted by Ducard who had been sent their by his father. Hassan assigns one of his female loyalists to seduce Ducard & kill him when the time is right. The woman, going by Jean, not only becomes acquainted with Ducard but falls in love with him. When the moment presented itself, Jean decides not to kill him. She fakes her death in order to escape Hassan's vengeful retribution & started a whole new life with Ducard & their newborn daughter.\n\nFor the next twelve years, Ducard completed missions for whoever hired him while Jean maintained her position as a nurturing maternal figure. Unfortunately, Hassan learned about Felicity's continued existence & decided to take matters into his own hands. He gave her two options; eliminate Morgan or her daughter will suffer for her failure. Felicity knew that she could not escape Hassan's threat so she decided to go along with the mission. Unfortunately, her daughter overheard her plan to kill her father & stabbed her with a kitchen knife to save him. Morgan walked in after she committed the act. He burned the place down & took Maya with him, training her to become a killer like his father did with him. Together, they became a perfect killing duo across Europe.\n\n2018 - 2019: Nobody[]\n\nYears later, Morgan eventually informs his daughter of his personal vendetta with Batman as his own father admired the man more than him. Eventually, he confronts Bruce, telling him flatly that he plans to seek revenge on him for disgracing him. He makes good on his words one night as Damian sets out to fight crime on his own. He appears after the boy had finished attacking two muggers, critically injuring one of them. He tries to provoke Damian to kill the man, saying he was as good as dead already due to the severity of the beating. Refusing, Morgan kills the man himself before stunning Damian & attempting to kidnap him.\n\nAfter their failed kidnapping attempt, he & Maya set themselves up at an abandoned drive-in then sends a video to Batman with his enemies, commenting on how he refuses to kill them despite knowing that they will simply break out & commit crime once again. Later that night, he & Maya appear at Wayne Manor & convince Damian to abandon his role as Robin & join his way of fighting crime.\n\nThe three of them attack an ambassador visiting Gotham, as he is part of a human trafficking ring & uses his diplomatic immunity to bypass the law. Upon cornering the corrupt man in his office, Morgan giving Damian a gun & telling him to kill the man to prove his commitment. He pulls the trigger but discovers the gun wasn't loaded & it was simply a test. Morgan takes the ambassador back to his base of operations, learning everything about the people behind the trafficking ring. Morgan then begins to lower him into a vat of acid & though Robin attempts to stop him, he is beaten. Robin reveals he's been playing him the whole time, he knew the gun was empty & has been broadcasting everything to Batman. With the knowledge that Batman is listening, Morgan begins to slowly torture Damian, going in detail about everything he does to the boy.\n\nAfter the immense torture, Morgan informs Bruce that he is going to kill Damian right when the Batmobile comes crashing through the wall. Batman & Nobody violently attack each other, the former gaining the upper hand & dunking Morgan's head into the vat of acid, only stopping himself after remembering Damian's presence. Though beaten, he continues to taunt the two, saying he will eventually return to kill them both. Seeing Damian's look of rage, he taunts him, trying to convince him to finish what his father had started. Unable to control himself any longer, Damian kills him with a strike between the eyes.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMissing data.\n\nRomantic Relationships[]\n\nJean Nordan: Lover (2003 - 2004); Wife (2004 - 2012)\n\nPowers & Abilities[]\n\nHand to Hand Combat: Morgan is well trained in hand to hand combat by his father though not on the level of Batman himself, as he was defeated by him on two occasions.
