Talking in PTV’s live programme “Prime Minister Online”, Gilani said that drone technology should be transferred to Pakistan and the US should reconsider its position on use of drones. As a civilised and responsible country, Pakistan is using all the diplomatic channels to put across its viewpoint and there is realisation that drone attacks were creating a negative impact, he added. Gilani said drone attacks started during the government of Pervez Musharraf, after permission was given for surveillance. But subsequently the Americans got intelligence and they carried out drone attacks, he added.

A three-judge bench, comprising Justice Javed Iqbal, Justice Khilji Arif Hussain and Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali, was hearing the missing persons’ case. During May 2’s hearing, Jahangir appeared before the court on behalf of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and stated that according to her information, a plan to amend the Anti-Terrorist Act to try terrorists in military courts was being considered. She asserted that such a recommendation had been given by three retired judges. Justice Javed Iqbal later said that the apex court did not interfere in the Government’s affairs and added that the courts had never encouraged mischief mongers, regretting that “criminals were released because Police in most of the cases failed to provide evidence”. He asked the interior minister not to take the directions of the apex court lightly. At the outset of the proceedings, Rehman Malik told the court that Balochistan was a victim of international terrorism. He maintained that first miscreants killed people in Punjab, Hazarwal, Sindh and now they wanted to create a law and order situation in Balochistan.

Bashir also hit out at “disquieting” comments by Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Leon Panetta that US officials had ruled out informing Islamabad in advance about US raid on the Pakistani compound, which led to the al Qaeda chief’s death. Asked in a BBC radio interview about the compound in Abbottabad where the al Qaeda chief was discovered, Bashir said: “This particular location was pointed out by our intelligence quite some time ago to the US intelligence. Of course they have a much more sophisticated equipment to evaluate and to assess. We had indicated this compound as far back as 2009 as a possible place”, Bashir said, although he added it was not known at the time Bin Laden was hiding there and there were “millions” of other suspect locations.

South Florida Congressman Allen West said Government of Pakistan may have aided and abetted Osama bin Laden’s lengthy hideout from US forces. Unless the United States gets a clear explanation of what Pakistani officials knew about bin Laden’s whereabouts, “all aid from American taxpayers to this nation needs to cease,” West wrote in a letter to congressional leaders. “It is not unreasonable for the American people to question if Osama bin Laden was located on Government-controlled land, next to a military academy and so close the nation’s capital. What real assistance was the Pakistan Government providing for the last 10 years to locate the al Qaida leader and bring him to justice?” He suggested the possibility that Pakistan helped Osama bin Laden elude capture to keep USD 20 billion of aid flowing since the 9/11 attacks. “We need to understand whether the government of Pakistan was harbouring Osama bin Laden all these years,” Allen West wrote.

But he cautioned that the death of the terrorist mastermind “underlines the need for a broad and reinforced engagement of Pakistan generally, but also on security-related issues such as counter terrorism and human rights.” Read less...\n\nMay - 5&nbsp\n\nPakistan warned the United States on May 5 of “disastrous consequences” if it carries out any more raids against terrorists like the one that killed Osama bin Laden, and hit back at international allegations it may have been harbouring the al Qaeda ‘ Read more...\n\nPakistan warned the United States on May 5 of “disastrous consequences” if it carries out any more raids against terrorists like the one that killed Osama bin Laden, and hit back at international allegations it may have been harbouring the al Qaeda ‘chief’, reports Daily Times. Briefing media personalities at the Foreign Office about different aspects and questions regarding the US operation in Abbottabad, Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir said that Pakistan’s military and political leadership was well-equipped and mindful of the defence requirements of the country. Salman Bashir said the US action, which led to the killing of Osama bin Laden, was a covert operation and Pakistan armed forces were not consulted. He said that Admiral Mike Mullen had telephoned Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3am and informed him about the operation. Bashir pointed out that the American action involved legal issues concerning violation of sovereignty and these should be addressed for the sake of global peace and stability. Even Americans were mindful of the sovereignty issue and Admiral Mullen, among other things, also raised this issue during the conversation with the Army Chief, he added. The secretary recalled that the UN Security Council had emphasised that “member states must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law and in particular human rights, refugee and humanitarian law”.

The only other two explanations are incompetence and overconfidence of our security services,” he added.

The directives for a broad-based military inquiry were given at a corps commanders conference at the GHQ as the Army decided on an immediate reduction in the US military presence in the country in protest against the ‘unilateral American operation’ in which the fugitive al Qaeda ‘chief’ with $25 million bounty on his head was killed.

Toner said he is aware of all those terrorism related cases in India including the attack on the Indian Parliament and the Mumbai terrorist attack. \"Our counterterrorism cooperation both with India and with Pakistan is ongoing and we believe that it's directed at exactly these kinds of elements,\" he added.

It reported that the top two al Qaeda men had differences and that a courier who led US forces to Bin Laden was working for Zawahiri. The courier was a Pakistan national and not a Kuwaiti as the US suspected. The man knew he was being followed by the US military but disguised the fact. “The Egyptian faction of al Qaeda is de facto running the organisation now and since he was taken ill in 2004 they have been trying to take full control,” according to sources. It said Zawahiri’s faction had persuaded Osama bin Laden to leave Tribal Areas along the Afghan-Pakistan border and take shelter instead in Abbottabad District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. With the return of an Egyptian figure in al Qaeda, Saif al Adel, the Egyptian faction hatched a plan to dispose of Osama bin Laden.

Saleh, who has long been a hate figure in Islamabad among officials who believed he was implacably anti-Pakistan also said that he had no doubts “that Mullah Omar, the Taliban leader, was hiding in a safe house owned by the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) in Karachi”, adding, “He is protected by ISI, General Ahmad Shuja Pasha knows as I am talking to you where is Mullah Omar and he keeps daily briefs from his officers about the location of senior Taliban leaders, simple”.

Reacting to the military operation conducted deep inside the country’s territory by a US team of Navy Seals, the Prime Minister said that the issue of violation of its sovereignty was a matter of concern for Pakistan. He said that it was particularly so, in view of the cooperation with the United States in the fields of intelligence and defence. “Pakistan’s sovereignty should not have been violated.

The senior officials said \"they recognise that an important head has to roll and soon\" to allay domestic and international anger over bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, located close to the federal capital of Islamabad, adding, “The most likely candidate to be the fall guy is General Ahmed Shuja Pasha.

The statement promised that the US and those who lived in the country “will never enjoy security until our people in Palestine enjoy it”. The statement specified the location of Bin Laden’s death and those responsible, and so is likely end to fringe conspiracy theories that were beginning to form about his demise, while it directly threatened Pakistan’s leaders. “We call upon the Muslims of Pakistan, on whose land Osama was killed, to rise up and revolt to cleanse this shame that has been attached to them by a clique of traitors and thieves who sold everything to the enemies,” the statement made by al Qaeda added.

The differences had been simmering between their two clans since the former head of the lashkar, Haji Abdul Malik, was killed in a suicide attack in 2009. Both the top leaders of the anti-TTP body had developed differences over raids and arrest of people in different areas.

The agreement was finalised between then military ruler Pervez Musharraf and US President George W. Bush after Osama bin Laden eluded capture in Afghanistan’s Tora Bora mountains, the newspaper said, citing serving and retired Pakistani and US officials. Under the terms of the agreement, Pakistan would allow US troops to conduct a raid inside Pakistan in search of Bin Laden, his second in command Ayman al Zawahiri, and the group’s third-ranking official. Both sides also agreed that Islamabad would vociferously protest the incursion afterwards in keeping with public sensitivities. The newspaper quoted a former senior US official as saying that “there was an agreement between Bush and Musharraf that if we knew where Osama was, we were going to come and get him.” “The Pakistanis would put up a hue and cry, but they wouldn’t stop us,” the official told the Guardian. A senior Pakistani official said it had been struck under Musharraf and renewed by the army during the “transition to democracy” – a six-month period from February 2008 when Musharraf was still president but a civilian government had been elected. The former US official said the Pakistani protests of the past week were the “public face” of the deal, adding, “We knew they would deny this stuff.” Read less...\n\nMay - 9&nbsp\n\nPrime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on May 9 asserted in Parliament “the war against terrorism is our own national priority'' and described the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) as a “national asset'' which has full support of the Government, accor Read more...\n\nPrime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on May 9 asserted in Parliament “the war against terrorism is our own national priority'' and described the Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) as a “national asset'' which has full support of the Government, according to The Hindu. “Indeed, the ISI is a national asset and has the full support of the government. We are proud of its considerable accomplishments,” he added, according to Daily Times. The premier also mentioned that some 40 key al Qaeda operatives, including Faraj al-Libbi and Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, were arrested by the ISI, and stressed, “No other country in the world and no other security agency has done so much to interdict al Qaeda than our spy agency and armed forces.” He also dispelled the allegations of complicity and incompetence on the country’s security agencies, saying the ISI prosecuted the anti-terror strategy with a high degree of professionalism and superb determination. “Allegations of complicity or incompetence are absurd. We emphatically reject such accusations,” said the Prime Minister. He "
