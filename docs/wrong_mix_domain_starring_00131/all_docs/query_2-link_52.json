        "text": "Smith will appear on Jan. 26 at Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa in Rancho Mirage.\n\nKevin Smith has an interesting way of describing his filmmaking career: “Good enough.”\n\nDuring a recent interview, the indie-film director, producer and writer of films such as “Clerks,” “Mallrats,” and “Chasing Amy” said he doesn't predict he'll ever be nominated for or win an Academy Award, or make anything equal to director Christopher Nolan's latest film “Oppenheimer.\"\n\n“You don’t get to ‘Oppenheimer’ by being good enough, that’s demanding excellence and I never developed that gene. ‘Good enough’ was always what got me to the finish line,” Smith said. “If you’re an independent filmmaker and holding out for excellence, you’re never going to finish the flick. You have to settle for good enough. ‘Clerks’ was a movie that was good enough. ‘Does the scene work? Good enough, let’s move on.’ That’s the only way you make your budget and your (scheduled) days.”\n\nGood enough has clearly worked in Smith's favor. He's extended himself to writing comic books, podcasts and speaking to live audiences.\n\nOn Jan. 26, Smith will appear on stage at Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa in Rancho Mirage.\n\n“I make more money standing on stage talking about being Kevin Smith than I do as a director,” Smith said. “My mouth has become more valuable than my most valuable commodity, but it doesn’t mean I don’t get to direct films. Directing isn’t the only way I pay my bills, thank God, and that’s given me freedom to pivot to other things until people say, ‘Yeah, we’ll f--king pay for him to direct something again.’”\n\n'Clerks' was made on a $27,000 budget\n\nThe 1994 comedy realism film \"Clerks,\" which is based off Smith's experiences working in a convenience store, launched Smith's career, but making it was an act of guerilla filmmaking before the digital age when indie filmmakers had to raise thousands of dollars to make a \"low budget\" film. It was shot in black & white over 21 days on a budget of $27,000 at the same New Jersey convenience store where Smith worked during the night hours (as well as at the video store next door).\n\nThe story observes a day in the life of convenience store clerk Dante (Brian O'Halloran) and the neighboring video store employee Randall (Jeff Anderson). Meanwhile, two entertaining drug dealers — Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Smith) — do business outside the store, annoying Dante and Randall with their antics. Smith said \"Dante was definitely me,\" but imagined himself playing Randall.\n\nEven though “Clerks” launched Smith’s career, he cringes when he watches or reads the press he did. He believes he came off as pretentious with \"no understanding of comedy.\"\n\n“I can’t stand watching old videos of me from 1994, it makes me think, ‘This motherf--ker is all about being an artist. He doesn’t realize how fortunate he is. He just entered a world where they’re going to pay him to make pretend for the rest of his life. Smile, you f--king idiot!’”\n\n'Clerks III' reflects his maturity and mortality\n\nWhile writing the “Clerks” films, Smith has used the character of Dante as a vehicle for himself. The 2006 sequel featured a storyline where Dante gets married, has a child and accepts more grown-up responsibilities. Before releasing \"Clerks III\" in 2022, Smith said it would be the final film of the series. It's also a departure from the previous films. Smith not only based the film on his own brush with death as a result of a heart attack in 2018, but poured more of himself into Randall.\n\n“Randall decided he wanted to make a movie about working in the convenience store instead of Dante, and I think that had more to do with when I began my career. The deeper I went into my career, I identified more with the dreamer, not the practical guy who is responsible and goes to work when he’s supposed to.”\n\nWhile writing \"Clerks III,\" Smith knew he couldn't get away with just profanity, sex jokes and drug references. He also wanted the characters to show they \"have a heart.\"\n\n\"None of us are getting younger, and having seen my own mortality and getting close, I wanted to remind folks that whatever you're doing, if you have dreams and say 'I'll get to them eventually,' start getting to them ASAP. You don't know when the bill comes due. That felt like something no one was expecting from 'Clerks III.' \"But this was taking away a lonestar of Generation X and 1990s pop culture with Dante,\" Smith said.\n\nHe directed a 'Bennifer' film in 2004\n\nEven though many of his films enjoy a cult following, Smith has directed some box-office bombs. One noteworthy effort was the 2004 film \"Jersey Girl,\" which featured Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez during their first courtship, known as \"Bennifer.\" The film was panned by critics, but took in $36 million against its $35 million budget. Smith said it was a better performance than Martin Brest’s 2003 romantic comedy “Gigli,” which also featured Affleck and Lopez and only earned $7 million against its $75 million budget.\n\n“My home video (sales) were always so strong back then, so it wasn’t like (‘Jersey Girl’) put me in movie jail,” Smith said.\n\nHis professional relationship with The Weinstein Company and Miramax Films eroded due to the dismal reception of the 2008 comedy \"Zack & Miri Make a Porno\" starring Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks. The failure has been blamed on its Halloween release date and marketing a film with the word \"porno.\"\n\n“I beat myself up harder over that one than anybody else ever did,” Smith said. “Halloween is the worst time to put out a movie, if that had changed, maybe we could have made $40 million instead of $30 million. It also had ‘porno’ in the title and a lot of places couldn’t advertise the showings until 10 p.m. A lot of theaters didn’t carry it, especially in Utah, because it had ‘porno’ in the title,” Smith said.\n\nHe started his own distribution and production company in 2011\n\nSmith has continued to direct films such as “Red State,” “Tusk” and “Yoga Hosers.” He’s taken a more independent approach after founding his film distribution and production company, SModcast Pictures, in 2011.\n\n“I’ve always kind of willed my sh-t into existence, anyway,” Smith said. “I’m not visionary enough for (studios) to be like, ‘Let’s blow our money on this f-cking guy.’ There have been times when these setbacks would have ended another career, but I’ve always been able to readjust afterward. If something didn’t do well, great, I’ll ask for nothing to do the next movie, or I’ll co-finance it.”\n\nIn 2022, Smith become part-owner of his favorite childhood movie theater and renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas. It features a merchandise store, a \"film school camp\" for young filmmakers and special events. He also founded the Smodcastle Film Festival at the venue.\n\n\"We've done two years of the Smodcastle Film Festival now, and it's a blast, because I come from the festival world where it made a difference in my life,\" Smith said.\n\nAs the film business has changed, so have film festivals. During the ‘90s, the Sundance Film Festival was a springboard for independent filmmakers such as Darren Aronofsky, Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson and more. Smith mentioned director Steven Soderbergh and his 1989 film “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” as an example of Sundance’s notoriety. But like many film festivals, there’s less of an emphasis on independents and a shift towards mainstream Hollywood, corporate-sponsored content and luxury lounges.\n\n“Sundance has shifted to become something that is going after a completely different audience than I was accustomed to when I was at film festivals and needed them the most in my career,” Smith said. “I’m appreciative of film festivals launching me, but they don’t seem to matter as much as they did when I was younger and (they) could make or break a film.”\n\n'Be aware of who's driving'\n\nDuring a 2023 interview with People, Smith revealed he checked himself into Arizona's Sierra Tucson treatment center due to childhood traumas and hiding behind a “larger-than-life” persona he created for himself. He’s spent the past year figuring out the different aspects of himself and explained there are “10 different Kevins,” such as the entertainer, the ‘90s version and the public presenter.\n\n“The lesson I got coming out of that place was to be aware of who’s driving. You can hand over the wheel but be aware of who’s driving and make sure you take the wheel back,” Smith said. “The codependent one is ‘I will entertain and make you feel good because that’s my job.’ That’s a people pleaser and a dude who doesn’t know how to say ‘No.’ On stage, that’s my job, but when I get off the stage, I have to be able to switch that off and go back to who I am in real life, the authentic version of me.”\n\nSmith said those who are suffering from mental health-related conditions and talking openly about them have “normalized” it and made it easier for people to discuss.\n\n“There were people like me at 52 who went into Sierra Tucson who were minimizing their feelings of trauma,” Smith said. “My daughter’s generation is all therapy-speak and they understand. I used to think they were a softer generation because they understand by talking about these things, you put them out in the open, shine a light on them and figure out how to deal with them. It’s a very Western philosophy to be like ‘slay that f—cking dragon but Eastern philosophy is more about ‘How do you live with it? How do you accept and make it a part of yourself?’”\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Kevin Smith presents a night of stand-up comedy\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday, Jan. 26\n\nWhere: Agua Caliente Resort Casino Spa, 32-250 Bob Hope Drive, Rancho Mirage\n\nCost: $25 to $125\n\nMore info: aguacalientecasinos.com\n\nDesert Sun reporter Brian Blueskye covers arts and entertainment.
