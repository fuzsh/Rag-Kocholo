        "text": "by Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nEvery time I watch Con Air (dir. Simon West, 1997), I feel a profound sense of gratitude for its existence.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nDie Hard is a movie that knows exactly what it is, and because of that it is able to function as a movie that is truly free.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nSasquatch Sunset is the sort of a movie you see on Netflix, remember how you heard about it when it came out, throw it on for 10 minutes, and then say, \"Welp, glad I didn't pay to see that one in the theater.\"\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nThe Greatest Hits is an intensely middle-of-the-road indie movie that makes a fun premise as one-note as humanly possible.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nI watch Office Space every 5 years or so partly because it gives me that pure late 90s nostalgia hit that I need sometimes, but also because I have more and more context with each subsequent viewing.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nInside the Yellow Cocoon Shell is a film maddeningly trapped between transcendence and utter boredom.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nThese little indie dramas, composed of by-the-numbers shot/reverse shot sequences, put so much focus on the dialogue that it really has to be great. No one has ever talked like the people in this movie, who talk like what a first time screenwriter thinks people talk like.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nRandall Park does a great job with the performances and the storytelling, but does little to visually separate this from the pack which makes me think this movie will end up flying under the radar.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nMulholland Dr exists as a Kubrickian monolith in my life. One day I just had to see that movie, and 20 years later it is the inciting incident to both my love of film and, I’m not even kidding, my chosen career path as a librarian.\n\nRead More\n\nby Iran Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nIt’s Pirates of Silicon Valley vs. Wall Street and it works.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nOne True Loves was the most excruciating movie watching experience I’ve had in recent memory.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nPeople play games for the same reason they watch movies: escapism. And yet Tabletop-to-Big Screen adaptations have been pretty putrid up until very recently.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nI don’t often feel FOMO, but the one time I really feel it is at the end of the year when everyone’s year end lists for movies are dropping and I’m stuck on the sidelines.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nDespite being the sort of film firmly on my Remake No Fly List seeing the “Screenplay by Kazuo Ishiguro” credit quickly turned my “WHY?!” into “I’m listening.”\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nTold exclusively in archive footage with voice overs from the primary players of the scene, Meet Me in the Bathroom doesn’t really have anything interesting to say.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nWelcome to MovieJawn’s first ever Sound & Vision Poll, where our writers share why they love their 10 favorite movies of all time!\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nPerhaps more shocking than Hollywood’s inability to find joy in the Middle Ages is Lena Dunham making a legitimately excellent film\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nIt’s as close as you can get to going to film school without going to film school.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nIn the wake of Clerks III bringing Smith’s canon full circle, let’s take a look back at Smith’s career.\n\nRead More\n\nby Ian Hrabe, Staff Writer\n\nKevin Smith feels like a living affront to the old adage “you can never go home again.”\n\nRead More"
