        "text": "Welcome!\n\nThe Humboldt Film Festival is the oldest surviving student-run film festival in the world.\n\nEach spring, our festival showcases short films from every corner of the globe – the creativity and caliber of which cannot be seen anywhere else. For 43 years the Humboldt Film Festival has fostered the independent spirit, striving to represent a broad spectrum of film styles from whimsical animation to documentaries providing social commentary.\n\nThis year, we invite you to feed your head and treat yourself to a unique array of narrative, documentary, experimental and animated shorts!\n\nOur goal is to make this festival affordable for the community, but we can’t do it without generous support of our sponsors and attendees. Please consider making a donation so that we can continue to celebrate independent filmmaking in Humboldt County and beyond!\n\nDavid Scheerer is an independent filmmaker and professor who has scripted, produced and directed a wide spectrum of films, including narrative features and documentaries. In August of 2006 he moved to the Redwoods from Montana, where he was the Director of the Discovery Channel MFA in Science and Natural History Filmmaking at Montana State University. Professional Film Credits include a dramatic feature, dramatic shorts, and documentary films. His current major work-in-progress is entitles Reality’s Edge. It is the first documentary on Robert J. Flaherty, who in 1920 started the worldwide documentary film movement with his film Nanook of the North."
