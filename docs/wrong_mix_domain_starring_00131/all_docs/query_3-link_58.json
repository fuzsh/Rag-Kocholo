I want to thank the two of them for taking the time to give us an in depth look behind the magic and the mayhem.\n\nStarting with my favorite scene in the film, the LOTR VS Classic Trilogy Debate. How much of it was your own views, and how much of it was written by Kevin?\n\nBrian: I appreciate both but I am a big fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy.\n\nJeff: That was Kevin’s writing. While I am a Star Wars guy, I have no opinion either way on which is better.\n\nHow was it going back to the characters again, and what sort of thoughts did you have when you heard that there was going to be another movie?\n\nBrian: As a working actor, I was all “Yeah, sure!” because I wanted more work and I had faith that Kevin had something that was going to be good.\n\nJeff: I did not want to do it. I thought it was an odd move. The original “Clerks” was such a special film that after “Jersey Girl” and the cartoon series it seemed like going to a different world.\n\nHow much did working on the 10th Anniversary DVD for “Clerks” get the ball rolling for the sequel?\n\nBrian: When doing the DVD we had such a good time especially with the missing funeral scene, we were reminded of the great fun we had doing the original. Kevin got to work on it, an had a script in 30-40 days.\n\nJeff: Kevin really had to talk me off the ledge a few times, over many dinners. I had some cold feet especially during the push time when the film was held up in studio changes because it held up a project I was working on that should come out this year on DVD.\n\nWith the Miramax/Weinstein Split how did that affect the filming and scheduling of “Clerks II”?\n\nBrian: It was delayed about a year and a half because we also had Kevin’s film “Catch and Release” to deal with. He had a part in that and we had to work around their schedule."
