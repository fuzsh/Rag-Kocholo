        "text": "Fernando I (November 27, 1380 – April 2, 1416) was King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and (nominal) Corsica and King of Sicily, Duke (nominal) of Athens and Neopatria, and Count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya (1412–1416). He was also Regent of Castile (1406–1416).\n\nInfante Fernando was born November 27, 1380 in Medina del Campo, the younger son of King Juan I of Castile and Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Pedro IV of Aragon and his wife Eleanor of Sicily, the daughter of Peter II of Sicily and Elisabeth of Carinthia. She was the second of eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood.\n\nOn August 15, 1403 in Medina del Campo, Infante Fernando founded a new order of knighthood, the Order of the Jar.\n\nIn 1406, upon the death of his elder brother, King Enrique III of Castile, Infante Fernando declined the Castilian crown and instead, with Enrique III’s widow Catherine of Lancaster, became coregent during the minority of his nephew King Juan II of Castile. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of domestic affairs.\n\nIn a war with the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, he conquered the town of Antequera (1410), whence his surname.\n\nAfter Fernando’s maternal uncle, King Martin I of Aragon (King Martin II of Sicily), died without surviving legitimate issue, Infante Fernando was chosen King of Aragon in 1412 to succeed him in the Compromise of Caspe. The other candidate, Count James II of Urgell, revolted and King Fernando dissolved the County of Urgell in 1413.\n\nKing Fernando created the title of Prince of Girona for the heir of the Crown of Aragon on February 19, 1416.\n\nThe most notable accomplishment of his brief reign was his agreement in 1416 to depose the Anti-Pope Benedict XIII, thereby helping to end the Western Schism, which had divided the Roman Catholic Church for nearly 40 years.\n\nHe is buried in the Crown of Aragon’s royal pantheon of the monastery of Poblet, in a magnificent tomb ordered by his son Alfonso to Pere Oller in 1417.\n\nFamily and children\n\nIn 1393 Ferdinand married Eleanor of Alburquerque (1374–1435). They had seven children:\n\n1. Alfonso V of Aragon (1396–1458), king of Aragon, Sicily and Naples, married Infanta Maria of Castile\n\n2. Infanta Maria of Aragon, (1403–1445), Queen of Castile, first wife of King Juan II of Castile\n\n3. King Juan II of Aragon (1398–1479)\n\n4. Infante Enrique of Aragon (c. 1400-1445), Duke of Villena, Count of Alburquerque and Empuries, lord of Sogorb, etc. and grand master of the military Order of Santiago, married Infanta Catherine of Castile\n\n5. Infante Sancho of Aragon (c.1400–1416), grand master of the Orders of Calatrava and Alcántara\n\n6. Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, (1402–1445), Queen of Portugal, who married King Duarte I of Portugal\n\n7. Infante Pedro of Aragon (1406–1438), Count of Alburquerque and Duke of Noto\n\nAppearance and character\n\n“He was tall, a little more than average, and thin and ruddy, and his cheeks had a few freckles… very patient to all who wanted to talk to him, even if their speeches were ordinary or not well-reasoned…”\n\nJoan and her husband were together crowned in Pamplona Cathedral on March 5, 1329 as Queen Joan II and King Philippe III of of Navarre.\n\nBoth were raised up on a shield and both threw money during the ceremony. They signed a coronation oath, establishing their royal prerogatives. The charter underlined that Joan was the “true and natural heir” of Navarre, but also declared that “all of the Kingdom of Navarre would obey her consort”.\n\nHowever, the Navarrese also specified that both Joan and Philippe were to renounce the crown as soon as their heir reached twenty-one, or they were obliged to pay a fine of 100,000 livres. Joan also compensated her husband for his expenses connected to the acquisition of Navarre.\n\nReign\n\nJoan II and Philippe III of Navarre closely cooperated during their joint reign. Out of the eighty-five royal decrees preserved from the period of their joint rule, forty-one documents were issued in both names.\n\nHowever, the sources suggest that Philippe was more active in several fields of government, especially legislation. He signed thirty-eight decrees alone, without referring to his wife. Only six documents were issued exclusively in Joan’s name.\n\nAfter the coronation, the royal couple ordered the punishment of the perpetrators of the anti-Jewish riots and the paying of compensation to the victims. The royal fortresses were repaired and a new castle was built at Castelrenault during their reign.\n\nIrrigation system of the arid fields around Tudela was also constructed with the royal couple’s financial support. They also wanted to maintain peaceful relationship with the neighboring states. They opened negotiations about the betrothal of their firstborn daughter, Joan, to Infanta Pedro the heir of Aragon, already in 1329. A peace treaty with Castile was signed at Salamance on 15 March 1330.\n\nJoan and Philippe left Navarre in September 1331. Historian Elena Woodacre notes, the “royal couple had to balance the needs of their French territories alongside the rule of Navarre”, which forced them to split their time between all of their domains.\n\nJoan and Philippe could hardly get accustomed to the “tastes and customs of the Navarrese, and were alien to their language”, according to historian José María Lacarra, for which they were often absent from the kingdom. During the monarchs’ absence, French governors administered Navarre on their behalf.\n\nA border dispute over the ownership of the Monastery of Fitero developed into a war with Castille in 1335. King Pedro IV of Aragon supported the Navarrese and a new peace treaty with Castile was signed on February 28, 1336. Joan and Philippe returned to Navarre in April 1336. Their second visit lasted till October 1337. Philippe twice returned to the realm, but Joan did not accompany him.\n\nKing Philip III of Navarre died in September 1343. She soon replaced Philippe of Melun, who had administered Navarre in the royal couple’s name, with Guillaume of Brahe. Before long, she also dismissed Guillaume of Brahe, replacing him with Jean de Conflans.\n\nThese changes may have reflected a disagreement with Philippe of Melun over administration of Navarre, according to historian Elena Woodacre. In 1344, a copy of the Fueros of Navarre was arranged for the queen in the local Romance language (in ydiomate Navarre), providing a spare column for its translation to the ydioma galicanum (a French variant) eventually left a blank.\n\nFrench was probably the natural language used by Joan, even to deal with matters related with Navarre. Joan established the convent of San Francisco in Olite in 1345.\n\nJoan decided to again visit Navarre, but she never returned, most probably because of the possibility of an invasion of her family’s domains in France during the Hundred Years War.\n\nShe and her husband had supported King Philippe VI of France against King Edward III of England, who claimed the French throne as the son of Joan’s aunt Isabella. By 1346, however, Joan was disappointed by Philippe VI’s failures as military leader.\n\nIn November she boldly concluded a truce with the Earl of Lancaster, granting Edward’s troops free passage through her county of Angoulême in return for protection of her lands. She also promised not to build new fortification or allow Philippe VI’s army to use the existing ones. Philippe VI was unable to take action against her.\n\nQueen Joan II of Navarre died of Black Death on October 6, 1349. In her last will, she requested that her son finance a chapel in Santa Maria of Olite. She was buried in the Basilica of St Denis, though her heart was buried at the now-demolished church of the Couvent des Jacobins in Paris alongside that of her husband’s.\n\nFamily\n\nJoan’s husband, Philip of Évreux, was a grandson of King Philippe III of France. They were efficient as co-rulers but no evidence attests to the closeness of their personal relationship, in contrast to the well-documented marriages of Joan’s grandparents, father and uncles. This indicates that their marriage was marked neither by particular affection nor difficulty. They were very rarely apart, however, and had nine children together.\n\nJoan was succeeded by her eldest surviving son as King Charles II of Navarre (1349–1387), called Charles the Bad, who was Count of Évreux (1343–1387) from the death of his father."
