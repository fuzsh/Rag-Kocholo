Before becoming king, he was known by the title Prince of Asturias, designating him as the heir apparent. After succeeding to the throne at 11, Henry took power at 14. Despite his nickname, he engaged in a vigorous foreign policy and maneuvers during the first few years of the 15th century. He was able to pacify the nobility and restore royal power. During his reign, the Castilian fleet won several victories against the English; Henry sent a naval fleet in 1400 that destroyed Tétouan in North Africa, a pirate base. In 1402, Henry began the colonization of the Canary Islands, sending French explorer Jean de Béthencourt. He deflected a Portuguese invasion with an attack on Bajadoz, finally signing a peace treaty with Juan I of Portugal in 1402. He restarted the conflict against the kingdom of Granada, winning a victory at Collejares, near Ã?beda in 1406. He also sent the envoy Hernán Sánchez de Palazuelos, and later Ruy González de Clavijo, to Timur.\n\nIn 1388, Henry married Katherine of Lancaster (Catalina de Lancaster; 1372--1418), the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Gaunt's second wife, Constance of Castile, who was the elder daughter of Pedro of Castile. This ended a dynastic conflict and solidified the House of Trastamara. Henry and Catherine's son became John II of Castile, who succeeded Henry when he died in Toledo, Catherine acting as Regent of Castile because John II was then underage.\n\nEnrique III, Rey de Castilla y León was born on 4 October 1379. He was the son of Juan I, Rey de Castilla y León and Eleanor de Aragón.1,2 He married Katherine of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Constanza de Castilla, Reina de Castilla, in September 1388 at Church of St. Antolin, Fuentarrabia, Castile, Spain.3 He was also reported to have been married circa 1393. He died on 25 December 1406 at age 27 at Toledo, Spain. Enrique III, Rey de Castilla y León also went by the nick-name of Enrique 'the Sickly'.1 He succeeded to the title of Rey Enrique III de León in 1390.1 He succeeded to the title of Rey Enrique III de Castilla in 1390.2 Children of Enrique III, Rey de Castilla y León and Katherine of Lancaster\n\n* Maria de Castilla b. 1401, d. 14583 * Juan II, Rey de Castilla y León+ b. 6 Mar 1405, d. 21 Jul 14543,1 * Catherine de Castilla b. 1406, d. 14393"
