        "text": "In 1409 Martin I of Sicily died without surviving issue (although he had had one short lived son from each of his two wives). The next year, his father, who had succeeded him as Martin II, King of Sicily, died childless.\n\nOption A) Martin I’s elder son, Pedro Fadrique, was killed by a spear wound to the head during a hunt. confused:. Who takes an infant with them on a hunt?). The boy’s death plunged his mom into such a depression that she gave up the will to live, it seems, dying soon after.\n\nOption B) Martin I’s younger son, Martin, (by his second wife, Blanca I of Navarre), survives whatever killed him at the age of a few months.\n\nOption C) Now there had been a plan – at least according to the venerable Wikipedia – to have Martin I’s illegitimate son, Fadrique, legitimated and crowned king.\n\nIt seems that Yolande of Aragon, Duchesse d’Anjou was on board with this idea, since her mother, the Queen Dowager of Aragon, had formerly offered one of her daughters, Marie .(b.1402), or Yolande (b.1412) for Martin I’s sons while they’d lived, with the intention of seeing a grandchild on the Aragonese throne.\n\nWhat does the survival of the House of Barcelona mean for Mediterranean/European politics?\n\nWell, IDK much about Iberio-Mediterranean politics at the time but I'll bite:\n\nMartin having a surviving son means that Yolande of Aragon and by extension the house of Anjou doesn't inherit the claims to the Four Kingdoms.\n\nWith no Angevin claim to Aragon/Sicily, Giovanna II either names Alfonso of Castile (OTL of Aragon) or the king of Sicily as heir.\n\nOr maybe Ladislao still has a legitimate heiress who marries the young Pedro Fadrique/Martin II(III).\n\nA rough matrimonial TL:\n\nPedro Fadrique survives.\n\nLadislao marries Blanca I of Navarre instead of Marie d'Enghien and has a daughter with her, Blanca II (b.1409).\n\nPedro Fadrique is betrothed to one of Yolande's daughters. However, after Ladislao dies, he goes back on his promise and marries Blanca II instead.\n\nYolande then marries her older daughter to the French king and her second daughter to the younger son of the king of Castile (OTL Fernando I, since his OTL queen will likely be married to his bastard half-brother, Fadrique, instead) or (OTL Juan II) in a double match wherein her elder son, Louis, marries Juan II's sister.\n\nHence we have Barcelona-Naples-Sicily-Aragon-Navarre vs Castile-Anjou. Cue chaos.\n\nNoy likely. France had been a rival of Aragon, and it was hard to forget the wars with France and the Anjous. Not after the wars for Sicily and the French invasion of Catalonia at the end of the XIII century.\n\nEven less if the Crown of Navarre could fell on the Aragonese laps.\n\nNo way at all.\n\nPerhaps the son of Martin I would look for a Castillian princess (like Alfonso V did) or a Portugese one and then they would the care of the Italian issue, that is, Naples.\n\nThe Anjous were a spent force towards the XV century.\n\nNoy likely.

Wiki says that Aragon was under salic law or something, hence why Jaime of Urgell put his claim in, since he was the closest heir after Martin the Elder\n\nTrastamara was chosen because he had a good army backing him, a lot of money to bribe whoever had a price to be bought and the great blessing of a divided opposition.\n\nwould this still exist should Martin I leave a legitimate heir? A divided opposition could still be there, especially if the plan to legitimate, Martin's bastard goes through.\n\nPlus an enemy army is threatening whether they have reason to be or not.\n\nAny opposition to a legitimate heir? Why on earth would they do that?\n\nThat's sheer nonsense.\n\nIf there's a surviving legal son of Marti I of Sicily, Fernando de Trastámara will remain happy making troubles and increasing his power in Castille. He would had no reason to even try to say anything at all.\n\nI meant if Martin's bastard son gets legitimized. True, the Trastamaras themselves are a bastard line, but how might the Aragonese/Sicilian nobility feel about it? Surely some will be pro-Fadrique de Luna, some will be pro-Trastamara and some might even be pro-Angevin. It seems like a civil war looking for a place to happen.\n\nAll the matrimonial wheeling and dealing aside, how might the house of Barcelona do things differently, politically, than the house of Trastamara (OTL)? And would the impact of that be confined to Mediterranean basin? Or would it spread further out? I know it's pretty far from a POD in 1399, but for instance, would we see a TTL version of the Habsburg-Trastamara alliance?\n\nIf there's a surviving legal son of Marti I of Sicily, Fernando de Trastámara will remain happy making troubles and increasing his power in Castille. He would had no reason to even try to say anything at all.\n\nSo he might become a big mover if his brother dies on schedule to try and seize the regency from Katherine of Lancaster? And considering that Fernando was married to his wife out of expediency (she'd apparently originally been intended for his bastard-half-brother, but when he became king and needed a power-base/money it was switched out) where/who might he marry? If he marries at all."
