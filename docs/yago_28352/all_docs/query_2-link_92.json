        "text": "Pedro IV was a king with a complex personality due to the diculties he experienced during his childhood, including physical limitations caused by being born two months premature. He overcame these conditions and, conscious of the pre-eminence of his rank and dignity, not only wrote his own chronicle but also ordered the drafting of ordinances for his house and court. The latter structured the order of ceremony, for example prescribing how and with what elements and actions the coronations of the kingdom of Aragon were to be carried out. This study is focused on the most important aspects concerning the king’s presence, how he describes his participation in all sorts of events, how these events were to be organized, and how they are corroborated by his iconography. In accordance with the general theme of this volume, special attention has been paid to his physical appearance, that is, his clothing and insignia, as well as to his environment, for example the stages and settings for the events in which he was involved, along with their architecture, furniture, and accessories. Through such means, Pedro IV was able to demonstrate in the eyes of his subjects the political theology he personified. Its visual manifestation during his reign marks a milestone in the saga of the kings of Aragon.\n\nThe reign of the king of the Crown of Aragón, Jaime II, is one of the most politically and artistically interesting in the medieval Iberian Peninsula. Scholars in recent years have highlighted the way he used art as a tool of power, but there still remains a lot to be clarified, in particular the profound meaning of some of his commissions and their relevance beyond his own generation, the relevance of his kingship in Sicily to his visual culture before becoming king of Aragon, the reasons why there was a real aesthetic change during his kingship, the role of queens -if there were any- in this change, or the important relations between politic events and his promotion of the arts. Jaime II constructed his outward appearance and communicated it by means of a variety of rituals, object-types and media, as some of his predecessors did, and he used art to make visible a concise image of power and authority. As will explain, he was not merely the result of an existing trend: Jaime II marked a milestone in the use of art for propaganda purposes and, as history states, he was the rightful inspirer of some of his successors’ commissions, among others Pedro IV the Ceremonious (1337-1386). Roughly speaking, there are just under 70 effigies: 34 from illuminated manuscripts, 3 sculptures, 14 seal variants; and 15 different typologies of coin. Of course, the effigies belonging to seals and coins can be reduced in number: only 10 seals present any novelties, and just 2 coins are attractive from an iconographic point of view. However, this reduced number of pieces is still far from dissapointing: there are more than enough to analyse how he wanted to be portrayed in medieval society, in particular through those objects that had a high legal value and that must be understood as acting as a surrogate for the king’s physical presence. The same happens with sculpture: we have very few effigies, but they constitute a clear manifestation of power with a deep meaning that extended far beyond his own lifetime. Those depictions are directly associated with the king’s patronage, into contrast to most of the representations that we find of him in manuscripts, so it is interesting to study why this is and for what ends and uses we have his portrait -in a broad sense of the term- in their folios. To carry out this study, I will leave to one side the large bibliography published about the king, and will instead focus on other written sources such as documents issued by the king, the royal chancellery and chronicles, including three of The Four Great Chronicles. All these references and others such as the Descendentia dominorum regum Siciliae can be used to discuss the image of the king and in what forms, where, when and for what reasons his image was used by himself or by other institutions in the Medieval Crown of Aragon.\n\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the coronation ceremonies carried out in the Crown of Aragon throughout the Middle Ages. Although the pope granted most Western monarchies the right to hold these ceremonies in their own kingdoms in 1204, our study will address the mechanisms used to appoint kings both before and after the consolidation of these ceremonies, mechanisms which reflected the power struggles between the parties involved, that is, the prince and the Church. We will examine the elements that remained constant throughout this period but we will also pay particular attention to the alterations that were made and how these had important consequences that went beyond politics and entered religious terrain. Among the changes were the kings' e↵orts to participate in priestly orders, the promotion and consolidation of new liturgy with content intended to legitimize the kings, and the use of new iconographies with sacred references. As will be seen, these are only a small example of the mechanisms used by the sovereigns of the Crown of Aragon to re-emphasize their links with God, which had been weakened by the transformations to the anointing and coronation ceremonials and the resulting tensions with Rome, particularly during the times of Peter IV (1336-1387)."
