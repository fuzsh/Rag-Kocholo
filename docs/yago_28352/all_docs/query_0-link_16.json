        "text": "Peter II (born 1174â€”died Sept. 12, 1213, Muret, Fr.) was the king of Aragon from 1196 to 1213, the eldest son and successor of Alfonso II.\n\nPeter married (1204) Mary, lady of Montpellier, and thus greatly extended Aragonese power in southern France. Despite the violent objections of his subjects, he had himself crowned by Pope Innocent III in Rome and declared his kingdom a feudatory of the Holy See (1204). Peter, with other Spanish kings, took a prominent part in the victory over the Moors at Las Navas de Tolosa (July 16, 1212); but he then went to support his brother-in-law Raymond VI of Toulouse against the crusader Simon de Montfort in Languedoc. There he was killed in the Battle of Muret. His son James I succeeded him."
