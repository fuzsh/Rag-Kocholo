The Akhbar al-Majmua [Collection of Anecdotes, translated into Spanish in the mid-19th century by Lafuente as \"Ajbar Machmua\", dated to [940] by Chalmeta , although Lafuente dates it to the 11th century] records that \"Okba ben Al-Hachaeh\" [Uqba bin al-Hajaj al-Saluli, governor of Muslim Spain from [728]], conquered territory as far as Narbonne and subjugated Galicia, Álava and Pamplona . It is not clear how extensively Pamplona was conquered at that time. Muslim influence in the area increased after the capture of Pamplona by Emir Abd al-Rahman I in 781 . The Royal Frankish Annals record that in Spain, the people of Navarre and Pamplona, who had defected to the Saracens during the last years, were again placed under our authority in 806 . As noted in Chapter 1.A below, a lord of Pamplona named Velasco Velásquez is recorded in an Arab source in 816. Presumably he was a Carolingian appointee, although his name indicates Iberian rather than Frankish origin. Records suggest that some form of organised Navarrese state first emerged in the early 9th century, under the leadership of Íñigo \"Arista\" whose death is dated to [851/52] in an Arab source. It is not known whether Íñigo was a descendant of immigrants from the Visigothic court or was a local chief who imposed his leadership over time. Various references to Gascony in the early sources suggest that a Visigothic origin is unlikely. The Royal Frankish Annals record that counts Aeblus and Asinarius had been sent to Pamplona with Basque forces in 824 , which suggests a Carolingian Frankish attempt to reassert suzerainty in Pamplona and that Iñigo had not been a Carolingian nominee. Whatever the truth of Íñigo´s origin, it is probable that his territorial authority was limited and that 9th century Navarre was not a fully-fledged state in the modern sense of the term. It is not even clear that the title \"king\" was adopted by the early leaders. It may have been attributed to them by later chroniclers to add credibility to the dynasty's authority. The number of marriages with Muslim families in the early Navarre royal family suggest that Muslim influence persisted even after Pamplona had long been under Christian rule, at least until the early 10th century. The Iñiga dynasty led Navarre until 905 (see Chapter 1.B). However, their position was challenged by García Jiménez who was accepted as ruler in Pamplona from [858] to [885], García's descendants emerging definitively to lead Navarre from 905 until they were replaced by the kings of Aragon in 1076 (see Chapter 1.C).\n\nFew records have survived which deal with the early history of Navarre. The reconstruction of the early generations of the ruling families is based almost exclusively on the Codex de Roda , a series of texts probably written shortly before 992 almost certainly in Navarre itself. The Codex does not resolve the question of a possible common origin of the two rival dynasties, the Iñiga and the Jimena, which are dealt with in two different chapters in the Codex. The description of the Iñiga dynasty in the Codex starts with Íñigo \"Arista\" and his children. The chapter which follows deals with the Jimena dynasty, stating that García Jiménez and Íñigo Jiménez were brothers without mentioning their father. There appear to be four possible explanations concerning the possible relationship between the two families, based on this text:\n\n1. \"Íñigo Jiménez\" named in the second part was the same person as \"Íñigo \"Arista\"\" named in the first. This is certainly the most obvious explanation. No further details are given in the second part concerning Íñigo Jiménez or his descendants, and the reader of the Codex is left wondering why he would have been mentioned at all if a reference back to the first part was not intended. However, there is an obvious chronological difficulty with this interpretation. García Jiménez succeeded as ruler of Pamplona in [858]. A glance at the chronology of the early generations of the Jimena dynasty in Chapter 1.C shows that García was probably of a similar age to Íñigo \"Arista\"'s grandchildren, and so evidently could not have been Íñigo \"Arista\"'s brother. In addition, as shown below in Chapter 1.A, Arab sources which name Íñigo \"Arista\" specify that his father was Íñigo not Jimeno, although this is contradicted by a (dubious) charter of the monastery of Leire which does call him \"Enneco rex, filius Simeonis\".\n\n2. \"Jimeno\", father of the brothers García and Íñigo Jiménez (whose name is indicated only by the patronymic accorded to his sons), was the son of Íñigo \"Arista\". This satisfies the chronological difficulty mentioned above in relation to the first explanation. However, why would the authors of the Codex omit any reference to such an obvious relationship? As the text was written just over eighty years after the extinction of the Iñiga dynasty, the authors of the Codex would have been well aware of the family connection if such a close one had existed. This, of course, assumes that the text of the Codex which has survived represents the complete version.\n\n3. The García and Íñigo Jiménez who are named in the second part of the Codex were in fact the common ancestors of both Íñigo \"Arista\" and the García Jiménez who ruled Pamplona from [858]. This more complex \"reinterpretation\" of the text of the Codex was first proposed in the 17th century and has since found favour with many historians. It assumes that the Codex simply omits all details of the intervening generations between the two individuals allegedly named García Jiménez, and that it conflates the two into one by mistake in the first paragraph of the second chapter. The possibility of such a mistake cannot of course be excluded. However, this would be the only example in the early genealogies recounted in the Codex where several generations of a family have been omitted entirely.\n\n4. The two dynasties were related only indirectly by marriage or were not related at all. This requires us to believe that the mention of Íñigo Jiménez in the second part of the Codex is completely unrelated to Íñigo \"Arista\" in the first part. The genealogical section of the Codex is grouped into six parts, each dealing with a distinct family. Apart from the Navarrese dynasties, these are the counts of Aragon, Pallars, Gascony and Toulouse, none of whom is recorded as related to the others in the male line. One possibility, therefore, is that the author of the Codex purposely separated his description of the two Navarrese dynasties, in the same way as his narrative concerning the other comital families, because they too were unrelated. Our knowledge of the early history of Navarre is limited, but it is not impossible that these so-called \"kings\" were little more than local leaders who commanded allegiance in very restricted geographic areas and that several such unrelated chiefs emerged in different parts of the territory at the same time, the extent of their authority over the others fluctuating over time.\n\nFurther information concerning the early kings of Navarre is provided by the late 11th century Libro de Regla of Leire monastery and by the Arab historian Ibn Hayyàn . The Libro de Regla is an extremely confused document. The dates which it includes cannot be accurate. In any case, it is not possible to reconcile the names of the early kings which it records with other primary sources. Worst of all, it clearly omits generations in its narrative of the 11th century Navarrese kings. Ibn Hayyân provides a completely different perspective, suggesting that the father of Íñigo \"Arista\" was also named Íñigo. There is no way of knowing whether this is simply a mistake in the source or whether Ibn Hayyân provides the correct answer to the conundrum.\n\nWe are left therefore with two contradictory versions of the parentage of Íñigo \"Arista\". These are both shown in Part A of Chapter 1 of this document. Discussion of such problems is interesting. However, at this distance in time, our knowledge of the families in question is so limited that it does not appear worthwhile to speculate with any degree of certainty about which hypothesis should be preferred over the other. It should not be forgotten that the reconstruction of the early generations may even be entirely fictitious, created by later authors to demonstrate dynastic continuity and enhance the reputation of their rulers.\n\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, the kingdom of Navarre acquired extensive territorial power, including over the counties of Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya to the west, and the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza to the east, as well as in the Navarrese heartland around Pamplona and Calahorra. The boundary agreed with the newly emerged county of Castile to the south is recorded in a charter dated 1016 . Sancho III King of Navarre incorporated the county of Castile into his kingdom, after his brother-in-law García Sánchez Conde de Castilla was murdered in 1029, and captured most of the kingdom of León by 1034. King Sancho divided his territories between his sons, his eldest son García succeeding as king of Navarre, his second son Gonzalo in Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, his third son Fernando in Castile, and his illegitimate son Ramiro in Aragon. Rivalry between the brothers came to a head when García was killed in battle against Fernando at Atapuerca in 1054, leaving his minor son Sancho IV to inherit the Navarrese crown. Sancho was murdered by one of his brothers in 1076. Immediately afterwards, Alfonso VI King of Castile assumed the crown of Navarre: a charter dated 1076 records that Alfonso VI King of Castile (\"Adefonsus filius Fredinandi regis\") succeeded to the kingdom after \"impiisima fraude interfecto rege Sancio, Garsie...regis filius\" . Shortly afterwards, his cousin Sancho I King of Aragon succeeded in taking control of Navarre. At this time the western counties of Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya switched their allegiance to Alfonso VI King of Castile, who also took possession of Nájera and Calahorra. The Aragonese/Navarrese union collapsed on the death in 1134 of Alfonso I King of Aragon and Navarre, Navarre regaining its independence under King García V, grandson of the illegitimate brother of King Sancho IV, although he was obliged to swear allegiance to Alfonso VII King of Castile as the price for his throne.\n\nChapter 1. KINGS of PAMPLONA\n\nA. EARLY SEÑORES de PAMPLONA\n\n1.VELASCO Velásquez, son of VELASCO --- & his wife --- (-after 816) . Señor [King?] de Pamplona. The date Velasco took control of Pamplona is not known. No doubt it was after 806 when the Royal Frankish Annals record that in Spain, the people of Navarre and Pamplona, who had defected to the Saracens during the last years, were again placed under our authority in 806 . It is possible that he was a vassal of the Carolingian Frankish kings. Ibn Hayyan records a campaign in 816 led by [el] hayib Abd al-Karim ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Mugit against Balask al-Yalasqi señor de Pamplona, during the course of which Garsiya ibn Lubb, hijo de la hermana de Barmud, el tío materno de Idfuns, Sanyo, el mejor caballero de Pamplona, Saltan, el mejor caballero de los Mayus were killed . Settipani speculates that Velasco chef de Pampelune en 816 was the brother of García Galíndez el Malo Conde de Aragón . However, the chronology is not ideal. In addition, Balask al-Yalasqi presumably indicates Velasco Velásquez rather then Velasco Galíndez. If Velasco Señor de Pamplona belonged to the same family as García Galíndez, it is therefore more probable that he was García´s paternal uncle.\n\nB. ORIGINS of KINGS of PAMPLONA\n\nAs a preliminary point, a charter dated Aug 828 should be highlighted. This apparently refers to García Jiménez King of Pamplona at that date. At first sight, the dating appears consistent with other individuals who are named in the document, as discussed further below. However, no other reference has been found to King García Jiménez at that time. It is suggested that the document should be redated to the 860s and that it in fact refers to García Jiménez (who succeeded as king in [858]) and to Galindo Aznárez Conde de Aragón (whose death is dated to [after 867] - see the document ARAGON KINGS, Chapter 1). This suggestion is supported by the dating clause of the document which refers only to local Navarrese/Aragonese noblemen, whereas other early charters linked to Aragon (dated to the late 820s to the 860s) refer to the regnal years of the Carolingian kings/emperors .\n\n1. [GARCÍA Jiménez (-[after Aug 828]). King of Pamplona. Garsias Semenonis rex Pampilonensium...cum comite Galindone de Aragon donated monasteriolum Sancti Martini de Ciella cum villa sua de Ciella to San Juan de la Peña by charter dated Aug 828, the dating clause of which records Oriol in Boltana, senior Mancius de Eril in Petra fita... . This charter represents the only reference which has been found to a king named García Jiménez in the early 9th century. The dating of the document is consistent with comite Galindone de Aragon being identified as Conde Galindo García who is named in two other sources around the same period. It is also consistent with senior Mancius de Eril in Petra fita being the father of Blasco Mancio who is named in a charter of Siresa dated to [850] . However, as noted in the introduction to this section above, other factors suggest that the charter should be redated to the 860s which, if correct, would indicate that it refers to Garcia Jiménez who succeeded as king of Pamplona in [858] (see below). In this connection, a charter dated 858 for San Martín de Cillas should be noted as its dating clause is similar, recording \"sub regimine Garssia Scemenonis rege in Pampilona et comite Galindo in Aragone\" .]\n\nThe sources provide two contradictory versions of the parentage of King Íñigo \"Arista\":\n\nVERSION A:\n\n1. [ÍÑIGO [I] [Sancho] . The Arab historian Ibn Hayyân indicates that King Íñigo´s father was also named Íñigo: he records the death in the Muslim year 237 (5 Jul 851/22 Jun 852 A.D.) of \"Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo frère uterin et allié de Musa ibn Musa\" and the accession of \"son fils Garsiya comme émir de Pampelune\" . However, the source is rather confused as in other passages it names \"Musa et son allié Garsiya ibn Wannaqo, emir des Gascons (d'autres disent que son allié était Furtun ibn Wannaqo, son frère uterin)\" and records that \"Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi fut aidé par son frère utérin, le chef de Pampelune, ibn Wannaqo\" . Another possible parentage of Iñigo is suggested by Ibn Hazm who records that \"Musa ibn Musa\" arranged the marriages of \"las hijas de su hermano Lubb ibn Musa\" with \"los hijos de Wanaqo ibn Sanyo, rey de los Vascos\" . The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records the death \"era DCCV\" of \"rex Enneco Garseanes\", adding that his wife was \"Eximena\" . This source, however, is even more confused than Ibn Hayyân and is contradicted by numerous other primary sources in many of the details which it records. It is therefore not certain to whom \"Enneco Garseanes\" refers. m (after 788) as her second husband, ---, widow of MUSA ibn Fortún, head of the Banu Qasi family, daughter of ---. Her two marriages are indicated by Al-Udri who names \"Yannaqo ibn Wanniqo\" as \"hermano de madre de Musa ibn Musa\" . Her two marriages are also indicated by the Arab historian Ibn Hayyân who names \"Musa et son allié Garsiya ibn Wannaqo, emir des Gascons (d'autres dissent que son allié était Furtun ibn Wannaqo, son frère uterin)\" and records in a later passage that \"Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi fut aidé par son frère utérin, le chef de Pampelune, ibn Wannaqo\" . Settipani highlights the lively academic debate over whether Musa was the first or second husband of the wife of Íñigo. [The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records the death \"era DCCV\" of \"rex Enneco Garseanes\", adding that his wife was \"Eximena\" . This source is confused and contradicted by numerous other primary sources in many of the details which it records. It is not certain to whom \"Enneco Garseanes\" refers.

His parentage is also confirmed by the Arab historian Ibn Hayyân who records the death in the Muslim year 237 (5 Jul 851/22 Jun 852 A.D.) of \"Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo frère uterin et allié de Musa ibn Musa\" and the accession of \"son fils Garsiya comme émir de Pampelune\" . However, other sources suggest that the king who reigned in Navarre at that time was the son of \"Jimeno\" (see below). He established himself in [820/25] as ÍÑIGO Iñíguez \"Arista\" [King] of Pamplona, although it should be noted that none of the early texts attribute the title king to him.]\n\n- see Part B. KINGS of PAMPLONA, IÑIGA DYNASTY.\n\nb) [FORTÚN Iñíguez de Pamplona (-killed in battle Pamplona Jul 843) . The Arab historian Ibn Hayyân names \"Musa et son allié Garsiya ibn Wannaqo, emir des Gascons (d'autres disent que son allié était Furtun ibn Wannaqo, son frère uterin)\" and records in a later passage that \"Musa ibn Musa al-Qasawi fut aidé par son frère utérin, le chef de Pampelune, ibn Wannaqo\" .] [m ---, daughter of LUBB ibn Musa.

No other reference to these possible marriages has been found. If they are correct, the chronology suggests that the bridegrooms must have been the sons of Íñigo [I], although it is not known whether they were Ínigo Iñíguez and Fortún Iñíguez or other otherwise unrecorded sons.]\n\nVERSION B:\n\n1. [JIMENO --- (-[after 851]). His name is indicated only by the patronymic accorded to his sons in the Codex de Roda. No direct information has been found relating to Jimeno. However, the Chronicon Fontanellensis records that ambassadors from \"Induonis et Mitionis Ducum Naverrorum\" attended Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks \"in Vermeria Palatio\" with gifts and agreed peace, dated to 851 . A footnote in the edition consulted notes that Marca, in his Historiæ Bearniæ, corrects the apparent reference to two individuals in this edition to \"Inniconis Eminonis Duc. Navarr\" . Jaurgain records that Oïhenart suggests that the names should in fact be \"Iniconis et Ximinonis\", adding that they should be identified with \"Eneco-Garcia et Semen-Garcia, neveux du souverain de Pamplone\" . This hypothesis is not acceptable from a chronological point of view. It is more likely that, if the passage intends to refer to two individuals, they were Íñigo Iñíguez and Jimeno, father of García Jiménez. The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records that \"filius eius Eximinus Enecones\" succeeded \"rex Enneco Garseanes\", adding that his wife was \"Munia\" and that he died \"era DCCLXXV\" . This source is confused and contradicted by numerous other primary sources in many of the details which it records.

The Codex de Roda records that \"Garsea Scemenonis et Enneco Scemenonis\" were brothers . \"Enneco rex, filius Simeonis\" donated property to Leire by charter dated 18 Apr 842 .

Ibn Hazm names \"Awriya\" as the daughter of \"Musa ibn Musa\", adding that she married \"Garsiya rey de los Vascos\" and names their son \"Musa ibn Garsiya\" . This García has not otherwise been identified in the families of the early kings of Pamplona/Navarre. One possibility is that the sources have misnamed him and that he is the same person as Galindo Iñíguez, son of Íñigo \"Arista\" [King] of Pamplona (see below, Part B.), who converted to Islam, probably had a Muslim wife, and is recorded as having a son named Musa. m [AWRIYA], daughter of MUSA ibn Musa.

The sources are contradictory regarding the parentage of Íñigo \"Arista\". His parentage is indicated by Al-Udri who names \"Yannaqo ibn Wanniqo\" as \"hermano de madre de Musa ibn Musa\" . The Arab historian Ibn Hayyân records the death in the Muslim year 237 (5 Jul 851/22 Jun 852 A.D.) of \"Wannaqo ibn Wannaqo frère uterin et allié de Musa ibn Musa\" and the accession of \"son fils Garsiya comme émir de Pampelune\" . However, other sources suggest that the king who reigned in Navarre at that time was the son of \"Jimeno\". The Codex de Roda names \"Enneco cognomento Aresta\" without naming his father or giving his patronymic . Another passage in the same source records that \"Garsea Scemenonis et Enneco Scemenonis\" were brothers . It is not certain that \"Enneco cognomento Aresta\" and \"Enneco Scemenonis\" in these two passages refer to the same person, but this is possible. The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records that \"filius eius Enneco Xemenones\" ruled for 22 years after \"Eximinus Enecones\", adding that his wife was \"Oneca regina\", that he died \"era DCCCL\", and that during his reign holy remains were transferred \"ab Osca in monasterio Leioren\" . This source is confused, and contradicted by numerous other primary sources in many of the details which it records, but presumably this passage is intended to refer to Íñigo \"Arista\". \"Enneco rex, filius Simeonis\" donated property to Leire by charter dated 18 Apr 842 . There is no reference in this document to the donor as \"Arista\" but, assuming that the document is genuine, it appears to be the only entirely contemporaneous document which names the king who ruled in Navarre during the first half of the 9th century so it should presumably be accorded the corresponding degree of respect. Whatever the correctness of his parentage, it appears that ÍÑIGO \"Arista\" [King] of Pamplona, established himself in [820/25], although no primary source has yet been found which confirms that this is correct. The Carolingian Franks, who first invaded the territory around Pamplona in 778, were finally driven out in 824. Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada, writing in the first half of the 13th century, records that \"Enecho Arista\" came \"ex Bigorriæ comitatu\" and settled \"ad plana Navarræ\" and was chosen \"regni principatum\" by the residents . This appears inconsistent with the marriage of Íñigo´s mother to Musa Ibn Fortún, which is suggested by Ibn Hayyân (see above). If the Arab texts are to be believed, Íñigo allied himself with the Banu Qasi family, whose leader was his uterine half-brother according to the sources quoted above, presumably to consolidate his position. He was injured in the battle for Pamplona in which his brother Fortún was killed in 843 . The Chronicon Fontanellensis records that ambassadors from \"Induonis et Mitionis Ducum Naverrorum\" attended Charles II \"le Chauve\" King of the West Franks \"in Vermeria Palatio\" with gifts and agreed peace, dated to 851 .

If the passage intends to refer to two individuals, it is more likely that they were Íñigo Iñíguez and Jimeno, father of García Jiménez (see above). However, Marca´s interpretation is more likely to be correct as no other record has been found which indicates that two kings reigned in Pamplona at the same time. Íñigo suffered from paralysis before he died .\n\nm [ONECA], daughter of ---. The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records that \"filius eius Enneco Xemenones\" ruled for 22 years after \"Eximinus Enecones\", adding that his wife was \"Oneca regina\" . This source is confused, and contradicted by numerous other primary sources in many of the details which it records. As noted above, it is not certain whether \"Enneco Xemenones\" is intended to refer to Íñigo \"Arista\". The wife of Íñigo \"Arista\" is not named in the Codex de Roda. Another possibility is that the wife of Íñigo was ---, daughter of Lubb ibn Musa. Ibn Hazm records that \"Musa ibn Musa\" arranged the marriages of \"las hijas de su hermano Lubb ibn Musa\" with \"los hijos de Wanaqo ibn Sanyo, rey de los Vascos\" .

The Codex de Roda names \"Garsea Enneconis et domna Assona et domna ---\" as the children of \"Enneco cognomento Aresta\" . He succeeded his father in [852] as GARCÍA I [King] of Pamplona. He was defeated by the Muslims in [858]. \"Rexo Garsia, filius Eneconis\" donated property to the monastery of Leire, with the advice of \"filii mei Fortunii\", by charter dated 21 Oct 880 . This is the only source so far identified which accords the royal title to García and it is not clear whether it was contemporary. The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, records that \"filius eius Garsea Ennecones\" ruled for 12 years after the death of \"Enneco Xemenones\" and died \"era DCCCXXXV in Lumberri\", his body being returned \"ad monasterium Legeren\" (for burial) . m [firstly] URRACA, daughter of ---. An undated charter refers to a confirmation by rex domnus Garcia et regina domna Urraca maiore . Her origin is not known. Rodrigo Ximénez de Rada, writing in the first half of the 13th century, records that \"Enecho Arista filium Garsiam\" married \"Urracam, de Regio semine\" . Jaurgain suggests that \"de Regio semine\" should be interpreted as meaning \"de la même race que lui\" (based on his assumption that the kings of Navarre were descended from the dukes of Gascony, about which there appears to be no proof) and that Urraca was \"fille de Sanche-Sancion duc de Vasconie\", although he cites no primary source which confirms this parentage . Her origin is discussed by Salazar y Acha who suggests that she was a member of the Banu Qasi family, related to the second wife of Fruela II King of Asturias, which would account for the introduction of the name Fortún into the family of the kings of Navarre . [m secondly LEODEGUNDIS de Asturias, daughter of [ORDOÑO I King of Asturias & his wife Munia ---]. The manuscript of the Codex de Roda entitled \"Versi domna Leodegundia regina\" names \"Leodegundiam Ordonii filiam\" and indicates her position as Queen of Pamplona after her marriage . She is not named in the genealogies in the earlier part of the Codex de Roda. She has been suggested as a possible second wife of King García I but, as there is no indication of dates in the \"Versi\", this is mere speculation. Barrau-Dihigo casts doubt on this identification . It is of course possible that she was not a historical figure at all. It may have been convenient for chroniclers of the rulers of Pamplona to invent a dynastic connection with the kings of Asturias in order to boost local credibility.] García I & his [first] wife had [four] children:\n\na)FORTÚN García ([830]-after 905) . The Codex de Roda names \"Fortunio Garseanis et Sanzio Garseanis et domna Onneca\" as the children of \"Garsea Enneconis\" and his unnamed wife . He succeeded his father in 882 as FORTÚN [King] of Pamplona.\n\n- see below.\n\nb)SANCHO García .

Sancho García & his wife had [two] children:\n\ni)AZNAR Sánchez de Larraún . The Codex de Roda names \"Asnari Sanziones qui et Larron\" as son of \"Sanzio Garseanis\" . m (880) [as her second husband,] his first cousin, ONECA [Íñiga] Fortún de Pamplona, [repudiated wife of ABD ALLAH later ABD ALLAH I Emir of Córdoba], daughter of FORTÚN García King of Pamplona & his wife Aurea --- ([850]-). The Codex de Roda names \"Enneco Furtunionis et Asenari Furtuniones et Belasco Furtuniones et Lope Furtuniones et domna Onneca\" as the children of \"Furtunio Garseanis\" and his wife, recording that Oneca married \"Asenari Sanzones de Larron\" (a second manuscript specifying that she was \"suam congermanam\") and afterwards married \"regi Abdella\" by whom she was mother of \"Mahomat Iben Abdella\" . However, this is unsustainable chronologically if it is correct that she was the mother of Muhammad and his birth date is correctly estimated to [867/68]. On the assumption that this date is correct, it is assumed that Abd Allah was Oneca's first husband. She married her second husband after returning from Córdoba in [880] with her father who had just been released from captivity . As noted in the document MOORISH SPAIN, Ibn Idhari names \"Dorr\" as the mother of Emir Abd Allah´s son Muhammad . It would not be impossible for this to be an adopted Muslim name. However, Dorr is also recorded as the mother of the emir´s daughter Fatima, born \"despues del califato\" which presumably indicates his succession as emir in 888, which would be after Oneca´s supposed return to Pamplona. The conclusion must be that there is some piece of information in the Codex de Roda which is fundamentally incorrect, maybe either the name of Oneca´s Muslim husband or the name of her supposed son. Aznar Sánchez & his wife had three children:\n\n(a)SANCHO Aznárez .

Al-Udri records that \"Mutarrif ibn Musa\" married \"Faliskita, hija de Sanyo, señor de Pamplona\" and that he brought her to Huesca (which suggests that the marriage should be dated to [870/71] when Mutarif took control of Huesca) and had children by her . The date of her marriage is consistent with Velasquita having been the daughter of Sancho, son of García I Iñíguez [King] of Pamplona, but this is not confirmed beyond all doubt by the passage in Al-Udri. m ([871/72]) as his [---] wife, MUTARIF ibn Musa, son of MUSA Ibn Musa & his wife --- (-crucified Córdoba 6 Sep 873).]\n\nc) ONECA García .

The Cronica de Sampiro (interpolated, España Sagrada edition) records that Adefonsus filius Domini Ordonii married Pampilona uxorem ex illorum prosapia generis Xemena by whom he had filios...Garseanum, Ordonium, Froilanum et Gundisalvum qui archidiaconus ecclesie Ovetensis fuit . Sánchez-Albornoz suggests that she was the daughter of King García I , but she is not included among his children listed in the Codex de Roda. Settipani, while agreeing that Jimena must belong to the royal family of Navarre, highlights difficulties with this theory while recognising that none of the other possible origins appears viable . The most obvious difficulty is chronological, as Jimena´s marriage date suggests that, if she was related to the early kings of Navarre, she probably belonged to the subsequent generation. The reference in the Cronica de Sampiro, as reproduced in the Historia Silense, to the alliance between King Alfonso and \"Galiam simul cum Pampiloniam, causa cognacionis\" suggests an alternative possibility that Jimena may have been related to the dukes of Gascony, who maintained close relations with the kings of Pamplona as indicated by charter evidence. The Cronica de Sampiro (interpolated, España Sagrada edition) records that uxore sua Xemena regina was buried with her husband Astoricæ but that their bodies were transferred to Oueto...sub aula sancte Marie Dey genitricis .

He is not included among the children of King Íñigo \"Arista\" listed in the Codex de Roda. Galindo was among the personages who greeted Eulogius at Córdoba in 851 . [m ([after 844]) ---. The name of Galindo's wife is not known. It is likely that she was a Muslim, whom Galindo married after his conversion. One possibility is that the sources which refer to \"García\" (see Part A, above), who married the daughter of Musa ibn Musa of the Banu Qasi and is recorded with a son named Musa, are in fact referring to Galindo Iñíguez. Galindo & his wife had one child]:\n\na) [MUSA ibn Galind ([845/46 or after]-executed Huesca 4 Aug 871) . No proof has been found that Musa ibn Galind was the son of Galindo Iñíguez. However, as noted above, the latter is recorded as having defected to the Arabs, and presumably converted to Islam, and no record has been idenfified of another noble of this name having converted. His birth date is estimated on the assumption that Galindo married a Muslim wife after his supposed conversion, as suggested above. Wali (governor/king) of Huesca. Al-Udri records that \"Amrus ibn Umar ibn Amrus\" rebelled against \"Musa ibn Galindo, amil de Huesca\" whom he killed in the same city which he captured, in A.H. 256 [869/70], specifying that Musa was killed A.H. \"el sábado 13 del mes de ramadán\" [4 Aug 871] .

This is the only document so far identified which suggests that an autonomous part of the kingdom was delegated to Queen Toda during the reign of her son.

Her marriage is indicated by the Cronica de Sampiro which records that Sancho, son of King Ramiro II, challenged the succession of King Ordoño III together with \"avunculo suo Garsiano rege Pampilonensium\", on the assumption (as explained in the document ASTURIAS, LEON) that the passage indicates that Sancho was born from his father's second marriage . Another passage in another manuscript of the Chronicon de Sampiro records that Ranimirus Rex and Tarasia Regina cognomento Florentina had Ordonium, Sanctium et Geloiram . Ranimirus Rex Hordonii quondam Principis proles cum conjuncta Urraca Regina confirmed previous donations to the church of Santiago by charter IX Kal Mar dated to 934 . Ranimirus rex et Urracha regina et prolis eius Ordonius regis donated \"villa...Perales et Volpiare et Villa Rezmiro secundum obtinuit illas Gundisalbo Moniz\" to Vega by charter dated 24 Sep 946, confirmed by ...Sanzius filius regis, Gelvira prolis regis et Deo vota... .

The precise identity of Velasquita´s first husband is uncertain. The Codex de Roda does not specify his patronymic. A reference has been found during the same period to Munio Vélaz Conde de Álava, son of Vela Jiménez Conde de Álava & his wife ---, and it is possible that this was the same person. The title conde was granted infrequently during this period and no reference has yet been found in the Álava/Vizcaya area to another Conde Munio in the early 10th century. Given that comital titles were granted on a personal basis without territorial qualification, it is not impossible that the same nobleman held land in both Álava and Vizcaya and therefore that he would have been described as conde in either territory in different primary sources. m secondly ([930]) GALINDO de Ribagorza, son of BERNARDO [I] Conde de Ribagorza & his wife Tota ---. m thirdly FORTÚN Galíndez, son of ---. Governor of Nájera from 928 to 973 . \"Senior Fortunio Galindoyc in Nazera \" confirmed the grant by \"Sancio Garsianis rex\" of the monastery of San Pedro de Usún to the bishop of Oya, by charter dated 28 Oct 924 .\n\n5.ORBITA Sánchez de Navarra .

The Codex de Roda names \"domna Lopa\" as the child of \"Sanzio Garseanis ex anzilla\", stating that she was mother of \"Regemundo de Bigorra\" . She was probably much older than her legitimate brother and sisters, her husband being the great-uncle of the second husband of her half-sister Velasquita Sánchez. m --- de Bigorre, son of --- (-after 930).\n\nGARCÍA Sánchez de Navarra, son of SANCHO I García King of Navarre & his wife Toda Aznárez ([919]-22 Feb 970, bur San Estebán) . The Codex de Roda names \"Garsea rex et domna Onneca et domna Sanzia et domna Urraca domna Belasquita, necnon et domna Orbita\" as the children of \"Sanzio Garseanis\" and his wife \"Tota Asnari\" . \"Sancius rex cum coniux mea Tuta regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda by charter dated 5 Jan 925, confirmed by \" Garsea eiusdem principis filius, Enneca eiusdem principis filia, Belaschita eiusdem principis filia \" . He succeeded his father in 925 as GARCÍA III King of Navarre, under the regency of his uncle Jimeno García. A charter dated 928 records that rex Fortunio Garcianes had set the limits of villis...Benassa et...Katamesas and that they were confirmed by rege Scemeno Garcianes et suo creato domno Garsea filio de rege Sancio Garsianes, the dating clause recording regnante Scemeno Garsianes cum suo creato domno Garsea in Pampilona et in Deiu... . \"Tota regina, seu filio meo Garsia Sancius\" donated property to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda by charter dated 20 Sep 928 . On the death in 931 of his uncle Jimeno, Íñigo García seized the regency but was forced out in 933 by King García III's mother, the Queen Mother Toda, who installed herself as regent for her son . The Codex de Roda records that \"nepus eius Garsea Sanzionis\" succeeded after the death of \"Scemeno Garseanis\" in 931, stating that he was \"XII etatis sue anno\" . \"Garsea Sancio\" confirmed donations to the monastery of San Pedro de Siresa by \"Sancio Garsee commites domno Galindo, Asenari, Galindonis cum omnis fratres eius\" by charter dated 9 Mar 933, signed by \"Tota Isenari\" . Caliph Abd al-Rahman III invaded Navarre once more in 934, obliging Regent Toda to submit to Córdoba, release Muslim hostages and break with the other Christian kingdoms of the peninsula, although her son was recognised as king by the caliph. Toda broke the peace unilaterally in 937, but was defeated once more by the Muslims . However, regent Toda allied herself with Ramiro II King of León and Fernando González Conde de Castilla, their combined forces defeating the caliph's troops at Alhandega/al-Khandaq, near Simancas in 939 . \"Garcia rex filius Santii regis et Tote regine\" confirmed a donation to Leire by charter dated 14 Feb 938 . \"Garsea rex cum genitrice Tuta regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda by charter dated 22 Nov 947, witnessed by \"Santius Ranimiri regis filius, Fortis Iustis Flaginus comes, Garsea, Eximino, Fortunio Galendo \" . \"Garsea rex cum genitrice Tuta regina et cum filiis Sancio et Ranimiro adque Urraka\" donated property \"in loco Alvelda villam quam olim tradiderat cliens noster Velasco Donniz\", to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda by charter dated 953, witnessed by \"Sancio rex et Ranimiro rex \" . The Cronica de Sampiro records that \"avunculo suo Garsiano rege Pampilonensium \" helped Sancho in his rebellion against his brother Ordoño III King of León . Relations between the Christian kingdoms of the peninsula deteriorated when Sancho I \"el Craso\" King of Asturias sought refuge in Navarre in 958 after he was deposed by his cousin King Ordoño IV. King García III, allied with the caliph, helped restore King Sancho to the throne in 960. He also defeated and captured Fernando González Conde de Castilla . After the latter was released by his daughter Urraca, King García formed an alliance with Castile and Barcelona against Caliph Al-Hakam II. The alliance was, however, unsuccessful and King García lost Calahorra to the caliph's troops . He was Conde de Aragón by right of his wife. The Codex de Roda records the death \"970 VIII Kal Mar\" of \"Garsea Sanzionis \" . The manuscript of the Codex de Roda entitled \"Initium regnum Pampilonam\" records that \"Garsea rex\" was buried \"in castro Sancti Stefani\" .\n\nm firstly (after 9 Mar 933, repudiated 940) his first cousin, ANDREGOTO Galíndez Condesa de Aragón, daughter of GALINDO [II] Aznar Conde de Aragón & his second wife Sancha García de Navarra (-972). One manuscript of the Codex de Roda names \"Aznarium Galindonis et domna Andregoto regina et domna Belasquita\" as the children of \"domno Galindo comes de Aragone\" and his wife \"domna Sanzia\" . As Andregoto is not named in her husband's charter dated 9 Mar 933 (see above), it is assumed that they married after that date. However, this charter, confirming donations to San Pedro de Siresa by Andregoto's ancestors, suggests that the marriage may have been planned already at that time. The Libro de Regla of Leire Monastery, compiled in 1076, names \"Sancium et Ramirum\" as the two sons of \"Garsea Sanciones et uxore sua regina Eximina\" , confusing King García III with his grandson King García IV, whose wife was named Jimena . Caliph Abd al-Rahman III imposed the repudiation by King García III of his wife under the peace terms negotiated with Sunyer Conde de Barcelona in 940, as part of his strategy of dividing the alliances between the various Christian kingdoms and counties in the peninsula . \"Endregoto Galindonis et prole eius Sancio Garseanis rex et uxor eius Urraca Fredenandizi\" donated property to the monastery of San Pedro de Siresa by charter dated 29 Jun 971 .\n\nm secondly (943 or before) TERESA, daughter of --- (-after Sep 957). \"Garsea Santionis rex cum coniuge mea Tarasia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 943, confirmed by \"Sancius ipsius regis filius \" . \"Garsea Sancionis rex cum coniuge mea Tarasia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 946, confirmed by \"Santio ipsius regis filius Fortun Galindoz, Fortun Scemenonis\" . \"Garsea Sancionis rex cum coniuge mea Tarasia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated [956], confirmed by \"Gundissalvus comes, Ranimirus comes, Didacus comes, Fertunius dux et abba, Fertunius Garseanis, sennor Lope Garseanis suus germanus \" . \"Garsea Sancionis rex cum coniuge mea Tarasia regina\" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated Sep 957, confirmed by \"Didacus comes, Ranimiro comes, Eximinus Vigilanis, Lope Garseanis\" .\n\nKing García III & his first wife had one child:\n\n1.SANCHO García \"Abarca\" de Navarra ([935/40]-Dec 994) . His parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 29 Jun 971 under which \"Endregoto Galindonis et prolem eius Sancio Garsianis rex\" donated property . The manuscript of the Codex de Roda entitled \"Initium regnum Pampilonam\" records that \"filius eius Sancius rex\" succeeded on the death of \"Garsea rex\" . He succeeded his father in 970 as SANCHO II \"Abarca\" King of Navarre, Conde de Aragón.\n\n- see below.\n\nKing García III & his [first/second] wife had three children:\n\n2.RAMIRO García ([937/40]-8 Jul 981, bur Leire).

The dating clause of a charter dated 22 May 974, under which the monks of San Martín de Albelda exchanged property with the men of Leza, names \"regnante principe nostro Sancio in Pampilona et sub illius imperio frater eius Ranimiro in Vekaria et in Leza\" . \"Sancius rex et Urraka regina cum germanis nostris Ranimiro et Eximino\" confirmed a prior donation to San Pedro de Siresa by \"genitor noster Garsea rex\" by charter dated 15 Feb 979, confirmed by \"Eximino Sancionis, Garsea Furtunionis, Belasco Lihoriz\" .

The name of Ramiro's wife is not known. However, it is possible that she was Sancha Sánchez, daughter of Sancho --- & his wife --- (-after 15 Aug [981]). This is based on the charter dated 15 Aug [981] under which Sancho II King of Navarre donated property to Leire monastery in memory of his brother Ramiro, which is subscribed by \" Domna Sanccia Sanccionis \" . Sancha´s name has a position of prominence among the subscribers, following immediately after the king´s son García and his nephews Sancho Ramírez and García Ramírez. The names of these four subscribers precede the names of the bishops in the document. Another possibility is that Sancha Sánchez was the daughter of King Sancho, although none of his other known daughters subscribed the document. Ramiro & his wife had [three] children:\n\na)SANCHO Ramírez de Viguera ([960/70]-).  Santio Ranimirus, Garssia Ranimirus  confirmed the charter dated 15 Feb 991 under which \"Santio Garsseanis rex cum coniux mea Urraca regina\" donated property to the monastery of Leire . \"Sancio rex \" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 992, signed by \" Sancio filius Ranimiri regis, Garsea frater eius \" . King of Viguera 981-999. m ---. The name of Sancho's wife is not known. Sancho & his wife had two children:\n\ni) [LOPE Sánchez (-[1058/60]). According to Jaurgain, Lope Sánchez was the son of Sancho Ramírez . However, it is not clear that this parentage is confirmed by the primary sources which he cites. The difficulty is that there were at least three different Navarrese noblemen named Lope Sánchez in the first half of the 11th century (see NAVARRE NOBILITY) and no confirmation has been found that any of them was the son of Sancho Ramírez. Jaurgain also states that Sancho III \"le Mayor\" King of Navarre invested his cousin, Lope Sánchez son of Sancho Ramírez, as vicomte de Labourd, the territory of which included the valleys of Arberoue, Ossès, Cize, Irissary, Iholdy et Armendarits, but he does not cite the primary source which confirms that this is correct . Vicomte de Labourd. \"Loup-Sanche vicomte de Labourd [et] Fortun-Sanche son frère\" donated the church of Sainte-Marie de Bayonne to the bishop of Labourd by charter dated 1058 .]\n\nii) [FORTÚN Sánchez (-1062 or after) . According to Jaurgain, Fortún Sánchez was the brother of Lope Sánchez, and son of Sancho Ramírez although he cites no primary source which confirms that this is correct . Vicomte de Labourd. \"Loup-Sanche vicomte de Labourd [et] Fortun-Sanche son frère\" donated the church of Sainte-Marie de Bayonne to the bishop of Labourd by charter dated 1058 .\n\nb)GARCÍA Ramírez de Viguera (-after 1005 or after 1009).  Santio Ranimirus, Garssia Ranimirus  confirmed the charter dated 15 Feb 991 under which \"Santio Garsseanis rex cum coniux mea Urraca regina\" donated property to the monastery of Leire . \"Sancio rex \" donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 992, signed by \" Sancio filius Ranimiri regis, Garsea frater eius \" . King of Viguera 999-1005. He may have been the Christian prince who allied himself with Abd al-Rahman \"Sanchuelo\" in an attempt to restore the latter to power in Córdoba in 1009 after the coup led by Caliph Muhammad al-Mahdi . m [as her first husband,] TODA, daughter of ---. Her marriage is confirmed by the charter dated 1054 under which Fronilla, Garsie regis filia et regine domne Tote donated property in Torrillas to the monastery of Irache . There is no other Garsia rex to whom this can apply other than garcía Ramírez. A suggestion about an earlier or later possible marriage of Toda is provided by the same charter which refers to sorore mea que peccavit et fornicata est cum fratre suo. It is unlikely that fratre suo should be interpreted literally. However, it is possible that the husband of Fronilda´s sister was the stepson of her mother, a relationship which may have been disapproved by the church even though they were not members of the same blood line. If this is correct, it is likely that this other marriage of Toda was her second, after the death of García Ramírez, and that her husband already had a son by his first wife.

This separate confirmation suggests that the donor may not have been the same person as Fortún Sánchez Señor de Nájera, although it is not the only example found where one of the main protagonists in a charter is also listed as a confirmant or subscriber. m FORTÚN Sánchez Señor de Nájera, son of --- (-killed in battle 1054).\n\nii)FRONILDA García de Viguera (-1054 or after). Fronilla, Garsie regis filia et regine domne Tote donated property in Torrillas to the monastery of Irache by charter dated 1054 .\n\niii) [daughter . The charter dated 1054 under which Fronilla, Garsie regis filia et regine domne Tote donated property in Torrillas to the monastery of Irache refers to sorore mea que peccavit et fornicata est cum fratre suo . It is possible that this sister of Fronilda is the same person as Toda mentioned above. It is unlikely that fratre suo should be interpreted literally. However, it is possible that this daughter´s husband was the stepson of Fronilda´s mother, a relationship which may have been disapproved by the church even though they were not members of the same blood line.]\n\nc) [TODA Ramírez . Her marriage and patronymic are confirmed by the charter dated 1087 under which her daughter dompna Sancia Oriol donated Zabalza and Idocin to Leire monastery, for the souls of patris mei Oriol Garceiz et matris mee Tota Ranimiriz  . The identity of her father as Ramiro García de Viguera is not certain. However, the chronology appears to be favourable and no other Ramiro has been identified at that time among the Navarrese nobility. m AURELIO García, son of GARCÍA --- & his wife --- (-after 13 Apr 1042).]\n\n3.URRACA García . \"Garsea rex cum genitrice Tuta regina et cum filiis Sancio et Ranimiro adque Urraka\" donated property to the monastery of San Martín de Albelda by charter dated 953, witnessed by \"Sancio rex et Ranimiro rex \" . \"Santio rex simulque frater meus Ranimirus et dompna Urraca regina\" confirmed a donation to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla by charter dated 971, confirmed by \" Dompna Urraca, eiusdem regis germana, Garsea ipsius regis filius Furtunio Galindonis dux, sennor Eximino Santionis, Furtunio Garseanis \" . same person as ? URRACA (-[12 Jul], before 3 Apr [1009]). Her parentage and two marriages are shown in Europäische Stammtafeln , but the primary source which confirms that they are correct has not yet been identified. Del Pino assumes that her first marriage is correct when he records that Urraca took the initiative to free Fernando González Conde de Castilla, captured by the forces of King García III in 960, married him and escaped to Burgos . She is not named in any of the documents in the compilation relating to the county of Castile . The timing of her reappearance at the court of Navarre to sign the 971 charter quoted above is consistent with her having been recently widowed from her supposed first husband. Concerning her second marriage, the charter dated 992 under which her brother Sancho King of Navarre donated property to the monastery of San Millán de la Cogolla is signed, among others, by \" Sancio filius Gogelmi comitis \" (apparently Urraca's son by this supposed second marriage) . The charter dated 993, under which \"Willelmus Sancius comes\" restored the monastery of Saint-Sever, also appears to confirm his wife´s royal parentage when it records that \"meæ conjugis Urracæ, ex regali stirpe procedentis \" consented to the restoration . \"Willelmus Sancius comes et dominus totius Vasconie, cum Urraca sua muliere\" donated the church of Sainte-Susanne to the abbey of Saint-Jean de Sorde by undated charter . \"Willelmus Sancius comes et dominus totius Vasconie, cum Urraca sua muliere\" donated the church of Sainte-Susanne to the abbey of Saint-Jean de Sorde by undated charter . \"Willelmus Sancius comes et dominus totius Vasconie, cum Urraca sua muliere\" donated the church of Sainte-Susanne to the abbey of Saint-Jean de Sorde by undated charter . The Historia Abbatiæ Condomensis quotes a charter dated 29 Jul 1011 under which \"Ugo Præsul, secundum lineam carnis eidem Duci propinquis et affinis\" donated property to the convent of Condom, for the souls of \"meorumque parentum, item Garsiæ-Sanctii Comitis et filii sui Sanctii-Garsiæ Comitis, et Guillermi-Sanctii Comitis et Gimbaldi Episcopi, et Guillelmi Comitis, et Garsiæ Comitis, et Bernardi-Guillelmi Comitis, et Urachæ Comitissæ\" . She died before 3 Apr [1009], the date of the charter under which her son \"Bernardus Willelmus comes cum germano meo Sancio\" confirmed, \"annuente beatæ memoriæ matre mea Urraca\", the foundation of Saint-Sever by \"genitor meus Willelmus Sancio comes\", this wording suggesting that Urraca died only shortly before the confirmation especially as the document is purportedly signed by \"Urracæ comitissæ\" . The necrology of Saint-Sever records the death \"IV Id Jul 1041\" of \"Urraca comitissa\" . However, either the year is incorrect or this entry refers to another \"Urraca comitissa\". Even without the evidence of the 3 Apr [1009] charter, Urraca would have been well over 90 years in 1041 if this entry refers to the wife of Guillaume Sancho. m firstly (before 26 Dec 955) as his second wife, FERNANDO González Conde de Castilla, son of GONZALO Fernández Conde de Castilla & his wife Muniadomna [de Asturias] ([910]-Jun 970). m secondly (after 14 Jul 972) GUILLAUME Sanchez Comte de Gascogne, son of [SANCHO Garcia] & his wife --- (-[996]).\n\n4.JIMENO García (-after 15 Feb 979). \"Sancius rex et Urraka regina cum germanis nostris Ranimiro et Eximino\" confirmed a prior donation to San Pedro de Siresa by \"genitor noster Garsea rex\" by charter dated 15 Feb 979, confirmed by \"Eximino Sancionis, Garsea Furtunionis, Belasco Lihoriz\" .\n\nSANCHO García de Navarra, son of GARCÍA III Sánchez King of Navarre & his first wife Andregota Galíndez Condesa de Aragón (after 935-Dec 994) .

His mother's name is confirmed by the charter dated 29 Jun 971 under which \"Endregoto Galindonis et prolem eius Sancio Garsianis rex\" donated property . The manuscript of the Codex de Roda entitled \"Initium regnum Pampilonam\" records that \"filius eius Sancius rex\" succeeded on the death of \"Garsea rex\" . He succeeded his father in 970 as SANCHO II García \"Abarca\" King of Navarre, Conde de Aragón. He inherited a kingdom which had been considerably weakened by Muslim attacks during the last years of his predecessor's rule, and on his accession accepted the suzerainty of Caliph al-Hakam II. King Sancho attempted unsuccessfully to reassert his authority but was defeated in 975 at Estercuel near Tudela . A period of calm followed, presumably due to a pact with al-Mansor confirmed by the latter's marriage with King Sancho's illegitimate daughter. \"Endregoto Galindonis et prole eius Sancio Garseanis rex et uxor eius Urraca Fredenandizi\" donated property to the monastery of San Pedro de Siresa by charter dated 29 Jun 971 . Sancius rex et Ranemirus rex cum Clara Urraka regina donated la villa de Cirueña to the monasterio de San Andrés de Cirueña by charter dated 13 Nov 972, signed by Sanctius rex, cum prolis Garseam confirmed by Ranemirus frater ipsius regis domna Urraka Clara regina . \"Garsias Ferdinandez cum coniuge mea Ava comitisa\" founded the monastery of Infantado de Covarrubias, offering \"filiam nostram Urracam\" as a nun there, by charter dated 25 Dec 978, confirmed by \" Sancio rex, Urraka regina, rege Scemeno \" . \"Sancius rex et Urraka regina cum germanis nostris Ranimiro et Eximino\" confirmed a prior donation to San Pedro de Siresa by \"genitor noster Garsea rex\" by charter dated 15 Feb 979, confirmed by \"Eximino Sancionis, Garsea Furtunionis, Belasco Lihoriz\" .

The Cronica de Sampiro records the marriage of \"Ordonius filius regis\" and \"filiam Fredenandi Urracam\", from the context dated to the reconciliation of King Ramiro II and Conde Fernando after the latter's rebellion , which is dated to [943/44] by Torres . The Cronica de Sampiro records the marriage of \"Ordonium Adefonsy regis filium\" and \"Ferdinando Burgensium comitte filiam suam relictam ab Ordonio Ramiri filio\" . The Codex de Roda records the marriage of \"regem Sanctium\" and \"Urracam, filiam comitis Sanctii de Castella\" , although it is chronologically more acceptable that Urraca was the daughter of Conde Fernando, which is confirmed by the charter dated 29 Jun 971 under which \"Endregoto Galindonis et prole eius Sancio Garseanis rex et uxor eius Urraca Fredenandizi\" donated property to the monastery of San Pedro de Siresa .
