        "text": "Before Aragon came into being as a self-proclaimed kingdom in 1035, the northern counties of Jaca, Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were all independent marches and Frankish feudal fiefdoms. In a bid to stem Frankish and Moorish invasions, the counties of Aragon, Sobrarbe, Ribagorza, and the duchy of Castile united under the Kingdom of Pamplona (later Navarre). After King Sancho's death, the kingdom was divided between his sons. Ramiro I was initially named king of Aragon in 1035; later, after his brother Gonzalo's death, he was also named king of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza in 1044. The new kingdom grew quickly, conquering territories from the Moorish kingdoms to the south. Huesca was taken in 1096 and Zaragoza in 1118. According to Aragonese law, the monarch had to swear allegiance to the Kingdom's laws before being accepted as king. The King was considered \"Primus inter pares\" (first among equals) within the nobility. A nobleman with the title \"Justicia\" acted as ombudsman and was responsible for ensuring that the King obeyed the Aragonese laws. There is an old saying \"En Aragón antes de Rey hubo Ley\" which can be translated as \"In Aragon the law was before the king\".\n\nIn the 12th century Aragon was united with the county of Barcelona by the marriage of the queen of Aragon with the then count of Barcelona. In the 13th century the possessions of the House of Barcelona were enlarged with the kingdoms of Valencia, Sardinia and the Island of Sicily. In the fourteenth century the kingdom of Majorca was added. At the end of the 15th century a new personal union made Aragon, together with Castile and Leon into the nucleus of the Kingdom of Spain which was achieved by the final reconquest of the kingdom of Granada in 1492.\n\nThe next two centuries Aragon remained one of the kingdoms of the spanish monarchy until at the beginning of the 18th century, the kingdom was liquidated by king Philip V of the house of Bourbon.\n\nSeveral attempts were made to regain its autonomy, albeit within the kingdom of Spain but it was only in 1978 that Aragon regained an autonomous status within the kingdom.\n\nIn the twelfth century a kind of board of representatives emerged which developed into a parliament consisting of representatives from the clergy, the nobility and the cities and subjects of the king. This parliament, which had a great say in the affairs of Aragon, was liquidated together with the kigdom by Philip V and the aragonese affairs were decided since then by the spanish government in Madrid.\n\nThe testament of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought. The Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro, Alfonso's only brother, who had been a Benedictine monk since childhood, even when his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession.\n\nThe Aragonese nevertheless took Ramiro out of his monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the Duke of Aquitaine, then betrothing their newborn daughter to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, who was then named Ramiro's heir.\n\nIn 1137 he yielded his executive powers to Raymond Berenger of Barcelona, the husband of his two-year old daughter Petronilla, providing that the kingdom should be inherited by their son.\n\nFor his tomb in the S. Pedro la Vieja a tomb of a roman official from the 2nd-3rd century AD was reused. It shows a clipeus with the portrait of the official supporterd by two angels.\n\nAt the age of 24 he married Petronilla, the two-year old daughter of the king of Aragon. The marriage was ratified in 1151. In the act by which king Ramiro abdicated Raymond is called the prince of Aragon and the count of Barcelona to be respected as a king (tamquam regi) by his subjects.\n\nThis position seems to have been intended to be equal to an alférez as Raymond should command the army for his father-in-law who had proved to be utterly un-suited to command an army as had his brother before.\n\ní In medieval Iberia, an alférez was a high-ranking official in the household of a king or magnate. The term is derived from the Arabic الفارس (al-fāris), meaning \"horseman\" or \"cavalier\", and it was commonly Latinised as alferiz or alferis, although it was also translated into Latin as armiger or armentarius, meaning \"armour-bearer\". The connexion with arms and armour is visible in several Latin synonyms: fertorarius, inferartis, and offertor. The office was sometimes the same as that of the standard-bearer or signifer. The alférez was generally the next highest-ranking official after the majordomo. He was generally in charge of the king or magnate's mesnada (private army), his personal retinue of knights, and perhaps also of his armoury and his guard. He generally followed his lord on campaign and into battle. [1]\n\nTitle: X RAIMVNDVSS BERENGARII COMES BARCHINONENSIS X ET PRINCEBS REGNI ARAGONENSIS.\n\nThe seals of Raymond Berengar are his seals as a prince of Aragon by right of his marriage.\n\nOn these seals he is represented as a warrior, dressed in a coat of arms of which the arms show vertical bars and a gironny of narrow lines which is thought to have been a carbuncle or thunderbolt.\n\nOf this shield the carbuncle was copied from the shield of Alfonso I the Battler.\n\nAs such the shield is an early example of a mark of cadency (the pales Or added to the red shield of Alfonso) or of marshalling (the conjoining of the carbuncle of Alfonso with the pales of Ramon Berenger).\n\nThe vertical bars later developed to a paly Gules and Or. Opinion agrees that these are the colours of the county of Barcelona which in last instance were the colours of temporal power of the Empire and of France of which Barcelona was a fief.\n\nAbout the carbuncle much confusion and difference of opinion exists. The supposed office of a kind of alférez or commander of Aragon suggests that the figure was taken from the shield of Alfonso I the Batallador, the immediate predecessor of Raymond in Aragon.\n\n1150 Equestrian seal: Arms: Pales (?) and studs.

On the obverse the same picture and legend [X RAIMUNDU]S BEREN [GARII COMES BARCHIONENSIS]. [2]\n\nDuring his reign Aragonese influence north of the Pyrenees reached its zenith, a natural tendency given the affinity between the Occitan and Catalan dominions of the Crown of Aragon. His realms incorporated not only Provence (from 1166 or just before), but also the counties of Cerdanya (1168) and Roussillon (inherited in 1172). Béarn and Bigorre paid homage to him in 1187. Alfonso's involvement in the affairs of Languedoc, proved highly beneficial, strengthening Aragonese trade and stimulating emigration from the north to colonise the newly reconquered lands in Aragon.\n\nFrom 1162 until 1196, the office of alférez was held by Jimeno de Artosilla, Gonzalvo Copelino, Sancho Ramirez and Artoldo de Alagón, Tarino and Portolez (who was also Grand Senechal). [3]\n\nÆ This may explain why the studs, carbuncle or thunderbolt disappeared from the arms as the command of the army was not in the hands of the king.\n\nEquestrian seal.

[5]\n\nUnion of Barcelona with Aragon\n\nThe idea of hereditary succession gained early acceptance, but the vestiges of election could still be detected in the acclamation of a new king. Following Visigothic custom, the king occasionally was anointed and crowned. Peter II of Aragon, who received his crown in Rome from the pope, became a papal vassal and held his kingdom as a papal (i.e. Innocentius III) fief.\n\nThe renewal of the infeudation of Aragon (after the renouncement of the will of Alfonso I) took place by the coronation of Peter II by Pope Innocentius III in St. Pancratius church in Rome on 4 Februari 1204. From that date and by grant of the Holy See of 6 June 1205, the monarchs of Aragon could be crowned by the archbishop of Tarragona after having obtained the approvement of the Pope. This applied also to the queen.\n\nIt is only after the coronation of Peter II in 1204 that his arms as a count of Barcelona became also his arms as a king of Aragon and consquently his personal arms. This is demonstrated by this fragment of his seal of 1207 on which the knight on horseback is called king and wears a coat of arms with pales formerly being only the coat of arms of the count of Barcelona. Nevertheless, Barcelona and Aragon remained separate domains as Barcelona was a fief of the crown of France and Aragon was a papal fief, be it in a personal union.\n\nEquestrian seal.

Also there is a coat of arms with the pales of Barcelona/Aragon and this representation is the oldest known representation of the arms in color.\n\nThe window certainly has been made after 1234 because the arms of Navarre with the carbuncle dates from that time (after 7 April 1234). [8] The imperial arms with the two-headed eagle disapperared for some time after the reign of Frederick II which dates the window before 1245-50. In that period Henry VII was the only crowned Roman King because his half-brother Conrad IV was elected a Roman king indeed but was never crowned. We cannot suppose that Henry Raspe and William of Holland have contributed to the window [9] Also the arms of the papacy are on the window and it is unlikely that this was represnted together with the arms of Fredrick II after he had been excommunicated for the second time in 1239.[10] This taken into account the program for the window was made before about 4 July 1235 because at that date Henry VII was deposed by his father, and taken prisoner even before the marriage of Frederrick II with Isabella Plantagenet of England in 1235. The window for that reason has been finished even during the negotiations for that marriage between 1234-35.

The supreme commander is the king and there are four divisions from the nations of his kingdom. Lower commands are of his marshal (a prince Moncada) and the heads of several families being his vassals.\n\nBefore Ferdinand succeeded in Aragon after the death of his father John II, he bore several coats of arms corresponding with his kingship of Sicily and his co-regency of Castile and Leon.\n\nCoins struck in Sicily for example, show a quarterly of: 1. Aragon, 2&3 Castile, 4. Leon. On others there is a quarterly of: 1. Castile, 2. the eagle of Sicily, 3. Aragon and 4. Leon.[19]\n\nOn still others the arms of Castile-Leon and of Sicily are separated:\n\nCoin of Isabella and Ferdinand with their respective coats of arms\n\nObv.: Crowned arms of Castile-Leon supported by a nimbused eagle. L.: FERNANDVS * ET * ELISABET\n\nRev.: Crowned arms of Aragon and Sicily-Trinacria. L.: DOMINVS * MICHI * ATIVTOR.\n\nor in alliance:\n\nWhen Isabella had ascended the throne of Castile and Leon in 1474 it was agreed the next year that both Isabella and Ferdinand should bear the same coat of arms quarterly of Castile and Sicily, but with that difference that the arms of Isabella were supported by a nimbused eagle and the arms of Ferdinand II should be crested, symbolizing his armed authority.\n\nSo, when at last in 1479 Ferdinand succeeded in Aragon he bore:\n\nThe principal officials of the royal household were the chancellor, usually an ecclesiastic, who was responsible for the issuance of royal letters and the preservation of records; the mayordomo, a magnate, who supervised the household and the royal domain; and the alférez (Catalan: senyaler), also a magnate, who organized and directed the army under the king's command. The merinos or, later, adelantados, who functioned as provincial governors in Castile, were also drawn from the nobility. The Catalan counties initially were part of the Carolingian empire, but the various counts gradually achieved independence. The counts of Barcelona had gained an effective sovereignty over all of Catalonia by the 11th century. Under the count's direction, vicars (vegueres) and bailiffs (batlles), responsible respectively for justice and taxes, administered the Catalan territorial subdivisions. The privilege of immunity granted to bishops, magnates, monasteries, and military orders prohibited royal officials from dispensing justice or levying taxes in immune lands, except in cases of negligence. The immunities of the archbishop of Compostela in Galicia and those of the military orders south of Toledo were among the most important.\n\nFeudal ideas emphasizing private and personal relationships exerted great influence on the governmental and military organization of the Christian kingdomsmost fully in Catalonia, where French influence was strong. As vassals holding fiefs of the count of Barcelona, the Catalan nobles owed him military and court service, and they often had vassals of their own. In the western states, royal vassals usually held land in full ownership rather than in fief. As vassals of the king or count, the magnates, called ricos hombres (i.e., rich or powerful men) in the west and barones in Catalonia, functioned as his chief counselors and provided the bulk of the royal military forces. Nobles of the second rank, known variously as infanzones, caballeros, or cavallers, generally were vassals of the magnates.\n\nIn a very early stage the kingdom of Pamplona and its successor kingdom of Aragon had an achievement which usually was the emblem of the government consisting of the officials of the royal household. In Pamplona the nucleus of such an achievement was a combination of the square cross for the administration and the christogram of the armed forces, supoorted by angles or lions.\n\nFrom Aragon an achievement is known consisting of the christogram supported by angels and consequently being the emblem of the (autonomous) army staff.\n\nanother achievement dates from somewahat later and is above the entrance of St. Felix in Uncastillo a quarter of Zaragoza. This was made about the turn of the 12t and 13t century\n\nChristogram supperted by two angels\n\nSan Felix de Uncastillo\n\nFrom 1162 until 1196, that is to say during the rreign of Alfonso the Cbaste the office of alférez was held by Jimeno de Artosilla, Gonzalvo Copelino, Sancho Ramirez and Artoldo de Alagón, Tarino and Portolez (who was also Grand Senechal).\n\nSuch an achievement became obsolete after teh renewal of the infeudation of Aragon by the Pope in 1204.\n\nFor some reason no emblems of the royal household are known from the next hundred-and-fifty years, be it because they were not used and made, be it that they were destroyed later. On the other hand the arms of the ecclesia, being a red cross on a white field were introduced in Aragon after 1204. Later these arms were supported by St. George which became the patron saint of Aragon.\n\nStill later St. George became the charge of the seal of the Cortés of Catalonia and the arms of Aragon became the red cross between four moors heads, which, maybe somewhat farfetched, may have been intended as a kind of supporters of the arms of the ecclesia in Aragon.\n\nIn any case, the arms with the moors heads were used by the aragonese cortés and an achievement symbolizing the royal aragonese household only ocurred in the middle of the 14th century, in the time of Peter IV, the Ceremonious (1336-87).\n\nFor sure, this cries for research!"
