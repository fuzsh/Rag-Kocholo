He was a member of the House of Capet.\n\nBorn in Poissy, to Louis IX (the later Saint Louis) and Margaret of Provence, Philip was prior to his accession Count of Orleans. He accompanied his father on the Eighth Crusade to Tunisia in 1270. His father died at Tunis and there Philip was declared king at the age of 25. Philip was indecisive, soft in nature, timid, and apparently crushed by the strong personalities of his parents and dominated by his father's policies. He was called \"the Bold\" on the basis of his abilities in combat and on horseback and not his character. He was pious, but not cultivated. He followed the dictates of others, first of Pierre de la Broce and then of his uncle Charles I of Sicily.\n\nCoronation of Philip III.After his succession, he quickly set his uncle on negotiations with the emir to conclude the crusade, while he himself returned to France. A ten-year truce was concluded and Philip was crowned in France on 12 August 1271. On 21 August, his uncle, Alfonso, Count of Poitou, Toulouse, and Auvergne, died returning from the crusade in Italy. Philip inherited his counties and united them to the royal demesne. The portion of the Auvergne which he inherited became the \"Terre royale d'Auvergne\", later the Duchy of Auvergne. In accordance with Alfonso's wishes, the Comtat Venaissin was granted to the Pope Gregory X in 1274. Several years of negotiations yielded the Treaty of Amiens with Edward I of England in 1279. Thereby Philip restored to the English the Agenais which had fallen to him with the death of Alfonso. In 1284, Philip also inherited the counties of Perche and AlenÃ§on from his brother Pierre.\n\nPhilip all the while supported his uncle's policy in Italy. When, after the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, Peter III of Aragon invaded and took the island of Sicily, pope Martin IV excommunicated the conqueror and declared his kingdom (put under the suzerainty of the pope by Peter II in 1205) forfeit. He granted Aragon to Charles, Count of Valois, Philip's son. Philip intervened in the Navarrese succession after the death of Henry I of Navarre and married his son, Philip the Fair, to the heiress of Navarre, Joan I.\n\nIn 1284, Philip and his sons entered Roussillon at the head of a large army. This war, called the Aragonese Crusade from its papal sanction, has been labelled \"perhaps the most unjust, unnecessary and calamitous enterprise ever undertaken by the Capetian monarchy.\"[1] On 26 June 1285, Philip the Bold entrenched himself before Girona in an attempt to besiege it. The resistance was strong, but the city was taken on 7 September. Philip soon experienced a reversal, however, as the French camp was hit hard by an epidemic of dysentery. Philip himself was afflicted. The French retreated and were handily defeated at the Battle of the Col de Panissars. The king of France himself died at Perpignan, the capital of his ally James II of Majorca, and was buried in Narbonne. He currently lies buried with his wife Isabella of Aragon in Saint Denis Basilica in Paris.\n\nFrench Monarchy\n\nDirect Capetians\n\nPhilip III\n\nPhilip IV\n\nCharles III, Count of Valois\n\nLouis d'Evreux\n\nMargaret, Queen of England\n\nBlanche, Duchess of Austria\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, Dante sees Philip's spirit outside the gates of Purgatory with a number of other contemporary European rulers. Dante does not name Philip directly, but refers to him as \"the small-nosed\" and \"the father of the Pest of France.\"\n\n[edit] Marriage and children\n\nPhilip with MarieOn 28 May 1262, Philip married Isabella of Aragon, daughter of James I of Aragon and his second wife Yolande of Hungary, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary, and had the following children:\n\n1.Louis (1265 â May 1276). He was poisoned, possibly by orders of his stepmother.\n\n2.Philip IV (1268 â 29 November 1314), successor as king.\n\n3.Robert (1269â1271).\n\n4.Charles (12 March 1270 â 16 December 1325), Count of Valois.\n\n5.Stillborn son (1271).\n\nAfter Isabella's death, he married on 21 August 1274, Maria of Brabant, daughter of Henry III of Brabant and Adelaide of Burgundy. Their children were:\n\n1.Louis (May 1276 â 19 May 1319), Count of Ãvreux.\n\n2.Blanche (1278 â 19 March 1305, Vienna), married Rudolf III of Austria on 25 May 1300.\n\n3.Margaret (1282 â 14 February 1318), married Edward I of England\n\nNote on Wife: Isabel + of ARAGON\n\nIsabella of Aragon (1247 â 28 January 1271), infanta of Aragon, was, by marriage, Queen consort of France in the Middle Ages from 1270 to 1271.\n\n[edit] LifeShe was the daughter of King James I of Aragon and his second wife Violant of Hungary, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary.\n\nIn Clermont on 28 May 1262, she married the future Philip III of France, son of king Louis IX and Marguerite of Provence. They had four sons:\n\n1.Louis (1265â1276).\n\n2.Philip IV \"the Fair\" (1268â1314), King of France.\n\n3.Robert (1269â1271).\n\n4.Charles of Valois (1270â1325).\n\nShe accompanied her husband on the Eighth Crusade against Tunis. On their way home, they stopped in Cosenza, Calabria. Six months pregnant with her fifth child, on 11 January 1271 she suffered a fall from her horse after they had resumed the trip back to France. Isabella gave birth to a premature stillborn son.[1] She never recovered from her injuries and the childbirth, and died seventeen days later, on 28 January. Her husband took her body and their stillborn son and, when he finally returned to France, buried her in Saint Denis Basilica. Her tomb, like many others, was desecrated during the French Revolution in 1793."
