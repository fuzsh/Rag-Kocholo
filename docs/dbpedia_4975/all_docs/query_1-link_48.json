How much more destruction before they stop???\n\nOur thoughts and prayers are with you during these incredibly difficult times.\n\nLEBANON NEEDS HELP NOW\n\nThe people of Lebanon are facing a tremendous crisis, the full extent of which is not yet assessable. The infrastructure of the country's has been reduced to rubble, and 25% of its citizens lost their homes and rendered homeless.\n\nBeyond the most visible basic needs such as shelter, food and water, medical aid, and fuel, is the need to alleviate the fear and despair being felt in every part of the country. To exacerbate the catastrophe, main roads for supplies and aid have been destroyed. Main Electric plants have been bombed out.\n\nWe appeal to you and the world to assist in this humanitarian effort and to join us in calling for an immediate cease fire in conjunction with vigorous diplomatic efforts to put an end to the conflict and the suffering of the Lebanese people. We also appeal for diligent bold steps to ensure lasting peace in Lebanon and the Middle East.\n\nPlease make your humanitarian (and tax deductible in U.S.) donation to the\n\nRed Cross/Red Crescent, UNICEF and/or Mercy Corp at WWW.Relieflebanon.org\n\n************\n\nEarly Emigrants visiting Shweir from Abu Jihad to Ghassan to Hilda to Caroline to Maria to...
