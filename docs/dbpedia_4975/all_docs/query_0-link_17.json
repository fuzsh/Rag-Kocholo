        "text": "Not to be confused with Hemphill, Texas.\n\nHemphill County is a county located in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, its population was 3,382. The county seat and only incorporated community in the county is the city of Canadian. The county was created in 1876 and organized in 1887. It is named for John Hemphill, a judge and Confederate congressman. Hemphill County is the most recent Texas county to permit alcohol sales.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly history\n\nFor the 200 years leading up to 1875, nomadic Indian tribes representing the Apache, Comanche, Kiowa, and others roamed the Panhandle following the huge bison (buffalo) herds. In search for an alternate route to California through Santa Fe, New Mexico, Josiah Gregg (1840), and Captain Randolph B. Marcy (1845) surveyed trails that crossed Hemphill County, following the south bank of the Canadian River.\n\nThe 1874–75 Red River War was an effort by the United States Army to force the Indians of the Southern Plains to move to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma. Two major battles took place in what would become Hemphill County: the Battle of Lyman's Wagon Train and the Battle of Buffalo Wallow.\n\nOn April 12, 1879, Wheeler County became the first organized county in the Panhandle, with 14 other unorganized counties attached to it, one of which was Hemphill County. Hemphill County was organized in July 1887.\n\nInfluence of Santa Fe Railroad\n\nIn 1886, the Southern Kansas Railway Company, a Santa Fe subsidiary, began to build a rail line into the Panhandle of Texas. The tracks entered Hemphill County during 1887 and further encouraged settlement in the area, creating three town sites: Mendota, Canadian, and Glazier.\n\nIn 1907, Canadian was designated a division point by the Santa Fe, a factor which brought diversification to the previously ranching economy of the area. The Santa Fe influence remained very strong until the mid-1950s, when the railway moved its employees to Amarillo.\n\nMeanwhile, Hemphill County was roughly the midway point of two smaller lines, the Clinton and Oklahoma Western Railroad Company and the Clinton-Oklahoma-Western Railroad Company of Texas.\n\nOil production\n\nDuring the 1970s, the county grew due to a rapid expansion of oil production. Though oil was discovered in the county in 1955, production remained relatively small because the technology had not yet progressed to efficiently capture the very deep reserves known to exist. By 1974, oil production had reached 999,000 barrels (158,800 m3) and more than 1,891,000 bbl (300,600 m3) in 1978. In 2000, about 505,000 bbl (80,300 m3) of oil and more than 8 billion cubic feet of natural gas were produced in the county, but the future looked very bright.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 912 sq mi (2,360 km2), of which 906 sq mi (2,350 km2) are land and 5.9 sq mi (15 km2) (0.6%) are covered by water.\n\nMajor highways\n\nU.S. Highway 60\n\nU.S. Highway 83\n\nState Highway 33\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nLipscomb County (north)\n\nEllis County, Oklahoma (northeast)\n\nRoger Mills County, Oklahoma (southeast)\n\nWheeler County (south)\n\nRoberts County (west)\n\nGray County (southwest)\n\nNational protected area\n\nBlack Kettle National Grassland (part)\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1880 149 — 1890 519 248.3% 1900 815 57.0% 1910 3,170 289.0% 1920 4,280 35.0% 1930 4,637 8.3% 1940 4,170 −10.1% 1950 4,123 −1.1% 1960 3,185 −22.8% 1970 3,084 −3.2% 1980 5,304 72.0% 1990 3,720 −29.9% 2000 3,351 −9.9% 2010 3,807 13.6% 2020 3,382 −11.2% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1850–2010 2010 2020\n\nHemphill County, Texas - Demographic Profile\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 2010 Pop 2020 % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 2,656 2,090 69.77% 61.80% Black or African American alone (NH) 4 4 0.11% 0.12% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 12 18 0.32% 0.53% Asian alone (NH) 18 10 0.47% 0.30% Pacific Islander alone (NH) 3 0 0.08% 0.00% Some Other Race alone (NH) 0 4 0.00% 0.12% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) 28 119 0.74% 3.52% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 1,086 1,137 28.53% 33.62% Total 3,807 3,382 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.
