The movie capital of the world. The capital of credit. \"El Lay.\" The home of UCLA. Seldom has a city provoked such a diverse set of images. \"The Westwood street scene. ..punk rockers coexisting with movie stars.\" Hollywood, often seen as one and the same with L.A., has brought Los Angeles interna- tional renown. In true \"Holly- wood\" fashion, it sought publicity by every available means, whether it be good or bad. As a result, in the world's eyes, every L.A. waitress is a potential starlet, every other shop is a suntan saloon, and anyone who isn't getting into shape already is. Los Angeles is a city bombarded by a media montage of images. Westwood Village rein- forces the L.A. image. Flank- ed by such well-known neigh- borhoods as Bel-Air, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Hollywood, it has emerged as the entertainment center for the Westside chic. True to the L.A. image, the Westwood street scene is one of punk rockers coexisting with movie stars and high school bebop- pers. The true Village person is either teen-aged, middle- aged, or of a similar mentali- ty, sporting satin tennis shoes, a gold lame sweatsuit, and a chartruese lightning bolt in the hair. People flock to Westwood to wait in line for the latest movies, buy the latest clothes or listen to the Hare Krishna's latest chant. Westwood. north village But what else do you do in Westwood besides eat, see a movie and try to find a parking place? The Bruin demands more excitement from life than this. Refusing to simply blend into the West- wood street scene, the UCLA community has attempted to \"The Bruin demands more excitement from life.\" inject the elements of college life into the fast paced village lifestyle. But the Bruin in- fluence is limited at best. It is not until you enter the North Village that you sense that Westwood is not only a miniature Hollywood, but a student town too. Leaving the glitter and glamour of Westwood be- hind, backpacks, bearwear and biology books appear. So does noise. Bands blare wildly from fraternity parties, while stereos compete in the dorms. Blue and gold seems to cover the landscape, and UCLA decals can be seen plastered in the rear windows of the sea of cars lining the streets. J|j north village The UCLA identity is not limited to a superficial level. Being a student in- volves slipping into a unique mindset and lifestyle, where a year is not divided into months, but quarters, and everyone's biorhythms re- volve in the same ten week cycle. It is a period of life where late nights abound, rents are easily simplified by sneaking that fourth room- mate into your single apart- ment. It is a period of life that brings up unique experiences . . . like finals week. Finals week is a case study in panic. Lines form at the \"Everyone's bio- rhythms revolve In the same ten week cycle.\" Coffee House, where bleary eyed students come for double espresso breaks un- der the illusion that increas- ing their blood caffeine level to 60% will overcome the fact that they've only had three hours sleep in the last three nights. Students even speak in a special language code. \"How many you got?\" \"Two left. One's a mick though.\" The mick turns out to be your hardest final and you end up with a \"D\" in Armenian history to explain away. Somehow everyone sur- vives. The English major standing behind you at 1 AM in the coffee line just happen- ed to take a quarter of chem- istry last year for the heck of it and knows the answer to the problem you've been sweat- ing over for the last two hours. Yes, life does go on after finals. It is, if not one of the most pleasurable aspects of college, certainly one of the most memorable. Ifll mm ucia tradition 10 Half a century ago, UCLA consisted of four build- ings huddled together around a dusty quad on some bean- fields in a place called West- wood. The UCLA of today is no longer simply a stretch of beanfields, but a major uni- versity, and the four original structures have multiplied to eighty-four. In spite of this growth, UCLA has held on to tradition, and the UCLA of today is a mixture of the old with the new. UCLA's first building in terms of both history and has it that the bells are actually a tape, they do exist. For the past twenty-one years, the \"mistress of the chimes\", Laura Lee Brown, has played the chimes daily. Originating from a double keyboard located in the basement of Schoenberg Hall, the chimes automat- ically boom out the hours. The noon musical numbers however, are played by the \"chimesmistress\" herself, who disappears at 11:30 AM daily into Schoenberg's base- ment and bolts the door to \"Bruin alums, dressed in blue and gold, . . . cheer the Bruins to victory with their own band . . .\" sentiment is Royce Hall. Designed in an architectural style that was the rage in Northern Italy about 850 years ago, Royce Hall is the symbol of UCLA, and the building people think of most when they conjure up an image ot the campus. A more subtle, but just as memorable, feature of UCLA is the campus chimes. Lo- cated atop Powell library, their deep-throated sounds mark the hours with the familiar Westminster Abbey tune, serving as a subtle reminder to sauntering Bruins that class is about to begin. Although campus rumor practice her selections for the day. Then, at exactly ten minutes to twelve, she begins to play, usually a selection of sacred music followed by any one of a number of classical pieces. While buildings and bells conjure up traditional images of campus, the strongest sense of Bruin tradition and spirit can be felt in their strong support of UCLA's athletic program. Bruin alums, dressed in blue and gold, dot the landscape at pre-football game picnics and cheer the Bruins to victory with their own band, cheer- leaders and rowdy rooting section. Not to be outdone by their predecessors, bus- loads of rowdy Bruins can be seen rolling off fraternity row toward the Coliseum hours before the game in search choice seats. Those left t home are found congregating around TV sets with friends sending an echoing roar of cheers and moans through- out Gayleyville with each successive touchdown and fumble. It just goes to show you, even after fifty years, that old Bruins never die . . .they just become a little more \"grizzly\" at times (sorry!). JW 11 routines Once the wide-eyed fresh- man has overcome the \"wonders of Westwood\" and the \"awesomeness\" of UCLA tradition, he usually slips into that routine called college life. Although this experience varies from the bookworm whose life revolves in ten week cycles of \"eat, sleep, study,\" to the more carefree Bruin whose college days blend Into one continuous cycle of \"party, recover, party...\", there are some routines universal to the UCLA experience. For example, who hasn't experienced a UCLA basket- ball game, an Ackerman movie or a speaker in Meyer- hoff Park? \"Who hasn't panicked at the thought of losing their reg. card...?\" What Bruin has found academic success without his trusty lecture notes, yellow highlighter and spiral UCLA notebook? Who hasn't panicked at the thought of losing their reg. card, or spent a dollar at the Country Store one Friday afternoon so that they could write a check for over the amount and have cash for Friday night? And finally, what Bruin has graduated from UCLA with- out having taken at least one hike up Bruin walk with their backpack in one hand and a Daily Bruin in the other? Routines. What would col- |«j lege life be like without them? wl 13 hassles Who says that life has to be easy? Certainly not the administration at UCLA. It appears that there are some things UCLA forgot to men- tion in their brochure, for getting around the Big-U is no piece of cake, but rather somewhat of a hassle. Standing in line, something every Bruin can relate to, appears the single most popular pastime at the start of the quarter. If you're not slowly shuffling along in the bookstore line, chances are that you're at the Book Buy Back line trying to sell back your forty-five dollar textbook from last year. Another choice line leads to the computer, where desperate students are found pleading with exhaust- ed computer terminal oper- ators to sneak them into Jazz, even though they're number 199 on the wait list. ■ ^^: ^.» V! «w^ >r'^' If you're not waiting in a line, chances are that you're walking about campus. Even this is reduced to a chore. When you're not hiking up Janss steps, you're weaving your way down Bruin Walk \"Getting around the Big-U is no piece of caKe • • • amongst what appears to be a majority of the 36,000 UCLA students. To make matters worse, the unwary Bruin is continually assaulted by religious and political groups handing out pamphlets and fliers. The commuter has a spe- cial breed of problems, at the core of which lies the parking permit. If he had one, great, if not he may as well consider transferring schools, parking illegally at Bullocks, only taking classes with lecture notes or simply resigning himself to a year of parking tickets. Life at UCLA can be a hassle, but there must be something holding us here. Could it be the people, parties, football games, spirit, dorm life, greek houses . . . JIJ watch listen, enjoy. interact participate, belong. fall calendar Hot spells, cold nights. Santa Anas that spread fires through the dense chaparral in the San Bernadino and Santa Monica mountains. Saturday football games at the Coliseum. How fun to have a winning team. ..at least for a while. And who cares if we can't go to the Rose Bowl— we'll get a tan, drink a beer (or two) and party at the game. Sorority rush and fraternity rush paved the way for fall quarter. The dorms opened up, and the freshmen moved in, not know- ing what to expect in the year to come. How was your summer? I had to work. ..have to pay for school, you know. I really missed the Summer Olympics. I felt so sorry for all those athletes who couldn't go. Did you see Shogun on TV? All that beau- tiful scenery and such a sad ending... I almost cried. Wanna see my new kimono? \"I've got to get another job; housing rates went up again...\" And those lines at school. I swear, they were longer this year. Two and one-half hours to buy books (not to mention the $75 it cost to buy four paperbacks), three hours to get a photo ID, and another hour to get a pair of football tickets and to get a blood test (whoops, wrong line... I thought it was for coffee). And I won't even mention that hideous computer line, up-down-up-down, kinda like a yo-yo. What shall I take as a buffer class this quarter? Astro 3? Jazz? I hope that art teacher gives me permission to enroll; I wonder if he'll believe that I'm a graduating senior. And those poor freshmen, lost in all this confu- sion—they don't know which line is which, let alone what class to drop. But how exciting it is to be writing your first check ... and your se- cond ... and your third... What about you seniors? Did you declare your major yet?

Hallo- ween and Thanksgiving are just around the corner and Christmas swiftly approaches— shop early! Did you see the World Series? The Philadelphia Phillies beat the Kansas City Royals, four games to two. Did you know that this was the \"I had to wait two extra months to see...who really shot J.R.

Wasn't it ironic on November 4th— the presidential election fell on the same day as the first anniversary of the American Em- bassy takeover in Iran! The United 20 States made a right turn that day when ex-California governor Ronald Reagan (Rep.), along with running mate George Bush, defeat- ed presidential incumbent Jimmy Carter (Dem.).

But then comes a month of pure ecstasy ... Christmas break! Tis the season to ... go SKIING! Winter is here! N ow let's reminisce about the events that shaped fall quar- ter... On October 8th, Mayor Tom Bradley visited the campus. Mayor of Los Angeles since 1973, he officially announced his candidacy for a third term to begin in 1981. On October 10th, Mike Farrell, who portrays \"B.J.\" on the popular TV series M*A'S*H, spoke to students in Ackerman's Grand Ballroom. He showed slides from his trip to Southeast Asia, including Cambodia and Thailand. The slides were of actual refugees and real-life M*A*S*H units. Farrell is the spokesman for a group called CONCERN that works with world hunger aid programs. On the lighter side, if you were on Bruin Walk on October 10th, you probably would've seen Mr. Ava- cado Heads, a decorating contest put on by the California Avacado Commission to promote their bumper crop this year. They also (continued on page 22) 21 fall calendar (continued) (continued from page 21) co-sponsored the movie \"10\" for that week and gave away 700 T- shirts. The winner received $50 and three wishes (for Bo Derek?). Changing Seasons, another Jerry Brown spoke to students; this year, Andrew Young, former US Representative to the United Nations, was there to speak. Two days later came Halloween, and for the moment, serious issues and reality in general, were for- gotten. Vampires scouted campus, searching for prey (or docile \"The weather was clear and the energy high as werewolves came out of hiding (and dorm rooms).\" movie starring Bo Derek, was shown in Royce for free, and the line stretched all through the quad and down the side of Powell Library. After the showing, psych- ologists, sexual counselors, and Seasons actor Michael Brandon conducted a seminar which dealt with changing sexual roles in our society today. Mellow rock was featured in Royce Hall on October 15th, when the group Ambrosia visited UCLA. Noted for their fine harmonies and outstanding vocals, the group mesmerized their audience during that one-night performance. Janss steps is a frequent site for political talks, where students lie on the grass, chuck some frisbees and listen to speakers while working on their tans. Last year. Governor freshmen), while pumpkins con- quered the North Campus Facility. The weather was clear and the energy high as werewolves came out of hiding (and dorm rooms) and parties were thrown all over Los Angeles. ASUCLA sponsored a Halloween party in Ackerman Union which included a live band, door prizes, a costume contest, and 25% off on Student Store merchan- dise. If you were watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show in Hollywood or walking down West- wood Blvd., you encountered more than the normal share of Halloween freaks. One of the most popular events on campus has got to be Ackerman Movies. Where else can you go see one or two big motion pictures for a buck? Definitely not in WestwoodI (continued on page 24) 23 fall calendar (continued) (continued from page 22) During fall quarter, Ackerman presented these films: the French comedy La Cage Aux Folles; \"10\" with Bo Derek; the 007 thriller Moonraker with Roger Moore; American Gigolo starring Richard Gere: a Halloween double feature, Hitchcock's Psycho and Love at First Bite with George Hamilton; 1979 Academy Award winning A facet of Bruin life that sets UCLA apart from smaller univer- sities is the variety and caliber of speakers featured on campus. Norman Lear, creator of the then- controversial series All in the Family, was here giving students a better idea of life after graduation in the world of television. Dr. Jerry Buss, owner of the Los Angeles Lakers and the Forum sports complex, to name only two of his busmess endeavors, is an American \"This was the first time the Phillies ever won the World Series in its 98 year history.\" Kramer vs. Kramer starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep; a special use violence festival with Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon and Dirty Harry with Clint Eastwood; and, finally, Electric Horseman starring Robert Redford and Jane Fonda. success story in himself His flamboyant talk about investing in the business world was another of the interesting talks that some students experienced this quarter. Sam Ervin, survivor and parti- cipant in the notorious Watergate scandal, was also m Ackerman this quarter. For entertainment, there is always a concert in Royce, a recital in Schoenberg or a theatrical production in Melnitz. Guitarist Leo Kottke played on campus in No- vember. Then a week after Kottke's performance, the cast from ABC's hit show Fridays was here to entertain students. UCLA had a special treat this quarter. As a part of the LA Bicentennial's Berlin/Los Angeles festival, UCLA was honored to host the Berlin production of the Sinking of the Titanic. Royce Hall was transformed into the ill-fated ship just for the occasion. The opera starts with the boarding of the audience (second class passen- gers), and ends with the evacuation of passengers to nearby life boats. But the quarter was soon over and finals hit. The libraries over- flowed With frantic, caffeine-wired students. The quarter went so fast, just like It always does...

The closest Bing Crosby could have gotten to a White Christmas around here would have been to hold a freezer defrosting party. I waited all of break for the snow to fall, but it never came . . .

I was soooooooo happy when Nina and Cliff got back together \"I thought we'd go to Chippendales and see the male strippers . . .'\" again. Weren't you? But I'm starting to get a little mixed up with the characters. With Joe divorcing Ruth to be with Leora, Heather killing Diana to get PJ back, Brooke and Tom involved in an inter- national drug ring, and Wally getting a little tired of being married to Devon, his alcoholic and suicidal wife, it's getting much more difficult to keep up with all the hot goings- on ... .

In the news, Christmas break got off to a very somber start when the news of John Lennon's death hit the airwaves. It was a shock to everyone ... by the end of the week, many major cities had held candlelight vigils in his memory, including London, NYC, and L.A.

Morgan, UCLA's Athletic Director until his retirement in June of 1980, passed away on December 15, 1980 (see page 180). He will truly be missed by all . . . By far, the biggest news of the quarter occurred in January. On January 20, 1981, the day Ronald Reagan was inaugurated into office as the 40th President of the United States, the 52 American hostages in Iran were finally freed. The 52 Americans had spent a total of 444 days in captivity. Also, January marked the month of Super Bowl XV, held this year in (continued on page 31 ) at c 3 O >- m m 29 30 winter calendar (cont.) (continued from page 29) New Orleans, Louisiana. The Oakland Raiders battled it out with the Philadelphia Eagles to win by a score of 24-10. February brought us a nation- wide controversy regarding the link between radioactivity and cancer. Appropriately called the Cancer \"... the 52 American hostages in Iran were final- ly freed.\" Connection, the controversy cen- tered around the 40+% cancer rate among the cast and crew of the 1954 film The Conqueror, which happened to be filmed downwind from a nuclear testing site in Nevada. Among those associated with the film who died of cancer were stars John Wayne and Susan Hayward, co-star Agnes Moore- head (of TV's Bewitched fame), and Conqueror director Dick Powell. March brought us back into the or school spirit . . . how temporary it may have been. Our basketball (continued on page 32) 31 winter (cont.) (continued from page 31) team entered the NCAA Basketball Tournament seeded 10th in the nation. Unfortunately, we lost in the first round, along with seven other top-ten teams .... But not only did we lose the Tournament, we also lost Coach Larry Brown. He moved on to the pro leagues (the New Jersey Nets to be exact). Reasons for his resignation were that he was offered six times UCLA salary to coach the Nets, and that, equally importantly, there was too much pressure from the student body and the alumni on winning and how to coach the team. On campus, UCLA had a very impressive line of speakers, con- certs, and overall happenings. As in every quarter, Ackerman Movies had a fantastic selection of films. Winter quarter began with Francia Ford Coppola's The Black Stallion, followed by The Shining, starring Jack Nicholson, Next, came another Francis Ford Cop- pola extravaganza, Apocalypse Now. with Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando. Then came the Drug Week Festival — a full week of \"films to watch while you're stoned.\" Among the films shown that week were Cocaine Fiends, Reefer Madness, 32 Cheech and C hong's Next Movie, Kentucky Fried Movie, and Tlie Wizard of Oz. Rounding off the remainder of the quarter were All That Jazz, with Roy Scheider; John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd in The Blues Brothers: Caddyshack with Bill Murray and Rodney Danger- field; Dressed to Kill starring Angle Dickinson; a Son of Violence Festival with The Warriors and The Wild Bunch; and, to top it all off, the \"death\"ly funny Harold and Maude, starring Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. Winter also boasted an extra- ordinary group of speakers. Who could go wrong with big stars like Dudley Moore (of \"10\" fame); Raquel Welch (beauty and brains); Rodney Dangerfield, who was the recipient of this year's Jack Benny Award for Excellence in Comedy; and Jack Lemmon, who stopped by \"I was so happy when Cliff and Nina got back to- gether.\" to discuss his tremendous career and to screen his latest movie Tribute. Other well-known speakers who came by to enlighten our dreary lives were Mary Crosby, the vil- lainous Kristen on Dallas; the colorful and off-beat Timothy Leary, Dr. Sidney Wolfe, one of \"Ralph Nader's Raiders\"; Rev. Jesse Jackson and the cast of Fridays. Concerts also entertained the UCLA population through the talents of Bobby and the Mid- nights and the San Francisco- based pop satire band, the Toons. The Toons were featured along with the Fantastic Animation Festival. Last, but not least, we were also blessed with a piddling of comedy. Gary Muledeer came by during Greek Week and kept the audience rolling (in the aisles, not j's) .... Spring quarter, here we come u C s it '8 ■ o 33 h, back to the old grind. For the . . seniors it's the final turn into the stretch, for the freshman, it's only the drive into the first turn. But it's time to rest for everyone, to take stock of what the future holds for us, to bask in the sun, to start that exercise program we've been promising ourselves we would, to read that book we've had on our shelf collecting dust since Christ- mas, and to clean that room that we didn't get a chance to do during the break. Say it is true. But no, in the quarter system the pace never slows. I mean, I was behind from the first day of classes, as usual. And the pace goes on. It seems to me that classes are getting harder to get every quarter. One of my roommates didn't get any classes, and she's a graduating senior. And who needs a new reg. card number anyway. Mine from freshman year is just fine. I've only lost forty pounds, cut my hair, had my braces off— well, maybe, but it means I'll have to change my reg. card number on my checks, it's never only one thing. And the search for classes goes on, the intro classes are stuffed, with seniors fulfilling breadth requirements and everyone else just trying to fit in any class. Did anyone get jazz? And so we move through the first few weeks, partying at the frats by night (and working on yearbook deadlines by day). Midterms just crept up, and all of a sudden they were there. But how could I have remembered, I was so distracted with the pink and green all over campus that celebrated \"Too Hip\" week for the yearbook. Isn't the yearbook great, I mean the people who wrote all that terrific, unparalled . . . sorry, got away from myself. But midterms came and went, fairly easily, I guess the profs were out at the beach along with the rest of us. And Mardi Gras, what a beautiful sight, with the lights and sound at night. And all that busseling activity getting ready for it. it truely makes one excited about the collegiate experience. We im.^ ^^'^#^-'^fi'fr*'^%ia^i'i ^ spring calendar all cruised through the rest of the quarter, for not too much was planned in the aftermath of Mardi Gras. Senioritis took hold of many, which infected the rest of us. \"But remember, if you don't study, and pass this class, you might not graduate,\" repeated out parents over and over, and that drove us into the library, even as the days grew more beautiful. Some were finished early, but it had to be, a final 3-6 on Friday, but I NEEDED to take that class. That's the way the cookie crumbles, or something like that. Graduation was exciting, all those caps and gowns out in Drake Field. The world is yours they said, we said you can have it. One psycholo- gy student friend of mine, when asked what she would pursue said, \"Who knows, but thank God I can type eighty words per minute.\" Life goes on, and students come and go. And who has the time for vacations anyway. I've got to find a\" job this summer, my twin brothers are going to college next year and I've got to earn some money. It just never seems to end. The campus in spring is always a busy time, always full of events. And this spring was no different. On April 22, Ted Patrick spoke to a fascinated crowd in Ackerman about his experiences as a depro- grammer who works with religious cult members. The next day, April 23rd, Joseph Benti, news anchor- man on channel 2 spoke about local T.V. and news reporting. How about it all you Communications majors! Erica Jong came on May 7th to promote her new book. Yet the biggest crowd was drawn by Gene Wilder, funny man from such great movies as The Producers, Silver Streak, and his latest Stir Crazy. The UCLA theatre department put on a play called \"Hooray Hollywood,\" a parody on the movies of the thirties and forties. And while on the theatre side, Marcel Marceau was here again on campus, gracing us with his (continued on page 36) 35 spring calendar (cont.) ^%^ 36 (continued from page 35) amazing trade in the art of mime. Other events this quarter in- cluded a UCLA Design Students' Art Exhibit, a health faire held in the Schoenberg Quad, the SLC elec- tions, and an event-packed En- gineers' Week which included a treasure hunt and a paper airplane contest. And Ackerman Movies . . . Need we say more? As always, we were bombarded with a bevy of fantastic films. There was an especially good range of films to choose from this quarter. Comedy, thrills, adventure, sex, and overall honky-tonkity was available for our viewing pleasure. Starting out the quarter was Urban Cowboy, starring John Travolta. Again the trendsetter as in Saturday Night Fever, Travolta made \"The Cowboy Look\" very chic (But for some reason, spiked leather boots, designer jeans, and a belt buckle the size of a frisbee just can't compare to the real thing). Round- ing out the first half of the quarter were the disaster movie satire Airplane; Fame, whose title song won the Best Song Oscar; and a Dustin Hoffman Festival, featuring The Graduate, Marathon Man, and Midnight Cowboy. Second half of the quarter was welcomed in with Private Benjamin starring Goldie 4 Hawn; a Woody Allen Festival, featuring Annie Hall and Man- hattan, both with Diane Keaton, and Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Sex; and the Humphrey Bogart classic, Casa- blanca. Then came the successor to fall quarter's Violence Fest and ; winter quarter's Son of Violence I Fest . . . the Bride of Violence Festival, featuring Stanley Ku- brick's Clockwork Orange and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Cli- maxing the year of Ackerman Movies were two excellent films . . . Being There starring Peter Sellers, and Breaking Away, the surprise hit of 1979. Talk about good timing . . . Breaking Away gave us just the boost we needed entering into finals week (get psyched guys!!!) While encapsulated on campus for five days a week (for the average Jose Bruin, anyway) it is easy to become isolated from the cold, cruel world. Even while learning what makes the world go around, clocks tick, chemicals combine and societies subsist, I ^ J Mlfrr ,i*s:.-.. f can always find myself amazed at how much time had passed off campus before I reacquainted myself with the events beyond Circle Drive. The first thing that affected the scene around us was something which we had the first word about —\"UCLA gets a new head basket- ball coach.\" This sent ripples across the college sport circle following our gloomy play in the NCAA playoffs. After dropping out in our first game, Larry Brown jumps out of the driver's seat and Larry Farmer bounced into it. While all the upsetting news of our basketball future was dying down, an assassination attempt on Presi- dent Ronald Reagan slapped out at us — it really did wonders for out outlook on the President. He's so popular now. Speaking of popular, it was great to find out what were the hot movies this past year. The Oscars were not even left untouched by the assassination attempt — they were postponed. But what's one day's wait to find out who was too hip and (continued on page 38) {continued from page 37) who wasn't so hip? On the hip side, Robert Redford and his Ordinary People snared (among other things) the Best Movie, Best Director and Best supporting Actor Oscars. Robert \"don't call me a 'Raging Bull' \" DeNiro was Best Actor and Sissy Spacek won Best Actress Oscar for Coal Miner's Daughter. And of course, this gives them \"Fame\" — the Best Song. After immediately running down to Westwood to make sure \"Ordin- ary People\" was worth such Oscar- ite attention, many people were reminded of a date that will go down in infamy — April 15th. \"Oh no! Don't be mean to me Mr. Taxman . . .\" Taxes are what make this country great — somebody has to pay for it. And as my grand- mother always says, \"If you don't pay for something, you tend to misappreciate it and its true value.\" This is quite true granny, except when you're talking about the weather. Talk about appreciating something that is free! Give me a 38 spring calendar (cont.) fl^ Jon Volght, Vietnam Rally, Janss Steps, March 9 suntan and I'm set for life (or at least a few days). It is amazing at how easily the spring slipped by without drenching us with April showers to bring May's flood water. But you know the only trouble with Spring quarter (other than trying to study at the Rec center) is that there is no holiday break. I don't count a measly Memorial Day Weekend a holiday! What ever happened to the good ol' Easter vacation I used to have? I miss my Easter Basket! While we were missing out on the Easter Bunny, the conquest of space marched on. The Space Shuttle finally got off the ground. Just think, maybe they can build some dorms on the moon if the Space Shuttle works. (But can you imagine getting a parking permit for your shuttle craft!) The only other exciting goings on around us was a mayoratorial race and the new baseball season. Yes, that's the way it is; good night, and have a pleasant tomorrow, (we're gonna miss ya Uncle Walter), wj 39 mardi gras 40 remaining game and food booths, that everyone who wished to participate didn't get the chance. As Mardi Gras drew closer, the whole campus was buzzing with an excited air. The publicity cam- paigns were making their last push in advertising, including radio, newspaper and billboard adver- tisement. The final polishing of the entertainment booths was taking place, as well as the final touches on the prefabricated booths. The Saturday before the opening of the Gras, the big booths started to put together their elaborate structures. Almost overnight. Phi Mardi Gras attracts any and all types of people, from the high school students seeking the ex- citement of college life, to the parents who bring their children to enjoy the games, rides, and sights and sounds of a carnival. Both Friday and Saturday nights at- tracted huge crowds of people, and lines for the more popular rides and booths were always long. Yet the music blared from the stage, and the entertainment of the Mardi Gras clowns provided distractions and added to the festive mood. All too soon, though, the Gras was over, and m a matter of days, Mardi Gras at UCLA! Not only does it provide a break in the mid-Spring quarter blues, it also puts the school in the local lime- light for something other than sports. It's a fund raiser for UCLA's summer camp for innercity kids. UniCamp, but more that it re- presents weeks and months of work and planning that build up to a short but exuberating weekend. The Mardi Gras committee had been working on the 1981 version ever since the 1980 version ended. Publicity, judges, and contracts with traveling carnival companies had to be contacted long before most anyone even started thinking about it. Yet Winter quarter was when it all started happening. Fraternities wooed sororities to come their way and work on a booth with them, while on-campus clubs and organizations finalized their booth intentions. Even some dorm floors got into the act, but the competition was great for the few Psi's and Chi Omega's House of Horrors and Lambda Chi's and DG's Funhouse took shape. The game and food booths had their facades put up and the rides were trucked in, in anticipation of the beginning of Mardi Gras weekend. \"But Friday night came very quickly, and once the gates were opened, there was no turning back\" Thursday night was a special time for the groups sponsoring the various booths. The grounds and the rides were opened up for the groups, and a special, exclusive, uncrowded night was given to those who had spent so much time to make the event successful. But Friday night came very quickly, and once the gates were opened, there was no turning back. the booths were taken down and the IM field was returned to its normal use. Yet the excitement of the weekend wears on; the mem- ories of the parties in the backs of the booths, the songs that continue to run through your head, and that little kid you bent the rules for so he could win a prize. But behind all the frolic of Mardi Gras lies a very worthy cause... The revenue acquired through Mardi Gras goes to benefit Uni- camp — the official UCLA charity Just like Mardi Gras, Unicamp is a student-run organization. It provides week-long summer camps for children from lower-income families. The Unicamp staff works with various community service agencies (such as public schools, boys' clubs) throughout the South- ern California area to choose (continued on page 42) 41 unicamp (continued from page 41) youngsters who would benefit most from Unicamp. Unicamp was started in 1935 by students in the University Religious Conference. At that time, all monies for charity had to come strictly through the solicitation of funds. But because of its popularity \"UniCamp has played host to over 10,000 kids.\" among students, Unicamp became the official charity for Mardi Gras and UCLA in the early 1940's. Since its start 46 years ago, Unicamp has played host to over 10,000 kids. The two Unicamp camps, both located in the Barton Flats area of the San Bernardino National Forest, holds groups of 80 and 65 kids. But this year's Unicamp staff, under the guidance of Director Shirley Walch, hopes to double that number this year. So, when you think of all the fun you had at Mardi Gras this year, think of all the fun you're creating for those kids who will be attending Unicamp this summer. I guess you can say that Mardi Gras produces twice the happiness at half the price (how's that for inflation fighting!). ■m ^ ^ /■-r, \\ 42 J ■\\ '^^ mmm UNICAMP EVALUATION CAMPER QUESTIOHS 1.

Inside gossip is running rampant about who is running for this or that office. Yes, student body elections are coming up, and the speculation of who the candidates are, will be known in a matter of weeks. For many of the soon-to-be candidates, preparation has been going on for months, with campaign contacts and promises already in the works. The rest of the school goes on with its everyday lives, unaware of the bustling tur- moil going on inside the backhalls of government. \"Flyers and pamphlets are distributed at key points along Bruin walk. . .along with sandwich boards.\" And then comes the beginning of Spring quarter when the candidates are known and the push for involve- ment and concern on the part of the student body start. Meetings in dorms, with greeks and special interest groups are scheduled. Contacts with influential groups and people are cemented, and as many students as possible are met, for word of mouth is an important vote getter. A week before elections and the pace quickens. Flyers and pam- phlets are distributed at key points, or wherever they can find a place to stand on Bruin walk. Billboards are placed in strategic locations along the walk, designed to catch the eye of the unsuspecting student and subliminally affect him. Personals are placed the Bruin and sandwich boards are the rule rather than the exception all over campus. The average student gets involved. A few days before the elections, those crucial endorsements come out. For if the Bruin, the BOC, the Greeks and the dorms support Josephine Bruin, Joe Bruin by all means should vote for her. But then the two days of elections come and the word on campus is \"vote.\" The important thing now is to \"get out the vote\" and show the power that the student body is capable of.

After, parties will be held for the winners while the losers return home to plot next year's campaign or do that reading for history they- ve been putting off. For Joe Student, much of his interest stops here, but for those elected, that end is only a begin- ning for them. SLC is the Undergraduate Stu- dent Legislative Council that meets once a week to decide how to allo- cate monies, solidify official government policies and resolu- tions, and discuss what can be done to make the students' life safer, more comfortable, and more stimulating. Yet the scope of involvement in student government exceeds the board itself. The inte- rest in student government and input has increased dramatically and the breadth of SLC's participa- tion is exceeded by no other Associated Students Association in the nation. There are various elected and appointed offices, com- mittees, volunteer programs, \"Student government makes a big school like UCLA | much smaller and more ^ exciting.\" | committee and campaign work. Fred Gaines, as president, had an enormous job. He acts as the offi- cial representative to the UCLA Administration, faculty, UC Re- gents, the State Legislature and the general public. He also presides at all meetings of the SLC, sits on the Board of Control and the Statewide Student Body President's Council. This year, Fred and his board have accomplished many projects that they started out to work on at the beginning of their terms. The Board of Control has finished preli- minary work on the pub in Acker- man Union, which the board has worked very hard to complete. ASUCLA has divested its funds from the Bank of America, who supported the government in South Africa, and SLC is now look- ing for a \"clean\" investment. Another project was lobbying for student housing, which has sent delegates to both the state and city governments for more and cheaper housing for UCLA students. The board is also comprised of three General Representatives, Bobby Zauzmer, Susan Schwartz and Michelle Goldberg, who state the views of the common student, the Community Service Commis- sioner Matt Gichtin, Cultural Affairs Commissioner Scott Roeb and David Neuman, Campus Events Commissioner, to name but a few. In all, the Board has thirteen students and five administrative personnel. Each officer heads an even bigger commission of stud- ents that collectively form UCLA student government. \"Student government gives the students an opportunity to make valuable contacts with professors and many of the top students in the school, develop leadership skills, provide some travel and allow one to work in an administrative and competitive atmosphere,\" states Sheila Hoffman, member of the Student Lobbying Council. \"It makes a big school like UCLA much smaller and more exciting.\" STUDENT LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL 1980-81 Officers Fred Gaines, President Lee Rosenblum, Administrative Vice President Sheila Bankhead, First Vice President Bobby Zauzmer, General Representative Susan Schwartz, General Representative Michelle Goldberg, General Representative David Neuman, Campus Events Commissioner Matt Gichtin, Community Services Commissioner Scott Roeb, Cultural Affairs Commissioner David Gurnick, Student Educational Policy Commissioner Karen Malmuth, Student Financial Supports Commissioner Alan Goldman, Student Facilities Commissioner Leslie Valentine, Student Welfare Commissioner Council Members Leslye Louie, Finance Committee Chair Rick Tuttle, Administrative Representative Richard Barthol, Faculty Representative Lindsay Conner, Alumni Representative Don Findley, Executive Director — ASUCLA Fred Gaines, President J \" cultural affairs a^ \\ -< N' ^ Commissioner Scott Roeb A3IBR0SIAI Sure you're a student; you're supposed to devour books, enjoy three-hour monotone lec- tures, and get into homework assignments. But did you ever want to pull your secret guitar out of the closet and land on a stage, or break away from the books and go watch a comedy show? Then Cultural Affairs can help you. \"It's the 'in' for student talent on campus,\" says Cultural Affairs Commissioner Scott Roeb. Located in 404 Kerckhoff, in coordination with the SLC and often the Board of Control or the Student Committee for the Arts, Cultural Affairs sponsors things from the display cases in Kerckhoff to spring noon concerts, and those insane and wonderful street entertainers you see wandering through campus- jugglers, minstrels, and even a quite authentic Shakespearean character who can almost quote MacBeth from cover to cover. \"Differing from Campus Events, Cultural Affairs is more student- \"It's the 'in' for student talent on campus\" oriented,\" says Scott, and it's true; 99% of the programs are free to students, and many programs involve student talent. The Coffee House, a main outlet for Cultural Affairs' efforts, sports free comedy shows featuring professional L.A. comedians on Kerckhoff's \"Monday Night Live.\" Student Performance Night at the Coffee House is when those secret guitars come out of hiding, and students also perform theatric drama and original comedy. Spe- cial events organized in the Coffee House this year were Theme Nights (such as \"Western,\" \"Blues,\" and \"Bluegrass\" nights), which were great fun for all who attended. Another effort appreciated by music-lovers are the major concerts organized by Cultural Affairs once a quarter. For example. Ambrosia visited Royce Hall in the fall. Also, C.A. works with groups such as the Black Student Asso- ciation, and the Student Committee for the Arts, to name only two of the several special interest groups that participate with Scott and his staff in coordinating fun and sometimes experimental events for students. \"The main goal of the organi- zation,\" says Scott, \"is to flavor student life on campus, and create a more diverse, fun college experi- ence.\" And college should be fun, too, right? J 47 student government involvement |?lfl,«»«f(' <•! I t's fall quarter, you're fresh out of high school and you want to jump right into life at UCLA and get involved. Your forte has always been student government, but how can a freshman become a member of SLC? It's possible, eventually, but student government is much more than the highly visible governing body of SLC. It's com- prised of almost five hundred students in varying capacities — from SLC, to committee chairs, to starting interns, and to volun- teers for programs such as the Community Service Commission. Almost any area a student could possibly be interested in can be found in the upstairs halls of Kerckhoff. To begin involvement, SLC has an open house that recruits interns for their various commissions and special projects. This orientation is the big push for active student involvement. After this, applications are filled out, and the commis- sioners form their committees, providing internships to approxi- mately 200 students, excluding those involved with CSC. After a year or so with the intern program, many people furthertheir interest in government. In the Spring, not only are SLC elections held, but the electees have various appointments that need filling, such as com- mittee workers and student repre- sentatives for BOC, Communi- cations Board, Inter-campus Ath- letics Advisory Board, Student Health Advisory Committee and the Student Parking Review Board. Who knows? If you're really ambi- tious, and build up enough experi- ence (and friends), you could someday be undergraduate presi- dent such as the likes of Rafer Johnson, undergrad president 1958-1959 and Olympic gold Medalist in 1960. SLC's sponsored programs range in great variety, headed in each case by the elected members of SLC. The president's office offers programs such as the UC and housing lobbies. The first V.P's office offers help to the special interest groups who are looking for interested students to represent American Indians, Asians, Blacks, Gays, Greeks, Chicanos and Jews. The Campus Events staff offers involvement in the speakers pro- gram, Ackerman movies and con- certs program. The Cultural Affairs Commission has the noon concerts and Coffee House entertainment programs. SEPC, the Student Educational Policies Commission, a growing office, is responsible for allocating movies and sitting on committees that deal with the 48 academic, classroom-teacher side of life. Student Welfare has pro- grams such as the UCLA Blood Drives and the Peer Health Coun- selors. And lastly, the Community Service Commission, perhaps the largest office in student govern- ment, makes available to the UCLA student opportunities to get invol- ved in the community. Work with the Latino and Asian communities, with inmates of juvenile correction institutions and with community workshops are only a few of the \"Student government . . . is comprised of 500 stu- dents in varying capaci- a'j ties.\" < \"• projects that CSC is involved in. Some of the higher positions are paid, but all are great for those resumes. Wherever the student's interests lie, there is a program for him in the student government. |f|i 49 community service commission What one student organization at UCLA can offer you an education in consumer affairs, enrichment through better commu- nity relations, and experience in tutoring and motivation? The Community Service Commission (better known as CSC) is the single source for acquiring any or all of these benefits. Through its \"splinter\" groups, over 1,000 students each yeardonatetheirtime and energies to many Los Angeles neighborhoods in need. The main office of the Community Service Commission is located in Kerchoff 408. Included In the long list of \"splinter\" groups operating under CSC are; 50 — AMIGOS DEL BARRIO Amigos del Barrio provides academic and emotional support for Latino students in primary education through tutoring and motivation techniques. —ASIAN EDUCATION PROJECT The Asian Education Project offers children who are Asian immigrants English language skills and provides them with cultural, social, and educational activities and opportunities. —COMMUNITY THEATER WORKSHOP The Community Theater Workshop emphasizes reading by employing Reader's Theater as an educational vehicle to enhance and encourage the student's individual academic, social, and personal growth. — CONSUMER PROTECTION PROJECT The Consumer Protection Project maintains a 24-hour hotline offering an informational and referral service for consumer complaints. Other activities include an out-reach program for senior citizens. —EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN'S TUTORIAL PROJECT The Exceptional Children's Tutorial Project addresses the need for special attention to children who are emotionally, mentally, and physically handicapped. —KOREAN TUTORIAL PROJECT The Korean Tutorial Project helps Korean high school students with English and other academic studies while encouraging them to obtain a higher education. —PROJECT MAC Project MAC offers recreational sports, creative dance, and other activities for children who are abused, neglected, and unwanted. It is designed to lift their spirits and offer inspiring new experiences. —PROJECT MOTIVATION Project Motivation provides Chi- cano/Latino high school students who are academically and econo- mically disadvantaged with en- couragement and motivation for pursuing an education beyond the high school level. —PRISON COALITION The Prison Coalition sends UCLA volunteers to juvenile probation camps to tutor and reinforce educational and social values forthe inmates. —STUDENT EDUCATIONAL EXPOSURE PROJECT The Student Educational Exposure Project helps Black high school students who are academically and economically disadvantaged by encouraging, motivating, and directing their steps toward higher education. —UCLA SPECIAL OLYMPICS UCLA Special Olympics is a program that builds self-confidence in children and adults who are mentally retarded by providing sports training and athletic competition.

Have you ever really counted how many checks you've written to ASUCLA? Unima- ginable huh! But believe it or not, those abbreviated letters happen to mean something. Associated Students of the University of Cali- fornia at Los Angeles; that's a mouthful to say, but did you know that you're already a member of this fine organization? That's right, every time you pay your registra- tion fees you automatically become a member.

The Association is made up of many different divisions— just like the military. Each has its own \"ASUCLA? What do those letters actually mean? No, they're not Greek!\" unique job to perform, with many people serving in the ranks. But, of course, like every organization in the forces, it must have a chief executive. ASUCLA calls its chief executive The Board of Control. They assist in policy making which, in turn, affects every person in the ranks. Below the Board of Control, the Association hierarchy begins with the Executive Director. He is the mediator between the Association and the Board. He must tell the Board the latest news of the activi- ties of the Association. This way the needs and demands of the ranks can be met. Next are the officers of the corps, or otherwise known as the Division Directors. They are responsible for the activities which occur within thier individual companies. Then come the Division Mana- gers; the sergeants of the ranks. They, along with their corporals, the Service Area Managers, make sure that each individual depart- ment is operating smoothly. Doesn't this sound like the military? There are seven divisions in this Association and each has a specific duty to perform. \"Mess Call!\" Food Services— they provide all that yummy food you gobble down in ten minutes before every class. \"Move 'Em Out!\" The Services Divison provides lecture notes, typing assistance, photographs, printing and duplicating copies, travel aid, or any new service in which the Association becomes involved. They do it so fast you can get to where you're going. \"Now Hear This!\" The Personnel Division, who handles all the recruiting and screening of all job applicants and oversees all the personnel policies throughout the Association, wants you! \"Yo!\" The Finance Division is there to direct all the financial administration of the Association. \"Atten-hut! \" The Publications Director functions as the Business Manager, as well as the advisor, for the independent ASUCLA Commu- nications Board which oversees the different newspapers published on campus. \"Front and Center!\" The Student Union Operations Division is responsible for the recreational facilities and all special events. There is some fun in the combat zone of school! And pulling up the ranks is the Student Store, which happens to be the largest division within the Association. The store is its own little battalion within the mighty force of the Association. \"At Ease!\" Now that you know what you belong to, it's pretty impressive. So, what are you going to say soldier when someone asks what ASUCLA means? Well, you can stand up straight, stick out your chest, suck in your gut, and hold your head high when you say, \"Associated Students of the Univer- sity of California at Los Angeles!\" \"Dismissed!\" m 53 board of control Call it the Board, call it the BOC, or call it The Board of Control; but whatever you call it, whoever you are, UCLA needs one. With an organization as big as ASUCLA, you need someone or something that has an understanding of the basic concepts of the Association. The members of the Board include three undergraduate stu- dents, three graduate students, two administrative personnel, one faculty member, one alumni, and the Executive Director (who is an ex-officio, non-voting member). All the members must know the history of the Association, its basic goals and objectives, its constitution, by- laws, and legal status, its current organization, its basic financial structure, the facilities under its jurisdiction, and its long-term plans. That's a lot to remember, but they learn it all so they can work in your best interest. The important thing to remember is that they are not trying to dominate the Association. They are there to assist and provide all the necessary knowledge that is needed to run an organization smoothly and efficiently. The Board has committees to specialize in specific areas of the Association. This way each area of concern to the Association can be looked over carefully. The commit- tee members stay familiar with all aspects of each assigned area. They establish criteria for assessing the quality of each area, they assist 54 in determining pricing policies, they study long-term needs for each area for Increased facilities service or product offerings, they communicate facts about the assigned areas to the campus community (all you have to do is read those facts), they discuss the problems and opportunities facing the area and assist in their solution, they receive input from other committees about their area, and finally, they review and recommend \"They do not leave a stone unturned when it comes to the Association — which happens to be yourself!\" policies relative to their area. They do not leave a stone unturned when it comes to the Association — which just happens to be yourself! At the end of each school year, the committees give a report of the activities and conclusions reached and presents them to the Board in writing. These reports contain recommendations and guidances for the next individual committee of each area. This way, ideas that have been generated can keep shining and possibly progress into some- thing that might benefit the Associ- ation. The Board of Control may estab- lish policies and where such policies exist, any action taken by the Board and management must comply with such policies. Most of the policies set by the Board are on a yearly basis, so you know that any decisions that the Board under- takes is not rash. Careful planning and much discussion go into enacting policy. Some of the policies the Board has exercised this year are the New Food Pricing Policy, the Key Priority Goals Policy (which gives students priority over faculty in areas such as post office boxes in Kerckhoff), Student Employee Discounts, and the most controversial policy which maintains that ASUCLA shall not continue a Principal Banking Relationship with a Financial Institution if either the Financial Institution or its Parent Corporation maintains a relationship with a South African Entity or if it holds as part of its investment portfolio securities issued by the South African Government. The reason for this decision is based on the situation between the government of South Africa and the Apartheid. The Apartheid are the oppressed black people of the nation that have (continued on page 56) 55 students' store: pencils, paper, (continued from page 55; no say in their government. It was the feeling of one of the Board members that ASUCLA should take a stand on this issue. But if you want to learn more about ASUCLA and the issues that confront it, go to one of the Board meetings. But plan to stay long because when it comes to the Association, the Board of Control is concerned about your well being. It's eight o'clock in the morning and the beginning of another day. But this is no ordinary day, no- siree-bub, it's the beginning of your adventures as an employee of ASUCLA's Student Store. Being an employee isn't as easy as it seems. There are places you should know, things you should see and questions you should be able to answer. One of the most popular questions is, \"Where's the bath- room?\" So before getting down to the nitty gritty (aka work) you must take Le Grande Tour! The first stop is the mammoth Textbook Division and General Books Division. Together they arouse the curiosity of any book- worm with their wide variety of reading material. From Shake- speare to Vogue— the reading materials in these divisions can stimulate the intellects of a wide variety of people visiting the campus. Remember when you first got here and you couldn't wait to get \". . .seven busloads of tourists had bought out all the shirts and shorts in your size.\" your paws on some Bruin wear? The Bearwear Division is the place for all true-blue Bruins. It offers a wide selection of items bearing the UCLA name. This includes class rings, adult clothing, children's clothing, gifts, and souvenirs. But when you went to buy your first real piece of Bruin clothing, you found ,^ lecture notes ^^m ■\\^- yrrl ■ 1 l^^l tl R'l] B \\m r K^iJ JH \"% texts, sportswear, bearwear. . . out mat seven busloads of tourists had bought out all the shirts and shorts in your size. You were upset then, but later you found out that the sales of UCLA insignia mer- chandise is the largest of any college store in the United States. Trail Mix, Texas Instruments, Calvins, Dolphins, and Pelikans round up the other sorts of items that make up the General Mer- chandising Division of the Acker- man Union Store. Not a day goes by unless one student or another buys \"zoo food\" (trail mix), punches in 7734 on the calculators in Elec- tronics, spends money on Calvins before paying the rent, runs to buy Dolphins in Men's Sportsw/ear, or writes with a Pelikan from School and Art Supplies. But where's the bathroom? Did you know that the Student Store has a facility South of the Border (aka Math Sciences)? It does! Really! It's none other than the Health Scier.ces Store. If you cut the store wide open you can find many interesting discoveries. They sell much of what the Acker- man Union Store does but with an emphasis on medical supplies and books. So, if you're ever down south, don't forget to drop in on your neighbors in Health Sciences. WARNING: Roaming the halls of Health Sciences can be hazardous to your health. The corridors are extremely confusing, so take one map and call a physician for help (continued on page 58) 57 students' store: (continued from page 57) immediately if lost or confused. \"Brrr, it's cold up here!\" But where else could you get the grade card you forgot ten minutes before your final in Dickson? The North Campus Facility— it may be way up North, but it offers the satisfaction of comfortable feet. What? Yes, comfortable feet, because you didn't have to walk all the way back to the Ackerman Union Store for those last chance items. But don't just go there for last minute selections— take advantage of the convenience it offers! Operations — This Division could be compared metaphorically with a medical operation. An operation is to correct and iron out the pro- blems in the body and also to make sure everything is running smooth- ly in its proper place. That's exactly what the Operations Division of the Student Store does. Each De- partment of Operations could be seen as a vital organ, a vital link in the big body of the Store. Each link has a responsibility that must be filled. The blood flows fast within the body and the operation is a success because the team works well together and the heart keeps pumping away. Still thinking about going into town to buy all those goodies that you've been wanting for a while? Well forget it! The Student Stores have everything you need. Besides you can't beat the prices! They sell everything direct to you at or below the suggested retail prices. What more could you ask for? Don't say an \"A\" in your chemistry class, that's one thing we don't sell here! Your first day at work is coming to a close and you've learned so \"Don't say an 'A' in your chemistry class, that's one thing we don't sell here!\" much that you don't know if you'll be able to remember it all. \"Don't worry!\" It will become clockwork within a matter of weeks. Oh! And where is the bathroom? Ask any employee, they'll know! J 58 ackerman union, north campus, med center. Have you ever eaten on campus? \"Of course,\" you respond with a reverberating confidence. But the next question is, \"Did you l<now that every morsel of food that is bought and consumed on campus is operated through ASUCLA?\" You ^ may respond with saying, \"Who gives a hoot?\" But the important point is that all those glorious candy bars, health foods, sandwiches. Cokes, Tabs, ice cream cones, salads, hamburgers and fries are brought to you by you yourself. Your reg fees have helped to erect over six eating establishments, not to mention the 17-odd vending machine conglomerates sprinkled across campus in strategic points. Ne'er a day goes by without the clink-clank of another junk food junkie reinforcing his habit at the (continuea on page 60) 59 food services: sandwiches, (continued from page 59) vending machines en route to his next class. When it comes time for some serious consumption, you have your choice of foods for the day— from Belgian waffles to sandwiches-by- the-inch and everything in between. Whether you find yourself in existential north campus or calcula- tor-ridden south campus, you can find a place to absorb some nutrition (on south campus) or relate to some organic veggies (on north campus). Now, to be more precise, let's take a look at these cosmic eateries. The Treehouse in Ackerman Union is the largest cafeteria on campus and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Here you can find a carved-to-order roast beef sand- wich and a make-your-own salad bar; the Truck Farm which offers fresh fruit and freshly baked specialties; La Quicherie with spinach salad, fruit flan and 25 different types of quiche; and one line of deluxe cafeteria fare. Adjacent to the Treehouse is the Sandwich Room where you can find low-cost traditional sand- wiches, along with Belgian waffles for breakfast and roast beef sand- wiches in barbeque sauce for lunch. The North Campus Eating Facili- ty, located near Bunche Hall, offers a full range of menu options including entrees, deli-type sand- wiches, a salad bar, hamburgers and french fries and special garden sandwiches. North Campus is open for breakfast, lunch and (guess \". . . you are merely eating at an ASUCLA food facility and not In the Twilight Zone what). . .supper. The Bombshelter Deli and Burger Bar near the Court of Sciences has an assortment of the best deli sand- wiches and salads. In addition, you can get hamburgers and fries or a genuine falafel for lunch. Gypsie breakfasts are served in the morning. Campus Corner is on Bruin Walk across from Meyerhoff Park. This is the oldest of the food facilities on campus and offers hamburgers, french fries, frozen yogurt and coffee, ice cream, the vending machines. . . pocket sandwiches which can be made to include a wide variety of concoctions. Kerckhoff Coffee House is in Kerckhoff Hall (for some strange reason) and is the home of Baskin- Robbins 31 Flavors Ice Cream Store and the Coffee House. The Coffee House is a regular night spot which offers live entertainment as a nightly attraction. These elements combine to bring forth out of the dark corners of campus the night people and groupies who come to the Coffee House to talk about things not unrelated to world affairs. And waiting in the woodworks (where the old Coop used to hang out) there will be (someday in the future) the Pub. This facility will cater to the 21 -ish students who are alcoholicly inclined or just like to be around beer-breath. The construc- tion of this certain-to-be-a- hangout - after - it - is - finally - built facility has been through a number of legal and materialistic (i.e. construction-like) hangups. But, take heart, rumor (and the Daily Bruin) has it that construction has resumed on the as-so-far-ill-fated Pub. So there is still hope for all the (continued on page 62) 61 ^'■^^/. comm board (continued from page 61) groupies at Kerckhoff Coffee House to be able to become alcoholically activated as a change from their current cafe addiction activities. So vi/hether it is a treehouse or a bombshelter, a coffee house or a pub — rest assured that you are merely eating at an ASUCLA food facility and not in the Twilight Zone . . . do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do . . . You may be interested in this further note about ASUCLA Food Services— they also provide a cater- ing and banquet service. And you know what that means — that's right, now you can bring campus food into your home! i^u The ASUCLA Communications Board is the publisher of nearly all the student media on the UCLA campus. The Communications Board (known as Comm Board) presides over the Daily Bruin, with a circulation of about 45,000; radio station KLA 83; the one-of-a-kind yearbook, the Southern Campus; and such unique publications as the Westwind literary magazine and the six special interest papers — Nommo, La Gente, Ha'am, To- gether, Pacific Ties and TenPer- cent. Approximately 83% of Comm Board's revenues are generated from advertising and the sale of publications. The Daily Bruin provides 64% of all Comm Board revenues with display, classified, and subscription sales. UCLA reg fees provide the rest, which is approximately $6 per student. The ASUCLA Publications office has advisors which provide com- plete logistical, administrative, training and technical support to the Daily Bruin and other Comm Board media. Have you ever heard about the radio station of UCLA? You know, it's hard to miss it (unless you spend your time living in a cave). KLA — the sound of UCLA — broadcasts to over 135,000 homes on Theta Cable. 45,000 homes hear KLA on 99.9 cable FM and the dorms can tune in at'83 on the AM dial. KLA is also played in Acker- man Union where you buy your books, play pinball and bowl a frame or two. Because of Theta, KLA is heard in many Los Angeles communities — primarily in the San Fernando Valley and Westside areas. The addition of 99.9 cable FM this year has more than doubled KLA's audience, making KLA the fastest growing radio station in Los Angeles. (Planned for this year — research on expanding to the regular FM band!) KLA is proud of its extensive kla record library, consisting of not only rock albums, but jazz, classical and soundtrack albums as well. A \"singles archive\" is also main- tained, containing virtually every popular 45 from the past 20 years. In the studio, KLA keeps over 1000 albums for regular airplay. Over the past years, KLA has experimented with many formats. Whether these formats focused on top-40 hits, rock album cuts, or new music, KLA has always offered an innovative alternative to the insipi- dity of many professional radio station formats. Presently, KLA stresses popular, established groups as well as lesser-known new bands. Acts such as \"X\", Oingo Boingo, and the B-52's can be heard, as well as established groups like the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin and the Cars. Proud of its extensive news and sports coverage, KLA keeps its audience informed. KLA subscribes \"KLA is proud of its exten- sive record library . . .\" to the AP news service, and has a large network of news beats. News and sportscasts are given every two hours, lasting approximately ten minutes. KLA news and sportscasts often include special reports and interviews. UCLA's radio station is able to provide a complete background in radio (incuding not only on-the-air news, sports and management, but also in commercial production). Each quarter, KLA holds open meetings in which UCLA students interested in radio are invited to apply for various positions on the KLA staff. KLA is one of the few self- supporting college radio stations in California. The station maintains a strict standard of professionalism with a staff of over 200. KLA provides a valuable background for students interested in the field of broadcasting by providing practical expertise in all aspects of radio. i^j 63 the daily bruin Many a student's day would not be complete without first skimming through the Daily Bruin. How could UCLA survive without its daily dosage of Bruin Review, Viewpoint, and the personals? But who knows what goes on behind those hallowed doors of the DB office in Kerckhoff 112 . . . 8:00 am. No one is in the office. It stands silent, dark, and empty, patiently waiting for the start of a new day. 9:00 am. The receptionists arrive, turn on the lights, the advertising staff opens its window for business. 10:00 am. The pace quickens. More staffers drift in and out. The phone rings occasionally. \"Daily Bruin . . . No, this is editorial. To place an ad you should call . . . No, this phone won't do transfers . . . Hey, I don't care if you're calling from Alaska, I can't transfer you ... Oh yeah? Well, I doubt that's physically possible, but I bet you have fun practicing on yourself . . . Yeah, same to you!\" The phone slams down. Things remain pretty quiet. 11:00 am. More people — including a few editors — arrive. Some writers begin to work on stories. Again, the phone comes in handy. \"Hello? Is Professor Johnson in? . . . Dm, do you know when he will be? . . . Three weeks? . . . Oh, I see. Acapuico . . . Well, I'd wanted to talk to him for a story, but I don't think . . . Yeah, thanks anyway. Stuart? Remember that interview I promised you? Do you really need it today?\" 12:00 noon. As usual, a protest begins in Meyerhoff Park. Students stroll past on Bruin walk, almost completely ignoring the noise. 12:10 pm. \"Frank, do you want someone to cover the protest?\" \"I dunno. What's the crowd like?\" \"Ten people, maybe.\" \"Hmm . . . Take some pictures. If we're short on copy, we can run a photo essay.\" 1:00 pm. Things begin to pick up. Most of the staffers have now finished their classes for the day. Typewriters clack, editors talk. Stories are due in one hour. \" 'Hmm. ..Take some pic- tures. If we're short on copy, we can run a photo essay.' \" 2:00 pm. Deadline. Half the stories are done by this time. The others are still being typed, written, or researched — or are just now being assigned. In spite of this, the editorial meeting begins. All the editors go into a room. Close the door, and do . . . what? Nobody knows. Some speculation: \"They sleep.\" \"They have orgies.\" \"They listen to Springsteen re- cords.\" While the editors are in their meeting, the office is momentarily quiet. 2:45 pm. The meeting ends. The editors charge out, ready to attack the job at hand. \"Tracy, where's your story?\" \"Right here, I'm almost finished.\" \"How long is it?\" \"Five inches, I think.\" \"Five? You told me twenty an hour ago!\" \"Well, I didn't have quite as many quotes as I'd thought.\" This, along with many other bits of bad news, is sent to Mary, the news editor. She is at the hub of the Daily Bruin's system: she lays out the pages. \"What? Only five inches? I dummied it for twenty! What'll I do? A picture . . . No, wait — we didn't assign one. Wait, I know! A cartoon\\ Clint!\" Clint, the Art Director, springs into action. \"Yes, Mary?\" \"Clint, dear, I need a cartoon- fast.\" \"You can't sweet talk me, Mary. You didn't even notice I polished my boots.\" \"Clint, dear, I love the boots. I'll kiss them if you want. Just give me a cartoon, okay?\" \"Well . . . alright. I'll try.\" 4:00 pm. From the news editor, the story goes to the copy editor, who rewrites it into legible English. He then sends it back to be typeset. \" 'How long is it?' 'Five inches, I think.' 'F/Ve? You told me twenty an hour ago!' \" The Viewpoint letters, sports stories, and Review commentaries on the futility of the exploitative capitalist system all go back to typesetting, too. 8:00 pm. By now, in theory, the paper has been typeset, and is ready to be pasted up (i.e. the copy, ads, and picture spaces are all pasted onto a white cardboard sheet, which is then photographed DAILY BRUIN ADVERTISING STAFF: first row: Howard Braunstein, Joni Greenberg, Wendy Beirman.

The night editor (a rotating job) gets to stay until 1:00 am, watching the pages get pasted up. Typical conversation between night editor and person doing paste-up: \"That line isn't straight.\" \"Yes it is.\" \"No, it isn't. It slants down over there.\" \"It's straight. Where's the ruler . . .

Sometime late at night, the finished pages are sent to the printer, who usually messes them up. If he doesn't, someone else probably will.

They host dinners and special cocktail parties and give tours around the campus to honored visitors. One of their most important jobs during athletic seasons is to greet in- coming teams and send off our UCLA teams to their away games: they also usher at smaller athletic events and are there at any impor- tant school functions that need responsible people to represent the student body. Bruin Belles are picked new each fall quarter, and is an excellent way to give service to the school.

They are students just like you and me who can give us the student's point of view on classes to take, teachers not to take, problems with units and just basic informa- tion of where to go to get more in- depth help. They are stationed all over campus from the Court of Sciences to Bunche Hall (as well as in the dorms), located for the convenience of the student. They are very personable people who are easy to talk to and who can empathize with the trials and tribulations of the student.

It is comprised mostly of fraternity men; however, it is not associated with the Greek system, thus it encourages non-Greek men to be involved in charitable acts. This year, the Blue Key men brought groups of underprivileged children to UCLA sports such as football, volleyball, and gymnastics. They ran a booth during Mardi Gras and held an \"All-U\" where the proceeds went to the Heart Aso- ciation. At the end of the year they have a formal dance to send off the graduating seniors and to celebrate the end of a successful year. J 73 international student center It's amazing how a student can attend UCLA for months and not know about such a fun and social organization as the International Student Center, located at 1023 Hilgard. The ISC is a place where students and professionals from West L.A. can get together and socialize; in the process, new for all concerned. The Housing Office is another service offered at the ISC; it is open daily and run by volunteers to help foreign students face the housing crisis and find a place to live. Social interaction happens at events such as \"Rap Sessions\" where newly arrived students can 'It's a great learning experience for all concerned.\" foreign students learn about American life while American students can experience the flavor and excitement of different cul- tures, not to mention new relation- ships and interesting events. The way the Center works: admitted foreign students are welcomed by letter to UCLA, then invited to participate in the diverse and helpful programs offered: for example, the Host-Family program which helps to maintain the family- like atmosphere which uprooted foreign students have left behind. The student spends holidays, weekends or other arranged times with host-families in the community and it's a great learning experience just talk about themselves or get to know Americans; students' wives meet other wives, professionals meet students and vice-versa, various ages all interact in a casual, friendly atmosphere. ALL students and faculty are welcome! What struck this UCLA student was the warmth and sense of comradery emanating from the place— the smiling faces, the people willing to listen and help. Other interesting programs include the Speaker's Bureau, where representatives of several foreign countries speak outside of UCLA, for instance at the Rotary Club, and various high schools. These expose mainstream white Mia Val9rt middle class persons to different viewpoints and help to broaden their own perspectives. There are also English Speaking classes daily and evenings where emphasis is put on practicing English conver- sation, obtaining volunteer partici- pation from the community, and better yet, the subject matter is open and unstructured so that foreign students can really get a feel for American life. It would be impossible to mention all the valuable and interesting functions happening on Hilgard at the ISC, but some closing notes here seem appropriate. Aiding the foreign student in the physical and psychological transition into academic and social experiences in our country is the major goal of the International Student Center, but by helping them learn to communi- cate, they reciprocate and enrich the lives of Californians with new ideas and exciting tales from other lands. Once again: ALL students and faculty and surrounding community members are welcome, so come together. J ^saA,\\ 75 The EXPO center is there to provide the student with the opportunity to gain an education, which is not limited to the campus — but extends beyond the campus, across the country and around the globe. So, what will it be — a blase existence on campus or an enlightenment in a European university? If it is an education you want, just remember that you only go around once and you have to reach for all the gusto you can get — and there is a lot of gusto off campus to grab — so go for it, Joe Bruin! expo center Have you ever thought about studying abroad? How about a \"Semester at Sea?\" Have you ever wondered how things really are in the US Congress, the state ■legislature or the city council? Have Throughout the year the EXPO Center holds orientation meetings for these various programs and it only takes an interest on the part of the student to become involved in them. If you are interested in going half way around the world or only up the coast, you can find the EXPO center as the best place to start. The EXPO center is located on the \"A\" level of Ackerman Union and is headed by Associate Dean Alexander White. \"Have you ever dreamed of representing a country in the United Nations?\" you ever dreamed of representing a country in the United Nations? Have you ever wanted to traverse the country with a fellow student? In fact, if you are interested in almost any off-campus learning experi- ence, you should be interested in the EXPO Center. The EXPO Center is the headquarters for all kinds of special programs geared to off-campus learning. These include the International / Washington / Sacra- mento government internships, foreign university \"study abroad\" program. \"Semester at Sea\" program, the Model United Nations, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program and the \"Ride Board\" for shared cross country travel as well as other exchange listings. 'l^il A'iKlt^W'^y I eKfD center, cpao/sr How much do you think you know about UCLA? \"Well, for one thing, UCLA is a big, imper- sonal academic university that is impossible to become involved in and, in fact, doesn't have much to offer other than studying at the library unless you're in a frat or a sorority. Right?\" Wrong! Have you ever heard of the Campus Events/Cultural Affairs related, they are all implemented with the assistance of CPAO/SR, which also serves in an advisory capacity for these events. Do you know what the Society of Hispanic Engineers, the Revolution- ary Communist Youth Brigade, the UCLA Prison Coalition and the Panhellenic Council have in common? Other than the obvious, these are all student organizations \"From the Alumni Association of Tsui Hsing High School to the Zen Studies Association, UCLA is bursting with organizations.\" activities? Did you know that \"Airplane,\" \"Carny,\" and \"The Great Santini\" were shown for free at Melnitz Theater this year? Did you know that you could have rented an original work of graphic art for the school year? Did you ever go to one of the film series presented at Melnitz or Ackerman Union? Do you know what all of these events have in common? Other than the obvious fact that they are all \"art/culturally\" on campus here at UCLA. In fact, these are mere examples of the 350+ student organizations on campus. That's right, from the Alumni Association of Tsui Hsing High School to the Zen Studies Association, UCLA is bursting with organizations. And you thought there was nothing at UCLA but libraries and fraternities! \"Well, what does all this have to do with CPAO/SR? In fact, what is CPAO/SR?\" I'm glad you asked. First of all, CPAO/SR (known phonetically as \"KAPOW!\") is the Campus Programs and Activities Office/ Student Relations. And it is the arm of the university that is concerned with all that I have mentioned above: cultural events, Melnitz Movies and Film Series, Art Rental Program and campus organizations. The mere 78 fact that UCLA is so big and that there are so many activities and organizations which are above and beyond the normal university programs (i.e. classes and lectures), brings in the need for a CPAO/SR. CPAO registers all organizations that function on campus and acts as a counsel to these organizations in developing and implementing programs and activities. The size factor (i.e. UCLA's size and the number of organizations) also requires a set of guidelines which each organization agrees to abide by; and CPAO/SR has the responsibility of interpreting these guidelines and enforcing them. The office is headed by Dean Rick Tuttle, who also acts as the Chancellor's representative to the Student Legislative Council. CPAO/SR has a staff of Associative and Assistant Deans, who act as \"consultants\" to the different organizations on campus, with each consultant specializing in a different area of activities (i.e. music, films, etc. as well as a Community Service component). Organizations are free to utilize the services offered by the office and, in fact, many do go for advice on how to cut through the bureau- cratic red tape that is involved in having an activity or program at UCLA. Whether it is holding a club meeting or planning a film festival, CPAO/SR is there to help the student community do more than just study in the library. So, what do you say — is the studying scene the only thing happening at UCLA? Maybe, butwhydon'tyou check into the organizations here at UCLA? Many people did at CPAO's annual Club Fair where some of theclubsat UCLA were represented in the Grand Ballroom — all open to prospective club members. Even if you are already a member of an organization, I'll bet you haven't participated in too many activities this year, so why don't you check into the CPAO/SR office and see if they can help you out. Come on Joe and Josephine Bruin, get involved! J 79 80 « c • c music In North Campus, where most of the Art, Motion Picture/Television (MPTV) and Drama courses are taught, one can see students rushing for classes while carrying a wide assortment of books, bags, portfolios, tape and video reels, and everything from a glass project to a set of leotards. It is here that imagination hatches into films, photographs, ceramic pieces, musical productions and new concepts in the arts. During the first few weeks of each quarter, students clamor for lockers while their clay is drying up or their drawing boards are getting tram- pled on in the stampede.
