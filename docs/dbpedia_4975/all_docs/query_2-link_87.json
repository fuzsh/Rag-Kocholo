Attending football games with friends was one of the most popular ways of spending time together. Suspended upside down, Mike Soohoo enjoys his time on the velcro wall. The center of campus was nearly always filled with various things to do or look at; whether it be flying onto a wall of velcro or shopping at a small booth. Imagine your first day at USC, whether it was nine months or three years ago, and consider the feelings you had. Some had traveled across the country or had crossed oceans to get here, while still others might have driven only across the city to find theirway to USC. Despite all the differ­ ences people brought Gerald Singleton with them, there was one thing that we all had 1ncommon. We all chose to be at USC. Different though our paths might have been, something lured us to this place. As each of us progress through this univer­ sity, we change and grow with the experiences we share. Yet one factor remains the same - All of us have connections that we have developed while here and that inextricably ties us to the school. (Con't on next page) __ O_P_E_N_I_N_G __ 137 Up ~ q.

In the past, some of the editions of El Rodeos have overlooked the human side of the uni­ versity and focused on events and things. However it is so important to acknowledge that people make this school what it is and this yearbook is dedicated to finding the per­ sonal stories that shape students' lives. The road trip across country with your best friend or the professor who opened your eyes to something new - these are the things that define our time at USC. It is not the football games, but who you went with and what you did that you remem­ ber. It is not the classes you took but the things you actually learned from your professors that matter. These are the defining factors of college life and these are the stories we present to you. Article by Joe Carmona.

This section is dedicated to all the aspects of school outside the classroom; the world where the most important learning goes on, learning about life and about people. The shared experiences that come from moving into a resi­ dence hall, of coping with the urban environment, or belonging to the Greek system foster the friend­ ships we hold valuable. These are the things that we will take with us once we leave. We may not remember too much about classes, but we'll cherish the amazing friends we made, the unforgettable ups and downs we had and the strength we developed from both broken and successful rela­ tionships. Student Life at a university is about making connections, not only those that will get you a job, but close intimate connections that mean some­ thing outside of school. Finding common ground with other people at this university is one of the hardest things to accomplish and the following pages look at occurences that bond us together as students. STUDENT LIFE Up~<:l- p~ Homecoming Important Continues To Be Part Of Trojan Family • \"As a Yell Leader, I was performing at the rally right before the game. It made me proud to see such great spirit and support for our school and team.\" -Spiro Preovolos, senior, Business Administration [I] ST~~IFE Homecoming Week is always a time of great cel­ ebration and enjoyment. The tradition began in 1924 with the commemo­ ration of the phrase \"Once a Trojan, Always a Tro­ jan.\" Today, the phrase still rings true in the hearts of students and alumni as they all gather together on Homecoming to cel­ ebrate their Alma Mater. During the 1950' s, Homecoming was cel­ ebrated with parades of floats, music, and danc­ ing in nearby streets. Al­ though the festivities have changed throughout the years, the spirit and enthusiasm for this week have not. Crowds of ani­ mated students gathered during Homecoming 1995 to witness the multi­ tude of events including games, free food offer­ ings, noontime concerts, dances, and more. In ad­ dition, Thursday night was host to the traditional Homecoming Rally at which the band, Song Girls, and Yell Leaders performed for a crowd of hundreds. The highlight of Home­ coming Week was the Saturday morning booths and tailgate parties on campus. Over 50,000 stu- dents, alumni, and fami­ lies assembled for the big \"Trojan Family Reunion.\" This was indeed a time to refresh the ties among all Trojans-past, present, and future. Junior broad­ cast journalism and his­ tory major Sam Smyth stated, \"I was so im­ pressed to see so many alumni and students re­ kindling old friendships and sharing in the pride of Homecoming.\" Famil­ iar faces of the near and distant past were bound­ less on this special day. Spiro Preovolos, senior, business administration said, u as a Yell Leader, I was performing at the rally right before the game. While I was stand­ ing on another Yell Leader's shoulders, I re­ alized as I looked around, all of Trousdale Parkway was overflowing with Trojans. It made me proud to see such great spirit and support for our school and team.\" Homecoming ended with a victory over Stanford after an intense game. Although Home­ coming 1995 has come and gone, the legacy of the Trojans continues to \"Fight On!\" Article by Reva Shakkottai. Overrun by students and alumni, the center of campus bustles with activity. There were numerous booths set up by various organizations, which offered a chance to interact with former and current Trojans.

Images of the riots played a huge factor in how many students perceived the area before they arrived here. Freshmen pick up their shirts the morning of the \"Fri.ends and Neighbor\" program.

STUD ENT LIFE A~tc L.A. Students Ponder the Source of Taunting Stereotype of the Spoiled \"It's the money involved. I think that just the fact that it is so expensive to attend. You have to be filthy rich. At least that's what I thought before I found out about financial aid.\" -Rizza Yap, junior, Journalism [ill2 STUDENT LIFE ~~? You've happily been ac­ cepted to USC, but now the taunting begins. You are now attending the University of Spoiled Children. Why are Tro­ jans subjected to the ste­ reotype of spoiled chil­ dren? The first thing to come to mind is the high tu­ ition. As a private institu­ tion, the estimate for one year totals $27,850 (mul­ tiplied by four plus an­ nual increases in tuition!). \"I think the tuition is probably high compared to state schools and people assume if students can go here, they must have a lot of money. How­ ever, being wealthy doesn't mean they' re spoiled,\" comments se­ nior psychology major Ruby Rubio. It is however, an easy jump when one sees a Lo­ tus in a par king lot filled with new Mercedes and BMWs. On the other hand, over 61.5% of the undergraduates receive some sort of need-based financial aid. In fact, USC distributed $160 million in financial aid last year. Several students also re­ ceive merit-based schol­ arships. Moving beyond fast cars and tuition, students also cite the large num­ bers who participate in the Greek system. Greeks, long identified as typify­ ing the party scene of col­ lege life, compose 20% of the student body. People perceive the members of fraternities and sororities as unfocused on educa­ tion and more concerned with their appearances, image and weekend trips. PIKE philanthropy chair, Trevor Luisi ad­ mits, \"the Greek system sort of sets itself aside sometimes\" and his $1,000 per semester dues can give the impression of being spoiled, but IFC president Brad Haas be­ lieves the Animal House stereotypes are a thing of the past. So perhaps it is all just a misperception. There are plenty of struggling stu­ dents who would agree with 1972 USC Law graduate, Michael T. Alexander, who states, \"If there ever was the idea of going to college to party, it is long gone. Going to college is deadly serious business.\" Article by Jen­ nifer Ozaki. • Cruising the campus with his friends, freshman Matthew Lieberman, cannot help but display the prestigious emblem of his \"ultimate driving machine. \" The high class image of the automobile does not seem to fit the starving student image, possibly providing a basis for the continuance of the spoiled stereotype. Conrad Hunziker III Relaxing in her College University dorm room, freshman Janelle Heley is free to play with her array of modern conveniences. While most students own a stereo complete with a collection of albums, a computer may still be viewed as a luxury of the rich and spoiled. Conrad Hunziker III Waiting in the long lines of the financial aid office, students have first­ hand knowledge of the myth of the spoiled child. The partying, spoiled stereotype may have been perpetuated in the past according to IFC President Brad Haas, but over 60% of undergraduates currently receive some type of finacial aid including grants, on-campus employment and low-interest student loans. Several students also receive merit scholarships. STUDENT LIFE ~~?

There were many events for dates back students to participate in throughout Troy Wee k. to 1926 when the Trojans first beat the Bruins on the field. The greatest prize from the game is taking home the famous Victory Bell. The bell originally be­ longed to the Bruins until the Trojan Knights stole it as a prank in 1941. Af­ ter being hidden for a year, it surfaced and an agreement was made to make it a trophy for the winner of the game. During Troy Week, an oversized, stuffed Bruin Bear was hung from high atop the Student Union Building. Due to the pro­ tests the stuffed bear was taken down earlier than usual. Some students felt that by hanging the bear from a noose, USC was promoting lynching and other forms of torture prevalent in the past. However, these protests did not affect the tradi­ tional \"Burning of the Bear\" rally held on the Thursday before the game. At the rally, Mike Garrett, John Robinson, and key football players shouted encouraging words and predictions to a crowd of over 2,000.

Spending your life in the architecture or fine arts studio for three days consecutively, or tack­ ing your review materials for a midterm on to a wall, and staying up all night with your friends throwing darts at which subjects you want to study provide our most compelling academic experiences. Academics are more than books and lectures, they are valuable experiences and adventures we have on our way to our future careers. ACADEMICS Up~q. p~ GIVING SOMETHING TOTHE COMMUNITY The Joint Educational Project, better known as JEP, provided students with opportunities to give some­ thing to the community and to get something back at the same time. JEP is a volunteer organization which works to make an impact in the immediate surround­ ings of USC. One of the most visible JEP programs was the placing of USC students within local schools. Partici­ pants are assigned to different projects according to their interests and depending on whether or not they are participating in JEP for classroom credit. Stu­ dents serve the schools in a number of ways, but primarily provide classroom assistance. \"I worked with kids one on one, helping them with their home­ work, playing games and giving them exposure to the English language,\" said Maia Fjelland, a junior Education major. JEP's involvement with the schools is an attempt to not only help the local community but to battle the fear and anxiety that comes from living in South Central Los Angeles. \"I was a little nervous at first, because I was going to a kind of school that I had never been to before, one that was in an urban environment,\" stated Fjelland. While JEP combats the anxiety of participating in the local community it is the personal memories that students take with them that make up the most im­ portant part of the experience. The various activities that the volunteers did make up their most valuable learning experiences. \"I was helping in an English as a Second Language class and I helped the kids prac­ tice for a talent show. They were singing 'Wake Up Little Suzie,' it was so great to hear them. I felt very good, very proud, excited after that,\" said Fjelland. Article by Joe Carmona.

Graduate students who are willing and able can be assigned as TAs in undergraduate classes in their field. This can mean anything from becoming surrogate teachers to just attending lectures and being available for consultation. The larger the class, the more TAs there are, and often, the more responsibility each TA has. Although most schools don'tkeepstatisticsonhowmanyTAsareworking at any given time, with at least one TA in most undergraduate classes, a substantial group of USC's graduate population takes part. Unlike many universities, though, it's rare for a TA at USC to conduct a lecture class on his or her own. Most classes combine professors' lectures with weekly discussion sections led by the TAs, who do anything from leading discussions on ma­ terial left out of class to grading papers and helping students review for tests. Because the T As have already, for the most part, been in undergraduate classes in their field, or at least in some field, they have a feel for the experience they can pass on to their students. Though most professors try to stay available to their students, often the TA can be the first point of contact. T As can often find themselves on constant duty as class counselors for students, from the struggling to the stellar. Often, a TA's input can be almost as important for a student as the class itself. A TA's life may rarely be easy, but it's almost always a rewarding (and tiring) experience for each graduate student who takes the challenge. Article by Nik Trendowski.

His story is similar to many international students at USC, coming from small isolated pockets of the globe, they travel to the United States for educational enrichment. Kang calls the U.S. a good place in terms of educa­ tional opportunities. In Korea, if a student doesn't go directly from secondary school to college, there are few chances for higher education later in life. \"In the U.S., you can do it if you try; (if you're) focusing on what you' re doing,\" Kang says. He likes USC because of its small classes, espe­ cially the professors who teach them.

For hundreds of years, teachers have been providing knowledge to millions of youngsters ev­ erywhere. What once was regarded as one of the most respected professions, teaching, has become one of the most stressful, burdensome, and yes, still gratifying careers available. Everyone knows the stereotypes about teachers: underpaid, overworked and constantly stressed. So why would someone want to be a teacher? Well, speaking for myself, when I sit in my CTSE (Curriculum, Teaching, and Special Education) classes, I witness every ounce of honorable idealism left in this world. A hundred college students all out to change the world, improve the realm of education, and basically learning to be the best teachers they can. We, education majors, love working with children and each have our own ideas on how to enrich the lives of our future students. \"I love the idea that every nine months thirty-five students will become my responsibility - that it is my job to guide them properly in various subjects,\" one education major said. \"I have the power to better these children's lives.\" The bright outlook that future educators possess is encouraged by the administration in the School of Education. It is one of the most respected and inno­ vative programs in the country. Unlike other majors that try to weed out the bor­ derline students, the professors and staff at the School of Education want the students to succeed and make themselves always available for advice, motivation and support.

Professors dedicate their time and experience to teaching students how to do a research paper and conduct research. Alicia Fernandez, an undergrad­ uate senior majoring in psychology stated, \"doing research is a great opportunity not only to gain valuable experience but also to know your pro­ fessors and the kind of resear:ch they are involved in.\" In order to attend graduate school it is preferable to have research experience. By having a directed research course you have the advantage of being well-known by professors who can help refine your skills and evaluate your potential. This is very important especially if you are thinking about applying for graduate school because it is those professors who know you and can write good letters of recommendation when you apply for admission. By being involved in directed research as an undergraduate student, you will become exper­ ienced in an area that is crucial as a graduate student; you will know what graduate school is all about. Undergraduate researchers help professors in all aspects of their work. From data collecting to col­ laborating, directed research is like a job - you have to go out and get information in order to do your work. Directed research is a smart way to gain the experience and knowledge professors have for undergraduates considering graduate school. Not only does it provide one-on-one training experience with well known professors, but it also provides a cornucopia of research areas that may influence your future expertise.

At the same time, many students who have done internships have found that once they get their feet wet, they' re doing meaningful work - some of the time, at least. Several resources at the university help students find internships and jobs. The Career Development Center lists opportunities and offers career counseling, and many academic units, such as the business and journalism schools, offer their own career development offices. Another option is the Washington Semester, a program that places students in offices in our nations' s capital while they attend a seminar and write a research paper. D.J. Crawford, a senior international relations major, was the student coordinator for the program this year after spending his semester in Washington working at the office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Crawford said paid internships add extra incentive to do good work but also increase expectations. Ryan Reed, a senior communications major, wrote a number of public service announcements during his honors internship, which moved from campus to the Weisman Hamlin public relations agency. His internship was unpaid, and he felt it gave him more substantial experience. \"If you get paid, you end up shuffling papers, but if you don't get paid, you end up actually doing work,\" he said. However, many students have found internships on their own. April Haitsuka, a junior majoring in print journalism, found an internship on the business desk at the Torrance Daily Breeze. Although she spent her first week going through press releases left over from several weeks when the newspaper had no intern, she started reporting a few weeks after she got her unpaid, two-day-a-week internship. Haitsuka said the experience will be essential if she wants to get a summer internship or a job later on. \"You need a connection or you need previous experience,\" she said.

ACAD EM ICS (~ BALANCING OUT ROTC AND ACADEMICS The University of Southern California represents an eclectic array of student bodies expanding their knowledge in various fields. One group however, not only balances everyday academic and social careers, but also learns the rigorous schedule of military life. ROTC students must juggle a heavy load of classes and military training, while trying to fit in a normal young person's busy social life. They experience a unique aspect of college life involving much more time and dedication than the average university student. What do the ROTC students gain from their experiences, though? Dexter Burlew, a senior majoring in ind us trial and systems engineering, says, \"You learn how to lead men while balancing college life. ROTC teaches time management and serious discipline. Also, professionalism and accountability play a big part.\" These men, and yes, a few women too, learn the basics of military life, what it takes to be a leader, and also participate in strict physical training, all of which prepare them for future military careers and/ or develop personal characteristics and tactics that will be useful throughout all of life. Unfortunately, there are some drawbacks to ROTC life as well. Students must awaken at approximately five in the morning on Thursdays for formation, and endure many hours of physical training. Says Burlew, \"The major disadvantages are the loss of sleep and time commitment. It makes balancing a normal college career very difficult.\" ROTC may not be for everyone, but for those who have a serious interest in what the program has to offer, it teaches things that a student might never learn in the classroom. \"It's definitely gratifying,\" adds Burlew. \"You really grow as a person.\" Article by Michelle Ovalle.

Tucked away on the third floor of Kaprielian Hall, the department of sociology goes about the business of studying social relations. Sociology is the study of groups and how they interact with one another and within themselves. Groups studied can range any­ where from families to large crowds of people. The strength of the USC department of sociology lies in the study of race and ethnicity, families, demography and crime. The presence of a strong faculty within these areas has led to valuable re­ search about these groups. Barry Glassner, the soci­ ology department chair said, \"we have some of the top teachers and research scholars in these areas and they are actively involved with students.\" The large degree of involvement that many of the professors demonstrate is translated to the students. Glassner said that there were more sociology majors and persons who took sociology classes participat­ ing in the Joint Educational Project than any other major. \"They participate in community organiza­ tions, schools and police agencies,\" said Glassner. There is no typical sociology student, because of the wide range of topics and issues that the depart­ ment addresses. There are many general education classes that students can take from the sociology department, ranging from Race Relations to Social Inequality: Class, Status, and Power. \"[Sociology classes] are a complete cross section of USC stu­ dents,\" said Glassner. The benefits of taking a sociology course or becom­ ing a sociology major are manifold. Glassner said, \"the main impact of sociology classes is that students come away with an understanding of social prob­ lems and with scientific, ethnographic research meth­ ods. They have sophisticated tools for studying so­ cial problems and social institutions.\" Article by Joe Carmona.

According to Dave Bowman, a Ph.D. graduate student of geophysics, the answer is, \"Absolutely not. It's a myth. In the 60' s, they developed the idea of plate tectonics and the continental shelf. People thought that it was an actual shelf that was empty underneath and could fall into the ocean.\" So with a laughing dismissal of that fear, earth sciences students are free to spend their time on other topics. In fact, earth sciences extends well beyond the study of earthquakes. \"It has a little bit of everything, outdoors, computers, physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, and you get to look at pretty rocks,\" explains senior Michael Salisbury. It is a tight-knit department of only thirty-five undergraduate and fifty-three graduate students. They attend most of their classes together and everyone goes by a first name basis. Seismology graduate student, Isabelle Wicks, recalls a professor correcting her by saying, \"It's not Dr. Paterson. It's Scott. I'm your friend.\" Despite the small size of the department, these students are studying one of the largest things, geological time. It consists of the earth's 4.65 billion years. Trying to gain some perspective, junior Joseph Barr looks to petrology, the study of rocks. \"I look at them and want to know what they are. The rocks at one time, were hot, molten liquid. It's just the whole idea of how we fit into the earth and how minuscule we really are,\" says Barr. According to senior Remberto Magbana, \"We' re just these really tiny things on such an enormous world. To the world, an earthquake is just a rubbing of elbows and we are just a ripple in a pond or an eddy in a current.\" While that may be so, students within the earth sciences department still persist in trying to understand the enormous scale and our place as humans within it.

In the last 111 years, the School has established itself as the pre­ miere music school of the western United States. The key to the continued success of the Music School lies in its high commitment to providing a comprehensive professional music program, with an emphasis on performance-based instruction. Over 800 students with superior performance ability join one of the program's seventeen different majors each year. The scope of these majors is intensified by the diverse cultural and musical op­ portunities in the city of Los Angeles. In addition, this year marks the first time the music business major has been offered. Jen Harmeson, who is en­ rolled in this major program, states, \"There is no better place for the new music business program than Los Angeles - this is where the record busi­ ness thrives.\" The School of Music takes the lead in producing live musical performances in Southern California. Over 500 concerts, recitals, and ensembles are per­ formed every year. Many of these performances are now broad casted on KUSC radio, thus adding to the listening range of these musical performances. Indeed, it is the distinguished and renown faculty that form the backbone for the high achievements and standards of the Music School. They are not only talented performers, but valuable teachers as well. For example, it is the guidance of the distinct faculty that has made the USC Symphony the best school orchestra in the United States. The School of Music looks to become bigger and better in the future. Dean Larry Livingston ex­ presses the School's dedication to helping students meet the challenges that lie in the future. He states, \"In this era of faster and more powerful technology, information is being shared instantly around the globe, thus bringing with it a great deal of depersonalization.

Classes in the SWMS department were designed to educate students about the women's and men's move­ ment, feminist theory and other topics that acknowl­ edge the accomplishments and contributions of women, that have traditionally gone unrecognized. The department tried to maintain its intimate na­ ture by limiting the number of students taking the SWMS classes. Even with the most popular course SWMS 210, the Introduction to the Study of Women and Men in Society, the enrollment was kept below 40 to foster an atmosphere that allowed and actually encouraged more group discussion. Many SWMS classes were in fact smaller. An ex­ ample was the Senior Seminar class, SWMS 410, offered in the fall. This class, having only six stu­ dents, did not meet in the formal classroom setting, but instead meetings were rotated to each of the student's apartments. This atmosphere promoted interaction and education through discussion be­ tween the students and the professor, Dr. Endesha Holland. This group even took a trip to San Francisco together to watch \"From the Mississippi Delta,\" a play written by Dr. Holland and nominated for a Pulitzer Prize . The department went through a change at mid­ semester. The interim chair, Amy Richlin was re­ placed by Judith Grant who will continue as the chair during the coming years.

Sports Illustrated and many f- others had tabbed the Trojans to win the national championship, and All-American wide receiver KeyshawnJohnson was being mentioned as a Heisman candidate. The team was returning numerous starters. All of the pieces were in place, and the only questions concern­ ing USC's first game, against San Jose State, was by how much they would win. As expected, the Trojans demolished the Spartans 45-7. Coach Robinson unleashed his two-headed quar­ terback by letting incumbent Brad Otton and strong­ armed Kyle W acholtz share time. USC's tailback by committee also proved that they were a force to be reckoned with. Led by Shawn Walters, the leading rusher for the last two seasons, the Trojan runners piled up yardage against an overmatched Spartan defense. The Trojan defense showed their strength as well.

The Trojan first string defense did not allow a touchdown for the second straight week. But what people will remember about this game was the offensive clinic. On the Trojans' first play from scrim­ mage, quarterback Brad Otton found Keyshawn Johnson on a 57-yard touchdown pass and USC never looked back. Otton finished the game with 223 yards passing and four touchdowns, tying a USC single game record for scores. The Trojans bombarded the Cougars with big plays the entire day. Tailbacks Shawn Walters, Leonard Green and Delon Washington continued to show signs of brilliance, and whenever the Houston team seemed ready to make a charge, the rejuvenated USC defense pushed them back. And so ended USC's non-conference schedule; a brief but exciting warm-up for the weeks to come. Article by Brent Weinstein.

USC traveled to Tuscon to play the Wildcats, a top-20 team whom they had humiliated at the Coli­ seum a year earlier. The match-up was the first conference game for both schools, and both teams came prepared. The Wildcat \"Desert Swarm\" defense, one of the top in the country, made its presence known early in the game. In fact, USC's first score didn't come until the second quarter when wide-re­ ceiver KeyshawnJohnson turned a two-yard hook pass into a big­ play score. On route to the end zone, the Heisman candidate danced around two defenders, then simply out raced the rest of the Arizona team to the goal-line. This game would be Keyshawn's 11th straight in which he broke 100-yards receiving, thus tying a NCAA record. The rest of the offense kept the pace for the entire game. The Trojans, using their multifaceted backfield, overwhelmed the Wildcats for the next three quarters, capped off by a 35-yard touchdown run by sophomore phenom Delon Washington. Once again, both Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz played well at quar­ terback for USC, proving a team can be a contender with two signal-callers. The defense continued to play stellar, holding Arizona and stand out quarterback Dan White to only a field goal for most of the game. The Wildcats did eventually score a touchdown in garbage­ time, but when the dust finally cleared, the scoreboard read Trojans 31-Arizona 10. After three games, the Trojans had allowed only 27 points, or nine points a game. This made them the number one scoring defense in the country, and it gave fans a much needed sigh of relief after years of questions about the Trojan defense. Many USC faithful made the five-hour trek to the Arizona Desert and came back fully satisfied. Probably the most memorable event of the game did not occur on the field or in the locker room, but in the stands. As the game played itself out, the rabid Trojan fans, filled with energy and spirit, chanted out the words that would define the rest of their team's season. \"THE ROSE BOWL. .. HEISMAN ...

With distractions involving three star players looming over the team, the Trojans were primed and poised to go out and show the nation how a national champion can respond. Respond they did. Delon Washington, in his first collegiate start, rushed for 120 yards and made believers out of everyone who thought the team couldn't operate without incumbent Shawn Walters. La Vale Woods had 62 yards and two touchdowns in what was his first real action in the Trojan backfield. Keyshawn Johnson, in a dazzling performance, had 171 yards receiving and a touchdown, giving him an NCAA record for consecutive games with 100 yards receiving. His most memorable play of the evening was, much like in the week before, when he took a simple hitch pattern and turned it into a 53-yard touchdown run. Along the way he made many Sun Devil players, including a former junior college teammate, eat dust and bite air in typical Keyshawn fashion. Kyle W acholtz and Brad Otton, sharing time once again, combined for 305 yards passing and two touchdowns. The two quarterbacks ended the week ranked one and two in the conference in virtually every statistical category, and were both among the nation's leaders in passing efficiency. Neither has yet to throw an interception in the season, and both look to see action for the remaining seven games. But in this game it was the defense that stole the show. Without starters Eric Herrin and Israel Ifenyani, Trojan fans all around were skeptical about how the USC defense would hold up against one of the conference's best passers, Jake Plummer. The Trojans did more than just hold up. The first-string defense had not allowed a touchdown all year, but still that glorifying shut-out had evaded the team. It was to come on this day when the Sundevils couldn't find a way to score. On numerous occasions, ASU had the Trojans back on their heels but the fired-up defense responded with inspiring goal-line and red-zone play. When the clock reached zero, the Trojans had won 31-0 and moved their record to 4-0. They had survived a week of turmoil and scrutiny, and responded with a resounding win. Across the nation, fans and voters began to take notice: USC football was back, and seemed destined to stop at nothing short of Pasadena on New Year's Day.

Their next opponent would be Washington State, a team they have dominated lately but was undefeated in league play so far this year. The game started out much faster than USC's pre­ vious five. The Trojans jumped on the scoreboard early with a 36-yard field goal, and then got a huge lift by second year wide-receiver Larry Parker. Parker, fielded a Cougar punt on the Trojan 37-yard line. After a couple of great moves, it was off to the races as he made it all the way to the 1-yard line before a hit jarred the ball loose. Luckily, freshman Mike Bastianelli pounced on the free ball in the end zone for a Trojan touchdown and a 10-0 lead. The game continued as Kyle Wachholtz found H­ back Jonnie McWilliams for a 8-yard touchdown pass. A few plays later, the stifling Trojan defense forced Washington State quarterback Chad Davis to ground the ball in the end zone for a safety for a 19- 0 half-time lead. Congratulating each other, Larry Parker and Mike Bastianelli walk away from a combined effort towards a touchdown. f6\"70 .---SP_O_R_T_S __ ~W~Su:,:te Julie Gargan Working as a unit, the defensive team members crush a WSU offensive player. The defense only allowed 43 yards in this game which was the best showing against the run this season. em a The Cougar offense picked up in the third quarter with a 12-yard scoring run. After that, Davis and his short passing attack kept the Trojan defense on their heels. A 4-yard touchdown pass to start off the fourth quarter made the score 26-14. With four minutes to go in the game the Cougars mounted a drive that re­ sulted in a touchdown pass from Davis, who would end the game completing 30 of 48 passes for 236 yards. The score was negated, however, when the officials called an illegal forward pass on the cougar signal-caller. One play later, the bend-but-don't-break Trojan defense batted down a Davis pass and USC took over on downs. While this game will be remembered for the near comeback by WSU, the effort displayed by the Trojan defense was phenomenal. Defensive tackle Darrell Russell put on a clinic, making six unassisted tackles, five for losses. The defense allowed only 43 yards rushing for the game and made Cougar players make comparisons to the Nebraska team they had played two weeks earlier. \"That was the best defense we've faced,\" said one player. \"Better than Nebraska's.\" Article by Brent Weinstein.

At this point, however, all the dreams of national championship and Rose Bowl berths were subdued. There were more important tasks at hand. USC was playing the Notre Dame Irish, a team that they had not beaten in 13 years. This was \"the year to break the streak,\" as read in the alumni newsletter and in many fans minds. Trojan fans traveled across the country to watch their beloved team take out over a decade of frustration on what seemed to be the hapless Irish. Unfortunately, the frustration would build instead of subside. On an unbearably cold and wet day at Notre Dame Stadium, the Irish once again whipped USC, ruining any hopes of a national title and drown­ ing the pride of Trojan fans for at least another year. USC was never really in this game. Notre Dame controlled the ball the entire time behind the strong running of fullback Mark Edwards, who would fin­ ish with three touchdowns and two extra point con­ versions. His first touchdown put the Irish up 6-0, and they would never trail. The Trojans got close on a number of occasions. Down one touchdown in the second quarter, USC seemed poised to score when running back Delon Washington fumbled on the Irish 4-yard line. After that, it was a rout. The tale of the tape for USC on this day was missed opportunities. Four times they were inside the Irish 10-yard line and couldn't get a score. On the other side of the ball, the Trojan defense couldn't stop the dominating Notre Dame offense, who seemed to run and pass at will. It became ugly in the fourth quarter when USC tried to get quick scores and ended up turning the ball over. Like they had all day, the Irish turned these possessions into quick scores, and when it was all said and done, Notre Dame had won the game 38-10. On the 100th birthday of the infamous George \"the Gipper\" Gipp, the Notre Dame Irish rose to the occasion.

Roy Nwaisser __ S_P_O_R_ T_S __ ~ Ncti,e D~ ~ After a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Irish, the Trojans needed to bounce back in a big way. Unfortunately, their next opponent was Washington, and Husky Stadium in Seattle is one of the most hostile environments in college football. With the Pac-10 lead on the line, both teams came out fired up. But as the game progressed, it seemed that the Huskies, coming off a three-year probation, were the more focused team. Using their two talented tailbacks, the Huskies drove USC up and down the field, and if it weren't for a few missed field goals by the UW kicker, USC would have been down by a much greater margin than the scoreboard displayed. The Trojans couldn't get their offense going for the second straight week. In fact, USC's first four possesions consisted of only 13 plays, three punts and a turnover. Once again, neither quarterback played well in the first half, and going into the locker room, Trojan players, staff, and fans were all looking down the road at the Rose Bowl slipping away before their eyes. Then came the halftime speech. Most players said they had never seen Coach Robinson so mad. None had heard him so loud. He stormed the locker room at the break preaching of pride, and dignity. He talked of going out and playing with heart and a championship drive. And what he said must have hit home some­ where in the players' minds, because the second half of this game belonged to the Men of Troy. This game marked the first where Coach Robinson broke away from his two-quarterback rotation. After switching signal callers in the first half, Robinson decided to stick with Otton who had been picking up some momentum for the key fourth quarter. Otton responded. After his first touchdown pass to Barnum, he orchestrated a great fourth quarter drive, eating up the clock and dampening the Huskies spirit. The drive ended when Otton found tight end Jonny McWilliams in the back of the endzone, with 44 seconds left in the game, for the Trojans third unanswered touch­ down of the quarter. Down 21-20 with the extra point to come, Coach Robinson said that there was hardly a decision to make. He decided to go for the tie instead of the win. A tie kept USC alone atop the Pac-10 standings, and he did not want to risk that lead on one three-yard play. Hence, Adam Rendon sent the extra point through the up­ rights and Husky Stadium went quiet.

A win was a must, and the players and coaches knew that they would have to find a way to regain their game. Unfortunately on this Homecoming Day, USC's game was as lost as ever for the first half of play at the Los Angeles Coliseum. USC fans were squirming for the third week in a row, and things didn't turn around until the Stanford punter fumbled the snap and was tackled at his own 9-yard line. Two plays later, Delon Washington punched in USC's first touchdown of the day. The second half began with Kyle Wachholtz at quar­ terback, breaking Coach Robinson's rotation for the second straight game. He responded like a true com­ petitor, driving USC down field and connecting with wide receiver Chris Miller for the two point conversion to put the USC up 25-24, their first lead of the game. (above) Swarming in on a Stanford player, the USC defense closes in. Trojan fans were celebrating in the stands when Stanford got the ball back with just a little over three minutes remaining in the game. However, the Cardi­ nal drove the length of the field and scored to go up by five points. Luckily for USC, the two point conver­ sion was unsuccessful, and they had two minutes to decide their future for New Year's Day. The final drive of the game for USC might be one of the most memorable of the season. By using a series of draws and short passes, the Trojans picked apart the Cardinal zone. The big play came when W achholtz dropped back into the pocket, looked off his primary receiver, and found his favorite target, Keyshawn Johnson, for an 8-yard touchdown pass to put USC up for good. After Stanford's last second hail mary pass was broken up, the Trojans ran off the field in wild celebration. In the stands at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, fans and players alike could smell the sweet scent of roses in the wind. Article by Brent Weinstein.

After so many years of domi­ nance, USC had fallen from the I f ~___,;~----- ranks of the national elite and were fighting an uphill battle. Three years ago, the athletic department brought in John Robinson, and vowed to return the glory to Heritage Hall. After his first year, the team lost to UCLA and was left with the Freedom Bowl. A year later, a mid-season loss to Oregon sent the Trojans to Dallas and a win in the Cotton Bowl. Now, after so many years of disappointment and heart­ break, USC had found its way back to Pasadena. And suddenly, everything in the world seemed right. The Trojans clinched a Rose Bowl berth by beating perennial Pac-10 doormat Oregon State 28-10, on a cold, rainy night in Corvallis. Leading the way for the Trojans was tailback Delon Washington, who rushed for a career-high 153 yards. He is now less than 100 yards away from becoming the first USC running back since Mazio Royster in 1990, to gain over 1,000 yards in a season.Washington scored on a 9-yard run on the Trojan's second drive to give USC it's first score, and would later seal the victory on a 1-yard 16811----S_P_O_R_T_S __ ~ FccttaU (above) Talking over a penalty with the official, the Trojans plead their case.

Kyle Wachholtz, in his first start of the season, com­ pleted 16 of 26 passes for 154 yards and two touch­ downs. On this day, though, it was the defense that stood above the crowd. After trailing 7-0, the Beavers drove the length of the field to the USC 3-yard line, when Eric Herrin blitzed and stole the ball from the OSU running back to preserve the lead. In the second quarter, safety Micah Phillips recovered another fumble, this one at the Oregon State 10-yard line, setting up yet another Trojan score. The defense held for the rest of the game, allowing only a field goal and a late touchdown after the game was decided. With the win, USC goes into the final game of the season 8-1-1, and 6-0-1 in the Pac-10. With a Rose Bowl bid clinched, and the season decided, the team can now look ahead to what everybody in Los Ange­ les has been waiting for all season long, the show­ down with the Bruins at the Coliseum. And while fans and players alike are happy and excited to be making their first trip to Pasadena in over six years, a victory over UCLA would make it all the better! In fact, no one seems ready to settle for anything less. Article by Brent Weinstein. Roy Nwaisser Roy Nwaisser Sprinting up the fie ld, Rodney Ser­ mons looks to outrun the Oregon State defense.

The annual game against cross-town rivals UCLA has become more than simply the greatest divisional rivalry in college football, it has become a one-sided massacre. After decades upon decades of dominance, UCLA had taken USC for the last four games in a row. However, no Bruin team had ever won five straight, and the heavily favored Trojan squad wanted to stop the losing streak this year on their way to the Rose Bowl. Unfortunately, next year's press run before this game will read, \"Bruins go for sixth straight!\" In a first-half flurry, UCLA ripped the heart out of the Trojan team and fans, who just days earlier had been celebrating the team's first trip to Pasadena since 1990. Using a clever and deceptive game plan, the Bruins beat USC with big play after big play. Whether it was the quarterback Cade McNown throwing a 68-yard bomb on the run or a wide-receiver throwing a touchdown pass, it seemed like Coach Terry Donahue, perhaps in his last season at UCLA, kept the Trojans off balance for the entire game. At the half, the Bruins led the game 21-7, and fans and players alike noticed the familiar pattern that the Trojans had developed over the past few weeks - getting behind early. While the team was able to bounce back and win against Stanford, and then come back to tie Washington, the Trojans ran out of gas in the fourth quarter and let the Bruins escape the Coliseum with yet another win. The Trojans did have a chance to win, however, but costly turnovers and poor tackling led to their demise. The Trojans lost fumbles on two consecutive offensive series, one of which was on the Bruin four-yard line. Then, with only a minute and a half to go in the game, and only down by four points, the Trojans collapsed on what could have been the turning point in the game. On third down and twenty, backed into their own territory, the UCLA quarterback was flushed out of the pocket. He seemed to be stopped, but proceeded to break tackles and worm his way past the first down marker. From there, the Bruins simply ran out the clock and left Trojan fans wondering, when will the pain stop.

But on this day, nothing else mattered. Forgotten were the streaks left unsquashed. No one complained about lost Heismans and national rankings. What the team would do on this day would define the season for the USC Trojans. USC's opponent was college football's biggest Cinderella story ever, the Northwestern Wildcats. Having reached a bowl game for only the second time, and the first in almost 50 years, the entire country seemed to have caught a purple fever. The game started out with a twist. Brad Otten, who would play the entire game breaking the two-quar­ terback rotation used virtually all year, ran the Tro­ jans' first series using a no-huddle offense. The drive ended in a La Vale Woods touchdown run, and sent a wave of enthusiasm through the Trojans. After allowing Northwestern and their star tailback, Darnell Autry, to drive the length of the field for a touchdown, USC answered with three consecutive scores. The first was a touchdown pass from Otton to fullback Terry Barnum, on a play that would affirm Barnum as one of the best receiving fullbacks in the game. Then, after a 30-yard field goal by Adam Abrams, cornerback Daylon McCutcheon returned a fumble 53 yards for a touchdown and a 24-7 lead. Then the Wildcats bounced back. After scoring a field goal to end the first half, Northwestern came out and put nine straight points on the board to narrow the Trojan lead to five, at 24-19. Then came the biggest play of the game. KeyshawnJohnson, who would set a Rose Bowl record for receiving yards, caught a short slant across the middle and turned it into a 55-yard touchdown catch and run. But Northwestern refused to die. After two con­ secutive touchdown runs, the Wildcats took their first lead of the game, 32-31. Then Abrams kicked a career high field goal, a 46- yard boom and put USC up for good. Safety Jesse Davis picked off a Northwestern pass on the next series, and a Delon Washington touchdown run sealed the victory for the Trojans. It was a Cinderella story versus a traditional pow­ erhouse. It had drama. It had flair. But most impor­ tantly, it ended with the right outcome. The win was USC's biggest in recent years, and it sets the stage for a run for the National Title in 1996. Article by Brent Weinstein. Sophomore runningback LaVale Woods covers some ground.

Those elements described the USC Women's Volleyball team led by seventh-year USC head coach Lisa Love. The leader of this year's volleyball team was team-captain and 1994 All-American Kelly Kuebler. As one of last year's most versatile players, she led the USC team in kills (377 for a 4.6 average, good for fourth in the Pac-10) and had a team-leading and conference-leading 4.0 digs average per game. Said Coach Love, \"Kelly has always wanted to be a bal­ anced player, and she brought this great leadership and a solid, steller game in all areas.\" Only a part-time starter in 1994, sophomore Jeanne Vetter had evolved into USC's \"do-it-all\" athlete. She contributed in passing, hitting, defense, and lead­ ership. \"Jeanne is by far the most versatile athlete on this team,\" said Love. Her current stats prove her versatility: 1.4 kills, 2.6 digs, and 0.6 blocking aver­ age. Against UCLA, she recorded 6 kills, 8 digs, 4 blocks and 2 service aces. Starting setter Monika Cavaliere was fourth in the conference in assists average (a team-high 12.33 aver­ age.) The senior setter became the single season total assist leader in 1995, setting a career-high 76 assists at Oregon State and 61 assists in a game against UCLA. Freshmen newcomer Jasmina Marinkovic was one of the biggest surprises of the 1995 season. The 6-0 Serbian middle blocker secured a starting position by posting a team-leading 1.4 blocks and 3.2 kill average per game. Her phenomenal performance had earned her the fourth-best USC single season block average in a season. USC's 1995 team had the desire and competitive­ ness to win despite the absence of last year's All­ American middle blockers Meika Wagner and Lauri Yust. Yet Coach Love is confident her team will have the ability to be just as competitive next year. \"We' re much smarter as a team - and much craftier,\" said Love. \"The players are better balanced and more talented and more experienced.\" Article by Richard Kim.

The team did all they could to accomplish this goal through an aggressive, fast break style of offense. Williams stated, .\"Our strength this year will be our team speed.\" The Trojans bolstered their ranks this year with the addition of two Croatian players. Drivers Simun Cimerman and Mateo Juric joined fellow Croatian players Hrvoje Cizmic and Marko Zagar as members of the Trojan waterpolo team. Zagar and Juric pro­ vided much of the firepower for the Trojans over the season scoring 41 and 50 goals respectively. The dreams of a national championship material­ ized throughout the season as the team battled for the number one position. Their struggle for the top rank­ ing in the nation was helped by the Trojan defeat of defending champions Stanford in midseason. With this victory the Trojans took control of the number one ranking and looked to cruise their way through the remainder of the season. However, an upset loss to Pepperdine in overtime during the latter stages of the regular season knocked USC from their top ranked position and left the Trojans to face cross-town rivals UCLA for final ranking before the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa­ tion Tournament. In a dramatic come from behind victory, the Trojans defeated the Bruins 8-7. \"I had confidence from the beginning of the game that we were gonna come back.

The Trojans headlined a summer in sports with their conquest of the West Regionals in Fresno, Ca., and the subsequent College World Series championship game loss in Omaha, Nebraska. It was the team's first College World Series appearance since 1978, when it won the national title. The trip ended with an 11-5 loss to top-ranked Cal State Fullerton. That experience was very close to being an abbreviated one. USC, ranked No. 2 in the country, lost to Miami on the first day of the double-elimination tournament, 15-10. USC next faced Oklahoma, and outlasted the Sooners, 9-4. After exhausting six pitchers against the Hurricanes, the Trojans received a much-needed complete game from Randy Flores.
