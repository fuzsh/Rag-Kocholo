Page)\n\nHaunting Ourselves in Her Words JOHN MOSS\n\nI IT IS INCONCEIVABLE to imagine a collection of short stories in English without Margaret Atwood’s\n\nrepresentation. It is highly unlikely a poetry anthology would exclude her work, whether it’s of Canadian poetry or a survey from Beowulf to the present. Any canon of the novels of our time, in genres as diverse as speculative fiction, parody, social realism, and historical metafiction, would include an Atwood title or two. There can be no consideration of Canadian literary criticism without allusion or deference to Atwood’s commentaries. There could be no discussion of Canadian cultural politics during the past fifty years that did not centre on the contributions of Margaret Atwood and her partner, Graeme Gibson. In any discourse on Canadian identity, she provides key terms of reference, maps and mirrors, reassurance and reproach. She has iconic status in Canada and she is our greatest emissary abroad, not because she is characteristically Canadian but because as a Canadian she is wholly herself, her work and her vision impossible to ignore. And she is an emissary of the world among us, showing in a turn of phrase, delineation of character, twist of plot, and subversion of generic conventions, how we connect, all of us to each other, if sometimes only through the differences that define us. For all that, how little we know her. Behind the authorial voice and the public persona, behind the cultural edifice is a woman of singular talent and drive and achievement. Perhaps it is the commodification of her celebrity that protects her. We know the name, Margaret Atwood, but the person, when she writes, writes alone—in a room, I imagine, teeming with voices and ghosts. We hear these voices as they filter through, the voices of literature, voices of the past, memories of bubble gum and great events; we see the ghosts of our literary forebears, the ghosts of our human trek through the ages, ghosts of our childhood, of our future, of our dreams. That’s what Virginia Woolf meant: all writers need rooms of their own, to hear, unimpeded, the voices and ghosts. And Margaret Atwood above all is a very great listener. When she plays on her own, the room is tumultuous. We could become lost trying to know Margaret Atwood. She lives like the rest of us in a labyrinth of libraries that interconnect, her mind a treasury of infinite possibilities. Unlike the rest of us, she walks through those libraries, along those corridors, plucking books from the shelves, shaping their contents for others to share. She has the gift to be everywoman and to be unique, to give us access to universal particularities through her words, shaped on paper in startling and memorable design. We know all about her, for she shares what she hears, what she reads, what she imagines and schemes; and we do not know her at all. II\n\nIn the twenties, Robert McAlmon gave his memoir of Paris the perfect title Being Geniuses Together. Margaret Atwood gave her most recent novel the unwieldy title Oryx and Crake. Interestingly, Oryx and Crake, after a while, seemed inevitable. As the novel embedded itself in the reader’s consciousness and in the public mind, it became wonderfully allusive. McAlmon’s title was the best part of his book. Atwood’s book has now made her title seem perfect. Margaret Atwood does this; she says things that, once said, seem inevitable. Her fiction, as well as her poetry and essays, displays that peculiar kind of originality that seems to coalesce our fragmented experience into coherent patterns that resonate inside the skull. Critics as critics are sometimes unnerved by her familiarity. Readers, including critics, find in even her most ominous and sinister writing something reassuring. For example, take “A Women’s Issue” (listed portentously in the table of contents of her Selected Poems 1966–1984 as “A woman’s issue”). The images are gutwrenchingly horrific; they are of abuses to women “we” all know about and try not to. In their rendering as poetry we are forced to confront them directly, but there is something profoundly positive in how she invites us, forces us, to share in the poem’s outrage, to recognize the absurdity of moral relativism, that sometimes culturally sanctioned things are inherently evil. Although our recognition of this means we’re not evil, it still means that we’re complicit. It is familiar territory: an unnerving blend of ambivalence and certainty.\n\nIII You fit into me like a hook into an eye a fish hook an open eye (Atwood, Power Politics 1)\n\nQuite possibly, Margaret Atwood dreads the thrill of three decades past, finding her open eye poem transcribed from raw nerves onto paper—it must haunt her like Earle Birney’s “David,” which became so much a signature epic that readers forgave him for murder, while the smashed and implacable David lurched through the years in pursuit, until Birney died. Who says it’s by our lack of ghosts that we’re\n\nhaunted? Birney said it, of course, in a poem, but he was wrong. We live in a world teeming with ghosts; however, we don’t always see them. Margaret Atwood apparently does. Reading her, we find ourselves haunting ourselves in her words. Much has been said and will be said about Margaret Atwood’s writing, about her themes and motifs and their ramifications; much has been and will be implied about the woman herself, based on research and gossip and perhaps on intimate insights through astral projection, but I would like to talk briefly about words. Most work on Atwood is concerned with what Saussure called langue; I would like to speak on parole. A brief sentence will do—to suggest how language in Atwood’s jurisdiction may incarcerate the reader and still set us free. On the front cover of a book by Alice Munro is a terse statement credited to Margaret Atwood: “These stories are real as kitchens.” Now, when I read that a generation ago, I felt I was in the presence of genius, perhaps more than one. And the interesting thing about “These stories are real as kitchens” is that I have no idea what it means. Well, I do and I don’t. I’ve been in kitchens and I’ve read stories, and I can appreciate the copula that binds them together. I am also aware of the differences on a literal level: phenomenologically, stories and kitchens are mutually exclusive. The terms of the equation are arbitrary, their connection both selfevident and absurd—but that’s their impossible alliance, that’s the hook. And we know about the startling efficacy of Atwood and hooks—how when you think you’ve caught the glory, you’ve also fished up something unexpected, like a drowned walleye with a ring in its gut, or an old rubber boot with the remains of a foot inside. The refusal of her brief description to settle into meaning excites the mind on a visceral plane. Of course you know what the words mean; these stories are as real as kitchens, it’s as simple as that. You just do not know how to put what she means into words; you end up repeating her words. They are your words, their meaning inside you assimilated as a quality of the thing she is talking about—kitchens and stories by Alice Munro, the equation between them. Atwood has invented the postmodern analogue: her statement is neither metaphor nor metonym; her stories are not like kitchens, nor are they kitchen-like. It is not a statement redolent with symbolic possibilities; it is not a trope of any sort. It does not invite interpretation. It is placidly hostile to what used to be called explication and is now euphemistically described as close reading. I have no more idea what her sentence means on a figurative level than on the literal. But the ineluctable Tightness of her analogue—its dazzling subversive resistance to rational explanation—is wondrously generous. IV\n\nI have been acquainted with Margaret Atwood for almost five decades, the first one from a distance as I listened to her read, back when we were young geniuses together. I think I remember her reading at the Bohemian Embassy in the early sixties, in Toronto, back when I was falling in love twice a month, and enthralled with her words, I wrote bad poetry in weak imitation. She might deny having read at the Bohemian Embassy. It doesn’t matter, my memory is not about to collapse from an excess of truth. Over the years our lives intersected now and then. I grew to admire this woman who has become strangely iconic, strange because she remains one of us, the slightly eccentric neighbour in the apartment next door who might be clairvoyant or simply is able to see through adjoining walls. And yet she is a formidable high flier, totally at ease in the grand circus of international literature. Something I came to realize was her remarkable generosity—generosity not only to readers but to causes, to friends, and to fellow writers. As years turned into eras, I discovered in Margaret Atwood’s contributions to the Writer’s Union of Canada and to Pen International, as well as in various other public causes whose sympathies I share, the stunning bounty of her sometimes obstreperous spirit. But what has been most exciting as her peer, in age if in nothing else, is having been able to follow the wondrously subversive and irrepressible social conscience in her writing as each new work appeared, and to recognize as I gained the soul and wit to appreciate such things, the evolving aesthetic of her creative vision. She has grown marvellously and yet, as Eliot observed about literature in general, this has not been a matter of improvement, for who would presume to improve on Surfacing or The Journals of Susanna Moodie? It has been a matter of shifting, refining, and developing, of keeping pace with her own and outpacing her readers’ maturing sensibilities. Teaching her work at the university level, I have watched as her name has become a rubric for what she has written, in the same way that Shakespeare and Austen stand for their canons more than for the man or woman behind them. “Atwood” means the novels and poems and essays, as well as the deftly deployed persona in the midst of public controversy, but it is also a label for feisty attitudes, a clear moral vision, devastating wit, and a genius for making words mean something. She has not fallen into the Hemingway trap, reprised by Leonard Cohen, in which the persona displaces the person, nor into the Virginia Woolf trap, reprised by Michael Ondaatje, in which the person appears as her achievement’s creation. The personality of Margaret Atwood is forthright and steadfast, while Atwood, the work, is a creation of remarkable and diverse complexity. I have taught Atwood to university students since the late sixties, sometimes in a context of Canadian literature and sometimes in courses on genre, courses shaped by critical theory, courses on themes in world literature, courses on Arctic narrative, courses on authorial subversions. I have never taught a course solely on Atwood but she has a way of dominating the courses in which she appears. This is because she has a knack for making the ineffable effable, for wringing the most astonishing meaning from\n\nwords, for conspiring with readers to share a moral perspective on even the most arcane or unimaginable issues (imagined, of course); she has the capacity to be succinct about the wondrously complex and to expose complexity in the apparently simple. She creates memorable lines and memorable images, she creates memorable characters, she creates memorable visions of our world as it might have been, might be, and might possibly become. And perhaps the most telling aspect of Margaret Atwood’s writing, from a pedagogical point of view: people love to talk about it. There is no other writer who connects to the reader on such a personal basis, on so many planes. She makes us more aware of ourselves. v\n\nI once said to Margaret Atwood that there is a strong postmodern tendency in her writing. She told me I was wrong. Being an academic I assumed she therefore did not understand my point. I now suspect she did. I have often been disconcerted to discover that she has my ideas before I think of them. Her denial of postmodernity was very postmodern. The crux of the postmodern analogue is not meaning but sense. It is this that resonates through much of her poetry, this refusal to explain that allows us to know, and it is in much of her fiction. Words are arranged; images, characters, and events are articulated in ways that refuse interpretation, invite speculation, and affirm the brilliance of her narrative and poetic imagination. They open, in the tension between various terms, the doors of perception, and the avenues in a private garden which fork and converge like Borges’ fiction, and shift like a staircase at Hogwarts, thus enlarging the reader’s life. To read Atwood is a creative experience, the reader finding herself, himself, caught up in creation. I have sometimes written about Margaret Atwood’s fiction and have written fiction about her. Her name provokes in me a deep desire to make things up, to tell resonant lies, to insert myself into parallel dimensions, some gothic, romantic, confessional, speculative, realistic; others psychological, moral, political, sexual, all of them originating in my reading of her polyphonous and multivariate canon. I want to transform myself into a character in something by Margaret Atwood, preferably a short story, but a poem or a novel will do. At the very least, I want to participate in making a book like this, where I can immerse myself in the words of some of the brightest, most imaginative, best-informed, and most engaged readers one is likely to encounter anywhere. The beauty of books is that desire and practice come together, as they have here, as we negotiate with the dead, the undead, and the yet-to-be-born.\n\nOpen Eyes: An Introduction TOBI KOZAKEWICH\n\nAS A POET, literary scholar, recipient of the Governor General’s Award (poetry), novelist, literary critic,\n\ncartoonist, social commentator, humanitarian, Guggenheim Fellow, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, recipient of the Governor General’s Award (fiction), Woman of the Year, environmental journalist, recipient of the Giller Prize, recipient of the Booker Prize, and inductee to Canada’s Walk of Fame, Margaret Atwood occupies vast terrain on the Canadian and international literary and cultural fields— terrain that extends beyond the parameters of W.H. New’s modest 2003 description of her as one of the foremost Canadian writers of the 1980s and 1990s. As New’s History of Canadian Literature makes clear, however, Atwood has long been a force with which her critics and readers have had to reckon, and reckon they have. Atwood’s novels consistently appear on Canadian and international bestseller lists, and on syllabi for Canadian, contemporary, and women’s literature courses both in Canada and abroad. Her oeuvre, moreover, has provided material for a wide range of literary and cultural commentators, both those who admire her work and those who find it provoking, at best. Her presence in—one could say dominance of—Canadian literary history is shown by the number of monographs that leading scholars have produced focusing solely on her life and work: from Sherrill Grace’s Violent Duality (1980) to the newest edition of Coral Ann Howell’s Margaret Atwood (released last year); from Frank Davey’s Margaret Atwood: A Feminist Poetics (1984) to Karen Stein’s Margaret Atwood Revisited (1999); and from Barbara Hill Rigney’s Margaret Atwood (1987) to Rosemary Sullivan and Nathalie Cooke’s 1998 critical biographies, The Red Shoes: Margaret Atwood Starting Out and Margaret Atwood: A Biography, respectively. There are, additionally, countless essay collections devoted to her work and innumerable theses on Atwood from Canada, the United States, Germany, Sweden, France, and China, among other countries. Yet despite the range of existing critical work, Atwood continues to surprise and challenge her readers. Her latest novel, Oryx and Crake, while in some ways expanding on the sci-fi story inset in The Blind Assassin and in others echoing the dystopic The Handmaid’s Tale, also marks a clear departure from her earlier, more representational novels, indicating the need for a cumulative and collective reappraisal of her life and, most especially, her work. That need was the inspiration for a conference on Atwood, originally proposed by John Moss, and was reflected by the overwhelming response to our call for papers, with more than one hundred submissions coming from countries in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. The essays in this book are for the most part a selection adapted from the “Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye” symposium held at the University of Ottawa in the spring of 2004, and although some very fine papers were left out due to publication exigencies beyond the editors’ control, we have tried to convey a sense of both the symposium’s international appeal and the breadth of interests that presenters addressed. What follows, then, is a broad range of approaches to Margaret Atwood and her work—a range that coalesces in fruitful ways. For example, a shared focus on Atwood as she presents herself and is presented, in Canada and abroad, appears in the essays that frame Part One of this volume: Laura Moss’s “Margaret Atwood: Branding an Icon Abroad,” Lorraine York’s “‘A Slightly Uneasy Eminence’: The Celebrity of Margaret Atwood,” and Sherrill Grace’s “Atwood and the Autobiographical Pact.’” These papers, while proclaiming at once Atwood’s centrality as a literary figure within Canadian letters and as a cultural figure within Canada’s national and international identities, also justify the close scholarly attention to Margaret Atwood that characterizes the essays in this book. Moreover, such implicit justification helps to clarify the role of this volume, and the symposium that inspired it, within a broader cultural and social context. As Laura Moss observes, in her capacity as “celebrity author,” Atwood “speak[s] across a range of subjects that illustrate the relevance of the arts in discussions of important topics such as good governance, citizenship, and civil society.” Moving beyond the mistaken assumption that “academic papers are written for academics” (as Paul Gessell had claimed in his column about the symposium), Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye foregrounds the extent to which concerns that we as scholars address resonate throughout Canadian society as a whole. Also emphasizing the relation between literature and culture, for example, is Renée Hulan’s “Eyes Wide Shut: Atwood, Bill C-32, and the Rights of the Author,” which, in considering the ways a public figure like Atwood works to shape legislative policy, touches on issues of concern to any person who has borrowed books from a public library. Eva-Marie Kröller examines Atwood’s role in shaping society through her focus on French Canada’s changing responses to this dominant Anglo-Canadian author in “‘Les talents de la voisine’: Margaret Atwood and Quebec”; Sandra Djwa delves further back into Canadian literary history to delineate P.K. Page’s influence on Atwood’s writing in “P.K. Page and Margaret Atwood: Continuity in Canadian Writing.” Coral Ann Howells similarly identifies key influences on Atwood’s writing, beginning her essay “Writing History, from The Journals of Susanna Moodie to The Blind Assassin” with the premise that “Atwood has always had a historicising consciousness” before proceeding to stress that Atwood does not always treat history in the same way: whereas early in her career Atwood draws upon history to record lost or under-represented experiences, by the 1990s, she evinces a scepticism about the way history “forg[es] links with a past that may be already forged.” Finally,\n\nusing Atwood as a case study into the nature of archival work, Robert McGill asks questions that bear not only on critical or even biographical scholarship but on historical research as well: how does the availability of archival material shape what we know and understand? And how does the archive itself delimit knowledge? Despite the body of criticism that Atwood’s novels have generated, the complex subtleties of her work lend themselves to a variety of approaches and interpretations. Part Two, “Earlier Novels” provides new perspectives on some of Atwood’s earlier fictions, ranging from Surfacing and Lady Oracle, both of which have been in print for some thirty years, through to Alias Grace, which first appeared ten years ago. In “‘Saying Boo to Colonialism’: Surfacing, Tom Thomson, and the National Ghost,” for instance, Cynthia Sugars undertakes a post-colonial analysis of Surfacing to uncover the ways Atwood both borrows from and impacts the national imaginary vis-à-vis the national mythic figures of Tom Thomson. “A Silhouette of Madness: Reading Atwood’s Surfacing” expands on a previous project by Tina Trigg and clarifies the ways in which “Atwood’s works implicitly criticize” the process whereby the reader as critic “becomes the analyst,” privileged and authoritative, capable of “dismiss[ing] the narrator as a mad figure.” Adding an eco-critical component to her reading of Atwood’s nameless narrator in “‘It looked at me with its mashed eye’: Animal and Human Suffering in Surfacing,” Janice Fiamengo connects the two kinds of suffering in an incisive analysis of the narrator’s abortion, that vital act that motivates much of the narrator’s selfexploration in the wilderness and ultimately serves as the measure against which readers can assess her growth. My own essay on Lady Oracle incorporates the notion of cultural capital, focusing on the production of Joan Foster’s celebrated book of poetry with a view to considering literary production within a larger—and gendered—social context. Tae Yamamoto expresses analogous concerns about gender in her essay about Atwood’s first dystopia in “How Can a Feminist Read The Handmaid’s Tale? A Study of Offred’s Narrative.” The final three essays in this part of the book all engage with Alias Grace. In the first of these, “‘Lurid Yet Muted’: Narrative and the Sabotage of Dissident Voice in Margaret Atwood’s Alias Grace,” Julie Godin explores Grace’s fraught participation in the construction of her own story, ultimately arguing that “Grace’s first-person ‘answer’ to the confessional framings of her story serves to catalogue and critique, but also to fulfil the cultural expectations that attend her self-revelation as a nineteenth-century murderess.” Drawing on contemporary psychology, Regina M. Edmonds construes the split in Grace’s subjectivity differently, conceiving of it as the result of a traumatized psyche rather than the manifestation of a conflicted or compromised dissidence, and, opening up the discussion to include other Atwood novels as well, Frank Davey’s “Atwood and Class: Lady Oracle, Cat’s Eye, and Alias Grace” posits the split as class-based, characterizing it as, among other things, a division in several of Atwood’s characters between what he calls a “Wordsworthian childhood” and a mature, socially determined symbolic identity. Ultimately, however, he complicates his own opposition, contesting the claim “about unconditioned identity that runs throughout Atwood’s writing,” seeing both identities as equally conditioned by class. In an effort to redress the comparative critical void regarding Atwood’s shorter prose pieces and her poetry, the book’s third section brings these genres into the spotlight. In the opening essay, for example, Wanda Campbell directs attention to the role of humour in Atwood’s oeuvre, focusing largely on Atwood’s shorter works since they engage with humour more explicitly than any of Atwood’s novels, except perhaps Lady Oracle. The following essay, by Pamela S. Bromberg, draws primarily on the essays from Negotiating with the Dead as it allusively teases out of Atwood’s writing an indication of the possibilities of narrative therapy. Subsequent essays focus more exclusively on the books of poetry, evidencing, in the process, the extent to which Atwood’s poetry simultaneously engages with the intensely personal and the openly public. The range here is remarkable: From Sara Jamieson’s insights into aging and identity throughout Atwood’s poetic canon to Pilar Somacarrera’s reading of Atwood’s Power Politics against Michel Foucault’s conception of the same; from Christine Evain’s interrogation of the relation between Atwood’s poetry and fiction to Rose Lucas’s deciphering of the subtext of grief, loss, and mourning in Morning in the Burned House, these essays insist that the diversity of Atwood’s fiction has its counterpart in that of her poetry. Reingard M. Nischik and Julia Breitbach open the generic field still further in their essay “Eye-Openers: Photography in Margaret Atwood’s Poetry,” and David R. Jarraway’s “‘[Com]ing through Darkness’: Atwood’s ‘I’-Opening Lyricism” theorizes Atwood’s construction of the self, the Other, and the self as Other as it moves toward a hopeful conclusion in which a larger, more sophisticated identity comes just into view on the other side of an apparently dark abyss. Appropriately, the last section of this volume of essays focuses on Atwood’s last two novels. Taking as her starting point a New York Times review of The Blind Assassin, Wendy Roy suggests that, perhaps ironically, it is the humanity of the female characters that is compromised in the novel, and not only by Atwood but also by a society that must “turn a ‘blind’ eye to women’s bodily experience”—including abuse —if it is to “maintain its conventional order.” Helena Hyttinen also posits abuse as a gendered phenomenon in The Blind Assassin and consequently reads its presence throughout the narrative as reflecting the novel’s participation in the genre of feminine gothic. Concentrating on Oryx and Crake, the final grouping of essays looks outward and ahead to consider where our present social trajectory might lead, and the prognosis is not good. Phyllis Sternberg Perrakis’s “Negotiating with the Looking-Glass: Atwood, Her Protagonists, and the Journey to the Dead,” opens this section with a feminist consideration of the way Atwood’s representations of corporality have changed in\n\nher recent novels, and Sally Chivers’s “Margaret Atwood and the Critical Limits of Embodiment” follows that lead, asserting that “the elimination of physical difference in Oryx and Crake … depends entirely on widespread investment in a normative bodily frame” and is predicated on the extermination of the “wider swath of human existence” that includes physical disability and variation. In “Frankenstein’s Gaze and Atwood’s Sexual Politics in Oryx and Crake,” Sharon R. Wilson offers a provocative interpretation of Atwood’s speculative world by suggesting that eradicating aggression could ensure our extinction just as surely as practising it could do, and Nathalie Foy, focusing more explicitly on feminist issues, considers what the gaps in Oryx and Crake imply about female sexuality and motherhood in particular. Hilde Staels examines how those gaps and absences impact Snowman’s humanity, and Michèle Lacombe calls into question the relevance of concepts like humanity and family in a post-human world. The final essay, Diana Brydon’s “Atwood’s Global Ethic: The Open Eye, the Blinded Eye,” recontextualizes the debate about the novel by foregrounding its separation of art and science and by calling for a more global view—one that sees with two eyes, not one, and can therefore validate both branches of human knowledge. Byway of concluding this introduction, John and I would like to acknowledge the support of a number of people who helped make the “Margaret Atwood: The Open Eye” symposium the success it was, and whose encouragement helped shape this volume arising from it. For advice and encouragement along the way, we are grateful to our colleagues in the Department of English at the University of Ottawa, especially Janice Fiamengo, Gerald Lynch, Seymour Mayne, Klaus Peter Stich, Cynthia Sugars, Lia Marie Talia, and Chair David Rampton. For facilitating Margaret Atwood’s presentation at “The Open Eye” symposium, we thank Jennifer Osti. And for financial support of this project, we acknowledge the grants we received from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, and the Faculty of Arts Research and Publications Committee, University of Ottawa.

He was at once a national historian, a cultural analyst, and a political commentator as he spoke unflinchingly and without irony of “we” and “us”: “We are down-to-earth people, rooted, as most people are, in the particularities of daily living” (Malouf). At Convocation Hall on the University of Toronto campus, Malouf interpreted the democratic life of Australia for a Canadian audience. It seemed incumbent upon him to make the kinds of comprehensive statements about his nation that he might hesitate to make at home. Malouf, in Canada, was speaking as a national icon of Australia. Malouf’s lecture reminded me of Margaret Atwood’s Clarendon lectures at Oxford. While Atwood demystifes the Canadian North in the four Clarendon lectures collected in Strange Things: The Malevolent North in Canadian Literature, she also approximates Gayatri Spivak’s notion of the “native informant,” speaking almost ethnographically about herself, her culture, and her people. Although the genre of the prestigious university lecture invites the positioning of the author as cultural guru, some writers play to expectation more than others. Margery Fee comments that in Strange Things “the lectures make it clear how nearly irresistible it is for colonials visiting England to play the colonial” (Fee 335). As she is an astute judge of audience and market, there is undoubtedly a link between what Atwood presents to a foreign audience and what she thinks they want to hear. Fee suspects that Atwood panders to what survives in the British … of the sense that Canadians are a rough-hewn folk struggling to survive in a snow-and-bear-covered landscape. Her defence is that an account of literary uses of Canadian urban life would be boring to her audience. (335)\n\nUn-boring Canadian literature in the Clarendon lectures is populated by the Wendigo, Grey Owl imitators, gallant exploring men, and linoleum caves. Going beyond the boring has always been important for Atwood. She speculates that “the beginning of Canadian cultural nationalism was not A.m I really that oppressed’ but Am I really that boring’?” (qtd. in Nischik 169). Sometimes avoiding the boring means acquiescing to expectation; sometimes it means bypassing some of the tedious details of debates that occur within Canada. As Atwood plays the role of international-national cultural commentator, she abridges some of the ongoing discussions in Canada and abbreviates their complexities for a nonCanadian audience.1 She is not at Oxford to mediate debates about Canada; she is there as a cultural ambassador of Canada—or Icon Abroad. She plays her role well. In this paper, I am interested in three interrelated ways in which Atwood and Canada are linked beyond the borders of the nation, as she situates herself as Canadian, as she is promoted as part of a Canadian global brand, and as she is read popularly and academically outside Canada. Atwood and Malouf are not alone as creative writers who (are called upon to) represent the culture, history, politics, and values of their home nations in foreign contexts. This is part of literary celebrity culture, the endowed university lecture genre, and the promotion of authors as cultural ambassadors abroad. In an age in which universities around the world are shifting funding emphasis away from the arts in the process of “businessification,” the endowed lecture has gained prominence as a means for public institutions to publicly display support and validation of the arts. The literary celebrity puts a human face on the university’s commitment to what UBC President Martha Piper labelled the “human sciences” in her 2002 Killam lecture. The celebrity author is asked to speak across a range of subjects that illustrate the relevance of the arts in discussions of important topics such as good governance, citizenship, and civil society. The author of international stature further helps to underline the degree to which the modern university projects itself as part of a global cultural community. The apparent desire of the university to highlight its commitment to the arts and to a global community is emblematic of a broader institutional desire to link artists and international relations. The Canadian government, for instance, is eager to capitalize on the popularity and economic success of Canadian literature and other arts abroad. A recent publication of Foreign Affairs Canada (FAC) entitled “Canada World View, As Others See Us,” packages a group of artists together as integral parts of “Canada’s global brand”: Filmmaker Atom Egoyan, multimedia director Robert Lepage, visual artist Jeff Wall, and author Margaret Atwood have made waves in Europe with individual, even quirky visions that are resolutely made in Canada. Such cultural figures are important elements of Canada’s global brand, one that garners recognition all over the world but particularly in Europe. On a continent so deeply steeped in the arts, Canada’s credibility in the cultural arena strengthens all aspects of our country’s international relations. (FAC paragraph 4)\n\nThe image of Canada branded for export to a continent so steeped in culture is one of quirky individuality that is still resolutely Canadian. If, as Naomi Klein suggests, branding is about promoting “not a product but a way of life, an attitude, a set of values, an idea”(23), it is also about selling a product and making a profit. What is FAC promoting through Atwood, Egoyan, Wall, and Lepage? What does Canada want to\n\nsell? The literal answer (films, art, books, and photographs) meets the symbolic answer (respect, economic growth, and political strength). Canada is branded as culturally progressive and yet firmly located in a national sphere in much the same way that the endowed university lecture helps brand the university as committed to sustaining the values of culture. Another publication, by the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, “Why Trade Matters,” reinforces the strong economic motivation behind the promotion of Canada though the promotion of art: Canadian authors, with their increasing high profile and international critical acclaim, could be described as Canada’s ‘other ambassadors.’ Through their writing, they bring a particular vision of Canada to the world, promoting an image of a dynamic, bilingual, and multicultural nation, (paragraph 2)\n\nAs one of the senior “other ambassadors,” Atwood promotes Canada promoting her books promoting Canada. It is a business relationship that is beneficial for Atwood and for Canada. Although Atwood states with characteristic bluntness that “I don’t work for the tourist board” when asked “Is it important to you in your writing to sort of promote the Canadian identity?” she does take advantage of the ways in which the tourist board works for her. The unnamed author of the FAC article focuses on the economic impact of Canadian literature globally, noting that “in 2002, the total value of cultural goods exports was 2.3 billion. Nearly half of this was publishing and printing products, with books representing nearly 500 million of this figure (paragraph 2).” The Canadian government’s commitment to “an image of a dynamic, bilingual, and multicultural nation (paragraph 20)” aside, half a billion dollars is big business. Although the article lists several writers (Margaret Atwood, Marie-Claire Blais, Nicole Brossard, Timothy Findley, Anne Hébert, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Alistair MacLeod, Yann Martel, Rohinton Mistry, Alice Munro, Michael Ondaatje, Nino Ricci, Carol Shields, and Michel Tremblay, to be precise), it highlights the role of Atwood as the most accomplished and celebrated of the list: “With her books in over twenty languages, Margaret Atwood is probably Canada’s most translated author. Her novel The Blind Assassin can even be read in Bengali and Farsi!” (paragraph 10). The global reach of Atwood, extending as far as Bangladesh and Iran as FAC points out, is in part due to the quality of her work, but it is also at least in part due to the way she is marketed (by herself, her publishers, and the Canadian government) as an ambassador of Canada and an integral element of Canada’s global brand, the way she performs the role with gusto, and the way she in turn is read as both Canadian and transnational. As an “other ambassador,” Atwood witnesses her country’s national narratives. In doing so, she comes to exemplify what I see as the paradox of transnational-nationalism. According to Jana Evans Braziel and Anita Mannur, transnationalism is defined as the “flow of people, ideas, goods, and capital, across national territory, [which] undermines nationality and nationalism as discrete categories of identification, economic organization, and political constitution”(8). However, paradoxically, transnationalism often relies precisely on the designation of individuals, often well-known cultural figures, to represent the nation categorically beyond its borders. This is clearly the case with the publications of the Department of Foreign Affairs explicitly naming Atwood as an important element of the international image of Canada it wishes to project. Atwood is both representative of a very localized, often rather neatly packaged, national identity and a global figure who is worthy of representing the local for the international community. As an “other ambassador,” Atwood is exemplary of such transnational-nationalism. The 1970s image of Atwood as a medusa with a razorblade in her mouth has been replaced by twentyfirst century images of her as the “first lady of Canadian literature” (Ferguson paragraph 2 and Queen of the Booker). As the British council website puts it, Atwood “is Canada’s most eminent novelist and poet, and also writes short stories, critical studies, screenplays, radio scripts, and books for children, her works having been translated into over thirty languages” (Holcombe paragraph 2). For the British council, she is not one of Canada’s most eminent writers; she is the most eminent writer. Although Canadians tend to avoid such absolutes, Atwood is still everywhere: locally, on the poster students put up outside my office door for the UBC student literary journal Rant: “churning out atwoods [sic] since 1918”; nationally, on the list of suggestions in the CBC search for the “Greatest Canadian” (although not one of the finalists); and globally, on hundreds of Internet web pages dedicated to her work; in newspaper articles by and about her; in megabox bookstore displays of her latest work; on high school and university course offerings in Denmark, Germany, Japan, Australia, England, the United States, China, and in Canadian studies centres around the world. More often than not, in the international references to Atwood, the word Canada and the Canadian flag are not far away. Atwood is not just an internationally recognizable icon; she is an internationally recognizable icon of Canada. Atwood is undeniably an important writer, one who experiments with a variety of literary genres and one who comments on a range of subjects from national identity to food to war. In Canada, however, she is often discussed with ambivalence. It is just not “cool” to enjoy the works of Atwood. German critic Caroline Rosenthal asserts that “much in contrast to the United States, Canadians often treat national icons with irony and self-deprecating humour … Canada ritualizes the non-reverence of national icons and the absence of a coherent national mythology”(50). As is often the case, as a cultural figure is elevated to the level of icon nationally and then internationally, other writers, thinkers, and speakers rebel at the simplification of having one artist’s voice paradigmatically represent many. Academic ambivalence to the icon further comes out in such statements as “if only Atwood were a better writer,” as one senior colleague said to me when I told him I was going to the Atwood conference in Ottawa. Popular ambivalence is well illustrated by Will Ferguson in an article for En Route magazine on Canadians whom Canadians love to hate. Ferguson suggests that it is part of the Canadian identity to want to unsettle an\n\nicon: “it is Atwood the icon that people resent, not Atwood the Feminist … no, it’s not anything as grand as her gender politics or as petty as the tone of her voice. It is simply the fact that Atwood has become an icon, and icons were meant to be—if not toppled—at least pelted by snowballs (paragraphs 6 and 9).” Beyond fulfilling the stereotype of a national distrust of iconicity, the ambivalence with which Atwood is almost always met in Canada comes from her position as Ur-Canadian beyond Canada. Outside of Canada, snowballs tend to melt and icons tend to last. An icon often begins symbolic life as an iconoclast.2 The challenging of accepted beliefs may be considered heretical, but if such challenging leads to a change in public opinion, or in communal conceptions of culture or art, a shift occurs where what was once considered iconoclastic becomes recognizably representative of an epoch or a nation. Subsequently, with the forgetting of the iconoclastic beginnings, the icon is emptied of a history and instead becomes something to be reacted to by another iconoclast. However, context is key. The trajectory from iconoclasm to icon sometimes stops at the symbolic stage of iconicity outside of the original context. This is the case of Atwood as an icon abroad. The iconoclasm of the “political manifesto” of Survival has been enshrined and subsequently rendered iconic in the international canonization of Atwood as the figurehead of CanLit. Atwood herself is clearly aware of the fluidity and illusory nature of iconicity. In answer to a question posed in Wollongong, Australia, about how it feels to have “spent a quarter of a century as an icon of Canadian literature,” she replied, “Well, number one, icons inspire iconoclasm; number two, I’m never around when I’m being an icon. It’s like the Virgin Mary: she’s in heaven, her picture is down here” (Canadian Studies Address 23). Self-comparisons with the Virgin Mary aside, Atwood has a point about the way that iconicity is not sought but thrust upon one. Atwood as national icon has followed the familiar trajectory—from iconoclast to icon. Donna Bennett and Nathalie Cooke argue that “[i]ronically, today Atwood in particular, and the writers of her generation in general, are seen as embodying the authority that they saw as external and inauthentic to their experience” (41). Such irony is the basis of the trajectory. Atwood is not alone on this trajectory in Canada. Think of the struggle of Emily Carr in the early part of the twentieth century to be considered an artist of merit. She did not paint the kinds of realist portraits of nature expected of her as a woman or as a Canadian. Indeed, she worked against what she considered to be the confining artistic conventions of her training in Paris, San Francisco, and Victoria. Carr was iconoclastic in her views on art, Haida culture, women, and family. Over time, however, and with the patronage of such an icon as Lawren Harris, Carr’s work has become closely associated with the West Coast and with Canada. The largest permanent collection at the Vancouver Art Gallery is the Emily Carr collection. Her images are available on magnets, T-shirts, and shopping bags. As with Atwood, Carr’s work is marketed as quintessentially Canadian. Carr’s art has also become the target of more avant-garde artists. In her 1996 installation entitled “A Group of Sixty-Seven,” Vancouver artist Jin-me Yoon reconfigured a terra nullus Canada by asserting the presence of Asian Canadians in the mountainous landscape as she poses sixty-seven figures who stand looking at a detail of Carr’s painting “Old Time Coast Village.”3 The installation is a powerful and important reconfiguration of the Canadian landscape to include Asian Canadians, but it also relies on using the work of Carr as a stand-in for a racist Canada. Carr’s own struggle as an artist, and the controversy over her representation of a vanishing and decaying Haida culture, are set aside in order to make a point about other kinds of struggles in Canada. Carr’s work is decontextualized over time, much as some contemporary literary icons works are rendered less complex with chronological and geographic distance. Carr’s painting is used as a cultural totem that stands in for a Canada that is natural and sublime—much like the iconic Canada associated with Atwood. In his chapter on Atwood in The Postcolonial Exotic, Graham Huggan discusses the literary star system by way of Pierre Bourdieu’s notion of cultural and symbolic capital (212). Huggan adds, “In Atwood’s case, we are talking not just about a consecrated writer but about a cultural celebrity” (214 emphasis added). His nine reasons why Atwood is so celebrated range from the fact that she is a powerful performer to the argument that she has bridged the gap between academic discourse and popular audiences. The most compelling of Huggan’s reasons, however, is that “Atwood’s image as a no-holdsbarred cultural commentator has been augmented by her international image as a translator and interpreter of Canadian culture. These images when taken together have fuelled the common (mis)perception of Atwood as a ‘representative,’ or even ‘quintessential,’ Canadian or Canadian writer” (214). As if providing evidence for Huggan, in Germany, Walter Pache writes that “Atwood has shaped our literary perception to such an extent that it is difficult to imagine how we might read Canadian literature and Canadian culture without her guidance”(133). While Pache is undoubtedly justified in saying that Atwood’s work is vital in the development of Canadian literature, his comment also raises some questions about the role of the author as, to use his words, an “institution” (133), a “public figure” (120), and a “public persona” (123), or to use the language of FAC, a “global brand” and an “other ambassador.” How much can or should an author (be expected to) represent a nation? What does it mean to be the quintessential Canadian writer? There is a tendency to configure Canada as reflected in Atwood’s novels as white, middle-class, and Ontario based. This reaffirms a notion of who is central and who is marginal in Canada, beyond what I think is actually the case. If Atwood is central, then Thomas King, Michael Ondaatje, and Joy Kogawa must be marginal. This is clearly not so. These writers are as central to the current Canadian canon as Atwood, but they are written about outside of Canada as marginal because they do not depict versions of Canada like the one associated with Atwood. In “Canonizing Atwood: Her Impact on Teaching in the US, Canada, and Europe,” Rosenthal outlines the results of a survey she conducted on the teaching of literary works by Atwood. She notes that in\n\nGermany, Atwood has been taught more than any other Canadian author (taught as a science fiction writer, feminist writer, and most often as a Canadian writer). In the United Kingdom, according to Rosenthal, Atwood is generally identified as a post-colonial or feminist Canadian, whereas in the United States, she is rarely taught as Canadian. Rather, Rosenthal irately notes that “she is often included in American Literature courses which simply interpret ‘American’ as ‘North American’ (whatever that means) and efface Canada” (48). What is interesting in this excellent article is Rosenthal’s insistence on Atwood’s Canadianness and even her anger at how Atwood is “made into an international American author by overwriting her Canadian identity”(48). While I understand that the outrage is based on a fear of American cultural imperialism subsuming the “best” of Canada and claiming it as its own, I also wonder about the implications of the German critic bristling at such a suggestion. Whereas Diana Brydon points to constructive ways of addressing such an effacement by drawing on the post-colonial notion of subaltern agency as she reads it in Survival, Rosenthal is reluctant to relinquish the Canadianness of Atwood’s work. Playing devil’s advocate, I wonder if there is also a danger in Rosenthal’s demand that the Canadianness of Atwood be front and centre. Has the branding of Atwood as Canada worked so thoroughly that when she is misrecognized the misrecognition of a larger sense of Canadian identity is also threatened? My own research into the reception and teaching of Atwood around the world leads to slightly different conclusions than Rosenthal’s. I looked at English course web pages and individual Canadian Studies program websites available in a variety of locations outside of Canada (Australia, Argentina, Brazil, China, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Scotland, Spain, and Wales) to see if Atwood is mentioned and, if so, to consider how she is read in association with Canada.4 While she is certainly not present on all the Canadian Studies web pages, if any writer is named, it is Atwood. The novels and poems offered in literature courses fall along a continuum that ranges from Canadian to Great. Often, Atwood is made to stand in metonymically for Canada (with reference to the recognizably Canadian works Survival, Surfacing, The Journals of Susanna Moodie, The Blind Assassin, and Alias Grace). Or she is read as a “novelist of our time” (or rather a “feminist of our time”) who happens to be Canadian.5 On non-Canadian Studies course web pages, and there are hundreds of them on which Atwood appears, Atwood is presented with an emphasis more often on Great than Canadian, under expansive versions of American literature, British literature, women’s literature, or simply contemporary literature (with reference most often to The Handmaid’s Tale and Oryx and Crake). Still, it is striking how much the influence of Survival is felt around the world even now. Many Canadian Studies courses begin with Survival to establish a theoretical framework. An article published in Germany nearly thirty years after Survival by Helmut Bonheim argues the predominance of “Margaret Atwood’s thesis that Canadian writing is about survival in a hostile environment: the typical subject of Canadian literature is a potential victim”(57). This version of Atwood is not in line with the prevalent view in Canada that Survival was important but is now outdated. Bennett and Cooke claim that Atwood’s early articulation of a valid and coherent Canadian literature in Survival is now “rejected” within Canada because “the nationalism of Atwood’s generation seems to speak neither to multiethnic reality of Canada’s cities nor to the current split between Canada’s traditional English-French solitudes. It seems, in fact, an ideal lost in a receding past”(41). While such nationalism is commonly rejected in Canada, it sometimes still holds sway abroad. However, another kind of updated nationalism associated with Atwood is also prevalent outside Canada. Such a Canada is not a nostalgic or melancholic desire for a unified national identity based on a shared sense of victimization but, rather, a transnational-nationalism. It is a kind of nationalism that exists concomitantly within a global framework. It is a nationalism that has consumed the brand of Atwood as an ambassador of Canada in the world. The flip side of transnational-nationalism is evident when Atwood is read as a writer who touches on “global” concerns that transcend national borders. The emphasis is on the transnational rather than the national. This is where the ends of the continuum of Canadian to Great become cyclical and Atwood is a Great Canadian global citizen. In exploring online responses to Atwood, I realized how much the reception and projection of Atwood as a national and/or transnational Canadian icon is dependent upon the subject matter and thematic focuses of her most recent novel. I compared a dozen reviews of The Blind Assassin and Oryx and Crake primarily in British newspapers to see how much the subject matter affects how Atwood is configured and which icon is drawn upon. In the Blind Assassin reviews, with the named Canadian setting (fictional as it is), the focus is on the Canadianness of Atwood, her biography, and the novel. Catherine Pepinster, in the Independent on Sunday to my mind hyperbolically illustrates an obsession with a nature-based Canada when she writes, “Canada also informed Atwood’s writing, from layers of its history enhancing her own sense of identity to its wide open spaces and its wilderness where she spent her childhood, steeping her novels in otherness”(23). With the reception of The Blind Assassin, Atwood is interpreted as an icon of Canada. She is the local author globally representing her nation. In stark contrast, in reviews of Oryx and Crake Canada is rarely mentioned. Instead, Atwood is presented as the prophetic writer of feminist dystopias—notably The Handmaid’s Tale—who follows in the footsteps of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley rather than of her etymologist father. With Oryx and Crake, she is a global icon. In these reviews, Atwood is dislocated from Canada and relocated as a global figure with what Rosemary Goring calls a “bleak, soul-destroyingly isolated picture” of the future. Joan Smith writes that if The Handmaid’s Tale is a warning about an “anti-feminist backlash,” then “Oryx and Crake is about another set of dangers facing the human race; with its genetically modified viruses, it is particularly resonant during the current SARS outbreak” (15). Smith’s emphasis on the human race\n\nappears to illustrate that Atwood’s fictional interrogation of environmental degradation goes beyond the concerns of a single nation-space. With the recent revival of discussions of nature under the auspices of eco-criticism and environmental studies, Atwood’s concerns about the devastating effects of nature forced into an unnatural state resonates with her earlier focus on land, nature, and wildlife in Canada. As the author of Oryx and Crake, Atwood remains a Canadian ambassador. It is no less part of Canada’s global brand to be the globe’s moral and ethical conscience than it is to represent wide open spaces of untamed wilderness and quirky individuals. Atwood is such a powerful icon of Canada outside of Canada because she can represent both the nation and the nation in a transnational globalized space. In the terms of cultural globalization, a literary icon like Atwood is a figure who personifies the paradox of transnational-nationalism. She is a figure who moves around the globe delivering lectures, selling books, reading poetry, and speaking on the affairs of her nation. As with the trajectory from iconoclast to icon, there is a shift from national to international icon that both reinforces and rejects the notion of the icon as an icon of the nation. Although I recognize the risks of using diaspora as a metaphor of global displacement and movement, there is an allure to reading Atwood’s texts, and even more interestingly Atwood’s iconicity, as diasporic subjects: moving away from the context of production, they are either read through a nationalistic lens of Canada or as emphatically transnational global subjects. There is a kind of diasporic connectedness with Atwood scholars, readers, consumers, and promoters. That is exactly what FAC is banking on. —University of British Columbia NOTES\n\nIt was with a clear sense of irony that I, a Canadian writing from within Canada, presented the original version of this paper about Atwood abroad at the Atwood conference in Ottawa to an audience of people from at least fourteen different countries. This subsequent paper has gained a great deal from the conversations I had at the conference with Atwood scholars from around the world. I am, however, still committed to thinking through the ways in which I see Atwood represented as a Canadian abroad. 1. In conversation, Sherrill Grace suggested to me that Atwood has long played the role of spokesperson for Canadian culture. Grace traces this role from the first-person voice in Survival through Strange Things to Negotiating with the Dead. 2. According to C.S. Peirce’s triadic taxonomy of signs, a symbol is “related to its object only in consequence of a mental association, and depends upon a habit”; an icon is “a sign which stands for something (merely) because it resembles it,” and an index is “a sign [which] signifies its object solely by virtue of being really connected with it” (qtd. in Adam 225–226). Ian Adam notes that “in general usage we often conflate indexes and icons—e.g. a moose doesn’t resemble Canada but it is seen as an ‘icon’ of Canada.” Similarly, although Atwood does not resemble Canada (or a moose for that matter), she has become a national icon. Indeed, the Lavin Agency, Atwood’s PR company, makes no bones about listing her as “Margaret Atwood: Literary Icon.” 3. Yoon combines the Group of Seven artists with the 1967 centenary celebrations in Canada, the date marked by some as the beginning of a new phase in Canadian nationalism. 4. My research assistant, UBC PhD student Kathryn Grafton, compiled the information on Canadian Studies websites available in English for me to draw on. I am indebted to Kathryn for all her hard work and valuable commentary on this paper. 5. In conversation, Gordon Boiling told me that he teaches The Handmaid’s Tale beside Famous Last Words and In the Skin of a Lion precisely to show the depth of Canadian literature beyond texts that realistically represent Canada.

Asked by an Australian radio host how her\n\nBooker win for The Blind Assassin (2000) would be received in Canada, she responded: I think that they will, on the one hand, be very pleased. And on the other hand, you know, Canadians are very good at coming second. They may also like to share a thing. There’s a wonderful line by our songwriter Nancy White, who says you can always tell a Canadian girl because if you ask her if she’d like some sex she says, “Only if you’re having some yourself.” And we do like to feel that … all should have prizes. So when one person is singled out, it’s a slightly uneasy eminence, (see ABC)\n\nThe “slightly uneasy eminence” that is the celebrity of Margaret Atwood is also arguably the condition of celebrity in Canada. This paper considers questions such as the following: Uneasy for whom? And why? In this nation, is celebrity, like the sex in Nancy White’s song, something no nice girl would ever admit to wanting? Students of Atwood’s work have only recently begun to examine the phenomenon that is Atwood herself: Atwood as literary celebrity. In this respect, we have been somewhat slow out of the starting blocks, for Atwood herself has been musing on stardom, and on variations of her own experience of literary stardom, for decades, whether in interviews, public addresses, or in her own fiction. Recently, though, Graham Huggan has devoted a chapter of his book The Postcolonial Exotic to an absorbing analysis of the stardom of Margaret Atwood (214). There, drawing on the work of French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, he characterizes her literary fame as “a process of consecration in which Atwood herself continues to play an active role.” He offers several explanations for Atwood’s success: first and foremost, her hard work, her expertise on several cultural fronts as commentator and critic as well as creative writer, her quotability and “epigrammatic witticisms,” and so forth. German critic Susanne Becker focuses on one of these contributing factors: Atwood’s response to and management of media discourses about her. In her article “Celebrity, or a Disneyland of the Soul: Margaret Atwood and the Media,” Becker offers a nuanced analysis of the way in which Atwood is able “to anticipate public demands and to counter rather than deny them” (33). Her unspoken assumption, however, is that celebrity is in and of itself a negative phenomenon: “the curse of celebrity” (30) that “precludes privacy” (38). Huggan, on the other hand, tends to see literary stardom as an intensification of ordinary processes of canon formation, and yet he draws on celebrity theorists who tend to see the formation of stars as culturally suspect, most notably the historian Daniel Boorstin who, in the 1960s, saw the phenomenon of stardom as one example of what he called the “pseudo-event,” an instance of false cultural consciousness. And there is something of the same aura about Huggan’s analysis of Atwood’s fame, however much he grounds his explanations first and foremost on the fact that she has, simply, worked very hard to gain her success. He argues, for instance, that the subversiveness for which she is often praised by her admirers is actually “negotiated from the safety of the middle-class family, the middle-class educational system, the middle-class home” (217). Whether those spaces actually are safe is a question that Atwood’s work persistently interrogates. My own analysis of Atwood’s celebrity shares Becker’s and Huggan’s awareness of Atwood’s canny interventions in her own media image, but it also tries to downplay the long tradition of seeing stardom as false consciousness. Instead, I want to consider the opportunities that stardom can open up, the possibilities it may present, particularly in the realm of public intervention. We can all, in this age of reality television, think of instances of stardom as false value, but what we spend less time thinking about is the possibility of stardom’s social efficacy. At first glance, it may seem absurdly out of proportion to understand a writer in terms of celebrity at all. After all, writers are notoriously private people, no matter how larger than life the persona of a Hemingway or a Mailer might be. The fact remains that the labour that gives rise to the renown of a writer is, except in the cases of literary collaboration or oral literatures, carried out in private. However, the parallels that exist among various manifestations of cultural celebrity are worth attending to; the similarities may outweigh those other, obvious differences. To begin with, our expectations about celebrity are, for better or worse, largely informed by the particular phenomenon that is Hollywood celebrity, to such an extent that we sometimes forget its cultural particularity. Not surprisingly, then, the growing field of celebrity theory has grown out of film studies, and it betrays some of the tendencies of its gestation: most notably, using film as a preferred site of analysis. And yet some theorists do appreciate that celebrity operates across institutions and media, forming no particular hierarchy. As Christine Gledhill notes, although “Hollywood has established the dominant paradigm of … mainstream … stardom,” stars “cross disciplinary boundaries” (xiii). Borrowing from the influential work of film theorist Richard Dyer, Gledhill concludes that a star image (or what Dyer would call a “star text”) is “an intertextual construct produced across a range of media and cultural practices” (xiv). A photograph of Margaret Atwood that appeared in the Globe and Mail in 2001, when she received her star in our very own Walk of Fame in the Toronto theatre district, acts as a visual dramatization of this theoretical point about the institutional mobility of celebrity. [Fig. 1]. Atwood is crouching beside a\n\nbeaming Joni Mitchell, both women pointing to their newly minted stars, a visual tableau of the institutional porousness of celebrity: writer and pop-folk singer-songwriter side-by-side. The caption punningly reads “Concrete evidence of fame,” and, for my purposes, the observation is apt. Songwriting, after all, like the penning of novels and poems, requires its own measure of solitude and intense meditation, and yet its institutional packaging seems so much more public: concerts, photo shoots, album promotions. Suddenly, though, these two Canadian artists, linking hands and pointing at their stars on the Walk of Fame, seem to share more than their obvious differences would suggest. The photograph is relaxed, charming even, and yet it discloses its own moment of cultural unease. Looked at more closely, the stars to which they point are, in fact, stylized maple leaves, a striking reminder of Atwood’s own words about stardom and the body politic in Canada: “when one person is singled out, it’s a slightly uneasy eminence.” Atwood and Mitchell are present on this occasion as remarkably successful women in their respective areas of cultural endeavour, but they are first and foremost present as representative “Canadians.” In fact, this morphed star-maple leaf seems almost admonitory in its collectivism: you, the individual, can have your stardom, it seems to say, but only if we, the national collectivity, are having some ourselves.\n\nFigure 1 “Concrete Evidence of Fame.” Photograph. Louie Palu. Globe and Mail (Toronto), October 20, 2001. A21. Accordingly, many forms of uneasiness can be detected in media representations of the celebrity of Margaret Atwood. For example, in a Chatelaine article that certainly carries a boosterish title, “Margaret Atwood takes N.Y.C.,” journalist Robert Collison observes, “for almost as long as she’s been an adult, Margaret Atwood … has been as famous as it is possible for a Canadian cultural figure to be” (100). As a formulation of praise, this encomium seems a lightly revised version of that old chestnut, “As Canadian as possible … under the circumstances.” Since celebrity tends to be confirmed both by America and by mass entertainment industries, Atwood’s celebrity is here rendered doubly uneasy. In media representations of Atwood that stretch over thirty-five years, a number of narratives about celebrity and uneasiness have taken shape. In the 1970s, Atwood and journalists interviewing her focused on the untoward consequences of her growing fame. Many of these stories have to do with Atwood becoming a type of visual spectacle whose collective ownership by the Canadian public was rapidly becoming invasive, disruptive of her privacy. One journalist, interviewing her in a restaurant near Alliston, slowly realizes that, while they’re talking, “a heavy-set woman at another table picks up her meal and watches as if Atwood were a television set” (MacGregor 65). As she told Valerie Miner on another interview occasion, “Sometimes I would just like to be able to walk down the street and have no one notice me. But people talk to me when I’m on the airport bus, while I’m taking a quiet pee in Eaton’s, when I’m walking down Bloor Street” (33). Ironically, of course, these comments reach the mass media as a result of that privacy having been broken. In the 1970s, at the very time that media coverage of Atwood emphasized the rupture of her privacy, it did so largely as a result of journalists being allowed the sort of entrée into Atwood’s private spaces that she has not felt able to extend in recent years. Theoretically and historically, though, invasion of privacy has been seen as a crucial precondition of stardom. As film historian Richard deCordova argued, the phenomenon known as “stardom” arose in early twentiethcentury North America as soon as “the question of the player’s existence outside his or her work in film became the primary focus of discourse. The private lives of the players were constituted as a site of knowledge and truth” (98). Celebrity, in fact, collapsed the very dichotomy of public/private; whatever representations of privacy made their way to eager fans were always already public, filtered through media and often through public relations people. Celebrity both posed and rendered problematic the question: What is a public individual? As this question gained momentum for Atwood in the 1980s, she, in turn, shifted gears in dealing with media, from a mainly defensive posture to an offensive stance. She realized that the advice she had been given about celebrity by a very public personality, writer Farley Mowat, was both wise and prescient. In\n\nthe wake of Atwood’s phenomenal success in the early seventies, he had warned her “Now you’re a target … and they will shoot at you” (qtd. in Atwood, “Survival” 54). Thinking about what Mowat had done in order to deal with this celebrity barrage, that is, to create a larger-than-life persona, she started to consider building herself one of her own. In 1976 she mused to Helen Slinger, “Maybe I should do what Farley Mowat does—construct a public persona that has nothing really to do with him. But he sends it out and he does his number, dancing on tables and whatnot, and everybody takes that as what he’s really like. And he, himself, is not bothered” (6). In effect, then, the advice was to become a moving target. She briefly pondered the option of giving up interviews altogether (Timson 60), an option that surely her publishers would not have greeted with much enthusiasm. And around the same time, the early eighties, she lived briefly in London. As she explained to another disrupter of her privacy, William French, “It’s just the price of fame. It was increasingly difficult to maintain privacy there, to get any writing done without being rude to people”(El). The late 1970s was a period of re-evaluation for Atwood, of testing strategies for dealing with fame. In the end, her own version of Mowat’s advice won the day, and she returned to Canada, continued to give interviews, but increasingly on her own terms and with a clear eye to protecting her boundaries and to policing both her persona and her privacy. Other commentators on Atwood’s fame have remarked on how well she handles the media to her own ends. Becker, for instance, argues convincingly that “she encounters—and uses—the publicity machine and the media business with superiority, dignity, and generosity”(29). Becker’s detailed analysis is perceptive; she maintains that “Atwood’s strategy to address, summarize, and thus control much of the media imagery about her” makes her able “to anticipate public demands and to counter rather than deny them” (32–33). I agree wholeheartedly with this assessment; preemptive critical strikes are an Atwoodian forte. She has assembled the most comprehensive list of media representations of her, and in the process of doing so she has, of course, skewered those representations: Man-eating Medusa, Ice Queen, Margaret the Monster, Margaret the Mother, and so on. This parodic performance of one’s own celebrity is itself a means of simultaneously distancing and confirming it. Looking, briefly, to film, consider the occasional tendency of film stars to refer to their own “star texts” or self-images. For example, Jim Carrey, in his numerous comic roles, often injects a moment of self-parody; when the character of his young son in Liar, Liar, for instance, capitalizing on his fath"
