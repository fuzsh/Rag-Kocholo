The eed coach is Andy Mclnnis .\n\nGroves was in Turin, preparing for World Cup races tomorrow and Sunday. Jeanty accepted his award early in the program as he and Carleton head coach Dave Smart had to catch a flight to Toronto for weekend Ontario University Athletics basketball games. \"It was a great basketball season for me and the team,\" Jeanty said. \"We won our fourth national university title and we grew as a team from the beginning. \"We had our 88-game (domestic) winning streak stopped, but we bounced back and showed how much character we had,\" continued Jeanty, who was honoured as the CIS male basketball player of the year, the CIS overall athlete of the year and was a CIS and OUA all-star in 2006 .\n\n\"To me, it was close to a perfect season. I never expected it to happen that way.\" Jeanty also was promoted to the Canadian senior men's basketball team last spring and summer and played in Italy, Germany and Slovenia. Smart, who led the Ravens to their fourth CIS men's basketball championship, accepted the male coach of the year award for the third time in the past four years. Pat Messner, who was named the overall athlete of the year in 1980, was selected the female coach of the year for her work with the Canadian adaptive water ski team. By winning the Canadian men's club, Open Canada Cup and Ontario Cup titles, the Ottawa St .\n\nAnthony Italia senior men's soccer side was selected the male team of the year. The Joyce Potter curling rink was presented the female team of the year award for winning the Canadian senior women's title and the world championship silver medal. Wes Kuran, a former president of the Ottawa Rowing Club and past winner of the Rowing Canada President's Award, was given the Mark Lowry Memorial Trophy for sport administration and volunteer work for his 50-year involvement in the sport The lifetime achievement award for a technical official went to Al Rae, a hall of fame basketball referee, who officiated at three Summer Olympics and four Pan-Am Games. In recognition of their development of sports medicine in Ottawa, Drs. Rudy Gittens, Don Johnson and Andrew Pipe received the Mayor's Cup, which is a lifetime excellence award for outstanding contributions to sport .\n\nBrian Kilrea, the most successful major junior hockey coach in Canada and a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame, was recognized with the lifetime achievement award for coaching. In the future, the trophy will be named after Kilrea, who is scheduled to coach his game with the Ottawa 67's tonight. Dave Schreiber of Team 1200, who is in his 33rd year on Ottawa radio and is deemed the area's voice of hockey, was honoured with the lifetime achievement award for sports media. If you place the athletic resumes of Kristina Groves and Osvaldo Jeanty side by side, you'll notice significant differences. Groves is a winter athlete, one of the top middle-distance long-track speed skaters in the world .\n\nJeanty is a four-season athlete, one of the best amateur basketball guards in Canada. Less is better for Groves as she aims to cut tenths or full seconds from her trips around international ovals. More is pleasing to Jeanty as he contributes points and assists to the Carleton University Ravens offence. Groves, 30, is starting the final quadrennial of her meticulously built career, which has seen her race 11 years with the national team. Jeanty, 24, will complete his Canadian Interuniversity Sport eligibility this season with Carleton and hopes the lane to a professional basketball career in Europe opens .\n\nBut there was one striking similarity last night at the sold-out 54th annual Ottawa Sports Awards dinner at Algonquin College where Groves and Jeanty were named the respective female and male athletes of the year. Dinner organizers passed out 12 major awards and also honoured 65 athletes in 60 sports as well as numerous individual and team champions at the provincial and national levels. It was a record-tying third time Groves was selected an athlete of the year by the Ottawa sports media. Groves also was the top female for her achievements in 2003 and 2004. The only other athlete to win the award three times was alpine skier Anne Heggtveit in 1955, 1959 and 1961, when only one athlete was selected as the city's best .\n\nThe dinner began honouring separate female and male athletes of the year in 2003. \"I was thrilled they (organizers) told me,\" Groves said in a telephone interview earlier this week from Turin, Italy. \"The first year my parents told me I won after they read it in the newspaper. I didn't appreciate it as much or have a chance to give thanks. \"I'm never able to be there (because of a conflict with the competitive season) and I wanted to say thank you.\" Groves, a silver medallist in the women's 1,500 metres and team pursuit at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and a four-time medallist at the world single-distance championships, corrected that this year in a four-minute thank-you video to the crowd numbering more than 600 .\n\nHer award was accepted by Jean Dupre, the director general for Speed Skating Canada. Groves spoke about her days skating on the Rideau Canal and at Brewer Park, and thanked the city for all of its support, even though she has spent the past decade training and living in Calgary. It was unfortunate Groves and Jeanty couldn't share their special moment together. nan Kant and bhankar Pre-makanthan, while the 12-mem-ber national women's team will include Laura Dowling and Malinda Hapuarachchi SOCCER Robinson joins Toronto Veteran Welsh midfielder Carl Robinson has signed a multi-year deal with Toronto FC. Robinson joins the MLS sion team from Norwich City of the English Football Championship, one tier below the Premiership .\n\nUEFA official resigns UEFA chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson resigned yesterday, less than a week after Lennart Johansson lost the European soccer body's presidential electioa Olsson had been Johansson's right-hand man both men are from Sweden but Johansson lost to Michel Platini in last week's vote. BASEBALL Bonds balking Barry Bonds is refusing to sign a revised contract with the San Francisco Giants after Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig rejected the deal over a personal appearance clause. The New York Daily News, citing a commissioner's office source, reported yesterday that the Bonds-Giants deal, a one-year pact worth $15.8 million U.S., was rejected because an appearance clause did not match league policy. Pirates add Armas to staff The Pittsburgh Pirates ended their long search for a right-handed starter yesterday, agreeing to a U.S., one-year contract with Tony Armas Jr. Armas, 28, was 9-12 with a 5.03 earned-run average in 30 starts with the Washing-tori Nationals last season .\n\nFIGURE SKATING Great day to have toe picks Skate Canada executives were all smiles when TV ratings for the Canadian championships showed 713,000 viewers watched the Saturday, Jan. 20, evening session on CTV. The pairs and men's free-skating finals drew more viewers than the second game of the Hockey Night In Canada doubleheader on CBC, which came in at 601,000 for Calgary against Edmonton. The first game, Toronto against Pittsburgh, topped the night with 1.283 million. AMATEUR ATHLETICS Quest for Gold a winner Well before any athletes have reached the podium, Ontario's Quest for Gold program has been deemed a success .\n\nThe provincial government announced yesterday it generated nearly $10 million in funding for amateur athletes in 2006. The amount nearly triples the $2.9 million in funding generated in 2005. The 2006 amount, generated through Quest For Gold lottery ticket sales, is the highest ever given directly to Ontario amateur athletics. FOOTBALL Bad day for Reid family A son of Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid was accused of pulling a gun on another motorist, court records show. Police later seized a shotgun and containers with white powder or residue from Britt Reid's vehicle and a pistol from the home he shares with his parents .\n\nOn the same day, Britt's older brother, Garrett Reid, was found with drug paraphernalia after his sport-utility vehicle collided with another vehicle, authorities said.
