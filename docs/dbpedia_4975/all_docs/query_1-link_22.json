The mathematician's playing with the roots of equations, a play which had no practical motivations and almost no possibilities of practical application, led to the recognition of the importance of symmetry and groups. The study of theory of groups led to mathematical discoveries in geometry and differential equations, and finally to prediction of the existence of a new elementary particle. Surely a surprising outcome for the ivory-tower speculations of an impractical mathematician! Despite my professional bias, I must acknowledge that the importance of symmetry was recognized before mathematicians invented the theory of groups. In 1794 William Blake wrote: Tiger, Tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? However, to the mathematicians must be given the credit of recognizing that, to understand symmetry, you must study the theory of groups. I can now answer my original question, What are mathematicians doing? They are trying to make precise the intuitions of poets.\n\nCalculating degree-based topological indices of dominating David derived networks\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAhmad, Muhammad Saeed; Nazeer, Waqas; Kang, Shin Min; Imran, Muhammad; Gao, Wei\n\n2017-12-01\n\nAn important area of applied mathematics is the Chemical reaction network theory. The behavior of real world problems can be modeled by using this theory. Due to applications in theoretical chemistry and biochemistry, it has attracted researchers since its foundation. It also attracts pure mathematicians because it involves interesting mathematical structures. In this report, we compute newly defined topological indices, namely, Arithmetic-Geometric index (AG1 index), SK index, SK1 index, and SK2 index of the dominating David derived networks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\n\nThinking Like a Mathematician\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWeiss, Michael K.; Moore-Russo, Deborah\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWhat does it mean to think like a mathematician?

The selected problems do not require advanced mathematics, making this book accessible to a variety of readers. Mathematical recreations offer a rich playground for both amateur and professional mathematicians. Believing that creative stimuli and aesthetic considerations are closely related, great mathematicians from ancient times to the present have always taken an interest in puzzles and diversions.

Study 1 administered the Attributional Complexity Scale, a measure of social acuity, to female and male faculty members and graduate students in four Midwestern schools. Atlrihutional complexity (AC) is the ability and motivation to give complex explanations for behavior. Study 1 found a significant interaction between field and gender. Only among women did mathematicians score lower on AC. In addition, an established gender difference in AC (that women score higher than men) was present only among nonmathematicians. Studies 2 and 3 offered some preliminary support for the possibility that it is generally female students who score tow on AC who aspire to he mathematicians and for the underlying view that female students' perceived similarity to mathematicians can influence their vocational choices.\n\nThe Albanian Mathematicians by the Flowside of the Mathematicians of the World\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nKllogjeri, Pellumb\n\n2014-01-01\n\nI have had opportunities to see several world enciclopedies but I have found none of the Albanian mathematicians. Sure, can be found some great historical figures of Albania from the ancient world to the present time, even the names of cruel persons(this is ridicilous). But, how is it possible that no name of an Albanian mathematician is there? Does someone think that all that mathematical seed sown in Albania in different times, in different ways and by different sowers is dried out?

M.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nWhen I was asked to give a talk here, being just a mathematician among the distinguished array of physicists invited to speak, I had great hesitation. Then it occurred to me, if Viki Weisskopf can conduct a symphony orchestra, maybe I can talk about physics. I felt consoled until yesterday evening when I discovered that he is a professional, and so I feel very, hesitant again. My title, \"Physics for Mathematicians\", will almost mean physics without mathematics. My interest is really to paraphrase a famous statement, not what mathematics can do for physics, but what physics can do for mathematics. That is the underlying motive...\n\nOn mathematicians' different standards when evaluating elementary proofs.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nInglis, Matthew; Mejia-Ramos, Juan Pablo; Weber, Keith; Alcock, Lara\n\n2013-04-01\n\nIn this article, we report a study in which 109 research-active mathematicians were asked to judge the validity of a purported proof in undergraduate calculus. Significant results from our study were as follows: (a) there was substantial disagreement among mathematicians regarding whether the argument was a valid proof, (b) applied mathematicians were more likely than pure mathematicians to judge the argument valid, (c) participants who judged the argument invalid were more confident in their judgments than those who judged it valid, and (d) participants who judged the argument valid usually did not change their judgment when presented with a reason raised by other mathematicians for why the proof should be judged invalid. These findings suggest that, contrary to some claims in the literature, there is not a single standard of validity among contemporary mathematicians.

Answers to this and other questions are found in this exciting new resource that shows your students how 60 mathematicians discovered mathematical solutions through everyday situations. These lessons are easily incorporated into the present curriculum as an introduction to a math concept, a homework piece, or an extra challenge. Teacher notes and suggestions for the classroom are followed by extension problems and additional background material. This is a great way to spark student interest in math.

Elena Nardi employs fictional characters to create a conversation on these important issues. While personas are created, the facts incorporated into their stories are based on large bodies of data including intense focus groups comprised of mathematicians and mathematics education.This book further develops analyses of the data and demonstrates the pedagogical potential that lies in collaborative research that engages educators, researchers, and students in undergraduate mathematics education. Nardi also addresses the need for action in undergraduate mathematics education by creating discourse for reform and demonstrating the feasibility and potential of collaboration between mathematicians and researchers. \"Amongst Mathematicians\" is of interest to the entire mathematics community including teacher educators, undergraduate and ...\n\nWomen Mathematicians = KadÄ±n MatematikÃ§iler\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAli DÃNMEZ\n\n2001-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In any book on the history of mathematics, mention about women mathematicians is hardly found. One wonders if there were any and, if any, why so few? The lives of some women mathematicians from different countries, the first who was born in 370 AD and the last who died in 1935. If there were only a few women mathematicians before the 20th Century, why have there been more in the 21th century what has been done, and what is being done, to increase their number? There is no enough space in this paper to examine the details of the mathematical research being conducted by these eight women. Instead the main interest will be the difficulties involved and the struggles they underwent while fulfilling their desire to become mathematicians, the first one of them who had a tragic end.\n\nExploring High-Achieving Students' Images of Mathematicians\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAguilar, Mario SÃ¡nchez; Rosas, Alejandro; Zavaleta, Juan Gabriel Molina; Romo-VÃ¡zquez, Avenilde\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to describe the images that a group of high-achieving Mexican students hold of mathematicians.

Folland, who is a mathematician, has spent considerable time digesting the physical theory and sorting out the mathematical issues in it. Fortunately for mathematicians, Folland is a gifted expositor. The purpose of this book is to present the elements of quantum field theory, with the goal of understanding the behavior of elementary particles rather than building formal mathematical structures, in a form that will be comprehensible to mathematicians. Rigorous definitions and arguments are presented as far as they are available, but the text proceeds on a more informal level when necessary, with due care in identifying the difficulties. The book begins with a review of classical physics and quantum mechanics, then proceeds through the construction of free quantum fields to the perturbation-theoretic development of interacting field theory and renormalization theor...\n\nMathematicians at War\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nMazliak, Laurent\n\n2009-01-01\n\nItalian mathematician Volterra struggled to carry Italy into the World War I in May 1915 and then developed a frenetic activity to support the war effort.

The ingenious construction of beautiful patterns that can evoke such powerful emotions seems nothing short of magical. While mathematicians too construct beautiful patterns, I fear that few outside the math community appreciate that beauty or find any magic in it. I hope that this wonderful collection of articles, written by mathematicians who are themselves artists, will help better explain the many varied connections between mathematics and the arts, and illuminate better the beauty and magic in math. -Avi Wigderson, Institute for A\n\nA Mathematician Doing Physics\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNiss, Martin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nAfter World War II, quite a few mathematicians were attracted to the modeling of phase transitions as this area of physics was seeing considerable mathematical difficulties.

Fraenkel was a world-renowned mathematician in preâSecond World War Germany, whose work on set theory was fundamental to the development of modern mathematics. A friend of Albert Einstein, he knew many of the eraâs acclaimed mathematicians personally. He moved to Israel (then Palestine under the British Mandate) in the early 1930s. In his autobiography Fraenkel describes his early years growing up as an Orthodox Jew in Germany and his development as a mathematician at the beginning of the twentieth century. This memoir, originally written in German in the 1960s, has now been translated into English, with an additional chapter covering the period from 1933 until his death in 1965 written by the editor, Jiska Cohen-Mansfield. Fraenkel describes the world of mathematics in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century, its origins and development, the systems influencing it, and its demise. He also paints a unique picture of the complex struggles within the world of Orthodox Jewry in Germany....\n\nHow mathematicians think using ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox to create mathemathics\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nByers, William\n\n2007-01-01\n\nTo many outsiders, mathematicians appear to think like computers, grimly grinding away with a strict formal logic and moving methodically--even algorithmically--from one black-and-white deduction to another. Yet mathematicians often describe their most important breakthroughs as creative, intuitive responses to ambiguity, contradiction, and paradox. A unique examination of this less-familiar aspect of mathematics, How Mathematicians Think reveals that mathematics is a profoundly creative activity and not just a body of formalized rules and results\n\nProfessional mathematicians differ from controls in their spatial-numerical associations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCipora, Krzysztof; Hohol, Mateusz; Nuerk, Hans-Christoph; Willmes, Klaus; BroÅ¼ek, Bartosz; Kucharzyk, BartÅomiej; NÄcka, Edward\n\n2016-07-01\n\nWhile mathematically impaired individuals have been shown to have deficits in all kinds of basic numerical representations, among them spatial-numerical associations, little is known about individuals with exceptionally high math expertise. They might have a more abstract magnitude representation or more flexible spatial associations, so that no automatic left/small and right/large spatial-numerical association is elicited. To pursue this question, we examined the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect in professional mathematicians which was compared to two control groups: Professionals who use advanced math in their work but are not mathematicians (mostly engineers), and matched controls. Contrarily to both control groups, Mathematicians did not reveal a SNARC effect. The group differences could not be accounted for by differences in mean response speed, response variance or intelligence or a general tendency not to show spatial-numerical associations. We propose that professional mathematicians possess more abstract and/or spatially very flexible numerical representations and therefore do not exhibit or do have a largely reduced default left-to-right spatial-numerical orientation as indexed by the SNARC effect, but we also discuss other possible accounts. We argue that this comparison with professional mathematicians also tells us about the nature of spatial-numerical associations in persons with much less mathematical expertise or knowledge.\n\nInterplay between research and teaching from the perspective of mathematicians\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nWinslÃ¸w, Carl; Madsen, Lene MÃ¸ller\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we examine the relation between teaching and research on mathematics in universities. We suggest that this relation can be fruitfully examined from the perspective of mathematicians' praxeologies (organisations of didactical and mathematical practice). We illustrate the approach...... with data from an interview study involving five top-level mathematicians....\n\nCommitment of mathematicians in medicine: a personal experience, and generalisations.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nClairambault, Jean\n\n2011-12-01\n\nI will present here a personal point of view on the commitment of mathematicians in medicine.

In recent years it has attracted the interest of mathematicians because of its novelty, and because of significance, both in mathematics and physics, of the main issues it raises. This book presents the foundations of supersymmetry to the mathematically minded reader in a cogent and self-contained manner. It begins with a brief introduction to the physical foundations of the theory, especially the classification of relativistic particles and their wave equations, such as the equations of Dirac and Weyl\n\nIncreased gray matter density in the parietal cortex of mathematicians: a voxel-based morphometry study.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAydin, K; Ucar, A; Oguz, K K; Okur, O O; Agayev, A; Unal, Z; Yilmaz, S; Ozturk, C\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe training to acquire or practicing to perform a skill, which may lead to structural changes in the brain, is called experience-dependent structural plasticity. The main purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the presence of experience-dependent structural plasticity in mathematicians' brains, which may develop after long-term practice of mathematic thinking. Twenty-six volunteer mathematicians, who have been working as academicians, were enrolled in the study. We applied an optimized method of voxel-based morphometry in the mathematicians and the age- and sex-matched control subjects. We assessed the gray and white matter density differences in mathematicians and the control subjects. Moreover, the correlation between the cortical density and the time spent as an academician was investigated. We found that cortical gray matter density in the left inferior frontal and bilateral inferior parietal lobules of the mathematicians were significantly increased compared with the control subjects. Furthermore, increase in gray matter density in the right inferior parietal lobule of the mathematicians was strongly correlated with the time spent as an academician (r = 0.84; P mathematicians' brains revealed increased gray matter density in the cortical regions related to mathematic thinking. The correlation between cortical density increase and the time spent as an academician suggests experience-dependent structural plasticity in mathematicians' brains.\n\nOn Mathematicians' Proof Skimming: A Reply to Inglis and Alcock\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWeber, Keith; Mejia-Ramos, Juan Pablo\n\n2013-01-01\n\nn a recent article, Inglis and Alcock (2012) contended that their data challenge the claim that when mathematicians validate proofs, they initially skim a proof to grasp its main idea before reading individual parts of the proof more carefully.

A student of Hilbert, a pioneer of the foundations of probability and game theory, and a contributor to the development of functional analysis, he was one of those instrumental to the extraordinary flowering of Polish mathematics before and after World War I. In particular, it was he who âdiscoveredâ the great Stefan Banach. Exhibiting his great integrity and wit, Steinhausâs personal story of the turbulent times he survived â including two world wars and life postwar under the Soviet heel â cannot but be of consuming interest. His recounting of the fearful years spent evading Nazi terror is especially moving. The steadfast honesty and natural dignity he maintained while pursuing a life of demanding scientific and intellectual enquiry in the face of encroaching calamity and chaos show him to be truly a mathematician for all seasons. ...\n\nOn the role of visual experience in mathematical development: Evidence from blind mathematicians.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAmalric, Marie; Denghien, Isabelle; Dehaene, Stanislas\n\n2018-04-01\n\nAdvanced mathematical reasoning, regardless of domain or difficulty, activates a reproducible set of bilateral brain areas including intraparietal, inferior temporal and dorsal prefrontal cortex. The respective roles of genetics, experience and education in the development of this math-responsive network, however, remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the role of visual experience by studying the exceptional case of three professional mathematicians who were blind from birth (n=1) or became blind during childhood (n=2). Subjects were scanned with fMRI while they judged the truth value of spoken mathematical and nonmathematical statements. Blind mathematicians activated the classical network of math-related areas during mathematical reflection, similar to that found in a group of sighted professional mathematicians. Thus, brain networks for advanced mathematical reasoning can develop in the absence of visual experience. Additional activations were found in occipital cortex, even in individuals who became blind during childhood, suggesting that either mental imagery or a more radical repurposing of visual cortex may occur in blind mathematicians.

His contributions to IT services include the IBM mainframe workhorse CERN VM, the backup tape service and in recent years the version control services, until his well-deserved retirement at the end of March this year. We will all remember David for his friendly and helpful manners, and as a warm person who was always caring for others, particularly newcomers. David was also a passionate musician and active tennis player. He will be greatly missed by his colleagues. A memorial service took place at 11 a.m. on Monday, 14 December 2015 at the Auditoire Calvin next to the Cathedral in Geneva.

These congresses arose at the end of the 19-th century, being the last step on the professionalizing process of mathematical research. Its meetings have gathered all areas of mathematical research, exhibiting the best mathematics of the moment, and honouring the great mathematicians from the past. Prizes associated to ICMs have had a very important role, in particular, the Fields medal. The history of the congresses allow to appreciate how the rooted feeling among mathematicians of constituting a scientific research community has aided ICMs to overcome all the tragic events of the history of the 20-th century, arriving safely to the 25-th congress in Madrid in 2006.En este artÃ­culo se repasa la historia de los International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM.

He was a noted observational astronomer whose career was divided between South Africa and Texas. He also used the extensive historical collections at the University of Texas to write several books on the history of astronomy. He was born in Cardiff, Wales on 28 January 1916. David received his BA degree in mathematics in 1937 from Kings College, Cambridge. He became a PhD student at Cambridge Observatory in 1937, and was one of Sir Arthur Eddington's last surviving students. He received his PhD degree in 1941 with a dissertation entitled, \"The Formation of the Balmer Series of Hydrogen in Stellar Atmospheres.\" He was a conscientious objector to war and, thus, spent the war years at Oxford working with physicist Kurt Mendelssohn on medical problems, involving cadavers, relating to the war. During these years, David was scientific editor of \"Discovery\", and he was editor of \"The Observatory\". David left England in 1946 in order to take up the position of Second Assistant at the Radcliffe Observatory, Pretoria, South Africa. He and H. Knox Shaw were the entire staff after R. O. Redman left, and they aluminized and installed the mirrors in the 74-inch telescope. His notable scientific contribution was to use lunar occultations to measure stellar angular diameters during the 1950s. He succeeded in determining the angular diameter of Antares and determined that Arcturus was not circular but had an elliptical shape. The elliptical shape was later shown to be an instrumental artifact, but the utility of using lunar occultations to measure stellar diameters and stellar multiplicity was conclusively demonstrated. T. Gold presented David's paper on lunar occultation angular diameters at the January 1953 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. For the rest of his life, David resented Gold's remarks, because he felt that he had been ridiculed. By 1953, David Evans was Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory\n\nConstructions of Mathematicians in Popular Culture and Learners' Narratives: A Study of Mathematical and Non-Mathematical Subjectivities\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMoreau, Marie-Pierre; Mendick, Heather; Epstein, Debbie\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this paper, based on a project funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council considering how people position themselves in relation to popular representations of mathematics and mathematicians, we explore constructions of mathematicians in popular culture and the ways learners make meanings from these.

The funeral was held the following Monday. David was a \"linac man\". His career centred around linacs, but with a multitude of different subjects. He began at CERN by building the 3 MeV linac in the extension of the South Hall. He did pioneering work on this machine, which paved the way towards the design of the Alvarez cavities for the CERN Linac 2, for which he was responsible. After this challenge was successfully finished, David was the first member of the small but growing team, that was in charge of building the LEP Injector Linacs (LIL). After having been recognised as a proton linac expert, he quickly converted to electron linacs where he soon became the respected key expert for the design, parameters and ultimate performance of LIL.

To evaluate what brain systems underlie higher mathematics, we scanned professional mathematicians and mathematically naive subjects of equal academic standing as they evaluated the truth of advanced mathematical and nonmathematical statements. In professional mathematicians only, mathematical statements, whether in algebra, analysis, topology or geometry, activated a reproducible set of bilateral frontal, Intraparietal, and ventrolateral temporal regions. Crucially, these activations spared areas related to language and to general-knowledge semantics. Rather, mathematical judgments were related to an amplification of brain activity at sites that are activated by numbers and formulas in nonmathematicians, with a corresponding reduction in nearby face responses. The evidence suggests that high-level mathematical expertise and basic number sense share common roots in a nonlinguistic brain circuit.\n\nA Fruitful Exchange/Conflict: Engineers and Mathematicians in Early Modern Italy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMaffioli, Cesare S.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nExchanges of learning and controversies between engineers and mathematicians were important factors in the development of early modern science.

It also gives me the chance to publicly express my gratitude to David for the opportunities he created for me at that time, as well as for the interest and care he has shown in my career and well-being ever since, as we have met up and exchanged news and ideas around the world: in New Mexico and Colorado, in Cancun, Paris and Trieste, at numerous March Meetings of the American Physical Society and, of course in London, Oxford, and my home town, Champaign-Urbana, location of the University of Illinois. I have been a member of David's circle for 25 years now, and I would like to tell you a little about how this came to be. Not because of what this says about me, but, rather, because of what it tells you about David and the rich generosity of his spirit and effort when it comes to supporting the underdog. I was indeed one such underdogâand that's putting it charitablyâwhen I first met David in September of 1982, not long before the academic year was to begin. I had heard about the exciting circle of physical and mathematical ideas swirling around the spin glass question during the previous year, which I had spent at the University of California's Los Angeles campus, through an opportunity kindly arranged, as it happens, by Sam Edwards. But I was eager to return to the UK for postgraduate studies and to work on spin glasses, so I simply showed up at David's Imperial College office, unannounced (if I remember correctly).

Nonstandard analysis is now a well-developed, powerful instrument for solving open problems in almost all disciplines of mathematics; it is often used as a âsecret weaponâ by those who know the technique. This book illuminates the subject with some of the most striking applications in analysis, topology, functional analysis, probability and stochastic analysis, as well as applications in economics and combinatorial number theory. The first chapter is designed to facilitate the beginner in learning this technique by starting with calculus and basic real analysis. The second chapter provides the reader with the most important tools of nonstandard analysis: the transfer principle, Keislerâs internal definition principle, the spill-over principle, and saturation. The remaining chapters of the book study different fields for applications; each begins...\n\nDr. David Syz, State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Switzerland\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nMaximilien Brice\n\n2003-01-01\n\nDr. David Syz, State Secretary for Economic Affairs, Switzerland, toured the assembly hall of the ATLAS experiment on a recent visit to CERN.Photos 01, 02: Dr. Peter Jenni, spokesperson for the ATLAS experiment (second from left), explains to Dr. David Syz (fourth from left) and accompanying visitors the process of integration of a 26-metre-long coil of the barrel toroid magnet system into its coil casing.Photo 03: Dr. Peter Jenni (extreme right) with Dr. David Syz (front row, fourth from right) behind a stack of 26-metre-long 'racetrack' coils awaiting integration into their coil casings.\n\nDr. David Sawyer, Mickey Mouse and Dr. David Brown attend a ceremony at Ronald McNair Middle School\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n1999-01-01\n\nDr. David Sawyer (left), Superintendent of the Brevard County School District, Mickey Mouse, and Dr. David Brown, a NASA astronaut, attend a tribute to NASA astronaut Ronald McNair held in the gymnasium of Ronald McNair Magnet School in Cocoa, Fla.

Looking at his papers it is always possible to find original and pioneering contributions to the various fields he was interested in, where he always put his mathematical \"formamentis\" and skills at the service of the applications, often extending standard theories and models in order to achieve more general results. Many contributions are also devoted to educational issues, in mathematics in general and in probability and statistics in particular.He really thought that mathematics and, in particular, those topics related to uncertainty, should enter in everyday life as a useful support to everyone's decision making. He always imagined and lived mathematics as a basic tool both for better understanding and describing complex phenomena and for helping decision makers in assuming coherent and feasible actions. His many important contributions to the theory of probability and to mathematical statistics are well known all over the world, thus, in the following, minor, but still pioneering, aspects of his work, related both to theory and to applications of mathematical tools, and to his work in the field of education and training of teachers, are presented.

He was the director of the Rudolf Magnus Institute at Utrecht University and president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He coached over 75 Ph.D. students and hosted some 200 foreign scientists who joined him in his multidisciplinary neuropeptide research. Many of them became lifelong friends, frequenting the home of Liedje and David de Wied. Born in Deventer (The Netherlands) on January 12th, 1925, David de Wied's early boyhood first in Deventer and later in Leeuwarden appears to have been no different from that of any other provincial Dutch boys in pre-war Holland. After the war David enrolled at Groningen University to study medicine. Subsequently he specialized in experimental pharmacology. To understand the determination of David de Wied is to understand the drive of a Jewish young man, who during the war, had been forced to go underground and unable to develop in a free and independent manner. Therefore, later in life, time became very precious to him and everything that came across his path had to be taken seriously. In this short sketch of David de Wied I will try to highlight his outstanding scientific accomplishments as well as his personality as both have inspired a generation of young scientists. It is a great honour and a pleasure to be part of this meeting in memory of David de Wied.\n\nInterview with David Moore\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRossman, Allan; Dietz, E.

Between 2001 and 2017, patients (nÂ = 135) with acute type A aortic dissection underwent an aortic root replacement with either the David (nÂ = 40) or Bentall (nÂ = 95) procedure. Perioperative outcome, reoperation rate, aortic valve function, and long-term survival were evaluated. The median age of the entire cohort was 56 years. Rates of malperfusion (21%), shock (16%), history of renal failure (4%), and extent of surgery were similar between David and Bentall groups. However, the David group was significantly younger (45 versus 61 years) with less hypertension (45% versus 66%), coronary artery disease (0% versus 17%), valvulopathy (5% versus 19%), and prior cardiac surgery (5% versus 21%). Overall operative mortality was 9.6% (David 3% and Bentall 13%). Composite outcome comprising myocardial infarction, stroke, new-onset renal failure, and operative mortality was 18% in the entire cohort (David 5% and Bentall 23%). In the David group, the freedom of moderate aortic insufficiency was 95% at 10 years. The rate of reoperation for pathology of the proximal aorta or aortic valve was 0% and 2% for the David and Bentall groups, respectively. Ten-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 66% (95% confidence interval: 51% to 77%) for the entire cohort, with 98% (95% confidence interval: 84% to 99%) survival in the David group and 57% (95% confidence interval: 42% to 70%) survival in the Bentall group. Both the David and Bentall procedures are appropriate surgical approaches for aortic root replacement in select patients with an acute type A aortic dissection.

His death came after a year of fighting cancer with all of his usual determination and optimism. Even days before the end he was still welcoming to visitors, and was alert and interested in all their news. Born in 1944, David came to CERN from the University of Cambridge in 1966, with a degree in Physics and Computer Science. Joining what at the time was called the Documents and Data (DD) Division, in the earlier part his career he worked first on software for analysis of bubble chamber photographs, subsequently leading the group that supported experiments with 'hybrids' of bubble chambers and electronic detectors and then the group supporting online computing in experiments. He thus witnessed all of the enormous changes that took place in particle physics as the era of bubble chambers came to an end and the availability ...\n\nThe collaboration between anatomists and mathematicians in the mid-seventeenth century with a study of images as experiments and Galileo's role in Steno's Myology.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMeli, Domenico Bertoloni\n\n2008-01-01\n\nMoving from Paris, Pisa, and Oxford to London, Amsterdam, and Cambridge, this essay documents extensive collaborations between anatomists and mathematicians. At a time when no standard way to acknowledge collaboration existed, it is remarkable that in all the cases I discuss anatomists expressed in print their debt to mathematicians. The cases I analyze document an extraordinarily fertile period in the history of anatomy and science and call into question historiographic divisions among historians of science and medicine. I focus on Steno's Myology, showing how his collaboration with mathematician Viviani led to a geometrical treatment of muscular contraction and to an epistemology inspired by Galileo. The collaboration between Steno and Viviani enables us to interpret a major text in the history of anatomy, one whose implications had so far eluded historians.\n\nKing, Prof. Sir David Anthony\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nElected: 1998 Honorary.

PÃ¨re David's deer have been raised in enclosures for more than 1200 years and this isolation provides an opportunity to study whether PÃ¨re David's deer still respond to the cues of their ancestral predators or to novel predators. We played back the sounds of crows (familiar sound and domestic dogs (familiar non-predators, of tigers and wolves (ancestral predators, and of lions (potential naÃ¯ve predator to PÃ¨re David's deer in paddocks, and blank sounds to the control group, and videoed the behavior of the deer during the experiment. We also showed life-size photo models of dog, leopard, bear, tiger, wolf, and lion to the deer and video taped their responses after seeing these models. PÃ¨re David's deer stared at and approached the hidden loudspeaker when they heard the roars of tiger or lion. The deer listened to tiger roars longer, approached to tiger roars more and spent more time staring at the tiger model. The stags were also found to forage less in the trials of tiger roars than that of other sound playbacks. Additionally, it took longer for the deer to restore their normal behavior after they heard tiger roars, which was longer than that after the trial of other sound playbacks. Moreover, the deer were only found to walk away after hearing the sounds of tiger and wolf. Therefore, the tiger was probably the main predator for PÃ¨re David's deer in ancient time. Our study implies that PÃ¨re David's deer still retain the memories of the acoustic and visual cues of their ancestral predators in spite of the long term isolation from natural habitat.\n\nDavid Miller on Immigration Policy and Nationality\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nLÃ¦gaard, Sune\n\n2007-01-01\n\nDavid Miller's recent statement of the case for restrictive immigration policies can plausibly be construed as an application of a âliberal nationalist' position.
