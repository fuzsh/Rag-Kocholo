According to the 2008 census (Instituto Nacional de Estadística), the municipality has a population of 42 inhabitants. In 1930 the population was 252.[1] The 16th century parish church is dedicated to St Bartholomew and is constructed in the baroque style. It has a notable 16th century altar depicting the life of Saint Bartholomew in eight panels.[2]\n\nThe novel Secuestro y fonda de Cela en Contamina by José de Cora, is set in the pueblo and recounts a fictional history of the kidnapping of 1989 Nobel Prize winner Camilo José Cela by three local inhabitants.[3]\n\nTwo kilometres to the east lies the spa town of Alhama de Aragón. The main highway between Zaragoza and Madrid skirts the northern edge of the settlement. This is a rural community with arable and fruit farms.

Contamina used to lie on the Camino Real, the royal highway to Madrid, and in the Middle Ages was the location of stables for royal post horses. In 1361 king Pedro IV gave the manor of Contamina to Pedro Carrillo. In 1646 Contamina was granted by king Felipe IV to Sr. Juan Fernandez de Heredia of Cetina, who became Conde de Contamina.[6] In the diaries of Elizabeth, Lady Holland, the Conde de Contamina was mentioned favourably as a supporter of the English cause against Napoleon during the Peninsular War.[7]\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War Contamina remained in the Nationalist Zone following occupation of most of the province of Zaragoza by Franco's Nationalist forces in the summer of 1936.[8]\n\nFiestas\n\nAugust 24, Saint Bartholomew\n\nFirst Sunday in October, Virgen del Rosario.\n\nNearby places\n\nAlhama de Aragon\n\nAriza\n\nCetina\n\nMonasterio de Piedra\n\nNuevalos\n\nNotes"
