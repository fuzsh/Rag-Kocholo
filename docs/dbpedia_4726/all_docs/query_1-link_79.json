        "text": "Canonical, Ubuntu’s parent company at one time was developing an operating system for Android devices. They called this move a way to “disrupt the industry” and change the way we use mobile phones by bringing a full Linux desktop to mobile. After a few years, they eventually gave up. The reason? The company behind Ubuntu failed at convincing consumers to switch away from Android OS. As a result, the project was abandoned by them. If you’re looking to install Ubuntu Touch on your Android device, there’s still a way. Soon after Ubuntu Touch “died”, it was picked up by a community of developers who still very much want to make Ubuntu Touch a reality. As a result, users can install the operating system, get software updates, security fixes and even new features!\n\nUBports officially supports Ubuntu Touch images (and updates) for the Google Nexus 5, the OnePlus One and the Fairphone 2. These three devices have complete support and no development is currently active. Every driver and feature on these smartphones work perfectly with Ubuntu Touch. These are the “core” devices and make up the majority of UBport’s effort. They regularly get new software features and patches.\n\nAdditionally, UBports has Core (pre-release) devices. These devices are up-and-coming but are going to be placed in the “core” lineup. They are in beta. These devices are the Optimus L90, the BQ M10 HD, and the BQ M10 FHD. Owners of these devices can install Ubuntu Touch and use it with caution, as they are under heavy development.\n\nLastly, UBports supports Legacy devices. These are devices that have ports (in some way) by either Canonical and the official Ubuntu Touch development team, or the Ubuntu community at large. These devices will not get new features like the Core and Core Pre-release devices. Instead, UBports create software fixes and security updates. These legacy devices are: The Google Nexus 10, Google Nexus 7 2013 (LTE edition), and BQ Aquaris E4.5\n\nSee http://bit.ly/2wO28nP\n\nHome\n\n[ad_2]\n\nSource link"
