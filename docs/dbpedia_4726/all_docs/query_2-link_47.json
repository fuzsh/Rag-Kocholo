        "text": "I know Simon since the beginning of this year 2015. First, we only discussed some Ubuntu Phone stuff, later on he became one of the Ubuntu Phone Insider. Since then he started collaborating with me and some other folks in the German LoCo to organize the UbuContest. While he initially only wanted give away one of his Ubuntu Phones, we quickly got the support from Canonical to make a bigger UbuContest and also advertise the Ubucon Germany at the same time. At the event itself he helped us out and also did some talks. For the future UbuCon Europe, he already raised some good ideas in our organisation group. I look forward to continue to work with him, both in the UbuCon organisation and also as part of the ubuntu phone insider. svij 2015-10-30\n\nSimon's membership is long due. While he's been a long-time Ubuntu supporter, in recent times his contributions have started to shine: the series of blog posts about the Ubuntu phone, his status as Ubuntu phone Insider, bug reports and discussions on the mailing list (just don't ask him about app lifecycle and the organization of the Ubu Contest are just some of these stellar examples. I've had the privilege to work with him during the Ubu Contest initiative and meet him at the Ubu Con Berlin, and I can only recommend him to be granted Ubuntu Membership. Good work! -- dpm 2015-10-30 16:58:34\n\nI'm really surprised that Simon is not a Ubuntu Member already. TBH I was even thinking he works for Canonical What I can say about him? Hmmm... Firstly I knew him from Google+ as a person who knows everything about phones' insides, hardware and other black magic I have no idea. For me he was very mysterious character hiding behind fake name and avatar with a mouse (which later turned out to be a chinchilla). Later he made that very annoying game about Panda and Love. I believe his plan was to make people destroy their Ubuntu phones out of frustration. Time passed and I had a chance to meet him at UbuCon in Berlin. He is very nice guy, open to people, looks nothing like his G+ avatar. He's spreading Ubuntu (and Panda) love everywhere. I hope getting the membership will not change him into a villain he was before (in my imagination at least). Good luck! -- mpredotka 2015-11-05 09:39:11\n\nSimon has shown lots of initiative to many things related to Ubuntu. It reaches from blogging about cool new stuff, writing HowTos for others to get that stuff set up, helping others out on IRC and Telegram groups etc. Additionally he has been playing a big role on the organisation of UbuContest (the app development contents) and seems to be involved with UbuCon organisation too. A clear +1 from my end. -- mzanetti 2015-11-05 09:49:49\n\nSince meeting Simon in the Ubuntu Insiders group (via Telegram) he's always been available and very helpful. Even when I showed my complete ignorance of some networking and fibre optic basics. If they let me be an Ubuntu Member then there's absolutely no reason to not include Simon. AAAAAAAAA+ would harrass again in a heartbeat -- ronnietucker 2015-11-05 18:39:49\n\nLe Panda guy is active in the ubuntu community on social networks such as g+ or telegram, always posting about new stuff such as convergence, phone and stuff. His UbuContest initiative has a very influence on the developer community on the phone which is very appreciated. His contributions to make the UbuCon Europe happens are very strongh. I recommand Simon as an ubuntu member. -- cm-t 2015-11-05 22:10:44\n\nThe nick talks for him. He is one of the best Ubuntuphone hackers, his blog is full of masterpiece of information about the phone and the convergence story, member of the Church of Snappy, introduced by Ogra himself, very involve in community, with the UbuCon Europe and UbuContest, very active in the Ubuntuphone Insiders group, create one of the most infuriating game I played (I dream about killing panda all the time now), and will be one of the first guest stars at UbuCon Paris very soon. I just don't understand why he is not a member yet. With all the things he done for Ubuntu, I think that he simply forgets to do his application -- vinzjobard 2015-11-09 16:02:14\n\nI have trouble memorizing any foreign (to me) words but sturmflut has stuck because I see it all over the place wrt to the Ubuntu phone. Simon is doing amazing work in collecting info and documenting the phone at https://sturmflut.github.io/ Filing bug reports and diagnosing difficult issues. Also, sharing the space with the rest of the Ubuntu Insiders. He was the driving factor in the recent UbuContest. I wholeheartedly recommend Simon as an Ubuntu Member. Now back to the Panda game. -- simosx 2015-11-10 08:41:53\n\nI met Simon in person one week ago in the Ubucon of Paris and I was really impressed by his enthusiasm towards Ubuntu. He's always responsive and very active (specially into Ubuntu Touch and the next Ubucon Europe). Simon could be one of the key Ubuntu members for the future and I fully support his application! -- costales"
