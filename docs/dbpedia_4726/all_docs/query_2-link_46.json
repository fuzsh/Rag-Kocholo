        "text": "The E5 Ubuntu Edition is not compatible with GSM networks in Mexico. This is because it is a model for Europe only; and uses the GSM (2G) 850/900/1800/1900 or \"EDGE\" and for 3G and HSDPA (H+) networks using 900/2100.\n\nIn Mexico the companies use other frequencies for the 3G:\n\nTelcel 3G: 850 mhz All others (Iusacell, Movistar, etc): 3G: 1900 mhz\n\nNobody in Mexico using 3G in 900 or 1200 MHz, so your phone only works in 2G, there is no way to operate 3G as it is at the hardware level.\n\nInterestingly, the LTE frequency Telcel 2100 MHz works the same as \"H+\" of the Ubuntu Phone not assume anything but maybe (and just maybe) worth trying. :)"
