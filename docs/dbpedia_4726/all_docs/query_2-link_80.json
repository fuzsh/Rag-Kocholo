        "text": "An Ubuntu-powered smartphone is coming to the market a year and a half after a previous attempt to launch a model via crowdfunding failed.\n\nThe Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu edition relies on a card-like user interface that is not focused on apps.\n\nUnlike the original proposal, the handset does not become a desktop PC when plugged into a monitor.\n\nIt is initially being targeted at \"early adopters\", who developers hope will become advocates for the platform.\n\nThe British company Canonical, which developed the Linux-based operating system, said it hoped to emulate the success of Chinese companies including Xiaomi with its launch strategy.\n\nThis will include holding a number of \"flash sales\" in Europe beginning next week, in which the device will be sold for short periods of time - giving the developers an opportunity to gauge demand and respond to feedback before committing to a bigger production run.\n\n\"It's a proven model - we're making sure that the product lands in the right hands,\" Cristian Parrino, vice-president of mobile at Canonical, told the BBC.\n\n\"We are way away from sticking this in a retail shop in the High Street. [But] it's where we want to get to.\"\n\nMillions of PCs used by schools, governments and businesses already run the desktop version of Ubuntu.\n\n\"The Ubuntu fan base will clamour to buy the phone just because they will be curious to see what it is, how it works and how they can develop for it - they'll want to be one of the few that have it,\" said Chris Green, from Davies Murphy Group Europe.\n\n\"But for the broader, more mainstream, early adopter market, I think demand will be constricted because people are more app-focused.\"\n\nThe phone's home screen is the Today Scope. It presents a selection of widgets based on the user's most frequent interactions on the phone.\n\nThese can include the local weather forecast, the headlines of the day from third-party news services, Twitter trends and a list of the owner's most commonly contacted friends.\n\nBy swiping to the right, the owner can make a call or access some of the other default Scopes, including:\n\nCanonical makes money by charging organisations for support services.\n\nThe phones themselves are being made and sold by a Spanish company, BQ, which already has an Android variant of the hardware.\n\nThey include an eight-megapixel rear camera, a 5MP front one and one gigabyte of RAM memory. They will cost about 170 euros ($195; Â£127).\n\n\"It's a good-looking device and a very slick interface at a realistic price,\" commented Mr Green.\n\n\"Scopes are an interesting stopgap between a full third-party app environment and a fixed feature phone.\n\n\"However, they are just that - a stopgap. They will interest very early adopters and the Ubuntu faithful in the short term. However, it won't take long before people start wanting a full add-on app experience akin to the other existing platforms on the market today.\""
