        "text": "First Ubuntu tablet has been just announced. Canonical, parent company of Ubuntu, and Spanish hardware manufacturer BQ are all set to unveil the first Ubuntu tablet at Mobile World Congress, later this month.\n\nBQ is also the manufacturer of the first Ubuntu Phone. The partnership between Canonical and BQ extends to the tablet as well.\n\nUbuntu has been running the #reinvent campaign on social media and the web ahead of the launch to generate curiosity over the tablet. But does an Ubuntu fan really need a dedicated campaign to know about such things? I think not.\n\nAhead of this launch, specifications of the Ubuntu tablet and some teasers have been released. No surprises that the main focus has been on convergence.\n\nUbuntu Phone has demonstrated convergence several times in the past. Ubuntu tablet takes it to the next level. Just adding an HDMI cable makes it to a full-fledged desktop. All you need is a keyboard and a mouse.\n\nBQ Ubuntu tablet specification\n\nBQ will be using its trusted Aquaris M10 series to launch an Ubuntu edition. This is a strategy they used earlier with Ubuntu Phone where they launched an Ubuntu edition of their Aquaris e4.5 Android smartphone.\n\nAquaris M10 boasts of a decent hardware and an enormous 10 inches screen size. A quick list of specification includes:\n\n10.1 inch multi-touch screen\n\nMediaTek Quad Core MT8163A processor up to 1.5GHz\n\nHigh capacity Li-Po battery (7280mAh)\n\nFull HD (1080p) camera for super-sharp video recording\n\n2GB RAM and 16GB internal memory\n\nMicroSD slot for extra storage (up to 64GB)\n\n12 megapixel camera with autofocus and dual flash\n\nFrontal speakers\n\nMicro HDMI slot\n\nDimensions: 246 x 171 x 8.2mm\n\nLightweight at only 470g\n\nThese proposed specifications have been taken from Ubuntu’s official website which doesn’t match up with the Aquaris M10 specification on BQ website though. Ubuntu website shows a 12 MP camera while BQ website has 8 MP max.\n\nAs you can see, first Ubuntu tablet is not really a power horse. In 2016, 2GB of RAM doesn’t seem to be sufficient. Moreover, the closed source MediaTek processors are another let down of the first Ubuntu Phone.\n\nHowever, a supposed price tag of Euro 260 (the Android version costs the same) is a positive factor here and considering its capability to converge into a desktop, 10 inches screen keeps it in the entry level Netbook section.\n\nThe 470 g weight is another plus factor.\n\nFirst look at Ubuntu tablet\n\nWhile Ubuntu tablet will be officially unveiled at Mobile World Congress, you can have a glimpse of its looks and functionings in the pictures below:\n\nPrice, availability and release date\n\nBQ Aquaris M10 Ubuntu edition will go on sale in the second quarter of the year 2016. Guessing from Ubuntu Phone experience, it should be available for Europe and UK first and later in other parts of the world.\n\nThe price should be around 260-270 Euro. This too is an estimate based on the price of the Android version.\n\nUp for the grab?\n\nI was not very convinced at the first Ubuntu Phone. However, I think Ubuntu tablet is a better device than the Ubuntu Phone. With Snappy coming in action, Ubuntu tablet has the potential to become a mobile device cum desktop.\n\nWhat do you think of it?"
