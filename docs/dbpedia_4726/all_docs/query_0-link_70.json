Until it becomes a daily driver, check the terms below to understand the meaning of what is to own an Ubuntu Touch phone. Glossary 7+ days uptime No crash, but reboot needed. \"No reboot needed for one week\" means that when that device is on Stable or RC Update Channels it should work without random or the need for a hard reboot for seven days. The Devel Update channel gets daily updates so can introduce flaws to the OS more easily. The OS is stable. Your phone will not crash for at least one week. You will not need to reboot the device in that week.\n\n6/11/2022\n\nUbuntu Touch Design Documentation\n\nThe first step towards the offering of design practices is to have a 360 degree metaphorical view. It is important to tackle any design practices with a structured and well-defined route. You can't just jump into action because it'll be ineffective. That will simply waste your time as well as others. To start with, you will want to get organized. This means you need to have a plan and be able to map out how you will go about things. This typically starts with getting your ducks in a row, so to speak. You'll want to develop repeatable processes, establish workflow standards and governance, and put in place the right tools and technology. None of this is possible without team collaboration. You'll need everyone on board to help drive the success of your design operations. With everyone working together.

We unified the Ubuntu Touch brand as a whole to close the gap with the different parties involved in the project. This included Canonical, the device manufacturers and the wider Ubuntu community. By unifying our branding we can ensure that all users and stakeholders have a clear understanding of where Ubuntu Touch is heading and what they can expect from it.
