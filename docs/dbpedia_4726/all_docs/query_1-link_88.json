        "text": "Ubuntu launches the first in a series of converged devices alongside European partner, BQ\n\nAquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet brings full Ubuntu experience to life\n\nUbuntu is the only platform that runs both a mobile-based full touch interface and a true PC experience from a single smart device\n\nCanonical’s long held vision of a single, converged personal computing experience took an important step forward today with the launch of the first fully converged Ubuntu device – the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet. Shipping with the latest Ubuntu software, the device features a dynamically adaptive user experience, capable of providing both a true tablet experience and the full Ubuntu desktop experience.\n\nUbuntu is already firmly established as the preferred desktop experience of over 30 million users worldwide. The first three models of Ubuntu phones quickly sold out when they hit the market last year. With this latest software release and the launch of the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition, Ubuntu is now the only platform that runs both a mobile-based full touch interface and a true PC experience from a single smart device. This gives device manufacturers the opportunity to create true device convergence and bring the full power of personal computing to modern touch-based mobile devices.\n\nJane Silber, Canonical CEO said: “We’re bringing you everything you’ve come to expect from your Ubuntu PC, now on the tablet with BQ, soon on smartphones. This isn’t a phone interface stretched to desktop size – it’s the right user experience and interaction model for the given situation. Also, in terms of applications, we have something no other OS can provide: a single, visual framework and set of tools for applications to run on any type of Ubuntu smart device.”\n\nKey Ubuntu convergence features\n\nBuilding on the secure, reliable core of Ubuntu, the native Ubuntu tablet experience also features the ability to access content and services readily through scopes, as popularised on Ubuntu Phone. Hundreds of apps and scopes are already available in the Ubuntu App Store. Additionally, the tablet “side stage” feature allows you to view two different applications on the same screen, with each intuitively optimised for available tablet screen space.\n\nFurther convergence features include:\n\nEffortless multitasking and window management;\n\nFull range of desktop applications and thin client support for mobility and productivity;\n\nIntegrated services with desktop notifications;\n\nAbility to manage applications and easily organise favoured ones for fast access;\n\nSimple file browsing, file and folder creation and management;\n\nResponsive applications developed for both touch and point/click input and which re-shape to whichever UI is being displayed;\n\nComprehensive system control and access to the underlying OS if required;\n\nSingle application store with a range of compatible third party services;\n\nCommunication from the desktop interface using the phone’s telephony and messaging applications;\n\nAll the security, updates, and reliability features appreciated by Ubuntu users worldwide.\n\nAquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet features\n\nThe Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition is the first device to offer an Ubuntu convergent experience. It is also the first tablet with the Ubuntu Operating System. Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition brings Ubuntu’s rich full touch experience to life. It’s simple to connect a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to convert the Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition into a full Ubuntu PC, featuring everything you know and love about Ubuntu. Then, connect the tablet to an external display for a full-sized PC experience.\n\n“The Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition is our third mobile device to ship with Ubuntu. Our customers were delighted with the Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition and Aquaris E5 HD Ubuntu Edition phones, and we’re excited to be the first OEM to ship the converged Ubuntu experience. It’s this kind of innovation that makes BQ and Ubuntu such a great fit,” said Rodrigo del Prado, Deputy CEO of BQ.\n\nThe Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet has a 10.1 inch multitactile FHD screen with Dragontrail Asahi protection. This light and compact tablet offers an excellent balance between sleek design and autonomy: with 8.2 mm of thickness and 470 grams in weight, it includes a 7280 mAh LiPo battery. It has a powerful MediaTek Quad Core MT8163A to 1.5 GHz processor which gives the extremely high performance. View the full spec.\n\nWhat’s the value to the enterprise?\n\nFor businesses, Ubuntu convergence combines everything you need to take your work with you. It works seamlessly with Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and thin client services and easily mixes local and web applications for mobile and desktop use. Excellent security comes as standard as part of the Ubuntu OS but Ubuntu convergence brings unparalleled enterprise-grade, system-based security. For many organisations wanting to take tight control over their own systems, avoiding third party access, Ubuntu is ideal.\n\nFor consumers?\n\nIf you love being able to connect your PC to your TV, this is now simple via your mobile device. You can run all your favourite apps on the tablet but benefit from a full PC interface – familiar and easy to navigate. It’s all about making life easier and so now it’s simple to create documents, send messages and stay connected in the same way as you do on the PC.\n\nAnd what about partners? (OEMS / ODMS/Operators)\n\nFor partners there’s a real opportunity to diversify and differentiate from nearly identical slabs of glass, and to participate in real innovation in the mobile space. Canonical’s mobile experts have deep knowledge and experience working with a range of OEMs and ODMs having successfully launched devices worldwide.\n\nThe opportunity for developers\n\nThird party developers will be able to easily create new Ubuntu applications which only need to be developed once but which can be available and used across all Ubuntu interfaces. The Ubuntu SDK provides the fundamental tools developers need to make their apps easy to adapt and run on any display. When you see your application on the phone and then use that application on the desktop, it is the exact same code running each application. Ubuntu does not need to know if the app is coded for a mobile or desktop display rather it is the application that surfaces the appropriate interface depending on which display is required.\n\nThe Aquaris M10 Ubuntu Edition tablet will be on sale from Q2 2016 via BQ’s online store.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout BQ\n\nBQ is a leading European technology company.
