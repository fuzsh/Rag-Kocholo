Many of iTEKcanada.com’s Mobile/SmartPhone Battery use the same battery cells as OEM batteries.\n\nWhat is mAh / Wh?\n\nThese ratings show battery`s capacity. Think of them as gas in your car tank, the bigger the tank, the more fuel it will carry and your car will drive longer. Same with these batteries, the higher the mAh/Wh, the longer your device will run between recharges.\n\nWill your higher capacity (mAh/Wh) Mobile/SmartPhone Battery work in my device, even though my original battery has a smaller rating?\n\nDefinitely! Our batteries are designed to be 100% replacements for original batteries. Higher mAh/Wh rating means longer run time between recharges. The higher the rating the slower it will take for the batteries to drain down. Meaning you will get longer talk time with a higher mAh rating. In other word, higher is the mAh number, better it’ll be for your device.\n\nQuality and Safety\n\nThis battery contains advanced technical components and has been tested according to strict CE safety standards. The battery contains a chip that prevents overcharging and short circuiting. Next to this the battery is made from high quality cells that do not suffer from a so-called 'memory effect'.'\n\nFactory Fresh\n\nBatteries lose performance over their lifetime, even when they are not used. Many importers and resellers store their batteries in stock for a long time before they are sold. iTEKcanada.com sends products almost directly from the factory, so you are sure that you will get a brand new high quality battery!"
