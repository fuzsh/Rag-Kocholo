In a nutshell, the \"Mir\" display server will adapt the application, program or game to suit the screen of whatever device is being used.\n\nThis means that ALL of the software for Ubuntu (as in the PC operating system) will run natively on Ubuntu Phone... Once Mir has been implemented in the PC version of Ubuntu, anyway.\n\nFurther to this, anyone that doesn't listen to all of the anti-Linux/Ubuntu propaganda will know that even \"out-of-the-box\", Ubuntu is capable of so much more than a Microsoft Windows-based operating system, with oceans of third-party software available (often for free) that will add any additional functionality required.\n\nThis first smartphone is garbage, but the operating system behind it (i.e. Ubuntu Phone) has so much more potential than all of the other smartphone operating systems currently available...\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-19741\n\najT\n\n08 Feb 2015\n\nanother flop just like jolla or firefox\n\nReply\n\nh\n\nhamam99\n\n61B\n\n08 Feb 2015\n\nwonderfull.....\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-361225\n\nNmP\n\n08 Feb 2015\n\nA mobile phone with no Whatsapp?

Anyone will be able to purchase the smartphone, but those are the people this device is specifically being made for.\n\nFor everyone else, there is the upcoming Meizu smartphone (which is rumored to be a high-end device) and Mark Shuttleworth has repeatedly stated that other devices are \"in the works\" (Bq for example, are rumored to be working on a device specifically made for Ubuntu Phone, rather than a re-purposed Android smartphone)...\n\nSupposedly Canonical are \"in talks\" with \"major manufacturers\" about Ubuntu Phone devices too, though my personal opinion is that this is just marketing talk - I'd love to be proven wrong though (come on Sony)!\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-126035\n\nwgs\n\n07 Feb 2015\n\nAnonD-210597, 06 Feb 2015I hope now GSMArena adds BQ devices to their list.

It has the same \"write once, run anywhere\" mentality that is the basis of Java.\n\nIn practice, this is not always the case... But on paper, they should be compatible.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I should point out however, that most of Ubuntu Phone's \"applications\" and \"games\" will run via \"scopes\", which is basically a software-based \"wrapper\" for the HTML5 content... I'm not too sure how well this will or will not work with third-party HTML5 content, such as that for Firefox OS.\n\nTheoretically, Firefox OS' HTML5 content should still be compatible (as per my comments above), but I couldn't say for certain until someone actually tries it...\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-126035\n\nwgs\n\n07 Feb 2015\n\nblush, 07 Feb 2015Actually no it isn't linux, it uses a heavily modified olde... moreActually, you're wrong - \"Linux\" is technically the kernel (or in layman's terms, \"the heart\" of the operating system) and like Ubuntu Phone, Android uses a Linux kernel...\n\nMost of the \"behind the scenes\" stuff is written in C and run natively; whilst the user interface, games and applications are written in Java and run via a \"virtual machine\" (although technically incorrect, it's sort of like an emulator, if you are not familiar with virtual machines).\n\nBy comparison, Ubuntu Phone runs everything natively... Though I should point out that at this time, most applications and games will be HTML5 based (basically Web pages with a software-based wrapper).\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-126035\n\nwgs\n\n07 Feb 2015\n\nConsidering \"Bq\" is not even listed on GSM Arena as a manufacturer, I don't suppose the odds are in our favor for a review?\n\nIt would be great to get a detailed overview of Ubuntu Phone and when it comes to reviews of smartphones and phablets, GSM Arena pretty much sets the benchmark with regards to quality...\n\nReply\n\nD\n\nAnonD-361018\n\nc{M\n\n07 Feb 2015\n\nchurman, 06 Feb 2015I dont get....why dont they just create a android rom..with... moreBecause that wouldn't be \"Ubuntu\".

So thanks to that you have more screen space. If you like or not, well, then that's your choice.\n\nBought two of them for my parents (the Android version, which comes with 4.4.2), 4 months ago, and so far they like it. Nice decent battery, double SIM, external mSD card, and nice performance. I'll leave a link so you can see the full specs of the android version http://www.bq.com/es/productos/aquaris-e4-5.html\n\nAll in all, I would say it's on the same league as the first generation of the Motorola Moto G (even outperforms it on benchmarks).\n\nReply"
