        "text": "Linux phone enthusiasts will be pleased to hear a new version of the PinePhone is available to pre-order — and it comes pre-loaded with Ubuntu Touch.\n\nUbuntu Touch, also known by the name UBports, is a community-maintained version of Ubuntu for phones and tablets based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. It is a direct continuation of the codebase Canonical cancelled a few years back.\n\nFrom today you (and anyone else who is interested) can preorder a PinePhone Community Edition with UBports direct from the Pine64 Store.\n\nA new “working partnership” between UBports Foundation and Pine64, the company who make the PinePhone (among other low-cost Linux electronics) has been announced too.\n\n“UBports were among the very first to embrace our initiative and offer their supportfor the PinePhone. (…) It is therefore very fitting that the UBports Foundation will be the first partner in our Community Editions scheme,” Pine64’s Lukasz Erecinski is quoted as saying.\n\nEach customised PinePhone sold with UBPorts pre-installed results in a $10 donation to the UBports foundation. Considering the low price point of the handset, and the very low profit margins involved, this is a pretty substantial donation.\n\nFunctionality that is listed as ‘working’ in the PinePhone UBports Community Edition:\n\nVoice calls\n\nSMS texts\n\nGPS\n\nLTE\n\nGPU hardware acceleration\n\nWi-Fi\n\nBluetooth\n\nIn short: all the essentials.\n\nFunctionality which is not currently working on the device includes: both the rear and front-facing cameras; battery/power efficiency (my phone lasts about 4 hours); USB host connectivity — but these are in varying states of progress.\n\nThe PinePhone UBports Community Edition also has the UBports logo/mascot printed on the back case. It’s not clear if a branded version of the PinePhone phone case will also be sold too (otherwise you’ll have to choose between repping your OS and protecting your device from scratches).\n\nNot into Ubuntu Touch? No worries. This is just the first of several planned PinePhone Community Editions, each pre-loaded with a different mobile Linux OS.\n\nUBports and postmarketOS are the two Linux phone operating systems considered in the most ‘complete’ state right now. It’s super exciting to track the progress of these (among other) projects on a day by day basis — and now more people can join in the fun, which is great.\n\nInterested in finding out more? You’ll find more information on the product page. Price is $149 and estimate dispatch in late May 2020.\n\nPreorder PinePhone UBports Community Edition"
