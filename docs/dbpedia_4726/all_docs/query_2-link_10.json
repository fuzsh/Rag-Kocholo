        "text": "For production Ubuntu Phone devices, adb has been disabled in recovery, and this affects ubuntu-device-flash operation.\n\nYou must supply a recovery image with adb enabled, which ubuntu-device-flash will use temporarily while doing its work:\n\nFor BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition (aka krillin), use recovery-krillin.img\n\nFor BQ Aquaris E5 Ubuntu Edition (aka vegetahd), use recovery-vegetahd.img\n\nubuntu-device-flash can then be supplied with the --recovery-image argument, eg:\n\nubuntu-device-flash touch --channel ubuntu-touch/stable/bq-aquaris.en --bootstrap --recovery-image path/to/downloaded/recovery.img\n\nNote that when the command prompts you with:\n\nExpecting the device to be in the bootloader... waiting\n\nYou can put a Aquaris E4.5 and Aquaris E5 in the 'bootloader' by holding down Power + Volume Up for a few seconds, releasing the Power button when the red LED lights as the machine reboots, and then selecting 'fastboot' from the device's boot menu.\n\nunknown flag `recovery-image'\n\nIf you get this error, that means you are still using an older version of ubuntu-device-flash. Please install the latest version using the ppa\n\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:phablet-team/tools sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nAnother reason for failure to enter recovery might be unsufficient privileges for the usb device of the ubuntu computer.\n\nI tried John's flash command but still got a \"Failed to enter Recovery\" error. The solution came to me when I booted the device into fastboot mode, flashed the recovery image with the fastboot command and booted this image. Unless I had a file \"/etc/udev/rules.d/80-persistent-usb.rules\" with the contents:\n\nSUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", ACTION==\"add\", SYSFS{idVendor}==\"2a47\", MODE=\"0666\", SYSFS{idProduct}==\"*\"\n\non my ubunutu computer I was not able to access the device running the recovery kernel.\n\nAfter I added this file, I could \"adb shell\" and enter the recovery system. And also after that change, John's command worked as expected. My ubuntu computer runs a somewhat modified Linux but based on ubuntu 14.04."
