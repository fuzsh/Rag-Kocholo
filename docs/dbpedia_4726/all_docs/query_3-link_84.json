        "text": "Written by Michael Larabel in Ubuntu on 10 April 2015 at 10:07 AM EDT. 4 Comments\n\nBack when the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition smart-phone launched in February it was only available in limited numbers via \"flash sales\" facilitated by the company. At last, now this first Ubuntu smart-phone is available to order by anyone within the European Union.\n\nNow that the early kinks with the BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition phone are being worked out and other early issues, BQ is ready to offer this smart-phone for sale to everyone -- or at least those living within the EU.\n\nThe price remains â‚¬169.90 (about $180 USD). Those wishing to order this inaugural Ubuntu smart-phone can visit BQ.com to place their order.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nMichael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
