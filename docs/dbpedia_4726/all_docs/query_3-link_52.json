So I bought a screen replacement for the device on ebay (it was not for the Ubuntu Edition but I think that I can assume it doesn't matter).\n\nThe problem is that after the replacement the screen doesn't work correctly, here is a video that shows the behaviour of the touch.\n\nSo I thought it was a problem of that specific screen but I got another one from the same seller and it still behaves that way.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of what is going on and, if possible, how to fix it?\n\nThanks!"
