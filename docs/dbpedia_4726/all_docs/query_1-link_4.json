        "text": "In the last Q&A Dalton gave a list of devices that will be supported with UT based on Ubuntu 20.04[1]. Unsurprisingly, the BQ4.5 isn't in that list.\n\nTo me the support for the BQ4.5 has always been a bit of a roller coaster. It was sold and supported by Caniconal, then dropped. UBPorts took over, but they weren't able to give proper support to the legacy devices. Eventually they were able to give proper support, but even when the upgrade to 16.04 happened, it was already clear that an upgrade to 18.04 or 20.04 may mean the device wouldn't be supported any more.\n\nI think the development team has done a great job giving us a supported and well working 7 year old device. I for one thank them for that.\n\nBut now that this support will most probably end, the question is; What now? On the one hand I want to keep using UT because I really like it. On the other hand, I don't want my phone to be left in a drawer somewhere collecting dust, so what else can we run on it after the update to 20.04 happens?\n\nI looked around a bit, but I don't really see options honestly.\n\nWe can keep using UT based on 16.04, but that means no more updates. Eventually it wont be (easily) possible to install apps (unless maybe the click-packages will be kept available somewhere online and we can download and install from there), and it may not be (easily) possible to install UT back to the device (unless the images and instructions are kept available somewhere).\n\nI also looked around for other OS'es I know about, but none of them seem to have a port for the BQ4.5.\n\nI looked for the following, but don't see ports for Lineageos (Besides, I'm unsure how well this would work on an Ubuntu edition device since it doesn't have the Android buttons), PostmarketOS, SailfishOS, LuneOS, Manjaro and Mobian\n\nThat doesn't leave much options of course. Maybe someone has other OS'es or ports they know of that can run on the BQ4.5? What are you planning to do once support ends?\n\n[1] See Q&A 115 at 34:22. The list is\n\nPixel 3a\n\nVolla Phone\n\nVolla Phone X\n\nXPeriaX\n\nAnything else people come in to do\n\nThe problem UT has is the devices they are porting to are too expensive to be a viable option - the Volla phones are nice, but for a fraction of the cost of a Volla phone you can get an Android based phone, that basically does all that is required that UT doesn't.\n\nFrom reading around, two types of people are using UT, enthusiasts and/or Google/Apple avoiders.\n\nI bought two of the BQ4.5 when they first were released. It became clear pretty quickly why they wouldn't be mainstream -cost and app support. Mainstreamers use iOS and Android as it is all done for you. UT does not.\n\nI sold one on (regrettably) and still use the other, it is still a great cheap phone.\n\nI am an avid user of Linux and UT has really peaked my interest. If I could code and had more time I would port and develop. I know there are reasons why devices are left behind, but in some cases so what, they are still viable until spare parts run out.\n\nI come from a PC repair/ electronics fault finding background. I strongly believe in repurposing stuff so it doesn't go into landfill. I see UT as future where you make the phone OS yours, where telemetry and personal data is yours and not some foreign conglomerates.\n\nLike all things, when 20.04 comes along, 22.04 will be the next thing so the cycle will be repeated, but this with UT will need help of enthusiasts, volunteers, porters and coders.\n\nThere were reasons Canonical dropped UT and allowed the community to take over. And of course look at the way the Windows phones went.\n\nThe main thing though that will kill a lot of older devices is 2G and 3G being made redundant. But hey there is still Wi-Fi and with a bit of innovation, that 4.5 inch tablet will have a purpose for something.\n\nHi, I'd like to take the opportunity of this thread to point out several things.\n\nThe first one is the list given by Dalton is not a decision made or something definitive for other phones.\n\nThis leads to my next point, what the UBports foundation can do and what the UBports community can do.\n\nThe UBports foundation is maintaining Ubuntu Touch (the OS).\n\nAnd the move to 20.04 is necessary as 16.04 is not maintained anymore.\n\nBut 20.04 has some constraints regarding the kernel.\n\nOn the port side of things, updating the kernel for a given phone is not easy or even impossible...\n\nIf a version of android 9 or 10 was made for the device, then a port based on halium is possible.\n\nBut in case of old phone abandoned by manufacturers a long time ago building a recent enough kernel for the device and using the existing firmware is almost impossible or very expensive and difficult.\n\nThe foundation does not have the ressources to make a 20.04 compatible port for older, marginally used phones.\n\nMaintainers might not have the required time, resources and knowledge to do it either.\n\nSo some devices will be left over on 16.04 without updates because maintaining the 16.04 branch is to expensive for the UBports foundation.\n\nSo if you want a specific device to survive, you'll need to get in touch with the porter for this device and ask them if they are still willing to do the job or to assist.\n\nThen you'll have to gather people willing to help to bring create a port compatible with 20.04 requirements.\n\nThis is a community matter and effort to save a specific device.\n\nFor the BQ4.5, I do not know what can be done but it seems a very difficult task.\n\nAs @CiberSheep wrote, you have several options but overall it's a good thing this device was available for that long.\n\n@applee And that is the good answer and the answer I got from the Q&A sessions on YouTube. It is just a shame that these devices are not like PC's, where although things aren't the same, there is a kind of standard, i.e. x86 CPU's, RAM etc. so a lot of stuff at the front end works (or gives a damn good appearnce of working).\n\nI also got from the Q&A is the biggest issue is having the right people and time. We all have lives and with all that has been done with UT on peoples own time has been absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately at the moment my time is limited and concentration is a struggle, if I could contribute more I would, I have three devices lined up to port without the installer, so I can start getting a better feel for it.\n\n@mrt10001\n\nWith all due respect, your believes about desktop or laptops is wrong.\n\nThere is no standard thing, it's just a traditional computer is less complex than a mobile phone.\n\nThere is rarely support for fingerprint readers on laptops for example.\n\nAnd what is considered standard on a phone is far from usual on other computer stations like GPS, 2G, 3G, 4G (and now 5G) modems, accelerometer, ...\n\nLaptops and desktop computers are simpler and the user base is way larger then for the mobile platforms.\n\nThis explains the feeling that PC are well supported while phone and tablets are not.\n\nThe reality is that manufacturers mostly don't care and support for Linux is minimum.\n\nDrivers may exist but are rarely open sourced neither is their API available...\n\nThis problem has seen no real improvement since the begining of Linux and only a faster and stronger community and some big company's policy improved the situation for end users.\n\nHopefully Pine64, Volla, F(x)Tech and others will see the benefit of working with the FOSS communities.\n\n@cliffcoggin The way I understood those words are \"these devices have porters we know, so we're pretty confident that they will get the needed attention\". Hence the last on the list being \"Anything else people come in to do\". I don't think they can really say more, because they don't know more themselves.\n\nThe thing is just that we know it's gonna be a pain for non-Halium devices, because they've already explained that in a previous Q&A. And frankly, if I were to spent time porting, I'd probably focus on a different, more available, device myself.\n\nI won't even be disappointed if the device turns out to not be supported any more. I'm very happy that it lasted so long and I think that's a wonderful achievement on behalf of everyone involved!\n\n@applee I appreciate that lack of suitable personnel is going to affect the outcome, but given that appeals for new people to step forward and work on the project have fallen on deaf ears for the last six months, it is unrealistic to expect that situation to change in the near future. In other words the core team at UB Ports is not going to increase in the way it wants and needs in order to achieve all its goals, so some of those goals must be sacrificed. That is a straightforward management issue that should not be avoided any longer, no matter how unpopular the decision will be in some quarters.\n\nThe question of what phones will be kept and what will be sacrificed has been side-stepped for quite a while. I, and probably others here, would like some clarity in the matter. If that means my phone will die, so be it. At least I can plan for the next one once I have a firm decision.\n\n@cliffcoggin\n\nI see your POV.\n\nIn this case your best bet is the list given by Dalton.\n\nBut the phone you're currently using might be saved but at the moment it cannot be said because unless trying to port it to 20.04 there is no know criteria to say if it will be easy or not to maintain this phone.\n\nAs for @domubpkm comment, this is also a good question.\n\nAnd IMHO a better one than asking for a list of devices.\n\nMaybe it can be asked on the next Q&A.\n\nI don't know the effort required to maintain those.\n\nI bet clicks can be available for some time like it was before 16.04 on the open-store\n\nAnd reinstalling old release is a matter of disk space as far as I can tell, ... so maybe.\n\n@applee I agree with what you say, but there is a larger base of phone and tablet users than PC's now, just looking at sales from DELL and HP will tell you that. I remember struggling back on Ubuntu 8.04 and early versions of Puppy compiling wireless drivers whilst having Windows crammed down our throats as the best thing ever, and more recent with Broadcomm drivers. Now a lot of stuff due to what has gone on in the past, private enterprise and some manufacturers, PC support has improved massively.\n\nThe same should be happening with mobile devices, but alas manufacturers won't do it unless there is Government intervention to force the initiative of longer device life span , so you end up with Pine and Volla trying to compete in a saturated market that is governed by two companies, Apple and Google. Microsoft were late to the table and look what has happened there.\n\nThe reason why I say computers are standard as such, is I can take my old Intel P4Q6600 setup and install Linux or Windows 10 on it and it works. I can install Linux on an old Intel Macbook, it works.\n\nI know tablets and phones are different to a PC or notebook, experience and coming here and reading up on porting has told me that. I do not want to see UT go the way of the Windows phone or be forgotten about and become extinct. I will support it to the best of my ability.\n\nI've had a similar discussion with Dalton in Telegram, because I'm working on the FM radio service and getting it to work on the BQ devices requires a new kernel for them, and this led to a discussion about what we can do for them.\n\nI'm certainly willing to spend some of my time to keep these devices up, but that might not be enough: from the UBports Foundation point of view, supporting a device means (and here I might even not be aware of all the implications!) having all the CI machinery to generate the images for the updates, not to mention the time spent by humans for bug triaging.\n\nI guess that if we could reduce the involvement of the UBports Foundation to \"just\" produce a unified armhf rootfs for all these devices, that would be much easier for them, and we could probably expect a relatively high level of quality. But that means that the device maintainer would have to take care of producing the OTA images and diffs, and provide storage for them. GitLab CI can certainly help, but it's clear that the amount of work that would fall on the shoulders of the device maintainer (at least initially) is huge.\n\nDo we have a team of volunteers, who do understand enough of the OTA machinery to setup a similar project, which might or might not be hosted by the UBports Foundation? I'm certainly willing to help, but it's not something I can drive myself. And I don't think we should ask anyone who's actively working in the Foundation to spend time on this.\n\nIf we manage to form a group, and find someone willing (and capable) of leading the project, then there's some hope. Otherwise, well, I guess these devices will have to live with Xenial for how long they can.\n\n@spctrl said in Life with BQ4.5 after 20.04:\n\nIn the last Q&A Dalton gave a list of devices that will be supported with UT based on Ubuntu 20.04[1]. Unsurprisingly, the BQ4.5 isn't in that list.\n\nI think all BQ devices will become EOL and that's is just fine, but what about the rest ?!\n\nI think the development team has done a great job giving us a supported and well working 7 year old device. I for one thank them for that.\n\n+1\n\nBut now that this support will most probably end, the question is : What now?\n\nWell, I thought the following would be possible :\n\nKeep using the 16.04 LTS release without OS updates/upgrades.\n\nKeep using the apps that will still work with the 16.04 LTS as long as they do...\n\nBasically what I am doing with my current Android based ZUK Z2 Pro phone\n\nOn the one hand I want to keep using UT because I really like it. On the other hand, I don't want my phone to be left in a drawer somewhere collecting dust, so what else can we run on it after the update to 20.04 happens?\n\nYou can't use anything else because of the same reason you won't be able to upgrade to 20.04 LTS Release : The damn old MediaTek SoC and all the negative stuff that comes with the fact it's a MediaTek SoC\n\nI looked around a bit, but I don't really see options honestly.\n\nBecause there are no options!\n\nEventually it wont be (easily) possible to install apps (unless maybe the click-packages will be kept available somewhere online and we can download and install from there), and it may not be (easily) possible to install UT back to the device (unless the images and instructions are kept available somewhere).\n\nYou could check if you can boot TWRP one time and then Image your phone so you have a working backup!\n\nI also looked around for other OS'es I know about, but none of them seem to have a port for the BQ4.5.\n\nYUP!\n\nI looked for the following, but don't see ports for Lineageos\n\n(Besides, I'm unsure how well this would work on an Ubuntu edition device since it doesn't have the Android buttons),\n\nThe buttons should work but they don't have a LED that shows which button does what!\n\nI have been running Android 5.x for a while after that cruel Canonical April 1st announcement\n\nPostmarketOS, SailfishOS, LuneOS, Manjaro and Mobian\n\nThat doesn't leave much options of course. Maybe someone has other OS'es or ports they know of that can run on the BQ4.5? What are you planning to do once support ends?\n\nLike I said : NOPE.AVI\n\n@applee said in Life with BQ4.5 after 20.04:\n\nThere is rarely support for fingerprint readers on laptops for example.\n\nI think that depends on the brand that is used by the manufacturer of the laptop ?!\n\nAnd what is considered standard on a phone is far from usual on other computer stations like GPS, 2G, 3G, 4G (and now 5G) modems, accelerometer, ...\n\nLaptops with a modem are very common as long as you stay away from the consumer stuff and go towards professional/enterprise models\n\nThe reality is that manufacturers mostly don't care and support for Linux is minimum.\n\nDrivers may exist but are rarely open sourced neither is their API available...\n\nThis problem has seen no real improvement since the begining of Linux and only a faster and stronger community and some big company's policy improved the situation for end users.\n\nAMD and Intel have pretty much changed that completely and are now the two brands you really want to buy in case you are a Linux user\n\nNvidia however is on the edge of getting deprecated and even banned in some cases like the LibreELEC project for example!\n\nHopefully Pine64, Volla, F(x)Tech and others will see the benefit of working with the FOSS communities.\n\nPine64 does that already I think ?!\n\nThe other two however... dunno... seem to be more Android focused than non-Android ?!\n\nEspecially F(x)Tech and the horrible mess that their company is for example RMA wise... brr...\n\n@cliffcoggin said in Life with BQ4.5 after 20.04:\n\nThat is a straightforward management issue that should not be avoided any longer, no matter how unpopular the decision will be in some quarters.\n\nTo be honest :\n\nI think UBports has a managemend issue in general :\n\nThey need to have some kind of plan when it comes to porting to certain phone models for example!\n\nAt the moment it seems all a bit random ?!\n\nDetails about which phones will be compatible with 20.04 LTS are still unavailable...\n\netc...\n\nIs there even someone in their team to manage the whole project ?!"
