        "text": "Targeted Market\n\nThe founder of Ubuntu, Mark Shuttleworth says the developing markets such as India and China are initially targeted for Ubuntu-based smartphones as there Ubuntu pre-installed computers are already in use. Though it is an open source model like Android, it is predicted the easy or quick success for Ubuntu Touch is difficult as iOS and Android have already sealed a strong impression. It is also not exception to entrepreneurial use as “Bring your own device” method has already clicked in enterprises.\n\nDeveloper Friendly Ubuntu Touch\n\nUbuntu Touch provides Open Source Code for developers. It is shared openly throughout the development cycle. So, developers will be able to develop innovative applications.\n\nIf you are not an owner of an Ubuntu Touch smartphone, buy one to experience the innovative features of Ubuntu Touch.\n\nWho We Are and What We Do?"
