Hi everyone,

I have a Bq Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition and unfortunately I got my screen broken. So I bought a screen replacement for the device on ebay (it was not for the Ubuntu Edition but I think that I can assume it doesn't matter).

The problem is that after the replacement the screen doesn't work correctly, here is a video that shows the behaviour of the touch.

So I thought it was a problem of that specific screen but I got another one from the same seller and it still behaves that way.

Does anyone have any idea of what is going on and, if possible, how to fix it?

Thanks!
