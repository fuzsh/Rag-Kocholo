Mic in Hand: Jean Louisa Kelly – Anything Can Happen!

Hollywood’s Jean Louisa Kelly (who Westporters will know as Jean Pitaro!) comes to the Playhouse for our first Mic in Hand of 2024!

Jean is a stage and screen star from the original Broadway cast of Into the Woods, and the movies Mr. Holland’s Opus, Uncle Buck, and Top Gun: Maverick. Directed by Richard Sabellico and accompanied by award-winning musical director Paul Bogaev (who lives in Fairfield!), she takes us on a journey through the serendipitous story of her life in and out of show-business, from small-town New England to Hollywood and Broadway. With songs from Gypsy, The Fantasticks, Next to Normal, and Company, Kelly’s story is uplifting, moving and fun, leaving you with the belief that truly, “Anything Can Happen!” Other film credits include The Fantasticks, Call of the Wild, and Malignant. She also starred in the long-running CBS sitcom “Yes, Dear.” Additional theatrical productions include Reprise! musicals Company, Applause, Pippin, and The York Theatre Company’s The It Girl. She made her New York concert debut at The Laurie Beechman Theatre in 2023. Paul Bogaev has received Grammy Awards for Broadway’s Aida and the film Chicago, and an Emmy for ABC’s Annie. He was musical director for numerous Broadway shows including Sunset Boulevard, Les Misérables and films including Dreamgirls and the animated The Lion King.
