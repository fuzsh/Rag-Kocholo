Go to them and talk to Justin. No matter which option is chosen in this first encounter he will call you a poser and stop talking. Rewind time and speak to Justin again, this time using the new conversation options to convince him you are not a poser. He will ask if you want to see a noseslide or tre flip, the only way to get the photo is by picking \"tre flip\". Once that option is chosen, the skater will fall off his skateboard, which can be photographed. Once you have the picture you can simple rewind time and watch the other trick.\n\nThe next photo can be found in front of Max's dorm building. Cross the yard from the entry way and you should see Kate sitting on a bench alone. In front of her should be a tree with a squirrel to the side which you can take a picture of.\n\nThe next photo can be taken once inside Max's room. On the right as you enter the room should be a small mirror in which Max takes a picture of herself.\n\nThis photo can be taken once you finish talking to Juliet and gain access to Victoria's room.

Once you are back at the school, go to the science lab and speak to Warren. Tell him to use one of the ingredients and it won't work. Rewind time, and instead of speaking to him, talk to the teacher. Ask her about the experiment and she will bring up Chlorine.
