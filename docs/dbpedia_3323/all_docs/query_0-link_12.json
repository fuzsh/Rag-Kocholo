        "text": "Check places like your Recently Deleted or Hidden albums, your Shared Library, and iCloud Photos.\n\nCheck your Recently Deleted album\n\nIf you accidentally deleted your photo or video, it goes to the Recently Deleted album. Anything in your Recently Deleted album stays there for 30 days. After 30 days, it's permanently deleted and you can't get it back.\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nIn iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or later, go to Photos > Albums and tap Recently Deleted in the Utilities section.\n\nUse Face ID or Touch ID to unlock your Recently Deleted album.\n\nTap a photo or video, then tap Recover. To recover multiple photos, tap Select, select your photos or videos, then tap Recover.\n\nConfirm that you want to recover the photos or videos.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nIn macOS Ventura or later, open Photos and select Recently Deleted in the sidebar.\n\nUse Touch ID or your login password to unlock your Recently Deleted album.\n\nClick the photo or video.\n\nClick Recover.\n\nUnhide your photos\n\nIf you hide photos and videos, you'll see them only in your Hidden album, so it might seem like they're missing. But you can unhide your photos and videos whenever you want. With iOS 14 and later, you can hide the Hidden album so it doesn't appear anywhere in the Photos app. So if you're missing photos or videos, make sure the Hidden album is turned on so you can see it.\n\nIf you use iCloud Photos, the photos that you hide on one device are hidden on your other devices too.\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nIn the Photos app, go to the Albums tab.\n\nTap Hidden under Utilities.\n\nIn iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, or later, use Face ID or Touch ID to unlock your Hidden album.\n\nSelect the photo or video that you want to unhide.\n\nTap the More button, then tap Unhide.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nOpen Photos and in the menu bar, click View, then select Show Hidden Photo Album.\n\nIn the sidebar, select Hidden.\n\nIn macOS Ventura or later, use Touch ID or your login password to unlock your Hidden album.\n\nSelect the photo or video that you want to unhide.\n\nControl-click the photo, then choose Unhide Photo. You can also choose Image > Unhide Photo from the menu bar, or press Command-L.\n\nMake sure that iCloud Photos is turned on\n\niCloud Photos securely stores all of your photos and videos in iCloud, so that you can access them on all your devices. If you took a photo on your iPhone with iCloud Photos turned on but later turned the feature off, you might still be able to find a missing photo in iCloud Photos.\n\nOn your iPhone or iPad\n\nGo to Settings > [your name], then tap iCloud.\n\nTap Photos.\n\nTurn on iCloud Photos.\n\nOn your Mac\n\nOpen Photos, then choose photos > Settings (or Preferences) from the menu bar.\n\nClick the iCloud tab.\n\nSelect iCloud Photos.\n\nAfter you turn on iCloud Photos, you might need to connect to Wi-Fi and wait a few minutes. Then look for your photos again.\n\nCheck your iCloud Shared Photo Library\n\nIn iOS 16.1, iPadOS 16.1, and later, you can start or join an iCloud Shared Photo Library with up to five contacts. Some photos might only appear in certain library views.\n\nSwitch between your Personal Library and Shared Library on your iPhone or iPad\n\nOpen the Photos app.\n\nAt the top of the Albums or Library tabs, tap the more button in the upper right corner.\n\nChoose Personal Library, Shared Library, or Both Libraries.\n\nIn Both Libraries or Shared Library view, photos that are in the Shared Library are marked with the Shared Library icon . Photos that are in the Personal Library are marked with the Personal Library icon .\n\nLearn more about how to switch between your Personal Library and Shared Library on your iPhone or iPad\n\nSign in with the same Apple ID\n\nFor your photos and videos to stay up to date on all your devices, make sure that you sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on every device.\n\nYou can check which Apple ID your device is using in Settings. You'll see your name and email address. Your email address is your Apple ID.\n\nLearn more"
