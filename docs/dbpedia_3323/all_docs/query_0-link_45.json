        "text": "What Does Skin Cancer Look Like?\n\nSkin cancer can happen to anyone, at any age, on any part of the body. And because skin cancers appear in many shapes and sizes, they can be challenging to identify. While skin cancer pictures can be helpful in learning what skin cancer can look like, getting to know your own skin and understanding what to look for can help you detect cancer early when it’s easiest to cure.\n\nThat’s why you should examine your skin once a month. If you see something NEW, CHANGING OR UNUSUAL – even if it looks nothing like what you see in photos – do not wait! Get it checked by a dermatologist right away. Finding and treating skin cancer early can save your life.\n\nSkin Cancer Image Gallery\n\nWhat does cancer look like on skin? Below is a selection of photos that give you a general idea about what skin cancers can look like. Remember that skin cancers can look quite different from one person to another due to skin tone, size and type of skin cancer and location on the body. Skin cancer can be tricky in other ways, too. For example, melanoma is a type of skin cancer that is often pigmented tan, brown, black, even blue. But amelanotic melanoma lacks pigment and appears as a skin-tone or pink lesion.\n\nTo sum it up, while photos can be helpful, getting your skin examined by a dermatologist is the most vital step in identifying and treating skin cancer.\n\nPlease note: Since not all skin cancers have the same appearance, these photos serve as a general reference for what skin cancer can look like. If you see anything NEW, CHANGING or UNUSUAL on your skin, go get checked by a dermatologist.\n\nBasal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) Photos\n\nFor information on basal cell carcinoma signs and symptoms, visit our BCC Warning Signs page.\n\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) Images\n\nFor information on squamous cell carcinoma signs and symptoms, visit our SCC Warning Signs page.\n\nMelanoma Photos\n\nFor information on melanoma signs and symptoms, visit our Melanoma Warning Signs page.\n\nMerkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) Pictures\n\nFor information on Merkel cell carcinoma signs and symptoms, visit our MCC Warning Signs page.\n\nActinic Keratosis\n\nActinic keratosis (also known as solar keratosis) is the most common precancer. For more photos and information on actinic keratosis warning signs and symptoms, visit our Actinic Keratosis Warning Signs page.\n\nRare Skin Cancers\n\nPlease visit our Rare skin cancers page for more information and pictures of rare skin cancers such as:\n\nAcral lentiginous melanoma (ALM)\n\nCutaneous lymphoma\n\nDermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)\n\nKaposi’s sarcoma\n\nMicrocystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC)\n\nSebaceous carcinoma\n\nUndifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma\n\nExtramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD)\n\nFor links to more comprehensive skin cancer information, visit our Skin Cancer 101 page."
