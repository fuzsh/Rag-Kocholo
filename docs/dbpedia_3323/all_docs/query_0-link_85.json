        "text": "George Washington's Dentures FAQ\n\n1. Washington was afflicted with dental troubles all his adult life\n\nDespite his legendary physical strength and iron constitution, George Washington’s failing teeth were a source of regular suffering throughout his entire life. At age 24, Washington recorded in his diary that he paid 5 shillings to a “Doctr Watson” who removed one of his teeth. Letters and diary entries later in his life make regular reference to aching teeth, lost teeth, inflamed gums, ill-fitting dentures, and a host of other dental miseries. Payments to dentists and purchases of toothbrushes, teeth scrapers, denture files, toothache medication, and cleaning solutions are also regularly present in Washington’s communications throughout his life.\n\nExplore this Object\n\n2. Contrary to popular mythology, George Washington's dentures were not made of wood\n\nOne of the most enduring myths about George Washington is that his dentures were made of wood. It’s quite possible that some of his dentures, particularly after they had been stained, took on a wooden complexion, but wood was never used in the construction of any of his dental fittings.\n\nThroughout his life Washington employed numerous full and partial dentures that were constructed of materials including human, and probably cow and horse teeth, ivory (possibly elephant), lead-tin alloy, copper alloy (possibly brass), and silver alloy.\n\n3. During the Revolutionary War, Washington used a French dentist who had been providing dental services to high ranking British officers\n\nIn 1781, a pre-eminent dentist by the name of Dr. Jean-Pierre Le Mayeur escaped from British occupied New York City and passed through the nearby American lines. Le Mayeur had been providing dental services to Sir Henry Clinton, commander of the British forces in the region, and a host of other senior British officers."
