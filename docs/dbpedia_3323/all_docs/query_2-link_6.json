        "text": "What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that develops in some people who have experienced a shocking, scary, or dangerous event.\n\nIt is natural to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. Fear is a part of the body’s “fight-or-flight” response, which helps us avoid or respond to potential danger. People may experience a range of reactions after trauma, and most people recover from initial symptoms over time. Those who continue to experience problems may be diagnosed with PTSD.\n\nWho gets PTSD?\n\nAnyone can develop PTSD at any age. This includes combat veterans and people who have experienced or witnessed a physical or sexual assault, abuse, an accident, a disaster, or other serious events. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened, even when they are not in danger.\n\nNot everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. Sometimes, learning that a friend or family member experienced trauma can cause PTSD.\n\nAccording to the National Center for PTSD , a program of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, about six out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. Certain aspects of the traumatic event and some biological factors (such as genes) may make some people more likely to develop PTSD.\n\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of PTSD?\n\nSymptoms of PTSD usually begin within 3 months of the traumatic event, but they sometimes emerge later. To meet the criteria for PTSD, a person must have symptoms for longer than 1 month, and the symptoms must be severe enough to interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. The symptoms also must be unrelated to medication, substance use, or other illness.\n\nThe course of the disorder varies. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have symptoms that last for 1 year or longer. People with PTSD often have co-occurring conditions, such as depression, substance use, or one or more anxiety disorders.\n\nAfter a dangerous event, it is natural to have some symptoms. For example, some people may feel detached from the experience, as though they are observing things rather than experiencing them. A mental health professional who has experience helping people with PTSD, such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker, can determine whether symptoms meet the criteria for PTSD.\n\nTo be diagnosed with PTSD, an adult must have all of the following for at least 1 month:\n\nAt least one re-experiencing symptom\n\nAt least one avoidance symptom\n\nAt least two arousal and reactivity symptoms\n\nAt least two cognition and mood symptoms\n\nRe-experiencing symptoms include:\n\nExperiencing flashbacks—reliving the traumatic event, including physical symptoms such as a racing heart or sweating\n\nHaving recurring memories or dreams related to the event\n\nHaving distressing thoughts\n\nExperiencing physical signs of stress\n\nThoughts and feelings can trigger these symptoms, as can words, objects, or situations that are reminders of the event.\n\nAvoidance symptoms include:\n\nStaying away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience\n\nAvoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event\n\nAvoidance symptoms may cause people to change their routines. For example, some people may avoid driving or riding in a car after a serious car accident.\n\nArousal and reactivity symptoms include:\n\nBeing easily startled\n\nFeeling tense, on guard, or on edge\n\nHaving difficulty concentrating\n\nHaving difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\n\nFeeling irritable and having angry or aggressive outbursts\n\nEngaging in risky, reckless, or destructive behavior\n\nArousal symptoms are often constant. They can lead to feelings of stress and anger and may interfere with parts of daily life, such as sleeping, eating, or concentrating.\n\nCognition and mood symptoms include:\n\nHaving trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event\n\nHaving negative thoughts about oneself or the world\n\nHaving exaggerated feelings of blame directed toward oneself or others\n\nHaving ongoing negative emotions, such as fear, anger, guilt, or shame\n\nLosing interest in enjoyable activities\n\nHaving feelings of social isolation\n\nHaving difficulty feeling positive emotions, such as happiness or satisfaction\n\nCognition and mood symptoms can begin or worsen after the traumatic event. They can lead a person to feel detached from friends or family members.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or having thoughts of suicide, call or text the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline at 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org . In life-threatening situations, call 911.\n\nHow do children and teens react to trauma?\n\nChildren and teens can have extreme reactions to trauma, but some of their symptoms may not be the same as those seen in adults. In children younger than age 6, these symptoms can include:\n\nWetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet\n\nForgetting how to talk or being unable to talk\n\nActing out the scary event during playtime\n\nBeing unusually clingy with a parent or other adult\n\nOlder children and teens usually show symptoms more like those seen in adults. They also may develop disruptive, disrespectful, or destructive behaviors. Older children and teens may feel guilty for not preventing injury or deaths. They may also have thoughts of revenge.\n\nLearn more about how to help children and adolescents cope with disasters and other traumatic events.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for PTSD?\n\nNot everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD—many factors play a part. Some of these factors are present before the trauma; others become important during and after a traumatic event.\n\nRisk factors that may increase the likelihood of developing PTSD include:\n\nBeing exposed to previous traumatic experiences, particularly during childhood\n\nGetting hurt or seeing people hurt or killed\n\nFeeling horror, helplessness, or extreme fear\n\nHaving little or no social support after the event\n\nDealing with extra stress after the event, such as loss of a loved one, pain and injury, or loss of a job or home\n\nHaving a personal or family history of mental illness or substance use\n\nResilience factors that may reduce the likelihood of developing PTSD include:\n\nSeeking out support from friends, family, or support groups\n\nLearning to feel okay with one’s actions in response to a traumatic event\n\nHaving a coping strategy for getting through and learning from the traumatic event\n\nBeing prepared and able to respond to upsetting events as they occur, despite feeling fear\n\nHow is PTSD treated?\n\nIt is important for anyone with PTSD symptoms to work with a mental health professional who has experience treating PTSD. The main treatments are psychotherapy, medications, or a combination of psychotherapy and medications. A mental health professional can help people find the best treatment plan for their symptoms and needs.\n\nSome people with PTSD, such as those in abusive relationships, may be living through ongoing trauma. In these cases, treatment is usually most effective when it addresses both the traumatic situation and the symptoms of PTSD. People who experience traumatic events or who have PTSD also may experience panic disorder, depression, substance use, or suicidal thoughts. Treatment for these conditions can help with recovery after trauma. Research shows that support from family and friends also can be an important part of recovery.\n\nPsychotherapy\n\nPsychotherapy (sometimes called talk therapy) includes a variety of treatment techniques that mental health professionals use to help people identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Psychotherapy can provide support, education, and guidance to people with PTSD and their families. Treatment can take place one on one or in a group and usually lasts 6 to 12 weeks but can last longer.\n\nSome types of psychotherapy target PTSD symptoms, while others focus on social, family, or job-related problems. Effective psychotherapies often emphasize a few key components, including learning skills to help identify triggers and manage symptoms.\n\nOne common type of psychotherapy, called cognitive behavioral therapy, can include exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring:\n\nExposure therapy helps people learn to manage their fear by gradually exposing them, in a safe way, to the trauma they experienced. As part of exposure therapy, people may think or write about the trauma or visit the place where it happened. This therapy can help people with PTSD reduce symptoms that cause them distress.\n\nCognitive restructuring helps people make sense of the traumatic event. Sometimes people remember the event differently from how it happened. They may feel guilt or shame about something that is not their fault. Cognitive restructuring can help people with PTSD think about what happened in a realistic way.\n\nMedications\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a type of antidepressant medication, for the treatment of PTSD. SSRIs may help manage PTSD symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling emotionally numb. Health care providers may prescribe SSRIs and other medications along with psychotherapy. Some medications may help treat specific PTSD symptoms, such as sleep problems and nightmares.\n\nPeople should work with their health care providers to find the best medication or combination of medications and the right dose. To find the latest information about medications, talk to a health care provider and visit the FDA website .\n\nHow can I find help for PTSD?\n\nIf you’re not sure where to get help, a health care provider can refer you to a licensed mental health professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist with experience treating PTSD. Find tips to help prepare for and get the most out of your visit and information about getting help.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has a online treatment locator to help you find mental health services in your area.\n\nHere are some things you can do to help yourself while in treatment:\n\nTalk with your health care provider about treatment options and follow your treatment plan.\n\nEngage in exercise, mindfulness, or other activities that help reduce stress.\n\nTry to maintain routines for meals, exercise, and sleep.\n\nSet realistic goals and focus on what you can manage.\n\nSpend time with trusted friends or relatives and tell them about things that may trigger symptoms.\n\nExpect your symptoms to improve gradually, not immediately.\n\nAvoid the use of alcohol or drugs.\n\nHow can I help a friend or relative who has PTSD?\n\nIf you know someone who may be experiencing PTSD, the most important thing you can do is to help that person get the right diagnosis and treatment. Some people may need help making an appointment with their health care provider; others may benefit from having someone accompany them to their health care visits.\n\nIf a close friend or relative is diagnosed with PTSD, you can encourage them to follow their treatment plan. If their symptoms do not get better after 6 to 8 weeks, you can encourage them to talk to their health care provider. You also can:\n\nOffer emotional support, understanding, patience, and encouragement.\n\nLearn about PTSD so you can understand what your friend is experiencing.\n\nListen carefully. Pay attention to the person’s feelings and the situations that may trigger PTSD symptoms.\n\nShare positive distractions, such as walks, outings, and other activities.\n\nHow can I find a clinical trial for PTSD?\n\nClinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individuals may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future.\n\nResearchers at NIMH and around the country conduct many studies with patients and healthy volunteers. We have new and better treatment options today because of what clinical trials uncovered years ago. Talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, their benefits and risks, and whether one is right for you.\n\nTo learn more or find a study, visit:\n\nNIMH’s Clinical Trials webpage: Information about participating in clinical trials\n\nClinicaltrials.gov: Current Studies on PTSD : List of clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) being conducted across the country\n\nWhere can I learn more about PTSD?\n\nFree brochures and shareable resources\n\nHelping Children and Adolescents Cope With Traumatic Events: This fact sheet presents information on how children and adolescents respond to traumatic events, and what family, friends, and trusted adults can do to help.
