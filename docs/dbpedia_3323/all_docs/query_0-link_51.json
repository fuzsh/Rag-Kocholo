You also likely have the right to speak out on other public property, like plazas in front of government buildings, as long as you are not blocking access to the government building or interfering with other purposes the property was designed for.\n\nPrivate property owners can set rules for speech on their property. The government may not restrict your speech if it is taking place on your own property or with the consent of the property owner.\n\nCounterprotesters also have free speech rights. Police must treat protesters and counterprotesters equally. Police are permitted to keep antagonistic groups separated but should allow them to be within sight and sound of one another.\n\nWhen you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings and the police. On private property, the owner may set rules related to photography or video.\n\nDo I need a permit?\n\nYou don’t need a permit to march in the streets or on sidewalks, as long as marchers don’t obstruct car or pedestrian traffic. If you don't have a permit, police officers can ask you to move to the side of a street or sidewalk to let others pass or for safety reasons.\n\nCertain types of events may require permits. These include a march or parade that requires blocking traffic or street closure; a large rally requiring the use of sound amplifying devices; or a rally over a certain size at most parks or plazas.\n\nWhile certain permit procedures require submitting an application well in advance of the planned event, police can’t use those procedures to prevent a protest in response to breaking news events.\n\nRestrictions on the route of a march or sound equipment might violate the First Amendment if they are unnecessary for traffic control or public safety, or if they interfere significantly with effective communication to the intended audience.\n\nA permit cannot be denied because the event is controversial or will express unpopular views.\n\nIf the permit regulations that apply to your protest require a fee for a permit, they should allow a waiver for those who cannot afford the charge.\n\nWhat to do if you believe your rights have been violated\n\nWhen you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers' badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for.\n\nGet contact information for witnesses.\n\nTake photographs of any injuries.\n\nOnce you have all of this information, you can file a written complaint with the agency's internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI’m attending a protest\n\nYour rights\n\nYour rights are strongest in what are known as “traditional public forums,” such as streets, sidewalks, and parks.

Police may not break up a gathering unless there is a clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or other immediate threat to public safety.\n\nIf officers issue a dispersal order, they must provide a reasonable opportunity to comply, including sufficient time and a clear, unobstructed exit path.\n\nIndividuals must receive clear and detailed notice of a dispersal order, including how much time they have to disperse, the consequences of failing to disperse, and what clear exit route they can follow, before they may be arrested or charged with any crime.\n\nShare this scenario:\n\nI want to take pictures or shoot video at a protest\n\nYour rights\n\nWhen you are lawfully present in any public space, you have the right to photograph anything in plain view, including federal buildings and the police. (On private property, the owner may set rules about photography or video.)\n\nPolice officers may not confiscate or demand to view your photographs or video without a warrant, nor may they delete data under any circumstances. However, they may order citizens to cease activities that are truly interfering with legitimate law enforcement operations.\n\nIf you are videotaping, be aware that there is an important legal distinction between a visual photographic record (fully protected) and the audio portion of a videotape, which some states have tried to regulate under state wiretapping laws.\n\nWhat to do if you are stopped or detained for taking photographs\n\nAlways remain calm and never physically resist a police officer.\n\nPolice cannot detain you without reasonable suspicion that you have or are about to commit a crime or are in the process of doing so.\n\nIf you are stopped, ask the officer if you are free to leave. If the answer is yes, calmly walk away.\n\nIf you are detained, ask the officer what crime you are suspected of committing, and remind the officer that taking photographs is your right under the First Amendment and does not constitute reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n\nWhat to do if you believe your rights have been violated\n\nWhen you can, write down everything you remember, including the officers' badge and patrol car numbers and the agency they work for.\n\nGet contact information for witnesses.\n\nTake photographs of any injuries.\n\nOnce you have all of this information, you can file a written complaint with the agency's internal affairs division or civilian complaint board.\n\nShare this scenario:"
