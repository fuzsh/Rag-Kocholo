        "text": "Dear Frank,\n\nI hope you’re doing well. I’m a long-time Postsecret fan and have been reading the blog weekly since about 2007. Back in September of last year, in the “Classic Secrets” section, I happened to find my secret which I had sent and you had posted at some point back in 2009.\n\nThe context of this secret is complicated but what I really wanted to tell you is that the day I saw my secret re-posted was the same day I found out I was pregnant with my second child. I could not help but see some cosmic connection here and a profound reminder of the past.\n\nI could not be further away from the broken person I was when I made that postcard and sent it to you. I was once terrified at the prospect of being a mother (specifically that I would be a terrible mother due to childhood trauma) but with everything I have been through since, what I have come to understand is that our children do not expect us to be perfect and that all they really need is for us to love them, hold them and support them as best as we can.\n\nI read a lot of secrets here regarding reflections on childhood trauma and fraught relationships with parents and I am constantly reminded of the fragility of children and the need to be gentle with them and for those who raise children to be gentle with themselves, too.\n\nI wish I could go back in time and hug that lost and lonely woman that I was all those years ago, and yet I stop to think that all the things she experienced have led me to be the person I am now – I am happy, I have accepted myself and my flaws and see the love and kindness I show my children being reflected back to me and to the world around them.\n\nAs I sit here now, holding my baby and writing this email to you, I want people to know that life really can get better. I think Postsecret has changed a lot of minds, healed a lot of hearts and saved a lot of lives, mine included. You do good work here and this is such a special corner of the internet. Thank you for holding space for so many people, Frank.\n\nMuch love,\n\nAnonymous\n\n~~~\n\nHi Anonymous,\n\nI’m so glad you shared your ‘PostSecret journey’ with me! After 20 years of receiving secrets, one of the best parts is reading emails – like yours – from people who courageously rewrite their story.\n\nYour email has inspired me and I hope it will inspire others to share how their story changed after they let their secret go on a postcard.\n\nfrank@postsecret.com\n\n-F\n\nPS: Can I include your story in the next PostSecret book?\n\nHey Frank,\n\nTwelve years ago I mailed in my license plate with the message “I don’t know where my home is” scrawled on the front. I had just dropped out of college and moved across the country to live with my dad.\n\nA lot has changed since then, but some things haven’t. My life imploded (again) and I found myself back in my dad’s house; I changed careers, graduated college, and went to grad school. But that secret has followed me for a decade, often featured on the website or exhibits. It popped up a few weeks ago and I thought “nothing has changed, I’m still just that lost kid” and then I realized how wrong I was.\n\nI’m not sure that I feel any more at home here now than I did back then, but something has changed. I found home in myself. Finally the skin that I live in feels like enough. Thank you for being a place of growth, love, and acceptance for all these years.\n\n-E\n\n~~~\n\nHey E-\n\nI know your secret well, it has been exhibited from the Smithsonian in Washington DC, to the Museum of Us (currently) in California. Like so many of the secrets I think we try to imagine the circumstances behind it, or project our lives onto it. So it’s really cool to hear from you over a decade later to learn the story (so far) behind your secret.\n\nRecently, we had your license plate professionally photographed. Soon it will be part of a large online exhibition of ‘naked mail’ (that’s what the post office calls it). I’ll include the photo below, along with a postcard that arrived recently that I feel speaks to your story.\n\nIt feels poetic that you wrote and mailed your secret on a license plate. Twelve years ago you started this long journey that gave you license to redefine your home – and your story.\n\nYour secret definitely has a home, so glad you found yours.\n\n-Frank\n\nTo: “frank” <frank@postsecret.com>\n\n—-Email Message—–\n\nDear Frank-\n\nI was at your book reading at Booksmith on Haight street for ‘A Lifetime of Secrets’. It was absolutely wonderful. You signed my book and at that point I had only flipped through the pages.\n\nWell, I sat down to read the book tonight and was overcome with shock, surprise and emotion when I saw my secret. It is written in red sharpie and reads: “I was adopted. I’ve seen pictures of my birth mother but not of my birth father. I am terrified that he will recognize me on the street one day. Every time I see a guy who looks about 35 I look for common features between us. It didn’t used to bother me but somehow it has turned into my greatest fear. I’m only 18 but I’m afraid this will plague me the rest of my life…”\n\nI immediately started to cry. The amazing thing is. I was at your book reading last night with my birth father, Eric (you signed his book to Meghan). I met him last April, and I couldn’t be more happy to have met him, and my birth mother. He was the one who told me about your book reading.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nThank You, to everyone in the PostSecret community who has donated their money or time to suicide prevention. As someone who has answered those phones on the overnight shift, I can tell you, There Is Hope And There Is Help.\n\nIn the early aughts, Frank Warren ran a medical document delivery business in Germantown, Maryland. It was a monotonous job, involving daily trips to government offices to copy thousands of pages of journal articles for pharmaceutical companies, law firms, and non-profits. By his early forties, he had a house in a nice subdivision, a wife, a young daughter, and a dog. His family fostered children for a few weeks or months, and he felt a sense of purpose in helping kids who were suffering acute crises in their own homes. From the outside, things appeared to be going better than well. But inside, something was missing: A sense of adventure, or at least a little fun. An outlet to explore the weirder, darker, and more imaginative parts of his interior world. He’d never been one for small talk, preferring instead to launch into deep discussions, even with people he barely knew. He wondered if he could create a place like that outside of everyday conversation, a place full of awe, anguish, and urgency.\n\nIn the fall of 2004, Frank came up with an idea for a project. After he finished delivering documents for the day, he’d drive through the darkened streets of Washington, D.C., with stacks of self-addressed postcards—three thousand in total. At metro stops, he’d approach strangers. “Hi,” he’d say. “I’m Frank. And I collect secrets.” Some people shrugged him off, or told him they didn’t have any secrets. Surely, Frank thought, those people had the best ones. Others were amused, or intrigued. They took cards and, following instructions he’d left next to the address, decorated them, wrote down secrets they’d never told anyone before, and mailed them back to Frank. All the secrets were anonymous.\n\nInitially, Frank received about one hundred postcards back. They told stories of infidelity, longing, abuse. Some were erotic. Some were funny. He displayed them at a local art exhibition and included an anonymous secret of his own. After the exhibition ended, though, the postcards kept coming. By 2024, Frank would have more than a million.\n\nContinue Reading. . ."
