Use of a New York Public Library card is non-transferrable, i.e., can only be used by the person whose name appears on the card.\n\nThe above status entitles you to one New York Public Library card. The Library will merge or delete the records of any user found to have multiple active cards.\n\nAny organization that operates in the 5 boroughs of NYC is eligible to apply for a New York Public Library Organizational Borrower’s card free of charge valid for one year.\n\nAll materials borrowed must be returned on or before the due date. The Library offers universal returns – most circulating material can be returned to any New York Public Library location in the Bronx, Manhattan or Staten Island, except the Schomburg Center. Likewise, pickup of holds and payment of fees may take place at any Library location with the exception of Schomburg.\n\nFees are charged for lost or damaged items.\n\nCardholders are responsible for all materials borrowed on their card, all use of the card and all charges made against it, until the card is reported lost to the Library.\n\nEligibility Requirements\n\nWhen applying for a New York Public Library card in person, or providing proof of their eligibility to receive a digital card, an applicant must show proof that he/she lives, works, attends school, or pays property taxes in New York State. To apply for a card:\n\nAdults may provide only one piece of identification if it is 1 of the following valid New York State or City IDs:\n\nCurrent driver's license\n\nCurrent photo learner's permit\n\nCurrent non-driver's identification (includes IDNYC)\n\nIf the above documentation is not available, any 2 of the following forms of identification are acceptable for adults and/or young adults, provided one shows a photo and name and/or signature and the other the applicant's current address:\n\nCurrent college or university photo ID card\n\nCurrent employee photo ID card\n\nNew York City welfare ID card\n\nCurrent Armed Services ID card\n\nAlien Registration photo ID card\n\nMatricula Consular (Mexican CID)\n\nCurrent passport\n\nMedicare/Medicaid card\n\nNew York State motor vehicle registration\n\nProfessional, vocational or union photo ID\n\nCurrent rent bill or lease agreement\n\nTax bill or receipt**\n\nTransit pass\n\nCurrent photo ID with signature and expiration date issued by an embassy or consulate in New York\n\nStatement from a homeless shelter*\n\nBank statement**\n\nCable, phone or utility bill**\n\nAny piece of mail delivered by the US Post Office**\n\nChildren ages 0-12 must have their application completed and signed by a parent or guardian.

Cardholders are required to report change of name or address information promptly.\n\nDigital Library Cards\n\nAs long as your location within New York State can be verified, you can receive a free digital library card right now using the online application. With a digital library card, you get free access to the Library’s wide array of digital resources—including e-books, databases, educational resources, and more. Digital library cards do not provide access to Culture Pass.\n\nIf you are within New York State but your location cannot be verified via the online form, you will still receive a temporary library card that allows you to place holds on physical items. Please visit a branch or email gethelp@nypl.org to complete the process and receive your digital library card.\n\nSpecial Notes on Young Adult Borrowers\n\nYoung Adults who are age 13 through 17 or are in the seventh to twelfth grade are not required to present identification to obtain an application for a library card.\n\nYoung Adult borrowers have access to the same library materials as Adult borrowers.\n\nParents/guardians of teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 may be given information about overdue materials only, upon presentation of the youth’s library card barcode number, printed overdue notice, or personal identification that confirms that the adult is the youth’s parent/guardians\n\nSpecial Notes on Juvenile Borrowers\n\nChildren may be present to receive their library cards, but their presence is not required.\n\nA children’s application form must be signed by a parent or guardian. If a parent/guardian is not present, the library card application must be taken home for completion and signature. A parent or guardian does not need to be present for a child with a signed library card application to be issued their card.\n\nOn the library card application, parents/or guardians determine whether their child may borrow all library materials or only juvenile materials.\n\nParents or legal guardians can register children under the age of 13 for a digital account through the SimplyE app.\n\nParents/guardians are responsible for the lost or damaged materials borrowed by their children\n\nSpecial Notes on Organizational Borrowers\n\nCards of this type are available only to organizations located in the five boroughs of NYC.\n\nIn order to receive an organizational borrower’s card, a brief letter of request on organizational letterhead must be submitted along with the completed application form. The authorized person who signs the application form must show identification and his/her name will be added to the record alongside the name of the organization.\n\nOnly one card will be issued to any organization. The organization will be responsible for all materials borrowed.\n\nIf the organization has a change of address or phone number, or the card is lost, the library must be notified immediately.\n\nAll regulations of the New York Public Library apply to the organizational borrower’s card.\n\nOrganizational cards are valid for one year.\n\nSpecial Notes on Homebound/Books by Mail Borrowers\n\nThe books-by-mail program is for individuals who can use regular library materials, but are unable to leave their homes due to a temporary or permanent disability. Applications are available in all neighborhood branch libraries or by calling (212) 621-0564 or TTY (212) 930-0020 - 24 hours a day, 7 days per week. See Services for Persons with Disabilities: Books By Mail for more details.\n\nSpecial Notes on Non-Resident (Visitor) Borrowers\n\nVisitors from out-of-state or abroad are welcome to use the Library’s resources on-site. Non-residents may be issued a visitor's library card on-site,with a three month expiration date.\n\nIn order to qualify for a three month visitor account applicants must present photo id and proof of address (i.e. passport and utility bill) for their locality.\n\nSpecial Notes on Brooklyn and Queens Public Library Card Holders\n\nAs a courtesy to other New York City library ​users, Brooklyn Public Library and Queens Library cardholders may use their existing card once it is linked to ​their ​NYPL​ account​.\n\nMaterials borrowed from The New York Public Library branches cannot be returned at the Brooklyn Public Library or The Queens Borough Public Library.\n\nMaterials borrowed from the Brooklyn Public Library or The Queens Borough Public Library must be returned to their respective branch libraries.\n\nRenewing or Validating Your Library Card\n\nAll adult, teen and child library cards for cardholders in the NY Metro area and NY State expire and must be renewed every three years.\n\nExpired cards must be renewed/validated before they can be used to borrow materials, download content from eNYPL or The Library's online databases, or access Library computers.\n\nIf you still have your card at the date of its expiration and you wish to renew it, there is no need to apply for a new card.\n\nFor adult patrons: The above-mentioned forms of identification must be presented to renew or validate your library card. Additional required information may be requested by the Library as needed.\n\nCards issued to patrons from outside of NY State and/or the NY Metro area or patrons who do not meet the above eligibility criteria expire at shorter intervals, require similar identification and must be renewed in person.\n\nOrganization and Educator cards expire after one year.\n\nLibrary cards cannot be renewed and contact/personal information cannot be updated by phone.\n\nRenewal/Validation for Cardholders in the Metro Area\n\nCardholders in the NY Metro area (the 5 boroughs of NYC) must visit any New York Public Library location in the Bronx, Manhattan or Staten Island in order to renew their card.\n\nRenewal for Non-Metro NY Cardholders\n\nIf you reside in New York State please submit a scan or pictures of (2) two pieces of mail, delivered within the last (2) two months to your New York State address. Please include your name, and your Library card number (to be renewed). In the Subject Line type Card Renewal. You can email patronaccounts@nypl.org\n\nVisitor Cards may be renewed in-person at any NYPL location with proof of permanent address and photo ID. The Library does not renew Visitor Cards online.\n\nLinking Your Record\n\nApplicants for a library card are given the option to \"link\" their record to another patron on our application form. This service allows increased ease of navigation between physical cardholders belonging to the same family when they are borrowing materials from the branches. Note that linking patron records is solely intended to expedite circulation transactions by allowing for quick navigation between one linked record and the next.\n\nLinking records does not give a patron the ability to view online, request or borrow items on a card belonging to a patron to whom they are linked.\n\nHold Pickup Authorization\n\nIn situations where you would like to authorize another NYPL cardholder (e.g. a spouse or caretaker) to collect requested items, you can call 917-275-6975 ext 3 or your local branch. After staff verbally verify your account information a note stating the name of the person who will pick up holds on your behalf will be placed on the records of both patrons. This permits only the checkout of your hold requests that are ready for pickup. Please make sure the person retrieving your hold(s) has your library card - if they only have your card number, they must present photo I.D.\n\nLost and Replacement Library Cards\n\nWhen you register for a New York Public Library card, you accept responsibility for all items on the card, all use made of the card and all charges made against it until your card is reported lost. The Library must have a record of your card having been reported lost, or it is not considered lost. Therefore it is to the patron’s benefit to report the loss or theft of a library card immediately.\n\nThe cost of replacing a lost or stolen library card is $1.00. This fee is assessed at the time the card is reported lost.\n\nReport lost cards by phone, in person at any Library location, or by e-mail. Patrons who live outside the five boroughs in New York State should e-mail patronaccounts@nypl.org a scan of their photo ID with proof of address and an indication that a replacement card is requested.\n\nLibrary Notices\n\nThe New York Public Library provides a notification service for held items, overdue materials and other service-specific reasons. Notices are available via telephone or e-mail and the method by which you receive them is chosen at the time you apply for a card. Additionally, notices and bills for lost material will be sent to the mailing address on record at the Library. Cardholders are required to select a notice preference and to provide a valid telephone number or e-mail address on their account. Additionally, it is the responsibility of the borrower to notify the Library if any of their contact information changes.\n\nIf you receive a paper bill notice for a lost item and the address listed on the notice is no longer up to date, you may mail in your corrected address on the postage paid mailer. However, your card will be blocked until you have verified the change of address on your next visit to the library.\n\nNote: In the case of borrowers who receive their notices by e-mail, it is their responsibility to make sure that e-mails sent from addresses with @nypl.org in the sender information be allowed through any filters they may have in place on their Inbox.\n\nLibrary notices are sent as a courtesy. Failure to receive a notice does not absolve the borrower from any fees attached to their patron record.\n\nEducator Cards\n\nTo facilitate the Library's outreach efforts to NYC schools, we are pleased to offer expanded access to library resources and services through our Educator Cards. This card, available to Educators employed at Pre-K-12 schools as well as staff employed at daycares, camps, afterschools, and homeschooling parents, offer significantly more privileges than those available on personal cards. Learn more.\n\nDownloadable Application Forms\n\nAs an alternative to our online application form, eligible applicants may download and print a library card application to complete in advance of their visit to a library location. The required forms of identification listed above must be presented for any application submitted."
