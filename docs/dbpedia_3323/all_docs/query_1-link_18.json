        "text": "Stress is a natural reaction to specific demands and events, but ongoing stress can affect a person’s health and wellbeing. Tips for managing stress include exercise, setting priorities, counseling, and more.\n\nThese demands can come from work, relationships, financial pressures, and other situations, but anything that poses a real or perceived challenge or threat to a person’s well-being can cause stress.\n\nStress can be a motivator, and it can even be essential to survival. The body’s fight-or-flight mechanism tells a person when and how to respond to danger. However, when the body becomes triggered too easily, or there are too many stressors at one time, it can undermine a person’s mental and physical health and become harmful.\n\nStress is the body’s natural defense against predators and danger. It causes the body to flood with hormones that prepare its systems to evade or confront danger. People commonly refer to this as the fight-or-flight mechanism.\n\nWhen humans face a challenge or threat, they have a partly physical response. The body activates resources that help people either stay and confront the challenge or get to safety as fast as possible.\n\nThe body produces larger quantities of the chemicals cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These trigger the following physical reactions:\n\nincreased blood pressure\n\nheightened muscle preparedness\n\nsweating\n\nalertness\n\nThese factors all improve a person’s ability to respond to a potentially hazardous or challenging situation. Norepinephrine and epinephrine also cause a faster heart rate.\n\nEnvironmental factors that trigger this reaction are called stressors. Examples include noises, aggressive behavior, a speeding car, scary moments in movies, or even going out on a first date. Feelings of stress tend to increase in tandem with the number of stressors.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association (APA)’s annual stress survey in 2018, average stress levels in the United States were 4.9 on a scale from 1 to 10. The survey found that the most common stressors were employment and money.\n\nMental health resources\n\nVisit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information and resources on mental health and well-being.\n\nStress slows down some normal bodily functions, such as those that the digestive and immune systems perform. The body can then concentrate its resources on breathing, blood flow, alertness, and the preparation of the muscles for sudden use.\n\nThe body changes in the following ways during a stress reaction:\n\nblood pressure and pulse rise\n\nbreathing speeds up\n\ndigestive system slows down\n\nimmune activity decreases\n\nmuscles become more tense\n\nsleepiness decreases due to a heightened state of alertness\n\nHow a person reacts to a difficult situation will determine the effects of stress on overall health. Some people can experience several stressors in a row or at once without this leading a severe stress reaction. Others may have a stronger response to a single stressor.\n\nAn individual who feels as though they do not have enough resources to cope will probably have a stronger reaction that could trigger health problems. Stressors affect individuals in different ways.\n\nSome experiences that people generally consider to be positive can lead to stress, such as having a baby, going on vacation, moving to a better home, and getting a promotion at work.\n\nThe reason for this is that they typically involve a significant change, extra effort, new responsibilities, and a need for adaptation. They also often require a person to take steps into the unknown.\n\nA person may look forward to an increased salary following a promotion, for example, but wonder whether they can handle the extra responsibilities.\n\nA persistently negative response to challenges can have an adverse effect on health and happiness.\n\nFor example, a 2018 review of studies found associations between work-related stress and coronary heart disease. Despite this, the authors could not confirm the exact mechanisms through which stress causes coronary heart disease.\n\nOther literature has shown that people who perceive stress as having a negative effect on their health may be at higher risk for coronary heart disease than those who do not.\n\nHowever, being more alert to the effects of stress may help a person manage it more effectively and cope better.\n\nThe National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) recognize two types of stress: acute and chronic. These require different levels of management.\n\nThe NIMH also identify three examples of types of stressor:\n\nroutine stress, such as childcare, homework, or financial responsibilities\n\nsudden, disruptive changes, such as a family bereavement or finding out about a job loss\n\ntraumatic stress, which can occur due to extreme trauma as a result of a severe accident, an assault, an environmental disaster, or war\n\nAcute stress\n\nThis type of stress is short-term and usually the more common form of stress. Acute stress often develops when people consider the pressures of events that have recently occurred or face upcoming challenges in the near future.\n\nFor example, a person may feel stressed about a recent argument or an upcoming deadline. However, the stress will reduce or disappear once a person resolves the argument or meets the deadline.\n\nAcute stressors are often new and tend to have a clear and immediate solution. Even with the more difficult challenges that people face, there are possible ways to get out of the situation.\n\nAcute stress does not cause the same amount of damage as long-term, chronic stress. Short-term effects include tension headaches and an upset stomach, as well as a moderate amount of distress.\n\nHowever, repeated instances of acute stress over an extended period can become chronic and harmful.\n\nChronic stress\n\nThis type of stress develops over a long period and is more harmful.\n\nOngoing poverty, a dysfunctional family, or an unhappy marriage are examples of situations that can cause chronic stress. It occurs when a person can see no way to avoid their stressors and stops seeking solutions. A traumatic experience early in life may also contribute to chronic stress.\n\nChronic stress makes it difficult for the body to return to a normal level of stress hormone activity, which can contribute to problems in the following systems:\n\ncardiovascular\n\nrespiratory\n\nsleep\n\nimmune\n\nreproductive\n\nA constant state of stress can also increase a person’s risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can develop when stress becomes chronic.\n\nChronic stress can continue unnoticed, as people can become used to feeling agitated and hopeless. It can become part of an individual’s personality, making them constantly prone to the effects of stress regardless of the scenarios that they encounter.\n\nPeople with chronic stress are at risk of having a final breakdown that can lead to suicide, violent actions, a heart attack, or stroke.\n\nPeople react differently to stressful situations. What is stressful for one person may not be stressful for another, and almost any event can potentially cause stress. For some people, just thinking about a trigger or several smaller triggers can cause stress.\n\nThere is no identifiable reason why one person may feel less stressed than another when facing the same stressor. Mental health conditions, such as depression, or a building sense of frustration, injustice, and anxiety can make some people feel stressed more easily than others.\n\nPrevious experiences may affect how a person reacts to stressors.\n\nCommon major life events that can trigger stress include:\n\njob issues or retirement\n\nlack of time or money\n\nbereavement\n\nfamily problems\n\nillness\n\nmoving home\n\nrelationships, marriage, and divorce\n\nOther commonly reported causes of stress are:\n\nabortion or pregnancy loss\n\ndriving in heavy traffic or fear of an accident\n\nfear of crime or problems with neighbors\n\npregnancy and becoming a parent\n\nexcessive noise, overcrowding, and pollution\n\nuncertainty or waiting for an important outcome\n\nSome people experience ongoing stress after a traumatic event, such as an accident or some kind of abuse. Doctors will diagnose this as PTSD.\n\nThose who work in stressful jobs, such as the military or the emergency services, will have a debriefing session following a major incident, and occupational healthcare services will monitor them for PTSD.\n\nThe physical effects of stress can include:\n\nsweating\n\npain in the back or chest\n\ncramps or muscle spasms\n\nfainting\n\nheadaches\n\nnervous twitches\n\npins and needles sensations\n\nA 2012 study found that the stressors that parents experience, such as financial troubles or managing a single-parent household, may also lead to obesity in their children.\n\nEmotional reactions can include:\n\nanger\n\nburnout\n\nconcentration issues\n\nfatigue\n\na feeling of insecurity\n\nforgetfulness\n\nirritability\n\nnail biting\n\nrestlessness\n\nsadness\n\nStress-associated behaviors include:\n\nfood cravings and eating too much or too little\n\nsudden angry outbursts\n\ndrug and alcohol misuse\n\nhigher tobacco consumption\n\nsocial withdrawal\n\nfrequent crying\n\nrelationship problems\n\nIf stress becomes chronic, it can lead to several complications, including\n\nanxiety\n\ndepression\n\nheart disease\n\nhigh blood pressure\n\nlower immunity against diseases\n\nmuscular aches\n\nPTSD\n\nsleeping difficulties\n\nstomach upset\n\nerectile dysfunction (impotence) and loss of libido\n\nA doctor will typically diagnose stress by asking an individual about their symptoms and life events.\n\nDiagnosing stress can be challenging because it depends on many factors. Doctors have used questionnaires, biochemical measures, and physiological techniques to identify stress. However, these may not be objective or effective.\n\nThe most direct way to diagnose stress and its effects on a person is through a comprehensive, stress-oriented, face-to-face interview.\n\nTreatment includes self-help and, when an underlying condition is causing stress, certain medications.\n\nTherapies that may help a person relax include aromatherapy and reflexology.\n\nSome insurance providers cover this type of treatment. However, it is important for people to check coverage with their provider before pursuing this treatment. Knowing the details about a potential treatment can help prevent it from adding to any ongoing stress.\n\nMedicines\n\nDoctors will not usually prescribe medications for coping with stress, unless they are treating an underlying illness, such as depression or an anxiety disorder.\n\nIn such cases, they may prescribe an antidepressant. However, there is a risk that the medication will only mask the stress, rather than help the person deal with it. Antidepressants can also have adverse effects, and they may worsen some complications of stress, such as low libido.\n\nDeveloping coping strategies before stress becomes chronic or severe can help an individual manage new situations and maintain their physical and mental health.\n\nPeople who are already experiencing overwhelming stress should seek medical assistance.\n\nPeople may find that the following lifestyle measures can help them manage or prevent stress-induced feelings of being overwhelmed.\n\nExercise: A 2018 systematic review of animal studies found that exercise can reduce memory impairment in subjects with stress, although studies on humans are necessary to confirm this.\n\nReducing the intake of alcohol, drugs, and caffeine: These substances will not help prevent stress, and they can make it worse.\n\nNutrition: A healthful, balanced diet containing plenty of fruit and vegetables can help maintain the immune system at times of stress. A poor diet can lead to ill health and additional stress.\n\nPriority management: It may help to spend a little time organizing a daily to-do list and focusing on urgent or time sensitive tasks. People can then focus on what they have completed or accomplished for the day, rather than on the tasks they have yet to complete.\n\nTime: People should set aside some time to organize their schedules, relax, and pursue their own interests.\n\nBreathing and relaxation: Meditation, massage, and yoga can help. Breathing and relaxation techniques can slow down the heart rate and promote relaxation. Deep breathing is also a central part of mindfulness meditation.\n\nTalking: Sharing feelings and concerns with family, friends, and work colleagues may help a person “let off steam” and reduce feelings of isolation. Other people may be able to suggest unexpected, workable solutions to the stressor.\n\nAcknowledging the signs: A person can be so anxious about the problem causing the stress that they do not notice the effects on their body. It is important to be mindful of any changes.\n\nNoticing signs and symptoms is the first step to taking action. People who experience work stress due to long hours may need to “take a step back.” It may be time for them to review their working practices or talk to a supervisor about finding ways to reduce the load.\n\nMost people have an activity that helps them relax, such as reading a book, going for a walk, listening to music, or spending time with a friend, loved one, or pet. Joining a choir or a gym also helps some people relax.\n\nThe APA encourage people to develop networks of social support, for example, by talking to neighbors and others in the local community or joining a club, charity, or religious organization.\n\nThose who often feel as though they do not have the time or energy for hobbies should try some enjoyable new activities that make them feel good. People can turn to their support network if they need ideas.\n\nBeing part of a group can reduce the risk of stress developing and provide support and practical help when challenging circumstances develop.\n\nPeople who find that stress is affecting their daily life should seek professional help. A doctor or psychiatric specialist can often help, for example, through stress management training.\n\nStress management techniques\n\nStress management can help by:\n\nremoving or changing the source of stress\n\naltering how a person views a stressful event\n\nlowering the effects that stress might have on the body\n\nlearning alternative ways of coping\n\nStress management therapy pursues one or more of these approaches.\n\nPeople can develop their stress management techniques by using self-help books or online resources. Alternatively, they can attend a stress management course.\n\nA counselor or psychotherapist can connect an individual who has stress with personal development courses or individual and group therapy sessions.\n\nRead the article in Spanish."
