        "text": "Debt collectors often have a reputation for being obnoxious, rude, and even scary while trying to get borrowers to pay up. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was enacted to curb annoying and abusive behaviors. Even so, some debt collectors flout the law. Here are five tactics that debt collectors are specifically forbidden from using.\n\nDebt collectors generally are legitimately working to try to recoup funds legally owed to a lender. A company may use debt collectors when they have exhausted all other means of getting their money. Being aggressive is part of the nature of this job, but there are legal boundaries on how debt collectors can act.\n\nHere are five practices that a debt collector may not use to try to collect money from you.\n\n1. Pretend to Work for a Government Agency\n\nThe FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from pretending to work for any government agency, including law enforcement. They also cannot claim to be working for a consumer reporting agency.\n\nDebt collectors cannot pretend to be a police offer and threaten to arrest or press criminal charges against you if you don't repay their debts. The law forbids them from misrepresenting themselves as working under as working under contract for federal and state government agencies.\n\n2. Threaten to Have You Arrested\n\nCollection agencies cannot falsely claim that you have committed a crime or say you will be arrested if you don't repay the money they say you owe.\n\nFirst of all, the agencies cannot issue arrest warrants or have you put in jail. Furthermore, failing to repay a credit card debt, mortgage, car loan, or medical bill in a timely manner doesn't land you in prison.\n\nHowever, if you receive a legitimate order to appear in court on a matter related to a debt and you don't show up, the judge could issue a warrant for your arrest. And, if you fail to pay a court fine related to your debt, or refuse to pay taxes or child support, you could go to jail.\n\n3. Publicly Shame You\n\nDebt collectors are not permitted to try to publicly shame you into paying money that you may or may not owe.\n\nIn fact, they're not even allowed to contact you by postcard. They cannot publish the names of people who owe money. They can't even discuss the matter with anyone other than you, your spouse, or your attorney.\n\n4. Try to Collect Debt You Don’t Owe\n\nSome debt collectors will knowingly or unknowingly rely on incorrect information to try to get money out of you.\n\nThe creditor you originally owed the money to may have sold your debt to a collection agency, which in turn may have sold it to another collection agency. A mistake in the process could result in the collector contacting you with incorrect information.\n\nOr, the agency might be trying to collect a debt from you that has already been discharged in bankruptcy or even one that is owed by someone else with a similar name.\n\nWithin five days of first contacting you, a debt collector must send you a written notice stating how much you owe, to whom, and how to make your payment. You might have to prompt them to do this.\n\nIf you aren't sure whether you owe a debt, send a letter to the collector via certified mail with a return receipt asking for more information. Be careful not to assume any responsibility for the debt.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provides sample letters to debt collectors that you can use to ensure you don't say the wrong thing or give out more information than necessary.\n\n5. Harass You\n\nThe law lists specific ways in which debt collectors are not allowed to harass you. They are not permitted to:\n\nThreaten you with violence or harm\n\nUse obscene or profane language\n\nCall you repeatedly\n\nCall you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. without your permission\n\nCall you at work, if you forbid it in writing\n\nContact you at all if you tell the collector, in writing, to stop contacting you altogether or to contact only your attorney.\n\nEven if you take that last step, there are still some circumstances that allow debt collectors to contact you again: They can contact you to let you know they will no longer be contacting you or to tell you that a lawsuit has been filed against you.\n\nIf you receive a court summons for a lawsuit regarding your debt, don't ignore it. An unscrupulous debt collector might fabricate such a document, or it might be legitimate.\n\nIf you get a summons, look up the court's contact information online (not on the notice you were sent) and contact the court directly to confirm that the notice is accurate. Don't use the address or phone number on the document you receive.\n\nException to The FDCPA Rules\n\nThere's an important exception to the FDCPA: In-house debt collectors aren't subject to it. For example, if you are delinquent on your retailer's credit card bill and the retailer calls you directly, it doesn’t have to follow the rules described above.\n\nMost in-house collectors go after debts that are only a few weeks or months delinquent. After that, the original creditor usually hires a collection agency to collect on its behalf or sells your debt to a debt buyer who gets to keep what it collects. In that case, the collectors would be subject to the FDCPA.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
