        "text": "Note: Some of the instructions in this article reflect changes available as part of the public preview program and might undergo further updates before being released publicly. If your experience doesn’t line up with this article, switch to Teams public preview.\n\nIn Teams, teamwork and communication happen in channels. A channel is a single place for a team to share messages, tools, and files.\n\nChannels can be organized by group, project, feature, or whatever else is relevant to you.\n\nTeam members can adjust or limit the notifications they're getting from a channel.\n\nThreads allow for focused and organized side conversations within channels.\n\nTop things to know about channels:\n\n1. Channels sit inside of teams\n\nTeams are made up of channels, which are the conversations you have with your teammates. Channels sit inside of teams, similar to how files sit inside folders. Each channel is dedicated to a specific topic, department, or project.\n\nFor example, the Mark 8 Project Team team has General, Design, Digital Assets Web, and two more channels. All the conversations, meetings, files, and apps in the Design channel have to do with design, and everything in this channel is visible to everyone on the Mark 8 Project Team team.\n\nChannels are where the work gets done—where text, audio, and video conversations open to the whole team happen, where files are shared, and where apps are added.\n\nWhile channel conversations are public, chats are just between you and someone else (or a group of people). Think of them as instant messages in other messaging apps.\n\nChannels can be organized around anything. When you're naming a channel, try to use names that clearly describe the topic. Simple, intuitive names are best.\n\nNote: If you're working in Teams offline, or on a low-bandwidth network, you'll be able to switch between chats and channels and keep working. You'll see everything from the last time we were able to sync to your network, and we'll trickle messages in as bandwidth allows.\n\n5. You can add more tabs\n\nTo put apps and files in tabs at the top of a channel, select Add a tab next to a tab name. You'll see a list of things to add (favorite apps and files). You can also search for a specific item you want to add.\n\nOne great addition to your team channel is the Wiki tab, a smart-text editor that doubles as a communication machine where you draft, edit, and chat all in one place. For more about this, see Add and use a Wiki tab in Teams.\n\n7. Show and hide teams to stay organized\n\nAfter the General tab, channels are organized alphabetically. You can't change the order, but you can show or hide them as desired. Select More options next to a channel, then Show or Hide.\n\nWant to get a team back in your list? Scroll to the bottom. Under Hidden teams, find the team you want back and select More options > Show.\n\nRelated articles\n\nLearn about teams\n\nCreate a standard or private channel\n\nCreate a shared channel"
