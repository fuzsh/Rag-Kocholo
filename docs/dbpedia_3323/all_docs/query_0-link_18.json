Read about getting support if you've experienced domestic abuse.\n\nGet your photos and videos removed\n\nWait until the police say it's okay to do this because they may still be gathering evidence.\n\nThe following steps aren't appropriate for removing images of children under 18. These images shouldn't be viewed by anyone except specially trained organisations. Report a sexual photo or video of a child on the Internet Watch Foundation website. They'll try to have the image or video removed for you.\n\nThere are several steps adults can take:\n\nfind out which websites have a copy of the image or video - try a reverse image search. Find out how on the Google support website\n\ncontact the owner of each website - they're called the webmaster. You can ask them to remove the photo or video although they don't have to agree. Find out how to contact them on the Google support website\n\nreport users or content on social media\n\nask search engines to remove images - find out how on the Google support website\n\nHow to report users and content on social media\n\nMost social media platforms let you report a user or inappropriate content directly:\n\nFacebook - see the facebook help centre\n\nTwitter - see the Twitter help centre\n\nSnapchat - see snapchat support\n\nTumblr - see the tumblr community guidelines\n\nInstagram - see the instagram help centre\n\nTikTok - see the TikTok support centre\n\nIf a website or app refuses to remove your photos or videos\n\nThe webmaster doesn't have to agree to remove the photo or video.\n\nIf they don't you could contact them again, with representation from a lawyer or Citizens Advice Bureau adviser. Explain the situation and that the photos or videos are part of a criminal investigation. This may persuade them to remove them.\n\nThe Revenge Porn Helpline can help you get images and videos removed through it's partnerships with Facebook and other social media platforms.\n\nIn some cases you may be able to create new online content, like websites, blogs and images, to move content that you don't want others to see further down in search engine results.\n\nThere are also some companies that charge fees to remove images and pictures from the internet for you, often called \"reputation management\". This can be very expensive.\n\nWhat's the crime\n\nThe law comes from the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) Act 2016. There's a similar offence in England and Wales.\n\nIt’s not a crime to send intimate images or videos of yourself privately to another person if you're both consenting adults.\n\nIt's a crime to show intimate images or videos, send them to another person, upload them to a website, or threaten to do this, without your consent. This includes so called 'revenge porn'.\n\nRevenge porn can be a form of abuse. It's a way for someone to control their partner or ex-partner. In some cases personal contact details are given which leads to the victim being harassed or puts the victim in danger.\n\nRead examples of situations covered by the law on the Not Yours to Share website.\n\nThe person sharing the image or video must have meant to cause fear, alarm or distress, or was reckless as to whether it would cause this. Recklessness means that it was a foreseeable result of their actions.\n\nIt's not a crime to share intimate photos or videos if they're already in the public domain with the consent of the person in them. For example, if a person takes a sexual photo of themselves and uploads it to a public website, people sharing the photo wouldn't be committing a crime.\n\nWhat kind of photos and videos are covered\n\nPhotos or films are \"intimate\" and covered by the law when they show:\n\na person doing or present during a private sexual act\n\ngenitals, buttocks or breasts - exposed or covered only with underwear.\n\nAn image or film could be:\n\nin a digital format (for example, on a messaging app like WhatsApp)\n\non a mobile phone\n\n'hard copy' or printed - including negatives\n\nstored electronically on a hard drive or disk\n\ncopies of the originals - including screenshots\n\ndigitally enhanced or manipulated - meaning images that are Photoshopped, but not images that are completely computer-generated\n\nsexts - sexual images sent by text message\n\nTexts or emails, without images, aren't covered by the law. They may be covered under another crime such as 'threatening or abusive behaviour'. You should still contact the police on 101 or speak to someone at your local police station.\n\nWhat is consent\n\nImages or videos may be sent willingly to another person as part of a healthy relationship. No one should be coerced or forced to send these.\n\nNo matter why an image or video was taken or sent, most people don't expect or want them being shared more widely. You should treat any photos or videos you get as private. Don’t share them, upload them or show them to others.\n\nThere's a defence to the crime if the person in the images or videos consented to them being shared, or you \"reasonably believed\" that they consented. This is something you would need to provide evidence for in court.\n\nThere's also a defence if the person in the image or video chose to put themselves in an intimate situation in public, like streakers or naked protesters.\n\nIf you're under 18 and your photos or videos have been shared\n\nYou're protected by the law against sharing intimate images and there are also specific criminal laws to protect children. It's a crime to take, make, share or keep an indecent photo or video of a child under 18. The only exception is when 16 or 17 year olds take intimate photos with a spouse or partner and they're not shared with anyone else.\n\nIf photos or videos of you are shared you can:\n\nreport it to Police Scotland on 101\n\nphone Childline for advice on 0800 1111 - they also have online advice about sexting\n\nreport a photo or video to the Internet Watch Foundation - they'll try to have it removed for you\n\nIf you're worried about who you've been talking to online, speak to an adviser at the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre.\n\nYou can also speak to your parents or someone else you trust, like a teacher.\n\nIf you've shared someone else's private, intimate photos or videos\n\nYou should get advice from a solicitor who specialises in criminal law. Try the 'find a solicitor' tool on the Law Society of Scotland's website.\n\nYou may be eligible for legal aid to help with the costs of a solicitor.\n\nThe police may take away your phone, laptop or other possessions during an investigation. Read more about police powers to stop and search, enter private property and seize goods.\n\nIf you're arrested or detained by the police you have certain rights. Read more about being arrested and held in custody by the police in Scotland.\n\nStaying safe online\n\nThere are lots of resources for staying safe online and protecting your private data including:"
