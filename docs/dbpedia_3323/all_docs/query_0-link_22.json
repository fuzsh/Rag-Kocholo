        "text": "Hi,\n\nThank you for your question and reaching out.\n\nI understand that you're having issues with the Windows picture password. Have you tried checking this registry path Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System and see if the BlockDomainPicturePassword: REG_DWORD has a value of 0?\n\nIf yes, it is really possible that the current user profile is faulty so you might want to consider creating a new user profile then transfer the files from Windows C > Users folder. If you don't prefer doing so for now, I recommend performing a repair installation process. This is a repair installation process that will repair your Windows system and at the same time fix all the possible corruptions and complete missing components - that could cause the issue.\n\nIf you're using a Windows 10 device, you may follow the steps below:\n\nVisit the site below to start downloading the Media Creation Tool.
