        "text": "The greatest girl group ever had its origins in the late 1950s in Detroit's Brewster Projects. At the beginning the girls formed a quartet and named themselves \"The Primettes\", achieving mild success locally and recording a single for the Lupine record label. They ended up being a trio in 1960 shortly after they were signed by Detroit-based Motown, a record company founded by Berry Gordy. At Gordy's request, the trio formed by Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson and Diana Ross became The Supremes.\n\nIn spite of the support of Motown writers and producers such as 'Smokey Robinson' and Gordy himself, the group spent a few years recording songs that disappeared into oblivion as soon as they were released. During those early years it was generally accepted that \"Flo\" Ballard had the strongest, more soulful voice to lead the group, but Gordy decided that Diane Ross had a more \"commercial sound\" and she became the lead singer in most of their recordings. However, his enthusiasm was not initially shared by other producers and musicians who found Ross' voice too high-pitched and nasal. In late 1963 The Supremes were turned over to the in-house production team formed by Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian Holland and Eddie Holland. From the very beginning the collaboration worked like magic when their first release, \"When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\" became a top 40 hit nationwide providing the first hint of the girls potential.\n\nFor the next release, Holland-Dozier-Holland picked \"Where Did Our Love Go,\" a song that nobody thought much of. First they tried recording it with The Marvelettes but the group rejected it. Then they switched to The Supremes with Mary Wilson in mind to sing the leads but Mary didn't like the song either. Finally the song was cut with Ross singing in Wilson's lower mezzo-soprano register resulting in a sound that was sexy, romantic and extremely commercial. By pure chance they had stumbled into the right key for Diane Ross and a unique sound for The Supremes. \"Where Did Our Love Go\" was up and running as soon as it was released, an instant million seller for the group. But this was only the beginning of a Cinderella-like story that would make the girls from Detroit a legendary institution. As The Supremes kept topping the charts (\"Baby Love,\" \"Come See About Me,\" \"Stop! In The Name Of Love,\" \"Back In My Arms Again,\" \"Nothing But Heartaches\") their presence was requested on national television,live concerts and even films. Here another miracle happened when audiences - of all races, social and economic backgrounds - fell in love with these charming black princesses, impeccably groomed, made up and dressed in gowns that in time became more and more extravagant. Their individual personalities so endearing, their harmonies so unique, their movements so graceful, the public just couldn't get enough of The Supremes and by 1965 they were the undisputed No. 1 female group in the country competing with The Beatles for most #1 hits in the charts. Their contribution to the civil rights movement should not be underestimated; suddenly, they were \"the face\" of Black America and it was a face of beauty, of glamour and of unity, an image everyone could identify with.\n\nAbout this time Diane decided to use the name in her birth certificate which, by a spelling error, had been entered as \"Diana\". This is the year also in which her relationship with 'Berry Gordy Jr'. becomes a full fledged love affair although the details are kept away from the press and the fans. The Supremes continued turning out hits such as \"I Hear A Symphony,\" \"My World Is Empty Without You,\" \"You Can't Hurry Love,\" \"Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart\" and they were clearly \"the sound of young America\" but Gordy had a broader vision for them. Now that he had the kids listening to the group, the next step was to conquer the adults. The Supremes were the first R & B group to perform at the famed \"Copacabana Night Club\" in New York, enchanting audiences with their rendition of old American standards, songs from Broadway and Hollywood productions and their Motown hits. This was surely a well calculated gamble which paid off immediately. Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard were now perceived as much more than a rock group. Actually they had become the embodiment of the American dream and as performers they were now in the same league as Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand or Judy Garland. They constantly appeared on television with the greatest names in show business from Bobby Darin to Ethel Merman, Bob Hope or Bing Crosby. Looking at their seasoned performances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" (the new title of Toast of the Town (1948) and other TV shows it is easy to forget that these ladies were barely 20 years old.\n\nBy 1966 the first rumors of dissension within the group leaks out. 'Berry Gordy Jr.', had made the decision that Diana Ross would become a solo artist and The Supremes just a showcase for her talents, sort of a launching pad. This turn of events was not received well by Mary and \"Flo\" as their own talents became relegated to background singers for a super star. It should be remembered that The Supremes owed their sound in recordings to Diana Ross and the lady deserved the extra credit for being an exceptional talent, but on TV or in concerts, audiences were fascinated by all three Supremes, by their performances and by their individual personalities. Gordy knew the dangers of this situation so he pursued the strategy of minimizing The Supremes impact in favor of asserting the name and appeal of Diana Ross. A disgruntled 'Florence Ballard' began drinking and her behavior became erratic both on and off stage. The hits kept coming (\"You Keep Me Hangin' On,\" \"Love Is Here But Now You're Gone,\" \"The Happening\") but there was internal turmoil and tensions. In 1967, two major changes were instituted: \"Flo\" was dismissed and replaced with Cindy Birdsong (of Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles) and the group became officially known as \"Diana Ross and The Supremes\".\n\nAs with the Ross-Gordy relationship, the details of Ballard's departure were kept under wraps. The group went on to higher success, becoming more sophisticated than ever and performing in the best venues not only in America but all over the world. Beautiful Cindy Birdsong had her own charismatic presence and was accepted by audiences everywhere. However the departure from Motown of Holland-Dozier-Holland dealt a blow to the girls recording career. Their last hits with H-D-H were \"Reflections\" and \"In And Out of Love\" but from there on their presence on the charts became hit and miss. They bounced back with \"Love Child\", \"I'm Living In Shame\" and \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" a \"duet\" with The Temptations with whom the ladies also appeared in two highly rated television specials: TCB (1968) and G.I.T. on Broadway (1969). Their recordings of \"The Composer\" and \"No Matter What Sign You Are\" didn't do what expected but by the end of 1969 the ladies released another million seller, \"Someday We'll Be Together\" as it was announced that Diana would no longer be with the group. Their last concert together was in January 1970, an emotional farewell performance at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nThe career of Diana Ross as a solo artist struggled at the beginning but with Gordy's guidance and Motown resources solidly behind her she became the star of the 70s with such unforgettable recordings as \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" and \"Touch Me In The Morning\" becoming one of the world's highest paid performers. Ross demonstrated her unique talents both as a singer and as an actress in the 1972 film Lady Sings the Blues (1972) based on the life of Billie Holiday, which won her an Oscar nomination. About this time it was expected that Ross and Gordy would make their relationship public but Diana surprised everybody by marrying Robert Ellis Silberstein on 20 January 1971. It was obvious that Ross was beginning to question Gordy's leadership both in her career and her private life. As far as The Supremes were concerned both Diana and Berry tried to convince the public that the group no longer mattered. The pitch went out that The Supremes had been great because Diana was great and now it was no longer important. At Motown there was room for only one diva act and the name was Diana Ross, a gross miscalculation that would eventually backfire.\n\nIn spite of Motown's lack of support, The Supremes continued their successful recording career well into the 70s with Chicago born singer Jean Terrell replacing Diana. Top 10 hits such as \"Up The Ladder To The Roof\", \"Stoned Love\", \"Nathan Jones\" and half a dozen of excellent albums, including collaborations with The Four Tops, kept the name alive and had the potential to go on into new heights. The girls continued to be a big draw in concerts and television and it seemed the group was destined to live forever. This threw a wrench in the Motown machinery since they couldn't afford having a newcomer like Terrell with Wilson and Birdsong at her side compete with Ross for number one spots on the charts. Something had to be done fast to send The Supremes into oblivion. Most of the fans stood solidly behind The Supremes while Motown quietly pulled the plug off the most successful female trio in the business. The lack of company support eventually created dissension within the group. By 1973 Jean Terrell quit and was replaced by Scherrie Payne; Cindy Birdsong left the group not once but twice, being replaced in each instance by Lynda Laurence and Susaye Greene. Surprisingly, during these confusing times, The Supremes recorded excellent material that kept the fans interested but the group was doomed.\n\nThe real shocker came in 1976 when original Supreme Florence Ballard died of heart failure in Detroit. After leaving the group she had tried to launch a solo career and landed a recording contract with ABC Records. However her first two singles didn't do well and ABC lost interest. Among rumors of industry blacklisting, \"Flo\" ended up destitute and on welfare in order to feed her three daughters. For The Supremes (Mary, Scherrie and Susaye) the final performance came in 1977 at the Drury Lane Theater in London but it was not the end of the legend... Diana Ross, whose career was grossly over-managed at Motown, signed with RCA and enjoyed recording success through the mid 1980s when, suddenly, the hits just stopped coming. She maintained her super star status on the concert circuit but her career decisions and choice of material began to be questioned. In 1983 Motown produced a TV special to celebrate their 25th Anniversary which was planned as a reunion of the old Detroit gang. The Supremes were invited to reunite for the occasion but during their performance it was obvious that Diana was not comfortable singing with her old partners. The audience gasped when it saw Ross pushing Wilson but this was edited out of the TV special and the home video release. Mary Wilson tried to launch a solo career but record companies were just not interested and rumors of blacklisting resurfaced. She managed to continue singing all over the world and in 1986 surprised everyone with a candid autobiography titled \"Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme\" which became a best seller, actually the biggest rock and roll autobiography in history. There was a sequel titled \"Supreme Faith: Someday We'll Be Together\" which was also well received by the public. In Mary's books, The Supremes are presented both as an American dream and an American tragedy.\n\nFar from dying, The Supremes became cult figures with their recordings constantly on release, lots of air play, the subject of hundreds of articles, dozens of books, documentaries and TV specials. They are the inspiration behind the Broadway hit and film Dreamgirls (2006) and the film Sparkle - Der Weg zum Star (1976), their music heard in dozens of film soundtracks. The 80s and the 90s witnessed several ex-Supremes revivals in the concert circuits including the \"Mary Wilson Supremes Revue\" and reunions by Jean Terrell with Lynda Laurence and Scherrie Payne. In the late 80s and well into the 90s, The Supremes received important recognition such as a \"star\" in Hollywood's Walk of Fame and the induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which were attended by Mary Wilson with the daughters of 'Florence Ballard'.\n\nIn 2000, Diana Ross herself tried to invigorate her career by planning a \"Millennium Supreme reunion\" with Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong but both ladies declined the invitation, alleging being denied input in the shows. Also there was quite a difference between the salaries of Diana and those of Mary and Cindy. Undaunted, and making the same mistake all over again, Miss Ross deludes herself into thinking that the important part of this \"Supreme reunion\" is HER participation and substitutes her former partners with Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence to serve as background singers in a monumental tour of the United States. Mary counterattacked publicly about this \"fake reunion\" and the tour was canceled after playing a few dates to half filled venues.\n\nMeanwhile, The Supremes recordings keep getting reissues and continue to sell very well. Lately, scores of previously unreleased Supremes recordings are being issued for the first time, while songs like \"Baby Love,\" \"I Hear a Symphony,\" \"You Can't Hurry Love\" and \"Someday We'll Be Together\" remain perennial favorites worldwide. As for the ladies themselves, Diana continues touring in spite of many personal problems which have even brought her in confrontation with the law. She has been known to check herself into \"rehab clinics\" in at least two occasions. Mary also continues touring both as a singer and a lecturer and was named by the Bush administration (2002) \"United States ambassador of good will.\" She has also appeared in the film \"Only The Strong Survive\" while Cindy Birdsong leads a quite life in Los Angeles as a Christian minister helping out disadvantaged young people. In 2004 Mary and Cindy reunited for the Motown 45 (2004) TV special where they sang a medley of Supremes hits with Kelly Rowland, of Destiny's Child substituting the elusive Diana Ross. Whatever happens in the future for these ladies it is clear that The Supremes legend has stood the test of time and will continue. At their prime they touched so many lives and excelled in so many ways that their impact seems destined to live forever. Where did our love go? Nowhere. It's still here baby, baby...\n\nThe Zombies were formed in 1961 by students Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson and Hugh Grundy. They later brought in bassist Paul Arnold, who in turn brought in Colin Blunstone as lead singer. They first called themselves The Mustangs, then The Sundowners, before finally settling on The Zombies. The band began its musical career performing 1950s rock standards at various clubs, dances and other venues, which was common for young rock bands at the time.\n\nArnold decided that he really didn't want a musical career (he eventually became a doctor) and left the band, to be replaced by Chris White. The band began gathering a following in mid-1962 in the St. Albans area. In 1963 they were approaching college age and began to discuss breaking up, as several members were thinking about going to university. That same year they entered a rock contest in which first prize was a recording contract with Decca Records. They made the finals and, even before the winner was chosen, they impressed Decca executives so much that they were offered a contract anyway (as it turned out, they actually did win the contest). In 1963 they began recording for Decca. The producer assigned by the label to work with them heard a song written by Argent, \"She's Not There\", and strongly pushed for it to be released as the group's first single. It became an immediate smash. It was played on a British music show, Juke Box Jury (1959)--a British version of Bandstand (1952)--and, as it happened, George Harrison of The Beatles was on the panel that week and loved the song. It wasn't long before the record shot to #1 on the US pop charts.\n\nThe next single, \"Leave Me Be\", didn't do particularly well, but their following one, \"Tell Her No\", made the Top 10 in the US (although, for some reason, it was only a minor hit in Britain). The band toured the US with such artists as Patti LaBelle, The Shirelles and Ben E. King, among others. As successful as they were in the US, they were an even bigger hit in Asia (in The Philippines they once had five records in the Top 10 at the same time).\n\nIn 1965 the band did the soundtrack for the film Bunny Lake ist verschwunden (1965), and made a brief appearance in the film as themselves. Unfortunately, the film was not successful. In addition, the records they were putting out didn't sell well. The band also began having problems with Decca, which they believed wasn't letting them do the kind of music they wanted to do, and they eventually split from the label. They were signed by CBS Records, for which they recorded the album \"Odessey and Oracle\", which was finished at The Beatles' Abbey Road Studios in 1967. After the album was done, the band broke up. Although CBS didn't want to release an album by a band that no longer existed, CBS staff producer Al Kooper--the founder of Blood Sweat & Tears--finally persuaded them to release it, and it came out in July of 1968. The first single from the album, \"Care of Cell 44\", didn't do particularly well, and neither did the next two tracks that were released as singles. The label agreed to release one more cut off the album as a single, and no more. That cut was \"Time of the Season\". It went nowhere in the UK, but a radio station DJ in the US was entranced by it and kept playing it over and over. It began to catch on, and by late 1968 it had cracked the Top Five charts in the US. Although CBS wanted the band to re-group for more albums and concert promoters offered the band enormous sums of money to re-form and tour, by this time the band had already been broken up for a year--by which time Rod Argent and Chris White had already formed the band Aster Argent and Colin Blunstone had embarked on a solo career--and the members declined. They did reunite in 1991 to record the album \"New World\", but it was never released in the US (where the band was always a bigger draw than they were in the UK). On November 25, 1997, all of the original band members reunited on stage at The Jazz Club in London and played live together for the first time in almost 30 years. Three years later Rod Argent and Bluntone began touring together. Although they used their individual names, promoters began to bill them as The Zombies, and the duo eventually went along with it.\n\nPaul Atkinson, who had retired as a performer and began a career as an A&R man, died in Santa Monica, Califonria, on April 1, 2004."
