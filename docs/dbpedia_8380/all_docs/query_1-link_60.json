        "text": "Well, what do you know, the Butte College football team is off to its first 5-0 start since the Jeff Jordan era began with the 2006 season.\n\nJordan, the longtime offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach under former head coach Craig Rigsbee before replacing Rigsbee two seasons ago, has the Roadrunners playing great football and winning in different ways this season.\n\nWhether it”s a defensive battle as was the case with Saturday”s 24-17 home victory over San Joaquin Delta at Cowan Stadium, or racking up ridiculous point totals as has also been the way Butte has won this season, the Roadrunners head into their bye week with an undefeated record.\n\nThey”ll have two weeks to prepare for City College of San Francisco, a program that has dominated the NorCal Conference and Northern California community college football in general since the days of O.J. Simpson in the 1960s.\n\nThe last time Butte beat San Francisco was in 2002, when current Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was directing the Roadrunner offensive attack and tight end Garrett Cross was leading the state in touchdown catches by a tight end before both Rodgers and Cross went to California the following year to play for coach Jeff Tedford.\n\nThe Rams of CCSF have since beaten Butte five straight times, and while they came into the weekend with a 2-2 record, that doesn”t mean San Francisco isn”t a good team. They always hit hard, and they have an offensive system that sends receivers all over the field in trying to take advantage of mismatches.\n\nWhat”s nice to see for Butte fans is that Jordan has kept up the tradition of recruiting top-shelf talent to play for his teams. The Roadrunners” roster has some local players, but they also have guys from all over the country, and that may be why they”re ranked No. 11 in the JCGridiron.com national poll.\n\nI”m sure Jordan and everybody associated with Butte football would just as soon choose to forget the 2006 season, when the Roadrunners went 2-8 (0-5 in the NorCal Conference), and the two wins matched the 1985 team for the lowest total in program history.\n\nLast year, Butte went 7-4, earned its first bowl win since 2003, yet only went 2-3 in conference play. That”s because the NorCal is one of the toughest conferences in the state.\n\nWhile it”s great to see Butte and Jordan get off to their 5-0 start, the key to how successful this season will end up being is how well they do in the conference. If they can keep winning, keep climbing up in the polls and stay healthy, then maybe this year could be the first time Jordan adds a conference title to his list of accomplishments.\n\nSports Editor Dave Davies” column appears Sundays.
