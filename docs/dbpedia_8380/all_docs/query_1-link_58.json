        "text": "The Chico, Oroville and Paradise areas have all found great representation in their athletes recently, whether it’s on ESPN, or in the pages of our newspaper or others.\n\nAaron Rodgers, the former Pleasant Valley High and Butte College standout (I know everybody hates for us to keep repeating that phrase in NFL stories, but it’s what makes those national stories local), was touted before the season began as a possible No. 1 pick for fantasy football drafts. The Packers and Rodgers came into today’s game, in New York against the Jets, tied with the Chicago Bears atop the NFC North at 4-3, after opening the season as many pundits’ Super Bowl team from the NFC. Lots of people said they were the best team in the NFL.\n\nRodgers has still put up good numbers, averaging 263 yards passing per game with 12 touchdowns and an uncharacteristic nine interceptions. It’s just that the Packers have been riddled with key injuries, making Rodgers’ job that much tougher. I’m thinking they’ll still reach the playoffs, and Rodgers might make his second Pro Bowl.\n\nFrom a small Associated Press story and thanks also to a tip from her mom, Wendy, we learned that Chico’s Emily Azevedo has again made the U.S. women’s bobsled team for the upcoming World Cup season.\n\nMany may remember Azevedo from her fifth-place showing with driver Bree Schaaf at the Vancouver Winter Olympics last February. She has been traveling the World Cup circuit since the 2006-07 season, and her powerful legs built from years of starring in track and field, at Chico High and UC Davis, have helped make her into one of the top bobsled push athletes in the world.\n\nShe even stopped by the Enterprise-Record office after her return from Vancouver to meet the folks here, and a nicer young woman I’ve never met. Fifth-best in the world was also enough to make her the Chico Sportsperson of the Year at the annual Chico Sports Hall of Fame and Senior Athletes Banquet sponsored by the Enterprise-Record last May.\n\nAdd to those two Chico’s Brett Ratliff, who started the year in the mix in the Cleveland Browns’ quarterback competition. The Browns let him go, but Ratliff quickly landed on the Jacksonville Jaguars’ practice squad. That didn’t work out either, so he spent a very brief amount of time on the New England Patriots’ practice squad, only to be re-signed by the Browns. Ratliff’s goal is to become a starter, and I’m sure I’m not alone in hoping he achieves that.\n\nIf you’ve watched any TV coverage of college football this year, you also know the name of Paradise’s Jeff Maehl, the best receiver on the University of Oregon’s football team, which came into the weekend ranked No. 1 in the nation by the Associated Press. For some reason, the BCS computers don’t like the Ducks much, but ESPN analysts like Kirk Herbstreit think Maehl could also soon be playing in the NFL.\n\nThis year’s Butte College football team has worked its way into the top 10 in the JCGridiron.com national rankings for community colleges. Were it not for a very close, tough loss to perennial national power City College of San Francisco, head coach Jeff Jordan and his Roadrunners might have been on their way to a possible repeat as state and national champions, adding to the titles Jordan led them to in 2008. Still, top 10 in the nation is pretty good.\n\nThrow into the mix all the league and Northern Section championship events in high school and college fall sports like golf, tennis, soccer, field hockey, swimming and cross country, and you get the idea — this area remains a hotbed for some of the most talented athletes from any place you can name.\n\nComing up in two weeks: high school football playoffs.\n\nLet the games begin, and continue as long as people are willing to pay us to write about them.\n\nSports Editor Dave Davies’ column appears Sundays.
