        "text": "It's been too long since I've posted anything related to the Kinks, my second favorite band (after the Beatles, of course).\n\nThis is a great concert by Dave Davies, lead guitarist for the Kinks and brother of the band's lead singer and main songwriter, Ray Davies. (By the way, their last name is pronounced like it's \"Davis.\") I've posted some of Dave Davies' stuff already, but I just want to reiterate that he gets overlooked due to his more famous and prolific brother.\n\nIf Ray Davies was both the Lennon and McCartney of the Beatles, then it's a very apt comparison to consider Dave Davies the George Harrison of the group. For one, they're both lead guitarists. But also, Dave would write some songs, typically only one an album, but they'd be at the same standard as the rest, and fit in stylistically.\n\nBy the time of this concert, the Kinks had petered out, with this last concert in 1996. Naturally, Dave switched to a solo career. In 2000, he released an album called \"Rock Bottom: Live at the Bottom Line.\" The songs on that were selected from a series of concerts at the Bottom Line in late 1997. This was one of those concerts. However, I ran this album through the copyright violation detector at YouTube, and it only found two similarities (\"Wicked Annabella\" and one of the talking tracks). So I think this has very little overlap in terms of exact performances, even though most of the songs were the same.\n\nIn my opinion, this concert is significantly better than the \"Rock Bottom\" live album. One big advantage is that it's longer by about 20 minutes. So it has all the songs that one has, plus a few more. In terms of sound quality, it's an excellent soundboard, just as good as the official album. Also, I prefer to hear full concerts, warts and all, instead of live albums culled from a bunch of different concerts, so one can get a better sense of what the live experience was really like.\n\nNote that eleven of the songs here were written or co-written by Dave, but eight were solely written by his brother Ray. I believe the Ray ones are tracks 3, 4, 5, 9, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 30. Plus, tracks 11, 29, and 31 are covers.\n\nThis album is an hour and 32 minutes long.\n\n01 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n02 Look through Any Doorway (Dave Davies)\n\n03 Wicked Annabella (Dave Davies)\n\n04 I Need You (Dave Davies)\n\n05 She's Got Everything (Dave Davies)\n\n06 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n07 Creepin' Jean (Dave Davies)\n\n08 Love Me Till the Sun Shines (Dave Davies)\n\n09 Tired of Waiting for You (Dave Davies)\n\n10 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n11 Milk Cow Blues (Dave Davies)\n\n12 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n13 It's Too Late (Dave Davies)\n\n14 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n15 Imagination's Real (Dave Davies)\n\n16 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n17 Party Line (Dave Davies)\n\n18 Love Gets You (Dave Davies)\n\n19 Picture Book (Dave Davies)\n\n20 Too Much on My Mind (Dave Davies)\n\n21 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n22 Death of a Clown (Dave Davies)\n\n23 Get Back in Line (Dave Davies)\n\n24 Strangers (Dave Davies)\n\n25 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n26 Fortis Green (Dave Davies)\n\n27 Living on a Thin Line (Dave Davies)\n\n28 talk (Dave Davies)\n\n29 One Night (Dave Davies)\n\n30 All Day and All of the Night (Dave Davies)\n\n31 Money [That's What I Want] (Dave Davies)\n\n32 David Watts (Dave Davies)\n\n33 You're Lookin' Fine (Dave Davies)\n\n34 Lincoln County (Dave Davies)\n\nhttps://www.imagenetz.de/htPYb"
