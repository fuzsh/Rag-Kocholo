        "text": "Following the very sad death yesterday of longtime Kinks musician Ian Gibbons, Ray Davies, Dave Davies and Mick Avory fondly remember their good friend and collaborator.\n\n“To simply say Ian will be missed would be an understatement,” Ray Davies said. “My first thoughts are for his family and loved ones.\n\n“When he auditioned for the band, he only played a few chords before I knew he was the right guy to have on keyboard, he seemed to know the right voicing to musically slot in between the other members of the band,” Ray fondly recalls. “And with the Kinks, that took some doing!\n\n“He was also was a brilliant accordion player and apparently, a bit of a childhood prodigy on that instrument. In the studio, he would willingly try out the most random musical idea I would throw at him. On the road, he could always be guaranteed to give a smile of encouragement from his side of the stage and buy a round in the bar after the show so we could have a party in Ian’s noisy room. Being in a band is like being in a family and today it is as though we have lost family member.\n\n“Right now I’m thinking of his smile, his cheeky chappie sense of humour and generous grin that made you feel it was ok, even though there was an eight hour bus ride ahead after a long show and the air conditioning has broken down. Though, somehow we’d get over the discomfort, reach the next venue and go onstage, fresh again. I DON’T KNOW HOW TO FINISH THIS, PERHAPS I DON’T WANT TO.\n\nDave Davies says: “Apart from being a great professional, Ian always had a positive attitude to being on the road and recording. In the many years he worked with The Kinks, he added great colour and dimension to The Kinks’ music and he was a good friend. I’ll miss him greatly. Lots of love to his family and friends at this difficult time.”"
