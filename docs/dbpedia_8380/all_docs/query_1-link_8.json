        "text": "As the rising torrent of Britpop anniversary slaver sweeps the Kinks' Ray Davies to new peaks of deification, his estranged brother, Dave – playing his first UK show in 13 years – seems hell-bent on reminding us that their band weren't just about whimsical vaudevillian portraits of seductive transvestites, leeched-dry millionaires and South Bank snogs. Dave was, after all, the guitar legend who slashed his amp with a razorblade to create the savage tone to You Really Got Me, arguably the first metal song, and it's this barbed thread of their legacy that Davies pulls taut tonight.\n\nWith the mild slur of a stroke survivor and guru smock of a meditator who believes mystical intelligences once explained the secrets of universal physics to him through the medium of odour, Davies and his supply teacher-ish band rock far harder than they look. Traversing the narrower, meatier back-alleys of the Kinks' catalogue – libidinous 60s B-side I Need You, pioneering raga See My Friends, anti-conformity anthem I'm Not Like Everybody Else – Davies revels in soft metal fretwork so redolent of his notorious young lusts that they prompt a cascade of bras during Creepin' Jean. Tracks from last year's sixth solo album, I Will Be Me, exude a self-knowing verve: Remember the Future is a rare spiritual, whereas Little Green Amp, named after that doomed speaker cone of '64, seems to be built around the All Day and All of the Night riff played backwards.\n\nBrute force and an elated attitude outweigh his fragility, but when he strays down Ray's more pastoral paths, Davies struggles. Tired of Waiting for You is particularly wobbly and a ballad segment finds Dave straining for harmonies and fumbling emotional weight. The misty-eyed Young and Innocent Days, dedicated to Ray, is a touching memorial to a brotherly love that, despite Ray allegedly stamping petulantly on Dave's 50th birthday cake, has shown recent signs of resurrection. Although it takes spirited romps through Dead End Street, All Day … and You Really Got Me to finally shove Terry and Julie firmly off Hungerford Bridge."
