        "text": "Mention the Kinks and many people will think of happy singalongs at summer festivals, timeless songs, fond family memories, sparkling English afternoons. But spend any time with those same beloved songs and a far stranger picture soon emerges. Go and listen to them again now – “Waterloo Sunset”, “Sunny Afternoon”, “Days”, all the others – and tell me I’m wrong. This is a twilight world of greed and paranoia, doubt and alienation, heartache and desolation, as much as it is one of community knees-ups and happily knowing your place in the scheme of things. These are songs full of shifty lines and unreadable tones that never quite add up to any obvious pay-off message.\n\nIn some odd way it seems as if Ray Davies has been mourning something from the first moment he began writing and performing music. Perhaps one source is the loss of his beloved sister Rene, who died unexpectedly in 1957, aged 30, dancing one summer evening in the Lyceum Ballroom on the Strand. (It was the eve of Ray’s 13th birthday and Rene had just given him his first guitar. Psychoanalysts form an orderly queue, please.) North London in the 1950s is the lost paradise in this particular family tale: Muswell Hill, Crouch End, Highgate, Archway. Unlike other 1960s countercultural heroes, you never got the sense Davies was anticipating some grand hedonistic utopia. His heart was always halfway back in the gaudy recesses of the past – frilly-suited dance bands, the steam of Saturday morning cafes, half-empty football terraces. If 60s contemporaries such as the Beatles and the Stones name-checked Kenneth Anger and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Tariq Ali and Jean-Luc Godard, for Davies it was all about getting a handle on his inner Max Miller. (He even developed a separate persona to channel the bawdier, more raucous parts of himself, and always referred to this half-camp wide boy in the third person as “Max”.) Compared with the funky jet set experimentalism of Jagger/Richards and Lennon/McCartney, the Kinks could feel like a far more comforting small-town soap opera. The reason those other songwriting partnerships worked so well is they comprised characters who were virtual emotional opposites.\n\nBut Davies’s in-crowd other was a spooky photocopy of himself – his younger brother Dave. Dave, however, proved to be both too similar and too different, and the dishy Davies siblings became renowned for the ferocity and regularity of their fallings-out. It’s all about the love of family but also the feared and awkward intimacy that comes with it – the bother of having a brother by your side at all times. You get the distinct sense it wasn’t so much that Ray was irked by aspects of Dave’s behaviour (although he was) – it was a more fundamental, almost ontological, niggle: he just wished Dave had never been there at all. Ray should have been the only male child getting all the Oedipal worship due. “I’m not like everybody else,” Ray jubilantly chorused. Except he was: he was exactly like Dave.\n\nEarly on in A Complicated Life, Johnny Rogan quotes Marianne Faithfull: “The Kinks were very gothic. Creepy and silent. They never spoke. They were uptight and fearful of everyone. Underneath there was all this weird dysfunctional family stuff going on.” Great quote. The trouble is, it manages to say more in a few lines than Rogan manages in 750-plus pages. In the absence of any obvious psychological acuity, Rogan interviews an apparently endless supply of people who testify to what a horror show it was dealing (separately) with Ray or Dave, or with Dave and Ray together. I don’t think I’ve ever read a biography in which such a gap emerged between the public image of a beloved entertainer (and the affection it is generally guaranteed), and how much they were privately loathed by anyone who ever had to work with them. If the book’s testimony is to be believed, it seems that no one who ever worked with Ray has a good word to say about him. The nearest we get to anything like a tender emotion would be the strained sort of pity people feel for Dave because he’s had to put up with even more of Ray’s awful behaviour than they have. But then it turns out they don’t have anything better to say about Dave. For anyone who ever worked with the Kinks there seems to have come in to play something like the obverse of Stockholm syndrome – Archway syndrome? Not only do you not come to better appreciate or understand your captors, you uncover fresh levels of disaffection you didn’t know you possessed. Rogan conjures an atmosphere of such unrelentingly petty vindictiveness I was reminded more than once of the old Monty Python Piranha Brothers sketch. “He kicked me in the head a few times onstage when things went wrong … but that was on the spur of the moment. He came up later and apologised for it.” Oh, that lethal combination of casual ultra-violence and vicious sarcasm.\n\nYou’re also reminded of the two ageing comedians in The Sunshine Boys, stuck in a partnership neither wants but both apparently need on some obscure level. This has been their entire life, more or less. (Ray: “I don’t think we were allowed to finish growing up. There’s a certain amount of us that’s incomplete. I think of me as an incomplete person.”) Rogan never really gets anywhere under the turbid surface to explore why all this was seemingly foredoomed. We just get the huffy primal scene over and over again. And the book itself becomes the equivalent of being trapped on an endless tour with the squabbling Davies brothers. I’m a Kinks fanatic, but about a third of the way through I’d quite happily have cast the book aside and never gone near it again.\n\nDavies wrote nearly all of his best work during a sweet cusp moment – halfway between the end of empire and the beginnings of both rock culture and postmodernity. Here is a potentially wonderful fable to do with legacy and heritage, family and nation. Sadly, Rogan is very much from the “just the facts, man” school of biography. He is obviously a diligent researcher – but you need more than oodles of bone-dry facts for a book this length. It requires someone who could take those facts and turn them into something more readable, and even half as rich and strange as his subject. Rogan is great on things like legal small print and off-stage squabbles, but he struggles to bring the music alive. At no point does he make you want to rush off and play individual songs or albums again. When he does get round to that wonderful cache of 60s/70s Kinks hits, he has a tendency to wander off into contextual blether and lose the thread of what makes the music so unique. He starts in on that “memorable summer chart topper” “Sunny Afternoon”, then loses his way in two whole pages of awkward meteorological scene-setting such as this: “City gents loosened their ties and paraded the streets in shirtsleeves; parks were full of teenage girls and middle-aged women, sporting swimsuits and even bikinis, whose straps were lowered to the maximum level that decency allowed, much to the amazement of priapic schoolboys who had never witnessed such ample displays of cleavage and hidden flesh.” This is followed up by several stupefying paragraphs recording all the different prices in several London clubs of the time. “Membership was seven guineas, meals (including wine) 30s and miniatures a hefty 12/6d.” You fear you’re never going to hear anything of “Sunny Afternoon” ever again. Or indeed, ever see a sunny afternoon again.\n\nIf this was just an occasional slip it might be overlooked, but it is a constant fault, and all those early Kinks hits cry out to be looked at again. Songs you’re sure you know inside out are often far odder than their “iconic” reputation suggests. It’s very difficult to say what songs such as “Days”, “See My Friend” and “Waterloo Sunset” are actually “about”. What you take to be their predominant mood is often contradicted by half-forgotten lines buried in the mix. In “Days” it’s the not-entirely-convincing “Now I’m not frightened of this world, believe me”. Or the half-intuited feeling that “Waterloo Sunset” may actually be about someone deciding not to take their own life – for now. Or the nature of that strange river (Styx?) being crossed in “See My Friend”. At times Rogan gives the impression of hurrying through the inconvenience of discussing the music at all to get back to the real meat of things – someone new popping up to verify that Ray was indeed an awful, awful man.\n\nA previous Rogan biography I read, Van Morrison: No Surrender, had exactly the same flaws: awesome musical works are ticked off in a few uninspired lines so Rogan can return to the main business of tutting loudly at Morrison’s grumpiness and bad manners. You get no idea of Rogan’s own motivation, of why he would devote so much time and space to something he doesn’t seem wholly engaged with. (It almost reads like a form of authorial revenge: “Having spent years of my life on this book and ended up hating you, I’m going to make sure the reader does too.”) Rogan sucks all the joy and strangeness and unpredictability out of the music. We also get no sense whatsoever of what Davies’s own cultural life is – no sense of what music he listens to, what books he reads, what films have blown him away. Alongside a rather dreary list of people who popped up recently to cover Davies on the “tribute” album See My Friends (Metallica? Paloma Faith? God help us), we get stray hints of his taste for less predictable musical entities such as Yo La Tengo and Charles Mingus. You long for Rogan to pick up on such unexpected clues and check them out further, but – nothing.\n\nI struggled through to the bitter end, but there was no big pay-off, no real sense of what makes either brother tick. Just – oh, here we go again – Dave calling Ray a “cunt” one more time. It all reminded me of that big government inquiry into Harold Shipman that took £20m and 270,000 pages to conclude that he may have had a “personality disorder”. No! Stick to the music – it remains more thought-provoking all by itself."
