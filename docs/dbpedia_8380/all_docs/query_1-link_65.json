        "text": "For long-serving rock stars, touring is often tied into an anniversary, and Ray Davies has two big ones in 2014. It's 50 years since the Kinks' first album and, in June, and it's his 70th birthday. On top of that, he's being inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame and there are mutterings of a possible Kinks reunion. It would have been rude not to do a few gigs with so much going on.\n\nHe's doing them quirkily: half the set is Kinks classics, performed acoustically with guitarist Bill Shanley, and the rest – call it a legend's prerogative – celebrates his passion for America. Last year, he wrote an autobiographical travelogue called Americana, and composed songs for it, and tonight we hear both. He reads from the book, which is funny and eloquent, and he sings the tunes, which are less so. And there's more: sandwiched between readings and music is a short film he shot during a 2001 US tour. Later, there's separate footage from a New Orleans hospital, where he was taken after being shot during a 2004 street robbery.\n\nIt's the ultimate gig of two halves. On the one hand, there's Waterloo Sunset, Sunny Afternoon, Autumn Almanac and the other 60s hits, tenderly rendered and undimmed. But Davies is self-deprecating, even dismissive, of his enshrinement as the bard of English pop. \"I'm associated with Englishness,\" is all he says about it – though he seems tickled that the Englisher-than-English track Village Green \"was briefly taken up by the [anti-]fracking movement\".\n\nThus, the rest of the show looks toward the country that captivated him while growing up in post-war London. The 2001 film documents a coast-to-coast tour, with the monotony of soundchecks and overnight drives included. Davies's uncondescending interest in everything he sees makes it watchable – but there's rather a lot of it, and the accompanying songs are written more for himself than for an audience. One is a hymn to his security guard, suggesting he's come a long way from Muswell Hill.\n\nThe New Orleans segment is a touristy collage of voodoo shops and marching bands, until the moment we see him in a hospital bed, recovering from being shot in the leg. The incident has given him a fund of jokes – tonight's punky finale is called You Really Shot Me – and perhaps a renewed zest for life. Davies is an exceptionally young 69: engaged, engaging, still singular."
