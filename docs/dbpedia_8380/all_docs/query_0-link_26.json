        "text": "Dave Davies is trying to get an important trophy he once had after it vanished and recently showed up for sale online ... but might have to give up another prized possession to do it.\n\nThe Kinks rocker hopped on X this week to lament the fact that his 1990 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame award -- a statue with his name on it -- surfaced on eBay ... with the seller of this rare collector's item claiming it fell into their lap, with them trying to hawk it for over $12k.\n\nTMZ.com\n\nNow, Davies is giving us more insight into what happened here ... and more importantly, how he plans to get the HOF trophy back. He tells TMZ the award went missing back in the day after he suffered a stroke … and he's gobsmacked to see it all these years later.\n\nThe listing was pulled as soon as DD took to social media to decry the situation ... and Dave says he finally connected with the seller -- but now, Davies is in a haggling situation.\n\nHe tells us he isn't accusing the current seller of any wrongdoing … it seems the person came into possession of the award years ago from what they assumed was a legitimate deal ... but Dave says there’s no way he’s shelling out dough for his own property.\n\nThe rocker says he hopes to have the situation resolved before the weekend … and tells us he is offering some pretty sweet memorabilia to the seller -- including even a guitar -- in exchange for the award back. In his view, the seller shouldn't be left empty-handed.\n\nAs for strong-arming ... DD has no interest in getting eBay or law enforcement involved in the situation, which he believes will end amicably. He just wants his sweet trophy back"
