        "text": "The way Dave Davies tells it, the most important moment in his life came in August 1972. After 10 years of success as guitarist for the band he co-founded, The Kinks, life had caught up with him: the drink, the drugs, the depression, the paranoia.\n\nIn a hotel room in New York, Davies had a nervous breakdown. He seriously considered jumping out of the window. “It was horrible just revisiting it,” Davies tells me of writing about the incident in his new memoir, Living on a Thin Line.\n\nHe was interrupted by a knock on the door. It was an old girlfriend. He took this as a sign, leading to a spiritual rebirth: he kicked the substances, became a vegetarian and found solace in the psychic world.\n\n“The occult,” he tells me. “And especially mysticism.” Did anyone take him seriously? “No,” he laughs. “No, definitely not at the time. They called it madness, but it isn’t madness. It’s learning to understand existences other than just what we see day to day.”\n\nDavies brings most questions back to his interest in the cryptic. This shift from self-destruction to inner peace is the principal arc of Living on a Thin Line (an updated version of 1997’s Kink) – more so than music or his lifelong sibling rivalry with brother Ray, The Kinks’ genius songwriter.\n\nHe and his brother had an infamously volatile relationship – think the original Gallagher brothers – but the tensions, both personal and artistic, propelled The Kinks to become one of the UK’s greatest groups, with three number one hits and 14 top 10 singles.\n\nEarly beat group-influenced hits like “You Really Got Me” gave way to Ray Davies’ mock-nostalgic social commentary on the lives of English suburbanites – see melodic masterpieces such as “Waterloo Sunset”, “Sunny Afternoon”, “The Village Green Preservation Society” and “Where Did All The Good Times Go” – that set a new standard in pop lyricism. The Kinks’ influence on British music echoes down the decades, from The Jam to Madness, Blur to Arctic Monkeys.\n\nThe book, meanwhile, plays like a postcard from the past. Largely set in an antiquated working-class London during the carefree swinging 60s, it’s a warts and all account of Davies’ life. It starts with his recovery from a stroke in 2004 that meant he had to relearn how to play the guitar, before picking up with his childhood in Muswell Hill through to his life with The Kinks.\n\n“There will never be a time or era like the 60s,” Davies says, “because of the social and artistic upheaval. It was an amazing time when you could do anything, say anything, dress any way you wanted”.\n\nDavies has the receipts. The Kinks’ success allowed him to indulge in some shocking rock star behaviour. The book reveals run ins with, among others, John Lennon (“I was a trappy kid who thought he knew it all and so was he”), and drunken fights with police, security men, even his own band – The Kinks drummer Mick Avory nearly decapitated Davies in 1965 by throwing a hi-hat at him onstage in Cardiff after Davies goaded him as useless during the concert. “At the time I didn’t like him very much,” he tells me when I mention that.\n\n‘I regret everything I did wrong. But I’m glad I did it. I’d say we all have things that we will regret. My mum would say: ‘Now you move on. Let’s hope you f***ing learned something!’”\n\nDave Davies\n\nThe book also recalls a procession of groupies – he says he had a “rapacious desire” for women – and that old trope, smashing up hotels. In one graphic scene, he leaves a poo in a bathroom sink after he was refused permission to take women back to his room. In the cold light of day, he is at least remorseful about it all.\n\n“I still don’t know why I did that,” he says. “I guess I wanted to leave a statement, that I hated the way I felt. It was really an accumulation of a lot of negative feelings. It was a real proper turd as well, know what I mean?”\n\nDavies was born on 3 February 1947 in Fortis Green, just outside Muswell Hill in north London. He was the youngest of eight – six sisters and Ray, who he describes as a kid who was “sensitive and smart, ahead of his time, especially creatively”. His father was a slaughterman, his mother a café worker: it was a musical household, where large family knees ups were common.\n\nTwo episodes from his youth alerted his life. His older sister Rene died aged 30, which shattered the family. “Psychologically, you age very quickly in a short space of time. I was probably 40 when I was 16.”\n\nAround the same time, Davies started a relationship with Susan Sheehan: they were expelled for bunking off school to have sex on Hampstead Heath. When Susan became pregnant, their respective parents concocted a plan to keep the young lovers estranged.\n\nDavies wouldn’t see Susan, or his daughter Tracey, until a chance meeting 30 years later. Her presence ghosts in and out of the book, Davies full of anger, confusion and guilt.\n\n“In the beginning especially,” says now. “It’s still upsetting; it still gnaws at me sometimes. But I have a good relationship with them now. I wouldn’t change that for the world.”\n\nI wonder if his behaviour might have been better had they stayed together? “Who knows,” he says. The truth is, probably not. The book reveals a tendency to cheat on and then leave his partners at will (his first wife Lisbet got a particularly rough deal).\n\nDoes he regret the way he treated the women in his life? “I regret everything I did wrong,” he says. “But I’m glad I did it. I’d say we all have things that we will regret. My mum would say” – he adopts an exaggerated Cockney accent – “‘Now you move on. Let’s hope you f***ing learned something!’”\n\nSo what did he learn? There’s a pause. “Probably not much… I like to think compassion and understanding for other people’s feelings and not to rampage through your own emotions. Everybody’s important.”\n\nIt’s in stark contrast to the way he remembers his relationship with men. He admits to ending relationships with lovers – notably with TV presenter Michael Aldred – because he was sensitive to the fact his bisexuality was incompatible with their needs.\n\n“Me and Ray grew up with a heavy matriarchal kind of influence. Women teach you about your emotions rather than all guys hanging out. I learned that men have feelings too. We’re not just cannon fodder built for war.”\n\nHis tempestuous, difficult relationship with Ray is picked at like an open wound.\n\n“I’m probably Ray’s biggest fan,” Davies says to me. “But he’s also been a real arsehole.” Throughout the book, Davies describes Ray as uncommunicative, narcissistic, egotistical, self-obsessed, patronising; he is often dismayed that his own contribution to The Kinks’ music is downplayed or dismissed, despite his ground-breaking guitar playing being crucial to The Kinks’ sound. To get the distorted, scuzzy riff on their breakthrough number one hit “You Really Got Me”, Davies slashed an amp with a razor blade (Jimi Hendrix was so impressed, he once asked him how he did it).\n\nI ask about his past relationship with Ray. “Some of the most difficult experiences are the best for you. Astrology taught me a lot about interacting with people. It leads you towards understanding differences.”\n\nDoes he understand Ray now? “No,” he says laughing. “I probably understand him more than I did though.”\n\nHe often gives the impression in the book that he thought Ray didn’t understand, or even care about him. “Yeah, that’s true. But sometimes our greatest teachers are the worst people. Maybe [our relationship] wasn’t meant to be all love and light. Although I would have loved for it to be all love and light, believe me.”\n\nReading the book, I couldn’t decide whether being in a band together was the worst thing for their relationship, or the best. He takes a moment to think. “On the balance, I think it was the best thing. Out of conflict can come resolution. It’s all about working stuff out.” At present, his relationship with Ray is on an even keel. “We get along good. We talk, mainly about football and art. We get on OK.”\n\nHe says The Kinks’ music has endured “because it’s real. It’s about a family and real life. It’s also about the future, our dreams. I hope we’ve got a long way to go.”\n\nDoes that mean new Kinks stuff is on the horizon? “Well, Ray and I have spoken over the last year and are trying to put some stuff together. I don’t know how it’s gonna turn out but I’m optimistic there’s something there.”\n\nNew songs? “Yeah, songs.” Gigs? “Yeah, it’s not out of the question. I’m very excited about my own writing too. There’s a lot ahead for me and the Kinks.” He smiles. “Maybe the best is yet to come.”"
