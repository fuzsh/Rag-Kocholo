        "text": "Most people want to talk to Dave Davies about the past. But the Kinks guitarist is just as much about the present these days.\n\nThough he’s surrounded by talk of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group’s 50th anniversary – including a slew of archival releases – Davies has released a new solo album, ‘Rippin’ Up Time.’ It certainly has the flavor of the Kinks and even makes reference to the group’s first hit, ‘You Really Got Me,’ in one of its songs, and Davies acknowledges that while the songs are new they were also inspired by an almost metaphysical relationship with the past.\n\n‘I had some ideas about time and where we are at this point in history and what’s going to happen in the future,’ explains Davies, 67, who suffered a stroke in 2004 but has made a complete recovery. ‘That made me think about this year and the 50th anniversary of ‘You Really Got Me.’ It’s all kind of like a dream; a quick look at the past and confront it with the present with all its confusion and chaos and then thinking about what’s going to happen in 50 years’ time.\n\n‘And then I got the idea about ‘ripping up time’ and actually had a dream involving all these elements, all these times in all the same places, and I woke up shouting, ‘There is madness here! There is madness!’ So I thought that was a great idea for a song, and the rest (of the album) kind of grew out of that one song.’\n\nThe 50th anniversary, of course, has been accompanied by calls for and rumors about a possible Kinks reunion between Davies, his older brother Ray Davies and drummer Mick Avory. Two different labels have released Kinks anthologies along with an expanded edition of 1971’s landmark ‘Muswell Hillbillies.’ Any new Kinks activity seems to be on hold at the moment, though Davies isn’t giving up hope.\n\n‘I spoke to Ray a while back about maybe doing something and I kept waiting and waiting and we couldn’t really arrive at anything,’ Davies recalls. ‘I remember that first meeting last year, about November, Ray and I got on really well for about four days and then it all went crazy. There’s an awful lot of pressure for us to do something.\n\n‘So we’ll see. I’m not sure what’s going to happen yet. We still need to iron out a few things; a few personal things need to be sorted out, as well. So maybe it’ll be next year. Maybe it’s better to have a 51st anniversary rather than a 50th, y’know? But it would be a shame if Ray and I don’t do something.’"
