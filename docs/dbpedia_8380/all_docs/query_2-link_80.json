        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – Michelangelo was in the crowd for Thursday night’s sold-out Dave Davies show at the Music Box. Or at least his spirit was.\n\n“The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.”\n\nThe sculptor’s famous quote was about his “David,” but it might have been just Davies. And in a wonderful sort of way, it’s like carving out a time line that’s been folded over on itself.\n\nThe Dave Davies who so joyously took the stage Thursday night is, but is not, the Dave Davies who captivated the world a half-century ago as a member of the Kinks, along with his brother, Ray. He is, but is not, the guy who essentially created the distorted guitar riff when he pounded out the F and G barre chords in 1964 on “You Really Got Me.”\n\nAll we need to do is chisel away the superfluous material – the 55 years between then and now, and the aftereffects of a paralyzing stroke he had in 2004 – and it’s clearly evident that they are the same David, as much a work of art as any created by Michelangelo.\n\nI confess I have never been prouder of Cleveland music fans, too. They saw the same thing I did as Davies rumbled through 15 songs – two-thirds of them Kinks tunes: a Rock & Roll Hall of Famer who changed music with his guitar and a living page out of a history book. No matter that the hair is sparser and grayer, that the voice is thinner and wavier, that the fingers on the frets are slower and less nimble.\n\nThis was THE Dave Davies, the original Dave Davies, and to a person, the crowd clamored to make sure he knew how much he is appreciated.\n\nWhat’s more, it was clear that Davies appreciated us, too. I’ve seen artists have fun onstage, or at least appear to have fun. But in this case, it was even better because it seemed to remind me of a rock ‘n’ roll Tinkerbell moment: Every pair of clapping hands brought him more and more to life.\n\nNow don’t get me completely wrong. The music was exceptionally good, and it’s amazing to see it played by one of the men who created it. Having Smithereens drummer Dennis Diken on the kit and backup vocals added to it, too. His solid timekeeping and fills that perfectly recreated (and maybe improved on) those of original Kinks drummer Mick Avory kept everything going.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that Ray Davies was the lead singer of the Kinks. So, Dave Davies had – and usually still has – an expressive voice, and the sibling similarities are there, it’s not Ray on vocals. Dave’s voice, though, has a “lived-in” quality that actually adds to the songs, like a pressed flower in a diary.\n\nAll of that was just fine, because at different points of the night, that superfluous pieces of that block fell away and the marble statue was plainly visible. That happened on the Kinks’ tunes “See My Friends,’’ “Strangers,” “I’m Not Like Everybody Else” and “Tired of Waiting for You,” as well as “Creepin’ Jean,” “Death of a Clown,” “Too Much on My Mind,’’ all from his post-Kinks career.\n\nWhat really stood out was “Cradle to the Grave,’’ a “new” song from his latest album, “Decade.” The album features tunes he wrote and recorded in the 1970s that were discovered by his sons, then remixed, remastered and released last year.\n\nOf course, the big hits got everyone going – it’s what we came to see, after all. “All Day and All of the Night’’ and especially “You Really Got Me” (with those chunked-out F-G, F-G barre chords!) really took the chisel to that ol’ block of marble, and all we were left with were things of beauty."
