        "text": "The Kinks guitarist Dave Davies has once again refuted claims of Jimmy Page’s involvement in the band’s 1964 hit song You Really Got Me.\n\nThe long-standing debate of Page’s involvement on the track was recently revived after Guitar World published an interview with seasoned producer Eddie Kramer. In it, Kramer was quoted as saying: “I met Jimmy while he was working with the Kinks in the early ‘60s when they were doing You Really Got Me. I know the Davies brothers will say otherwise, but I recall seeing Jimmy coming in and doing an overdub on that song. There’s some contention about that, but that’s how I remember it.”\n\nREAD MORE: KK Downing: “The guitar dynamic in Judas Priest was lopsided – but in KK’s Priest it’s the way I always envisaged it”\n\nArguing that Kramer was “misquoted”, Davies wrote on X: “I demand an immediate retraction from Guitar World and Guitar. I spoke to Eddie Kramer yesterday, and he denies ever saying that Jimmy Page played on the Kinks’ You Really Got Me. I played all the guitar parts on YRGM; Ed Kramer told me yesterday he was misquoted.”\n\n“I’m so tired of reporters getting it wrong,” he added.\n\nThe guitarist then followed up with a text message he received from Kramer, with the latter saying: “My memories of the sessions I was on as a tape operator in the early ’60s for the Kinks are of me standing next to your amp when you hit a big chord and I jumped about a foot off the ground as I had never heard such a loud amp in my life up until then!”\n\nBack in 2014, Page too denied his involvement in You Really Got Me, calling the misunderstanding the “result of internet meddling and muddling” [via Rolling Stone].\n\n“Yes, I was on The Who’s I Can’t Explain. I wasn’t on You Really Got Me, but I did play on the Kinks’ records. That’s all I’m going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about You Really Got Me. So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won’t keep asking me.”"
