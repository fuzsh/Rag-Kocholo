        "text": "Hope your week is off to a good start. This is the second of two parts of this month’s installment of my recurring feature about music producers and sound engineers, which highlights Eddie Kramer. As I noted yesterday in Part I, his extensive credits include both record engineering and production. This part focuses on some of Kramer’s work as a producer.\n\nPrior to getting into music production, Kramer had established himself as a sound engineer, having worked with the likes of The Kinks, The Beatles, Traffic, The Rolling Stones and Jimi Hendrix. Given this, it’s not surprising that for many albums Kramer produced he also handled engineering and mixing.\n\nHis first production work was the second eponymous studio album by Johnny Winter. Released in April 1969, the album lists Winter as producer and Kramer as production consultant. Engineering credits go to Charlie Bragg, Ed Hudson and Neil Wilburn. Here’s the sizzling I’m Yours & I’m Hers, one of Winter’s originals.\n\nAnother early example of Kramer’s production work is somewhat surprising: Carly Simon’s eponymous debut album, which appeared in February 1971. The head of Simon’s label Electra, Jac Holzman, had suggested Kramer as the producer. While apparently there was some tension between Simon and him, the album yielded her first top 10 hit, That’s the Way I’ve Always Heard It Should Be, and won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1972. Here’s the aforementioned song, co-written by Simon and Jacob Brackman. In addition to producing, Kramer also worked on engineering and mixing, together with David Palmer.\n\nAmong Kramer’s most significant production work was his collaboration with Kiss. It started in 1975 with the multi-Platinum live double LP album Alive! and included five additional Platinum albums. Alive! also generated the group’s first hit single, Rock and Roll All Nite. Co-written by Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Gene Simmons (lead vocals, bass), the song initially had appeared on Kiss’s third studio album Dressed to Kill but stalled at no. 68 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 when released in April 1975. By comparison, the live version, which I’ve always preferred, climbed to no. 12. It also did well in Canada (no. 13) and Australia (no. 18). Once again, Kramer also handled engineering and mixing.\n\n“The thing with Kiss was we knew we had to get everything down on tape no matter what it took,” Kramer recalled in a recent interview with Guitar World. “It was hard because they were always jumping around, and we had to do a bunch of work on the album after the fact, but that’s how it was. The band may deny it, but the fact remains that on Alive!, we had to fix a bunch of stuff.” He went on: “There were just bits we had to fix for obvious reasons, like the guys being on stage in six-inch boots, bombs going off and rockets and flames shooting to God knows where. [Laughs] It takes a lot of work to keep in time and tune while jumping up and down. They can do it now, but in those days, not so much.”\n\nThe final production example I’d like to highlight takes us to October 1988 and the eponymous debut album by Australian hard rock band Kings of the Sun. They were formed in 1986 in Sydney by Clifford Hoad (vocals, drums, percussion) and his brother Jeffrey Hoad (vocals, guitar), together with Anthony Ragg (bass) and Ron Thiessen (guitar). Kings of the Sun was the first of three albums the group released until they disbanded in 2001. In 2010, Clifford revived the band as Clifford Hoad’s Kings of the Sun. Their current status is unclear. Here’s Serpentine. In addition to production, Kramer handled engineering. Mixing is credited to Dave Thoener.\n\nBefore wrapping up with a Spotify playlist of the above and additional production examples, I’d like to give Kramer the final word. “Music has been such a big part of my life and still stimulates me,” he said during the above interview with Guitar World. “When I walk into a studio, I still get chills. There’s something about a bunch of musicians – or even one musician – getting in a room and striking that first chord. And when that happens, it all comes back, and I say, ‘Ah, yes, I know what to do with that.’”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Guitar World; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Monday and welcome to another installment of my recurring feature about music producers and sound engineers. This time, I’m taking a look at Eddie Kramer who until I did some research I wrongly had assumed primarily is a sound engineer. While he gained initial prominence in that capacity, especially because of his work with Jimi Hendrix, Kramer also produced for the likes of Carly Simon, Kiss, Peter Frampton and Buddy Guy.\n\nGiven his enormous output, I decided to break up this installment in two parts. Part I will focus on Kramer’s work as a sound engineer, while Part II will highlight some of his credits as a producer. For many albums he produced he also did engineering and mixing.\n\nKramer was born Edwin H. Kramer on April 19, 1942 in Cape Town, South Africa. His parents were into the arts and music. Already as a 4-year-old, Kramer picked up the piano and also tried the violin and cello. During his classical piano studies at South African College of Music in Cape Town, he became interested in jazz and rock.\n\nIn 1961 at the age of 19, Kramer moved to London, England, following his parents who had relocated there four months earlier due to their political opposition to South Africa’s despicable apartheid. In London, Kramer began recording local jazz groups in a simple home studio as a hobby. He got his first professional job at Advision Studios in 1962, which at the time provided voiceovers and jingles for television ads.\n\nIn 1963, Kramer joined Pye Studios where he assisted in recordings of classical works, as well as rock and pop music, including The Kinks, The Searchers, The Undertakers, Petula Clark and Sammy Davis Jr. The following year, Kramer founded KPS Studios and gained a reputation, despite its rudimentary two-track recording capability. Regent Sound where The Rolling Stones recorded their first album took notice and acquired Kramer’s studio in 1965.\n\nRegent Sound put him in charge to help build and run their new four-track studio where The Beatles subsequently recorded Fixing a Hole. In 1966, Kramer joined Olympic Sound Studios and engineered albums for The Rolling Stones, Small Faces, Traffic and Jimi Hendrix. In 1968, he relocated to New York, so he could continue his close collaboration with Hendrix.\n\nIn mid-1969, Kramer was hired to record the Woodstock Festival for both the album and the movie, an arduous project that further raised his profile. “All of us in the crew had to have Vitamin B shots in the bum so that we would be able to stay up for three days,” he recalled. “The whole thing was recorded under the most primitive of conditions but we got it done. Woodstock was 3 days of drugs and hell.”\n\nAfter Woodstock, Kramer oversaw the creation of Hendrix’s state-of-the-art studio, Electric Lady Studios in New York City’s Greenwich Village, together with architect John Storyk. Upon completion in 1970, he was the studio’s Director of Engineering until his departure in 1975. Kramer worked independently thereafter both as a producer and a sound engineer.\n\nIn 2005, Kramer teamed up with Storyk again to design another studio: Anacapa Studios in Malibu, California. Since the early 2000s, he also began exhibiting his photographs he had taken of artists he worked with between 1967-1972, including Hendrix, the Stones, Led Zeppelin and Santana, among others.\n\nAdditional side projects have included co-authoring a book about Hendrix, a two-part video series, Adventures in Modern Recording, and collaborations with Digitech to design and create effects pedals emulating guitar sounds of Hendrix and Brian May. In April, Kramer turned 82 and apparently is still active. Wikipedia notes he’s working with Digital Theatre Systems (DTS) to develop an app that replicates 5.1, 7.1 and 11.1 Surround Sound in any type of headphone.\n\nTime to take a closer look at some of Kramer’s sound engineering work. I will also include a Spotify playlist at the end of the post to capture these and other examples.\n\nLet’s start with Jimi Hendrix. Here’s Little Wing, written by Hendrix and recorded by the Jimi Hendrix Experience for their second studio album Axis: Bold as Love, released in December 1967. “It’s still one of the most emotional things I have ever heard,” Kramer told Guitar World in March this year. “I could go on and on; all his stuff is bloody marvelous. But I guess some are more marvelous than others.”\n\nPrompted by the work Kramer had done with producer Jimmy Miller on Traffic’s first two albums Mr. Fantasy (December 1967) and Traffic (October 1968), The Rolling Stones booked the two for their December 1968 studio album Beggars Banquet. “He went to the heart and soul of where they came from; he was so adept at evoking the psyche of the band, and so clever at production,” said Kramer about Miller. “I’ve always tried to model myself after Jimmy in terms of how to get a session going, how to make the artists really get excited about what they’re playing.” Here’s Street Fighting Man.\n\nLet’s turn to Led Zeppelin next. Kramer did engineering and mixing on various albums, including Led Zeppelin II (October 1969), Houses of the Holy (March 1973), Physical Graffiti (February 1975) and Coda (November 1982), the live soundtrack album The Song Remains the Same (October 1976), as well as the live album How the West Was Won (May 2003). Here’s Over the Hills and Far Away from Houses of the Holy.\n\nThe last engineering example I’d like to call out is Peter Frampton’s iconic Frampton Comes Alive! double live album, which came out in January 1976. Let’s listen to Doobie Wah.\n\nLast but not least, here’s a above-mentioned Spotify playlist. Stay tuned for Part II tomorrow, which will highlight some of Kramer’s work as a producer.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Guitar World; History of Recording; BBC Radio 6; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Sunday, and once again, I’d like to welcome you to another music time travel excursion. As always, the itinerary takes us to six different decades, featuring six tracks in different flavors. Hope you’ll join me for the ride!\n\nThe Ben Webster Quintet/Makin’ Whoopee\n\nToday our trip starts in 1957 with jazz tenor saxophonist Ben Webster. Over a 40-year-plus career, which was cut short by his death from a stroke in 1973 at age 64, Webster played and recorded with the likes of Duke Ellington, Johnny Hodges and Billie Holiday. Starting from 1957, a steady series of albums appeared under his leadership or co-leadership. This brings us to Soulville, an album he recorded in October 1957 together with the Oscar Peterson Trio and drummer Stan Levey. It was released the same year, billed as The Ben Webster Quintet – smooth, unlike Webster’s temper that reportedly was volatile.\n\nBuffalo Tom/Taillights Fade\n\nThe next stop takes us to March 1992 and Let Me Come Over, the third studio album by Buffalo Tom – shoutout to Tony from Mumbling About..., who recently covered the alternative rock band and told me he’s been recommending them to people for a long time. I was sold immediately after listening to a few songs. Formed in Boston in 1986 by Bill Janovitz (vocals, guitar, piano), Chris Colbourn (bass, guitar vocals) and Tom Maginnis (drums, percussion), Buffalo Tom have released 10 studio albums to date, most recently Jump Rope on May 31. From their above third album, here’s Taillights Fade – love that melodic, jangly sound!\n\nMuddy Magnolias/Why Don’t You Stay\n\nMuddy Magnolias was a short-lived duo formed in 2014 by Jessy Wilson, an African American singer-songwriter from Brooklyn, New York; and Kallie North, a white pianist from Beaumont, TX. Wilson’s influences include Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, Lauren Hill, Mary J. Blige and The Notorious B.I.G., while North grew up listening to artists like Carpenters, Alison Krauss, James Taylor and Eagles. In October 2016, they released their only album, Broken People, which blended blues, country, folk, rock, R&B and soul. After North left in 2017, Wilson resumed her solo career. Let’s listen to the amazing Why Don’t You Stay.\n\nThe Kingsmen/Louie Louie\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’60s with a classic, as far as I’m concerned: Louie Louie by The Kingsmen. Their version of the song by Richard Berry, who first released it in 1957 as Richard Berry and the Pharaohs, became their second and biggest hit single released in April 1963. It was also included on their first album The Kingsmen In Person, which came out in December of the same year. Louie Louie has also been covered by Rockin’ Robin Roberts and the Wailers (1961), Paul Revere & the Raiders (1963), The Beach Boys (1964), Otis Redding (1964), The Kinks (1964) and many others.\n\nGuns N’ Roses/Sweet Child o’ Mine\n\nLet’s next head to July 1987 and the epic Sweet Child o’ Mine by Guns N’ Roses. The hard rock band from Los Angeles was formed in 1985 by members of two local glam metal bands, Hollywood Rose and L.A. Guns. By the time Guns N’ Roses recorded their debut album Appetite for Destruction, their classic line-up was in place: Axl Rose (lead vocals), Slash (guitar, backing vocals), Izzy Stradlin (guitar, backing vocals), Duff McKagan (bass, backing vocals) and Steven Adler (drums). Sweet Child o’ Mine, credited to the entire band, also appeared separately as the album’s third single in June 1988 and became the group’s only song to top the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nYes/Siberian Khatru\n\nOnce again we’re reaching our sixth and final stop. Today we wrap up our little music excursion in September 1972, which saw the release of Close to the Edge, the fifth studio album by British progressive rock group Yes – one of the few bands of the genre I’ve warmed up to over time. It was the last album to feature the band’s original drummer Bill Bruford, who would join King Crimson once the recording had finished. The other members included co-founders Jon Anderson (lead vocals) and Chris Squire (bass, backing vocals), along with Steve Howe (guitar, backing vocals) and Rick Wakeman (piano, organ, synthesizer, Mellotron) – arguably, the group’s best line-up. Here’s Siberian Khatru, co-written by Anderson, Howe and Wakeman. Yep, it’s long but, hey, it’s prog rock! 🙂\n\nLast but not least, here’s a Spotify playlist of the above goodies. Hope there’s something you like. So long!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Acclaimed Music; YouTube; Spotify\n\nAfter two months since the most recent post, I thought this would be a good time for another installment of this irregular feature, in which I republish select content from the earlier days of the blog. This post from August 2018 was part of a series I called The Hardware that focused on prominent instruments in rock. Realizing this is a somewhat inside baseball topic for many readers and that I’m not exactly a music gear technician, these posts did not go too deeply into the technical aspects. To make the content more entertaining, they also featured music clips showing the gear I was highlighting.\n\nThe Hardware: Vox Continental\n\nCompact keyboard with characteristic sound became hit among touring bands in ’60s\n\nWhen I listened to Light My Fire by The Doors the other day, I was reminded of Ray Manzarek’s distinct keyboard on that tune, a sound I’ve always loved. It also came to me that I hadn’t done a post on important music hardware in a long time – two good reasons to write about the Vox Continental, a handy and cool-looking organ that became popular in the ’60s and can be heard on many songs released during that decade and thereafter.\n\nFor those who are visiting my blog for the first time or haven’t seen one of my previous hardware posts, I’d like to reiterate that I’m not an engineering guy; in fact, having two left hands, it’s more of the opposite! As such, one could say there’s a certain degree of irony that I write about the subject. But while I’m not exactly a techie and therefore don’t go deeply into the technical aspects, music gear can still excite me like a little child, primarily from a sound and visual perspective. With that disclaimer out of the way, let’s get to it.\n\nPrior to the Vox Continental’s introduction in England in 1962, the Vox brand name had been synonymous with guitar amplifiers, especially the Vox AC30 used by The Shadows, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks and other ’60s bands. However, as its name already indicates, the company that made the amps, The Jennings Organ Company founded by Thomas Walter Jennings in Kent, England after the Second World War and renamed Jennings Musical Industries (JMI) in 1957, started out as a manufacturer of home and church organs. Their first successful product was the Univox, an electronic keyboard similar to the Clavioline.\n\nThe Vox Continental is a so-called combo keyboard. Does it come with French fries and a Coke you might ask? Well, not quite. Combo actually is another (British) term for band. Okay, it’s a keyboard for a band, but so is a Hammond or a regular piano, so what’s the big deal? While pianos were frequently used in the recording studio, amplifying their sound during live performances was tricky. Hammond organs like the mighty B3 certainly could meet volume requirements, but they were pretty clunky. A compact combo keyboard like the Vox Continental offered a great solution. It also looked pretty cool!\n\nThe Vox Continental was made possible by the invention of transistors that were less heavy and smaller than the electron tubes used in big electronic organs. The handy keyboard came in two basic variations, a single manual and a dual manual. One of the Continental’s distinct visual features is its reversed colored keys: what on a regular keyboard are the white keys are black, while the traditionally black keys are white (see image on top of the post). The top part covering the electronics with its orange or grey finish stands out as well. The curving and removable chrome stand is another distinct feature. Without a bass section, no bass pedals, no percussion, no sustain and only a single-speed vibrato, the Vox Continental was fairly archaic. Yet because of its sound and the aforementioned design features, the instrument became very popular.\n\nInitially, Vox Continental keyboards were made at two plants in Kent: JMI’s facility in Dartford and the Vox Sound plant in Erith. In 1964, Jennings signed a licensing deal with the Thomas Organ Company in the U.S. JMI and Thomas subsequently also formed EME (Elletronica Musicale Europea), a joint venture with Italian guitar and keyboard manufacturer EKO. With the advent of the Moog and other more elaborate keyboards by the early ’70s, the appeal of Vox Continental organs started to decrease, and production was phased out. While it continued to have a significant following and remains sought-after, it took until September 2017 that Vox revived the Continental with an updated version. Since 1992, the company has been owned by Japanese electronics corporation Korg.\n\nAs noted at the outset, the Vox Continental is featured in many songs released during the ’60s and thereafter. This post wouldn’t be complete without some examples.\n\nThe House Of The Rising Sun (The Animals)\n\nThe version of the traditional by The Animals featuring Alan Price on keys is one of the most compelling showcases of the Vox Continental, in my humble opinion as somebody who isn’t a keyboard player. Sure, the sound isn’t as fat and growling as the Hammond B3; in fact, it’s rather thin by comparison, and yet it still sounds awesome at least to my ears!\n\nBecause (The Dave Clark Five)\n\nWritten by Dave Clark, Because was recorded for the band’s third U.S. studio album American Tour from August 1964. The song also appeared as a single and became the band’s second most successful hit in the U.S., peaking at no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Here’s a nice clip of an appearance on American music variety TV program Shindig! from 1965. While it is much less dominant than in The House Of The Rising Sun, one can nicely see Mike Smith playing the organ.\n\nI’m A Believer (The Monkees)\n\nI’m A Believer appeared on More Of The Monkees, the band’s second studio album released in January 1967, and as the record’s lead single in November the previous year. Written by Neil Diamond, the song became the band’s most successful hit, topping the charts in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia and Germany, among others. While Peter Tork had known how to play keyboards, the keyboarder on the studio recording was Stan Free. Initially formed a musical acting quartet for a TV series, all of The Monkees eventually learned how to play their instruments.\n\nLight My Fire (The Doors)\n\nCredited to all members of the band, Light My Fire was included on The Doors’ eponymous debut album issued in January 1967. It also became the record’s second single released in April that year. It was the first of their two no. 1 U.S. hits on the Billboard Hot 100. The tune is another great example where the Vox Continental is quite dominant.\n\nIn-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (Iron Butterfly)\n\nIn-A-Gadda-Da-Vida is the title track of Iron Butterfly’s second studio album from June 1968. It was written by the band’s lead vocalist and keyboarder Doug Ingle. Clocking at more than 17 minutes, the track makes up the record’s entire side B. Iron Butterfly also released a single version, which was shortened to just under three minutes. Here’s a clip of the track in its entire mighty.\n\nWatching The Detectives (Elvis Costello)\n\nAfter production of Vox Continental keyboards had seized, the combo organs remained popular, as previously noted. One of their champions was Steve Nieve, who among others became known as keyboarder in Elvis Costello’s backing band The Attractions. Here’s a clip of Watching The Detectives from Costello’s debut album My Aim Is True, released in July 1977. Written by Costello, the tune became his first hit, peaking at no. 15 on the U.K. Official Singles Chart.\n\nDon’t Do Me Like That (Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers)\n\nDon’t Do Me Like That, the last song I’d like to highlight in this post, is another post ’60s example featuring a Vox Continental, played by Benmont Tench in this case. It appears on Damn The Torpedoes, the third studio album by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from October 1979. In November that year, the song also came out as the record’s lead single. Written by Petty, it became the band’s first top 10 hit in the U.S., reaching no. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n– END –\n\nThis post was first published on August 16, 2018.\n\nSources: Wikipedia, Engineering And Technology History Wiki (ETHW), Combo Organ Heaven, YouTube\n\nHappy Hump Day and I hope this week has been kind to you thus far. Wednesday, of course, also means it’s time to take a closer look at another song I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. Continuing my ’60s theme, which btw had not been planned, today’s pick is one of my favorites by The Kinks: Dead End Street.\n\nWritten by Ray Davies, Dead End Street appeared as a non-album single in November 1966. That was about five months after Dandy, the second and final single off The Kinks’ fourth studio album Face to Face, and six months prior to Waterloo Sunset, the lead single from their follow-on Something Else by the Kinks. Check out this cool official video, which was posted back in March as part of the celebration of the band’s 60th anniversary.\n\nDead End Street peaked at no. 5 in the UK, marking the sixth top 5 song for The Kinks in their home country. Elsewhere, it did particularly well in New Zealand and The Netherlands (each no. 4), Germany (no. 5) and Ireland (no. 7). The reception in the U.S. was less enthusiastic (no. 73), likely a reflection of the group’s ban there, which had taken effect after their disastrous 1965 mid-year tour.\n\n“It was written very quickly and it was written for the winter,” said Ray Davies, according to Wikipedia. “It was that thing of living in England and having had a great summer and now the light was closing in and the mood just shifts. The music had that little jazz backbeat, but there were these dark edges. I thought I was writing a trad jazz vamp about hard times that were coming.”\n\nHe went on, “My father had lived through the depression and he had talked about it, so the song had that 20s/30s feel to it – those stomping chords, the march of destiny coming to grab you. It was a very visual backdrop to the song.” Here’s a cool live version of Dead End Street, captured in April 1984 at Grugahalle in Essen, Germany, apparently as part of German TV music program Rockpalast.\n\n“‘Dead End Street’ was the epitome, to me, of what the Kinks were all about,” said Dave Davies in his 1996 autobiography Kink, as cited by Wikipedia. “A song full of character, pathos, yet containing an underlying sense of hope. Reflecting a fondness for the past but at the same time expressing a determination and yearning for change. Anguished voices calling to a heartless world. A world where the plight of the ordinary person mattered little. It was interesting to note that more than ten years later, the Clash did a song called ‘London Calling’ that seemed to be inspired by ‘Dead End Street’.”\n\nWikipedia also notes, Like many other songs written by Davies, it is to some degree influenced by British Music Hall. The bass playing was partly inspired by the “twangy” sound of Duane Eddy’s guitar. Following are some additional insights from Songfacts:\n\nThis song is about the hopelessness of the British lower class, especially when unemployed. The title “Dead End Street,” which means a one way street, implies the difficulty for many of getting away from the desperate situation they find themselves in.\n\nRay Davies explained to Q magazine: “My whole feeling about the ’60s was that it’s not as great as everyone thinks it is. Carnaby Street, everybody looking happy, that was all a camouflage. That’s what Dead End Street was about.\n\nI wrote it around the time I had to buy a house and I was terrified. I never wanted to own anything because my dad had never owned property. He’d inherited from his dad that he had to rent all his life. So I still have inbuilt shame of owning anything. It’s guilt.”\n\nDave Davies claimed this was one of his two favorite songs written by his brother, Ray. The other one he mentioned was “Shangri-La.”\n\nThe band pulled a fast one on producer Shel Talmy, who wanted the song to have more of a pop beat. Ray Davies told interviewer Daniel Rachel (The Art of Noise: Conversations with Great Songwriters): “He finished the track and said, ‘That’s great,’ and went home. Then we pretended to leave but came back to the studio and re-recorded the song. We played it to him the next day and he said, ‘See what I mean, there’s nothing wrong with it.’ He thought we were playing him his version.”\n\nThis originally had a French horn arrangement played by a musician named Albert Hall, but it was replaced with a trombone to achieve the somber sound that Ray Davies wanted. “I wanted ‘Dead End Street’ to be a bit dour and a bit earthy and a bit working-class, and the trombone fitted beautifully,” he explained.\n\nAs for Albert Hall, his name stuck with Ray and inspired a lyric in the Face to Face track “Session Man”: “He never will forget at all the day he played at the Albert Hall.”\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Songfact; YouTube\n\nHappy Saturday! The new music front continues to be vibrant, and once again, I had to whittle down my picks to six. All appear on albums and one EP released yesterday (July 7).\n\n12 Rods/Twice\n\n12 Rods are an indie rock band from Minneapolis, Minn. After an initial 12-year run and three albums, the group disbanded in 2004. They regrouped in 2015 for a short-lived reunion, including a concert and a documentary. In September 2021, co-founder Ryan Olcott (lead vocals, guitar) announced plans for a new album, which is now out. If We Stayed Alive features Olcott with an all-new line-up: Lars Oslund (guitar), Efren Maldonado (keyboards), Adri Mehra (bass) and Alec Tonjes (drums). Here’s Twice, penned by Olcott and one of three singles that came out leading up to the album. I love this mellow sound!\n\nThe Far Outs/Miss Me?\n\nListening to Aussie garage rockers The Far Outs feels like taking a trip back to the ’60s – this is one cool-sounding group! From their Bandcamp page: The Far Outs began as a side project to Brisbane’s Grand Atlantic as an outlet for songs that didn’t quite fit the format but still desperately needed a place to party. With influences ranging from the likes of The Kinks, The Sonics and The Easybeats, the group quickly established a reputation for their 60’s influenced garage rock – featuring blistering riffs, catchy choruses and drums akimbo. Following their June 2021 debut single Last Night/Sorry, they have now released their eponymous debut album. Here’s the hard-charging Miss Me?, which has a cool Doors vibe – man, I just love this!\n\nLocal Natives/Paradise\n\nFor this next pick, I decided to dial down the intensity level with a soothing tune by Local Natives, an indie rock outfit from the Los Angeles area. They were formed in 2005 by three high school students – Taylor Rice (vocals, guitar), Kelcey Ayer (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and Ryan Hahn (guitar, backing vocals) – who subsequently were joined by Andy Hamm (bass) and Matt Frazier (drums). The line-up remains unchanged to this day, except for Hamm who in 2012 was replaced by Nik Ewing (bass, keyboards, vocals). Since their November 2009 UK-only debut Gorilla Manor, Local Natives have released four additional albums, including their latest, Time Will Wait For No One. Here’s Paradise, which first appeared as a single on June 27 – neat vocals!\n\nPigeon Wigs/Radiation Blues\n\nNext, let’s turn to Welsh alternative rockers Pigeon Wigs. From their website: Pigeon Wigs are a 5-piece rock ’n’ roll band newly sprung from Cardiff’s fertile soil. Formed from the writing partnership of Harry Franklin–Williams & Louis Jugessur, their music ranges from the bombastic and unrelenting to the sombre and fragile, indulging whatever genre best suits their aims while maintaining a through line that one can only describe as Pigeon Wigs. Okey dokey! If I see this correctly, the band released their first single Near the Knuckle in October 2021. Radiation Blues, co-written by Franklin-Williams and Jugessur, is a track off their debut EP Rock by Numbers. This is petty kickass!\n\nMiles Miller/A Feeling Called Lonesome\n\nMiles Miller is a drummer, guitarist and singer-songwriter blending country, Americana and bluegrass. According to his website, music has been Miller’s destiny since his childhood years in central Kentucky. In 2009, producer Dave Cobb (Chris Stapleton, John Prine, Sturgill Simpson, Jason Isbell, The Highwomen, etc.) spotted 16-year-old Miles playing drum covers on YouTube. Three years later, he introduced him to Simpson. While Miller’s drumming and singing skills made him known, his first love is the guitar. Leveraging time he had during the pandemic to write songs, he’s now out with this solo debut album ambitiously titled Solid Gold. Here’s A Feeling Called Lonesome – Miller is definitely off to a promising start!\n\nSad Park/Death\n\nI have time to squeeze in one more pick. According to their Bandcamp profile, Sad Park is an alternative emo punk band from Los Angeles, California comprised of vocalist/guitarist Graham Steele, bassist/backing vocalist Sam Morton and drummer Grant Bubar. In 2016 they released two EPs with the self-titled Sad Park and Good Start, Bad Endings. In 2018, they released their debut album Sleep and will follow up with their sophomore release in 2021. That sophomore, It’s All Over Now, has since come out in September 2021, and they are now up to their third and latest album No More Sound. Here’s the cheerfully titled Death, credited to all three members, as well as Aidan Memory and Danny Nogueiras, along with the quirky official video.\n\nAnd there you have it, folks. Well, not quite yet – this post wouldn’t be complete without a Spotify playlist of the above and a few additional tunes.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Far Outs Bandcamp page; Pigeon Wigs website; Miles Miller website; Sad Park Bandcamp page; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Sunday! Once again another weekend seems to be flying by but, of course, we cannot let this happen without visiting six tracks from six different decades with the magical music time machine. Hope you’ll join me for the ride!\n\nElliot Lawrence and his Orchestra/Alto Lament\n\nFor the start of today’s journey, let’s set our time machine to 1958. That’s when American jazz pianist and bandleader Elliot Lawrence recorded Alto Lament, a smooth track by Anthony Louis Scarmolin, an Italian-American composer, pianist and conductor. Based on what I could find, it appears the track was first included on an EP titled Definitely Lawrence! and released in 1959. Lawrence’s long career started in the 1940s. After recording and touring with his own band, he gave up jazz in the early 1960s and began composing and arranging for television, film and stage. Among others, he wrote the score for the great 1971 neo-noir action thriller The French Connection starring Gene Hackman, Roy Scheider and Fernando Rey.\n\nOasis/All Around the World\n\nAfter this relaxed start of our trip, let’s kick it up a notch with a song that couldn’t be more appropriate when traveling across different countries: All Around the World, a catchy tune by UK pop rockers Oasis. By the time they released their third album Be Here Now in August 1997, they already had established themselves as one of Britain’s most popular ’90s bands, only three years after emerging from obscurity with their debut Definitely Maybe. Like all other songs on Be Here Now, All Around the World was penned by the band’s lead guitarist and principal songwriter Noel Gallagher.\n\nTedeschi Trucks Band/Somehow\n\nFor this next pick, we shall travel back to the present. When listening to Somehow by Tedeschi Trucks Band, somehow, I keep thinking of Bonnie Raitt, one of my all-time favorite artists. Both Susan Tedeschi’s vocals and the music would make this track a perfect fit for Raitt. Written by the group’s member Gabe Dixon (keyboards, guitar, vocals) and songwriter Tia Sellers, Somehow is from their most recent studio album I’m the Moon, which came out in September 2022. Rightfully, Tedeschi Trucks Band called their fifth album the “most ambitious studio project” of their career to date. It was released in several installments, which I covered here and here at the time – terrific album!\n\nThe Kinks/Waterloo Sunset\n\nTime to pay a visit to the ’60s. Let’s hop across the pond to London. The year is 1967 and it’s the month of September. That’s when British rock band The Kinks came out with their fifth UK studio album, Something Else by the Kinks. And indeed, that release was something else! In no small part, that’s because of the incredible lead single Waterloo Sunset, which appeared in May of the same year. Written by Ray Davies, the tale about a solitary narrator reflecting on two lovers, the river Thames and Waterloo Station is an absolute gem in the band’s catalog, at least in my book!\n\nRoxy Music/Jealous Guy\n\nWhen I first heard Jealous Guy by Roxy Music on the radio in Germany in 1981, I immediately loved it. In my youthful innocence, initially, I thought the song was the English art rock band’s own tune, not realizing they had recorded it as a beautiful tribute single to John Lennon in the wake of his senseless murder in December 1980. At the time, I already owned Lennon’s great 1975 compilation Shaved Fish, but it didn’t include Jealous Guy – definitely a miss! Originally, Lennon had recorded the ballad for his September 1971 sophomore solo album Imagine. Eventually, I borrowed a copy of that album and taped it on music cassette. Nowadays, I dig both versions equally.\n\nJames Gang/Walk Away\n\nWhen you hang out with good friends, time flies – I can’t believe we’re reaching the final stop of another music time travel trip! Let’s end it with a kickass rocker by American rock band James Gang: Walk Away. Written by the great Joe Walsh, who had joined the group in early 1968, Walk Away was the opener of James Gang’s third studio album Thirds, released in April 1971. It would be Walsh’s final studio project with the band. After his departure in December 1971, he formed Barnstorm. Eventually, he was invited to join the Eagles in 1975 and continues to perform with them to this day.\n\nAs usual, the final thing I leave you with is a Spotify playlist featuring all of the above tracks. Hope there’s something you dig and you’ll be back for more!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; YouTube; Spotify\n\nIt’s Sunday, folks, and I’d like to invite you to join me on another time-travel journey into the amazing world of music. For first-time visitors, our eclectic trip will include six stops in six different decades and involve music in different flavors. Are you with me? All aboard, buckle your seatbelt and let’s go!\n\nCindy Blackman Santana/Passage\n\nOur first stop today is in May 1998 and some groovy jazz music by Cindy Blackman Santana (then still Cindy Blackman). I first came across this amazing drummer in 2014 while watching this clip of Lenny Kravitz, a longtime favorite artist. At first, I primarily paid attention to him before noticing this stunning African American lady on the drums. Then, as oftentimes happens, I was on to other music and “forgot” about Blackman until fellow blogger Lisa from Tao Talk prompted me to think of female artists in connection with her excellent Women Music March series. I already committed to pen a contribution for the 2024 run about Blackman who was introduced to the drums as a seven-year-old when she spotted a drum kit at a friend’s house and began playing. Soon thereafter, she joined the school band and persuaded her parents to get her toy drums. At age 11, she studied at Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Conn. and two years later started developing an interest in jazz after she had listened to Max Roach. She got her first professional drum kit at age 14 and subsequently moved to Boston to study Berklee College of Music. I just love everything about this story! In 1988, then-29-year-old Blackman released her debut album as a leader, Arcane, which mostly featured her own compositions. In 1993, she met Lenny Kravitz and was featured in the official video of his great hit single Are You Gonna Go My Way. Yep, she surely did and became his touring drummer for the next 18 years! In December 2010, she married that other famous guitarist, and they remain together to this day. Going back to May 1998, here’s Passage, an original Blackman composition from her studio album In the Now. Blackman was backed by top-notch jazz musicians, including saxophonist Ravi Coltrane (son of John Coltrane), Ron Carter (bass) and Jacky Terrasson (piano, Fender Rhodes).\n\nDr. Feelgood/Down At the Doctors\n\nI don’t know about you, but I don’t like going to the doctor, though I’m pretty quick with unsolicited advice to friends, telling them they should go if something bugs them. Miraculously, my reluctance tends to vanish pretty quickly when the treatment is music, so let’s next travel to October 1978 for a shot of R&B. Our doctor are kickass British pub rockers Dr. Feelgood. Fittingly, the treatment is called Down At the Doctors, a great blues rocker penned by Mickey Jupp. They recorded it for their sixth studio album Private Practice, best known for Milk and Alcohol, which became the band’s best-performing single. Founded in 1971, Dr. Feelgood are still around as a touring act, though with none of the co-founders. That said, three of the current members – Gordon Russell (lead and slide guitars, backing vocals), Phil Mitchell (bass, acoustic guitar, backing vocals) and Kevin Morris (drums, percussion, backing vocals) – first joined in 1983, a whopping 40 years ago! Lead vocalist and harmonica player Robert Kane has been with the group since 1999. Okay, let’s get some rock ‘n roll in the arm. While it’s not clear to me what happened to the eight bars on the piano, I know this: Down At the Doctors always makes me feel good!\n\nJohnny Cash/Folsom Prison Blues\n\nCharged up with a dose of R&B, let’s set our music time machine to October 1957 and the debut album by Johnny Cash. While for many years I essentially dismissed all country as hillbilly music, my obvious ignorance always had one exception. From the very first moment I heard Cash, I thought The Man in Black pretty much had the same coolness factor as early Elvis Presley. It also turned out the two artists started their recording career with producer Sam Phillips, founder of the legendary independent label Sun Records in Memphis, Tenn. Folsom Prison Blues, one of Cash’s best-known tunes, first appeared on Johnny Cash with His Hot and Blue Guitar! Nearly 10 years later, the tune also became the de facto title track of his first live album At Folsom Prison. On the original studio recording, Cash (vocals, rhythm guitar) was backed by lead guitarist Luther Perkins and upright bassist Marshall Grant, who ended up serving in that capacity for 25 years. In 1960, drummer W. S. Holland joined, and Cash’s backing band became known as The Tennessee Three. Folsom Prison Blues is a great example of that magic Sun Studios rockabilly sound. It also features one of the greatest storytelling lyrics I can think of: When I was just a baby/My mama told me son/always be a good boy/don’t ever play with guns/But I shot a man in Reno/ just to watch him die/When I hear that whistle blowing/I hang my head and cry – this is poetry!\n\nPaul McCartney/I Don’t Know\n\nWhile I love visiting music dating back 30, 40 and even more years, let’s not forget the current century. My proposition is September 2018, which saw the release of Paul McCartney’s 17th solo album Egypt Station. Sure, it’s no Band On the Run, but I would still call it a remarkable late career accomplishment and Macca’s best album in many years. Let’s check out I Don’t Know. The beautiful piano-driven ballad also became Egypt Station’s lead single in June 2018. Clearly, Paul’s vocals are weathered, but they are a perfect match for the tune, so I wouldn’t want them to sound any different! Last June, Macca turned 80. I had the thrill to see him at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey just a couple of days prior to his big birthday. He still had a ball on that stage!\n\nGang of Four/Call Me Up\n\nOur next stop takes us to 1982 and Call Me Up, a cool tune by English post-punk band Gang of Four. Frankly, I can’t quite remember how I came across that song, off their third studio album Songs of the Free. I suspect my streaming music provider served it up as a suggestion after I had listened to Televison’s excellent studio debut Marquee Moon. Obviously, there are some stylistic similarities. Like all other tracks on Songs of the Free, Call Me Up was co-written by the group’s Andrew Gill (guitar, vocals) and Jon King (vocals, melodica). Sara Lee (bass, backing vocals) and Hugo Burnham (drums, percussion) completed their lineup of the band, formed in Leeds in 1976. Along with co-founders King and Burham, Lee remains a Gang of Four member to this day. In October 2021, David Pajo officially was announced as having joined the group. This came in the wake of Gill’s untimely death in February 2020 at the age of 64.\n\nThe Kinks/Got My Feet On the Ground\n\nI hate to say it, but all things must pass, and once again we’re reaching the final destination of yet another Sunday Six. Let’s wrap up this trip with one of my all-time favorite bands, The Kinks. Together with The Who, they are early pioneers of punk, who influenced punk bands like Ramones and The Clash. In particular, I dig their ’60s music, which is convenient since we haven’t visited that decade yet on this trip – something that simply cannot occur, as long as I operate the time machine! So here are The Kinks with Got My Feet On the Ground, a deeper but nevertheless great cut. Co-written by the oftentimes feuding brothers Ray Davies (lead vocals, guitars) and Dave Davies (vocals, electric guitar), the song is off the group’s sophomore album Kinda Kinks. It’s one of the tracks featuring Dave on lead vocals. While The Kinks never formally split, the combative brothers’ relationship further deteriorated after their final show in 1996. But, dare I say it, things seem to have improved more recently, with media reports suggesting they have been talking to each other. Inevitably, this brings up the question about a formal reunion. “Ray and I have spoken about it,” Dave Davies told British online paper The Independent in July 2022, adding, “It’s possible!” We shall see!\n\nSources: Wikipedia; The Independent; YouTube; Spotify\n\nHappy Hump Day and welcome to another installment of Song Musings where I take a closer look at tunes I’ve only mentioned in passing or not covered at all to date. My pick for this week is Kodachrome, a great song by Paul Simon I was reminded of the other day when putting together a post about notable albums turning 50 this year.\n\nOne of these records is There Goes Rhymin’ Simon, his third solo album released on May 5, 1973. Not only is Kodachrome the opener of the album, but it also became its first single on May 19 that year. I’ve always loved the tune’s upbeat melody. Additionally, When I think back on all the crap I learned in high school is among the best memorable opening lines of a pop song I can think of.\n\nKodachrome became Simon’s highest-charting solo single at the time, peaking at no. 2 on both the U.S. and Canadian pop charts. Elsewhere, it climbed to no. 8 in France, no. 15 in The Netherlands and no. 40 in Australia. It was one of three charting singles off the album that altogether spawned six singles.\n\nThe tune also helped fuel the success of the album, which topped the charts in Sweden and climbed to no. 2, no. 3, no. 4 and no. 5 in the U.S., Canada, the UK and France, respectively. It also charted in Norway (no. 6), Australia (no. 7) and Finland (no. 17) – yes, I had to count them all! Here’s a nice live version from Simon’s 2012 gig at the Hard Rock Calling Festival in London’s Hyde Park.\n\nSimon, who last October turned 81, officially is retired from touring. He played his final regular concert in Flushing Meadows Corona Park, Queens, New York, on September 22, 2018. But apparently, Simon is not done with music. Last August, Spin reported he is working on a new album provisionally titled The Seven Psalms. It would be Simon’s first with new material since June 2016 when he released Stranger to Stranger.\n\nFollowing are some additional insights about Kodachrome from Songfacts:\n\nKodachrome is a registered trademark of the Kodak company. It is a method of color transparency, but more commonly known as a type of color film the company started marketing in 1935. Paul Simon was working on a song with the title “Coming Home” when the word “Kodachrome” came to him. He had no idea what it meant, but knew it would make for a much more interesting song than “Coming Home.” The song became an appreciation of the things that color our world, and a look at how our memories are framed to fit our worldviews.\n\nThis was not a hit in England, partly because UK radio stations rarely played it. The BBC had very strict rules about commercial endorsements, and they would not allow stations to play songs that seemed to push products. It’s the same reason The Kinks had to re-record part of “Lola.” The lyrics were, “We drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,” But Ray Davies had to redo them as “…Just like cherry cola” so the song could get airplay in Great Britain.\n\nPaul Simon recorded this at Muscle Shoals Sound Studios in Alabama with the famous Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. He sought out the musicians when he found out they played on “I’ll Take You There” by the Staple Singers, and was surprised to learn that they were not Jamaican musicians, but four white guys from the South. Simon went to Muscle Shoals to record just one song: “Take Me To The Mardi Gras,” but when they finished that one much sooner than he expected, he also recorded “Kodachrome” and “Loves Me Like A Rock.” Simon was the first big rock artist to record at the studios – Bob Seger and The Rolling Stones were some of the others who recorded there in the ’70s.\n\nDavid Hood, the bass player in the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, told us this story: “When Paul Simon walked into our studio, he thought, God, what a funky place. Because it was. He was used to working at A&R and Columbia Studios in New York, and studios in England and different places. And when he came and saw our little place, he probably thought, man, this is a rat trap.\n\nIt just so happened that the roof leaked in our studio right over the recording console, and as a short term fix, we taped sanitary pads across the ceiling just to absorb the water so it wouldn’t drop down on the recording console. So we had Paul Simon, who’s got hit record after hit record walking in and seeing this place with Kotex on the ceiling. He must have thought, what in the world have I gotten myself into? But we cut this track for him in two takes, and I think he thought, wow, well these guys know what they’re doing. It doesn’t really matter.”\n\nIn the song, Kodak film gets the title, but Simon uses a Nikon camera. That’s because it scans well in the line “I got a Nikon camera” – try inserting Kodak or Canon in there and it won’t sound right.\n\nSimon sometimes sings the line “Everything looks worse in black and white” as “Everything looks better in black and white.” He changes it a lot, and claims he can’t remember which way he wrote it.\n\nOn June 22, 2009, Kodak officially retired Kodachrome color film after 74 years. Photographers had turned to more recent Kodak products and digital technologies, which led to Kodachrome’s decline.\n\nSources: Wikipedia; Spin; Songfacts; YouTube"
