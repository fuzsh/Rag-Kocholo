        "text": "Bob Henrit\n\nDrums\n\nBob Henrit was originally the drummer with Buster Meikle & The Day Breakers, together with Russ Ballard on guitar and Roy Ballard, Russ's older brother, on piano. All usually appearing on stage dressed in matching red jackets & was it black collars? Russ left stage, his brother Roy behind him, Bob stage right & Buster singing up front. Cheshunt Boys' Club was a favored gig around '61. He then enjoyed initial success as a member of The Roulettes (1962-1967), who, in addition to a recording career of their own, backed the popular music singer Adam Faith on tour and on record. After the demise of the Roulettes, Bob briefly (1968) worked with Unit 4 + 2, an association which went back to his session drumming on their biggest hit, Concrete and Clay.\n\nIn late 1968, Bob teamed up with Russ Ballard, Jim Rodford and ex-Zombies keyboard player Rod Argent to form Argent, and remained with them until the band ended in 1976. After a brief spell with Jim Rodford and John Verity as Phoenix, Henrit's post-Argent career included work with a number of artists, including Charlie, after their 1978 tour opening for The Kinks, and Ian Matthews.\n\nAs a session drummer, he worked with The Who vocalist, Roger Daltrey, and was present on Dave Davies' Glamour and Chosen People solo albums. He also worked regularly with the GB Blues Band which, in addition to Jim Rodford, included former members of the Mike Cotton Sound.\n\nBob replaced Mick Avory as drummer in The Kinks, after Mick's departure in July 1984. He worked with the act until their seemingly final demise in 1996. He was the obvious choice to replace Mick, because he and Jim Rodford had already proven to be a capable and compatible rhythm section, and his previous ties with Dave Davies and with other musicians who had augmented The Kinks over the years.\n\nIn January 2007 Mick was unavailable for a Kast Off Kinks gig in Broxbourse, so Bob was enlisted to play drums. In 2008, he again sat in with the Kast Off Kinks at the Fan Club gathering at the Boston Arms, Tuffnell Park, on Dedicated Follower of Fashion, with Mick Avory as lead vocalist, and for a few later-era Kinks songs.\n\nPete Quaife\n\nBass, Backing vocals\n\nPete Quaife and school friend Dave Davies formed The Kinks in 1962 and subsequently asked Ray Davies to join.The band was originally called the Ravens and performed rhythm and blues at local venues such as the Hornsey Recreation Club at Crouch End Secondary School. The 'Kinks' name came about only upon the signing of a recording contract in late 1963.\n\nPete was commonly the voice of the band in early press interviews. He was temporarily replaced in the Kinks in mid 1966 by John Dalton, after a serious car crash left him unable to perform. He resigned from the band shortly thereafter, but reconsidered and returned in November 1966.\n\nFor the next two years Pete played on albums such as Something Else By The Kinks and The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, and helped rehearse some songs on the album Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). Pete left The Kinks permanently in April 1969. He was again replaced on bass, this time permanently, by John Dalton.\n\nIn 1969, Pete formed a collaborative Canadian/UK hybrid band, Maple Oak, with ex-Just Us bassist Stan Endersby, Mick Cook and Martin Fisher. They embarked on a tour of Denmark during May 1969 but after the tour Cook left and Fisher brought in fellow Canadian and former bandmate MacBain (ex-Flying Circus/Olivus/Bobby Kris & The Imperials) as a replacement. Pete departed shortly after the release of their single Son of A Gun in early 1970.\n\nPete joined the Kast Off Kinks on stage at the Dutch Kinks fan club meeting at the Stairway To Heaven, Utrecht, in 2004, to play Louie Louie (see the video page)"
