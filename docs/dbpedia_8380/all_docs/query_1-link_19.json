        "text": "A reunion of iconic English rockers The Kinks has been rumored for some time, and last year, Ray Davies confirmed that he and his former bandmates, brother Dave Davies and drummer Mick Avory, were working together. Now, Dave has spoken with Rolling Stone about the trio working out demos for a possible reunion album.\n\n“This has really been going on for a couple of years,” Dave says, noting that he, Ray and Mick have been diving into The Kinks’ archives to find tracks to include on the upcoming 50th anniversary box set of Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire), which is expected to be released in October. “We keep going backwards and listening to a lot of old stuff. Some of that is very good, and some of it needs a bit of work.”\n\nDave explains that the band is working on new songs from Ray, along with some of the unfinished tracks they found in the archives, but an album remains unconfirmed, as the efforts so far have been demos only.\n\nOn the topic of a possible reunion tour along with the album, Dave says, “I really don’t know. I think its possible. It’s not out of the question. But at this stage, it’s far too early to say. It would be fun though, wouldn’t it?”"
