        "text": "Have you ever wondered how the famous Italian Pizza Margherita came to be? Well, here is a bit of its history and it makes a great conversation starter after you baked the pizza in the wood fired oven and you are about to eat it at the table with your family and friends. In history books it has been written that in 1889 after the unification of Italy, Queen Margherita of Savoy, wife of King Umberto I visited Naples. To honor the Queen chef Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi created the pizza which celebrated the unification of Italy. So he wanted the pizza to represent the colors of the Italian flag that was now flying on the new nation-state. The tomato stood for the color red, the mozzarella stood for the white color and the basil represented the color green. So as to honor the Queen who has come to Naples they gave the name of the pizza, Pizza Margherita.\n\nSome say that its origins can be traced back to 1866 but it is this version that made this pizza famous. It is only with the Italian immigration that spread throughout the world that made known the Pizza Margherita as we of know of it today. Only with Alfa Pizza wood fired ovens it will be easy and fun to prepare the the famous pizza that has come from Naples, click on the link for the video recipe."
