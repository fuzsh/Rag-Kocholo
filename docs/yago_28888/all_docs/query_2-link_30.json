Margherita leads the Italian civilization.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPrincess Margherita of Savoy was the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy by marriage to Umberto I. Margherita was raised with the idea of paternalistic monarchy with the ideal of enlightened despotism. She became a great asset in this role with her ability to say and do the right things to effectively arouse public enthusiasm and feeling in her public appearances. During her representational tours through Italy, made to arouse popularity to the royal house and thereby the united nation of Italy, she was careful to wear local folk costumes and demonstrate enthusiasm for local customs, traditions and culture, a method which made her so popular that she eclipsed the popularity of her spouse.\n\nIntro[]\n\nUnited by centuries of culture and arts, Italy beckons her Queen to endear the hearts of her people to the nation. Take to the roads that weave through her wineries and across her countrysides. Embrace the customs and traditions that make Italy whole, and ensure that the Risorgimento is never undone.\n\nLeader Ability[]\n\nIcon Name Effect Il Regio Escursione Districts placed adjacent to the City Centre yield Culture equal to their adjacency bonus.
