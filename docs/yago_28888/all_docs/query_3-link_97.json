Catalina Micaela was the second daughter of Isabel of Valois and Philip II. Catalina left Spain in 1585 at age of eighteen to marry Carlo Emanuele, duke of Savoy; she eventually bore him nine children and died after premature birth of their tenth 1597. The correspondence from late September to November 1588 sheds light this key period when Catalina assumed political control of Savoy. Catalina in fact seems initially to have had trouble abiding by aspects of Spanish court etiquette. Catalina's letters from October and November 1588 are filled with expressions of affection and support for duke as he invaded and seized Saluzzo. Unlike other early modern Habsburg women, Catalina has left us a mountain of letters chronicling her daily life and marriage."
