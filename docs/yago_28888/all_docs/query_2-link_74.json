        "text": "Italy led by Umberto I is a custom civilization by JFD, with contributions from Alga, DarthKyofu, Gatoutak, Bernie14, and Whoward.\n\nThis mod requires Brave New World.\n\nOverview[]\n\nItaly[]\n\nThe Kingdom of Italy was a state founded in 1861 when King Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia was proclaimed King of Italy. The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which was its legal predecessor state. It existed until 1946 when the Italians opted for a republican constitution.\n\nUmberto I[]\n\nBorn 14 March 1844, Umberto received the rank of captain on his fourteenth birthday. He held a series of military commands beginning in October 1862 and saw action at Custoza against Austria in 1866. He married his cousin Margherita, daughter of Ferdinand, the duke of Genoa, on 22 April 1863. Umberto became king of Italy when his father, Victor Emmanuel II, died on 9 January 1878. Departing from his father's example, he ignored the legacy of the House of Savoy and took the title Umberto I rather than Umberto IV. Just ten months after he assumed the throne, the anarchist Giovanni Passanante tried to stab him (17 November 1878). Umberto escaped unscathed, but twenty-two years later another anarchist succeeded in killing him.\n\nKing Umberto inherited the challenges of establishing the infrastructure, laws, and institutions for the newly united Italian state and of securing its place among the powers of Europe. Political factionalism and the strains of economic modernization produced increasing tension and tumult during his reign. To popularize the monarchy, Umberto traveled widely in Italy, and he regularly visited the sites of earthquakes, floods, and epidemics to comfort the victims. His efforts to connect with the people earned him the label \"the good king.\" But Umberto did not limit his duties to ceremony. He played a role in turning Italy away from France and toward an alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, using his personal ties with fellow monarchs to smooth the way. He also encouraged Italy's imperialist ambitions in Africa.\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\n\"Newly united, Italy looks to their future in you, Umberto I. Ascending to her nascent throne in 1878, you quickly took to the challenge of entering Italy onto the world stage. Threatened by hostile France, you entered into the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary; forcing the world to recognise yours as one of the great powers of Europe. With allies newly forged, you could thus turn your attention to Italy's greatest ambition: in East Africa, and you would go on to oversee her rise as one of history's great empires.\n\nGood King Umberto, Italy has struggled hard to find her place in Europe. It falls upon you now to be a beacon of both unity and ambition. Can you reawaken Italy's dormant ambitions to secure a mediterranean empire? Can you elevate Italy's place amongst the great powers of Europe? Can you build a civilization that can stand the test of time?\"\n\nIntroduction: \"Hail. I am Umberto I, king of Italy. We are a small nation, it is true, but in due time we will show our worth. For now, treat with me as you would any other great power.\"\n\nDefeat: \"Centuries will not go so quietly extinguished. Italy will one day re-unite in the name of undoing this injustice.\"\n\nUnique Attributes[]\n\nItaly (Umberto I)\n\nFirst-born Colonies\n\nYou and your partner train Settler Units 10% faster for having an Open Borders arrangement (up to 100%).
