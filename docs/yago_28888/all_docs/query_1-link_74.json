        "text": "«The remains of His Royal Highness Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy and Prince of Naples have been interred - in a strictly private manner - within the royal crypt of the Superga Basilica in Turin, in the presence of His Royal Highness Emanuele Filiberto, Duke of Savoy, Prince of Piedmont, and Prince of Venice». This was announced in a note by the royal house. Thus concludes, months after the funeral at the Turin Cathedral, the odyssey for the burial of the remains of Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy.\n\nEmanuele Filiberto remembers his father: «He passed away peacefully. After his death, disgusting attacks. They didn't even give us time to mourn»\n\nThe Death\n\nVittorio Emanuele of Savoy, son of Umberto II, the last king of Italy, and Maria José, died last February 3rd in Geneva. He would have turned 87 on February 12th. The House of Savoy is one of the oldest dynasties in Europe, recognized at the end of the 10th century in the territory of the Kingdom of Burgundy. With the entry into force of the Republican Constitution on January 1, 1948, the Savoy family was forced into exile. The Savoys, however, went into voluntary exile in Portugal in 1946, the year of the referendum, but two years later with the arrival of the Constitution, the exile became effective. Only in 2002, in view of the repeal of the 13th provision, Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy and his son Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, by swearing in writing to the loyalty to the Republican Constitution and the President of the Republic, were no longer forced into exile from Italy. Thus, the following year, the male descendants of King Umberto II were able to return to Italy.\n\nThe Denied Permits\n\nSince February 10, the day of the funeral at the Turin Cathedral, the son of the last king of Italy had been waiting for a tomb in which to rest. The ashes of the late Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy were kept under lock and key in the Basilica. The superintendent had rejected the request of the former royal family for burial in the underground crypt of the Superga Basilica where other Savoys rest. The Savoy family was asked for a project that would harmoniously integrate with the existing architectural elements.\n\nThe Project\n\nBut what happened? It was March 1st when the offices of the House of Savoy asked the regional directorate of Piedmont of the State Property Agency for authorization to bury Vittorio Emanuele inside the royal mausoleum of the Superga Basilica. After the approval of the State Property Agency and the offices of the Minister of Economy and Finance, the green light from the superintendent was awaited in vain, who rejected the request for burial in front of the altar. On April 8, the superintendent's technicians went to the basement of the Basilica together with the house's emissaries to find a suitable place for the tomb of Vittorio Emanuele without having to modify the monumental elements. They tried to study a project that would “operate in addition without altering the architectural elements.” The burial in Superga was a desire of the family and also of the prince himself. According to the current project, the tombstone is very simple, with the inscription His Royal Highness Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, accompanied by the date of birth and death.\n\nThe Suffrage Celebration\n\n«Soon, at the same basilica and on a date that will be communicated in advance - it is announced -, a suffrage celebration will be organized. His Royal Highness Prince Emanuele Filiberto - concludes the statement - thanks again, alongside the institutions that made it possible to respect the last wishes of the late prince regarding his burial according to the tradition of the House of Savoy, those who, in recent months, have shared in the grief and mourning of the royal family, with particular gratitude to the many Italians - and among them, the many Turin residents - who have expressed their condolences».\n\nThe Other Savoys Buried There\n\nThe last Savoy funeral celebrated in the Cathedral (before Vittorio Emanuele) was that of Carlo Alberto of Savoy, one of the most important figures of the royal family, father of the Albertine Statute. Carlo Alberto of Savoy was also destined for burial in Superga and, in fact, even today at the center of the crypt stands the Sarcophagus of the Kings, which houses the remains of the King of Sardinia. The tomb of Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy has been placed near that of his ancestor: if the sarcophagus stands at the center of the crypt, the tomb of the son of the last king of Italy is just a few meters away, in the corridor leading to the Hall of Queens. In total, there are about seventy names of members of the House of Savoy, engraved on marble. These are the men and women who made the history of the royal house, starting from the sovereign who desired the construction of the Superga Basilica, Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy. The work, intended as a thanksgiving to the Virgin for defeating the French, was inaugurated in 1731.\n\nWhere the Last King of Italy is Buried\n\nThe Hall of Queens was designed to host the women of the House of Savoy, although over the years the spaces have also been opened to men. Here lies the tomb of Maria Adelaide of Habsburg-Lorraine, wife of the first King of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele II. She was Queen Consort of Sardinia, but did not become the first Queen of Italy: she died before her husband's coronation. The first Queen of Italy was Margherita of Savoy, consort of Umberto I, the second King of Italy. Both Margherita of Savoy and Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I were buried in Rome, at the Pantheon, the place intended for the kings of Italy.\n\nThe Marriage with Marina Doria\n\nVittorio Emanuele of Savoy was married to Marina Doria, with whom he had a son, Emanuele Filiberto. The couple got engaged in 1954 and then married in a civil ceremony in Las Vegas on January 11, 1970, and in a religious ceremony the following year in Tehran. Marina Doria was a former Swiss water skier of Italian origin. Vittorio Emanuele's father never gave his consent to the marriage.\n\nThe Death of Dirk Hamer\n\nVittorio Emanuele was investigated but then acquitted for the death of 19-year-old Dirk Hamer, which occurred on December 7, 1978, during a shooting on the night of August 17-18 on the island of Cavallo, in Corsica. The accusation claimed that the person who fired from a nearby boat to that of the 19-year-old German was Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy: however, he always denied the murder. The 19-year-old died after 111 days in the hospital, 19 operations, and the amputation of his leg. However, after the acquittal sentence, a wiretap in which he boasted of getting away with it, somehow confessing, caused a stir. The defense always maintained that the fatal shot came from someone else. But at that time, it was not possible to carry out all the necessary checks since the boat was immediately dismantled without being able to search it. Vittorio Emanuele was acquitted of murder charges in November 1991 by the Paris Court of Assizes and was only sentenced to 6 months in prison for the illegal possession of his firearm."
