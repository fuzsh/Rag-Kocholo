        "text": "She has a claim to Britain, I read she is the reason why Italy and Britain were quite in tension during the unification of Ireland, I read that she also wanted one of her sons as the King of Ireland which the Kingdom of Italy tried to pursue in WWI.\n\nFor Starters there would never be peace between the Habsburgs and Italians as Lombardy was made as her own dowry and for that reason the Italians never had to cede Nice and Savoy to France due to Austrians supporting the Italian unification.\n\nWhat if she died in infancy and Margaret of Savoy was the one chosen as Queen.\n\nWhat if she died in infancy and Margaret of Savoy was the one chosen as Queen.\n\nWell, no Margherita in Romania would probably tank the Italo-Romanian-Prussian alliance (which would further aggrevate France-England). OTOH, the Austrians had Mathilde of Teschen as a backup in case the Savoyard demands for Anna Beatrice's dowry were too steep. I suppose no Anna Beatrice means Mathilde gets pushed (sans Lombardy as a dowry - although I've seen speculation that Anna's cousin, Maria Teresa would've been proposed instead). Without Lombardy as a dowry, one wonders if the Savoyards would accept Mathilde or look elsewhere for a bride. Margherita seems a very \"low\" match, TBH\n\nWell, no Anna Beatrice means the Jacobite Claim swings over to her cousin, Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nHer aunt was the wife of the Legitimist Claimant to the French crown as Countess of Chambord and Duchess of Bordeaux, and her other aunt, the Countess of Montezon, whose husband became the Legitimist Claimant upon Chambords death.\n\nObviously this was contested, and he was only recognised by Anna Beatrice and her husband's support of the Counts claim and this undoubtedly contributed to the 100 Day Kingdom of Jean III in 1885.\n\nWell, no Anna Beatrice means the Jacobite Claim swings over to her cousin, Maria Theresa of Austria.\n\nHer aunt was the wife of the Legitimist Claimant to the French crown as Countess of Chambord and Duchess of Bordeaux, and her other aunt, the Countess of Montezon, whose husband became the Legitimist Claimant upon Chambords death.\n\nObviously this was contested, and he was only recognised by Anna Beatrice and her husband's support of the Counts claim and this undoubtedly contributed to the 100 Day Kingdom of Jean III in 1885.\n\nVenice with Istria and Trentino became independent and guaranteed by Britain due to that marriage if the marriage with Mathilde or Anna Beatrice never became a thing I imagine that they would annex all of Venice, Trentino, and Istria but the annexation of Venice is a possibility if Mathilde was the one chosen.\n\nKilling Anna Beatrice is more of a liability to Britain as France and Britain could be enemies.\n\nWell, no Margherita in Romania would probably tank the Italo-Romanian-Prussian alliance (which would further aggrevate France-England).
