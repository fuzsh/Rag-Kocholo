        "text": "Pizza Margherita is entirely made with mozzarella cheese, which should be as fresh as possible. They use mozzarella di bufala, an Italian type of mozzarella. You can then top it with some fresh tomatoes from Italy. If you can’t find San Marzano canned tomatoes, you’ll have to make do with regular canned tomatoes.\n\nMargherita pizza is a traditional Italian dish. This Margherita pizza, adapted from Roberta’s restaurant in Brooklyn, is low on cheese (less than 3 ounces of fresh mozzarella) and high on the sauce. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil, and a few freshly torn basil leaves on top of the sauce.\n\nIt tastes like fresh mozzarella. The sauce tastes sweet and tangy, similar to marinara or pasta sauce. The crust is delicious, with charred bubbles reminiscent of Neapolitan pizza. It’s difficult, but it’s doable.\n\nThe main distinction is that Margherita pizza is made with fresh mozzarella, which contains more liquid than regular mozzarella. The mozzarella on an American cheese pizza is drier than on a specialty pizza. Margherita’s recipe calls for fresh tomatoes and basil every time. These ingredients can be found in American pies as well.\n\nA Margherita pizza is technically a cheese pizza, but a regular cheese pizza’ is a simpler dish with tomato sauce and cheese on top. While mozzarella is the most common cheese used on a cheese pizza, other cheeses such as parmesan may be used in the toppings to create a unique flavor profile."
