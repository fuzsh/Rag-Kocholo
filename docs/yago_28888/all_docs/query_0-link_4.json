        "text": "Margherita of Savoy, the wife of King Umberto I of Italy and the first Queen of a united Italy, was a tall, blue-eyed blonde. She was no beauty, but she had style — tons of it.\n\nLove Triangle\n\nThe marriage between Margherita, 17, and Umberto, 24, was not what you’d call a love match. Their son, Victor Emmanuel, remained an only child for a reason: the royal couple stopped sharing a bed after less than two years after their big day.\n\nWhen he married Margherita, Umberto already had a long-term mistress — Eugenia, Duchess Litta Visconti Varese — an older woman who was the real love of his life. Eugenia lived with Umberto as his common-law wife, and Margherita was told to accept her as her lady-in-waiting.\n\nImagine having tea every day with your husband’s side piece.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nIf their marriage was a flop in the bedroom, however, Umberto and Margherita’s relationship was otherwise friendly: Umberto, who was indifferent to his wife as a romantic partner, greatly valued her as a working buddy. He appreciated her brains, political insight, and social skills, and often asked for her advice."
