        "text": "On 20 November 1851, Margherita of Savoy (1851-1926), who was to become the first queen of united Italy, was born in Turin.\n\nRight now, Palazzo Madama in Turin is hosting an exhibition entitled ‘Margherita of Savoy, Queen of Italy‘ (until 30 January 2023), which I invite you to visit for the extraordinary display of no less than 65 works, including portraits, paintings, sculptures, jewellery, clothes, musical instruments, manuscripts, books, tapestries, furniture and furnishings.\n\nMargherita of Savoy, queen from 1878 to 1900, was one of the most representative and beloved icons of the Savoy monarchy and her figure still remains extremely striking and popular today. As a modern influencer, she managed her image with great professionalism and had a great talent for public relations.\n\nMargherita was the daughter of a hero of the Risorgimento, Duke Ferdinand of Savoy-Genoa, nephew of King Victor Emmanuel II. Her mother was Elisabeth of Saxony, cousin among others of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth of Austria, as daughter of Amalie Auguste of Bavaria, one of the many aunts of the august imperial couple.\n\nIn 1868 Margherita married her cousin and heir to the throne, Umberto, immediately winning the hearts of Italians and contributing, with her popularity, to building the nation’s sense of identity around the Savoy crown.\n\nA woman of lively intelligence, strong character, with a passion for castles, military parades, uniforms and the history of the Savoy family, she was also more cultured than one might think: she loved poetry, the classics, she translated Elisabeth Browning’s verses into French, she discussed Dante, Shakespeare, Hugo and enjoyed a reputation, perhaps exaggerated, as a poetess. She was also a modern woman as evidenced by the fact that she was among the first to drive a car.\n\nShe imposed her redundant taste in fashion, decoration, her love of music and the mountains reverberated in the lives of the Italian aristocracy. She spearheaded activities in support of women and promoted the development of professional schools and charities.\n\nMargherita was always a great fan of jewellery, especially pearls, with which she loved to adorn herself conspicuously, as we can see in many official portraits. In 32 years of marriage, Umberto gifted her with a total of 16 strands of pearls, with which she adorned her most splendid toiletries, even though she knew that each strand was tantamount to at least one betrayal of Umberto!\n\nThe sentimental bond with the Italians remained alive even after the assassination of Umberto I in 1900 and accompanied her until her death, which occurred in Bordighera on 4 January 1926, when the Queen Mother was 74 years old.\n\nThe writer Indro Montanelli wrote of her: ‘She was a true and serious professional of the throne, and the Italians felt it. They realised that, even if they did not have a great king, they would have a great queen’."
