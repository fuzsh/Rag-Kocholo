        "text": "Tomb of King Vittorio Emanuele II, Pantheon\n\nBoth Vittorio Emanuele II (r. 1861-78), the first king of Italy, and his son and successor, Umberto I (1844-1900), are buried in the Pantheon. The inscription on the father's grand tomb proclaims him as: PADRE DELLA PATRIA (Father of the Fatherland). The tomb of his son, which stands opposite, is a rather less ostentatious affair.\n\nThe second king of Italy was assassinated by Gaetano Bresci (1869-1901) in the Italian city of Monza on July 29th, 1900. Little over a year later, on September 14th 1901, the twenty-fifth president of the United States, William McKinley (1843-1901), was shot and killed by Leon F. Czolgosz (1873-1901), who claimed that he had been inspired by the assassination of Italy's monarch. Both assassins were self-declared anarchists.\n\nUmberto I is interred with his wife Margherita of Savoy (1851-1926), queen consort of Italy.\n\nEquestrian Statue of King Vittorio Emanuele II\n\nMonument to King Umberto I"
