At seveteen she married her first cousin, Umberto, Prince of Piedmont. Their only child Victor Emmanuel, Prince of Naples (later King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy) was born in 1869.\n\nThereafter Margherita and Umberto lived separate personal lives yet aimiably worked together to assist the popularity of the the royal house throughout the peninsula. In January 1871, after the final unification of Italy and the proclamation of Rome as the capital of Italy, they settled in Rome.\n\nThere, Margherita successfully established the royal court at the center of Roman high society in her effort to subdue the opposition toward unification within the Roman aristocracy.
