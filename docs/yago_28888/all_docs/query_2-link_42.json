        "text": "Umberto I\n\n(1844–1900) was born in Turin in northern Italy on March 14, 1844, the son of King Victor Emmanuel II and his consort, Adelaide, archduchess of Austria. His schooling was basically military, and he spent most of his life as a soldier. He went into the army in 1858 as a captain and took part in the battles for Italian independence during the next 12 years. In 1868 he married Margherita, princess of Savoy. She gave birth to their son, who became King Victor Emmanuel III in 1900.\n\nUmberto came to the throne on January 9, 1878. His reign was mostly tranquil. He fended off strong antimonarchist sentiment by showing great respect for the Italian constitution. He also had to deal with criticism from reactionaries who were not reconciled to Italy’s incorporation of the Papal States, lands long held by the Roman Catholic Church. In foreign policy he promoted Italy’s alliance with a newly united Germany and with Austria-Hungary.\n\nUmberto promoted an Italian military buildup. But an attempt to conquer Ethiopia in 1896 failed, ending for the time Italian colonialism. Social unrest in the 1890s led the king to rule by martial law. Antimonarchists quickly united against him. He was assassinated on July 29, 1900, at Monza, by an anarchist.\n\nUmberto II\n\n(1904–83) was born at Racconigi Castle, near Turin, on September 15, 1904, the son of Victor Emmanuel III and Queen Elena. Like Umberto I, he became a soldier. After attending the Royal Military Academy, he went into the army as a colonel at 26. He married Princess Maris of Belgium in 1930.\n\nIn 1941, early in World War II, he was appointed a general. In October 1942, at the recommendation of Benito Mussolini, Italy’s dictator, Umberto became a marshal of the new Italian Empire. (Italy had, at last, conquered Ethiopia.) On June 5, 1944, his father named him lieutenant general of the realm. This was the same day the Allied troops entered Rome. A year after the war, on May 19, 1946, Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in favor of Umberto. But popular sentiment was against the monarchy. On June 2 the people voted for a republic. Umberto II went into exile in Lisbon, Portugal, with his family on June 14. He died in Geneva, Switzerland, on March 18, 1983."
