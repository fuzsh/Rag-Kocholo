        "text": "Every name has a meaning, and there is no name that is paired with something or someone by accident. Not even the pizza Margherita, the best-known and best-loved pizza in the world, is named so by chance. Its history has ties to royalty, indeed to monarchy, although it is a dish that speaks to everyone, as popular as the immortal image of Elvis Presley dancing with his guitar.\n\nAfter all, pizza is also in songs, not just Italian ones. Dean Martin (in Hollywood comedies he made history, paired with the legendary Jerry Lewis) \"immortalized\" it in the famous song That's love from 1953 (which continues to be chosen as the soundtrack of numerous films and serves as the musical framework for many commercials).\n\nWhen the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore ... In the song, which is an ode to \"vita bella,\" to Naples and to Italy, pasta with beans is also mentioned. But back to pizza Margherita. Who invented it? Sources report several names; it seems that similar preparations were part of the culinary culture of very ancient civilizations, such as the Egyptians. And even the Romans must have had something similar to the tasty disc of pasta on the menu.\n\nIn any case, the most credited version about the birth of pizza (as we know it today) is the one that names Raffaele Esposito, a Neapolitan chef. He seems to have been the one who created the version of pizza we call Margherita. Esposito chose the ingredients in homage to the Italian flag. The reason for the name is said to be the approval expressed by the Queen: during a visit to Naples by Margherita of Savoy and her husband Umberto I, the sovereigns intrigued by the popularity of the famous Neapolitan flatbreads wanted to experiment with them.\n\nRaffaele Esposito, the cook, prepared three pizzas. The one he liked best was topped with. tomato, mozzarella e basil. Queen Margherita particularly liked it, and for this reason the water-and-flour preparation was dedicated to her.\n\nThe Queen evidently inspired more than a few among her contemporaries, if even one of Carducci's Odi Barbare was dedicated to her.\n\nMargherita of Savoy was the first queen of Italy., although during her teenage years no one had imagined a royal future for her. Umberto I was supposed to marry an Austrian archduchess. The latter died prematurely, and Margherita became the ideal candidate to become Umberto I's wife. The wedding was celebrated in Turin. As queen, Margaret moved to Rome, and it is said that even republicans, in her presence, became royalists. Carducci's case is exemplary."
