The chapel and tombs were designed by Giuseppe Sacconi, and completed in 1910 by his student Guido Cirilli after Sacconi's death. Mike took this side-angle photo to show a view of both the king's and queen's tombstones, since the queen's grave marker is hidden behind the altar when viewed from the front. Umberto's tomb features an inscribed alabaster panel mounted in a gilded bronze frame, while Queen Margherita's tombstone is a smaller marble panel below his. The porphyry altar in the center of the chapel (partially visible on the right side of the frame) was created by Cirilli.",
