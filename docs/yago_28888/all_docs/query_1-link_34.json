On her arrival at the German embassy she was arrested, ostensibly for her subversive activities, but also as a threat to keep her father, the King of Italy, in line.

Mafalda died in Buchenwald concentration camp; she was severely wounded during an Allied bombing raid and had to have an arm amputated and she died the following day.\n\nLandgrave Philipp was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and put into solitary confinement for 20 months.

Against doctor's advice his parents transferred him on 30 August to Heidelberg University Hospital where he subsequently died on 7 December 1978. Quite a long time after the shooting on 18 November 1991 the Paris Assize Court sentenced Prince Victor-Emmanuel to six months imprisonment, suspended, for unauthorised possession and carrying of a US30MI rifle.
