Margherita of Savoy, Queen Consort of Italy, wife of Umberto I.

November 20, 1851 â€“ January 4, 1926

Whilst she and her husband were never romantically close (hence why they only had one child) they were close friends and Umberto relied on her often for political advice.

Margherita was a shrewd politician and always popular among the public, even when anarchists threatened the monarchy and eventually assassinated her husband. She remained popular as Dowager during her son's reign.
