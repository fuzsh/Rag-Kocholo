        "text": "The General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR or the Regulation) is a European law that expanded the privacy and security protections for individuals’ personal information. It regulates the collection, use, transfer, storing and other processing of personal information of individuals located in the EEA. The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. As of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom (UK) will have completed its transition period to leave the European Union and the GDPR will then no longer apply to the UK. The UK government has, however, “said that it intends to incorporate the GDPR into UK data protection law from the end of the transition period – so in practice there will be little change to the core data protection principles, rights and obligations found in the GDPR.” The primary applicable law will be the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (the UK DPA).\n\nThe GDPR will very likely apply to your research if the research activities will:\n\nbe conducted in association with an established organization in the EEA or UK,\n\ninvolve personal information collected from any person while they are in the EEA or UK,\n\ninvolve monitoring the behavior of persons while they are in the EEA or UK,\n\ninvolve transferring personal information out of the EEA or UK, or\n\ninvolve the secondary use of data that was protected by the GDPR or UK DPA when initially collected.\n\nIf you believe the GDPR or UK DPA may apply to your research, please submit the Researcher Global Privacy Questionnaire. For any other questions, please contact dataprivacy@tufts.edu.\n\nOverview\n\nWhat is the GDPR?\n\nThere are now two General Data Protection Regulations: in the European Economic Area (the EEA GDPR) and in the United Kingdom (as tailored by the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR). Both the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR regulate the collection, use, transfer, storing, and other processing of personal data of persons in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nTo which persons do the EEA GDPR and UK GDPR apply?\n\nThe EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR apply to all persons. There is no requirement that a person be a citizen or resident of a country that is a member of the EEA or of the UK.\n\nTo what countries does the EEA GDPR apply? What are the EU and the EEA?\n\nThe EEA GDPR applies to all 27 member countries of the European Union (EU). It also applies to all countries in the European Economic Area (the EEA). The EEA is an area larger than the EU and includes Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. As of January 1, 2021, the UK is no longer a member of the EU and is no longer subject to the EEA GDPR. Switzerland has also adopted a privacy law analogous to the GDPR.\n\nWhen do the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR apply?\n\nThere are three types of situations that are subject to the EEA GDPR and UK GDPR:\n\nIf a person is present in the EEA or the UK, any personal data collected from them in connection with the offering of a good or service is protected by that area’s GDPR, even if the organization offering the good or service is not established in that area. Protection for the personal data continues after the person leaves the EEA or the UK.\n\nEstablishments in the EEA or UK. If personal data is collected or otherwise processed in the context of the activities of any establishment in the EEA or UK, then the personal data is protected by that area’s GDPR, even if the processing occurs outside the EEA or the UK.\n\nIf a person is present in the EEA or UK, any personal data collected from them in connection with the monitoring of their behavior where the behavior takes place within the EEA or the UK.\n\nTo what data do the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR apply?\n\nThe EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR apply to all \"personal data,” which includes any information relating to a living, identified or identifiable person. Examples include name, SSN, other identification numbers, location data, IP addresses, online cookies, images, email addresses, and content generated by the data subject.\n\nThe EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR include more stringent protections for special categories of personal data. These are:\n\nRacial or ethnic origin\n\nPhysical or mental health data\n\nPolitical opinions\n\nSex life and sexual orientation\n\nReligious or philosophical beliefs\n\nGenetic and biometric data\n\nTrade union membership\n\nThe EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR also impose limitations on the processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses.\n\nPrivacy Statements\n\nTufts Global Privacy Statements, available on the Privacy Statements & Terms of Use page, include:\n\nGlobal Privacy Statement for Personal Data\n\nPrivacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants\n\nPrivacy Statement for Students\n\nPrivacy Statement for Tufts-Sponsored Study Abroad Programs\n\nPrivacy Statement for Job Applicants, Faculty, Staff, Consultants, and Other Persons Providing Services\n\nPrivacy Statement for Alumni, Donors and other Tufts Supporters\n\nPrivacy Statement for Research Participants\n\nPrivacy Statement for Online Education and Non-Degree Educational Program Participants\n\nRights\n\nThe EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR provide individuals with rights relating to their Personal Data. For information about how to make a rights request under the EEA GDPR or the UK GDPR, see How to Make a Subject Access Request.\n\nIf an individual has made a request seeking to exercise their EEA GDPR or UK GDPR rights, whether in writing or verbally, please provide that information promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, to dataprivacy@tufts.edu.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nSee GDPR Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) (PDF) for more answers to your EEA GDPR and UK GDPR questions.\n\nWorking with Information Protected by the EEA GDPR or the UK GDPR\n\nThe Restricted Institutional Data Handling Guidelines provide key rules for working with both EEA GDPR and UK GDPR data. The Guidelines include practical steps you can take to protect this sensitive information, as well as other Regulated Institutional Data.\n\nFor information on complying with the EEA GDPR and UK GDPR when working with mailing lists, see GDPR(+) Tasks for Tufts University Mailing Lists.\n\nFor information about complying with the EEA GDPR and UK GDPR for conferences to be held in the US, see GDPR Considerations for Tufts Conferences.\n\nResearch and the EEA GDPR and the UK GDPR\n\nFor information about the EEA GDPR, UK GDPR, and research at Tufts, go to Office of the Vice Provost for Research: EEA GDPR and UK GDPR. There you will find FAQs focusing on research, as well as other materials.\n\nMore Information\n\nFor more information, see:\n\nThe European Economic Area General Data Protection Regulation (EEA GDPR) and the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) - Frequently Asked Questions\n\nGDPR.eu, a Guide to Compliance developed in conjunction with the EU\n\nUK Information Commissioner Officer Guide to the UK GDPR\n\nWho to Contact"
