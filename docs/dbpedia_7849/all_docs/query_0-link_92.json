        "text": "The general principle is that a worker should be subject to the legislation of only one Member State at any one time. Workers are generally subject to the legislation of the state in which they are working, regardless of their place of residence or the location of the employer. Title II of Regulation (EC) 883/2004 contains particular rules, such as rules for civil servants, who are subject to the legislation of the Member State to which the administration employing them is subject, or for persons who are employed or self-employed in several Member States.\n\nPersons who are normally employed in two or more Member States are subject to the legislation of the Member State of residence if they pursue a substantial part of their activity in that Member State; if they do not pursue a substantial part of their activities in the Member State of residence, they are subject to the legislation of the Member State in whose territory the registered office or place of business of their employer is situated. However, in the case of self-employment, a person is subject to the legislation of the Member State of residence if the person pursues a substantial part of the activity in that Member State; if the person does not reside in one of the Member States in which a substantial part of the activity is pursued, the person is subject to the legislation of the Member State in which the centre of interest of the activities is situated.\n\nSpecial arrangements exist to provide for employees temporarily posted by their employer to work in another Member State. If the anticipated duration of the posting does not exceed 24 months and the employee is not replacing someone whose tour of duty has ended, the worker may remain insured in their “home” state’s scheme. If the work unexpectedly lasts longer than 24 months, the Member States involved may enter into a common agreement (under Article 16 of Regulation 883/2004), whereby the person may remain insured in the sending state. This agreement should be made in the interest of certain categories of persons and professions.\n\nMore information about the practice for the determination of the applicable legislation is available in the: Practical Guide: The legislation that applies to workers in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEU) and in Switzerland.\n\nThe A1 certificate\n\nThe portable document (PD) A1 certifies which social security legislation applies to the holder of the form. It will generally be needed in situations where an employed or self-employed person has a connection with more than one EU country through the work activity. Under the EU rules a person is only subject to the legislation of one country at any one time. The A1 is issued by the country to whose legislation the person is subject and, in turn, also confirms that the legislation of any other country to which the person is connected is not applicable. In other words, the worker will have no obligation to pay social security (including health insurance) contributions in the other countries involved. The A1 remains valid until the date of expiry, indicated on the form or until it is withdrawn by the issuing institution.\n\nWhere and when to obtain an A1 certificate?\n\nIn case of an employed person who goes to work temporarily in another EU country, the employer will normally apply for the A1 with the Department of Social Security, on the employee’s behalf. Employers should also apply for an A1 document on behalf of their employees when these normally pursue activities in more than one EU country. Self-employed persons should apply in their own right. An application should be submitted through the online application for an A1 document. Whenever possible, the application should be made before the activity begins in the other country.\n\nIf, on the other hand, a person is insured in another EU country and is going to work temporarily in Malta, an A1 document should be obtained from the social security institution where the person insured and present it to the Maltese employer.\n\nUse of the A1 certificate\n\nThe A1 should be kept available to be presented, by the worker and the employer, to the institution in the country where the activity is carried out, to confirm the social security position and to indicate in which country the security contributions will have to be paid.\n\nWhich situations does the A1 form cover?\n\nWhen you are sent by your employer to work temporarily in another EU country on his behalf for a maximum period of 24 months. This is known as a “posting”.\n\nThe conditions for posting are explained in the Practical Guide on applicable legislation.\n\nEmployers are required to fill in the employer’s questionnaire. If all the conditions for posting are fulfilled, the A1 form will be automatically issued and confirm that, you will remain subject to the legislation of Malta.\n\nWhen you are normally self-employed in an EU country and go to pursue a similar activity in another country for a maximum period of 24 months.\n\nSelf-employed persons are required to fill in the posting questionnaire. If all the conditions for posting are fulfilled, the A1 form will confirm that you will remain subject to the legislation of Malta.\n\nWhen you are employed or self-employed on board a vessel flying the flag of Malta\n\nUnless you reside in the same country where your employer is situated, the A1 form will confirm that you will be subject to the legislation of Malta.\n\nWhen you are performing an activity as flight or cabin crew of an aircraft whose designated home base is in Malta\n\nWhen the designated home base in terms of Annex III of Regulation 3922/91 is Malta , the A1 form will confirm that you will be subject to the legislation of Malta.\n\nWhen you are normally employed in more than one EU country at the same time or in alternation.\n\nDepending on your situation, you may be subject to the legislation of either your country of residence or the country in which the registered office or place of business of your employer is situated.\n\nIn this case the determination of the applicable legislation is carried out by the social security institution in the Member State of residence.\n\nWhen Malta is the Member State of residence responsible for carrying out the determination of the applicable legislation, the employer is required to fill in the employment questionnaire.\n\nWhen you are normally self-employed in more than one EU country at the same time or in alternation.\n\nDepending on your situation, you may be subject to the legislation of either your country of residence or the country where your centre of interest is situated.\n\nWhen you pursue both an employed and self-employed activity in different EU countries.\n\nIn this situation, the A1 form will confirm that the legislation of the country of your employed activities prevails.\n\nWhen you are a Maltese civil servant pursuing activities in more than one EU country.\n\nIn this situation, the A1 form will confirm that you remain under the legislation of Malta.\n\nWhen it is your interest to derogate from any of the above rules,\n\nTwo or more EU states may, on the request of your employer, agree that you will be subject to the legislation of a state other than that provided by the normal rules. The A1 form will confirm to which legislation you are subject.\n\nInsurability for Mariners working on board Maltese flagged vessels\n\nIn terms of Article 11(4) of Regulation 883/2004, persons employed or self-employed on board a vessel flying the flag of Malta shall be subject to pay their social security contributions in the Maltese social security scheme. The only exception to this rule is applied in case the employer is located in the same EU country of residence of the employee. It is pertinent to note that Article 11(4) applies only when the vessel operates on the high seas. Vessels operating in internal waterways (such as on river boats) are treated in terms of Article 13 of Regulation 883/2004 dealing with persons working in two or more Member States.\n\nThe provisions of Article 11(4) apply only to EU nationals and Third Country nationals legally resident in the EU. Other persons working on board a Maltese flagged vessel are not subject to the same provisions. Such cases shall be treated in terms of the Maltese Social Security Act (Chapter 318 of the Laws of Malta) which exempts from the payment of social security persons who are not ordinarily resident in Malta and whose employer does not have a place of business in Malta (Article 1 of Part I of the First Schedule).\n\nUK nationals working on a Maltese flagged vessel, shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement if their activity started before the 31st December 2020. For UK nationals whose activity on board a Maltese flagged vessel started after the 1st January 2021, shall be treated in accordance with the provisions of the Protocol between the EU and the UK. In both scenarios, the flag state principle applies.\n\nIn view of the above, it may result that an employer located outside of Malta is liable to pay the social security payments in the Maltese scheme on behalf of those employees who have been determined subject to be insured in Malta. In this case, the employer should make arrangements with the office of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in order to effect the payments.\n\nGetting insured in the Maltese social security scheme\n\nWhen the outcome of the process for the determination of the applicable legislation, indicates that the Maltese social security scheme applies, the worker is directed to apply for a social security number. An online application is available here.\n\nBenefits provided under the Maltese social security scheme\n\nOnce insured in the Maltese scheme, EU Nationals resident in the EU, UK Nationals covered by the Withdrawal Agreement, and Third Country Nationals legally resident in the EU (except for UK nationals covered by the Protocol), shall be covered against the following contingencies:\n\nSickness, maternity and equivalent paternity benefits\n\nSickness Benefit\n\nMaternity Benefit\n\nMaternity Leave Benefit\n\nOld-age pensions, survivors’, and invalidity benefits\n\nOld-age Pensions\n\nTwo-Thirds Pension\n\nRetirement Pension\n\nIncreased Retirement Pension\n\nNational Minimum Pension\n\nIncreased National Minimum Pension\n\nDecreased National Minimum Pension\n\nContributory Retirement Grant for Non- Pensioners\n\nSurvivors’ benefits\n\nSurvivor’s Pension\n\nWidow/er Pension\n\nInvalidity benefits\n\nInvalidity Pension\n\nIncreased Invalidity Pension\n\nNational Minimum Invalidity Pension\n\nUnemployment benefits\n\nUnemployment Benefit\n\nTransfer of Unemployment Benefit in the EU\n\nFamily benefits\n\nChild Allowance (Flat Rate or Income-Based)\n\nDisabled Children’s Allowance\n\nFoster Care Allowance\n\nIn-Work Benefit\n\nOrphan’s Allowance\n\nOrphan’s Supplementary Allowance\n\nBenefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases\n\nInjury Benefit\n\nInjury Pension\n\nInjury Grant\n\nUK Nationals resident in the UK who started their cross-border activity in Malta after the 1st January 2021 shall be covered against the same contingencies except for the following:"
