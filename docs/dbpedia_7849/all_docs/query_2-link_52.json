        "text": "Local self-government denotes the right and the ability of local authorities, within the limits of the law, to regulate and manage a substantial share of public affairs under their own responsibility and in the interests of the local population.\n\nArticle 3 paragraph 1 requires that local authorities should have “a substantial share of public affairs under their own responsibility”. Although the Charter does not specify which tasks and functions must fall within the remit of local government, it should regulate and administer primarily those public affairs which affect the local community most and which it can carry out more effectively.\n\nMunicipalities play a crucial role in local democracy in Liechtenstein and have wide-ranging powers. It is worth recalling that in 2006 Congress Recommendation 196 suggested increasing local government's role in the welfare services, and regional and town planning. During this monitoring visit, no similar problems were raised, except for community-level planning and development.\n\nThe democratic character of local authorities, based on their direct legitimacy and the holding of free elections, which are core values of the Charter entrenched in Article 3 paragraph 2, is indirectly guaranteed by the Liechtenstein Constitution. According to Article 110 paragraph 2.a. of the Constitution, the Municipalities Act has to establish the principle of free election of mayors and other officials of the municipalities. Article 111 guarantees that all Liechtenstein citizens who have reached the age of 18 and are not deprived of their voting rights shall be eligible to vote in the municipalities where they reside. Councillors are elected for four years on electoral lists.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Municipalities Act permits local citizens to initiate popular votes (referendums) on local matters, while in certain cases (such as changes in municipal boundaries) a local referendum is mandatory.\n\nConsequently, the rapporteurs conclude that the situation in Liechtenstein complies with Article 3 paragraphs 1 and 2.\n\nPowers given to local authorities shall normally be full and exclusive. They may not be undermined or limited by another, central or regional, authority except as provided for by the law.\n\nAs to the requirement of the full and exclusive exercise of local government powers, in general the Municipalities Act explicitly distinguishes between “own” and “delegated powers” (eigene” and übertragener Wirkungskreis). However, the rapporteurs observed that in some areas, the responsibilities of the central government and the municipalities seem overlapping that does not allow for the powers given to local authorities to be full and exclusive.\n\nDuring the visit the rapporteurs observed that some tasks of local authorities, like the issuing of building permits or community planning and development, require joint action with state administrative bodies. During the consultation procedure the government informed the rapporteurs that according to the existing legal regulations in the area of building permits or community planning and development the central administration monitors compliance with the Building Law and grants building permits while the municipalities monitor compliance of projects with building regulation at municipal level and since structure plans exist both at national and municipal level, the government monitors municipal structure plans with regard to their compliance with the national structure plan and with the legal requirements.\n\nHowever, during the meetings the rapporteurs heard criticisms in relation to unjustified central government intervention in clearly local matters, such as the designation of local residential areas.\n\nMoreover, the municipalities’ power to prepare and adopt their own annual budget is not full and exclusive, since all municipal budgets must be approved by the central government.\n\nThe municipalities and the central government also have some shared functions and tasks in the field of public education. However, here, even if public education can be regarded at a very abstract level as a shared responsibility, in practice various tasks are carefully separated and clarified. While municipalities are responsible for paying teachers and maintaining primary school buildings, the central state carries out a number of professional tasks (e.g., it is responsible for curricula).\n\nTherefore, in the opinion of the rapporteurs, Article 4 paragraph 4 is partially complied with by Liechtenstein.\n\nWithout prejudice to more general statutory provisions, local authorities shall be able to determine their own internal administrative structures in order to adapt them to local needs and ensure effective management.\n\nAccording to Article 6 of the Charter, local authorities shall have the right to determine their internal administrative structures and must be able to adapt them to local needs and ensure effective management. The Charter requires that the right conditions should be established for the holding of office by local elected representatives in order to ensure the free exercise of their functions.\n\nThe Municipalities Act of 1996 determines the basic features of municipal organisation. It regulates in detail the composition, powers and duties of municipal bodies. Local officials are elected by the Municipal Assembly or the Council and local authorities are free to establish their own structures (such as committees).\n\nAs for local government staff, there are no uniform rules governing the civil service in the country. Administrative staff are employed by each municipality on the basis of a specific municipal regulation. The Municipalities Act obliges local authorities to adopt local regulations on the public service and the wages of local administrators (Dienst- und Besoldungsreglement, sections 61-62 of the Municipalities Act). The central government authorities have instituted no limit on the number of staff employed by municipalities.\n\nAs a consequence, the rapporteurs consider that paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 6 of the Charter are complied with in Liechtenstein.\n\nThe conditions of office of local elected representatives shall provide for free exercise of their functions.\n\nIn relation to paragraph 1 of Article 7, the rapporteurs would underline that the Municipalities Act does not specify the legal status of councillors, but does regulate the status of the entire council as the supreme managing and executive body of a municipality. While the Act includes provisions relating to the rights of local voters as members of the municipal Assembly to initiate referendums, make proposals, address questions to municipal bodies or participate in local elections, it does not specify the rights enjoyed by members of the municipal council.\n\nDuring the monitoring process, the rapporteurs did not identify any obstacles that would impede local elected representatives in the exercise of their functions.\n\nThe rapporteurs observed that, in general, mayors work full-time. Members of municipal councils work part-time within the council (Gemeinderat) and combine their electoral mandate with other professional activities. They are entitled to a fair allowance to cover the costs of performing their official duties and receive appropriate compensation for loss of remuneration.\n\nThe Municipalities Act contains strict incompatibility rules for the election of municipal councils. Close relatives of councillors and staff of the municipality, members of the Government, and judges of the Administrative and Constitutional Courts may not be elected as representatives of the council (section 47). The Act lays down conflict of interest rules not only for council membership, but also for the work of the municipal council. For example, section 50 of the Act specifies the matters in which the representatives concerned are to be excluded from the decision-making process. The rapporteurs therefore have sufficient evidence that Article 7 paragraph 3 of the Charter is duly implemented.\n\nConsequently, the rapporteurs conclude that Liechtenstein complies with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 7.\n\nAny administrative supervision of local authorities may only be exercised according to such procedures and in such cases as are provided for by the constitution or by statute.\n\nAny administrative supervision of the activities of local authorities can only aim at ensuring compliance with the law and constitutional principles. Administrative supervision may, however, be exercised by higher-level authorities with regard to expediency in respect of the tasks delegated to local authorities. Another important requirement which can be inferred from the Charter provisions is that the law should precisely define the administrative authorities empowered to exercise legal supervision over municipalities, thus eliminating the uncertainty inherent in the current legislation.\n\nIn line with the requirements of the Charter, the rules governing central control over local authorities in Liechtenstein, and the powers of the central authorities concerned, are determined by the Municipalities Act (sections 116-118).\n\nRegarding local government responsibilities, oversight is generally confined to a review of the lawfulness of municipal acts. As far as delegated powers are concerned, the review also extends to the appropriateness and effectiveness of local measures. The Government may lodge a complaint with the municipal council against a decision on local matters (Verwaltungsbeschwerde).\n\nHowever, the rapporteurs wish to raise a particular concern about the system of central government approval of local budgets. The delegation was told that when approving local budgets the government only checks whether the particular municipal budget is well–balanced (i.e., there is no deficit). During the consultation procedure, the government informed the rapporteurs that the municipalities are urged to maintain a balanced budget in the medium term according to Article 3 of the Act on the Financial Budget of the Municipalities (Gesetz über den Finanzhaushalt der Gemeinden) of 2015. The government further argued that it does not check the content and the volume of the local budgets but only their form and legality according to Article 10 of that Act.\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that the adoption of a municipal budget is not a delegated power, but a so-called “own responsibility”, the core function and entitlement of local government, which gives municipalities greater autonomy. The Government’s power of approval is not necessary for the conduct of a legal review. The rapporteurs are of the opinion that the existence of such a system of local budget approval permits state intervention in local economic management and opens up the possibility for the Government to keep local government budgets under control, even though this possibility is only theoretical since no such intervention has been reported as taking place in practice.\n\nThe rapporteurs also consider that the extent of financial oversight made possible by central government approval of local budgets constitutes disproportionate interference in local self-government. Moreover, with regard to the well-balanced financial situation of the municipalities, the Government’s approval based on checking whether municipalities have planned a budget deficit does not appear necessary.\n\nThe rapporteurs therefore conclude that paragraph 1 of Article 8 is complied with in Liechtenstein, while paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 8 are not complied with.\n\nLocal authorities shall be entitled, within national economic policy, to adequate financial resources of their own, of which they may dispose freely within the framework of their powers.\n\nAccording to Article 9 paragraph 1 of the Charter local authorities should have adequate financial resources of their own, of which they may dispose freely within the framework of their powers. Financial autonomy is an essential component of the principle of local self-government and an important condition for the exercise of a wide range of responsibilities in the field of local public affairs. These elements are cumulative and not alternative, which means that all the conditions laid down in Article 9 of the Charter are mandatory. Another basic principle requires that local authorities should have sufficient financial resources in proportion to the responsibilities assigned to them by law.\n\nThe financial situation of local authorities in Liechtenstein is such that their share of public expenditure is one of the highest in Europe. This means that a considerable proportion of public spending is carried out by local authorities.\n\nCompared to other European countries, the municipalities of Liechtenstein have continued to enjoy a good financial situation despite the world economic and financial crisis. While state revenues significantly decreased during the crisis, municipal revenues remained more or less stable. In fact, the municipalities’ share in total government revenues increased from 24.2% in 2011 to 30.4% in 2015. It is worth noting that this proportion has been steadily increasing since 2012. As a consequence, some of the persons to whom the Congress delegation spoke claimed that the Liechtenstein municipalities are generally in a better financial situation than the central government, which might be a unique situation in Europe.\n\nLocal authorities have revenues from central grants, local and shared taxes and other own resources.\n\nBased on the data available to the rapporteurs, less than a quarter of local government revenues is derived from central grants. There are no precise data about either their percentage or structure (block versus specific grants). The method of allocation of block grants is determined by the Financial Equalisation Act of 2007, whereby municipalities whose taxation capacity and financial resources do not enable them to fulfil their mandatory tasks and functions are entitled to a state subsidy. In other words, general or block grants are allocated only to those municipalities whose financial needs exceed their resources. Financial needs are calculated on the basis of the per capita costs of mandatory functions, taking the average of the previous four years, while taxation capacity is based on the tax revenue per inhabitant. The fact that fewer municipalities receive financial equalisation grants today than was the case some years ago demonstrates the favourable financial situation of local authorities.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the ratio between local revenues and central grants varies according to the municipality. In Triesenberg, for example, almost half of total revenue comes from the financial equalisation system, and the proportion of tax revenues is much lower than the national average.\n\nIn addition, some earmarked grants can be allocated to local authorities for specific goals (e.g. for projects with nationwide interest or for environmental remediation). During the consultation procedure the government informed the rapporteurs that many earmarked grants were compensated with the Financial Equalisation Act (Finanzausgleichsgesetz) of 2007.\n\nNevertheless, it is certain that the bulk of local government revenues (more than 60%) comes from taxes. Municipalities receive a share of business tax, as the Tax Act of 2010 states that a municipality in which a company is domiciled is entitled to 35% of the respective tax on profits. Furthermore, each municipality is entitled to levy a surcharge tax on the state tax on personal assets and income.\n\nLocal authorities may also obtain revenues from charges and fees paid for local public services delivered by the municipalities, such as waste disposal. Municipalities may use their assets as financial resources by selling municipal real estate and other property.\n\nOwing to the significant proportion of local revenues in total financial resources, local authorities can freely dispose of their funds provided that their budgets have been approved by the central government.\n\nThe well-balanced local government budgets show that the financial resources available to the municipalities are adequate and proportionate to their mandatory tasks and functions. The high proportion of tax revenues in local resources and the budgetary surpluses that are frequent in most local budgets provide sufficient evidence for the rapporteurs to conclude that the relevant requirements of the Charter (i.e., paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 9) are fully implemented in Liechtenstein.\n\nLocal authorities shall have the right of recourse to a judicial remedy in order to secure free exercise of their powers and respect for such principles of local self-government as are enshrined in the constitution or domestic legislation.\n\nAs far as the legal protection of local authorities is concerned, municipal councils can appeal to the Administrative Court against a supervisory act of the Government if they consider that it is unlawful and restricts local self-government.\n\nMunicipalities also have the right, within the limits of the law, to petition state authorities and initiate referendums in order to defend their rights.\n\nAlthough local authorities are not legally entitled to submit constitutional complaints to the Constitutional Court (Staatsgerichtshof) for legal protection in a case involving a violation of their rights, the Congress delegation was informed that judicial practice has developed this right. However, this remains purely theoretical, since no such complaint has been submitted to the Court in the last ten years. Given that the Constitutional Court can also rule on jurisdictional conflicts between public authorities, in theory at least, municipalities can appeal to it in the event of an abuse of power by a state authority.\n\nThe rapporteurs were informed that there are wide-ranging possibilities and good instruments for the legal protection of municipalities, and these mechanisms and procedures are laid down in the Municipalities Act. However, they were told that in practice “there is no need for them” since municipalities can usually solve all problematic issues through direct contact with the Government.\n\nIn the light of the above, the rapporteurs consider that Liechtenstein municipalities have various legal instruments to protect their rights and interests, ranging from the judicial review of actions taken by the state to the right to initiate local referendums. They therefore conclude that Article 11 is duly implemented in Liechtenstein."
