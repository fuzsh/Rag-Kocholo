The colour display uses the traffic light palette, with Green representing a score closer to 100% and Red a score closer to 0%.\n\nEach pie charts stands for a category and is divided in slices by criteria. When a country complies with a criteria – fully or in some regions – the slice is coloured.\n\nKeep in mind the criteria have different weighting factor within a category; for example, the criteria Prohibition of medical intervention without informed consent (intersex) stands for half (2.5%) of the INTERSEX BODILY INTEGRITY category weighting factor (5%). Meaning that even if a country can only comply with this specific criteria whitin the category (1/4 total criteria) the category scores 50%."
