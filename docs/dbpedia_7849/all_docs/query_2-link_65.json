        "text": "Yes, according to Liechtenstein criminal law, a distinction is drawn between state-related and commercial (private) bribery, depending on whether a public official is involved.\n\nThe Liechtenstein Criminal Code defines a public official as either an office holder or an arbitrator. An office holder is a person who:\n\n(i) exercises legislative, administrative or judicial responsibilities as an organ or employee of the state, a municipal association, a municipality, another person under public law, a foreign state or an international organisation;\n\n(ii) in any other way is authorised to exercise official duties in the execution of laws on behalf of the state, a municipal association, a municipality, another person under public law, a foreign state or an international organisation; or\n\n(iii) acts as an organ or employee of a company of which either domestic or foreign regional authorities (directly or indirectly) own a stake of more than 50% or which is state-operated or controlled (by financial, economic or organisational means).\n\nIn connection with bribery and corruption, no distinction is made between domestic and foreign public officials.\n\nActive state-related bribery is committed by any person who (a) offers, promises or provides to an office holder or arbitrator a benefit to be granted to such office holder or arbitrator or to a third party in return for any execution or omission of official duties in violation of such duties, or (b) offers, promises or provides to an expert appointed by the court or another authority in relation to particular proceedings a benefit for such expert or a third party in return for the provision of a false finding or false opinion. Passive state-related bribery is committed by (a) any office holder or arbitrator who demands, accepts, or accepts the promise of a benefit for himself (or herself, whereby references to the male form cover all genders in the following) or a third party in return for any execution or omission of official duties in violation of such duties, or (b) any expert appointed by the court or another authority in relation to particular proceedings who demands, accepts or accepts the promise of a benefit for himself or for a third party in return for providing a false finding or false opinion.\n\nActive bribery in commercial dealings is committed by any person who, in commercial dealings, offers, promises or provides a benefit to an employee or agent of an enterprise for such employee or agent or a third party in return for any execution or omission of a legal act in violation of his duties. Any employee or agent of an enterprise who, in commercial dealings, demands, accepts or accepts the promise of a benefit from another person for himself, or a third party in return for any execution or omission of a legal act in violation of his duties, likewise commits passive bribery.\n\nIn addition, the following related offences in the state sector have to be noted:\n\n(a) Giving and acceptance of benefits: Any person who offers, promises or provides to an office holder or arbitrator an undue benefit for such office holder, such arbitrator or a third party in return for any execution or omission of official duties in line with such duties commits the offence of giving of benefits. The offence of acceptance of benefits is committed by an office holder or arbitrator who demands a benefit for himself or a third party, accepts, or accepts the promise of an undue benefit in return for any execution or omission of official duties in line with such duties. It is therefore explicitly expressed in the law that it is not acceptable for an office holder or arbitrator to make the performance or omission of an official act dependent on the granting of any benefit.\n\n(b) Giving and acceptance of benefits for the purpose of influencing: The offence of giving of benefits for the purpose of influencing is committed by any person who offers, promises or provides to an office holder or arbitrator an undue benefit for such office holder, such arbitrator or a third party in return for any execution or omission of official duties in line with such duties. Likewise, an office holder or arbitrator who demands a benefit for himself or for a third party, accepts, or accepts the promise of an undue benefit and does so with the intent that this has an influence on his capacity as an office holder commits the offence of acceptance of benefits for the purpose of influencing.\n\n(c) Prohibited intervention: Liechtenstein criminal law also sanctions any person who demands, accepts, or accepts the promise of a benefit for himself or for a third party in return for exerting undue influence on the decision-making of an office holder or arbitrator. Prohibited intervention is likewise committed by any person who offers, promises or provides a benefit to another person so that such other person exerts undue influence on the decision-making of an office holder or arbitrator. Exerting such influence is considered undue if it is directed at any execution or omission of official duties in violation of such duties or if it is associated with the offer, promise, or provision of an undue benefit for the office holder or arbitrator or for him to be given to a third party.\n\nFurthermore, under certain circumstances bribery payments or the acceptance of such payments can be punishable as criminal breach of trust, both in the state and the private sector."
