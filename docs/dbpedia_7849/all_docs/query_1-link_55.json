        "text": "Landlocked in the center of Europe are the two main states of Switzerland and Austria. Sandwiched on the border of these two states is the ministate of Liechtenstein.\n\nThis region is dominated by the Alpine ranges. Switzerland, officially known as the Swiss Confederation, is divided into twenty-six cantons (states). Because of its location and close ties with neighboring countries, four languages are spoken in Switzerland: German, French, Italian, and Romansh.\n\nRomansh is one of the descendant languages of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire! Romansh originates from the spoken Latin brought to the region by Roman soldiers, merchants, and officials following the conquest of the modern-day Grisons area by the Romans in 15 BC.\n\nTypically, one language predominates in any given canton.\n\nBerne is the country’s capital, and Geneva, Zurich, and Basel are the other major cities. Switzerland’s land area is just slightly larger than the US state of Maryland.\n\nSwitzerland has more than 1500 lakes and contains 6% of Europe’s stock of fresh water. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. Because of the mountains, skiing, snowboarding, and mountaineering are among the most popular sports.\n\nInternationally, Switzerland is well known for its political neutrality. The UN European offices are located there. The Red Cross and the main offices of many international organizations are located in Switzerland. Swiss culture is thought to have benefited from Switzerland’s neutrality. During times of war and political turmoil, creative people found refuge within the Swiss borders. Swiss banking practices and policies are known throughout the world, and Swiss banks have benefited greatly from the country’s politically neutral status. Banking is one of the country’s top employers and sources of income. The Swiss people enjoy a high standard of living.\n\nThere is an emphasis on science in Swiss culture with good historical reason: the field of modern chemistry originated in Switzerland. The Bernoulli family, famed for their significant contributions to mathematics over many years, hails from Basel. The Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, one of the top-ranked universities in the world, has produced an unusually high number of Nobel Prize winners. Albert Einstein, though born in Germany, relocated to Switzerland and later became a Swiss citizen.\n\nThe cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some dishes such as fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent through the country, each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages. Chocolate has been made in Switzerland since the 18th century. The Swiss are the world’s largest consumer of chocolate!\n\nSwitzerland is also famous for the St. Bernard, a large working dog from the western Alps that was originally bred for rescue.\n\nYou may want to watch this video at 2x speed.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria is a largely mountainous country because of its location in the Alps. Austria is larger than its neighbor Switzerland and is similar in area to the US state of South Carolina. Austria has various Alpine ranges, with the highest peak at 12,457 feet in elevation. Only about a fourth of the land area is considered low lying for habitation. The Danube River flows through the country, including the capital city of Vienna. Austria has a well-developed social market economy and a high standard of living.\n\nFor more than six hundred years, beginning just before the dawn of the fourteenth century, Austria was tightly associated with its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs. The Habsburgs came to power in a new way with the formation of the Austrian Empire in 1804. In Germany’s rise to power before World War II, Hitler annexed his native Austria to Germany. Austria regained its independence a decade after the war ended and joined the EU in 1995.\n\nAustria is a German-speaking country, and nearly the entire population self-identifies as ethnic Austrian. The Turks are the largest single immigrant group in Austria, closely followed by the Serbs.\n\nAustria is predominantly Roman Catholic and was home to many monasteries in the Middle Ages, influencing a strong Austrian literary tradition. Austria’s best-known cities are its capital of Vienna and Salzburg and Innsbruck.\n\nVienna was the center of the Habsburg and Austrian Empires and earned a place as one of the world’s great cities. It is famed for its baroque architecture; its music, particularly waltzes; and theater. The Habsburgs were great patrons of the arts, and hence music, drama, and art thrived for centuries in Austria. The country has been home to many famous composers and musicians and is the setting for the story behind the movie The Sound of Music. Austria has a worldwide reputation in music and the arts. Some famous composers associated with Austria are:\n\nJoseph Haydn\n\nFranz Liszt\n\nFranz Schubert\n\nJohann Strauss\n\nMozart (He spent much of his career in the Austrian captial of Vienna.)\n\nTraditional clothing of Austria includes:\n\nAustria is a beautiful place, as you can see via this video:\n\nSome Austrian foods are:\n\nLiechtenstein is a German-speaking microstate tucked in between Switzerland and Austria. It is Europe’s fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometers (62 square miles) and a population of about 38,557.\n\nThe entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the Rhine River.\n\nLiechtenstein used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies and became one of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favorably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein’s much larger European neighbors. The country’s population enjoys one of the world’s highest standards of living.\n\nAccording to the Constitution of Liechtenstein, Catholicism is its official state religion:\n\nThe Catholic Church is the State Church and as such shall enjoy the full protection of the State— Constitution of Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein offers protection to adherents of all religions and considers the “religious interests of the people” a priority of the government. In Liechtenstein schools, although exceptions are allowed, religious education in Roman Catholicism or Protestantism (either Reformed or Lutheran, or both) is legally required.\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is one of the few countries in the world that maintain no military.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n✎ Switzerland and Austria are dominated by the Alpine ranges.\n\n✎ Switzerland is well known for its political neutrality.\n\n✎ Austria was tightly associated with its ruling dynasty, the Habsburgs.\n\n✎ Austria has a worldwide reputation in music and the arts.\n\n✎ Liechtenstein is a German-speaking microstate tucked in between Switzerland and Austria. It enjoys one of the world’s highest standards of living.\n\nNext: Germany & France\n\nWe want to know what you thought of what you just read and watched! Leave us a comment!
