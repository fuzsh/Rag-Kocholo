        "text": "Liechtenstein has been a vocal advocate against the use of explosive weapons in populated areas (EWIPA). It has acknowledged the harm caused by the use of EWIPA and committed to action on the issue.\n\nStatements\n\nLiechtenstein issued statements on EWIPA during UN Security Council Open Debates on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict in 2010.[1] In August 2013, Liechtenstein called on all parties in conflict to strictly respect the principles of distinction and proportionality and avoid the use of explosive force in densely populated areas.[2]\n\nAt the UN General Assembly First Committee General Debate in October 2016, Liechtenstein stated that “The humanitarian impact of these weapons is of great concern to us. It is for this reason that Liechtenstein committed itself at the World Humanitarian Summit to promote and enhance the protection of civilians and civilian objects by working to prevent civilian harm resulting from the use of these explosive weapons in populated areas. Liechtenstein also strongly supports the Secretary General’s call upon parties to conflicts to refrain from using these weapons and to elaborate a political commitment to this effect.”[3]\n\nLiechtenstein also participated at the ECOSOC Humanitarian Affairs segment in June 2016, where it called on all parties to conflicts to refrain from using EWIPA.[4]\n\nLiechtenstein has signed onto numerous joint statements condemning EWIPA use, including the following:\n\nAs a member of the European Union (EU) at the UN Security Council Open Debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (2011)[5]\n\nAs a member of the EU at the UN Security Council Open Debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (2012)[6]\n\nAs a member of the Group of Friends on the Protection of Civilians (2012)[7]\n\nAs a member of the EU at the UN Security Council Open Debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict (2013)[8]\n\nThe Joint Commitment 123002 to the World Humanitarian Summit led by Austria, with Costa Rica, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Mexico, Mozambique, Spain, and Zambia (2016)[9]\n\nThe EU statement at the 72nd UN General Assembly First Committee Conventional Weapons Debate (2017)[10]\n\nThe EU statement at the UN Security Council Open Debate War in Cities: Protection of Civilians in Urban Settings (2022).[11]\n\nIt also aligned with the World Humanitarian Summit Core Commitments to ‘Uphold the Norms that Safeguard Humanity’ in May 2016. This included the commitment: “to promote and enhance the protection of civilians and civilian objects, especially in the conduct of hostilities, for instance by working to prevent civilian harm resulting from the use of wide-area explosive weapons in populated areas, and by sparing civilian infrastructure from military use in the conduct of military operations.”[12]\n\nLiechtenstein endorsed the joint statement on EWIPA during 73th UN General Assembly First Committee in October 2018. The statement, delivered by Ireland, called attention to the devastating and long-lasting humanitarian impact of the use of EWIPA and urging states to reverse the trend of high levels of civilian harm.[13] Liechtenstein also endorsed the joint statement on EWIPA during the 74th UN General Assembly First Committee in October 2019.[14] The statement, also delivered by Ireland, encouraged states to participate in international efforts to address the impacts of the use of EWIPA on civilians, including by working towards the creation of an international political declaration on this issue.[15]\n\nLiechtenstein participated in the Conference on the Protection of Civilians in Urban Warfare in October 2019 in Vienna.[16]\n\nAt the UN Security Council Open Debate War in Cities: Protection of Civilians in Urban Settings on 25 January 2022, the Group of Friends of the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict, of which Liechtenstein is a member, called on states to enhance the protection of civilians, including from the use of EWIPA, and took note of the ongoing consultations to develop a political declaration on this subject.[17]\n\n[1] Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations (2010). ‘Open Debate on the Protection of Civilians During Armed Conflict Statement’. http://www.peacewomen.org/sites/default/files/lie_poc_nov2010_0.pdf.\n\n[2] INEW (2013). ‘UN Security Council’s Protection of Civilians’ Debate Raises Concerns over Explosive Weapons’. https://www.inew.org/un-security-councils-protection-of-civilians-debate-raises-concerns-over-explosive-weapons/.\n\n[3] Permanent Mission of Liechtenstein to the United Nations, ‘UNGA71 First Committee General Debate.
