        "text": "EEA & Relations with the EU\n\nThe Agreement on the European Economic Area brings together the EU Member States and the three EEA EFTA States – Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway – into one Single Market, also referred to as the Internal Market.\n\nTrade relations\n\nEFTA has an extensive worldwide network of free trade relations. Its third-country policy aims to safeguard the economic interests of its Member States, support and reinforce European and interregional integration, and contribute to global efforts to liberalise trade and investment.\n\nStatistical Cooperation\n\nStatistics play a fundamental role in planning, developing and monitoring the economic, social and environmental aspects of the European Single Market. The EFTA Statistical Office (ESO) is the liaison office between the EFTA National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) and Eurostat – the statistical office of the European Union. Cooperation between the EFTA NSIs, Eurostat and ESO, particularly in the context of the EEA Agreement, and technical cooperation with partner countries outside the European Statistical System remain the two main areas of ESO’s activities.\n\nThe EU Member States, together with three of the EFTA States - Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway - make up the EEA Contracting Parties (the EEA States). In everyday language, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway go by the term “EEA EFTA States” in order to clarify that the other EFTA State, Switzerland, is not party to the EEA Agreement. However, in the EEA Agreement and the legal texts linked to it (e.g. Joint Committee Decisions) the term “EFTA States” refers to the three EEA EFTA States and is understood to exclude Switzerland."
