Image Location: Prince's Palace, Monaco\n\nThe smallest countries in Europe: need to know\n\nWhy are European countries so small?\n\nEurope’s puzzle of tiny countries stems from a complex history of feudal territories, royal families, and shifting borders. Played Tetris? Well, it’s a similar story here, only every piece ended up being its own little nation.\n\nWhat are the top 5 smallest countries in Europe?\n\nVatican City: 0.189 mi²\n\nMonaco: 0.772 mi²\n\nSan Marino: 23.55 mi²\n\nLiechtenstein: 61.78 mi²\n\nMalta: 122.01 mi²\n\nWhat is the smallest country in Europe?\n\nVatican City takes the cake (or should we say the cupcake?) as the smallest country in Europe, with an area of only 0.189 mi². It’s about one-eighth the size of Central Park in New York City!\n\nRelated: the best things to do in Vatican City\n\nImage Credit: Getty Images, OlyaSolodenko. Image Location: Vaduz, Liechtenstein\n\nWhat is a small landlocked country in Central Europe?\n\nSay hello to Liechtenstein, a pint-sized powerhouse in Central Europe. But don’t let its size fool you: this country, hidden between Switzerland and Austria, is big on charm.\n\nWhich is the richest country in Europe?\n\nWhen it comes to wealth, Luxembourg sits atop Europe’s financial throne with a GDP per capita of $142,490, making it the continent’s richest country​​.\n\nWhich of the smallest European countries don’t have railway systems?\n\nSome of Europe’s tiniest countries like Andorra, Liechtenstein, and San Marino don’t have their own railway systems. Andorra, tucked between France and Spain, uses buses that connect to France’s closest train station. Liechtenstein, despite its small size, has a well-developed road network and bus services connecting to neighboring countries’ train stations. And San Marino, known as one of the world’s oldest republics, also gets by just fine without trains. It relies on its network of automobile roads.\n\nAs you explore Europe’s smallest countries, you’ll see for yourself that each one has a story that’s much bigger than its size suggests.\n\nHeader Image Credit: Getty Images, © Allard Schager.
