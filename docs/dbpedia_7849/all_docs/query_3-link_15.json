In addition, international organizations allow for Liechtenstein to have a voice in the global arena.\n\nLiechtenstein prides itself on its engagement with the international community. Over the years Liechtenstein has placed special emphasis on becoming active in international humanitarian cooperation and human rights with a focus on the rights of women, rights of children, fight against torture and the fight against arms and land mines.\n\nLiechtenstein also places great importance on issues dealing with environment and sustainable development having fully ratified the Kyoto Protocol in 2004.
