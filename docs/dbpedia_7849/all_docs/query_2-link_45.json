        "text": "Economic History - From Agricultural Roots to Export-Oriented Manufacturing Sector and a Financial Center\n\nFor centuries, Liechtenstein was a relatively isolated country reliant on its small agricultural sector and some textile production to support its economy. However, following World War II, Liechtenstein redefined itself from an almost exclusively agricultural state into a highly modernized, export-oriented industrial society with manufacturing as its leading sector.\n\nOver the past 75 years, many Liechtenstein businesses have grown to become leaders in their respective fields. This was accomplished through very little government support as no economic sectors other than agriculture receive government subsidies in Liechtenstein.\n\nSince 1923, Liechtenstein has also shared economic integration through a customs union with Switzerland. In addition, Liechtenstein's economy has been greatly enhanced by its regional and global integration through memberships to multilateral organizations such as the European Free Trade Associations (EFTA), European Economic Area (EEA), as well as the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nIndustry\n\nLiechtenstein may be known around the world mostly as a financial center, but the largest contributor to its economy is manufacturing. Industry (manufacturing and construction) accounts for 40.4% of the gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nThe largest branches in Liechtenstein's strongly export-oriented industrial sector are machine and tool engineering, plant construction, precision instruments, and the dental and food sectors. In all these areas, companies are less interested in manufacturing mass-market and cheap products and have focused more on producing high-tech products of the highest quality.\n\nIn the US, Liechtenstein companies provide approximately 6300 jobs. Against Liechtenstein's population of 40,000, this is a significant number, which continues to grow.\n\n·The US is Liechtenstein’s largest overseas trading partner.\n\n·Liechtenstein annually exports goods worth over half a billion dollars to the US.\n\n·Liechtenstein’s foreign direct investments (FDI) in the US amounts to over half a billion dollars.\n\n·12 Liechtenstein companies provide roughly 6300 jobs in the US. Against its population of roughly 40,000 this is a significant number – roughly 15% of its population.\n\nLiechtenstein companies play key roles in the supply chain of goods in specific US sectors such as construction, automotive, dentistry, agriculture, audio-visual and coating:\n\nDid you know that steering components found in Chryslers, Fords and Teslas produced in the US are made by the Liechtenstein company ThyssenKrupp Presta with operations in Terre Haute, IN and Danville, IL?\n\nFounded in 1941 in Schaan, Liechtenstein, HILTI is a global industry leader in the manufacturing of precision tools. The company’s tools are used commercially and privately throughout the U.S., with its North American headquarters based in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIvoclar Vivadent, with operations in Amherst, NY, is one of the top global producers of dental products many of which are used by dentists across America.\n\nMany of the microphones and audio devices used by the United States Congress, top musicians and businesses consist of components manufactured by the Liechtenstein company Neutrik.\n\nGeneral Services\n\nFollowing manufacturing, 38.3% of the Liechtenstein economy consists of general services. This sector includes tourism, real estate, information technology, cleaning and repair services, and retail to name just a few. The largest private employers are services for brick and mortar companies, real estate companies, and information technology companies. The sector also includes services provided by the State of Liechtenstein, including the National Administration and Liechtenstein's municipalities, with jobs primarily in education, healthcare, social services and public administration.\n\nFinancial Services\n\nAlthough not the largest economic sector, financial services, which includes insurance, legal and accounting activities, play an important role in Liechtenstein’s national economy, accounting for 21.3% of the nation’s GDP.\n\nLiechtenstein's financial center specializes in particular in private asset management, international asset structuring, investment funds, and insurance solutions.\n\nThe last 25 years have been a particularly dynamic period for the Liechtenstein financial center. New fields of business have opened up in the funds and insurance sectors. The accession to the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1995 acted as a catalyst for a series of fundamental changes and made access to the markets of other countries possible.\n\nHowever, this fast growth in the 1990's – not only in Liechtenstein, but in the financial services sector worldwide – also increased the risk of abuses. Liechtenstein reacted to this risk with a new Law on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, stricter due diligence provisions, and a massive staff expansion of the supervisory authorities, the National Police, and the courts. These efforts of the State and of the financial service providers in implementing the new provisions were subsequently positively recognized by international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund in Washington, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris and the Moneyval committee of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg.\n\nClick here to learn more about Liechtenstein's international cooperation in tax matters.\n\nLiechtenstein as a Domestic and Global Job Provider\n\nDid you know that Liechtenstein companies employ more people than its total population of roughly 40,000 and that the vast majority of these jobs are in its manufacturing sector?\n\nWithin the borders of Liechtenstein the economy offers 42,514 jobs (2022) with over half of the workforce commuting into Liechtenstein daily from Switzerland, Austria and Germany. Globally, Liechtenstein offers over 40,000 jobs with roughly 6300 of these positions in the United States. In total, Liechtenstein companies employ over 80,000 people domestically and globally.\n\nUntil the 19th century, Liechtenstein's economy could only support around 8,000 citizens, which led to large waves of emigration primarily to the New World. This trend, however, reversed itself in the 1950s once Liechtenstein's economy began to modernize.\n\nEmployers in Liechtenstein benefit not only from its central location within Europe, but also from access to highly educated professionals. This combination makes Liechtenstein a strong site for businesses."
