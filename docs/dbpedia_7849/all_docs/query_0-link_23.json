        "text": "To import live animals or animal products from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein into Great Britain, you’ll need to:\n\nfind the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM) risk category for the commodity you’re importing\n\nfollow the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules for that import risk category\n\nThe BTOM categorises live animals, germinal products, products of animal origin (POAO) and animal by-products (ABPs) as high risk, medium risk or low risk. Each category has different requirements.\n\nHow to find the BTOM risk category for animals and animal products\n\nYou can use the 2 documents on this page to help you find the risk category for a commodity you’re importing.\n\n1. BTOM risk categories: summary tables\n\nUse the summary tables to find out about BTOM risk categories for imports of live animals, POAO and ABPs from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to Great Britain.\n\nThe tables give a summary of how different types of animals and animal products will be categorised. They do not provide the risk categories for specific commodity codes - for that, you will need to use the searchable list with commodity codes (see below).\n\n2. BTOM risk categories: searchable list with commodity codes\n\nUse the spreadsheet on this page (‘Import risk categories for animal and animal product imports from the EU to Great Britain: searchable list with commodity codes’) to find the risk category for a specific commodity you’re importing. You can search using a commodity code or browse a list of commodities.\n\nThe list includes live animals and POAO. It does not include all ABPs and composite products. (See next section if you can’t find the risk category for your commodity.)\n\nWhat to do if you can’t find your commodity risk category\n\nIf the list does not give the risk category for the commodity you’re importing, or indicates that it could be either medium or low risk, refer to the summary tables for more information about how that type of commodity will be categorised.\n\nRisk factors will be reviewed regularly. Commodities may be moved into higher or lower BTOM risk categories in future to reflect changing levels of risk.\n\nYou’ll be notified in advance if there is a change to the BTOM risk category of a commodity you have imported.\n\nComposite products\n\nAll composite products from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are either:\n\nin the low BTOM risk category\n\nnot placed in a BTOM risk category because it is exempt from official import controls\n\nSome composite products may become medium risk following future risk assessments.\n\nFind out if your product is a composite, and if it is exempt from import controls.\n\nRules for each BTOM risk category\n\nThere are 3 BTOM risk categories:\n\nlow risk\n\nmedium risk\n\nhigh risk\n\nIf your consignment is in the low BTOM risk category\n\nUse the import of products, animals, food and feed system (IPAFFS) to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYou will need the IPAFFS commodity code, rather than the Trade Tariff commodity code, to enter your details into IPAFFS. You can get the IPAFFS code from the spreadsheet on this page (‘BTOM risk categories for animal and animal product imports from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to Great Britain: searchable list with commodity codes’).\n\nYou do not need a health certificate.\n\nLow BTOM risk category consignments must come with a commercial document from the supplier.\n\nLow risk consignments will not be subject to routine documentary, identity and physical checks. However, checks may still be undertaken where intelligence indicates a specific risk.\n\nYour goods must enter Great Britain through a point of entry with a border control post (BCP) that is designated to check your commodity.\n\nFor EU goods entering Great Britain through west coast ports, there will be a different implementation date for intelligence-led checks and for the requirement to enter through a port with a BCP. There is more detail in the Border Target Operating Model.\n\nIf your consignment is in the medium BTOM risk category\n\nUse IPAFFS to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYou will need the IPAFFS commodity code, rather than the Trade Tariff commodity code, to enter your details into IPAFFS. You can get the IPAFFS code from the spreadsheet on this page (‘BTOM risk categories for animal and animal product imports from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to Great Britain: searchable list with commodity codes’).\n\nYour consignment must have a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country where the goods originate.\n\nProducts in the medium BTOM risk category:\n\nwill need to enter Great Britain through a point of entry with a BCP that is designated to check them\n\nmay be subject to documentary, identity and physical import checks\n\nFor EU goods entering Great Britain through west coast ports, there will be a different implementation date for identity and physical checks and for the requirement to enter through a port with a BCP. There is more detail in the Border Target Operating Model.\n\nIf your consignment is in the high BTOM risk category\n\nUse IPAFFS to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYou will need the IPAFFS commodity code, rather than the Trade Tariff commodity code, to enter your details into IPAFFS. You can get the IPAFFS code from the spreadsheet on this page (‘BTOM risk categories for animal and animal product imports from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein to Great Britain: searchable list with commodity codes’).\n\nYour consignment must have a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country where the goods originate.\n\nConsignments in the high BTOM risk category are subject to physical import checks and identity checks.\n\nIf your consignment is in the medium or high BTOM risk categories, but there is no health certificate for your goods\n\nIf a health certificate does not exist for the goods you want to import from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, you may need an import licence or authorisation.\n\nContact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Animal Imports team if:\n\nthere’s no licence for your animal or germinal product\n\nyou’re not sure if you need a licence\n\nIf you are importing a medium-risk ABP, but there’s currently no health certificate for your goods, you will require a commercial document.\n\nInspection rates of imported goods\n\nSome imports are subject to identity (ID) checks and physical checks. The percentage of times identity and physical checks happen (the inspection rate) depends on the risk category of the commodity being imported:\n\nhigh risk commodities are inspected every time the commodity is imported (inspection rate 100%)\n\nmedium risk commodities are inspected 1% to 30% of the time the commodity is imported - the specific inspection rate (M1, M2 or M3) depends on the commodity and country\n\nlow risk commodities are not subject to routine inspection, but may be subject to non-routine or intelligence-led checks\n\nThese rules, as set out in the UK Official Controls Regulations (EU) 2017/625 and Regulation (EU) 2019/2129, are applicable to EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries.\n\nRisk levels\n\nRisk categorisation is a dynamic process drawing on the most current data and reflecting changes in:\n\ndisease status\n\nanimal and public health hazard analysis\n\ncompliance history\n\ndata associated with disease outbreak in the exporting country\n\ntransmission data\n\nrisk mitigation treatments and restrictions\n\ncompliance data\n\nThese factors underpin risk categorisation and inspection rates (the percentage of time identity checks and physical checks will take place). Taking these factors into account, the following 3 risk levels have been introduced for medium risk commodities:\n\nM1: consequence of non-compliance with import conditions is likely to be manageable or acceptable (baseline inspection rate 1%)\n\nM2: consequences of non-compliance with import conditions, including any of the factors mentioned above, could pose a significant risk to public or animal health (baseline inspection rate between 10% and 15%)\n\nM3: consequence of non-compliance with import conditions is likely to pose a significant risk to biosecurity or public health (baseline inspection rate 30%)\n\nThe frequency rates of identity checks and physical checks will be determined by ministers in Great Britain and agreed by the Animal Disease Policy Group (ADPG). The frequency rates will be determined taking into account a range of factors including:\n\nrisks to human, animal or plant health, animal welfare or the environment, associated with different types of animals and goods\n\ninformation collected by the competent authorities\n\nthe controls already performed on the animals or goods\n\nhistory of compliance (including of the operator and exporter)\n\ndata and information collected by computer management system\n\navailable scientific assessments\n\nany other information regarding the risk associated to the categories of animals and goods\n\nThe frequency rates of identity checks and physical checks may change in response to local risk factors and factors specified in the Official Controls Regulation.\n\nImports from the Faroe Islands and Greenland\n\nThe BTOM risk categories for the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein will also apply to the Faroe Islands and Greenland.\n\nThe Faroe Islands and Greenland follow EU SPS rules for certain commodities, such as fishery products. Imports of these commodities into Great Britain from the Faroe Islands and Greenland will follow the same process as imports from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\n\nOther imports from the Faroe Islands and Greenland will continue to follow import rules for non-EU countries.\n\nGet help"
