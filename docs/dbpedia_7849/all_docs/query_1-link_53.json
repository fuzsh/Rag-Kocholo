        "text": "2.3K Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nLiechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy, currently headed by Hans-Adam II (known as Prince Regnant of Liechtenstein). It is the only remaining European monarchy that practices strict agnatic primogeniture, meaning only first-born males may inherit the throne.\n\nLiechtenstein is a country with almost no crime and a capital city of just over 5,000 residents.\n\nWhile the princes of Liechtenstein originally purchased the land of the entire country, the first prince to actually reside in this principality (the country of Liechtenstein) was the father of the current prince, Franz Josef II. He moved here in 1938 when he ascended the throne after his father (Franz 1) died in Czechoslovakia in that year.\n\nLiechtenstein is mainly a mountainous country, making it a winter sports haven. The largest ski resorts of the Liechtenstein Alps offer a combined total of about 23 km of ski slopes. Probably the best ski resort is “Malbun” near the Austrian border.\n\nWhile the capital, Vaduz, has just over 5,000 residents, neighbouring Schaan has a larger population of about 6,000 souls.\n\nThe Principality of Liechtenstein is double-landlocked as it is totally surrounded by two landlocked countries Austria and Switzerland.\n\nOne of the smallest, and also one of the most picturesque capitals in Europe, Vaduz, offers several places of interest.\n\nBest of all, just wander around town and feel the beauty of Europe’s smallest capital. Check out the parliament building near the banks of the River Rhine in Peter-Kaiser-Platz, the historic Town Hall (Rathaus), and the neo-Gothic Vaduz Cathedral of St. Florin.\n\nLiechtenstein has two beautiful fairy tale medieval castles. In town is the 12th century Vaduz Castle (Schloss Vaduz) that is the current palace and official residence of the Prince of Liechtenstein.\n\nClose to the border with Switzerland on the southwest side is the Gutenberg Castle (Burg Gutenberg), perched high on a 70-metre hill above the village of Balzers.\n\nThe three other castles of Liechtenstein have seen better days, but their ruins are still worth visiting. These are the Castle of Neu-Schellenberg (Obere Burg), nearby Castle of Alt-Schellenberg (Untere Burg), and Schalun Castle (Burg Schalun).\n\nEnjoy the hiking and villages, such as Nendeln and Eschen, between visiting castles.\n\n☛ Read more: Europe’s 10 Lilliputian Countries\n\nGet to know your Liechtenstein"
