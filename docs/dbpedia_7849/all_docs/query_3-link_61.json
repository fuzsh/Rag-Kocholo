        "text": "Overview\n\nThe UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement concluded with the EU, ensures that UK firms in a variety of service sectors can continue to access the EU market, including as business travellers and cross-border services suppliers or investors, while being treated no less favourably than either EU businesses or competitors from third countries.\n\nWhile the Agreement sets out clear expectations of the treatment and level of access to each Party’s domestic market, there will still be some changes for businesses and service suppliers as a result of no longer operating under European Economic Area (EEA) regulation covering cross-border trade in services. These changes are different for each sector and differ in each member state of the EU.\n\nTrade regulations\n\nIf you’re a UK business or professional providing services or investing in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland, you’ll need to check the national regulations of the country you’re doing business in to understand how best to operate.\n\nSee the guides to providing services guides to each country for more information.\n\nTrade reservations\n\nTo sell or provide services to customers in the EU, you must follow local laws. If in doubt, you should get professional advice.\n\nReservations are part of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. They reserve the right of each party to keep or make new laws restricting investment, or the sale of services, in ways that would otherwise breach the rules in the agreement.\n\nCheck which reservations apply to the sale of services from the UK to the EU. This includes an interactive tool to find reservations that are already in place.\n\nVAT on sales of digital services\n\nTo use the UK’s VAT Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS) to declare sales of digital services to EU consumers, businesses need to register for MOSS in an EU member state.\n\nFind out more about paying VAT on sales of digital services.\n\nEstablishing and structuring your business\n\nIf you have a UK business, you might face restrictions on your ability to own, manage or direct a company registered in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\n\nYou should be prepared for:\n\nadditional requirements on the nationality or residency of senior managers or directors\n\nlimits on the amount of equity that can be held by non-nationals\n\nUK companies and limited liability partnerships that have their central administration or principal place of business in certain EU member states may no longer have their limited liability recognised.\n\nFind out more about structuring your business.\n\nSector-specific information\n\nIf you’re a UK citizen with questions about your legal position in any sector, you should:\n\nget professional advice\n\ncontact the government of the country where you own, manage or direct a company for more information\n\nAuditors\n\nYou may need to restructure the ownership and management of your audit firm if it is based in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\n\nFor audit firms established and approved in EEA countries under the EU Audit Directive, a majority of the ownership and management bodies must be ‘qualified persons’.\n\n‘Qualified persons’ do not include UK-qualified auditors or UK-registered firms. They must be EEA-qualified auditors and audit firms registered in the EEA.\n\nBusiness travel and entry requirements\n\nEntry requirements vary. UK business travellers and service providers may need a visa, work permit or other documentation. You should check the rules of the Member State(s) you are visiting to find out if you need to apply.\n\nCheck our travel to Europe for work guidance for detailed information on:\n\ntypes of visa and work permit routes available\n\nexemptions that may apply to you or the activity you plan to undertake\n\nFurther guidance on providing services in the EU, Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland is available.\n\nCheck which actions travellers visiting Europe need to take.\n\nSocial security payments for employees\n\nFind out if you need to pay National Insurance in the UK or social security contributions in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\n\nRecognition of professional qualifications\n\nThe UK and the EU have agreed a comprehensive free trade agreement. As part of this deal, authorities responsible for professional qualifications in the UK and EU member states can submit joint recommendations to the UK-EU Partnership Council for profession-specific arrangements.\n\nOnce approved, these mutual recognition arrangements would provide routes for UK professionals to have their qualifications recognised in the jurisdiction of an EU member state, and vice versa.\n\nYou need to have your UK professional qualification officially recognised if you want to work in a profession that is regulated in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. It needs to be recognised by the appropriate regulator for your profession in each country where you intend to work. You need to do this even if you’re providing temporary or occasional professional services.\n\nUntil mutual recognition agreements have been put in place, UK-qualified professionals should continue following GOV.UK advice on using their qualifications in an EU member state.\n\nIf you have not had your qualification recognised, check the European Commission’s Regulated Professions Database (REGPROF) to find out if your profession is regulated in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Then contact the relevant country to find out how to get your professional qualification recognised.\n\nProfessionals already working in EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein\n\nYou don’t have to do anything if your qualification has already been officially recognised by the relevant regulator in an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The regulator’s decision to recognise your qualification remains valid.\n\nStart working in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein\n\nCheck the European Commission’s Regulated Professions Database (REGPROF) to find out if your profession is regulated. Then contact the relevant country to find out how to get your professional qualification recognised.\n\nYou can find out more information about individual countries in the selling services country guides.\n\nLawyers and auditors\n\nThere are different rules if you’re a lawyer or an auditor.\n\nFind out what to do if you’re an auditor.\n\nFind out what to do if you’re a lawyer.\n\nYou can find out more information about individual countries in the selling services country guides.\n\nData transfer and GDPR\n\nOn 28 June 2021, the EU formally adopted ‘adequacy decisions’ for the UK, delivered through:\n\nArticle 45 of the GDPR\n\nArticle 36 of the Law Enforcement Directive\n\n‘Adequacy decisions’ allow for the ongoing free flow of personal data from the EU/EEA to the UK."
