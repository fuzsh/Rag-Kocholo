        "text": "Financial reporting framework in Liechtenstein\n\nAdoption of IFRSs in Europe effective in 2005\n\nIn June 2002, the European Union adopted an IAS Regulation requiring European companies listed in an EU securities market, including banks and insurance companies, to prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs starting with financial statements for financial year 2005 onwards. EU countries have the option to:\n\nRequire or permit IFRSs for unlisted companies.\n\nRequire or permit IFRSs in parent company (unconsolidated) financial statements.\n\nPermit companies whose only listed securities are debt securities to delay IFRS adoption until 2007.\n\nPermit companies that are listed on exchanges outside of the EU and that currently prepare their primary financial statements using a non-EU GAAP (in most cases this would be US GAAP) to delay IFRS adoption until 2007.\n\nThe European IAS regulation applies not only to the 27 EU Member States but also to the three members of the European Economic Area (EEA) - Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway -, as well as, for the time being, the United Kingdom.\n\nLiechtenstein is an EEA Member. Consequently, Liechtenstein companies listed in an EU/EEA securities market follow IFRSs since 2005.\n\nThe European Commission has adopted the following wording for use in the notes to the accounts and in the audit reports of companies subject to EU Regulation 1606/2002/EC (the 'IAS regulation'):\n\n\"in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU\" or\n\n\"in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU\".\n\nCompanies may also state, in a footnote, compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the IASB, if that is the case.\n\nIAS Plus in German"
