        "text": "Europe is the second-smallest continent. The name Europe , or Europa, is believed to be of Greek origin, as it is the name of a princess in Greek mythology. The name Europe may also come from combining the Greek roots eur- (wide) and -op (seeing) to form the phrase âwide-gazing.â\n\nEurope is often described as a âpeninsula of peninsulas .â A peninsula is a piece of land surrounded by water on three sides. Europe is a peninsula of the Eurasian super continent and is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian seas to the south.\n\nEurope âs main peninsulas are the Iberian, Italian, and Balkan, located in southern Europe , and the Scandinavian and Jutland, located in northern Europe . The link between these peninsulas has made Europe a dominant economic, social, and cultural force throughout recorded history.\n\nEurope âs physical geography, environment and resources, and human geography can be considered separately.\n\nToday, Europe is home to the citizens of Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), and Vatican City.\n\nCultural Geography\n\nEurope has a long history of human development and is considered the birthplace of Western Civilization. Today, this cultural wealth is used to solidify the European Community and is exported to the rest of the world as one of the continent âs greatest global assets.\n\nHistoric Cultures\n\nIndigenous cultures shaped, and were shaped by, the varied geography of Europe . Physical features, weather-related phenomena, and local resources had a deep impact on how historic European cultures prospered, interacted, and believed their world worked.\n\nThe geography and climate of the Mediterranean region, for example, directly influenced Greek mythology . Most Greek gods and goddesses are representations of the active physical elements that made up the local landscape. The volcanoes of Lemnos, an island in the Mediterranean, and Mount Etna, on the island of Sicily, were believed to be the forges of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire. Ancient Greeks also believed reigning gods imprisoned lesser gods underneath the volcanoes. A volcanoâs violent nature thus came from the work of Hephaestus and the anger of the imprisoned gods.\n\nThe ancient Greeksâ connection to the sea also deeply influenced their mythological beliefs. Greeceâs many earthquakes, and the tsunamis they caused, were connected to the sea god Poseidon, known as the âEarth Shaker.â Cults and temples centered on Poseidon were built throughout the Aegean and Mediterranean seas as a means of appeasing the god.\n\nAs maritime trade and exploration developed in the region, winds and currents connected to Poseidon became important in Greek mythology . The gods could both reward and punish travelers and traders with favorable or unfavorable sea conditions. This is a main theme of The Odyssey, an epic poem written by Homer, in which these key elements of the sea both help and hurt the hero.\n\nOther cultures developed around the unique resources at their disposal. The Sami culture of Scandinavia , for example, was deeply connected to the indigenous reindeer herds of the Arctic. The Sami followed and cared for these herds during their grazing cycle. During the harsh winter, the Sami ate all parts of the animal. They created clothing and tents out of reindeer hides, sewing together the cloth with twine made from the animalâs tendons.\n\nKeeping track of herds and individual animals became increasingly important in Sami life. In order to distinguish herds, families and communities developed a pattern of cuts and notches on the animalsâ ears.\n\nReindeer were also the Samiâs main method of transporting goods during their nomadic journeys. These journeys varied in length, depending on the migration patterns of specific reindeer herds. Some reindeer herds have a home range of up to 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles).\n\nReindeer herding is still an important aspect of Sami culture, which continues to thrive in northern Scandinavia and Russiaâs Kola Peninsula .\n\nDistinct physical features had a lasting impact on how European cultures communicated with each other. With its central European location but geographic remoteness, the Alps region developed into a unique crossroads for Europe âs dominant languages, and a refuge for its archaic languages. This linguistic diversity is present in the Alpine regions of many contemporary European countries today.\n\nSwitzerland, for example, has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansch. During the Middle Ages, dominant European powers conquered the strategically important mountain territory of the Alps. Around 400 CE, the Alemanni, a Germanic tribe, invaded present-day northern Switzerland. Today, this is the German-speaking region of the country.\n\nAround this same time, Roman conquerors took over present-day southern Switzerland. Latin, the language of Rome, evolved into French in the western region, and Italian in the south. Because of their remoteness, however, all these regions have distinct dialects that differ slightly from their parent language. Swiss-Italian is distinguishable from Italian.\n\nRomansch, an endangered language, is also derived from Latin . Fewer than a million people are fluent in Romansch. The language survives in Switzerland because of the remote location of its native speakers.\n\nContemporary Cultures\n\nEurope âs rich and diverse cultural heritage continues to flourish today. With such a large number of nationalities compacted into such a small area, Europe strongly supports individual cultural identities and products.\n\nThe European Capitals of Culture program, started in 1985, has become one of Europe âs most important and high-profile cultural events. The goals of the program are local, regional, and global. The program highlights Europe âs rich cultural diversity, celebrates its cultural ties, and brings people of different European backgrounds together. The program has provided a lasting economic boost to cities and regions, raised their international profiles, and enhanced their images in the eyes of their own inhabitants.\n\nEach year, two or three cities are chosen to produce a year-long program of cultural events. This program must not only highlight the cityâs unique cultural heritage, but also feature new events that unite a range of cultural practices from across Europe . All of the events must come together under a common theme or themes. One Capital of Culture of 2011, Turku, Finland, focused on cultureâs positive influence on health and well-being. Many of its events encouraged community involvement and civic engagement. Projects are meant to stay a part of the city after 2011âsome pieces of sculpture may be used for athletics, for instance. Turku officials hope to inspire other European countries to undertake similar projects.\n\nEurope also strengthens ties between its diverse peoples and cultures by supporting multilingual education. The European Union has 23 official languages, and the continent has more than 60 indigenous languages. Flourishing immigrant communities are bringing in new languages to the continent , including Arabic, Hindi, and Mandarin.\n\nA 2006 European study showed that 53 percent of respondents could speak a second language, while 28 percent could speak two fo reign languages. The study also showed that only 8 percent of respondents considered language-learning unimportant.\n\nThe European Union has adopted a multilingual language policy with the goal that everyone should be able to speak at least two languages in addition to their own. By supporting this policy, the European Union hopes it will strengthen social, educational, professional, and economic ties in Europe and make the continent more competitive in global markets.\n\nEurope âs cultural products also help unify the region. Certain countries and regions have even developed an identity or âbrandingâ focused on specific products and exports.\n\nScandinavian design, for instance, is primarily focused on fashion and home wares. It is characterized by simple, minimalist design and low-cost mass production. Important Scandinavian companies focused on designed products include Electrolux, which makes home electronics, and Ikea and H&M, famous around the world for inexpensive but well-designed home furnishings and clothing, respectively.\n\nItalian fashion is also an important cultural export. The city of Milan is regarded as a major fashion capital, hosting an international fashion week twice a year. The city is home to the headquarters of luxury brands such as Valentino, Gucci, Versace, and Prada. Milan is also home to important European fashion magazines, such as Grazia, Vogue Italia, and Vera.\n\nGerman automotive design has a global reputation for excellence and prestige. Automobile companies such as BMW, Mercedes, and Audi are known throughout the world for creating cars with dynamic designs and an engaging driving experience. The country is also home to a number of outstanding schools for automotive design, such as the Hochschule Esslingen and Hochschule Pforzheim.\n\nPolitical Geography\n\nEurope âs long history and economic progress have been shaped by its political geography . Political geography is the internal and external relationships between governments, citizens, and territories. Early Europeans , in fact, shaped global ideas of citizenship and government . These ideas have been tested during times of peace and military conflict, and continue to be redefined today.\n\nHistoric Issues\n\nEurope âs early political history can be traced back to ancient Greece and Rome, both of which profoundly affected how Western civilizations govern their territories and citizens.\n\nDescribed as the birthplace of democracy, ancient Greece revolved around the polis, or city-state. City-states were unique in that they were governed not by a hereditary ruler, but by a political body that represented its citizens. This idea of citizenshipâof being connected to and having a voice in your communityâbecame the basic building block of democracy . The word â democracy â has Greek roots: demos-, meaning âpeople,â and -kratos, meaning âpower.â Prominent Greek philosophers, such as Socrates and Plato, discussed democratic ideals in their writings. Philosophers and politicians have used these writings to uphold and defend the democratic tradition ever since.\n\nRoman civilization had a major influence on Western concepts of law, government , and the military. At its largest, Rome controlled approximately 6.5 million square kilometers (2.5 million square miles) of land.\n\nThe Roman approach to conquering and controlling territory is often considered to be the basis of Western imperialism. Imperialism is a policy of extending a nationâs power and influence through diplomacy or military force. Imperialism is a policy that has been used throughout history, most notably by European powers and the United States. Other political institutions of Rome persist throughout Europe and former European colonies. Some of these concepts include the idea of an elected Senate and the stationing of military troops outside a countryâs home region.\n\nWorld War I and World War II dramatically affected the political geography of Europe . World War I (1914-1918) left about 16 million people dead. The Central Powers (led by the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire) fell to the forces of the Allied Powers (led by the United Kingdom, France, and the Russian Empire). By the end of the war, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires collapsed and broke into a dozen separate nations. Borders between existing nations, such as Poland and Russia, were entirely redrawn.\n\nWorld War II (1939-1945) left about 43 million Europeans dead, including about 6 million who died in the Holocaust. The Holocaust was the mass murder of Jews under the Nazi regime. World War II also left more than 40 million refugees, contributed to the independence of European colonies throughout the world, and devastated the urban infrastructure of many European cities.\n\nAs a result of the devastation of World War II, Western Europe âs leadership in global politics diminished. The United States began to lead the Western world, while the Soviet Union, with its capital in the Eastern European city of Moscow, Russia, led the so-called Eastern Bloc. The relationship between the United States, with a free-market economy, and the Soviet Union , with a communist economy, was known as the Cold War.\n\nThe âIron Curtainâ represents Europe âs political geography during the Cold War. The Iron Curtain was an ideological boundary that divided Europe into two blocsâWestern countries influenced by the United States, and Eastern countries influenced by the Soviet Union . International economic and military organizations developed on either side of the Iron Curtain. The United States and the Soviet Union built up huge nuclear arsenals, with many missiles aimed at targets throughout Europe ."
