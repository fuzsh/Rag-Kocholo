        "text": "To import live animals or animal products from non-EU countries into Great Britain, you need to:\n\nfind the Border Target Operating Model (BTOM) risk category for the commodity you’re importing\n\nfollow the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) rules for that import risk category\n\nThe BTOM categorises live animals, germinal products, products of animal origin (POAO) and animal by-products (ABPs) as high risk, medium risk or low risk. Each category has different requirements.\n\nPermitted countries\n\nExporting countries need approval to send animals and animal products to Great Britain. This is also referred to as having ‘market access’. See details of non-EU countries approved to export animals and animal products to Great Britain.\n\nBTOM risk categories for non-EU countries only apply to countries that have been subject to a risk assessment. These are:\n\nArgentina\n\nAustralia\n\nBotswana\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nChile\n\nChina\n\nEcuador\n\nIndia\n\nIsrael\n\nJapan\n\nNamibia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNicaragua\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThailand\n\nTurkey\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited States\n\nUruguay\n\nVietnam\n\nIn the documents on this page (the summary tables and spreadsheet), the phrase ‘all permitted countries’ means all countries from this list that have been approved to export a particular animal or product to Great Britain.\n\nOther countries that have market access but have not been subject to a BTOM risk assessment will continue to follow existing import processes.\n\nHow to find the risk category for animals and animal products\n\nYou can use the 2 documents on this page to find the risk category for a commodity you’re importing.\n\nBTOM risk categories: summary tables for non-EU imports\n\nUse the summary tables for animal and animal product imports from non-EU countries to Great Britain to find out about BTOM risk categories for live animals, POAO and ABPs.\n\nThe tables give a summary of how different types of animals and animal products will be categorised. They do not provide the risk categories for specific commodity codes.\n\nBTOM risk categorisation spreadsheet for non-EU imports\n\nUse the BTOM risk categorisation spreadsheet (‘BTOM risk categories for live animals and animal products imported from non-EU countries to Great Britain: searchable list with commodity codes’) to find the risk category for a specific commodity you’re importing.\n\nYou can search using a commodity code or browse the list of commodities.\n\nComposite products\n\nAll composite products from permitted non-EU countries will be categorised as one of the following:\n\nin the medium risk category\n\nin the low risk category, if shelf stable at ambient temperature and sterilised\n\nnot placed in a risk category because it is exempt from official import controls\n\nFind out if your product is a composite, and if it is exempt from import controls.\n\nRules for each risk category\n\nThere are 3 BTOM risk categories:\n\nlow\n\nmedium\n\nhigh\n\nIf your consignment is in the BTOM low risk category\n\nUse the import of products, animals, food and feed system (IPAFFS) to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYou do not need a health certificate.\n\nYour goods must enter Great Britain through a point of entry with a border control post (BCP) that is designated to check your commodity.\n\nLow risk consignments are not subject to routine documentary, identity and physical checks. However, checks may still be undertaken where intelligence indicates a specific risk.\n\nLow risk category consignments must come with a commercial document from the supplier.\n\nIf your consignment is in the BTOM medium risk category\n\nUse IPAFFS to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYour consignment will need a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country where the goods originate.\n\nProducts in the medium risk category need to enter through a BCP and are subject to documentary, identity and physical import checks. This is explained in the section (‘Inspection rates of imported goods’).\n\nIf your consignment is in the high risk category\n\nUse IPAFFS to notify authorities before the goods arrive in Great Britain.\n\nYour consignment will need a health certificate issued by the competent authority in the country where the goods originate.\n\nMost consignments in the BTOM high risk category are subject to documentary, identity and physical import checks.\n\nIf your consignment is in the medium or high risk categories, but there is no health certificate for your goods\n\nIf a health certificate does not exist for the goods you want to import, you may need an import licence or authorisation.\n\nContact the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) Animal Imports team if:\n\nthere’s no licence or authorisation for your animal or germinal product\n\nyou’re not sure if you need a licence or authorisation\n\nInspection rates of imported goods\n\nSome imports are subject to identity (ID) checks and physical checks. The percentage of times identity and physical checks happen (the inspection rate) depends on the risk category of the commodity being imported:\n\nhigh risk commodities are inspected every time the commodity is imported (inspection rate 100%)\n\nmedium risk commodities are inspected 1% to 30% of the time the commodity is imported - the specific inspection rate (M1, M2 or M3) depends on the commodity and country\n\nlow risk commodities are not subject to routine inspection, but may be subject to non-routine or intelligence-led checks\n\nThese rules, as set out in the UK Official Controls Regulations (EU) 2017/625 and Regulation (EU) 2019/2129, are applicable to risk assessed countries under the BTOM.\n\nSome imports will be subject to checks in accordance with arrangements under the Windsor Framework agreement and the relevant Free Trade Agreements. BTOM inspection rates will not apply to these products:\n\nmeat and edible offal of sheep (fresh, chilled or frozen) from New Zealand\n\npet food and dog chews from all non-EU/European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries\n\nRisk levels\n\nRisk categorisation is a dynamic process drawing on the most current data and reflecting changes in:\n\ndisease status\n\nanimal and public health hazard analysis\n\ncompliance history\n\ndata associated with disease outbreak in the exporting country\n\ntransmission data\n\nrisk mitigation treatments and restrictions\n\ncompliance data\n\nThese factors underpin risk categorisation and inspection rates (the percentage of time identity checks and physical checks will take place). Taking these factors into account, the following 3 risk levels have been introduced for medium risk commodities:\n\nM1: consequence of non-compliance with import conditions is likely to be manageable or acceptable (baseline inspection rate 1%)\n\nM2: consequences of non-compliance with import conditions, including any of the factors mentioned above, could pose a significant risk to public or animal health (baseline inspection rate between 10% and 15%)\n\nM3: consequence of non-compliance with import conditions is likely to pose a significant risk to biosecurity or public health (baseline inspection rate 30%)\n\nThe frequency rates of identity checks and physical checks will be determined by ministers in Great Britain and agreed by the Animal Disease Policy Group (ADPG). The frequency rates will be determined taking into account a range of factors including:\n\nrisks to human, animal or plant health, animal welfare or the environment, associated with different types of animals and goods\n\ninformation collected by the competent authorities\n\nthe controls already performed on the animals or goods\n\nhistory of compliance (including of the operator and exporter)\n\ndata and information collected by computer management system\n\navailable scientific assessments\n\nany other information regarding the risk associated to the categories of animals and goods\n\nThe frequency rates of identity checks and physical checks may change in response to local risk factors and factors specified in the Official Controls Regulation.\n\nRisk factors will be reviewed regularly. Commodities may be moved into higher or lower risk categories in future to reflect changing levels of risk.\n\nYou’ll be notified in advance if there is a change to the risk category of a commodity you have imported.\n\nImport risk categories for products from EU countries\n\nCheck the import risk categories for imports of animals and animal products from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.\n\nImport risk categories for plants and plant products\n\nCheck the BTOM risk categories for plants and plant products imported from non-EU countries.\n\nGet help"
