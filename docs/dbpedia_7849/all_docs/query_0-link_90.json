A group of categories is called a “classification.” There can be more than one classification about the same topic and each one is different. You should choose the one that is the most suitable for your research and analysis.\n\nCountry of birth classification\n\nMnemonic: country_of_birth\n\nTotal number of categories: 279\n\nCode Name 000
