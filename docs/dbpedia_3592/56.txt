Biography

Private Andrew Henderson served with Mecklenburg County Regiment, North Carolina Militia during the American Revolution.

Andrew Henderson is a DAR Patriot Ancestor, A211684.

Andrew Henderson was born on 6 Apr 1753.[1] He was the son of Carnes Henderson and Elizabeth Robinson.[2] (Note that Andrew's first son was named "Carnes Harvey Henderson.")

He was a soldier of the American Revolution.[1] In 1780, he was drafted into service under Captain Joseph Graham in Colonel Francis Locke's regiment of Mecklenburg Militia for three months, and drafted again in 1781 for three months. His application for a pension was rejected because he could not prove service for six months.[3]

Around 1780, he married Elizabeth Robinson.[4][2] The children of Andrew and Elizabeth Henderson were:[2][5]

Mary (1784-1845), m. ___ Alexander

Carnes Harvey (1787-1845)

Griswell (1798-1881)

Jane B. (1801-1879), m. Burch Chesheir

The Hendersons lived in Mecklenburg, North Carolina. Andrew was there when he entered the militia service, and the census confirms he was there in 1790, 1800, 1810, and 1830.[6][7][8][9]

On 12 Aug 1835, he wrote his last will and testament, naming his wife Elizabeth and children Mary Alexander, David R. Henderson, Nancy Henderson, Margaret Henderson, Easabeth Henderson, Griswell Henderson, Jinny Chiswec, Harriet Alexander, and Carnes Harvey Henderson. He signed with his own signature.[5] The slaves bequeathed in the will are listed by name.

Andrew Henderson passed away on 6 Oct 1837 in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.[1] He was buried in Sugar Creek Presbyterian Church Cemetery, Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.[10] Probate records for his estate are dated 1838.[11]
