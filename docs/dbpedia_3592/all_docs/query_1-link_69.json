        "text": "Great Conewago Presbyterian Church marks 275 years\n\nPosted: Friday, July 24, 2015 12:06 am\n\nOn Sunday, July 26, the congregation of The Great Conewago Presbyterian Church will celebrate its rich history of 275 years. Tours of the historic church, chapel and its cemetery will be offered from 1 p.m. until 3 p.m. by members of the congregation and cemetery trustees. Worship Services are held at 10 a.m. each Sunday.\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, The Great Conewago Presbyterian Church, 174 Red Bridge Road Gettysburg, was established largely by Scotch-Irish settlers who first met about 1738. The exact date is uncertain. The earliest records were scant and later ones were destroyed by fire in 1864.\n\nYou must be logged in with the proper services to print this article.\n\nThe first printed mention of Great Conewago Church is in the 1740 minutes of Donegal Presbytery. Worship moved from private homes to a log structure located near the present day gate to the cemetery in 1743. Worshipers provided their own heat in this building with sheet iron foot warmers.\n\nFor several years after its organization Great Conewago depended on periodic supply ministers, the first of whom was the Rev. Samuel Caven in 1740, who simultaneously served Falling Spring Presbyterian Church in Chambersburg.\n\nUnder the guidance of The Rev. Joseph Henderson the present stone building was constructed in 1787. The circular stone above the front door identifies the name given the church at the time: Re. Joseph Henderson Meeting House, 1787.\"\n\nAfter the resignation of Rev. Henderson, the congregation spent several years without pastoral leadership until the call of the Rev. Dr. David McConaughey. He also served Upper Marsh Creek Presbyterian Church which is the present day Gettysburg Presbyterian Church. These two churches joined under the call of Rev. James Watson who served for 17 years. With his resignation the yoke between Great Conewago and Upper Marsh Creek dissolved.\n\nBeginning in 1998 until its completion in 2002, the sanctuary underwent a complete restoration which was proposed and guided by the Reverends William J. Murphy and Donald L. Mitchell. The Reverand Mitchell continued his pastorate until 2012. During his tenure the Education/Community Center was completed in 2008 and the 1887 chapel was completely restored."
