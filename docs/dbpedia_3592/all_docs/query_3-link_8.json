Lt Curtis Chase was killed in Vietnam and I am also Curtis Chase. I believe we went into the service at the same age of 23. My early military photo from then is similar and I find it quite interesting. I originally served in the Army and now am a flight nurse in the Air Force. I have been deployed 3 times since 2003. Thanks for the info and God Speed to all who have served and are currently serving. Capt Curtis Chase USAFemail- curtkel@gmail.com\n\nCurtis Chase -- Oil City PA USA -- 09/28/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2839. My uncle served and was injured while assigned to Co. H in the Korean War. His name and rank was PFC Alvin V. Peters and he served between 28 Nov 1951 - 27 Jul 1953. Unfortunately, Uncle Alvin passed away on May 26, 2007. He died from cancer which was not diagnosed until it had spread all over his body. I served in Korea in '92 and '93. Upon my return I was stationed at Fort Carson which is only an hour away from Pueblo which is where he lived. Our mutual service in Korea created a bond between us that I feel is very special even though I know that I was lucky not to have gone through the things he had. I will miss him very much. It would be nice to hear from anyone that may have served with him so please feel free to email me.\n\nShirley L. Armstrong -- Fort Riley KS USA -- 09/27/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2838.

Haven't visited in a while and couldn't attend reunion because of health issues. I'm here today to pay my respects to the Guys from C2/35 and their FO Roger Fulkerson who made the ultimate sacrifice on this day in 1968 at Duc-Lap. I spent the next several months with Charlie Company as their FO after replacing Roger. Roger was a brave man and a good Soldier, he was my Buddy and he is greatly missed. I came to know that C2/35 as a group were brave men and good Soldiers. Sadly a few stand out on these pages remembered because they're no longer here to enjoy the things we all hold so dear, our freedom and our families. My best wishes to the ones that are left and a reminder that we're still on duty for the ones that can't be here now, but were here and made it count!!\n\nDonald Blankin -- Blacksburg SC USA -- 09/25/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2836.

I told him that I would support him in all he wanted. This was a damn good NCO and I would go to bat for him. It's a shamed that we lost such a good man.

Member of Service Company, 35th Infantry, chauffeur for Regimental Commander, Col. Scott. I was 19 or 20 years old at the time. It was a pleasant, but maturing experience. I was later reassigned to the 12th Infantry Regiment in Arlington, Va from July 1940 to July 1941. Served as a Sgt. of motor pool. I reinlisted in the Army Air Force in 1943 and became a B-17 mechanic. From there to Kingman, Az and gunnery school and was sent to Foggia, Italy air base. I completed 48 missions as a Staff Sgt..

Glad someone has some physical evidence to what appeared more like a dream than reality. I was in A company of what I remember as Cacti Blue. Was that a seperat batallion of the 2nd of the 35th than Cacti Green or sumpin? Anyhow from September of 1969 to around November we were doing what appeared to be mainly long range reconisance for the batallion. We would go on long trips sitting down in a C-130 or long Helicopter rides and do cloverleaf sweeps. Sometimes we operated as platoons and sometimes as a Company with or without morters. After we made contact they would jerk us out and send in B company who would get the hell kicked out of them and we would go on another long trip. Sometimes short ones (Combat Assaults) with Cobra gun ships going in ahead shoting rockets into the LZ. We gaurded some helicopters at Bam Me Tuet ? while they invaded Cambodia or had some operation near the border I think. Had a Tiger sneak up on me on a Listening Post. He jumped us after we threw grenades around us. Got out of the field and worked in Division Safety office and looked back in records to find out 7 men were killed by Tigers in the 4th infantry division in 7 months. My Vet Center counselor said he didn't belive that and I told him I saw the Reports of Investigation on all of them. Was part of the 'move' to An Khe. Hong Kong mountain. What a drip. Dinks on the inside of the base which had to have a perimiter. Was on guard near Golf Course when about 9 Helicopters went up in Sapper attack. Sappers were actually the local guys working at the Fire Station on base and just walked off after the attack. What an absolute total waste. It took me two weeks to figure out that what we were doing was shall I say again, \"An absolute total waste\". And I told everyone I talked to just that. My lieutenant, whoever. Nixon, Kissenger, McNamara should have been shot. I have a video tape of Eisenhower saying that we had to protect Viet Nam because of the Titanium resources over there. Fifty Thousand plus dead so we could make our airplanes lighter. I guess the Golf industry is who is really suffering now. Shoot the Democrat political idiots also for not figureing that thing out. Yep, I'm bitter. Ed\n\nEd Bird -- Little Rock AR USA -- 08/12/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2807. Thanks to Dave Muxo for the scoop on this site. I was with Bravo Co; 1/35; 3rd Herd; 3rd Squad.

Thanks to the reunion committee, the officers and everyone else for making this year's reunion a great and memorable one. It was one of the best I've attended. My brother, who I brought as a guest, commented many times about how much he enjoyed it. He was very impressed with all the comradeship that was shown by the members of the association. The best thing for me was seeing Don Pananen who I hadn't seen in over 39 years. We served together in the C 2/35 mortars. Does anyone happen to know who the fellow was that spoke during open mic time about returning to VN? I am thinking about going over in Jan 08 and would like to speak with. Thanks.

I still don't have enough words to thanks the CACTI Association, for what they did for me an my fellows SSG Rivera and 1LT Gatlin in the last Cacti reunion @ Philly. We did enjoy every minutes of the Reunion. I personally got impressed with the organization and the timeliness of all the events. As a young Soldier from this unit (Bco 2-35th)I did not have and I will never have so many stories to share like you guys do, but I had a profound desire to listen to you old Nam Vets and to learn from the \"old schools\", and that's what I did. I brought home a significant quality of Real War Stories, Experiences and Glories to share with our new young Cacti Soldiers here in Hawaii. Thanks for making me feel that welcome.

I was with C Trp., 3/4 Cav. all during battle at Tan Phong in May 1967. We were called from LZ Liz, and the mortar crew on Liz lighted our way with flares on our drive to Tan Phong. I laid down 50 cal. fire just as my C.O. Capt. Ronald W. Penn was mortally wounded. He was 3 feet behind me. I didn't know he was hit until after the mortar fire. The VC had 5 rounds in the air before the first one hit. I turned around, after being pulled inside track, by my Ist Sgt. Landon (B or M)Pharris, and saw Capt. Penn sprawled on his back in the right rear of \"6\" track. I was \"6\" track driver and was on guard around 3 or 3:3o AM when we were mortared. Capt. Penn didn't regain consciousness as long as he was with us. A chopper came and delivered water and ammo, C-rations, took him, and we never saw him again. Our trp. heard he died 9 days later. Capt Penn was asleep, inside of \"6\" track, (awoke when the first mortar round hit)stood up in the observers hatch and said, \"who blew that claymore.\" I heard him say it. His last words in combat. Also KIA, that first day, at Tan Phong, on 20May67, was S/SGT. Lonnie Leo Smith, our trp plt. Sgt., of C-trp. 3/4 Cav. He was hit in head with a rocket. Several VC took over his track when it was abandoned by his crew. but those VC didn't survive either. So the actual KIA friendlies was 5 not 3, unless you are counting just the 35th KIA, which you have right. I have a picture of the helicopter that was shot down, with a Sky-raider flying over. In the same picture the infantry guys are in a rice paddy ditch for cover; and a strecher with a poncho covered body on it sits up in the paddy dirt. I carried the helicopter pilot in the back of my track to a secure LZ for Dust-off too. I heard the pilot had something wrong with one of his legs, but don't know that to be a fact. We took him on a stretcher however. I was a Sp/4 when at Tan Phong. Our trp. was usually at LZ Liz at night. Our base-camp at Duc Pho was all the way East as far as you could go.What memories we all have bottled-up inside us. TROPIC LIGHTENING\n\nSgt. James D.

The Cacti association put on a fantastic event, and it was my pleasure to see and be a part of such tremendous camaradrie and spirit from all the Cacti and the invited guest that attended. This was a very moving and at times, emotional for all. This also was my first time being at one of the Cacti Reunions and I will say it definitely will not be my last. For those fellow Cacti that couldn't make it, I know it's very hard for some but I just want you to know you were not forgotten. I want to give a special thanks to my brothers of B 1/35th that I proudly served with from December 1965 through January 1967 on my first tour in Vietnam.

I wanted to attend the Seattle and Scottsdale conventions but again, my health kept me home. I was with B Co. 1/35th from 8/68 to 8/69 and have been in touch with several of you in the past. I joineed the association several years ago, and last year took a life membership. I am suffering from TypeII diabetes with various complications incolding heart and kidney failure. VA gave me a disabliity rating based upon presumptive exposure to Agent Orange. Between VA and local doctors in Helena, I am receiving pretty good health care. I read Dave Muxo's recent entry in the guest book this morning and I remember that day well. I often think of McGinnis, LT. Williamson Sgt. Freitas and others we lost.

Not sure you are ready to talk about your experience or even think about it? I believe that being a part of this association can help you in this regard. Want to connect with buddies you served with many years ago? We can help you look for them. Maybe some of your old buddies will be at this year's reunion, waiting for you to show up after all these years. If not, we can help you find them. We have great resources and lots of help in this endeavor. If you served with the 35th Infantry Regiment, in peace time or war time, I encourage you to join us and share in a wonderful camaraderie. We are all brothers and look out for each other the same way we did while on patrol or on LP. There is still time to come to the Philly Reunion; directions on how to get there are on this web site. I know you will have a wonderful experience. Our reunion host, Joe Henderson, along with the Reunion Committee, has planned a great reunion in the \"City of Brotherly Love\". Welcome home brother.\n\nJohn Lorts -- Virginia Beach VA USA -- 07/22/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2787. Looking forward to seeing everyone at the reunion next week in my hometown.

My name is Michelle Salka (Broeders), and I am looking to find any pictures or any information on my great uncle, Leroy Broeders. He was KIA when he was only 19 years old, and I would really like to know about him, and maybe be able to give a picture of him to my grandfather (his brother)...I was just wondering if there is any way I can get in contact with anyone that could have possibly served with him, or knew him, or even get a hold of some pictures of his platoon or just him...thank you so much for any assistance. Just wanted to post an update: I am just writing to thank everyone out there for sparing your time and helping me to find information about my great uncle Leroy Broeders. It ended up working out perfectly, we found a picture of him and were able to make a little memorial board on black silk with the photo, the medals and all the memorials and other stuff that everyone ending up helping us to find. We also found a photo of the man who pulled my uncle off the field when he was killed, which we were able to put on the board too. This gift was given to my grandfather (Leroy's brother) just yesterday at a family function, words could not describe the surprise and emotion on his face, we couldnt beleive it, he cried like a baby, and said \"you don't know how close we were\" and proceded to talk about his loved, but not forgotten brother...... it was a very emotional day and a very happy day as well. My grandfather is going to make a safe box of some kind with a hinged glass cover for it, we filled a void for him, and again I would just like to thank everyone out there for your help with this project, as everyone in our family was touched, it was a huge success, and we are very grateful for your kindness and generosity. This does not complete our search however, any new information found would still be greatly appreciated. The 35th Infantry Regiment Association salutes our fallen brother, PV2 Leroy J. Broeders, RA16343036, who died in the service of his country on September 10th, 1951 in North Korea. The cause of death was listed as MIA to KIA. He was from Dickenson County, Michigan. Leroy's Military Occupation Specialty was 4745-Light Weapons Infantryman. Gratefully, Michelle Salka (Broeders)\n\nMichelle Salka -- Plainfield IL USA -- 07/12/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2782.

Since I signed the guest book on June 1st this year I have had many send me E-mails about our times together. I really appriciate all the messages. as I stated in my 1st guest signing. I write poetry. Here is a poem for all our veterans, I hope you like it: FRIENDSHIP FORMED IN COMBAT As young men we became veterans who survived the horrors of war, Serving together we forged a lasting friendship while fighting through the bloody gore. Knowing, as only combat veterans can know, the daily hell we faced, We know we made it through that awfull hell because of GOD's forgiving grace. Returning from the war, promising to stay in contact over the years, At our reunions we see that some have not survived, this causes us to shed sad tears. When we gather at our annual reunions,some tall tales are told by friends so bold, Being together, we know this friendship forged in combat is more precious than gold. We're proud to say we'll always think fondly of our friends with hearts full of pride, Thanking GOD for those who survived, yet remembering our friends who have died.//// I wrote this one thinking of all the friends I have known throughout the years, hope you enjoy it, Wayne (Lucky) Lund.\n\nWayne D.

I was shocked when his father told me of the accident after he inviting me into the house. I have always regretted my instant reaction (I think I went immediately to mental shock) when I blurted out and mentioned a debt owed. Over the years I have constantly wished I could have retracted those two sentences about money to a grieving father who had just lost a son. Paul, you will never be forgotton.

I wanted to take the time to pass along my thanks to Ben Youmans for the assistance he provided to me as this organization started and grew. If it hadn't of been for him I would not have become a 'silent' participant. ---------- I've monitored the organization as it has grown over time and appreciate the time and effort that has been put into making both the web site and organization a truly 'functionaly' entity. It has grown into an exceptional organizational effort that supports past, present and future soldiers and members. I salute those of you who have contributed to this effort. ---------- I read with some dismay the notes about Ben in one of the Cacti times. They may have been justified (you do believe everything you read in print don't you?) but I don't believe that a public forum, and particularly the Cacti Times, should have been used as it was. It certainly does not seem to me to meet the 'spirit and intent' of the organization as it applies to 'comrades-in-arms' ... ---------- Ben: I appreciate the time and effort you put into this organization and wish you the best of whatever you put your efforts and skills to ....---------- C/3, C/6, R/6\n\nFrom Dave Muxo: I know that the leadership of the association appreciates the kind words expressed here. The good of the membership is always foremost on their minds, and like Ben, they put heart and soul into every decision. No action is taken lightly. Ben's contributions to this association will always be appreciated by all of us, leaders and members alike.\n\nHomer L. Krout, II -- APO AE USA -- 06/08/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2748.

Article written by Jim Cooke in the Fall 06 Cacti Times: Veterans whose discharges are other than dishonorable, their spouses and dependent children may be buried in a national cemetery, regardless of where they live.

At some point around 1943, my brother, William Russell Griffin, was assigned to the Anti Tank Co., 134th Infantry Regiment, 35th Division during WWII. He had been on the West Coast with the 144th Infantry, 36th Div. before he was at Fort Lewis, WA. His feet froze in Alaska or on a troop transport ship near Alaska. He went with the 134th to the ETO in June, 1944 and was wounded just near the German border on Sept. 28, 1944. There are some gaps in my research of his service which extended from the Texas Natl. Guard (36th Div) enlistment in 1932 until he was inducted into the Regular Army in Nov. 1940. He was at Camp Bowie, TX and then on maneuvers in LA in 1940 and 1941. From there he went to Fort Lewis, WA. I am trying to find out when and where he was transferred to the 35th. Can anyone help me out here? Was any part of the 35th in Alaska? Thanks for your help. He died without heirs and I am his last living relative and am trying to document the military career of a very good soldier. Geraldine B. Young Sister of Wm. Russell Griffin\n\nGeraldine B.

I trust that most of you are familiar with the magazine \"Vietnam Magazine\", being a part of \"The Historynet\"'s serie of magazines devoted to the wars US Armed Forces have fought in, aswell as the US Civil War. (Magazines printed by seperate series for each war). If not familiar with this, or if my rambling makes me \"come out foggy\", please also see (for Viet Nam) the link: http://www.historynet.com/magazines/vietnam . The reason for why I am writing this specific post here now however, is that I just wish to make a \"heads up\" on that the June-issue of the Viet Nam magazine, has on from page 52 to 58, an article about 2/35th Inf Rgt. It is written by Lt.Col Ben G. Crosby USARMY Ret., whom in March of 1967 served as Cacti Blue's Battalion Operations Officer. His article is regarding the fierce battle, which took place on March 20 and 21 of 1967, \"near\" the area of FSB Dragon. I receive my issues by mail to over here in Sweden, and do not know if the issue is already out in stores in USA or not. But the cover of this specific issue has as main headline \"Khe Sanh\" on its cover, so that you will know which issue it is I am referring to. (The above link shows an image of the previous issue, \"April\", in its site). I just wanted to let as many Cacti's as possible know.___Take Good Care!___Sincerely___A.B\n\nA.B -- Stockholm Sweden -- 04/22/2007\n\n2700. Dick Arnold and I are currently in the middle of a project of sending away for personnel records for our last 125 KIA's that we need photo's for. We have hopes of getting some of these photo's from the personnel records but we know that this will be for a small percentage. Following this, we know that these records will show where and when these guys took Basic Training. So we are collecting info on who has basic training yearbooks and for what places and years. We then hope to match some of these needed photo's to some of the yearbooks. It's a bit of a long shot but we hope for a few of these to work out. Several people have contacted me to let me know that they have copies of their yearbooks. Since there were so very many diffrent basic training groups we need a very large selection of yearbooks. If you haven't already contacted me but you do still have your book, please let me know. We have to wait for all of these requests to come back so we can compile a list of which yearbooks might be likely candidates for finding a basic training photo of one of our KIA heroes. I am compiling all the responses that I get onto a spreadsheet and if your yearbook is a likely candidate then I will get in touch with you.

I attended the services and helped carry my friend an Cacti brother MSG Kenneth Watters to his resting place on Feb. 4, 2007 at Fort Sam Houston. Kenneth and I spent many days and nights together in an M60 gun team in that tropical land in Southeast Asia. We shared stories of home, we shared our packages of food from home. It has been two months since that day and has difficult for me to write since his passing. I could not believe that he was all of a sudden gone from us. We had got together with his wife and mine a few months earlier to spend some little but precious time together. What this event means to me, is that time and life are short and we must make time to talk and visit each other more often.

I am looking for families who lost loved ones in Viet Nam on 1/20/1970. My brother was killed on that date. My family has been contacted concerning a book being written about those men and \"the effects it has had on the families\". I have not spoken directly with the author since I expressed my reservations about this book and its purpose. Those reservations have grown since I have learned that he has obtained the report of the circumstances of my brother's death and things are being brought out after 37 years that may or may not be true and which are upsetting to members of my family and we do not wish our parents to have to be told this at this time in their lives whether it be fact or not. We know our brother died in honor and has been with Jesus for the past 37 years. If you have been contacted by the author regarding your family member, please contact me and let me know your feelings on this. Maybe, talking to someone in the same situation will help me grasp the reasoning behind this book. Thank you and God Bless.

My heart is heavy reporting the loss of MSG Kenneth W. Watters,USA (Ret) on Sunday February 4, 2007. Ken served in 1st Platoon C/2/35 Viet Nam 67/68 as a M60 Machine Gunner. Services will be held 08:30 hrs, at the Sunset Memorial Park Funeral Home (210-828-2811), 1701 Austin Hwy., San Antonio, TX. on Thursday, February 8, 2007. Burial will be at the Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. Ken had a unique ability to recognize tactical deployment of his machine gun and machine gun team in a quick and effective manner while under enemy fire. His technical knowledge, analytical ability and situational awareness earned the respect of his men and the trust of his peers in Charlie Company. Ken had a strong moral fiber and conviction to his beliefs of God, Family, Country and Cacti Brothers. I pray that God will bless his family and accept his soul into heaven for my Cacti Brother has spent his time in Hell.\n\nJohn (Jack) Anderson (Sgt.

Read the profile on Ralph Blackerby, list him being killed by friendly fire. It was the battle of Dien Truong. A Co had been pinned down in an open rice field, B co did a combat assault on a hill overlooking the village. I had 4.2. 105mm, and perhaps 8 inch arty going into it, I had the FAC put in 4 air strikes before dark. Recall a hook came in and dropped a hook load of LAWs to shoot into the village. A co got out of the rice field when two napalms fell short. That night we had Puff rakeing the village, we had the front line marked with trip flares but I am sure puff could not see it that well. It sounded like a buzz saw whem we were hit. Ralph imediately put a field dressing on one of the guys hit in the arm, Ralph was saying you will be OK, calmed him down. So one said \"Are you hit Ralph, OK?\" Ralph felt his chest and said words to the effect\" God I am hit too\" he then died, just like that. He was a brave Cacti, looking out for his cacti brother first. To me , he showed all of us what a true man was. I am told if you say a man's name, he will never be forgotten so Ralph, we all remember you.\n\nDon Keith, FO ,B co -- Bartlett TN USA -- 01/29/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2656. co 2nd 35th 25th inf div may 66 to may 67 operation paul revier and sam houston base camp pleiku i drang valley kontum co commander lt davis capt ord and capt ronald rykowski if you served under command please contact me\n\nrobert myers -- olamon me USA -- 01/29/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2655.

Although time has passed somethings never change. After reading the news on the intranet today I see \"Hanoi Jane\" and her followers are showing their heads once more. They should ban her or put her in exile.The last thing we need is her demoralizing our troops abroad regardlees of which country they are from.I for one lost a good friend in Viet Nam in 67 but at the time they all believed in the cause. Our troops today fighting in Iraq and Afganistan believe in their cause and not Hanoi Jane's.

A big thanks to the Cacti Association for providing me the opportunity to search for men who served with my big brother Joseph Ledesma, Jr., a member of C/2-35, who was killed on May 20, 1967. Yesterday I had a 2-1/5 hr. telephone conversation with Bobby Day, A/2-35, who was friends with Joe at Tiger Land, Fort Polk, LA, and assigned to the 35th in Vietnam with Joe. I am compiling information for a book about Joe's life. Although he was a civilian for 19 years, his brief time n the Army is an integral part of his life story. I am encouraged to read that last year there was a 30% increase in Cacti membership. Hopefully among the membership increase there are even more men who served with and remember Joe. I have already had the priveledge of speaking with Mike Hord, Doc Joe Baker, Jim Phillips, Randy Morris, and now Bobby Day. In 2005 my family travelled to NY and met Doc Baker, who was with Joe when he was killed. I have had some great correspondence with the sister of Roland Rush (he was 6ft-8in tall!) who was killed along with Joe in the \"Battle of Vinh Hien\" on May 20, 1967. I can say that speaking with these men REALLY has been a priveledge. This has been a very healing process for me. I was 13 when Joe was killed, and for these men to have the courage to open themselves up about their time in Vietnam so many years ago says volumes about their character. Our conversations have been so open and honest. I appreciate the trust and openess they have displayed. They are my brothers. I look forward to contact from other Cacti members who served with Joe at Ft. Lewis, WA, Fort Polk, LA, or in 'Nam. Thanks, -D.\n\nDavid Ledesma -- San Jose CA USA -- 01/23/2007\n\nEmail\n\n2647.

Recently, a picture of Jim Curry (D 1/35 KIA 4/1/69) was located through a lead that Brian, his boyhood friend, gave us. Here is his response to seeing it on our website:\n\nI want to thank Peter Birrow and the rest of the \"Cacti' for not letting Jim be forgotten. I have been searching the web and writing letters before the web began trying to find information on Jimmy. I sleep a little better knowing the there are more of us who remember James J Curry as more than an entry on the wall.

I am seeking information from anyone who knew my brother, Philip Walton, who was a \"grunt\" in Bravo Co., 35th Regiment,25th Division. He was there from April 1965 to April 1966. I was in-country at the time, at Pleiku with the 4th ID. He and I spoke by phone sometimes, and met each other several times. I met several of his comrades from B Co., when I visited, and I recall his hootch was near the ice factory or plant, on Pleiku. I am seeking information on a battle, with a number of U.S. casualties, from the 35th and the 173rd Airborne Div. I was not aware that Phil had rotated back to the States when I heard of the battle. I was worried that he had been wounded or killed, so I came to the graves registration point, which was on a hill, in a tent, with cooler trucks around. This was at or near Pleiku. Description, dates, location of the engagement would be helpful to me with a VA claim. Contact me c/o uncamitty@yahoo.com, or at 42 Davis Street, Presque Isle, Maine 04769.

It is intended as a tribute to our guys who were wounded or killed and to bring back a lot of memories from the Cacti in Viet Nam. I'm using it as a tool to try and let my family understand some of what we went through over there. I intentionally didn't make it another blood and guts thing. It deals more with the day to day life and ends up with one battle. I thought some of you might be interested because it's Cacti.
