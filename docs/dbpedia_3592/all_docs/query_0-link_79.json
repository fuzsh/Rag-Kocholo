Genl Johnston is absent for a few days at Mobile and in his absence I have assumed command. When he returns I suppose he will assign me to some duty. I did not come here willingly. I would have preferred to remain with my old [comdg] and I have seen nothing since my arrival to change that opinion.” Hardee went on to regret Adams’ removal from his command as well as what he saw as the “neglect of the government in not rewarding your [Adams’] services.” Hardee noted that he was glad Adams’ family and his slaves were safe and related that he was on the move to Enterprise, [MS].\n\n1.22: Broadside from Lieutenant General W.J.

Look at your country- the earth ravaged- property carried away, or disappearing in flame and ashes- the people murdered- the negroes arrayed in arms against the whites- cruel indignities inflicted upon women and children…Fellow soldiers! There is but one path to follow. It leads to the camp. Come to your color[s] and stand beside your comrades, who, with heroic constancy; are confronting the enemy.”\n\n1.23: Letter from W.J.

The clipping lists the promotion of Wirt Adams to Brigadier General.\n\n1.26: Telegram from Jefferson Davis to General Wirt Adams, 5 [month unlisted] 1863\n\nScope and Content\n\nRichmond, [VA]. On South-Western Telegraph Company letterhead. 2pp. Discussed a letter written by General Adams which has resulted in General S.D. Lee’s communicating with General Smith.

He congratulates Adams on his promotion.\n\n1.29: Letter from Lt. [illegible word, possibly Addison Harvey, First Lieutenant of Company M] to “Col” [Wirt Adams], 6 November 1863\n\nScope and Content\n\n“Camp near Brownsville, Miss.” 4pp. Report apparently written at the request of General Adams. Notes encounters with armed slaves on the plantation of Jefferson Davis and his brother Joseph Davis. The letter’s author writes that Adams directed him to take 20 men, cross the Big Black River, and destroy the ship Indianola. The ship was not destroyed but he learned there were “sixty armed negroes on the Joe Davis Place, engaged in seizing & carrying off to the Yankees…plundering the adjoining plantations & committing other acts of a similar character.” He “determined to cross the river and capture or kill them.” The author describes killing at least eight former slaves during this process and wounding several others. He mentions two African-American men by name, “Capt. Horace” and “Capt. Henry.”\n\n1.30: General Orders, No. 1. Wirt Adams, Brig. Genl., 14 November 1863\n\nScope and Content\n\nHd. Qrs Cavalry Brigade, Near Gallatin, [MS]. Adams relates his promotion and command of the brigade. He wrote, “We are engaged in, fellow soldiers, in no ordinary contest. It involves for us, our lives, liberty & property & the protection of our family hearths, from the polluting presence of a brutal & malignant foe.” He noted, “in this struggle we suffer the disadvantage of greatly inferior numbers & resources & can only hope to [illegible] success by superior valor, constancy & discipline.” He also interestingly noted [possibly in reaction to the report of 6 November], “whilst promoting by every means [in] our power of inflicting injury upon our enemies, let us, at the same time, be careful not to increase the already heavy losses of the citizens of our country.\"\n\n1.31: Letter from Lt.

He noted that “with considerable trouble I was able to furnish Mr. Davis a list of the names of persons who bought or now have the mules &c, with the brand. None of them except a mule & a roan pony have his mark.” Apparently Davis wished all animals found on the plantation restored to him, and this caused the Lieutenant some discomfort. He ended by writing, “I merely write this to show you that I have already made an effort to restore Mr. Davis’ property which ought to satisfy any reasonable man.” There is no mention of the attack on the African Americans on the plantation by the troops, or reference to those captured or killed.\n\n1.32: Letter from Geo. Moorman, Capt. AA General [AAG at the time to General WH Jackson] to “Genl” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 24 November 1863\n\nScope and Content\n\nHd Qrs “Jacksons Cav Div.” Livingston, Miss. 1p.

Jackson, AA. General to General Polk. The penciled reminiscence by Adams, likely written at a later date, reads “At the time Genl. Jackson contemplated attacking New Orleans, Genl Polk ordered me to make a diversion in his favor by approaching & threatening Port Hudson & Bayou Sara and to get reliable information regarding the garrison of their places. The following is a copy of the dispatch sent Genl. Polk from Olive Branch near Baton Rouge.” The dispatch itself relates the information Adams found during this operation regarding the defenses at Baton Rouge and Port Hudson.\n\n1.34: Two documents pasted onto 1 scrapbook page. “Report of Effective Strength and Loss of Horses from Adams’ Brig ‘JC [D]- for Febry 7th 1864” and “Informal Report of Casualties in Adams’ Brig. ‘JCD’ in the action of Feby 4th & 5th 1864.”, [date unknown]\n\nScope and Content\n\nLikely relates to the action seen by Adams’ Brigade in the Meridian Campaign, February 3-28, 1864.\n\n1.35: Newspaper clipping attached to scrapbook page with pins. The Mississippian, [March 1864]\n\nScope and Content\n\n1p. One article in particular titled, “First Justitia,” written under the penname “Jacob Jarvis” relates the experience by a soldier in Wirt Adams’ brigade during the Meridian Campaign. Note: A penciled-in notation, likely written by General Adams’ at a later date, seems to identify Capt. Robert Muldrow as the author.\n\n1.36: Letter from 18 “neighbors and family” to Brig Gen Wirt Adams, 5 March 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nJackson, [MS]. 3pp. Requests that Adams and his “gallant Brigade” meet with the undersigned so that they could convey “their thanks for the distinguished valor displayed in resisting the advance of the enemy from Big Black.”\n\n1.37: Letter from William [last name obscured by pasted pages but likely Elliott], AAG to “Genl” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 16 March 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHead Quarters Lee’s Cav.

No permits to go within the enemy’s lines will be granted to citizens except in the most extreme cases.” Adams was also ordered to destroy all articles obtained through trade with the enemy and to closely watch the Central Railroad.\n\n1.38 & 1.39: Letter from William Elliott, AAG, to “Genl” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 16 March 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHead Quarters. Lees Cav Dept. Canton, Miss. 2pp. References enclosed letter from “Department Head Quarters” which authorized General Lee to buy supplies with government cotton.

Describes the capture of the US navy gunboat Petrel “captured by my command on the Yazoo River” and offers the spoils to the Confederate government. Adams writes, “It affords me cordial satisfaction to make this small but possibly useful contribution to an arm of the service which, with means so disproportionate has achieved results so important & beneficial to our Country & Cause.”\n\n1.42: Letter from Frank Buchanan, Admiral, to Brig. Gen’l Wirt Adams, 27 April 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nOn Naval Commandant’s Office, Mobile, Ala. letterhead. 1p. Alerts Adams that Act’g Master James McCarrick will soon be arriving in Brandon, MS to “receive and convey to Selma, Ala, the eight heavy brass guns lately captured by the gallant forces under your command from the U.S. Steamer “Petrel” in the Yazoo River.” He ends the letter by writing, “I sincerely hope these guns may render service in our just cause against the vile enemy from whom they were captured.”\n\n1.43: Letter from Dabney H. Maury [Major General] to “My Dear General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 14 [May] 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nLabeled “Confidential.” 1p. Requests that Adams approach Senator Oldham of Texas to dissuade him from his notion to oppose “passage of Troops form Trans Mississippi to this Department.” Maury notes that Oldham is a “very clever man tenacious of purpose” and cautions Adams that “this is …a delicate business.” He asks Adams to decide whether to approach Oldham or “whether it will be wise to attempt it at all.”\n\n1.44: Letter from Major General S.D. Lee to “General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 18 May 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHead Qrs, Dept. Ala, Miss, & E. La. Meridian, [MS]. 2pp. References telegram from Adams to him relating the information that federal troops were in and around Yazoo City, with an expectation of continuing to Vicksburg. Lee offers to send Gholson’s Brigade “recently mustered with the Confederate service” to Adams in a few days to supplement his small force. Lee writes, “with this addition to your force You will then be able I hope to cope with the raiding parties of the Enemy and to restore confidence.” He writes about his inability to greatly increase forces in central Mississippi: “it is necessary for me to keep a considerable force North Miss to repel any raid from Memphis” and that “Every thing has been sent to Johnston.”\n\n1.45: Letter from Major General S.S. Lee to “General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 3 June 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHead Qrs Dept. Ala, Miss, & E. La. Meridian, Miss. 2pp. Writes about Adams’ concern regarding the ability of Col. Kennard to manage ordnance stores. Lee notes it was “carelessness sending you the Howitzer with ball in it.” Lee ordered that he be reported, that “all troops are under your control” and that a court martial was possible. Describes troop movement in middle Alabama and attempts to turn back the raid from Memphis on June 2.\n\n1.46: Letter from William Elliot, AAG [for Major General Stephen D. Lee] to “General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 22 June 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHead Quarters Dept. Ala, Miss & E.La.

Scott’s effective force be moved to various points in Mississippi, primarily around North Mississippi. Lee requests that 500 men be left “in front of Vicksburg.” Lee wanted Adam’s forces to be able to move quickly into North Mississippi if needed but still maintain some show of force near Vicksburg. Adams himself was asked to remain at Jackson but to “hold yourself and staff in readiness to take the field in North Miss at any time that it may be necessary.” Lee also asked Adams to send information about the size of the federal forces near Vicksburg.\n\n1.47: Letter from Col. J.S. Scott, Com’d Cav. Brig. to “Gen’l” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 1 July 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHd. Qrs Cav. Brigade, Camp near Hazlehurst. 4pp. Thanks Adams for his praise of his conduct in a recent letter and notes, “it has very seldom been my lot to receive praise from my commanders and that coming, as in the present instance, from a comrade in arms and acquaintance of former days.” Asks that if Adams is able to get General Lee’s consent for him to return to his district that he be allowed to take his supplies and part of his cavalry through the “River Counties.” He also requests that he be allowed to disperse the rest of his cavalry in other areas around East Louisiana and around Natchez. Relates his happiness in learning that General Liddell is to supersede him. The last page of the letter is obscured due to the page being pasted into a place holder.\n\n1.48: Newspaper clipping pasted into scrapbook, “Gen. Slocum’s Expedition to Jackson, Miss.”, [date unknown]\n\nScope and Content\n\nUnidentified newspaper with reports from S.D. Lee included. 1p. Describes recent action around Jackson, MS and specifically mentions Brigadier General Wirt Adams as well as the wounding of General Gholson.\n\n1.49: 54 Letter from Brigadier General Wirt Adams to “General” [Major General S.D. Lee], 23 July 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nJackson, [MS]. 4pp. Adams notes that since he has had no time to write of the events around Jackson earlier in the month, due to the fact that he had been compelled to go to Port Gibson soon thereafter and Lee’s “constant occupation in North Miss.” The four page letter is an account of the engagement and Gholson’s role plays a large part in the missive.\n\n1.50: Newspaper page, Mississippian-Extra, 2 August 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nJackson, MS. 1p. Likely cut out as the primary article on the page is a critique of Stephen D. Lee. The article entitled, “More of Lieut. S.D. Lee,” criticizes Lee’s focus on North Mississippi seemingly at the expense of central Mississippi, especially in the wake of the engagement in Jackson in early July.\n\n1.51: Letter from W.J. Hardee [Brigadier General William Joseph Hardee] to “My dear General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 11 September 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHd. Qrs Jonesboro, [AR]. 4pp. Hardee writes that he is near Atlanta and that Sherman “with his army is at or near Atlanta.” Hardee writes, “our Army is greatly reduced in numbers & distributed.” He asks the prophetic question, “How do you feel about the future?” and states that “never in my opinion were our liberties in such danger. What can be done?” He asks Adams for his suggestions to the problem. He notes that he has been “trading with the Yankees” to obtain much needed medical supplies.\n\n1.52: Letter from E. Barksdale [likely Ethelbert Barksdale] to “My Dear Sir” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 19 September 1864\n\nScope and Content\n\nHenderson, [Ga?]. 4pp. Giving Adams information about the situation in Georgia, much of it inaccurate. He does feel that the Confederate forces are “too much reduced to venture upon an offensive movement” against Sherman. Barksdale asks about Nathan Bedford Forrest and mentions the Chicago Convention. He generally critiques McClellan and Seward and mentions that he has sent all of his thoughts to President Davis.

Forrest also asks for Adams’ opinion about the advisability of an attack. Anderson notes that Forrest has been unwell and “suffering in his head for some time past.” Forrest is undergoing treatment for the condition and would attempt to travel by rail to take command, as he is currently unable to ride his horse.\n\n1.54: Letter from Lieutenant General [Richard Taylor] to “General” [Brigadier General Wirt Adams], 16 February 1865\n\nScope and Content\n\nHeadquarter Dept.

Adams followed and engagements ensued in the midst of a strong rainstorm. Even after the charge by Wood’s Regiment, in which Captain Luckett was wounded, Croxton was still able to continue towards Tuscaloosa. Adams outlines what he and his men were able to capture, as well as his own losses, but he did not follow Croxton further. The following scrapbook page contains a penciled note, likely written by Adams at a later date, which reads: “Note The foregoing is a Report of the last fight of my command, and is alluded to by Genl Jordan in his “Life & Campaigns of Forrest” as “the” last engagement of the war east of the Mississippi.” See Jordan’s note page 670.-“\n\n1.58: Telegram from Lt.

He mentions that he has not heard from Adams since his victory at Gainesville and “that victory will reflect credit ion you in all time to come.” Moorman reflects on their future and past experiences, “While our political and military heavens were surcharged with tokens of the approaching story and our history already [illegible word] with accumulated disaster and defeats, you were the only general officer throughout the length and breadth of the Confederacy who plucked one singly bough of laurel and caused it to be entwined with the cypress wreath which now encircles us. Should the war cease now you would have the honor of having won the last victory on Confederate soil, & in the Confederate cause.” Moorman seems determined to continue though, “But I cannot give up something good will certainly turn up yet. I will never believe that we have failed until the conviction is forced upon me.” He asks to keep a wagon Adams had authorized for his use, as he “cannot hire anything here at all.” But he notes that he will not take the wagon until he hears from Adams. Penciled note, likely from Wirt Adams, on the last page of the letter reads, “Please send Capt.

During this meeting they developed a “preamble and resolutions which were unanimously adopted.” The resolutions and preamble basically outlined the men’s admiration for the leadership of Wirt Adams during the Civil War. The document begins by stating that although they are now “exiles in a foreign land, or, aliens in our own homes” they could not disband without letting Adams know of their high regard. They describe him as “a gentleman, a patriot and soldier.” They note “he was among the first to espouse what he believed to be the defense of his country’s rights and honor, and he numbered among the last to yield her standard, or let the folds of her ensign trail in the dust.” The men resolve to “tender to him our most hearty thanks for all that he has done for us, and, our common country.” They also declare that the will “always be proud to mention him as our first Colonel and last Brig Genl.” They also want to make sure that this resolution will be filed in the adjutant’s office and a copy “be transmitted to Brig. Genl Wirt Adams by a committee of three members of the Regiment.”\n\n1.64: Document from Brig. General Wirt Adams to “Gentlemen” [John A. [Sugg] Lt. Co. E; Wm.

He hopes that the future will be bright, although it appears currently to be a “starless night of a fallen country.” He relates that their country is “no longer ours. Her institutions political and moral; the system of labor wisely ordained by God for the climate and social we have enjoyed and which has been carefully fostered and sustained by our people with incalculable benefit to the slave, to the world and to ourselves; the distinctive features of our society resulting from this system and which has elevated our people above all other American society; these must all speedily disappear beneath the overwhelming tide of Yankee fanaticism, cant, hypocrisy, and knavery.” He admits that the southern people must now adapt to “the new order of things” but not “lost all those attractive traits of character we have in the past been taught to admire and respect.” He cites his concern over the burden of federal taxation and “the restriction of the right of suffrage…and the practical enforcement of the political and social equality of the negro.” He is worried that many will “bend their necks to the Yankee to the yoke thus imposed.” He states that it is their duty, “as honorable men, as brothers, husbands and fathers …to exert ourselves to the utmost to extricate ourselves and those dependent upon us from such misery and humiliation.”\n\n1.65: Document, “Mention of Gen D.W.
