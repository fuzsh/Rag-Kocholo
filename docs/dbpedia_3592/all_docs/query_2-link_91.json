I stopped my traveling for now and a door was opened with an opportunity to work so I took it. I work at Sarasota First Baptist Church as the Facility Assistant. I still will be attending my reunions but cant make the Cacti coming up in Sept. this year. Still have not heard from anyone that knew Sgt William Silva my squad leader when he was kia that night May 29,1967 and my Co Cpt. Ralph Walker at the Battle of Tan Phong. I think Sgt Silva was 2nd squad my squad. I've never met anyone from my squad from that night that knows me or Sgt Silva. I think Im the last survivng man from my squad that night. I was hoping I was wrong but 50 years can make a difference. im hoping to get up to Rhode Island to pay my respects to SGT Silva and West point NY National Cemetary to pay my respe\n\ncts to Cpt Walker . Will have to see if my wife and I can drive or we may have to fly then rent car and drive to which point come next and then drive back to airport car rental and the fly back to Fl.

I live in San Bernardino, Ca. a friend of mine bought a large box 24�1/2X24�1/2 at a yard sale in San Bernardino, Ca. among the items in the box was a small box of Vietnam ribbons and medals, the Army Commendation medal with the name James J. Brennan was among the Medals. The Vietnam Virtual Wall of Faces is how I found the unit he served with when he was killed.(ed.A,1/35th) I have been in contact with a nephew of James's in New Jersey and will be returning the medals to him during a ceremony at Fort Hamilton New York on Veterans Day 2018. The Brooklyn Spectator newspaper will be doing a follow up article on James J. Brennan sometime in September 2018. 50 years later How His medals got from New York to San Bernardino and showed up in a yard sale is still a mystery.

History by Chuck Santose Bravo 2/35:\n\nFrom the AUSA daily Five Things Column: First I read of German involvement. Maybe you can pass this on to the other guys.\n\nWorld War I Remembered\n\nOn Aug. 27, 1918, the 35th Infantry Regiment, reinforced by Buffalo Soldiers from the 10th Cavalry Regiment, engages in a border skirmish in Nogales, Ariz., with Mexican forces who are being advised by German military officers. Three U.S. soldiers are killed and 29 wounded. German involvement makes some consider the Battle of Ambos Nogales the first World War I battle on U.S. soil although the shooting started after a dispute over a customs inspection.\n\nPeter Birrow -- Gulfport FL USA -- 08/27/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5456. Here is another request that we received concerning a Bravo 2/35 borther. It has been modified for brevity:\n\nMy name is Mary Ellen Cimorelli-Score. I am looking for someone that was in the platoon with PFC Frank V. Raz, RTO in October and November 1967, 2/35th, Bravo Co; 3rd Platoon. He was KIA Nov 18, 1967. He was RTO for the 3rd Platoon Leader Captain,(then Lieutenant) James McCormick who was seriously injured in the same land mine explosion. The information regarding the circumstances of the incident has been conflicting and I feel now I need some resolve.\n\nYou see, Frank and I were going to be married when he returned. Life did go on, I did marry and have children. I had kept close to Franks' family; his sister was in my wedding, they knew my husband, and I used to bring my children to visit them. To this day, Frank is still part of our \"family\". Even though it has been 51 yrs since I last saw him, I still think of him everyday.\n\nReally not sure if it is closure I'm looking for or what it is. Recently retired from nursing, and my last 8 yrs was in Hospice. That had brought a new prospective to life and death.\n\nAugust- November is always a challenge emotionally. I have seen your posting of pictures on the web site and Franks letters do correlate with the area you were in.\n\nI have the daily journal from 1500- the end of the day of November 18, 1967.\n\nTHANK YOU for your Service!!!!\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMary Ellen Cimorelli-Score\n\nscore7578@aol.com\n\nPeter Birrow -- Gulfport FL -- 08/25/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5455.

Just learned from a post on the website that Colonel John Fielding passed away last May.

He grieved along with the rest of us and was a very caring officer for the men who served under him.

In talking with a neighbor tonight he told me about a nephew who was killed shortly before he was supposed to deros. The nephew was an Army Ranger assigned to a ranger unit outside Plieku. The story my neighbor told was of a ranger unit that ran into trouble, and called for help. His nephew was good friends with one or two rangers out in the shit, and volunteered to go out with the relief force. The group in contact were relieved and saved by the relief force but my neighbor's nephew was KIA. I know these folk weren't Cacti but I'm wondering if anyone remembers a ranger base in the neighborhood of Plieku? This action was in October of 1969, anyone remember hearing about any of it? My neighbor had just gotten back from cleaning up his nephew's grave and is still not taking the kid's death well. If possible I'd like to pass on something to help him fill in some of the blanks.

Frank Bishop (Delta Company 2/35th, 1968-69) passed away on March 7, 2018 after a hard fought battle with multiple myeloma. I sent an email yesterday checking in with Frank and his wife Tenetia replied today with the sad news. Frank and Tenetia lived in Broken Arrow, OK. At the time Frank joined the Army he hailed from Kentucky. His time in the Cacti came to an abrupt end when he awoke one morning in Vietnam and was paralyzed. He was was sent to the Army hospital in Japan where he required several surgical procedures and was sent back to the states to recover. After his recovery he was offered the opportunity to go back to finish Helicopter School. He extended his enlistment by a year, became a helicopter pilot and a Warrant Officer and came back to Vietnam flying Huey's and Cobra's with the 1st Cav. The fact that he had already served as a grunt and extended his enlistment knowing where he would go tells you all you need to know about the man. He was shot down and severely injured (7 months in a full body cast). He made a amazing recovery and had a fulfilling career and a wonderful family. I am sure his Delta Company comrades join me in saluting a great soldier and a life well-lived.\n\nFrank Valeri -- Plano TX -- 03/27/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5398.

This is the 13th consecutive year that the company will have its own separate get together in conjunction with the annual Cacti Regimental Reunion. There will be no set program but plenty of time to visit with old friends in a casual and comfortable setting.\n\nThe Old Spaghetti Factory a casual Italian style chain but their first restaurant was established in Portland in 1969. It is located on the Willamette River and is easily accessed via public transportation (the Mt Hood Ave MAX Station is a short walk from the hotel and it connects to the SW Lowell & Bond Stop of the Portland Streetcar which is a block from the restaurant; details will be provided). It is also close to many unique Portland activities such as the South Waterfront Lower Tram. Prices range from $11-17 dollars, not including gratuity & taxes. (Note: there is no State tax in Oregon).\n\nWe'll have our own separate area and will be using the banquet menu which is a 3 course meal to include: a crisp salad, hot baked bread and spumoni ice cream for dessert, along with choice of 1 out of the 3 selected entrees (which are being selected by those attending). Take a look at the location and menu on their web site at: http://www.osf.com/location/portland-or/\n\nAll Bravo Company, 1/35 veterans, family and friends who would like to attend should contact Ralph & Jeannie Holtby as soon as their plans are set so we can let the folks at The Old Spaghetti Factory know how many of us to expect. This can be done by email ridgetopview@hotmail.com; phone 541-480-5214 or snail mail at 6961 NE 1st St., Redmond, OR 97756-8756\n\nLooking forward to seeing all Bravo Company members and guests in Portland and especially for lunch on Friday, September 28 at 12 Noon!\n\nThomas J Blue -- Bluffton SC -- 03/25/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5397.

When the 25th Division was formed in Hawaii shortly before WWII, there was the 1/35 and the 2/35. The 1/35 had the blue cactus and was 'Cacti Blue' and the 2/35 was 'Cacti Blue' until both were deactivated after Vietnam. When the 25th decided to reactivate the Cacti, they only reactivated the 2/35th and the new Regiment uses the blue cactus.\n\nCurtis Gay -- -- 03/21/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5394. Dave & Peter;\n\nWell first of all thank you both for getting back to me, it's appreciated. I do little more checking on my own last night, ended up at Wikipedia 35th Infantry Regiment, someone have posted a very long and very interesting articles on the 35th infantry Regiment. Apparently the cacti is green, or at least the original one was. Maybe when the battalion expanded to the 2/35, & 3/35 each decided to have their own color, hence we got a cacti blue, and maybe cacti yellow.\n\nCliff Westwood -- Pittsburgh PA -- 03/19/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5393. UPDATE: After an extensive search of photographs of the 35th Infantry Regiment, I believe that the crest with the green cactus is the Regimental Crest. I did see photos of the current 2nd battalion in which there was a crest with a blue cactus, which I believe to be the battalion crest. In some cases, both crests were displayed in the same photo. I did not see any photo in which the crest with a blue cactus appeared on a uniform. Since the crest worn on the uniform represents the regiment, that would seem to make sense.\n\nDave Muxo -- Orem UT US -- 03/18/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5392. Cliff: I've been waiting for someone smarter than me to answer your question, but I'll give it a shot since no one else seems to know. Actually the crest is neither green nor blue, but it does have a green cactus and a little blue behind the Maltese cross. The crest itself has a background color of Argent, which is usually represented as white, although I have seen a kind of creme color. I do remember seeing a crest with a blue cactus years ago at vendor stall in Melbourne Florida, but I'm pretty sure it was not official. The actives are 2/35th (Cacti Blue) but they wear the crest which has a green cactus, so I'm pretty sure that there is only one crest.\n\nDave Muxo -- Orem Ut -- 03/17/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5391. I have a question for those of you who know more about 35th Infantry Regiment etiquette than I do. The question is on the shield and lapel pin, cacti image are there two different colors? I've been led to believe that their are but I'm not sure.\n\nIs the 1/35 Infantry Regiment known as cacti Green? While the 2/35 Infantry Regiment known as cacti Blue? I've heard it be said that there is only one color which is green, but others say that there are two colors, green for the 1/35 and blue for the 2/35. The lapel pins I have now cacti are green, but as I recall a number of years ago I did have lapel pins where the cacti was light blue.\n\n(You know how goes; I can't find them, I put them somewhere where I knew where they would be when I needed them, (Chuckle Chuckle) and so it goes !!!) :-)\n\nThank You Much\n\nCliff Westwood\n\nCliff Westwood -- Pittsburgh PA -- 03/14/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5390.

Hello members of the 35th Infantry Regiment! My name is Nicholas Pfister, and I go to Bridge City High School in Bridge City, Texas. I am in an advanced placement English class, and we just finished reading the novel 'The Things They Carried.' I was given an assignment to make a memorial for a soldier that died in the Vietnam War. I chose Sergeant First Class Dale Franklin Rollins from virtualwall.org. Through my research, I discovered he was a member of the 35th Infantry Regiment during his time in Vietnam. I found this group and hoped that I could contact someone who knew Mr. Rollins. I have already contacted his family, but I was hoping to speak with someone who served with him or could give me insight to his life back in Vietnam. Thank you in advance for any information you might have. If you have any information and would like to share with me, please feel free to send me a message on Facebook or email me at nicholas.pfister@student.bridgecityisd.net.

I am trying to get in touch with anyone else who was with Bravo Co. 1/35 on July 3, 1966. My father was in 1st platoon that day James Brassard. Since my fathers passing I have wanted to find out more about that day. I am currently a SSgt in the Marine Corps and I am building a case study on that day but only have Thomas Giorgi's account and what my father had told me. If there is anyone with more information on that day I would love to hear from you. I included my regular email and my work one is matthew.brassard@usmc.mil, phone number is 760-402-7504.

Hi Guys,\n\nAs a principle, we hesitate to use this forum to advertise commercial endeavors. However, an exception must be made for a priceless book on WWII Cacti history written by Perry Ball. Perry's father Wilbur served with George Company, 35th Infantry during the Luzon campaign. The title of the book is \"Sgt Roach's Story\". The book runs to 700 pages and is chock-full of stories/pictures about combat, GI hijinks, and, of particular interest, how many George soldiers fared after the war. Perry does not blink regards stating when mistakes were made, large or small. Many appendices are included that make this book unique from an historical perspective. As well as input from the legendary 35th Bn Co Swede Larsen. I highly recommend this book! Copies of \"Sgt. Roach's Story\" can be obtained by sending a check for $30 per copy to the following address:\n\nPerry E. Ball, 1N567 Golf View Lane, Winfield, IL 60190.\"\n\nDick Arnold -- -- 01/17/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5352. I found your website very interesting and informative, but i didn't find what I was looking for.

Hi fellow Cacti. Wishing everyone a Happy and prosperous New Year. Just wanted to touch base and still post a question about the May 29th contact at Tan Phong 1967 I was in. Is there anyone that remembers Sgt William Silva who was KIA that night? Were you in his squad? As it stands right now I have not found anyone who was in his squad along with me on that night. It looks like I am the last surviving member of his squad. I was hoping that was not the case. This has been hard trying to get closure from that time. I can't believe I am the last man standing from Sgt Silva's squad. If there is anyone that is still alive, but maybe don't want to talk about that night just give me a call at 715-245-0026.\n\nCharles T.Coates(Chuck)SSG Retired US Army -- New Richmond WI -- 01/02/2018\n\nEmail\n\n5347.

The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) announced today that the remains of a U.S. serviceman, recently accounted-for from the Korean War, are being returned to his family for burial with full military honors. Army Pfc. Walter C. Hackenberg, 22, of Snyder County, Pennsylvania, will be buried November 2 in the Middleburg, Pennsylvania. In late April 1951, Hackenberg was a member of Company F, 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division, along a defensive line west of Chorw'on, South Korea, when his unit was attacked by the Chinese People's Volunteer Force (CPVF) and Korean People's Army (KPA.) American troops were able to hold the lines, and when the attacks subsided, a patrol went to determine possible enemy river-crossing points. Enemy forces engaged the patrol with mortars and small arms fire, forcing the patrol to withdraw. Hackenberg could not be accounted for at the end of the battle, and he was declared missing in action as of April 25, 1951. Following the war, several returning American prisoners of war reported that Hackenberg had been captured by the CPVF and died in the summer of 1951 while being held at a prisoner of war camp. Based on this information, the U.S. Army declared him deceased as of Sept. 9, 1951.\n\nIn 1954, United Nations and communist forces exchanged the remains of war dead in what came to be called \"Operation Glory.\" All remains recovered in Operation Glory were turned over to the Army's Central Identification Unit for analysis. On Sept. 7, 1954, a set of remains reportedly recovered from a prisoner of war cemetery at Camp 1 and 3, Changsong, North Korea, were sent to the Central Identification Unit in Kokura, Japan, for attempted identification. The set of remains was designated \"X-14266\" and was transferred to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu and interred as a Korean War Unknown.\n\nAfter a thorough historical and scientific analysis, it was determined that X-14266 could likely be identified. After receiving approval, X-14266 was disinterred on June 13, 2016, and sent to the DPAA laboratory for analysis.\n\nToday, 7,718 Americans remain unaccounted for from the Korean War. Using modern technology, identifications continue to be made from remains that were previously returned by North Korean officials or recovered from North Korea by American recovery teams. Hackenberg's name is recorded on the Walls of the Missing at an American Battle Monuments Commission site along with the others who are missing from the Korean War. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nIf you can attend, please let me know. Thanks...\n\nPeter Birrow B2/35 -- Gulfport -- 10/24/2017\n\nEmail\n\n5250.

PFC Minogue was originally put in for the Congressional Medal of Honor. His award was downgraded to the Distinguished Service Cross. I am working with the Minogue family to ask a military board of corrections to reevaluate the original submission with the hope of upgrading the award to a Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nAs I read the battle it was horrific in nature to say the least. The men of Charlie Company fought valiantly and many were KIA or WIA. CPT Ron Rykowski was severely injured and according to the records it was PFC Minogue's who shielded CPT Rykowski from and onslaught of the enemy and allow him to remain alive and lead the Company. CPT Rykowski was able to call in for indirect fire, close air support, and medivac to evacuate the wounded. PFC Minogue died however, his efforts saved the lives of many in Charlie Company. Unfortunately, it cost him his own life in doing so.\n\nI wish to note that it was CPT Rykowski who provided an eyewitness account and his name was submitted on the original form for PFC Minogue to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
