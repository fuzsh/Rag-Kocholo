        "text": "Capt. George N. Folk, after serving a year as Captain of Company D in the 9th NC Regiment (1st Cavalry), resigned on May 9, 1862. On reaching home he immediately began raising a battalion of six (6) companies over which he was made Lieutenant Colonel on September 12, 1862, back-dated to June 18, 1862, and which was first called Folk's Battalion, then officially styled as the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry in September of 1862. In the Fall of 1862 it was sent to East Tennessee and was actively engaged in the duties of a cavalry command of that much perturbed section. Many incidents of its career cannot now be recalled. On November 20th, it reported 486 present. Vol. 30 Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, P. 412. In December of 1862, it was on service in Carter County, TN. In July of 1863, it was on the raid into Kentucky, Vol. 34, P. 830. The Spring of 1863 it was moving about in East Tennessee and in April was reported \"on scouting and outpost duty\" attached to Col. John S. Scott's Brigade. Vol. 35, p. 793, and in July was in Brig. Gen. John Pegram's (VA) Brigade, same Vol., p. 946. On August 3, 1863, this battalion was combined with the 5th NC Battalion-Cavalry commanded by Major Alfred H. Baird. The regiment thus formed became the 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry) of which George N. Folk became Colonel and Alfred H. Baird became Lieutenant Colonel. The history of that regiment is given in Volume 3 of this work. The account of the 5th NC Battalion-Cavalry up to the date of its consolidation is printed in this volume and it is to be regretted that some one of the command could not do the same for the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry.\n\nThere was another 7th NC Battalion (Reserves) commanded by Major W. Foster French, which was later merged into the 72nd NC Regiment. The battalion numbered 7th in Moore's Roster was not so styled during the war, and was doubtless part of Mallett's (or Hahr's) Battalion, herein styled as the 19th NC Battalion-Infantry on Page 383 herein.\n\n* The above was written by Walter Clark (Editor of the Volume named to the right >>), and provided as Page 301, in the compilation known as \"Histories of the Several Regiments and Battalions from North Carolina in the Great War 1861-'65 - Volume IV,\" edited by Walter Clark, and published by E. M. Uzzell, Printer and Binder, in 1901. Minor edits, additions, and deletions were provided by this Author for clarity and consistency. First called Folk's Battalion NC Cavalry until the line number 7 was assigned in September of 1862, when it became designated as the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry. Originally, there were only five (5) companies since Capt. Folk could not convince Capt. Alfred H. Baird to join under him because Capt. Baird was also in the process of establishing his own battalion, which became the 5th NC Battalion-Cavalry. In November of 1862, Lt. Col. Folk added a sixth company, and a seventh company (Company G) was added in December of 1862, the latter an artillery company.\n\nThe concept of the 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry) was launched in early 1863, but it became a reality on August 3, 1863 per Special Orders No. 183.\n\nLt. Col. George N. Folk organized the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry at Asheville, NC as he mustered the various companies into service in July of 1862. On September 26, 1862, he was ordered to proceeed with three (3) companies to Johnson County, TN to capture or disperse a group of \"disloyals\" who were believed to be gathering at Stone Mountain. On October 13, 1862, he was ordered to proceed with four (4) companies to Johnson County and Carter County to break up a band of Union sympathizers and \"bushwhackers.\" On December 25, 1862, a detachment of the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry was attacked by a band of bushwhackers at Dugger's Ferry on the Watauga River in East Tennessee, with one soldier killed and several wounded. In late December of 1862, the battalion was in Carter County and took part in the move against Brig. Gen. Samuel P. Carter and his raiding party, and they ultimately forced Brig. Gen. Carter to retire.\n\nThe battalion was at Jonesborough, TN on February 20, 1863. On March 19, 1863, it was reported in Brig. Gen. Alfred E. Jackson's (TN) Brigade, with detachments sent to Bristol, Greeneville, Haynesville, and Watauga Bridge. Company A was sent to Cumberland Gap on March 24th, and Company G was at Blountsville. The remainder were at Zollicoffer in Sullivan County, TN in April of 1863.\n\nOn April 27, 1863, the battalion was now assigned to Col. John S. Scott's (LA) Brigade. But, on May 5th, it was ordered to Knoxville to join Brig. Gen. John Pegram (VA). Brig. Gen. Pegram was ordered to go into Kentucky to picket the Cumberland River in Clinton County and Wayne County. The battalion skirmished between Simpson's Ford and Monticello, KY from June 3-9th, and Capt. Carter W. Gillespie of Company D with fourteen (14) men were captured. Three (3) men were lost during a skirmish at Steubenville, between Monticello and Mill Springs. In mid-June, Brig. Gen. Pegram was forced to retire when increased Federal numbers arrived and rumors about a raid on Knoxville was received. On June 19th, a raiding party under Col. William P. Sanders passed through Wartburg two (2) days before destroying supplies, and arrived at the outer defenses of Knoxville. He was forced to withdraw on June 20th and went north. A detachment of the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry followed Col. Sanders through Lenoir's Station and as far as New Market, but did not make contact.\n\nAfter this, the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry was moved to Big Creek Gap and the various companies rotated duty scouting into Kentucky and picketing the numerous gaps in the Cumberland Mountains. On July 31st, minus Company A, the battalion was at Brig. Gen. Pegram's headquarters at Ebenezer, just south of Knoxville. Company A was with Brig. Gen. Archibald Gracie (AL) at Cumberland Gap, where it had been assigned since March 24th. On August 3, 1863, Brig. Gen. Gracie was ordered to concentrate at Strawberry Plains, TN, just north of Knoxville. Company A soon returned to its battalion.\n\nBy Special Order No. 183, Paragraph 16, Adjutant and Inspector General's Office, dated August 3, 1863, the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry was consolidated, along with the 5th NC Battalion-Cavalry, to form the 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry). Because of the military situations already ongoing for each of these battalions, they did not link up immediately. In his \"Roster of North Carolina Troops in the War Between the States (1882), John W. Moore did not recognize this battalion as a separate unit, but he did list the companies of the 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry) on pages 82-106 of Volume IV. However, his numbering was erroneous.\n\nEach of the seven (7) known companies of the 7th NC Battalion-Cavalry were redesignated when they were merged into the 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry) as shown:\n\n7th NC Battalion-Cavalry Company 65th NC Regiment (6th Cavalry) Company Company A Company E Company B Company F Company C 2nd Company G Company D Company C Company E Company D Company F Company A Company G\n\n(artillery) 1st Company G\n\nDisbanded in Dec. '63 / Jan. '64,\n\nMerged into Company C\n\nDirectly above summarized from \"North Carolina Troops 1861-1865, A Roster, Volume II,\" pages 515-516."
