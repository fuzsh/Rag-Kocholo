        "text": "1st Battalion 22nd Infantry\n\n22nd Infantry Dead and Missing of the War of 1812\n\nJune 1812 - February 1815\n\nA Private of Brigadier General Winfield Scott's 1st Brigade of\n\nMajor General Jacob Brown's Left Division of the U.S. Army\n\n1812-1815\n\nThis uniform with the grey jacket was worn by the Soldiers of the 22nd Infantry\n\nas part of General Scott's Brigade on the battlefields at Chippewa and Lundy's Lane.\n\nAs painted by Don Troiani from the book: Don Troiani's Soldiers in America, 1754-1865\n\nPublisher Stackpole Books, 1998\n\nThe following list was compiled using six main sources. Where conflicts existed for an entry\n\nthe Register of Enlistments was used as the final authority for enlisted men and the\n\nOfficial Army Register as the final authority for officers.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the names listed below were found only in the enlistment records\n\nand not in any other sources. Enlistment records were found for all except thirteen of the names.\n\nNot every enlistment record contained a complete set of details for every name.\n\nWhere available in the record such details are given here. Not every\n\ndate or cause of death could be found but is given where known.\n\nUnless indicated as missing all names are to be considered as died.\n\nThere was no uniformity in the original accounts of recording the cause of death.\n\nThe term \"Killed\" always indicated killed in action but the term \"Died\" (without giving\n\na cause of death) could also indicate killed in action or dying of wounds received in action.\n\nOften the original accounts used the phrase \"Dead or missing date unknown\" or \"Dead or\n\nmissing date not known\" and those phrases are repeated here.\n\nNames are listed by last name, first name, middle initial if known, then date of death if known.\n\nNote: The Battle of Lundy's Lane, Canada was fought on July 25, 1814. Contemporary American accounts called the location\n\nBridgewater, Upper Canada and in the Register of Enlistments nearly all references to the battle denote it as Bridgewater,\n\nnot Lundy's Lane. The battle was also sometimes called the Battle of Niagara or the Battle of Niagara Falls. Canadian accounts\n\nand later American accounts use the name Lundy's Lane thus that name is used in these listings to denote the battle in order to\n\navoid any confusion regarding the location.\n\nSources:\n\nRegister of Enlistments in the U.S. Army, 1798-1914;\n\nNational Archives Microfilm Publication M233\n\n(Referred to below as Register)\n\nOfficial Army Registers for 1812, 1813, 1814, 1815\n\nGovernment Printing Office Washington, D.C.\n\n(Referred to below as Official Army Register)\n\nKNOWN MILITARY DEAD DURING WAR OF 1812\n\nCompiled by Ex-Lieut.
