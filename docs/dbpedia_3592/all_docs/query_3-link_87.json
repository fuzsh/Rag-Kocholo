He lived at 95 Collingwood View, North Shields.with two older sisters and a step-brother and step-sister. His father Matthew Snr had also served with the Durham Light Infantry in the First World war (later service with the Machine Gun Corps) Matthew Stapylton snr,was like so many in the area at this time ,often out of work and the family were raised in poverty.\n\nYoung Matthew attended the Queen Victoria school in North Shields from the age of 5 to 14. The family were Methodists and Matthew attended the Wesleyan Memorial Church in North Shields. The only known job he had prior to enlisting on 24th July, 1940, was as a butcher's errand boy. He never married but was engaged to a local girl before he enlisted. Matthew Stapylton was short-sighted and always wore spectacles. The family state that he had other health problems and was initially rejected for military service .\n\nWhilst in training at Morton Hall Camp which is situated at Frogston Road East, Edinburgh Scotland, he was a member of 5 Platoon. One soldier who shared the same tent, Private Thomas Atkinson who was a stretcher bearer with `B`Company 16th D.L.I at the time, remembers Matthew as a \"likeable sort with a good tenor voice\".\n\nThe 16th D.L.I was part of 139 Brigade, 46th Division. On Christmas morning, 1942, the battalion sailed on the SS Staffordshire from Liverpool for North Africa. On 17th January,1943 the battalion relieved the 6th Queens Own Royal West Kent`s positions near Sedjenane, a small mining village in the northern Tell of Tunisia.\n\nThe D.L.I positions were overlooked by the Germans who were dug in on the sides of three hills named 'Greenhill' 'Baldy' and `Sugarloaf`. The Germans attacked in strength on 1st March, 1943 The 16th DLI were ordered to counter-attack at dawn on March 1/2nd, C Company was to advance from their established position on Jobey's Bump'. whilst A and D who had been amalgamated into a composite Company accompanied `B` Company to try and out flank a feature known as Point 231 and Djebel Guerba.\n\nAt 0600hrs Matthew and his Durham Light Infantry comrades pressed home their attack with great determination after initially reaching the top of the hill and taking a number of prisoners the German Parachute engineers opened up from concealed positions with machine guns and very few actually managed to escape the withering fire.Casualties were heavy. 4465668 Pte Matthew Stapylton was killed on the 1/2nd March 1943 he has no known grave and is commemorated on the Medjez-El-Bab Memorial Face 29.\n\nR.S.M Archie Goddard 4435534 2nd Durham Light Infantry.\n\n​4435534 Archibald George Goddard was interested in joining the Army from his earliest years. At the age of 16 he joined the DLI as a Private in a Territorial Battalion. No doubt at the behest of his father who also served with the Durhams He also took up shooting through a miniature rifle club from which he gained three medals, including one depicting Lord Roberts of Khandahar who was instrumental in encouraging the sport of shooting after the Army’s poor record of marksmanship against the Boers during the recent war. Archibald George Goddard enlisted in the Regular Army on his 18th birthday in March 1912, joining 2/DLI in Colchester two days later.\n\nWith the outbreak of war in August 1914 he was posted to the 3/DLI training in Britain until June 1915 when as a Sergeant he rejoined the 2nd Battalion fighting at the Ypres Salient in Flanders. On 9th August the Durhams participated with distinction in the Battle of Hooge Chateau, when it is believed he served with C Company who had the unenviable task of going out under the cover of darkness to hide amongst the dead from previous attacks close to the German lines before assaulting the enemy trenches. The Durhams took their objective after savage hand to hand fighting but were then subjected to German artillery bombardment causing many casualties, including Sgt Goddard who received a scalp wound.\n\nIn April the following year he was posted back to the Training Reserve in Britain followed by attachments to various regiments at home and in Germany, including 1st battalion DLI.\n\nHe rejoined 2nd DLI in January 1921 on its arrival at Ahmednagar in India as CQMS, remaining with the battalion through it’s later postings to Cawnpore in 1923-1924 and Sialkot 1926-1929. Whilst at Sialkot in 1927, the Battalion received orders for an emergency deployment to Shanghai to protect the International Settlement against marauding Chinese armies. They remained there for six months earning popularity and a well deserved reputation amongst both the foreign and Chinese population. Two years after their return from Shanghai to Sialkot 2/DLI moved up to Razmak on the Northwest Frontier where together with other units of the Indian Army they took part in successful operations against the hostile Mahsuds who were engaged in raids against villages and army outposts in the Province during 1931. In 1933 at Barrackpore outside Calcutta\n\nArchibald George Goddard was promoted to Regimental Sergeant Major. The Durhams\n\nfinally sailed from India in early 1937 to spend six months stationed in Khartoum before continuing home to Britain in time for Christmas. The Battalion was then stationed at Inkerman Barracks outside Woking in Surrey.\n\nDuring the 1920s Archibald George Goddard became friendly with Frank McCann a sergeant in the battalion and his family. The McCanns had returned home in 1927 when Frank took his discharge from the Army, but Archie had remained in contact with the family. In 1938 Archie proposed and was accepted by Violet, Frank’s step daughter and they were married in the August. It had been Archibald George Goddard`s intention to retire from the Army and settle down in Sussex but these plans were frustrated by the war clouds which were gathering over Europe.\n\nArchies son Ian was born the following year in May 1939.Four months later war was declared and the 2nd Battalion Durham Light Infantry were on their way to France. With their departure my Mother like the other wives had to vacate the married quarters at Inkerman Barrack and faced the problem of finding somewhere to live. With the threat of the German blitzkrieg and the Luftwaffe bombing of London she decided not to stay with her parents in Putney but found accommodation outside the barracks.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion was heavily engaged in an effort to stem the German breakthrough in Northern France in May 1940 but were finally overrun. Archibald George Goddard was with the Headquarters Company in a barn outside of St Venant. They fought a magnificent rearguard action but with the barn on fire , their ammunition exhausted,and German tanks outside they were forced to surrender in the face of these overwhelming odds . Thus on 27th May for RSM Goddard began five unhappy years as a prisoner of war. The survivors of 2DLI together with other prisoners were force marched with little food and water for five days to reach Cambrai where they were mustered. On 6th June the Germans loaded the prisoners onto rail trucks to begin a journey which ended on 11th June at Stalag XXI BH at Schubin in Poland. Archie was later sent to a stalag at Thure before returning to Schubin in 1941 to take charge of the Red Cross parcels depot. A further transfer later in the year took him to Stalag XXI A at Schilberg, also in Poland, for a period of twelve months. His final move was to Stalag 383 at Hohenfels in Bavaria in September 1942 where he remained for the remainder of the war as Senior British Warrant Officer. He was awarded a Mentioned in Despatches for Distinguished Conduct whilst a POW\n\nRSM Goddard was repatriated back to England on 8th May 1945 arriving at Aylesbury in a Lancaster bomber.The family still possess his box of papers relating to his time as a POW. These include camp rolls, copies of clandestine messages and a diary relating to the rather chaotic period at Stalag 383 in April when the German guards deserted shortly before the camp was relieved by the American Army. During this time Archie recalled a large number of Germans were taken prisoner (probably gave themselves up) including 1 general, 3 colonels, 12 other officers, 186 other ranks plus the Burgermeister from Hohenfels and assorted Hungarians.\n\nRSM Goddard was discharged from the Army at York on 4th March 1946 now ceasing\n\nto fulfil Army physical requirements after serving for 33 years and 2 days.His first civilian job after his discharge was back at Inkerman Barracks where a demobilisation depot had been set up. Later he was employed at the Shaftesbury Homes for Boys School in Bisley, initially to help set up an Army Cadet Unit then acting as a Housemaster and finally as the school Bursar. He retired with his wife Violet to Child Okeford in Dorset in 1959 where they were both actively involved with the Royal British Legion for many years and lived contentedly until Archies death in 1979.\n\n4449017 Pte Syd Walt 2nd Durham Light Infantry\n\nPrivate Syd Walt 4449017 2nd Durham Light Infantry\n\nPte Syd Walt 4449017 also of the 2nd battalion D.L.I Sydney Walt was born in Sunderland in 1913 he was the son of Thomas William Walt a retired poultry farmer , and of Florence Beatrice Walt(nee Younger) the family moved to Hutton Magna, living at Hill Houses, Startforth,Yorkshire after Syd`s enlistment .A pre war regular with the 2nd Battalion The Durham Light Infantry Syd enlisted in 1931 he saw service on the Northwest Frontier and in the Sudan.

This feat did not go un-noticed and `Harry` found himself transferred to `B` Coy and made fitter for the rest of the Battalion transport!,\n\nHarry found himself on the way to Tobruk,before moving to Syria and fought Vichy French and pushed them through Palestine to the Turkish border, until the surrender at Aleppo,Then returned to Egypt,Port Said, then on to Alexandria, in preparation for a move to Malta`Harry` sailed on Friday 13th to Malta onboard the Breckonshire captained by Colin Hutchinson who was quick to acknowledge the part Harry and other DLI soldiers played in relieving the ships crew and manning the machine guns during the almost constant air raids.\n\nA stick of bombs from a Luftwaffe aircraft exploded and blew a hole in the side of the Brackonshire, the order to abandon ship was given (eventually ship was run aground to save the cargo),`Harry` remembered a destroyer which had pulled alongside to save the crew hit a mine and sank,ocean going tugs rescued the survivors and took them into Valetta Harbour, During the DLI`s time on Malta a lot of the time was spent on various guard duties, on one such guard duty in Rabbat `Harry` shot the seat pole out of a bike ridden by Major Dennis Frank Crosthwaite who had been returning from a night on the town and refused to stop at the first checkpoint.

None of the South Africans knew how to sail the boat so Harry offered to sail it as long as Jack and the Greek family were allowed onboard an offer the South Africans reluctantly After an eventful journey in which they had been repeatedly straffed by a German fighter the group arrived in Turkey and were escorted by a Turkish soldier(On promise of payment) to a village up in the Mountains, after a nights rest and a good feed the group set off on their long journey overland to the sea port of Bodrum where they parted from the South Africans and were put on a small craft by members of the SAS.(SBS) bound for Cyprus.

And one of the saddest things I saw then in my lifetime in France and Belgium was the lads that were dead on that mole. I can remember as we were marching along there you could see lads that had been killed and someone had put an overcoat over but you could see their feet and they were just lying on the mole. That was a sad sight.\"\n\nOn its return from Dunkirk, 9 DLI was first sent to the south coast of England on defence duties but, after the threat of a German invasion faded, the battalion sailed for the Middle East in May 1941. On the 1st June 1942, in the Gazala Line, west of Tobruk in Libya, Joseph Clark was seriously wounded and had a leg amputated in a Tobruk hospital.

They were the youngest two children of Thomas William and Elizabeth Swinhoe.\n\nAfter the war broke out Vivian was called up and joined the Durham Light Infantry. His service number was 4460779. He served in France before being sent back to England and then to the Middle East, via Liverpool, aboard a troop ship with the Middle East Forces. He served in the Western Desert with the 1st DLI including ;the Tobruk campaign and General Wavells Libya Campaign.\n\nVivian was twice wounded, once at Fort Capuzzo, Libya, in the battle for the Halfaya Pass, where there were heavy British casualties. His mother, Elizabeth, received several letters between May and November 1941 to advise that he had suffered wounds. The letter of 27th June 1941 said he was wounded on 22nd May of that year, and was in the No. 27 General Hospital, Egypt. Vivian had suffered a gunshot wound to his right arm, causing damage to the radial nerve, in a battle in which 58 men were lost.\n\n​Here is how Vivian described the experience many years later:\n\n“You were asking how I got wounded. Well, the DLI were making their way up the Halfaya Pass (we called it the Hellfire Pass) into Libya, then into a place called Fort Capuzzo. We were there for a couple of days, then the Germans started shelling the Fort, and we made our way out and back down Halfaya Pass.\n\nIt was while waiting for the engineers to blow up the Pass, that I got wounded in the right arm. We lost 58 men that day. The gunshot wound caused paralysis of the radial nerve and I spent nearly a year in the 27th General Hospital, Egypt”.\n\nA very unassuming man, Vivian never mentioned that he was wounded again, in the hand, at which time he performed a very brave and difficult rescue, carrying another wounded man 4 miles from the battlefield to safety. The other man, Jack Raison, of Whitley Bay, was so grateful that he later wrote to Vivian’s mother at her home in Throp Hill, Mitford to express his gratitude for her son’s actions (see Middle-East Section for News Cutting)\n\n​While on light duties recovering from his wounds, Vivian made friends with some German prisoners, one of whom painted a portrait of him, which Vivian treasured all his life. It took pride of place on his dresser in the nursing home in the final months of his life\n\nVivian despite his severe wounds survived the war to return to his home village of Mitford where he lived a long and fulfilling life surrounded by family and friends. He kept in contact with several of his army friends throughout his life. Vivian Swinhoe died on 10th February 2004, in Hepscott, the village where he was born 87 years and 6 months earlier. He is remembered with honour by his niece Mrs Ruth Myers who I thank for her permission to use these items of her uncles for this web-site.\n\nMy thanks also to another of Vivian`s nieces Pat and her husband Malcolm for the additional casualty notifications pictured below.\n\n4037156 WO2 John Thomas Bedford 9th Durham Light Infantry\n\nJohn Thomas Bedford was born in Worksop in 1916, and worked as a butcher prior to his enlistment at Shrewsbury in 1940.Initially he served with The Kings Shropshire Light Infantry prior to his transfer to the `Durhams` He served with the 9th Battalion Durham Light Infantry in North Africa where he was wounded during the fierce battles around the Mareth Line after a period of convalescence he rejoined the 9th DLI in Sicily .CSM Bedford was part of `D` Company when the DLI splashed ashore on D-Day remaining with the battalion until the end of the war in Berlin.

Just prior to his capture Pte Storey was wounded in the leg. Henry`s interrogation by the Germans revealed he was a fluent French speaker and it was because of this that he was not sent directly to an Italian run Prisoner of War camp but was used by the Germans for a time as an interpreter in Tobruk. Pte Storey then had stays in many PoW camps .The first was Campo 82 Laterina Italy from Sept 1942-43 (All responsibility for PoWs captured in the Western Desert was passed to the Italians) Campo Concentratomento P.G.82 was situated near Laterina in Italy. The camp was organised into huts about 40 yards long and 8 yards wide. The bunk beds were in blocks of nine, that is three on the top, three in the middle and three on the bottom.The treatment of Prisoners was not good in these camps with many PoW`s suffering from the lack of basic medical attention caused by the shortage of supplies available.\n\nFollowing the Italians capitulation Pte Storey was transferred to German run camps listed below;\n\nStalag 8c at Sagen,Germany from 10th July 1943-20th October 1944,\n\nStalag 8B Techen October 44-Jan 45 employed in coal mining Arbeitskommandos\n\n(Work Camps) coming under Stalag VIIIB at Teschen.)\n\nStalag 4C Tepelitz (Stalag 4C was a POW Camp at Sudentenland Treibstoff Werke, Wistritz bei Teplitz near Brüx (now called Most) in Czechoslovakia, where fuel was synthesized from brown coal and many of the POWs including Pte Storey worked in the mines\n\nThe final camp appears to be that of Stalag 13B Weiden from March-April 1945.Each main camp had several `work camps` Pte Storey listed on a PoW return form that he worked at several including those at Mechtal (Poland) Oct 43-Feb 1944 working in the Iron works, Satern (?)
