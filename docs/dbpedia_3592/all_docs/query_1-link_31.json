        "text": "Adjutant General's Report\n\nThe Ninth Regiment of Cavalry was organized at Camp Douglas, near Chicago, Illinois, in the autumn of 1861, by Colonel Albert G. Brackett, ans was mustered into the United States service by November 30.\n\nOn the 16th of February, 1862, it started from Chicago and proceeded by rail to Benton Barracks, near St. Louis, Missouri, and thence to Pilot Knob. From there it marched to Reeve's Station, on the Big Black River, and was assigned to the Third Brigade of General Steele's Division, serving in the District of Southeast Missouri.\n\nFrom Reeve's Station it marched to Jacksonport, Arkansas, where Colonel Brackett was left in command, the other portion of the Division moving on to Batesville, where it joined the Army of the southwest, under the command of Major General S. R. Curtis.\n\nOn the 21st of May Private P. W. Pringle, of Company F, was murdered in cold blood by the rebels and his body left lying in a swamp near Jacksonport. On the 24th the Regiment crossed the Black River and encamped in the woods.\n\nMay 28, five companies, under Lieutenant Colonel Hiram F. Sickles, had a skirmish with the Confederates at Cache River Bridge, routing them with considerable loss. In this affair Battalion Adjutant Blackburn and Private Tift were wounded.\n\nCaptain Blakemore had a skirmish on the same day on the Augusta road, with portions of three companies of the Ninth, against a Confederate force, in which two confederate soldiers were captured, one of whom was very severely wounded.\n\nUpon the approach of the Confederate gunboat Maurepas, Captain Joseph Fry, the Ninth fell back two miles and a half, when the vessel shelled its late camp with 64 pounders. This was on the second of June. As soon as the boat retired the Regiment went back to its former camp.\n\nThe Confederate soldiers on the 12th of June attempted to capture a valuable train near the Waddell farm, five miles from Jacksonport, but were utterly defeated and driven off by Colonel Brackett with two companies of Missouri cavalry and four companies of the Ninth, with a loss of twenty-eight killed, wounded and missing. Our loss was thirteen wounded and missing.\n\nCaptain Marland L. Perkins with his company made a reconnaissance toward Augusta, down the right bank of White River, in June, and had two skirmishes with the enemy in which a Confederate soldier was killed and he had one horse killed and two wounded. He returned to camp June 23.\n\nAgain on the 27th of June, 1862, a large force of the enemy attacked a government train near Stewart's plantation; it was beaten off with severe loss, and the valuable train saved. On our side two were killed and thirty-one wounded, among the latter being Colonel Brackett, Major Wallis, Battalion Adjutant Blackburn and Captain Knight. Five of the enemy's dead were seen on the ground.\n\nThis was the day after the Regiment had started on the march for Helena, with the whole of General Curtis' Army. During the march five men of the Regiment died from hardships, it being almost impossible to obtain water. This was one of the most famous marches of the civil war.\n\nAt Helena the Regiment was assigned to the Third Brigade, Colonel Cyrus Bussey, of General A. P. Hovey's Division, District of Southeastern Arkansas, commanded by General Steele.\n\nThe Regiment received two small 12 pounder howitzers on the 15th of September, which being placed under command of Lieutenant E. G. Butler, with details from various companies, rendered excellent service.\n\nAt the fight at La Grange, Arkansas, two companies of the Regiment, with soldiers of other regiments, under Captain Marland L. Perkins, with two howitzers just referred to, behaved very gallantly against a considerable force of the enemy; he losing over fifty men, while our loss was inconsiderable. This was on the 8th of November. The command also repulsed a charge of two regiments of Texans.\n\nDuring the night of October 11, a part of the Regiment captured a rebel picket of twelve men near Helena, Arkansas.\n\nBrigadier General C. C. Washburn led an expedition, composed of parts of several cavalry regiments, from Helena across the Mississippi River in the State of Mississippi, during part of November and December, 1862. He had a skirmish with the enemy at Okolona, on the 6th of November and at Coffeeville on the 7th, in both of which he was successful and accomplished the main object of his expedition, which was to give the leaders of the rebel forces an idea that his troops were the advance guard of a large Union army sent to cut off the retreat of General Price and his rebels from their position. Price believed it and left accordingly. In Washburn's command Major Henry B. Burgh had one hundred and fifty men of the Ninth Illinois Cavalry.\n\nJanuary 9, 1863, the Ninth marched with General Gorman's command from Helena to Duvall's Bluff and returned. On the 7th of April, it moved up the Mississippi River to Memphis, Tennessee, and on the 12th to Germantown, where it was assigned to McCrill's Brigade of Cavalry of the Sixteenth Army Corps. It was engaged with the enemy at Coldwater, Miss., July 28, and at Grenada August 18, and moved to La Grange, Tenn., August 26. Made an attack upon the enemy at Salem, Miss., October 13, and after fighting all day the rebels fell back and retreated during the night.\n\nNovember 8, moved from La Grange to Corinth, and returned soon afterward. Marched to Colliersville, and was assigned to the Second Brigade Cavalry Division of the Sixteenth Army Corps. Was engaged with the enemy at Saulsbury, Tennessee, and on the 4th the Division, under command of General Grierson, was engaged at Moscow, Tenn. In the fight the Ninth took a conspicuous part.\n\nIn January, 1864, the Regiment was in the Second Brigade, commanded by Colonel Albert G. Brackett, of Grierson's Division, Sixteenth Corps, Army of Tennessee, at Colliersville, and detachment under Major Ira Gifford had a brisk skirmish with a portion of Forrest's command, which had made an attack upon the Memphis and Charleston railroad, in which several of the enemy were killed and wounded.\n\nFebruary 11, 1864, the Regiment moved out by order of General Sherman against the enemy, with the Union force organized under General William Sooy Smith, Chief of Cavalry of the Division of the Mississippi, with a view to overthrow the rebel cavalry under General Forrest. He pushed across the country as rapidly as possible, crossed the Tallahatchie River at New Albany without opposition and moved on to Okolona, on the Mobile and Ohio railway, meantime having been engaged with the enemy at West Point on the 20th of February, at Okolona on the 21st and Mount Ivy on the 23d. While a portion of the command was sent to threaten Columbus the main body moved on, destroying an immense amount of corn, cotton, and other stores of great value to the Confederates. The Regiment returned to and encamped at Germantown on the 24th of February. Although the chief object of the expedition was not accomplished, the cavalry had inflicted heavy injuries upon the Confederates.\n\nOn the 16th of March the Regiment was mustered as a veteran organization, and the following day marched to Memphis, whence the men returned to Illinois, on the usual furlough granted to veterans.\n\nApril 27, the men of the Regiment returned to Memphis from furlough, and a short time thereafter a portion of them accompanied General Sturgis on his expedition against the enemy. At Guntown, Miss., on the 10th of June, our forces met with a severe check and were obliged to give way. The Ninth formed a portion of the rear guard, losing five killed, twenty-three wounded and twelve captured out of one hundred and sixty men.\n\nUpon the failure of this expedition another, under General Andrew J. Smith, was fitted out and marched from Saulsbury to Pontotoe where a fight occurred on the 11th of July, and meeting the enemy in force near Tupelo another action took place, the confederates being driven from the field, leaving a large number of dead and wounded comrades. The next day, July 15, a severe cavalry fight occurred at Old Town Creek, where the Ninth acquitted itself with credit, and afterwards returned to Memphis.\n\nIn August the Regiment marched by way of Holly Springs to Abbeville, Miss., where it had a skirmish with the enemy, and on the 11th had another brush at Oxford. A severe fight took place at Hurricane Creek, the Ninth taking an honorable share, losing four killed and several wounded. It returned to its station at Memphis September 4.\n\nWith Captain William C. Blackburn in command the Regiment moved out again on the 30th of September, and, after crossing the Tennessee River at Clifton, marched by way of Waynesboro, Lawrenceburg, Florence, Ala., Waterloo, Hamburg, and Savannah to Cifton, pursuing the rebels under General Wheeler. The command returned again to Florence, and there met the advance of General Hood's Army. The Division to which the Ninth was attached did some hard fighting at Shoal Creek, Ala., on the 9th of November. On the 19th of the same month crossed the river and two days afterward attacked the enemy near Lawrenceburg, Tenn., the Ninth Illinois Cavalry being in the advance. Two Divisions on the enemy coming up compelled it to recross the river, and, in so doing, one battalion became detached, passed through the rebel line, and was compelled to remain in the rear of the enemy until, under the cover of darkness, it recrossed the stream and joined its friends.\n\nFor several days after this the Regiment skirmished with the enemy's advance and at Campbellville, Tenn., on the 24th of November was hotly engaged. Here it kept its ground holding back many times its own number of rebels until its ammunition was entirely exhausted, when the men fought the confederates hand to hand, clubbing their carbines and doing much to retard their march.\n\nThe Ninth took part in the fierce battle of Franklin, Tenn., on the 30th of November, 1864, and did what was in its power toward crippling the Confederate army under General Hood. This battle was pronounced by Secretary Stanton as the bloodiest of the war in proportion to the numbers engaged.\n\nAt the great battles of Nashville on the 15th and 16th of December, the Regiment belonged to the Second Brigade of the Fifth Division of the Cavalry Corps, and sustained its well earned reputation for valor. It participated in a well directed charge upon a redoubt occupied by the enemy, which it carried and at the same time captured four pieces of artillery and took one hundred and fifty prisoners, sharing in the final rout of the enemy.\n\nSoon the Army of General Hood was in full retreat and the Ninth participated in the chase which resulted in its destruction, skirmishing with portions of it at Brentwood, on the Franklin pike, near Franklin, at Rutherford's Creek and Ross' Farm. The roads had now become impassable, the rivers were filled to the tops of the banks, and the enemy could not be followed any farther. The dispirited foe was driven across the Tennessee River on the night of 27th of December, and it being impossible to supply our army the campaign was closed with the closing of the year. General Thomas, in his order respecting these military movements, said: \"Although short the campaign has been brilliant in its achievements, and unsurpassed in its results by any other of this war, and is one of which all who participated therein may be justly proud.\" The command moved to Huntsville, Florence, Eastport and Gravelly Springs. There not being a sufficient number of horses to mount all the cavalry, Hatch's Division was deprived of its animals, which were turned over to the other Division preparatory to their march farther south, and in consequence the Ninth was dismounted and left at Eastport on the 9th of February, 1865. As horses could be obtained the Regiment was again supplied and marched to Iuka, Miss., on the 23d of June, and thence to Decatur, Ala., July 4. From there it went to Montgomery, Selma and Ainesville, and was finally mustered out of service at Selma, Alabama, on the 31st of October, 1865, and ordered to Springfield, Ill., where the men received final payment and discharge.\n\nThe organization as a whole had done good service, and always bore a fine reputation. Through swamps and across rivers it had followed the enemy, amid the heat of summer and snows of winter, and was entitled to the thanks of the State, as well as the gratitude of the Federal Government. To have participated in the Arkansas and Nashville campaigns, and received the thanks of Generals Curtis and Thomas, was something to be proud of and reflected honor upon Illinois.\n\nCol. Albert Gallatin Brackett\n\nAs already mentioned, cpl.Dandy has found one perfect photo of Col. Brackett at one auction (see the title photo in sub-menu of this section), but he also found the grave site of the Colonel - founder of 9th Illinois Cavalry Regiment. Thanks to this we know at least basic data. It is a quite strange, that the Illinois State Archive was unable to provide such information. So after one year from finding of our first photo of Col. Brackett ever by pvt. Guma, we have got next piece to the puzzle of history.\n\nBorn: 14th February 1829 in Cherry Valley, Otsego County, New York.\n\nDied: 25th June 1896 in Washington, Columbia.\n\nBuried 25th June 1896 in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, state Virginia.\n\nRetired in rank of United States Army Colonel\n\nHe took a part in Indian Wars of 1855 - 1861 and 1868 - 1879.\n\nWife: Rose McHenry Brackett (her birthdate is missing – died 8th January 1912).\n\nSource: Find A Grave, Records of Living Officers of the United States Army (1884), Fort Davis (Texas) - www-article, Arlington National Cemetery (ANC) webpage.\n\nDescription of grave location:\n\nArlington National Cemetery\n\nArlington County\n\nVirginia, USA\n\nlocation: Section SSIDE, No. 1052\n\nThe National Tribune, 2 Jul 1896, Thu, First Edition\n\nCzech National Cemetery in Chicago\n\nIn the year 1877 the Czech National Cemetery was found in Chicago and then in the year 1892 the monument dedicated to Czech soldiers involved in American Civil War was erected.\n\nThe cornerstone of The Civil War Monument, originally called the Bohemian Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, was laid on July 28, 1899 and dedicated on May 29, 1892. Designed by artist, Joseph Klir, the bronze statue represents a private soldier in full fatigue uniform, holding a flag in his left hand and a musket with bayonet in his right. The base inscription is \"PRO NOVOU VLAST” - for the new country. The memorial cost was $5,035.\n\nGatehouse\n\nGatehouse - rear view\n\nDennis C. Schurr Collection - very interesting documents\n\nDuffy, I thank you and your friends for preserving the history of the 9th Illinois Cavalry Regiment in the Czech Republic. My 2nd great-grandfather was John G. Schurr and lived in Coral, Illinois and was a carpenter by trade. He served in Company C. under the command of Captain Smith A. Davison. John was demobilized on 31 October 1865 with the regiment in Selma, Alabama, where they had been ordered to board the trains to Springfield, Illinois for final termination of service. On November 10, 1865 the cars arrived and the soldiers were immediately assigned to Camp Butler. After eight days they were paid by the Paymaster General and finally mustered out of service. John departed for his long journey home, but died of pneumonia along his way, never to see his wife and newborn son. Captain Smith A. Davison later testified in behalf of my 2nd great-grandmother to help her win her war pension. I have included two images of Smith A. Davison. You can use any of the attachments from my collection for your website. I am also sending you two rare pictures of Colonel Albert G. Brackett standing dressed in his frock coat and Lieutenant colonel S. A. Paddeck wearing his cavalry sash and saber.\n\nCaptain Smith A. Davison Company C\n\nCommanding Pvt. John G.

Schurr:\n\n,,Twenty years after being mustered out, the regiment had it's 1st Reunion in Chicago, September, 28th & 30th, 1886. Two very important issues were discussed, the first being a design for their veterans badge. Since they carried Sharp carbines and were in the 16th Corp, it was decided to combine the two. The second was to consider publishing a regimental history. The first moved very quickly and were made available before the second reunion. (See attachments) At the 2nd Reunion, again it was brought up to write and publish a regimental history. After much discussion a History Committee was formed, nominating Lieutenant Edward A. Davenport as Historian. The committee, first were going to contact one of the veterans that had written a history to review it and get his approval to use and publish before the next reunion, however they were un able to make contact after many attempts. Edward A. Davenport suggested that they start from scratch, additional members were added to the committee. Mailing request were sent out immediately to the members asking them for stories and images. This project became a labor of love for the committee and was completed prior to their next reunion in 1888.\"\n\nPay voucher for Col. A. G.

Stephenson. It was the largest organization of Union veterans of the Civil War The organization promoted comradeship among veterans, worked to increase pensions and assist war widows and orphans, and maintained homes for old soldiers.\n\nIn 1868, the commander in chief of the GAR and Civil War General John Alexander Logan inaugurated the observance of Memorial Day to honor fallen soldiers. Membership in the staunchly Republican organization peaked at more than 409,000 in 1890. The last member died in 1955, and the GAR was discontinued in 1956.\n\nUniform Henry H.

B. Burgh had done for them and the confidence and esteem in which he was held, to present him in behalf of the company a dress sword, and for this purpose one hundred dollars had been subscribed by the members of Company A. By some means the Captain learned of this movement, and not thinking the proper thing at this time, he called his company together, and stated to them that he had learned of their intention and that while he appreciated, he must discourage their carrying it out, and requested the return the money back to the donors, at the same time giving as his reasons “That he was yet untried, and they did not know but in the actual contact with the enemy he might run away or even at the present time grow faint hearted, and thus bring disgrace upon the sword they proposed to present.” Stating further, that it was his judgement that a presentation of any kind should not be made until a soldier had by his acts shown himself to be worthy of the same.\n\nThe members of Company A, deference to their captain’s wishes, abandoned the presentation at that time, but it seems that they did not forget their desire. The years of the war passed on, Captain Burgh became Major and Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment, and in every position he was placed, showed himself to be a gallant and brave officer, and had much of the time been in command of the regiment. His rare and brilliant soldierly qualities were appreciated by all, but by none more than his old Company A, who all these years had been watching him, and were proud of him as a soldier and their old Captain.\n\nWhen the regiment went north on veteran furlough in the spring of 1864, they stopped in St. Louis, and Company A determined to carry out their long-cherished plan of presentation to their old Captain. They\n\npurchased an elegant saber, belt etc., and after their arrival at Rock Island, on the morning of March 25th, the company sent for Colonel Burgh to come to the Island City Hotel. Were, in an earnest and affectionate address, they presented him with their elegant testimonial. This time Colonel Burgh was at their mercy, and accepted the sword in a grace-full manor, thanking the boys in an affectionate language for their gift, and the kindly feeling that prompted them in their offering.\n\nMustered in September 18, 1861 as Captain of Company A, Promoted Major, August 16, 1862, Promoted Lieutenant-Colonel, December 10, 1863.\n\nDecorative Saber Handle Jeweled Pommel\n\nDecorative Scabbard Presentation\n\nSword Presentation to Major A.

Just on the back of the town on the high table land on the bluffs lying was the beautiful plantation of Confederate General Hindmans, now one of the several Hospitals established to care for the regiments sick and wounded. In early August 1862, Dr. Charles Brackett of the 9th Illinois Cavalry wrote his wife about the hospitals in Helena “. . . by the time I had finished was thoroughly used up. It was the hottest day of the season when even the acclimated citizens kept [to] the house.” The heat in the summer months spawned insects and generated dust. Contaminated water caused diarrhea. When the rains began, the dust turned to mud.\n\nA number of men had been wounded in engagements with Confederates and partisans on the march through Arkansas. All were weak from weeks of fighting heat, thirst, insects and reptiles. Many became ill soon after they arrived in Helena. No matter the cause, their condition was made worse by the lack of proper hospital facilities.\n\nA man named Curtis worked for Dr. Charles Brackett, a surgeon in the 9th Illinois Cavalry, who wrote his wife, “The old negro Curtis is putting things ‘to rights’ in the tent, sweeping in front with a few twigs tied together with string and with this he makes things look neat.”\n\nMost freedom seekers wanted more than work, they wanted to better themselves, to learn to read and write—skills that had long been denied to them and that would be necessary to survive and prosper as free people. They wanted their children to attend school. One Union soldier observed that the Freedmen were, “. . . using all means to improve their condition, enquiring diligently after spelling books, etc. . . .”\n\nOx cart and grocery store Helena 1862\n\nThomas, Bankes Photo Gallery Helena 1862\n\nFort Curtis Helena 1862\n\nFlat boat picket duty Helena 1864\n\nHelena 1864\n\nLast Cavalry Campaign of the Civil War\n\nMarch – April 1865 – photos\n\nChosen by General Grant, General James H. Wilson would lead one of the largest cavalry campaigns of the Civil War. Wilson would assemble over 13,500 troopers that would sweep through the South’s remaining primary manufacturing facilities and would be opposed unsuccessfully by a much smaller force under the command of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest of about 2,500 men.\n\nWhile planning for this campaign, General Wilson assessed all of his assets and determined that each cavalryman would be armed with the formidable 7-shot Spencer repeating rifle and would be riding the best mounts.\n\nOn March 18, 1865, General Order Number 24 was read:\n\n“The Major General commanding takes great pleasure in announcing to the cavalry corps, that the officers and men of the Second Iowa, Sixth and Ninth Illinois, have with a spirit of generosity, excelled only by their gallantry, voluntary turned over to the First Division a large number of Spencer carbines, taking in exchange an equal number of inferior arms of various patterns; this too, they had been compelled to turn over their horses to the Seventh Division and other detachments. Such an exhibition of zeal for the interest of the public service, of self-denial, and of friendly regard for their brothers in arms, is unparalleled, and entitles the brave men who have so cheerfully made it, to the thanks and admiration of every soldier in the corps. Troops who have distinguished themselves by so many acts of gallantry has adorned the history of the Fifth Division could have made no greater sacrifice. They are entitled to the best remount, equipment, and arms the country can furnish and every effort will be made to secure them in time to enable them to participate in the events of the ensuing campaign. “ This order will be read to every regiment in the Fifth Division. By the Command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, [Signed]\n\nE. B. Beaumont\n\nMajor and Assistant Adj. General\n\nThe 27 year Wilson, known as the old boy general conceived a plan to send his cavalry through Alabama and Georgia on a raid that would help to drive the final nail into the South’s cause. He believed that this raid would prove once and for all the validity and strength of the underused mounted arm of the union forces. “The horse is primary factor in the cavalry. Through him, the cavalry can move faster, gets there quicker, covers longer distance in less time, finds the weaker places in the enemy lines, strikes the flank or rear or breaks his means of communication and supply.”\n\nAnd so began Wilson’s month long campaign to destroy war resources and prevent the South from staging their last stance.\n\nThe initial target of the campaign was Selma, Alabama, and Wilson struck so hard, so fast and with so many men that not even General Nathan Bedford Forrest was able to hold him back. Forrest skirmished and fought with Wilson as he pushed down through the Alabama iron country to Selma, but was unable to assemble enough men to halt the Union advance.\n\nAs he moved forward, Wilson destroyed many of the iron furnaces of Alabama. These industrial complexes had supplied the Confederacy with thousands of tons of iron for use in manufacturing cannon, artillery projectiles, cookware and more.\n\nForrest turned on Wilson at what is now Stanton, 24 miles north of Selma, to fight his last battle on ground of his own choosing. The Battle of Ebenezer Church ended in a Union victory, but not before Forrest had killed 33 men who fell before the general's pistols and saber during the engagement.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Selma and the destruction of the industrial complex in that city, Wilson turned east and captured the capital city of Montgomery virtually without firing a shot.\n\nFrom Montgomery, Wilson continued east for Georgia. One column of his force captured West Point, Georgia, while the other fought the last major battle of the war at Columbus, Georgia.\n\nSelma’s arsenal contained, among other things, 15 siege guns, 60,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, and 1 million rounds of small arms ammunition. Wilson destroyed the city's eleven ironworks and foundries, which had produced war goods for the Confederacy, as well as locomotives and rail cars, thus depriving the Confederacy of one of its last reliable industrial centers.\n\nMoreover, Forrest's cavalry would harass Wilson's forces no more. In a meeting between Forrest and Wilson, Forrest reputedly said to Wilson, \"Well, General, you have beaten me badly, and for the first time I am compelled to make such an acknowledgement.\"\n\nWilson organized cavalry patrols to capture fleeing Confederate leaders and to obtain the surrender of any bands of Confederates still roaming Alabama and Georgia. On May 10, 1865, a group of Wilson's men captured the former president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, at Irwinville in South Georgia. Groups of Wilson's men also captured or arrested former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens, Georgia governor Joseph E. Brown, Georgia senator Benjamin Hill, and the infamous Henry Wirz, commandant of Andersonville prison. Wilson's forces were fully disbanded by early July.\n\nPrivate Benjamin Frank Price\n\nBenjamin was a farmer until he joined Company M. of the Ninth Illinois Cavalry, along with his older brother George A. Price. He was mustered into the regiment on August 28, 1862, and his residence was Onarga, Iroquois County, Illinois. He served for three years and participated in several skirmishes and one battle. While serving in Sturgis's division in the battle at Guntown, Mississippi on June 10, 1864, he was struck by a musket ball in the left arm. He subsequently rode to Memphis, Tennessee, a distance of 125 miles, where he had his arm amputated on June 13, 1864. He had nothing to eat during the entire journey.\n\nPrivate Dwight L. Talcott, Company I\n\nAt the Battle of Campbellsville, Tenn., November 24, 1864, was taken prisoner and was sent to Andersonville. When Talcott entered the prison he weighed 147 pounds. When he was released he weighed but 75 pounds and his father, who called for him, was forced to carry him in his arms like a baby. The doctors at the prison were of the opinion that Talcott would never live until he reached his Rockton home. He was mustered out of service June 3, 1865 as a prisoner of war.\n\nRoll of Honor\n\nPrivate Adrian, Frederick., Company E.

Died about July 1, 1864, in a rebel prison at Okolona, Miss.\n\nAndersonville Prison\n\nAndersonville Prison (also known as Camp Sumter) was one of the largest confederate prison camps during the Civil War. Over the course of 14 months, 45,000 Union soldiers passed through the prison and nearly 13,000 of them died from conditions like diarrhea, dysentery and starvation. When Harper’s Weekly published photos of prisoners after the war, Americans were shocked to see the POWs reduced to skin and bones.\n\nThe 16-acre prison opened in Andersonville, GA, in February of 1864, intended to hold 10,000 prisoners. By June, the population had ballooned to twice that size. “Place so full can Scarcely Walk,” wrote one miserable prisoner. Confederates hastily built an extra ten acres, but the prison was still overcrowded and low on resources. Food was especially scarce; a typical daily meal for the prisoners was a slice of cornbread and a paltry piece of pork and the food was often rotten. “This is no other than a place of Starvation – a disgrace to any Government,” the same prisoner wrote.\n\nMany POW’s lacked basic shelter and clothing to protect them from the elements. “A good many tore up their underclothes, drawers, &c., and\n\nsewed them together and managed to make a little shelter,” recounted a prisoner. Despite rampant conditions like scurvy and gangrene, medical supplies were in short supply. “Many undressed wounds were fly-blown and swarming in maggots,” wrote an imprisoned Union captain.\n\nPrisoners didn’t just die from disease, they were also killed if they crossed “the deadline,” a line of wooden posts that stood about 19 feet from the stockades. Prisoners who ventured beyond this line were liable to be shot by guards. Some men desperate to end their misery, intentionally stepped over the line.\n\nAfter the war, Captain Henry Wirz, the commandant at Andersonville Prison, was found guilty of “conspiring to impair and injure the health and destroy the lives of federal prisoners” and “murder in violation of the laws of war.” Many prisoners testified against him, though some supporters argued that he was a scapegoat who was merely following orders. Either way, he was hanged at Capitol prison on November 10, 1865.\n\nRemembering the backbone of the Civil War"
