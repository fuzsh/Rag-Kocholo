His application for a pension was rejected because he could not prove service for six months.[3]\n\nAround 1780, he married Elizabeth Robinson.[4][2] The children of Andrew and Elizabeth Henderson were:[2][5]\n\nMary (1784-1845), m. ___ Alexander\n\nCarnes Harvey (1787-1845)\n\nNancy (1788-1856)\n\nMargaret (1791-1871)\n\nDavid Robinson (1793-1846), m.

Burch Chesheir\n\nHarriet (1804-1882), m. ___ Alexander\n\nThe Hendersons lived in Mecklenburg, North Carolina. Andrew was there when he entered the militia service, and the census confirms he was there in 1790, 1800, 1810, and 1830.[6][7][8][9]\n\nOn 12 Aug 1835, he wrote his last will and testament, naming his wife Elizabeth and children Mary Alexander, David R.
