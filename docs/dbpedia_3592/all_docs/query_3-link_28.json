        "text": "I would be grateful for any help or advice in researching my paternal Grandfather, Richard (dob 20/11/1887).\n\nAlthough his medals show him as in the Essex Regiment, his medal card shows 2 other regiments, namely the Northamptonshire (204900) and Beds & Herts (68124).\n\nHe lived till 1966 but little is known in the family of where he was or what he did, it is alleged he was a bandsmen.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.\n\nHe will have first landed in a war zone with Essex,15 (Garrison Guard) Battalion according to his service number,in May 1918,under orders of 177 Brigade of 59 Division.\n\nAt some time he returned to the UK and transferred to 4 Battalion Northamptonshire,a Reserve unit. Later,and the unusual title may give a clue as it's an amalgam of two Regiments,he was posted to what I think was 1/1 Battalion Hertfordshire Regiment as they took some 600 men from 6 Battalion Bedfordshire,the remnants of that Battalion after a battle,and likely came under orders of 112 Brigade of 37 Division in France.\n\nCan't check this as there is no service or pension record apparent,but it makes sense. The order of the Battalions on the MIC usually reflects the sequence of units served.\n\nHaving looked at the group of men (numbered 204900-204975) apparently transferring to the Northamptonshire Regiment at this time there appears to have been a consistent pattern of movements. These were roughly as follows:\n\nEnlisted under the \"Derby Scheme\" (the voluntary deferred mobilisation scheme) in November/December 1915.\n\nMobilised in mid-1916\n\nPosted to 4th Reserve Battalion of the Essex Regiment for training.\n\nPosted to 65th Provisional Battalion after a few weeks.\n\n65th Provisional Battalion converted to 15th Battalion of the Essex Regiment on 1st January 1917.\n\nWhen the Territorial Force soldiers received new numbers in March 1917 they received numbers from the 15th Battalion's allocation of numbers.\n\nUpon being ordered overseas they transferred to the 9th Battalion of the Essex Regiment on 16th July 1917 (no number change involved)\n\nThe group embarked to France on 16th July 1917.\n\nThe group arrived at No 15 Infantry Base Depot on the French coast and was held there awaiting a Regiment and battalion in need of their numbers.\n\nThey were posted to the 2nd Battalion of the Northamptonshire Regiment, triggering a number change (the No. 204900-204975 range I mentioned above) on 12th August 1917.\n\nThe earlier events in the sequence may be different for Richard Whittington, but the units and events from March 1917 will I believe be the same for him as those above. On looking at other service records, my feeling is that Richard Whittington's Essex Regiment service was from the earlier mid-1916 period rather than later.\n\nLooking at the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment number, the records of John Joseph Henderson (No. 68127) suggest that the transfer was made in March 1919, and may have been made from the 1st Battalion Northamptonshire Regiment to the 53rd Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment who were both part of the British Army of Occupation in 1919.\n\nThe move from 2nd to 1st battalion of the Northamptons does make sense as the 2nd Battalion came to an absolute full stop on 27th May 1918 when the whole battalion was captured at the Chemin des Dames. So, it may be that he transferred from 2nd to 1st Battalions of the Northamptonshire Regiment between August 1917 and May 1918. I will give this some thought!\n\nSteve."
