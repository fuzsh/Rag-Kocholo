        "text": "Lofton Henderson was born in Cleveland, Ohio on 24 May 1903, and raised in Lorain by Fred and Catherine Henderson. He attended and graduated from local schools, and earned a place at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis at the age of eighteen. By the time he graduated in 1926, his reputation as a heartthrob was second only to his notoriety for tardiness. “In the course of his extensive experiments to determine the least possible seconds that could be spent in dressing and reaching formation on time, Joe hung up the record of thirteen ‘Lates To Formation in one week,” recorded his yearbook biography. “But, all joking aside, despite the fact that he’ll keep you waiting three minutes for every two that you spend in his company, still he does make a good roommate.”\n\n“Schmaltz is a handsome devil in his blonde Swedish way. Incidentally, he objects to being called Swedish; says anybody ought to know good “scotch” when he sees it! But, as we were saying, the women do fall for him (awful fools, women). He writes to seven girls and calls each one ‘Dearest!'”\n\nOn May 22, 1926, Henderson and a handful of classmates were appointed as Second Lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps and assigned to basic flight training; however, most had their flight status revoked after only three months, and were diverted to other specialties. A broken leg disqualified “Joe” Henderson from flying status; he was sent to Rhode Island, and spent several months at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, before receiving new orders for classes at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. His course, the “Basic Class,” lasted from late February to mid-July of 1927; following graduation, Henderson was granted a brief furlough before reporting to the Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York.\n\n“China Duty” was a rite of passage for an aspiring Marine officer in the years between the Banana Wars and Pearl Harbor, a genuine “Asiatic Station” where one could cultivate command experience and sea stories almost at will. The Brigade, including parts of the 4th and 6th Marines (which eventually absorbed Henderson’s platoon) helped provide security for Shanghai’s International Settlement. Tensions occasionally ran high between the Chinese and the foreigners – the Hankow Incident was a recent memory – but, although they maintained vigilance for riots, the Marines were never compelled to draw weapons. Duty quickly settled into a more or less peaceable routine.\n\nEvidently, Joe Henderson was thinking about flying while in China. On 28 April 1928, he was excused from normal duties to take a physical with the flight surgeon at Camp McMurray; the following month, he assumed the temporary duty of company reconnaissance officer. He must have shown promise, for on 11 July Henderson received orders releasing him from the 6th Marines, boarded the USS Chaumont at Taku Bar, and set sail for San Francisco and duty with Observation Squadron 8-M.\n\nNaturally, Henderson needed more than passion before being allowed in the cockpit. The observation squadron put him through pre-flight training, then shipped him across the country to the Naval Air Station at Pensacola. Flight school was probably Henderson’s toughest trial to date; every month, a handful of hopeful young officers “washed out” of the program, their status as Student Naval Aviator revoked, and sent packing to the unglamorous training grounds of Quantico.[1] After enduring months of grueling effort, Henderson received his reward: a pair of gold wings, designation as a Naval Aviator, and the all-important order “detailed to duty involving flying as a pilot.” The date was September 20, 1929 – exactly one year since the completion of his pre-flight training.\n\nLieutenant Henderson would spend the next eighteen months shuffling between the various squadrons of Aircraft Two; most of his time was spent training with Bombing 4, or as squadron officer (and occasional skipper) of Utility Squadron 7. In December 1934, he landed a berth as the gunnery officer of Observation Squadron 8M. With a lineage dating back to the original Observation Squadron 1 of the Dominican campaign, and a distinctive ace of spades insignia adorning their Vought O2U Corsairs, Observation 8 was a proud unit and one where Henderson apparently felt right at home. By the time he transferred out in May of 1937, he was one of the squadron’s more capable aviators – a fact reflected in his promotion to captain in July 1936.\n\nJoe Henderson faced an incredible task. His first order of business was to institute an instruction program for his new pilots. A handful of young “Second Looies,” including Thomas Gratzek, Bruno Hagedorn, Thomas Moore, Jesse Rollow, and Harold Schlenderling, had arrived with Henderson; these junior pilots were not checked out on the Vought SB2U Vindicators they were expected to fly. The obsolete “Vibrators,” with engines long overdue for overhauls maintenance checks and fabric skins made brittle and ragged by Midway’s bouts of heat and cold, wind and rain, were a chore to fly and maintain – but they were the only planes available. Henderson led by example, choosing a Vindicator and an experienced radioman (T/Sgt. Edward Nooney) with whom to lead the training. He reorganized the squadron into flights of four, organized into a “closed V” formation in the air, and ran them through daily flying, bombing, and takeoff drills. The men learned fast, although an accident between 1Lt. Armond DeLalio and T/Sgt. Clyde Stamps resulted in the writeoff of one Vindicator.\n\nCaptain Elmer Glidden, leader of the second box of Henderson’s formation, saw the Zeros make two passes at Henderson before “one of the enemy put several shots through the plane… his plane started to burn. From the actions of the leader it was apparent that he was hit and out of action.”[6] Second Lieutenant Jesse Rollow counted twenty Zeros and one lone plane with fixed landing gear; this plane “shot Major Henderson, his plane catching on fire.”[7] Flames sprouted from the SBD’s left wing root, and soon it was falling out of control towards the sea. A single parachute blossomed in its wake; whether it was Henderson, Reininger, or the trick of a hopeful imagination will never be known. Neither Marine would ever be seen again.\n\n“It is believed that three direct hits were made on the ships, and two close misses” reported the War Diary. Corporal Eugene T. Card, Captain Fleming’s gunner, upped the ante by claiming that Major Henderson deliberately “dove down a smokestack on one of the carriers.”[8] While VMSB-241 scored only the two near misses, word of their exploits spread quickly to newspapers across the country, and Lofton Henderson became a household name and a national hero, with many papers reporting his deliberate dive into the carrier as fact. Later that year, Marine aviators would name their famous airfield on Guadalcanal in his honor; the Gearing-class destroyer USS Henderson (DD-785) would also bear his name."
