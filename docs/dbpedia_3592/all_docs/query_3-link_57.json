        "text": "Lycoming County Veterans - Civil War\n\nPlease note: This information is from The History of Lycoming County by John F. Meginness; Â©1892. It is very likely that it is not 100% accurate or complete. Researchers should verify this information with additional sources.\n\nELEVENTH REGIMENT-THREE MONTHS.\n\nIt is the pride of this county that the first companies she gave to the country formed a part of a regiment that not only served during the first term of three months but was reorganized under the same number for the war and achieved a noble and enviable record for gallant service and heavy losses.\n\nThe companies from this county were mustered in, April 24, 1861, at Harrisburg, the regiment organizing with Phaeon Jarrett of Clinton county as colonel, the other officers being Richard Coulter, lieutenant colonel; William D. Earnest, major; F. Asbury Awl, adjutant; William H. Hay, quartermaster; William T. Babb, Surgeon, and H. B. Buehler, assistant surgeon.\n\nIn May the regiment was engaged in duty along the Baltimore and Ohio railroad. On June 18th it joined the forces under General Patterson at Chambersburg, soon after moving to Downstown, and next to Williamsport, on the Potomac, a town the name of which was quite familiar to many of the regiment. Crossing into Virginia, the Eleventh became engaged on July 2d at Falling Waters with the enemy under the future \"Stonewall\" Jackson, which force they routed handsomely, compelling them to leave eight of their dead upon the field. Among the Union killed was one from the Eleventh Regiment, Amos Zoopinger member of Company H from Danville. The wounded of the regiment included Russell Levan and John De Hass, of Company G, from Lycoming county. In the killing of Amos Zoopinger, Pennsylvania gave her first life offering on the battlefield in the war for the Union. Rev. P. M. Coup, now a citizen of Williamsport, stood next to him and had his clothes stained with the blood of Zoopinger. Hon. H. C. Parsons, who was in a Williamsport company, also stood near to the brave Zoopinger when he fell. The regiment voluntarily remained beyond the time of its enlistment and was warmly commended in general orders.\n\nThe regimental band went from the county, and contained the following:\n\nLeader, Daniel Repasz; drum-major, W.

Richard Coulter was made colonel of the reorganized regiment, which was accepted July 25, 1861, for three years. The Governor in announcing that it would continue to be known as the \"Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers,\" wrote: \"It is just to the officers and men that the regiment should have future opportunities of displaying the courage and gallantry of Falling Waters, which is now a part of the military history of the State, under their original designation. Henceforth known as \"The Old Eleventh,\" the regiment served through the war to the surrender of Lee. Its losses were heavy. In its first serious engagement, at Thoroughfare Gap, it, lost two officers and sixteen men killed and three officers and thirty-seven enlisted men wounded. A few days later, at Second Bull Run, it lost fifty-two killed, sixty-seven wounded, and seventy-five prisoners, the majority of them wounded. The Lycoming company sustained its full share of the losses. At Antietam the regiment lost one officer and twenty-six men killed, four officers and eighty-five men wounded, and two prisoners. Its losses at Fredericksburg were one officer and fourteen men killed, five officers and sixty-one men wounded, and five prisoners. At Chancellorsville the regiment belonged to the rear guard in crossing the river after the battle. It was on the front line the first day at Gettysburg, losing during the battle fifteen killed, fifty-nine wounded, and sixty-four prisoners. It sustained proportionate loss in the other engagements. Captain Knox, first captain of the Lycoming company, died in 1862. His successor, Captain Sees, was discharged for disability. Overmyer, who became the next captain, was captured twice and wounded, and came out brevet lieutenant colonel. The last captain was also wounded. The loss among the men was correspondingly heavy, seventeen having been killed, many others died in prison, and a large number were wounded.
