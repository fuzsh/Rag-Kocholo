Its members were recruited in Hardeman, Madison, Henderson, and McNairy counties. The unit was assigned to T.H. Bell's Brigade in the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. In Mississippi it sustained 22 casualites at Brice's Cross Roads and 95 at Harrisburg. Later the regiment was active in Tennessee and in March, 1865, was consolidated with the 20th Tennessee Cavalry. It moved to Alabama and on May 3, the 18th/20th contained 29 officers and 217 men. The next day they were included in the surrender of the department. The field officers were Colonels John F.
