The only Muster Roll found for him is dated Nov. 7 to Dec. 31, 1862. It shows he was enlisted on Nov. 7, 1862 at Gillisonville, for a period of 90 days by E. S. Riley and, he is marked as \"Present.\" Family lore has said James was on active duty during the Battle of Pocotaligo and Coosawhatchie. However, that battle was fought on October 21-23, 1862, about two weeks earlier than the date shown for his enlistment. James is buried in Sand Hill Cemetery near Varnville. Submitted by Jennie London, great granddaughter of Miles R. Mixson, 25 Nov. 2014. Mixson, Jessie M. Sergeant/2nd Lieutenant - 9th Regiment South Carolina Infantry, Company F. By March of 1862 this Regiment had merged into the 11th Regiment. He enlisted on Aug. 5, 1861 for a period of one year, but served until the end of the war. This enlistment was at Pocotaligo, by Capt. Elliott and his rank is shown as Sergeant. In May of 1862, a Regimental Return shows him present and \"Elected from the ranks\" at Coosawhatchie to Brevet 2nd Lt. He continued with this rank and regiment until he was \"paroled\" at Greensboro, NC on May 1, 1865. His widow's Pension Application says he was \"discharged at Goldsboro, NC, April 1865.\" Jessie is buried in Sand Hill Cemetery near Varnville. Submitted by Jennie London, great granddaughter of Miles R. Mixson, 25 Nov. 2014. Mixson, John A. Private/Corporal/Sergeant - 9th Regiment South Carolina Infantry, Company F. By March of 1862 this Regiment had merged into the 11th Regiment. He enlisted on Aug. 5, 1861 for a period of one year, but served until his death in 1864. This enlistment was at Pocotaligo, by Capt. Elliott and his rank is shown as Corporal. A Muster Roll dated March of 1862 shows him as a Sergeant. Then, in July of 1862 he is shown to be a Private. He is still shown as a Private on a Register of Confederate States Hospital, Petersburg, VA, where he was admitted on May 21, 1864. Under \"Remarks\" on this record is the notation: \"Died June 15, 1864.\" Report of Sick and Wounded for the day he died shows he had Typhoid Fever. This was during the Siege of Petersburg and about six weeks before the Battle of the Crater on July 30. John is buried in the common grave for the SC enlisted men at Blandford Cemetery, near Petersburg, VA. Submitted by Jennie London, great granddaughter of Miles R. Mixson, 25 Nov. 2014. Mixson, Miles R. - Private - Co. C 19th Battalion South Carolina Calvary. Family lore says he tried to sign up at Pocotaligo, probably about the same time as his uncles: Jessie M, John A and William B. But, he was sent home as being too young to go to war at the age of 15. Based on his Pension Application and the few Muster Rolls that have been found, it appears he was able to enlist with Kirk's Partisan Rangers a year later, in 1862. Evidently, this \"special forces\" outfit was more willing to accept an underage youth than the regular army. Muster rolls for Miles, obtained from the National Archives, have a notation at the bottom that shows Company B of Captain Kirk's Company, South Carolina Partisan Rangers, organized July 11, 1862, became Company C of the 19th Battalion on December 20, 1864. Other sources state this company may have also been known as \"May River Troop.\" By the end of the war, the 19th SC Cavalry was part of the Army of Tennessee, under the command of Lt. Col. William L. Trenholm. And, as part of the Army of Tennessee, it surrendered to Gen. William T. Sherman at Durham Station, NC on April 26, 1865. Miles was discharged at that time. He is buried in Sand Hill Cemetery near Varnville. Notes: (1) There is a grave marker for Miles which states that he was a Sergeant in Co. G, 5th Georgia Calvary. However, most of the documents from the National Archives for \"M.R. Mixson\" in this company have the initials \"M.K.\" Plus, this man is shown as being present in GA on some of the same dates that Miles is listed as present in SC. And, since his Pension Application clearly states that he served in Co. C, 19th SC Cavalry from 1862 until \"end of war\" in 1865, this marker appears to be based on incomplete and faulty research from a number of years ago. (2) Miles is the son of James R. Mixson, who was the older brother of Jessie M., John A. and William B. Mixson. Another brother, Edward, died in 1856, before the war began. Submitted by Jennie London, great granddaughter of Miles R. Mixson, 25 Nov. 2014. Mixson, William Barnwell Sergeant - 9th Regiment South Carolina Infantry, Company F. By March of 1862 this Regiment had merged into the 11th Regiment. He was enlisted August 5, 1861 at Pocotaligo by W. W. Elliott. His discharge, dated March 12, 1862 shows his rank as Sergeant. This discharge record and one pay voucher are the only documents that have been found for him. Based on these, it appears he only served from Aug. 5 to Nov. 25, 1861. \"The Mixon - Mixson Family\" by John Leslie Mixon, Vol. 1, page 243, states that, \"he suffered a bad wound the first year of the war and was discharged.\" This fits very well with what little information there is on the two documents. William is buried in the Mount Olive Baptist Church Cemetery at Early Branch. Submitted by Jennie London, great granddaughter of Miles R. Mixson, 25 Nov. 2014.\n\nNettles, Charles E.

Killed in va. on Feb. 6, 1863)\n\nPeebles, Abraham - The National Archives did not have any information on Abraham Peeples, but the South Carolina Archives did. Unfortunately, their records contain some conflicting information. One record says he was killed at Swift Creek, while another says he was killed at Ft. Fisher. His muster roll shows him wounded at Swift Creek. My personal theory is that he was badly wounded at Swift Creek, muster roll shows he was wounded there and sent home for awhile on medical furlough. Perhaps someone mistakenly marked him as dead. Later, he returned and was subsequently killed at Ft. Fisher. His widow remarried, prior to the Pension Act, so we do not have that record. Abraham Peeples is said to have been in the CSA, and was killed at Swift Creek. Problem - his year of death is given as 1861, and the Battle of Swift Creek, VA was not until 1864. Maybe there was another Swift Creek? Jennie London\n\nPrince, Joseph Edward Private - 3rd SC Cavalry\n\nRichardson, Albert Rhett Sergeant - 5th Sc Regiment Co.
