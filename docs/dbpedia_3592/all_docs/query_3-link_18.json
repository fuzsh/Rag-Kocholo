        "text": "Lofton was the son of Frederick Ernest and Catherine \"Katie\" (Schwartz) Henderson who married about 1897. Lofton's siblings were Charlotta Marie, Frederick Paul and Shirley Hale Henderson. Frederick served in WWII and Korea. He retired in 1959 from the US Marine Corps with the rank of Brigadier General.\n\nLofton attended Lorain high school in Lorain, OH where he was the captain of the football team. He entered the US Naval Academy on an appointment from Ohio on 11 July 1922. While at the academy, Lofton played football. On 22 May 1926, Lofton R Henderson was appointed 2d Lt. in the Marine Corps by and with the advise and consent of the Senate, upon graduation from the Naval Academy (NA), Annapolis, Md., to rank from 04 Jun 1926. He accepted the appointment and executed the oath of office on 03 Jun 1926 at Annapolis, and was assigned to the Marine Corps.\n\nOn 29 May 1926, he was designated a Student Naval Aviator (SNA) and detailed to duty involving flying, effective from and after 04 Jun 1926. On 30 Apr 1926, he was under instruction in aviation at the Naval Academy and continued at Annapolis until 26 Sep 1926 when Lt Henderson was removed from flying status (apparently he broke his leg) and assigned to a non-flying billet at the Marine Barracks, Naval Torpedo Station (NTS) Newport, RI as a company officer. On 16 Feb 1927, Lt Henderson was detached from NTS, RI and reported to the Marine Barracks, School Detachment, Navy Yard, Philadelphia for Basic Class. Henderson completed the Basic Class on 15 Aug 1927. While there he qualified as a Marksman on 15 Jun 1927. He was detached to the MB, Navy Yard, New York, NY on 16 July 1927 where he was the Detachment Officer. During Sep 1927 he had additional duties as the Yard Fire Marshall, and he acted as counsel for the defense during a General Court Marshal (GCM) at the Navy Yard.\n\nOnce again, between 1-13 October 1927, he acted as the counsel for defense at a GCM at the Navy Yard. On 17 Oct he was sent on temporary duty with the 3rd Brigade. On the 3rd of Nov 1927, Lt Henderson embarked in San Francisco, CA., as a passenger with a detachment of Marines aboard U.S.A.T. Thomas enroute to Tientsin, China via Manila, P.I. The ship made stops in Honolulu, T.H. (11 Nov), and Guam, M.I. (24 Nov) before arriving at Cavite, Philippines on 30 Nov 1927. They disembarked from the Thomas and continued their journey on 01 Dec 1927 via the USS Pecos (AO-6) to the 3rd Brigade in China. They arrived at Chinwangtao, China on 16 Dec 1927 and proceeded by rail to Tientsin, China arriving at their destination the same day. Lt Henderson was assigned to the 15th Machine Gun and Howitzer Company, 12th Regiment, 3rd Brigade at Teintsin, China. He was assigned to command the First Platoon. On 12 April 1928, Lt Henderson was temporarily detached to the aviation squadron, Camp McMurray, Hain Ho, China, for a physical examination by a flight surgeon.\n\nAfter his physical, Lt Henderson resumed his duties with the First Platoon. On 01 May 1928, he was relieved of his duties with the First Platoon and was assigned duties as Reconnaissance Officer. On 01 Jun 1928, Lt Henderson was again assigned duties commanding the First Platoon. Prior to his return to the US, on 11 July, Lt Henderson took several days of leave in Peking, China. He had received orders to report to Observation Squadron #8 in San Diego. He detached from his command in China and embarked on the USS Chaumont (AP-5) in Taku Bar, China on the 11th and sailed on 12 July 1928. He arrived in San Francisco on 17 Aug 1928 and reported to Observation Squadron Eight-m, A.S., W.C.E.F., Mather Field, Mills (Sacramento), CA. He was under preliminary aviation instruction from 21 to 31 Aug 1928. Lt Henderson was designated a Student Naval Aviator (SNA) on 01 Sep 1928 and detailed to duty involving flying as an SNA. For the next three weeks he continued preliminary aviation instruction. He successfully completed that training, and, on 20 Sep 1928, he was detached to the Naval Air Station (NAS), Pensacola, FL. Lt Henderson arrived at the MB, NAS, Pensacola on 03 Oct as an SNA.\n\nHe continued his training into December 1928 when he took a week's leave over Christmas and New Years. The new year of 1929 began with more intensive aviation training for Lt Henderson. Finally, after a year of aviation training, Lt Henderson was designated a NAVAL AVIATOR on 20 Sep 1929 and detailed to duty involving flying as a pilot. In Oct 1929, now a new Marine Corps pilot, Lt Henderson became ill and was hospitalized for 10 days at the US Naval Hospital, Pensacola. On 11 Nov 1929, he was detached from NAS Pensacola to report to the Marine Barracks, Quantico, VA with a delay enroute (leave) between 18 Nov 1929 and 02 Jan 1930. He reported to VF Squadron 4M, ECEF (East Coast Expeditionary Force)., MB, Quantico, VA with duties as a naval aviator and gunnery officer. On 17 Mar 1930, Lt Henderson was detached to Aircraft Squadrons, 2nd Brigade, Managua, Nicaragua. He embarked on the USS Vega on 27 Mar 1930 and sailed from Hampton Roads, VA on 30 Mar 1930. He arrived on 09 April 1930 at Corinto, Nicaragua and joined VJ Sq. 6M, Second Brigade in Managua, Nicaragua. For the next year and a half Lt Henderson would serve in Nicaragua. On 2 Oct 1931, he embarked on the USS Vega at Corinto, Nicaragua and sailed on the same date. He arrived in Hampton Roads, VA on 14 Oct 1931 and commenced leave. He reported to NAS Pensacola on 29 Oct 1931 for duty as a Naval Aviation Instructor.\n\nOn 01July 1932, he was promoted to First Lieutenant in Pensacola, FL. While in Pensacola he met and married Jule Adeline Williams (name on Florida marriage record was Adeline Williams Galey) on 19 May 1933 in Escambia county, FL. He detached from Instructor duty at NAS Pensacola on 30 Aug 1933 and was on authorized delay enroute between 31 Aug to 12 Oct 1933 (cross country driving honeymoon). He reported as the Executive Officer of Bombing Plane Sq. Four M, AS, WCEF, NAS, San Diego on 13 Oct 1933. For the next three years Lt Henderson served with different squadrons in the San Diego area. Then on 30 Jun 1936, while serving with Observation Squadron (VO-8-M) Aircraft Two, 2nd Marine Brigade at NAS, San Diego, CA., Lt Henderson was promoted to Captain. His other duties included Communications and radio Officer and assistant Gunnery Officer. In Sep 1936 he was detailed to special temporary aviation duty at LA Municipal Airport in Los Angeles, CA in connection with National Air Races. Also that month, Capt Henderson was awarded the Nicaraguan Cross of Valor & Diploma.\n\nCapt Henderson continued to serve in the San Diego area until July 1937 when he moved to the East Coast. This was the beginning of several years of duty with various aviation commands along the Atlantic coast; the first one being Bombing Sq. One in Quantico. In Dec 1938, he was assigned as a student in the Junior Course in Quantico, VA. He completed that course on 01 Jun 1939 and returned to the Base Air Detachment (BAD-1), FMF, MB, Quantico, VA. On 19 Jun 1940, Capt Henderson was assigned to Marine Scouting Sq. One, 1 Marine Air Group (MAG), FMF, MB., Quantico as the executive officer. In October, the squadron deployed to the Naval Air Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. On 01 Oct 1940, Capt Henderson departed by air from MB, Quantico. After another stop on 2 Oct he arrived at the Naval Station (NS), Guantanamo Bay on 3 Oct 1941. The rest of the squadron, planes and crews, boarded the USS Ranger in Norfolk, VA and sailed on 2 Oct. They arrived in GTMO on 05 Oct. It would seem that the move didn't agree with the XO. A little over a week after arriving he became ill and was sent to the Navy dispensary for 9 days. By 1 April 1941, the squadron had returned to MB, Quantico, VA.\n\nBy 01 July 1941 he was transferred to the West Coast again. He was assigned to the HQ Sq, 2nd Marine Airwing in San Diego as a naval aviator. His other duties included Wing Intelligence, Contact and Communication Officer and Custodian of Registered Pubs. He also had additional duties as the Wing Operations Officer. On 8 July he was promoted to Major with a date of rank of 01 Mar 1941. In the early fall Major Henderson was in the US Naval Hospital in San Diego for almost the entire month of October. After the US entry into WWII, Major Henderson was transferred from HQ Sq, 2d MAW, San Diego via USAT Aquitaine. He embarked on 30 Mar 1942 in San Francisco and arrived in Pearl Harbor on 4 Apr 1942. Between 4-11 April Major Henderson was assigned to HQ&SS-21, MAG-21 awaiting assignment. On 12 Apr, he sailed on the USS William Ward Burrows from Pearl Harbor to MAG-22, Midway Islands. With Major Henderson were Capt Kirk Armistead, and 2Lt's Thomas J Gratzek, Bruno P. Hagedorn, and Thomas F Moore Jr. They would be assigned to his squadron. Once on Midway, Major Henderson relieved Capt. Leo Smith in command of VSMB-241 on 17 April. Now in command, Major Henderson stepped up training, reorganizing the squadron and instituting tactics using 19 planes: four boxes of four aircraft apiece, with the lead element consisting of the commanding officer and two wing-men. A month later on 26 May 1942 VSMB-241 practiced glide-bombing and strafing, as well as squadron tactics. Later that day, the aircraft ferry USS Kitty Hawk (APV-1), arrived from Hawaii with 19 Douglas SBD-2s for VMSB-241 and Major Benjamin W Norris, the squadron's new Executive Officer. With Major Norris were more \"rookie\" Marine pilots; Marine Corps Reserve Lts John C. Musselman, Ellwood Q. Lindsay, Charles M. Kune, Bruce H. Ek, Ray A. Corry Jr., John M. Butler and Robert J. \"R\" Bear, and Albert William Tweedy, Jr.\n\nEarly on the morning of 04 Jun 1942, VSMB-241 squadron led by her commander, Major Lofton Henderson, took off from the Naval Air Station, Midway enroute to attack the Japanese Strike Force approaching Midway. With the enemy aircraft carrier Hiryu in sight Henderson led his group of dive bombers on a shallow dive when they were swarmed by superior numbers of attacking enemy fighters whose objective was to shoot down the dive bomber's leader and break up the attack. Major Henderson's plane was set afire and hurtled into the sea. Reports indicate that a parachute was observed blossoming from behind Henderson's plane, but neither of the men were seen again.\n\nMaj Henderson and his gunner, PFC Lee Walter Reininger's remains were unrecoverable. They were listed as missing in action on 04 Jun 1942 and declared presumed dead on 5 Jun 1943.\n\nMaj. Henderson was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, the Purple Heart, the Presidential Unit Citation , American Defense Service Medal w/Fleet Clasp, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one bronze battle star, and the World War II Victory Medal."
