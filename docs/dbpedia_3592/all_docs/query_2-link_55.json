        "text": "Hi folks,\n\nLooking for information regarding my great grandfather Joseph Miller, 26766, who was part of the 9th Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers. I know that the Battalion was formed in September 1914 in Omagh from Tyrone volunteers. They went to Finner Camp as part of the 3rd Ulster Division on 2nd November 1914. In January 1915 they became part of the 109th Brigade, 36th Division in Randalstown. In July 1915 they went to Ballykelly where they spent time getting kitted up and training. In early September 1915 they went to the Bordon area, to France in October 1915. Private Joseph Miller was sadly killed at Thiepval on 1st July 1916.\n\nJoseph Miller was born 10th May 1887 Lower Cumber, Co. Tyrone, N. Ireland. He left behind his wife Margaret Goligher/Gallagher, and 2 sons and 3 daughters.\n\nI would love to know if there are any photos of the 9th Battalion (or even of Joseph Miller himself). I would love to know more of the process they went through before going to France (and after), where/what is Finner Camp, how was the Battalion formed, why the Battalion became part of the Brigade, how did he enlist, little things like that. The plan is write his story and preserve his legacy.\n\nThank you to anyone who can help with this.\n\n1 hour ago, Gary Henderson said:\n\nIn early September 1915 they went to the Bordon area, to France in October 1915. Private Joseph Miller was sadly killed at Thiepval on 1st July 1916.\n\nUnfortunately looks like Josephs' service record is among the majority that went up in flames in WW2 when the London warehouse where they were stored was hit by German bombs.\n\nSo the first military record that can be looked at for him is his Medal Index Card. They are literally index cards, raised at the relevant records office to assist the clerks with keeping track of the paperwork and correspondence to do with issuing his service medals.\n\nThe Medal Index Card for 26766 Private Joseph Miller, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, shows he qualified for the Victory Medal and British War Medal.\n\nThe relevance of that for you is that the very earliest he could have served in a Theatre of War was the 1st January 1916, so did not deploy overseas with the 9th Battalion, and very likely never trained with them while they were still in Ireland.\n\nI don't subscribe to Ancestry \\ FindMyPast \\ Fold3 so can't check out surviving service records for men with nearby service numbers to see if there are any patterns detectable that might have applied to Joseph, including whether he was compulsorarily transferred to the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on arrival in France, having done his earlier training with a battalion of another Regiment. Unfortunately the Service Medal Roll itself, (images on Ancestry \\ transcriptions on FindMyPast) will not usually show units other than those served with overseas.\n\nSoldiers Died in the Great War, an HMSO publication from the 1920's, sometimes shows an original unit and service number, but absence, as is the case with Joseph, doesn't automatically mean he only served with the regiment he died for.\n\nAnother potential guide is to look at the fatalities recorded on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission datebase for men of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers who died and who have service numbers between, for example, 26700 to 26799. The earliest death recorded was on the 8th May 1916, so either the cohort was very lucky, or had not been out for very long. They turn up subsequently spread across a number of Battalions, so possibly a general draft that reached France and was parcelled out - although more work needs to be done on that.\n\nBut one of those deaths on the 8th May 1916 throws up a potential line of enquiry. The service number of Private R. Millen has a prefix - he was 12/26785 and he was serving with the 9th Battalion when he died, being buried at Authuille, France. Prefixs were common throughout the British Army, but all too often they get dropped in day to day admin. His one would indicate a connection to the 12th Battalion. https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/598972/r-millen/\n\nRobert Millens' Medal Index Card only shows his service number as 26785. He too like Joseph only qualified for the Victory Medal and British War Medal.\n\nFrom our parent site, The Long, Long Trail,:\n\n12th (Reserve) Battalion\n\nFormed in Enniskillen in April 1915 as a Reserve Bn. Moved to Ballyshannon in June 1915 but went to Newtownards in August 1915. Moved back to Enniskillen in december 1915 and in 1916 to Finner Camp. https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/royal-inniskilling-fusiliers/\n\nThey would have been sending drafts out to the fighting battalions.\n\nCheers,\n\nPeter\n\nEdited 14 January by PRC\n\nTypos\n\n50 minutes ago, Allan1892 said:\n\nJoseph would have enlisted on the same day or at the most the next day.\n\nOne caveat - only if they both joined the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers at that time. To eliminate the possibility this wasn't a transfer at the Infantry Base Depot a few more records would need checking. If Joseph did enlist in October 1915 and died on the 12th July 1916 then he will only get the minimum War Gratuity, so even that can't be used to give anything other than a broadbrush as to when he joined up.\n\nHaving a quick look at what is indexed on FindMyPast:-\n\n26744 James Young also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26745 John Young died 1916. FindMyPast has something indexed as a service records for a \"J.Young\" but that's probably one of their one page lists \\ memo found in another mans records.\n\n26751 John Doak also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26757 William Mitchell also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26761 John Doherty has no surviving service records but died in 1918, so estimating enlistment period from war gratuity amount is a possibility.\n\n26764 James Monteith also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26771 William Farquhar Jenner has no surviving service records but died in 1917, so estimating enlistment period from war gratuity amount is a possibility.\n\n26772 John O'Donnell has no surviving service records but died in 1918, so estimating enlistment period from war gratuity amount is a possibility.\n\n26782 John Goligher also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26786 Edward Buchanan has surviving \"1919\" service records, (FindMyPast), most likely Pension Records on Ancestry & Fold as they are in the WO364 series according to familysearch.\n\n26787 Robert Crowe also has a SWB, but no surviving service records.\n\n26788 Charles Winters - no surviving service records but a Medical Admission Register entry from 1917 on FindMyPast. May have been at a facility when they were still recording in 1917 how long a man had been in the Army.\n\n26796 Thomas Wilson has no surviving service records but died in 1918, so estimating enlistment period from war gratuity amount is a possibility.\n\nI've not checked out the MiC details so some of the missing numbers may have gone on to service with other regiments \\ corps and so may have surviving discharge \\ pension records under the later units details.\n\nIf those Silver War Badge records show enlistment runs in date order then a likely indicator that they either joined the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers on the same day(s) or, and less likely, they were transferred en masse.\n\nCheers,\n\nPeter\n\nEdited 14 January by PRC\n\nTypos"
