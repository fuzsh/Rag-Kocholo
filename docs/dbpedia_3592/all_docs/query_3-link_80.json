        "text": "The Patriots of the Revolutionary War are being honored in a special Historic Courthouse Centennial Ceremony at 11:45 a.m. today at the Historic Courthouse.\n\nA precise number may never be known, but research has found at least 22 Patriots who died in Henderson County or are buried in the county.\n\nListed on a monument erected by the Joseph McDowell Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, are eight Patriots: William Capps, John Peter Corn, William Senter (Sentelle), Joseph Henry, James Johnson, Andrew Miller, Samuel King, Abraham Kuykendall, James Brittain, Jesse Rickman, Elijah Williamson and the Rev. Joel Blackwell.\n\nSince the monument was erected, Revolutionary War markers have been erected at the grave sites of Noble Johnson and Matthew Maybin. There are also Revolutionary War markers at the graves of Hugh Gourley and Jacob Shipman. There is a Revolutionary War monument at Bearwallow Baptist Church for John Merrell.\n\nMatthew Maybin\n\nMatthew Maybin was born in 1756 in County Atrim, Northern Ireland, according to his Revolutionary War pension application of 1840.\n\n\"He landed in Charleston, S.C., Dec. 19, 1772,\" said George Jones with the Henderson County Genealogical and Historical Society.\n\nHe joined the Patriot cause in 1775 in the Ninety-Six District of South Carolina under Capt. Thomas Gordon. In 1776, he again volunteered with Col. Lisle's Regiment to \"guard the frontier from the depredations of Cherokee Indians.\" The Cherokee fought with the British during the Revolution and mounted attacks against pioneer settlers. Maybin fought through 1777 and in the spring of 1778 was with troops in Georgia.\n\nThe winter of 1779-80 found Maybin at Col. John Earle's station on the North Pacolet River and remained there scouting until 1782.\n\nIn the fall of 1782, he moved his family from the Newberry District of South Carolina to Earle's Station in Rutherford County and fought the Cherokee until his discharge.\n\nAccording to his pension application, he lived seven or eight years on the Pacolet, then moved to Green River in 1787.\n\n\"He fought at Kings Mountain and Cowpens,\" said Theron Maybin.\n\nMaybin's grave is located in a nursery off Green River Road. The Revolutionary War marker lists the names of his 12 children.\n\nOne of his descendants, Jane, married a descendant of another Revolutionary War soldier, William Capps.\n\nWilliam Capps\n\nThe marker at a grave in the old Fortune-Kuykendall Cemetery in the Greenbriar Subdivision near the Green River in the Zirconia/ East Flat Rock area of the county reads: \"William Capps Jr., Private N.C. Troops, Revolutionary War, 1761-1847, enlisted in the American Revolution Army 1780, in Johnston County, N.C., at age 19, came to this section in 1795.\"\n\nHis pension application states he lived in Burke County when he was drafted for service in 1780. He fought under Gen. Daniel Morgan at the Battle of Cowpens. He served a second tour participating in scouting excursions. He was drafted a third time while visiting in Montgomery County, Va.\n\nHe moved from Burke County to the Edgefield District of South Carolina after the war and later moved into today's Henderson County in 1795.\n\nOn the tombstone is also inscribed the names of his 12 children.\n\nTwo of those children married descendants of Abraham Kuykendall, another American Patriot.\n\nAbraham Kuykendall\n\nAbraham Kuykendall was baptized Oct. 18, 1719, in the Dutch Reformed Church in Deer Park Church, N.Y. He moved with his family to an area near Fort Jervis, N.Y., then to Virginia and North Carolina. In the 1760s, he was living with his first wife, Elizabeth, in Mecklenburg County, according to land records.\n\nIn March 1780, he received a grant for 200 acres in Old Tryon County on the Sandy Run of the Broad River. In 1782, he and his wife were members of Sandy Run Baptist Church in Rutherford County (formed from Old Tryon County). Historical records in Old Tryon list him as Capt. Kuykendall after 1776.\n\nWhen Rutherford County was formed, he was chosen as one of the commissioners to select the site and supervise the erection of the courthouse, prison and stocks. He was also appointed a justice of the peace.\n\nHe was on the Committee of Safety to govern North Carolina during the Revolutionary War. For this service, he was given a 640-acre land grant, which later became the community of Flat Rock.\n\nKuykendall was in his 60s during the war. No record has been found that he actually fought in the war, but he did serve on the governing body of the state during the war and served as captain of a local militia.\n\nThere is a DAR Revolutionary War marker for Kuykendall at Mud Creek Baptist Church cemetery. Most historians and genealogists write that his actual grave is not at the cemetery. Its precise location is unknown, but family records indicate he was buried on his land. Kuykendall gave the land on which Mud Creek Baptist Church was built and the church is located near the middle of his extensive property holdings.\n\nHis tavern stood across the road from what is now the Trenholm Subdivision. Kuykendall owned at one time 1,000 acres in today's Flat Rock.\n\nHe was found dead at the age of 104 in Pheasant Branch on his property.\n\nSome of the descendants of Kuykendall married into the Shipman family.\n\nJacob Shipman\n\nJacob Shipman was born in 1744 in Brunswick County, Va. He owned land on Sandy Run in Rutherford County.\n\nHe enlisted July 20, 1778, in Quinn's Co., 10th N.C. Regiment with Col. Abraham Sheppard commanding. He died sometime after November 1794, when he wrote his will. His will was \"proved\" in Rutherford County in January 1795.\n\n\"His older sons, Edward and John, were living in Henderson County,\" wrote descendant James B. King in the Heritage of Henderson County. \"His body was carried by wagon by his sons to Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he was buried, a trip that took three days.\"\n\nAlso at the cemetery at Ebenezer Baptist Church is the grave of John Peter Corn.\n\nJohn Peter Corn\n\nJohn Peter Corn said in his pension application of 1832 that he was born in 1752 in Albemarle County, Va. He enlisted Feb. 8, 1776, in the Revolutionary War for two years. He was under the command of Col. Dangerfield. The soldiers moved into Pennsylvania and Corn was wounded near Philadelphia in a skirmish against the British guard.\n\nAfterwards, he went to Valley Forge to take up winter quarters, where he suffered from exposure and almost starved during the winter of 1777. After his discharge, he married and lived in Virginia for 12 or 13 years. He went from there to Surry County, N.C., for five years, to Wilkes County for five years and then to Old Buncombe, today's Henderson County.\n\nHe lived in the area of today's Tuxedo for several years. In 1830, he sold his land and bought a tract of 500 acres on Devil's Fork near the Ebenezer Baptist Church, where he lived until his death at the age of 92.\n\nTwo grandsons, George Henry Corn and Jesse Marion Corn, described the funeral, where two companies of soldiers conducted a military service: \"They stepped forward with the drum, fife and bugle playing as the infantry marched by the grave, half on each side of the grave. Each man fired blank cartridges into the grave. The calvary in double file marched by also, firing their guns into the grave.\"\n\nSamuel King Sr.\n\nSamuel King Sr. was born in 1746 in Virginia, where he was an overseer on a plantation in Bedford County owned by his future wife, Elizabeth Underwood Davenport.\n\nHe volunteered to fight in the Revolutionary War on Dec. 9, 1776, serving as a private with the 11th Va. Regiment of the Continental troops, commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan. He was listed as a prisoner Oct. 14, 1777. He either was released or escaped. On Feb. 17, 1778, he was on a list of a company that was part of Brig. Gen. Thomas Conway's Brigade at Valley Forge.\n\nAfter the war, he migrated to North Carolina. In 1782, he purchased land on the south fork of the Broad River. He later received a land grant on the west side of the French Broad River in Mills River.\n\nThe Daughters of the American Revolution placed his Revolutionary War marker in the Mud Creek Baptist Church cemetery. His grave was later found in the historic King Cemetery off Finley Cove Road and the marker was moved.\n\nJames Brittain\n\nIn the churchyard of Mills River Presbyterian Church is a Revolutionary War marker which reads: \"James Brittain, Pvt., N.C. Troops, Revolutionary War.\"\n\nFamily genealogists state that Brittain was probably born in Guilford County and moved further west into Burke County. After the Revolutionary War, he was one of the first property owners in Old Buncombe County. He represented Buncombe County seven times as a member of the state senate, 1796-1807.\n\nBy 1797, he had moved into the Mills River section of Old Buncombe, which later became part of Henderson County. He set aside 10 acres for community and school purposes. The Mills River Presbyterian Church and Mills River Academy were erected on the site in later years.\n\nHe died in 1832 and was buried on the Brittain homeplace off N.C. 191. The cemetery is now underneath a house. A Daughters of the American Revolution marker was erected in his memory and placed in the church cemetery.\n\nWilliam Sentelle\n\nWilliam Sentelle served with the 1st N.C. Militia during the Revolutionary War. He participated in the battles at Sullivan's Island, S.C., and outside Savannah, Ga. At Savannah, he was captured and held prisoner onboard an English ship. He regained his freedom during a prisoner exchange and rejoined the Patriot forces.\n\nIn 1781, he was at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.\n\nSentelle moved into the county about 1800. He died in 1837 and his grave site is on top of a mountain in the Big Willow community.\n\nHe and his wife had eight children when they settled on Jeter Mountain near Big Willow Creek.\n\nJesse Rickman\n\nThe grave of Jesse Rickman is found at the Rickman Family Cemetery off South Mills River Road.\n\nRickman's father was Dr. William Rickman of Charles City, Va., director of hospitals of the Continental Army during the war, wrote descendant Marie Towe McClure.\n\nJesse Rickman served with the American troops in the Wilmington District in 1783-84.\n\n\"In 1836, Jesse gave the land on which the first Mills River Baptist Church was built,\" she wrote.\n\nThe family cemetery was located across from the church near the homeplace, known as Sycamore.\n\nJames Andrew Miller\n\nIn the abandoned, neglected cemetery of Old French Broad Baptist Church can be found a Revolutionary War marker at the burial site of James Andrew Miller.\n\nThe marker states Miller was a mounted gunman with South Carolina troops. Miller's grave is the oldest marked, legible and so far discovered grave in the old cemetery. His date of death was 1808.\n\nAccording to records at the Old Buncombe Genealogical Society, Miller was a Revolutionary War pensioner who died Oct. 20, 1808, in what is now Henderson County.\n\nResearch indicates he served with the \"Swamp Fox\" Francis Marion in South Carolina and was also at the Battle of Kings Mountain.\n\nJames Johnson\n\nJames Johnson was born in Ireland in 1761 and came at the age of 7 with his parents to the American colonies.\n\nHe enlisted in the war in Virginia with the 2nd Regiment, Southern Detachment, under Gen. Nathaniel Greene.\n\nA pension application in 1840 indicates Johnson was wounded by a musket ball through his thigh at the Battle of Camden in South Carolina.\n\nIn 1781, he was captured by the British at the Battle of Eutaw Springs and placed on a prisoner ship in Charleston harbor, where he remained 13 months and two weeks. A eulogy written after his death states that he \"was fed on half rations, slept without bed or covering, and lived almost entirely without clothes.\"\n\nAt the end of the war, he was released.\n\nIn 1798, he and his wife moved to the Horse Shoe area of today's Henderson County. He established the Shaw's Creek Campground, one of the oldest Methodist meeting places in the county.\n\nThe Shaw's Creek Methodist Campground, where he is buried, is still maintained by his descendants. Johnson died at the age of 93 in 1852.\n\nNoble Johnson\n\nJames Johnson's older brother, Noble, also served in the American Revolution. He was born in 1758 in Ireland and came with his brother and parents to the colony of Virginia.\n\nAfter his service in the Revolutionary War, he moved to Mecklenburg County, N.C., where he married. He died in 1800.\n\n\"We recently erected a Revolutionary War marker at the Shaw's Creek Methodist Campground Cemetery for Noble Johnson,\" said George Jones with the Henderson County Historical and Genealogical Society.\n\nJones and family members located Johnson's service record and had the monument erected.\n\nHugh Gourley\n\nA marker on a grave in Shepherd's Memorial Park notes the burial spot of Hugh Gourley, 1747-1832.\n\nPart of the cemetery was originally a private family cemetery of the Smith family. When Shepherd Memorial Park began and the old tombstones removed, Gourley's stone had the words \"Revolutionary War\" engraved on it.\n\nThe original tombstones were replaced with the flat markers used in the cemetery today.\n\nGourley's Revolutionary War service was engraved on the new marker at the cemetery today.\n\nHis military service is not known.\n\nIt is known by researchers that he came to America on October 1772 aboard the ship Free Mason out of Larne, Ireland. The ship landed December 1772 in Charleston, S.C. Some spellings list his name as \"Gorley.\" He and his wife, Nancy, had a daughter, Sarah, who married into the Smith family who settled in Henderson County.\n\nRev. Joel Blackwell\n\nA Revolutionary War monument within the Jones Cemetery at Upward recognizes the service of the Rev. Joel Blackwell.\n\nBlackwell was born in 1755 and was one of the first itinerant Baptist ministers in Western North Carolina.\n\n\"He traveled by foot and horseback throughout Western North Carolina, preaching the gospel,\" wrote Frank FitzSimons in the Banks of the Oklawaha.\n\nBlackwell served with the Continental Army and received land in the Mill Spring community of Polk County.\n\nFamily researchers traced his property in Polk County to an area near today's Lake Adger. Some descendants believe his grave is in Polk County, where he lived until his death.\n\nOther family members have written that a descendant remembered attending his funeral at the Jones Cemetery. Many of Blackwell's grandchildren and relatives settled in the Upward and Dana areas of the county.\n\nElijah Williamson\n\nOff Twin Springs Road in Naples is found the Revolutionary War marker for Elijah Williamson, born 1755 in Virginia. He later moved to the Ninety-Six District of South Carolina.\n\nHe served three periods of service during the war, his pension records state. He served in the spring of 1778 near the Saluda River, policing the Cherokee Indian frontier.\n\nIn the summer of 1778, he spent three months near the Reedy River. In the fall of 1780, he served six months under Col. Levi Casey's Regiment of mounted horsemen in the upcounty of South Carolina.\n\nWilliamson lived in today's Henderson County on property later owned by Preston Patton, his great-grandson. Williamson is said to have planted five sycamore trees, naming each for one of his five daughters.\n\nOne of his daughters married into the Henry family.\n\nJoseph Henry\n\nFor her book 1840 Revolutionary Pensioners of Henderson County, Alexia Jones Helsley had to spend time determining which Joseph Henry is actually buried in the Old Beulah Baptist Church cemetery.\n\nThere were two other Joseph Henry's who served in the war. One enlisted in Lincoln County and died in 1814 in Orange County, Ind. He fought at the Battle of Kings Mountain, where his two brothers were killed.\n\nThe second Joseph Henry enlisted December 1779 and died in Buncombe County on Sept. 22, 1816. His widow applied for a pension in Buncombe County in 1845. There are no records to indicate this Joseph Henry ever lived in today's Henderson County.\n\nA Revolutionary War marker at Old Salem Baptist Church Cemetery, now known as Fletcher First Baptist Church Cemetery, is for the second Joseph Henry, who never lived in Henderson County. It is not known if Henry is buried in the cemetery or not. There is no tombstone marking his burial site and the DAR monument was placed many years later.\n\nWhen the cemetery survey was conducted in the late 1980s at the Old Beulah Baptist Church cemetery off Pleasant Grove Road in Etowah, an original tombstone, with Revolutionary War service noted, was discovered for Joseph Henry, born 1760, died 1840.\n\nThe Joseph Henry who settled in Henderson County was a resident of Lincoln County and joined the war June 1780 under Col. William Graham, Helsley writes. He was drafted again after the Battle of Kings Mountain, serving under Capt. Lofton's Co., and was discharged before the Battle of Guilford Courthouse.\n\nIn the Henry section of the old church cemetery are found the gravesites of his wives, sons and their families.\n\nJohn Merrell\n\nA bronze Revolutionary War marker on a memorial stone in the cemetery of Bearwallow Baptist Church was placed in honor of John Merrell by his descendants in the Gerton community of Henderson County.\n\nMerrell is buried in the Merrell-Patton Cemetery off Upper Brush Creek Road on a knoll surrounded by pasture land in the Fairview community of Buncombe County. This cemetery was being vandalized and destroyed by cattle and people, said his descendants.\n\nMerrell owned land in Buncombe, Henderson and Rutherford counties, where the three counties meet today. Many of his descendants live in Henderson County.\n\nHe was born in 1757 in New Jersey and enlisted in the Revolutionary War in 1778 in Guilford County. His family had moved to the Jersey Baptist Settlement in North Carolina. His father's land was near Lexington.\n\nHe fought with Gen. Rutherford at the battles of Briar Creek in Georgia in 1779. He later served at a battle in Guilford County, where he received a saber wound to the head, causing the loss of one eye. He was discharged in 1781.\n\nIn 1798, he and his wife, Catherine, and eight children migrated into the mountains on the north side of the \"old Indian trail.\" Merrell died in 1833."
