        "text": "11th Cavalry Civil War: Mercer Co. Ky ELEVENTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY\n\nfrom \"Union Regiments of Kentucky\"\n\nBack to Mercer Co. Main PageBack to Civil War Menu\n\nData Contributed by A. Baker, page designed by Pam Carey Ison\n\nThis regiment was recruited in the summer of 1862. Capt. Milton Graham (later Lieut. Col.) opened a camp at Harrodsburg, Ky., and Companies A,C,D & F, were recruited from the counties of Mercer, Washington & Madison and reported at rendezvous about the 11 of July. On the 22nd of Jul., his camp was removed to Frankfort Ky., in consequence of the invasion of the state, and the difficulties attending the mustering, arming and re-equipping recruits at the former place. On arriving at Frankfort, the recruits were ordered to report to Maj. A. W. Holeman, and during their stay, Company B was recruited, and from Frankfort marched to Louisville, Ky., and encamped at the fair grounds, Companies E,G,H, & I were recruited and the whole command was mustered into the United States service on the 22d of Sept.\n\nCo. E of the 11th Kentucky Cavalry was raised mostly in Dearborn County Indiana, which is across the Ohio River from Kentucky. Frederick Slater, Mayor of Aurora Indiana at the time raised the company and rode to Indianapolis to enlist but on arrival found that the quota was full. Gov. Morton sent them to Kentucky where they were mustered in as Company E of the 11th where they stayed throughout the war. As always with old records some of these names had multiple spellings but I only added 1 spelling of 1 surname each. Co. E must have had a rough time of it as I have found a number of them died and were buried at Andersonville. I have found about 30 burial sites of members of Co. E that I have put in a virtual cemetery on the web site Find A Grave. Feel free to check them out. I just started researching this Company so it is a work in progress right now, but I had a rough time finding a muster list of these men is why I would like you to add to your site so someone else might have an easier time of it.\n\nNote from Pam: Much thanks to Justin Meyer for all his work to gather the information on Company E."
