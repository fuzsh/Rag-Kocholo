Updated by the P.O.W. NETWORK. 2023\n\nSYNOPSIS: On the afternoon of April 2, 1972, two Thailand-based EB66\n\naircraft (Bat 21 and Bat 22), from the 30th Air Division, were flying\n\npathfinder escort for a cell of B52s bombing near the DMZ. Bat 21 took a\n\ndirect SAM hit and the plane went down. A single beeper signal was heard,\n\nthat of navigator Col. Iceal Hambleton. At this time it was assumed the rest\n\nof the crew died in the crash. The crew included Maj. Wayne L. Bolte, pilot;\n\n1Lt. Robin F. Gatwood, LtCol. Anthony R. Giannangeli, LtCol. Charles A.\n\nLevis, and Maj. Henry M. Serex, all crew members. It should be noted that\n\nthe lowest ranking man aboard this plane was Gatwood, a First Lieutenant.\n\nThis was not an ordinary crew, and its members, particularly Hambleton,\n\nwould be a prize capture for the enemy because of military knowledge they\n\npossessed.\n\nIt became critical, therefore, that the U.S. locate Hambleton, and any other\n\nsurviving crew members before the Vietnamese did - and the Vietnamese were\n\ntrying hard to find them first.\n\nAn Army search and rescue team was nearby and dispatched two UH1H \"slicks\"\n\nand two UH1B \"Cobras\". When they approached Hambleton's position just before\n\ndark, at about 50 feet off the ground, with one of the AH1G Cobra gunships\n\nflying at 300 feet for cover, two of the helicopters were shot down. One,\n\nthe Cobra (Blue Ghost 28) reached safety and the crew was picked up, without\n\nhaving seen the other downed helicopter. The other, a UH1H from F Troop, 8th\n\nCavalry, 196th Brigade, had just flown over some huts into a clearing when\n\nthey encountered ground fire, and the helicopter exploded. Jose Astorga, the\n\ngunner, was injured in the chest and knee by the gunfire. Astorga became\n\nunconscious, and when he recovered, the helicopter was on the ground. He\n\nfound the pilot, 1Lt. Byron K. Kulland, lying outside the helicopter. WO\n\nJohn W. Frink, the co-pilot, was strapped in his seat and conscious. The\n\ncrew chief, SP5 Ronald P. Paschall, was pinned by his leg in the helicopter,\n\nbut alive. WO Franks urged Astorga to leave them, and Astorga was captured.\n\nHe soon observed the aircraft to be hit by automatic weapons fire, and to\n\nexplode with the rest of the crew inside. He never saw the rest of the crew\n\nagain. Astorga was relesed by the North Vietnamese in 1973.\n\nThe following day, Nail 38, an OV10A equipped with electronic rescue gear\n\nenabling its crew to get a rapid \"fix\" on its rescue target entered\n\nHambleton's area and was shot down. The crew, William J. Henderson and Mark\n\nClark, both parachuted out safely. Henderson was captured and released in\n\n1973. Clark evaded for 12 days and was subsequently rescued.\n\nOn April 3, the day Nail 38 was shot down, a UH1H \"slick\" went down in the\n\nsame area carrying a crew of four enlisted Army personnel. They had no\n\ndirect connection to the rescue of Bat 21, but were very probably shot down\n\nby the same SAM installations that downed Bat 21. The helicopter, from H/HQ,\n\n37th Signal Battalion, 1st Signal Brigade, had left Marble Mountain\n\nAirfield, Da Nang, on a standard resupply mission to signal units in and\n\naround Quang Tri City. The crew, consisting of WO Douglas L. O'Neil, pilot;\n\nCW2 Larry A. Zich, co-pilot; SP5 Allen D. Christensen, crew chief; and SP4\n\nEdward W. Williams, gunner; remain missing in action.\n\nOn April 6, an attempt was made to pick up Clark and Hambleton which\n\nresulted in an HH53C helicopter being shot down. The chopper was badly hit.\n\nThe helicopter landed on its side and continued to burn, consuming the\n\nentire craft, and presumably, all 6 men aboard. The crew of this aircraft\n\nconsisted of James H. Alley; Allen J. Avery, John H. Call III, Peter H.\n\nChapman, William R. Pearson, and Roy D. Prater. Search and rescue noted no\n\nsigns of survivors, but it is felt that the Vientamese probably know the\n\nfate of this crew because of the close proximity of the downed aircraft to\n\nenemy locations.\n\nOn April 7 another Air Force OV10A went down in the area with Larry Potts\n\nand Bruce Walker aboard. Walker, the Air Force pilot of the aircraft, evaded\n\ncapture 11 days, while it is reported that Potts was captured and died in\n\nQuang Binh prison. Potts, the observer, was a Marine Corps officer. Walker's\n\nlast radio transmission to search and rescue was for SAR not to make an\n\nattempt to rescue, the enemy was closing in. Both men remain unaccounted\n\nfor.\n\nHambleton and Clark were rescued after 12 incredible days. Hambleton\n\ncontinually changed positions and reported on enemy activity as he went,\n\neven to the extent of calling in close air strikes near his position. He was\n\ntracked by a code he devised relating to the length and lie direction of\n\nvarious golf holes he knew well. Another 20 or so Americans were not so\n\nfortunate.\n\nIn July 1986, the daughter of Henry Serex learned that, one week after all\n\nsearch and rescue had been \"called off\" for Bat 21, another mission was\n\nmounted to recover \"another downed crewmember\" from Bat 21. She doesn't know\n\nwhether or not it is her father or another man on the EB66 aircraft. No\n\nadditional information has been released. When the movie \"Bat 21\" was\n\nreleased, she was horrified to learn that virtually no mention of the rest\n\nof the crew, including her father, was made.\n\nIn Vietnam, to most fighting men, the man that fought beside them, whether\n\nin the air or on the ground, was worth dying for. Each understood that the\n\nother would die for him if necessary. Thus, also considering the critical\n\nknowledge possessed by Col. Hambleton and some of the others, the seemingly\n\nuncanny means taken to recover Clark and Hambleton are not so unusual at\n\nall.\n\nWhat defies logic and explaination, however, is that the government that\n\nsent these men to battle can distort or withold information to their\n\nfamilies, and knowingly abandon hundreds of men known or strongly suspected\n\nto be in enemy hands.\n\nThousands of reports have been received by the U.S. Government indicating\n\nthat Americans are still alive, in captivity in Southeast Asia. It has been\n\n17 years for those who may have survived the 1972 Easter crashes and rescue\n\nattempts. How much longer must they wait for their country to bring \"peace\n\nwith honor\" to them and bring them home?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWilliam Henderson and his wife Colleen reside in Wisconsin."
