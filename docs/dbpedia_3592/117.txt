Herald News

Oral history from Bill Henderson - The fire was in the chem lab, and we were flooding the area with water but the fire was on top of the water so if we shut the line down the water and fire kept coming towards us, and at that time our Scott’s had a flexible hose going to the masks. I had a kink in my mask so I wasn’t getting any air I lifted the mask up to un-kink the hose and the next thing I knew, was waking up in St Joes, with no idea how I got there.
