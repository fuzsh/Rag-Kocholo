        "text": "By the end of the 1960's nearly 95% of American's had a television in their home. As a result you see a dramatic rise in the number of shows, the diversity of shows and a decline of Drive-In and traditional movie theaters.\n\nWesterns continue to be a proven winner in terms of ratings and returns, but as the nation's interests diversified and television became more prevalent a growth in Game Show programming began and produced some of the most popular game shows ever to air including The Price is Right and Jeopardy.\n\nThe rise of the Saturday morning cartoons became popular during this time as well with shows that promote traditional values and cultural trends. Shows like The Jetsons built on America's fascination with space and the future and shows like Scooby-Doo played on our growing interest in police and detective dramas.\n\nDuring this time we also see a rise in broadcast journalism reporting the news of the day both locally and nationally. While many of the shows of the time portrayed the mainstream culture in America the news showcased the rising tensions and complex political climate of the times.\n\nIn the 1960s, television was still relatively new, and there wasn’t much in the way of programming. The concept of games on television began in the 1950s, so many of the earliest game shows aired during the 1960s as well. Some of the world’s most famous game shows got their start in the 1960s, such as \"The Dating Game,\" \"Jeopardy,\" and \"The Newlywed Game.\" Not all the game shows that aired in the 1960s had a long shelf life. Shows like \"PDQ,\" \"Dream House,\" and \"The Generation Gap\" were short lived but enjoyed by audiences nonetheless.

After a merchandise item was displayed (often by beautiful models aka Pretty Purchasers), the contestants, one at a time, bid on the item. Unless otherwise specified, each bid had to be higher than the previous bid; each contestant could \"freeze,\" or stop bidding, if they believed their next bid would cause them to overbid, thus disqualifying themselves from winning the prize. The bidding continued until an undefined time limit expired. Host Cullen then announced the price of the item; the contestant who bid closest without going over won the prize (and on occasion, won either a bonus prize or got to play a bonus game). The last prize of the day usually was the most valuable and often determined the day's champion, who got to return to the next show. A special feature of the original \"Price is Right\" allowed home viewers to bid on special showcases. When the show moved to ABC, contestants competed against a celebrity player, who played for a home viewer.\" - IMDB\n\nOriginal Release March 30, 1964 – Present\n\nNo. of Seasons 39 (and counting)\n\nNo. of Episodes 8,000+\n\nStars Art Fleming, Alex Trebek, Mayim Bialik, Ken Jennings\n\nNetwork NBC\n\n\"The classic game show with a twist; the answers are revealed, but it's up to the contestants to supply the questions. Three contestants, including a returning champion, competed. Six categories are announced (e.g., Pro Football, Presidents, Science and Nature, Famous Bobs, Automobiles and Words), each having five answers ostensibly graded by difficulty, from $10 to $50. The champion chose a category and dollar amount (e.g., \"Presidents for $10\"), to which host Fleming reads the answer (\"The Father of our country; he really didn't chop down a cherry tree\"). Contestants had to respond in question form (\"Who was George Washington?\") ; if correct, they won the value of the question; if he/she was incorrect, failed to answer in time or phrase in the form of a question, that amount was deducted (hence, the dollar amount was \"always in jeopardy\") and his/her opponents could answer; having enough incorrect answers often led to negative scores. Thereafter, the contestant providing the last correct question selected next, and the process repeated. Hidden behind one of the answers was a \"Daily Double\" space, with the contestant selecting that space able to wager up to all his/her current winnings (or up to $50 if he/she had less) on the answer. After all 30 answers have been revealed (or sometimes, an undefined time limit expired), the game moved into \"Double Jeopardy!\" Gameplay was the same in \"Double Jeopardy!\" except six new categories were announced and the answers had values of $20 to $100 and two \"Daily Double\" spaces were hidden (with contestants able to wager up to $100 if they had less). At the end of the \"Double Jeopardy!\" round, all contestants with at least $1 were eligible to play \"Final Jeopardy!\"; however, anyone with $0 or a negative score was eliminated and given consolation prizes. \" - IMDB\n\nOriginal Release December 31, 1962 – September 26, 1969\n\nNo. of Seasons 7\n\nNo. of Episodes 1,760\n\nStars Gene Rayburn, Ross Shafer\n\nNetwork NBC\n\n\"This is The 1st Edition of the program.

(The only real exception was “The Honeymooners,” which aired in the mid-1950s and starred Jackie Gleason as New York City bus driver and would-be domestic batterer Ralph Kramden.) Everything changed in the 1970s, when the media “discovered” the American working class...

Minnow is shipwrecked on an uncharted tropical island following a typhoon. The seven castaways include the blustery captain, his bumbling first mate Gilligan, a millionaire couple named the Howells, curvaceous movie star Ginger Grant, sexy farm girl Mary Ann Summers, and a science professor known as the Professor. Despite their dire situation, they managed to survive on a diet made up of fish and coconut cream pie, and were aided by their trusty transistor radio and a seemingly never-ending parade of guest stars who managed to drop by their \"deserted\" island (including a big game hunter, a movie producer, a mad scientist, a rock band, Russian cosmonauts, foreign spies, and a jungle boy), yet never managed to bring them to safety \" - IMDB\n\nSaturday morning cartoons have been an integral part of the American television scene since the 1960s. Saturday morning is unlike any other time of the programming week in that the viewing audience is more monolithic than any other. At no other time do so many stations broadcast such similar material for such an extended period of time, all aimed at the same audience: children. Several generations of children have planned their weekends around the ritual of pouring huge bowls of sugar-saturated cereal and gathering about the television for the week's dose of animation. (https://www.encyclopedia.com/media/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/saturday-morning-cartoons )\n\nLate-night talk shows are truly an American contribution to the world of TV. They founded their origins from variety shows which started to take off during the 1940s and the 1950s. They were called “variety shows” because they showcased different kinds of entertainment such as comedy sketches, music and dance numbers, acrobatics, magic tricks, juggling, etc. Variety shows were typically shown on the prime-time slot (usually 7:00 to 10:00 in the evening), where most families would usually stay in their own living rooms and watch TV after a tiring day of work and household chores.\n\nLate night talk shows really hit its stride when Johnny Carson took over in 1962, and it’s from that point when The Tonight Show became a permanent fixture among the night-owls. The Tonight Show, as well as Carson himself, transformed into TV legends. Carson continued hosting The Tonight Show until his retirement in 1992, and comedian Jay Leno eventually took over the hosting chores. (https://mentalitch.com/the-short-history-of-the-late-night-talk-show/ )\n\nCongress’ 1961 decision to allow sports leagues to negotiate their own collective television contracts let the NFL set up a system to share annual television revenue equally among all teams.\n\nBefore then, big-market teams like the New York Giants could earn 10 times as much money as small-market teams like the Green Bay Packers, which gave the Giants much more cash to sign the best players. But by equally distributing the television revenue — in addition to sharing revenue from other sources, such as merchandising and ticket sales — the league ensures that every team has the financial ability to compete on and off the field.\n\nThe NFL’s revenue sharing has maintained competitiveness across all teams and has helped the league avoid financial disparities faced by other sports that gave teams nearly insurmountable advantages. (https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/impact-of-television/ )\n\nSuper Bowl I took place on January 15, 1967, and included the NFL’s Green Bay Packers against the AFL’s Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThe game was held at the Los Angeles Coliseum, and even though ticket prices averaged just $12, it was the only Super Bowl that didn’t sell out.\n\nStill, the game aired on two different networks and drew in an audience of more than 61,000 fans.\n\nThe Packers outperformed the Chiefs, winning 35-10. The next year, the Packers decisively won again in Super Bowl II, defeating the Oakland Raiders 33-14. Many began to question whether the AFL teams could hold their own in the NFL.\n\nBut the next year, the AFL’s New York Jets, led by quarterback Joe Namath, defeated the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. Super Bowl IV was the last game played between the two leagues, and the AFL’s Kansas City Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings, 23-7. (https://www.history.com/topics/sports/super-bowl-history )"
