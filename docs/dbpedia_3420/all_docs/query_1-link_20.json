        "text": "T The 1980s were an amazing decade for filmmaking. Even four decades later, the best movies of the ‘80s continue to endure, being quoted across social media, referenced in conversations, and held up as the standard for modern movies. You can find ‘80s films on every list of the most popular movies ever made, in a decade where such box office and critical gems range from the action and angst of Top Gun to the vision of Do the Right Thing. Classic ‘80s movies will make you laugh, think and pull you to the edge of your seat. Here is a list of top ‘80s movies that still hold up today.\n\nTop Films From The 1980s\n\nThe big box office hits of the ‘80s, including the highest-grossing film of the decade, E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, all made our list. So did big-name directors like Amy Heckerling, Spike Lee and Steven Spielberg. Many of these classic ‘80s movies star actors popular today, such as Eddie Murphy, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise.\n\nGenres represented on the list include comedy, horror, action, foreign and science fiction. Five of these ‘80s films came out in 1980, and the oldest is Empire Strikes Back, which came out on May 21, 1980—two days before The Elephant Man.\n\n40. This Is Spinal Tap (1984)\n\nFans of The Office, Modern Family and other contemporary mockumentaries have this R-rated film to thank. The fictional documentary follows a once-popular metal band trying to get back on track and stars Rob Reiner (who also directed), Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, who all worked on the screenplay.\n\nIt remains one of the top films on Rotten Tomatoes with a 96% fresh rating, and people still quote the most famous line (“These go to 11.”). You can watch This Is Spinal Tap on Philo and Sling.\n\n39. Poltergeist (1982)\n\nThe spooky story of a family whose house is haunted by spirits who communicate with them through the TV, Poltergeist stars Craig T. Nelson and JoBeth Williams as the worried parents who turn to an exorcist to un-haunt the home. The PG-rated film received good reviews and has an 88% Rotten Tomatoes rating.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the things this classic horror movie became best known today for is the subsequent tragic deaths of two of its stars, 12-year-old Heather O’Rourke (who uttered the famous “they’re here!”) and 22-year-old Dominique Dunne. You can watch Poltergeist on YouTube, Apple TV+, Vudu, Amazon Prime Video and Google Play Movies & TV.\n\n38. Heathers (1988)\n\nBefore there was Mean Girls, there was Heathers, a film about a girl clique so toxic that it leads to murder, mayhem and a few staged suicides—plus the most infamous game of croquet in movie history. Stars Winona Ryder and Christian Slater solidified their reputations as burgeoning stars with the R-rated film.\n\nDirector Michael Lehmann’s project was a huge critical hit and resonated so resoundingly that it got a Broadway musical makeover decades after its release. You can watch Heathers on Pluto TV, Roku Channel, PLEX, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Hulu, Sling, Philo, Apple TV+, Google Play Movies & TV and Vudu.\n\n37. Blue Velvet (1986)\n\nDirector David Lynch’s R-rated mystery launched Kyle MacLachlan’s career and also sparked controversy because of the dark, sexual and violent material in the script, about a college student who returns home to care for his father and becomes entangled in a strange case after finding a severed ear. Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini also star.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of, the erotic and sometimes depraved imagery, the film became a critical hit and remains a cult classic. You can watch Blue Velvet on Showtime, YouTube, Hulu, fuboTV, Sling, Paramount+, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n36. Bull Durham (1988)\n\nBull Durham is a film about an aging baseball player (Kevin Costner) helping along a younger hotshot (Tim Robbins) while they pine over Susan Sarandon’s Annie Savoy. Ron Shelton wrote and directed the film, which earned an Oscar nod for screenplay and a Golden Globe nomination for Sarandon.\n\nThe R-rated movie has a robust 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. You can watch Bull Durham on Max, YouTube, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n35. My Dinner With Andre (1981)\n\nDirector Louis Malle hit the jackpot with this cerebral PG-rated film about two friends (played by Wallace Shawn and André Gregory) who meet up after years apart. Their lives have gone in different directions, with Gregory’s character finding success and traveling the world while Shawn’s struggled. The two actors also wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe comedic drama’s simple concept plays on universally held emotions, and the film received very strong reviews. You can watch My Dinner With Andre on Max, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+.\n\n34. Say Anything … (1989)\n\nThis film marked the symbolic passing of the teen movie torch from director John Hughes to director Cameron Crowe, whose love story about average guy Lloyd (John Cusack) romancing valedictorian Diane (Ione Skye) made teenagers swoon. It features the famous scene of Lloyd standing outside Diane’s window with a boom box playing Peter Gabriel’s In Your Eyes.\n\nThe PG-13 movie received rapturous reviews, paving the way for a long directorial and writing career for Crowe. You can watch Say Anything ... on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n33. Raising Arizona (1987)\n\nThe Coen brothers’ second movie, Raising Arizona, is a farce about an infertile couple (Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter) who kidnap a baby from a set of quintuplets. The parents send a bounty hunter after the kidnappers, and laughs and chaos ensue.\n\nEthan Coen directed the PG-13 film, a critical smash, and co-wrote it with brother Joel. It prompted such classic lines as, “I’ll be taking these Huggies and whatever cash you’ve got.” You can watch Raising Arizona on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n32. Lean on Me (1989)\n\nFive-time Academy Award nominee Morgan Freeman turned in two superb performances in 1989, one in Driving Miss Daisy and the other in Lean on Me, where he played a tough-as-nails principal brought in to crack down on drugs and fighting in a struggling New Jersey school. The PG-13 film was based on a true story.\n\nJohn G. Avildsen directed the movie, which received decent reviews and has become a staple on basic cable in the decades since. You can watch Lean on Me on YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n31. I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988)\n\nOne of the top comedy directors of the ‘80s and ‘90s, Keenen Ivory Wayans helmed and starred in this sendup of blaxploitation films that also starred up-and-comers Marlon Wayans (Keena’s brother and later In Living Color co-star) and Chris Rock, who hadn’t yet joined Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe movie has become a cult favorite. You can watch I’m Gonna Git You Sucka on tubi, Pluto TV, Roku Channel, YouTube, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Philo, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n30. Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)\n\nWith a list of stars that reads like a who’s who of 1980s stardom, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Phoebe Cates, Sean Penn, Judge Reinhold and Nicholas Cage, Amy Heckerling’s directorial debut delivers a fun and insightful look at high school life in the early ‘80s.\n\nIt’s known for stoner Jeff Spiccoli’s quote, “All I need are some tasty waves, a cool buzz, and I'm fine.” You can watch Fast Times at Ridgemont High on Peacock, Roku Channel, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n29. Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nWhile there have been sequels and reboots of Ghostbusters, including one in spring 2024, nothing compares to the original spirit-stopping crew of Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson, who headlined director Ivan Reitman’s PG-rated film. From the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man to, “He slimed me,” the film lives on in pop culture.\n\nIt received good reviews upon release and has only gotten more popular. You can watch Ghostbusters on Sling, fubo, Hulu, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n28. Big (1989)\n\nThe iconic rendition of “Chopsticks” on Big’s huge F.A.O. Schwarz piano is just one of the memorable moments from this PG-rated film about a 12-year-old boy whose wish to become “big” turns him into a 30-year-old man. Hanks’ standout performance and sharp observations about adulthood make this a comedy parents and kids love.\n\nDirected by Penny Marshall, Big earned an Academy Award nomination for Hanks and received wide critical acclaim. You can watch Big on Disney+, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n27. Purple Rain (1984)\n\nPrince’s genius is on full display in this R-rated rock musical about The Kid (Prince), whose band is on the rise and who struggles to navigate his relationship with his girlfriend and his troubled father while staying on top of the music scene. The film, directed by Albert Magnoli, was loosely based on Prince’s life.\n\nThe soundtrack is transcendent, of course, and the movie has ascended to cult status over the years. You can watch Purple Rain on Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n26. Sophie’s Choice (1982)\n\nA young writer (Peter MacNicol) becomes consumed with the heartbreaking story of Sophie, a Holocaust survivor forced to make a horrifying choice, in this R-rated film directed by Alan J. Pakula. Meryl Streep gives one of the standout performances of her impressive career as Sophie, for which she won an Oscar.\n\nThe film was based on the book of the same name and earned strong critical reviews. You can watch Sophie’s Choice on tubi, Pluto TV, Peacock, Sling, Crackle, PLEX, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, fuboTV, Philo, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, Redbox, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n25. She’s Gotta Have It (1986)\n\nThe first of two Spike Lee-directed movies on our list, She’s Gotta Have It follows a young Black woman (Tracy Camilla Johns) and the three men she pursues relationships with because they all have something she wants—but none of them have it all. Lee’s low-budget film earned great acclaim.\n\nThe director also introduced the legendary character of Mars Blackmon with the movie, which was rebooted as a Netflix series decades later. You can watch She’s Gotta Have It on Apple TV+.\n\n24. Coming to America (1988)\n\nEddie Murphy shined brighter than nearly anyone during the ‘80s, and in Coming to America, he plays an African prince who journeys to America with a sidekick played by Arsenio Hall to escape an arranged marriage and find love on his own. Murphy and Hall’s chemistry (they also play other characters) makes the movie shine.\n\nThe movie has remained so popular that Amazon Prime Video made a sequel in 2021. You can watch Coming to America on Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n23. Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure (1985)\n\nTim Burton made his directorial debut with this whimsical film about eccentric Pee-Wee, following his cross-country adventures as he tries to find his stolen bike. Paul Reubens’ Pee-Wee became a pop culture touchstone, with the movie launching a lauded kids’ show and two sequels.\n\nPee-Wee’s sing-song retort, “I know you are, but what am I?,” became nearly as iconic as his bow-tie. You can watch Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n22. Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nThe original Star Wars trilogy concluded with the daring rescue of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from Jabba the Hut and the epic final battle between the Empire and the Rebels, led by Solo, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). Director Richard Marquand’s PG-rated film finished as one of the ‘80s’ top-grossing films.\n\nThe movie also sparked countless pop culture touchstones, including quotes like, “There will be no bargain, young Jedi,” and “I'll never turn to the dark side.” You can watch Return of the Jedi on Disney+, Hulu, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n21. The Color Purple (1985)\n\nThe success of the 2023 film has revived interest in director Steven Spielberg’s original, which features one of the best performances of Whoopi Goldberg’s career. She plays Celie, a young woman married off to an abusive husband (Danny Glover) who finds solace in her relationship with singer Shug (Margaret Avery).\n\nGoldberg received an Oscar nod for Best Actress for the PG-13 film, which was based on the classic novel and featured a star turn by Oprah Winfrey. The movie received outstanding reviews, and can be seen on Max, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n20. Batman (1989)\n\nThe film that arguably started the modern superhero craze, Batman is another Burton film featuring an oddball protagonist (Michael Keaton’s understated turn as Bruce Wayne) who battles the sadistic Joker (a magnificent Jack Nicholson) for control of Gotham. The movie earned multiple Golden Globe nominations and also featured Kim Basinger.\n\nThe film prompted many sequels and several reboots, with actors including George Clooney, Christian Bale and Robert Pattinson taking on the title role. You can watch Batman on tubi, Max, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n19. The Elephant Man (1980)\n\nThe second Lynch-directed film on the list, the PG-rated movie tells the true story of Joseph Carey Merrick (John Hurt), a young man with a congenital illness that causes disfiguration who spends much of his life as a sideshow worker. Anthony Hopkins plays a surgeon who takes an interest in Merrick.\n\nThe film earned eight Academy Award nominations, though it didn’t win any. You can watch The Elephant Man on Paramount+, Roku Channel, YouTube, Philo, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n18. Beverly Hills Cop (1984)\n\nAnother Murphy film, in which he plays brash detective Axel Foley (inspiration for the famed song Axel F), is one of the signature comedies of the decade. The R-rated movie follows Foley as he tries to find out who killed his best friend. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Lisa Eilbacher also star, and Martin Brest directs.\n\nMurphy’s well-known laugh is one of the best-remembered parts of the film, which earned another sequel in 2024. You can watch Beverly Hills Cop on Netflix, Sling, Paramount+, Hulu, fuboTV, Roku Channel, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n17. When Harry Met Sally (1989)\n\nMeg Ryan became queen of the rom-com partly based on this R-rated film following the slow-blossoming romance between Ryan’s Sally and Billy Crystal’s Harry, who have a long-running debate about whether a man and a woman can remain platonic friends (ultimately undone by their own experience). Rob Reiner directed the Golden Globe-nominated film.\n\nOne of the most-quoted lines of the ‘80s came after Sally fakes an orgasm in a diner, and the woman sitting near her (played by Reiner’s mom, Estelle) quips to the waitress, “I’ll have what she’s having.” You can watch When Harry Met Sally on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n16. Glory (1989)\n\nWith an all-star cast including Denzel Washington (who won an Oscar), Morgan Freeman and Andre Braugher, Glory follows the Civil War experience of the the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first all-Black U.S. regiment, when a white colonel (Matthew Broderick) takes command. Edward Zwick directed the R-rated film.\n\nWashington became an A-list actor after the film, which was based on true events but included fictional characters. You can watch Glory on Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n15. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)\n\nAnother of the top five-grossing movies of the ‘80s, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom continues the adventures of the archeologist played by Ford, whose story began in Raiders of the Lost Ark. In the sequel directed by Spielberg, Indy and Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) fight an evil ancient cult in India.\n\nThe PG film has some gory moments, which actually led to the creation of the PG-13 rating a few months after it came out. You can watch Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom on Disney+, Paramount+, Pluto TV, Roku Channel, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n14. Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988)\n\nWomen on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, the only foreign film on the list, became Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar’s breakthrough international movie, though he’d directed previous ones. The film noir comedy follows a woman (Carmen Maura) trying to figure out why her lover abruptly left. It also stars Almodóvar favorite Antonio Banderas.\n\nThe well-reviewed film received a slew of award nominations, winning a Best International Film Oscar. You can watch Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown on Vudu, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+.\n\n13. The Blues Brothers (1980)\n\nElwood (Dan Akroyd) and his recently incarcerated brother Jake (John Belushi) aim to raise money to save the orphanage where they grew up by reuniting their band, which turns out to be a (very funny) disaster. The film, directed by John Landis, originated as an SNL skit.\n\nKnown for the catchphrases, “We’re on a mission from God” and, “We’re putting the band back together,” The Blues Brothers featured many real-life star blues musicians. You can watch The Blues Brothers on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n12. E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)\n\nWhen young Elliott (Henry Thomas) finds an alien in his backyard, he tries to hide him from his mom while helping his out-of-this-world friend return to his home planet as the government pursues them both. The Spielberg movie helped launch Drew Barrymore’s career and was the highest-grossing film of the decade.\n\nThe catchphrase, “E.T. phone home,” became popular in the ‘80s, and the PG movie’s tie-in with Reese’s Pieces drew tons of attention. You can watch E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n11. The Shining (1980)\n\nThe top-ranked horror film on the list follows writer Jack Torrance (Nicholson) as he slowly loses his grip on reality during an isolated stay with his family in a Colorado hotel, where his son, Danny, begins having unsettling premonitions. Stanley Kubrick directed the R-rated classic.\n\nIt spawned a number of famous quotes, including, “Red rum, red rum!” and, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” You can watch The Shining on Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n10. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)\n\nThe first Indiana Jones film features Ford’s archeologist battling the Nazis, as he did in future films, on a quest to recover the famed Ark of the Covenant. Karen Allen also stars in the movie known for the extra-large bolder rolling toward Indy in an early scene.\n\nSpielberg also directed this PG film, which introduces Indy’s fear of a certain reptile (“Snakes, why’d it have to be snakes,” he laments while peering into a snake-filled room). You can watch Raiders of the Lost Ark on Pluto TV, Disney+, Paramount+, YouTube, Roku Channel, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n9. Raging Bull (1980)\n\nMartin Scorsese’s Best Picture nominee stars Robert DeNiro (who won an Oscar) as middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta, whose real-life rise and fall in the 1940s and ‘50s became a cautionary tale of violence and abuse. The film garnered excellent reviews for DeNiro and has since become one of the most acclaimed movies of all time.\n\nOft-quoted lines from the film include, “Don’t go down for nobody,” and, “If you win, you win. If you lose, you still win.” You can watch Raging Bull on Pluto TV, YouTube, Roku Channel, Philo, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n8. Die Hard (1988)\n\nWhen New York City policeman John McClane (Bruce Willis) comes to see his estranged wife and their kids on Christmas, he gets an unexpected assignment: save a high-rise from terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman). Director John McTiernan melds action, romance and a bit of comedy in the R-rated movie.\n\nThe most-quoted line, “Yippe-ki-yay, mother******,” has become one of the most well-known catchphrases in film. You can watch Die Hard on Hulu, YouTube, Roku Channel, Philo, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n7. Blade Runner (1982)\n\nOne of the best sci-fi movies of all time, Blade Runner is a Ridley Scott classic in which Ford plays a Replicant Hunter assigned to find four Replicants. His mission becomes complicated when he falls in love with a Replicant (Sean Young).\n\nThe movie spawned a sequel, Blade Runner 2049, decades later. You can watch Blade Runner on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n6. Do the Right Thing (1989)\n\nLee’s second film on the list shows what happens when racial tensions flair during a heat wave in Brooklyn, where a local pizzeria becomes the center of the conflict, which escalates to deadly levels. Lee, who also wrote the script, based the story on a true incident in Howard Beach neighborhood of New York City.\n\nThe movie marked the feature film debuts of Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez and also featured actors including Danny Aiello, Ruby Dee, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro and Lee himself. You can watch Do the Right Thing on Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n5. The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\n“Luke, I am your father.” Those words near the end of The Empire Strikes Back completely change the Star Wars universe, closing out the darkest and arguably best chapter in the original trilogy, which sees Luke (Hamill), Han (Ford) and Leia (Fisher) continuing their fight against the Empire.\n\nThe PG-rated saga introduced Yoda and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to the story as well. You can watch The Empire Strikes Back on Sling, fuboTV, Hulu, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n4. Back to the Future (1985)\n\nMarty McFly (Michael J. Fox at the peak of his popularity) accidentally goes back in time and messes with his parents’ meet-cute, sparking desperate measures to ensure they have a future together—and to get Marty back to his own time. Christopher Lloyd plays a nutty professor role, and he and Fox have terrific chemistry.\n\nThe PG-rated Robert Zemeckis film inspired many catchphrases from, “1.21 gigawatts!” to “Doc, are you telling me you built a time machine out of a DeLorean?” to “Roads? Where we’re going, we don’t need roads.” You can watch Back to the Future on Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n3. The Goonies (1985)\n\nThe film about a band of misfits (played by Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Quan and other popular ‘80s actors) trying to find a pirate’s buried treasure to help save their neighborhood reflects the underdog story so many people love. Richard Donner directed the family-friendly, PG film, which got good reviews upon its release.\n\nGoonies later became a cult hit, and rumors of a sequel have leaked online for years, though nothing has been filmed. You can watch The Goonies on tubi, Sling, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n2. Top Gun (1986)\n\nMaverick (Tom Cruise) lives up to his name with a cocky attitude and a taste for flaunting the rules. He meets his match in Iceman (Val Kilmer), who’s tough to fluster and even tougher to beat in the air. They battle it out for air supremacy at the Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School (also known as “Top Gun”) in Tony Scott’s PG film.\n\nThe beloved movie didn’t wow critics upon its release (aside from the action scenes) but has become more appreciated with time and with 2022’s much-lauded sequel. You can watch Top Gun on Pluto TV, YouTube, Sling, Paramount+, Roku Channel, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\n1. The Breakfast Club (1985)\n\n“A brain... and an athlete... and a basket case... a princess... and a criminal.” The Breakfast Club introduced its characters in a unique way, and it told their stories that way, too. It explores what happens when five disparate students spend a Saturday detention letting down their guards and opening up in new ways.\n\nThe R-rated film, starring “Brat Packers” Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez and Ally Sheedy, was one of many John Hughes movies to earn acclaim in the ‘80s. You can watch The Breakfast Club on Hulu, YouTube, Max, Amazon Prime Video, Google Play Movies & TV, Apple TV+ and Vudu.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe ‘80s launched so many classic films, from horror to comedy to drama. From teen movies to rom-coms, the decade had it all, with some of the best talent in front of and behind the camera. You will enjoy all the films on this list no matter how many times you watch them."
