        "text": "1) Mahogany, 1975\n\nDiana Ross stars as Tracy, a fashion design student who is discovered by a fashion photographer Sean (Anthony Perkins) in the department store where she works. Tracy becomes the It model of the moment and an overnight sensation when she travels to Rome to walk all the major runways. Diana Ross epitomizes '70s glamour with a wardrobe full of floppy oversized hats, luxe furs and sequined evening looks—the looks are a must-see for any fashion lover.\n\n2) Annie Hall, 1977\n\nIn the role that launched her as an androgynous style icon, Diane Keaton stars as the title character in this classic Woody Allen film. The menswear-inspired movie costume went on to create one of the major '70s fashion trends that still reigns an influence to this day, from men's button-down shirts and wide-legged khakis to that iconic tuxedo vest.\n\n3) Love Story, 1970\n\nAli MacGraw and Ryan O'Neal play two star-crossed lovers in one of the most classic American love tragedies of all time. While the film isn't related to fashion, Ali MacGraw's All-American style perfectly captures the '70s look (which serves as the ultimate style inspiration for dressing this season). MacGraw's character, Jenny Cavalleri, sports a wardrobe of perfectly-oversized camel coats, collegiate sweaters and chic hats that will make you want to immediately mimic.\n\n4) The Great Gatsby, 1974\n\nBefore there was Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan as Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, there were Robert Redford and Mia Farrow starring in the original '70s movie based on the classic novel. With costumes helmed by Theoni V. Aldredge, the film took home the Oscar for Costume Design in 1974. Ralph Lauren also contributed to the film's fashion by dressing Gatsby in that now infamous pale pink suit, helping to cement his status as a designer in the '70s. The movie fashion was also credited to the '20s style revival that occurred in the '70s—with the glitzy, sequin night party looks especially.\n\n5) The Godfather, 1972\n\nThe Godfather can teach both men and women a style lesson or two. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino managed to make organized crime look stylish in luxe suits—bringing a new definition to the term \"power suit.\" The mob-based film charts style from the late '40s and gives ladies a dose of inspiration with the help of Diane Keaton as mob wife Kay Adams. Keaton's style takes a leap from her Annie Hall wardrobe with feminine frocks, oversized hats and fur coats.\n\n6) Grease, 1978\n\nCapturing the classic style of the '50s, the fashion in Grease steals the scene throughout the movie. From the feminine looks worn by Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) to the rebellious greaser style of leather jackets and jeans worn by Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and the T-Birds, the movie epitomized the teenage fashion scene of the '50s. Plus, Sandy's transition from innocently feminine poodle-skirt teen to rebellious head-to-toe leather badass still reigns as one of the most iconic fashion makeovers of all time.\n\n7) The Stepford Wives, 1975\n\nKatharine Ross and Paula Prentiss star in this sci-fi thriller that chronicles the wives of Stepford, Connecticut and their unusual behavior. The put-together cast of women are always dressed to the tee, making housework, grocery shopping and cooking look like it belongs in a fashion editorial. The term \"Stepford Wife\" has remained relevant to this day and still surfaces in trends, editorials and cultural references. The '70s maxi dresses, prints and wide-brimmed hats meet the traditional housewife look of the '50s for a sartorial hit.\n\n8) Saturday Night Fever, 1977\n\nTony Manero (John Travolta) and Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) fall in love as dance partners who attend the Saturday night disco scene of the '70s. While disco fashion didn't last long, Saturday Night Fever is the glamorous VIP pass into the style of the dance-centric era, channeled after the famous Studio 54 scene. From John Travolta's iconic white suit to Karen Lynn Gorney's off-the-shoulder red dress, the film's glam looks are not to be missed.\n\n9) Klute, 1971\n\nJane Fonda stars as New York City call girl Bree Daniels in this dramatic thriller which won her her first Oscar for Best Actress. Costume designer Ann Roth created Fonda's movie look, which incorporated all of the major '70s trends—Fonda's on-screen style was ruled by flared pants, mini skirts, knee-high boots and an amazing dress with a deep v-neck and back-baring cut. All of the actress's movie looks paired with her shag haircut make it the quintessential wardrobe of the decade."
