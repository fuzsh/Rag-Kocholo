        "text": "Amidst the whirlwind of awards season coverage, Chapman University invites you to “Films for Peace and Justice,” a series of screenings at the Folino Theater in Dodge College (ranked the #4 film school) featuring Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Nadia Murad on Tuesday, March 12, at 7 p.m.\n\nThis event marks the culmination of a collaboration between undergraduate students and Murad, recently named one of Time Magazine’s 12 Women of the Year. Throughout the spring 2023 semester, 19 Chapman film and peace studies students, under the guidance of faculty from Dodge College and Wilkinson College, worked alongside Murad to create powerful documentaries addressing critical issues related to her advocacy for victims of genocide and sexual assault worldwide. “Films for Peace and Justice” showcases the best films made in cross disciplinary student groups and will be utilized to help train international workers for work in the field, raise issues with governments and international organizations, and bring attention to Murad’s work.\n\nThe short films, supported by professionals in documentary filmmaking, offer poignant insights into the struggles faced by survivors and underscore the urgent need for peace and justice. They are just one example of the course’s lasting impact, participants say. Over the semester, the students also learned:\n\nHow to turn immersive research and extensive preparation into intensely meaningful storytelling.\n\nHow the perspective of peace studies majors can enhance the work of documentarians, and vice versa.\n\nHow following the Murad Code of ethical interviewing and conduct can illuminate experience without evoking previously documented trauma.\n\nHow survivors of sexual violence have much more to offer the world than just retelling stories of the horrors they endured.\n\n“It’s a chance to consider why we have tended to focus on the violence instead of on the work Nadia is doing to support her community and other women,” said Lisa Leitz, associate professor and Delp-Wilkinson Endowed Chair in Peace Studies. Leitz co-taught the course with Christine Fugate, assistant professor of film and an award-winning documentarian.\n\nJoin us as we explore peace studies through the lens of documentary filmmaking and honor the resilience of survivors like Nadia Murad.\n\n###\n\nAbout: Nadia Murad\n\nHuman rights activist and recipient of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize, Nadia Murad is a leading advocate for survivors of genocide and sexual violence. Her New York Times bestselling memoir, The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State, is a harrowing account of the genocide against the Yazidi ethno-religious minority in Iraq and Nadia’s imprisonment by the so-called Islamic State (ISIS).\n\nAbout Chapman University\n\nFounded in 1861, Chapman University is a nationally ranked private university in Orange, California, about 30 miles south of Los Angeles.
