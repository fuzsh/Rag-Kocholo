        "text": "The modern horror movie was born inside a Ford Thunderbird convertible in the spring of 1968. George Romero, a young Pittsburgh filmmaker, was driving to New York with the print of his first directorial effort in the trunk. Night of the Flesh-Eaters had cost a little more than $100,000 to make, and Romero’s plan was to sell it to Columbia Pictures, make a tidy profit, and then concentrate on films that he really cared about. But his calculus changed after a bulletin came on the radio. “We heard that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated,” Romero says. “And I’m going, Man, this is good for us.”\n\nRomero was personally upset by the news, to be sure, but he couldn’t help considering its implications for his movie, whose defiant black hero fights off an army of the undead only to be gunned down by an all-white posse. For the first time, Romero realized that he might be onto something bigger than just a few good scares—and he was right. The picture was turned down by Columbia but picked up by a smaller distributor, which renamed it Night of the Living Dead. It became an instant hit at drive-ins, in large part because of its extreme gore, including a scene of a little girl drooling blood as she feasts on her dead mother’s flesh. But others were taking it seriously. A critic from the influential French magazine Cahiers du Cinéma praised the film, claiming that it was more about racism than zombies. “When it came out, Night of the Living Dead was powerful shit,” says the director John Landis (who paid homage to the movie in the video for Michael Jackson’s “Thriller”). “When the law enforcement show up at the end and say, ‘Shoot him in the head,’ it was very real and current.”\n\nHorror had been stuck in a musty, cobwebbed past filled with Victorian ghost stories and evil scientists that didn’t frighten a generation of young people used to seeing bloody images from Vietnam and the civil-rights backlash. “In the 60s, horror wasn’t much of anything,” says Alan Ormsby, who went on to write the screenplay for his own zombie film, Deathdream, in 1970. “There was Vincent Price stuff and the Hammer movies, which weren’t so good anymore. Night of the Living Dead seemed to make a social statement. I didn’t realize a horror film could have that kind of intelligence.”\n\nNeither did Romero. “It was all the 60s,” he says inside his modest Toronto apartment, flashing a child-like grin that seems at odds with his severe black glasses and intimidating height. (He’s almost six and a half feet tall.) “We were automatically disenchanted with authority, but we didn’t particularly care about the war.” John Russo, who wrote the script with Romero, is more blunt: “All that [political] stuff’s bullshit.”\n\nLike so many classic horror films from the era, Night of the Living Dead was a backup plan. When Romero couldn’t get funding for Whine of the Fawn, a “Bergmanesque” coming-of-age film set in the Dark Ages, he tried something more commercial. “We didn’t know anyone who had any horses, so a Western was out,” says the producer Russ Streiner. “And we didn’t live by the water, so we couldn’t do a beach movie. That left horror.”\n\nRomero and nine of his friends put up $600 each to make the movie. (Investors would be brought in later.) Then, in good democratic fashion, they opened the floor for a debate over who would direct. There were several candidates, including Russo, but Romero made the case that he was the most experienced, since he had spent years working in TV news. Romero had also made short movies for Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood. “One of my first films was ‘Mister Rogers Gets a Tonsillectomy,’” Romero says. “Possibly the scariest film I ever made.”\n\nNight of the Living Dead spawned a career of political zombie movies for Romero (his latest, Diary of the Dead, opens February 15) and influenced more directors than any horror film besides Psycho. But while it was unusually topical and bloody, it was also, in some ways, the same old monster movie. Romero took the plot from Richard Matheson’s 1954 novel, I Am Legend (which would also form the basis for Will Smith’s recent blockbuster), and the dialogue retains the campy ring of the 1950s. What really distinguished it was the casting of African-American actor Duane Jones as Ben. The character was originally supposed to be a white truckdriver, but plans changed after Jones auditioned. “We thought he was the best actor,” Romero says. Jones, who went on to become a theater professor before dying of heart failure at age 52, distrusted Romero’s motives, suspecting that he was using his race in an exploitative way. He insisted on playing Ben not as a roughneck trucker but as a proud man who had stolen a pickup to escape the zombies. Romero allowed that change, but he refused to alter the scene where Ben slaps the blonde Barbra to get her to calm down. “Duane said, ‘You’re asking me to hit a white woman. You know what’s going to happen when I walk out of the theater?,’” Romero recalls. “We kept saying, ‘Come on—it’s a new day.’”\n\nAlmost four decades later, 20 of George Romero’s filmmaking heirs got together at a crowded Hollywood restaurant for one of their regular dinners. They had a lot to talk about, including decapitation, cannibalism, and the art of slitting a woman’s throat. “It’s not as easy as it looks,” says Joseph Zito, director of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (which was, of course, far from it). These filmmakers call themselves, half-jokingly, the Masters of Horror. Quietly working on their salads were Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream) and Tobe Hooper (The Texas Chain Saw Massacre), who, together with Romero, revolutionized horror in the 1970s with a series of cheaply made, highly graphic exploitation films that were originally released in local markets. “[They] created the horror film, and we’re all copying them,” says Tim Sullivan, the director of 2001 Maniacs (2005) and its upcoming sequel, 2001 Maniacs: Beverly Hellbillys. “They should be talked about like Scorsese and Coppola.”\n\nMovies like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre andHalloween now receive the kind of worshipful admiration that used to be reserved for classic Universal horror films of the 1930s, such as Dracula and Frankenstein. They are celebrated in museums, remade by studios in glossy, wildly profitable productions, and imitated so often that they have become part of the architecture of our nightmares. As one can surmise from its growing presence at cinemas and video stores, horror has evolved from a minor niche into a billion-dollar industry—an integral part of the Hollywood economy.\n\nBefore the entrée was served, Mick Garris, who had produced a Showtime series called Masters of Horror, directed by several of the regular attendees (including John Landis, Joe Dante, and John Carpenter), announced that NBC had ordered a 13-episode series of the show, renamed Fear Itself. The first episodes are scheduled to air this summer. Then the fresh-faced director Eli Roth (Hostel), who had spent most of the evening chatting with Robert Rodriguez (Grindhouse), stood up to make a toast. “I want to thank you,” he said to his grinning table-mates, “for providing so much material for me to steal.”\n\nHorror movies have always been disreputable, but just how disreputable is a source of some debate. Tobe Hooper and John Carpenter—both of whom describe their first encounter with Night of the Living Dead as a road-to-Damascus moment—once argued the point. Hooper’s position was that the industry sees horror as a formulaic genre, like the B Westerns. “John disagreed,” Hooper recalls. “He said, ‘They think of us like pornography.’”\n\nIt is true that the lines between horror and porn were often blurry in the 1970s, at the height of “porn chic.” They played at the same theaters, featured some of the same actors, and were financed or distributed by the same sleazy characters. Bryanston Pictures, a New York distributor with alleged Mafia connections, used the millions it made from the blockbuster sex film Deep Throat to release Hooper’s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Dark Star, the first film by John Carpenter. Porn was also a great way for horror directors such as Wes Craven, who had no connections or experience, to get their start.\n\n“It was everywhere in those days,” says Craven, a gangly and graying scholarly type who speaks in full paragraphs. “Norman Mailer toyed with people making love on-screen. There was a sense that things were busting loose and changing and maybe we can make the first great porn film. You know, like *Caligula—*but good.” As an aspiring director, however, Craven had a problem: he knew very little about sex, and even less about movies. For an auteur who did more than anyone else to push blood and violence into mainstream America, Craven had a remarkably sheltered childhood. He grew up in a working-class Baptist family in Cleveland, under the strict religious rule of a secretive widow. After marrying young and having two kids, he moved to New York, where he took work synching dailies on a soft-core movie called Together (tagline: “Look for yourself! Judge for yourself! See what your children can show you about love!”), featuring the porn star Marilyn Chambers. Craven, who eventually earned the title of assistant editor, learned the rudiments of filmmaking from Together director Sean Cunningham, who would go on to launch the lucrative Friday the 13th franchise.\n\nThese future titans of the horror genre became fast friends, even if they made something of an odd couple. Cunningham, who defines horror as “affirmative action for the writing-impaired,” was a savvy entrepreneur, while Craven, a quiet, contemplative kid with a literary streak, seemed like the professor of exploitation. It was their combination of talents that led to one of the most infamous films of the era.\n\nDirected by Craven and produced by Cunningham, Last House on the Left (1972) was a new kind of horror film. Instead of zombies, vampires, or werewolves, the monsters this time were normal people—and the violence was not so much scary as nauseating. Loosely based on Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring, the story follows a gang of escaped killers who abduct, torture, and kill two middle-class girls. Their leader, a brute named Krug, was the predecessor of Freddy Krueger, the razor-fingered villain of A Nightmare on Elm Street. In an absurd coincidence, the killers seek shelter with the parents of one of their victims, who, upon discovering the identity of their guests, take savage revenge.\n\nUnlike other horror films that cut away from the worst violence, Last House on the Left (which is being remade by director Dennis Iliadis for a 2009 release) lingered on the faces of the victims with a realism that remains almost unbearable to watch. David Hess, who played Krug with a coiled, maniacal aggression, approached the role with a Method actor’s intensity. “I was very mean to the girls, so when it came to the rape scene, [Sandra Cassell] didn’t have to act,” he says, referring to a co-star who played one of the victims. “I told her, ‘I’m really going to fuck you if you don’t behave yourself. They’ll just let the camera run. I’m going to devastate you.’ I don’t think she was too happy about that.”\n\nCraven and Cunningham shot the film in five weeks, ruthlessly holding down costs by keeping salaries low and staying, along with their young, bohemian cast and crew, at Cunningham’s mother’s house in Connecticut. Predictably enough, pot smoking and casual sex ensued. (Hess describes the actresses as “very friendly, 100 percent friendly, if you know what I mean.”) Meanwhile, the artistic team put together the script and production schedule on the fly. While the final product is brazenly gory and sadistic, it’s tame compared with the original script. “I was supposed to cut the tits off a girl and eat them,” says Jeramie Rain, who played Sadie, a member of Krug’s gang. “I told Wes, ‘I couldn’t do that. What would my mother think?’”\n\nCraven says the violence was inspired in part by Vietnam War newsreels. In that sense, Last House on the Left anticipates more recent torture-filled films such as Hostel and the remake of Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes, which, critics suggest, reflect anger and anguish over the Iraq war. “These are basically Bush-Cheney movies,” Landis says. “I bet Cheney watches them and jerks off.”\n\nBut there was more going on in Craven’s imagination than anti-war sentiment. At a time when blockbusters from Bonnie and Clyde to Dirty Harry were romanticizing murder, Craven wanted to show, simply and crudely, that violence corrupts. Years later, his reservations about consequence-free killing led him to walk out of Reservoir Dogs during a film festival in Spain. “There was something about Quentin putting this music to this guy cutting an ear off. ‘Oh, he’s a cop, so it’s O.K.’ It just made me angry,” Craven says. “I left the theater, and this guy jumped in front of me and said, ‘I can’t believe I scared Wes Craven.’ That was Quentin Tarantino.”\n\nBut if Craven was making an anti-violence statement with Last House on the Left, not everyone bought it. In the final scene, the parents, having killed Krug, slump down in a pose of defeat. “In Wes’s mind, they had become what they hated most,” Cunningham says. “But I’m not so sure. I think most people were just getting off on the revenge.”\n\nLast House on the Left had such a toxic reputation that Hess was dropped by his agency and had to move to Europe to find work as an actor and musician. Rain may not have chewed on human flesh, but her parents were still appalled, and they stopped talking to her for a year. The only major critic to acknowledge that the depravity had a purpose was Roger Ebert, but his review was so controversial that he devoted a second column to defending himself. “The violence in Last House on the Left is not exhilarating,” he wrote. “It does not act as a catharsis. It is not escapist … it is just there, brutal and needless and tragic. I still believe Last House on the Left is a movie of worth, of a certain dogged commitment to its unsavory content.”\n\nCraven made the film at a turning point in his life. His marriage had collapsed, and he was virtually broke, having quit his job as a college teacher—the kind of respectable work his mother would approve of. It may be no coincidence that one of the most humiliating scenes in Last House on the Left featured a victim’s mother, played by Cynthia Carr, castrating one of the killers while giving him a blow job. It’s telling that Carr had it written into her contract that she would not actually have to perform fellatio on-screen.\n\nPerhaps it’s for the best that Craven’s mother never saw any of his horror movies. “For all her genuine love toward me, I never felt like she loved who I really was,” he says, getting a little glassy-eyed. “I think there was something about the way my mother looked at me. Behind her eyes was the sense that her son was crazy. Maybe Last House was just flying in the face of that. You want to see violent? You want to see sick? Here it is!”\n\nKrug may have formed the template for Freddy Krueger, but it was Leatherface, the hulking man-child from the seminal 1974 film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, who set the standard in fashion (mask), accessories (meat hook, chain saw), and personality (little to none) for a generation of cinematic serial killers. When Gunnar Hansen, a 300-pound giant of an actor, auditioned for the part, director Tobe Hooper briefly sketched the character: he was retarded, scared of his family, a nasty killer. Hooper then asked the actor a question: “Are you crazy?” Hooper seemed disappointed when Hansen said no. “But I discovered,” Hansen now says, “my sanity has its limits.”\n\nThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre drove everyone a little insane: the actors, the filmmakers, and especially the audience. The setup played on then topical anxieties about gas shortages and rising unemployment: a gang of bickering young friends run out of gas and find themselves stranded in a backwoods-Texas house, where they are terrorized by a family of degenerate unemployed slaughterhouse workers. The film’s ferocious shocks seem to arrive out of nowhere, and while the movie is a finely crafted piece of suspense, most audience members saw it differently.\n\n“It looked like someone stole a camera and started killing people,” says Craven, who saw it in a grimy Times Square theater. “It had a wild, feral energy that I had never seen before, with none of the cultural Band-Aids that soften things. It wasn’t nice, not nice at all. I was scared shitless.”\n\nIf it looked like a snuff film, that was partly because the actors were genuinely miserable. They worked 16-hour days in the boiling heat of central Texas in July and August and spent much of the time covered in fake blood (Karo corn syrup) and real bruises. “Let me put it to you gently,” says Edwin Neal, a Vietnam veteran who played Leatherface’s maniacal brother. “I moved troops through the jungles of Vietnam, and it wasn’t as bad as making this film.”\n\nOn the longest day of shooting, Hansen finally cracked. They were filming a scene where Leatherface tortures Sally, played by Marilyn Burns. Exhausted, overheated, and frustrated by a tube of fake blood that wouldn’t spurt, Hansen decided to cut Burns for real, just to get the scene over with. “That was hardly the worst of it,” remembers Burns, whose character was one of the first “Final Girls”—a term coined by Carol Clover, in Men, Women and Chain Saws, her influential feminist analysis of the genre. A Final Girl is the last survivor of a horror film, generally a young woman wearing very little clothing and wielding a phallic weapon. “I got a black eye that day,” Burns says, “and I remember getting beat up by everyone while Tobe was standing nearby saying, ‘Hit her harder! Harder!’”\n\nHooper, who has the faded-denim jacket and wire-rimmed glasses of an aging hippie, describes himself as a pacifist. “I wouldn’t kill a fly, any insect. If it was a black-widow spider, I would save it and let it go,” he says. But after he saw Night of the Living Dead, Hooper—whose first feature, a Vietnam movie called Eggshells, had flopped—decided to try his hand at horror. Romero refused to see Hooper’s film, because the title put him off: “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre? It was like those signs in the strip joints in L.A.: naked ladies!”\n\nBut that was exactly the point. “I needed to build a fire big enough that it would get noticed all the way out [in Hollywood],” Hooper says. He even tried to get a stamp of approval from the Motion Picture Association of America, which had instituted its new ratings system in 1968. “Believe it or not, I just called them up and asked, ‘How could I get a PG rating when a girl gets impaled on a hook?’ At first, the answer was: ‘You can’t,’” Hooper recalls. So he asked, “What if you show no contact? What if you cut the blood out? What then?” In the end, Hooper shot the scene, a masterpiece of horrific suggestion, showing no blood or contact between the hook and the skin. (He still got an R.) While The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is reputed to be monstrously gory, there is actually very little violence on-screen.\n\nThe film was an immediate sensation. Bryanston took out full-page ads in the trades announcing that it had earned more than $600,000 in its first four days; it would go on to make $20 million in its first two years. Meanwhile, the cast members, who had been promised points in the profits, weren’t receiving anything. “We had been told that every 90 days there would be a check. But it never came,” Hansen says. “After nine months, I got a check for $47.17.” It was a familiar story in low-budget horror. Romero and his collaborators saw hardly a dime from the proceeds of Night of the Living Dead, and no one from the cast of Last House on the Left made more than $1,000.\n\nWhile none of the actors from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre parlayed their roles into riches or stardom, some, including Hansen and Neal, are regulars at horror conventions, earning as much as $5,000 per appearance. In 2000, Hansen and David Hess of Last House on the Left went on tour together to introduce a series of screenings. What do the actors who played the most psychotic killers in cinema history talk about in their free time? “We once had a conversation about feminist film theory,” Hansen says, quite seriously. Hess remembers less elevated exchanges. “We talked women. You would not believe the groupies for these things,” he says. “They want whips and chains, and they say, ‘Come on, do me like Krug!’”\n\nIn 1975, Hooper was invited to the Universal lot by William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist, the prestige horror film whose mixture of religious meditation and head-spinning gore earned it 10 Academy Award nominations. “He told me, ‘Hey, kid, the film’s really good. You have a sensibility. That will come in handy,’” Hooper remembers. “ ’But let’s get down to the important stuff—the bullshit.’ By that he meant a career in Hollywood.”\n\nBy the mid-70s, Hollywood was starting to get its hands bloody. In 1975, Jaws, which opens with a highly eroticized kill, invented the summer blockbuster. The next year, Gregory Peck struggled with the evil child Damien in The Omen and Sissy Spacek took revenge on her tormentors in Carrie, the first of many Stephen King novels to be brought to the screen. Disreputable films were slowly going mainstream. When The New Yorker’s Pauline Kael wrote that Brian De Palma’s thrillers were “pure candied exploitation,” she meant it as high praise. But it wasn’t until a murderer named Michael Myers came on the scene, in 1978’s Halloween, that studios truly embraced the grind house.\n\nEmerging out of an idyllic suburb, Myers was evidence that evil wasn’t the result of urban blight or the Vietnam War. It was random and calculating, and could strike at any time. This frightening idea had been reinforced by the F.B.I.’s designation, in the mid-70s, of a new kind of real-life villain: the serial killer. Such people had presumably been around forever, but the press, with its obsessive coverage of David Berkowitz (the Son of Sam) and Ted Bundy, turned them into celebrities. (Bundy even had groupies.) Picking up on this current fascination, horror directors created a new breed of mysterious, coolly homicidal antiheroes.\n\nIt has become something of a cliché to say that John Carpenter invented the slasher film with Halloween. It would be more accurate to say that he perfected it. Carpenter pared the stalker formula down to its essentials: a big, scary man with a knife chasing a pretty girl. Even Romero’s zombies had a backstory—something to do with a botched mission to Venus—but Carpenter’s killer was a complete mystery. No personality, no motivation, pure evil. Myers looms at the corners of the screen, saying nothing and always watching. “We tried to strip out the plot devices of horror films that had come before,” Carpenter says, “because they didn’t matter.”\n\nPlaying the pretty girl was a new star with the kind of background that could really help market a film. Jamie Lee Curtis—the daughter of Janet Leigh, the blonde in the shower in *Psycho—*brought a painful vulnerability to her portrayal of the virginal babysitter Laurie Strode. Curtis had been invited to audition for the role of Regan in The Exorcist, but her mother wouldn’t let her. This time, she didn’t ask permission. “I didn’t talk to her about the movie. I wanted some independence,” says Curtis, who had no idea which part she was up for.\n\n“Are you going to cast me as the cheerleader, the smart aleck, or the quiet, repressed, brainiac virgin? The fact that they wanted me for the virgin really made me feel like an actor. I’m a natural cheerleader and a natural asshole smart aleck,” says Curtis, who became the most famous Final Girl of all time as well as the source of much controversy. Halloween (and its many imitators) has been criticized for indulging the audience’s sadistic impulses by punishing the girls who have sex. Carpenter, a rocky Kentucky native with a dramatic white mane, sighs at this familiar point, then declares, “Girls having sex aren’t paying attention. That’s it.”\n\nCarpenter had attended the illustrious film program at U.S.C., where George Lucas, Robert Zemeckis, and other icons of the Movie Brat generation cut their teeth. Horror was rarely talked about. It was, Carpenter says, “viewed as something that nice girls don’t do.” Instead, Carpenter found himself spending a lot of time talking about character development—which he wasn’t convinced was necessary. “It always bugged me that you always had to go into so much detail about evil or killers in the movies,” he says, sitting in his home office, which is patrolled by a tiny white dog named Bogey. “I remember seeing The Towering Inferno. It’s a fire—period, the end.”\n\nHalloween, Carpenter adds, was a “purely business decision.” He received a call from Irwin Yablans, a movie distributor with whom he had worked on the 1976 gang thriller Assault on Precinct 13. Yablans had quit his marketing job at Paramount a few years earlier, after his brother Frank climbed the company’s career ladder—all the way to president, releasing such classics as Chinatown and The Godfather. Irwin wanted to be a player, too, and on a transatlantic flight he dreamed up a golden idea. As soon as he got off the plane, he called Carpenter and told him what he had in mind: a horror movie, about a babysitter in peril, that takes place on Halloween. Carpenter cut him off. “Don’t tell me any more,” he said. “I know exactly what to do.”\n\nHooper says that an early version of Myers appeared in a screenplay that Carpenter sent him after the success of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. In that script, a group of city girls stumble upon a family of redneck cannibals, including an unstoppable killer who seems almost, but not quite, supernatural. The film, which was to be directed by Hooper, fell apart over a dispute about money. When Hooper saw Halloween, he was crestfallen: “I thought, There he is.”\n\nIn the last few years, there have been whispers that Carpenter got the basic idea for Halloween not from Yablans but from the Canadian filmmaker Bob Clark, who died last year in a car crash. Clark’s 1974 sorority-house thriller, Black Christmas, introduced several elements that would become famous in later movies. There is a crank-caller that prefigured the one in 1979’s When a Stranger Calls (which Wes Craven later satirized in his 1996 hit, Scream) as well as extensive use of the killer’s-point-of-view shot that famously opens Halloween. The killer in Black Christmas is even more mysterious than Michael Myers. We know literally nothing about him.\n\nCarpenter and Clark had worked together for a time on a horror film called Prey, which eventually fell through. According to several old interviews with Clark, including one on the DVD of Black Christmas, Carpenter asked Clark what he would do if he ever made a sequel to his holiday-themed hit. Clark said the serial killer would be caught, sent to a mental hospital, escape the next fall, and start killing girls. The title: Halloween. (Clark never made a sequel to Black Christmas, but he did go on to direct Porky’s and, oddly enough, the holiday perennial A Christmas Story.)\n\nCarpenter denies getting the idea from Clark, and even denies admiring the man’s work. “I remember coming out of Black Christmas thinking, I don’t know about that,” he says.\n\nYablans premiered Halloween in Kansas City to get a feel for its appeal. When it shattered local box-office records, he took it to larger markets, where it sold out theaters thanks to electric word of mouth. “We had a meeting with subdistributors,” Yablans says, “and they congratulated me and were really happy.” And why not? They had struck gold with Halloween, which would go on to become one of the most successful independent films of all time. “But I told them, ‘Fellas, it’s over. When the studios see how much money you can make with this kind of film, they are going to want to get in on the action.’”"
