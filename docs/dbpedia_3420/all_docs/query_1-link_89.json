        "text": "John Travolta (born February 18, 1954, Englewood, New Jersey, U.S.) is an American actor and singer who was a cultural icon of the 1970s, especially known for roles in the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter (1975–79) and the blockbuster film Saturday Night Fever (1977). He faded from the limelight during the next decade but reemerged as one of Hollywood’s premiere leading men after starring in the 1994 cult classic Pulp Fiction.\n\nTravolta, who was the youngest of six children, developed a childhood interest in performing that was nurtured by his mother, an actress and drama teacher. With his parents’ approval, he dropped out of high school at age 16 to pursue an acting career. He landed jobs in commercials and small television roles before making his Off-Broadway debut in Rain in 1972. After the show’s brief run, he toured in a minor role in Grease before making his Broadway debut in Over Here!\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nTravolta became a teen idol following the debut of the TV series Welcome Back, Kotter in 1975. In that high-school sitcom he played Vinnie Barbarino, the head of the “sweathogs” (a group of high-school students in a remedial class); the show ran until 1979. Travolta cemented his status with the 1976 chart hit “Let Her In” and several pop albums. He starred in the television movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble (1976), which also featured Diana Hyland. The two began a relationship, but Hyland died of cancer in 1977. Travolta relied heavily on Scientology to deal with his fame and with the grief he felt at Hyland’s death.\n\nAlthough he had bit parts in The Devil’s Rain (1975) and Carrie (1976), Travolta did not become a film star until the release of Saturday Night Fever (1977), the story of a Brooklyn youth who escapes his working-class frustrations by becoming king of the local dance floor on Saturday nights. The movie heightened the country’s growing interest in disco, and the image of Travolta in a white polyester suit and button-down shirt dancing to the beat of the Bee Gees soundtrack came to symbolize the era. Travolta, who spent months mastering intricate disco movements, earned an Academy Award nomination.\n\nMore movie success followed with Grease (1978), a nostalgic musical set in the 1950s. Its soundtrack, featuring Travolta and costar Olivia Newton-John singing such hits as “You’re the One That I Want” and “Summer Nights,” grossed millions. Travolta helped launch a country music craze with his appearance in Urban Cowboy (1980) but soon experienced a decline in popular and critical appeal. Staying Alive, the 1983 sequel to Saturday Night Fever, did not fare well, nor did such films as Two of a Kind (1983) and Perfect (1985). In 1991 he married actress Kelly Preston, his costar in The Experts (1989); she died from breast cancer in 2020."
