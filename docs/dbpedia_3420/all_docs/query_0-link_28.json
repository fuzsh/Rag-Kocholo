        "text": "Turner Classic Movies has an eight-minute interstitial called “Two for One: The Tradition of the Double Feature,” and features Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg recalling the great double features they saw in theaters as kids in the 1940s (Scorsese) and 1950s (both of them), with Bruce Goldstein, programmer for New York’s Film Forum, providing historical context. It’s a great piece, superbly edited, with beautiful film clips. I was especially wowed by the color clips from the previously unfamiliar THE LADY WANTS MINK (1953), seen by Scorsese on a double bill with SHANE, and INVADERS FROM MARS, seen by Spielberg on a double bill with THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Bruce Goldstein recalls how Federico Fellini’s LA STRADA, dubbed in English, was shown in the U.S. on a mind-boggling double bill in 1957 with the cavalry western, TROOPER HOOK, starring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nMy own double-feature movie attendance began in a later era than theirs, but I experienced many unusual co-feature juxtapositions as well, which I’ll recount here.\n\nHere’s a link to the TCM short:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lvg_d1ixLU8\n\nDouble features could be two related films, e.g. HERCULES and its sequel HERCULES UNCHAINED, or two James Bond films:\n\nOr they could be two unrelated films released as a package by the same studio that might appeal to the same audience, like these, a program I attended and enjoyed. (Dinosaurs and gunslingers–what’s not to love?)\n\nOr two films from the same studio that were completely unrelated:\n\nQuite frequently, however, neighborhood theater managers used their own discretion to choose a second feature, depending on what they thought their audience would most like, rejecting a distributor’s choice for something else, sometimes wisely and sometimes not, depending on what was available. Often, the two features would be wildly unrelated. It made for some adventurous viewing back then.\n\nI actually saw this pair, drawn in by the main feature, and found the previously unfamiliar British sci-fi co-feature, from 1967, a most pleasant surprise:\n\nHow about these two?\n\nOr this one?\n\nLuckily, when I saw THE FOOD OF THE GODS (1976), it was on a double bill with a similarly-themed film by the same director, Bert I. Gordon, EMPIRE OF THE ANTS (1977).\n\nI’m going to offer a sampling of some of the many memorable double (and triple) bills I saw in Bronx neighborhood theaters (and one in Times Square) in my youth, starting with the 1960s. I’ll save the 1970s for Part 2.\n\nTHE ROBE (1953) and its sequel, DEMETRIUS AND THE GLADIATORS (1954) were re-released as a double bill several years later. When this reissue arrived at my local theater, I went with my father and older brother. I was about five years old and it was a LOOOOONNNNG double bill! Luckily, DEMETRIUS came on first and had lots of gladiator action.\n\nHere’s an odd double bill. Despite being a big fan of the Hercules-type Italian muscleman films, I came away from this with much more vivid memories of the co-feature, a tidy little black-and-white thriller about an airplane in flight imperiled by the release of chemical fumes from a suitcase carrying an illegal substance, forcing an FBI man (George Raft) to uncuff his prisoner (Guy Madison, TV’s Wild Bill Hickok), the only man on board who can take over the flying after the pilot is overcome and loses consciousness.\n\nHANNIBAL and SERGEANT RUTLEDGE: epic battles with ancient Rome and cavalry vs. Indians–what could be more exciting to a seven-year-old? In retrospect, when studying the careers of these films’ directors in film school more than a decade later, I was struck by the fact that the A-feature here was directed by Edgar G. Ulmer, whose reputation is built on his Poverty Row black-and-white B-movies (DETOUR), and the second feature is by John Ford (THE GRAPES OF WRATH), a four-time Academy Award winner for Best Director. Quite a reversal, huh?\n\nHere’s a shot I found on-line of a marquee in Brooklyn that ran the same program:\n\nIn 1960, the Russian fantasy epic, ILYA MUROMETS, made in 1956 by Alexander Ptushko, was released in English as SWORD AND THE DRAGON and delivered all sorts of wondrous spectacles for an eager kiddie audience.\n\nThe co-feature, a black-and-white sci-fi thriller, capitalized on the renewed popularity of both Boris Karloff and the original FRANKENSTEIN, thanks to Universal’s Shock Theater package of 1930s horror and monster films released to TV in 1957, by combining them in a new, low-budget movie first released in 1958. As a fan of FRANKENSTEIN, I was thrilled to see a new movie with Karloff and the Frankenstein name, although even as a seven-year-old, I recognized it as a cheap rip-off, even if that term wasn’t yet part of the lexicon.\n\nThe Crotona, the nearest movie theater to my home at the time, closed in the spring of 1960 and the last double feature I saw there was this one:\n\nIn 1962, another nearby theater, the Tremont on Webster Avenue, formerly devoted to showing Italian films in their original language, switched to a policy of sub-run American releases in triple features with a low price of 35 cents for kids. Their grand reopening program was advertised throughout the neighborhood and you could get coupons at local candy stores that got you in for 25 cents. Here was the initial program:\n\nNine hours in the theater with a packed house of kids and only one crowd-pleaser in the bunch: QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE (1958). All that pent-up energy led to a riot in the lobby afterwards. I got trampled. Truth to tell, the 141-minute western, ONE-EYED JACKS (1961), really wasn’t aimed at kids and the Jules Verne movie, made in 1958 by Czech filmmaker Karel Zeman, was a little too arty and cerebral for this crowd. Zsa Zsa’s antics, however, were just right for us.\n\nDuring the time the theater was showing Italian movies, I recall seeing a poster for Luchino Visconti’s ROCCO AND HIS BROTHERS.\n\nI saw many great triple features at that theater in the summer of 1962, including the following movies:\n\nHere’s a memorable triple bill there that was significant for being the first time I attended a movie without a parent or older sibling. I was accompanied by a younger sister. I was nine. She was seven. Now tell me which of these was a “children’s movie.”\n\nThe third one, a circus melodrama, was so boring we walked out after about 15 minutes. We’d had our fill. I’ve still never seen it in its entirety.\n\nOn March 10, 1963, I made my historic first trip to the movies completely by myself, an event I chronicled in an earlier blog post. Here’s that double bill, both Italian films, the second one in black-and-white and a much more serious war film than the kind I was used to. I’d see more black-and white Italian films in film classes and repertory theaters a decade later.\n\nIn September 1963, my siblings and I made our first trip to the Bronx’s premier movie showplace, the Loew’s Paradise, to see a highly anticipated version of Greek mythology with special effects by Ray Harryhausen and music by Bernard Herrmann. We went for the noon show and even had to wait on line.\n\nThe co-feature, which played first, may have been less spectacular but it was still exciting to see a film set in the time of King Arthur a thousand years ago. I would later learn that SIEGE OF THE SAXONS was directed by Nathan Juran, the same man who’d directed an earlier Ray Harryhausen special effects fantasy I’d seen and loved in a theater, THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD (1958).\n\nImagine seeing these films in a glorious setting with a ceiling adorned with glittering stars in a night sky and classic-looking statuary on the walls.\n\nNext up: a science fiction thriller directed by Roger Corman and a horror film directed by his then-protege, Francis Ford Coppola. Who knew I was witnessing a significant chapter of film history before my eyes?\n\nAbout two months earlier, I’d seen a double bill of BEACH PARTY and another Roger Corman film, THE YOUNG RACERS. It was during a hiatus in the European shoot of the latter film that Corman sent Coppola, with a budget of $40,000 and some of the YOUNG RACERS cast members, to Ireland to make DEMENTIA 13.\n\nThe big draw for me in this next bill was the Sinbad film, although I came away much more impressed with the main feature, a black-and-white drama for which Sidney Poitier would win the Academy Award for Best Actor just weeks later, a historic win for a black actor.\n\nAs I watched MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD at the time, something struck me as out-of-kilter. It was clearly dubbed in English, so it wasn’t a Hollywood film, but it didn’t look Italian either and it didn’t appear to be set in the Middle East like a Sinbad film. Years later, when I went to see a Russian fantasy film from 1952 called SADKO, directed by Alexander Ptushko, at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, there appeared a scene that I knew I’d seen before, in which the hero holds up a phony-looking fish emitting “rays of gold” and only then did I realize that this was indeed the film I saw as THE MAGIC VOYAGE OF SINBAD, dubbed in English and shortened somewhat by its American distributor–under the supervision of Roger Corman and Francis Coppola of all people!\n\nPtushko had also directed ILYA MUROMETS, aka SWORD AND THE DRAGON, which I’d seen three years before MAGIC VOYAGE, but I didn’t make the connection until much later.\n\nAnother Sinbad film turned up a month or two later, joined by a freewheeling ’60s comedy starring James Garner as a hustling oil broker. This Sinbad movie, given a slightly altered spelling, “Sindbad,” to avoid copyright issues with Columbia Pictures over its Sinbad property, was produced by Hollywood but made in Germany and starred TV’s Zorro, Guy Williams, in the title role. It was a helluva lot more thrilling than the Russian film.\n\nAnd here is a color still for SINDBAD from National Screen Service, of the type that would have been seen in the theater’s outside display cases:\n\nNow here’s a memorable reissue double bill in 1964 of two black-and-white horror classics from four years earlier (1960), with special glasses or “ghost viewers” given out so audience members could “see” the ghosts in the first film. The second film is a superior British science fiction film based on John Wyndham’s novel, “The Midwich Cuckoos.”\n\nA John Sturges biowarfare spy thriller and an Italian “Maciste” movie. (Maciste was always renamed Hercules, Samson or Goliath for the American market.)\n\nTwo years later, we got two great genre filmmakers on one double bill: Roger Corman and Mario Bava:\n\nAnd stills from each:\n\nAnd it wasn’t even the first Mario Bava film I’d seen in a theater. Three years earlier I’d seen HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD on a double bill with MUSCLE BEACH PARTY.\n\nTwo years later, accompanying a William Friedkin-directed period comedy about a burlesque theater in Manhattan was the very first Italian western I ever saw:\n\nCuban actor Tomas Milian would go on to star in many other Italian westerns over the years, including Sergio Corbucci’s COMPAÑEROS (1970).\n\nTwo great Hollywood filmmakers who had seen better days, Jules Dassin and Otto Preminger, in the last double bill I would see at the Fairmount Theater before it closed in the spring of 1969:\n\nMy first Clint Eastwood movie on the big screen accompanied by what was both my first Jim Brown movie and first Burt Reynolds movie all in one show:\n\nIt wasn’t, however, my first Raquel Welch movie. I’d seen two others in theaters by this point.\n\nThe following bill was the very first time (of many) I would see this Peckinpah masterpiece on the big screen. It was accompanied by a crime thriller based on an Elmore Leonard novel and starring two of the young stars of TV’s “Peyton Place,” who were married to each other at the time:\n\nI’ve since read the Leonard novel and seen the awful 2004 remake, but I still haven’t revisited the 1969 movie, even though I’d very much like to.\n\nHere’s a James Garner comedy western paired with an all-star British epic taking a then-newly fashionable critical look at the blunder of the historic charge of 600 in the Crimean War.\n\nAnd last but not least, a Clint Eastwood double bill consisting of the final film he made for Sergio Leone and his first American starring role after the success of his Leone trilogy.\n\nAt this point, I still hadn’t seen A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, the first two films in Leone’s “Man with No Name” trilogy starring Eastwood. I would see that double bill a few months later, in 1970. As for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Leone’s fourth western, I’d seen it earlier in 1969 as a single feature, so I saw all of Leone’s first four westerns within a year of each other but all in the exact reverse order.\n\nPart 2: The 1970s will boast some even wilder double bills."
