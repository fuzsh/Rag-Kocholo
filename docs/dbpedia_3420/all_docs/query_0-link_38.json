        "text": "West Side Story (1961)\n\nAmerica | Rita Moreno & George Chakiris\n\nFlamboyant, fast and fun, this dance scene is well celebrated, and blends the story-telling from the song into the movements of the dance flawlessly. Choreographed by Jerome Robbins.\n\nThe Dance in The Gym | Chorus Line\n\nAn exhilaratingly colourful dance scene, full of people having an absolute ball! Choreographed by Jerome Robbins.\n\nBye Bye Birdie (1963)- Ann-Margret & Bobby Rydell\n\nA light- hearted dance, often made up of small movements that are performed so precisely and with such character. Choreographed by Gower Champion.\n\nViva Las Vegas (1964)- Ann-Margret & Elvis Presley\n\nLoose, free and iconic! This dance certainly shares the unfettered spirit of the sixties. Choreographed by David Winters.\n\nMary Poppins (1964)- Step In Time | Dick Van Dyke & Julie Andrews\n\nAn exciting and playful dance scene set on the rooftops of London, with chimney sweeps tapping, leaping and flipping all over the place. Choreographed by Marc Breaux.\n\nBande à Part (1964)- The Madison Dance | Anna Karina, Sami Frey & Claude Brasseur\n\nThe famous improvised -style dance scene that became a pop culture hit and went on to influence future dance scenes in films such as Simple Men (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994).\n\nSound of Music (1965)\n\n16 Going On 17 | Charmian Carr & Daniel Truhitte\n\nThe sweet duet between two young lovebirds who after getting caught in the rain, dance around the gazebo. Choreographed by Marc Breaux.\n\nLaendler | Julie Andrews & Christopher Plummer\n\nAn elegant and quite formal dance between the two characters as they start to realise that they love each other. Choreographed by Marc Breaux.\n\nTo Sir, With Love (1967)- Sidney Poitier & Judy Geeson\n\nAn endearing and innocent dance between a beloved teacher and his student.\n\nThe Young Girls of Rochefort (1967)- Chorus Line\n\nSome 1960’s fever dream, injected with a palette of bright springtime colours, creating a world where you couldn’t imagine anything bad happening to you. Choreographed by Norman Maen.\n\nChitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968)- Music Box | Sally Ann Howes & Dick Van Dyke\n\nFamously shot in one take, Sally’s prefect imitation of a mechanical doll is magnificent, contrasted by Dick’s ebullient clown. Choreographed by Marc Breaux."
