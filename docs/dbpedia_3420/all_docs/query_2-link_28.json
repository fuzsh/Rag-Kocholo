        "text": "July 26 & 27: Come One, Come All –\n\nLet’s Get a Move On!\n\nIn Partnership with Mobtown Ballroom\n\nWe do hereby swear: you will not – you can not – get this at home.\n\nMobtown’s got the floor open, and you’re expected.\n\nThe Parkway’s got the lineup ready, and you’re welcome.\n\nAnd Mobtown x Parkway have partnered to bring you a mad hot weekend of ballroom on screen and live and in person!\n\nSo come on out and…\n\nBinge on five great films…\n\nFind a partner, make a friend, cut a rug…\n\nGo big, dress to kill (there’s prizes, oh there’s roses in store)…\n\nLearn a move, with the pros or the kids…\n\nOr, just hang in the dark AC, under the big bright beam and watch it all unfold!\n\nTickets and max-value experience packages are on sale now!\n\nFriday, July 26, 2024\n\n3:30 PM: All That Jazz (1979) [R] (125 min)\n\nRotten Tomatoes Rating: 87%/85%\n\nFosse!!! Did Kubrick really confess: “this is the best movie I’ve ever seen”? The flawed, mesmerizing Roy Schieder (as ersatz Fosse), is the director-choreographer on a tragic tear, tumbling toward opening night. The “dazzling, frenetic, and ultimately poignant examination of the life of a brilliant yet tortured artist” (New York Times) is just half the action here; Fosse’s meticulous, angular precision and provocative sensuality are on full display in the film that set a new standard for the genre.\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\n6:00 PM: Strictly Ballroom (1992) [PG] (96 min)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 88%/87%\n\nThe classic ballroom experience on film, Baz Luhrman’s “exuberant and sheerly romantic comedy…in its mixture of camp and reality…is irresistible”. (San Francisco Chronicle). The wonderfully zany, high-energy world of competitive ballroom dancing is turned on its head when rebel Scott Hastings dares to break from the stifling rigidity of traditional steps, landing him in hot water with the powers that be. That is ’til he finds Fran, the clumsy newbie who, as it turns out, is also a maverick. Scott and Fran’s sizzling chemistry ignites both on and off the dance floor, amidst sequins, spray tans, and a cast of delightfully over-the-top characters – culminating in a spectacular showdown of glitz, glam, heart and soul.\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\n8:00 PM Lindy Hop Class and Open Social Dance at Mobtown Ballroom (60 min)\n\nThe stage is set, the lights are on and the drinks are ready just over North Ave. at Mobtown Ballroom, where newcomers and pros alike come together on the floor for the always hot Friday night Swing and Lindy Hop scene. Mobtown has got a big special in store for the Parkway fam: a drop-in beginner lesson (no partner or experience required), followed by an open social dance. Go on, and get out there!\n\n8:00 PM Alive and Kicking (2016) [NR] (135 min)\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 100% / 94%\n\nOr, stick with Parkway, grab a drink, and settle in for the uplifting doc that traces swing from Harlem’s Savoy to Mobtown’s Lindy Hop – and lays out how, why and where swing builds community and even personal healing and transformation. “With its acrobatic zest, swing dancing was a perfect expression of defiant resilience during the Great Depression. For contemporary enthusiasts, it’s an antidote to the emotional disconnect of the so-called connected age. Swing buff Susan Glatzer…makes these points in her first documentary… [and] lets the dancers’ ecstatic moves do most of the talking…” (Los Angeles Times).\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\nSaturday, July 27, 2024\n\n2:00 PM (105 minutes): Mad Hot Ballroom (2005) [PG] Rotten Tomatoes: 84%/83%\n\nOk kids! Ok parents and grown-ups and young at heart! You’re up – this afternoon’s just for you – a film and a dance lesson and free popcorn for all. This heartwarming doc follows NYC public school students on their journey through rumba, tango, swing, merengue and fox trot – from “ick, no!” to the unfolding of self-confidence, discipline, and teamwork on the floor of the Grand Finals and the World Financial Center. This uplifting chronicle of growth and dedication “doesn’t condescend to its interviewees (students or teachers) or treat them as adorable objects…Instead, the film offers its subjects as individuals with goals and ideas, confusions and aspirations…And dancing is but one means…to help them figure out their lives.” (Pop Matters).\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\n4:00 – 5:00 PM: Family Lindy Hop and Partnering Class in the Parkway Lobby\n\nAs you spill out into the theatre after Mad Hot Ballroom, you’re gonna want to move! Why not stay for a fun, expressive, all-ages dance class led by Mobtown’s expert instructors? Bring the whole family!\n\n7:00 PM (90 minutes): Screening: Nosferatu (1922) [NR]\n\nAs the sun sets and shadows grow, we take a cue from our friends at Mobtown and dare you to enter the sinister realm of “Nosferatu”, the film that redefined horror cinema! “A visual and emotional treat.” In this tale of relentless suspense and haunting beauty, “Max Schreck is unforgettable as the rat-faced, needle-fingered human stick insect who emerges from his battered castle to spread plague through the land.” (Empire) F.W. Murnau’s shadowy, atmospheric direction and pioneering special effects set a new standard for the genre. Rediscover the chilling classic that turned fear into art and experience the timeless struggle between good and evil.\n\nWatch the trailer.\n\n8:30 PM (60min): Costume Contest at Parkway\n\nDid you come dressed to kill? Perfect! Catwalkers and onlookers alike are welcome in a best costume contest, with prizes sponsored by Parkway, Mobtown, and Lyric Theatre (did someone say tickets to The Sisters of Mercy?).\n\n9:30 PM – Onwards: Goth Prom at Mobtown Ballroom\n\nLet the eerie vibes of Nosferatu carry you as you slip into the night to join a party like no other, hosted by our friends at Mobtown Ballroom. Revel in an evening of DJ sets, tantalizing drinks, and live music by the industrial goth band Vosh. Break out that formal black you’ve been waiting to wear and join the creatures of the night for a fang-tastic night of film, dance, and music!\n\nTickets are available now online: BUY NOW.\n\nFor a deep dive, we have 3 film plus experience packages starting at just $30.\n\nSee you on the dance floor!\n\nAnnouncing a Renewed Vision\n\nOn May 28, 2024, we hosted an event attended by hundreds of community members, where we unveiled a new vision for the SNF Parkway Theatre.\n\nBoard Chair Scot Spencer and Vice Chair Camille Blake Fall shared exciting changes planned for our theatre. These enhancements aim to make the venue more accessible and vibrant for everyone—artists, audiences, and community partners alike.\n\nRead more about it in:\n\nThe Baltimore Banner\n\nThe Baltimore Sun\n\nWatch the Presentation"
