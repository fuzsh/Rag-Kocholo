        "text": "HAS ANY FILMMAKER had a career full of as many twists as M. Night Shyamalan? After the quiet releases of two little-remembered independent films (Praying with Anger and Wide Awake), the 1999 release of The Sixth Sense brought him the kind of instant success rarely seen in Hollywood. The film was a pop culture sensation that earned Shyamalan two Oscar nominations for directing and screenwriting. The cover of Newsweek He seemed poised to reshape the industry with his prestigious, genre-inflected dramas.\n\nHis next films, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village, came out to increasingly tepid responses, however. Shyamalan’s interests in spirituality and sentimentality were eclipsing the grounded dramatic elements that had won him acclaim. By the time Lady in the Water debuted in 2006, it seemed like the public was primed to tear down a wunderkind for the crime of pretentiousness (and much of the backlash was inflected by gross racism towards his Indian heritage). And then came the flood: The Happening, The Last Airbender, After Earth, high-profile flop after flop. Shyamalan’s reputation had completely reversed from his early days. Now he was a laughing stock, sometimes literally. His name popping up in a trailer could induce uncontrollable giggles in an audience conditioned to associate him with failure.\n\nEven more remarkable than his fall, though, is the way he seems to be rising again. It started with The Visit, a self-financed, small-budget horror film that wasn’t, to the surprise of audiences and critics, a terrible movie. Then came the smash-hit thriller Split, which reminded audiences of his roots at least partially by way of its narrative connection to Unbreakable. Subsequent films like Glass, Old, and Knock at the Cabin have been more divisive, but “divisive” is a major step up from the way his films were discussed a decade prior. His newest film, Trap, now playing, has already lit up social media with enthusiasm (ironic or otherwise) for its thrillingly loony premise. Shyamalan is, at least to some extent, undeniably back.\n\nShyamalan will probably never be an Oscar nominee again. Regardless, he’s built a dedicated following of cinephiles who appreciate his mastery of film form. Shyamalan’s images range from head-spinning chaos to perfectly controlled, the man’s skill at crafting compositions always on display. If you can get past the superficially awkward style of his dialogue, his stories can be heartbreakingly tender and sentimental. He has a knack for couching the most absurd premises in deeply relatable human drama. In short, controversial though this statement may seem, M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent filmmaker. With that in mind, let’s rank his 15 feature films, excluding Trap which audiences will get a chance to see this weekend, Devil (the haunted elevator movie) which he only produced, and Stuart Little, on which he only has a screenwriter credit (yes, really)."
