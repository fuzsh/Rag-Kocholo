        "text": "Reviews of silent film releases on home video.\n\nCopyright Â© 1999-2024 by Carl Bennett\n\nand the Silent Era Company.\n\nAll Rights Reserved.\n\nLady of the\n\nNight\n\n(1925)\n\nNorma Shearer tackles a dual role in this Monta Bell romance that also features Malcolm McGregor and George K. Arthur.\n\nThe title implies a direction the story might go but the filmmakers have soft pedaled any smarmy aspects in favor of a portrait of a character who momentarily seeks to rise above her rough childhood circumstances.\n\nShearer plays a coarse orphan in her early twenties in New York (presumably) and a privileged daughter of a successful banker who both happen to fall in love with a handsome young inventor (McGregor). As might be expected, there is no end of martyrdom for love from either character but Shearer nonetheless manages to bring compassion to both. McGregor is his usual unengaging self and this role gives further evidence why his career didnât amount to much. The second star of the film is George K. Arthur who is impossible not to like. Character actress Dale Fuller has a thankless minor role as a spinster aunt.\n\nOne of these days we are going to record the amount of Shearerâs screen time in this obvious starring vehicle as it feels that she occupies the entire film. While it is no cinematic blockbuster, this film is a worthwhile diversion on a rainy day.\n\nâ Carl Bennett\n\nThis DVD-R edition has been mastered from an archival 35mm print as originally produced for broadcast on the Turner Classic Movies cable television network. The color-toned black & white tonal ranges are well-balanced with no hightlight burn-outs and with defined shadow details. There is the expected amount of dust and speckling, with some light emulsion damage but nothing that pulls one out of the story.\n\nThe film is accompanied by an entertaining piano music score performed by Jon Mirsalis.\n\nThere is no supplementary material included on this manufactured-on-demand DVD-R disc.\n\nAs this appears to be the only available home video edition of this film, we recommend it.\n\nUSA: Click the logomark to purchase this Region 0 NTSC DVD-R edition from Amazon.com.
