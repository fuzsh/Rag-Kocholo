        "text": "In January 2010, Avatar was leading the box office. Kesha’s “Tik Tok” was dominating the airwaves. And Tiger Woods's multiple affairs, which had come to light two months before, was the scandal of the moment.\n\nA lot has changed in the decade following, much of it for the better. Frozen II, an animated movie about two sisters saving their kingdom, is one of the highest-grossing films of all time. Kesha has become one of the many faces of the #MeToo movement after she sued her former producer Dr. Luke for emotional and physical abuse. And the scandal of the moment? The Hallmark Channel is being called out for removing an ad that featured two women kissing. The network has already apologized and reinstated the spot.\n\nWe wanted to show just how much has changed by reflecting on 100 women who were at the center of pop culture this decade. Because looking back at the people who brought us the most entertainment and distraction—both good and bad—over the past 10 years helps us better understand where we’ve been as a society and where we still have room to grow.\n\nIt wasn’t an easy task. In part because you could make the argument that anybody who played a role in the things we watched, read, listened to, and scrolled for could be considered women of influence in their own way. But this list isn’t about females that had one great year or a single big moment. It’s about the ones whose impact will continue to be felt during the next decade, or those who were emblematic of the 2010s because they represented a specific time and place that can never be recaptured.\n\nA few caveats: We ended up with 104 women for reasons you’ll see, and this list is about looking back, not forward, so several women we love didn’t make the cut because we believe they’ll be defining culture in the next decade. (We see you, Lizzo, Billie Eilish, and Phoebe Waller-Bridge!) Other women—your Oprahs and Dolly Partons, for example—are so legendary that their influence goes well beyond just one decade, even though their contributions to this one have been vast. Not every woman who made the list had a positive impact, either. This isn’t about who we like best or would invite to our dream dinner party. It’s simply 104 women who made a lasting impression in movies, TV, books, and celebrity culture over the past 10 years.\n\nSee them all below, in no particular order. —Anna Moeslein\n\nKylie Jenner\n\nIn 2009, Kylie Jenner was the 12-year-old sister on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, then in its second season. Ten years and 15 seasons later, we’ve watched her morph before our eyes into a social media titan (153 million Instagram followers at press time), a mother, and one of the most prosperous beauty moguls of our time. Armed with an iPhone and her cosmetically enhanced lips, she capitalized on the fact that people wanted to look like her and turned it into a billion-dollar business, with Forbes estimating her net worth at $1 billion, making her the world's youngest self-made billionaire as of March 2019 (though the phrase “self-made” has been debated). Still, her carefully crafted aesthetic—full lips, high cheekbones, lifted brows—and her reclamation of the stigma around injectables can be pointed to as the catalyst for both the ubiquity of “Instagram face” and the rise of noninvasive cosmetic enhancements (up 44.5% in the past decade, based on data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons). If that’s not the power of influence, what is? —Lindsay Schallon\n\nAva DuVernay\n\nAs with many women on this list, Ava DuVernay wasn’t a household name when the decade began. Now the director is changing history every time she steps onto a set. DuVernay—the first woman of color to direct a live-action film with a budget of over $100 million—isn’t just breaking records: She’s here to fix Hollywood. As she puts it in her 2019 Glamour Women of the Year profile, “I am trying to disrupt systems—systems we in this country take as gospel. We’re born into them. We abide by their rules without interrogating what the rules are meant to do, who they’re meant to serve. And you can’t disrupt what you don’t understand.” DuVernay is creating meaningful change by highlighting injustices through storytelling—including the Emmy-winning Netflix series When They See Us, about the now exonerated Central Park Five—and hiring more female directors and crew members. Through this, her work ensures that underrepresented people feel seen. And she’s only just beginning. —Jessica Radloff\n\nSerena Williams\n\nWhere would we be without Serena Williams? She’s one of those rare athletes who change the game beyond their sport. Through her dominance on the tennis court and those rule-breaking catsuits, Williams has spent the past decade redefining what a strong woman—and a strong mother—looks like. Her biggest impact isn’t just that she’s killing it as a woman on top; it’s that she’s not afraid to show the gritty, sometimes painful, path to getting there. After winning the Australian Open in 2017 while pregnant, her postpartum comeback has been hard as hell, a truth she’s never been shy about. And after experiencing life-threatening complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis, she also helped draw attention to the maternal mortality crisis facing black women in America. One thing is for sure: When Williams steps onto the court, people pay attention—to her power serves, her barrier-breaking style choices, and her voice. —Macaela MacKenzie\n\nKristen Wiig\n\nThere’s something about the mad genius of Kristen Wiig that feels unearthly, like she’s a comedy alien in disguise who we must protect. She started the decade redefining our interpretation of funny on Saturday Night Live to the tune of four Golden Globe nominations in four years, and then reached icon status with Bridesmaids in 2011. The movie, and Wiig’s role in it, started an important conversation about women in comedy—that, duh, they exist and can win at the box office. After Wiig left SNL in 2012, she’s gone on to do a little bit of everything—and do it well—including indie comedies, dramatic roles, and a truly revolutionary Sia dance at the Grammys. Can you name another performer who can pull off playing both a NASA director of media relations in a big-budget drama (The Martian) as well as an animated vagina (Big Mouth)? We’ll be reunited with her in the next decade in the Wonder Woman sequel. Can’t wait. —Jenny Singer\n\nKathryn Bigelow\n\nKathryn Bigelow kicked off the decade with a massive historical achievement. In 2010 she became the first woman ever to win an Academy Award for best director, for her film The Hurt Locker, a thriller set during the Iraq war. (Barbra Streisand—on hand to present the Oscar—opened the envelope and exclaimed, “Well, the time has come!” before reading Bigelow’s name.) After that landmark win, Bigelow went on to direct big-budget action films Zero Dark Thirty in 2012 and Detroit in 2017. Her next two films have already been announced—both based on true stories—but the release dates are still TBD. So in the meantime, if it seems unbelievable that it took until 2010 for a woman to be recognized with an Oscar for her brilliance behind the camera, take a deep breath: No other female director has won the award since. Dear 2020s, please do better. —Mattie Kahn\n\nLupita Nyong’o\n\nAt the start of the decade, Lupita Nyong’o had quietly been working in the entertainment industry for years—including behind the camera as a runner on The Constant Gardener—and appeared in stage productions while enrolled in Yale School of Drama’s master’s program. It wasn’t until after graduation, when she was cast as Patsey in 12 Years a Slave, that she was catapulted to fame. The role earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, among other awards, and started her journey as a fashion It girl. She's starred in major projects since then—Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Black Panther, and Us—but it’s how she uses her fame for good that’s most impressive: She’s partnered with WildAid to help protect elephants, worked with Mother Health International to support women and children in Uganda, publicly made a commitment to work with directors who haven’t abused their power, and written a children’s book, Sulwe, that became a New York Times best-seller. —Kim Fusaro\n\nAnne Hathaway\n\nCertain stars are divisive thanks to personal taste. You love Taylor Swift; I find her annoying. Let’s move on. But then there are stars that become the target of repulsion for society at large. This decade's bugaboo? Anne Hathaway. Beloved during the first half of the 2000s for The Princess Diaries and The Devil Wears Prada, the actor faced a public mutiny starting in 2013, following her role as Fantine in Les Misérables, which seemed to have uncovered a real-life earnestness we decided to loathe. We complained she was too smug. We snickered at her theater-kid affectations. We said her face was too mature. We hated her (slightly deranged) Oscar hosting. We threw things at our TV when, upon winning Best Supporting Actress, she whispered, “It came true.” It wasn't until later we recognized our reactions were misguided and, frankly, misogynistic, but our collective Hathahate could be viewed as a prelude to the “cancel culture” and scary hive mind permeating social media as we move into a new decade. —Perrie Samotin\n\nJennifer Garner\n\nTabloid headlines about Jennifer Garner this decade have largely revolved around her relationship with ex-husband Ben Affleck (\"They’re Divorcing!\" \"They Fired the Nanny!\" \"She’s Giving Him Another Chance!\"). But it’s Garner’s work protecting her children—and others—from these same tabloids that is the real news. In summer 2013, Garner and Halle Berry testified before the California State Assembly Committee on Public Safety to encourage lawmakers to pass a bill aimed at protecting children of public figures from intrusive paparazzi. “We’re hoping our kids’ day-to-day experience will not be of really aggressive men yelling and screaming five feet from their faces,” Garner told Today at the time. The bill passed, and it’s completely changed how media covers celebrity children. Garner, meanwhile, hasn’t stopped her commitment to helping kids, serving as an ambassador for Save the Children (she’s also on the board of trustees) and a supporter of Baby2Baby, an organization that provides children living in poverty with basic necessities. —J.R.\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nHillary Clinton’s Twitter bio reads: “2016 Democratic Nominee, SecState, Senator, hair icon. Mom, Wife, Grandma x3, lawyer, advocate, fan of walks in the woods & standing up for our democracy.” She may be all those things, but we’re here to talk about her impact on pop culture over the decade—specifically her role in the 2016 election. With the Apprentice star Donald Trump as Clinton’s opponent, politics became a pop spectacle. The nation collectively watched as politicians became celebrities in their own right. Debates over policy played out on Twitter. And every Saturday night audiences tuned into SNL to watch Kate McKinnon’s gleeful portrayal of Clinton opposite Alec Baldwin’s ranting Trump. Somewhere along the way, Clinton became the poster child for colorful pantsuits. But maybe the best way to sum up the pop politics of 2016 is this: The day after the election, the biggest meme was a photo of Clinton enjoying a peaceful hike in the woods. —Talia Abbas\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nPlay Nicki Minaj’s 2011 smash “Super Bass” at any bar or club, and the same thing happens. Patrons will instantly recognize the song based on its twinkly opening beeps and start rapping along to Minaj’s first verse (off-key and incorrectly, perhaps, but nonetheless enthusiastically). That’s because this song—and, specifically, her lightning-fast verses—was social canon in the early 2010s. And the charts reflected this: “Super Bass” reached an impressive number three on Billboard’s Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting female rap song since Missy Elliott’s “Work It.” She didn’t stop there. With a string of genre-bending hits, Minaj single-handedly ushered female rap music into the decade, certainly paving the way for acts like Iggy Azalea and Cardi B. This year Minaj announced that she's retiring from music. She’s since slightly backtracked that comment, but if it is true, she’s leaving behind a legacy that didn’t just shift music but culture at large. —Christopher Rosa\n\nCardi B\n\nIf Nicki Minaj ushered female rap music into the decade, then Cardi B brought it to the finish line. The Bronx-raised artist became the superstar the world didn’t see coming with her 2017 hit “Bodak Yellow,” which stampeded the Billboard Hot 100. With it, Cardi became the second female rapper to snag a solo number one hit. (Lauryn Hill was the first.) And after earning another chart-topper with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, “I Like It,” she became the only female rapper to achieve multiple number ones on the Hot 100. Match this with the fact that she’s the first solo female artist to win a Grammy for Best Rap Album (Invasion of Privacy, 2018) and you have a history-making talent. But what do all these accolades mean? Well, several things—but most important, we hope it means the glass ceiling that’s kept black women off the top of the charts is finally shattering. —C.R.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nDid anything define the 2010s quite like Goop, the wellness newsletter with a silly name that morphed into a $250-million business started by Gwyneth Paltrow? In the span of a few years, Paltrow went from beloved Oscar winner to out-of-touch snake-oil salesman or aspirational spiritual goddess, depending on how you look at it. Whether she was telling us that walking barefoot could cure your insomnia, suggesting a $66 jade egg belongs in your vagina, getting dragged for creating gift guides so ridiculous that she actually started calling them ridiculous (fun fact: installing custom music for your plants apparently costs $25,000), remarking that she’d rather smoke crack than eat cheese from a can, or giving us the decade’s most famous euphemism, Paltrow is leaving the 2010s as a proxy for the very specific type of woman for whom self-care is more than a lifestyle—it’s a very expensive religion. —P.S.\n\nJennifer Lawrence\n\nIn 2010 the then unknown Jennifer Lawrence became an awards-season darling thanks to a breakthrough role in buzzy indie Winter’s Bone. The momentum from that got her two high-profile (and high-earning) franchises—The Hunger Games and X-Men—as well as the film that led to her first Academy Award: 2012’s Silver Linings Playbook. Along the way Lawrence gained massive popularity and created a new kind of celebrity: that of the charming, extremely unfiltered starlet. She trips at the Oscars! She watches the Kardashians! She loves wine! She eats cheesesteaks before red carpets! Every headline marveled that such a talent could also be—gasp—relatable. Then, in 2014, a violating hack leaked nude photos of Lawrence on the internet. In signature Lawrence style, she addressed it directly and moved on. By 2018 she was the highest-paid female actor in the world. So she did the unthinkable: take time off for herself. Which, of course, only made her even more relatable. —A.M.\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nWhen Lana Del Rey made her debut on SNL in 2012, the world didn’t know what to think. In a time of girl-power anthems like Taylor Swift’s “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,” here was a woman standing still, wistfully singing about a man who doesn’t love her back. Now people seem to finally understand Del Rey’s magic, despite early debates that revolved around her “authenticity.” Her most recent album, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, is topping nearly every critic’s year-in-review list. But Del Rey has always embodied the contradictions that defined the decade: She consistently sells out stadium tours but hasn’t had a radio hit since 2012. Her style is grandiose—she once described herself as “Gangster Nancy Sinatra”—yet her lyrics are deeply vulnerable, paving the way for artists like Billie Eilish and Lorde. And, as Queen of the Sad Girls, she gives women permission to wallow in emotions instead of fighting back. It’s a powerful feeling in a world that so often tells women to always be “on.” —Bella Cacciatore\n\nAshley Graham\n\nWhen Sports Illustrated put Ashley Graham on the cover of its Swimsuit Issue in 2016, she instantly became a household name—and lifted the lid on an important issue in fashion: size inclusivity. Within the year Graham had a Vogue cover and an advertising campaign for H&M, and was walking for Michael Kors. All significant because, as Lauren Chan wrote for Glamour, “Each time [Graham] has succeeded, she’s made the 67% of American women who are above a size 14...more visible.” And with nearly 10 million Instagram followers at press time, Graham is using her platform to help women of all sizes be confident. “As a model, I think it’s our duty to not just be a pretty face in the world, but to actually speak up and use our platform in a bigger way,” she told Glamour in 2018. “I know it’s not going to last forever...so what else is it out there that I want to achieve?” —T.A.\n\nMegyn Kelly\n\nIt’s been a jam-packed decade for Megyn Kelly, who went through several rebrands in the 10-year span, moving from Fox News to a shiny morning slot on NBC to her personal Instagram and offending people more or less the entire time. She was already a big star for Fox by the 2016 presidential election, and then she clashed with Donald Trump at a GOP debate. He later criticized her tough questions and said, “You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” People nationwide were horrified, but Kelly nabbed a prime-time special out of the controversy. Kelly eventually left Fox for her own NBC talk show, but her ratings never soared and she faced backlash for defending blackface. So she left the network in 2019, pledging to reappear on TV at some point soon. But if you really want to understand Kelly’s impact on the decade, we suggest watching Charlize Theron play her in Bombshell, in theaters now. —M.K.\n\nKerry Washington\n\n\"When I was growing up, there was more of a dichotomy: You had to choose whether you wanted to be smart or pretty; you couldn’t be both.” When Kerry Washington told Glamour this in 2016, she was speaking about how women like Michelle Obama proved that being stylish and successful weren’t mutually exclusive. Of course, she could have been talking about herself. With her Prada bags, Max Mara coats, and snappy one-liners—“It’s handled”—nobody exuded power more than Olivia Pope. More than her outfits, though, Washington gave women of color a role model. When Scandal first premiered, in 2012, it was the first time in nearly 40 years that a network TV drama had black female lead. And because of its success, Washington—along with showrunner Shonda Rhimes—helped usher in a new era of complicated, nuanced portrayals of strong black women, like Annalise Keating on How to Get Away With Murder. Imagine what Thursdays (and TV today) would have been without them. —L.S.\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nAs first lady, Michelle Obama shepherded us through the better part of the decade with sartorial choices that elevated American fashion (and made waves around the world) along with an unshakable sense of grace—when the world went low, she went high. But it was after she left the White House in 2017 that she really stepped into her power. As a private citizen, Obama has used the platform she earned as FLOTUS to launch herself into the culture-defining stratosphere, landing squarely in the spotlight as an author and as a producer for Netflix. If it was her wisdom as first lady that helped shape us this decade, it’s her candidness about everything from her journey with infertility, to her thoughts about the “lean in” philosophy of having it all (“That shit doesn’t work”), to her love of thigh-high glitter boots that’s made us feel seen. And helped fire us up for 2020. —M.M.\n\nAwkwafina\n\nWhen Awkwafina hosted Saturday Night Live in 2018, she became the second Asian woman, after Lucy Liu, to have the honor. In her opening monologue she shared, \"Back in 2000, I came to 30 Rock and waited outside when my idol, Lucy Liu, hosted SNL. I was a kid, and I didn't have a ticket, so I knew I wasn't getting in, but I just wanted to be near the building. And I remember how important that episode was for me, and how it totally changed what I thought was possible for an Asian American woman.\" In this decade Awkwafina continues to push storytelling forward herself by showing Asian women in all their many dimensions. She starred in box-office hit Crazy Rich Asians. A dramatic turn in The Farewell, in which she plays a woman who visits her ill grandmother in China, scored her a Golden Globe nom. And in 2020 she’ll get her own Comedy Central series. —Samantha Leach\n\nBeyoncé\n\nIt’s true that Beyoncé’s impact goes beyond just one decade, but in the 2010s alone she did the most. The singer released three studio albums as a solo artist, two live albums, a movie soundtrack, a fashion line, and a collaborative album with her husband, Jay-Z. Beyond that, though, she changed the way we consume music for generations to come. In December 2013 she dropped a self-titled album exclusively on iTunes without any promotion or prereleased singles. Since then, several artists—including Drake and Kanye West—have followed her lead. Then she did it again, releasing the soul-baring Lemonade in April 2016 in conjunction with a film on HBO. I remember sitting on the couch with my roommates as it happened, trying to figure out if we were watching a documentary, movie, or visual album. It wasn’t until later that I realized we were actually watching the culture shift. —Khaliha Hawkins\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus was already a success by the decade’s start thanks to Seinfeld. (In fact, she got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.) By 2019, though, she had 14 Emmy nominations—and nine total wins—as producer and star of HBO's Veep. When she won in 2017, she made history as the first woman to win Best Actress in a Comedy six times in a row for the same role (a record previously held by Candice Bergen for Murphy Brown). But it was her battle with stage II breast cancer that really resonated: When Louis-Dreyfus announced her diagnosis, she also expressed her stance on universal health care. “The good news is that I have the most glorious group of supportive and caring family and friends, and fantastic insurance through my union,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"The bad news is that not all women are so lucky, so let's fight all cancers and make universal health care a reality.\" —J.R.\n\nSimone Biles\n\nIt’s hard to capture Simone Biles’s impact on the 2010s without chronicling her very impressive (and very long) list of athletic accomplishments. She is hands down the best gymnast—male or female—to ever compete. Ever. Her skill level is so high that she’s had three moves officially named after her, forever changing her sport. Did we mention she’s only 22? Through medal after medal, she’s refused to quiet the roar of the Biles Express, even wearing a leotard emblazoned with a bedazzled goat in training earlier this year—a “jab back” at the “haters”—much to the delight of the Twittersphere. She’s a leader among a new generation of female athletes (alongside Serena Williams and the kickass players of the U.S. Women’s National Team) unafraid to bask in their own glory. With every mind-boggling triple double, Biles reminds us all that relentlessly challenging ourselves and shamelessly enjoying the payoff is real strength. —M.M.\n\nSamantha Bee\n\nWould we have survived the decade without Samantha Bee? Probably. Would we have laughed as much? Definitely not. After 12 years with The Daily Show With Jon Stewart—a run that made her the program’s longest-serving regular correspondent—Bee left in 2015 to host her own show, Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, on TBS. With its debut, Bee became the first woman to host a late-night satire show and made it clear she was committed to bringing more women up with her. She and her producer made headlines for their unique hiring process, which helped her find a more diverse and female staff than similar shows. (She also made headlines after she referred to Ivanka Trump as a…well, just google it.) Bee used her platform to spectacular effect, hosting Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2017, releasing a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt that raised over $1 million for Planned Parenthood, and launching her own production outfit—appropriately called Swimsuit Competition—in 2018. —M.K.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nAngelina Jolie—and all her composite parts—had a helluva decade. In 2012 her right leg achieved independent Internet fame at the Oscars. In 2014 her (prosthetic) cheekbones graced screens in Maleficent, a rabid success which made close to $760 million at the box office. In 2013 she made the brave decision to get a preventive double mastectomy after learning she was a carrier for the BRCA gene, and then talked openly about it in an op-ed in the New York Times. That choice spawned what doctors termed the “Angelina Jolie effect,” as women rushed to get tested for the genetic condition that had made Jolie more vulnerable to the disease. Meanwhile, she split from Brad Pitt in 2016, ramped up her humanitarian efforts, and moved behind the camera to direct acclaimed films like In the Land of Blood and Honey, Unbroken, and First They Killed My Father. —M.K.\n\nLena Dunham\n\nIn 2012 all anyone wanted to talk about was Lena Dunham’s naked body. Girls had just aired and the director-writer-star was naked in it a lot. (For an Emmy skit that year, she was even filmed nude while eating cake in a bathroom stall at the awards ceremony.) But playing Hannah Horvath—a 20-something struggling in Brooklyn along with her best friends—Dunham changed the landscape for what a sexual woman was allowed to look like onscreen. She showed that a woman didn't have to be sample size to want sex, have sex, and be desired. While Girls launched Dunham's career, her outspoken nature defined it. Throughout the decade Dunham sparked many controversies—everything from wishing she'd had an abortion to unfairly criticizing NFL player Odell Beckham Jr. (both of which she apologized for, inspiring the Twitter account \"Lena Dunham Apologizes.”). The star pushed boundaries onscreen, in media, and in her personal life—often to mixed results—but never without captivating culture. —S.L.\n\nE.L. James\n\nShe wrote the book that kicked off a revolution. No, not a political manifesto or a social media screed a call to action. (Well, a call to a particular kind action.) At the start of this decade, E.L. James gave us 50 Shades of Grey, a book that grew out of the fanfic she wrote based on the teen Twilight novels. The first in a trio of erotic romance novels—with Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed released in rapid succession—the novels have sold over 150 million copies worldwide and helped launch BDSM into the mainstream, awakening suburban moms in 50 languages. The books (and the movies based on them) now form a billion-dollar entertainment behemoth, and in the words of the New York Times, their author has gone from “anonymous writer posting lusty fantasies online, to an erotic industry mogul who’s running her own small empire of kink.” —M.K.\n\nIssa Rae\n\nIn 2011, Issa Rae launched her web series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl to YouTube. The series followed J, an introvert navigating love, work, and friendships, and was praised for its refreshingly realistic portrayal of black women online. The success from that helped Rae turn Awkward Black Girl (ABG), a scrappy Kickstarter funded show, into Insecure, a hilarious series for HBO that’s given us three seasons and a rabid fan base. (If you know a member of the Lawrence hive, then you get it.) The now multihyphenate Rae’s résumé includes actor, writer, director, and producer. She’s also been nominated for two Golden Globes and an Emmy, and we hope to see a win come in 2020. More than that, the 2010s saw a surge of YouTube talent transitioning from the smallest screen to making huge deals—Rae wasn’t the first or only one to do it, but nobody’s done it quite as seamlessly as she has. —K.H.\n\nKatie Holmes\n\nMarry the world’s biggest film star. Join his controversial religion. Have a daughter, Suri, with superstar husband. Divorce him in unprecedented coup orchestrated in part by your lawyer father. Leave Scientology. Move to New York and start a secret romance with another A-lister. (Oh hey, Jamie Foxx.) Change career paths and become a director. Turn into a fashion icon. If we’ve been blindsided by the ups and downs of Katie Holmes’s personal life and career over the last 10-plus years, imagine what a roller coaster it must have been for her. But what would the 2010s have been like without the evolution of our Dawson’s Creek favorite? Not only did she prove that there is no barrier to wearing a (cashmere!) bra in public, but she showed us how to gain the upper hand in a breakup without ever saying a word. —Natasha Pearlman\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nAt the decade’s start, Demi Lovato was 17 and best known for her work on the Disney Channel. But, like so many child stars before her, Lovato struggled under the spotlight. In November 2010 she checked in to a treatment facility citing personal reasons—later revealed to include depression, addiction, an eating disorder, and self-harm. Lovato went on to release four albums—Unbroken (2011), Demi (2013), Confident (2015), and Tell Me You Love Me (2017)—all of which debuted in the top five of the Billboard 200. Throughout this, Lovato was open with fans about her recovery process in a way we don’t typically see from celebrities. In 2018, Lovato even revealed through the single “Sober” that she had relapsed after six years of sobriety. This raw honesty has shown Lovato’s true purpose: She’s lobbied Congress for mental health reform, offered group counseling sessions to fans before her concerts, and continually put an important spotlight on addiction and mental health. —K.F.\n\nKristen Stewart\n\nKristen Stewart—or, if you prefer, K-Stew—was the face of one of the biggest franchises of the last two decades. (The Twilight movies, of course, which were released from 2008 to 2012.) During that time, and even now still, her every move was covered by celebrity media—first for her rumors around relationship with costar Robert Pattinson, then for cheating on him after photographs of her kissing her Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders surfaced. Stewart had to endure even more public scrutiny than usual for that last one. People claimed the scandal would end her career, and don't forget that President Donald Trump famously tweeted that Pattinson should dump her. But she's moved on—and up. Now she's starring in critically beloved independent films, praised for her daring fashion moments, and gleefully confirming on SNL that she is, as she put it, \"so gay.\" —K.H.\n\nSnooki\n\nI could write an entire thesis on the cultural impact of Jersey Shore. (In fact, I once did a paper on Mizzou students who GTL’ed.) Not only did the MTV show birth catchphrases every college kid in 2009 and 2010 shouted on the way to the bar—Cabs are here! T-shirt time!—it gave us one of the most iconic reality-TV stars of our time. Nicole Polizzi (aka Snooki) could have been a fleeting punch line. A meatball blip on the radar of MTV infamy. Instead, she leaned in to her party-girl persona to turn it into an empire. Who among a regrettable subsection of us didn’t wear The Pouf or use her tanning lotion? By 2013 her estimated net worth was roughly $4 million. Even as she pivoted away from partying and into motherhood, she’s maintained a loyal fan base—so much so that MTV brought Jersey Shore back last year. Our tans might have faded for good, but our love for Snooki lives on. —L.S.\n\nMelina Matsoukas\n\nA regular on the thinking-woman's music video circuit—Solange’s “Losing You,\" Rihanna’s “We Found Love,” and Beyoncé's politically charged “Formation\" among them—the decade also found director Melina Matsoukas lending her unflinching eye to prestige series television. HBO's Insecure managed to perfectly meld creator Issa Rae's authentic perspective on the female black experience with Matsoukas's dreamy, elevated patina and—no matter your position on Aziz Ansari—the “Thanksgiving” episode she directed for Netflix's Master of None is one of the decade's best stand-alone 30 minutes of television. Her authentic, stylized point of view was also communicated in her work for brands like Lexus and Nike, for whom she created that powerful \"Equality” video. We expect even bigger for her in the decade to come: In 2019, the 38-year-old made her feature film directorial debut—one of the few females to do so this year—with Queen and Slim, a romance set against the backdrop of police violence. —P.S.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nIn 2010, Taylor Swift was a country hit maker with a few chart-topping albums and an armful of Grammys on her résumé. Then came a successful transition to pop, which led to more chart-topping albums and Grammys. Impressive, to be sure, but Swift’s impact goes much deeper than that. There's that open letter she wrote to Apple Music, criticizing the service for not paying artists royalties. (She won.) And the countersuit against a radio DJ for assault, which started a national conversation about sexual harassment. (She won that too.) Now she's taking on Scooter Braun—and the music industry at large—over artists’ rights. “I saw that people loved to explain away a woman’s success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization,\" Swift said while accepting Billboard’s Woman of the Decade award. \"This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldn’t do is exactly what I did.” —A.M.\n\nGillian Flynn\n\nFor the last seven years, every new book involving a complicated woman, some twists, and a vague, female-centric title has been trumpeted as “the new Gone Girl.” That’s thanks to author Gillian Flynn, whose 2012 game-changing novel sold upwards of 15 million copies, spawned a critically acclaimed blockbuster directed by David Fincher, and single-handedly birthed a new genre of literary fiction known as “domestic noir.” Whether you enjoyed the book or not, it’s hard to deny the fact that Flynn elevated the category of “chick lit” thanks to her smart, sometimes dangerous writing, her unapologetically insane female lead, and that now legendary shocker in the second act. By doing so, Flynn gathered scores of emulators—among them New York Times best-sellers Paula Hawkins’s The Girl on the Train and Jessica Knoll’s Luckiest Girl Alive—igniting a new wave of flawed female characters. —P.S.\n\nSarah Paulson\n\nTelevision underwent a huge transformation in the 2010s, and Sarah Paulson was at the center of it. Thanks to the wildly popular Ryan Murphy–produced shows she starred in, like American Horror Story and American Crime Story, the anthology and miniseries formats have become more mainstream—and desirable to A-list talents. Now stars like Amy Adams and Meryl Streep are actually turning to TV, a medium that used to be viewed as an acting death sentence. They were surely inspired by Paulson’s incredible work—like her turn as Marcia Clark in ACS, which earned her every award under the sun, or one of her many vibrant characters on Horror Story. Simply put, Paulson, now an A-list star herself, was doing TV before it was cool. She’s a muse for Ryan Murphy, one of the industry’s boldest visionaries, and together they’ve created some of the most compelling television this decade. —C.R.\n\nZendaya\n\nZendaya is one of those blessed talents who can do it all. She sings. She acts. She tops every red-carpet best-dressed list. She puts on inclusive fashion shows. She makes us cry in her most recent role as Rue on Euphoria, HBO’s teen drama about addiction, mental illness, and sparkly eye shadow. And she’s become an outspoken voice of her generation and our culture at large. One of the first—and most memorable—examples of this: In 2015, Zendaya wore a stunning Vivienne Westwood gown with locs to the Oscars. In an episode of Fashion Police following the ceremony, Giuliana Rancic said the star looked like she smelled of “patchouli” and “weed.” Zendaya posted an in-depth reply on Instagram in which she both stood up for herself as well as educated Rancic (and many others) about the racist stereotypes Rancic was perpetuating with her comments. As she put it, “There is a fine line between what is funny and disrespectful.” —K.H.\n\nTarana Burke\n\nIt’s been two years since the New York Times and New Yorker investigations into the sexual misconduct of Harvey Weinstein propelled #MeToo into the global zeitgeist, but the work actually started more than a decade ago by Tarana Burke. In 2006, the activist started using #MeToo on Twitter to give voice to survivors of sexual violence, especially women of color. Since then, the hashtag has grown into a worldwide movement—one that, at times, seemed to focus more on the powerful men in Hollywood than healing the survivors. \"Calling out individual bad actors doesn’t get us to the root of the problem,” said Burke, in an essay for Variety. \"The goal is to provide a mechanism to support survivors and move people to action.” #MeToo is an ever-evolving movement, in short, but Burke continue to lead the work until it's done. —Shanna Shipin\n\nChrissy Metz\n\nBefore Chrissy Metz arrived onscreen as Kate Pearson in This Is Us in 2016, plus-size women like her character simply didn’t exist in pop culture. What we saw instead: unlovable best friend types and gross stereotypes. With Kate, though, TV finally had a female, plus-size leading character shown in her full complexity who isn’t being body-shamed or mocked. More important, Kate’s story has moved beyond her weight—she’s found love, had a child, and pursued a singing career over the series’ four seasons. For Metz, that’s what makes this role—one that’s earned her both Emmy and Golden Globe nominations—so important. “People are still surprised that a big girl could be on TV, and it’s like, Ugh, really? Really?” she told Glamour in her November 2018 cover story. “There’s so much other stuff to talk about.” —AM\n\nKris Jenner\n\nThey don’t say “The devil works hard, but Kris Jenner works harder” for nothing. At the start of the decade, we were living in an entirely different Kardashian universe. Kris was still married to Bruce, Mason was a newborn, and Kim was fresh off a breakup with Reggie Bush. While Kris had already used her enterprising skills to score the family a television show deal, her entrepreneurial side really flourished after 2010 as she turned her daughters from reality stars into full-blown moguls. The momager helped Kylie launch Kylie Cosmetics (which earned her daughter the distinction of becoming the youngest self-made billionaire, ever) and was the wind beneath her daughter's wings as Kim, Khloé, and Kourtney all went on to create their own brands: Skims, Good American, and Poosh, respectively. To quote Kris herself, \"You're doing amazing, sweetie!\" —S.L.\n\nLiza Koshy\n\nOnce upon a time, for a brown comedian to “make it” in Hollywood, they had to sit through endless castings for racially ambiguous or flat-out offensive secondary roles. That was before Vine launched in 2012, and Liza Koshy, now 23, began uploading six-second skits and sight gags. By 2017, when Vine went defunct, she had 7 million followers. Today she’s got 18 million on Instagram, 17.7 million on YouTube, and 14.1 million on TikTok. Koshy represents a new generation of entertainers—not only are they the writers and the actors of their own comedies; they’re the producers and videographers. They’ve got complete control (sometimes for better or worse) of the content they create. But what Koshy has done that few have successfully managed is parlay her kooky sense of humor into traditional comedy gigs, like a role in Tyler Perry’s Boo! A Madea Halloween and Hulu’s Freakish. Casting directors of the future, take note. —L.S.\n\nNicole Kidman\n\n“I’m in a position as an actress where I love the lines being blurred, because I get to play younger, I get to play older, and I get to play my age,” Nicole Kidman told Glamour in a 2018 interview. “I think other women are going, ‘No, I want to see women who I relate to, who I’ve grown up with, not just be discarded. I want to see them achieving things and still going strong.’” She’s absolutely right, and the 52-year-old is actively changing how women in Hollywood are perceived. This decade she’s taken on role after role that shows women in all their complexity—look at her IMDb page from this year for proof. She gave a powerful performance as a domestic abuse survivor on HBO’s Big Little Lies, played a wealthy New York City socialite in the film adaptation of The Goldfinch, and convincingly channeled Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson in the buzzy drama Bombshell. —T.A.\n\nKate Gosselin\n\nIt was the reality television decade. We elected a reality star as president, the Kardashians became the de facto first family of the United States, and Bachelor contestants transformed into Hollywood heartthrobs. But nobody understands how an unknown can become a cultural sensation quite like Kate Gosselin. The mother of sextuplets and a set of twins got her first brush of fame as the star of Jon & Kate Plus 8 in the late aughts; by 2010, Gosselin had left her husband—inciting a tabloid frenzy—and booted him from the show's title, reclaiming the series as Kate Plus 8. Gosselin was an inescapable force in the early half of the decade, nearly always on a steady rotation of Us Weekly, Daily Mail, and People covers that breathlessly charted every up and down of her life. And with Kate Plus Date having premiered this past spring, we haven't seen the last of her yet. —S.L.\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino\n\nAmy Sherman-Palladino first entered the cultural zeitgeist when she created Gilmore Girls in 2000, but the show didn’t quite match her dreams. “We just didn’t have the budget, but we had this unbelievable cast,” she told Glamour earlier this year. A decade later—almost two, actually—Sherman-Palladino was able to revive the fan favorite series for Netflix. Then came The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel for Amazon Prime. “That’s the show where all the elements—the cast and the budget—came together,” she said of the period piece drama-comedy about a female comedian pursuing a career in the 1950s. The awards followed, of course: 34 Emmy nominations and 16 wins in its first two seasons, including wins for both comedy writing and directing (making Sherman-Palladino the first woman to achieve both). A fourth season of Maisel is on the way—and with rumors that Gilmore Girls could still come back for more, Sherman-Palladino has never been more in demand or in control. —J.R.\n\nMeghan Markle\n\nThere’s a lot that makes Meghan Markle stand out among the British royal family. She’s the only biracial woman, for one. The first American to marry into Buckingham Palace since 1937. Certainly the only Suits actor. She’s also the first duchess to...close her car door? The move, according to Vanity Fair, “is yet another silent signal that she is going to be doing things her own way and helping adapt and progress the British monarchy.” The Duchess of Sussex certainly is bringing the monarchy into the modern era with unparalleled grace—even when things are more nightmare than fairy tale. Markle’s opened up about the issues she's grappled with as a new wife, mother, and duchess whose life has been viciously judged by the media and public. But, even through the tears, she doesn’t lose her Markle Sparkle. And if we could bottle it up and sprinkle it all over the world, we’d all be better for it. —S.S.\n\nCate Blanchett\n\nCate Blanchett was known for her prolific acting career long before 2010, having already won an Oscar for her supporting role in the Aviator. But this was the decade she became a cultural phenomenon—the kind of woman that a certain sect of Twitter would delight at having run them over. Or, at the very least, step on their neck. Throughout the 2010s, Blanchett took major career risks that should inspire young actors looking for ways to diversify their IMDb page. She alternated between period pieces and turns in the Marvel Universe—playing a villain in Thor: Rangkor—and also joined a modern Rat Pack of women including Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway, and Rihanna for the all-female spin-off of Ocean's franchise Ocean's 8. In each of these roles Blanchett dazzled, surprised, and thrilled audiences. We have no doubt that Blanchett will absolutely dominate the ’20s as well. —S.L.\n\nSia\n\nIs there an influential song in the last decade that hasn’t been written or performed by the enigmatic and notoriously fame-shy Sia? Well, yes, but we can’t think of many. The Australian-born performer, 43, has authored and composed for Beyoncé, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Shakira, Jamie Foxx, Britney, Maroon 5, Kylie Minogue, Neyo, Rita Ora, Pitbull and Jessie J, and more alongside her own hit albums. She has almost single-handedly shaped and defined today’s culture through music. Rihanna’s “Diamonds\"? That’s her. Ne-Yo’s “Let Me Love You\"? Sia. David Guetta’s “Titanium”? All Sia. It would be hard not to have a song in your music library that she hasn’t written or influenced heavily. All that has helped her amass a (not-so-small) fortune, while at the same time challenging the outdated notion that pop stars have to be under 30 to be relevant. —N.P.\n\nAdele\n\nThere are only a few artists out there whose music makes the world stop, and Adele is one of them. The British singer released two monumental albums in the 2010s: 21 (2011) and 25 (2015), both which shattered sales records and earned her countless Grammys. 21 was the world’s best-selling album in both 2011 and 2012. “Hello,” the lead single off 25, became the first song to sell more than a million digital copies in a week. These numbers are seismic and speak to Adele’s influence, but her imprint on the decade transcends sales: She’s a shining example of how music industry trends can be rebuked. Exhibit A: when she released the soulful “Rolling in the Deep” amid a sea of female artists pushing electro-pop. She did the same thing with “Hello” in 2015, breaking up the boys’ club on Billboard’s Hot 100. Simply put, she’s a game changer. No wonder the world can’t wait for her next album. —C.R.\n\nAshley and Mary-Kate Olsen\n\nThe world's most elusive twins are eternally influential—the ’80s and ’90s saw them making millions as laugh-track queens on Full House, direct-to-VHS stars in films like Brother for Sale, and occasional music video creators with such hits as “Gimme Pizza.” The aughts basically existed for them to skulk around Robertson Boulevard and Tribeca wearing bohemian caftans and bug-eyed shades clutching Starbucks before pivoting to stone-serious fashion moguls. But during the 2010s, the twins also emerged as something else, thanks to the inception of Instagram and Pinterest: #Inspo. Since both platforms started in 2010, thousands of outfit photos and fervent fan accounts including @olsensanonymous, @olsenmoodboard @olsensdaily, @mkastyle, and @olsenoracle have sprung up, effectively centralizing their personal style for us to pore over and emulate. The last 10 years have found the twins morphing into aspirational public muses thanks to technology they themselves won't deign to join. —P.S.\n\nRuth Bader Ginsberg\n\n\"Crossover hit\" isn’t a phrase you’d associate with a Supreme Court justice, but Ruth Bader Ginsberg is as much a pop-culture icon as she is a federal judge. That’s because the living legend, who became just the second woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court when she was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, has been the strong (but soft-spoken), steady (but fierce), and measured (but badass) voice on issues like gender discrimination and affirmative action. Her dissents to conservative colleagues on the court are received like album drops, and she’s inspired thousands of memes, endless Etsy accouterment, and just, you know, millions of future activists worldwide. We watch the feminist icon's workouts, memorize the SNL rap about her, drink out of coffee mugs plastered with her face, dress up as her for Halloween, and view her as one of the tallest figures in Washington—despite her standing 5'1\". —S.S.\n\nLeah Remini\n\nFrom the age of nine, actor Leah Remini grew up as a devout Scientologist. (You know, the controversial religion beloved by celebrities like Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and their ilk.) But in July 2013, the once staunch follower made a shocking revelation: She was leaving the church behind, and she wasn’t going quietly. She became a whistle-blower for the abuse she claims to have witnessed within the organization and used her platform to share others’ stories too. The former King of Queens star released the New York Times best-selling memoir Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology in 2015. Then she debuted an eight-episode series for A&E called Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, where she spoke with other ex-Scientologists. While the church issued a statement calling Remini \"a spoiled entitled diva\" for her work—to the public this was the decade Remini became a crusader for speaking truth to power. —S.L.\n\nRihanna\n\nWhere do we even begin with this trailblazing creative and original HBIC? After bursting onto the scene as a fresh-faced island gal in 2005, Rihanna has steadily risen above the world’s expectations—shattering the glass ceiling and catapulting into the stratosphere with record-breaking albums and consumer brands. Aside from the countless bops for which we have RiRi to thank, the 31-year-old (let that sink in) revolutionized the beauty industry with an unprecedented foundation range for Fenty Beauty, flipped the lingerie space on its head with radical inclusivity for Savage x Fenty, and became the first black woman to head a luxury brand at LVMH. She did all this while keeping her spirit of authenticity, humor, and humbleness shining bright. The rare interview and occasional pop-off on social media proves she’s still the same down-to-earth, unapologetic person we met nearly 15 years ago. And even after taking over the world, she’s still the Rihanna we know and love. That might be the most pleasant surprise of all. —E.P.\n\nThe Founders of Black Lives Matter\n\nIn 2016, Glamour honored the founders of Black Lives Matter—Alicia Garza, Opal Tometi, and Patrisse Cullors—at our annual Women of the Year Awards. By then, their work had grown from an activist rallying cry to a movement that permeated every part of culture—including music, movies, and television. Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” has been chanted during many of the BLM protests and named Pitchfork’s best song of the 2010s for its “message of unbreakable optimism in the face of hardship.” In January 2018, the CW’s Black Lightning premiered and unapologetically discussed the struggle of black men and women and how they fight back, with and without a mask. Black Panther dominated the box office and celebrated black lives through its visuals, themes, costumes, and music. (Notably, Kendrick Lamar was an executive producer on the soundtrack.) And The Hate U Give, based on the book by the same name, was deeply rooted in the Black Lives Matter movement from beginning to end. —K.H.\n\nPetra Collins\n\nYou know that ubiquitous blown-out, dreamy, pastel-tinged style of photography that suddenly appeared in every magazine, music video, and fashion campaign in the past few years? Yeah, that’s all Petra Collins. The photographer, model, and director first gained notice on Instagram and Tumblr, as well as Tavi Genvinson’s Rookie, for her honest portrayal of girlhood (and for creating that American Apparel T-shirt of a menstruating vagina). High fashion embraced her soon after. Besides bringing the Tumblr-girl aesthetic mainstream, Collins’s work is most notable for her use of the female gaze—shooting women for women’s eyes, not for the pleasure of men. She captures the good, the bad, and the ugly of being a woman, something that was rarely seen before she came on the scene but has since become the norm. It’s thanks to Collins that artists like Selena Gomez aren’t afraid to get personal, and why brands like Gucci aren’t afraid to have fun. —B.C.\n\nLilly Singh\n\nIt took a bisexual woman of color to successfully break into the boys' club of late-night television. Leave it to Lilly Singh—known as IISuperwomanII to her more than 14.5 million followers on YouTube—to use her ~powers~ for good. A Little Late With Lilly, which debuted on NBC in September 2019, makes her the first woman to host a late-night network TV show in over 30 years. But the Toronto native's success didn’t happen overnight—or come easy. Singh amassed a loyal following over the past 10 years, using YouTube as a platform to share her comedy sketches, Punjabi culture, music, mental health struggles, and more. Worth a reported $16 million, she also recently authored the New York Times best-selling book How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life, and she started the social media movement #GirlLove to break the cycle of girl-on-girl hate. —S.S.\n\nSolange\n\nTo quote Nina Simone, it’s an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. Solange has followed this to a T. She went ahead and said what so many black women have been dying to say for ages with “Don’t Touch My Hair.” Her song “Cranes in the Sky” spoke to feelings of heaviness and despair that can be difficult to shake as a person of color in this day and age...alongside seriously stunning visuals. Solange’s music is a voice and a safe space for so many—but she also inspired people to step outside of the box with abstract style, hair, and makeup moments. Aside from the art, she’s been vocal about her own experience with health issues, divorce, and teenage motherhood—while delivering sounds that are easy to keep on repeat. Looking back at the youngest Knowles sister’s style and sonic evolution over the last 10 years, there’s surely so much in store for the decade ahead. —Erin Parker\n\nGal Gadot\n\nWith $821 million and counting in sales, Wonder Woman was one of the biggest hits of the decade. That’s even more impressive when you consider that this happened in 2017—years after streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime had drastically changed how and where we watch movies. At the center was star Gal Gadot, an Israeli-born newcomer who showed everyone—namely, bros who felt shut out of the all-female screenings—that, yes, a female-led superhero tale can be a box-office win. (Not that we ever doubted for a second.) Even more than that, the former combat instructor and pageant winner was the kind of hero that little girls could look up to. Just watch this video of one tearing up as she meets Gadot, and you’ll understand why we all needed this real-life Wonder Woman. Her legacy will kick off the next decade as well, when Wonder Woman 1984 hits theaters in summer 2020. —A.M.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nMother Monster wore several hats in the 2010s: pop provocateur, jazz crooner, Super Bowl halftime performer, and, ultimately, award-winning actor. (She may have lost the Best Actress Oscar for A Star Is Born, but need we remind you she took home a Golden Globe for her performance in American Horror Story: Hotel?) The sheer range Gaga displayed this decade is awe-inspiring, as are the countless ways she moved the dial forward with her reinventions. Whether she was getting the word transgender played on Top 40 radio (“Born This Way,” 2011), giving a voice to survivors of sexual assault (“Til It Happens to You,” 2015), or making the world believe in love again (A Star Is Born, 2018), Lady Gaga’s vibrant, inclusive, and necessary artistry is all over the 2010s. And the world is a much kinder place for it. Paws up and meat dresses on, Little Monsters. —C.R.\n\nViola Davis\n\nWhen Viola Davis scored the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Fences in 2017, she also made history by becoming the first black actor to achieve the industry's storied triple crown: a Tony, an Emmy, and an Oscar. Her speech—like each one before it—was stirring, with Davis explaining how the best inspiration comes from those whose stories never got to be told. \"There is one place that all the people with the greatest potential are gathered and that’s the graveyard. People ask me all the time—what kind of stories do you want to tell, Viola? And I say exhume those bodies. Exhume those stories.\" The decade also brought us one of the most powerful moments in TV history, which was conceived by Davis: When her character on ABC’s How to Get Away With Murder removed her wig and makeup before a confrontation with her husband. In 2015 she won a SAG award for that role, and had us cheering when she thanked the show “for thinking a sexualized, messy, mysterious woman could be a 49-year-old dark-skinned African American woman who looks like me.” —P.S.\n\nJoanna Gaines\n\nOver the course of the 2010s, Joanna Gaines—alongside her business partner and husband, Chip—rose from humble Fixer Upper beginnings to a spot as the de facto queen of the DIY home-improvement market. She helped turn your mom’s HGTV into a millennial-friendly empire, complete with her own brand (Magnolia Home), her own TV network (Magnolia Network), and a store that’s become a tourist destination (Magnolia Market). Gaines is also the woman behind a generation-defining aesthetic none of us seems to be immune to. You know the one: bright airy spaces, natural wood accents, lots of glossy white subway tile in the kitchen. If you’ve purchased a white clay vase or distressed vintage rug to make your home more Instagrammable in the past decade, you likely have Gaines to thank. —M.M.\n\nGigi and Bella Hadid\n\nGigi and Bella Hadid couldn’t legally operate automobiles at the start of the decade, and now they’re two of the highest-paid, most sought-after supermodels in the world. You may have seen the sisters for the first time alongside their mother, Yolanda, in Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, but Gigi got her start in modeling for Baby Gap back in the ’90s. Since then, the sisters have taken the industry by storm, covering dozens of Vogue covers and garnering more than 77 million Instagram followers collectively. They aren't the first celebrity supermodels—hello, favorites like Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell—but they've helped revolutionize what it means to be a supermodel in the modern age. The Hadids are not nameless faces to sell clothing and makeup—far from it. As personalities voraciously consumed by the public, the pop-culture icons are still in their early 20s, so it’s easy to see the potential is boundless for the dynamic duo. —E.P.\n\nSarah Koenig\n\nFor many a dark millennia, humans existed without podcasts. We wandered listless, listening to our own thoughts rattling around in our brains. Then in 2014, Sarah Koenig made Serial, a podcast so good that the practice of listening to couture recorded radio shows on your smartphone became A Thing. Koenig and her team’s reporting and storytelling skills transfixed America as she unspooled the story of Adnan Syed, the man convicted of murdering Hae Min Lee. Downloaded more than 175 million times, the podcast had ramifications for Syed’s conviction and spawned two subsequent seasons and an HBO documentary. Koenig revitalized auditory storytelling and helped the format become mainstream, but her work over three seasons of Serial also catalyzed America to ask needed questions about the flaws in our justice system. —J.S.\n\nShonda Rhimes\n\nShonda Rhimes was already a force in 2010, as ABC darling Grey's Anatomy (heralded for its female-led, racially diverse cast) entered its sixth season. Grey’s will close out the decade in its 16th season as the longest-running American prime-time medical drama; it’s been renewed through season 17. With that Grey's success, Rhimes could've put up her feet, but Shondaland continued to turn out hits, including Scandal, which had a seven-year run, several spin-offs and shorter-lived shows, and How to Get Away With Murder, which premiered in 2014 and will wrap after its sixth season in 2020. If you think that means Rhimes is slowing down, you’re mistaken: In 2017 she entered a multiyear production deal with Netflix. The first project tied to the deal, an adaption of the story of society scammer Anna Delvey, was announced in 2018. —K.F.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nFor many years, pop music was a game of artifice: an exercise in producing the most bombastic hits and candy-colored videos. Then social media exploded, and fans started craving something else from their artists: authenticity. And Ariana Grande was right there to deliver it. The 26-year-old is arguably our culture’s first-ever real-time pop star. When she started dating comedian Pete Davidson in summer 2018, she added a tribute song for him to her basically finished album, Sweetener. And when that relationship ended—coupled with the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller—she put her tour plans on hold to record a new, cathartic record (2019’s Thank U, Next). This, mixed with her unfiltered social media presence and transparency in dealing with PTSD from the bombing at her 2017 Manchester concert, have put her squarely at the center of pop’s departure from fantasy. She’s largely responsible for the music industry’s realization that, right now, people crave substance more than they do spectacle. —C.R.\n\nLaverne Cox\n\nWe still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do to lift trans people up in entertainment and the media, but Laverne Cox made serious strides for the community over the decade. After breaking into the mainstream with her poignant performance in Orange Is the New Black, she went on to be the first openly trans person to be nominated (and win) a Primetime Emmy Award and appear on the cover of Time. Cox has remained vocal about the prejudice, violence, and disadvantages trans people—specifically trans women of color—face daily and has impacted the conversation around trans rights and representation in a major way. Watching her rise in the ranks in Hollywood proves the untapped potential and tenacious spirit of the LGBTQ community as a whole, and it’s safe to say this is only the beginning for the trailblazing talent. —E.P.\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nReese Witherspoon was already an A-lister by the time the 2010s arrived, but her profile grew even higher after she started a new chapter of her career: producer. In 2012 she started the production company Pacific Standard with the goal of developing movies with strong female roles. She achieved that—and then some. Just a few of the novels, all written by women, she’s adapted: Gillian Flynn’s Gone Girl, Cheryl Strayed’s Wild, and Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies. (Heard of ’em?) It shouldn't have been so revolutionary that Witherspoon helped create more interesting, complicated roles for women, but we're glad she did. As Witherspoon said in her 2015 Glamour Women of the Year speech, “[My] company isn't just thriving because it feels like a good thing to do. It's thriving because female-driven films work...films with women at the center are not a public service project, they are a big-time, bottom-line-enhancing, money-making commodity.” —A.M.\n\nMindy Kaling\n\nIs everyone hanging out without us? Now that Mindy Kaling has assumed her full power as writer, producer, star, show creator, and author, we feel less stressed about this. Aside from her long résumé, one of Kaling’s great powers is that her work makes us feel less alone. She created The Mindy Project, a beloved TV show that was also quietly radical—an Indian woman doctor who’s obsessed with sex and can’t stop eating doughnuts? More of that forever, please! A natural role model, everything she makes and in everything where she appears—from voicing Disgust in Inside Out to starring in and writing Late Night—there is always a sense that she’s our friend, our girl, our representative. She doesn’t distance herself from traditionally feminine things—romance and bright colors and gossip—to try to seem more legitimate. She announces in everything she does that being yourself and loving what you love is completely legitimate. —J.S.\n\nBlake Lively\n\nThe only thing the Internet is more obsessed with than Blake Lively is trying to figure out why we’re all obsessed with Blake Lively. The allure of the blond Rapunzel-haired actor has been dissected ad nauseam following her Gossip Girl days. Where everyone seems to agree though—beside the fact that her social media presence with husband Ryan Reynolds is endlessly entertaining—is that Lively’s style is the perfect amalgamation of classic but interesting, aspirational yet attainable. She could be wearing Forever21 and make it look high-fashion or couture but make it feel fun, not stuffy. Add in the fact that she doesn’t have a stylist, and her outfits become all the more intriguing. It’s not to say she’s always had a golden track record with fashion. Her defunct Goop-esque lifestyle site, Preserve, faced controversy for being tone-deaf and too expensive for her fans. But no hiccup lasts long. She’s back to wearing eight looks in 48 hours and our pervasive obsession continues. —L.S.\n\nKesha\n\nWhen Kesha burst onto the charts in 2009 with “Tik Tok,” we all thought we had her figured out: She liked messy hookups, whiskey, and a ton of glitter. In what was arguably one of the last years of true bubblegum-pop music, Kesha fit right in. Although she was cranking out hit after hit of unabashed pop gold, we soon learned there’s so much more to Kesha than her party-girl persona, which was largely engineered by her former producer Dr. Luke. Two years before #MeToo, Kesha sued Dr. Luke for emotional and physical abuse. A monstrous legal battle, as well as an outpouring of support, followed. Kesha lost the battle, but won the war: Though she lost her case, she was able to release Rainbow in 2017. It’s her first album without any Dr. Luke production, and the first time we got to see—and hear—who she truly is. —B.C.\n\nEmily Ratajkowski\n\nLove her, object to her, envy her. Whatever, it’s pretty unlikely that at some point in the last decade you haven’t debated Emily Ratajkowski (or @emrata as she is more commonly known to her 24.8 million Instagram followers) with your friends. “Can she really be a feminist while flashing her breasts on social media?” “Isn’t she playing into the hands of lascivious men?” “But don’t you think that true empowerment, as a woman, is doing whatever the hell you want?” “It’s her body, her rules…” We could go on, but you get it. If anyone has urged us to challenge our notions and beliefs around feminism, sex positivity, and female nudity this decade, it’s Ratajkowski. She flaunts her body, she flaunts her hyper femininity, and she flaunts her deeply held beliefs that women should be allowed and supported to be anything they want to be. Frankly, who are we to argue with that? —N.P.\n\nJenji Kohan\n\nOrange Is the New Black transformed the way we watch TV in the last decade, and we have creator Jenji Kohan to thank for that. When the series premiered on Netflix in 2013, it featured a diverse cast of women, something that was—and still is—revolutionary. Even the tone of the show felt new: Here was a series that covered serious issues like sexual assault, the American prison system, and addiction but was labeled a “comedy.” Naturally, it became a hit, and viewers consumed each season as quickly as possible, making OITNB one of the first series we collectively “binge-watched.” Those are just a few reasons creator Jenji Kohan deserves a place in TV history. “We do our thing,” she told Glamour in a look back at the trailblazing series before its final season this year. “Some people like it. If they don’t, okay. Don’t watch. We broke a lot of rules.” —T.A.\n\nTiffany Haddish\n\nAfter appearing in blockbuster hit Girls Trip and writing her own memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, Tiffany Haddish is on the up-and-up—but she hasn’t stayed mum on hardships she faced early on in her career. The 40-year-old has made it perfectly clear her rise to the top was a long and winding road, revealing she lived in her car at some points prior to fame—during which she was “homeless, hungry, and scared.” She’s spoken out on her own experience with sexual assault, witnessing domestic abuse during childhood, and how comedy has been an outlet for her pain. Haddish’s ability to use her craft as a form of healing—along with her unfiltered attitude, contagious laughter, and honesty around her story—has surely impacted the comedian’s success. Her unconventional, sometimes painful story is living proof that what they say is true: Never give up. —E.P.\n\nAmy Schumer\n\n“I’m probably, like, 160 pounds right now, and I can catch a dick whenever I want.” Like a presidential election or a natural disaster, who can forget what it felt like to hear Amy Schumer say these words when she accepted British Glamour’s Trailblazer award in 2015? Schumer not only dominated the decade in comedy; she distinctly created mainstream comedy that was targeted at women, which men were welcome to enjoy, something that had never been successful at this level. In between producing iconic sketches (“Last Fuckable Day”) and creating an entry to the genre of Great American Rom-Coms (Trainwreck), she campaigned significantly to change legislation to prevent gun violence, got a Tony nomination, started a podcast, and got arrested protesting Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court. She also hosted Saturday Night Live twice, used her comedy to meaningfully deconstruct stigma around autism, got married, and had a baby. May we all catch dicks in the next decade, in her honor. —J.S.\n\nChrissy Teigen\n\nJust a few things on Chrissy Teigen’s to-do list from the past decade: Write Cravings: Recipes for All of the Food You Want to Eat, a New York Times best-seller. Become \"Rookie of the Year\" in Sports Illustrated’s 2010 Swimsuit Issue. Cohost Lip Sync Battle, a wildly popular series in which celebrities, well, lip-synch. Marry John Legend. Give birth to Luna and Miles, two of the cutest children in human history. Oh, and completely change how celebrities use Twitter. Teigen’s hilarious commentary, troll takedowns, AMAs, and all-around openness has changed celebrity media coverage too: Getting insights into the drama and minutiae of a star’s life via murky reports from “sources” feels like a thing of the past—celebrities now follow Teigen’s lead instead, shutting down rumors with a quick video, sharing their political views with a retweet, or posting intimate Instagrams that are way more authentic than any glossy photo shoot. —A.M.\n\nMelania Trump\n\nMelania Trump probably didn’t see her future shaking out this way. At the turn of the decade, the former model was hawking a (now defunct) QVC jewelry brand and “caviar” skin-care line. Even five years ago, a style controversy for Trump would have entailed getting a callout on Fashion Police—not having her neckline analyzed on a global scale. But in 2016, life—for all Americans—changed, and Trump’s fashion decisions went from being casual red-carpet fodder to a mouthpiece for her political position. While her stylist has claimed there are no deeper meanings behind her outfits, fashion has long been a medium through which first ladies communicate. (Michelle Obama, for example, used her platform to support emerging American designers.) And Trump's choices, at times, have felt so on the nose, it’s hard to imagine no one considered the message they send. (See that “I Really Don't Care, Do U?” jacket.) With 2020 on the horizon, it’s safe to say there will certainly be more outfits open to interpretation. —L.S.\n\nTaraji P. Henson\n\nIt wasn’t always that a woman talking about mental health would be shared and celebrated, but it is now more than ever—and that’s thanks to women like Taraji P. Henson. She’s played some of the most boss roles in TV and film, from business mogul Cookie Lyon on Empire to a mathematician in Hidden Figures, but Henson knows her purpose doesn’t stop there: She’s also a dedicated philanthropist. The 49-year-old founded the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation in 2018 in her late father’s memory to remove the stigma around mental health in the African American community, especially among teens. Depression and anxiety aren't just taboos she’s driven to eradicate through her charity work and at congressional hearings, but something she deals with herself. “I want to touch as many children as possible. These babies are suffering,” she testified to Congress. \"And I just feel that is what God sent me here to do. I finally figured it out.” —S.S.\n\nJodi Kantor and Meghan Twohey\n\nOn October 5, 2017, when Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey published their first bombshell article about Harvey Weinstein in the New York Times, the world changed. The reason life today looks a little different than it did in fall 2017 is the result of group effort on a massive scale—namely the women who bravely came forward with their experiences and the publications that got their stories out. Kantor and Twohey did the work that made women feel that it was worth the risk to speak. They labored on this project for years, pursuing truth and justice despite the terrifying impediments. Their commitment to thorough, compassionate, fearless journalism resulted in the groundswell of change that is the #MeToo movement. The women, the reporters, the witnesses—they all made the movement possible. And Kantor and Twohey are two of its greatest leaders. —J.S.\n\nEllen DeGeneres\n\nYou know her as the quick-witted daytime talk-show host who's been interviewing and hobnobbing with celebrities like the Kardashians, Jennifer Aniston, and Justin Bieber since 2003. Who DeGeneres is hanging out with has become such a national conversation, in fact, that endless think pieces were devoted to her friendship with former President George W. Bush. But she’s started other important conversations too. In 2016 she opened up about her experience with sexual assault to help other survivors. \"It angers me when victims aren't believed because we just don't make stuff up,\" she said at the time. That same year President Barack Obama bestowed DeGeneres with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work toward LGBTQ+ equality. “Ellen DeGeneres has lifted our spirits and brought joy to our lives as a stand-up comic, actor, and television star,” he said. “At a pivotal moment, her courage and candor helped change the hearts and minds of million of Americans, accelerating our nations constant drive toward equality and acceptance for all.” —T.A.\n\nLea Michele\n\nGlee premiered on Fox in 2009 with a nearly unknown cast and an interesting concept: Social issues like body image and teen pregnancy dealt with through music and teen angst. Led by Barbra Streisand wannabe Rachel Berry—played by Lea Michele—the series took off practically overnight. Mega stars like Gwyneth Paltrow joined for multi-episode arcs. Magazines rushed to get the stars, especially Michele, on their covers, with GQ even asking, “How the hell did a show about high school theater geeks come to be the biggest TV show in America?” Glee clubs across America nearly tripled. Michele herself scored an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy and was named one of Time’s Most Influential People in the World. But obsessive levels of fame led to intense rumors of behind-the-scenes turmoil, which became nearly unbearable when Michele’s costar and real-life boyfriend, Cory Monteith, died. In the aftermath she relied on the support of the Glee fandom to carry on his legacy, and bring the series to a fitting close two years after his passing. —J.R.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nWhen a 16-year-old Miley Cyrus gyrated on top of an ice cream cart at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, she’s made one thing clear: Hannah Montana can’t be tamed anymore. After breaking out of the Disney Channel mold, Cyrus has been unabashedly herself, never afraid to express her sexuality or speak her mind. In addition to being a champion for not giving an eff, she’s been responsible for some of the biggest—and most controversial—pop-culture moments of the decade, from that “Wrecking Ball” music video to twerking at the VMAs to her on-again, off-again romance with Liam Hemsworth. She’s made some mistakes—some critics have accused her of appropriating black culture and abandoning it when it was convenient—but she always seems to land on her feet. —B.C.\n\nTilda Swinton\n\nThere are few Hollywood actors like Tilda Swinton. Correction: There are none. For which other A-lister has lain in a glass box in the Museum of Modern Art eight hours a day for a week in the name of performance art? Or lives in the remote Scottish Highlands alongside her ex-partner and the father of her twins, John Byrne, and new partner, artist Sandro Kopp? Or has blazed such a meaningful trend-transcendent trail on the red carpet in a way that includes, celebrates, and does away with all notions of conventions? She is, of course, also an Oscar-winning actor. But it’s her “give no fucks” attitude that has shown so many women—and inspired so many in her wake—that success doesn’t have to measured in Cinderella dresses. She’s taught us to go our own way, and never to compromise. Her Out of Office says it all: “Hello, I am away until 01/01/2070 and am unable to read your message.\" Preach. —N.P.\n\nMelissa McCarthy\n\nAt the start of the decade, you may have known Melissa McCarthy as the cheery sidekick on Gilmore Girls if you knew her at all. But soon, it became clear this was going to be McCarthy’s decade and we were all just living in it. Like a professional climber skipping confidently up Machu Picchu, she won Emmys for Mike and Molly and hosting SNL, topped highest-paid female actor lists, and launched a fashion line. Her brand of physical, bold, filthy comedy made her a superstar. Then, just as we were getting used to her consistent stream of blockbuster comedies, many that she also produced, she went ahead and casually starred in the drama Can You Forgive Me? McCarthy had such a long career before she exploded with success after Bridesmaids, there’s a sense that she’s simply too talented to be contained. We can’t wait to see what she does next. —J.S.\n\nSuzanne Collins\n\nSuzanne Collins gave us one of the era’s biggest series with her blockbuster epic, The Hunger Games. But more than that, she gave us one of this decade’s best metaphors, envisioning a world in which pain and destruction has become part gruesome spectator sport, part reality-TV show pageant. The books came out in 2008, 2009, and 2010, but the first movie, which took the world of Collins’s imagination to the screen, premiered in 2012 and made its famous stars—Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne—even bigger celebrities. The films were extravagant science-fiction extravaganzas as much about class and social warfare as about violence and teen romance. The original books and movies have now concluded, but the themes are as resonant as ever. And Collins isn’t done with her dark, dystopian universe. Over the summer she announced a prequel to The Hunger Games, set 74 years before the narrative in the books begin; The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes will be out in May 2020. —M.K.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner\n\nIn June 2015, Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world for the first time. She announced her transition at the age of 65 on the cover of Vanity Fair, with a simple cover line: “Call me Caitlyn.” It’s rare to hear trans stories in pop culture in the first place—it’s even more rare at her level. Jenner has since become a symbol for a lot of things, privilege being one of them, but she’s a reminder that it’s never too late to live your truth. “If I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never ever did anything about it, I would be lying there saying, ‘You just blew your entire life,’” she told Vanity Fair in the interview accompanying her cover. “‘You never dealt with yourself,’ and I don’t want that to happen.” —B.C.\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie\n\nChimamanda Ngozi Adichie gave us an intellectually elegant framework to talk about feminism. Her 2012 Tedx talk, “We Should All Be Feminists,” sampled by Beyoncé in the 2013 hit “Flawless,” did what academics, writers, and politicians have struggled to do for decades: define feminism broadly and inclusively without watering it down. Wildest of all, this wasn’t her biggest success of the decade. She wrote Americanah, a serious contender for great American novel. She capped off the decade by publishing a feminist manifesto, made of suggestions about how to raise a feminist (“Teach her to reject likability” and “Talk to her about sex”) are just two of the great ones. The title of her famous talk was so iconic that Dior put it on a T-shirt. But the talk also contains the line, “We should all be angry. Anger has a long history of bringing about positive change.” Next decade, let’s see that on a T-shirt. —J.S.\n\nKarlie Kloss\n\nIn 2015, after three years of working with Victoria’s Secret, Karlie Kloss hung up her Angel wings. It was a surprising move to pass on such a lucrative deal, given that she was one of the brand’s highest-profile models. But, as Kloss later explained, \"I didn’t feel it was an image that was truly reflective of who I am and the kind of message I want to send to young women around the world about what it means to be beautiful.” Kloss continues to write her own narrative to positively impact the future, especially in her work with Kode With Klossy. The free coding camp gives young girls the opportunity to learn more about STEM. As Kloss says on the website, \"Now, more than ever, women need to have a seat at the table in shaping the technologies that are shaping our world.\" —T.A.\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nIf the aughts saw Lindsay Lohan’s star peak on the heels of Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, the ’10s were spent watching it fizzle. While we waited patiently for a comeback from 2007’s Georgia Rule (called “Lindsay Lohan's Gigli”) and box-office bomb I Know Who Killed Me, we were given Machete (I have no recollection of this film) and Liz & Dick. (The nicest review, from the Toronto Sun, called her performance “not the worst thing ever.”) In 2018 she opened a resort in Mykonos and picked up a vaguely European, vaguely Middle Eastern accent; the resort was at the center of her MTV reality show, Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club, which was canceled after one season. Lohan's 2019 was…unspectacular. She was a “guesser” on the first season of the Australian edition of Masked Singer and released “Xanax,” her first new song in 11 years—but only on Instagram TV. That’s the thing about Lohan: After a decade of ups and downs—okay, almost all downs—we continue to root for her. There’s always next decade. —K.F.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nSomething incredible happened during Katy Perry’s Super Bowl halftime performance in 2015. When she asked the crowd of more than 60,000 people to complete the lyrics to her song “California Gurls,” they succeeded with flying colors. “I know a place,” Perry sang before turning it over to the massive crowd, who belted in precise unison, “Where the grass is really greener.” The fact that seemingly everyone in the stadium knew the lyrics to “California Gurls” speaks to the song’s ubiquity. It was the first of five number one singles off Perry’s 2010 album, Teenage Dream—a stunning feat accomplished only by Michael Jackson for his 1987 record Bad. That alone earns Perry a spot on our list of the decade’s most influential women, but the singer did more than just break chart records. She was one of the driving forces behind the sound of pop radio in the 2010s, specifically the first five years: glossy, booming, sugary-sweet, and undeniably catchy. A teenage dream indeed. —C.R.\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nMillennials have been called The Anxiety Generation, with nearly 40 million people experiencing an anxiety disorder any given year. While this is obviously not a good stat, it has opened up the dialogue on mental health. Talking about it has become way more normalized, thanks in large part to women like Selena Gomez. The singer and actor has been open about both her mental and physical health, often turning to Instagram to discuss the anxiety and panic attacks she’s been dealing with as a result of managing her lupus. In 2017, after taking a break from the public eye, Gomez revealed that she had a kidney transplant by sharing the news on Instagram. Not only was this exemplary of Gomez’s radical transparency, but it became a meaningful example of the power of female friendship: Her close friend Francia Raisa donated her kidney. —B.C.\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\nInternational treasure Priyanka Chopra Jonas is a household name for a few reasons. She's an actor, producer, UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Miss World pageant winner, model, and the most famous \"J Sister\" after her multiday wedding nearly blew up the Internet. She made the transition from Bollywood to Hollywood and broke diversity barriers while she was at it, becoming the first South Asian woman to lead an American series, in ABC’s Quantico. And while some may be uncomfortable with this level of superstardom—with, oh, just about 42 million people watching her every move on Instagram and Twitter—Chopra Jonas navigates it with the kind of grace you'd expect from a seasoned royal (not unlike her actual best friend Meghan Markle). And like a real-life princess, she knows the importance of being a good role model. This year the 37-year-old was awarded Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award for her philanthropic work with UNICEF over the last decade, and for her dedication to children’s rights and education. —S.S.\n\nKate Middleton\n\nHard to believe now, but Kate Middleton—or the Duchess of Cambridge, as she’s now known—had an unflattering nickname by the British tabloid press at the start of the decade: Waity Katie. Of course, she would eventually become engaged to Prince William, kicking off a new era of the royal family. Their 2011 wedding was seen around the world with an estimated 72 million live streams on YouTube. Her stunning Alexander McQueen gown—designed by creative director Sarah Burton—also gave way to one of the most iconic partnerships of the decade, with Middleton turning to the designer for major life moments including the christenings of her three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis. Her fashion (rewears!), hair (bouncy blowouts!), and beauty impact (lip gloss mania!) aside, the duchess has carved her own path in the royal family as an advocate for mental health and children’s well-being. We can’t wait to see what she does next. —J.R.\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nThose who were surprised by Jennifer Lopez’s stellar performance in the movie Hustlers obviously aren’t familiar with her work. This is a woman who has proved her talent time and time again—particularly over the last decade. As always, Lopez’s contributions to the 2010s spanned medium and genre, from her 2011 dance-club smash “On the Floor” to her critically praised return to television Shades of Blue, and her beloved stint judging American Idol. Throw in a Las Vegas residency, the Hustlers Oscars buzz, and a 2020 Super Bowl halftime performance, and you have one of the decade’s most diverse catalogs. It’s hard to say what Lopez’s specific imprint on the 2010s is. Maybe hers is purposefully, beautifully un-specific—a display in glittering, awe-inspiring showmanship. Whatever the case, Lopez demonstrated, yet again, what an unprecedented, unmatched talent she is. Maybe she’ll finally win an Academy Award for it. —C.R.\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nTwenty-ten started off rocky for Sandra Bullock: In January she took home a Golden Globe for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy in 2009’s The Blind Side, a role that would earn her the Best Actress Academy Award that March. But just days after walking the Oscars carpet with her husband of four years, Jesse James, the Monster Garage host was moving out of their home amid claims he’d had multiple affairs. Bullock filed for divorce on April 23—and five days later announced she would proceed with plans to adopt a son, Louis. (She and her now ex had started the adoption process months earlier.) She’d close out the year as the world’s highest-paid female actor, a rank she’d earn again in 2014. The following year she started dating photographer Bryan Randall, who was by her side when she adopted daughter Laila in December. Throughout the personal highs and lows, America’s sweetheart worked steadily; four of her highest-grossing films (Minions, Gravity, The Heat, Ocean’s 8) premiered this decade, and she was the standout in 2018’s Bird Box, which saw 26 million views the week it dropped on Netflix. —K.F.\n\nEllen Pompeo\n\nGrey’s Anatomy has been on our screens for so long that Ellen Pompeo—who stars as the titular character Meredith Grey—could have deserved an inclusion on this list for that reason alone. The show airs in more than 220 countries worldwide and, even 16 seasons in, still commands television audiences. But it was her fight to be equally compensated and her unrelenting calling out of lack of diversity and inequality that’s marked her as one of the most influential, genuinely change-making actors of her generation. She has spoken openly about her frustration that male costar Patrick Dempsey was paid double her salary for the first three seasons of the show, recalling: “At one point, I asked for $5,000 more than him just on principle, because the show is Grey's Anatomy and I'm Meredith Grey. They wouldn't give it to me.\" She kept fighting, and now is one of the highest-paid stars on television—male or female—with a cool $20 million a year. We tip our hats. —N.P.\n\nEmilia Clarke\n\nGame of Thrones was arguably the biggest TV show of the decade, and Emilia Clarke, Mother of Killer Scenes, arguably its strongest female lead. As Danerys Targarean, Clarke tamed dragons and entire armies of men. She portrayed a rare type of female character: ambitious, ruthless, respected vulnerable, complicated—a woman who showed those who doubted her (cough, men) a leadership that demanded respect. Offscreen, Clarke brought us some of her character’s best traits IRL showing an incredible level of strength and vulnerability when she opened up about the brain aneurysms that almost killed her while she was filming the show. She’s since started a charity to help those suffering after a brain injury or stroke. —M.M.\n\nKelly Ripa\n\nIn 2011, Kelly Ripa said a tearful on-air goodbye to Regis Philbin, her Live! With Regis and Kelly cohost of over 10 years. (During that decade, she was credited with bringing “new life” and a younger audience to the show.) She would spend a year with a rotating lineup of cohosts (Rob Lowe, Kevin Jonas, and Mario Lopez, to name just a few), all while reminding us who the real star was before welcoming Michael Strahan to the gig full-time. When he left in 2016, she again carried the show through a second yearlong rotation of potential cohosts before Ryan Seacrest took over Strahan’s seat permanently in 2017. She may have found a cohost, but it’s Ripa who keeps the ship afloat: The show continues to dominate in audience, with an average of 5 million viewers per episode, as well as ratings in major markets. —K.F.\n\nTeresa Giudice\n\nIt all started with a table flip. Teresa Giudice began the 2010s as the breakout star of Real Housewives of New Jersey thanks to one very memorable dinner party that became a nationwide fascination. The success of that moment alone helped make Bravo’s Housewives franchise as a whole become the cultural juggernaut we know and love (or love to hate, depending on your outlook) today. Giudice was also one of the first reality stars to savvily use her fame to help her business ventures, which has included everything from cookbooks to a hair-care line to Bellini cocktails. And, of course, if you’ve read People once, then you know she’s also behind the biggest Housewives scandal of the decade: In 2014, Teresa and her husband, Joe, pleaded guilty to 41 counts of fraud. Teresa served 11 months in federal prison—an experience which, true to form, inspired two New York Times best-selling memoirs. —A.M.\n\nJameela Jamil\n\nIn a time when words like authenticity and unapologetic are so overused they’re starting to lose their meaning, Jameela Jamil is someone who embodies the true essence behind them. The actor and activist is fervent in supporting and uplifting women from all walks of life, advocating for intersectional feminism and body neutrality while fighting against abortion shaming and embracing ones back-fat at all times. From opening up about her battle with an eating disorder to sharing her story on attempted suicide, Jamil is an open book about her own struggles. And while she’s quick to call out brands for “toxic feminism” and unsolicited Photoshop or come for problematic men on Twitter with pointed clap-backs, she’s not afraid to admit her own shortcomings. The actor has spoken to her own “problematic thinking” in the past, and works to combat the toxicity of cancel culture, which is all too real in this day and age. —E.P.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nLet the 2010s henceforth be known as the decade Jennifer Aniston established herself as a pop-culture icon even bigger than Rachel Greene. After years of headlining some of our favorite romantic comedies, Aniston made a culture-shaking return to television with Apple TV+’s The Morning Show, of which she is both a star and producer. The Morning Show parallels so many of the issues that women are battling right now—sexism, ageism, the toxic patriarchal work culture that triggered the #MeToo movement—and Aniston (along with her costar and coproducer Reese Witherspoon) is calling the shots. When you take a step back and consider that Aniston, who turned 50 this year, is even more of a Hollywood icon than she was at the height of her Friends heyday, you begin to get the idea that maybe she, like so many women, hasn’t always gotten her due. But now? She’s in control of her own narrative. —M.M.\n\nKim Kardashian West\n\nBy 2010, when the fifth season of Keep Up With the Kardashians premiered, Kim Kardashian West had graduated from Paris Hilton’s sidekick to a reality star in her own right. And while she’d dedicate plenty of time to the show over the next 10 years, Kim spent much of the decade growing her brand—and her family—outside of it. Her marriage to Kris Humphries began and ended in 2011, but her next relationship with now husband Kanye West would see her through the rest of the decade. The two have welcomed four kids and celebrated five years of marriage in May. She launched her third, fourth, and fifth fragrances, and then KKW Beauty, KKW Fragrance, and the Skims shapewear line, released a book (2015’s Selfish), the Kim Kardashian: Hollywood app (it earned $1.6 million in the first five days), and her best-selling KIMOJI emoji pack. All while keeping her Instagram account consistently at the top of the most-followed list. (She's currently tied with kid sister Kylie and around 17 million followers ahead of Beyoncé.) Her cover of the winter 2014 issue of Paper did, as the cover line commanded, almost break the internet, bringing the site 15.9 million views in a day, compared with its 25,000 daily average. In her spare time, she advocated for prison reform, gun control, and the recognition of the Armenian genocide, all while quietly studying to pass the California bar exam. Keep up, indeed. —K.F."
