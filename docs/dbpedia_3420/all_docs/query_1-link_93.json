        "text": "The 2010s have been a wonderful and exciting time to be a film fan. While superhero films surged in popularity and Marvel and DC owned the box office, Star Wars was revived, streaming services became invested in and challenged movie distribution, and Netflix, Amazon, and independent studios like A24, Neon, and Annapurna allowed up-and-coming indie filmmakers to tell their stories with never seen before scale, budget, and accessibility for audiences. The status quo has been challenged, with a new generation of filmmakers of unparalleled diversity getting to express their voice and tell their stories. While Hollywood still has a lot of work to do towards equality, it has been encouraging to see more women and people of color being involved in every level of film production. Year after year there has been a slate of incredible movies, so of course, it is impossible to mention all of them in a decade retrospective. These are my personal 50 favorite films of the decade, the ones that have impacted me the most. I do not want to claim that these are the objectively best films or that a film is not great if it did not make this list. This list is just the ones that stood out to me when push came to shove.\n\nWhen I was brainstorming this list, the original list that I edited it down from was100 movies, and even then I felt like I was leaving off films that I truly love and couldn’t argue against being among the best of the decade. So to alleviate some of that guilt, there are honorable mentions of films or trends I loved. The action genre has returned with a glorious vengeance, with the jaw-dropping John Wick and Mission Impossible series leading the charge of a movement away from quick cuts and shakey-cam, instead prioritizing practical stunt-work and a shooting style that showcases the choreography instead of hiding it, with a focus on clarity and geography. The superhero genre has created a few standouts during its domination of the multiplexes this decade, such as Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse, Thor Ragnarok, Logan, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy films, and the Infinity Saga. Rian Johnson has proved to be one of the most interesting working genre filmmakers with his ability to utilize, subvert, and twist genre tropes and play with audience expectations with films like Looper and Star Wars: The Last Jedi (the best Star Wars film, fight me), and a film that missed this list by the skin of its teeth, the whodunnit murder-comedy Knives Out. Sci-fi has blended with action in plenty of unique ways such as in Edge of Tomorrow, the Planet of the Apes trilogy, Upgrade, and Inception. Horror has also had an incredible decade, with James Wan’s The Conjuring series and Andy Muchietti’s IT adaptations pioneering a thrilling style of mainstream, jump-scare oriented horror while indie horror has been dazzling in innovative and exciting ways with films like Midsommar, Annihilation, Raw, and Under the Skin. There are so many other films that almost made this list, including Little Women, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Django Unchained, Silence, The Wolf of Wall Street, Hell or High Water, You’re Next, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, A Ghost Story, A Star is Born, The Farewell, a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, The Handmaiden, Gone Girl, Phantom Thread, Blackkklansman, Inside Out, The Revenant, Moonrise Kingdom, I could go on. There are SO many great films from this decade. If you want to know what a more expansive list looks like, I have created a larger one that I intend to continue to update over on my Letterboxd: https://boxd.it/4bHUU . But when push came to shove, these are the ones I picked as my favorites.\n\n50. Creed (2015) dir. Ryan Coogler\n\nRyan Coogler breathed new life into the tired Rocky franchise in 2015 by showing the power of a new perspective and creative vision with Creed. This film takes the basic formula of the Rocky films and infuses Coogler’s energetic style into it to wonderful results (look no further than the one-take boxing match to see how effective it is). It is led by two brilliant performances, with Michael B. Jordan’s pure energy and charisma lending perfectly to a hungry, up-and-coming boxer while Sylvester Stallone proves himself still capable of a wonderful, introspective performance which is a side of him he hasn’t shown in years. This film has a wonderful way of examining nostalgia without being manipulative and pandering (looking at you J. J. Abrams) by truly earning those references and incorporating them in the story in an organic way. It examines its past as a franchise without being beholden to it, inspiring a new generation while reminding us why Rocky was such a wonderful and iconic film in the first place.\n\n49. The Guest (2014) dir. Adam Wingard\n\nAdam Wingard has been having so much fun this decade twisting genre fare on its head with films like You’re Next and Blair Witch, but neither of those quite compete with The Guest, a throwback slasher/’80s action hybrid inspired by the likes of Halloween and The Terminator. Creepy and thrilling, with a throwback synth soundtrack and a wonderfully charismatic but just-slightly-off performance by Dan Stevens, The Guest tells the story of a veteran who visits the family of someone he served with who had died. When invited to stay with the family for a bit, he begins to become more involved in their life and slowly begins to seem more suspicious. To give more away would be to give this film a disservice, but it is exciting, fun, and thoroughly entertaining and I cannot recommend it enough if you are a fan of ’80s cinema or genre filmmaking in general.\n\n48. The Shape of Water (2017) dir. Guillermo Del Toro\n\nGuillermo del Toro is a master of the monstrous and of the uniquely human, and his horror/romance hybrid The Shape of Water is one of the most interesting examinations of and twists on classic horror iconography and American identity in recent times. Stunning visually and fantastic from a technical perspective, the film takes the premise of The Creature from the Black Lagoon and interprets it as Guillermo himself did as a child: as a story of boundless love across differences. Led by a masterclass performance by Sally Hawkins and supported by a delightful score from Alexandre Desplat, it is Guillermo’s best work in years and an example of all that cinema can offer: thrilling, emotional, humorous, and a way of bridging the gap between those who are different than us by showing the importance of empathy, love, and solidarity.\n\n47. The Favourite (2018) dir. Yorgos Lanthimos\n\nThe Favourite is the best film yet from twisted and deadpan director Yorgos Lanthimos, and also his most accessible. The story of two women who find themselves at odds over their pursuit of the affection of Queen Anne of England, and the Queen’s dilemma over who she should both trust and love, The Favourite is both a riotous pitch-black dry comedy and a nuanced character drama at the same time. The script is efficient and layered, with every single joke or carefully chosen offhand comment providing insight into these characters, their desires, and motivations (or at least the facades that they are putting forth), foreshadowing future events or laying the groundwork for important revelations later. And it does all this right under your nose by distracting you with the sharp and hysterical dialogue so that by the time you realize the significance of certain lines, it is likely too late. The witty, deadpan comedy of the script is only enhanced through the delivery, as Lanthimos uses distorted ultra-wide “fish-eye” lenses, unexpected outbursts of slow motion, and a very off-kilter and dissonant score to highlight the artificiality of the aristocratic society and the distorted perspective of the selfish characters. The acting here is obscenely good as well, with Olivia Coleman, Rachael Weisz, and Emma Stone delivering some of the best performances in years. Each of them utterly sells every moment of deception, manipulation, and betrayal. Far from being a posh and boring period piece like it appears, The Favourite is hysterically funny, darkly twisted, and taps into the pain and the desire to be loved that drives all of us.\n\n46. The Tree of Life (2011) dir. Terrence Malick\n\nTerrence Malick’s career is full of movies that feel like visual poems, interested in mood and emotion instead of plot and character. His most ambitious film, The Tree of Life, delivers the peak of that style. It is a film interested in the biggest questions that face humanity, tackling grand questions about God, morality, the afterlife, and humanity’s purpose with the grandest and smallest scale. It goes from creation itself and the evolution of life on earth to a small story of growing up, reckoning with a harsh and unforgiving father, and reflecting on the loss of innocence and loved ones that come with growing up. Emmanuel Lubezki’s breathtaking handheld cinematography, bathed in natural light, captures the grandness of scale and emotion of memory that fits so well with the themes of the story. From the grand creation sequence to the quiet moments of whispering unasked questions and longing desire, this film succeeds on all fronts and makes for one of the most unique and wonderful viewing experiences I have ever had.\n\n45. The Nice Guys (2016) dir. Shane Black\n\nNobody does a buddy cop comedy like Shane Black, and The Nice Guys is no exception. After years honing his writing skills with action/comedy classics like Lethal Weapon, Predator, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and then making a creative but divisive big-budget debut with Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys is a return to form for Black as a writer and director. With a compelling central mystery worthy of old film noir, a brilliant script with some of the most clever comedic writing of the decade (that simultaneously never loses track of the plot or characters), and the pitch-perfect comedic timing of one of the best working actors in Ryan Gosling, The Nice Guys fires on all cylinders. There is never a dull or wasted moment, and Gosling and Russell Crowe’s chemistry on-screen is delightful. Like the best film noir, each answer creates two more questions and the film constantly juggles a dozen plot elements and distracts you with the humor so well that you don’t see where it is going until the last puzzle piece falls into place. It is a rare example of a perfect script and is executed with precision. And on top of it all, it is so. freaking. funny. Seriously, Ryan Gosling gives the best comedic performance of the decade in this film. Go see it.\n\n44. Blue Ruin (2014) dir. Jeremy Saulnier\n\nJeremy Saulnier burst onto the film scene with a bloody vengeance in his 2014 anti-revenge thriller Blue Ruin. He immediately stood out from all the other directors telling similar stories due to the focus of his film and its depiction of revenge. Revenge, according to Saulnier’s film, is not sweet, but messy and unfulfilling. This results in 1) a far more thematically interesting examination of the toll and futility of revenge and 2) an incredibly tense exercise in genre filmmaking that turns every mundane element you expect to be glossed over into an opportunity for tension and unease. We follow a mysterious loner known as Dwight (played with incredible awkward physicality and emotional vulnerability by Macon Blair) as he attempts to exact revenge on a man that had killed his parents. Unpredictable and thrilling at every turn, Blue Ruin is an excellent example of what happens when a filmmaker with a unique vision and style takes a crack at an age-old story.\n\n43. What We Do in the Shadows (2014) dir. Taika Waititi\n\nDelightful and quirky New Zealand writer-director Taiki Waititi is one of the most unique voices in the comedy realm, demonstrated perfectly by What We Do in the Shadows. A delightful mockumentary that follows 4 vampires living in modern times and sharing a flat and just trying to have a good life, the film finds opportunities for humor in the most domestic, mundane things. Twisting horror lore into humor at every opportunity, this film is beyond funny, with a dry deadpan wit and perfectly timed delivery that leads to an endlessly rewatchable and quotable film. Each performance is dry and witty, perfectly balancing self-aware camp without ever tipping into full parody and losing its empathy for the characters. Waititi hits my funny bone as few other directors can, and What We Do in the Shadows is his best yet in terms of creativity and humor.\n\n42. If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) dir. Barry Jenkins\n\nIf Beale Street Could Talk is a beautiful visual poem about love and overcoming obstacles and adversity. Director Barry Jenkins does a fantastic job here using his camera to replicate the feeling of being in love; the feeling of a memory. It floats around these characters, lingering on a face in the way that we memorize certain facial expressions of those we love or swirling around the characters in moments of triumph or joy in the way that we feel the world begin to spin in those moments of transcendence. Jenkins’s command of his camera and the unbelievably emotional and naturalistic performances from his entire cast creates powerful close-ups that are unrivaled by the work of any other film this year. The score by Jenkins frequent collaborator Nicholas Britell conjures up so much bittersweet emotion with just a sound, and the script adapting James Baldwin’s book manages to deliver a nuanced look at unconditional love while also discussing topics such as racial injustice, corruption in the criminal justice system, and poverty.\n\n41. 21 Jump Street (2012) dir. Phil Lord & Christoper Miller\n\nWho would have thought that a modern remake of an ’80s TV show could be so damn funny? 21 Jump Street is hysterical, utilizing the comedic talents of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum to the best they have ever been while using the absurdist improv sensibilities of master comedy directors Lord and Miller to deliver an unexpected and creative comedic masterpiece. An all-star comedic supporting cast (including a pre-fame Brie Larson, Nick Offerman, and a career-best comedic performance from Ice Cube) sells every moment and gag. It is wacky, unexpected, perfectly edited, smartly written, and most importantly, hilarious at every turn.\n\n40. Prisoners (2013) dir. Denis Villeneuve\n\nThis movie is what catapulted Denis Villeneuve into the mainstream, and for good reason. An immediately gripping plot involving kidnapped children, Prisoners is a classic Villeneuve film: interrogating our values and unquestioned beliefs about morality, religion, and what “good people” are capable of when they are pushed to the extreme. Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are both spellbinding as the leads (a father of the kidnapped girl and the detective in charge of the case). A stunning and tense procedural thriller that dips into horror territory in all the right ways, Prisoners is a haunting watch and one that rewards analysis and multiple viewings.\n\n39. Us (2019) dir. Jordan Peele\n\nJordan Peele’s sophomore effort proves him even more of a cinematic force to be reckoned in this horror renaissance. Us is ambitious as hell, extremely layered and nuanced story full of symbolism, as well as a fantastic piece of thrilling genre filmmaking. It finds the perfect balance between pure thrills and intellectual depth underneath. Every performance here is amazing but especially Lupita Nyong’o as Adelaide/Red. Her performance is honestly unbelievable, as she dominates every moment of screen time and elevates the film as a whole so much. She sells every moment of physicality in both characters (and finding subtle ways to nonverbally convey the darker hidden secrets and motivations of each, such as the differences in their dancing and movements, and how Adelaide becomes more and more animalistic as she kills each tether as she reverts to her older self and hinting at the revelations to come later in the film). Beyond the acting, this film is terrifying. Both house invasion sequences are among the tensest set-pieces that the genre has had in a long time. The craftsmanship needed to create those perfect sequences is incredibly impressive, but what stands out to me the most Jordan Peele’s eye for horrifying imagery. It is unbelievable, every single frame of this movie is like a gorgeous painting but also filled with an insane amount of dread because of how he uses shadows, color, and focus (one particular split diopter shot towards the end with a close-up of Red’s face with Adelaide slowly approaching in the background will be forever seared into my brain).\n\nThe score and music choices also really stood out to me. This is only the second full score of Michael Abels (the first being Get Out), but it is beyond impressive. The unrelenting strings and piano work make many of these scenes so much tenser, and the use of tonally incongruent music to create tension and humor worked so well, proving Peele’s background in comedy makes him a master of managing tone. The clever hints that he sneaks in about what is to come show off such attention to detail. The symbolism here is so layered, such as the class metaphors of the tethers being the lowest class, discarded by modern America who experiences wonderful lives at the expense of those below them. When they rise up and violently revolt, the richest (Kitty and Josh’s family) are soft and easily dispatched because of the lack of hardship they have faced (as well as their indulgent bourgeois lifestyles, dependent on technology and alcohol), but the middle-class family that has had to work for what they have fought back. The commentary on status, privilege, and how the main thing that makes the main family different from their shadows is the environment they were raised in makes the film endlessly interesting to dissect thematically. There is so much here about the current state of America, our violent past as a country, class warfare, cycles of oppression, and how sometimes the scariest monster is us.\n\n38. Arrival (2016) dir. Denis Villeneuve\n\nArrival is a film in the long tradition of using science fiction to explore the issues of our current society, exploring issues of communication, human connection, and time itself. Amy Adams has always been an underappreciated actor, and this is perhaps the finest performance she has given in her career. Director Denis Villeneuve’s evocative imagery and ability to imbue a shot with emotion is shown to its fullest effect here, with each shot so well framed that it could be a painting while Max Richter’s brilliant score adds so much to the film (I challenge anyone to watch the scene where the “On the Nature of Daylight” motif plays and not cry). This is a film that draws us in with the mysteries of its plot, but ultimately it is the themes and emotion at its core is what makes Arrival special.\n\n37. 12 Years a Slave (2013) dir. Steve McQueen\n\nFew films have ever tackled the brutality and horror of slavery quite like 12 Years a Slave. As it tells the true and deeply disturbing story of Solomon Northup as he was kidnapped and sold into slavery, 12 Years a Slave is brutally honest and unflinching in its depiction. Where other films would sensationalize or sentimentalize it, director Steve McQueen refuses to look away from every moment by utilizing long, single takes and wide shots to trap the audience in the discomfort and forcing us to reckon with the violence of our pasts. Chiwetel Ejiofor is brilliantly emotive, communicating all the frustrations and fears of his character nonverbally, while Michael Fassbender is terrifying in the way he embodies the animalistic rage and hate that humanity is capable of. The stacked supporting cast (with the likes of Lupita Nyong’o, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, and more) makes the most of every moment. It is a cliche to describe a film as “important,” but the way that this film tells this story, a reckoning with the legacy of violence and racism in America, is truly important and timeless.\n\n36. Suspiria (2018) dir. Luca Guadagnino\n\nGod this movie is such a trip and I adored all of it. Luca Guadagnino takes the bare bones of original Suspiria and weaves almost an entirely new story with it. Director Luca Guadagnino uses his dreamlike filmmaking style to blur the line between reality and fiction, performance and action, dream and desire, through his intensely subjective camerawork which only intensifies as the film delves further into madness. The camera floats around the room like a ghost voyeuristically stalking the characters, the 180-degree rule is broken to mess with the audience and disorient us, and a sense of geography is purposefully never developed to make the dance academy feel like a labyrinth where something could be lurking around every corner. The directing and cinematography here work so well to unsettle you, as the editing is purposefully disjointed with harsh smash cuts that make the dance scenes as tense as any horror film\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a divided Berlin, the fear of a resurgence of fascism plays out in both the city itself and the dance academy. As the revolutionary youth revolt against the entrenched hierarchy of their elders, the stains of grief and guilt and cyclical violence run deep through every character here and are felt societally. The culpability of individual choice is paramount here as each character reckons with either the mistakes of their past or the terrifying choices that present themselves now. Though divisive, if you are on board for the strange and disturbing ride, you will find Suspiria to be well worth your time.\n\n35. Uncut Gems (2019) dir. Benny & Josh Safdie\n\nIf you want to get your nerves absolutely fried, check out Uncut Gems. A white-knuckle, anxiety attack of a crime thriller from the Safdie brothers which follows a career-best Adam Sandler as a gem dealing, hustling, gambling addict named Howard who owes money all over town and his quest to finally come out on top. Pure chaos told with the most careful precision, Uncut Gems proves that the devil is in the details as it builds tension through 1000 little choices. There are often 4 or 5 parallel conversations and plot threads occurring at once, and the film lets you stew in it thanks to brilliant sound design that heightens the anxiety through overstimulation, claustrophobic camerawork that leaves you feeling as trapped as the characters do, and rapid-fire editing. The brilliance is how much attention-to-detail is put into crafting this story and how well it pays off in the grand scheme. Little moments that appear to be one-off interactions are constantly being re-incorporated, even bit characters feel fully fleshed out with their own interior stories and living and breathing connections to the world thanks to precise writing and excellent acting choices. As our main character makes terrible decisions left and right then goes about his everyday life ignoring the consequences, the audience is left with the stress of knowing that the consequences could be waiting around every corner. Adam Sandler is riveting as Howard, imbuing him with a sense of charisma and showmanship appropriate for a world-class bullshitter but also a deep sense of vulnerability. While you cannot help but empathize with him, understanding the depth of his addiction and desperately hoping he succeeds, we also understand how pathetic and selfish he is at every moment. The beauty of Uncut Gems is how every element comes together to make the end of the story feel like an inevitability, but is so thrilling, darkly funny, and consistently entertaining that you are screaming at the screen hoping that it ends differently.\n\n34. It Follows (2014) dir. David Robert Marshall\n\nIt Follows is a throwback to ’70s and ’80s horror in all of the best ways. With a creeping synth score by Disasterpiece that sets the tone for the ominous and inescapable fear to follow, it takes a high brow approach to horror that could only work on film: the monster is invisible to everyone except the person it is hunting, and it can look like anyone. This concept itself creates such an opportunity for paranoia and fear that the film creates incredibly well thanks to rich visual storytelling. It has you constantly looking in the background for threats and never trusting anything at first glance, just like the headspace the characters are in. Led by a terrifically emotive and vulnerable performance by Maika Monroe, It Follows is creepy from minute one and consistently terrifying.\n\n33. I Saw the Devil (2010) dir. Kim Jee-Woon\n\nKim Jee-Woon is one of the best genre filmmakers and his take on the serial killer horror is riveting and disturbing in equal measure. The film follows agent Kim Soo-Hyeon (Byung Hun Lee) as he pursues a serial killer (portrayed with an animalistic rage by Min-Sik Choi) who murdered Kim’s wife. Whole films have been made about the cat and mouse game between detective and killer, but this film is far more interested in what happens next. Agent Kim finds his prey rather quickly but is more interested in making him suffer than in bringing him to justice. This quickly spirals into a battle of savagery between the two, that catches everything they love in the crossfire. Twisted and violent, full of creepy imagery and tension, I Saw the Devil is the perfect cinematic adaptation of the famous Nietzsche quote “beware that, when fighting monsters, you do not become a monster… for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you.”\n\n32. Popstar: Never Stop, Never Stopping (2016) dir. Akiva Schaffer & Jorma Taccone\n\nBrought to life by the creative and comedic genius’ behind Lonely Island, Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping takes the mockumentary format and uses it to brutally satirize musical documentaries and the music industry as a whole. Utilizing the comedic talent of arguably my favorite comedian, Andy Samberg, a deep roster of frequent collaborators with Lonely Island including other famous comedic stars, the most talented of a generation of SNL alums, and a stacked roster of cameos from real musicians, Popstar is hysterical. This movie is so packed to the brim with jokes, visual gags, references, and wordplay that you will miss half of them on the first viewing, making it funnier and funnier every time you rewatch it. The creative team uses their background in musical comedy to truly sell the musical aspect of the film with a soundtrack that is consistently funny but also catchy and fun in its own right. Check out Popstar, not enough people saw this in the theater and I hope it gains a reputation as a cult comedy classic in the years to come.\n\n31. The Babadook (2014) dir. Jennifer Kent\n\nAuteur director Jennifer Kent blew me away with her debut horror film The Babadook, which takes horror-as-metaphor and pushes it to an even further extreme. A woman still recovering from her husband’s traumatic death is struggling to raise her troubled son when she finds a particularly disturbing book on his shelf describing a monster called the Babadook. Once she reads it to her son, she begins seeing the monster everywhere. The Babadook seeps into her life and infests it, just as her depression has and with that, and this movie does the “monster as a metaphor” idea better than pretty much any other horror movie I have ever seen. From the stark color palate which parallels how the world feels like it becomes sapped of all color and life when you are depressed, to the brilliant production design that has you looking in the background for the Babadook constantly, this movie does a wonderful job with the small details that completely immerse you in the character’s point of view and their world. Essie Davis does an incredible job as her acting essentially carries the film, and many moments from this film continue to haunt me to this day.\n\n30. Sicario (2015) dir. Denis Villeneuve\n\nAnother tightly wound thriller from Villeneuve that is more interested in using the plot to explore the morality of the characters and our society as a whole, Sicario follows an FBI agent (an emotionally vulnerable but tough Emily Blunt) who is recruited to be part of an inter-agency task force to take down a drug lord. The film is immaculately crafted, stunning to look at (shot by the greatest living cinematographer, Roger Deakins), and incredibly tense. But even better than the craft and enjoyment of the film is the subtle way it weaves its thematic critique of the war on drugs/war on terror. It takes us on the journey of someone experiencing the horrors of this world for the first time, who is asked to be an accomplice to horrible actions in the name of greater justice and just like the main character, the audience is left asking themselves “is this too far? At what point do we become the bad guys?” The moral of Sicario is clear without ever sacrificing entertainment value: there is no wading into that world without becoming morally compromised.\n\n29. Paterson (2016) dir. Jim Jarmusch\n\nNobody understands the beauty of the smalls triumphs of life like Jim Jarmusch, who uses Paterson to tell the simple story of a bus driver named Paterson, played with quiet intelligence and vulnerability by Adam Driver. Every day Paterson drives his bus route, writes some poetry, spends time with his girlfriend (an artist who wants to open a cupcake shop), walks his dog, and seems content with this. Paterson is a simple film, there are no plot twists or high levels of dramatic tension, but the beauty is in that very simplicity. It is a film about the small setbacks and victories that make up the vast majority of our everyday lives. Things are not life and death, but they are a challenge and often our ingrained habits contain a great deal of interior emotional significance, which this film captures with such grace and compassion. It is a wholesome and emotional slice of life that encourages the viewer to reflect on their own lives and habits to find the beauty in the small things.\n\n28. Lady Bird (2017) dir. Greta Gerwig\n\nWhat makes the films of Greta Gerwig stand out is the small moments of humanity. There are so many small characterization moments that other films would deem unnecessary and cut that Gerwig carefully chooses to keep, and they breathe so much life and humanity into every character, regardless of the amount of screentime they have. Lady Bird is amazing in how it uses that characterization to provide uncharacteristic depth and emotion to a coming-of-age comedy. With naturalistic but insightful performances from every single performer, it is a prime example of how to make every character feel three dimensional and fleshed out, which is crucial to the film’s thesis: that we are all unique and have our interior struggles, and because of that empathy and kindness are always important despite any frustrations we have with each other. Gerwig’s style isn’t flashy, but any level of examination of the film shows how precisely constructed it is, how well-edited, and the power of her directorial style. Coming-of-age films have had a good decade (as shown by the multitude of them on this list) but Lady Bird stands out as a highlight of the genre, and of cinema as a whole.\n\n27. Ex Machina (2015) dir. Alex Garland\n\nAlex Garland’s contained and evocative sci-fi horror Ex Machina dives into our relationship with technology, society, and what constitutes the self. When computer programmer Caleb (Domhall Gleeson) wins a raffle at his tech company and is brought out to a secluded compound of the company founder Nathan (Oscar Isaac), he is shocked to discover Nathan has built a robot that is on the edge of becoming human in many regards. As Caleb interrogates the robot, named Ava (a fantastic Alicia Vikander who captures the awe and terror of experiencing the world for the first time), the line between programmed responses and free will blurs and Caleb begins to question whether the systems of control that are in place are also pulling his strings. Creepy and claustrophobic while also retaining a thoughtful intelligence, Ex Machina provides genre thrills and deep philosophical questions in equal measure and rewards an attentive viewer with plenty of details and small mysteries.\n\n26. Marriage Story (2019) dir. Noah Baumbach\n\nNoah Baumbach has made a career of telling uniquely human stories, dialogue-driven character studies that eschew plot for exploring the flaws and fears of their lead characters. Marriage Story is his greatest achievement of this style as he pulls from his own experience with divorce. His script and direction (which uses lengthy shots and breathtaking contrasted silhouettes of their faces to reinforce their emotional distance) breathe life and nuance to this deeply melancholic look at a collapsing marriage. Every moment is one of subtlety, of things left unsaid, of old wounds being scratched at, and most importantly the undying love that these two characters have for each other buried under a mountain of toxicity and anger. Both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are sublime in this film, and remarkably restrained, considering this film avoids (with one exception) the usual Hollywood screaming match fights. Instead, their emotions are shoved down, the verbal knives the throw are disguised as compliments or hidden in a glance. It feels like the best kind of stage play, where the meaning is hidden in the smallest of gestures, of body language, and blocking of the characters. The true beauty of this film is that the whole situation is both no one’s fault and both of their faults. Miscommunication, frustration, and unfulfilled needs abound on both sides and the film makes the right choices to never take sides. Instead, it recognizes the deep flaws that are core to both people and the chilling truth that no one can hurt you as bad as the ones you love. It is beautifully humanistic, realistic, and compassionate in its depiction of two people who will always love each other but simply are not healthy for each other.\n\n25. Boyhood (2014) dir. Richard Linklater\n\nRichard Linklater is a filmmaker fascinated by time and growing up. He has made multiple coming-of-age films set in past decades (Dazed and Confused, Everybody Wants Some) and set a trilogy of films each 9 years apart with the Before Trilogy. These two interests collide in Boyhood, a film that made waves by being filmed by the same actors, director, and crew over twelve years as it tells the story of Mason, a boy growing into a man and experiencing parental divorce and remarriage, love, loss, and a struggle for personal identity. This film could have gone wrong in so many ways. Actors could have wanted to drop out, the child actors could have outgrown their acting talent, it could have lacked a cohesive story when it all came together, etc. Yet, despite all the risks Linklater took, Boyhood pays off. The cast all retains incredible authentic chemistry during every segment, as they literally grow older together. The film manages to find a wonderful existential through-line about becoming your own person and finding yourself. More than anything, the film is constantly entertaining and heartfelt, with natural humor from its cast, and attention to the small details which makes every moment feel decisive and life-changing, just like it does when you are growing up.\n\n24. The Irishman (2019) dir. Martin Scorsese\n\nA melancholic dissection of the very genre that made him a household name, Martin Scorsese uses The Irishman to dive deep into the moral rot and corruption that is inherent to the mobster lifestyle. He deliberately paces this lengthy journey, taking the time to naturally show the effects of being a mobster in everything from the smallest moments to the longest of decades. The film begins like many of Scorsese’s other films do, perfectly riding the line of showing the enticing aspects of being a mobster without glamorizing it. However, the subtlest of differences in storytelling choices differentiate the way that The Irishman depicts it. The Scorsese touch in this film is one of an older man, more interesting in exposing the emotional destruction of his characters and in quietly contemplating their actions than in taking the audience on a thrill ride. For example, the downfall of Henry Hill in Goodfellas had everything to do with excess, and the filmmaking reflects that. The editing ramps up, The Rolling Stones play, and Henry Hill’s voiceover increases in energy as he is running around town increasingly paranoid and attempting to evade his pursuers. The difference between that and The Irishman is night and day. There are lengthy sequences leading up to violence, like in every Scorsese film, but they are not interested in producing tension as they are in showcasing the dread of the inevitability. These sequences play out often without music, with editing that pulls us further into the scene through longer shot length and silence from the characters. The film gives the characters time to ruminate in silence about their actions, options, and consequences which generates an overwhelming sense of melancholy for the viewer, since from our god’s eye view we see the violence and alienation as nothing but inevitable for Frank and his cohorts.\n\nThe Irishman is filmmaking at it’s finest, and an example of Scorsese’s storytelling at it’s finest. Every technical element is the most effective choice for the story the film is telling. Rodrigo Prieto’s cinematography is subtle and unflashy, focusing on conveying information through quiet uses of space and shot length. Thelma Schoonmaker shows off a masterclass of editing, both in terms of making this 209-minute marathon feel well-paced and never boring, and in terms of constantly incorporating each scene for a greater purpose. Moments that on the surface appear to just be entertaining filler are always wrapped back into the grander narrative and their true significance isn’t revealed until the end of the film. This is Frank Sheeran’s story after all, that he is telling back to us and every moment he shares has some personal significance to him (and uses the unreliable narrator trope to provide fantastic insights into the way that he deceives himself about his actions). Every performance is subtle and brilliant, with Deniro bringing a level of nuance in his quiet expressiveness that he hasn’t shown in years that harkens back to his best work in films like Raging Bull, Deer Hunter, or Taxi Driver. Pacino’s manic energy is perfectly harnessed in a role like Jimmy Hoffa. But the real standout in terms of acting is Joe Pesci. Often known for his high energy, loud performances, Pesci instead lowers his voice, limits his expressiveness, and lets his restraint generate an unbelievable level of menace and danger. Every word he says feels like it could kill. Each element of this film comes together to create a perfect cinematic experience. Consistently entertaining and funny while never losing focus on the grander picture, The Irishman is concerned with communicating one truth: the life of a mobster is not glamorous like it appears. It is deeply sad, it alienates you from everyone in your life. It compromises you. Eventually, you will grow old and die alone after being able to do nothing but reminisce about your former glory and past mistakes. This film is brutal in how it communicates this, particularly in the last hour. But it is all the better for these bold choices and has instantly one of the biggest highlights in Martin Scorsese’s legendary cinematic career.\n\n23. The Wailing (2016) dir. Na Hong-Jin\n\nIf I had to choose a word to describe Na Hong-Jin’s South Korean horror masterclass The Wailing, it would be bone-chilling. Pulling from Christian mythology and local superstition to create a tale of paranoia and possession, The Wailing excels at disturbing imagery and a creeping atmosphere. The film follows a small-town cop in South Korea who is drawn into a mystery involving a mysterious man who lives outside of town that people claim is a devil-worshipper. This mystery devolves into an unusual spiritual horror, as the detective must discern good from evil as his daughter is possessed and more players appear. When the full scale of the events is revealed, the fatalism of the film takes your breath away. The Wailing is a film about the darkest forces at play in the world, and how (if they exist) how hopelessly outclassed humans are. It is incredibly creepy, with terrific scares and an eye for evocative imagery that will be seared into your mind for long after you watch it. It is a must-watch for horror fans.\n\n22. La La Land (2016) dir. Damian Chazelle\n\nLa La Land is classic Hollywood cinema: a tale of ambition and love and the way those two things come into conflict. It takes iconic Hollywood musical iconography and the sincerity of love stories of old but puts a uniquely modern twist on it by showing the honest and brutally emotional truth behind the old Hollywood stories. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have unbelievable chemistry and are electrifying to watch, selling every moment of their romance. Chazelle has a stunning eye for visuals as the film’s use of color and cinematography harkens back to the old Hollywood musicals that inspired the film. With a sweeping emotional soundtrack and a constant focus on the character’s emotional state, La La Land is an evocative and unparalleled emotional experience, with a final shot that will stay with you for years.\n\n21. First Reformed (2018) dir. Paul Schrader\n\n“Will God forgive us?”\n\nOne of the things that impress me the most about this film is that it is packed to the brim with thematic subtext about loneliness, extremism, and isolation, but fully trusts its audience to unpack these themes themselves without the need to hand-hold. Schrader’s writing is as good as ever, playing with his familiar tropes of an unreliable narrator and a loss of sanity to interesting results, but what surprises me even more here is how he uses the minimalistic film-making style of the film to further communicate these themes and the subjective perspective of the character. I love how the camera remains very still throughout the entire film, using lengthy static shots to physically separate Hawke from every other character in the film, further reinforcing his lack of human connection and isolation. This pays off in the rare scenes where Reverend Toller gets to experience an authentic human connection, where the style of cinematography shifts to visually represent the transcendent emotions that he feels. The use of formal stylistic choices to reinforce the unreliable narrator’s twisted perspective is super impressive, and I cannot give Schrader enough praise for that.\n\nThe film grounds all of its intellectual musings with a truly phenomenal (and even career-best) lead performance by Ethan Hawke as Reverend Toller, a priest struggling with a crisis of faith due to the perceived silence of god and a crisis of conscience due to the destruction of the environment. Hawke is one of the best working actors today and manages to say more with a single look in this film than most actors do an entire monologue. The moments where the camera pulls in close to his (or any other characters) face really shows off his expressiveness, but the physical performance he gives also perfectly displays the awkward stiltedness of the character. Like one of its characters says, life is a mix of hope and despair. This film is like that. Even in the darkest nights of the soul, there is humor, love, compassion, and a chance for hope. Likewise, this film is existential to its core while also being unflinchingly compassionate for its characters.\n\n20. Whiplash (2014) dir. Damian Chazelle\n\nWhiplash is a film about an ambitious jazz drummer in a premier music school and his relationship with his challenging but brilliant mentor, but it feels like a horror movie. This film is raw intensity and anxiety expressed through music, as Andrew (a breakout Miles Teller) sacrifices, throws others under the bus, and self destructs in order to achieve greatness and the approval of his abusive mentor Fletcher, played with a seething intensity and rage by a career-best J. K. Simmons. Up-and-coming auteur Damian Chazelle took the world by storm with this first feature, a thriller with some of the best, rapid-fire stressful editing that makes every musical performance feel as terrifying as a bank robbery. This film asks you what you are willing to sacrifice for greatness, for a legacy, then it pushes you beyond the breaking point to make you second guess your answer. The final drum solo performance in this film is a closing scene for the history books that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave your nerves frayed.\n\n19. Get Out (2017) dir. Jordan Peele\n\nThere is something to be said about a film that is infinitely accessible yet also infinitely complex and layered. So many of the great works of entertainment and cinema are like that and Get Out is no exception. Jordan Peele’s screenplay for Get Out is so impressive because of how much thematic depth he squeezes into every moment of the film. While on the surface the film is an exceptionally made horror/thriller, every moment a crowd-pleaser, there is so much going on underneath. Commentary on slavery, the commodification of black culture, the loss of agency that comes with seeing your own story stripped away and told by someone else, subtle racism and elitism among those who claim to be woke for their own benefit, there is so much going on here. In the hands of another filmmaker, it would buckle under the weight of its themes, become preachy, lose focus trying to tell too much or beat the audience over the head. But Peele never does. The film is so accessible, so entertaining, and so perfect at hitting every emotional beat of humor and horror that you soak in every bit of thematic depth without even realizing it. It takes exceptional craftmanship to handle it, but Peele handles every moment with humanity, heart, creativity, and intelligence. Get Out has already become a classic, and with good reason. It is a perfect example of moviemaking at its most effective: thrilling, hilarious, insightful, singular in its voice but universal in its message. The craziest thing about Get Out though? Jordan Peele makes it all look so easy and effortless.\n\n18. Mission Impossible: Fallout (2018) dir. Christopher McQuarrie\n\nMission Impossible: Fallout is one of the best action films of all time, so I do not really know how to add to the discussion of the film, so I will just stick to describing what I love about it. To put it simply, this is the perfect culmination of a thousand different talents working at the top of their game, and the result is extraordinary. Christopher Mcquarrie is one of the people I want to shout out here. He has such an eye for action sequences, as he shoots with an intent focus on geography and clarity, while also consistently delivering some amazing and beautiful imagery. As a result, we always know where everyone and everything is in relation to each other and know exactly what is going, even in the quickest edited moments. This focus on geography and clarity allows him and his frequent editor Eddie Hamilton to edit as the rhythm and flow of the scene dictate it, making the sequences feel both natural and kinetic as everything crescendos from one tension-inducing moment to the next. The only directors who can achieve this level of kineticism and rhythm in their action sequences are George Miller and Gareth Evans, and Mcquarrie competes neck and neck with those all-time great talents.\n\nComplimenting the directing and editing is a truly fantastic score. The Mission Impossible series has had consistently good scores, but Lorne Balfe manages to provide the best yet. I love his electronic variation of the MI theme, and it perfectly accentuates and builds the tension of the sequences. One other thing I wanted to note was how perfect the pacing was in this film. If there was one flaw in previous Mission Impossible films, it is that they have always peaked in the midsection of the film. Not so here. During every action sequence I kept thinking to myself “okay, this is where it peaks.” But every time it just kept getting better, ratcheting up the tension, stakes, and adrenaline from one set-piece to the next until the final moments where you feel like you cannot breathe.\n\n17. The Witch (2016) dir. Robert Eggers\n\nRobert Egger’s The Witch might not be a typical horror film, but that does not stop it from being as bone-chilling and dread-filled of a viewing experience as the best that that genre has to offer. The Witch defies most attempts at genre classification, instead choosing to pull from multiple genres to create a thematically intertwined and deeply satisfying cinematic experience. Egger’s pulls imagery and cinematic techniques from horror while utilizing the realism (in dialogue, set design, and lighting) of a period drama to ground the audience in the experience, effectively trapping them in the terror. Meanwhile, the script works on a thematic level like a fatalistic tragedy of Biblical proportions, as the trauma that this Puritan family endures is controlled from the very beginning by an outside force looking to break them. The devil knows just what buttons to push, and with such powerful forces pulling the strings of these character’s motivations and fears it leaves the audience feeling even more helpless as we watch these events unfold.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the debate around “is The Witch even a horror film?” is pointless, because it is exactly that careful blending of genres that makes the film so effective, and so horrifying. Egger’s confidence in his filmmaking vision and the absolute control he asserts over every element of the film (evident in listening to interviews with him) immediately makes him a filmmaker to be watched going forward. His careful cinematography, shot composition, limited POV, and lighting all create so much dread throughout the film. That dread is amplified by the realism created through the immaculate attention to detail that would make a historical biopic jealous, and a precise script that delivers tension and deep thematic impact with unbelievable efficiency. The Witch is genre filmmaking at its best and most confident.\n\n16. Before Midnight (2013) dir. Richard Linklater\n\nThe conclusion of Richard Linklater’s brilliant Before Trilogy, Before Midnight, continues the story of lovers Jesse and Celine. Each film in the Before Trilogy takes place over 24 hours and each film is set 9 years apart, following the characters as their relationship progresses. Before Midnight finds them finally married with children, facing down their age, career struggles and the realities of a long-term relationship after their two chance encounters in the previous films. Like the other films in the trilogy, Before Midnight is deeply existential in the way we are trapped in real-time with these two characters, experiencing these small day-long vignettes of their lives, exploring the way that our small daily choices dictate who we are as a person, and conversely the way that our life experiences weigh on our everyday decisions. The real magic of these films is the way that the chemistry between Ethan Hawke’s Jesse and Julie Delphy’s Celine is portrayed. Both Hawke and Delphy co-wrote each film with Linklater, to ensure their creative voice in the depiction of their characters. Their friendship in real life adds so much to the authenticity of the love that these characters show. The careful precision of the writing, their spellbinding and authentic performances, and Linklater’s subtle naturalistic style of filming firmly ground the viewer in the reality of their relationship in each film. Midnight is special in how it unflinchingly depicts both the beautiful and ugly sides of long-term love. When someone loves you that much, they can make your world seem brighter but they can also hurt you like no one else can. Even healthy relationships can slowly build their sore subjects and resentments, and at the end of the day, love is far more of an act you have to choose to do every day than a fleeting feeling. The authenticity and honesty of this depiction are what makes Before Midnight ring so true. From their quiet moments of affection to the harrowing 30-minute argument in a hotel room to the cautious reassurance of hope, Before Midnight is a shockingly look at the reality of romance and a masterwork of the naturalistic, character-oriented filmmaking that Linklater is known for.\n\n15. The Raid: Redemption (2011) dir. Gareth Evans\n\nGareth Evan’s The Raid: Redemption is arguably the most influential action film of the 2010s, following a SWAT team that raids a crime lords high rise only to find themselves outnumbered and needing to fight their way out. A cult hit that slowly gained popularity after its release, it was a grand statement against the shakey-cam, quickly edited style of action film that had gained popularity thanks to its inexpensive nature and thanks to the series that popularized it (and perhaps the only films that did that style well), the Bourne series. Instead of that style, The Raid was frenetic and full of energy, but had a constant focus on clarity of action and geography, letting the natural talent of the martial artists and the physicality of their performances along with the complexity of the choreography take center stage. It takes a book from the style of Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan, but infuses the editing and camerawork with an energy that makes the scenes even more exciting, as the edits flow perfectly with the choreography of the fights. Evans elevates the action by finding small ways to humanize and build his characters without a word of dialogue through careful visual storytelling, which allows the film to be non-stop action from the word go. It makes incredible use of the environment of the high rise, making it feel claustrophobic and endlessly massive in equal measure. This film is so good that it skyrocketed Evans to fame and success, along with the incredibly talented stars Iko Uwais, Joe Taslim, and Yayan Ruhian. I challenge you to find a better or more intense hand-to-hand battle from this decade than the 2v1 climax of this film. What a thrill-ride.\n\n14. The Social Network (2010) dir. David Fincher\n\nDavid Fincher is a master of visual storytelling and no one writes fast, zingy dialogue like Aaron Sorkin. The Social Network combines both with a project that feels like the definitive film of the 2010s, addressing social media and the controversial rise of one of the most powerful figures in American society. Full of the pitch-perfect performances that we are used to in a Fincher film, The Social Network is crafted with such careful precision that there is not a single wasted word of dialogue, music cue, shot, or glance. It probes into the psyche of the insecurity and longing that it takes to make a man like Zuckerberg, and its razor-sharp dissection of his rise to prominence is filled with the righteous indignation that defines the best of Sorkin’s work. Jesse Eisenberg has never been better, and this perfect amalgamation of talent across this production makes The Social Network an electrifying, relevant, and timeless watch.\n\n13. Parasite (2019) dir. Bong Joon-ho\n\nBong Joon-ho is one of the most delightful and interesting filmmakers of our time with the way he has used various forms of genre filmmaking (such as monster movies in The Host, murder mysteries in Memories of Murder, dystopian action in Snowpiercer, etc.) to dissect modern society, capitalism, and the ethical problems of our time. In this regard (and in every regard for that matter), Parasite is his masterpiece. His sights are aimed directly at the evils and alienation of capitalism and the modern class system, and his analysis takes no prisoners. The truly impressive thing is that he manages to take these insights and core themes of the story and weave them into the film in an entirely approachable, entertaining, and even subtle way. So much of the storytelling and thematic power comes from the visual language of the film and the way it contrasts the life of the rich to the poor. A rainstorm is presented as calm and relaxing for the rich family, but we slowly pan down to the lower levels of the city and see the devastation that such an event can be to the poor. The careful juxtaposition of privilege and comfort with tragedy and a struggle for survival get the film’s point across without a word of dialogue.\n\nCrafted with the utmost precision, Parasite is a masterclass in film construction from every perspective. It perfectly juggles tones as it constantly switches tones between humor and tension, satire and thrills. It is exceptionally well-edited, constantly introducing new information a mile-a-minute that comes into play later without the film ever tipping its hand. Every moment is setting up something else that comes into play later. While the film is constantly unpredictable with many twists and turns, everything is perfectly set up and established so that when you think back on the film, you don’t see how it could have ended every other way. With its brilliant visual language, gorgeous framing and lighting, and consistently gorgeous shot composition it is reminiscent of the best films of Hitchcock or Spielberg, with every cinematography and editing choice being the best and most efficient choice for the given situation. Every performance in the cast is excellent, making the most of even the smallest moments. A unique and complete cinematic vision in every respect, Parasite is extremely of the times and a wild, entertaining ride from beginning to end.\n\n12. The Master (2012) dir. Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson has been one of the most exciting American auteur directors since the 1990s, with each film growing more mature, experimental, and insightful about the complex emotional creatures that are the characters in his films. The Master is one of his most difficult films, but also one of the most interesting and rewarding of his career. It follows a drunken, emotionally stunted man-child veteran named Freddie (depicted brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix), who inadvertently crosses paths with Lancaster Dodd (an effortlessly charismatic turn by the late Phillip Seymore Hoffman), an enigmatic cult leader who promises his followers transcendence from their earthly woes and traumas. Freddie is awed by Dodd’s psychological insights and quickly becomes his right-hand man in this cult (which closely resembles Scientology while maintaining a safe legal ambiguity). The Master is a very subtle film, leisurely paced and quiet in its emotional complexity. Many scenes play out in long, static camera takes that let the actors, two of the greatest of our generation, play off of one another and communicate the themes and complexities of their relationship nonverbally. The Master takes multiple viewings to decipher, even after seeing it three times I still have questions and take away new things every time I see it. Such powerhouse performances, subtle filmmaking, and quiet, thoughtful themes of freedom, control, and manipulation make this film one well worth exploring, and a highlight of PTA’s tremendous career.\n\n11. Blade Runner 2049 (2017) dir. Denis Villeneuve\n\nVilleneuve, perhaps the most prolific and consistent director of this decade (if you couldn’t tell by the presence of a whopping 4 films from him on this list), brought us an unbelievable feat in 2017. He made a sequel to cult-favorite, ahead of its time art-house sci-fi noir film Blade Runner 35 years after the fact, and somehow made it even better than the original. Picking up the same themes as the original Blade Runner of what it means to be human, the struggle for human connection in a post-capitalist industrial hellscape, and free will vs determinism and running with those themes with even greater scale and ambition. With absolutely breathtaking visuals by Roger Deakins that takes the evocative and iconic imagery of the original and evolving it organically, Blade Runner 2049 combines art-house sensibilities and storytelling with a cyberpunk action noir style in a way that should not work but does unbelievably well. Ryan Gosling delivering the best performance of his career (after having a hell of a decade in his own right with The Nice Guys, La La Land, Drive, The Big Short, The Place Beyond the Pines, Only God Forgives, and First Man), and Hans Zimmer crafts a droning but beautiful score remixing the themes from the original. Among the best sci-fi films ever made and the highlight of an amazing decade for its director and cast, Blade Runner 2049 is exceptional on every front.\n\n10. The Lighthouse (2019) dir. Robert Eggers\n\nA nautical nightmare steeped in the mythos of Greek legend and H. P. Lovecraft in equal measure, The Lighthouse is tense and darkly hilarious throughout. It belongs to one of my favorite styles of film: dialogue-driven films that take place in a confined location with a small cast where the tension comes from the sharpness of the dialogue, the power of the performances, and the claustrophobia of how the location is filmed. Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe deliver career-best powerhouse performances that swing for the fences. Every moment of their performances are theatrical and explosive, from the lengthy monologues full of damnation to the distrustful and paranoid glances, they truly command the screen. They create a sense of almost anti-chemistry, where the palpable tension between the two of them is accentuated by the differences in their performances. Pattinson shines as he gets to showcase the full range of emotions from horror to paranoia, and he rises to every occasion with energy and physical commitment to the role. But Dafoe honestly steals the show as this parody-level seaman, with very stereotype and characteristic are dialed up to 11 to such entertaining results as an obsessed and disturbed Captain Ahab-like wicky who steals every single moment as the perfect counterpoint to Pattinson. On top of all of this, the cinematography is gorgeous, with the naturalistic lighting casting long shadows mimicking the larger-than-life personas the characters are presenting to each other to hide their own weaknesses or to gain the upper hand in this power struggle. Every shot feels like an impressionistic painting with the exaggerated lighting and claustrophobic aspect ratio causing the imagery to feel even more nightmarish and haunting. The way the score blends in the diegetic blasting fog horn with the brilliant score that melds the sweeping gothic score of an old monster movie with the tense and raging strings of a slasher to create a truly uncomfortable soundscape.\n\nEvery moment in The Lighthouse feels like a confident and unique cinematic vision. Each choice fully commits to the weirdness, the sexuality, the slapstick comedy, and the surreal horror of the story. Egger’s insistence on adherence to period detail in the dialogue, costumes, and set design pulls the audience into the atmosphere from minute one. The razor-sharp dialogue (hidden between the thickest of New England accents) bounces back and forth like the finest Howard Hawks film. Furthering Egger’s distrust of societal norms, The Lighthouse delves into the consequences of capitalism as it literally works its characters into insanity where their very identities and sense of selves are stripped away. They are offered hope of compensation, future change, or even salvation within the unforgiving (or holy, depending on the interpretation) gaze of the lighthouse. But none of these things save them from the depths of their rage, toxic masculinity, and paranoia within the situation and system they are stuck in.\n\n9. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) dir. Wes Anderson\n\nWes Anderson’s films have always been quirky, idiosyncratic, doll-like, and full of dry wit. The Grand Budapest Hotel takes this style to a further degree than any of his films before and it stands as his triumphant effort. Pushing his production design to the extreme with the dollhouse-like interiors of the titular hotel, his directorial style is even more pronounced and artificial with his trademark center-framed symmetrical compositions and storybook feel to the whole film. With his trademark all-star cast of regulars, this film is a whimsical delight full of deeply dry humor and is easily Wes’s funniest film. What makes it stand out from all of his other great films is the beautiful way he juxtaposes tragedy and humor. From minute one, the film shows a dying world that has surpassed its heyday. Every line in the film is tinged with the deep sadness of mortality and fate, which makes this not only Anderson’s funniest film but his most emotionally affecting.\n\n8. Moonlight (2016) dir. Barry Jenkins\n\nWhen watching Moonlight, I am reminded of a quote from Roger Ebert, that films are like empathy machines that make us see things from the perspective of those who are different than us, to walk a mile in their shoes and spend two hours seeing the world through their eyes. Moonlight tells the story of the life of a young black man, Chiron, as he struggles with accepting his own identity and sexuality. Director Barry Jenkins blew all of our collective minds with his first feature film, which he decides to tell through three vignettes that take place during defining moments during Chiron’s life. Thanks to the brilliant casting and performances by all 3 iterations of Chiron, it believably feels like one character throughout the film. The use of the vignettes explores the idea of defining moments in our lives and explores the way that small actions can shape our entire future. The film lives and breathes empathy and compassion, as Jenkins captures every moment with a flowing and dreamlike camera that feels like a distant memory and a haunting score by Nicholas Britell accentuates every moment with beautiful melancholy. Moonlight will stand the test of time as one of the greatest directorial debuts and as a testament to the power of perspective and compassion in cinema.\n\n7. Her (2013) dir. Spike Jonze\n\nSometimes films are simply ahead of their time, and that is the case with Her. This transcends being a romance film by using low-key sci-fi elements to explore the nature of romantic connection, as well as how technology and modern life isolates us as people. Spike Jonze uses very subtle world-building through the use of color grading and production design to create a wholely organic world that feels like it could be an extension of (or future of) our own. Every moment feels all too human and relatable, even though the story is one that none of us have experienced. Joaquin Phoenix’s lead performance as Theodore in this movie is vulnerable to its core, finding a way to communicate the character’s tenderness, loneliness, and fear with tremendous subtlety considering for most of the movie he is essentially acting alone and talking to his phone. Scarlett Johannson also delivers a masterclass performance as she voices Samantha the AI, infusing every word and vocal inflection with the boundless meaning that comes with someone learning about the world and experiencing emotions for the first time with only her vocal performance. Every moment of Her is tinged with the beauty and melancholy of doomed romance, from the insecurity of attachment to the sad but beautiful realization that you both have grown beyond the relationship. The film is a shining example of how science fiction can be used to heighten other genres of film. The result is heartbreaking, subtle, funny, and insightful into the experience of love.\n\n6. Hereditary (2018) dir. Ari Aster\n\nHorror is trauma, and there has been no horror film this decade that hammers that point home better (or emotionally traumatized me) quite like Ari Aster’s debut feature Hereditary. This film is impressive on a thousand fronts. The restrained approach to scaring the audience through careful attention to detail and slow-burning dread, further emphasized by the constant themes of fatalism and lack of free will for the characters through dialogue and the recurring motif of the dollhouses, the way that the film carefully knows how to limit the perspective of the audience to that of the characters through cinematography to build dread and increase the effectiveness of the scares when they do happen, I could go on about this film for ages. Toni Collette is jaw-dropping in the scale and nuance of her performance, selling every moment and every type of emotion from the subtle family tension, the anxiety, grief, anger. The energy and power of her performance is among the best of the decade, and it truly anchors the rest of the film. Aster instantly became one of the most exciting filmmakers of our time, using his formalist control over the camera and confident sense of tone and pace to emphasize the atmospheric discomfort and tension between the characters, keeping us in that moment for far longer than most filmmakers would dare, trusting that the audience is along for the ride of discomfort and terror (look no further than a particularly horrifying scene involving a car accident to show the power of his restraint and style). I for one am here for it and believe that all these things make Hereditary the most effective and powerful horror film of the decade.\n\n5. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) dir. Joel Coen & Ethan Coen\n\nThe Coen Brothers are my favorite filmmakers. They have been making riveting films for three decades now, with a filmography full of such masterpieces as No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Tho, and A Serious Man. Yet with Inside Llewyn Davis, they show even more introspection and emotion than hey had in any film before, or since. Llewyn (played by a career-best emotive and melancholic Oscar Isaac) is a folk musician trying to make it in the ’60s, and the film follows his artistic pursuits and personal struggles. But the film is about more than that. It is about depression and the spiraling negative effect that loss has on people, as well as the toll and grind of artistic success. While the usual Coen Brothers humor is present, this film is more somber. It addresses the cyclical nature of life and the amount of struggle that positive change takes. After all the toil that we see Llewyn struggle through, his final musical performance of “Fare Thee Well” never fails to bring me to tears.\n\n4. Shame (2011) dir. Steve McQueen\n\nNo film from this decade tackles the pain and alienation of addiction more than Steve McQueen’s Shame. It follows Michael Fassbender as Brandon, a sex addict trying to maintain control over his urges and live a functional lifestyle. When his sister Sissy (played with emotional power by Carey Mulligan) comes to visit, throwing off his routine and bringing up memories of the past he tries not to remember. Shame is a very quiet film, letting the expressiveness of Fassbender’s mesmerizing performance tell most of the story while McQueen’s brilliant visual storytelling sets the mood and leaves the details implied for the attentive viewer. As Brandon’s life spirals out of control, this film is brutally emotional without ever being manipulative, preferring the emotional honesty of its depiction instead of schmaltzy sentimentality or tearjerking. It is powerful and spot-on in its understanding of how trauma is the root core of addiction. While not an easy film to watch by any means, Shame is one of the most impactful films I have ever seen.\n\n3. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) dir. George Miller\n\nThis film is the best that action cinema has to offer. Mindblowing in its scope, vision, and manic energy, Mad Max: Fury Road is pure adrenaline from the first minute and it never lets up. George Miller’s pitch-perfect visual storytelling and editing allow for all of this pure chaos to be easy to follow despite multiple parallel threads of action that follow dozens of characters in huge scale setpieces. This is a perfect action from an editing perspective, keeping up high octane energy in every scene and creating a rhythm to the action that perfectly flows with the story. Despite rapid cutting, every moment is clear and easy to understand. Gorgeous visual effects and an all-time great score compliment this masterwork of a film, while Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy imbue their characters with such heart and emotion despite having barely any dialogue thanks to amazing physical performances. Deeply heartfelt and political without needing a word of dialogue to convey it, Fury Road has it all and will be an example of the heights that genre filmmaking can reach for decades to come.\n\n2. The World’s End (2013) dir. Edgar Wright\n\nEdgar Wright is one of the most exciting and energetic filmmakers, and The World’s End, the conclusion to his thematically connected “Cornetto Trilogy” is his crowning achievement. It follows a group of 5 childhood best friends who return to their hometown to do a pub crawl they failed to do as teens, only to find out that almost everyone has been replaced by lifelike robots. It takes the same razor-sharp satirical approach to sci-fi films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers that Hot Fuzz took to buddy-cop films and Shaun of the Dead did to zombie films, but with an even more clear eye for character and empathetic pathos for each character despite their deep flaws. Its insights into addiction and messages of undying love and friendship prove to be incredibly affecting, while the lightning-quick jokes and terrific action make this a fantastic and entertaining experience. No one in the film industry edits a film as effectively as Edgar Wright does, using his editing to make jokes, provide insight into characters, and keep the plot rolling at a supersonic pace. This film flies by at a mile-a-minute, while somehow making room for every emotional character moment time to breathe and (like every Wright film) loads every single scene with piles of symbolism and information for an attentive viewer. Humanistic and hilarious, The World’s End is a masterpiece and I am not sure Wright will ever be able to top it.\n\nCall Me By Your Name (2017) dir. Luca Guadagnino\n\nWow, we finally get to this film. No other movie this decade has left an impact on me quite like Call Me By Your Name. Luca Guadagnino adapts Andre Aciman’s novel with a careful touch and precise attention to detail. Focusing on the beauty and impact of first love and of exploring your own identity, Call Me By Your Name subverts so many filmic tropes. There is no antagonist here, no bigoted disapproving relatives, only time itself is the enemy. Elio and Oliver only have a short time together, and the film takes its time with their falling in love and subtle flirtation, making us feel the limited time they have and imbuing every moment with precious meaning and emotionality. Timothee Chalamet is transcendent and heartwrenching in the physicality of his performance, while Armie Hammer delivers introspective emotion in every glance and word. This film is perfect in every aspect, demonstrating the power of cinema as a medium. It is so good, in fact, that I wrote a massive essay diving into the power of the film, Guagagnino’s subtle cinematography and visual storytelling, the performances, and themes. Instead of writing more about it here, I will just link to that: https://medium.com/@danielhassall/the-beauty-and-artistry-of-call-me-by-your-name-18267c6af8b1 for all these reasons and more, Call Me By Your Name is my favorite film of the 2010s."
