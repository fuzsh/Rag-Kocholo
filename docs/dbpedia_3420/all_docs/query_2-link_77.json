        "text": "Over 60 films came into this year’s Sundance Film Festival looking for buyers, but many of the key players on the indie film market already had movies premiering in the festival, with many of those among the most commercial and star-studded movies making their debuts.\n\nLast year’s market was slow, especially for documentaries, but this year’s festival market was nothing but robust in 2024. We’re tracking everything that already has a home and will update this space throughout the month with every sale that comes in.\n\n“Good One”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDirector: India Donaldson\n\nBuyer: Metrograph Pictures\n\nCast: Lily Collias, James Le Gros, Danny McCarthy\n\nRelease Plans: Theatrical in Summer 2024\n\nBuzz: India Donaldson’s “Good One” will be the first title acquired by Metrograph Pictures, as the company known for its film restorations and SVOD platform is now getting into theatrical distribution. And they picked a good one too. IndieWire called Donaldson’s film a “fantastically assured debut” that has a harrowing turn as it follows a 17-year-old girl on a backpacking trip through the woods with her dad and his oldest friend. The men’s brotherly friendship slowly turns to them airing years-long grievances, and the teenager’s parental bond with her dad is tested. It’s been compared to “The Loneliest Planet” or the films of Debra Granik, and reviews have suggested Collias could be a breakout star.\n\n“Between the Temples”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nDirector: Nathan Silver\n\nBuyer: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nCast: Jason Schwartzman, Carol Kane, Dolly de Leon, Caroline Aaron, Robert Smigel, Madeline Weinstein, Matthew Shear\n\nBuzz: It took some time to close, but a deal for Nathan Silver’s “Between the Temples” was bound to happen sooner rather than later. The film was one of our favorites out of Sundance and represented a step up for Silver after years of filmmaking but never making it to the biggest stage in Park City. Jason Schwartzman continued a hot streak of performances as a 40-something cantor losing his voice and possibly his faith in this very Jewish story that’s full of “non-Kosher gags,” as IndieWire’s review put it. The film explores complexities of belief and connection in the relationship Schwartzman’s character forms when his old grade school music teacher (Carol Kane) re-enters his life as an adult bat mitzvah student. Sony Pictures Classics — with its second acquisition after “Kneecap” — picked up the worldwide rights and will now back it before it heads into its international premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival in the Panorama section. The film is produced by Tim Headington, Theresa Steele Page, and Nate Kamiya on behalf of Ley Line Entertainment, Adam Kersh of Fusion Entertainment, and Taylor Hess.\n\n“Will & Harper”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Josh Greenbaum\n\nBuzz: Netflix strikes again. The streamer has closed a deal for the worldwide rights to “Will & Harper” following its Eccles premiere last week (The New York Times first reported Netflix was in exclusive negotiations). With Will Ferrell attached, this one was destined to be big and would’ve been appealing to NBCUni buyers like Peacock or Focus Features given the number of “Saturday Night Live” stars and clips it includes, to Searchlight because David Greenbaum is the older brother to director Josh Greenbaum, or to literally any other streamer that wants to put Ferrell and his best friend Harper Steele on “The Tonight Show” to promote the doc. But with Netflix attached — the streamer’s fourth documentary pickup and fifth overall acquisition — the film’s messages about friendship and trans representation can find the widest possible audience in reaching a Middle America crowd like the places Ferrell and Steele visit. “We are thrilled about how audiences received the movie with open arms at Sundance. It’s a movie about the power of friendship and acceptance, that we hope can help shift the culture, and so we are excited to have a partner in Netflix that has the ability to reach the largest possible audience worldwide,” the filmmakers said in a statement.\n\n“Daughters”\n\nSection: U.S. Documentary\n\nDirector: Angela Patton, Natalie Rae\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nBuzz: “Daughters,” which won the Audience Award out of the U.S. Documentary competition at Sundance, is the latest nonfiction acquisition from Netflix. The film about a father-daughter dance that follows four girls reuniting with their incarcerated fathers earned raves at the festival and figures to be an Oscar contender in the Best Documentary race next year. Netflix has also bought “Skywalkers,” and “Ibelin,” plus Midnight entry “It’s What’s Inside.”\n\n“Dìdi“\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nBuyer: Focus Features\n\nDirector: Sean Wang\n\nCast: Izaac Wang, Joan Chen, Shirley Chen, Chang Li Hua\n\nRelease Plans: July 26 in theaters\n\nBuzz: Sean Wang’s coming-of-age film “Dìdi” was a hit out of the U.S. Dramatic competition, winning both the Audience Award for the section and a Special Jury Prize for the film’s ensemble. Wang directed, wrote, and produced the comedy-drama starring Izaac Wang as a 13-year-old Taiwanese-American boy grappling with the pangs of adolescence in his last summer before high school in Southern California. “Dìdi” was warmly reviewed out of the festival in-person and on the home viewing platform, placing at #4 on IndieWire’s Critics’ Poll of the best films at Sundance while earning spots on the Best Director and Best First Film rankings. The sale also caps off a big month for Wang, who not just won the Audience Award but also was nominated for an Oscar for his upcoming Disney+ short documentary film “Nǎi Nai and Wài Pó.”\n\n“Thelma”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: Magnolia\n\nDirector: Josh Margolin\n\nCast: June Squibb, Richard Roundtree, Fred Hechinger, Parker Posey, Clark Gregg, Malcolm McDowell\n\nRelease Plans: Wide theatrical release\n\nBuzz: 94-year-old June Squibb does all her own stunts for the charming and crowd pleasing action comedy “Thelma,” which Magnolia picked up North American rights to in a competitive situation that included several other potential buyers. The film is based on first-time director and writer Josh Margolin’s real-life grandmother and is inspired by imagining what his own grandmother would do in a “Mission: Impossible” scenario, with Squibb’s character “Thelma” the victim of a phone scam, only to track down the scammers while slipping under the noses of her children. The film is also likely the final on-screen role for “Shaft” actor Richard Roundtree.\n\n“Skywalkers: A Love Story”\n\nSection: U.S. Documentary\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jeff Zimbalist\n\nBuzz: Hype for this documentary was as sky-high as its subjects. Jeff Zimbalist’s “Skywalkers” is a cross between “Man on Wire” and “Fire of Love” that showcases the love story of two law-breaking, death-defying Russian stuntpeople who sneak to the tallest skyscrapers and traverse the tippy tops, sharing photos of their escapades. While we thought it could be a prime target of Nat Geo, the commercial appeal was too great for Netflix to pass up, as the streamer has been the most aggressive buyer at the festival so far.\n\n“Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: Warner Bros. Discovery\n\nDirectors: Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui\n\nBuzz: A major studio like Warner Bros. Discovery is hardly your typical buyer out of Sundance, but the pairing of Superman and WBD’s DC makes perfect sense. IndieWire has confirmed that WBD has closed its deal to acquire the documentary about Christopher Reeve, the late “Superman” actor. Multiple media reports have pegged the sale at $15 million. It’s unclear specifically how the film will be released, but the documentary will be released in collaboration with WBD’s DC Studios, Warner Bros. Motion Pictures, HBO, CNN Films, and Max, which all jointly sought out the project for a theatrical and home release strategy. DC Studios is currently prepping James Gunn’s “Superman: Legacy” reboot. Directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui in “Super/Man” tell Reeve’s story non-linearly, finding the parallels in his life both before and after his accident that left him paralyzed from the shoulders down. The film features interviews with his three adult children, finds archival footage of his time in Juilliard, and explores his deep friendship with Robin Williams. The film is produced by Words+Pictures, Passion Pictures and Misfits Entertainment in association with Jenco Films.\n\n“My Old Ass”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: Amazon MGM\n\nDirector: Megan Park\n\nCast: Maisy Stella, Maddie Ziegler, Aubrey Plaza, Kerrice Brooks, Percy Hynes White\n\nRelease Plans: Theatrical Release followed by streaming debut on Amazon Prime Video\n\nBuzz: Amazon MGM is in final negotiations to acquire “My Old Ass,” the coming-of-age comedy about a young woman who meets her future self and is advised not to fall in love. Margot Robbie’s LuckyChap produced the film, and the sale re-teams Robbie’s company with Amazon after they together partnered on 2023’s “Saltburn.” Indian Paintbrush also produced and financed. Park’s debut feature film “The Fallout” won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award from SXSW in 2021, and “My Old Ass” currently has a 100 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, in addition to receiving a standing ovation following its premiere. Deadline reported the sale was for $15 million and that other buyers such as Netflix, Focus Features, and Searchlight were all in on the movie.\n\n“Ghostlight”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: IFC Films and Sapan Studio\n\nDirector: Alex Thompson and Kelly O’Sullivan\n\nCast: Keith Kupferer, Tara Mallen, Katherine Mallen Kupferer, Dolly De Leon\n\nRelease Plans: Theatrical in 2024\n\nBuzz: The follow-up film from the filmmakers behind “Saint Frances” was one of the sleeper hits at Sundance this year, a heartwarming dramedy starring a real-life family of actors that manages to blend fact and fiction. “Ghostlight” centers on Keith Kupferer as Dan, a melancholic construction worker who unexpectedly joins a local theater’s production of “Romeo and Juliet.” When the drama onstage starts to mirror his own life, he and his family are forced to address a recent tragedy. IndieWire’s review called it a “charming, funny, and very human exploration of the bonds that alter the course of our lives…finding humor and heart at every turn.”\n\n“Presence”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nBuyer: Neon\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nCast: Lucy Liu, Chris Sullivan, Callina Liang, Julia Fox, Eddy Maday, West Mulholland\n\nBuzz: Neon has won the distribution rights to Steven Soderbergh’s “Presence,” beating out numerous other bidders in a big worldwide deal for the film in a highly competitive situation, IndieWire has confirmed. Soderbergh made his return to Sundance 35 years after “sex, lies, and videotape” put himself and Sundance on the map. “Presence” is another Soderbergh experiment and is filmed entirely from the perspective of a ghost observing a dysfunctional family as they move into a new house during the family’s best and worst moments.\n\n“It’s What’s Inside”\n\nSection: Midnight\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Greg Jardin\n\nCast: Brittany O’Grady, James Morosini, Alycia Debnam-Carey, Devon Terrell, Gavin Leatherwood, Reina Hardesty, Nina Bloomgarden, David Thompson\n\nBuzz: Greg Jardin formerly worked on some Netflix ad campaigns, and the distributor picked up his buzzy debut feature for the biggest deal out of the festival so far, with the streamer picking it up for $17 million, a source told IndieWire. The film is a genre-bending, head-spinning, colorful affair about a pre-wedding party that descends into an existential nightmare when an estranged friend shows up with a mysterious suitcase, but the fun of the premise is best left to be discovered. The film generated huge buzz among audiences in its Midnight premiere. ““On behalf of the cast, crew, and entire production team, we are absolutely thrilled that ‘It’s What’s Inside’ landed at Netflix. Their commitment to championing bold and groundbreaking filmmakers like Greg Jardin remains unparalleled,” said producer William Rosenfeld of Such, which financed and oversaw production.\n\n“A Real Pain”\n\nSection: U.S. Dramatic\n\nBuyer: Searchlight Pictures\n\nDirector: Jesse Eisenberg\n\nCast: Jesse Eisenberg, Kieran Culkin, Will Sharpe, Jennifer Grey, Kurt Egyiawan, Liza Sadovy, Daniel Oreskes\n\nRelease Plans: Theatrically in 2024\n\nBuzz: Jesse Eisenberg’s sophomore feature starring Kieran Culkin was generating a lot of buzz from buyers, and Searchlight won out in a deal that Deadline first reported reached $10 million for a theatrical play later this year. The film follows mismatched cousins David and Benji who reunite for a tour through Poland to honor their beloved grandmother and tour Holocaust-era history. The film was produced by Dave McCary, Ali Herting, Emma Stone for Fruit Tree, Jennifer Semler, and Ewa Puszczynska. Executive producers are Ryan Heller of Topic Studios, Jennifer Westin, Michael Bloom, and Kevin Kelly.\n\n“Ibelin”\n\nSection: World Cinema Documentary Competition\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Benjamin Ree\n\nBuzz: The latest film from the director of “The Painter and the Thief,” which won the Jury Prize at Sundance in 2020, tells the story of Mats Steen, a Norwegian gamer, who died of a degenerative muscular disease at the age of 25. Though his parents believed he lived a lonely and isolated life, what they didn’t know is he actually had a rich life as a character named Ibelin inside the online game “World of Warcraft.” An entire community of fellow gamers who knew him started reaching out to his parents to describe the impact he had on their lives, and the film uses animation to re-enact some of Steen’s blogs, gameplay, and interviews with his WoW cohorts.\n\n“Kneecap”\n\nSection: NEXT\n\nBuyer: Sony Pictures Classics\n\nDirector: Rich Peppiatt\n\nCast: Michael Fassbender, Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, DJ Provaí, Josie Walker, Fionnuala Flaherty, Jessica Reynolds, Adam Best and Simone Kirby\n\nBuzz: The first major sale out of Sundance was for one of the wilder, more rambunctious entries in the festival, the fictionalized biopic about the Irish rap trio Kneecap which also stars Michael Fassbender. Rappers Móglaí Bap, Mo Chara, and Dj Provaí all play themselves in the film, which is set in Belfast post-Troubles and sees the Irish-language crew try to make their mark and break through the establishment. IndieWire’s favorable review called it a “delightfully spiky story” of a group that became a recent media sensation. Peppiatt, making his debut feature, previously filmed music videos for Kneecap. The group even played a riotous set at the film’s after party here in Park City and brought along an Irish police van as part of a stunt. Sony Pictures Classics also acquired Latin America, Eastern Europe, Turkey, and the Middle East rights in addition to North American rights.\n\n“The Greatest Night in Pop”\n\nSection: Special Screening\n\nBuyer: Netflix\n\nDirector: Bao Nguyen\n\nRelease Plans: January 29 on Netflix\n\nBuzz: Announced after the initial Sundance lineup was released and with Netflix unveiling the trailer shortly thereafter, “The Greatest Night in Pop” flashes back to January 25, 1985, when Lionel Richie brought together a group of musicians from around the globe to record “We Are the World.” The film shows how he worked the phones and called in favors to get everyone together for the track. Bao Nguyen, who came to Sundance with the Bruce Lee doc “Be Water,” directs the doc feature playing as part of the Beyond Film programming.\n\nFilms Arriving with Distribution\n\n“A Different Man”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: A24\n\nDirector: Aaron Schimberg\n\nCast: Sebastian Stan, Renate Reinsve, Adam Pierson\n\nBuzz: “The Worst Person in the World” star Renate Reinsve gives her first English-language performance alongside Sebastian Stan in this surrealist psychological thriller about an aspiring actor who undergoes a surgery for a new face, only to lose out on the role of his dreams.\n\n“The American Society of Magical Negroes”\n\nSection: Premieres\n\nDistributor: Focus Features\n\nDirector: Kobi Libii\n\nRelease: March 22\n\nCast: Justice Smith, David Alan Grier, An-Li Bogan, Drew Tarver, Rupert Friend, Nicole Byer\n\nBuzz: This fantasy satire from actor-turned-director Kobi Libii stars Justice Smith as a young man invited into a secret society of Black people set on making life easier for white folks.\n\n“Frida”\n\nSection: U.S. Documentary\n\nDistributor: Amazon Studios\n\nDirector: Carla Gutierrez\n\nBuzz: Imagine Documentaries returns to Sundance with this doc about Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, with 2024 marking 70 years since Kahlo passed away.
