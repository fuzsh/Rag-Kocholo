About

AVID Jazz continues with its Four Classic Album series with a re-mastered 2CD release from Jo Stafford, complete with original artwork, liner notes and personnel details.

'Starring Jo Stafford'; 'Autumn In New York'; 'Swingin' Down Broadway' and 'Jo + Jazz''

Was she pop, was she easy listening or was she jazz? In the days when our latest recruit to the AVID Jazz vocalist hall of fame was singing, genres didn't seem quite so important. She was just a great singer! We think our lady could sing even the proverbial telephone directory and it would sound wonderful. For this release, however, we have chosen four of Jo Stafford's more jazz/big band influenced albums to highlight her prodigious talents. Our selection will take you on a journey from the lush arrangements and orchestrations by husband Paul Weston from the 1950s with 'Starring' and 'Autumn In New York' to the Broadway hits of 'Swingin' Down Broadway' (these days difficult to find on CD) and on to the truly jazz inflected and under-rated and under-appreciated at the time, 'Jo + Jazz' set from 1960. Just a look at some of the fine jazz musicians on board for this recording will tell you that Jo Stafford was considered a seriously great singer by the jazz world. On Jo + Jazz you will hear the likes of Ben Webster, Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Conte Candoli, Ray Nance, Russ Freeman, Mel Lewis and Shelly Manne as well as the fine arrangements and orchestrations of Johnny Mandel.
