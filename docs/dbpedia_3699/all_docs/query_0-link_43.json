        "text": "When iconic and notoriously media-shy Bob Dylan agreed to do just one print interview to help promote his new album, the publication he chose was initially as much of a head-scratcher as the material he picked for his latest release, titled “Shadows in the Night.”\n\nInstead of turning to an important and obvious choice, like “Rolling Stone,” Dylan wandered to the other side of the media spectrum and picked perhaps the most demographically-correct magazine to reach his core fans. The 73-year-old great-grandfather chose “AARP Magazine” and its 22 million readers, the majority of who are 50 and older.\n\nConsidering his 37th studio album is a collection of 10 songs recorded by Frank Sinatra, the match with AARP is probably a no-brainer. So, for that matter, was Dylan’s decision to cover 10 tunes by Ol’ Blue Eyes. And they’re not the typical Sinatra standards, either.\n\nNo “New York, New York” or “My Way,” nor any saloon songs like “One for the Road” or “Angel Eyes” on Dylan’s album. The Great American Troubadour — whose songs inspired social change, protest movements and have been influencing people since the early 1960s — selected songs filled with gut-wrenching emotion and tales of unrequited love.\n\nTurns out Dylan has been in awe of Sinatra, who would have turned 100 this year, ever since he was a kid growing up in Minnesota during the tail end of the big band era.\n\n“Early on, before rock ‘n’ roll, I listened to big band music: Harry James, Russ Columbo, Glenn Miller. (And) singers like Jo Stafford, Kay Starr, Dick Haymes. Anything that came over the radio and music played by bands in hotels that our parents could dance to,” he says in the fascinating, 9,000-word AARP interview\n\nIt’s been nearly 40 years since fellow songwriter Willie Nelson first gave Dylan the idea of doing his own take on American music standards. In 1978, the country music legend released “Stardust,” one of the first contemporary albums with material culled from the Great American Songbook.\n\n“Stardust” hit the top of the country music chart and crossed over to reach number 30 on the Billboard 200 album list.\n\n“So I went to see Walter Yetnikoff, he was the president of Columbia Records. I told him I wanted to make a record of standards, like Willie’s record,” Dylan recalls. “What he said was, ‘You can go ahead and make that record, but we won’t pay for it, and we won’t release it. But go ahead and make it if you want to.’”\n\nIn retrospect, Dylan said Yentikoff was probably right in turning down the project. Although he’d already established himself as a major force in the music world, Dylan says it was too early in his career to tackle that kind of genre-bending album.\n\nSince he’ll be launching his spring tour at 9 p.m. Friday in Borgata’s Event Center, it’s difficult to predict a set list. However, in past appearances timed to coincide with an album launch, Dylan has always mixed material from a new release in with many of his classics.\n\nUnlike other contemporary pop and rock artists who have recorded albums of great American songs with complex arrangements performed by 30-piece orchestras — Dylan mentions Rod Stewart’s albums of standards in particular — Dylan recorded “Shadows” with mostly five musicians, the same number of players behind him on any live stage.\n\nIn fact, he thinks all the musicians supporting Stewart’s albums were overkill. Dylan wasn’t very impressed with the end products, either.\n\n“(The) records were disappointing,” he says. “Rod’s a great singer. He’s got a great voice, but there’s no point to put a 30-piece orchestra behind him. I’m not going to knock anybody’s right to make a living but you can always tell if somebody’s heart and soul is into something, and I didn’t think Rod was into it in that way. It sounds like so many records where the vocals are overdubbed and these kind of songs don’t come off well if you use modern recording techniques.”\n\nDylan went back to the future — and back to basics — when he began recording “Shadows.”\n\n“The (recording) engineer had his own equipment left over from bygone days, and he brought all that in,” Dylan says. He and his band constantly rehearsed the tunes last year between gigs during a European concert tour, performing them on an empty stage with no microphones so they could play them at the right volume.\n\n“By the time we went in to make this record, it was almost like we’d done it already,” he adds. “I could only record these songs one way, and that was live on the (studio) floor with a very small number of mics. No headphones, no overdubs, no vocal booth, no separate tracking. I know it’s the old-fashioned way, but to me it’s the only way that would have worked for songs like this.”\n\nDylan, who’s now a great-grandfather, doesn’t hide his admiration for Sinatra, considered by many the most iconic entertainer of the 20th Century.\n\nWhen he began working on the project, he initially picked 30 songs from the Sinatra catalogue, then whittled that list down to the 10 that made it onto “Shadows in the Night.”\n\nPerhaps his favorite is the lead-off track, “I’m a Fool to Want You.” It was one of the few songs actually written by Sinatra, who, it’s believed, penned the tear-jerker for his one great love, Ava Gardner, to whom he was married for six years during the 1950s.\n\n“I know that song. I can sing that song,” he explains. “I’ve felt every word in that song. I mean, I know that song. It’s like I wrote it.”\n\nIn fact, he says that song is easier for him to sing than a tune like “Queen Jane Approximately” from his 1965 album “Highway 61 Revisited.”\n\n“At one time that wouldn’t have been so. But now it is. Because ‘Queen Jane’ might be a little bit outdated,” he says. “But (‘I’m a Fool’) is not outdated. It has to do with human emotion, which is a constant thing. There’s nothing contrived in these songs. There’s not one false word in any of them. They’re eternal, lyrically and musically.”\n\nSinatra, he says, is the pinnacle of success to which all singers should aspire.\n\n“That’s the mountain you have to climb even if you only get part of the way there,” he says. “And it’s hard to find a song he did not do. He’d be the guy you got to check with.”\n\nIf Sinatra, who died in 1998, were alive today, how would he react to Dylan covering his material?\n\n“I think first of all he’d be amazed I did these songs with a five-piece band,” he says. “I think he’d be proud in a certain way.”\n\nAt this point in his career — having shaped musical and social culture with songs like “Blowing in the Wind,” “The Times They are A-Changin’” and “Just Like a Woman” — making an album like this poses little artistic or commercial risk for Dylan.\n\nWalking through a mine field is risky, he says; so is working in a poison factory. But he still doesn’t feel ready to be mentioned in the same breath as Sinatra.\n\n“There’s nothing risky about making records,” he says. “Comparing me with Frank Sinatra? You must be joking. To be mentioned in the same breath as him must be some sort of high compliment. As far as touching him goes, nobody touches him. Not me or anyone else.”\n\nAround town\n\nJerry Seinfeld returns to Borgata’s Event Center Saturday at 8 p.m. The show is listed as sold out, but check with theborgata.com or ComcastTIX at (877) 544-8499 for last-minute availability.\n\nComedian D.L.
