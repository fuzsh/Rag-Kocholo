        "text": "Aldora Britain Records, a British music magazine, included me and my debut album, “Better Late,” in its latest issue.\n\nInterview by Tom Aldora\n\nNOEL NOLSTON is a gifted singer-songwriter and multi-media artist with an immense drive and an underlying sense of determination. Having suffered severe hearing loss, as chronicled in his memoir Life After Deaf, he\n\nwent on to release a fantastic collection of rootsy brilliance in the form of 2021’s Better Late. The process behind this LP started over a decade earlier in 2009 and underwent challenges and life changing obstacles on\n\nthe way to completion. The final set, an unforgettable eleven-track offering, captured Noel’s musicality, venturing into the worlds of Americana, folk, alternative country, jazz, and many more, an American roots music emporium.\n\nAs this collection of music now passes its third anniversary, Noel took a brief respite to chat with Aldora Britain Records about his creative adventures to date. We discussed big influences and inspirations, the impact of the COVID pandemic, formative musical memories, and much, much more. That exclusive in-depth conversation is published here in full for the very first time."
