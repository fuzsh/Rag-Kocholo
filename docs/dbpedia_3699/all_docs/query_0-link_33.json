        "text": "Oct. 11th, 2 P.M. - LP Vinyl Record Album Catalogue\n\nThis list is not perfect, but with the exception of a few lots, it's accurate. Contents and amounts of albums may vary. Please inspect the Lots for Yourself. All Items are Sold As/Is, Where Is. Records will be Sold so much per Album. We have approximated the number of albums and rounded down the number, so in most cases, you will be getting more albums than what is described. In some cases, you may get less, but the number that is written on the lot is the number of albums you will pay for regardless of how many there actually are. Once you purchase these items, it is your responsibility to remove them from the auction house. All items must be removed by Saturday, Oct. 15th, at 5:30 P.M.\n\nWHAT'S FOR SALE:\n\nThese records, primarily long-playing 33 1/3 albums, are a dealer's inventory, accumulated over 6 years' time. The dealer sells primarily on eBay (as jmeckl). He is moving his family to Florida, but chose not to transport these records more than 1200 miles. So they are here in Chicago, ready for you. This is a dealer's stock, so there will be an array of records from common to scarce; condition will vary some, but most of these records are in very nice to new condition [because not always, but generally, records did not become part of this inventory until they were checked for condition.] There will be some duplicates in several of these lots, but rarely more than 3 or 4 of a kind. By the way, the vast majority of LP albums contain only one LP; but some hold 2, 3, 4, 6 and more; when an album has two or more disks in it, it is counted here as just one for purposes of citing the number of LPs in a carton. This sale consists of 75 lots.\n\nLot 1. FEMALE POP AND JAZZ SINGERS -- Sarah Vaughan, Della Reese, Teresa Brewer, Julie Andrews, Carmen McRae, Jo Stafford and dozens more. 1,000 LPs in 11 cartons.\n\nLot 2. MALE POP AND JAZZ SINGERS -- Mel Torme, Jack Jones, Frankie Laine, Tony Bennett, Sammy Davis Jr., Howard Keel, Lanny Ross, and dozens more. 750 LPs in 8 cartons.\n\nLot 3. CHRISTMAS RECORDS -- hundreds of different artists including some unusual titles.. 375 LPs in 4 cartons.\n\nLot 4. JAZZ -- Dozens of artists, hundreds of LPs in a potpourri of styles, types and eras. Many of the jazz albums throught this auction came from the estate of another record dealer that was acquired early in 2005. This first jazz lot contains 650 LPs in 7 cartons.\n\nLot 5. ROCK -- Here's a grand mix of rock styles, genres and eras including metal, soul, early, 70s, 80s, and many obscure titles. 500 LPs in 5 cartons.\n\nLot 6. BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. These hundreds of recordings by one of the world's best-known orchestras cover the gamut of pop, broadway, film, cultures and \"light\" classical. 240 LPs in 5 cartons.\n\nLot 7. ELECTRONIC MUSIC. From the 1960s and 1970s, primarily, serious musicians and pop musicians alike were experimenting with new sounds generated by computers and other novel devices. This lot contains some of the experimental music of the era, as well as popular artists like Tomita, Walter Carlos, Kitaro and others. 80 LPs in 1 carton.\n\nLot 8. FRANK SINATRA. Old Blue Eyes recorded for Columbia, Capitol, Reprise and some other labels. They're all here. 530 LPs in 6 cartons.\n\nLot 9. SHOW MUSIC. This lot consists of soundtracks and original cast recordings, anthologies of songs and theme songs, and recordings by orchestras, vocal groups, and studio casts of music from shows and films. It's a potpourri of decades of Broadway and Hollywood tunes. 425 LPs in 5 cartons.\n\nLot 10. CHILDREN'S RECORDS & DISNEY. Disney albums, which are the bulk of this lot, are collectible both as records and as Disney collectibles. Other children's records, and some by Disney, are filled with games and songs and lots of fun, often by major stars; children's records appeared botgh on several specialty labels as well as the major record companies. Records for children are collectible because, in addition to nostalgia, and in addition to the amusement of sharing them with today's media-savvy kids, they are simply hard to find in nice condition. 275 LPs in 3 cartons.\n\nLot 11. OPERA STARS. This collection of albums and a few boxed sets consists of \"recital\" records, concerts, and anthologies of work by opera stars past and present. This is a rare accumulation with many scarce titles, almost entirely from two estates in Indianapolis. 250 LPs in 3 cartons.\n\nLot 12. OPERA -- This is a rich collection of boxed sets of complete operas and \"highlights\" recordings from many operas. Most of these came from two collections purchased from estates in Indianapolis in 2004. Very nice stuff, some rare. 325 LPs in 12 cartons.\n\nLot 13. ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME ARTISTS. There are approximately 200 artists and \"influences\" who have been honored by induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. You'll find Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, Chet Atkins and Mahalia Jackson (all \"influences\") alongside Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, The Mamas and the Papas, The Four Seasons, The Rolling Stones, Ritchie Valens, Jackie Wilson, and dozens and dozens more stars. This lot is in this form because the owner of this inventory sold records at the annual record show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum, and sold at that event only records by the artists celebrated in the Rock Hall. This is a great lot of very saleable and collectible stuff. A rather comprehensive history of Rock and Roll is found here. Approx. 2,100 LPs in 22 cartons.\n\nLot 14. EASY LISTENING. During the 1940s and 1950s especially, much of American music was soft and sweet, designed for dancing, relaxation, seduction, and background sound. Dozens of orchestras, vocal groups, instrumentalists, and singers are found in these lots which are heavy 1950s and 1960s recordings, as well as some more-recent ones. If you like Sammy Kaye, Guy Lombardo, Johnny Mathis, Anita Kerr, Hugo Winterhalter and dozens of other popular and would-be-popular performers, you'll love this lot. 485 LPs in 5 cartons.\n\nLot 15. COUNTRY. This lot is a great mix of old, new, famous, obscure and wannabe country stars, on many record labels. 500 LPs in 5 cartons. One carton contains mostly Waylon Jennings.\n\nLot 16. FOLK. Here's some of the best and some of the scarcest recordings to emerge from the 1950s and 1960s, primarily, when the \"folk boom\" hit. Some artists had staying power and lasted into the 1970s and 1980s; and a new generation of singers, mostly on \"small labels\" such as Rounder, Philo, and Folk-Lyric came on the scene in the 1970s and 1980s also. They're all here, dozens and dozens of artists. 195 LPs in 3 cartons.\n\nLot 17. JAZZ. Here is an excellent jazz collection, with recordings by hundreds of artists, with emphasis on originals and reissues of material from the 1950s and 1960s. One of the highlights of this auction! 17 cartons, in alpha order, with appx. 1650 LPs.\n\nLot 18. NO ITEM.\n\nLot 19. JAZZ. Here are 12 more cartons, from the same sources, with many artist albums by dozens of artists, and many anthologies, collections and sets. 850 albums in 12 cartons.\n\nLot 20. SING-ALONG Before there was Karaoke, in the 1950s and early 1960s a popular phenomenon was Sing-Along. Mitch Miller and the Gang were the best-known performers, but dozens of other performers, choruses and vocal groups produced sing-along albums as well. 210 LPs in 3 cartons.\n\nLot 21. RECORDS ON THE NONESUCH LABEL. This is the first of many classical lots; this inventory is a gold mine of classical music because, in 2003 and 2004, collections from Southern Illinois, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago were purchased. There are many ways to \"slice\" Classical music into lots -- composer, musical form, orchestras, soloists, instruments -- and one such way is record labels. NONESUCH was a \"we try harder\" record label that pioneered low-cost records, unusual music, unfamiliar performers, and unique album art, and concentrated on baroque music long before the major labels caught on. Today, records on the Nonesuch label are often collected. 185 LPs in 2 cartons.\n\nLot 22. EUROPEAN. Folk, dance and popular music from Spain to Russia, Scandinavia to the Balkans. 100 LPs in 2 cartons.\n\nLot 23. LATIN. Records truly published in Latin and South America, and similar records published in the USA, featuring songs in Spanish, Portuguese and other languages, dances such as the Cha Cha, Mambo and Samba, and performers who appealed to Latin audiences (Perez Prado, Xavier Cugat, e.g.) are all found in this lot. Albums that feature music from Mexico Brazil, Venezuela, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Chile and more countries are found here also. [Records from Spain might have been included, but you'll find them in a European lot.] 380 LPs in 4 cartons.\n\nLot 24. STARS OF EASY LISTENING. The big names who sold many, many records: Sammy Kaye, Living Strings, Jackie Gleason, Roger Williams, and dozens of other artists. 725 LPs in 8 cartons.\n\nLot 25. CLASSICAL ENSEMBLES. Classical ensembles, pianists, trios, quartets, choruses and the like. 550 LPs in 7 cartons.\n\nLot 26. FOLK, ONE LP PER ARTIST. Here's another broad slice of the folk scene from the 1950s and 1960s in particular, and on into the 1970s and 1980s. There's only one LP per artist here, so there's not much to be found of the most popular performers and instead, many lesser-known performers are abundant. 190 LPs in 2 cartons.\n\nLot 27. NO ITEM.\n\nLot 28. SYMPHONIC CLASSICAL. Music performed by symphony orchestras the world over including the London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, St. Louis, National and many other lesser-known orchestras. 850 LPs in 10 cartons.\n\nLot 29. BIG BAND AND SWING. You can debate whether this music is jazz, pop, or even easy listening. The fact is, some of the biggest stars ever, and dozens of orchestras and ensembles, made careers in the 1930s into the 1960s (and some, still today) playing these jivey dance rhythms. 775 LPs in 9 cartons.\n\nLot 30. INSTRUMENTAL. Many recordings celebrate accordion, banjo, drums, piano, harp, percussion and other instruments. Also, some recordings, particularly on the Music Minus One label, were designed to teach various instruments. These albums may or may not have star performers, but they were issued primarily to celebrate the instruments, not the players. 675 LPs in 7 cartons.\n\nLot 31. GREATEST HITS. In nearly every genre of music, \"greatest hits\" albums are issued by the major stars. Here are 725 such LPs, all different, from comedy, jazz, pop, rock, country and other genres, in 7 cartons.\n\nLot 32. BLUES. Acoustic and electric alike, this is some of the best of American music. 100 LPs in 1 carton.\n\nLot 33 JAZZ. Another collection, jazz LPs from many eras, styhles, labels and performers. 475 LPs in 5 cartons.\n\nLot 34. LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION. Learn French, German, Spanish, Italian and more in the comfort of home. 30 LPs in 1 carton.\n\nLot 35. OPERA STARS. This is the second collection of albums and a few boxed sets consists of \"recital\" records, concerts, and anthologies of work by opera stars past and present. This is a rare accumulation with many scarce titles, almost entirely from two estates in Indianapolis. 375 LPs in 4 cartons.\n\nLot 36. COUNTRY MUSIC. This is a large collection of Nashville, Texas and California artists -- Hoyt Axton, Chet Atkins, EmmyLou Harris, Kitty Wells, just to name a few among dozens and dozens. Condition varies somewhat, but many will be close to new. INCOMPLETE. Currently 2,300 LPs in 26 cartons.\n\nLot 37. OPERA -- This is a rich collection of boxed sets of complete operas and \"highlights\" recordings from many operas. Most of these came from two collections purchased from estates in Indianapolis in 2004. Very nice stuff, some rare. 275 LPs in 8 cartons.\n\nLot 38. UNSORTED CLASSICAL. These were still not put into auction lots at the time that the auction lots were all transferred to the Direct Auction. This large lot covers the classical music waterfront, so to speak, and could well contain some gems as well as hundreds of hours of good listening. 1,300 LPs in 19 cartons.\n\nLot 39. JAZZ AND SWING STARS. Stan Kenton, Harry James, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Miller and more in one large lot. 1,000 LPs in 12 cartons.\n\nLot 40. BOX SETS FROM TIME-LIFE AND OTHERS. Time-Life, Reader's Digest, The Longines Symphonette Society, RCA Victor and other record companies, The Smithsonian and others, over the years, have produced or marketed sets of 4, 5, 6 or even 10 and 12 LPs in a single box, usually with a booklet. These sets are handsome, beautifully produced, sometimes encyclopedic (especially the many Time-Life series of boxsets), and yet, for some strange reason, in the world of record-collecting today, they are usually not very popular, selling on eBay in the $3-5 per box price range. Too bad; they make great listening! INCOMPLETE! 300 boxsets in 25 cartons.\n\nLot 41. COMEDY. Here are literally hundreds of comedians on nearly 1000 LPs, from the 1950s to the 1980s, stand-up, ensemble, political, bizarre. 940 LPs in 10 cartons.\n\nLot 42. GREATEST HITS. In nearly every genre of music, \"greatest hits\" albums are issued by the major stars. Here are 120 such LPs from comedy, jazz, pop, rock, country and other genres, in 2 cartons.\n\nLot 43. JAZZ.

The genius, composer, performer, entrepreneur, icon, at the piano, with groups, and with his orchestra. 325 LPs in 4 cartons.\n\nLot 47. JAZZ ARTISTS -- ONE LP PER ARTIST. This is a broad collection of jazz in every genre, with few big stars and hundreds of smaller names, regional performers, and such. 600 Albums in 6 Cartons.\n\nLot 48. BING CROSBY. Probably no singer in the 20th century was better known or loved than Bing Crosby. Here are dozens of his recordings. 130 titles in 2 cartons.\n\nLot 49. POPULAR INSTRUMENTAL. Herb Alpert, Sergio Mendes, and dozens of other performers of easy-to-listen and hum-along-to music from the 1950s to the 1980s. 950 titles in 10 cartons.\n\nLot 50. POPULAR FEMALE VOCALS.
