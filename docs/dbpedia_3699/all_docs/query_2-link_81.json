        "text": "This battle was inspired by Monday’s Music Moves Me about three weeks ago, where our very own Cathy set the theme of autumn. A couple of people, myself included, used this song in their playlists, which gave me the idea.\n\n“Autumn In New York” was written by Vernon Duke back in 1934. While it wasn’t written as a song for a specific show or musical, it was included in the short-lived musical Thumbs Up! in 1935. It’s regarded as a jazz standard, but the only singer that’s had any chart success with it is Frank Sinatra, whose rendition reached #27 in 1949. Here’s the Chairman of the Board (who isn’t competing today, so please don’t vote for him).\n\nInstrumental and vocal versions have been recorded over the years. Today’s battle is between two lovely chanteuses, one who I just heard of when putting this battle together, another who’s an old favorite.\n\nKimiko Itoh I hadn’t heard of Kimiko Itoh until putting this battle together. She’s a Japanese jazz singer who recorded her first album in 1982. This is from her 1996 album, Standards My Way.\n\nBy the way, the woman pictured in the video apparently is not Itoh-san, although she is also quite lovely:\n\nJo Stafford One of my favorite singers, I’ve featured Jo Stafford a few times, although I’m pretty sure never in a Battle of the Bands. “Autumn In New York” was the title track from her 1950 album, which she recorded with Paul Weston & His Orchestra.\n\nNow it’s up to you: listen to these versions of “Autumn In New York,” decide whether Ms. Itoh or Ms. Stafford did a better version of it, and vote by leaving a comment below, telling me which version reigns supreme and a few words on why you liked it. Then, if you’d be so kind, go visit Stephen, who is the host for BotB, vote in the Battle he has there, then visit the other BotB participants (the list is at the bottom of the right-hand column on Stephen’s page) and vote in those battles as well.\n\nI’ll announce the winner of this Battle next Monday, October 22, so be sure and cast your vote by then, preferably no later than Saturday night. The lines are now open. Best of luck to Itoh-san and Ms. Stafford!"
