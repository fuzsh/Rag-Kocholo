        "text": "William P Gottlieb was a music journalist and photographer whose byline appeared in The Washington Post, Downbeat and Record Changer from 1938-1948. He taught himself to use a speed graphic camera and began to shoot musicians to illustrate his articles. The Library purchased his collection in 1995 and scanned all his prints and negatives, now available in the William P. Gottlieb digital collection. His images entered the public domain in 2010. Here are a dozen memorable Gottlieb images in jazz and pop to celebrate Women’s History Month:\n\nMildred Bailey (1907–1951) achieved success singing pop songs and early jazz tunes in the late 1920s and 1930s. Bailey, part American Indian, was married to vibraphonist and bandleader Red Norvo during the 1930s; they were known as “Mr. and Mrs. Swing.”\n\nEthel Waters (1896–1977) emerged from vaudeville and the recording studios to become a leading stage and screen star. Adept in jazz and blues, she turned to gospel in later years and toured with Billy Graham’s revivals.\n\nElla Fitzgerald (1917–1996) joined Chick Webb’s band in her teens and scored a national hit with “A-Tisket-A-Tasket,” which she co-wrote. This photo captures Fitzgerald at the Downbeat Club in New York in the late 1940s with an adoring Dizzy Gillespie making goo-goo eyes at her. It also shows her husband at the time, bassist Ray Brown, behind her.\n\nBillie Holiday (1915–1959) made her first records as a teenager, toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw and recorded with Benny Goodman. Her sessions with Teddy Wilson and Lester Young set a high standard for all jazz singers who followed her, and her recording of “Strange Fruit” is considered an anthem for civil rights. This may be the single best-known image in the Gottlieb Collection.\n\nMary Lou Williams (1910-1981) was an important and influential pianist, composer and arranger who wrote for big bands and recorded more than 100 albums. Her New York City apartment became a salon for modernist younger musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Tadd Dameron and others. Here she is joined by Imogene Coca and Ann Hathaway.\n\nBassist Vivien Garry (1920-2008) led both a quintet and a trio and often worked on 52nd Street with her husband, guitarist Arv Garrison. Her best known tune is the proto-feminist anthem “A Woman’s Place Is in The Groove.”\n\nDoris Day (1922) started as a big band singer with Les Brown’s Band and later became a highly regarded actress in films by Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Curtiz and various light comedies. At 96, she’s the only one of these women still alive.\n\nSarah Vaughan (1924-90) spent early years with Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine before embarking on a solo career. She possessed one of the most beautiful virtuosic voices in jazz.\n\nJune Christy (1925-1990) epitomized the foggy, breathy cool sound that became quite popular in the 40s and 50s. She met, married and traveled with saxophonist Bob Cooper while both were in the Stan Kenton Orchestra.\n\nLena Horne (1917-2010) was a singer, dancer, actress, civil rights activist and rare beauty who worked in recording studios, Hollywood film and television.\n\nJo Stafford (2017-2008) began her career singing with The Pied Pipers and Tommy Dorsey, and enjoyed a long career singing popular songs, big band arrangements, country classics and folk songs, often backed by her husband Paul Weston."
