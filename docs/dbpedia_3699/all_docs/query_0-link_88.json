        "text": "Thank you for the question.\n\nTorch Singers\n\nI wish to say: Torch Singers are Jazz singers, whose performance is so emotional that they are burning as a torch.\n\nBut in reality everything is much prosaic: Torch singers are signers of torch songs.\n\nAccording to Wiki, torch songs are simply sentimental love songs, where love affair effects relationship and one side moves on caring torch of love. So, in my understanding it not depends on music, but the lyric and could be within a Jazz, Pop or any other genre. You could say: \"I have a big collection of great torch Pop standards.\"\n\nSamplers of the torch songs\n\nClaimed the first torch song ever written (1912) singing by Ella much later:\n\nTorch song of 20's singing by Billie in 30's:\n\nhttp://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/the-best-shm-sacds-part3.319827/page-51#post-16014394\n\nTorch song of 40's written for Billie in 1941\n\nBillie Holiday - Lover Man (Oh Where Can You Be) Decca Records 1944\n\nOne more torch song of 40's performed by Billie in 1946 for a first time:\n\nBillie Holiday - I'll Look Around (Decca Records 1946)\n\nBillie Holiday was and still is the best torch singer ever...\n\n40's really stand out on a torch songs repertoire.\n\nOne of the best singer of 20th century:\n\nJo Stafford - 'Why Can't You Behave'\n\nOne of my favorite torch song of 40's (more on a blues side):\n\nBelafonte Sings the Blues - One for my Baby\n\nNobody even came close to this version of this torch song of 50's:\n\nJo Stafford - You Belong To Me\n\nJulie London's hit Cry Me a River happens to be a torch song of 50's:\n\nJulie London - Cry Me A River (BEST version on YouTube).avi\n\nTorch singers of 60's:\n\nBrenda Lee\n\nBrenda Lee - I'm Sorry\n\nDinah Washington (love her madly)\n\nDinah Washington / Since I Fell for You\n\nDinah Washington-Nobody Knows the Way I Feel This Morning\n\nEtta James\n\nEtta James ~ I'll Take Care of You\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nAin't No Way Aretha Franklin\n\nI Never Loved A Man [The Way I Love You] [Stereo Version]\n\nJanis Joplin was a \"torchiest\" singer of all not just by the nature of the material, but who literally burned out as a torch.\n\nMove Over\n\nJanis Joplin - To love somebody\n\nTry\n\nJanis Joplin- Try (just a little bit harder)\n\nCry Baby\n\nJanis Joplin - Cry Baby\n\nPiece of My Heart\n\nJanis Joplin - Piece of my heart [HQ]\n\nMaybe\n\nJanis Joplin - Maybe (HQ)\n\nWe have actually talked about Ella Mae before. I'll search for the old posts, and will post them below, so that we can have a fuller picture of what has been said, so far.\n\nI would agree with Mr. Jones that she is not obscure enough to merit extensive discussion in this particular thread. Ella Mae even has her own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame. To this day, references to her as \"the mother of rock 'n' roll\" or \"the first rock 'n' roll singer\" still pop up here and there, too. Hence I wouldn't say that she has fallen into oblivion, either.\n\nIn any case, Ella Mae is great enough to deserve multiple mentions in this thread or any other one. So, I'm glad that 1940Zeffer brought this singer back to our attention. (Any further comments about her will be welcome. Since we have already covered so many of the really neglected singer, it shouldn't be a bit deal if we occasionally make comments about better known singers.)\n\nBelow: the older posts.\n\n1983 according to this thread\n\nPathe-Marconi mid-80s Capitol LP reissues\n\nAnnisteen Allen - Fujiyama Mama\n\nErnestine Anderson: Miss Ernestine Anderson\n\nAndrews Sisters: Sing The Dancing 20s\n\nRay Anthony: House Party, I Remember Glenn Miller, More Dream Dancing, Dream dancing, Dream Dancing medley, Swinging On Campus, Plays For Dancers In Love, Dancing Alone Together, Jam Session At The Tower\n\nBlue Lu Barker: Here's a Little Girl\n\nLes Brown: Dance To South Pacific\n\nGeorgia Carr: Softly Baby\n\nJune Christy: The Misty Miss Christy, Recalls Those Stan Kenton Days, This is June Christy\n\n*Nat King Cole: Great Capitol Masters (trio), This is Nat King Cole, To Whom It May Concern, Unforgettable, Welcome to the Club\n\nTommy Collins: This is Tommy Collins\n\nVic Damone: Linger Awhile With, My Baby Loves To Swing, Strange Enchantment, The Lively Ones\n\nBobby Darin: Oh Look At Me Now, The Versatile Bobby Darin\n\nThe Dinning Sisters: (self titled)\n\nDuke Ellington: Ellington Showcase\n\nFour Freshman: Voices in Fun (amazingly good stereo sound), Voices In Love, Stars In Our Eyes\n\nJudy Garland: Judy, Judy in Love, The Letter, Judy Garland At The Grove, Judy At Carnegie Hall\n\nJackie Gleason: Plays Romantic Jazz, The Torch with the Blue Flame, Music To Make You Misty\n\nBenny Goodman: In Hifi\n\nDelores Gray: Warm Brandy\n\nGlen Gray: Swingin' Decade, Solo Spotlight, Sounds Of The Great Bands Vol 6, Sounds Of The Great Bands In Latin, Jonah Jones/ Glen Gray\n\nBobby Hackett: In a Mellow Mood, Rendez Vous, Jazz Ultimate (with Jack Teagarden)\n\nDick Haymes: Moondreams\n\nWoody Herman: Blues Groove, Road Band\n\nBetty Hutton: A Square in the Social Circle\n\nWanda Jackson: (Self-titled), Rockin' with Wanda, There's a Party Goin' On, Right Or Wrong, Wonderful Wanda, Two Sides Of Wanda\n\nHarry James: Harry's Choice, Wild About Harry, In Hifi\n\nJonah Jones: Jumpin' with a Shuffle (stereo)\n\nStan Kenton: In Concert, Innovations in Modern Music, Cuban Fire, In Hifi, Stage Door Swings\n\nKing Sisters: Warm And Wonderful\n\nEartha Kitt: Love for Sale (EMI Columbia originally?

It so happens that this topic came up for discussion earlier in the thread, too. It was brought up by Johnny B. Good, one of the thread's honorables residents (ha). As the OP, I thought the topic interesting enough to check it out in some detail. See our two posts, below. (To view bigger-size versions of the photos in my post, click on them, or go back to the original post, #575, on page 23.)\n\nYeah! And then, in 1985, Pathé Marconi and EMI Records went for a second serving:\n\nWe should also point out the existence of several CDs released in even more recent times (as late as the year 2015), including one on the distinguished Capitol Collectors Series, not to say anything of a Bear Family box, containing nearly all of her record output:\n\nRe: previous comments about terminology (\"neglected,\" \"obscure\"). We all clearly agree that these terms are relative. That's good. As is being discussed in another ongoing thread, even the likes of Dean Martin run some risk of becoming awfully neglected, as the decades go by! Still: for the purposes of this particular thread, we will continue to concentrate on classic pop and jazz female singers who did not achieve widespread & lasting recognition -- not, at least, when compared to the likes of, say, a Sarah Vaughan or a Julie London, or even an Ella Mae Morse. And on that note:\n\nFlo Handy. You might have not heard of her but we could all successfully use her name to play the six-degrees-of-separation game. If you have been reading the last few pages of this thread, you do know Flo's more famous sister. And, if you are a jazz fan, you might be well acquainted with Handy's two husbands -- both of them arrangers and composers, the second also a saxophonist, the first a pianist. (No, I did not mean that she was a bigamist. And no again: the two men seen above were not her happy-go-lucky husbands. Let me take the opportunity to point out, though, that these two guitarists are her only musical accompaniment throughout the very good album that is being shown in the photo.)\n\nEven after getting married to Al Cohn (and staying married to him for the rest of his lifetime), Ella Mae Morse's younger sister kept on using the last name of her first husband, George Handy. She herself was not only a singer but also a pianist and composer whose work was effusively praised by fellow musicians.\n\nMaybe some of those folks were also in the know as to why Flo and Ella stopped speaking to one another for about the last 40 years of their lives, apparently going to their tombs without undertaking a reconciliation. (The Texas-born sisters were born between the mid-1920s and early 1930s. They died a few years apart, Flo in 1996, Ella Mae in 1999.) The origin of the feud remains a mystery -- at least to us, the general public.\n\nAnyway, now we are talking about obscurity, on multiple counts -- the great LP, its worthwhile vocalist ... This is an album that has received consistently enthusiastic praise from the relatively few listeners who have heard it.\n\nSmoky and Intimate is the only vocal work under Flo Handy's name -- aside from one or two singles on the same similarly obscure label, Carney Records. There is even a chance that the LP was not even commercially released, and that the extant copies are thus demonstration/promotional ones. The album finally became a little (just a little) less rare in 2008, when the Sinatra Society of Japan reissued it as a limited edition CD.\n\nOther than on the Carney items, Flo's singing can be heard only in one or two orchestra albums, released on better-known record labels which nonetheless barely bothered to reveal her presence. (No credit to her on the front covers, nor in any other prominent location. To find out that she is in, you have to check the personnel listing on the back covers.)\n\nGoing back to the original Carney LP, Leonard Feather's notes on the back cover give us some details about how Flo started her public career in music, and as to why she did not become better known.\n\nHer start: at 14 years old, Flo enrolled herself on a radio show called Which Is Which?, for which audiences had to guess if people in hiding (singing or talking behind a curtain) were impersonators, or the famous artists that the program was claimed them to be. Behind said curtain, Flo sang \"Cow Cow Boogie,\" pretending to be her older sister Ella, and the audience was fooled. This experience was satisfactory enough to inspire her to find gigs as a singer when (a few years later) she had to go out and work for a living.\n\nCritic Leonard Feather also quotes the vocalist's own assessment as to why such an \"excellent and polished\" singer did not become a well-known artist: Let's face it, I didn't try very hard. I sang for a while but I found I could make more money playing the piano, so I played the piano in funny little saloons in New York and New Jersey. In the decades that followed the making of this album, Flo and her husband's decision to live far away from the big-cities' entertainment scene would further contribute to her stay in relative obscurity.\n\nUnfortunately, YouTube does not seem to have audio clips from the Smoky and Intimate album. There is, at least, a clip of a Carney single, though the selection on the single is a livelier interpretation -- nothing like what we hear in the album. All the same, it is a tasty morsel.\n\nOkay, since you asked for it: I must ...\n\n... I must commend you for coming up with a fine addition to the thread! Thanks also for a post that covers all the essentials about her.\n\nFurther biographical details of interest include the paradox that, despite playing the stereotypical dumb blonde, she is known to have been very intelligent, with a high IQ. And she not only sang and acted but also wrote lyrics, a batch of which she interpreted in Mulligan's company, and have been preserved.\n\nI definitely hear the vocal similarities to Billie Holiday in some of her interpretations. When the occasion demanded it, she could also belt it out or get theatrical, in typical Broadway style. She was a good singer, most definitely.\n\nOn a personal note, I certainly like her as an actress but have long wished that I could like her more as a singer ... Her voice just doesn't appeal to me. Taste begin taste, there's not a whole lot that I can do about it. But that's okay, since she is not wanting for fans of her singing. (I know of lots of other listeners who are very enthusiastic.)\n\nShe made two full albums. The one with Mulligan is actually the lesser of the two. She is at her best in the other one, in which she adopts an appealingly smoky voice and goes through a very tasteful batch of \"oh-I'm-so-forlorn\" torch songs:\n\nMost of the rest of her recorded output is from the movies, and available on soundtrack albums. The one with which I am most familiar:\n\nFrom that movie, here she is, introducing a number that has become a standard, and which many famous singers have gone on to record:\n\nMy opinion would be that both qualify as obscure & neglected. I'd say that any female singer whose career did not go (or barely went) beyond the role of \"big band canary\" automatically qualifies! There were so many of them.\n\nI appreciate that you provided one clip each for Carolyn and Virginia. When I listen to big band albums featuring unknown canaries, one thing that happens to me is that my attention span tends to be very short. To my ears, their voices blur too much with the music -- or, otherwise, do not measure up to the musical accompaniment. For that reason, I find that \"piecemeal\" listening of any such singers (i.e., just one clip per singer, and on the computer) helps me pay more attention. To my ears, their voices often blur too much with the music -- or, otherwise, the vocals do not measure up to the musical accompaniment.\n\nIn Carolyn Grey's voice, I do hear the same type of saucy attack that characterized a lot of Anita O'Day's big band work. Mind you, Anita wasn't the only one who sounded saucy back then. (Others, including the recently mentioned Ella Mae Morse, come to mind as well). Still, the fact that Carolyn was replacing Anita suggests that the style was being intentionally copied. (Not necessarily by Carolyn's choice. I believe that big band singers often had to acquiesce to demands from bandleaders and managers, who would ask them to imitate the vocalists they were replacing.) In any case, Carolyn has a pleasant voice; she sounds like she had the potential to become a fine solo singer. I'm reading that she did manage to do some post-big-band work in 1953 and 1954, for what presumably were tiny, short-living labels, one named Jig-Saw and the other Vito. (Below: Carolyn walking on Hollywood and Vine.)\n\nVirginia Verrell also sounds pleasant, but, in the clip above, a bit too sweetly bland and old fashioned even for my personal preference. The NY Times obituary explains that she came from a vaudeville family of entertainers, which might explain my impression of an old fashioned, even slightly hammy vocal style. I am also reading that he was known primarily as a movie dubber, standing for Barbara Stanwyck during a screen rendition of \"Ten Cents a Dance,\" and scoring a hit after performing \"That Old Feeling\" on film.\n\nThanks for introducing us to both singers, Mister Jones."
