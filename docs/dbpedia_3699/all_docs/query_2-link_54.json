        "text": "Album of the Week, February 28: The Compilation Conundrum\n\nFebruary 28, 2016\n\nThey have many names: Greatest Hits, Best of, Singles, Gold, and more! What these albums have in common is that they provide a snapshot of a musical act’s output. As I’ve written my way through my favorite artists and albums, I’ve avoided focusing on any of these overviews, saving them for the Further Listening section as appropriate. Sometimes, however, a compilation is a wonderful way to enjoy the music. The best of the Best Of’s come in five flavors.\n\n1. The Hit Machines\n\nPerhaps the most prevalent — and one of the first types of long-player available — are the collections of songs an act has released as singles intended for radio play. Many acts have enough big hits to fill a disc or two, creating a nice overview for casual fans or for people mostly interested in the familiar material. These discs serve as great overviews of solid genre performers (like Donna Summer), or acts that frankly put their best music out as singles (thank you, ABBA). Sometimes a compilation will catch a song that never made it onto another album (Blondie and Call Me), and they often have a new track or two that will become a hit (Dan Fogelberg’s nice Greatest Hits). It can also be a great way to get a snapshot of a band that was a hit machine outside the United States, like Squeeze (Singles, 45’s and Under) or the Jam (the amazing Snap!). Let the buyer beware, of course since single releases of songs may be remixes or shortened versions. Madonna’s Immaculate Collection is a notorious example of great music badly collected.\n\n2. Career Overviews\n\nMany acts have long, interesting careers that include songs that were never hits or a mix of hits from each side of the Atlantic. Major stars like Bob Dylan and David Bowie fit here nicely, and each curated one collection themselves (Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 and ChangesOneBowie respectively). Some long careers never included radio play, like the chameleonic John Martyn. A good compilation can also be a way to preserve a particular slice of a career, like the Beatles’ “Red” and “Blue” albums. Like the hit machine collections, these are a great way for a casual fan to connect with an artist or for a newcomer to get started.\n\n3. Short Careers\n\nNot everyone sticks around as long as the Rolling Stones. When an act has a small catalog, a collection can be a strong introduction or a nice overview. Artists who died young — like Nick Drake or Jim Croce — are great examples, as are bands that only had a couple of albums and some singles, like the Zombies. File this category under Your Mileage May Vary, of course. I can’t imagine not owning all three original Drake discs or the entirety of Odessey and Oracle. I’m very happy with a smart overview of Croce’s music however, blending the hits and some solid album cuts.\n\n4. Oddities and Outtakes\n\nMany artists, especially the most prolific, have a backlog of unreleased tracks, demos, and b-sides. For these, a compilation is often the only way to get everything, especially for completionists. Elvis Costello’s Taking Liberties, Robyn Hitchcock’s Invisible Hitchcock, and the Triffids’ Beautiful Waste and Other Songs (which includes two EPs) are great examples. Sadly, these albums often go out of print as content is repackaged. Costello’s maddening multiple versions of every album are a prime example. The “bonus track” phenomenon can round out a great album (Hitchcock’s I Often Dream of Trains) or clog up half a disc with fragments and experiments (most Alan Parsons Project re-issues).\n\nRelated to this category are bands that release numerous non-album singles. Buzzcocks’ Singles Going Steady is a perfect overview of the band, with the best moments from their early albums and all those singles that never had an album to call home. Earlier performers, like Nat “King” Cole or Jo Stafford often fit into this group almost by default.\n\n5. The Mega-Pack\n\nStarting in the late 80s, the box set became a phenomenon, taking most of these categories and dumping them into four- or five-disc collections. These are usually very mixed bags — as Barenaked Ladies warn us — often including multiple alternate versions or sonically challenged live takes. Sometimes, however, they really hit the mark. Eric Clapton’s Crossroads is one of the best examples. Because he played in so many different bands and had a long solo career on multiple labels, collecting a good sample of his work is nearly impossible without this box. For listeners who want a thorough overview of a long career, big packages are a great way to get a solid collection without buying dozens of albums.\n\nArtists with extensive live or broadcast catalogs can benefit from a box as well. Richard Thompson’s Live At the BBC is a perfect example, capturing his many radio performances, including beautiful alternate versions and some not-otherwise-available tracks. For the not-quite-casual fan or the enthusiast, a well-crafted box is a great thing. (I dote on out-of-print multi-disc sets of Martin Carthy, June Tabor, and the Watersons.)\n\nIn the digital, buy a track at a time, stream to your heart’s content era, the concept of the compilation may seem a bit dated. I’ve certainly built my own compilations for artists I enjoy, especially when there isn’t anything available (the Connells) or when I own several albums and want a sampler of the rest (Jethro Tull). Still, there’s something to be said for a collection that’s been assembled with intention. Whether the artist says “here are my favorites” or radio play sets up a great playlist, sometimes a pre-set compilation is the perfect way to enjoy the music.\n\nAlbum of the Week, May 5: Sound Affects by the Jam\n\nMay 5, 2013\n\nPaul Weller (vocals, guitar) formed the Jam in Woking, Surrey with Rich Buckler (percussion) and Bruce Foxton (bass) when they were still in their teens. He was fascinated by the sound of 60s British pop, catalyzed by the Who’s My Generation. Building on this foundation and Mod subculture that accompanied it, they performed mostly covers as they developed their sound. They became part of the cultural and political movement associated with punk while maintaining their musical roots. Distinctly British in sound, themes, and attitude, they became one of the biggest bands in the U.K. without making much of a dent in the U.S. charts. They signed with Polydor in 1977 quickly recorded four albums, releasing other singles between them. While they stayed true to their original sound and musical themes, the band clearly grew up over the course of their releases. In 1980, with Weller barely in his 20s, they released their masterpiece (and his favorite of their discs), Sound Affects.\n\nTitle Sound Affects Act The Jam Label Polydor Release Date November 28, 1980 Producer Vic Coppersmith-Heaven and the Jam U.S. Chart 72 U.K. Chart 2 Tracks\n\nPretty Green\n\nMonday\n\nBut I’m Different Now\n\nSet the House Ablaze\n\nStart!\n\nThat’s Entertainment\n\nDream Time\n\nMan In the Corner Shop\n\nMusic For the Last Couple\n\nBoy About Town\n\nScrape Away\n\nWhile the band’s musical and lyrical sophistication had grown over the years, their overall musical approach was strikingly consistent. They played (mostly) fast and loud, mixed songs about personal relationships with biting social commentary, and merged their DIY instincts with a crisp, professional production. Sound Affects builds on all these strengths, presenting a smart pop album with great songs and well-crafted music by a tight band.\n\nThe album opens with Pretty Green, a story song about gambling and hoping for a better life. It’s the closest in tone to the band’s earlier output and serves as the perfect welcome. Monday is a great song about young love, perfectly capturing the anxiety brought on by separation. But I’m Different Now shows another side of romance, with Weller pleading for a second chance after a transgression.\n\nThree songs in, we’ve barely spent seven minutes with the band and already experienced some of the best music of the 80s. Set the House Ablaze is a much longer track (one of their longest at just over five minutes) and a powerful social statement. Weller chastises a friend who used to share his social values but has now been indoctrinated into a narrow mindset of hatred. It’s a potent and personal song, merging all of the band’s strengths into one powerful burst of energy.\n\nStart! is one of the band’s favorites; they campaigned to have it released as the first single (and were right, as it went straight in at #1). Built on Foxton’s brilliant interpretation of the bass line from the Beatles’ Taxman, it’s a plea for communication and cooperation in a polarized world. It’s followed by one of the band’s finest songs , That’s Entertainment. (Ironically, Polydor resisted releasing this as a single as well, resulting in a #21 hit from an import only release.) A clear-eyed look at the horrors of poverty and class struggle, it’s a masterpiece of irony and biting commentary.\n\nDream Time is a nice companion to the Clash’s Lost In the Supermarket, a look at the power of consumer culture and the influence of money (or its lack) on love and happiness. Man In the Corner Shop is an altogether different look at business, looking at a small business owner, a factory worker, and the factory’s owner and their casual interactions and envy each of what the other has. It’s a nicely crafted set of interlocking vignettes and demonstrates Weller’s strength as a writer. Music for the Last Couple is an oddity. One of the rare tracks with writing credits to all three members of the Jam, it’s mostly an offbeat instrumental with one sparsely repeated vocal line. It’s a nice showcase for how the band play together, but overall the closest to a throwaway on a stunning album.\n\nBoy About Town is a wonderful, upbeat tune, replete with trumpets and buoyant vocals. It takes a careful listen to catch the darkness in the lyrics underneath the joyous sounds, creating a powerful moment as the disc winds down. Things wrap up with the aptly titled Scrape Away. The truest to the punk roots of the band, it’s an aggressive dissection of the dark, violent mindset of too many disenfranchised youth. It’s disturbing but serves as a call to action, a perfect closer to a brief but amazing musical journey.\n\nFURTHER LISTENING: After just one more album and a handful of singles, Weller called it a day and broke up the band. All six albums are worth a listen, with All Mod Cons coming a close second to Sound Affects. The singles and strong album tracks have been repackaged multiple times. Greatest Hits is a solid overview of the singles; Snap! is one of the best compilation albums of all time, perfectly distilling the five-year journey of the Jam on record."
