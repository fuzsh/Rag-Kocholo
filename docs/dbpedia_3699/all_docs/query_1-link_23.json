        "text": "A Christmas Yuleblog Sampler - 2011\n\nMerry Christmas! We've had quite a year here - digitizing all of our Christmas music, a radio show , and remastering yuleblog samplers past. But I can't complain. Taking the nine months to get every album and MP3 onto my hard drive (and an external hard drive for backup) was the best decision I may have made in my Christmas life. To have every song at my fingertips saves me time and led to discoveries of songs I never knew I had. I thought that what the CD was supposed to do but that only shows you how far in the past I was living. The radio show was very satisfying. The folks at the radio station were very supportive and thrilled with the end results. Will it happen again next year? I'm hopeful but only time will tell. Lots of things are in store at the station... Okay... enough about you Capt... where's the samplers? During a break in digitizing in June, I went back and remastered the Yuleblog Samplers from 2008 and 2009. Every 45\n\n2001 Playlist\n\nThe 2001 playlist: 1.) 2001 intro My usual intro with the Flat Duo Jets on \"Jingle Bells\" mixed together with \" Also Sprach Zarathustra \". 2.) Monty Python - Christmas In Heaven I waited years to use this one... it fits perfectly leading off the CD. 3.) Wayne Newton - Jingle Bell Hustle At the time, I thought this was the worst Christmas disco song ever (see 2008 below). 4.) Casey Kasem - American Top 40 Christmas bumper (No. 3) Found on Napster (the pre-legal days) from one of Casey's old radio programs. 5.) Dale Monty & The 2x2's - The Lil' Endless Summer Boy Take a surf guitar version of \"Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Wipeout\". You get this track. 6.) The Surfaris - A Surfer's Christmas List The same group who originally did \"Wipeout\"! Great Christmas surf track. 7.) Sleepless in Seattle - Meg Ryan listening to Christmas radio \"Coming up, 'Jingle Bells' backwards!\""
