        "text": "The music you will hear below is is my new favorite experience. Because of it, I want to go back to 1932 and (respectfully) hug Marion Harris (so stylish, above) or at least invite her to dine, although my implausible devotion keeps on being interrupted by laughter. Please put down what you are doing and join me for three minutes and thirteen seconds:\n\nI don’t know if I love this performance more because of its deadpan wackiness — which is to say, Ms. Harris’ complete sweet sincerity, making the verbal jokes more perilously hilarious — or is it because I taught college English for more than forty years to young men and women who blithely could say “Him and me”? Or is it the combination of those two elements? I also feel that Ms. Harris’ seriousness is truly adult: this is not baby-talk in a child’s voice (think of Dot Dare and Helen Kane and others of the time). I believe her completely, down to her sigh after the word “kiss,” even though, were she a student, I would have commended the sincerity of her ideas while walking her through the doors of the Writing Center for an extended stay.\n\nAnother wonderful aspect of this recording is its thoughtful, delicate tempo: other recordings I’ve heard, thanks to YouTube, take this song as a fairly quick one-step, emphasizing its comedy. The one film version, where ingenue Pat Paterson sings it in a 1934 Spencer Tracy Film, BOTTOMS UP, also presents it as a comic turn. Ms. Harris’s slower tempo permits the song to exist simultaneously as a love ballad where the singer is discovering these new emotions and as a verbal tour-de-force.\n\nWhat I do know about this recording is, as we say, not much. Ms. Harris recorded the then-current pop song (music by J. Russel Robinson, lyrics by Mercer Cook) in May 1932 in England. No reference work on my shelves says anything about this dear recording — it’s not “jazz” enough for the chroniclers — so I know nothing about Ms. Harris’ accompanists, except my ears tell me that the unidentified guitarist has learned his Eddie Lang deeply and well.\n\nBut this just in! Informed evidence from the masterful guitarist Martin Wheatley:\n\nAs to the guitarist, I would say the most likely candidate is Len Fillis. Albert Harris and Ivor Mairants would have been contenders had the record been made a few years later. Even so Fillis would be favourite. In addition, the pianist sounds to me rather like Sid Bright, Fillis’ regular partner-in-crime. And in addition to that I found that Fillis recorded with Marton Harris in London on 2nd June that same year – Spring Is Here Again. It all points in one direction !\n\nAnd, not incidentally, I think these lyrics would be fiendishly difficult to memorize and to perform without a piece of paper to glance at: the reasonably-literate singer would want to supply grammatically correct alternatives: think of Jo Stafford singing off-key and out-of-time as “Darlene Edwards.”\n\nI would give a great deal to have been present at the collaboration of Robinson and Cook. Did either of them suggest, “Am I In Love? I Am,” and then find out how little relevant rhymes with “am,” and propose this comic alternative?\n\nAs for I, I is smitten.\n\nSo I will listen again. And if someone thinks, “Michael made this all up,” here’s empirical proof. Another sheet music cover has Ethel Shutta prominently featured, and more than a half-dozen other recordings by American and British bands and vocalists are on YouTube. But none so nice:\n\nAnd that often overlooked but invaluable resource, the Internet Archive, presents 29 recordings by Ms. Harris — her complete electrical recordings from 1925-1934, with a less filtered copy of IS I IN LOVE? — here. Treasures.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nThe nimble folks at “jgautographs” had their hands full of surprises . . . although their holdings range from Frederick Douglass to Marilyn Monroe to Irene Dunne, Stephen Sondheim, and Thomas Edison, it’s the jazz ephemera — no longer ephemeral — that fascinates me and others. Here’s a sampling, with a few comments. (The seller has many more autographs, from Sonny Rollins and Eubie Blake to Gene Krupa and Conrad Janis, so most readers of this blog will find something or someone to fascinate themselves.) For those who want(ed) to buy what they see here, the auction ended this evening: if you are curious, I bid and lost on the Ivie Anderson and Jimmy Rushing; I won the Henry “Red” Allen and will be giving showings at a future date. Check Eventbrite for tickets.\n\nA number of the older autographs were inscribed to “Jack,” as you’ll see, and some of the newer ones to “Mark,” “Mark Allen,” and “Mark Allen Baker,” which led me on another path — more about the latter at the end of this post.\n\nHusband and wife, very important figures in popular music, now perhaps less known. Arranger Paul Weston:\n\nand warm-voiced Jo Stafford:\n\nYusef Lateef lectures Mark:\n\nwhile Louie Bellson is much more gentle in his inscription:\n\nLady Day, to Jack:\n\nand Billie’s former boss, who called her “William”:\n\nNotice that the Count’s signature is a little hurried, which to me is proof of its on-the-spot authenticity, because artists didn’t always have desks or nice flat surfaces to sign autographs after the show. His calligraphy is in opposition to the next, quite rare (and in this case, quite dubious) signature:\n\nBeautiful calligraphy, no? But Helen Oakley Dance told the story (you can look it up) that Chick was embarrassed by his own handwriting, and when Helen asked for an autograph, Chick said, no, his secretary should sign it because her handwriting was so lovely . . . thus making me believe that this paper was not in Chick’s hands. People who are less skeptical bid seriously on it, though.\n\nBlossom Dearie, who arouses no such doubts:\n\nAnd James Rushing, of that same Count Basie band:\n\nI saw Mister Five-by-Five once, and his sound is still in my ears:\n\nanother Jimmy, happily still with us:\n\nyet another Jimmy, playing at the Hotel Pennsylvania:\n\nWould you care to join me for dinner?\n\nPerhaps you’d like to meet both Dorsey Brothers?\n\nand we could stay for the “Bombe Borealis,” whatever it looked like:\n\nA woman I would have loved to see and hear, Miss Ivie Anderson:\n\nShe continues to charm:\n\nSmack:\n\nJay Jay:\n\nand Cee Tee:\n\nThe wondrous Don Redman:\n\nElla, whose inscription is elaborate and heartfelt:\n\nOne of the million he must have signed:\n\nJim Hall, always precise:\n\nOne can’t have too many of these:\n\nan influential bandleader and personality:\n\none of Lucky’s great stars — and ours — from an era when you noted what instrument the star played, even if you couldn’t quite spell it:\n\nHere’s the musical background, in the foreground:\n\nfinally, something that deserves its own scenario, “Mister Waller, could I have your autograph?” “Of course, young lady. What’s your name?” “Mildred.”\n\nwhich raises the question: was the bus ticket the spare piece of paper she had, or were they both on a Washington, D.C. streetcar or bus? At least we know the approximate date of their intersection:\n\nNeither Fats nor Mildred can answer this for us anymore, but here is the perfect soundtrack:\n\nMark Allen Baker, in the pre-internet world I come from, would have remained a mystery — but I Googled his name and found he is a professional writer, with books on sports teams and boxing, but more to the point, on autograph collecting. So although I would have hoped he’d be a jazz fan, my guess is that his range is more broad. And the autographs for sale here suggest that he has found the answer to the question, “Why do you collect autographs?” — the answer being, “To hold on to them and then sell them,” which benefits us.\n\nMay your happiness increase!\n\nI imagine a teenager, Debra, who has her friends over in her parents’ rec room, perhaps the den, perhaps the basement with knotty pine walls. Her little brother wants to come and join them but Debra firmly refuses. This is for her friends, not for twirps. Debra and her friends have a few bottles of soda which they pour into aluminum tumblers; there is a bag of potato chips. But the main focus is the music.\n\nDebra has a pile of new 45 rom records and she has gotten a special record player for her birthday — one of those with a big center spindle.\n\nShe stacks up a pile of the current hits: Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tony Bennett, Percy Faith, Jo Stafford, Frankie Laine, Eddie Fisher, Patti Page, Perry Como, Teresa Brewer, Kay Starr, Leroy Anderson, Al Martino, and someone the kids don’t immediately recognize. He sings familiar songs: COLD COLD HEART, BECAUSE OF YOU, MAYBE IT’S BECAUSE, I’LL KEEP THE LOVELIGHT BURNING.\n\nHe has an unusual voice — rough yet tender — and there is a really impressive trumpet player on the records. “Who is that singing, Debra?” one of the girls asks. “Don’t you know Satchmo?” Debra responds. “Satchmo?” says Julie. “What kind of name is Satchmo?” “Oh, that’s Louis Armstrong,” another friend pipes in. “He’s a jazz musician. My parents listen to him all the time.” “He sounds really good,” says Julie. “Let me see the record,” says one of the other girls.\n\nAnd so taste is formed.\n\nAnd, yes, there was life before Bill Haley and his Comets, before Elvis.\n\nThese ruminations are the result of a trip to a fabled flea market in Alameda, California, where the only thing either of us purchased was this set of two extended-play 45 rpm records — for a dollar.\n\nI have invented the little scenario above because my copy is well-loved and well-played, and Debra wrote her name on the front cover and on the label of each record. They were hers, you know, and she wasn’t going to get them mixed up with anyone else’s records.\n\nThere was a time when “popular music” wasn’t so energetically polarized, when people gathered communally to listen to records, to enjoy, to comment, to discuss. Life before earbuds. When Satchmo serenaded, and no one recoiled from “jazz,” or “Dixieland,” or “your parents’ music.”\n\nWe can’t bring back those days — or can we? Play some music for a friend or colleague or family member . . . see if you can send them some old-fashioned good vibrations. I’m going to play SATCHMO SERENADES when I get back to New York.\n\nWhere is Debra?\n\nMay your happiness increase."
