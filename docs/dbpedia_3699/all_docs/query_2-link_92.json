Jo's voice was in fact part of two American wars as the Stafford effect lingered on into the 1950's and Korea. She was a firm favourite of musicians, Lester Young, a musician who knew a thing or two himself, once stated that if he could lead his own dream band, he would have Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford on vocals.\n\nYes Indeed! - Stafford, Jo\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
