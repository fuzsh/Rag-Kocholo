        "text": "Jo Stafford had been a singer with the close harmony Pied Pipers, when she was plucked from their ranks for solo stardom. She was recorded with Paul Weston's Orchestra (and often with vocal groups that emulated the Pipers) in the early 1950s, and Weston eventually married her. The first of the two CDs in this package have the highs and lows of this early period of the partnership and media spotlight, and they display Stafford's voice well, but wrap her in a stodgy period setting that simply hasn't stood the test of time. A well-delivered ‘Autumn in New York’ is set in a stifling orchestral chart, and even ‘Just One of Those Things’ never quite takes off. Things are better as we enter the late 1950s, with Billy May taking over the arranging duties (still for Weston's band), and immediately ‘I Got It Bad’ and a bongo-tastic ‘Speak Low’ grab the attention in a way Weston's sclerotic arrangements don't. But suddenly the second CD springs to life in a stunning version of ‘Just Squeeze Me’. It's the fledgling talent of (the sadly recently deceased) Johnny Mandel who provides the perfect setting that Stafford has lacked hitherto on the set and the last 11 tracks are just a joy. If you want to gauge the talent of this undervalued singer, it's this album, Jo+ Jazz, that does the business. Her timing is dazzlingly jazzy and with Ben Webster, Don Fagerquist and Ray Nance adding cameo solos on tracks like ‘You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To’, not to mention the understated swinging piano of Jimmy Rowles, this redeems the whole set and helps us appreciate a great jazz singer at her finest."
