        "text": "Post by Jimbo\n\nPost by y***@yahoo.com\n\nAlthough this didn't make it out of previous round, I think the flip-\n\nside\n\n\"You Belong To Me\" Columbia 39811, and \"Jambalaya\" Columbia 39838, were\n\ntwo separate records. The flip side of \"Jambalaya\" is \"Early Autumn\",\n\nanother song which made the top 40.\n\nJim\n\nPost by y***@yahoo.com\n\nhttp://youtu.be/2boHCNfbUD4\n\nIn fact (of opinion here), for my money, this is the best of a slew of\n\nother people's versions of famed songs from the Hank Williams'\n\nsongbook, with the possible exception on some days for me of B.J.\n\nThomas & The Triumphs' heavily-rotated big impact hit of \"I'm So\n\nLonesome I Could Cry\" from '66 in the next decade. With any kind of\n\nforesight, Miller and/or Stafford would have held this out to be its\n\nown A-sided hit. U.S. radio, even non-Country stations, played the\n\nStafford under-card anyway, even decades later on nostalgia radio\n\nformats.\n\nHowever, although it doesn't trump Hank Williams original, it trumps\n\nmany other A-side pop hits of other songs from other artists from\n\n1952, and provided a cheery, upbeat radio presence years after\n\nwhenever it was played in Philadelphia; the product of good work by\n\nnot just Jo Stafford, but the talent arranger and musicians\n\nparticipating in this session. Pardon any resemblance to Uni-ism,\n\nbut this one truly inspires me a lot, to say: \"Good work, Jo!\"- Hide quoted text -\n\n- Show quoted text -\n\nThanks for the correction - it is true I really started looking back\n\nPost by y***@yahoo.com\n\nPost by y***@yahoo.com\n\nAlthough this didn't make it out of previous round, I think the flip-\n\nside\n\n<Snip>\n\nPost by y***@yahoo.com\n\nThanks for the correction - it is true I really started looking back\n\nat what was behind (read: before) the mid-50's R&R surge only aoout 20\n\nyears ago, but we were well into the CD age by then, and although I\n\nhave a nice CD collection combining originals of Jo's Capitol &\n\nColumbia (I THINK those were her labels) stuff, plus having her\n\nelsewhere on various artists collections, the main CD doesn't list\n\ndiscography details - revealing my slack research or untrustworthy on-\n\nline source here, when I shouldn't, and ought to have gone to the\n\ngreat discography page that exists, which I had visited before when\n\nresearching years for my Swing Era List at Digital Dream Door. If\n\nyou're picking up that I never owned the 45 out of that, you're\n\ncorrect; I don't collect for nostalgia, my time, money and intense\n\nother interests don't allow for every collector's whim, so I just try\n\nto collect the music necessary for myself - usually on CD, but buy any\n\nmeans necessary - even if it means going back to 10\" lps or settling\n\nfor cassettes for O.O.P. items - finding one's preferred music is\n\nquite a reach in itself. After two robberies in my lifetime, which\n\ncleaned out my record collections all vinyl before; I'm on my 3rd\n\ncollection adventures.\n\nThe recordings she made with Tommy Dorsey are also excellent. \"You\n\nBelong to Me\" and \"Jambalaya\" were among the very first 45's I\n\npurchased. Her version of \"Early Autumn\" is one of my favorites.\n\nShe did a series of comedy records with husband Paul Weston. If you\n\nhave a chance list to the \"Darlene and Jonathan Edwards\" LP's. Jo was\n\nknown for having perfect pitch and she was able to use that ability to\n\nmake some wonderful comedy.\n\nJim"
