        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Jo Stafford, a favorite of GIs in World War II whose later recordings made the pop music charts dozens of times in the 1950s, has died of congestive heart failure at her home in Century City. She was 90.\n\nHer son, Tim Weston, told the Los Angeles Times she had been in ill health since October and was hospitalized several times since 2002. She died on Sunday.\n\nStafford enjoyed most of her success from the late 1930s to the early `60s, according to The Times. Her skills were apparent from the time when she sang as a teenager in a vocal trio with her two older sisters, Pauline and Christine.\n\nQualities that were present at that time became the foundation of her vocal style: her impressive technical skills, flawless intonation and cool but expressive tone, according to the newspaper.\n\nShe once was told by a World War II veteran that “the Japanese used to play your records on loudspeakers across from our foxholes so that we’d get homesick and surrender,” The Times reported. Not surprisingly, servicemen affectionately referred to her as “GI Jo.”\n\nStafford and her second husband, pianist/composer Paul Weston, were viewed by most of their contemporaries as musical class acts, which made their transformation into Jonathan and Darlene Edwards a remarkable accomplishment, according to The Times.\n\nThey would do imitations of a minimally skilled duet of singer and piano player. It worked so well that their recording of “Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris” won the Grammy for Best Comedy Album of 1960 — Stafford’s only Grammy.\n\nShe is survived by her children, Tim, a musician and record producer, and Amy, a singer; four grandchildren; and her younger sister, Betty Jane, The Times reported.
