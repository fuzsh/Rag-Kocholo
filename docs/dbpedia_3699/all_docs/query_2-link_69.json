        "text": "Some of you may already know this, but I've got an ongoing John Waters music project going. See, there are *lots* of great songs used in JW's movies (the early ones are especially music-heavy), but only a handful of his movies have soundtrack albums: Hairspray, Cry-Baby, Pink Flamingos, Serial Mom, and Pecker.\n\nThose albums all kick ass (if you don't own each one of 'em, shame on you)! However, even THEY have songs missing. The Hairspray album, for instance, doesn't contain any Chubby Checker songs, even though Chubby's music is very prominent in the film (\"Dancing Party,\" \"The Pony,\" etc.) Cry Baby doesn't contain \"He's in the Jailhouse Now\" by Webb Pierce. Serial Mom doesn't contain \"Tomorrow\" from Annie. Many of JW's movies don't even HAVE soundtrack albums!\n\nMy project has been to find all the songs that were used in JW movies and which aren't available on those five soundtrack albums. Also, \"Cry Baby\" contained a few songs that were remakes of other songs, and in those cases, I'm trying to find the originals upon which those were based. (Like \"Mr. Sandman\" by the Chordettes).\n\nBeyond just finding the songs, I always try to get the right version that's actually used in the movie. For instance, the Little Richard songs used in Mondo Trasho all come from a 60s live album. In later movies (Pink Flamingos) he used the studio recordings of those songs.\n\nSometimes, there are alternate versions of the whole movie. The music in the 1972 version of Pink Flamingos, for instance, is different in spots than the 1997 version. (The song \"Sixteen Candles\" is used in the first version but not the second.) The TV version of Cry Baby has some extra songs, too.\n\nSometimes, this attention to detail blows up in my face. One big example is the Chubby Checker songs from Hairspray. Chubby's original recordings are out of print now because of copyright problems. The recordings you find on CD by him today are cheesy 80s remakes. (They're easy to spot because they're in stereo instead of mono.) Anyhow, when I found that my CD didn't contain the real 60s recordings, I took it back to the store. Then, I went to a used record shop and got a used copy of a Chubby Checker greatest hits albums with the real recordings. Imagine my chagrin when I listened closely to the music in Hairspray and found that JW didn't use the 60s recordings! He used the cheesy 80s remakes instead! Aaarrggghhh!!\n\nWhat I'm asking from you guys and gals is help finding songs. I've already collected dozens of songs, but there are still many more missing. Sometimes, I can't even identify the songs used in his movies. (ESPECIALLY the instrumentals in the early movies!)\n\nPlease: scour through your record collections and rewatch JW's movies on videotape. Try to identify all the songs you can. If you have some of these songs in your collection or if you think you have some information that might be of use to me, PLEASE E-MAIL JEFF JACKSON and he will forward the message on to me!\n\nSoon, I'll compile a more complete list of the songs I've already tracked down and which I'm still looking for, but here are some of them.\n\nCode (what movie it's used in):\n\n[MT] Mondo Trasho\n\n[MM] Multiple Maniacs\n\n[PFO] Original Pink Flamingos\n\n[PF25] Pink Flamingos 25th anniversary version\n\n[FT] Female Trouble\n\n[DL] Desperate Living\n\n[PY] Polyester\n\n[HS] Hairspray\n\n[CB] Cry-Baby\n\n[CBR] Songs that were remade for Cry-Baby\n\n[SM] Serial Mom\n\nThere doesn't need to be a code for \"Pecker,\" since its soundtrack album is complete... I think.\n\nSONGS I ALREADY HAVE\n\n\"Lollipop\" - The Chordettes [MT]\n\n\"Two Faces Have I\" - Lou Christie [MT]\n\n\"Keep Your Hands Off My Baby\" - Little Eva [MT]\n\n\"Pony Time\" - Chubby Checker [HS]\n\n\"The Fly\" - Chubby Checker [HS]\n\n\"Let's Twist Again\" - Chubby Checker [HS]\n\n\"Limbo Rock\" - Chubby Checker\" [HS]\n\n\"Dancing Party\" - Chubby Checker [HS]\n\n[NOTE: for all Chubby songs, I still need the generic 1980s versions. They're widely available in stores on CD. You can tell if the CD is in stereo if they're the modern recordings. The stereo recordings are the ones I'm looking for, even though they suck. I had a CD of this once, and I took it back. Now I wish I had it again, because they're the ones he used. You can especially tell in the \"Limbo Rock\" scene because the guitar intro has one wrong note in the 1980s version.]\n\nMORE SONGS I ALREADY HAVE\n\n\"Jack the Ripper\" - Link Wray [MT]\n\n\"The Girl Can't Help It (live)\" - Little Richard [MT]\n\n\"Mashed Potato Time\" - Dee Dee Sharp [HS]\n\n\"Slow Walk\" - Sil Austin [MT - used over and over again]\n\n\"Jailhouse Rock\" - Elvis Presley [MM]\n\n\"I Want You, I Need You, I Love You\" - Elvis Presley [MT]\n\n\"Just Because\" - Elvis Presley [MM]\n\n\"We're Off to See the Wizard\" - Wizard of Oz [MT]\n\n\"Gee\" - The Crows [CB]\n\n\"Duke of Earl\" - Gene Chandler [HS]\n\n\"Sixteen Candles\" - The Crests [PF]\n\n\"Come and Go With Me\" - The Dell Vikings [MT]\n\n\"Blue Moon\" - The Marcells [MT]\n\n\"He's in the Jailhouse Now\" - Webb Pierce [CB]\n\n\"Get a Job\" - The Silhouettes [MT]\n\n\"Remember (Walking in the Sand)\" - The Shangri Las [MT]\n\n\"See You Later Aligator\" - Bill Haley [MT]\n\n\"Dig\" - Nervous Norvus [FT] (this is so cool!)\n\n\"Gravy\" - Dee Dee Sharp [HS]\n\n\"Do the New Continental\" - the Dovells [HS]\n\n\"God Bless America\" - Kate Smith [MM] - I could use a better copy, though.\n\n\"Flying Saucer (1 & 2)\" - Buchanan and Goodman [MT]\n\n\"Whole Lotta Shaking Going On\" - Jerry Lee Lewis [MT]\n\n\"Western Movies\" - The Olympics [MT] (JW used the gunshot sounds)\n\n\"Goin' Out of My Head\" - Little Anthony and the Imperials\n\n\"No Particular Place to Go\" - Chuck Berry [MT]\n\n\"Trouble\" - Elvis Presley [MT]\n\n\"I Got Stung\" - Elvis Presley [MT]\n\n\"Rumble\" - Link Wray [MT]\n\n\"Sh-Boom\" - The Crew Cuts [CBR]\n\n\"Mr. Sandman\" - The Chordettes [CBR]\n\n\"Leader of the Pack\" - The Shangri Las [MT]\n\n\"Little Bitty Pretty One\" - Thurston Harris [MT]\n\n\"Tutti Fruitti (Live)\" - Little Richard [MT]\n\n\"Long Tall Sally (LIVE)\" - Little Richard [MT]\n\n\"Rip It Up\" - Elvis Presley [MT]\n\n\"The Angels Listened In\" - The Crests [MT]\n\n\"Ricochet\" - Teresa Brewer [MT]\n\n\"I Want You To Be My Girl\" - Frankie Lymon [MT]\n\n\"What'd I Say (1 and 2)\" - Ray Charles [MT]\n\n\"Sitting In the Park\" - Billy Stewart [MT]\n\n\"Along Came Jones\" - The Coasters [MT]\n\n\"These Boots Are Made For Walking\" - Nancy Sinatra [used in one of the early movies, like Eat Your Makeup or Roman Candles]\n\nThis list used to have more songs from \"Pink Flamingos,\" but then JW came out with a \"PF\" soundtrack album. When songs appeared on that album, I crossed them off my list. (Examples: \"The Swag,\" \"I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent,\" \"How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,\" etc.)\n\nSONGS I STILL NEED (A LOT!!!!!)\n\nWell, as a general rule, I need everything that was used in a JW movie and which DOESN'T appear on the list above. There are tons of them in Hairspray and Cry Baby. Just scan the closing credits and spot any song that doesn't appear on my list. And remember, with Cry Baby, I also want the songs that the musical numbers were BASED on. With \"Sh-Boom\" I chose the Crew Cuts' version because the movie version is clearly patterned after that arrangment of the song. All of the musical numbers in CB are based on real songs from the 50s. Plus, there are songs used as background score in the film. (In Cry Baby, they listen to a song called something like \"Women and Cadillacs\" on the car radio.)\n\nWith the early movies, I can't always identify the songs -- like the twangy instrumental that plays at the beginning of Multiple Maniacs. And sometimes,he uses little snippets of obscure songs I can't identify... especially in Mondo Trasho.\n\nSongs I *KNOW* I need...\n\n\"Strangers in the Night\" - Frank Sinatra [MT]\n\n\"Tomorrow\" - Annie (the MOVIE soundtrack, not the Broadway) [SM]\n\n\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" [MT] - this version is by a female pop singer, but it is NOT Brenda Lee's version! The version JW uses is slower and more Muzak-y.\n\n\"He's Got the Whole World In His Hand\" [MM] - I have the version by Laurie London but it just doesn't sound like the version he uses in Multiple Maniacs\n\n\"Take a Number from One to Ten\" - Lyda Roberti [MT] (this is a really obscure oldie from a movie called College Rhythm)\n\n\"I'm Following You\" - ??? [MT]\n\n\"Holy Holy Holy\" - ??? [MT]\n\nLike I said, there are ton of missing songs in Hairspray and Cry-Baby. The 25th anniversary version of Pink Flamingos has the songs listed in the closing credits. Scan those for missing music.\n\nOf course, I'm also looking for the classical music JW has used. In the case of classical music, I don't particularly care if it's the exact right version, since classical pieces tend to be recorded by dozens and dozens of different orchestras... just as long as it sounds close to the version JW used.\n\nSONGS I ALREADY HAVE (CLASSICAL)\n\n\"Pomp and Circumstance\" [MT]\n\n\"Rite of Spring\" [MT, PFO]\n\n\"Ride of the Valkyries\" [MT]\n\nSONGS I NEED (CLASSICAL)\n\nBeethoven's Fifth Symphony (first movement) [MT]\n\nMarche Slave (sp?) [MT]\n\nSOME CLASSICAL MUSIC I CAN'T IDENTIFY\n\nThe music that plays during the \"shrimping\"/\"Cinderella\" scene in MT\n\nThe opera aria that plays as MVP stumbles out of the woods in MT\n\nWhat music plays when Divine smashes car windows at the end of Multiple Maniacs?\n\nI've given up hope of finding a decent recording of the Female Trouble theme or any of the songs from Polyester by Debbie Harry, Tab Hunter, Chris Stein, Bill Murray, etc. The best I can do is to dub copies of those songs off the movies. Maybe JW will do a Female Trouble album when that movie is reissued. He said he once had plans to do a Polyester album for Rhino Records, but the deal fell through. Maybe someday...\n\n--Joe--\n\nSIDEBAR: Joe has recently made a more complete list of the music from MONDO TRASHO - which is esentially a silent film set to the following songs:\n\nsymbols\n\n[x] item I already own\n\n[?] item I cannot identify at all\n\n[-] item I do not own yet\n\n[/] artist unknown; partial identification\n\n[~] guesswork\n\nPROLOGUE / CREDITS\n\n[x] \"Jack the Ripper\" -
