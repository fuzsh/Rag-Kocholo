        "text": "Wasn't Timur's wife also descended from or in some way closely connected to the line of Genghiz?\n\nThe post number 11 by candy321wolf that you quote give the lineage of Babur as:\n\nBabur, son of Umer Sheikh Mirza, son of Abu Said Mirza, son of Muhammad Mirza, son of Miran Shah Mirza, son of Temur.\n\nSo the mothers of Babur and each of his partrilineal ancestors would be important to find out whether Babur had a descent from Genghis Khan or a relative of Genghis Khan. And I note that since they were all Muslims, it is a little silly to assume that each of them was the son of \"the wife\" of their father. Rich and powerful Muslim men sometimes had many as four fives at a time, and there are many examples of the heirs of Muslim rulers being the sons their father's slave women.\n\nPost number 11 by candy321wolf that you quote also gives the descent of Babur's mother from Genghis Khan.\n\nBabur's matrilineal descent from Chinggis Khan can be traced as follows: Babur, son of Qutluq Niqar Khanum, daughter of Yunis Khan, son of Wais Khan, son of Sher Ali Khan, son of Muhammad Khan, son of Khizr Khoja Khan, son of Tughluq Temur Khan, son of Esen Buqa Khan, son of Dua Khan, son of Baraq Khan, son of Yesuntoa, son of Mutukan, son of Chaghatai Khan, son of Chinggis Khan.\n\nSo that establishes that one of the mother's of one of Babur's patrilineal ancestors back to Timur was reportedly descended from Genghis Khan.\n\nSince you mentioned \"Timur's wife\" specifically, your question can be answered by finding the ancestry of the mother of Miran Shah Mirza, son of Temur (Timur).\n\nAccording to Wickipedia, Timur's 43 wives and conqubines included his senior wife Saray Mulk Khanum (c. 1341-1408) widow of Amir Husayn, killed by Timur, and daughter of Qazan Khan ibn Yasur, the Chagati Khan from 1343-1346. Her being the daugher of a Genghisid Khan gve Timur the title of Gurgan or son-in-law of a Genghisid Khan.\n\nAnother wife, Tukal Khanaum, was the daugher of Khizr Khoja Khan or Khizr Khwaja Khan, the Khan of mogulistan from 1390 to 1399. He was descended from Chagatai son of Genghis Khan, being an ancestor of Babur's maternal grandfather Yunus khan.\n\nSaray did not have any children with Timur,[17] though she is sometimes referred to as the mother of her husband's youngest son, Shahrukh Mirza, who was actually born of a concubine. Even if Saray had any children with her husband, they did not survive, and neither did Tukal-Khanum's, and yet their power and influence were well noted by foreign visitors to the Court. It was the two Chingisid princesses' personal qualities and pedigree that allowed them to develop a such a prestigious dynastic position, since with Timurid consorts maternity was not in itself a path to power.[18] Upon the birth of Shahrukh's eldest son, Ulugh Beg, in 1394, he was also, like his father, placed in Saray's care and grew up under the supervision of the Empress.[19]\n\nSaray Mulk Khanum - Wikipedia\n\nMiran Shan Mirza was not the the son of eighter Saray Mulk Khanum or Tukal Khanum.\n\nMiran Shah was born in 1366, the third of Timur's four sons. His mother was a concubine, Mengli Khatun, daughter of Hayut of the Jauni Qurban tribe.[3]\n\nMiran Shah - Wikipedia\n\nBabur's father was Umar Shaikh Mirza:\n\nUmar Shaikh Mirza II (Persian: عمر شیخ میرزا, b. 1456 – d. 1494) was the ruler of the Fergana Valley. He was the fourth son of Abu Sa'id Mirza, the Emperor of the Timurid Empire in what is now Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and eastern Iran.\n\nUmar Shaikh's mother was not explicitly named in any historical sources, including the Baburnama, his son Babur's autobiography. This was somewhat unusual, as Babur provided the maternal ancestry for many of his prominent relatives. However, Babur did refer multiple times to a certain Shah Sultan Begum (d. 1501) in a way that suggested she was Umar Shaikh's mother.[3] This identification is one that is used by historians.[4]\n\nShah Sultan Begum's own background was never stated. However, Khwand Amir, the vizier of Babur's uncle Sultan Mahmud, referred to Umar Shaikh as \"the own younger brother\" of Mahmud and Sultan Ahmed. If this wording were interpreted to say that they were full brothers, this would mean that Shah Sultan Begum was mother to all three rulers, and thus the daughter of Aurdu-Bugha Tarkhan Arghun, who is known to have been Ahmad and Mahmud's maternal grandfather.[5]\n\nUmar Shaikh Mirza II - Wikipedia\n\nUmar Shaikh's father was Abu Sa'id Mirza who reunited much of Timur's empire.\n\nAbu Sa'id Mirza was born in 1424, the second son of the Timurid prince Muhammad Mirza by his wife Shah Islam. His father was a son of Miran Shah, himself the third son of Timur. His mother was the daughter of Suhrab Kurd and a relative of Izz al-din Shir of Hakkari, who was a former adversary of Timur's.[1][2]\n\nAbu Sa'id Mirza - Wikipedia\n\nAbu Sa'id Mirza was a son of Muhammed Mirza:\n\nSultan Muhammad Mirza (Persian: محمد میرزا) was a Timurid prince and grandson of the Central Asian conqueror Timur by his third son Miran Shah. Little is known about his life, though through his son Sultan Abu Sa'id Mirza, he was the great-grandfather of Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire of India.\n\nMuhammad Mirza was the sixth son of Miran Shah, himself the third son of Timur.[1] According to Abu'l Fazl, the Grand Vizier of his descendant Akbar, Muhammad Mirza's mother was Mihr Nush of the Fulad Qiya tribe.[2][note 1] Orientalist Henry Beveridge stated that, while he does not know of this tribe, the fact that Muhammad Mirza is described as always living with his brother Khalil Sultan suggests that the two were likely full-siblings.[4] This would imply that 'Mihr Nush' was an alternate name for Khalil Sultan's mother Khanzada Begum, the daughter of Aq Sufi Qunqirat of Khwarezm and granddaughter of Jani Beg, Khan of the Golden Horde.[5]\n\nMuhammad Mirza - Wikipedia\n\nIf Muhammed Mirza wa the son of Khanzada Begum, he would have a descent from Genghis Khan thorugh her:\n\nKhanzada was a member of the Sufi Dynasty, descended from the Mongol Qongirat tribe. Her parents were the nobleman Aq Sufi and his wife, the Mongol princess Shakar Beg. Though originally named Sevin Beg, Khanzada received her more famous nickname (literally meaning \"born of a Khan\")[3] in reference to her maternal grandfather, the Khan of the Golden Horde, Jani Beg, a descendant of Genghis Khan.[4][5]\n\nSevin Beg Khanzada - Wikipedia\n\nJani Beg was descended from Jochi, a son of Genghis Khan.\n\nJani Beg - Wikipedia\n\nTimur claimed to be a male lineage cousin of Genghis Khan:\n\nTimur - Wikipedia\n\nThrough his father, Timur claimed to be a descendant of Tumanay Khan, a male-line ancestor he shared with Genghis Khan.[18] Tumanay's great-great-grandson Qarachar Noyan was a minister for the emperor who later assisted the latter's son Chagatai in the governorship of Transoxiana.[30][31] Though there are not many mentions of Qarachar in 13th and 14th century records, later Timurid sources greatly emphasized his role in the early history of the Mongol Empire.[32][33] These histories also state that Genghis Khan later established the \"bond of fatherhood and sonship\" by marrying Chagatai's daughter to Qarachar.[34] Through his alleged descent from this marriage, Timur claimed kinship with the Chagatai Khans.[35]\n\nThe origins of Timur's mother, Tekina Khatun, are less clear. The Zafarnama merely states her name without giving any information regarding her background. Writing in 1403, Johannes de Galonifontibus, Archbishop of Sultaniyya, claimed that she was of lowly origin.[30] The Mu'izz al-Ansab, written decades later, says that she was related to the Yasa'uri tribe, whose lands bordered that of the Barlas.[36] Ibn Khaldun recounted that Timur himself described to him his mother's descent from the legendary Persian hero Manuchehr.[37] Ibn Arabshah suggested that she was a descendant of Genghis Khan.[20] The 18th century Books of Timur identify her as the daughter of 'Sadr al-Sharia', which is believed to refer to the Hanafi scholar Ubayd Allah al-Mahbubi of Bukhara.[38]\n\nTimur - Wikipedia\n\nThus Timur might have had a female line descent from Genghis Khan and a paternal line cousinship to Genghis Khan."
