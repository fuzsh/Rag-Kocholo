        "text": "Herat (Persian: هرات, Herāt) is the third largest city of Afghanistan with about 436,300 people living in it as of 2012.436,300 as of 2012. It is the capital of a Herat province. It is in the west of the country, close to the border of Iran. The spoken language in the city is called Herati Persian or just Herati.\n\nHistory\n\nHerat dates back to very old times. Avesta, the old book of Zoroastrianism mentions Herat as \"Haroyu\" and lists it as the sixth land of the sixteen perfect lands created by Ahura Mazda, the Zoroastrian god. In Achaemenid times (ca. 550-330 BC), the surrounding district was known as \"Haraiva\" (in Old Persian). Ancient Greeks called it \"Aria\" and \"Artacoana\" was the capital of Aria. Alexander the Great took Artacoana in 330 BC and destroyed it. He later built another city near Artacoana and named it \"Alexandria in Ariana\", today's city of Herat. After him Parthians and Sassanians took over. Sassanians called the city “Harēv”.\n\nArabs took Herat in 660 AD, and it became a center of the Muslim world. Herat has a long history as a centre for sufism, the mystical branch of Islam. It became part of the area then known as Khurasan, which reached its peak of civilization in the twelfth century. In 1221 AD, it was taken by the Mongols and later destroyed by Genghis Khan and Timur, the Turkic conqueror, took it in about 1393 AD. Herat’s greatest era was during the Timurid rule, when it was a centre of science and culture. As the capital of the Timurid empire, it boasted many fine religious buildings and was famous for its sumptuous court life and musical performance and its tradition of miniature paintings. Later Persians and Afghans fought over the control of the city and Herat changed hands several times before it (under British interference) permanently became part of Afghanistan in 1857 under the Treaty of Paris.\n\nIn March 1979, an anti-Communist uprising in Herat, left 25,000 civilian deaths. Between 1978 and 1992, communist forces in Herat city fought resistance forces holding the countryside. In 1995 the area came under the control of Pashtuns of the Taliban movement. After the United States' invasion of Afghanistan, on November 12, 2001, it was liberated from the Taliban by the Northern Alliance. These days, unlike other places in Afghanistan, Herat is safer.\n\nImages for kids\n\nReconstruction of Ptolemy's map (2nd century AD) of Aria (Herat) and neighbouring states by the 15th century German cartographer Nicolaus Germanus\n\nCoin of Bahram II; Herat mint\n\nInside the famous Friday Mosque of Herat or Masjid Jami, which is one of the oldest mosques in Afghanistan.\n\nHigh-spouted brass ewer, from Herat, Seljuk period (AD 1180-1200).\n\nAnother identical ewer in the British Museum\n\nBattleground of Timur and Egyptian King, by Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād Herawī, a famous painter from Herat, c. 1494–1495, Timurid era\n\nPage of calligraphy in nasta'liq script by the 16th century master calligrapher Mir Ali Heravi\n\nBrass cup or tankard, Timurid period, 15th century A.D., from Herāt.\n\nHerati Soldiers 1879\n\n1 Qiran Coin of Naser al-Din Qajar; Herat mint, 1861\n\nBazaar of Herat, 1973\n\nAfghan rugs in Herat, 1977\n\nView of Herat, 2011\n\nAfghan and U.S. government officials along with members of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) at Herat International Airport in 2012.\n\nMinarets visible from the distance, 1975\n\nAn area of Herat\n\nMuseum inside the Herat Citadel, locally referred to as Qala Ikhtyaruddin or Arg.\n\nGawhar Shad Mausoleum from the Timurid period.\n\nThe Information Technology and Engineering Facility at Herat University.\n\nSection of Herat\n\nSchool girls in Herat\n\nHerat International Airport\n\nTraffic passing on the road near the Herat minarets, 2005.\n\nThe two mausoleums with the minarets, July 2001.\n\nOutside the Shrine of Gazar Gah, c. 1939\n\nU.S. Consulate in Herat\n\nLandmark at a traffic circle\n\nShopping center\n\nPol-e Mālān, a historical bridge\n\nPillar of Musallah Complex\n\nKhwājah Abdullāh Ansārī shrine, a Sufi of the 11th century\n\nGazar Gah cemetery\n\nTomb of Jāmi, a poet of the 15th century\n\nThe Jewish cemetery\n\nSee also"
