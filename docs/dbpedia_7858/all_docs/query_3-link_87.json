        "text": "Our Muslim World paper is on the Ottoman Empire. This paper is also on a leader that was called “Timur the Lame”. The Ottoman Empire was known as the “Turkish Empire” or the “Ottoman Turkey”. In this paper you will find out how the two stories meet up and how they greatly affected one another. Timurid empire was led by Timur the Lame. Both empires were located right by each other in Persia and Central Asia. These two empires both ran An absolute Monarchy as a their Government. The term Ottoman is\n\ncenturies and was in the memory of Timur. Timur, “A Barlas Turk of common birth, he rose from Central Asia to conquer territories in Anatolia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, India, and Russia, and was on his way to subjugate China when he died.” Timerlane, a cruel conqueror who created destruction on a continent hadn 't recovered from the Mongol invasion. Timur was honored as the charismatic “Lord of Conjunction” and a central object of admiration for later Muslim sovereigns. Timur was idolized for centuries as a\n\nTimur was referred to by many names coming from many different people. The name Tamerlane was derived from the Persian Timur-i lane, he was called Temur the lame by Europeans, and his Turkic name was Timur which means iron. He has also conquered more than any other person in the world except for Alexander. Timur was born in the city of Kesh in 1336. His father was a lesser chief of the nomadic Barlas tribe. Timur claimed he was a direct descendant from Genghis Khan through the house of one of his\n\nEmperor Timur-i Leng between 1399 and 1404 in Samarkand, present day Uzbekistan. Emperor Timur remarkably expanded his small tribe into the Timurid Dynasty, which lasted from 1370 to 1507. Timur showed great leadership skills and also had an interest in architecture. The results of his artistic interests are especially apparent in Samarkand, the capital of the Timurids during Timur’s reign where art, architecture, and culture flourished. The Bibi Khanum exemplifies the vision that Timur held for\n\ntraveler and writer. In 1403-06 he was sent as an ambassador to the court of Timur, founder and ruler of Timurid Empire, by the Henry III of Castile. The original intention of the journey was to meet Timur in his winter pasturage in Qarabagh what is now modern Georgia, but due to the bad weather they were forced to return back to Constantinople to spend the winter. Then they continued their travel, but were unable to catch up Timur because of his rapid moving, so they had to follow his way till\n\ndialect was a mixture of Turkish and Persian. The Ottomans were speakers of Oghuz Turkish who descended from Oghuz Khan. The Safavids were Aq Quyunlu Turks who spoke Azeri Turkish, and the Mughals were speakers of Changatai Turkish who descended from Timur Khan. The three great empires were highly\n\nShahrisabz stands for the ‘The City of Green’. It was once a major city located in southern Uzbekistan, and is primarily known as the birthplace of the prominent conqueror, Amir Timur. However, it is known to me as the birthplace of my mother's father, and his fathers before him. At the age of 15, my grandfather was forced to leave when the threat of a communist takeover by Soviet Russia was imminent. From there he migrated to Afghanistan and later to America. Sadly, not all of his family is was\n\nhimself alone. Tamburlaine was considered to be a one-man play because each of Tamburlaine’s own speeches and those of his admirers or his defeated adversaries have the same purpose: to explore and to exhibit the nature of the qualities the historical Timur seemed to illustrate. This happens even in the “conversion speeches.” When Theridamas takes the field against him with a large army and appears before him to talk to him, Tamburlaine succeeds by the persuasive power of his words in shaking his loyalty\n\nthe north-east. His decision making skills kept giving him the clear way to success. (b) Intelligence. Taimur Lung was blessed with extraordinary intelligence not only intuitively but also intellectually. He was a big supporter of arts, Timur grouped artists and scholars from throughout central Asia to his court in Samarkand. He ordered grand mosques built in his birthplace, Kesh, in Yasi, Turkistan, and Samarkand. In his rule the Turkic language, Chagatay, spoken in central Asia became\n\nThe Ottoman and Mughal empires were two of the greatest and most successful empires to ever form in history. However, they both had some similarities as well as differences. Both empires went through tough periods of time, but at some point they also went through times of growth and prosperity. Although the Ottoman and Mughal Empire both did not force conversions into Islam, the Ottoman’s development relied on their tough military force, while the decline of the Mughal Empire was caused by Aurangzeb’s"
