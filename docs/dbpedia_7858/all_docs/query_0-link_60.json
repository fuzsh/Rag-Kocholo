        "meta_description": "The 15th-century Islamic world, having recovered from the devastating effects of Mongol invasion and rule, was a period which witnessed a number of significant shifts in the cultural, political, and religious spheres. With the termination of the `Abbasid caliphate at the hands of the Mongols, a number of dynasties emerged in this period of the 15th century who rivaled one another with respect to legitimacy and religio-political supremacy. While the Mamluks and the Ottomans were emerging in the Islamic west, the Islamic east was dominated by the Timurid empire - the successors to Timur - which had been initially based out of Samarqand in Central Asia, and later ruled from the city of Herat in eastern Khurasan (present-day Afghanistan). The Timurids were especially known for the development and promotion of intellectual, scientific, and artistic networks, and Timurid-governed cities like Shiraz, Mashhad and Herat rose as Islamic cosmopolitan cultural centers to rival counterparts in the Islamic west, like Cairo, Baghdad, and Istanbul. However, by the mid-to-late 15th century, the Timurid empire was increasingly beset with internal tensions and crises. This panel is dedicated to focusing on various aspects of these crises - political, spiritual, and courtly.",
