Iâve come to think of libraries as playing a crucial role as âsecond responders.â\n\nIn Ferguson, Missouri, the public library stayed open when the schools were closed after the riots, to offer the kids a safe place and even classes taught by volunteers. After the hurricanes in Houston, some library websites were immediately up and running, announcing that they were open for business. After Hurricane Sandy, some libraries in New Jersey became places of refuge.\n\nAnd in the Queens Libraryâs Far Rockaway branch, which didnât have heat or light, the librarians set up shop in the parking lot to continue childrenâs story hours âto give them a sense of normalcy,â says Christian Zabriskie, who was a Queens librarian then.\n\nRead More\n\n2:50 PM ET\n\nOur Towns: On the Road, in the Air\n\nIn the summer of 2013, nearly six years ago, my wife—Deb Fallows—and I announced in this space theâ¦ Read More\n\n7:30 AM ET\n\nFresno, CA\n\nA Company That Helps You Find Job B\n\nThe tech-training and incubator company Bitwise, based in Fresno in California’s agricultural Central Valley, has been an important test caseâ¦ Read More\n\n7:00 AM ET\n\nBitwise Goes Big\n\nFour years ago, my wife, Deb, and I wrote about an ambitious and unusual tech startup called Bitwise Industries, in the gritty and long-struggling city of Fresno in Californiaâs Central Valley.\n\nFor an introduction to Bitwise and its co-founders, Irma L.

It looks like another storefront, opening onto a sidewalk with overhead construction scaffolding, as with so many buildings in New York City these days. I have visited many, many public libraries around the U.S., but I had never visited a braille library. So when Jim, my husband, and I happened to be in New York City in early June, I grabbed the chance and took Jim with me. We saw sighted and blind people enteringâmoms pushing strollers, younger people who looked like students, older people coming to bide their time.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nA Different Kind of Civil-Service Organization\n\nThe U.S. national government is failing in its response to the pandemic.

Educational innovation, promotion of new industries and creation of fairer opportunities, absorption of new arrivals (in growing communities) and retaining existing talent (in shrinking ones), reform of policing and prison practices, equitable housing and transportation policies, offsets to addiction and homelessness and other widespread problems, environmental sustainabilityâthese and just about every other issue you can think of are the subjects of countless simultaneous experiments going on across the country.\n\nRead More\n\n10:10 AM ET\n\nThe Gift of a Public Library\n\nAndrew Carnegie was the force of Gilded Age philanthropy behind the building of public libraries. Along with other recognizable names who made their fortune in the late 1800s and early 1900sâRockefeller, Ford, Mellon, Morgan, Stanford, Harriman, HeinzâCarnegieâs influence endures today largely because of the way he gave away the vast fortune he amassed.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nFlying Down East\n\nWe were flying away from Washington D.C. again, leaving the Sturm und Drang of our hometown in early August for a point nearly as far east on the U.S. map as one can get.

This one was the first ever rural womenâs summit.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nDayton, OH\n\nThe Gem City Moves Forward\n\nAlmost every trend affecting modern America is on display in Dayton. It was one of the earliest, and hardest-hit, centers of the opioid disaster. Its economy, plausibly known as Americaâs âinvention capitalâ in the early 1900s, as the home of the Wright brothers and with the highest-number of patents per capita, has been hurt even more than other midwestern citiesâ by the demise and departure of big firms.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nEllenville, NY\n\nThe New Approach to Local Journalism\n\nHere’s another installment in the ongoing series on how local news operations, especially newspapers, can devise new ways to stayâ¦ Read More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nPittsburgh, PA\n\nA River of Words in Pittsburgh\n\nAs weâve traveled around the country with our American Futures and Our Towns projects since 2013, my husband, Jim, and I have evolved from being skeptics to evangelists about the impact of public arts on communities. We have seen how townsâ self-image, their presentation to visitors, their marking of history or current experience, their civic engagement and quality of everyday life and interactions of residents can all be changed by the public arts.\n\nRead More\n\n9:32 AM ET\n\nHarvard, MA\n\nâWeâre Doing It for Love of Communityâ\n\nDo local public-radio stations play an important role? In big cities, from Boston and Washington to San Francisco and L.A.? In small towns, like those across Mississippi or Alaska or Maine? Do they matter in the South as well as the North? In inland states as well as those on the coast?\n\nAll the evidence Iâm aware of, anecdotal and statistical, suggests that in every one of these places, the answer is a clear and obvious yes. Public radio matters; it matters all the more in remote and rural areas farther from other news outlets; and it is seen as mattering in a way that transcends normal regional or political dividing lines.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nIndianapolis, IN\n\nRebuilding After Incarceration\n\nMore than 2 million Americans are in the countryâs prisons and jails now, giving the United States both the largest number of prisoners and the highest per-capita incarceration rate in the world. For the U.S., the rate is well over 700 prisoners for each 100,000 of population. According to a recent BBC report, the only close contender is Russia, with an imprisonment rate of over 600 per 100,000 population. Most other developed countries are far behindâor ahead, in social-welfare terms. The rate for England and Wales, for instance, is under 150 prisoners per 100,000 population. Mexicoâs rate is about 200 per 100,000. China, with a national population four times larger than Americaâs, has fewer total prisoners (at least according to official reports).\n\nRead More\n\n1:08 PM ET\n\nHow Art Can Renew a Community\n\nThis is No. 2 in a series of three videos from our friends at New America about the realities ofâ¦ Read More\n\n12:49 PM ET\n\nBuilding Your Future in Indiana\n\nThis spring, Deb Fallows and I made a trip through Indiana for a series of events and meetings co-organized byâ¦ Read More\n\n2:02 PM ET\n\nNashville, TN\n\nA Big Little Idea From Nashville\n\nDuring our travels visiting towns and cities across the country for American Futures and now Our Towns, Jim Fallowsâ¦ Read More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nDanville, VA\n\nâLessons From Danvilleâ\n\nThis summer, Deb Fallows and I visited the southern-Virginia town of Danville, and the surrounding rural areas of Pittsylvania County,â¦ Read More\n\n2:33 PM ET\n\nThree Big Lessons From One Small Town\n\nHere is another look at the far-southern-Virginia town of Danville: once a thriving tobacco-and-textile center, now trying to figure out what to do after all the mills have shut down.\n\nRead More\n\n9:28 AM ET\n\nA Regional Approach to Rural Health Challenges\n\nWe began the first morning of our recent visit to Danville, Virginia, at an early-bird breakfast with the Rotary Club, where my husband, Jim, and I heard several personal hopes, celebrations, and notes of gratitude from its members, as they pitched bills into the Happy Dollars bucket. One Happy Dollar for good wishes to a son about to deploy with the military; another for a granddaughter, a rainbow baby (Google that), who had made it to her first birthday; two for the boys whom the mom had hauled out of bed to come to the breakfast on their first day of summer vacation.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nHow Danville Has Avoided Omahaâs Mistake\n\nTwo previous reports, first here and then here, described the bittersweet heritage of old tobacco and textile buildings in the former mill town of Danville, Virginia.\n\nThe bitter was obviously the loss of what had been the cityâs economic mainstays. The potentially sweet was that Danville never got around to demolishing the old structuresâand now is beginning to turn them to new use.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nThe Reinvention of Danvilleâs Downtown: Part 1\n\nFactory towns face problems when the factories shut down. Everyone has heard versions of that storyâinvolving steel and auto plants in the Midwest, sawmills in the Northwest, coal mines in Appalachia or copper mines in the Southwest, other facilities in other towns.\n\nOn a recent visit to Southside Virginiaâthe part of the state bordering North Carolina, and far from the tech-and-government-driven boom of the D.C. suburbs in northern Virginia and the military-based economy of Norfolk and the Tidewaterâwe were reminded of the problems cities had even when those factories were up and running. We also learned about the way they are trying to apply the mixed blessings of a lost manufacturing heritage as they figure out their next act.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nA Community Within a Community\n\nDuring our years of reporting for Our Towns, Iâve visited YMCAs all across the country. My quest began as a way to keep fit while traveling. I bought day passes to swim in Burlington, Vermont; Columbus, Mississippi; Redlands, California; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Duluth, Minnesota; and Wichita, Kansas.\n\nIf I couldnât find a Y, I would swim at a local public pool, like in Holland, Michigan; Greenville, South Carolina; Dodge City, Kansas; Winters, California; and Bend, Oregon. As a last resort, I turned to nature, jumping into the Snake River in Clarkston, Washington; Lake Champlain in Vermont; Lake Erie in Erie, Pennsylvania; Lake Michigan in Holland, Michigan; the freezing Atlantic in Portland, Maine; and the also-freezing Pacific along the West Coast.\n\nRecently I added another venue to my list: the YMCA of Danville, in the so-called Southside of Virginia, bordering North Carolina.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nProvincetown, MA\n\nThereâs Hope for Local Journalism\n\nEveryone knows that local newspapers are in trouble. Thatâs why Deb Fallows and I have been chronicling examples of smaller papers that have bucked the economic trendâin Mississippi, in coastal Maine, in rural communities across the country.\n\nBut what âeveryone knowsâ about the main source of the problem may be wrongâor misleading enough to divert attention away from a possible solution.\n\nRead More\n\n4:02 PM ET\n\nWinston-Salem, NC\n\nThe Library Thatâs Also an Art Gallery\n\nWhen it came to planning the new public library for downtown Winston-Salem, the people of the city had a lot to say, from the visionary to the practical. The library should âmake an important statementâ and âbe a place for the public to be together,â Nan La Rosee, the central operations manager of the Forsyth County Public Library, told me during a recent visit.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nTraverse City, MI\n\nThe Power of a Community College\n\nLast week I reported on a conference of community-college leaders that Deb Fallows and I attended in Michigan, and aboutâ¦ Read More\n\n12:28 PM ET\n\nThe Choices Facing Community Colleges\n\nAmerica is in the middle of another news emergency, about crises that are genuinely important.

The library story began modestly at the end of the 19th century, with the personal collection of Irish-born U.S. Army Captain William Kelly, who had settled in Brownsville and become a renowned businessman, proponent of Brownsvilleâs first public schools, and a civic activist. His daughter Geraldine recollected later in the Brownsville Herald, âHe had a very fine library, which he used continually and loved.â\n\nRead More\n\n3:54 PM ET\n\nâA River, Not a Borderâ: Report From Brownsville\n\nBrownsville is the southernmost U.S. border town with Mexico, down at the very tip of the map of Texas.

Or, Fresno had some creative ideas that had a big impact on its schools, but how can that scale?\n\nRead More\n\n12:48 PM ET\n\nWest Point, MS\n\nHow a âCommuniversityâ Works\n\nHereâs a difference between the world of national politics and that of public problem-solving at the local and regional levels. Four or five years ago, I would have had no idea of this. Now I notice it practically every day.\n\nIn national politics, terms like partnership or collaboration are hard to utter with a straight face, or a non-sinking heart. At best, they can seem boring or (damning with faint praise) âworthy.â At worst, they seem like euphemisms for sweetheart deals or favor-trading.\n\nRead More\n\n6:00 AM ET\n\nWhat David Halberstam Learned in Mississippi\n\nIn 1981, the writer David Halberstam published a memoir in Esquire magazine, with the headline âStarting Out to be a Famous Reporter.â\n\nAt the time Halberstam was well-known enough that the storyâs title would have seemed both mildly self-mocking and accurately descriptive. Heâd come to national prominence while still in his 20s through skeptical and award-winning New York Times reporting from Vietnam.\n\nRead More\n\n11:11 AM ET\n\nAngola, IN\n\nAn Engineering School Pulls Off an âEpic Trick Playâ\n\nLast month we wrote about the surprising partnership in Angola, Indiana between a city-redevelopment movement, which has brought new life and activity to a historic small-city downtown, and the adjoining Trine University, which has had an extremely high success rate in placing its graduates in jobs or advanced-degree programs.\n\nOver the past two decades, smaller private universities across the country, especially those far from major cities, have struggled to attract students and keep their doors open. But as detailed here, in those two decades Trine has quadrupled its enrollment, and it claims that graduates leave with an average student-debt burden of less than $30,000.\n\nRead More\n\n2:55 PM ET\n\nA Community Finding a Path Forward\n\nLast month we traveled by car through several cities in Indiana, in a project organized jointly by New America Indianapolis, where our main partner was Molly Martin, and Indiana Humanities, as part of their new two-year-long INseparable program intended to foster conversations across the usual partisan divides. There we worked mainly with the IH director Keira Amstutz and the community-engagement director Leah Nahmias.

In the latest dispatch, I described the way a committed English teacher at MSMS, Thomas Easterling, was âteaching students to thinkâ through a rigorous analysis of the novel Dirty Work, by the renowned Mississippi writer Larry Brown.\n\nRead More\n\n4:30 PM ET\n\nHow to Teach Students to Think\n\nThe only thing traditional about Thomas Easterlingâs 11th-grade English class at the Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science (MSMS) was his short quiz at the start of the class. It was the last of the year, he told his students, and I guessed that this was his way to keep the kids focused on their final assignment.\n\nIt may also have been a nudge toward the good habit of reading, for a generation of students with Netflix always at their fingertips. They scrambled beyond their laptops for bits of paper to write their answers on and handed them to Easterling, who assembled a messy little stack.\n\nRead More\n\n10:09 AM ET\n\nThe Last Family-Owned Daily in Mississippi\n\nAs mentioned in the kickoff post in this new âOur Townsâ series, anyone who cares about Americaâs civic, cultural, and economic future should care about the fate of the local press.\n\nJournalism everywhere is coping with a variety of well-known stresses. The pressure to adapt, while there could still be time to survive, is especially intense on smaller, local outlets that may be the only source of community-wide information and accountability in their locale.\n\nRead More\n\n10:57 AM ET\n\nOn Emancipation Day, Back to Mississippi\n\nFive years ago today, Deb Fallows and I were in Columbus, Mississippi, to observe the commemoration of Emancipation Day held in the cemetery there.

Here are two illustrations, from opposite sides of the country, of the way national policies of the moment are affecting local efforts weâve chronicled over the years. One is from the rich farmland of California; the other, from a challenged city in industrial Pennsylvania.\n\nRead More\n\n2:10 PM ET\n\nFort Wayne, IN\n\nDead Malls, Everywhere\n\nOne more installment on the question of whether an unloved and unsightly part of Americaâs infrastructureâthe giant sprawl-malls that drained business from classic downtowns in the 1960s and 1970s, only to become bankrupt dinosaurs in their turnâmight actually become the sites of civic and architectural rebirth.\n\nThe original post, about Fort Wayne, Indiana, was here; followed by this (partial) defense of malls; and this elaboration on what is happening to malls around the country.\n\nRead More\n\n10:07 AM ET\n\nDead Malls, Reborn Cities\n\nWe can all think of things that have gotten worse about journalism, in the era of continual distraction and internet-borne hysteria and info silos.\n\nHereâs something Iâve continued to appreciate as an improvement, ever since The Atlantic became one of the first publications to establish an online presence back in 1995.\n\nRead More\n\n3:40 PM ET\n\nWhat Happens to Abandoned Malls?\n\nIn a report last week from Fort Wayne, Indiana, I noted what I considered the mid-century tragedy of big,â¦ Read More\n\n10:00 AM ET\n\nFort Wayne Makes Its Own Luck\n\nToday’s theme: what happens to buildings, after they die.
