        "text": "Be still, dear wild dancing heart! I chide it that it‚Äôs being ridiculous. I am no novice traveller. I have travelled all my life, been to countless countries, places many have not even heard of.\n\n‚ÄúBut this is the first time to the Minaret of Jam,‚Äù it whispers gleefully.\n\nYes, true. And I let it dance away, and smile at it fondly. If it were not for this crazy heart of mine, I would be leading a pretty dull life.\n\nDear reader, I am about to start a 7-day road trip across Afghanistan‚Äôs remote heartland to see its most glorious treasures, including the 12th Century Minaret of Jam. The latter, the very reason why I had travelled all the way to Afghanistan in the first place.\n\nIt will take me one-and-a-half days through nothingness to reach the minaret, and then another one-and-a-half days off-road driving to reach civilization, namely Herat.\n\nHere‚Äôs to once-in-a-lifetime journeys! ‚ù§ Continue reading ‚Üí\n\nRight at the very end of the battered and bruised road, cutting across the country from east to west, is the Persian historical city of Herat. Not many travellers come this far. It is way too out, perched near Afghanistan‚Äôs western border with Iran. Yet, it has always been of great importance, as is revealed by its architectural and cultural treasures to those who take the trouble to reach it.\n\nHerat‚Äôs been around for a long time; 6th Century BC records describe it as a Persian city which went by the name Aria. Yes, the same pronunciation as my surname. üôÇ\n\nIts strategic location on the Great Silk Road and the banks of the Hari River made it particularly appealing to conquerors and rulers. Alexander the Great defeated Herat‚Äôs Persian Achaemenids in 330 BC and put up a majestic citadel to celebrate his victory. He was followed by the Abbasid Caliphs in the 8th Century, Ghurids in 1175, the Mongol Genghis Khan who destroyed everything in 1221, the Kartids who then rebuilt it, and the Timurid Tamerlane who destroyed it once again in 1380.\n\nWhen Tamerlane‚Äôs favourite son Shahrukh Mirza decided to move his capital from Samarkand to Herat, he was determined to make Herat the grandest city in the region. A vision shared by his wife Gawhar Shad and later descendent Husayn Bayqara.\n\nThe result was a city of much beauty and grace whose praise was extolled far and wide. Of its many buildings, 830 ‚Äòcultural sites‚Äô are still believed to survive today, warranting it a place in UNESCO‚Äôs tentative list in 2004.\n\nIt is a difficult combination. War and conservation. However, despite all the odds, both UNESCO and the Aga Khan Trust for Culture have consistently worked on Herat, ensuring its treasures, hidden from the world at large, manage to survive.\n\nCome along with me on a virtual tour of Timurid Herat, the city on the Hari River, to see why it was called the ‚ÄòPearl of the Khorasan‚Äô for the longest time! Continue reading ‚Üí\n\n34.352865 62.204029\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nOne of Islam‚Äôs most sacred sites lies in northern Afghanistan, a mere 55 kilometres from the Uzbekistan border. It is a blue-tiled mosque which glistens like a jewel, changing colour through the day, and home to countless pristine white pigeons.\n\nWhilst the Shi‚Äôa sect of Islam believe that Ali, Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs cousin and son-in-law, is buried in Najaf, Iraq, the Sunni sect regard Hazrat-e Mazar in Mazar-e Sharif as Ali‚Äôs actual tomb.\n\nBoth, the city Mazar-e Sharif and its spiritual centrepiece Hazrat-e Mazar, date back to the 12th Century.\n\nThere is an interesting Afghan legend as to how the tomb came to be here. Continue reading ‚Üí\n\n36.709018 67.110833\n\nWe travel not for trafficking alone;\n\nBy hotter winds our fiery hearts are fanned:\n\nFor lust of knowing what should not be known,\n\nWe take the Golden Road to Samarkand.\n\n~ James Elroy Flecker\n\nOne cannot claim to be a traveller, and not have made the journey to Samarkand. Or at least have thought of it, fantasised about it. It would be blasphemy.\n\nSamarkand is everything the traveller searches for, within and outside of oneself. It reveals secrets about life held gently amidst its spectacular edifices in blue and gold. The romantic exotic tile-clad mosques, madrasahs, tombs, bazaars and squares transpose one back 500 years in time to a grand fairy-tale city, deep in arid windswept Central Asia. On a philosophical note, Samarkand is the semi-mythological place of ‚Äújustice, fairness, and righteousness‚Äù in Islamic Classical literature.\n\nMuch like Flecker‚Äôs reference to it, a lust for knowing more about ourselves and these ideals, makes the passage to Samarkand one of those non-negotiable, mandatory journeys one just has to take. üôÇ Continue reading ‚Üí\n\nThe grandeur of the Ak-Saray Palace and the simplicity of his own intended tomb‚Äîboth in Shakhrisabz‚Äîperhaps best describe Amir Temur the person, better known as Tamerlane [Temur, the lame]. Complex, multi-faceted, termed history‚Äôs most callous butcher, conqueror of southern, western and central Asia, he was the founder of the Timurid dynasty, and the great-great-great-grandfather of Babur, founder of the Mughal Empire in India. He lived from 1336 ‚Äì 1405 AD.\n\nAhmad ibn Arabshah, Temur‚Äôs Arab biographer, had to say this of him when the latter was 70 years old:\n\n‚ÄúSteadfast in mind and robust in body, brave and fearless, firm as rock. He did not care for jesting or lying; wit and trifling pleased him not; truth, even were it painful, delighted him ‚Ä¶ He loved bold and valiant soldiers, by whose aid he opened the locks of terror, tore men to pieces like lions, and overturned mountains. He was faultless in strategy, constant in fortune, firm of purpose and truthful in business.‚Äù\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí"
