Now this wouldn't be much of a problem but the Timurids are forced into a horde government despite it being a country (actually dynasty see the damn name) tied to a prestigous dynasty that was pretty successful (until just after start date, but then fixed themselves once they went into India), which seems the opposite of what the horde government is supposed to represent: the disorganized hordes after the Mongol Empire fell apart. The Timurids were the only one that was historically successful and were settled into civilized land and not the steppe like the other hordes are.\n\nDue to the terrible government the Timurids are attatched to 15 years after the game starts Ulegh Beg will die with a (if your lucky) 5 year old heir who will promptly be murdered by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ horde events leaving you to lead the glorious Timurid Empire with a dude named Akbar Rashid or some other nonsense.\n\nThe only way I've been able to keep the Timurid dynasty alive is bull rushing the Mughal Empire aquiring glorious amounts of AE and basically ignoring the Persia Shia problem. This stategy is however impossible for the Ai who I have never seen create the Mughal Empire without me on the other side of India killing everyones armies.\n\nPlaying a Country named after a dynasty like the Ottomans and Timurids without the right dynasty is game over mode in my opinion.\n\nParadox need to make the Timurids always have a Timurid ruler (this can change when they go Mughal) or make them change their name when the dynasty dies off."
