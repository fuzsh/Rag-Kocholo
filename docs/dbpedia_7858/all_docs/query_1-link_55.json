Making that journey from Timurid Herat to the home of the Yongle Emperor (with stops along the way at Samarkand, Tashkent, Hami, Ganzhou, and finally Khanbaliq) was a chronicler and painter named Ghiyāth al-Dīn. His story is one of medieval diplomacy and travel.\n\nIf you like what you hear and want to chip in to support the podcast, my Patreon is here.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Report to Mirza Baysunghur on the Timurid Legation to the Ming Court at Peking,\" in A Century of Princes: Sources on Timurid History and Art, selected and translated by W.
