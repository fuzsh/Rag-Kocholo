        "text": "I won an award for sound editing for the film #InkedLove in which I used A.I. to separate the dialogue from the considerable background noise and rescue the dialogue tracks. I also did the music score for the film.\n\nFilm Makers! I am primarily known around town as a music composer however in working on some local films have noticed some pretty sketchy on-set audio‚Ä¶ So I have invested in a brand new suite of state of the art audio tools for audio post-production and cleanup. If your film has some audio issues, clicks, pops, hum, background noise, clipping, harsh eq, too quiet, too loud, can‚Äôt clearly hear the dialogue‚Ä¶ you name it‚Ä¶ I can likely fix it. Let‚Äôs chat! #audiopostproduction #audiopost #filmmaking #sound #filmmaking #movie\n\nA recent arrival‚Ä¶ The Best Composer Award from the 2023 CLOUT Film Festival. Honored to have my work recognized & looking forward to scoring more films and telling more stories with music. üéπ #composer #musicproduction #musiccomposer #awardwinning #filmmusic #moviemusic #masterfademusic\n\nThe opening credits theme music for a short Christmas movie I scored for a Scenes Plus production. The direction given was \"Hallmark Christmas movie with a little Home Alone\" ... How did I do? #film #musiccomposer #television #mfm #MasterFadeMusic https://lnkd.in/gQ3SjhfM\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy Holidays folks! I‚Äôm proud to present ‚ÄúThe Night Before Christmas‚Äù a short film produced by #ScenesPlus #MightyCorndogFilms & #AudiovisualFilms that I had the pleasure of creating the score for. Thanks to Michael Scordakis & Josh Williams for bringing me in on the project. The whole film was conceived THIS MONTH, from writing and casting to filming & final edit, I had just a few days to create the music. Really fun challenge! I hope you enjoy it! https://lnkd.in/gg4epFxb #music #film #composer"
