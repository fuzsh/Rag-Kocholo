        "text": "A dusty, desolate Wyoming town is a logical setting for an updated film noir. The first of many gleeful twists in \"Red Rock West\" is that Nicolas Cage arrives, as the man least likely to survive a tangle of murder, greed and infidelity. Michael is not stupid; he just has the hapless luck of the terminally honest.\n\nHe drives 1,200 miles from Texas to a promised job at a Wyoming oil rig, only to admit on his application that he has a bad knee. Back on the road, he spends his last $5 on gas, though an unguarded cash drawer is spilling bills in front of him. This time his honesty saves him, for the gas-station owner enters at the moment Michael would have had his hand in the till. The director and co-writer, John Dahl, keeps up this perfect swift timing throughout the film, playfully loading on every suspense-genre trick he can imagine. \"Red Rock West\" is a terrifically enjoyable, smartly acted, over-the-top thriller.\n\nMr. Cage, once a champion over-the-top actor himself, has become more restrained, funnier and appealing in the last few years (in films like \"Honeymoon in Vegas\"). He gives the film an intelligent edge, playing Michael with the slightest Elvis drawl and the trace of a dim-witted expression.\n\nWhen Michael arrives in the town of Red Rock, he allows himself to be mistaken for someone named Lyle, a Texan who has been offered a job at the dingy bar owned by Wayne Brown (J. T. Walsh). It turns out that Lyle is not the bartender Michael assumed, but a hit man hired for $10,000 to bump off Wayne's beautiful young wife, Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle). When Michael warns Suzanne, she instantly doubles the offer if he will take care of Wayne instead. Even Michael is smart enough to figure out that this has something to do with Suzanne's lover, a young, good-looking man who lives in a trailer."
