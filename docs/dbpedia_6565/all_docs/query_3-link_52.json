Opening June 22. (In wide release.)\n\nTHE REAL DIRT ON FARMER JOHN\n\nReviewed below in Now Playing. Opening June 22. (Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and Quad Cinema.)\n\nYOU KILL ME\n\nA comic thriller, directed by John Dahl, about a hit man who is disciplined by the Mob. Starring Luke Wilson, Ben Kingsley, and Téa Leoni. Opening June 22. (In wide release.)\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nBLACK SHEEP\n\n“The Birds” with sheep. The director Jonathan King’s horror film, about a small herding community in New Zealand that is attacked by vicious, man-eating sheep, is ludicrous fun. As two brothers (Nathan Meister and Peter Feeney) wrangle over the business concerns of their late father’s farm, the science-gone-too-far plotlines (genetic experiments gone awry) and emotional hysteria (one brother has a severe sheep phobia) pile up and play sublimely, in a thirties-horror-movie way. Although the dialogue is filled with zingers that don’t quite hit the mark, their madcap delivery zooms the picture along. King allows the blood-soaked mayhem to stand out vibrantly against the lovingly photographed hills, and the twists and turns of his screenplay (as when some victims turn into sheep themselves) are outlandishly entertaining.—Bruce Diones (Sunshine Cinema.)\n\nCRAZY LOVE\n\nIn 1959, about the same time that Doris Day defended her honor from Rock Hudson’s assault in “Pillow Talk,” an extraordinarily pretty Bronx girl named Linda Riss fought off a married lawyer. Burt Pugach was thirty-two, Linda ten years younger. He wasn’t much to look at, and his honesty, both personal and professional, was intermittent at best, but he had some money. When she fell in love with a handsome young man, Burt hired three thugs to throw acid in her face so that the suitor would no longer want her. This barbaric act, which left Linda nearly sightless, wound up binding Burt and Linda together for life. Dan Klores’s documentary is a real-world story, as redolent of time and place as a song by Dion and the Belmonts, in which possessiveness, stupidity, loyalty, and need are joined together in bewildering combinations. It’s as if some disreputable and unending liaison out of the Greek myths arose on the streets of the East Bronx to be celebrated not with epic poetry but with front-page headlines in the tabloids. Klores takes the media-archeological approach—lots of still photographs, home movies, stock footage, and current-day interviews. One may be horrified or amused by this couple, but one is also mightily impressed by their talent for survival.—David Denby (Reviewed in our issue of 6/11 & 18/07.) (BAM Rose Cinemas and Sunshine Cinema.)\n\nINVADERS FROM MARS\n\nAn ideal first science-fiction film for grade-schoolers, who inevitably put themselves in the place of the child hero, David MacLean (Jimmy Hunt), a science aficionado whose lack of pretension and gush keeps him from coming off as a nerd. After he spots a spaceship touching down in the hills just beyond his back yard, he tries to warn the authorities that the Martians have landed and are turning the neighbors into slaves by a mysterious process that leaves a scar on the back of the neck. When he’s struggling to convince the cops, the film becomes Kafka for kids; it holds up as a divertissement because of the humorous, haunting incongruity between fifties Middle America and the alien spaceship. The director, William Cameron Menzies, emulates Norman Rockwell’s tones and compositions, then twists them, creating a “Twilight Zone” atmosphere: a sense of catastrophe hovers over this settled, seemingly impregnable world. Some of the effects are chintzy, but Menzies’s suggestions of people falling into a whirling sand pit are eerier than anything in Tobe Hooper’s 1986 remake. So is his Martian heat ray, which causes walls to swell and pop as if they had a galloping outbreak of acne. Released in 1953.—Michael Sragow (Pioneer Theatre; June 23.)\n\nKNOCKED UP\n\nBen Stone (Seth Rogen) is a feckless oaf with a wide grin, a bong, and four lazy housemates who are too old to be boys but will never, unless fate takes a hand, bother to grow into men. Fate, however, has plans for Ben, who drunkenly sleeps with a bright, ambitious woman named Alison (Katherine Heigl) and gets her pregnant. If you can accept the premise of Judd Apatow’s movie—that Alison would not just keep the baby but ask Ben to become a proper father, with his share of responsibilities—then there is much to relish here. As in Apatow’s last picture, “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” the cream of the gags go to supporting players; characters like Alison’s unhappy sister (Leslie Mann) and the spiteful colleague (Kristen Wiig) at the TV studio where she works land the sharpest blows. Much of the movie, indeed, slides from the easy laugh to the painful wince; even if you tire of Apatow’s vomit jokes, or his teen-aged weakness for smut, there are flashes of disarming honesty here from which more earnest films might shy away.—Anthony Lane (6/4/07) (In wide release.)\n\nMANUFACTURED LANDSCAPES\n\nJennifer Baichwal’s documentary about the photographer Edward Burtynsky is better than the photographs it celebrates. Tagging along on his trip to China, where he takes intricately detailed pictures of colossal industrial activities and their aftermath, she captures far more effectively with her movie camera the intimate experience of rapid industrialization—the drudgery of exacting factory labor, the inhuman scale of urban development in Shanghai, workers enlisted to destroy their own cities at the Three Gorges Dam. Starting with an eight-minute tracking shot inside a vast, hangarlike factory (an old trick redone surprisingly well), she adds a bracing dose of brainwork to his tireless legwork. A Burtynsky photograph taken outside the factory impassively depicts an enormous Riefenstahl-like array of uniformed laborers (organized at the photographer’s request), but Baichwal gets close enough to hear a foreman chide his off-duty underlings for the quality of their work.—Richard Brody (Film Forum.)\n\nMR. BROOKS\n\nJust as some men might give in to a hidden taste for pornography, or perhaps for Transcendental Meditation or poetry writing, Mr. Brooks (Kevin Costner), a pillar of the community in Portland, Oregon, is addicted to murder. Every now and then, over a period of years, and with considerable guilt as well as enjoyment, he has gone out at night and committed a perfect crime. He has a superb enabler—an alter ego (William Hurt) whom, for some reason, he calls Marshall and who, sitting in the back of a car or on the side of a room, accompanies him everywhere. Marshall is Mr. Brooks’s desire, his madness, and his sanity, too—the part of him that wants to kill people and that also calculates how to avoid getting caught. When Costner and Hurt are fighting with each other, or just chatting, this peculiar thriller, written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon and directed by Evans, is witty and fresh. The rest is well made but more conventional. With the comic Dane Cook as a blackmailing voyeur who wants to accompany Mr. Brooks, Demi Moore in full battle armor as a tough cop who has to fight off an escaped killer and a parasitical husband, and Danielle Panabaker as Mr. Brooks’s college-age daughter, who may have murderous tendencies herself.—D.D. (6/11 & 18/07) (In wide release.)\n\nNANCY DREW\n\nReviewed this week in The Current Cinema. (In wide release.)\n\nOCEAN’S THIRTEEN\n\nCertainly a more hardworking movie than “Twelve,” in which the actors, lounging at George Clooney’s villa on Lake Como, barely condescended to speak their lines between drinks. In this one, a nasty Vegas hotel owner, Willie Bank (Al Pacino), has swindled the gang’s beloved mentor, Reuben (Elliott Gould), so Danny (Clooney) and the others plan to louse up the opening of Bank’s new hotel. The elaborate revenge plot, concocted by the screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien, involves magnetizing dice and creating an earthquake. But, after all the elaborate preparations, the payoff is rather meagre. You can build a ship—maybe even a whole fleet—in a bottle, but then what do you do with it? With Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, et al. Directed by Steven Soderbergh.—D.D. (6/11 & 18/07) (In wide release.)\n\nTHE REAL DIRT ON FARMER JOHN\n\nTaggart Siegel’s documentary chronicles the plight of Midwestern farmers with the story of John Peterson (who wrote and provides the voice-over), an all-American boy who was raised on his family’s farm, in Caledonia, Illinois. Peterson comes off as a peripatetic, romantic soul who craved an outlet for eccentric self-expression; after travelling to Mexico in a failed attempt to emulate Henry Miller, he returned, depressed, to the abandoned farm (which he inherited following his father’s untimely death), only to be plagued by unneighborly accusations of Satan worship. His conversations with his hardworking firecracker of a mother, Anna, reveal the ethics that she steadfastly instilled in him. Eventually, Peterson rallied and began to farm organically—a painstaking, unprofitable endeavor that eventually grew into a bountiful agronomic utopia. His story offers an example not only of the spiritual value of honoring one’s provenance but also of how sustained effort can lead to greatness.—Shauna Lyon (Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and Quad Cinema.)\n\nTHE TESTAMENT OF ORPHEUS\n\nJean Cocteau begins this reflective fantasy, from 1959, as a periwigged poet forced to wander through time, before getting fixed in modernity by a bullet going faster than light. His farewell film is a self-portrait in poignant, satirical skits, using film clips, characters, and people from his life and work, especially his 1950 masterpiece, “Orpheus.” The young poet from that film, Cégeste (Edouard Dhermitte, who also appears in his real-life role as Cocteau’s adopted son), returns to guide the gaunt, troubled director to the underworld, where he is judged by the Princess of Death (Maria Casares) and Heurtebise (François Périer); Cocteau’s self-defense turns into a manifesto of the arts of cinema and poetry, which, for him, are inseparable. Using wondrously simple trick photography and scenic artistry, he gives a genially self-pitying overview of a long life used up in the name of art. With one foot in the French New Wave and the other in the Ballets Russes, Cocteau contains a raging confession in a serene, sensuous neoclassical vessel. In French.—R.B. (IFC Center; June 21 and June 24.)\n\nLA VIE EN ROSE\n\nThis ambitious French bio-pic devoted to the great Edith Piaf is fascinating, exhausting, and overwrought—a death trip. Born in 1915, Piaf (Marion Cotillard) was raised in a brothel, a travelling circus, and the bars and streets of Paris, where she developed the voice—somehow both metallic and throaty, coarse and soulful—that electrified the French and, after the war, the Americans, too. Cotillard gives an amazing performance: frail and, at times, bent (Piaf suffered from arthritis), she can look terrified and vicious simultaneously, and she goes all the way with the writer-director Olivier Dahan’s concept, which emphasizes Piaf’s suffering as a child and young woman and her monstrousness as an adult. The actual Piaf, who helped Charles Aznavour and Yves Montand when they were young, was generous to the talented; this Piaf is abominably self-centered and often cruel, always alcoholic and frequently drug-addicted. The movie is a remorselessly downbeat version of a gin-and-tears Hollywood bio-pic. With Gerard Depardieu as Piaf’s first great patron, Sylvie Testud as a constant friend, Pascal Greggory as her adoring but often abused manager, and the handsome and polite Jean-Pierre Martins as the great love of Piaf’s life, the middleweight boxing champion Marcel Cerdan. In French.—D.D. (In limited release.)\n\nALSO PLAYING\n\nFANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER: In wide release. GYPSY CARAVAN: Angelika Film Center and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas.
