Nicolas Cage is our hero, who by a series of misunderstandings is hired by JT walsh's character, to kill his wife, played by Lara Flynn Boyle. What follows is a twist and turn story which is no doubt enhanced by Dennis Hopper appearing, playing a role he could do in his sleep! The Cinematography is excellent but I felt a little disappointed by Cage's performance. He seemed, to me, to be subdued and this is not, in my humble opinion, one of his best. The late JT Walsh is excellent here, I do not think I have seen him give a bad performance and I feel his death is a loss to film.\n\nHave you seen this film?
