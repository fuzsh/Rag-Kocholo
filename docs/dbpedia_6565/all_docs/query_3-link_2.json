        "text": "A young detective becomes involved with a beautiful woman on the run from the mob and her psychopath boyfriend.\n\nUpon arriving to a small town, a drifter is mistaken for a hitman, but when the real hitman arrives, complications ensue.\n\nIt's the kind of movie made by people who love movies, have had some good times at them, and want to celebrate the very texture of old genres like the western and the film noir.\n\nA devious sexpot steals her husband's drug money and hides out in a small town where she meets the perfect dupe for her next scheme.\n\nA movie that is not only ingenious and entertaining, but liberating, because we can sense the story isn't going to be twisted into conformity with some stupid formula.\n\nA young, reformed gambler must return to playing high stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks, while balancing his relationship with his girlfriend and his commitments to law school.\n\nThree young people on a road trip from Colorado to New Jersey talk to a trucker on their CB radio, then must escape when he turns out to be a psychopathic killer.\n\nA well-constructed B-movie thriller, Joy Ride keeps up the necessary level of tension and chills. Critics also liked Zahn's performance as the goofball older brother.\n\nTaking place towards the end of WWII, 500 American Soldiers have been entrapped in a camp for 3 years. Beginning to give up hope they will ever be rescued, a group of Rangers goes on a dangerous mission to try and save them.\n\nThough the climax of the film -- the actual raid -- is exciting, the rest of it is bogged down in too many subplots and runs on for too long.\n\nWhile drying out on the West Coast, an alcoholic hitman befriends a tart-tongued woman who might just come in handy when it's time for him to return to Buffalo and settle some old scores."
