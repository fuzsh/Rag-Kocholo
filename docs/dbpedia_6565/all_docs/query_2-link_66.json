        "text": "Hey folks, Harry here... Seems that John Dahl recently had a test screening of THE GREAT RAID, and frankly... it didn't do so well. Still a lot of time before this film is supposed to hit our collective eyes on February 13th, 2004. That's right, John has 7 months to tighten and toy with his film, which at this stage is probably little more than an assembly print, meaning that John and his editor put all the scenes together, had a very loose temp track and that they were simply showing the film to an audience to begin to see how far they need to go to get the film into shape. Are the problems these 3 having with the film, the sort that can be handled in that time... 7 months... that's a long time to fix a lot of issues, let's keep our eyes on this one, I'm not gonna give up on a filmmaker of Dahl's skill!!!\n\nHey Harry. Ford here. Just went last night to the Pacific Sherman Oaks Galleria to catch a screening of 'The Great Raid', the new film by John Dahl.\n\nNow to start with, I've been a big John Dahl fan. I really enjoyed Red Rock West, Rounders, The Last Seduction. JoyRide had its problems, but for the most part, from inside knowledge, I blame that film on its producers. But he has always seemed to be a fun director. So how is his action war film? Especially since it is the same story that Spielberg wanted to do with Cruise in their film Ghost Soldiers (by the way, is that project dead, because I haven't heard anything about it in over a year, and it is the EXACT same story as this).\n\nTo sum it up easily, this film doesn't work entirely for plenty of reasons. Let's start with casting. Benjamin Bratt plays the lead Col. Mucci, and he is like a piece of furniture through the whole film. Just horrible. Has anyone other than Julia Roberts ever really liked this guy? I mean, other than his cool little cameo in Traffic?? He is HORRIBLE. His big dramatic breakthrough scene - \"You know what...I think I am going to shave off my moustache.\" Then his second in command is James Franco, who really worked in Spiderman, but postures in this like he's James Dean the sequel. But he's DONE that movie. Then there's Joseph Fiennes, and he's suffering from malaria in the prison camp, and he'll do scenes where he's walking around just fine, and then ten seconds later, sweating on a bed like Whitney Houston from his malaria, which is just killing him. His performance is just all over the place. And you seriously get bored of him doing the \"I have malaria\" stare.\n\nNow let's hit the story. Okay, the U.S. screwed over some troops in the Phillipines. MacArthur ran off to Australia, and we left behind 10,000 troops in Bataan. They got captured. They had to do a death march for 60 miles where a ton of 'em died, and now there's like 500 left. We send in Law and Order's Army Rangers (I'd rather have watched Bill Murray's squad from Stripes) to go raid the prison camp, now THAT would have been a hit movie. But we hardly get an idea of anything about the soldiers, except for the bold brace decision of Benjamin Bratt to shave off the moustache before going to war. We keep jumping back to the really boring dying soldiers in the prison camp. Why can't Dahl watch more entertaining 'Let's get 'em out' movies, like Uncommon Valor, or Missing In Action?? Instead, he went with the boring Missing In Action 2 idea of 'Let's show the miserable guys in the camp' for most of the movie. No. NOOOOO!!!! You show me 500 troops that can hardly walk because they have been starved and without medical attention, you show me like a billion Japanese troops, and then you show me Law and Order and James Dean, and I'm thinking that we are in a lot of trouble. And similar to Bratt's shaving of the moustache, we have several scenes where Franco stares at his foot, which has like a corn on it or something, and then after three or four of these 'stare at the foot' scenes, finally one has a doctor who tells him that \"he can't believe he's walking on it\". What??? These are the tough guys. One is about to get a no go because of a rash on his foot. Where the fuck is Rambo when we need him. Someone call Bruce or Sly or Arnold and now, because I have James Dean with a sore foot going to battle. You need that tough guy scene, with the bad ass with no expression, checking out his knife like Rambo or The Minnesota Governor in Predator, chewing tobacco, and looking ugly, and ready to go really mess up the bad guy. I get 130 pound guys with a skinned foot, and Law and Order guy.\n\nThen we have the other subplot, the one with the..well, she not the girlfriend or the wife of Joseph Fiennes, but she's in love with him, even though she used to have a husband. Oh, she also runs the underground world that sneaks medical supplies to the troops in the prison. She walks around with more makeup than the chick on Drew Carey, and somehow BLENDS into the crowd with the poor migrant Phillipinos. Then all of her underground friends get systematically shot and killed by the Japs. No questioning. No identifying. Just walk up, pull them out of a crowd, and BAM. But when they catch the only white woman in the country, they put her in a cell. She even has perfect lipstick during a torture sequence. Retarded.\n\nSo then the raid happens. Lasts about 20 minutes, and is a lot of fun. Nothing you hadn't seen before, but in a theater with great sound, scenes like that are great. Kind of like when my roommate Brad just bought a great sound system for the house, and right when we hooked it up to the big tv, we could have watched Schindler's List, or Citizen Kane, or some moving piece of cinema with the 25 channels of sound.\n\nBRING ON THE FUCKING MATRIX!!!! And you don't watch the movie. You put on the chapter on the DVD with the gunfight in the office building where they just blow the shit out of everything. And you turn it up real loud. And your big fat neighbor with the moustache comes complaining, and that's when you throw on the last 20 minutes of Die Hard, and start screaming 'Yippee Kay Yay', and then you throw on the final gunfight in 'Way of the Gun', and then you and your roommates just go grab a bunch of shotguns and start...well, you know.\n\nAnyway, it's kind of like that. Bazookas and stuff being shot all over the place, plenty of people getting killed. And then there's the one scene where there's the guy who you want to kill the entire movie, kind of like Robert Patrick in Copland, and you're just begging for someone to kill him, and there isn't a gunfight, it's a real fight, because that's how real men do it, like when Bruce Willis fought the guy that played Meat in Porky's in Die Hard 2 and stabbed him in the eye with an icicle, and so he finally does kill him, and you cheer, and then they plug his corpse with a few more bullets for extra effort, and you cheer some more. Good times.\n\nSPOLIER ALERT\n\nSo Fiennes is holding out for his hot chick, and she apparently hasn't been digging on anyone in the Phillipino Underground (or so they would have us think, if you get what I'm saying, and I think you do.....Four years in the underground, and no one ever got a little drunk one night and, well , you know...I mean, they are smuggling PAINKILLERS) , and then she shows up after the raid, which is a great scene because it looks like she just pulled her car up after the party. HOW IN THE HELL DID SHE FIND THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JUNGLE. SHE WAS IN THE CITY EARLIER. Looked like a scene out of Sixteen Candles, like the car pulls up after the big party, and the hot chick comes looking for the guy or something. Except the twist is that Joseph Fiennes has finally died of malaria. So she reads the note he wrote for her, and she is all torn up, and then seeks solace in a hug from Fiennes friend in the prison camp, and ...hmmm...maybe this story's just heating up.\n\nRemember that great scene in Red Rock West, when Nick Cage goes out to the car, and looks like he's finally going to get away, and he starts the car, and the gas is on empty, and he looks at it with despair and mumbles \"Story of my fucking life\", and it's just great. Yeah, well, there aren't any scenes like that in this film.\n\nHundreds of dead bodies. Zero breasts (and that is a crime in this flick). Assassination by gunshot to the back of the head. Malaria Fu. Bazooka Fu. Booty Time Nominations for Jourdan Lee Khoo as the evil Japanese commander for lines like \"This man disobeyed me. Now ten men will pay for that mistake.\" Foot rash Fu. Pharmacy Fu. Pills Smuggled in the Bra Fu. Death by dousing of gasoline and then being on the wrong end of a torch. Fire Fu. Booty Time Nominations for Joseph Fiennes with \"These bastards are starving us on purpose\", and \"I really don't think it's malaria this time.\" Gratuitous General MacArthur footage. Gratuitous moustache. Gratuitous 'Shaving the Moustache' scene. Razor Fu.\n\nWhere is Ghost Soldiers??? Why didn't they make that one??\n\nOut.\n\nThen here's \"The Brief One\" with his concise dismissive of Dahl's latest...\n\nI saw \"The Great Raid\" in a preview screening last night and it was awful.\n\nThe story was confused, the dialogue was god awful and the acting was terrible.\n\nIt felt like a bunch of really good movies (including \"The Bridge Over the River Kwai\") that had been badly ripped off and crammed together.\n\nThe Brief One\n\nand for the third bored opinion of Dahl's latest, here's Mil\n\nWell, your pal Mil managed to get into a screening of the new John Dahl picture, the unfortunately titled 'The Great Raid.' Frankly, the title is not the only unfortunate part of this one. John Dahl is really struggling these days. His latest effort is not going to help matters I'm afraid.\n\nBenjamin Bratt and Joseph Fiennes star in this yawner based on a raid of a Japanese POW camp in the Philippines near the end of World War II, where 511 American prisoners were rescued from the clutches of the Japs. I'm sure the original raid was quite exciting, but you wouldn't really know that from this film.\n\nFirst off, I couldn't tell you who the main character is. There is no clear-cut protagonist, always a problem for a movie. Bratt plays Colonel Mucci, a character whose only distinguishing feature is that he smokes a pipe. Joseph Fiennes plays a sickly POW with one foot in the grave. All he does is sit and wring his hands and limp around the camp. Connie Nielsen of Gladiator plays his sweetheart who works as a nurse for a Manila hospital. She's working with the resistance, trying to get medicine to the camp because she knows Fiennes is sick. The romance never comes close to paying off, we never see any scenes of them being romantic together, not even in flashback, so that falls pretty flat.\n\nThe big showdown with the bad guy, the Japanese head of the POW camp, is a letdown too. The guy is killed by one of the supporting characters; I don't even remember the guy's name. Hey, the audience applauded, guess they were appreciative of a free movie. The only thing the production should be applauded for is their casting of real Asian actors to portray the Japanese and Philippinos. You might have expected them to stick Lou Diamond Phillips or Mako in as the villain; thankfully they use a real Asian actor with a thick accent.\n\nI'm not even sure this one will make it to the big screen, you might want to watch for it in your TV guide, it may turn up as an HBO movie. But if you watch it, don't say I didn't warn ya!"
