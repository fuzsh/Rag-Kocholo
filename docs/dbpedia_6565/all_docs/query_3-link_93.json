        "text": "GET REEL: 10 movies for the lovesick on Valentine's Day\n\nYour lover has just dumped you. Or you just dumped your lover. Or maybe you’ve never had a lover in the first place.\n\nFor you, Valentine’s Day, is about as much fun as a funeral. It’s as if Cupid had shot at an arrow at your heart, but instead hit your posterior. With your love life on the rocks, the last thing you want to watch is a movie where two people fall madly in love and live happily ever after.\n\nWhat you want, what you really, really want is a large supply of cinematic schadenfreude where love means never having to say you’re happy. To satisfy your appetite for anti-romanticism, we have selected 10 films from a large menu. All have received the Debbie Downer seal of approval. They are listed in alphabetical order.\n\n“BLUE VALENTINE” (2010) – Dean and Cindy are in love, and then they’re not. Writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes the nonlinear route to chronicle this relationship with more ups and downs than a hyperactive elevator. The film is propelled emotionally by great performances by the leads – Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. The latter received an Oscar nod for best actress.\n\n“BODY HEAT\" (1981) – Ned falls in love or lust with Matty. Complicating matters is that Matty is married. What to do? Well, Ned could murder Matty’s husband. Then he and Matty could live happily ever after. Then pigs could fly. Let’s just say that Matty might not be a candidate for sainthood. Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan crafts a taut erotic thriller here buoyed by superb lead performances by William Hurt and, especially, Kathleen Turner in her film debut. The movie shot her to stardom.\n\n“FATAL ATTRACTION” (1987) – Clearly, Dan never watched “Body Heat,” or if he did, he didn’t learn this important lesson – don’t have an affair with a woman with issues, especially if you’re married. Here, he hooks up with Alex and the passion commences. Will Dan leave his wife so he and Alex can live happily ever after? That pig still isn’t flying. This erotic thriller comes to us from director Adrian Lyne and writer James Dearden, based on his short film “Diversion.” “Fatal Attraction” received six Oscar nominations, including best picture, best director and best actress for Glenn Close, whose Alex is someone you truly shouldn’t ignore. Michael Douglas co-stars.\n\n“GONE GIRL” (2014) – Nick reports his wife Amy is missing. That’s because he could have killed her. This film, directed by David Fincher from a screenplay by Gillian Flynn, based on her book, contains more twists than a pack of Twizzlers. Ben Affleck plays Nick, who thinks he has a handle on this situation. He should think again. Or perhaps he just shouldn’t think at all. Rosamund Pike is sensational as Amy, earning an Academy award nomination for her performance.\n\n“KILL BILL: VOLUME 1” (2003) and “KILL BILL: VOLUME 2” (2004) – If you want to get a woman sensationally mad, shoot her in the head on her wedding day when she’s pregnant. That’s what happens to the Bride. She survives the attack and goes on a vengeful killing spree targeting the assassins who took part in the attack, including a charming fellow named Bill, played by David Carradine. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino with his trademark subtlety – in one scene the Bride disposes of 88, count ‘em, 88 bad guys – “Kill Bill\" provides a showcase for the acting and slaying skills of Uma Thurman.\n\n“THE LAST SEDUCTION” (1994) – Another lesson, guys - if your wife insults you and you slap her, you may regret it – soon and for the rest of your life. Clay makes that mistake so a piqued Bridget steals the money he has just acquired in a drug deal. Bridget goes on the run, ends up in a small town and meets a man named Mike, who starts to fall in love with her. Not a wise decision. Linda Fiorentino excels as the ultimate femme fatale here. Bill Pullman and Peter Berg co-star. This film is directed by John Dahl from a devilish screenplay by Steve Barancik.\n\n“LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR” (1977) – Theresa Dunn is a schoolteacher by day and a sexual predator by night. What could possibly go wrong? Written and directed by Richard Brooks from a novel by Judith Rossner and inspired by a true story, the film gives Diane Keaton another opportunity to show what a phenomenal actress she is. In the same year, she would star in “Annie Hall” and later win an Oscar for her performance.\n\n“SID AND NANCY” (1986) – This biopic chronicles the turbulent relationship of Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. If you know anything about the British punk rock band the Sex Pistols – Sid was its bassist – you know that this match doesn’t quite resemble Hepburn and Tracy. Writer-director Alex Cox gets a big boost from its stars Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb.\n\n“THE WAR OF THE ROSES” (1989) – OK, divorce is a downer, but it can be used as a tool for black comedy, like this one. Oliver and Barbara Rose decide to divorce and it doesn’t go well – a mild understatement. As the Roses, Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner take hysterical turns on who can be crueler to whom. The chandelier scene is a classic. Danny DeVito directs and also co-stars. The screenplay is by Michael J. Leeson from the book by Warren Adler.\n\n“WHO’S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?” (1966) – Saving the best for last. Ever been to dinner with another couple and that couple starts arguing and you have to sit there uncomfortably hoping they’ll stop or hoping you can find an excuse to leave? Well, pity poor Nick and Honey who get to witness the vituperative verbal volleys of George and Martha and there’s no easy exit. Based on the play by Edward Albee, this brilliant film was nominated for 13 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director with Mike Nichols making his directorial debut. The movie won a best actress Oscar for Elizabeth Taylor as Martha and a best supporting actress Oscar for Sandy Dennis as Honey. Richard Burton as George was nominated for best actor and George Segal as Nick was nominated for best supporting actor. Taylor and Burton were married in real life at the time. To de-glamorize herself to play Martha, Taylor reportedly gained nearly 30 pounds.\n\nMonthly Movie Trivia Contest\n\nIt’s now time for TRIVIA.\n\nLast month's tester: More than 50 years ago, two critics organizations agreed for the first time on their respective choices for best actor and best actress. The actress would later win an Oscar while the actor wouldn't even be nominated. Name the actress and the actor. Clue: More than 30 years later, the actor would receive an Oscar nomination.\n\nAnswer: Shirley Booth and Ralph Richardson\n\nBeverly Gee of Wayland was the first and only reader to answer the question correctly. Congratulations!\n\nThis month's tester: Made nearly 50 years apart, these two films with nearly the same title won the same two Academy Awards. Clue: The director of the first film is an American. The director of the second film is not.\n\nTrivia enthusiasts can call me at 508-626-4409 or email me at rtremblay@wickedlocal.com.
