        "text": "I do remember Spike saying to me at one point,\n\nJohn Malkovich wouldn't do it that way.\n\nAnd he seemed serious when he said that,\n\nand I just thought, what a fascinating outlook that is.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nBeing John Malkovich, John Horatio Malkovich.\n\n[wind whooshing]\n\nMalkovich?\n\nI played John Horatio Malkovich,\n\nwhich is not my name, Horatio, but Gavin is my name.\n\nWhat I remember about Being John Malkovich,\n\nI was out in LA shooting a movie,\n\nand I called my then producing partner\n\nand old friend Russ Smith,\n\n'cause I was flying back to Europe that night\n\nwhen the shoot was finished in the late afternoon.\n\nI only had a couple hundred pages of a book left,\n\nand it's a very long flight to where I was going,\n\nso I asked Russ, Is there anything\n\nat the office for me to read?\n\nAnd Russ said kind of, there was a pause,\n\nand then he said kind of menacingly,\n\nOh, I've got something for you to read.\n\nSo I said, Okay, well, send it out, and et cetera.\n\nSo he did, and I saw the title page\n\nsaid Being John Malkovich.\n\nI thought, oh, how funny.\n\nThen I read about 30 pages,\n\nwhich I thought were spectacular,\n\nbut the character I was to play\n\nhad not been in the film at that point,\n\nand I called Russ and said, Did you read this thing?\n\nAnd he said, Oh yeah.\n\nAnd I said, It's an amazing piece of writing.\n\nI mean, it's more or less kind of visionary, really.\n\nAnd he goes, Keep reading.\n\nAnd I read it on the plane\n\nand called Russ when I got back to France\n\nand said, you know, Call this joker\n\nand tell him we would like to produce it\n\nand I would like to direct it\n\nif he'll make it about someone else.\n\nI think I may have said Tom Cruise or Bill Hurt\n\nor somebody we don't know.\n\nI probably named about 20 people.\n\nWhen that person is you, at least for me,\n\nI'm not quite sure why that would interest anyone.\n\nRuss set up a meeting with Charlie.\n\nRuss told him, and Charlie said no,\n\nhe wasn't gonna change it.\n\nNo, he's glad we liked it,\n\nbut no, he wasn't interested in changing,\n\nand we said, Okay, would you be interested in rewriting?\n\nWe were working with an English playwright\n\non a script about Howard Hughes at the time,\n\nand this is a long, long time ago, of course.\n\nHe said no, he wouldn't be interested in that,\n\nand then we said we also have a script\n\ncalled The Space Merchants, which we want to.\n\nNo, he wasn't interested in that,\n\nand Russ said, Okay, well, thanks, you know.\n\nGood luck, take care.\n\nAnd then some years later, whenever I'd be in Hollywood,\n\ninvariably, someone would come by and say,\n\nWhy aren't you doing 'Being John Malkovich'?\n\nIt'd been around for a few years,\n\nand I said, Well, I mean,\n\n'cause nobody's gonna do a script\n\ncalled 'Being John Malkovich'.\n\nI mean, you'd have to be really deranged.\n\nThere's a tiny door in my office, Maxine.\n\nIt's a portal, and it takes you inside John Malkovich.\n\nYou see the world through John Malkovich's eyes,\n\nand then after about 15 minutes, you're spit out\n\ninto a ditch on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike.\n\nSounds great.\n\nWho the fuck is John Malkovich?\n\nSome years later, I got a call\n\nwhen I was walking the kids to school\n\nfrom Francis Ford Coppola, asking me if I'd go up to Paris\n\nand meet this boy called Spike Jonze.\n\nI think what Francis said was,\n\nWe'll all be working for him someday.\n\nAnd I said, Oh, okay.\n\nYeah, sure, I would've done it anyway,\n\njust out of respect for Coppola.\n\nI went up to Paris, I met Spike,\n\nI liked what he had to say.\n\nThe only thing I remember much about the reading is he,\n\nafter 45 minutes, I was like, Wait, are you American?\n\n'Cause I thought he was Czech.\n\nHe has that kind of surfer speak, or had.\n\nIt was lost on me, of course.\n\nI said, Okay, well let me know, and let's see, you know,\n\nsee what the cast is and see how it seems and all that.\n\nI do remember one thing Charlie said.\n\nI finally met him, and this was before we were starting.\n\nI sat with him at the meeting, and I had read the script,\n\nbut they had cut a lot of the cruel jokes in the script,\n\nand at the meeting I said, Listen, that's not.\n\nPut the jokes back in, they're very funny,\n\nand I couldn't possibly care less.\n\nAs we were leaving,\n\nI think they were going one way and I was going the other,\n\nand Charlie kind of sidled up to me, and he said,\n\nI just want you to know I'm a really big fan.\n\nAnd I said, Well, Charlie, it's okay.\n\nWe don't have to do this, I read the script.\n\nIt's okay, let's just go ahead.\n\nAh, don't tell me.\n\nUh, Maplethorpe?\n\nMalkovich. Malkovich.\n\nRight, right, okay.\n\nOkay, yeah, I thought you were all right in that one movie.\n\n[John] Thank you.\n\nThe one where you played a jewel thief.\n\n[John] I never played a jewel thief.\n\nAnd then we did the film,\n\nand shooting it was a lot of fun.\n\nI got to shoot a decent amount with my little camera.\n\nIt eventually got into Venice Film Festival.\n\nIt was rejected by Cannes.\n\nIt was too long when they showed it to Gilles Jacob.\n\nIt was way too long.\n\nI mean, I said to Spike at the time,\n\nand he said, I think you're too close to it,\n\nwhich made me laugh a lot.\n\nHe'd kind of taken a Bergman,\n\nwhat already is a Bergman film,\n\nand then made it a Bergman film,\n\nbut, you know, the script is pretty much\n\nstraight up Jewish vaudeville.\n\nThe Bergman-esque touches are all around anyway.\n\nSo he cut almost 20 minutes, I think.\n\nYou know, I remember when it played in Venice\n\nthat once Charlie Sheen came on\n\nand was revealed to be my best friend,\n\nthat was kind of the end of the story,\n\nmeaning there was a rolling laugh\n\nthat was, probably just went on for 10 minutes.\n\nYeah, yeah, yada yada yada.\n\nWere you stoned?\n\nYes.\n\nNo, I'd never met Charlie.\n\nI actually recommended him to Spike.\n\nIt had been written in the script for Kevin Bacon,\n\nbut he didn't do it.\n\nCharlie, I thought, would just be\n\nthe perfect kind of existential character\n\nthat's tough to beat.\n\nActually, he's so skilled and so funny\n\nthat I thought it worked fantastically well.\n\n[Interviewer] I love this idea of an alternate timeline\n\nof a John Malkovich-directed Being Tom Cruise.\n\nI think it would've been quite good, but.\n\nFor me, when I think about Being John Malkovich,\n\nof course I think almost wholly\n\nabout Spike and Charlie Kaufman,\n\nbecause to me, that introduced two absolutely major talents-\n\nYeah. To the cinema world.\n\n[Interviewer] Would love to see a reunion\n\nof the three of you.\n\nYeah, that would be fun.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nCon Air, Cyrus the Virus.\n\nHis name is Cyrus Grissom, AKA Cyrus the Virus.\n\n39 years old, 25 of them spent in our institutions,\n\nbut he's bettered himself inside,\n\nearned two degrees, including his Juris Doctor.\n\nHe also killed 11 fellow inmates,\n\nincited three riots and escaped twice.\n\nLikes to brag that he killed more men than cancer.\n\n[Falzon] Okay, open wide.\n\nI played a character called Cyrus the Virus.\n\nI was in Europe and I got the script\n\nof something called Con Air.\n\nAt the time, I was working with a English novelist\n\non a screenplay of a film we wanted to do.\n\nI get the script, I see it says Con Air,\n\nI look at the cast of characters\n\nand notice they're all named after romantic poets,\n\nand I take the script and I fling it,\n\nsort of about 15 meters across the kitchen.\n\nThis very nice writer, you know,\n\nkind of looks, and he goes [grumbles].\n\nHe asked me, he'd never read a screenplay,\n\nhe was a novelist,\n\nand then he asked me could he read the screenplay,\n\nand I said, Oh, be my guest, of course, sure.\n\nAnd I gave it to him,\n\nand the next morning, he came downstairs,\n\nand then he started to give a long speech,\n\nsaying, I'm so glad I'm working with someone like you\n\nwho would have so much integrity,\n\nhe would never imagine doing a film like this.\n\nAnd I was like, Whoa, Nicholas, whoa.\n\nI'm doing the film.\n\nAnd he was like, Well, you didn't read it.\n\nAnd I said, Well, I didn't have to read it.\n\nI get exactly what it is,\n\nand you better believe I'm doing it.\n\nFalzon.\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, stewardess, stewardess?\n\nWhat's the in-flight movie today?\n\nWell, I think you'll like it, Cyrus.\n\nIt's called I'll Never Make Love\n\nTo a Woman on the Beach Again,\n\nand it's preceded by the award-winning short,\n\nNo More Steak For Me Ever.\n\n[Falzon laughs]\n\nFunny fucker, aren't you?\n\nAnd that's gonna make X amount,\n\nseveral hundred million dollars,\n\n'cause it's convicts on an airplane,\n\nand they're named after romantic poets.\n\nNic Cage was doing it, who I had met a few times.\n\nI knew Johnny Cusack.\n\nI think maybe Ving Rhames was attached,\n\nI don't know about Buscemi,\n\nbut I didn't know that much about it,\n\ndidn't know the director or anything.\n\nAll I really remember about it is Jerry Bruckheimer\n\nwho I like very much.\n\nHe often had this kind of pack\n\nof, they were like extras in a way,\n\nbut who were fantastically entertaining.\n\nDanny Trejo had a role,\n\nbut there were other ones like Marty McSorley,\n\nwho was a hockey enforcer, essentially,\n\nConrad Goody who was a NFL football player.\n\nSuper entertaining, very male energy.\n\nWhen we break into the cockpit to take over,\n\nthis guy, Marty McSorley, when we were rehearsing it,\n\nhe was supposed to put up resistance,\n\nhe's one of the pilots,\n\nand he just grabbed me by the throat and went like that.\n\nLike, just put me up against the wall with one arm.\n\nI was like, Oh.\n\nIt was entertaining, for the most part, to film.\n\nIf somebody put an ice cube down somebody's shirt\n\nin Wendover, Nevada, it's 108.\n\nThey could just tear the place apart.\n\nYou just never knew what was gonna happen.\n\nI'd known Steve Buscemi was a fireman,\n\nand we kept having trouble having too much\n\nor too little smoke.\n\nI was just reminded of this the other day,\n\n'cause I was out in LA doing press\n\nand I saw David Chappelle, who was in Con Air.\n\nIt made me think of,\n\nwe had such trouble regulating the smoke,\n\nthey just kind of always got it wrong\n\nor the cinematographer or director thought it was wrong,\n\nwhatever it was,\n\nso finally, I just grabbed the machine and gave it\n\nto Buscemi, who was like, in the shot,\n\nand said, You do it.\n\nAnd he goes [splutters],\n\nand I said, Well, Jesus, you were a fireman.\n\nJust shut up, just do the thing. Who cares?\n\nWhich he did, and quite well, of course.\n\n[Interviewer] Some iconic lines in that movie.\n\nYeah, I got off a good one\n\nto Steve Buscemi, actually, when he shows up in his mask,\n\nwhich was, I love your work.\n\nLove your work.\n\nOne of them could have come from Nic.\n\nDon't move or the bunny gets it.\n\nMake a move and the bunny gets it.\n\nNic was very concentrated, very good, very serious.\n\nI think he's gone through such kind of periods, Nic,\n\nand seemed to me pretty serious about everything.\n\nWhen I met him socially,\n\nhe was sort of super funny and sweet,\n\nbut quite serious at work, if I remember correctly.\n\nFor years, I mean, that was just a calling card\n\nwas Cyrus the Virus.\n\nYou know, once, I was walking in Chicago,\n\nand I heard two guys arguing\n\nabout whether I was Cyrus the Virus or not,\n\nand one said to the other one, you know,\n\nIf he'd be Cyrus the Virus, where's the bodyguard?\n\nAnd the other one said to him, He's the bodyguard.\n\nAnd then he said, Give me $20, so I did.\n\nOne I remember, though [chuckles],\n\nthere's a big explosion in Con Air,\n\nand in later years, Andy Samberg did a song,\n\nCool Guys Don't Look at Explosions,\n\nand I remember when we were gonna shoot that,\n\nyou have the big safety meeting,\n\nyou have the whole crew there,\n\nand I think the guy who ran that was called Ken,\n\nwhere they explain everything\n\nand you have to do this, you have to do that.\n\nThey explain this whole thing.\n\nAt 10 yards, this has to take X number of seconds,\n\nyou have to be this far away from the explosion,\n\nat 30 yards this, at 50 yards that, at 70 yards that.\n\nIf you weren't at that distance\n\nfor this enormous explosion,\n\nthen you have to abort the stunt.\n\nKenny said, Okay, well, who wants to count it out?\n\nAnd all these guys with me said, Well, he does.\n\nLike, as if I would've been like,\n\nthe sole person who could count.\n\nI don't know how safe a bet that was,\n\nbut that I remember pretty well,\n\nand everyone's still alive, so I guess I could count.\n\nOh, Cy-onara was a good one.\n\nCy. Onara.\n\n[Cindino shouts] [flames hiss]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nRounders, Teddy KGB.\n\nCertain people still come up to me\n\nin airports, on planes, in restaurants or whatever,\n\nand that's the thing they wanna talk about, Teddy KGB.\n\nA lot of times, it's people\n\nwho went through a poker player phase\n\nor are still going through it.\n\nI thought it was a pretty funny part.\n\nFlashy in that way,\n\nand the real decision about that was just how broad to go.\n\nThousand straight.\n\nVery aggressive.\n\nA new day.\n\nAnd you won't be pushed around.\n\nBut, I re-raise.\n\n5,000.\n\nNot so much in the emotional part,\n\nbut there have been, and continues to be, probably,\n\na lot of discussion about my accent,\n\nwhich was actually taught to me\n\nby a great actress called Ingeborga Dapkunaite\n\nwho grew up in Lithuania,\n\nbut her father was a Soviet diplomat.\n\nThis was when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nLived and worked in Moscow for years,\n\nso she taught me the accent.\n\nI've spent a decent amount of time in Russia,\n\nand there are a lot of words\n\nwhich just kind of come back all the time.\n\nThings like him,\n\nthey just don't say him.\n\nThey just for the most part can't do it.\n\nOf course, there are Russians\n\nwith beautiful English accents or what have you,\n\nbut that was kind of a decision\n\nto kind of, as they say, go big or go home.\n\nYou could do subtly,\n\nwell, certainly you could do it\n\na lot more subtly than I did,\n\nbut that's also kind of what Matt was doing.\n\nYou must feel proud and good.\n\nStrong enough to beat the world.\n\nI feel fine.\n\nMe, too.\n\nI feel okay.\n\nI thought a nice big thing\n\nin primary colors would be useful.\n\nI flopped a nut straight.\n\n[chips rattle]\n\nMotherfucker!\n\n[Teddy speaking in Russian]\n\nMotherfucker!\n\nThat is it!\n\nThat's it?\n\nWhat the fuck you talking about that's it?\n\nTake him down down, Teddy. Nyet, nyet!\n\nNo more.\n\nNo, not tonight.\n\nThis son of bitch, all night, he check, check, check.\n\nHe trapped me!\n\n[Interviewer] Matt tells a story\n\nthat's basically he was taken a little bit surprised\n\nby your performance.\n\nHe says that he hears your lines for the first time,\n\nUh-huh. And there's like,\n\na stillness in the room, and people start clapping.\n\nYeah. And you lean over to him,\n\nand apparently you said, I'm not a very good actor.\n\nYeah, I think I may have stated it\n\nmore strongly than that.\n\nI mean, I think I've pretty much been accused\n\nof doing everything from chewing the walls and scenery\n\nand doing nothing like a statue.\n\nThere is a choice you can make\n\nof how far to go with something,\n\nand that was really more about that choice.\n\nThe execution was more or less exactly what I chose to do,\n\nbut of course, when you do something that size,\n\nit's risky.\n\nIt's a fucking joke anyway.\n\nAfter all, I am paying you with your money.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nWhat'd you say?\n\nYour money.\n\nI am still up 20 grand\n\nfrom this last time I stick it in you.\n\nGreat fun to film.\n\nVery much enjoyed Matt.\n\nGood group of people and actors.\n\nI liked John Dahl very much.\n\nI hung out a lot with Brian Koppelman\n\nand David Levine, the writers,\n\nand they had said at one point,\n\nWe want you to play a Russian in all our films,\n\nand we'll do this one and that one, et cetera.\n\nAnd then just a couple years ago, actually,\n\nI finished it last year,\n\nthey asked me to play a Russian oligarch\n\nin their series Billions,\n\nwhich they were the showrunners for, which was great fun.\n\nSo this is the moment you lead with your chest.\n\nLike Con Air, it continues to have an audience,\n\nand I do remember, Pay that man his money.\n\nHe beat me, straight up.\n\nPay him.\n\nPay that man his money.\n\nWhich I thought was quite a good line.\n\nQuite stylish, actually.\n\nI don't know that I delivered it stylishly.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nDangerous Liaisons, Vicomte de Valmont.\n\nIn Dangerous Liaisons, I played the Vicomte de Valmont,\n\nabout which was said,\n\nI think it was one of the great introductory lines,\n\ncertainly to any character I ever played.\n\nCecile Volanges, who was played by Uma Thurman.\n\nSwoosie Kurtz, who played Uma's mother,\n\nwhen Valmont's name comes up, had the line,\n\nThe Vicomte de Valmont, my child.\n\nWhom you very probably don't remember,\n\nexcept that he is conspicuously charming,\n\nnever opens his mouth\n\nwithout first calculating what damage he can do.\n\nThen why do you receive him, maman?\n\nEveryone receives him.\n\nThis is a play\n\nthat was based on the French novel by Choderlos de Laclos,\n\nwhich was set right before the time\n\nof the French Revolution, end of the 18th century.\n\nDe Laclos was an artillery officer in the French Army\n\nwho wrote a letter to a friend of his,\n\nsaying that he was planning to write a novel\n\nthat would shock the world and would live long after him,\n\nand in a very short time, he did so.\n\nI had read the book, I loved the play,\n\nand I worked many, many years\n\nwith a theater in Chicago called The Steppenwolf Theater\n\nthat we started when we were kids out of university.\n\nWe had read it, and the thing had just made us so sick,\n\ndepressed us so greatly,\n\nthat it really stuck in my mind that I'd like to direct it.\n\nIt's beyond my control.\n\nLiar!\n\nLiar!\n\nYou're quite right, I am a liar.\n\nAnd it's like your fidelity, a fact of life.\n\nNo more nor less irritating.\n\nCertainly beyond my control.\n\n[Madame de Tourvel] Stop it.\n\nDon't keep saying that.\n\n[Madame de Tourvel screams]\n\nSorry. Beyond my control.\n\nThat was my principal interest in it,\n\nand then I was having a meeting\n\nwith Bernie Brillstein and Ileen Maisel.\n\nThey told me they were doing Les liaisons,\n\nand I said, Oh, wow, fantastic.\n\nAnd then Ileen just suddenly said, Do you wanna do it?\n\nAnd I said, Do what?\n\nTo direct or be in it?\n\nI had a great but quite difficult relationship sometimes\n\nwith Stephen Frears.\n\nStephen had come to the play I was doing on Broadway\n\nbefore we started shooting, a few months before.\n\nHe came backstage, and he said,\n\nSo, why is it you're actually not so good in movies?\n\nReally why?\n\nBecause I don't control them.\n\nI mean, you go on a stage,\n\nnobody stops and says, oh, do this, do that, do this.\n\nStage is ephemeral, stage is flowing.\n\nOne thing grows from another\n\nand leads to another and another and another.\n\nSo he said, So to be good in a movie,\n\nyou would have to have some control.\n\nAnd I said, Well, if you're asking honestly, yeah.\n\nWe could argue about things,\n\nnot in some terrible way or anything, like,\n\nthat's neither of our styles, I think,\n\nbut I learned a lot on that film, I think,\n\nfrom Stephen, from the actors always that I work with,\n\nand from Philippe Rousselot, who was the cinematographer,\n\nbut also a great deal from an English camera operator\n\ncalled Mike Fox.\n\nI would argue with Mike Fox that I wanted it like this\n\nor I wanted it like that or like that,\n\nand then I would go to dailies and go, Boy, that sucks.\n\nAnd then go, pretty much every night,\n\nMike, sorry, just wanted to apologize.\n\nYou're right.\n\nYou know, I must have said that 600 times, I don't know.\n\nPretty charged, pretty tight schedule, very low budget,\n\nbut Stephen, I think, did a terrific job with it,\n\nthe great costumer James Acheson,\n\nGeorge Fenton, great score,\n\nKeanu, who was just fantastic.\n\nOnce, I ran into him when my kids were tiny.\n\nI went to Winchell's Donuts on Melrose and Rossmore.\n\nWalked in and I see Keanu,\n\nand he's like, Man, what are you doing, like,\n\nin, like, Hollywood?\n\nAnd I said, Keanu, is that really the question?\n\nIsn't the question more what you're doing in Hollywood?\n\nAnd then he, I'll never forget this,\n\nhe looked at myself and these two tiny kids\n\nand he goes, Just another day in Babylon.\n\n[swords scraping]\n\n[Danceny grunting]\n\nThat was choreographed\n\nby the great English fight choreographer Bill Hobbs.\n\nKeanu's super athletic and very good at that stuff.\n\n[Danceny grunts]\n\nFor that scene, I just remember shoveling a lot\n\nof fake snow here and there,\n\n'cause it was down in the moat,\n\nand to keep people from coming in and out\n\nwith their modern sneakers or what have you,\n\nI would just do it myself.\n\n[both grunting]\n\nIt's probably the film\n\nwhere I learned the most about filmmaking.\n\nLiaisons was a, I think,\n\nvery kind of signal event in my life, really.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nBurn After Reading, Osbourne Cox.\n\nBut how could she have access?\n\nWhat about our savings?\n\nWhat about my savings account?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nNo.\n\nNo, I'm sorry,\n\nI don't know the number to my savings account,\n\nbecause, believe it or not,\n\nI don't spend my entire day sitting around\n\ntrying to memorize the fucking numbers\n\nto my fucking bank accounts, moron!\n\nOf course, I've always liked the Coen brothers.\n\nI got the script, I liked the script very much,\n\nI called them and said, Yeah, sure, I'll do it.\n\nI loved working with them.\n\nThey are very specific, but not controlling,\n\nwhich sounds maybe a contradiction in terms,\n\nbut, I mean, I've seen directors that,\n\nif you go like this during a take,\n\nif it's not the same as the storyboard for whatever reason,\n\nthey can just be deranged, mentally deranged.\n\nThe Coen brothers, at least in my experience,\n\nwere very, very specific, but I love that, it's very clear.\n\nThere are two of them, so they don't miss anything.\n\nI don't know if they have to discuss it.\n\nThey're very experienced,\n\nobviously, they know each other exceptionally well\n\nand are exceptionally close to each other.\n\nI loved doing that, it was a lot of fun.\n\nI mean, I had a sort of, played a childish person.\n\nThis is an assault.\n\nI have a drinking problem?\n\nFuck you, Peck.\n\nYou're a Mormon. Ozzy.\n\nNext to you, we all have a drinking problem.\n\nWhat the fuck is this?\n\nAnd that had terrific actors who I enjoyed very much.\n\nI had met Brad when he was a young kid in Hollywood.\n\nI thought he was so funny in that,\n\nand extremely underrated.\n\nHe's a good actor, he's smart, he has good taste,\n\nhe's fantastic looking, and he's very funny,\n\nand I've always enjoyed watching him do that,\n\nand I think he gives a terrific performance\n\nin Burn After Reading.\n\nThat your empty little head would be spinning faster\n\nthan the wheels of your Schwinn bicycle back there.\n\nYou think that's a Schwinn.\n\nIt's funny, one of the paparazzi who was there\n\nmust have been so glad, you know,\n\nbut I was like,\n\nWhy would I be happy about hitting someone?\n\nGive us the money, dickwad.\n\nIt's funny, though, how films last, you know.\n\nLast month when the NCAA put out their choices\n\nfor the four teams for football playoffs,\n\na scene I did, the one where the character says\n\nhe's being crucified and its political.\n\nThis is a crucifixion.\n\nThis is political.\n\nThat was the big meme, apparently,\n\non the Florida State campus\n\nwhen they didn't get the call from the NCAA\n\nfor the Florida State football team to be in the finals.\n\nSo it's funny how things live on\n\nthat you don't really think that much of.\n\n[Interviewer] Has a life of its own\n\nafter you've done with it. Yeah.\n\nCompletely. Yeah.\n\nI'm never really aware of that\n\nunless somebody sends it to me.\n\nYeah. You know,\n\nand then you kind of suddenly go, That's so bizarre.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nShadow of the Vampire, F.W. Murnau.\n\nThat is when you can have her.\n\nAfter my death scene?\n\nYes.\n\nDon't expect realism there, Murnau.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nDon't cheat me, mortal.\n\nYou will stay away from her.\n\nYou will stay away from my crew.\n\nI will finish my picture!\n\nThis is hardly your picture any longer.\n\nI sound like a kind of goody two-shoes,\n\nbut generally, I don't have bad times at work,\n\nand I've been blessed to work\n\nwith spectacularly often lovely and talented,\n\neven if they're not lovely, if they're talented, great.\n\nIt was a young director called Elias Merhige.\n\nHe had done a film that Susan Sontag loved,\n\nwhich was called Begotten.\n\nA kind of hour-long film, fascinating visuals.\n\nI did a lot of studying on that,\n\nread a ton of books, both about vampires,\n\nbut real, not just nonsense,\n\nbut the kind of, the history of the idea,\n\nthe vampire, his kith and kin, vampires in Europe.\n\nFind your stick.\n\nNow, Count, as she raises the stake, what do you see?\n\nYes.\n\nYes.\n\nA wooden stake, exactly, you look at her.\n\nBetrayed.\n\nYes, you turn, you rise,\n\nyou look around.\n\nThe sun is coming.\n\nYou grab your heart in anguish.\n\nYes, and you start to die.\n\nYes, you start to die, alone, in anguish.\n\nDie, you fucking rat bastard vampire pig!\n\nSchweinhund, shit!\n\nYes, die alone!\n\nYes, the weight of the centuries bends you!\n\nAnd,\n\nend.\n\nVery condensed schedule.\n\nThe first film I remember doing.\n\nWhen I started, films were four months,\n\nthen they were three months, then they were 10 weeks,\n\nthen nine weeks, this was six weeks,\n\nand it was the first one I'd ever been on like that,\n\nso, very truncated shooting time.\n\nI did a lot of writing on it and rewriting.\n\nI mostly worked with Willem,\n\nwho I had known a tiny bit but never worked with,\n\nwho was spectacular in that film.\n\nLoved his performance, and I'm very fond of him.\n\nWhy him, you monster?\n\nWhy not the script girl?\n\n[Schreck gasps]\n\nThe script girl.\n\nI'll eat her later.\n\nIt was a kind of movie where it was so,\n\nthe time just wasn't enough time,\n\nand so we constantly kind of would find ourselves\n\nin a jam on a lot of beautiful things,\n\nincluding a whole, kind of, quarter of the film got cut,\n\nwhich was unfortunate.\n\nI tried to get Nic Cage,\n\nwho was the producer, really, and developed it,\n\nand he may have developed it even for himself\n\nor because he loved either the monster character\n\nor F.W. Murnau, who made Nosferatu.\n\nI just remember writing a lot and trying to condense things,\n\nand when we ended, I thought we needed another day\n\nor two of reshoots, and they didn't want to do it,\n\nand I respected that, 'cause it's their film,\n\nit's not my film, I'm an actor in it.\n\nWhat Nic saw in the original script was\n\nthe kind of Herzog-Kinski thing.\n\nI saw that, but I saw other things as well\n\nthat I don't want to say they were equally important,\n\nbecause I like the film\n\nand I especially like Willem in the film.\n\nI wish we would've had those extra couple of days.\n\nOf course, you know,\n\nyou can feel very strongly about something\n\nand be absolutely wrong.\n\nI mean, this is the kind of nature of this beast.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe New Look, Lucian Lelong.\n\nTake this one as well, Christian.\n\nIt should have some value.\n\nFind your sister, and then afterwards, come back,\n\nand make the House of Lelong a success once more.\n\nGood luck.\n\nTodd had explained to me\n\nwhere the character was situated in this story,\n\nwhich is about Christian Dior and Coco Chanel,\n\nabout the life at the very end of the occupation in Paris\n\nat the end of the Second World War.\n\nPeople sometimes ask me about preparation.\n\nThat can mean a lot of things.\n\nThe thing I most prepare is the script.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nWhat do I have to do in this?\n\nWhat do I say?\n\nDo I understand it?\n\nIs it the right thing to say?\n\nIs it compelling?\n\nIs it interesting?\n\nWhat's my function,\n\nmeaning the character's function, in this?\n\nAnd also, what are my character's actions?\n\nDo I understand them?\n\nDo they make sense?\n\nNot in the sense of some kind of Psychology 101.\n\nDo they make sense in terms of the entire action\n\nand the entire scope of a story,\n\nand are they written\n\nin such a way as to be playable?\n\nAnd if the answer to either of those questions is,\n\nwhich it usually is, well, not quite here\n\nand not quite there, but generally I get it,\n\nand now let's figure these specific things out,\n\nthat was the main focus there.\n\nIn a way, you defend a character.\n\nWhat do I mean by that?\n\nTheir behavior, or their point of view, or their worldview?\n\nNo.\n\nYour job is not that,\n\nyour job is to present that character\n\nwho normally has one chance to live ever.\n\nIt can be a real person or not a real person.\n\nSo you want to present it as fully as you possibly can.\n\nThese miniature forms require less fabric,\n\nless accoutrements, less expense, less everything.\n\nThere wasn't anything that was kind of necessarily out\n\nof my level of culture or education\n\nor experience or knowledge,\n\nbecause I designed a lot of fashion lines in my time,\n\nI know France well and Paris well,\n\nbut I didn't know anything about the personal lives\n\nof these characters I had,\n\nwhich was quite interesting, as people are.\n\nI was always a huge fan of Ben Mendelsohn-\n\nYes. Since the first time\n\nI saw him in Animal Kingdom.\n\nHe's someone so unique.\n\nHe makes such singular choices.\n\nHe has a vulnerability\n\nthat most men don't care to show\n\nunless it's a kind of shtick, and his isn't.\n\nHe has a great access to his emotions,\n\nand that's pretty rare, I think, in actors.\n\nI've seen it numerous times in actresses,\n\nbut he's not all blocked up.\n\nYeah. He's right there.\n\nVery quicksilver, interesting choices,\n\nand just wonderful to watch, not just to work with.\n\nSometimes you love working with someone,\n\nbut he's really both.\n\nHe's fascinating to watch."
