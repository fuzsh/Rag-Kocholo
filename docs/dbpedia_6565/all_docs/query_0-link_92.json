On something of a whim I decided I was going to rewatch John Dahl's debut trio of neo-noirs, regarded by many as the best films in his career (although I am a big fan of Joy Ride and I haven't seen Rounders yet), and quite possibly the three films which started me off when it came to watching neo-noirs. I haven't seen Kill Me Again, Red Rock West or The Last Seduction since my university days, but there was a splendid period of neo-noirs produced around about the time these were made.",

        "text": "The cat version of this has seven sequels.\n\nOn something of a whim I decided I was going to rewatch John Dahl's debut trio of neo-noirs, regarded by many as the best films in his career (although I am a big fan of Joy Ride and I haven't seen Rounders yet), and quite possibly the three films which started me off when it came to watching neo-noirs.\n\nI haven't seen Kill Me Again, Red Rock West or The Last Seduction since my university days, but there was a splendid period of neo-noirs produced around about the time these were made. I remember watching loads of this sort of thing back then - the likes of Kalifornia, Romeo Is Bleeding, Devil In A Blue Dress, Bound, One False Move and The Hot Spot were others I really favoured back then as well. I haven't seen any of those since around the same time either. Hmm, maybe a project in the offing....\n\nAlthough I do like the traditional noir just fine, I think I gravitated towards the updated versions more because they were able to be a lot more adult with their content. It doesn't necessarily mean that more sex, violence and bad language improves anything, really, but this is one genre that certainly benefits more often than not. They just spoke to me a little bit quicker than the originals did, perhaps as much because I was a depraved youngster with a thirst for blood and shagging. Not like the fine, upstanding gentleman I am today!\n\nThis rewatch of Kill Me Again shows me this was Dahl just finding his footing. It's pretty assured for a debut feature but it also plays it relatively safe comparatively speaking. The plot is kept fairly simple, there's only one real twist (and it is a good one) and it has a very small and easy-to-follow cast. He doesn't take too many risks with this and it works pretty well as a result.\n\nIf it has one failing, it's Val Kilmer. He's never been an actor I've ever really looked forward to seeing in anything and I have never subscribed to the theory that he's some great, wasted talent. I don't dislike him or anything, he's just rather bland and, in this case, blank. Compared to Salford's finest Joanne Whalley (now she definitely IS a great wasted talent), superb as the scheming femme fatale, and Michael Madsen in the second best performance of his career, he really doesn't stand up all that well. Remember when Madsen was good? That didn't last long, did it.\n\nIt doesn't harm the film too much though. If it was more ambitious and expansive, then maybe his blandness would have been more exposed. As it is, Kill Me Again remains a solid and enjoyable example of a sub-genre I do love ever so much."
