        "text": "In the 60’s, French film critics\n\nbegan seeing patterns in some of the (mostly low-budget) American\n\ndramas made post WWII. Seen as a symptom of post-war trauma and as\n\na reaction against the burgeoning suburban \"Happy Days\"\n\ndenial, they noted that films (many made by expatriate Europeans)\n\nlike The Big Heat, Out cf The Past, Kiss of Death and Double\n\nIndemnity, besides greatly relying on nighttime exteriors, all\n\nshared a cynical and dark view of humankind, hence their new term,\n\n\"film noir,\" literally, \"black film.\"\n\nWriter/director John\n\nDahl’s three films, Kill Me Again, Red Rock West, and the\n\nupcoming The Last Seduction, work extensively with the\n\nthemes of film noir—­moneylust, entrapment, deceptive women, societal\n\ncorruption, the double, triple and even quadruple cross, innocents\n\ncaught up in rapidly snowballing criminal circumstances, and the\n\ninability to escape our troubled pasts.\n\nUnlike the \"Naked\n\nCity\" settings of the past, Dahl’s films inhabit the world\n\nhe knows best-that of stifling, small town white America. A world\n\nof beat-up 70s­era white Cadillacs (\"a great symbol of decaying\n\nAmerica\"), nameless gas stations on the edge of town, no-tell\n\nmotels (\"the kind with rubber sheets that haven’t been rented\n\nin a month but still smell like smoke\" laughs Dahl), truck\n\nstops, and ugly small town bars (\"those are special places,\"\n\nhe says, without a hint of sarcasm).\n\nNot surprisingly, Montana-born\n\nDahl started filmmaking at a decidedly backwoods locale, Montana\n\nState University Film School.\n\n\"I had a great time there,\" he says of his days\n\nat MSU. \"In those days they sorta just gave you the equipment,\n\nand as long as you could afford to put film in the camera you\n\ncould do what you wanted. There was not a lot of film theory offered,\n\nbut what I did was take a lot of drama courses and English courses,\n\nbecause I realized early on I needed to be able to write and work\n\nwith actors if I was gonna make movies. For such a small school,\n\nthere are a lot of MSU grads working in the film business in LA.\"\n\nThe Death Mutants, Dahl’s first feature, \"a totally irreverent send-up of\n\na horror film\" was made in his senior year at MSU (\"and\n\nnot seen since\") with the help of David Warfield, who would\n\ngo on to co-write Kill Me Again.\n\nMoving to Los Angeles,\n\nDahl found work in music video production and used those connections\n\n(and experience as storyboard artist for Robocop, Something\n\nWild, and Married To The Mob) to shop around spec scripts,\n\nthe seventh of which became his first official feature release.\n\nProduced for $4.5 million\n\nby Propaganda Films (Kalifornia, Wild At Heart), primarily\n\na music video company, Kill Me Again marks the initial\n\nexploration of themes that would come to full fruit in his later\n\nfilms. Like all of Dahl’s films to date, Kill Me Again was\n\nmet with strong critical and industry acclaim, and studio indifference.\n\nRed Rock West, made\n\nin 1992 and currently in theatrical (and video) release, shows\n\nDahl moving up from the more derivative (if enjoyable) detective\n\nfiction stylings of Kill Me Again to fully forge his own\n\nstyle – a giddy, thrill-ride mix of film-noir conventions transposed\n\nto recession-hit small town U.S.A., watchspring-tight plotting,\n\nbut with enough looseness to let the humor of absurd natural situations\n\ncome to life.\n\nWith a $7.5 million budget\n\nagain put up by Propaganda Films, the script was strong enough\n\nto gain the services of three top stars: Nicolas Cage, Dennis\n\nHopper and Laura Flynn Boyle. Dalil feels the casting was paramount\n\nto the film’s success.\n\n\"With Red Rock,\" he remembers, \"we thought\n\nwe were walking the edge between where it’s gonna be pretty good\n\nor just terrible, where people would be watching it and saying,\n\n‘Oh, yeah – this is ridiculous. I can’t believe he would do that.’\n\nWe were very fortunate to be able to get Nicolas Cage for the\n\nlead role because he really can walk that line between dramatic\n\nreality and comedic absurdity better than almost anybody.\n\n\"Hopper, too, is amazing in his ability to be totally\n\nmenacing and yet bring out this complete nervous laughter. Near\n\nthe end of the movie there’s a real dopey line where he’s impaled\n\non this statue, dyin,’ and he says to Nicolas Cage­’Hey,come back\n\nhere! I’m not done with you!’ and Nick says, ‘You know what? I\n\nam better than you.’ At one point we took those lines out\n\nbecause we thought it was too on the nose, bad, just overkill.\n\nBut Nick and Dennis could get away with lines like that, and every\n\ntime I’ve seen it, people just go bananas at that scene.\"\n\nHopper, whose former\n\nreputation as a drugged hell-raiser (including stabbing people,\n\nperforming stunts with explosives at rodeos and appearing in a Hustler magazine photo spread!) is legendary, is quite\n\na different man since his post – Blue Velvet sobriety.\n\n\"He’s one of the\n\nnicest guys I met in Hollywood,\" Dahl says, \"really\n\neasy to work with, a complete gentleman. I think he feels he missed\n\nout on those years he was intoxicated, and so he works harder\n\nthan anyone around. But I must admit, it was a little intimidating\n\nworking with him because at this point he’s directed seven movies,\n\nand this is only my second movie. He coulda’ chewed me up and\n\nspit me out!\"\n\nThe story of a down-and-out\n\nvet (Cage) who gets confused with a hired killer (Hopper), Red\n\nRock West, like classic film noir and the best drama, concentrates\n\nnot on the act of murder or robbery but on the human dramas and\n\nmoral dilemmas surrounding it.\n\nCountry singer Dwight Yoakam, who makes a strong debut as\n\na truck driver who almost shoots Cage, had contacted Dahl after\n\nseeing Kill Me Again to work on a long-form music video.\n\nWhen Dahl was impressed enough to offer him his first dramatic\n\nrole, Yoakam jumped at the chance.\n\n\"We had Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, J.T. Walsh and Laura\n\nFlynn Boyle all staying at this tiny hotel in Wilcox, Arizona,\"\n\nDahl remembers. \"The town was like, ‘Yeah, this is exciting,’\n\nbut when Dwight showed up, everyone in that town just freaked\n\nout.\"\n\nYoakam’s closing theme, 1000 Miles From Nowhere, which\n\nwas later a Top 10 country hit, was written in 1992 when the film\n\nwas being made.\n\n\"I told him I wanted a Roy Orbison­ sounding song to\n\nend the movie with, and he saw the final cut and really wanted\n\nto have it be one of his songs over the end credits. So I said\n\n‘great.’ That was in the morning. In the afternoon he called me\n\nup and sang me this song over the phone.\"\n\nDespite glowing reviews and strong business in its recent\n\nlimited city-by-city theatrical release, Red Rock West was\n\noriginally dumped straight to cable TV and videocassette almost\n\na year ago.\n\n\"Red Rock was\n\nfinanced with a negative pick-up deal,\" he explains, \"selling\n\noff the cable TV, video and overseas rights. It costs so much\n\nto release a film in the U.S. – a minimum of $3 million for prints\n\nand advertising with a major distributor- they have to feel like\n\nthere is a guarantee of recouping that, which is sad for moviegoers,\n\nbecause a lot of interesting small films are having a harder and\n\nharder time reaching the theater.\n\n\"Studios have this blockbuster mentality. They have this\n\ndesire to make $200 million dollars, even if they have to spend\n\n$100 million to do it. If it costs them $10 million and it makes\n\n$30 million, they’re somehow disappointed, even though most businesses\n\nwould be thrilled with a $10 million dollar profit.\"\n\n\"That’s the beauty of a company like Roxie Releasing,\"\n\nhe says of the distributor who later bought the film’s theatrical\n\nrights. \"It’s one guy, Bill Banning, who owns an art house\n\ntheater in San Francisco, and every now and then he obtains the\n\nrights to a small movie. He’s kinda like David fighting Goliath.\n\nThey have a vested interest in pushing it, gathering word\n\nof mouth, good reviews, going from city to city to city, but to\n\nhim it’s worth it, but unless you’re talking about a hundred million,\n\nto Columbia Tri-Star it’s not worth bothering with.\"\n\n\"Finishing Red Rock was a really grueling process,\n\nand I really wasn’t in the mood to work on starting another screenplay,\n\nand out of the blue this quirky, very original script was sent\n\nto me.\"\n\nUnlike the past, the desire that drove so many of the classic\n\nfilm noir’s characters is not merely implied. Originally called Buffalo Gals, The Last Seduction is one of the more sexually\n\nexplicit films in recent memory, as Bridget Gregory fucks her\n\nsuitors in every sense of the word, playing with their minds,\n\nplotting against them and sexing them in an emotionless, animal\n\nlike fashion.\n\n\"They (ITC) were kinda worried it would get an NC-17,\n\nbut it got an R (rating). I think it’s because she’s in the driver’s\n\nseat, sexually, the whole time. And that changes the whole dynamic.\n\nShe’s using him. She’s raping him from the first time she sees\n\nhim to the end of the movie.\n\nWhen we were shooting that scene where they’re goin’ at it\n\nagainst the chain link fence behind the bar, and there are people\n\nwalking out the back door, Peter thought it was gonna be pornographic.\n\nI said, ‘Peter, this isn’t a Zalman King movie-you’re doin’ it\n\nnext to the trash cans! This is gonna be funny!\"’\n\nWhile already having played Europe and Australia, at this\n\nwriting the only place Yanks can definitely catch The Last\n\nSeduction is on cable.\n\n\"With a small independent film, when distributors in\n\nHollywood look at it they get nervous, but if it starts getting\n\na reaction from critics or festival audiences, they get a little\n\nmore faith. But the makers of the film jumped the gun, haven’t\n\nscreened it much and were content just to sell it to HBO.\n\nThere is a distributor interested in it because of Red\n\nRock, they feel there’s a different audience there that would\n\nsee it in the theater as opposed to watching it on cable. I think\n\nthe success of Red Rock has broken conventional ideas,\n\nand proven that lotsa people: a) don’t have cable, or B) still\n\nlike to see things on the big screen.\"\n\nWith only three films,\n\nDahl is amused to find himself being stereotyped by critics and\n\nindustry people.\n\n\"I never set out\n\nto be a `film noir director,\"’ he says. \"Only after\n\nbeing given the opportunity to make a few movies have I begun\n\nseeing themes and patterns, but I have to say that what is there\n\nis totally subconscious, not deliberately thought out at all.\n\nI do like the moral dilemma, which is a big theme in film noir.\n\nI think that’s something everyone sorta wrestles with.\n\n\"When you make a\n\nmovie, I feel you should try to make it as timeless as possible.\n\nWhen dealing with situations, and making choices in writing or\n\ndirecting, I kinda think, `well, how’s this gonna look in 15 years?\n\nOr 20 years? What can we do to make it call the least attention\n\nto itself as far as the time in which it was made’?\n\n\"I’ve always liked\n\nclassic themes, the Greek tragedy kind of dramatic structures.\n\nTo me, film noir is dealing with those timeless themes of drama,\n\nnot just having people sit around and smoke, drink and talk like\n\nthey’re in a Micky Spillane book in rooms with Venetian blinds\n\non the windows.\"\n\nExcited to be making\n\na sharp change of style, Dahl is currently in Austria shooting Meltdown, a John (Halloween) Carpenter nuclear power\n\nsuspense story which will star Dolph Lundgren.\n\n\"My goal is just\n\nto try to make films that are entertaining,\" Dahl says. \"People\n\nlook down on ‘entertainment’ – but I think it requires a great\n\ndeal of artistic ability to involve and amuse an intelligent audience.\n\nThat in itself, I feel is a major accomplishment.\"\n\nAuthor Keith Bearden\n\nhas written for Fangoria, Psychotronic, The Nose, and other publications.
