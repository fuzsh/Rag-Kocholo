        "text": "With its shadows and gallows humor, “You Kill Me” goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody. Its ethnic stereotypes are Polish mobsters from Buffalo, which just means that they eat kielbasa instead of Italian sausage and traffic in real snow. They don’t have much juice, only a chunk of the city, but they speak the same patois as the usual players, doing shakedowns and takedowns between analyzing this and that. They’re not especially wise, these guys; if anything, they’re kind of sad.\n\nThat isn’t readily apparent when the film’s star, Ben Kingsley, enters, wearing a black watch cap, black clothes and a black goatee that would look dandy on Lucifer or a bass player in a death-metal band. Unnamed as of yet, and to judge by his liverish looks, probably unwell, he takes a slug from a bottle of vodka, then tosses it into the fresh snow blanketing his lawn, where the bottle sits chilling until he shovels it up. Whereupon he takes another slug, tosses the bottle and shovels yet more snow, repeating this cute trick all the way to the curb. He looks like an inkblot against all that white, like a mistake that needs cleaning up.\n\nThere isn’t a lot of gray in “You Kill Me,” colorwise or otherwise. The hot whites and jet blacks suggest that the director John Dahl, whose credits include the 1990s noirs “Red Rock West” and “The Last Seduction,” would have been happy to drain all the color out of this picture. As it is, the chromatically reduced palette nicely echoes the stark inner and outer worlds of Mr. Kingsley’s character, Frank Falenczyk, an alcoholic hit man on an uninterrupted bender. For Frank, that chilling vodka bottle isn’t just a morning pick-me-up; it’s also a way of life, his closest companion and, increasingly, a grave liability. Lost in a boozy blur, he doesn’t shoot to kill; he sleeps all the way through a job.\n\nWhat follows is straight-up ridiculous, but it’s also consistently funny and nicely played by a well-complemented cast that finds its collective groove and never misses a beat. Tossed out of Buffalo by his loving mobster family (headed by Philip Baker Hall, whose natural gravitas fits like a bespoke suit), Frank sobers up in San Francisco. There, within retching distance of the Tenderloin and on the same mean, steeply graded streets where Sam Spade chased bad men and gin, Frank tremblingly starts living one day at a time. He finds a pad, courtesy of Bill Pullman; a buddy, courtesy of Luke Wilson; and a gig prettying up corpses at a funeral parlor. He’s at ease with the dead; it’s the living that pose a problem.\n\nThere’s more packed into Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely’s rudely funny script, more twists, kinks and laughs, including a few from the dark-haired love bomb who always seems ready to detonate a John Dahl movie. Here the woman of interest is played by the serially underemployed Téa Leoni, whose sexy, shaded turn as Frank’s improbable inamorata, Laurel, makes you regret all the roles this talented actress hasn’t nabbed — or perhaps aren’t being written for women. Under-realized, with no apparent friends and farcical taste in men, the character makes no sense, but it doesn’t matter. You believe her, partly because Ms. Leoni makes cozying up to danger seem like the most natural thing in the world, partly because it’s just nice having this actress around.\n\nIt’s also swell to have Mr. Kingsley tick-tick-ticking, holding Frank’s rage in until he can’t. An insistently imposing screen presence, whether walking into a room or holding a gun, Mr. Kingsley makes a scarily persuasive villain, as he proved so capably in “Sexy Beast.” The glower and bald head certainly help; he looks like a bullet. But it’s what he does with his body, the way he keeps his gestures tightly coiled, as if he were summoning up all of Frank’s strength just to keep from lashing out, and the absolute stillness with which he holds his body, as if the center of Earth’s gravity had relocated to his bowels, that really does the trick. He’s a bullet, but here he’s also in the chamber ready to fire.\n\n“You Kill Me” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Salty language, spilled blood and gunplay.\n\nYOU KILL ME\n\nOpens today in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington and Chicago.\n\nDirected by John Dahl; written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; director of photography, Jeffrey Jur; edited by Scott Chestnut; music by Marcelo Zarvos; production designer, John Dondertman; produced by Carol Baum, Mike Marcus, Zvi Howard Rosenman, Al Corley, Bart Rosenblatt and Eugene Musso; released by IFC Films. Running time: 92 minutes.\n\nWITH: Ben Kingsley (Frank), Téa Leoni (Laurel), Luke Wilson (Tom), Dennis Farina (O’Leary), Philip Baker Hall (Roman), Bill Pullman (Dave) and Marcus Thomas (Stef)."
