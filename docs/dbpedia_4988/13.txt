Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) (zerofltexx)

e-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98

First, I simply installed the new ROM e-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98 from the internal storage without a PC using e-Rocovery V1.20 via Apply update > choose from internal storage

The system boots, but remains at the animated e-logo for a long time. Nothing continues, not even after a factory reset.

I then installed the new e-Recovery V2.0, which immediately displayed error messages (see Fig. 1). In addition, the touchscreen did not work, but the device hardware button did.

After a factory reset and reboot into the e-Recovery V2.0, additional error messages were displayed (see picture 2).

Failure messages

Now I installed the Recovery OranageFox OrangeFox-R11.1-Stable-zerofltexx-1080p without errors, then e-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98 also without error messages.

The V2.0 system boots, but stops at the animated e-logo as before. Nothing continues.

Finally, I reinstalled /e/ e-1.20-r-20240223-UNOFFICIAL by ronnz98.zip with the OF recovery without any errors - and everything is working fine again.

The installation of boot.img and recovery e-2.0-t-20240531-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 using the pre-installed TWRP TWRP 3.7.0_9.0 is possible, but is accompanied by error messages.

e-Recovery error messages

After a factory reset, e-recovery freezes; it is not possible to return to the initial menu. e-Recovery can no longer be operated. My previously functioning S6 is no longer usable. I completely reset it and install stock firmware Android 7.x

e-2.0-t-20240531-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 boots now

I can’t verify the successful installation of build V2.0 T mentioned above!

Despite several attempts (TWRP > INSTALL + TWRP > ADB Sideload) every new installation aborts with ERROR: 1.

On the other hand, the installation of e-2.0-s-20240526-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 is an uncomplicated child’s play and every flash attempt succeeds at the first attempt.

Note: The e-rocovery contained in the ROM.zip is definitely unusable. It aborts every installation attempt, whether e-2.0-s or e-2.0-t by @ronnz98

My recommendation is:

Version of ROM: e-2.0-r-20240508-UNOFFICIAL-zeroltexx by @ronnz98

Version of Recovery: TWRP 3.7.0_9.0 or OrangeFox-R11.1-Stable-zerofltexx
