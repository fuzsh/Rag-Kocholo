        "text": "If your settings (S6 USB debugging, driver, Android Studio) are correct, you might try the following:\n\n(On phone) turn USB Debugging OFF\n\nConnect S6 to USB\n\nClick on the notification \"connected as MTP device\", check the option \"camera\" (also appropriate for non-MTP connection)\n\nturn USB Debugging back ON\n\nIf your device runs Android 6, the notification (step 3 above) should say \"Use USB for\" and offer 4 choices. You want to click on \"Transferring Images\".\n\nI had the same problem. I tried with another USB cable (Not the one comes with my s6 edge or any samsung product ) and it worked.\n\n(prior to this i spend almost a day by installing some software and all :(..but only above solution worked for me )\n\nIf you see the connected device in the \"Other devices\" of the Device Manager, try adding \"Hardware Ids\" of it to android_winusb.inf. Then select \"Update Driver Software\" in the Device Manager. The detail can be found in the link below. In my environment, adb_usb.ini was not there, so I skipped it but could recognize my Galaxy S6 Edege. http://jodieorourke.com/view.php?id=190&blog=news\n\nPlease use another USB cable which is not coming wth a Samsung mobile. it will work for sure. I wasted almost 2 days fixing this issue finally went out and buy another cable. It worked. No need for any other software change.\n\nCheers...\n\nI know I'm a bit late to answer, but maybe it will help other people in future. Me too I've got a Samsung S7 Edge, and couldn't debug with it. After some checking I realized that the reason is the Knox/My Knox. See here: https://seap.samsung.com/forum-topic/can-i-use-usb-debugging-mode-device-running-knox What I've done is just go to playstore, found there My Knox and clicked Uninstall, then switched on USB debugging in Developer options that was previously grayed out. (There are some other manuals on how to disable Knox. Some of them require rooting, but after rooting, I believe Samsung warranty will not work, if something happens to your phone. )"
