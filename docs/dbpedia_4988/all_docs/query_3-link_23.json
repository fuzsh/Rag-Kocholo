        "text": "When was the last time a brand logo stirred any feelings in you?\n\nWas it the optimistic yellow of Mcdonald’s that suggested warmth and clarity?\n\nWas it the trustworthy blue of Dell that felt dependable and secure?\n\nColor is a strong personality trait of a logo, which has the ability to reflect certain emotions from the design onto an audience.\n\nWhat Are Colors & Why Do They Matter\n\nColors are visible wavelengths of light that can be perceived and processed by the human eye and brain. In logo designing, colors play a critical role. They communicate the values and personality of a brand identity.\n\nHere is what colors can do:-\n\nColors evoke feelings and emotions in people. This is because all colors have moods. For example, while purple is considered creative and imaginative, red signifies energy and passion.\n\nHandy Tip – study the psychology of colors\n\nA strong color palette can help a brand stand out. This proves truly successful in a concentrated market where all brands are trying to grab customer attention.\n\nHandy Tip – use a color palette tool to make color schemes\n\nA unique color palette helps one brand differentiate itself from another. This allows your brand’s logo design to pop out from the crowd and become memorable.\n\nHandy Tip – use the Pantone color system to come up with unique hues\n\nColors have cultural meanings that help brands connect with certain markets. For example, in Western culture white is associated with cleanliness and purity but in the Eastern part of the world, it represents mourning.\n\nHandy Tip – study the culture and then enter the market\n\nWhy Make Emotionally Appealing Color Palettes\n\nImagine a world without colors? Well, just watch a black-and-white movie. While you will enjoy a classic for some time, you’ll eventually get bored because the human eye is naturally accustomed to a range of colors.\n\nWhat we feel for colors depends on a number of factors:\n\nOur relationship with a color\n\nOur experience with a color\n\nOur cultural background\n\nOur personal preferences\n\nCreating emotionally appealing color palettes is important because colors can evoke feelings in people and influence their decision-making and behavior.\n\nEmotions trigger people to take certain actions. These actions can be as simple as clicking a button or starting the car to reach a store.\n\nWhen used effectively, color palettes can create strong emotional connections in branding and marketing. This emotional liaison can improve the quality of brand loyalty, increase leads and sales, and enhance brand engagement.\n\nHow to Make Emotionally Appealing Color Palettes\n\nWhile having a color palette that triggers emotions is good, we have to focus on how professional designers can make a color scheme. Also, it is vital to evoke positive, relevant, and worthwhile emotions rather than negative or unpleasant ones.\n\n1) Study Color Associations\n\nIt is not necessary that red logos will always mean passion and vigor, they can also signify danger and violence. When working with colors, it is essential to research all about them. Red is just one color but it stands for many things. The same goes for each and every color in the spectrum. Each hue, shade, and tone has a positive and negative connotation. Red has been used for logos in a variety of industries like tech, entertainment, and eCommerce.\n\nImage Source: wikimedia.org\n\nImage Source: wikimedia.org\n\nImage Source: wikimedia.org\n\n2) Understand Color Relationships\n\nPicking colors to make a successful color palette requires logo designers to understand how colors interact with each other and how they can be used to make emotional designs. Let’s take a look at the relationship between red and yellow. It is known that red increases appetite and yellow cheers people up. Thus, brands like Burger King, Hardees, and Maggi have red and yellow logos. This combination helps these fast food brands attract their target customers.\n\nImage Source: wikipedia.org\n\nImage Source: wikipedia.org\n\n3) Search for Color Inspirations\n\nEmotions can be triggered by anything around us. Instead of only relying on your brand, search for color inspirations in other things such as flora and fauna, art and craft, or natural resources. Whether you’re looking for a single color or an entire palette, these inspirations can help you make designs that kindle all kinds of subtle and drastic emotions.\n\nImage Source: yesimadesigner.com\n\n4) Refer to the Color Wheel\n\nWhile many logos are colored in one hue, there are many others that have two, three, or five colors. When adding more than one color to the logo design, it is good to refer to the color wheel. What is that? It is a tool that shows the relationship of colors to one another. It allows you to make harmonious or complementary palettes. Colors that work in harmony reflect a soothing and calm feeling. Contrasting colors create excitement and energy.\n\nImage Source: artpalette.online/color-theory\n\n5) Observe Audience Behavior\n\nIf you won’t understand the behavior, attitude, feelings, and emotions of your target audience then you won’t know how to make a color palette that will influence and inspire them. If you are targeting millennials who are advocates of environmentally friendly brand practices then perhaps the tones and shades of green will help you attract their attention.\n\n6) Decide On Brand Personality\n\nWhat kind of brand personality are you looking to create? For example, Apple went with sophistication so the color black and grey fit the picture. Red Bull went with thrill and excitement so a bright yellow and red looks perfect. Harley Davidson probably wanted a rugged look so it went with an earthy brown and black combination.\n\nImage Source: wikipedia.org\n\nImage Source: wikipedia.org\n\nImage Source: wikipedia.org\n\n7) Think About Color Uniqueness\n\nAvoid using cliche color palettes that have been used by several brands in the past. Another great way to make emotionally appealing color palettes for your logo is to pick unique colors that intrigue the audience and creates a sense of mystery. The palette can be as unconventional, bizarre, or even sober (in a new way) as you like.\n\nImage Source: underconsideration.com\n\nImage Source: underconsideration.com\n\nImage Source: underconsideration.com\n\nFor example, Pantone 448C was once considered the “ugliest color” but even with that hue, we derived color palettes for brands. Not that I am suggesting that a unique color should be ugly, but it should be different than the one logo designers usually use.\n\nMost Common Colors & What They Signify\n\nColors are a powerful tool that ignites all sorts of emotions in people. Here are some common colors and their meanings.\n\nRED\n\nThe color red is considered to be exciting, passionate, and energetic. However, some shades of red evoke a sense of warning and danger.
