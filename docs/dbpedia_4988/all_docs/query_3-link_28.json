        "text": "Introduction\n\nAcross languages and cultural traditions, we use colour to express and convey emotional states. We feel blue, see red, or we are green with envy; we wear white to weddings and black to funerals; and we give red hearts to our loved ones on Valentine’s Day. It seems that colour–emotion associations are ubiquitous (e.g., Adams & Osgood, 1973; Allen & Guilford, 1936; Hupka, Zaleski, Otto, Reidl, & Tarabrina, 1997; Ou et al., 2018; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994). One detail should, however, not be neglected: The first examples are concerned with affective colour expressions, omnipresent in language (Soriano & Valenzuela, 2009), while the remaining examples are concerned with colour perceptions. Actual research into colour–emotion associations have used both colour patches (e.g., Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994) and colour terms (e.g., Adams & Osgood, 1973). When using patches, great effort is put into how colours appear by controlling colour presentation (see Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994). Researchers can carefully control the three colour dimensions of hue, saturation, and lightness (Hunt & Pointer, 2011) and test a myriad of colours. When using terms, researchers have little control over the colour participants think of. In such studies, researchers can present fewer colours and the colours are presented as words. Considering these methodological differences, we have little a priori knowledge to predict whether and, if so, which colour–emotion relationships would be the same or different, when a person is presented with patches or terms.\n\nThe roles of language versus perception have been considered in various theoretical frameworks. The conceptual metaphor theory emphasises the role of language in colour–emotion associations (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). This theory suggests that abstract concepts like affect (i.e., emotions, mood, evaluations, preferences) are metaphorically, or metonymically, linked to more concrete perceptual experiences such as colour (see also Meier & Robinson, 2005; Soriano & Valenzuela, 2009). This link would help people to better understand and describe their affective experiences. Meier and Robinson (2005) used this framework to explain the omnipresent association between positivity and lightness, which manifests in metaphorical expressions like bright day and dark thoughts (Adams & Osgood, 1973; Lakens, Fockenberg, Lemmens, Ham, & Midden, 2013; Meier, Robinson, Crawford, & Ahlvers, 2007; Specker et al., 2018). Meier and Robinson (2005) additionally argued that such metaphorical associations further reinforce these links across time, through language and cultural learning. At some point, the metaphors might function independently from the original perceptual associations and so dissociate language and perception (e.g., there is no clear perceptual base for expressions like green with envy, feeling blue, and yellow-bellied).\n\nOther frameworks are less readily apt to explain colour–emotion associations through affective metaphors. If we take the example of yellow1 and joy, this association is widely spread (Burkitt & Sheppard, 2014; Dael, Perseguers, Marchand, Antonietti, & Mohr, 2016; Jonauskaite, Althaus, Dael, Dan-Glauser, & Mohr, 2019; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Lindborg & Friberg, 2015; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016) but has no equivalent metaphorical expression, at least not in English, German, French, Lithuanian, Dutch, or Spanish. Rather, yellow is metaphorically associated with negative emotions in different languages (e.g., yellow-bellied—to be cowardly or easily scared; Gelb vor Neid sein—to be envious, rire jaune—forced laughter to hide embarrassment). Similarly, despite the expression feeling blue signifying sadness in English, blue has been repeatedly associated with positive emotions (Adams & Osgood, 1973; Jonauskaite & Mohr, 2019; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994; Wexner, 1954) and is generally a liked colour (Eysenck, 1941; Jonauskaite, Dael, et al., 2019; Palmer & Schloss, 2010) in English- and non-English-speaking countries. In such cases, visual colour perception may play a more important role than language. These associations might be rooted in repeated perceptual associations between a colour and an emotional situation, such as feeling joyful when the sun is shining or feeling good when looking at clear blue water. Such propositions have been made to explain colour preferences (Ecological Valence Theory, Palmer & Schloss, 2010) and various cross-modal relationships (structural or statistical correspondence, C. Spence, 2011).\n\nWhen appreciating the implications of the various frameworks, we would have to expect that certain colour–emotion associations might be more strongly reinforced by the linguistic system and colour metaphors (e.g., the associations between blue, and between sadness and yellow and negative emotions) and others through the perceptual system (e.g., the associations between yellow, and between joy and blue and positive emotions). In the former case, the actual colour presentation might play a more important role, while in the latter case, colour presentation might play a less important role. Moreover, there might be colour–emotion associations reinforced through both systems. For instance, the metaphorical expression seeing red associates red with feelings of anger, which would indicate a linguistic influence. Nonetheless, when one gets angry, blood rushes to the face (Benitez-Quiroz, Srinivasan, & Martinez, 2018), and so the perception of red faces in an angry situation might further strengthen the association between red and anger.\n\nOne possible approach for investigating which system, perceptual or linguistic, reinforces colour–emotion associations to a greater extent is to compare emotion associations with colour presented as patches (i.e., perceptual stimuli) versus as terms (i.e., linguistic stimuli). Despite the large body of empirical studies on colour–emotion associations, few studies have compared these methods directly (see Wang, Shu, & Mo, 2014 for a notable exception). More commonly, researchers worked separately with either colour patches (Allen & Guilford, 1936; D’Andrade & Egan, 1974; Fugate & Franco, 2019; Hanada, 2018; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Manav, 2007; Palmer, Schloss, Xu, & Prado-Leon, 2013; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994) or colour terms (Adams & Osgood, 1973; Hupka et al., 1997; Soriano & Valenzuela, 2009; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016). Researchers working with perceptual colour stimuli have criticised research studies that used linguistic colour stimuli on the basis of vagueness and imprecision (e.g., Fugate & Franco, 2019; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994). In other words, when presenting linguistic stimuli, unlike when presenting perceptual stimuli, one does not know the exact colour (how light, how saturated) participants visualised. Thus, it is unclear if emotions are attached to particular physical properties of colours, particular colour terms, or instead to particular colour concepts (i.e., abstract representations of colour combining colour perceptions with colour terms).\n\nFurthermore, different methodologies of colour assessment might tap into different associative mechanisms. For instance, Wang et al. (2014) studied which colour–emotion associations are natural (i.e., arise due to perceptual pairing) and which are social (i.e., arise due to linguistic and cultural pairing) in Chinese participants. They tested implicit valence associations with colour terms and colour patches of red and blue. The authors demonstrated that red was evaluated both positively and negatively when presented as a patch. When red was presented as a term, it was evaluated exclusively positively. The authors suggested that the association between red and negative emotions (e.g., anger) is natural. Thus, it is present when a red patch is perceived. When red is treated linguistically, however, such pairing may be overshadowed by the exclusively positive connotations of red in Chinese culture (i.e., good fortune, success, beauty, joy, etc.; Toulson, 2013)—the social associations. Hence, to obtain a more complete picture, emotion associations should be tested with both colour terms and patches.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the extent to which colour–emotion associations are comparable between colour patches and colour terms by asking participants to associate as many or as few emotion concepts (Geneva Emotion Wheel [GEW]; Scherer, 2005; Scherer, Shuman, Fontaine, & Soriano, 2013) with 12 colours. The emotion concepts differentially loaded on the emotion dimensions of valence (positive–negative), arousal (high arousal–low arousal), and power (strong–weak; Fontaine, Scherer, Roesch, & Ellsworth, 2007). Thus, we were able to analyse colour associations with specific emotions and with emotion dimensions. We also tested emotion intensity. Crucially, one group of participants associated emotion concepts with colour terms (Experiment 1), while the other group associated emotion concepts with colour patches (Experiment 2). We chose the 11 basic colour terms in French plus turquoise for the term condition and focal colours that best matched each term for the patch condition (Lindsey & Brown, 2014). The focal colours are representative members of colour categories (Abbott, Griffiths, & Regier, 2016), thus participants were likely to imagine focal colours when presented with colour terms. We expected some degree of dissimilarity between colour terms and colour patches, especially for colours that might have divergent meanings as a term and as a patch (e.g., blue, yellow).\n\nDiscussion\n\nResearch on colour–emotion associations has used colour patches or colour terms. In the former case, the perceptual attributes of colour are considered decisive. In the latter, perceptual attributes are little controlled and linguistic features are considered decisive. In this study, we tested whether colour–emotion associations were comparable when using colour terms and colour patches (similar to Wang et al., 2014). Our French-speaking participants associated a large number of emotion concepts (Scherer, 2005; Scherer et al., 2013) with a representative number of either colour terms or patches and rated the intensity of the associated emotion concepts. In our analyses, we accounted for colour associations with (a) specific emotions, (b) emotion dimensions (valence, arousal, and power; Fontaine et al., 2007), as well as (c) emotion intensity.\n\nCluster analysis indicated that colour associations with specific emotions differed in terms of frequency. Some associations were frequent (e.g., red-anger, red-love, yellow-joy), other associations occurred occasionally (e.g., blue-sadness), and still other associations were rare (e.g., blue-love). Some colours were associated with a single specific emotion (brown-disgust and white-relief), while others with several specific emotions (red-love, red-anger; yellow-joy, and yellow-amusement). Further emotion associations were better described in terms of emotion dimensions. For instance, black was associated with mainly negative emotions, grey with negative and weak emotions, blue with positive emotions, and green with positive and powerful emotions. Important to our study, colour associations with specific emotions were very similar (similarity coefficient of .82) when contrasting the associations between colour terms and patches. Similarities ranged from .79 (blue) to .96 (grey), with the exception of low similarity for purple (−.23). The degree of dissimilarity is likely due to additional perceptual or linguistic factors, or perhaps noise in the data. In this study, we observed some systematic dissimilarities between colour terms and colour patches. Participants, overall and particularly for black, (a) were more likely to select an emotion concept for terms than for patches and (b) selected emotion concepts of higher intensity for terms than for patches. Participants also associated more negative emotions with black when the colour was presented as a term than as a patch.\n\nOur study showed a high degree of similarity in colour associations with specific emotions and emotion dimensions between colour terms and colour patches, at least in a French-speaking population. This similarity might indicate that emotions are associated with an abstract representation of colour (i.e., a colour concept; Abbott et al., 2016). This abstract representation can be accessed via colour perceptions, at least when they are close to focal colours, or basic colour terms. Potentially, similar shades of colour named by the same colour term might be associated with more comparable emotions than similar shades of colour named by different colour terms. For instance, when the colour term red denoted both a typical red (i.e., potentially focal) and a dark shade of red, the same emotion associations emerged (i.e., anger and love; Fugate & Franco, 2019). In contrast, in our study, focal red (i.e., named red) was associated with positive and negative emotions (i.e., love, anger, and hate), while light red (i.e., named pink) was exclusively associated with positive emotions (i.e., love, joy, and pleasure; see also Fugate & Franco, 2019; Gil & Le Bigot, 2014; Jonauskaite, Dael, et al., 2019; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016). Despite these observations, lightness and saturation might play a more important role than hue when shades of colour are drastically different from focal colours (e.g., Dael et al., 2016; Palmer et al., 2013; Specker et al., 2018; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994).\n\nHigh similarity in emotion associations with colour terms and colour patches held for almost all colours. For instance, we replicated the widely observed association between lightness and positivity (Allan, 2009; Lakens et al., 2013; Meier et al., 2007; Specker et al., 2018; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994). Whether lightness was perceived or only imagined, white was associated with exclusively positive emotions and black and grey with exclusively negative emotions. Other colours were associated with both known and new emotions. For instance, in addition to associating yellow with joy (e.g., Fugate & Franco, 2019; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016) and brown and disgust (e.g., Fugate & Franco, 2019), our participants also associated yellow with amusement, orange with joy and amusement, and turquoise with joy and pleasure.\n\nThe only colour that exhibited different specific emotion associations when presented as a term and as a patch was purple. While the pattern of emotion associations with purple was uncorrelated between terms and patches, purple did not carry widely shared associations with emotion concepts. No emotion concept was chosen for purple by more than 20% of participants. Other empirical studies have already suggested that purple carries idiosyncratic emotion connotations (Fugate & Franco, 2019; Hemphill, 1996; Hupka et al., 1997; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016). Hence, purple might be the most affectively neutral or the most affectively ambiguous colour.\n\nAnother colour that was somewhat different between terms and patches was black. However, black did not differ in terms of which emotions were associated, only in terms of how likely the associations were. Whether black was presented as a term or a patch, it was associated with almost all of the given negative emotions (i.e., sadness, guilt, regret, disappointment, fear, disgust, contempt, hate, and anger; see also Adams & Osgood, 1973; Burkitt & Sheppard, 2014; Fugate & Franco, 2019; Hanada, 2018; Specker et al., 2018; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994). When black was a term, however, the negative associations were stronger and more intense, especially with hate, anger, regret, and sadness. Potentially, terms evoke colour percepts that differ from patches. Uusküla and Eessalu (2018) showed that the supposedly black glossy Munsell colour chip was named as black only by a minority of their participants in a colour naming study. If our black colour patch was not black enough, participants might have for that reason associated the patch with fewer negative emotions. Another possibility is the difference between black in the linguistic and perceptual contexts. Black might evoke more negative associations linguistically (e.g., black magic, blackmail, etc., Allan, 2009) rather than perceptually, the latter triggering notions of sophistication and elegance (Labrecque & Milne, 2012). Hence, while being associated with similar negative emotions perceptually and linguistically, black was even more negative in the linguistic context.\n\nBased on different theoretical frameworks, we expected that certain colour–emotion associations might be more prevalent in frequency and intensity when conveyed linguistically (i.e., blue and sadness, yellow and negative emotions), while others might be more prevalent in frequency and intensity when conveyed perceptually (i.e., yellow and joy, blue and positive emotions). Our data demonstrated that yellow was associated with joy (see also Jonauskaite, Althaus, et al., 2019; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016), which is likely explained by its link to sunshine (Jonauskaite, Abdel-Khalek, et al., 2019). Yellow was not associated with any negative emotion, as some colour expressions would have predicted (e.g., yellow-bellied or rire jaune [yellow laughter]). Our data also showed that blue was associated with positive emotions (see also Adams & Osgood, 1973; Kaya & Epps, 2004; Manav, 2007; Valdez & Mehrabian, 1994; Wexner, 1954), potentially related to experiences of a clear sky or clean water (Palmer & Schloss, 2010). Blue was not in general associated with any negative emotion. The only negative association with blue was sadness, endorsed by 27% of our participants (see also Barchard, Grob, & Roe, 2017; Palmer et al., 2013; Sutton & Altarriba, 2016). This association can be related to colour expressions like feeling blue in English and avoirs des bleus à l’âme (the soul being bruised, meaning feeling sad, and melancholic) in French. Hence, these examples suggest that—relatively speaking—conceptual colour–emotion associations might have been more strongly reinforced by the perceptual rather than the linguistic systems. A more systematic investigation with a greater number of colours and emotions and a greater number of colour metaphors would be useful to examine this conjecture further.\n\nHigh emotion similarity between colour terms and colour patches cannot provide equivocal support to the theories favouring the role of language (e.g., conceptual metaphor theory; Lakoff & Johnson, 1999) or perception (e.g., Ecological Valence Theory; Palmer & Schloss, 2010). Of course, these theories have not focussed on colour–emotion associations but instead propose generic association mechanisms. More specific to colour, Wang et al. (2014) proposed a distinction between natural and social colour–emotion associations. Natural associations are believed to be reinforced by perceptual pairings and social associations through linguistic and cultural pairings. They suggested that the association between red and negative emotions is natural and apparent when red is a patch, while an association between red and positive emotions is social and apparent when red is a term. We did not replicate the same distinction in the Swiss French-speaking population neither for red nor for any other colour. The valence of all 12 studied colours did not differ between terms and patches. It is unclear to what extent cultural or methodological differences could account for the discrepancy. For instance, in a related study linking 12 colour terms with 20 emotion concepts (Jonauskaite, Wicker, et al., 2019), Chinese participants chose a large number of positive emotions (especially, love and joy) for the term red but also associated red with anger. Hence, colour–emotion associations might be reinforced by perceptual, linguistic, and cultural systems, and the weight of these factors might vary by culture.\n\nOur results might inform theories of embodied cognition (e.g., Barsalou, 1999), providing evidence for an overlapping representation of linguistic and perceptual stimuli. For instance, the classic Stroop effect (Stroop, 1935) demonstrates how naming the ink of letters is hampered when the letters spell an inconsistent colour term. Similarly, auditory presentation of task-unrelated colour terms has been shown to interfere with discrimination performance for colour patches (Richter & Zwaan, 2009). Linguistic reference to red, by including the word red in the description of a person, increased their perceived attractiveness (Pazda & Elliot, 2017). Similarly, linguistic reference to red, when this word appeared on the exam sheet, hampered students’ intellectual performance (Lichtenfeld, Maier, Elliot, & Pekrun, 2009). Equivalent effects on attractiveness and intellectual performance have been reported for perceptual experiences of red (Lehmann, Elliot, & Calin-Jageman, 2018; M. A. Maier, Elliot, & Lichtenfeld, 2008; Mehta & Zhu, 2009). A recent psychophysiological study showed that the words darkness and brightness triggered comparable pupillary responses to perceptual stimuli (Mathôt, Grainger, & Strijkers, 2017). Imaging studies have also demonstrated shared neural networks of colour perception and colour knowledge in the left fusiform gyrus (Simmons et al., 2007; Slotnick, 2009) and the left lingual gyrus (Hsu, Frankland, & Thompson-Schill, 2012). On the other hand, the existence of distinct neurological conditions such as colour anomia (i.e., inability to name visually presented colours; Davidoff & Ostergaard, 1984), colour agnosia (i.e., inability to recognise colours; Davidoff, 1996), and cerebral achromatopsia (i.e., complete colour blindness after cortical damage; Zeki, 1990) provide evidence for (at least partly) separated neural networks. Hence, it appears that colour perception and colour semantics engage to some degree overlapping neural networks.\n\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that conceptual associations between emotions and colours were very similar when a colour was presented perceptually (i.e., patch of a focal colour) and linguistically (i.e., a basic colour term). Hence, studies associating emotions with colour terms or patches can be compared and their results integrated (with some caution taken for purple and black). Future studies can choose to study colour terms or colour patches based on their experimental design and not under the assumption that one method would give more accurate results than the other. Our results would indicate that emotion concepts are associated with a colour concept—an abstract representation of colour—rather than specific perceptual or linguistic properties of colour. This suggestion is true at least when perceived colours relate to focal colours. Future studies may investigate emotion associations with colour patches that are difficult to name (e.g., that border between two neighbouring colour terms; Parraga & Akbarinia, 2016) and with colour patches that vary in lightness and saturation but are named by the same basic term. Our results could also be replicated in a within-subject design to ensure that similarity between colour terms and patches holds within groups. Note that our study cannot determine whether language or perception drives colour–emotion relationships in the first place: We do not know whether colour patches were named or colour terms imagined or both. To disentangle the origins of colour–emotion associations, it would be necessary to move towards less typical populations. For instance, studies in populations that possess different numbers of colour categories would be informative (see M. Maier & Abdel Rahman, 2018). Here, we demonstrated that, once acquired, conceptual colour–emotion associations depend little on how colour is presented."
