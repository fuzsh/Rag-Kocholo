        "text": "The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite was originally released in 2020, but it was revamped in 2022, and now again for a third timeâ€”this year, with a better processor. Right now, you can get that newer 2024 model with 64GB of storage for $209.98 (originally $329.99) after a 36% discount. The 128GB model is also discounted, currently $272.99 (originally $399.99) after a 32% discount.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is a solid entry-level tablet for drawing, taking notes, and light gaming. What makes this one special is that it comes with the S Pen stylus included. It is light, hence the name, but not by much compared to the iPad, at 1.025 pounds. (The 10th-generation iPad is 1.05 pounds, for comparison.) It measures 9.63 by 6.07 by .28 inches and has a 10.4-inch screen with a 2,000 x 1,200 resolution. The processor is a step up from the 2022 Qualcomm Snapdragon 720G, now with Samsung's own Exynos 1280. This S6 comes with the latest Android 14 operating system, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage (expandable up to 1TB). As far as battery life, the 7,040 mAh battery should last anywhere between five to 15 hours depending on your use.\n\nThe 8 MP rear camera and 5MP front camera won't blow you away, but they're fine for daytime snapshots and video calls. If you're still holding on to your wired headphones, you will be happy to know it has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. It has no physical home button, but it does have volume control keys, a power button, a micro SD card slot, and a USB-C 2.0 port (you can't extend your display to a monitor with this port).\n\nFor the price, this is a great budget Android tablet. It's not worth upgrading if you have the 2022 version (unless you want the assurance of more years of Samsung support). But if you have an older tablet or are looking for your first one, the S6 Lite is a great choice."
