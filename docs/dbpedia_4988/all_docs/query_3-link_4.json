        "text": "Before we start to analyze the different color meanings in graphic design let’s talk about color psychology first, and how it affects consumer decisions, as mentioned in the introduction color psychology studies how different colors influence human behavior and what feelings they produce on them.\n\nEvery brand is different and that is why they need to choose a specific color scheme that better describes their brand message, that is why there is no mathematical formula to choosing a color for your logo design, instead, you need to understand what are the core values of your business and what feelings you want to transmit through your brand identity system.\n\nColor choice by the biggest brands\n\nBlue: 33%\n\nRed: 29%\n\nBlack, Grey and Silver: 28%\n\nYellow or Gold: 13%\n\nRed color is considered to represent feelings of romance and it’s universally used to show excitement passion and anger. You can use red in logo design if you want to transmit feelings of power, energy, passion, love and seduction through your brand, and if your business is loud, playful, youthful and modern red color is a good option for your logo as it makes you stand out from the crowd.\n\nRed is a great brand color because it’s easy to use to catch the viewer attention as unconsciousness red is the first color we see when we are babies besides black and white and we have the ability to see this color better than others to make us easier to identify fruits on the trees at the same time that when humans are emotional their faces turn red.\n\nThese factors make red a strong primary color for your logo design as it’s easy to identify and many restaurants and food brands use it to stimulate the appetite of their customers, you also can see using red color for marketing campaigns to stimulate feelings of urgency.\n\nYou can use red alone for your logo design or you can pair it with white, black or other neutral colors to create your brand color scheme. Some popular brand that uses red for their logo design are Coca Cola, Netflix and YouTube.\n\nIf your brand stands out for playful and innovative traits then you might think about using orange for your logo design, as this color evokes feelings of cheerful, friendly and enthusiastic. Orange is also a good option for your brand color if you want to stand out from the crowd as it is a very energetic color and can attract the viewer attention.\n\nBut be careful about what tone of orange you use for your brand logo as a very bright tone of orange can be a little harsh for the eye that is why many brands prefer to use peachier tones for their brand logo to avoid that negative effect on the eye and preserve the eye-catching effect of orange.\n\nOrange is a warm color in the middle of red and yellow and it is usually associated with change and for that reason, many brands that want to be associated with feelings of freshness, excitement and friendly companies choose orange for their logo design.\n\nIf you choose orange as your main logo design color you can combine it with a nice neutral color to balance the contrast, and it’s perfect for entertainment, food and beverages and energetic brands as you can see orange logo examples in brands like Soundcloud, Fanta or Firefox.\n\nYellow is a warm color really bright that usually is used by brands who want to transmit to their audience feelings of friendliness, cheerfulness and happiness through their brand colors.
