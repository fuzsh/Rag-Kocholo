        "text": "Mars Snacking\n\nInspire Moments of Everyday Happiness\n\nWhen you make brands that inspire moments of everyday happiness, you feel a sense of pride in your work.\n\nToday, our iconic products like M&M’S®, SNICKERS®, ORBIT®, EXTRA®, Skittles® and KIND® are enjoyed in more than 180 countries.\n\nWe’re not just committed to our consumers, we’re focused on positively impacting the planet and the population. From chocolate to chewing gum, we have more than 34,000 Associates working hard to improve the way we source, make and market our products, so our consumers can enjoy them even more. Some of our commitments include:\n\nInvesting $1 billion to build a new cocoa supply chain model centered on smallholder farmers.\n\nCreating more sustainable and resilient mint through plant science and investing in communities.\n\nReducing our carbon footprint by using enough renewable energy to create all M&Ms® sold.\n\nFollowing our Nourishing Wellbeing commitment to advance science, innovation and marketing in ways that help billions of people and their pets lead healthier, happier lives.\n\nWith rigorous testing for the safety, taste and quality of our treats, we ensure that the world of tomorrow will have even more smiles, and that we’re still making candy the same way Frank C. Mars did: one piece at a time.\n\nOur Snacking Brands\n\nMars is the world’s leading manufacturer of chocolate, chewing gum, mints and fruity confections.\n\nSelect a brand to learn more\n\n3 MUSKETEERS\n\nThe 3 MUSKETEERS® chocolate bar has been a simple chocolate treat for more than 75 years. It offers a delicate, light and fluffy nougat center, wrapped in delectable chocolate. Now with more satisfying chocolate flavor in the delicious nougat, it’s unmistakably fulfilling.\n\n5 GUM\n\nLaunched in 2007, 5™ gum believes that when you dare to choose the unfamiliar, you feel more alive. There are five seconds before you try something new, take a chance, push past your comfort zone. Your heart races, adrenaline rushes through your body. All of your senses become heightened. It’s terrifying. And exciting. Will you play it safe? Or will you make your comfort zone uncomfortable? The choice is yours. Make it count with 5™ sugar-free chewing gum.\n\nALTOIDS\n\nAltoids® Peppermint tins are a top-selling mint in the U.S. Introduced in 1780, Altoids® were originally marketed to relieve stomach discomfort. By the 1920s, the original cardboard box had been replaced by the more durable distinctive metal tins of today.\n\nAMERICAN HERITAGE\n\nThe AMERICAN HERITAGE® Chocolate brand was developed in 2006 by Mars Chocolate North America (now Mars Wrigley) to help educate consumers about the history of our multicultural nation through the engaging story of one of our most beloved foods…chocolate! With a flavor profile drawn directly from the archives of chocolate's historic past, AMERICAN HERITAGE Chocolate provides an artisanal, versatile way to eat, bake or drink a sweet taste of history. Rainforest Alliance Certified™ and made with no preservatives, AMERICAN HERITAGE Chocolate currently comes in four NEW unique formats: Tasting Squares, Tablet Bars, Grated Chocolate for baking/drinking, and Gourmet Hot Cocoa. AMERICAN HERITAGE Chocolate is sold in over 150 fine gift shops at historic sites, museums and historic inns across the U.S. and Canada. The brand can also be found on Amazon.com, at M&M's World in New York City and Las Vegas, and at the Ethel M chocolate store in Henderson, Nevada.\n\nBALISTO\n\nBALISTO® bar is an irresistible combination of wholemeal biscuits and tasty fruit covered in delicious chocolate. Since 2011, BALISTO® is certified with sustainable cocoa from UTZ CERTIFED.\n\nBIG RED\n\nThe bold cinnamon flavor of Wrigley's Big Red® provides long-lasting fresh breath. In fact, Big Red® has been the No. 1 selling cinnamon gum since 1987. Recently, the flavor was improved to provide even more long-lasting taste, and a new 15-stick Slim Pack™ was introduced.\n\nBOUNTY\n\nAvailable in whole milk and dark chocolate varieties, the moist, tender coconut in chocolate coating tempts your senses with the Taste of Paradise™.\n\nCELEBRATIONS\n\nLaunched in 1997, CELEBRATIONS chocolate was first to bring together a selection of well-loved brands in miniature. With the mix of everyone's favorites, CELEBRATIONS chocolate is a guaranteed crowd-pleaser for any occasion.\n\nCOMBOS\n\nCOMBOS® baked snacks are bite-size crackers, pretzels or tortillas jam-packed with cheese-filled deliciousness. COMBOS® snacks were developed from a patent purchased in the late 1970s. A dedicated group of R&D, Engineering and Manufacturing Associates helped make it the snack we now know and love.\n\nDOUBLEMINT\n\nDoublemint® was launched in the U.S. in 1914 and has since become one of the world's best-selling chewing gums, enjoyed by generations of consumers worldwide. Today, the classic Doublemint flavor lasts longer than ever. Doublemint® is one of the largest-selling gum brands in the world, available in more than 140 countries.\n\nDOVE\n\nSmooth and creamy DOVE® chocolate is your perfect partner in chocolate indulgence. The DOVE® brand — which includes DOVE® chocolate bars to DOVE® PROMISES® chocolate candies — stands for empowerment, commitment, and inspires women to commit to pleasure.\n\nECLIPSE\n\nEclipse® sugar-free gum and mints provide incredible fresh-breath solutions for people whose on-the-go lifestyle demands a breath freshener that delivers.\n\nETHEL M\n\nIn 1981, after passing the leadership of Mars to his children, Forrest Mars, Sr. retired to Henderson, Nevada and created Ethel M® chocolates as a tribute to his mother, her recipes and her chocolate. The Mars family upholds the legacy of Frank and Ethel with these high-quality chocolates.\n\nGALAXY\n\nSmooth and creamy GALAXY® chocolate is your perfect partner in chocolate indulgence. Since its launch in 1960, the GALAXY® brand — which includes, among others, GALAXY Smooth Milk, MINSTRELS™ and RIPPLE™ — stands for empowerment, commitment, and inspires women to commit to pleasure.\n\nHOTEL CHOCOLAT\n\nWe strive to always be one surprising, entertaining step ahead. More playful and more ethical. More cocoa, less sweet.\n\nHUBBA BUBBA\n\nHubba Bubba® offers great-tasting bubble gum in outrageous flavors and exciting product forms.\n\nJUICY FRUIT\n\nThe first brand launched by Wrigley, Juicy Fruit® gum has been delivering sweetness for over 100 years. Juicy Fruit® believes that life is better when you have a little fun.\n\nKIND\n\nWe believe if you can't pronounce an ingredient, it shouldn’t go into your body. Actually, it shouldn’t even go into your pantry. KIND® products are made from nutritionally-dense ingredients like whole nuts, fruits and whole grains - no secret ingredients and no artificial flavors, preservatives or sweeteners.\n\nLIFE SAVERS\n\nSince their introduction in 1912, Life Savers® has become an iconic brand across fruity confections and mints due to their great-tasting flavors and unique candy-with-the-hole shape. More than 40 flavors of Life Savers® have been created since the original Pep-O-Mint® was launched.\n\nM&M’S\n\nM&M'S® chocolate candies have been a famous candy treat since 1941. The snack-sized pieces of chocolate in a colorful candy shell are instantly recognizable all over the globe. M&M'S® chocolate candies are available in flavors, such as Milk Chocolate, Peanut, Dark Chocolate, Almond and Peanut Butter.\n\nMALTESERS\n\nMaltesers® — the lighter way to enjoy chocolate.
