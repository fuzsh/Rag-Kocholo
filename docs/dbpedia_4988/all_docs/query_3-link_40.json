        "text": "\"Kind of absurd\": This is how Josh Chin, a journalist at The Wall Street Journal, described the police response to protests that took place in China in late 2022, because there were \"images of police sort of snatching blank pieces of paper out of people's hands\" (1). Due to state censorship, Chinese citizens decided to express their indignation over the strict COVID-19 lockdown rules and other oppressive policies in an unusual way — by omitting words. In the Vox podcast \"Today, Explained\", which featured Chin as a guest, this gesture was described as \"the most powerful symbol… A symbol that says literally nothing — and everything at the same time\" (1).\n\nPaul Watzlawick, the prominent therapist and communication theorist, once said: \"One cannot not communicate\" (2). Words convey a message through their meaning but also through the way they are presented, such as their order in a sentence or the use of a certain word instead of a similar one. Even saying nothing at all conveys meaning. But how much can one's use of language, including word choice, influence others?\n\nThe relationship between language and thought has been researched for a long time. In the 1950s, a broad research program advanced the hypothesis that language influences how people think, an idea known as linguistic relativity. Some years later, another group of researchers (also backed by scientific data) claimed that it is not possible to definitively conclude that language shapes our thoughts.\n\nToday, both perspectives are embraced by influential thinkers such as the cognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky and the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker (to learn more about this controversy, read 5). Even though there is no absolute answer, it is acknowledged that, at least in some ways, language influences thinking.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that language is often instrumentalised politically, for example through what is known as \"framing\". This refers to a framework of associations and interpretations that accompany terms. Frames often describe a situation or a problem, but they also implicitly provide a possible reaction to it.\n\nThe German word \"Flüchtlingswelle\" (\"wave of refugees\") is one example. From 2015 onwards, it was often used to describe the refugee movements that largely emerged as a result of the escalating civil war in Syria. The term was used by various parties and media that certainly did not always have ulterior motives. However, this does not change the effect of such a term, which presumably causes many media consumers to visualise masses of people rushing in like a wave, again and again — in other words, a force of nature to which one is powerlessly exposed and finds threatening. What is to be done in the face of such a \"wave\"? For some, the association is obvious: build dams and protective walls.\n\nIt is important for journalists to be aware of the effect of words like this and think carefully about whether there are better terms. In this case, one option would be \"refugee movements\".\n\nWords and emotions seem to be interconnected in the brain. Every time we have an emotional experience, the neural regions that process the semantics of words also get involved (6).\n\nFor example, when people give words to negative emotions, they regulate their emotional state and calm themselves down. This is detectable in our brains: Reactivity in the amygdala, which plays a key role in processing emotional stimuli and reactions, decreases when someone labels negative emotional images (7). Even though scientists are not certain yet about why labelling emotions has a comforting effect, one possibility is that it reduces uncertainty (8).\n\nOne note on words and our inner world: Next time you write a news piece about mental health, \"be specific\", the American Psychiatric Association suggests; it's preferable to say, \"He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder\" than \"He was mentally ill\" (11). When you use accurate words, you're helping people feel represented in your story and identifying the help they need. (Important note: This should not be confused with reducing people's identities to stigmatising labels. For example, it is better to talk about someone \"having bipolar disorder\" than saying they \"are bipolar\".)\n\nAssigning different grammatical genders to an object changes how we perceive it.\n\nIn German, \"bridge\" is a feminine word; in Spanish, it's masculine. When asked to qualify the word, German-speaking people used adjectives such as \"elegant\", \"fragile\" and \"pretty\", whereas Spanish-speaking people chose descriptors like \"big\", \"strong\" and \"sturdy\" — even though the study was conducted in the English language, in which \"bridge\" has no grammatical gender (13). As Boroditsky notes in her text on linguistic relativity, \"It appears that even a small fluke of grammar (the seemingly arbitrary assignment of a noun to be masculine or feminine) can have an effect on how people think about things in the world\" (13).\n\nChanging one word in a news article can inspire different solutions.\n\nImagine this situation: There's a city with increasing crime rates, and decision-makers need to respond to the problem. A journalist is reporting on the topic and debating whether to use the word \"beast\" or \"virus\" as a metaphor for crime in their article. Can the word choice affect how the audience evaluates possible responses?\n\nThe answer seems to be yes. Changing that single word led to differences in the type of solution participants identified as more adequate to the situation (18). Readers supported more police enforcement when crime was described as a \"beast\" (71%) compared to when it was labelled a \"virus\" (54%). In contrast, they were more likely to propose investigating the root causes of the issue and instituting social reforms when the article used the word \"virus\" (18).\n\nAvoid using set phrases, clichés and commonplaces. They become useless because people don't assign meaning to them anymore.\n\nLook at these examples: \"They face an uphill battle\", \"She is one in a million\", \"He was stabbed in the back\", \"This is a piece of cake for me\". How would you say the same thing using your own words? Try it. You'll reach your audience more effectively.\n\nAs the aspects presented in this article have shown, language is a very powerful tool for journalists. The examples illustrate how journalists' words can affect their audiences' thoughts, emotions and attitudes. But there is another significant element that has a large impact and can sometimes be used to great effect in journalism: silence. Being quiet and listening to the people – the effects of this can also help improve journalism."
