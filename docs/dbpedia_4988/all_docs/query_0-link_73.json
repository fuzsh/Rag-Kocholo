        "text": "According to the leaked manual, the phone will come with a 5.1-inch screen with a 2560 x 1440 resolution display, a 16-megapixel main camera, and a 5-megapixel front camera. All of these components are the same as those of the standard Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge.\n\nThe internal specifications of the phone seem to be the same as those of the regular S6 — the biggest difference comes in terms of design. The phone doesn't have a fingerprint scanner as its more delicate counterpart does, and it has physical menu buttons instead of capacitive touch buttons.\n\nThe S6 Active still has a heart-rate monitor and is just as light as the regular Galaxy S6. But, as the photo shows, the phone appears to have a sturdier bumper and is most likely made of a different material, since the standard Galaxy S6 has a glass-coated back. It's not as attractive as the Galaxy S6, but it's not meant to be — Samsung's line of Galaxy Active phones are usually aimed at those looking for a phone that can withstand a few drops and getting a little wet.\n\nThere's no word yet on when the Galaxy S6 Active will launch, how much it will cost, or which carriers it will be available through. But considering this has been one of several leaks, it will probably be announced soon.\n\nThe Galaxy S6, with its metal-and-glass design, is the most premium phone Samsung has released yet, which means it's also probably more susceptible to damage. In the past, Samsung's phones such as the Galaxy S5 have come with removable backs, making it easy to replace the rear panel in case of damage or swap out the battery. Samsung opted to ditch that feature for its Galaxy S6 lineup in favor of a unibody design, however, so it looks as if the Galaxy S6 Active is designed to provide a more durable alternative."
