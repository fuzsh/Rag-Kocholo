        "text": "Some consumers think of white as a clean, modern, safe color. However, it may be too cold and sterile for your brand, depending on your business.\n\nIn this post, you’ll learn about personalities we often associate with the color white. You can also see when white is effective in branding — and when it can go wrong. Finally, we’ve included links to brands that use the color in their logos and designs.\n\nPersonality & Emotions\n\nWhite often symbolizes cleanliness, purity, and safety in Western culture. (For example, American brides typically wear white to represent innocence before starting their marriage.) The color can also represent neutrality or space. In fact, white creates “breathing room” between two or more elements. In recent years, we’ve even seen tech, artistic, and fashion brands keeping their design clean and simple with white logos.\n\nWhen to Use White\n\nIf you have a modern, exciting business such as a startup or tech company, this is a great color for your branding. Using white in your visuals can also spark creativity by acting as a clean slate. Art studio owners might like to think of white branding as a blank canvas! If you’re a store owner who wants to create contrast in aisles and shelves, white will serve you well, too.\n\nWhen to Avoid White\n\nIf your brand has a big personality, using white as your main brand color may force you to restrain design. That’s not to say you should avoid white altogether; just use it sparingly. Keep in mind, too, that white can evoke cold, emptiness, or sterility. If you’re aiming for an energetic or upbeat brand, you may want to avoid white and try incorporating warmer colors instead.\n\nStrategic Brand Examples\n\nApple\n\nHGTV\n\nSony\n\nZara\n\nOur proven marketing protocol helps companies make more money, free up time, and plan an effective strategy."
