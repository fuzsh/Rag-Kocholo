        "text": "10 minutes read\n\nEveryone knows that emotional marketing is difficult to do right. Marketers tend to focus on conversion rates, impressions, bounce rates, and bids, and we forget about the emotional appeal in advertising.\n\nAccording to the research from PsychologyToday, people respond to the emotional part of the ads a lot more than the text itself.\n\nOn the other hand, ads that convey strong emotions often go viral and produce awesome results. The study from HubSpot revealed that the most-shared ads relied on emotional content, including happiness, friendship, and inspiration.\n\nIn particular, Mariano Rodriguez from LawRank pointed out that “If you want to make people share and buy, improve your PPC campaign through the use of emotional advertising. This is an effective way to drive your campaign goals”.\n\nEmotions are one of the main reasons why people prefer using products of a certain brand. To encourage people to buy from you, use the following emotional trigger examples in your advertising:\n\nTable of Contents\n\nInstant Gratification\n\nHappiness\n\nFear\n\nTrust\n\nSadness\n\nAnger\n\nBelonging\n\nGuilt\n\nValues\n\nLeadership\n\nPride\n\nHow do you create emotionally charged ads?\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nBenefits of emotional advertising\n\nBottom Line\n\n1. Instant Gratification\n\nPeople often expect instant gratification in many aspects of their lives, even if they are negative. The sense of urgency in your message always makes people get this right now. It is important to include words like today, now, within 24 hours, instant access, etc. These are important aspects of emotional advertising.\n\nDon’t make your audience wait – just give what they want. You can give a discount or run a giveaway. Just give them a chance to win.\n\nHere is a good example of this practice from Lavent Law who persuades people to call them to get their money if they are injured in an accident:\n\n2. Happiness\n\nMany brands want their customer to associate their brand names with smiling, laughing, and positivism. Based on this study, the New York Times’ most-shared articles were positive and had emotional appeal. When creating emotional ads, keep in mind that positive advertising can help you get more engagement and increase sharing.\n\nFor example, Coca-Cola’s “Choose Happiness” promotion in 2015 was a powerful example that encouraged consumers to share happy memories and experiences that make them feel happy that summer.\n\n3. Fear\n\nFear is a good marketing tool to make people loyal to a brand, a product, or a service. Fear makes people investigate some areas carefully, and showcase warns of dangers that we can lose something if we don’t take measures. Fear helps us grow and prevent people from bad behaviors like alcohol, drug abuse, and smoking.\n\nFor example, the World Wildlife Fund uses fear in advertising to increase awareness about the harmful effects of global warming. The image clearly shows that climate change will change you and your descendants if you don’t take action to keep it.\n\n4. Trust\n\nNowadays, trust is one of the most effective triggers in emotional advertising, and many brands try to jump on the trust board in their ads. Before customers trust and buy from you repeatedly, you should persuade them to trust you by using emotional appeal advertising.\n\nTry to be open and transparent with your customers. Everything should be visible in public view.\n\nShow testimonials on your landing page and links to your reviews on third-party sites like Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.\n\nReduce consumer risk. You can offer a 100% money-back guarantee, free trial, 100% satisfaction guarantee, etc.\n\nStay human. Show real human faces and links to their social profiles on your website to prove that they are members of your team.\n\nShow authoritative brands you used to work with and the awards you have won.\n\nBe specific. Display numbers, figures, stats, and facts about your brand.\n\nTake a look at The Law Offices of John Rapillo as an example. They promote trust in their clients.\n\n5. Sadness\n\nUsing negative emotions like sadness helps you deliver a sense of empathy or compassion. Many brands have noticed the effectiveness of using emotional content that creates public awareness of social issues like violence, gender equality, poverty reduction, immigration, and others.\n\nIt is essential to keep the balance when creating such kind of ads. You don’t need to upset your audience and evoke negative feelings made by your brand. Conversely, these emotions should motivate people to act and donate money to improve the situation.\n\nFor example, Children of the World promoted the Help Me Read This campaign to improve child literacy in New Delhi.\n\nRelated articles:\n\n20 Powerful Advertising Appeals You Can Use in Your Campaigns\n\nCreative Advertising Meets Pop Culture: Creative Ads That Pop\n\n15 Compelling Advertising Techniques That Work\n\n6. Anger\n\nUsing anger in emotional advertising makes people upset or annoyed about things like politics, environmental issues, political candidates, etc. Anger evokes a negative emotion that can cause negative associations.\n\nBrands that use this emotion want to stimulate people to solve important questions and reconsider their perspective. They want to show people the overall situation and show positivity to change it for the better.\n\nFor example, the Always’ Like a Girl campaign uses a famous offense to catch more attention and encourage women to share their stories and the difficulties they face and play sports.\n\n7. Belonging\n\nEvery person wants to belong to a group, a community, a family or a social network. The feeling of belonging helps customers satisfy their key psychological needs. Many companies use this emotion to make customers feel part of a particular group.\n\nEspecially, it is widely used in sport. It is a great place to show the feeling of belonging in action. The Rapha Cycle Club (RCC), a membership organization, is a great emotional appeal example. They offer people to ride with RCC members each week in your city and travel the world for RCC hangouts and meetings.\n\n8. Guilt\n\nMartin Lindstrom noticed in this article that guilt is the most puritanical among all our emotions that became an emotional consumer pandemic in the 21st century. People are easily influenced by messages that make them feel guilty. Many nonprofit organizations use this trigger in their advertising campaigns. They can be very effective and don’t have a negative thing. The Sears Craftsman is a good example. The message of guilt positions the brand as the solution to current consumers’ issues.\n\n9. Values\n\nValues are one of the hottest trends in marketing. Every day people make purchase decisions based on judgments and values. Many promotions are directly connected with the emotional trigger of making the best deal. It can include time, price, and money.\n\nMake sure that values are very subjective, and many companies do their best to boost the perceived value of their products. Once you understand your target customers’ values, you can create the best compelling and targeted ads.\n\nFor example, Citywide Law Group promotes the message “If you have been injured, you shouldn’t pay until we win” which is effective in arousing the feeling related to value.\n\n10. Leadership\n\nConsumers want to be the first to try new products or services. Brand promotions appeal to the emotional trigger related to leadership and make their target customers feel like they are first for this audience.\n\nDo you remember the famous Nike’s campaign “Just Do it”? It is a great example that demonstrates the emotional trigger of cultural leadership.\n\n11. Pride\n\nThis emotion is intended for all consumers who want to look smart and be proud of making a good choice. They want to be proud of purchasing organic food, a bestselling book, or any money-value purchase. It is difficult to use this emotion because each person has different needs and desires, and you need to do in-depth marketing research to support your offering with solid arguments.\n\nHere is how Amazon Flex proposes to its customers to earn a good wage when delivering parcels with Amazon.\n\nHow do you create emotionally charged ads?\n\nMost PPC specialists use the standard formula while creating ad copy. It includes three points: keywords, CTA, and unique selling points. Fortunately, Google gives more space for creating expanded text ads where you can adopt emotional ad copy and build meaningful connections with potential clients.\n\nHere are some tips on how to make emotional ads:\n\nCheck what your competitors are running – especially if you spotted them using emotional marketing. You can take over their ideas and make them even better. To spy on your rivals, use SE Ranking Competitor SEO/PPC Research tool.\n\nMake a list of the benefits your product provides. You can create a customer survey to see what they truly believe the benefits are. You can use the JotForm Survey Maker or Survey Anyplace to get the exact results.\n\nConnect emotional benefits with an image. The image should reflect the emotional values of your statement. Use our platform to make a banner simple and easy.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is an emotional advertisement?\n\nEmotional advertising is a marketing technique that aims to create a solid emotional connection between the audience and the advertised product, brand, or message.
