        "meta_description": "Interpersonal emotion regulation is the dynamic process where the regulator aims to change the target's emotional state, which is presumed to engage three neural systems: cognitive control (i.e., dorsal and ventral lateral PFC, etc.), empathy/social cognition (i.e., dorsal premotor regions, temporal-parietal junction, etc.), and affective response (i.e., insula, amygdala, etc.). This study aimed to identify the underlying neural correlate (especially the interpersonal one), of interpersonal emotion regulation based on two typical strategies (cognitive appraisal, expressive suppression). Thirty-four female dyads (friends) were randomly assigned into two strategy groups, with one assigned as the target and the other as the regulator to downregulate the target's negative emotions using two strategies. A functional near-infrared spectroscopy system was used to simultaneously measure participants' neural activity. Results showed that these two strategies could successfully downregulate the targets' negative emotions. Both strategies evoked intrapersonal and interpersonal neural couplings between the cognitive control, social cognition, and mirror neuron systems (e.g., PFC, temporal-parietal junction, premotor cortex, etc.), whereas cognitive reappraisal (vs expressive suppression) evoked a broader pattern. Further, cognitive reappraisal involved increased interpersonal brain synchronization between the prefrontal and temporal areas at the sharing stage, whereas expressive suppression evoked increased interpersonal brain synchronization associated with the PFC at the regulation stage.

        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhen you try to cheer your friend up, to praise your child for good grades, or to calm down your angry colleague, you are involved in interpersonal emotion regulation (IER). IER is considered as the conscious attempt to affect others' emotions (Niven et al., 2009; Niven, 2017), which leads to either positive (Niven et al., 2012) or negative (Lopez-Perez et al., 2017) interpersonal outcomes.\n\nAlthough emotion regulation research has traditionally focused on intrapersonal processes (Campos et al., 2011), there is now considerable interest in IER processes. IER is an important topic to investigate for many reasons. First, a growing number of studies have shown that IER is associated with several important outcomes, such as psychological well-being and interpersonal relationship satisfaction (Butler and Randall, 2013; Sahi et al., 2021; Springstein et al., 2023). During the COVID-19 pandemic, people often seek out social support from others (e.g., family, friends, or even strangers via helplines) with the goal of regulating their negative emotions or alleviating stress (Tepeli Temiz and Elsharnouby, 2022). Second, IER is important for individuals who have difficulties regulating their own emotions because of different psychopathologies (Akkuş and Peker, 2022; Gunn and Donahue, 2022). Third, some researchers proposed that IER could be more effective than intrapersonal emotion regulation since the regulators might have more objective views of an emotional event than the distressed targets and not be distracted by their emotions during the process of IER (Zaki and Williams, 2013; Horn and Maercker, 2016; Levy-Gigi and Shamay-Tsoory, 2017).\n\nIn the field of intrapersonal emotion regulation, research mainly focused on two typical strategies: cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES) (Goldin et al., 2008; McRae and Gross, 2020; Gutentag et al., 2022). CR involves reinterpreting the meaning of the target event that induces certain emotions, whereas ES involves inhibiting emotion-related responses/motion (e.g., facial expressions) to the emotion-eliciting event (Bebko et al., 2011). For instance, when individuals encounter an upsetting event, CR guides individuals to optimistically treat the event (this can decrease negative affect and physiological responses to negative events), but ES requires individuals to suppress emotional expressions of upset. ES may exert little or no impact on subjective feeling and even boosts negative physiological responses (Gross and Levenson, 1997) or attenuates positive affect (Fernandes and Tone, 2021). CR can decrease negative emotions and lead to more positive feelings, emotional expressions, and well-being (Gross and John, 2003; Boemo et al., 2022). Research also suggested that the CR is generally effective and adaptive relative to ES (Haga et al., 2009; McRae and Gross, 2020). Specifically, the CR strategy more consistently predicted the increase in positive affect and reduction in negative affect relative to the suppression strategy (Boemo et al., 2022). Ineffective utilization or underutilization of CR was associated with social anxiety and depression (Dryman and Heimberg, 2018; Kivity et al., 2021), whereas ES was negatively associated with positive affect (Fernandes and Tone, 2021). However, it remains unknown whether CR is more effective than ES during IER. The interpersonal CR strategy involves assisting the target in reinterpreting the meaning or context of a stimulus or modifying his/her perspective on certain issues. Accordingly, we hypothesized that CR might be more effective than ES during IER. Although interpersonal physiological synchrony was associated with dyadic emotional interaction (Coutinho et al., 2021), it is an open question whether the underlying neural substrates of these two strategies differ during IER. Most neuroscience research on IER adopted the human–computer interaction paradigm and only revealed the intrapersonal neural substrates associated with the regulators or the targets during IER (Grecucci et al., 2013; Hallam et al., 2014; Morawetz et al., 2021). These studies used the traditional single-brain neuroimaging technique and thus could hardly capture the intrapersonal and interpersonal neural underpinnings underlying IER process.\n\nWith the emergence of hyperscanning technique, researchers have proposed that interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) or interpersonal neural coupling may play an important role in facilitating social interactions (Nguyen et al., 2019; Müller et al., 2021; Long et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2023). Specifically, previous hyperscanning research has also observed that IBS was increased at the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) during speed-dating (Yuan et al., 2022), communicating with positive social gestures (Balconi et al., 2021), and group creative idea generation (Lu et al., 2020). Also, an increase in IBS at the temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) was reported during cooperative problem solving (Lu et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021). More importantly, existing studies have applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)-based hyperscanning to explore IBS under various social interactions related to IER (Reindl et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2021; Kelsen et al., 2022). These hyperscanning studies have reported that the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) not only involves in both speech production and semantic comprehension (Silbert et al., 2014), but also serves as a core region of the alignment-execution system or mentalizing system relating to understanding the underlying goals and motives of others' behavior (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2019; Gamliel et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022). A review study has also suggested that the IFG is responsible for emotional empathy, which contributes to IER through automatic empathic reactions (e.g., imitation or emotion contagion) (Franklin-Gillette and Shamay-Tsoory, 2021). These automatic empathic reactions can help reduce the targets' distress (Brown et al., 2021; Jurkiewicz et al., 2023). In addition, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) also serves as a key brain region for speech perception (Bhaya-Grossman and Chang, 2022), the mirror neuron system (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2019), and emotion empathy (Tholen et al., 2020; Yaniv et al., 2021). This multiple-brain research may indicate that the IER process involves brain regions, such as DLPFC, IFG, and STG. Given that the interpersonal CR strategy involves assisting the target in modifying his/her perspective on the current issues, we suggest that this strategy would enhance IBS at regions involving in mentalizing system (e.g., perspective-taking) and alignment system (e.g., emotion contagion or emotion empathy), such as IFG, TPJ, etc.\n\nIn addition, several models have been proposed to clarify the core psychological processes/stages of IER. For example, Dixon-Gordon et al. (2015) came up with the encoding-decoding model of IER, and explained how regulation-seeking behavior and regulation-delivering behavior were performed by the target and the regulator during this dynamic, dyadic process. Recently, Reeck et al. (2016) put forward the interaction model of IER and suggested that three neural systems might be recruited during IER, including the social cognition/empathy system (SC; e.g., dorsal premotor regions and TPJ), cognitive control system (CC; e.g., dorsal and ventral lateral PFC), and emotion generation system (e.g., amygdala and ventral striatum). This model subdivides the process of IER according to the mental process of the IER partners (Fig. 1). Notably, three key processes could be extracted from these IER models: (1) emotion sharing, (2) emotion regulation, and (3) feedback. First, IER begins with the target sharing negative emotions with the regulator. The process of emotion sharing during IER mainly recruits brain regions of the mirror neuron system or mentalizing network, such as IFG, superior temporal sulcus, mPFC, and TPJ (Franklin-Gillette and Shamay-Tsoory, 2021; Schmidt et al., 2021). Second, after evaluating the interpersonal regulation needs of the target, the regulator uses a suitable IER strategy to regulate the target's negative emotions. The executive control network is involved in the process of emotion regulation during IER. This network involves regions, such as the IFG, inferior parietal lobule, DLPFC, superior temporal sulcus, and premotor cortex (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2019). Third, the target would give positive or negative feedbacks depending on the emotional state that he or she is undergoing. If the IER succeeds, the reward system, which includes the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventromedial PFC, would be activated. On the contrary, if the IER fails, the brain regions related to negative emotions would be activated (e.g., amygdala) (Grecucci et al., 2013; Hallam et al., 2014; Reeck et al., 2016).\n\nThis study also attempted to explore how two strategies affect these three IER processes and unveil the underlying neural substrates. Previous studies have suggested that emotional empathy plays an important role in the emotion sharing process, and cognitive empathy mainly operates in the emotion regulating process (Franklin-Gillette and Shamay-Tsoory, 2021). Emotional empathy involves affective sharing: feeling the physical or emotional distress of someone else. Therefore, the mirror neuron system, which involves observing others and understanding other's emotions, might play an important role in the emotion sharing stage during IER (Rizzolatti and Craighero, 2004; Franklin-Gillette and Shamay-Tsoory, 2021). On the other hand, cognitive empathy involves understanding or inferring the thoughts and motivations of others, active perspective-taking (spontaneously take the psychological perspective of others), and theory of mind (having meta-representations of minds of others). Therefore, the mentalizing network system might be a key brain network to the emotion regulation stage during IER. In addition, research on intrapersonal emotion regulation reported that the CR strategy required more mental processes related to changing one's perspective or reinterpretation than the ES strategy. All these could help the target to recognize positive aspects of the current issue and downregulate the target's negative emotions more successfully. Therefore, we speculated that compared with the interpersonal ES strategy, the interpersonal CR strategy would involve higher neural sensitivity to neural circuits of emotion empathy or cognitive empathy and thus led to more intrapersonal functional connectivity (Fc) or IBS related to mirror neuron system, mentalizing system or cognitive control system.\n\nHere, this study aimed to examine how two typical IER strategies (cognitive appraisal [CR]; expressive suppression [ES]) affect IER, and uncover the underlying intrapersonal and interpersonal neural substrates. To do so, we developed a new dual-brain fNIRS paradigm for simultaneously scanning the brains of the target (the one whose negative emotion was induced using a negative emotional task) and the regulator (the one who used strategies to regulate the target's negative emotions) during IER. This new paradigm artificially divided the IER process into three stages so that the neural substrates underlying the effect of strategies on IER processes could be explored. We hypothesized that, compared with the ES strategy, (1) the CR strategy would be more effective in downregulating other's negative emotions; (2) the CR strategy would also enhance Fc related to the mirror neuron system, mentalizing system, or cognitive control system, such as STG, AG, and DLPFC, etc.; and (3) the CR strategy would enhance IBS at regions involving in mentalizing system and alignment system, such as IFG, and TPJ, etc. Finally, we attempted to explore how two strategies affect the neural connections that underlie different IER stages without specific hypothesis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study first explored how two typical IER strategies (CR and ES) affect the dynamic process (emotion sharing, emotion regulation, and feedback) and outcome of IER, and uncover the underlying neural substrates using fNIRS-based hyperscanning. Behavioral results showed that both IER strategies successfully decreased the targets' negative emotions and increased their positive emotions. Also, the targets' self-rated IER effectiveness was significantly higher in the CR group than in the ES group. Regarding the targets, the fNIRS results showed the CR strategy evoked broad higher Fc across regions, including PFC, TPJ, sensory and motor cortex, but lower Fc between the rTPJ and sensory and motor regions than the ES strategy. Regarding the regulators, the CR strategy evoked higher Fc of rIFG-lMotor, but lower Fc of rIFG-lFEF than the ES strategy. As for IBS, the CR strategy evoked higher IBS of lIFGregulator-rSTGtarget, but lower IBS of rV3Regulator-rSMGTarget than the ES strategy. Further analysis on IER stages showed that the CR strategy evoked higher Fc of rDLPFC-rSTG and rPSC-rSMG in the targets, and IBS of rSMGregulator-lDLPFCtarget than the ES strategy at the sharing stage. In contrast, the ES strategy evoked higher Fc of rV3-lMotor in the targets and Fc of lSMG-lMotor in the regulators than the CR strategy at the sharing stage. Moreover, the ES strategy also evoked higher IBS of rFGregulator-lDLPFCtarget and rAGregulator-lFEFtarget than the CR strategy at the regulation stage.\n\nSpecifically, both IER strategies successfully and comparably downregulated the emotional valence and arousal of the targets' negative emotion. These findings suggested that both CR and ES were effective in IER, which extended the previous finding that CR is more effective in intrapersonal emotion regulation than the ES (Boemo et al., 2022). Regarding CR, we suggest that it engages reinterpreting the meaning or context of the emotion-eliciting event, and thus helps get rid of negative emotions because of previous view on the event. Regarding ES, it seems that merely suppressing others' emotional expressions can improve their negative emotional state. Another interpretation could be that a sense of social support, along with the interpersonal ES strategy, may contribute to decreasing individual negative emotions. This also parallels recent studies on developing the IER questionnaire (Hofmann et al., 2016; Akkuş and Peker, 2022). They found that ES-related items, such as “When I am annoyed, others can soothe me by telling me not to worry” and “Having people telling me not to worry can calm me down when I am anxious,” could successfully decrease one's negative feelings.\n\nIntriguingly, the targets subjectively considered the CR strategy more effective in downregulating their negative emotions than the ES strategy. Such a difference in subjective feeling might result from the fact that CR can help the targets optimistically treat the emotion-eliciting event and contribute to positive feelings, emotional expressions, and well-being compared with ES (Gross and John, 2003). However, the regulators' ratings on IER effectiveness did not differ between two strategies, but the increase in emotional arousal was stronger in the CR group than in the ES group. Further analysis showed the regulators' amusement increased but fear decreased in the CR group compared with the ES group. These findings also indicate that using different strategies to downregulate others' negative emotions also lead to changes in the regulator's emotional state. CR involves directing the target to reinterpret the meaning of the emotion-eliciting event and get rid of negative emotion resulting from previous view of the event. However, the regulators merely instructed the targets to bear negative feelings and keep calm when using the ES strategy. In comparison, the regulator might experience a stronger sense of achievement, which had led to an increase in their amusement in the CR scenario.\n\nThe FC analysis on the whole IER course showed that the CR strategy evoked broad Fc across regions, including PFC, TPJ, STG, and sensory and motor cortex in the targets compared with the ES strategy. These results were consistent with previous findings that the CR strategy recruited brain systems related to cognitive control and linguistic elaboration during intrapersonal emotion regulation (Buhle et al., 2014; Sokołowski et al., 2022). This finding further demonstrated a relationship between the IER process based on CR and social cognition system (e.g., TPJ, STG). This could be explained by the fact that the target needed to comprehend the views of the regulator during CR-based IER process (Naor et al., 2020; Tholen et al., 2020). Moreover, in the case of CR, the target engaged in a series of more complex mental process, such as detecting the viewpoint gap between the target and regulator, imitating mental actions (e.g., change viewpoint) related to regulating negative emotions during the IER process (Franklin-Gillette and Shamay-Tsoory, 2021). In addition, this finding was also in line with the model of IER linking social cognition system with the IER process (Zaki and Williams, 2013; Reeck et al., 2016), and provided neuroscientific evidence that the CR-based IER process engages broad neural connections associated with the cognitive control system and social cognition system in the targets. In contrast, the ES strategy triggered stronger Fc of rSTGTarget-lMotorTarget, rV3Target-lPACTarget, and rSMGTarget-lAGTarget than the CR strategy. Sikka et al. (2022) reviewed the neuroimaging studies on the neural bases of ES and also found that the temporo-occipital areas related to visual processing were recruited during ES. Given that the target paid more attention to response inhibition rather than emotion eliciting stimuli, neural responses in these areas would be expected. Furthermore, previous research showed that the DLPFC, premotor, and supplementary motor cortex were engaged in emotional regulation based on CR or ES (Steward et al., 2021; Sikka et al., 2022). Both reappraisal and suppression strategies activated the DLPFC (Berboth and Morawetz, 2021; Gao et al., 2021). The current findings further emphasized the important roles of these regions in both intrapersonal and IER (Gao et al., 2021; Sikka et al., 2022), and provided neuroimaging evidence for the interaction model of IER (Reeck et al., 2016).\n\nThe IBS analysis on the whole IER course showed a significant increase in IBS of lIFGRegulator-rSTGTarget in the CR group compared with the ES group. Increases in IBS were often observed during various social interaction processes (Pan et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2023), indicating a state of information processing or exchange. During CR-based IER, the regulator needs to engage in multiple mental processes, including emotion recognition, language production, and mentalizing or empathizing; the target is required to comprehend the regulator's perspective and reinterpret the emotion-eliciting issue as the regulator suggested. The IFG is related to language production (Silbert et al., 2014), emotion recognition (Arioli et al., 2021), and mentalizing (Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2019; Weng et al., 2022); and rSTG is involved in speech comprehension (Bhaya-Grossman and Chang, 2022) and communication (Stephens et al., 2010). All of these may explain the increase in IBS of lIFGRegulator-rSTGTarget in the CR group. However, the ES strategy evoked higher IBS of rV3Regulator-rSMGTarget than the CR strategy. During ES-based IER, the regulator needs to supervise the target's facial expression or behavioral response to confirm that the target suppressed emotional expressions as suggested; the target needs to monitor her emotional expressions. The possible relationship between the rSMG and ongoing monitoring of one's facial expression (Dörfel et al., 2014), and the role of visual areas in visual information processing, may offer an explanation for the increased IBS of rV3Regulator-rSMGTarget in the ES group.\n\nThe current paradigm artificially divided the IER process into three stages (sharing, regulation, and feedback) and thus allowed uncovering the neural correlates underpinning the effect of two strategies on the IER process. CR is an antecedent-focused strategy, whereas ES is a response-focused strategy (Gross, 1998). CR requires the regulator to recognize what the target is experiencing and feeling at the sharing state, so as to generate appropriate ideas to help the target reinterpret the emotion-eliciting issue. This may engage an increase in IBS of rSMGregulator-lDLPFCtarget at the sharing stage of IER, which could be further supported by previous research: the rSMG is recruited in judging others' internal states and processing others' thoughts (Silani et al., 2013; Steinbeis, 2016; Bukowski et al., 2020). The DLPFC is strongly implicated in advanced cognitive functions, such as executive control (Huang et al., 2022) and verbal working memory (Koshy et al., 2020). We also observed higher Fc of rDLPFCTarget-rSTGTarget and rPSCTarget-rSMGTarget, but lower lSMGregulator-lMotorregulator in the CR group than in the ES group at the sharing stage. These results may reveal that the influence of CR and ES strategies on the IER process began early in the emotion sharing stage. These two strategies affected the mutual interaction between the regulator and target when the target was sharing emotional feelings. For instance, CR requires the regulator to recognize and empathize with the target's shared negative emotions (antecedent-focused), which may contribute to the target's feeling of being cared about. Meanwhile, the target was observing the reaction of the regulator (e.g., facial expressions), identifying whether the regulator was sincerely caring about her feeling, and eventually determining whether to open heart and continue sharing emotions to the regulator. Interestingly, the PSC, a part of the mirror neuron system, involves processing incoming sensory information, such as recognizing facial expression (Volynets et al., 2020). All these could help explain the increased Fc between the cognitive control system, social cognition system, and mirror neuron system (Fc of rDLPFCTarget-rSTGTarget and rPSCTarget-rSMGTarget). In contrast, ES put more emphasis on practicing suppression instructions, and thus does not heavily rely on interpersonal empathy or mentalizing. In this case, the regulator may focus on the internal practice of suppression strategies, which may enhance the Fc of lSMGregulator-lMotorregulator. It is worth noting that a marginal interaction effect of STRATEGY × STAGE on Fc of R4-R44 (rFG-lAG) was also observed. Considering the sample size of dyads is small in this study, we consider it more proper to treat this marginal effect as insignificant for prudential reasons.\n\nWith respect to the regulation stage of the IER process, we observed higher IBS of rFGRegulator-lDLPFCTarget and rAGRegulator-lFEFTarget in the ES group than in the CR group. During the ES-based IER process, the regulator needed to recognize the targets' facial or bodily expressions to confirm whether the targets have suppressed their emotional expressions successfully; the target engaged in more cognitive control, such as suppressing their emotional expressions. Given the role of frontal cortex in inhibitory control or response inhibition (Zheng et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2014), and FG in facial recognition (Rangarajan et al., 2014), the increased IBS of rFGRegulator-lDLPFCTarget and rAGRegulator-lFEFTarget may underlie the abovementioned social cognitive processes during the ES-based IER process.\n\nThis study has both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study extends the effectiveness of two typical intrapersonal emotion regulation strategies (CR and ES) to the IER process. More importantly, this study uncovers the intrapersonal and interpersonal neural correlates, mainly engaging brain areas within the social cognition system, cognitive control system, and mirror neuron system, that underlie the CR-based and ES-based real-time IER process using the nascent hyperscanning technique. All of this helps deepen our understanding of the neural substrates underpinning IER. Practically, the current findings indicate that both CR and ES strategies can downregulate others' negative emotions during the IER process. In light of this, CR and ES strategies are effective in not only intrapersonal emotion regulation, but also IER. One can use various emotion regulation strategies to regulate her own or others' (e.g., friends, followers) negative emotional states. In addition, these findings also offer suggestions to emotion regulation in contexts, such as interpersonal conflict, customer service, etc.\n\nSeveral limitations should be noted in this study. First, the findings should be cautiously generalized because of the external and ecological validity of this study. Participants were randomly asked to use the CR or ES strategy in this study. Whether the effect of strategies on IER process can be moderated by individual differences, such as personal preference for IER strategy, emotion regulation abilities, should be further examined. Second, although a series of a priori and post hoc g*power computation indicated that the current sample size was sufficient, which was also comparable to previous hyperscanning research (Jiang et al., 2012; Hou et al., 2020), the current findings would better be further examined in a larger sample. Third, only females were recruited in this study. For one thing, previous studies have shown that gender difference can affect the neural basis underlying interpersonal interaction (Baker et al., 2016) and intrapersonal emotion regulation (Stoica et al., 2021). This study originally aimed to unveil the neural basis underlying IER without tapping the gender effect, and thereby only females or males would be recruited. For another, given females are more responsive to negative emotion stimulus (Stoica et al., 2021) and partners' social support (Lüscher et al., 2014), and also more likely to provide better social support than males (Neff and Karney, 2005), female dyads were considered more proper than males for this study. It is worth noting that the current findings may be limited to females, and the potential gender effect on these findings deserves further exploration. Fourth, emotional states were only measured using self-reported scales, more objective indicators (e.g., heart rates, galvanic skin response, etc.) should be used in future research to quantify emotional changes. Ultimately, given that using IER strategies flexibly based on the context or the personality traits of the target are important (Fernandes and Tone, 2021), future research can also examine whether assessing regulation strategies flexibly can contribute to the IER process."
