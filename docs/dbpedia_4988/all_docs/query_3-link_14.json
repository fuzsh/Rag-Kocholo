        "text": "How Color in Graphic Design Evokes Emotion in the Viewer\n\nAre you familiar with color psychology? If you’re getting ready to re/design your logo or other promotional materials, you should be. Color psychology is the study of how color affects our emotions and behaviors. So getting the right color in graphic design is crucial. Certain colors make us feel a certain way. In fact, according to the way our natural senses function, color is the most influential. Shapes, symbols, and words are secondary.\n\nChoosing the Best Color in Graphic Design is Key\n\nThat’s because the graphic design of your logo and other promotional material is what gives the first impression. It’s the visual component of your brand and a big part of what builds brand consistency and brand recognition.\n\nAnd brand recognition – or lack thereof – can easily make or break a company.\n\nWe’ll take a look at the emotions behind certain colors, starting with the three primary colors:\n\nRed\n\nThe color red is often associated with passion, excitement, love and comfort. So it’s a color that’s often used in association with food – such as McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. But you also need to be cautious with red because the negative associations for this color are anger and danger.\n\nYellow\n\nYellow is the most eye-catching of colors, so it’s used to draw attention. Shell has taken advantage of it as their dominant logo color to bring drivers to their gas stations. Too much yellow can induce feelings of frustration and anger though, so be conservative in its use.\n\nBlue\n\nBlue is considered stable and non-threatening. IBM has used it to convey just that. But blue can also promote a sense of tranquility and peace. That’s why it’s often used in healthcare too. On the negative side of the spectrum, blue can shift into evoking feelings of sadness and aloofness. So use it wisely.\n\nGreen\n\nGreen is one of the most popular colors in branding because it carries so many connotations. Since it’s associated with nature, it’s a great choice for companies that focus on green initiatives. But it’s also connected to money, which makes it ideal for banks and other financial companies. Finally, it can be connected with good luck and fertility, so it could be applied to healthcare as well.\n\nOrange\n\nOrange is less complicated and is associated with enthusiasm and warmth. It’s been a favorite for Nickelodeon, Harley-Davidson and other companies that want to convey a sense of excitement and energy around their brand.\n\nPink\n\nMost people categorize pink as a feminine color. Therefore, it tends to evoke the more feminine qualities of kindness, softness, and compassion. Even so, pink can be playful too.\n\nPurple\n\nMysterious, spiritual and imaginative are all qualities given to purple. So it’s no wonder that it was a top choice for Hallmark. Although Yahoo! also opted for it. And it seems to work. So there’s the mystery.\n\nBlack/White\n\nTechnically, neither black nor white is a color. And chances are, neither one would be the single choice for a design. Especially not white. Either of them against another color can really pop though. So they should be considered as potential elements in a logo design to provide contrast.\n\nWhat Colors Best Convey Your Brand’s Message?\n\nUnderstanding the psychology of color and knowing how to choose color in graphic design gives you a huge advantage.\n\nSo if you’d like some professional advice on the best colors for your specific brand, contact us today.
