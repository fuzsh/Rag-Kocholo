        "text": "We've already looked at, and loved, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, but what of its less curvaceous sibling, the regular S6?\n\nCan its more vanilla looks win us over, or is it worth considering over the more expensive, but more glamorous Edge?\n\nSamsung Galaxy S6 vs iPhone 6S\n\nDesign\n\nThere's no way around it, but the S6 is much less appealing visually than the Edge. It's still a beautifully-designed phone, but when it comes to bang-for-buck style, the Edge just has - well, the edge.\n\nEven though the S6 looks more like a conventional phone when compared to the Edge, it's still a pretty new direction for Samsung. The rear is glass-backed to match the front, and the two halves are joined together by a metal frame which gives the phone a premium feel that you'd get on Apple's iPhone, or HTC's One M9.\n\nAt the back the camera lens protrudes very slightly - but that seems to be more common, especially on phones that have optical image stabilization. The S6 has all of the same sensors on the back as the Note 4, and can take your heart rate, blood oxygen level and use those numbers to work out your stress level.\n\nFrom the user interface perspective, the phone is also newly-designed, too. Samsung has cleaned up its UI enormously, and the phone is a lot cleaner and snappier now. Yes, some apps come pre-installed, but they can be removed if you don't want them. If they're core Samsung apps - like, say, S Health - you have the option to hide them. But honestly, there's not enough nonsense here to worry about - at least not on a review sample.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning here that the fingerprint scanner is massively improved over the S5 and Note 4. We've been using our old reference Note 4, and unlocking that phone with a fingerprint is an utter pain in comparison with the S6.\n\nCamera\n\nThe camera on the S6 is really, really good. One of the best features has to be HDR, because it allows you to take great photos when the lighting conditions would normally make for a really bad image. What's more, Samsung has taken the pain out of HDR because you no longer have to stand perfectly still when taking photos. This means that HDR can stay on all the time, and the results using it are very good.\n\nAnother feature we've used loads is the fast startup time. Double tap the home button and the phone jumps into the camera app in less than a second. This works when it's locked too, so if something is happening you can capture it without too much danger it will have ended before you've opened the camera.\n\nThe camera has plenty of detail, and while there's some of the softness that is inevitable on phone cameras, the software and hardware seem to work together to make the images look pretty solid. Even low light photography is reasonable, because of the optical image stabilisation and the f/1.9 lens.\n\nVideo too looks amazing. One feature well-worth using is 1080/60p shooting. The advantage of this mode is that the jerky and motion-blurred video of 24, 25 or 30fps is gone and video looks ultra-smooth. Some people like the filmic look of 24p video, but the reality of that is that movies are shot at that rate out of a historical cost-saving ideal, not a quality one.\n\nIf you're filming pets or children, or things that move, or you move the camera, then 60p is without doubt the best way to shoot. If resolution is more your scene, then you can up the resolution to ultra-HD for playback on your brand new UHD TV (assuming you've got the same money tree growing in your garden that we have in order to purchase such a set).\n\nBattery\n\nWhen the battery capacity of the S6 Edge and the S6 was announced it was something of a concern, because these are powerful phones with high resolution screens. Usually, it's a recipe for disaster when it comes to battery life. With the S6, though, that seems to be fine - not exceptional, but not the disaster you might have expected.\n\nIn normal use conditions, you'll get most of the way through the day without problems. If you're a heavy user, then you might need to use some of the options open to you with the S6. For example, switching to ultra power saving mode will reduce consumption enormously, and you'll still be able to use WhatsApp, text messaging and make calls. You can even Tweet in this mode, but 10% battery will see you through several hours.\n\nIf you don't want to switch off lots of the phone features, then perhaps invest in a wireless powermat for your desk at work. Because the S6 can charge on either a Qi or Powermat device, you should be able to charge your phone on virtually any wireless power charger.\n\nPerformance\n\nLike the battery, there were pre-launch concerns that the S6 would have performance problems after switching from Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810 to its own Exynos processor. In fact, the reality is that the S6 feels as smooth as any phone - including the iPhone - that we've used.\n\nSamsung has clearly spent time on both the processor performance and cutting the junk out of its UI. This seems to have sped everything up, and the S6 just feels incredibly snappy.\n\nFor gaming, video playback - and anything else - there is more than enough power here. Without delving into the technicalities of the processor and SOC used, this is clearly one of, if not the fastest phones in the world.\n\nS6 or S6 Edge?\n\nSadly, for a lot of people the economics of which phone to choose will lead them to get the S6 over the S6 Edge because it's much cheaper. You'll be paying a £100 or so premium for the Edge, and that's quite a lot for what amounts to a largely aesthetic difference.\n\nSome of the features on the Edge are nice, but none of them are so important that you'll pine for them with the standard S6. The style is by far the hardest thing to say goodbye to, but if you were given the choice of more storage or the curve, which would you take? That's the choice here, because for the price of an S6 Edge, you can get the 64GB S6.\n\nIf you still find yourself wanting the S6 Edge, then that's the phone you should get - and honestly, you'll love whichever you end up buying.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S6 is everything it should be. It's small, light and powerful. It's a new design that looks and feels great, and there's loads of power to run even the most challenging Android apps.\n\nThe new design for the S6 is streets ahead of the S5. Samsung has rid itself of that plastic body and made its flagship phone into something that feels like a flagship. Before it was always HTC and Apple that had the more impressive build quality, now though Samsung has joined them with a metal and glass construction that is fantastic.\n\nMake no mistake though, these are expensive phones. The lack of microSD storage might bother some, and the lack of replaceable battery could be a concern as the phone ages. For now though, we think the S6 is the best Android device out there."
