        "text": "Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked events are designed to showcase new products and features for its consumer devices, ranging from phones and tablets to smartwatches and wearables.\n\nThe last Galaxy Unpacked showcase took place on July 10, 2024 and saw the reveal of new foldable phones and Samsung's first smart ring, among other devices. For a recap on what happened moment-to-moment, check out our Samsung Galaxy Unpacked July live blog and do visit the TechRadar TikTok for videos from the event.\n\nOtherwise, read on for everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Unpacked and what's happened this year.\n\nWhat is Samsung Galaxy Unpacked?\n\nGalaxy Unpacked is the name given to the big Samsung product showcase. Normally these revolve around new Galaxy S-series phones and Galaxy Fold and Flip series foldable phones.\n\nBut Galaxy Unpacked events are also used to debut new Galaxy smartwatches and wireless earbuds, as well as laptops and tablets. There are also nods given to Samsung’s SmartThings smart home platform and its interoperability with the new Galaxy devices.\n\nIn general, you can expect two Galaxy Unpacked events a year; one at the start, ranging between January and March, and the other in around July or August.\n\nWhat was revealed at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked in July?\n\nJuly's Galaxy Unpacked focused on foldable phones and wearables, and as a result you can check our our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review, hands-on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review, hands-on Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 review, our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra review, and our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Ring review. And we also have our first impressions of the new Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\n\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\n\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nBut here's a quick summary of what was shown off and the respective article links.\n\nWe saw the reveal of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, the new flagship foldable phone that came with some neat design tweaks, a new chip and a suite of AI features.\n\nIt was joined by the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which got some tweaks, new colors and a 50MP main camera.\n\nWe finally got a full-look at the Samsung Galaxy Ring, the first smart ring from Samsung, complete with a range of smart fitness features.\n\nThe South Korean tech giant hit back at the Apple Watch Ultra with the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, a powerful and rugged smartwatch packed with features and aimed at outdoor exploration.\n\nMore sedate than the Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 brings in some welcome upgrades to the mainline Galaxy Watch series.\n\nBorrowing some AirPods-like design cues, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are new wireless earbuds that tap into some clever AI-centric features for live translation and better noise cancellation.\n\nWhat did Samsung show off at Galaxy Unpacked in January?\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra is Samsung's new top-end flagship phone, and we're impressed with it.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus also got some tweaks over their predecessors. So check out our Samsung Galaxy S24 review, hands-on Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus review.\n\nAll the new phones come with a suite of AI tools and features, and they impress when combined with camera upgrades.\n\nWhen is the next Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event?\n\nThe next Galaxy Unpacked event isn't likely to take place until 2025, with a January or February event expected to be on the cards and ushering in the reveal of the rumored Samsung Galaxy S25 series.\n\nSuch an event will probably be a retort to the likely reveal of the iPhone 16 series and Google Pixel 9 series, which have yet to debut this year (at the time of wring at least).\n\nYou might also like\n\nSamsung Galaxy Unpacked – 9 things we saw and learned, including the Galaxy Z Fold 6, Galaxy Ring, and Watch Ultra\n\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Ultra cameras: everything you need to know\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Ultra: what we want to see... if it ever happens\n\nManaging Editor, Mobile Computing\n\nRoland Moore-Colyer is Managing Editor at TechRadar with a focus on phones and tablets, but a general interest in all things tech, especially those with a good story behind them.
