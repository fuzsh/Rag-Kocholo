        "text": "Galaxy S6 (SM-G920F) (zerofltexx)\n\ne-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98\n\nFirst, I simply installed the new ROM e-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98 from the internal storage without a PC using e-Rocovery V1.20 via Apply update > choose from internal storage\n\nThe system boots, but remains at the animated e-logo for a long time. Nothing continues, not even after a factory reset.\n\nI then installed the new e-Recovery V2.0, which immediately displayed error messages (see Fig. 1). In addition, the touchscreen did not work, but the device hardware button did.\n\nAfter a factory reset and reboot into the e-Recovery V2.0, additional error messages were displayed (see picture 2).\n\nFailure messages\n\nNow I installed the Recovery OranageFox OrangeFox-R11.1-Stable-zerofltexx-1080p without errors, then e-2.0-t-20240513-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx.zip by @ronnz98 also without error messages.\n\nThe V2.0 system boots, but stops at the animated e-logo as before. Nothing continues.\n\nFinally, I reinstalled /e/ e-1.20-r-20240223-UNOFFICIAL by ronnz98.zip with the OF recovery without any errors - and everything is working fine again.\n\nVendor Name: Samsung\n\nDevice name: S6 SM-G920F\n\nDevice CodeName: zerofltexx\n\nVersion of /e/OS which existed previously: e-2.0-r-20240508-UNOFFICIAL-zeroltexx by @ronnz98\n\nVersion of Recovery which existed previously: TWRP 3.7.0_9.0\n\nThe device is Not rooted\n\nrecovery e-2.0-t-20240531-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98\n\nThe installation of boot.img and recovery e-2.0-t-20240531-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 using the pre-installed TWRP TWRP 3.7.0_9.0 is possible, but is accompanied by error messages.\n\ne-Recovery error messages\n\nAfter a factory reset, e-recovery freezes; it is not possible to return to the initial menu. e-Recovery can no longer be operated. My previously functioning S6 is no longer usable. I completely reset it and install stock firmware Android 7.x\n\nVendor Name: Samsung\n\nDevice name: S6 SM-G920F\n\nDevice CodeName: zerofltexx\n\n1.Version of Stock Firmware G920FXXU6ARC1 (Combination file, FactoryBinray-6 to check device)\n\n2.Version of Stock Firmware which existed previously: G920FXXS6ETI6 (2020 Android 7.0 BIN-6)\n\n3.Version of Recovery which existed previously: OrangeFox-R11.1-Stable-zerofltexx\n\n4. e-2.0-s-20240526-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexxby by @roonz98\n\ne-2.0-t-20240531-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 boots now\n\nI can’t verify the successful installation of build V2.0 T mentioned above!\n\nDespite several attempts (TWRP > INSTALL + TWRP > ADB Sideload) every new installation aborts with ERROR: 1.\n\nOn the other hand, the installation of e-2.0-s-20240526-UNOFFICIAL-zerofltexx by @ronnz98 is an uncomplicated child’s play and every flash attempt succeeds at the first attempt.\n\nNote: The e-rocovery contained in the ROM.zip is definitely unusable. It aborts every installation attempt, whether e-2.0-s or e-2.0-t by @ronnz98\n\nMy recommendation is:\n\nVersion of ROM: e-2.0-r-20240508-UNOFFICIAL-zeroltexx by @ronnz98\n\nVersion of Recovery: TWRP 3.7.0_9.0 or OrangeFox-R11.1-Stable-zerofltexx"
