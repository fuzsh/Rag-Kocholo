This is the most accurate way to emulate an S6 regarding the documentation that Samsung has.\n\nTake a look at Install Samsung Galaxy S6 skin in your Android Emulator:\n\nFor Samsung devices, Samsung provide emulator skins for its flagships devices like Galaxy S6, Galaxy S5 or Galaxy Note 4. In this tutorial, weâ€™re going to install Samsung Galaxy S6 Emulator skin but process is the same for all Emulator skins you want to install on Eclipse.\n\nIt talks about eclipse, but it's applicable for the Android Studio too.\n\nYou also have a Samsung Official video here which explains the same as the tutorial."
