        "text": "Do you feel energized when you see red? Does the color blue make you feel calm and relaxed? Artists and interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions. \"Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions,\" the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked.\n\nColor is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with physiological changes, including increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.\n\n\"It's amazing how colors can truly impact our mood and influence our behavior,\" says Rachel Goldman PhD.\n\n\"Take a moment to think about a familiar space to you, is there a color that stands out about that space? Think about your clothes and how different colored clothing makes you feel when you wear them. Perhaps the next time you are feeling kind of blah, think about this and see if your mood shifts by wearing a different color. Many times, it's the small things that can have the largest impact.\"\n\nFollow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / Amazon Music\n\nWhat Is Color Psychology?\n\nColor psychology is the study of how different colors affect human mood and behavior. It explores how colors can influence emotional responses, as well as how responses to color are affected by factors such as age and cultural background.\n\nDifferent topics that are of interest in this area include:\n\nThe meanings of colors\n\nHow colors impact physiological responses\n\nEmotional reactions to color\n\nFactors that impact color preferences\n\nCultural differences in the meanings and associations of different colors\n\nWhether colors can impact mental health\n\nHow colors can influence behaviors\n\nWays that colors can be utilized to promote well-being\n\nHow colors can be used to improve safety and design more optimal home and work environments\n\nMuch of the evidence in this emerging area is anecdotal at best, but researchers and experts have made a few important discoveries and observations about the psychology of color and its effect on moods, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nThe Psychological Effects of Color\n\nThe scientific exploration of color psychology is relatively new, but people have long been interested in the nature and impact of color. In ancient cultures, colors were often used to treat different conditions and influence emotions. They also played a role in different spiritual practices.\n\nWhy is color such a powerful force in our lives? What effects can it have on our bodies and minds? While perceptions of color are somewhat subjective, some color effects have universal meanings.\n\nColors in the red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors and include red, orange, and yellow. These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility.\n\nColors on the blue side of the spectrum are known as cool colors and include blue, purple, and green. These colors are often described as calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.\n\nOne 2020 study that surveyed the emotional associations of 4,598 people from 30 different countries found that people commonly associate certain colors with specific emotions. According to the study results:\n\nBlack: 51% of respondents associated black with sadness\n\nWhite: 43% of people associated white with relief\n\nRed: 68% associated red with love\n\nBlue: 35% linked blue to feelings of relief\n\nGreen: 39% linked green to contentment\n\nYellow: 52% felt that yellow means joy\n\nPurple: 25% reported they associated purple with pleasure\n\nBrown: 36% linked brown to disgust\n\nOrange: 44% associated orange with joy\n\nPink: 50% linked pink with love\n\nThe study's researchers suggested that such results indicated that color-emotion associations appear to have universal qualities. These shared meanings may play an essential role in aiding communication.\n\n\"Given the prevalence of color, one would expect color psychology to be a well-developed area,\" researchers Andrew Elliot and Markus Maier noted in a review of the existing research on the psychology of color. \"Surprisingly, little theoretical or empirical work has been conducted to date on color's influence on psychological functioning, and the work that has been done has been driven mostly by practical concerns, not scientific rigor.\"\n\nColor Psychology as Therapy\n\nSeveral ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to heal. Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology.\n\nColorology is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment. In this treatment:\n\nRed is used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.\n\nYellow is thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.\n\nOrange is used to heal the lungs and to increase energy levels.\n\nBlue is believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.\n\nIndigo shades are thought to alleviate skin problems.\n\nWhile more research is needed, a 2020 study suggested that chromotherapy may be an effective way to help combat feelings of compassion fatigue and post-traumatic stress in intensive care unit nurses.\n\nModern Research on Color Psychology\n\nMost psychologists view color therapy with skepticism and point out that the supposed effects of color are often grossly exaggerated. Colors also have different meanings in different cultures.\n\nHowever, existing research has found that color can impact people in a variety of surprising ways:\n\nWhile-colored pills are associated with greater pain relief., while red pills are associated with having greater stimulant properties.\n\nRed causes people to react with greater speed and force, something that might be helpful during athletic activities according to researchers.\n\nBlack-uniformed players are more likely to receive penalties in competitive sporting events.\n\nAdditional Research Is Still Needed\n\nInterest in the subject of color psychology is growing, but there remain several unanswered questions. How do color associations develop? How powerful is the influence of these associations on real-world behavior?\n\nCan color be used to increase worker productivity or workplace safety? What colors have an impact on consumer behavior? Do certain personality types prefer specific colors? As researchers continue to explore such questions, we may soon learn more about color's impact on human psychology.\n\nZena O'Connor, a faculty member in the Department of Architecture, Design, and Planning at the University of Sydney, suggests that people should be wary of many of the claims they see about the psychology of color.\n\n\"Many of these claims lack substantiation in terms of empirical support, exhibit fundamental flaws (such as causal oversimplification and subjective validation), and may include factoids presented as facts,\" O'Connor explains. \"In addition, such claims often refer to outdated research without referring to current research findings.\"\n\nColor Can Influence Performance\n\nStudies have also shown that certain colors can have an impact on performance. No one likes to see a graded test covered in red ink, but one study found that seeing the color red before taking an exam actually hurt test performance.\n\nWhile the color red is often described as threatening, arousing or exciting, many previous studies on the impact of the color red have been largely inconclusive. The study found, however, that exposing students to the color red prior to an exam has been shown to have a negative impact on test performance.\n\nIn the first of the six experiments described in the study, 71 U.S. colleges students were presented with a participant number colored either red, green or black prior to taking a five-minute test.\n\nColor and Consumer Purchases\n\nColor psychology suggests that various shades can have various effects, from boosting our moods to causing anxiety. But could the color of the products you purchase ever say something about your personality? For example, could the color of the car you buy somehow relate to some underlying personality traits or quirks?\n\nWhen buying items, your color preferences might say something about the image you are trying to project. Color preferences, from the clothes you wear to the car you drive, can sometimes make a statement about how we want other people to perceive us. Other factors, such as age and gender, can also influence our color choices.\n\nWhite: As many of our readers have suggested, the color white can feel fresh and clean. The color is often used to evoke a sense of youth and modernity.\n\nBlack: Our readers often describe black as a \"powerful\" color, which might be the reason why black is the most popular color for luxury vehicles. People often describe the color as sexy, powerful, and mysterious.\n\nSilver: It's the third most popular vehicle color and is linked to a sense of innovation and modernity. High-tech products are often silver, so the color is often seen as new, modern, and cutting-edge.\n\nRed: Red is a bold, attention-getting color, so preferring this type of car might mean you want to project an image of power, action, and confidence.\n\nBlue: People often describe blue as the color of stability and safety. Driving a blue car or SUV might indicate that you are dependable and trustworthy.\n\nYellow: According to the experts, driving a yellow vehicle might mean you are a happy person in general and perhaps a bit more willing than the average person to take risks.\n\nGray: The experts suggest that people who drive gray cars don't want to stand out and instead prefer something more subtle.\n\nA person might prefer brighter, more attention-getting colors when they are younger, but find themselves drawn to more traditional colors as they grow older. The personality of the buyer can play an important role in color selection, but buyers are often heavily influenced by factors such as price as well as availability.\n\nFor example, purchasing a white vehicle might be less about wanting people to think that you are young and modern and more about the climate you live in; people who live in hot climates typically prefer light-colored vehicles over dark ones.\n\nKeep in Mind\n\nSo what's the bottom line? Experts have found that while color can have an influence on how we feel and act, these effects are subject to personal, cultural, and situational factors. More scientific research is needed to gain a better understanding of color psychology."
