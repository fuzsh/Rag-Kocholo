        "text": "Hello,\n\nI recently upgraded to Android13 and after few hours I turn tablet off and now is stuck in infinite boot loop.\n\nI can't access recovery mode with or without cables.\n\nMy theory is because first logo that appears is Android logo and then Samsung logo.\n\nOn S22 phone and all other phones I have (Note8, Note10) first logo is Samsung then Android logo.\n\nIs there any workaround for this ? It just loops until battery dies\n\nI tried with few cables, with charger, even with AKG earphones that comes with phones, it wont boot into recovery mode and when I press and hold buttons on first logo (Android) it just stays on it until I release all buttons\n\nThx\n\n@NyperCro: If you have access to a home computer, try connecting your Tab S6 Lite via USB cable, then press and hold the Volume Up and Side buttons together until you see the Samsung logo, then release, to see if you can access recovery mode in this manner. Alternatively, try pressing and holding the Volume Down and Side buttons together until the device powers on, as this will perform a Soft Reset, and resolve any temporary software issues.\n\nLike I said, i tried all cable connections to USB with pc, laptop... no go\n\nI have 3 buttons, volume up/down and power/lock\n\nWhen holding Volume up and power/lock it just stays on first logo (android) for some time and then just continues until second logo (Samsung) and then reboots. Soft reset does nothing, just returns to loop\n\n@Nick58328 wrote:\n\nWere you able to resolve this?\n\nNo, I tried everything that I know and what I found. All buttons combinations, cables, connecting to earphones (that actualy worked before I upgraded to Android 13), chargers, pcs, other Samsung devices, nothing works.\n\nOnly thing left is using Adb but it cant be done since USB debugging is turned off on device. Next step is sending it to repair shop. If anyone have more ideas I am all ears.."
