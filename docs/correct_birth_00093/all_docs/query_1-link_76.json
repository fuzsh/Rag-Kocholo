        "text": "GM – LIF – Today’s American Champion is an American tennis coach and former professional tennis player from the United States. McNeil was a singles semi-finalist at both the US Open in 1987 and Wimbledon in 1994, a women's doubles finalist at the Australian Open in 1987 with Zina Garrison and French Open mixed doubles winner in 1988 with Jorge Lozano.\n\nRemember - “It wasn’t until that final match that I actually believed that I could win the whole thing, At that point I started to believe that if I had made it that far, I might as well win it all.” – Lori McNeil\n\nToday in our History – December 18, 1963 - Lori McNeil was born.\n\nMcNeil was a childhood friend of fellow African-American pro Zina Garrison. Lori's father Charlie McNeil played professional football with the San Diego Chargers in the 1960s.\n\nLori McNeil attended Oklahoma State University for two years and played tennis for the Cowgirls, reaching the 1983 NCAA Quarterfinals (losing to eventual champion Beth Herr from USC).\n\nMcNeil played on the WTA Tour for 19 years from 1983–2002. She won a total of 10 singles and 33 doubles titles during her career. Her career-high world rankings were World No. 9 in singles (in 1988), and World No. 4 in doubles (in 1987).\n\nIn 1987, McNeil received the WTA Most Improved Player of the Year award.\n\nMcNeil is perhaps best remembered for her results against Steffi Graf. In 1992, McNeil defeated Graf 7–5, 6–4 in the first round of the WTA Tour Championships, marking the first time since 1985 that Graf had lost in the opening round of a tournament. Then, in 1994, McNeil beat Graf 7–5, 7–6 (7–5) in the first round at Wimbledon, the first time in Grand Slam history that a defending-champion had suffered a first round loss.\n\nThat year, McNeil went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon before losing to eventual-champion Conchita Martínez 3–6, 6–2, 10–8. This equalled McNeil's best-ever Grand Slam singles performance – she also reached the semi-finals at the US Open in 1987 (after defeating six-time champion Chris Evert in the quarterfinals) where she lost to Graf 4–6, 6–2, 6–4.\n\nDespite never winning a women's doubles Grand Slam title, she reached the quarter-final stage or better on 22 occasions at Grand Slam level, and won multiple WTA-tour doubles titles with many of the leading doubles players of the era, including Martina Navratilova, Gigi Fernández, Rennae Stubbs, Katrina Adams, Zina Garrison and Helena Suková.\n\nLori McNeil had a long and successful career playing in the WTA Tour for 19 years from 1983 to 2002. She won 10 Singles and 33 Doubles titles in her career. Her highest Singles ranking of World Number 9 was achieved in July 1988 and her career-best Doubles ranking was Number 4 which she attained in 1987, the same year that she won the WTA Most Improved Player Award.\n\nLori McNeil knew a thing or two in beating the legendary Steffi Graf. She handed the German great her first ever first round loss in a tournament in 7 years at the WTA Championships of 1992. In 1994, she shocked defending champion, Steffi in the opening round of Wimbledon - making it the only instance in the Championships history where a defending player has been knocked out in the opening round.\n\nLori McNeil's only Grand Slam title was the Mixed Doubles title which she won in the French Open on 1998 with her Italian partner Jorge Lozano.\n\nLori McNeil played on the professional circuit for 19 years from 1983-2002.\n\nDuring that period of time, she won one Grand Slam mixed doubles title at the French Open in 1988 (partnering Jorge Lozano).\n\nShe won a total of 10 singles and 33 doubles titles during her career. Her career-high world rankings were World No. 9 in singles (in 1988), and World No. 4 in doubles (in 1987).\n\nMcNeil, 45, joined the USTA staff in 2004 after working for three years at the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Md. She also served as personal coach for Amanda Coetzer for three years and was an assistant coach for the U.S. Olympic team in both 2004 and 2008. McNeil played professionally on the WTA Tour for 17 years and reached career-high rankings of No. 8 in singles and No. 4 in doubles. She won 12 singles titles and 40 doubles titles over the course of her career, including a mixed doubles championship at the French Open. She also recorded semifinals appearances in singles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. Additionally, McNeil represented the U.S. for three years in Fed Cup competition.\n\nMcNeil played collegiately at the Oklahoma State University where she was named an All-American after her sophomore year. She also serves as chair of the Lori McNeil Foundation, which raises money for youth tennis programs in Bermuda.\n\nResearch more about African American women in Tennis and share with your babies.
