        "text": "Martina Hingis burst on the tennis scene in the mid-1990s as a precocious teenager with a brilliant game, loaded with variety.\n\nIn 1996, at 15, she earned her first Grand Slam title, teaming with Helena Sukova to win the 1996 Wimbledon doubles title.\n\nIn 1997, at 16, she rose to No. 1 in the world and captured three Grand Slam singles titles — Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.\n\nShe was headed straight for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDespite a few bumps, injuries, the occasional controversy, and a retirement and a return, Hingis will indeed be enshrined with the game's all-time legends.\n\nThe International Tennis Hall of Fame announced Monday in New York that Hingis, longtime ESPN tennis broadcaster Cliff Drysdale, tennis promoter and industry leader Charlie Pasarell and Romanian great Ion Tiriac have been elected to the 2013 class. They will join previously announced Australian legend Thelma Coyne Long at enshrinement ceremonies July 13 at the Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I. Since 1955, 224 people from 19 countries have been inducted.\n\n\"Being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame is tremendous honor,\" Hingis, 32, said in a statement. \"It is truly a privilege to be part of such an exclusive group of tennis icons. I am looking forward to the enshrinement weekend in Newport and to being welcomed in by the other Hall of Famers.\"\n\nHingis was No. 1 in singles for 209 weeks overall, and No. 1 in doubles for 35 weeks, joining the elite company of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, Lindsay Davenport and Kim Clijsters as the only players to be No. 1 in singles and doubles simultaneously.\n\nHingis ended up with 15 major titles, five in singles and 10 in doubles.\n\nAfter her dominant 1997 season, Hingis was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year, the WTA Player of the Year, and the ITF Player of the Year.\n\n\"Many congratulations to Martina. She's such a great person,\" Serena Williams said Monday at a news conference in advance of the BNP Paribas Showdown. \"I'm happy for her. She obviously had a Hall of Fame career and achieved so much at such an early age. She did so much for the sport and inspired me a lot to play. We had a lot of tough matches. It was definitely inevitable and she's so young to be in the Hall of Fame so it's pretty awesome.\"\n\nHingis first retired in 2003, at 22, citing a series of injuries and playing in pain. She made a comeback in 2006, winning two titles that year and closing the season at No. 7. She won her final title in 2007, the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, before officially retiring.\n\nAt times in her career, controversy followed her.\n\n•She had a difficult rivalry early with Venus and Serena Williams, questioning their claims of racism and suggesting they had \"big mouths.\"\n\n•In 1999 she said about Amelie Mauresmo, who was big and strong and open about being a lesbian, she's \"half a man.\"\n\n•In 2007 Hingis announced she was under investigation for testing positive for cocaine. She denied using the drug but decided to retire rather than face a suspension.\n\nSince retirement, she has been active in World TeamTennis, and in 2011, she partnered with Lindsay Davenport to win the Roland Garros Legends title. Most recently, Hingis has taken on a coaching role, and she is currently working with up and coming teenagers.\n\nJoining Hingis in the 2013 class:\n\nDrysdale, in the contributor category: After a successful career as a player — 35 singles titles and 24 doubles titles — Drysdale became one of the founding members of the ATP and served as its first president in 1972.\n\nSince he retired as a player, Drysdale — born in South Africa but now a U.S. citizen — has been one of the most familiar voices in all of tennis broadcasting. Drysdale, 71, has been on the air with ESPN since the network's very first tennis telecast — a Davis Cup match between the USA and Argentina on Sept. 14, 1979, one week after ESPN's debut.\n\nDrysdale has been named \"Best Tennis Announcer\" by the readers of Tennis magazine four times.\n\n\"Tennis had given me everything,\" Drysdale said at the announcement ceremony. \"For the small part that I played in it, maybe I've done something to help the game, but I will say that the game has done a heck of a lot more to help me than I have for the game. I've loved this game since I was knee height of a grasshopper playing against the wall. \"\n\nPasarell, in the contributor category: Pasarell, 69, is most recently best known as the past tournament director, managing partner, and former owner of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., but his contributions as a tennis industry leader have spanned all levels of the sport and have been a driving force in the growth of the tennis for more than 40 years. Originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico, Pasarell has been a longtime resident of California.\n\n\"It's going to be an incredible, daunting experience to be there among so many people I have admired and idolized for so many years,\" Pasarell said. \"It's going to be a very emotional thing for me. It's hard to find the words to express how excited, pleased and emotional I am about it.\"\n\nBefore becoming a driving force in the leadership of the sport, Pasarell was an outstanding player. He won the 1966 singles and doubles NCAA titles at UCLA. In 1967 he was the highest-ranked American player. He played on five U.S. Davis Cup teams, winning the title in 1968. And he claimed 18 singles titles, including the U.S. National Indoor Championships in 1966 and 1967. Pasarell joined Drysdale as one of the founders of the ATP, and he served on the board during the crucial early years.\n\nIn 1969, Pasarell partnered with Arthur Ashe and Sheriden Snyder to launch National Junior Tennis & Learning. The goal of the organization was to have a positive impact on at-risk children by introducing them to tennis. The program continues to be the largest grassroots tennis program in the USA, with more than 950 chapters.\n\nPasarell helped build the Indian Wells event into one of the biggest, best-attended, most popular events on the tour. The event, which started with a 7,500-seat stadium court, now has a 24-court, 54-acre complex including a 16,100-seat main stadium, seven smaller stadiums, and 44 luxury suites.\n\nTiriac, in the contributor category: Tiriac, 73, has been an influential tennis leader in roles ranging from coach to player manager to tournament promoter. In the 1970s, Tiriac and fellow Romanian Ilie Nastase partnered to form a successful doubles team.\n\nTiriac took a sharp, business-like approach to tennis and he worked tirelessly to promote the players, grow the tournaments, and build up interest in the sport through television broadcasts. He went on to manage the careers of top players including Hall of Famer Guillermo Vilas, Mary Joe Fernandez, Goran Ivanisevic, and most notably, Hall of Famer Boris Becker, who won five Grand Slam titles while working with Tiriac.\n\nTiriac was a promoter and tournament director for numerous events including the ATP World Tour's season-ending Masters Grand Prix, and two of the largest Masters 1000 events, the Italian Open and the Madrid Masters. He is still an active leader on the Madrid Masters, and under his leadership the tournament has grown immensely, and is one of the most well attended annual events in Spain."
