She achieved notable success in her career, winning four Grand Slam singles titles: the Australian Open in 1980 and 1987, the French Open in 1981, and the US Open in 1985.\n\nMandlíková also reached the finals of four other Grand Slam singles events, including Wimbledon and the US Open. She partnered with Martina Navratilova to win the women's doubles title at the US Open in 1989. In 1994, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall.\n\nMandlíková maintained a consistent presence in the top tiers of women's tennis throughout her career, achieving a career-high singles ranking of No. 3 in April 1984. She played a crucial role in leading Czechoslovakia to victory in the Federation Cup three times between 1983 and 1985.\n\nNotably, she defeated both Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova at the 1985 US Open, becoming one of the few women to win Grand Slam titles on grass, clay, and hard court. Mandlíková retired in 1990 and later coached Jana Novotná, leading her to a Wimbledon singles title.\n\nMandlíková is the daughter of Vilém Mandlík, an Olympic athlete.\n\nBorn: February 19, 1962\n\nBirthplace: Prague, Czechoslovakia\n\nAge: 62 years old"
