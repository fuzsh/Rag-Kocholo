        "text": "Wimbledon champion Michael Stich and Helena Sukova, a 14-time major winner in doubles and mixed doubles, will be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame on July 21 in Newport.\n\nThe announcement of the Class of 2018 was made Thursday at the Australian Open in Melbourne. The induction ceremony will be in conjunction with the ATP World Tour event. Tickets for the induction ceremony go on sale March 5 and can be purchased at tennisfame.com.\n\nStich, a German who reached a high of No. 2 in the world, and Sukova of the Czech Republic will be inducted in the Player Category.\n\n“I’m very pleased to congratulate and welcome Michael and Helena in to the International Tennis Hall of Fame,” Hall of Fame President Stan Smith said in a release. “Being elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame ensures that their careers and accomplishments will forever be distinguished as being among the greatest in our sport’s history.”\n\nStich won at the All England Club in 1991, beating Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker in the process. A year later, he teamed with John McEnroe to claim the doubles title at Wimbledon. Stich appeared in two more Grand Slam singles finals, the US Open in 1994 and the French Open in 1996.\n\nIn his career, he won 18 singles titles.\n\n“It’s quite an honor to become part of the International Tennis Hall of Fame,” Stich said in the release. “I’m humbled to be included among this elite group of tennis athletes, many of whom I so greatly admired and was inspired by throughout my career.”\n\nSukova was the world's No. 1-ranked doubles player for 68 weeks and reached No. 4 in the singles rankings. She also advanced to the finals of the Australian Open and US Open in singles.\n\nBut doubles is where she was a dominant player. She partnered with younger brother Cyril Suk III to win three mixed doubles titles in majors, two at Wimbledon and one at the French Open.\n\nShe played on 13 Fed Cup teams, winning four championships, and claimed two silver Olympic medals."
