        "text": "For the first time in nearly a dozen years the lady had come back\n\nhome. The countryside where she grew up was vibrantly green, the\n\nprecious gardens in every yard bountiful, the fruit trees ripe. Even\n\nin the old street by the tennis club in Revnice, Queen Anne's lace\n\nsprang up through the cracks in the pavement, and in the fields\n\nnear the family house the mushrooms grew everywhere. It was a\n\nglorious time to return. ''But it is not a good year for\n\nblueberries,'' the lady said.\n\nPerhaps. No matter how fine it is to go home, something should\n\nremain forever unsurpassed -- especially if you may never go back\n\nagain. So at least the blueberries must have been better when Martina\n\nNavratilova was a child and a Czech, and when Prague, 27 kilometers\n\naway, was Oz.\n\nIn the part of Texas where the lady now lives -- which calls\n\nitself (God knows why) the Metroplex -- Prague would be merely larger\n\nthan a mall and smaller than the airport. But the capital of\n\nCzechoslovakia has resolve and grandeur, and it is as patient as its\n\ndark beauty is ancient. The people queue for a half hour for ice\n\ncream cones, and while St. Wenceslas, the city's patron, once\n\npromised to pop back if things ever got really sticky, neither\n\nreligious atrocity nor foreign occupation, neither the jackboots of\n\nthe Nazis nor the tanks of Moscow have been enough to summon his\n\nreturn. ''Don't bother asking for Wenceslas yet,'' the Czechs say,\n\n''for things are bound to get worse.''\n\nSo this summer, for just a moment's time, Martina reappeared\n\ninstead. No saint, for sure, but every inch a symbol. Her name,\n\nNavratilova, even means ''she who returns.'' And so she did, although\n\nas her time passed in Czechoslovakia, Navratilova came more to mean\n\nshe who represents hope and then, at the last, she who triumphs.\n\nIn the Federation Cup, the piece of business that brought\n\nNavratilova back to her native land, she led the U.S. to the\n\nchampionship, beating the bride of two days, Hana Mandlikova, as the\n\nU.S. shut out Czechoslovakia 3-0 in Sunday's finals. But the outcome\n\nof the cup matches was not nearly as important as how the crowd --\n\nand how the state -- reacted to the lady from Revnice, especially\n\nwhen she squared off for America against the land of her birth under\n\na big sign that proclaimed SPORT HELPS PEACEFUL UNDERSTANDING AMONG\n\nNATIONS.\n\nForty-one nations from all parts of the world competed in the\n\nFederation Cup. It was -- save the Olympic Games of Moscow and\n\nSarajevo -- the most consequential athletic event ever conducted in a\n\ncommunist nation. Every notable female tennis competitor was on hand.\n\nThey included not only the home- team stars, Mandlikova and Helena\n\nSukova, who were the defending champs, but also, as the major party\n\ndaily dutifully reported, such visitors as Grafova, Sabatiniova,\n\nTurnbullova, Temesvariova, Shriverova and Evertovalloydova.\n\nCzech government officials were never under any illusions. If they\n\nwere to win a bid for the Federation Cup, they would have to issue a\n\nvisa to the lady who left home so rudely in September '75. The\n\nadmission of the prodigal was part of a natural continuum. Three\n\nyears ago, movie director Milos Forman, who had left Czechoslovakia\n\nin 1969, was allowed to shoot Amadeus in Prague, and for some time\n\nnow Navratilova's parents have been permitted to visit Martina in\n\nTexas almost at will. This year's women's final at Wimbledon,\n\nbetween the good queen, Mandlikova, and the bad queen, Navratilova,\n\nwas shown on state television. It was the first time Martina had\n\nappeared on TV in Czechoslovakia since her defection.\n\nBy contrast, the Wimbledon men's final between Czech citizen Ivan\n\nLendl and West Germany's Boris Becker was not shown on Czech TV.\n\nLendl, you see, has become persona non grata with the party for his\n\nrefusal to come back from Connecticut -- where he resides in a\n\nmansion with guard dogs while awaiting his green card -- to play for\n\nCzechoslovakia in the Davis Cup. So his de- existence has begun.\n\nIndeed, in the streets and beer bars of Prague, the most curious\n\nrumor persists: Lendl has married into the family of Richard Nixon,\n\nwho is synonymous with communist bashing.\n\nNavratilova's stock with party officials has risen but a smidgen\n\nin the 11 years she has been gone. At the famous Prague tennis club,\n\nSparta, all vestiges of her existence have been removed. On those\n\nrare occasions when she is admitted to the Czech public\n\nconsciousness, as in the Wimbledon telecast, any reference to her\n\npast is omitted. In her debut at the Federation Cup last week, a\n\nfirst-round match against China, she was shunted to the grandstand !\n\ncourt, which seats 800 people. Meanwhile, inside the magnificent new\n\nstadium, a match between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria was played.\n\nThe Central Court holds 7,500, and possibly 20% of the seats were\n\ntaken. Those few on hand rooted lustily against the Soviets.\n\nOn the tiny grandstand court the overflow crowd stood three- and\n\nfour-deep, climbing upon chairs, ladders and television platforms to\n\ncatch a glimpse of Martina. Others looked back on her from the\n\nstadium across the way. On the elevated railroad tracks that run\n\nbehind the courts, an engineer kept running his train back and forth\n\nin order to watch the historic proceedings. The umpire became so\n\ndiscombobulated by all the fuss that after the first game he said,\n\n''Game, Navratilova.'' Cheers. ''Excuse me. Game, United States.''\n\nTitters. In the middle of the match, Martina -- who never wins the\n\ncrowd in her adopted country -- couldn't help but turn to Evert Lloyd\n\nin the stands and say, ''I want to play you here.''\n\nAfter her easy victory over her Chinese opponent, the linesmen\n\nwere among those who besieged Navratilova for her autograph.\n\nGovernment officials were aghast at the display of warmth and kept\n\nthe American matches off Czech TV. The local newspapers provided only\n\nbare-bones accounts of the matches.\n\nFor all the effort the party puts into pretending that people like\n\nNavratilova and Forman never existed as Czechs, only the dim-witted\n\nare fooled. One day last week, in the old part of Prague,\n\nschoolchildren from the small town of Klatovy were taking a tour of\n\nthe big city. A visitor asked: Do you kids know what sporting event\n\nis going on in Prague?\n\n''Pohar Federace,'' they quickly replied.\n\nAnd who is the best player in this competition? ''Martina\n\nNavratilova.''\n\nYes, and where does she come from? Slight pause. Then, from the\n\nboldest few: ''Odgud.'' (From here.) The others smiled and nodded.\n\nThese were provincial children, barely born when the lady defected,\n\nyet they knew. They all knew.\n\nThat is amusing, however, only if you don't have to live daily\n\nwith such madness. Economically, Czechoslovakia ranks near the top of\n\nthe Eastern bloc countries -- the first VCR rental store opened last\n\nweek, and the hookers of Prague are more brazen than those of\n\nHollywood Boulevard -- but politically, the repercussions of '68 are\n\nstill felt. ''They just don't kill people anymore,'' says a Czech\n\nbusinessman with a shrug. The erosive ''timelessness'' of communist\n\nsociety that the Czech playwright Vaclav . Havel has written of seems\n\nto be the worst oppression. But then, in this summer when the\n\nblueberries are not juicy, the lady came back on an American\n\npassport, free and clear. ''It has nothing to do with politics,''\n\nsaid a doctor. ''Martina has freedom, and we do not, so I must cheer\n\nfor her. How else can I ever let the bastards know?''\n\nNavratilova was remarkably composed upon her return. For\n\nchroniclers of history, let it be recorded that at the instant her\n\nplane touched Czech soil she was speaking, with great animation,\n\nabout William (the Refrigerator) Perry. Cyril Suk, a tennis official,\n\nstaunch party member and father of Helena, the No. 2 Czech player,\n\nescorted Navratilova through a light rain into the terminal. Then,\n\nhorribly, came bleak reality. Martina's face dropped; the blood and\n\nhappy spark of reunion went out of it. The door opened, and there\n\nbefore her stood that menace she knows only so well from her past.\n\nThe Western press.\n\nLights. Shouts. Rudeness. Pushing. Shoving. Martina's mother was\n\nall but blinded by a flashbulb; her coach, Mike Estep, and his wife,\n\nBarbara, were nearly trampled. How Kafka must have chuckled in his\n\nnearby grave as Navratilova beat a retreat. The tender moment of\n\nreturn to her native land had been destroyed by those free to come\n\nand chronicle it. In a communist country, the state tells you how to\n\nfeel. In a democracy, the press demands to know how you feel. Either\n\nway, you are not allowed to feel. So it was not until\n\nNavratilova's second day back that Czechoslovakia began in earnest\n\nto reclaim its lady. As soon as she marched into the stadium as an\n\nAmerican at the opening ceremonies, the rhythmic clapping ended and\n\napplause for her began. She smiled tentatively, unsure how to\n\nrespond. But her eyes misted when the band struck up her old national\n\nanthem, the title of which is, by coincidence, Where Is My Home?\n\nThen Mandlikova, representing the host team, stepped forward to\n\nspeak to the crowd. She and Navratilova have never been close, but\n\nMandlikova thrilled the stadium and rocked the party brass assembled\n\nin the official box by bravely welcoming Navratilova by name. She did\n\nso twice, first in her English remarks and then in Czech. The\n\nspectators cheered when they heard Mandlikova pronounce the name\n\nWestern-style (Nav-ra- till-OH-va), but they exploded when she\n\nrepeated it in Czech (Nav-ROT-ee- lo- va). Standing next to Martina,\n\nEvert Lloyd reached over, rubbed her friend's neck and fondly patted\n\nher back.\n\nAs it turned out, Mandlikova was just getting down to tricks. She\n\nhad driven to Prague from the Netherlands in her Porsche, telling\n\nfriends she didn't give a hoot how ostentatious she might appear to\n\nthe comrades. Then, on Friday morn, at the Old Town Hall, without any\n\nwarning, she married one Jan Sedlak, a 33-year-old Australian of\n\nCzech origin. The bride wore blue leather. Cryptically she explained\n\nthe choice: ''Because I must wear white at Wimbledon.'' Oh.\n\nThe matrimony certainly was matter-of-fact. After the ceremony,\n\nthe unsmiling bride said, ''We had a cup of coffee, went to the hotel\n\nto change, and back to work.'' Her countrymen were suspicious that\n\nMandlikova had married an Aussie to gain leverage in her dealings\n\nwith the demanding Czech tennis authorities, that it might be the\n\nbeginning of another defection. Had Mandlikova found a more novel way\n\nto pull off what two more of their hockey players had done earlier in\n\nthe week in America?\n\nWorse, every day the lady from Revnice was winning more hearts.\n\nYoung men dashed onto the court to give her roses. The crowds began\n\nto acclaim her, and she grew more responsive -- first waving shyly,\n\nthen giving the thumbs-up sign and, at last, blowing kisses. Why, it\n\nalmost seemed as if the Statue of Liberty had gone on tour, turning\n\nin her torch for a Yonex racket. Czech officials grew so enraged that\n\non Friday they ordered the umpire not to introduce Navratilova by\n\nname. She became ''On my left the woman player from the United\n\nStates.''\n\nDuring Sunday's finals, the poor crowd was nearly schizophrenic.\n\nBy the time Navratilova took the court, Evert Lloyd had staggered to\n\na 7-5, 7-6 victory over Sukova, and Czechoslovakia was down a point.\n\nWhen Navratilova and Mandlikova were introduced, the opponent\n\nreceived almost twice as much applause as the home heroine. But as\n\nthe match wore on, the people pulled more and more for Hana. They\n\nwanted a big one in the W column. Never mind symbolism and liberty.\n\nIn Prague, no less than in Philadelphia or the Metroplex, winning is\n\nthe simple thing. Let the rest of life traffic in complexities.\n\nAfter 11 games without a service break, Mandlikova blew a 40-0\n\nlead and double-faulted away the set. As Martina rambled to a 6-1\n\nwin in the second set, the Czechs, sensing the inevitable, began to\n\ncheer again for the American. In the last game, a tour de force for\n\nNavratilova, there was a crescendo for her. She was one of them\n\nforever.\n\nMartina had hardly struck the winning shot when the prime minister\n\nof Czechoslovakia, Lubomir Strougal, rose in the first row of the\n\nparty box and left without acknowledging the winner -- or the loser.\n\nThe other officials followed in his wake. Not one clapped, and by the\n\ntime the Czech team captain, Jiri Medonos, had found his way past\n\nMandlikova to grasp Navratilova's hand and praise her, Strougal and\n\nhis minions had gone. Sport helps peaceful understanding among\n\nnations.\n\nIt may well be that the men in the box will decide not to let\n\nNavratilova return again to taste the blueberries. But at least for a\n\nmoment in one soft summer, she had broken the drone of timelessness\n\nin Czechoslovakia. END\n\nPhoto(s):\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY RONALD C. MODRA\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS BY RONALD C.
