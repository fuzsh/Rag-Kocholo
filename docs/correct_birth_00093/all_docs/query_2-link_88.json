        "text": "Michael Stich and Helena Sukova were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Rhode Island. They were enshrined Saturday during a ceremony on Newport's grass center court outside the hall. Stich won Wimbledon in 1991 and a gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics in doubles with German countryman Boris Becker. Sukova is from the Czech Republic. She captured 14 Grand Slam doubles crowns — nine in women's, five in mixed . . . Third-seeded Steve Johnson beat Marcel Granollers, 6-3, 6-3, to reach the Hall of Fame Tennis Open final. The 28-year-old American will face Ramkumar Ramanathan in the final Sunday morning. Ramanathan, of India, topped American Tim Smyczek, 6-4, 7-5 . . . Fabio Fognini edged Fernando Verdasco for the first time on clay to reach the Swedish Open final against Richard Gasquet . Fognini won, 6-1, 4-6, 7-5, even after losing two break leads in the deciding set of their 2-hour, 17-minute semifinal. He lost his previous three matches with the Spaniard on clay . . . Mandy Minella has a chance at becoming the third mother to win a WTA singles title in the last 12 months after reaching the Ladies Championships Gstaad final. Minella, of Luxembourg, overcame 19-year-old Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, to reach her first career final at 32.\n\nBasketball\n\nCeltics waive Abdel Nader\n\nThe Celtics have waived forward Abdel Nader, a league source confirmed on Saturday. Nader averaged 3 points and 1.5 rebounds in 48 games for Boston as a rookie last season. The Celtics selected him with the 58th overall pick of the 2016 draft and he spent his first pro season playing for the team’s G-League affiliate, the Maine Red Claws. He was named the league’s rookie of the year. Nader had a partial $450,000 guarantee for next season, but his $1.4 million salary would have become fully guaranteed if he was not waived before Aug. 1.\n\nAdam Himmelsbach\n\nBaseball\n\nFamilia traded to Oakland\n\nJeurys Familia has been traded by the New York Mets to the Oakland Athletics for two minor leaguers and international bonus money. The deal was announced before the Mets’ Subway Series game at the Yankees. The Mets get righthander Bobby Wahl, infielder Will Toffey and $1 million in international slot money . . . A day after saying he may need surgery on both heels that would require an eight-to-10-month recovery, Yoenis Cespedes was out of the Mets’ starting lineup because of body soreness and New York’s front office did not publicly comment on his startling health revelation . . . The St. Louis Cardinals placed righthander Carlos Martinez on the 10-day disabled list before a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs. Martinez, who has dropped his last two starts, has a right oblique strain . . . Colorado Rockies second baseman DJ LeMahieu was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a strained left oblique.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiscellany\n\nWorld record walk in London\n\nTom Bosworth avoided a race-ending third caution and improved his own walking world record at the London Stadium when he clocked 10 minutes, 43.09 seconds in the 3,000 meters. The 28-year-old British walker was yellow-carded twice at the Anniversary Games. Bosworth won silver in the men’s 20-kilometer race walk at the Commonwealth Games in April . . . The Wild and Matt Dumba agreed on a five-year, $30 million deal to keep the 23-year-old defenseman in Minnesota after a breakout year. Dumba had 14 goals and 36 assists to go with a plus-15 rating in 82 games last season, when he had career highs in games played, goals, assists, and points. He was a restricted free agent . . . Josef Martinez set an MLS record with his sixth career hat trick and Atlanta United rallied to beat D.C. United, 3-1. Martinez has a league-leading 22 goals in 22 appearances this season. With 12 matches to go, he’s on pace to break the MLS season scoring record of 27 held by Roy Lassiter, Chris Wondolowski, and Bradley Wright-Phillips . . . Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk unified the cruiserweight division by beating Russian Murat Gassiev by unanimous decision in Moscow. Usyk controlled the fight with his jab to add Gassiev’s IBF and WBA titles to his own WBC and WBO belts.\n\nGet Sports Headlines\n\nThe Globe's most recent sports headlines delivered to your inbox every morning.\n\nEnter Email"
