        "text": "I am Australian born. My connection with Prague commenced in 1990 following the Velvet revolution.\n\nMy Czech husband who fled in 1948, returned to his homeland and from that time life was divided between Australia and the Czech Republic. I actually joined IWAP in 1991, but the intermittent interruptions for me to return to Australia made it impossible to continue my membership. However, my constant annual visits strengthened my love affair with Prague and the Czech Republic.\n\nI finally settled to reside permanently in Prague in 2014 when I joined IWAP again.\n\nFrom my first day at the General meeting as a member I have been an active member in many of the interest groups and have wallowed in all that IWAP has to offer. I love the diversity of the members and the friendships that have developed. Although I have family living in Prague, being a member of IWAP made my settling into Central European life so much easier.I am a professional artist and have had a long and interesting career since I graduated in Melbourne with a Fine arts degree in 1960. I have four adult children and 8 grandchildren.I have many passions, classical music, art, gardening, anything creative that gives visual pleasure, which Prague fulfils entirely, and am also a health and keep-fit fanatic.I am so grateful to be a part of this amazing womenâ€™s organization."
