        "text": "In a world driven by competition and a relentless pursuit to win, we often hear about accomplishments and stellar performances of athletes from the past and present.\n\nAlthough baseball is Americas national pass time, we can most certainly agree that recognition of all sports fall from popular to least popular. Now, tennis in America as popular as it is, can't compare in popularity with baseball, football, and basketball.\n\nI know it's a debatable topic, but in defense to all tennis faithful out there, let me express why tennis is where it is today, and although their are many reasons, allow me to focus on just one athlete.\n\nHer name is Martina Navratilova, born on 11/18/1956, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. As she grew, she began gaining interest in tennis, being that the Czech Tennis Federation was oppressively controlled by a communist system, she emigrated to the United States in 1975.\n\nHere in the states she did not hesitate to make a name for herself, in the late 70's she had already been crowned the WTA Tour Player of the Year twice, winning her first two Wimbledon singles championship, and for the first time being ranked number one of many to come.\n\nIn the early 80's she had become the most dominant player, by 1983 she had an outstanding record of 86-1 and although their are many accomplishments and records in her remarkable career, let us fast forward to 2003 where at the age of 47 not only did she become the oldest player to win a Grand Slam Title but, also giving her a Grand Slam “boxed set” (winning all four Grand Slams playing singles, doubles, and mixed doubles).\n\nShe continued to win past her prime up to her last match where she matched up with Bob Bryan walking away as the U.S. Open mixed doubles champions, and accomplishing her 59th Grand Slam title, undeniably placing her mark in tennis history.\n\nHow do we compare her feats at her age with other great athletes in their respective sport?\n\nGiven that other sports rely on a team atmosphere, this has to be clearly one of the greatest athlete to ever compete in any sport.\n\nThe fact that she continued to compete at a high level past her 40's (age) one can only wonder her dedication and preparation it took for her in becoming one of the greatest to ever play the game of tennis."
