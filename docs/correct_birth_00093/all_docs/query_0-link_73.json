        "text": "Help\n\nDashboard\n\nThe Czech Republic at one sight\n\n#Czech Republic overview, #English, #Maturita, #geography\n\nCreated by Petra Bydžovská\n\nChlebíček\n\nit is an open-face sandwich, which can be bought in a deli or is being prepared during many families celebrations, chlebíčky consist of sliced bread that has butter or another kind of spread on it, atop which a variety of toppings may be added.\n\nToppings used on obložené chlebíčky include various cured meats such as ham, salami and sausage, sliced hard-boiled egg, cheeses, cream cheese, cucumber, tomato, fish paste, salads and various spreads prepared with meat, vegetables or cheeses.\n\nIce hockey\n\nThe Czech national team\n\nThe Czech national team is one of the top teams in the world, regularly competing in the World Championship, the Winter Olympic Games and the Euro Hockey Tour.\n\nThe national team captured their first Olympic Gold at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano. From 1996 to 2001, the Czech Republic won six World Championship medals, including three consecutive gold from 1999 to 2001.\n\nProminent Czech players include Jaromír Jágr, Dominik Hašek, Patrik Eliáš, Tomáš Plekanec, Aleš Hemský, Tomáš Kaberle, Milan Michálek and Robert Lang, who captained the 2006 Olympic team to a bronze medal.\n\nThe team last won gold at the 2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships\n\nModern + pop\n\nFestivals:\n\nMightysounds\n\nRockforpeople\n\nMastersofrock\n\nColours of Ostrava\n\nBest of Czech pop music\n\nBest of Czech metal, rock and punk music\n\nUNESCO SITES\n\nUNESCO SITES\n\nPrague, the capital with its incredible historic center (and famous monuments such as the Astronomical Clock, Charles Bridge, and Prague Castle).Olomouc, a vibrant university town with the second largest historic center after Prague.Český Krumlov - beautiful city with castle.Holašovice - preserved baroque villageTelč - well preserved renaissance townZelená Hora - unique baroque churchLitomyšl - reneissance chateau and historic centreKutná Hora - silver mining town with gothic cathedral and other sights.\n\nVila Tugendhat in Brno\n\nTřebíč - preserved Jewish quarterLednice-Valtice Area - cultural landscape - chateaus, castles, ponds, gardens...Kroměříž - Arcbishop Palace and garden\n\nBohemisms, also called Czechisms\n\nare English words that were derived from the Czech lands.\n\nRobot\n\nOkay, you already knew this one. The word ‘robot’, invented by writer Karel Čapek for his 1920 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots), was derived from the Czech word robota, meaning manual labor.\n\nPolka\n\nThe term for the traditional Czech dance (possilby) comes from Půlka, meaning half, referring to the tempo. The exact etymology is debated (it might also be named after the term for Polish people, Polák), but the term is certainly Czech.\n\nKolache\n\nThe traditional Czech pastries, from the Czech word koláč, may not be as well known throughout the English-language world as some of the other words on this list, but they’ve been surging in popularity in southern US states recently.\n\nHowitzer\n\nThough Germanized, the term for this piece of field artillery comes from the Czech word houfnice, which dates back to the cannons used in the 1420s Hussite Wars. A howitzer is defined as any cannon capable of both high-angle and low-angle trajectory.\n\nNebbish\n\nYes, it’s Yiddish. However, the word has Czech roots. Used in American English for more than a century, the word is often used to describe the kind of character Woody Allen often plays in his movies. Originally, it meant someone who was poor or unfortunate (“nebohý”).\n\nPistol\n\nThe general English-language term for a handgun or type of handgun comes from the Czech word píšťala, which again dates back to the Hussite Wars and refers to one of the earliest examples of a firearm or “hand cannon.”\n\nSemtex\n\nThe plastic explosive was originally created for use by the Czechoslovak military in the 1960s, and named after Semtín, the town in the Pardubice region where it was originally manufactured.\n\nPilsner\n\nOf course. The term for this particular style of beer comes from Pilsner Urquell (Plzeňský Prazdroj), the world’s first-ever pilsner-style lager.\n\nTolar\n\nCzech name for a silver coin minted in the Kingdom of Bohemia in the 16th century in Jáchymov (German Joachimsthal), the main currency of Bohemia from 1520-1750.\n\nThe modern word dollar came from the Spanish dollar, due to their similarity in size and weight to the German Thalers first minted from a silver mine in 1520 in Joachimsthal.\n\nTunnelling\n\nNot in the literal sense, but when used as a term for financial fraud the word most likely dates back to Czech origins in the 1990s, when newly-privatized companies went bankrupt after management transferred assets to their own personal corporations. This type of fraud was termed tunelování, and the fraudster a tunelář.\n\nAbsurdistan\n\nThis term is closely connected to the “Theatre of the Absurd” and the first president of the Czech Republic, also a playwright, Václav Havel, who used it in one of his plays. This term then became very popular in connection with former Eastern Bloc countries. Even nowadays you might overhear the Czechs referring to the Czech Republic as Absurdistán on many occasions.\n\nParts of Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech lands (Česko [ˈtʃɛskɔ] in Czech) consist of three historical lands:\n\nBohemia (Čechy),\n\nMoravia (Morava) and Czech Silesia (Slezsko).\n\nNorth Bohemia\n\nCzech Republic/ Czechia\n\nThe Czech Republic, also known by its short-form name, Czechia, is a landlocked country in Central Europe bordered by Austria to the south, Germany to the west, Poland to the northeast and Slovakia to the southeast.\n\nThe Czech Republic covers a total surface area of 30,450 square miles (78,865 square kilometers), which ranks 118th in the world in terms of size.\n\nThe country's population density is 347 people per square mile (134 people per square kilometre), which ranks 62nd in the world.\n\nLargest Cities in Czech Republic\n\n3 out of every 4 people living in the Czech Republic live within, or very close to, a metropolitan area. The capital and largest city of the Czech Republic is Prague with an estimated 1.3 million people, with a metropolitan population of 2.7 million. Prague is not only the capital of the Czech Republic, but is also widely considered a European capital because of its culture, arts, industry, architecture, and history. Other major cities include Brno (386,000 city, 730,000 metro) and Ostrava (305,000 city, 1.1 million metro).\n\nGoogle maps\n\nCastles, chateaux, twelve UNESCO monuments and historical cities are some of the most popular trip destinations in the Czech Republic. Come and see the winding lanes with their magical atmosphere, medieval ramparts and romantic corners.\n\nAncient times are combined with the modern present in several locations. Or can your holidays not do without hiking or cycling trips? Indulge yourself in unforgettable experiences and set out to wander around the picturesque countryside.\n\nThe Czech mountains offer a great number of experiences in summer and in winter. Finally dont forget the Czech spas some of the most popular in the world.\n\nEaster\n\nOn Easter Monday it is customary for guys to (slightly) spank girls and women with a wicker stick with colourful ribbons at the end (pomlázka), in the hope that the girls and women will in turn give them coloured eggs, candy or drinks.\n\nIn the morning, men gently spank women with a special handmade whip or switch called pomlázka or karabáč (in Czech) or korbáč (in Slovak) or siba or korbács (in Hungarian). The pomlázka consists of four to twenty-four withies (willow rods or other twigs), is usually from half a meter to two meters long and decorated with coloured ribbons at the end.\n\nIf men arrive at women's houses after 12 o'clock, women throw a bucket of cold water on them. In some regions the men also douse girls with water or spray perfume on them.\n\nWhen going house to house, the male first sings a verse relating to eggs and spring themes like bountifulness and fertility, the young woman turns around and the man takes a few whacks at her backside with the whip. The spanking may be painful, but is not intended to cause suffering. In cities, it's usually practised only among family members.\n\nIn the past, young boys would chase young girls on the village streets with the whips, and vintage illustrations of people in traditional dress show girls running or hiding. Playful running around, similar to the game of tag, still occurs, but aggressive ambushing is now considered unacceptable bullying by the modern generation.\n\nTradition says that women should be spanked with a whip in order to keep their health, beauty and fertility throughout the following year.\n\nAccording to 2019 survey, 60% of Czech households follow the tradition of spanking (or watering) someone on Easter Monday\n\nEaster\n\nEmil Zátopek 1948, 1952\n\nHe is the only person to win the 5,000 metres (24 July 1952), 10,000 metres (20 July 1952) and Marathon (27 July 1952), in the same Olympic Games.\n\nEmil Zátopek ( 19 September 1922 – 21 November 2000) was a Czechoslovak long-distance runner best known for winning three gold medals at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. He won gold in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres runs, but his final medal came when he decided at the last minute to compete in the first marathon of his life. He was nicknamed the \"Czech Locomotive\".\n\nZátopek was selected for the Czechoslovak national team for the 1946 European Championships in Oslo and finished fifth in the 5,000 m in 14:25.8, breaking his own Czechoslovak record of 14:50.2.\n\nAt the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, Zátopek won the 10,000 m and finished second behind Gaston Reiff from Belgium during a driving rainstorm in the 5,000 m.\n\nIn 1954, Zátopek was the first runner to break the 29-minute barrier in the 10,000 metres. Three years earlier in 1951, he had broken the hour for running 20 km. He was considered one of the greatest runners of the 20th century and was also known for his brutally tough training methods. He was the originator of interval training and hypoventilation training.\n\nIn February 2013, the editors at Runner's World Magazine selected him as the Greatest Runner of All Time.\n\nClassic highlights from the Helsinki 1952 Olympic Games as Czech Emil Zátopek becomes the only person ever to win the 5,000m, 10,000m and marathon events at one Olympic Games.\n\nThe guy was a Mammoth. At the time of the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki he had no match in the 10 000 meters. However he wanted to run the 5000 metres as well. He believed his kick wasn't fast enough to win the 5000 m. So 6 months before the 1952 Olympics he started a rigouris routine. So worried about his kick that on one particular day, (this is mind blowing) he ran the 400meters 100 TIMES!! That is fucking insane. After winning gold in both races he decided to enter into the marathon. He'd never ran a marathon before so his strategy was simple. He'd run side by side with the current world record holder. And Zatopek WON!\n\nTertiary\n\nFlag\n\nBEER SNACKS\n\nAlso try traditional beer snacks, often the only food served in some pubs (hospoda, pivnice), and designed to be washed down by a good beer:\n\nUtopenec - (means 'drowned man' in Czech) a pickled sausage with onion, garlic and other vegetables and spices.\n\nZavináč - (rollmop) a slice of pickled fish, most often herring or mackerel, rolled-up and filled with various pickled vegetables (sauerkraut, onion, sometimes carrot or pepper).\n\nTlačenka s cibulí - (brawn with onion) a slice of haggis-like meat pudding, sprinkled with vinegar and garnished with fresh onion slices. Beware, can be rather acidic due to vinegar.\n\nNakládaný Hermelín - pickled Brie-like cheese, often marinated with garlic and chilli.\n\nPivní sýr - beer cheese - a soft cheese, with a strong, Cheddar-like flavour. You should add a splash of beer to the cheese, and then mash it all together, and serve it on traditional Czech bread - Šumava (the name of a region in South Bohemia) is the most common bread, a very tasty dense loaf made from rye and carroway seeds.\n\nTvarůžky or Syrečky - traditional cheese with a very strong aroma, and very much an acquired taste. Often served deep-fried, but can be eaten alone, just with some chopped onion, mustard and bread. Sometimes also marinated in beer ('syrečky v pivu'). This cheese naturally contains almost no fat (less than 1%).\n\nRomadur - traditional cheese with strong aroma. Aroma is similar to Tvarůžky, but Romadur is different type of cheese.\n\nMatesy s cibulí - (soused herring) cold fish served with onions.\n\nIf you want a warm, bigger, and more complicated meal which goes excellently with beer, get some of the typical Czech meals based on fatty meat (pork, duck, or goose) with sauerkraut and knedlíky (dumplings). Another excellent option is a whole pork knee with horseradish and bread (ovarové koleno s křenem).\n\nDaniel Sýkora\n\ndeveloped a computer procedure (algorithm) how to turn a flat 2D animated film The Lion King into a plastic spectacle in a 3D version.\n\nHe worked on a new process called Ink-and-Ray together with Walt Disney's studio, which invited Daniel Sýkora to the USA.\n\nSurroundings\n\nThe city’s advantageous location at the center of the region and the great number of marked hiking and cycling routes make it possible to explore attractive cultural and natural sites in the surroundings. Located nearby is Neo-Gothic Hluboká Castle with rich collections of art in its interiors, and the Renaissance spa town of Třeboň.\n\nThe sites included on the UNESCO World Heritage List are definitely worth a visit:\n\nHolašovice with its vernacular Baroque architecture, and the historic gem of Český Krumlov.\n\nNature lovers will appreciate the Blanský Les hills with the highest point Kleť, the Třeboň fishpond district and the Novohradské Mountains.\n\nSouth Bohemia\n\nSouth Bohemia is a region in the Czech Republic. It offers many picturesque towns with two of them on the UNESCO list, peaceful countryside filled with number of ponds, medieval castles, romantic chateaux and some hills at the south.\n\nWhile the region is often unknown to foreign tourists (except Český Krumlov and few other castles), it is quite popular between local tourists and definitely has something to offer for everyone.\n\nFor local tourists, a popular way to discover this region is by bike - with nice, often relatively flat countryside and good biking infrastructure, this is a fun and relaxing way to discover South Bohemia.\n\nThe way South Bohemia looks today is to a large scale determined by the Rožemberk noble family, which ruled the area between the 14th and 17th centuries.\n\nThey built most of the fish ponds, castles, canals, towns and cities which are today the main tourist attractions.\n\nAnother thing which shapes the region is the River Vltava; the Czech Republic's main watercourse springs here. There two big water dams on the Vltava in South Bohemia, which somehow changed the way nature looks here.\n\nThe last important thing which shaped this region is the former presence of German population. Ethnic Germans lived in today's South Bohemia from the 12th century until they were expelled to Austria and Germany following World War Two.\n\nSome of the homes they had to leave were resettled by people from central Czechia and Slovakia, but many other formerly German villages were destroyed during the communist era.\n\nYou can still find ruins of villages in remote places like Novohradské hory. These places, being near the border with capitalist Western Europe, were off-limits during the communist era and are slowly being rediscovered today by both Czech people and descendants of expelled Germans.\n\nThis part of Czechia is definitely a beer part, as the attitude is too high to grow vine.\n\nThe most famous beer from South Bohemia is definitely Budweiser Budvar, which is sold globaly, but made only in České Budějovice (and owned by the government).\n\nOther good brands include Regent from Třeboň, Eggenberg from Český Krumlov, Platan from Protivín, Dudák from Strakonice, Samson from České Budějovice and many others.\n\nThere are also many microbreweries with good crafted beers. You can visit almost any working brewery to see how the beer is made. Breweries also often have their own restaurants nearby, a good example of this the Eggenberg brewery in touristy Český Krumlov with an excellent restaurant.\n\nPrague Castle\n\nJaroslav Heyrovský\n\nHeyrovský was the inventor of the polarographic method, father of the electroanalytical method, and recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1959 for his discovery and development of the polarographic methods of analysis. His main field of work was polarography.\n\nMountains\n\nThe most notable mountain ranges in the Czech Republic are all found along the borders of the country.\n\nIn the Bohemia it is the Bohemian Forest and Ore Mountains, both bordering Germany.\n\nThen the long mountain range of Sudeten with Sněžka (1602) – the highest peak of the Czech Republic.\n\nThe last major mountain range is the Beskid Mountains in the east, which then continue further east into Poland and Slovakia.\n\nMartina Sáblíková 2010, 2014, 2018\n\nthe most successful person is Martina Sablikova in speed skating, she competed in 3 Olympic games ( 2010, 2014 and 2018) and has won 7 medals.\n\nMiloš Forman\n\nMiloš Forman (1932)Czech born Academy Award winning movie director who emigrated to the USA in 1968.\n\nThe movies he directed include One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975), Hair (1979), Ragtime (1981), Valmont (1989), Amadeus (1984), The People vs. Larry Flynt (1996), Man on the Moon (1999)\n\nMilos Forman at Letterman\n\nMaking of Amadeus\n\nCastle Špilberk\n\nŠpilberk Castle is a castle on the hilltop in Brno, Southern Moravia. Its construction began as early as the first half of the 13th century by the Přemyslid kings and complete by King Ottokar II of Bohemia.\n\nFrom a major royal castle established around the mid-13th century, and the seat of the Moravian margraves in the mid-14th century, it was gradually turned into a huge baroque citadel considered the harshest prison in the Austrian Empire, and then into barracks.\n\nThis prison had always been part of the Špilberk fortress and is frequently referenced by the main character, Fabrizio, in Stendahl's novel, \"The Charterhouse of Parma.\"\n\nClassical\n\nAntonín Dvořák Symphony No. 9 \"From the New World\"\n\nThe Symphony No. 9 in E minor, \"From the New World\", Op. 95, B. 178 (Czech: Symfonie č. 9 e moll „Z nového světa“), popularly known as the New World Symphony, was composed by Antonín Dvořák in 1893 while he was the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America from 1892 to 1895.\n\nIt is by far his most popular symphony, and one of the most popular of all symphonies.\n\nIn older literature and recordings, this symphony was – as for its first publication – numbered as Symphony No. 5.\n\nAstronaut Neil Armstrong took a tape recording of the New World Symphony along during the Apollo 11 mission, the first Moon landing, in 1969.\n\nThe symphony was completed in the building that now houses the Bily Clocks Museum.\n\nBedřich Smetana - Vltava\n\nMá vlast also known as My Fatherland, is a set of six symphonic poems composed between 1874 and 1879 by the founder of Czech national music and Czech composer Bedřich Smetana,which portrays the history, legends and landscape of the composer's native Bohemia.\n\nIt contains the famous symphonic poem \"Vltava\", which was inspired by the Bohemian Forest and it is also popularly known by its German name \"Die Moldau\" (in English, \"The Moldau\").\n\nJakub Jan Ryba\n\nwas a Czech teacher and composer of classical music.\n\nIn 1796, he wrote his most famous work, Czech Christmas Mass \"Hey, Master!\" (named by him as Missa solemnis Festis Nativitatis D. J. Ch. accommodata in linguam bohemicum musicam). This work continues to be frequently performed at Christmas time in Bohemia.\n\nKindergarten, 3-6\n\nSt. Vitus Cathedral\n\nThe Czech Republic is a land of many great cathedrals. Perhaps the most important one is the Gothic St. Vitus Cathedral at the Prague Castle.\n\nIt has a great importance for the Czech nation as a coronation place of Bohemian kings and also the place of their last rest.\n\nIt contains treasury for the most precious relics of the kingdom and remains of patron saint Wenceslaus.\n\nPlaces to visit\n\nElemetary, 6-15\n\nElementary school is mandatory for children from ages six to fifteen.\n\nAfter that, some students leave formal education altogether, while other students attend a professional or vocational school.\n\nEnrollment in public schools is fairly high\n\nFAMOUS HOLLYWOOD MOVIES FILMED IN PRAGUE\n\nBaked pastries and buns\n\nBaked pastries and buns are another popular choice, especially on weekends or special occasions.\n\nPopular choices include kolache, buchty, bublanina, and babovka.\n\nBacked duck with sauerkraut\n\nThis hearty Czech food is a dish of roasted duck with red cabbage and dumplings or with sauerkraut.\n\nThe ingredients combine to form a dish that’s got a little of everything when it comes to flavor. There is saltiness, richness, tanginess, and sweetness in every bite.\n\nRoasted duck or roasted goose is very popular in the Czech Republic. These cooked birds are eaten regularly by families at the dinner table, but also served on special occasions such as New Year’s Eve.\n\nFeast of St. Mikuláš (St. Nicolaus, Santa Claus), Dec. 5\n\nOn this day, St. Mikuláš roams about with his consorts, an angel and a devil. He gives small presents and candy to children to reward them for their good behaviour throughout the year, while the devil chastises children for their wrongdoings over the course of the year and gives them potatoes, coal (or sometimes spankings) as a punishment.\n\nŠkoda\n\nTrade and economy\n\nThe most important sectors of the Czech Republic’s economy in 2018 were industry (30.2%), wholesale and retail trade, transport, accommodation and food services (19.2%) and public administration, defence, education, human health and social work activities (15.5%).\n\nIntra-EU trade accounts for 84% of the Czech Republic’s exports (Germany 32%, Slovakia 8% and Poland 6%), while outside the EU 2% goes to both the United States and Russia.\n\nIn terms of imports, 76% come from EU Member States (Germany 29%, Poland 9% and Slovakia 6%), while outside the EU 8% come from China and 2% from the United States.\n\nThe Czech Republic has a developed, high-income export-oriented social market economy based in services, manufacturing and innovation, that maintains a welfare state and the European social model.\n\nThe Czech Republic participates in the European Single Market as a member of the European Union, and is, therefore, a part of the economy of the European Union, but uses its own currency, the Czech koruna, instead of the Euro.\n\nSouth Moravia\n\nThis region is very rich on architectonical monuments of all styles and is pride on cultural-historical tradition\n\nRivers\n\nThere are four major rivers in the Czech Republic.\n\nElbe (Labe in Czech) flows from Krkonoše Mountains in the north east of Bohemia to the west and then flows through northern Germany all the way to the North Sea.\n\nMorava River drains most of Moravia and flows to the south into Danube and ultimately to the Black Sea.\n\nOdra River starts in the Moravian Silesia and flows north through Poland into the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe fourth major river is Moldau (Vltava in Czech), which is the longest river of the Czech Republic and drains the southern part of Bohemia before flowing into Elbe in Mělník.\n\nWhile the Elbe is the longest Czech-related river when measured through its overall length (i.e. including its lower course in Germany), its tributary the Vltava surpasses it as the longest river within the territory of the Czech Republic itself. (In fact the Vltava also carries more water than the Elbe at their confluence.)\n\nBarbora Špotáková 2008, 2012\n\nBarbora Špotáková is a Czech track and field athlete who competes in the javelin throw.\n\nShe is a two-time Olympic Champion and three-time World Champion, as well as the current world record holder with a throw of 72.28 m.\n\nBronze medalist from the Olympic Games in 2016.\n\nOlympic games medailists\n\nGold24Silver28Bronze35Total Olympic Medals87\n\nthe most successful person is Martina Sablikova in speed skating, she competed in 3 Olympic games ( 2010, 2014 and 2018) and has won 7 medals.\n\nthe winners: Olympic Games winners\n\nthe silver ones: the silver medails\n\nthe bronze ones: the bronze ones\n\nfor more details go to : Czech Republic at the Olympics\n\nThe most successful athletes in Czech Olympic summer history with two golds are Štěpánka Hilgertová, Barbora Špotáková, Jan Železný and Martin Doktor.\n\nIn the Winter Olympics the most successful branch of Czech athletes at the Olympic Games is speed skating, in which they won a total of seven medals (three gold and two silver and bronze), and cross-country skiing with one gold, five silver and three bronze.\n\nMartina Sáblíková won the most medals from the Winter Olympics with three gold, two silver and one bronze.

It is heavy and quite fatty, and is excellent in the winter. In the recent time there was a tendency towards more light food with more vegetables, now the traditional heavy and fatty Czech food is usually not eaten everyday and some people avoid it entirely.\n\nHowever nothing goes as well with the excellent Czech beer as some of the best examples of the traditional Czech cuisine, like pork, duck, or goose with knedlíky (dumplings) and sauerkraut.\n\n10 Traditional Czech Dishes You Need To Try\n\nA traditional main meal of a day (usually lunch) consists of two or three dishes.\n\nThe first dish is hot soup (polévka).\n\nThe second dish is the most important part, very often based on some meat and side-dish (both served on the same plate).\n\nThe third, optional part is either something sweet (and coffee) or small vegetable salad or something similar.\n\nPlzeň\n\nis a city in the Czech Republic.\n\nAbout 90 kilometres (56 miles) west of Prague in western Bohemia, it is the fourth most populous city in the Czech Republic with about 175,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe city is known worldwide for Pilsner beer, created by Bavarian brewer Josef Groll here in 1842.\n\nWest Bohemia\n\nJaroslav Seifert\n\nNobel Prize in Literature\n\ntennis\n\nThe Czech Republic hosts a number of tennis events each year, the most notable of which is the WTA Prague Open, which has WTA International status since 2015. The Czech Open in Prostějov, the Prosperita Open in Ostrava and the Prague Open are part of the ATP Challenger Tour, while the Prague Open is also part of the ITF Women's Circuit.\n\nThe Czech Republic Davis Cup team has won twice in 2012 and 2013, whereas the and Czech Republic Fed Cup team has won six times in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2018.\n\nThe best tennis players from the Czech Republic include Jaroslav Drobný, Ivan Lendl, Jan Kodeš, Petr Korda, Tomáš Berdych, Radek Štěpánek, Martina Navratilova, Jana Novotná, Petra Kvitová, Karolína Plíšková and Lucie Šafářová.\n\nIvan Lendl\n\nMartina Hingis & Helena Sukova vs Larissa Neiland & Meredith McGrath Wimbledon Doubles Final 1996\n\nMartina Hingis & Helena Sukova Wimbledon Doubles Final 1996\n\nLanguage\n\nLanguages\n\nCzech is the official state language and as a literary language dates to the late 13th century. The majority of the population speaks Czech as their first language.\n\nCzech and Slovak are mutually intelligible languages belonging to the West Slavic language group, which uses the Latin (Roman) rather than the Cyrillic alphabet. Among the other languages spoken by minorities in the Czech Republic are Romani, German, and Polish.\n\nHowever, if you can learn the alphabet (and the corresponding letters with accents), then pronunciation is easy as it is always the same - Czechs and Slovaks pronounce every letter of a word, with the stress falling on the first syllable. The combination of consonants in some words may seem mind-bogglingly hard, but it is worth the effort!\n\nThe Czech language has many local dialects, especially in Moravia. Some dialects are so different that they can sometimes be misunderstood even by a native Czech speaker from a different region. However all Czech people understand the standard Czech (as spoken in TV, written in newspapers and taught in schools) and should be able to speak it (but some are too proud to stop using their local dialect). Some of them are even unable to speak standard Czech but write it correctly.\n\nEva Samková 2014,\n\nEva Samková won the gold medal in the snowboard cross at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was World Cup snowboard cross champion in 2016-17.

They are technologies that work with matter at the level of atoms and molecules. Nanofibres are ultra-thin fibres, just 1 billionth of a metre wide - that's 100,000 times thinner than a human hair. They have long been at the centre of research at the Technical University in the northern Czech town of Liberec.\n\nFilters made from nanofibres are extremely efficient because they have such tiny pores that no bacteria or viruses can pass through. Such materials can also be used to make protective garments and breathing masks. Nanofibres are also being used in tissue engineering and as wound dressings which efficiently protect for instance burns on the body.\n\nNanospider, photo: Elmarco\n\nNanofibres are still waiting for their full potential to be discovered. But for that they first need to leave the laboratories. The team of professor Oldrich Jirsak have developed a technology that allows mass commercial production of nanofibres.\n\nFed Cup\n\nThe Billie Jean King Cup is the premier international team competition in women's tennis, launched in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The competition was known as the Federation Cup until 1995, then as the Fed Cup until September 2020, when it was renamed after Billie Jean King.\n\nThe women's equivalent of the Davis Cup is the Fed Cup. Australia, the Czech Republic, and the United States are the only countries to have won both Davis Cup and Fed Cup titles in the same year.\n\nCzech_Republic_Fed_Cup_team\n\nState-run police and military training academies\n\nThe University of Defence (in Czech: Univerzita obrany, UO) is the only military institution of higher education of the Czech Armed Forces. Established as of 1 September 2004, it was formed by merging three existing institutions: Military Academy Brno (established in 1951), the Military University of the Ground Forces Vyškov (established in 1947) and the Military Medical Academy Hradec Králové (re-established in 1988).\n\nUnlike public universities, as a state institution with limited authority the University of Defence is the only university-type school in the Czech Republic that is not a legal entity but an element in the Ministry of Defence structure. Thus, the rights of the Minister of Education towards the public universities are performed by the Minister of Defence.\n\nUniversity of Defence is responsible for education of military professionals and experts engaged in national security system, defence industry and public administration. The available Bachelor’s, Master’s and doctoral degree programmes, both in full- and part-time mode, focus on military and national security fields.\n\nUniversity of Defence represents the Army of the Czech Republic’s defence and security research and development centre. The fields of science fostered at the University of Defence primarily relate to defence applied research, to forces and population protection, or the economics or medicine fields applied to military. In the Czech Republic, they are exclusive fields,[such as weapons and ammunition, fighting vehicles, radars, population protection, fire support control, field surgery, radiobiology or toxicology.\n\nFaculties and other elements of the university\n\nThe University of Defence consists of three faculties:\n\nFaculty of Military Leadership – Brno\n\nFaculty of Military Technology – Brno\n\nFaculty of Military Health Sciences – Hradec Králové\n\nand an institute and three centres:\n\nNBC Defence Institute – Vyškov\n\nSecurity and Military Strategic Studies Centre - Brno\n\nLanguage Centre – Brno\n\nPhysical Training and Sports Centre – Brno\n\nUniverita Obrany\n\nThe Police Education and Training Unit (PETU) was established in 2015 and is the leading agency regarding all education and training of the police forces for the Czech Republic.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the Police Academy is a university-level institution, where specialised training for police, public administration, and private security services is provided.\n\nSome branches are open to civilians while some are only for police officers and other para-military groups such as firefighters and soldiers.\n\nThe schools are open to recruits holding advanced educational degrees (bachelor's degree or higher).\n\nBasic training centers for recruits are called \"secondary police schools\" and every law enforcement officer must advance through one of these centres.\n\nIn this system, \"senior police schools\" still exist that have the educational status of \"higher learning\", where specialisations are offered.\n\nMunicipal police may have access to several training centers, and some larger cities have their own dedicated campuses.\n\nSome municipalities conduct training through privately licensed agencies.\n\nBread or Rolls with Spreads, cheeses, or meats\n\nA typical Czech breakfast consists of a slice of rye bread or a roll (rohlík) with a spread such as butter, jelly, or honey, or perhaps a slice of cheese or meat such as salami or ham. This versatile meal is an incredibly popular way to begin the day in the Czech Republic. Homemade garlic or egg salad spreads are also a popular topping to flavor your bread or roll.\n\nGeneral secondary school/ grammar school\n\nGrammar school is either a continuation of an eight- and six-year academy or part of a four-year grammar school for elementary school graduates.\n\nFour-year grammar schools are either generally oriented or focus on physical or music education.\n\nThe generally oriented grammar schools can decide on a specialization.\n\nThe subjects are the same as in the second stage of elementary schools but are obligatory only in grade ten and eleven (mathematics also in grade twelve, Czech and two foreign languages until grade thirteen).\n\nSchools can make these subjects obligatory in the last two years of school, or the students can have more elective subjects than the legally required minimum.\n\nGrammar school graduates have no qualification; the aim of this type of school is a preparation for university studies.\n\nGeography\n\nmodern soft contact lenses\n\nwere invented by Otto Wichterle\n\nChristmas\n\nCzech alphabet\n\nCzech Alphabet\n\nThe Czech alphabet consists of 42 letters ut of which 26 are the same as in English, plus 16 additional ones with diacritics. Those are 8 extra vowels (á, é, í, ý, ó, ú/ů, ě) and 8 extra consonants (ž, š, č, ř, ď, ť, ň, plus “ch”). “Ch” in Czech alphabet counts as a single letter and has a special position after “h.” Its pronunciation is different from English.\n\nThe letters Q, W and X are used exclusively in foreign words, and the former two are replaced with Kv and V once the word becomes \"naturalized\"; the digraphs dz and dž are also used mostly for foreign words and do not have a separate place in the alphabet.\n\naábcčdďeéěfghiíjklmnňopqrřsštťuúůvwxyýzž\n\nThe great advantage of the Czech language is that, unlike in English, it is pronounced the same way as it is written.\n\nHowever, in order to pronounce all the sounds that the Czech language contains, additional letters with diacritics (small marks above the letter) are used in combination with the Roman alphabet.\n\nThere are only a few diacritics - háček (hook), čárka (length mark), kroužek(circle) and they change the pronunciation of the letter. They look like this when written: háček (č), čárka (á), kroužek (ů).\n\nPolitical system\n\nAfter overthrowing Communism in 1989, the country set up a parliamentary democracy.\n\nThe parliament consists of two houses; the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. There are 200 people in the Chamber of Deputies, and they serve a 4−year term. The 81 Senate members are elected for 6 years.\n\nThe head of state is the president, and it is he who appoints a prime minister.\n\nThe president is elected every 5 years by popular vote.\n\nThree kings\n\nJanuary 6 is the Feast of the Three Kings. In many Czech and Slovak villages, boys dress up as the three wise men “Kaspar, Balthazar and Melchior”.\n\nWith a piece of chalk the boys write K + B + M (or K + M + B) above the doorways on houses, where people donate money for charity. This brings blessings on that home and its family for a year. The chalk letters should never be cleaned off, but only replaced the next year.\n\nThis is also usually the day the Christmas tree is taken down\n\nBohdan Pomahač\n\nis a Czech plastic surgeon. He led the team that performed the first full-face transplant in the United States and the third overall in the world.\n\nKrkonoše\n\nČeské Budějovice\n\nROYAL CITY AT THE CONFLUENCE OF RIVERS\n\nCity history\n\nKing Ottokar II of Bohemia founded the city of České Budějovice at the confluence of the Malše and Vltava rivers in 1265 České Budějovice.\n\nThe ground plan of the newly developed city was brilliantly surveyed by Burgrave Hirzo of Zvíkov, with a square 133 x 137 meters flanked by a checkerboard grid of streets. Two churches and numerous townhouses were built around the square, including the city hall. The whole city was encircled with walls and fortified towers and three city gates.\n\nImmediately after its founding, České Budějovice became a political and economic capital of South Bohemia and a mainstay of royal power.\n\nKing Charles IV boosted its privileges in the 14th century, and so the city became a center of trade and crafts. Its wealth was further expanded by silver mining and minting in nearby Rudolfov.\n\nThe fortified city stood aside from the Hussite pressure and its economic upswing was only harmed blemished by the Thirty Years’ War and a large fire in the second half of the 17th century. The city renewal continued for decades in the Baroque style and changed its architectural character. A number of ecclesiastic buildings and institutions, such as the bishop’s residence, as well as secular structures were built in the city.\n\nThe industrial advances of the 19th century brought a lot of changes in transport and production. The first horse-drawn railroad car departed from České Budějovice to Linz in 1832, the very first ofits kind on the European continent. The new factories included a pencil works, an enamel works, a tobacco factory, and breweries.\n\nThe twentieth century brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of life. The city has numerous examples of modern 1920s and 1930s architecture. The population grew close to 100 thousand in the late 20th century.\n\nhttps://www.budejce.cz/en/\n\nFollow-up courses\n\nThere is a possibility of takong just a 2 year follow up preparatory course to pass the school leaving exam.\n\nMartina Navrátilová\n\nKarel Čapek\n\nInventor of the word Robot\n\nPetra Kvitová\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjGsEyddl8\n\nCoat of arms\n\nKrušné hory\n\nKrušné hory The Ore Mountains or Ore Mountain Range have formed a natural border between Bohemia and Saxony for around 800 years, from the 12th to the 20th centuries.\n\nToday, the border between the Czech Republic and Germany runs just north of the main crest of the mountain range. The highest peaks are the Klínovec in the Czech Republic (German: Keilberg), which rises to 1,244 metres (4,081 ft) above sea level and the Fichtelberg in Germany (1,215 metres (3,986 ft)). Krišné hory are passing on North to Labské pískovce (Elbe Sandstones).\n\nYou can admire here passes, towers and unique „rock towns“ built by original inhabitants.\n\nThis region belongs to those protected and names National Park of Czech Switzerland. The favourable geological conditions in this area caused that in the old era of Stone Age the bands of mammoth- hunters there were living, and later the farmers colonized the valleys of Ohře and Elbe rivers.\n\nThe area played an important role in contributing Bronze Age ore, and as the setting of the earliest stages of the early modern transformation of mining and metallurgy from a craft to a large-scale industry, a process that preceded and enabled the later Industrial Revolution.\n\nIn 2019 the region became a UNESCO World Heritage site, the following 22 mines or mining complexes were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List as the Erzgebirge/Krušnohoří Mining Region\n\nThe Krušné Mountains are like the Klondike of the Czech Republic. Famed for their silver mines, plus their large deposits of uranium and tin, these peaks were inhabited by tough characters who earned their daily crust extracting precious ores from the bowels of the Earth. When the Sudeten Germans were driven out of the region after WWII, the Krušné Mountains became a kind of no-man’s land. Drawn out hills extend across the landscape and thick woodland, widescreen views and a dense network of trails once again draw people here to get active, visit historical towns in the foothills and take a cure at the local spas.\n\nCastles and chateaux\n\nCASTLES AND CHATEAUX\n\nThere is more than 2000 of castles, castle ruins and chateaux in the Czech Republic. Wherever you are in the Czech Republic, there will be some castle or chateaux nearby.\n\nCASTLES\n\nIconic landmarks of Czech landscape are castles. Often situated on top of the hill, from most of the castles is beautiful view to countryside. Some of those castles are just ruins, but some castles are well-preserved with old interiors, furniture etc. Most picturesque and interesting are for example: Loket Castle, Karlštejn Castle, Kost Castle, Rabí Castle ruin, Český Šternberk Castle, Bezděz Castle, Křivoklát Castle, Bouzov Castle and Pernštejn Castle\n\nCHATEAUX\n\nRenaissance, baroque or neo-classical, possibly every Czech town has its own chateau.\n\nFor example: Konopiště Chateau, Valtice Chateau, Lednice Chateau, Hluboká nad Vltavou Chateau, Kuks Chateau, Chateau, Vranov nad Dyjí Chateau, Chateau, Červená Lhota Chateau, Děčín Chateau and Orlík Chateau.\n\nPetrof\n\nPETROF grand and upright pianos are traditional Czech products from Hradec Králové.\n\nThe path of their development is a never-ending process, which has enabled these instruments to achieve high quality and world renown.\n\nThe research and development department works unstintingly on their perfection, and almost 80% of manufacturing operations are carried out by hand.\n\nSince its founding in 1864, the company has produced more than 626,000 pianos under this famous name.\n\nTheir characteristic rounded, romantic tone is backed up by variability of design and implementation. Due to the skill and expertise of its piano-making experts, the firm can always offer pianos in a number of series, including the time-tested Style Collection, or the innovative Special Collection.\n\nSecondary technical and vocational education with school leaving exam\n\nSecondary technical and vocational education with school-leaving exam, SOŠ, SPŠ\n\nSome vocational schools offer an academic maturita qualification in addition to the vocational certificate allowing progression to university.\n\nThese schools last four years like any other school offering the maturita, and the student must pass both sets of exams to graduate.\n\nWine\n\nWine (víno in Czech) is another popular drink, particularly wine from Moravia in the south-eastern part of the country where the climate is more suited to vineyards. White wines tend to be the best as the growing conditions are more favourable for them. For white wines, try Veltlínské zelené (Green Veltliner), Muškát moravský (Moravian Muscatel), Ryzlink rýnský (Rhine Riesling) or Tramín (Traminer), or red wines such as Frankovka (Blaufrankisch), Modrý Portugal (Blue Portugal, named after the grape, not the country), or Svatovavřinecké (Saint Lawrence). Also try ice wine (ledové víno) made when the grapes are harvested after they have frozen on the vines, or straw wine (slámové víno) made by leaving the grapes to ripen on straw) – these wines are more expensive and are similar to dessert wines. Bohemia Sekt is also popular with Czechs, and is an inexpensive sweet, fizzy wine, similar to Lambrusco, and drunk at celebrations. The best places for wine are either a wine bar (vinárna), or a wine shop (vinotéka) which sometimes has a small bar area too.\n\nWine region\n\nThe region is famous for its wine production.\n\nMikulov and its surroundings is a traditional wine centre. The geographical position, the climate and the varied soil of the Mikulov wine region with the limestone slopes of the Pálava Hills affect the unique character of the local wine.\n\nThis was already discovered by Ancient Romans, who considered the Pálava region ideal for vine growing.\n\nThe major wine centres of the Mikulov wine region include Mikulov in the first place, and further Valtice, Dolní Dunajovice, Novosedly, Perná, Sedlec, Pavlov, Dolní Věstonice, Horní Věstonice and Brod nad Dyjí.\n\nThe area provides 94% of the Czech Republic's vineyards.\n\nWine and vineyards\n\nWINE\n\nWine (víno in Czech) is another popular drink, particularly wine from Moravia in the south-eastern part of the country where the climate is more suited to vineyards. White wines tend to be the best as the growing conditions are more favourable for them. For white wines, try Veltlínské zelené (Green Veltliner), Muškát moravský (Moravian Muscatel), Ryzlink rýnský (Rhine Riesling) or Tramín (Traminer), or red wines such as Frankovka (Blaufrankisch), Modrý Portugal (Blue Portugal, named after the grape, not the country), or Svatovavřinecké (Saint Lawrence).

The best places for wine are either a wine bar (vinárna), or a wine shop (vinotéka) which sometimes has a small bar area too.\n\nDrinks\n\nBeer\n\nTher first pilsner type of pale lager beer.\n\nBeer? Yes, please!\n\nThe Czech Republic is the country where modern beer (pivo in Czech) was invented (in Plzeň). Czechs are the heaviest beer drinkers in the world, drinking about 160 litres of it per capita per year. Going to a cosy Czech pub for dinner and a few beers is a must!\n\nThe best-known export brands are Pilsner Urquell (Plzeňský Prazdroj), Budweiser Budvar (Budějovický Budvar) and Staropramen (freely translatable as 'Oldspring'). Other major brands which are popular domestically include Gambrinus, Kozel, Bernard (a small traditional brewery, with very high quality beer), Radegast, and Starobrno (made in Brno, the capital of Moravia).\n\nOther fantastic beers worth tasting are Svijany and Dobřanská Hvězda.\n\nAlthough many Czechs tend to be very selective about beer brands, tourists usually don't find a significant difference. And remember, real Czech beer is only served on tap – bottled beer is a completely different experience.\n\nHigh-quality beer can almost certainly be found in a hospoda or hostinec, very basic pubs which serve only beer and light snacks. Take a seat and order your drinks when the waiter comes to you - going to the bar to order your drinks is a British custom! But beware, the handling of the beer is even more important than its brand.\n\nA bad bartender can completely ruin even excellent beer. Best bet is to ask local beer connoiseurs about a good pub or just join them.\n\nBeers are sometimes listed by their original sugar content, which is measured in degrees Plato (P/°). The difference is generally apparent in the final alcohol content. Normal beer is about 10° (such as Gambrinus and Staropramen, which results in 4% ABV), lager 12° (such as Pilsner Urquell, which results in about 4.75% ABV).\n\nThe latter is stronger and more expensive, so you should specify which one you want when you order.\n\nCzech lager is nothing like the fizzy lagers found in many other countries. Instead, it has a very strong, hoppy, almost bitter flavour, and goes very well with heavy dishes like duck or pork and dumplings or strong cheeses.\n\nIt always has a thick head on the top when it is served, but do not be afraid to drink 'through' it, it is fun and it slowly disappears anyway, nevertheless do not drink the beer too slowly as the fresh cold taste (especially in hot summers) quickly fades – the 'true' Czech connoisseurs do not even finish this 'tepid goat,' as they call it.\n\nThe right beer bought in shops is only in half-litre brown glass bottles with sheet-crown cap. Experienced earthy beer drinkers drink it directly from the bottle. Some breweries distribute also big (two-litre or 1.5 litre) plastic bottles but they are considered a bit barbarian and degraded by Czechs, and the better breweries ridicule such form. Also sheet-can beer is perceived as an alien.\n\nSoups\n\nCzech cuisine knows many different kinds of soup (polévka).\n\nThe most common are bramboračka - potato soup (sometimes with forest mushrooms), hovězí vývar - clear beef soup (sometimes s játrovými knedlíčky - with liver dumplings), gulášovka - thick goulash soup, zelňačka - thick and sour cabbage soup, česnečka (strong garlic soup, very healthy and tasty, but do not eat this before kissing), kulajda - thick soup with forest mushrooms and milk, hrášková polévka from young green peas, čočková polévka from lentils, fazolačka from beans, rajská polévka - tomato soup, and many others.\n\nA special case not to everyone's tastes is dršťková polévka (tripe soup). Rybí polévka - thick fish soup made from carps (including its head, some innards, roe and sperm) is the traditional soup of the Christmas Dinne\n\nMusic\n\nCharles IV.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe reign of Charles IV was characterized by a transformation in the nature of the Empire and is remembered as the Golden Age of Bohemia. He promulgated the Golden Bull of 1356 whereby the succession to the imperial title was laid down, which held for the next four centuries.\n\nHe also founded the first university north of the Alps in 1348 in Prague.Charles_University\n\nHe also organized the states of the empire into peace-keeping confederations. In these, the Imperial cities figured prominently. The Swabian Landfriede confederation of 1370 was made up almost entirely of Imperial Cities. At the same time, the leagues were organized and led by the crown and its agents. As with the electors, the cities that served in these leagues were given privileges to aid in their efforts to keep the peace.\n\nHe assured his dominance over the eastern borders of the Empire through succession treaties with the Habsburgs and the purchase of Brandenburg. He also claimed imperial lordship over the crusader states of Prussia and Livonia.\n\nMarriages and children\n\nCharles and his first wife, Blanche\n\nCharles was married four times. His first wife was Blanche of Valois (1316–1348), daughter of Charles, Count of Valois, and a half-sister of Philip VI of France.They had three children:\n\nson (b. 1334), died young\n\nMargaret of Bohemia (1335–1349); married Louis I of Hungary.Catherine of Bohemia (1342–1395); married Rudolf IV of Austria and Otto V, Duke of Bavaria, Elector of Brandenburg.\n\nHe secondly married Anna of Bavaria, (1329–1353), daughter of Rudolf II, Duke of Bavaria; they had one son:\n\nWenceslaus (1350–1351).\n\nHis third wife was Anna von Schweidnitz, (1339–1362),daughter of Henry II, Duke of Świdnica and Katharina of Anjou (daughter of Charles I Robert, King of Hungary), by whom he had three children:\n\nElisabeth of Bohemia (19 April 1358 – 4 September 1373); married Albert III of Austria.Wenceslaus (1361–1419); later elected King of Germany (formally King of the Romans) and, on his father's death, became King of Bohemia (as Wenceslaus IV) and Emperor-elect of the Holy Roman Empire; married firstly to Joanna of Bavaria in 1370 and secondly to Sophia of Bavaria in 1389.\n\nson (born and died 11 July 1362).\n\nHis fourth wife was Elizabeth of Pomerania, (1345 or 1347 – 1393), daughter of Duke Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania and Elisabeth of Poland, daughter of Casimir III of Poland. They had six children:\n\nAnne of Bohemia (1366–1394); married Richard II of EnglandSigismund (1368–1437); later Holy Roman Emperor, King of Hungary and Bohemia, and Margrave of Brandenburg; married firstly Mary of Hungary in 1385, and secondly to Barbara of Cilli in 1405/1408.John of Görlitz (1370–1396); later Margrave of Moravia and Duke of Görlitz; married Richardis Catherine of Sweden. His only daughter and heiress was Duchess of Luxembourg.\n\nCharles (13 March 1372 – 24 July 1373).\n\nMargaret of Bohemia (1373–1410); married John III, Burgrave of Nuremberg.\n\nHenry (1377–1378)\n\nPlaces named after Charles IV\n\nOther places named after Charles:\n\nKarlštejn castle, Czech Republic\n\nKarlštejn (town), Czech Republic\n\nCharles Bridge, Prague (Karlův most)\n\nCharles University, Prague (Karlova Universita)\n\nKarlovy Vary spa, Czech Republic\n\nCharles Square, Prague (Karlovo náměstí)\n\nMontecarlo (Charles' Mountain) fort and village in Italy\n\n16951 Carolus Quartus (an asteroid)\n\nBaťa\n\nBata Shoes is actually a family-owned global footwear and fashion accessory brand. T\n\nheir headquarters are located in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nThe Bata Shoe Company was founded in 1894 in Zlín, Moravia by Tomáš Baťa, his brother Antonín and his sister Anna, whose family had been cobblers for generations.\n\nan eight-year academy\n\nGrade levels in the eight-year academy are usually called by Latin numbers; year one is prima (the first in Latin), year two is sekunda, and so on\n\nSpirits\n\nSPIRITS\n\nFor spirits, try Becherovka (herb liqueur, similar to Jägermeister, tastes of a mixtures of cloves and cinnamon, and drunk as a digestive),\n\nslivovice (plum brandy, very popular as a pick-me-up), hruškovice (pear brandy, less fiery than Slivovice), and so on.\n\nSpirits are made out of almost every kind of fruit (Plums, Peaches, Cherries, Sloes, etc.).\n\nCzech unique tuzemský rum (made from sugar beet, not from sugar cane as the Cuban rum, sold under brands like Tuzemák to conform with EU market rules). Be careful as all are about 40% alcohol.\n\nMilan Kundera\n\nOthers\n\nTry also svařák, hot mulled wine served in all pubs, and outdoors at Christmas markets.\n\ngrog, hot rum and water served with a slice of lemon - add sugar to taste, and medovina, mead, again usually served hot, and particularly good for warming up at a cold winter market.\n\nFinally, if you are heading into Moravia, try burčák, a speciality found only around the end of the summer, or early autumn. It is extremely young wine, usually white, and is the cloudy, still fermenting stage in wine production when the wine is very sweet, and very smooth to drink. It continues to ferment in the stomach, so the alcohol content at the time of drinking it is unknown, but it is usually high, creeps up on you, and it is very moreish.\n\nCzechs say that it should only be drunk fresh from the vineyard, and many small private wine makers are passionate about it, waiting up into the night for the moment when the wine reaches the 'burčák' stage. You can see it at wine festivals around the country, and sometimes in markets or wine bars too.\n\nVepřo-knedlo-zelo\n\nvepřo knedlo zelo is basically roasted pork with dumplings and a side of pickled cabbage.\n\nTatra Kopřivnice\n\nAlphonse Mucha\n\nAlfons Maria Mucha ( 24 July 1860 – 14 July 1939), known internationally as Alphonse Mucha, was a Czech painter, illustrator and graphic artist, living in Paris during the Art Nouveau period, best known for his distinctly stylized and decorative theatrical posters, particularly those of Sarah Bernhardt.\n\nHe produced illustrations, advertisements, decorative panels, and designs, which became among the best-known images of the period.\n\nIn the second part of his career, at the age of 43, he returned to his homeland of Bohemia-Moravia region in Austria and devoted himself to painting a series of twenty monumental canvases known as The Slav Epic, depicting the history of all the Slavic peoples of the world, which he painted between 1912 and 1926.\n\nIn 1928, on the 10th anniversary of the independence of Czechoslovakia, he presented the series to the Czech nation. He considered it his most important work. It is now on display in Prague.\n\nFamous inventions\n\nNon-alcoholic\n\nfruit sparkling waters (as well as coke waters) are named limonáda in Bohemia or sodovka in Moravia.\n\nDraught 'limonades' of various types used to be a very cheap and available beverage in common pubs in rural and hiking areas. Now, more expensive 'Cola-Fanta-Sprite' choice or draught or bottle Kofola are available usually.\n\nKofola, a coke-like drink is also very popular, and some Czechs say it is the best thing the communists gave them.\n\nMineral waters are popular, but tend to have a strong mineral taste. Try Mattoni, or Magnesia, both of which taste like normal water and still claim to be good for your health.\n\nIf you want bubbles, ask for perlivá. If you want it non-carbonated, ask for neperlivá. These come also with a lot of flavours and can be bought in 1,5 l bottles.\n\nSometimes you can see jemně perlivá – it is 'lightly bubbled' water. Many restaurants don't make any difference between 'sparkling water' and 'sparkling mineral water'.\n\nSparkling water (without flavour) is traditionally named sodovka (sodová voda, soda water) in Bohemia and sifon in Moravia.\n\nSecond stage, 10-15\n\nThe next four years of elementary school form the second stage, the last compulsory stage in education.\n\nSubjects taught at this stage include Czech, literature, two foreign languages, mathematics, computer science, history, geography, civics, physics, biology, chemistry, music, art, physical education, and handcrafts.\n\nSome of these subjects are only mandatory in grades eight and nine.\n\nPilsner Urquel\n\nknown in English as the Pilsner Urquell Brewery, is a Czech brewery opened in 1842 and headquartered in Plzeň, Czech Republic. It was the first brewery to produce pale lager, branded as Pilsner Urquell;[2] the popularity of Pilsner Urquell resulting in it being much copied so that more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today is pale lager, sometimes named pils, pilsner and pilsener after Pilsner Urquell.\n\nThe brewery name, Pilsner Urquell, which can be roughly translated into English as \"the original source at Pilsen\", was adopted as a trademark in 1898. Pilsner Urquell is the largest beer producer in Czechia and is also the largest exporter of beer abroad.\n\nFilms\n\nten-films-that-perfectly-explain-life-in-the-czech-republic/\n\nCinema_of_the_Czech_Republic\n\nCzech Film in the Past and Present\n\nThe Beginning\n\nThe history of Czech cinema has its roots in the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nA feature film was shot in Bohemia in 1896. The Czech movie industry, already influenced by Hollywood, flourished after World War I. Extasy (Extase, 1933) directed by Gustav Machatý, and River (Řeka, 1933) directed by Josef Rovenský were the first Czechoslovak movies that had success reaching an audience abroad.\n\nThe Barrandov Studios, founded by Miloš and Václav Havel (the father of former president Václav Havel), were completed in 1933. It did not take long for the studios to ramp up production to 80 films a year.\n\nThe Golden Age of the 1960s\n\nThe golden age of Czechoslovak film took place in the 1960s, during the era of increased political and cultural freedom.\n\nThe top directors of the time included Miloš Forman, Jiří Menzel, Ján Kadár, Elmar Klos, Vojtěch Jasný, Jan Němec, Věra Chytilová, and Ivan Passer.\n\nMost of them studied at Prague's Film and Television School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU), one of the oldest film schools in Europe. Kadár and Klos's The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965) and Menzel's Closely Watched Trains (Ostře sledované vlaky, 1966) both won Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nThe Soviet invasion in August 1968 brought the era to an end.\n\nPost-Communist Era\n\nThe Czech movie industry changed dramatically after the Velvet Revolution and the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nBarrandov Studios were privatized and were no longer guaranteed productions and funds from the government. Foreign film studios discovered the Czech Republic and the dramatic increase in foreign productions more than made up for the decrease in local films.\n\nThe Czech Republic became an attractive location for foreign film makers thanks to its historical beauty and well preserved architecture that was not damaged in the world wars.\n\nLower filming costs, coupled with the long history of the Czech film industry and the resulting expertise of local crews are also a factor. To support the growing number of foreign film projects, local production companies as well as companies providing casting, lighting, editing, and special effects services have been established - most of them in Prague.\n\nThe 1990s saw the rise of a new generation of Czech film makers, including Jan Svěrák, Jan Hřebejk, Saša Gedeon, Petr Zelenka, and David Ondříček. Svěrák's Elementary School (Obecná škola, 1991) was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, and his movie Kolya (Kolja, 1996) won it. Hřebejk's Divided We Fall (Musíme si pomáhat, 2000) also received an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe Future of Czech Film\n\nThere are still questions about the future direction of Czech cinematography. Raising funds for Czech movies is as challenging as ever. Many directors need to earn their living by making commercials.\n\nFinding foreign distribution for Czech films remains difficult.\n\nThe Czech Republic however, will continue to develop new film talent through FAMU and the overall movie industry will keep gaining expertise through the foreign productions that have been flocking to the country.\n\nBecherovka\n\nBECHER FAMILY\n\nThe conception of Becherovka begins with the insight of a skilled businessman, Josef Vitus Becher (1769-1840). Besides his business with seasoing and colonial goods at his shop called at Three woodlarks', he had a special interest in crafting spirits. In 1794 he rented a wine distillery and started to experiment with liquers. Following in the legacy of his family, he also worked in the field of the public affairs, as boht a counselor and mayor. Josef was married twice, his first wife dying of pneumonia, and had sixteen children collectively. Only 5 daughters and 2 sons lived longer than he did. Josef's business practice was taken over by Johann (Jan) Nepomuk Becher in 1838.\n\n1805\n\nENGLISH BITTER\n\nPrince Maximilian Friedrich von Plettenberg came to Carlsbad in 1805 to be cured of an ailment. He was accompanied by his personal doctor, Dr. Christian Frobrig, hailing from England. Dr. Frobrig was a frequent visitor at Jan Becher's. They frequently met to discuss herbs, and their many healing powers. When Dr. Frobrig left, he gave Jan Becher the gift of a new, revolutionary liqueur recipe. Jan Becher tested this very same recipe many times over the course of two years before he began selling it in 1807 as \"English Bitter,\" aimed to cure stomach illness.\n\nhttps://becherovka.com/en/history\n\nBlack Tower\n\nEveryone who visits České Budějovice should not miss a tour of this striking dominant feature of the city – the Black Tower.\n\nIts construction in 1550-1577 was supposed to reflect the city’s economic upswing.\n\nLed by Italian master builders, it rose to then unprecedented height of 72.25 meters. The tower doubled as a belfry and watchtower, continuously guarding the city of České Budějovice from the risk of fire.\n\nBrno\n\nBrno is a city in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. Located at the confluence of the Svitava and Svratka rivers, Brno has about 380,000 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the Czech Republic after the main capital, Prague, and one of the 100 largest cities of the EU. The Brno metropolitan area has more than 600,000 inhabitants.\n\nBrno is the former capital city of Moravia and the political and cultural hub of the South Moravian Region.\n\nIt is the centre of the Czech judiciary, with the seats of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, and the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, and a number of state authorities, including the Ombudsman, and the Office for the Protection of Competition. Brno is also an important centre of higher education, with 33 faculties belonging to 13 institutes of higher education and about 89,000 students.\n\nBrno Exhibition Centre ranks among the largest exhibition centres in Europe. The complex opened in 1928 and established the tradition of large exhibitions and trade fairs held in Brno.\n\nBrno hosts motorbike and other races on the Masaryk Circuit, a tradition established in 1930, in which the Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious races. Another cultural tradition is an international fireworks competition, Ignis Brunensis, that attracts tens of thousands of daily visitors.\n\nThe most visited sights of the city include the Špilberk castle and fortress and the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul on Petrov hill, two medieval buildings that dominate the cityscape and are often depicted as its traditional symbols. The other large preserved castle near the city is Veveří Castle by Brno Reservoir.\n\nAnother architectural monument of Brno is the functionalist Villa Tugendhat which has been included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites. One of the natural sights nearby is the Moravian Karst. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network and has been designated as a \"City of Music\" in 2017\n\nKarlovy Vary\n\nKarlovy Vary is a spa city in the Karlovy Vary Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 48,000 inhabitants. It lies on the confluence of the rivers Ohře and Teplá, approximately 130 km (81 mi) west of Prague.\n\nIt is named after Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the King of Bohemia, who founded the city in 1370.\n\nIt is the site of numerous hot springs (13 main springs, about 300 smaller springs, and the warm-water Teplá River), and is the most visited spa town in the Czech Republic.\n\nUntil 1945, when the German-speaking inhabitants were expelled, the city was overwhelmingly German-speaking.\n\nPropeller\n\nJosef Ressel made history with the invention of the propeller, resp. its most convenient location on the ship.\n\nAlthough a forester by profession, Josef Ressel became one of the leading pioneers of the new ship propulsion, which replaced the wheel mechanism, which is especially unsuitable for sailing at sea.\n\nKarlovy Vary International Film Festival\n\nThe Karlovy Vary International Film Festival ) is a film festival held annually in July in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary Festival is one of the oldest in the world and has become Central and Eastern Europe's leading film event.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary IFF first held an international film competition in 1948. Since 1951, an international jury has evaluated the films.\n\nThe Karlovy Vary competition quickly found a place among other developing festivals and by 1956 FIAPF had already classified Karlovy Vary as a category A festival.\n\nCrystal Globe (Czech: Křišťálový glóbus) is the main award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, first given in the Czech Republic city of Karlovy Vary in 1948.\n\nIFFKV presents the following awards in the international film competition,:[1]\n\nOfficial selection awards\n\nGrand Prix - Crystal Globe for best feature film\n\nSpecial Jury PrizeBest Director AwardBest Actress AwardBest Actor Award\n\nOther awards\n\nEast of the West Award\n\nGrand Prix for Best Documentary Film (For films over 30 minutes in length, and one for under 30 minutes)\n\nFestival President’s Award\n\nPrávo Audience Award\n\nNon-statutory awards\n\nClimate\n\nThe Czech Republic's climate is temperate, transitional between an oceanic climate and a continental climate.\n\nThe summers are rather cool and dry, with average temperatures in most areas around 20 °C, the winters are fairly mild and wet with temperatures averaging around 0 °C in most areas. The relative humidity moves between 60–80 %.\n\nRecords in the Czech Republic\n\nHighest measured temperature: 40.4 ° C (20.8. 2012, Dobřichovice)\n\nLowest measured temperature: -42.2 ° C (Feb. 11, 1929, Litvínovice)\n\nHighest average annual rainfall: 1,705 mm (Jizera Mountains)\n\nLowest average annual precipitation: 410 mm (Žatec)\n\nStrongest wind gust: 216 km / h (19. 1. 2007, Sněžka)\n\nFirst stage, 6-9\n\nThe first stage covers the first five years of formal education. Classes are taught by a single teacher, although there is sometimes a separate foreign language or physical education teacher.\n\nThe subjects taught are Czech and include one foreign language (usually English), mathematics, computer science, history, geography, science, art, music, physical education, and handcrafts.\n\nThere is usually a first stage school in every village; in small villages, several grades may be taught in one class.\n\nFamous Czech people\n\nSemtex\n\nOriginally developed for Czechoslovak military use and export, Semtex eventually became popular with paramilitary groups and rebels or terrorists because prior to 2000 it was extremely difficult to detect.\n\nPřemysla Otakara II Square\n\nPřemysl Otakar II Square is famous for its regular square shape and an area of more than a hectare.\n\nThis makes it one of the largest square town squares in the Czech Republic. It is named for the founder of the town, King Ottokar II of Bohemia, in 1265.\n\nThe square was marked out at the founding of the town. It is made even more interesting by the 48 Baroque and Renaissance townhouses with arcades along its perimeter.\n\nAll the houses, except the Town Hall, used to belong to the wealthiest burghers and nobility. They still stand on their medieval plots and have Gothic cores for the most part.\n\nTheir present-day appearance dates to the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Since the founding of the town, the square has served as the primary landmark, a place for markets, secular and religious festivals, and executions.\n\nThe exact location of the execution place can still be determined in the square by the so-called Lost Rock, the only remainder of the original pavement. It is a few steps from Samson Fountain (where the pillory used to stand).\n\nCulture\n\nIndustry\n\nIn a shop\n\nThere is a planty of varieties of Czech original sweets you can buy on daily basis in the shops:\n\nBuscuits and candies typical for the Crechs are:\n\nPublic holidays\n\nDateEnglish NameCzech NameRemarks1 JanuaryNew Year's DayDen obnovy samostatného českého státu; Nový rokCzechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.March, AprilGood FridayVelký pátekGood Friday is public holiday since 2016.March, AprilEaster MondayVelikonoční pondělí1 MayLabour DaySvátek práce8 MayLiberation DayDen vítězství or Den osvobození1945, the end of the European part of World War II5 JulySaints Cyril and Methodius DayDen slovanských věrozvěstů Cyrila a MetodějeIn 863, Church teachers St. Cyril (Constantine) and Metoděj (Methodius) came from the Balkans to Great Moravia to propagate Christian faith and literacy.6 JulyJan Hus DayDen upálení mistra Jana HusaThe religious reformer Jan Hus was burned at the stake in 1415.28 SeptemberCzech Statehood Day [cs]Den české státnostiIn 935, St. Wenceslas, Duke of Bohemia, now patron of the Czech State, was murdered by his brother.28 OctoberCzech Independence DayDen vzniku samostatného československého státuIndependence Day and Creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.17 NovemberStruggle for Freedom and Democracy DayDen boje za svobodu a demokraciiCommemorating the student demonstration against Nazi occupation in 1939, and the demonstration in 1989 that started the Velvet Revolution.24 DecemberChristmas EveŠtědrý denChristmas is celebrated during the evening of the 24th.25 DecemberChristmas Day1. svátek vánoční26 DecemberSt. Stephen's Day (Czech: \"The Second Christmas Day\")2. svátek vánoční\n\nCzech fashion models\n\nSweets\n\nCzechs like sweets but consumer patterns are different compared to France, USA or the UK.\n\nAs everywhere some traditional treats have become a mass-market production for tourists, others are pretty difficult to find.\n\nCharles Bridge\n\nCharles Bridge is a medieval stone arch bridge that crosses the Vltava (Moldau) river.\n\nIts construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the early 15th century. The bridge replaced the old Judith Bridge built 1158–1172 that had been badly damaged by a flood in 1342. This new bridge was originally called Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or Prague Bridge (Pražský most), but has been referred to as \"Charles Bridge\" since 1870.\n\nAs the only means of crossing the river Vltava until 1841, Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This land connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, the bridge is 516 metres (1,693 ft) long and nearly 10 metres (33 ft) wide, following the example of the Stone Bridge in Regensburg, it was built as a bow bridge with 16 arches shielded by ice guards.\n\nIt is protected by three bridge towers, two on the Lesser Quarter side (including the Malá Strana Bridge Tower) and one on the Old Town side, the Old Town Bridge Tower. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700, but now all have been replaced by replicas.\n\nThe avenue of 30 mostly baroque statues and statuaries situated on the balustrade forms a unique connection of artistic styles with the underlying gothic bridge. Most sculptures were erected between 1683 and 1714.\n\nThey depict various saints and patron saints venerated at that time. The most prominent Bohemian sculptors of the time took part in decorating the bridge, such as Matthias Braun, Jan Brokoff, and his sons Michael Joseph and Ferdinand Maxmilian.\n\nAmong the most notable sculptures, one can find the statuaries of St. Luthgard, the Holy Crucifix and Calvary, and John of Nepomuk. Well known also is the statue of the knight Bruncvík, although it was erected some 200 years later and does not belong to the main avenue.\n\nBeginning in 1965, all of the statues have been systematically replaced by replicas, and the originals have been exhibited in the Lapidarium of the National Museum.\n\nJetSurf\n\nJetSurf\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOC1mIvxgE8&feature=emb_logo\n\nIng. Martin Šula, a graduate of Brno University of Technology, wanted to be a designer and develop engines from childhood.\n\nHe worked in the development of BMW, KTM and Formula 1 until he finally combined his passion for internal combustion engines with a love of skiing and produced the JetSurf. Motor surfboard made of carbon, with a special racing engine, reaching speeds of up to 60km / h, controlled only by tilting the body.\n\nThe board was so different that Šula had to come up with a new sport, a motosurf, and a race for him - the Motosurf World Cup.\n\nBecause Jet Surfy is a revolutionary innovation in motorsport, they are quickly gaining in popularity.\n\nNo wonder surfing, which does not need waves or wind is an amazing relaxation, sport, experience.\n\nThe board is 180 cm long, 60 cm wide and 15 cm high, which with a weight of only 15 kg and fuel means that the Jetsurf is literally the only motorsport where you take your machine in a bag on your back and for the price of a regular ticket you can ride in incredible places worldwide.\n\nSport\n\nZetor\n\nZetor (since January 1, 2007, officially Zetor Tractors a.s.) is a brand of tractors, trademark and Czech manufacturer based in Brno, Líšeň. Since June 29, 2002, the only shareholder is a Slovak Company HTC Holding. The company manufactures farming tractors and tractor components (engines or transmissions).\n\nZetor is the world's first manufacturer to develop and launch production of tractor safety cabins. In the 70-year-long history, Zetor has sold over 1.3 million tractors. Currently, Zetor portfolio includes six model ranges with power from 40 to 160 hp.\n\nAbroad, Zetor is represented through seven affiliations in North America, the UK, France, Germany, Poland, Slovakia and India. In 2015, 86% of the total production of the company headed to foreign countries. In addition to traditional markets such as Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Germany, also to the UK, France, Ireland and Lithuania\n\nKutná Hora\n\nAnother Gothic jewel is the monumental St. Barbara's Church of Kutná Hora, a part of UNESCO cultural heritage.\n\nSt. Barbara is a patron of miners, which is particularly appropriate in Kutná Hora, which gained its wealth and fame in the Middle Ages due to rich silver mines.\n\nOssuary Kutná Hora - Sedlec\n\nThe kostnice (ossuary) is an underground chapel of All Saints Cemetery and originally was a part of the Cistercian abbey in Sedlec, which was founded in 1142 by Miroslav of Markvartic.\n\nThe church was built in the 14th century as a carnery. It consists of two chapels being built one on top of the other and according to the most recent surveys, this was built alongside other outside buildings that made up the entire abbey, as they tried to draw closer to its Jerusalem inspired design.\n\nMEMENTO MORI – „Remember the death “– associated with the Christian Hope of Resurrection remains a valid message for each visitor of this unique place and helps us to understand the symbolism of the place and its decoration. It is not a celebration of death, but it symbolizes the equality of people in front of the throne of God.\n\nTea and Coffee\n\nCoffee and tea are among the most popular choices when it comes to breakfast drinks in the Czech Republic.\n\nStudies have found that most Czechs like to begin their day with a cup of hot tea (usually flavored with either sugar or honey and possibly lemon) or a cup of coffee.\n\nCoffee is only slightly less popular than tea, with the most popular variety being the Czech specialty known as turecká káva (English: Turkish coffee). Turecká káva is a Czech version of coffee which is prepared by pouring boiling water over finely ground coffee beans.\n\nWithin the Czech Republic, about 80% of the coffee is prepared this way in about 90% of the homes, making it the most popular choice.\n\nSide dish\n\nKnedlíky (usually translated as dumplings)\n\ncome in many different kinds. Most kinds are used as side-dish, however some kinds with filling are used as dish by itself.\n\nThe most common type, always used as side-dish, are houskové knedlíky (bread dumplings).\n\nThese are cooked in a shape of a cylinder, which is then cut into round slices about 8 cm in diameter remotely resembling white bread. Houskové knedlíky are served with Czech classics such as guláš, similar to Hungarian goulash but with a thinner sauce and less spicy; Svíčková na smetaně, beef sirloin with a creamy root vegetable (carrot, celeriac, parsnip) sauce, served with a tablespoon of cranberry sauce, a slice of orange and whipped cream; Vepřová pečeně se zelím a knedlíkem locally named as Vepřo-knedlo-zelo, the combination of roast pork, knedlíky and sauerkraut\n\nAnother common kind is bramborové knedlíky (potato dumplings), the slices are smaller, more yellow in color, and are also always served as a side-dish. A typical combination is roasted meet (pork or lamb for example) with spinach.\n\nPotatoe salad\n\nImportant part of most main courses is side-dish (the whole dish including the side-dish is served on one plate) - usually cooked or baked potatoes, fries, rice, pasta or the most typical side-dish of the Czech cuisine - knedlíky.\n\nJohann Gregor Mendel\n\nMendel's laws of inheritance\n\nHe formulated the basic laws of heredity in 1866 on the basis of analyzes of genetic crossing between bred strains (providing offspring with the same traits as the parents) of field pea (Pisum sativum), differing in a well-defined trait such as seed shape (round or square) , color of seeds (yellow or green) or color of flowers (purple or white).\n\nAlmost all of Mendel's contemporaries ignored his theory of inheritance. This was partly because he used probability theory in his calculations, which was a completely unknown field to most biologists at the time.\n\nIn 1900, when Mendel's work was rediscovered, its principles turned out to explain heredity in plants and animals.\n\nFootball\n\nFootball has been a popular sport amongst the locals. Previously the old Czechoslovakia team were a force to be reckoned with, finishing runners-up twice in the World Cup and winning UEFA Euro 1976. The sport gained even more support when the national team qualified for their first World Cup since the break-up of Czechoslovakia. More recently players such as Petr Čech, Tomáš Rosický and Pavel Nedvěd have gone on to achieve great success at top European clubs and have become national icons.\n\nIn domestic football, the Czech First League is the top-level in the Czech football league system. The most successful clubs are the two capital-based sides Sparta Prague and Slavia Prague. For a long time, Sparta Prague has supplied the national team with players such as Libor Sionko, Jaromír Blažek, Zdeněk Grygera, and Tomáš Rosický.\n\nSparta Prague has been a regular participant in the UEFA Champions League, and recently also joined FC Viktoria Plzeň and Slavia Prague.\n\nPardubice\n\nIt has about 92,000 inhabitants. It is the capital city of the Pardubice Region and lies on the river Elbe, 96 kilometres (60 mi) east of Prague. The historic centre of Pardubice is well preserved and historically significant and is protected by law as urban monument reservation.\n\nFactories include the Synthesia chemical factory, an oil refinery Paramo, a heavy machinery factory and an electronic equipment plant. The city is well known for its sport events, which include the Great Pardubice Steeplechase in horse racing, the Golden Helmet of Pardubice in motorcycle racing, and the Czech Open in golf and chess\n\nVelká pardubická is a famous cross-country steeplechase run in Pardubice, Czech Republic since 1874. It takes place every year on the second Sunday in October.\n\nThe length of the steeplechase is 6.9 km (4 miles 506 yards), with 31 obstacles. It usually takes 9–10 minutes to finish the course; the record is 8:56.01 set by Ribelino in 2015.\n\nHorses starting in the race must be at least six years old (before 2009, the minimum age was seven years); Czech horses must qualify by finishing at least one of four qualifying races during the season.\n\nSpecial and Practical Schools\n\nSpecial schools for developmentally disabled children unable to participate in mainstream elementary education were once common in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe subjects taught were very limited, meaning that leavers were logistically unable to continue on to all types of secondary education.\n\nA student required a reference from an educational psychologist and the agreement of parents to enroll in a special school.\n\nSpecial schools were replaced by elementary and practical schools, though the problem of the over-representation of Romani pupils continues. There are elementary practical schools usually taught in the same institution.\n\nThese teach the equivalent of the first and second stages and one- to two-year secondary courses after the age of fifteen.\n\nThe education is mainly practical to teach students to be self-sufficient. Meanwhile, \"integrated education\" of under-performing or mentally handicapped children in ordinary schools with the support of a special teacher is becoming more common.\n\nConservatoire (art education)\n\nBasic professional training of musicians is provided by the conservatoires in the Czech Republic, where students at the age of fourteen start attending a 6-year programme (pre-college education).\n\nAt present, there are fourteen public conservatoires, one private conservatoire and three church conservatoires in the Czech Republic.\n\nTheir graduates are qualified to teach at Music Schools (Basic Schools of Art) and their training is usually sufficient to be accepted in one of the symphony orchestras.\n\nThe Jaroslav Ježek Conservatoire in Prague offers education in popular music, jazz and musical drama.\n\nThe needs of the church are covered by the church secondary school for organ players and by the church conservatoire in Kromĕříž, Opava and Olomouc.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, conservatoires are not considered as higher music education institutions (but a secondary level, pre-college educational institutions).\n\ndance conservatoire\n\nŠumava\n\nThe Bohemian Forest, known in Czech as Šumava and in German as Böhmerwald, is a low mountain range in Central Europe.\n\n.Šumava, also the \"Bohemian Forest\" or \"Böhmerwald\", is a mountain range in Central Europe. It extends from the Czech Republic to Austria and Germany.Šumava National Park is a great place for hiking, cycling, cross-country skiing and generally spending time in beautiful, unspoiled nature.\n\nNP Šumava\n\nŠumava represents\n\n68,460 ha of genuine nature\n\nhundreds of kilometres of bicycle routes\n\ndozens of interesting trips\n\n7 emergency night shelters33 trips into the wild8 glacial lakes\n\n274 programmes for the public3 dozen nature trailsan infinite number of adventures\n\n3 dozen nature trails\n\ninfinity of experiences\n\nThe Ride of the Kings\n\nThe Ride of the Kings is celebrated in Spring, at the Pentecost, in Moravia, the south-east of the Czech Republic.\n\nIt takes place in the region historically known as Moravian Slovakia.\n\nIt is celebrated annually in the village of Vlčnov (pop.3,000), every three years in Hluk (pop.4,400), every two years in Kunovice (pop.5,500), and occasionally in Skoronice (pop.550) as part of another festival called the “Slovácký rok” (Slovak Year).\n\nUntil World War II, the Ride was an integral part of the Feast of Pentecost, but has since become largely a social event.\n\nThe ceremony begins with a religious service and the approval of the Mayor, followed by the preparation of the costumes and decorations for the horses and riders.\n\nThese are made by the women of the villages, according to traditional colors and designs unique to each place.\n\nThe habit has its roots in the pagan age, when the boys competed among themselves in the expulsion of cattle. The best was crowned the king.\n\nOthers see their roots in the escape of Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus from George of Podebrady. In order not to reveal his appearance and speech, he dressed in a woman’s costume and put a rose in his mouth.\n\nHigher professional schools, VOŠ\n\nHigher professional schools (vyšší odborná škola, VOŠ) offer professional tertiary education and are usually connected with professional high schools.\n\nBefore their graduation, students must take final exams (absolutorium) and write a final thesis.\n\nGraduates are entitled to use the honorific \"DiS.\" (diplomovaný specialista, specialist with diploma) after their name.\n\nOLD TOWN ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK (ORLOJ)\n\nAccording to some explorers it is possible to notice that the astronomical clock is divided into four imaginary storeys. The ancient alchemists and astrologers believed that the Universe was composed of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire. These elements are represented also on the layout of the astronomical clock. The earth – the entrance doors for the clockmaker, water – the calendar board, air – the astrolabe and finally the fire – the apostles and the rooster. Does it really represent the Universe – Cosmos? Hard to guess today. Let´s go and explore its long and moved history.\n\nEarly years of its genesis In 1402 a classical clock was mounted onto the Old Town Hall tower and a few years later a big bell was hung into the tower. The first written record about the Prague Astronomical Clock dates back to October 14th, 1410. Based on this document the astronomical clock was constructed by the clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň who created it using the calculations of Jan Šindel, the then Prague´s best mathematician and astronomer. The present image of the astronomical clock we know today was the work of master Jan Hanuš and Jan Táborský. We also need to mention the sculptoral decorations of the astronomical clock made by the famous architect Petr Parléř. Rest of the sculptural decoration comes from later a period.\n\nThe Old Town Astronomical Clock (czech: Staroměstský orloj) However, let´s return to the year 1410. In this year the oldest parts, the mechanical clockwork and astronomical dial, were made. As we had already mentioned they were made by the clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň. The historians believed for long years that the astronomical clock had been created first in 1490 by a clockmaker Jan Růž who was rather familiar under his nickname Mistr Hanuš. However he was not the constructor of the astronomical clock but only was repairing it in the period between 1475 – 1497. During those years he carried out extensive modifications of the astronomical clock. After his death a clockmaker Jakub took over the administration. He became aware of the clockwork when Mistr Hanuš was still alive. After his death Václav Zvůnek became the astronomical clockmaker but he failed to fulfill his duty properly and so he was replaced by Jan Táborský who also made a few modifications there.\n\nPonds\n\nWhile unknown in many other countries, there are many fishing ponds in South Bohemia (and Czechia in general on a smaller scale). These are of varying sizes, from small pools in the middle of a forest to large water dams navigable by boat. The biggest of these ponds is Rožumberk near Třeboň.\n\nWhile fish ponds are still used for fishing (common carp being the most common fish here), they have many more uses today such as swimming, boating and water sports. If you bike, hike, or drive in South Bohemia's forests, it is likely you will come across some ponds.\n\nFor such occasions, it is always good to have your swimming gear ready! The water is usually warm enough to swim, just check if it is clear enough; sometimes fishermen put fish food into the water that makes it unsafe for humans to swim in.\n\nIn late autumn, you can see the ponds being fished, whereby all the water is poured out, the carp are picked up and placed in large water tanks and then sold at Christmas markets in towns, often alive. Common carp meat is served as traditional dinner on Christmas Eve. You can also get it every day in Třeboň.\n\nCzech Tourist Club (Klub českých turistů)\n\nthere are a great number of hiking paths and "
