        "text": "NEWPORT — No one who first picks up a tennis racket as a youngster can rightly dream of one day walking into the Hall of Fame. Michael Stich had no such dreams.\n\nAs a boy in Hamburg, West Germany, Stich’s first love was soccer, but a racquet ball court near his home would frequently serve as babysitter for him and his two older brothers.\n\n“I think I was 6 years old and my parents would say, 'Spend two hours here and we’ll pick you up later,' ” Stich said. “I’d play racquet ball and just keep hitting that wall. The wall always won.”\n\nWhile those boyhood hours honed Stich’s skills, he didn’t see stars in his eyes. Unlike future rival and countryman Boris Becker and other stars of the day, Stich had no interest in jumping onto the pro tour as a teenager.\n\n“As a junior I never wanted to become a tennis professional,” he said. “I really played tennis because I loved the game.”\n\nStich, a strong, 6-foot-4 athlete with a fluid serve, decided to try tennis for two years but always assumed he’d one day study medicine. That day never came.\n\nBy the time he was 23, Stich was a Wimbledon champion after a stunning upset of Becker. The next year he paired with John McEnroe and won Wimbledon’s doubles title.\n\nBefore long, Stich had compiled enough starry wins in a career that lasted just a bit more than 10 years to merit a spot in the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Stich was inducted into the Hall on Saturday along with Helena Sukova, the Czech star who won the career Grand Slam in doubles and was a four-time major runner-up in singles.\n\nStich acknowledged that the pressure teenagers often carry with them to the pro tours can quickly crush their dreams. He says he wasn’t prepared to leave home and travel around the world as a youngster and wasn’t carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders when he did turn pro in 1988.\n\n“That made it possible for me to become a good player because I didn’t feel the pressure that I had to be successful,” he said. “I didn’t have to do all this because someone else wanted me to do it. I just wanted to try it myself.”\n\nStich came of age in a time when tennis was loaded with stars. In his 1991 run at Wimbledon, he knocked off Jim Courier in the quarterfinals, top-seeded Stefan Edberg in the semis and then Becker (in straight sets) in the final. Also seeded in the top 10 were Ivan Lendl, Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Michael Chang.\n\nAll seven of those contemporaries beat Stich to the Hall. Now he’s happy to join them.\n\nStich always skipped the men’s pro tour event in Newport every summer to play in a clay court event in Germany. He says his first trip to town was eye-opening.\n\n“You come here and the first step you take into this Hall of Fame, the history just strikes you,” he said. “You come into the museum and realize there is such a big history of the game and that you are just a tiny little piece of the puzzle. This was created 150 years ago and will be here in another 150 years. That makes it extremely special.”\n\nSukova had the same feelings when she came to the Newport Casino a few days ago.\n\n“I have to say I am still feeling like it’s a fairy tale,” she said. “This whole town, this club, it feels like a fairy tale. I’m just flying high and enjoying myself.”\n\nSukova hails from Prague and was born to be a tennis star. Her mother, Vera, was her first coach and a finalist at Wimbledon in 1962. Her brother, Cyril Suk, was also a tennis pro and the pair combined to win three Grand Slams in mixed doubles.\n\nSukova’s ticket to the Hall was punched on the doubles court. She won 69 double tournaments, including three legs of the Grand Slam with Jana Novotna in 1990. She won doubles titles at Wimbledon four times, the U.S. and Australian Opens twice and the French Open once.\n\nSukova never won a Grand Slam singles title, but registered one of the great upsets in history when she ended Martina Navratilova’s 74-match winning streak in the semis of the 1984 Australian Open. She won the first set in the final before Chris Evert rallied for the win.\n\n“I have to say when I stopped my career [in 1998], I was very disappointed in myself that I didn’t achieve what I was hoping for,” she said. “It took me about two years to realize that my career wasn’t that bad.”"
