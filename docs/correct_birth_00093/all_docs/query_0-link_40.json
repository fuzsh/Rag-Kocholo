        "text": "Ivan Lendl (born March 7, 1960, Ostrava, Czechoslovakia [now Czech Republic]) is a Czech-born American former tennis player who was one of the sport’s most successful professionals during the 1980s and early ’90s. A right-hander who was known for his powerful forehand shots, Lendl won eight Grand Slam tournament titles, including three consecutive U.S. Open championships (1985–87).\n\nLendl’s parents were both prominent professional tennis players in Czechoslovakia during their youths. Lendl’s father had also been a chess master, having won junior chess championships in Bohemia and Moravia. Lendl himself became a top-ranked junior tennis player while in his teens. He turned professional in 1978. He was a member of the Czech Davis Cup team from 1978 to 1985 and led Czechoslovakia to the Davis Cup title in 1980. Lendl moved to the United States in 1984 and became a U.S. citizen in 1992.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nLendl reached the peak of his playing career in the mid-1980s. For 157 consecutive weeks between 1985 and 1988 he was ranked as the number one singles player in the world by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the governing body of men’s professional tennis. He captured his first Grand Slam title with a five-set victory over the American tennis star John McEnroe in the 1984 French Open. Lendl won that tournament again in 1986 and 1987. Although he lost to American Jimmy Connors in the U.S. Open finals in 1982 and 1983, he finally claimed the U.S. Open crown by defeating McEnroe in 1985. Lendl successfully defended that title the following two years. He also reached the Wimbledon finals in 1986 and 1987 but lost both times.\n\nLendl added two more Grand Slam titles to his collection with victories at the Australian Open in 1989 and 1990. He earned his final ATP tournament title—the 94th singles title of his career—in Tokyo in 1993. Suffering from back problems, he retired as a player the next year.\n\nLendl was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2001. He later became a highly regarded tennis coach. He has been recognized in particular for mentoring the Scottish tennis player Andy Murray intermittently following his appointment as Murray’s coach in late 2011. Under Lendl’s guidance Murray won his first Grand Slam title, at the U.S. Open in 2012, and the following year he became the first British tennis player in 77 years to win the Wimbledon men’s singles title."
