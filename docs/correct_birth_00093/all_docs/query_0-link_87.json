Festschrift in honour of Ladislav Bareš, Prague: Charles University, 2022.\n\nISBN 978-80-7671-088-7\n\n519 pages, contents of the volume in PDF\n\nThe volume “Knowledge and Memory” serves as an appreciation of the career and achievements of Professor Ladislav Bareš on the occasion of his 70th birthday. The notions knowledge and memory correspond perfectly to the central focus of the religious and magical spells from the Late Period shaft tombs in Abusir, a subject that has always been close to the heart and mind of Ladislav Bareš. A collection of thirty-three papers, written by former students, numerous colleagues and friends, are hence devoted to themes closely aligned with Professor Bareš’ lifelong interest: the Memphite necropolis throughout the ages, and the Late Period (and beyond) throughout the whole of Egypt.\n\nThe publication can be purchased in the e-shop of Faculty of Arts.\n\nTHE PYRAMID FIELDS OF ANCIENT EGYPT: A SATELLITE ATLAS\n\nEditors: Miroslav Bárta and Vladimír Brůna\n\nWith contributions by Adela Oppenheim and Dieter Arnold, The Metropolitan Museum of Arts, New York; Miroslav Bárta and Vladimír Brůna, Czech Institute of Egyptology, Charles University, Prague;Richard Bussmann, University of Cologne; Andrzej Ćwiek, University of Poznan; Veronika Dulíková, Czech Institute of Egyptology, Charles University, Prague; Peter Jánosi, University of Vienna; Mark Lehner, Ancient Egypt Research Associates and “Associate” at the Oriental Institute, University of Chicago; Mohamed Megahed, Czech Institute of Egyptology, Charles University, Prague; Massimiliano Nuzzolo, Institute of Mediterranean and Oriental Cultures, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw; Stephan Seidlmayer, German Archaeological Institute, Cairo; Miroslav Verner, Czech Institute of Egyptology, Charles University, Prague and Josef Wegner, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.\n\nISBN 978-80-7671-053-5, 200 pp. with many coloured photographs and a complete set of satellite images of the respective pyramid fields.\n\nThe principal aim of this publication is to provide for the first time a detailed scientific interpretation of high-resolution satellite images of all Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid sites of ancient Egypt. The sites included in this Atlas represent to a large degree the principal sites of the history of the Third to Thirteenth Dynasties. Their particular characteristics mirror the specific periods of Egyptian history and in a way may be considered as genuine time capsules providing fascinating windows into the incredible story of ancient Egypt.\n\nThe sites include (starting in the north): Abu Rawash, Giza, Zawiyet el-Aryan, Abusir, Saqqara, Dahshur, Mazghuna, Lisht, Meidum, Lahun, Hawara and Abydos. The site of Abu Ghurob with the two sun temples of Userkaf and Nyuserra of the Fifth Dynasty was also covered as well as the so-called minor step pyramids dating from the late Third – early Fourth Dynasty which start in Seila at the northeastern edge of the Faiyum Oasis and include those of Zawyet Sultan, Nubt (Naqada), Abydos (Sinki), Hierakonpolis (el-Kula), Edfu (Ghonemeia) and Elephantine.\n\nThe publication is available through Oxbow Books or the Czech Institute of Egyptology.\n\nSluneční králové / Kings of the Sun\n\nMiroslav Bárta, Jiří Janák, Renata Landgráfová (eds.)\n\nPrague: Faculty of Arts, Charles University 2021.\n\nISBN 978-80-7671-052-8; 284 pages.\n\nThe catalogue accompanied the unique exhibition Kings of the Sun that took place at the National Museum in Prague between September 1st 2020 and September 31st 2021 and mapped over a century of archaeological exploration of the site of Abusir by Egyptian, German and Czech (until 1990 Czechoslovak) missions. It contains 139 entries on almost 300 objects dating between the Early Dynastic and Ptolemaic Periods, including examples from the royal burial equipment of King Raneferef from the pyramid cemetery, sculptures of the priest Nefer and Princess Sheretnebty from Abusir south, as well as items from the Saite-Persian shaft tombs. The objects tell a story of the ancient Egyptian civilization and of the people who formed it, and through them, the catalogue maps the existence and development of the the site of Abusir for almost three millennia.\n\nBook is available in the e-shop of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University, and in the bookstore Karolinum.\n\nContinuity, Discontinuity and Change. Case studies from the New Kingdom to the Ptolemaic and Roman Era\n\nCoppens, Filip (ed.),\n\nPrague: Faculty of Arts, Charles University 2021.\n\nISBN 978-80-7671-048-1; 580 pages.\n\nThe volume focuses on different methods and strategies employed by individuals and/or communities when confronted with major changes in society and its reflection in the material culture. The first part concentrates on developments and transformations observable in New Kingdom private tombs commissioned by non-royal individuals in the three main cemeteries of the time – Amarna, Thebes and Saqqara – during the period immediately before, during and after the “Amarna age”. The second part of the volume centres on various strategies of adaptation and modification, as reflected on the level of the priesthoods and the design of the temple program (architecture, text and image) during the Ptolemaic and Roman period.\n\nContents of the volume in PDF.\n\nBook is available in the e-shop of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University, and in the bookstore Karolinum.\n\nAbusir and Saqqara in the Year 2020\n\nBárta Miroslav – Coppens Filip – Krejčí Jaromír – editors\n\nPrague: Charles University, Faculty of Arts 2021\n\nThe Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Charles University has since the start of the third millennium established the tradition of organising on a regular basis a platform for scholars, active in the pyramid fields and the cemeteries of the Memphite region (Abusir, Saqqara, Dahshur and Giza in particular). The present volume, the fifth in the series, contains 30 contributions by 35 scholars, reflecting the widespread, often multidisciplinary interest of researchers into a wide variety of different topics related to the Memphite necropoleis. Individual contributions include some of the latest results of archaeological explorations, new interpretations of archaeological evidence within the framework of social and environmental development and climate change, new approaches to long-known texts and inscriptions, the application of modern computer-based analyses of the society of the day, as well as newly understood historical, social and landscape connotations of some sites and monuments.\n\nContents of the volume in PDF.\n\nBook is available in the e-shop of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University and in the online bookshop of Karolinum\n\nEconomic Complexity in the Ancient Near East. Management of Resources and Taxation (Third – Second Millennium BC)\n\nedited by Jana Mynářová and Sergio Alivernini\n\nPrague: Charles University, Faculty of Arts 2020\n\nISBN: 978-80-7308-991-7\n\nHardcover, 471 pages\n\nPrice: 55 Euro\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe spread of cuneiform writing from its Mesopotamian heartland to the peripheries during the second half of the third, and especially in the second millennium BC, represents an important historical and cultural phenomenon. From the beginning of the second millennium BC cuneiform writing became the privileged means through which the administrations of these “peripheral” centers recorded economic transactions. These documents (taxes, rations, sales, etc.) shed a fascinating light on the economic system in these regions. Thousands of administrative documents allow us to follow the process of the development of economic thought that, starting from Mesopotamia, was taken and adapted to specific administrative realities throughout the wider regions of the Ancient Near East. The 19 essays collected here elucidate the emergence, transmission, and interaction of economic structures and the management of resources in time and space. Through a diachronic study, the volume identifies similarities, differences, and adaptations in the economic management of resources and taxation in the Ancient Near East (third – second millennium BC)\n\nContents of the volume in PDF.\n\nVeronika Dulíková, Miroslav Bárta (editors)\n\nAddressing the Dynamics of Change in Ancient Egypt: Complex Network Analysis\n\nCharles University, Prague, Faculty of Arts 2020\n\nThe present volume seeks to indicate novel methods and approaches to analysing and interpreting the agency of individual officials in different periods of ancient Egyptian history. Their activity and careers are observed using different methods of complex network analysis and put into a broader framework of more general trends operating the society at a given stage of its evolution. We are confident that this is one of the most promising and proven ways to gain deeper insights into day-to-day lives of the people of the past. The story of civilisations is above all a story of ideas and thoughts, and social/complex network analysis is one of the most efficient tools we can use. It enables us to view known data anew and assess them from new perspectives that significantly expand and deepen our knowledge of the past civilisation. In recent years, this research approach has evolved independently at several institutions exploring ancient Egypt. We were very pleased to host most of these scholars at a joint meeting and offer them an opportunity to present and communicate their individual approaches, methods, points of view and observations. The contributions in this volume, originally presented at a workshop in Prague in September 2018, cover selected periods of ancient Egypt (the Old Kingdom, the New Kingdom, the Greco-Roman Period). Cyber-Egyptology, a new area of research in Egyptology, appears to be a justified approach with its own methodology, philosophy and a vast potential to answer complex questions relating to this fascinating civilisation and its diachronic dynamics. Moreover, this method of cyber-research can be applied universally across most archaeological and historical specialisations.\n\nBook is available in the e-shops of the Faculty of Arts, Charles University, and bookstore Karolinum.\n\n†Eugen Strouhal\n\nWadi Qitna and Kalabsha-South: Late Roman – Early Byzantine Tumuli Cemeteries in Egyptian Nubia. Volume II – Anthropology\n\n(with contributions by Hans Barnard, Petra Havelková, Jaroslav Jambor, Přemysl Klír, Alena Němečková, †Vladimír Novotný, Karel Preuss, Milan Salaš, Václav Smrčka, Lenka Varadzinová and †Luboš Vyhnánek)\n\nEdited by Lenka Varadzinová and Petra Havelková\n\nCharles University, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2020\n\nContents and preface in PDF.\n\nThe present publication follows Volume I of 1984 that presented the results of a comprehensive archaeological investigation of two tumulus cemeteries of the Late Roman and Early Byzantine Period (third–fifth centuries AD) explored by the Czechoslovak Institute of Egyptology (Charles University in Prague) in the scope of the UNESCO-organised salvage campaign called for in advance of the ultimate submersion of Nubia by the waters of the High Aswan Dam. This Volume II evaluates the human skeletal remains of 558 individuals from the completely explored cemetery at Wadi Qitna (456 tumuli) and a comparative sample of 35 individuals from the near-by cemetery at Kalabsha-South (19 tumuli) from the point of view of social, cultural and physical anthropology. It provides the evidence of their social structure as well as an insight into the life of the people and their family relationships. A comparison of the physical-anthropological features of the community with other contemporaneous and antecedent series using univariate and multivariate methods reveals their mutual position. The final chapter provides a brief overview of the history of the northern part of Egyptian Nubia and an up-to-date report on the handmade pottery found in large numbers at Wadi Qitna and Kalabsha-South, whose distribution has since been attested at many sites in the Nile Valley, on the Red Sea coast and in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and the Sudan. The volume touches upon the complex social and ethnic processes that were taking place in the frontier region between Egypt and Nubia during the critical centuries separating the Antiquity and Medieval Period and opens paths to their further research. The text is accompanied by 111 tables, 78 figures and maps, 41 photographic and documentary plates and 5 appendices. The book is available in the e-shop of the Faculty of Arts.\n\nMynářová, Jana – Kilani, Marwan – Alivernini, Sergio (eds.)\n\nA Stranger in the House – the Crossroads III. Proceedings of an International Conference on Foreigners in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Societies of the Bronze Age held in Prague, September 10-13, 2018\n\nPrague: Charles University, Faculty of Arts, 2019\n\nThe Crossroads III – A Stranger in the House. Foreigners in Ancient Egyptian and Near Eastern Societies of the Bronze Age conference has been held at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University (Prague) between September 10 and 13, 2018. The main objective of the conference was to enhance our understanding of “foreignness” in ancient societies between the end of the Chalcolithic period and the end of the Late Bronze Age. This book collects some of the twenty most significant contributions presented at the conference. Some authors decided to approach the discussion from a theoretical perspective, or to present and discuss theoretical frameworks that could be used to explore at least some elements underlying the concept of “foreignness”. Others investigated sociocultural dimension involved in the presence of foreigners, or in their interactions with local communities. Cases from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Levant, covering the whole of the Bronze Age have been discussed. The wide range of perspectives, and their combination within the frame of the conference often stimulated that multidisciplinary dialogue that was the primary aim of this third edition of Crossroads.\n\nHadcover, 435 pp.\n\nISBN: 978-80-7308-928-3\n\nMassimiliano Nuzzolo\n\nThe Fifth Dynasty Sun Temples. Kingship, Architecture and Religion in Third Millenium BC Egypt\n\nCharles University, Prague, Faculty of Arts 2019\n\nThe sun temples of the Fifth Dynasty are an unparalleled monument of ancient Egypt which characterized the central part of the Old Kingdom, usually considered as the apex of the solar cult and theology. Yet, the issues of their actual meaning, original architectural shape and ideological influence on the later phases of Egyptian history are far from clear, as well as their cultic, ideological and symbolic relationship with the contemporary pyramids and with what is considered to be the original place of rise and diffusion of the solar cult in ancient Egypt, i.e., the city of Heliopolis. Six temples were built in a quite limited time span in the middle of the Third Millennium BC but only two have been discovered so far. Where are, thus, the missing ones? All these questions, and many others, are addressed by the present book, which represents the first complete publication on the sun temples matter. The volume collects all the available archaeological and textual evidences related to these monuments, including an in-depth reconstruction of the original decoration of the temples and a rich prosopography of the people involved with their running. Several tables, sheets and plates, with photographs of the monuments and the main related documents, also enrich the publication.\n\nPeter Jánosi a Hana Vymazalová (eds.)\n\nThe Art of Describing. The World of Tomb Decoration as Visual Culture of the Old Kingdom. Studies in Honour of Yvonne Harpur\n\nCharles University, Prague, Faculty of Arts 2018\n\nThe superbly illustrated volume “The Art of Describing” presents a wide array of subject-matter dealing with the visual culture of the Old Kingdom. The topics range from many in-depth studies of various two-dimensional motifs as well as sculpture encountered in the tombs of the Memphite necropolises, the presentation of complete overviews of wall scenes, and the art of carving, to selected royal scenes as well as the decorative programme of burial chambers. Many of the issues touch upon hitherto unpublished material and tombs only recently discovered.\n\nThe book was compiled in honour of Yvonne Harpur, the doyenne of the study of art and decoration of tombs from the pyramid age. Her life-long passion for tomb decoration and scenes details have influenced and helped students and scholars around the world. Thus, the contributions collected in this album amicorum not only reflect the great interest but also the potential in dealing with the art of the Old Kingdom.\n\nContents of the volume:\n\nMiroslav Bárta – Filip Coppens – Jaromír Krejčí (eds.)\n\nAbusir and Saqqara in the Year 2015\n\nCharles University, Fauclty of Arts, Prague 2017\n\nThe Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Charles University in Prague has since the start of the third millennium established the tradition of organizing on a regular basis a platform for scholars, active in the pyramid fields and the cemeteries of the Memphite region (Abusir, Saqqara, Dahshur and Giza in particular), to meet, exchange information and establish further cooperation.\n\nThe present volume, containing 43 contributions by 53 scholars, is the result of the already fourth “Abusir and Saqqara” conference held in June 2015. The volume reflects the widespread, often multidisciplinary interest of many researchers into a wide variety of different topics related to the Memphite necropoleis. Recurring topics of the studies include a focus on archaeology, the theory of artifacts, iconographic and art historian studies, and the research of largely unpublished archival materials. An overwhelming number of contributions (31) is dedicated to various aspects of Old Kingdom archaeology and most present specific aspects linked with archaeological excavations, both past and present.\n\nRenata Landgráfová – Jana Mynářová (eds.)\n\nRich and great : studies in honour of Anthony J. Spalinger on the occasion of his 70th feast of Thoth\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2016\n\nEgyptology, like other related disciplines, is becoming more and more specialized. Scholars are focussing on topics limited in scope and restricted to a particular area of research. The time when an Egyptologists was able to hold his own on several diverse aspects of the subject is almost gone. This is a logical consequence of the unprecedented growth and expansion of contemporary scholarship and of the requirements of the ruthless competition for jobs. Yet there still are some whose breadth as well as depth of knowledge astonish. Professor Anthony John Spalinger to whom the present volume is dedicated belongs to that rare breed.\n\nHana Navrátilová – Renata Landgráfová\n\nSex and Golden Goddess II.

Mastaba of Werkaure. Vol. 1: Tombs AC 26 and AC 32 – Old Kingdom Strata\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2014\n\nThe monograph evaluates results of the archaeological research of the area of the Fifth-Dynasty Tomb AC 26 (formerly known as Pyramid Lepsius no. 23) and Late Sixth-Dynasty Tombs AC 32 carried out by the Czech Institute of Egyptology during three archaeological seasons from 2006 until 2009. The publication focuses on archaeological contexts dated to the Old Kingdom. Tomb AC 26 is located next to the pyramid complex of Queen Khentkaus II – in the centre of the royal necropolis – it thus demonstrates an important position of its tomb owner. It is also one of the most devastated monuments in the Abusir royal necropolis. This fact made the field work and the evaluation of its results rather difficult. Regardless of its large-scaled destruction it was possible to ascribe Tomb AC 26 to “the Eldest son of the King”, Werkaure. Individual chapters of the book deal with the description and evaluation of the architecture of the tombs, finds datable to the Old Kingdom, a large collection of pottery, masons’ inscriptions and signs, archaeobotanical analyses of macroremains from mud bricks and conclusions – concerning especially dating of the Tombs AC 26 and AC 32.

The present volume of the Abusir series concentrates on the mastaba of Neferinpu (AS 37). It aims to present primary data and their basic analysis and interpretation acquired during the tomb examination by the Czech Institute of Egyptology during two subsequent seasons of 2006 and 2007 and followed by some minor campaigns in 2012 and 2013 and a specific analytical campaign in September 2014 carried out by the Japanese team from Tokyo University of Science. The mastaba was built by a sun priest and official Neferinpu who reached the peak of his career during the reign of Nyuserra and Djedkara.\n\nMarek Dospěl – Lenka Suková (eds.)\n\nBahriya Oasis. Recent Research into the Past of an Egyptian Oasis\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2013\n\nThrough its 14 chapters, this book presents the outcomes of the recent exploration of Bahriya, an Egyptian oasis located in the Western Desert about 350 km south-west of Cairo. Part I of the volume is devoted to the southern part of the Oasis (also known as El-Hayz) and the exploration carried out there by the team led by the Czech Institute of Egyptology, Charles University in Prague. Part II concentrates on the northern part of the same oasis bringing forth the results of scholarly research by the French team led by Université de Strasbourg. Complementing the two parts is Part III with the final chapter which deals with water-management in the Western Desert as a whole. Containing chapters written by archaeologists, Egyptologists, philologists and natural scientists, this richly illustrated book attempts at providing as comprehensive picture of the past of the Bahriya Oasis as can be drawn from the hitherto research, encompassing a wide range of aspects from settlement history and environment to material culture and written evidence.\n\ndownload table of contents (PDF)\n\nMiroslav Bárta\n\nJourney to the West. The world of the Old Kingdom tombs\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2012\n\nThis book is intended as a commented summary of some of the major trends and most important features that can be encountered when analysing ancient Egyptian society of the Old Kingdom. We have to bear in mind that around 3000 BCE one of the first centralised states in our recorded history rose, and the Old Kingdom represents certainly one of its apogees. Moreover, there is hardly any comparable society that left behind such a wealth of archaeological and literary evidence, a welcome companion for our journey back in time. The goal for writing this book was to outline general trends in the history of the non-royal tomb development of the period. The reason is rather simple and straightforward: ancient Egyptians considered the tomb to be their afterlife residence for eternity. In the afterlife they replicated the life they experienced during the lifetime. Thus the tomb architecture, decoration, inscriptions and equipment paradoxically represent a major tool for our understanding of the everyday life of the ancient Egyptians and enable a better comprehension of the development and dynamics of the Old Kingdom. The book is divided into nine chapters covering, step by step, the development of the Egyptian tomb and society from the Predynastic Period to the end of the first six Egyptian dynasties, a lengthy period of time which covers the Early Dynastic and the Old Kingdom periods. These six chapters are accompanied by three additional chapters on religious aspects of the Old Kingdom society, its economy and environment. 342 pages.\n\nReviews:\n\n– Nigel Strudwick, Egyptian Archaeology 42, 2013\n\nLenka Suková\n\nThe Rock Paintings of Lower Nubia (Czechoslovak Concession)\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2011\n\nThe monograph is the first exhaustive publication of nine shelters with rock paintings documented by the Czechoslovak expedition in Lower Nubia in the scope of the UNESCO-organised salvage campaign. The presentation of each of the painted shelters includes description of the landscape setting and physical characteristics of the rock surfaces, analyses of the thematic, stylistic, syntactic, and technical aspects of the rock art, discussion of the spatial and temporal dynamics of the rock-art surface, and evaluation of the significance of the evidence. The final chapter offers some thoughts on the overall significance of the rock paintings from the Czechoslovak concession as one of the artistic and cultural expressions of the populations that inhabited Lower Nubia in different periods of the past and as historical documents about their past worlds and lives. Part of the book is a large-format (70 × 100 cm) colour plate with a reconstruction of one of the most exquisite occurrences of rock paintings in Lower Nubia, the so-called “Painted Shelter at Korosko”.\n\nLenka Suková\n\nThe Rock Art of Lower Nubia (Czechoslovak Concession)\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2011\n\nThe present publication is concerned with the rock art from two sections of the Nile Valley in Lower Nubia surveyed in the scope of the UNESCO-organised salvage campaign by the Czechoslovak Institute of Egyptology (Charles University in Prague). It has two main objects, first to complete the catalogue of the rock art documented or localised in the two sections of the Czechoslovak concession with hitherto unpublished rock-art surfaces and occurrences (both petroglyphs and rock paintings) and, second, to provide a critical revision of the data published in Katalog der Felsbilder aus der Tschechoslowakischen Konzession in Nubien (edited by F. Váhala and P. Červíček, Prag 1999). With the two objects accomplished, the present publication constitutes a kind of manual to the rock-art corpus from the Czechoslovak concession in Lower Nubia and is to be regarded, together with Katalog, as the complete and authoritative source of data for evaluation of the significance of the evidence from the two sections of the Nile Valley in Lower Nubia. The textual part is accompanied by hitherto unpublished distribution maps of the corpus, 155 hitherto unpublished black-and-white photographs, and four colour plates with the sheets of the colour scale used for the recording of patina difference or colour value of preserved paints.\n\nReviews:\n\n– Wouter Claes, Bibliotheca Orientalis LXXIII/1-2 (2016), 107-108\n\nMiroslav Bárta – Filip Coppens – Jaromír Krejčí (eds.)\n\nAbusir and Saqqara in the Year 2010 (2 volumes)\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2011\n\nThe Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Charles University in Prague has since the start of the third millennium established the tradition of organising on a regular basis a platform for scholars, active in the pyramid fields and the cemeteries of the Abusir-Saqqara-Dahshur region, to meet, exchange information and establish further cooperation. The present two part volume, containing 51 contributions in total, is the result of the already third “Abusir and Saqqara” conference held in late May and early June 2010. The volume reflects the widespread, often multidisciplinary interest of many researchers into a wide variety of different topics related to the region of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur. The focus of the majority of the articles is on these cemeteries of the Memphite region at the time of the Old Kingdom, but not a single period is left untouched. A number of articles also move outside the core region, studying material and developments elsewhere in Egypt, but always against the background of the Memphite necropolis.

To create them, a combination of natural conditions in the Nile valley and the functioning of a strictly hierarchical society was needed. On the top of this society there was the ruler – the only living god on earth. This publication presents and describes – in the form of a mosaic – pyramid complexes, tombs and temples as well as the life and socio-cultural development of ancient Egyptian society, the sovereign status, religious ideas, and life of high dignitaries as well as that of ordinary people. Attention is also given to the natural environment and its influence on the Nile civilization. More than 4000 years which have passed since the period of pyramid builders represent a very difficult gap to overcome. Generations of Egyptologists, to whom the author of this book belongs, keep endeavouring to do it. Thus, curious readers can be at least partially satisfied.Format: 344 pages, ISBN 978-80-7308-368-1, text in Czech.\n\nJana Mynářová (ed.)\n\nEgypt and the Near East. The Crossroads\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2011\n\nThe present volume presents the proceedings from the international workshop entitled Egypt and the Near East – the Crossroads, dedicated to the study of the relations between the two regions. The symposium took place from September 1–3, 2010 at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague. The main objective of the workshop was to enhance our understanding of the historical processes and the development of the abundant and complex relations between Egypt and the Near East during the period defined by the end of the Chalcolithic Period and the dawn of the Iron Age. In light of this, special attention was given to the region of Syria-Palestine. In order to obtain a well-balanced insight, the subject was discussed both from an archaeological and from a philological point of view. The volume contains fourteen papers, all of them closely related with the topic of the workshop with seven papers based on the study of material culture and archaeological data, and seven papers devoted to the study of written sources. The first group (archaeology and material culture) contains studies devoted to the Egyptian statuary from Qatna (A. Ahrens), to material from a grown settlement of the late Middle Kingdom at Tell el-Dabca (B. Bader), an overview of results of recent excavations at Tell Tweini (J. Bretschneider / A.-S. Van Vyve / G. Jans) and Tell el-Farkha (M. Czarnowicz), a study of the predynastic Egyptian influence in the Jordanian site of Tall Hujayrat al-Ghuzlan (F. Klimscha); an essay on religious symbolism in the Southern Levant in the Bronze Age according to iconography (F. Lippke) and finally, an analysis of the Levantine combed ware from Heit el-Ghurab (A. Wodzińska / M. Ownby). As for the second group of texts (written evidence) the volume contains the following papers: a reappraisal of the tale of Wenamun in the context of Ancient Near Eastern law (Ch. Brinker), a revision of the chronology of the Amarna letters sent by Aziru, the ruler of Amurru (Cordani); a detailed revision of relations between Egypt and Ḫatti set into the context of Ancient Near Eastern chronology (E. Devecchi / J. Miller), a linguistic analysis of the terminology used to refer to the king in Egyptian and Hittite texts from Ramesside period (J. Mynářová); a study of historical topography concerning the location of the toponym Qode (Z. Simon); a reconstruction of the translation processes in the production and reception of the Amarna letters (H. Tarawneh) and finally, an analysis of the relations between Egypt, Kush and Assyria before the battle of Eltekeh (S. Zamazalová).

Scientific Knowledge in the Reign of the Pharaohs\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2011\n\nAncient Egyptian science developed under the patronage of the god of wisdom and writing Thoth from very early on. Scribes, priests and administrative staff composed scientific texts that helped them to fulfil their duties and preserve their knowledge for the following generations. Today only a few of these texts are known, as most of the documents written by ancient Egyptian scholars have not withstood the test of time. The present volume focuses on three specific branches of ancient Egyptian scientific knowledge: mathematics, medicine and astronomy. The book at hand not only deals with the preserved documents, but aims concomitantly to indicate and illustrate the practical use and importance of these sciences for Egyptian society. In contrast to today’s understanding of science, scientific knowledge represented in ancient Egypt a means, not a goal in its own right. It was a tool of the administrators and priests who participated in managing the country and its resources in the name of pharaoh. In essence, Egyptian scientific knowledge had a single goal: to preserve the life created by the gods and the cosmic order. Mathematics allowed for precise planning and organisation, astronomy was a means to control both space and time, while medicine preserved life itself. The great respect in which ancient scholars and authors held Egyptian scientific knowledge is apparent from the fact that they still turned to Egyptian culture for inspiration several millennia later.Format: A5, 352 pages, hardcover, in Czech.\n\nJaromír Krejčí (with a contribution of Václav Cílek, Jiří Novák, Jindřich Hladil and Miloš Lang)\n\nAbusir XVIII. The Royal Necropolis in Abusir\n\nCharles University in Prague, Faculty of Arts, Prague 2010\n\nThe book is divided into sixteen chapters dealing – in a diachronic perspective – with a wide range of problems concerning the development of the royal pyramid necropolis at Abusir. The introductory sections discuss the history of research of the necropolis, the conditions for its formation, the geomorphological situation in the area, the building materials and technologies used and the historical development of the Egyptian state in the late Fourth Dynasty and the beginning of the Fifth Dynasty. The largest part of the book (chapters 8–15) is devoted to the development of the necropolis from the Archaic period until the end of the Old Kingdom. The individual chapters present and discuss buildings – particularly royal pyramid complexes – which originated during the reign of individual rulers. Attention is also paid to the sun temples and, of course, to the tombs of the royal family members and to the cemeteries of dignitaries, which were founded around the royal complexes. The final chapter summarizes the results of the research. This publication is complemented by many illustrations, which also include three-dimensional computer reconstructions of buildings which arose during the discussed period at the royal burial necropolis.

Tomb of Hetepi (AS 20), Tombs AS 33-35 and AS 50-53\n\nCharles University in Prague, Prague 2010\n\nThe tombs published in this volume of the Abusir series have been excavated during several seasons at Abusir South. The eight tombs are located in the easternmost sector of Abusir South, on the slopes (tombs AS 20 and AS 33) and at the bottom (tombs AS 34-35, 50-53) of a large but low hill, to the north of the so-called Wadi Abusiri. They do not form a single cemetery; rather, they represent different groups of sacral structures that illustrate very well the diachronic development of the Abusir South necropolis during the Old Kingdom and the Late Period-Ptolemaic era. Most if not all of the structures document in a new way important archaeological and historical themes, such as the origin and development of the false door tradition; early administration (tomb AS 20); unique building development of early Old Kingdom tombs (AS 20 and 33); the late Old Kingdom sociology of family cemeteries (tombs AS 34-35 and 50-53) and the appearance of new Late Period animal cemeteries (tombs AS 33, 34-35 and 50-53).

Social and Religious Development of Egypt in the First Millennium BCE\n\nCharles University in Prague, Prague 2010\n\nThe first millennium BCE represents for Egypt a period of tremendous changes and developments on the political, social, economic and religious level. The millennium was shaped and characterised by a continuous interaction between Egypt as an independent political entity, with its indigenously developed social and religious system, and various political, military and cultural forces and influences introduced into the country, both through occupation and trade. Throughout the millennium one observes a conscious retrieval and interpretation of the past based on the traditions of the third and second millennium BCE in an attempt to preserve the country’s cultural identity in the face of foreign influences and occupation. As a result, new religious and social concepts developed which were incorporated in the ideological and administrative spheres of the centralised state and manifested themselves in art, architecture, language, and religion. In early September 2009, the Czech Institute of Egyptology of the Charles University in Prague hosted an international workshop dedicated specifically to social and religious developments in Egypt in the course of the first millennium BCE. The volume at hand contains twenty of the papers presented at the workshop.

The Life of the Egyptologist Jaroslav Černý\n\nLibri, Prague 2010\n\nIn this new biography of Jaroslav Černý the author reveals Černý in a number of different lights: his most important role was one of the world’s leading Egyptologists. He became the most famous expert in hieratic texts of the New Kingdom. He was a devoted teacher, an altruistic and constant friend to Egyptologists around the world, a loving husband and father. In England he was Professor in both the University College, London, and Oxford University. In Egypt, he participated in the excavations of the French.This biography is being published on the 40th occasion of Černý’s death, in gratitutde for all his help and advice to Czech Egyptology during his lenghty stay in England. In three major areas he has benefited his country : by his many gifts to the Czech Institute Library, by his constant support and advice to Zbynĕk Žàba, the director who was struggling to keep Czech Egyptology alive in Prague, and most importandly, by advising Czech Egyptologists to begin their excavations at Abusir.

Tomb Complex of the Vizier Qar, His Sons Qar Junior and Senedjemib, and Iykai\n\nDryada, Prague 2009\n\nThis is first part of publications dealing with the unique complex of the viyier Qar and his sons discovered in Abusir South between 1995-2002. Individual tombs date to the Sixth Dynasty (23rd century BC). The principal tomb belonging to vizier Qar comprised two decorated chapels in the superstructure and a burial chamber decorated as well. The tombs in the immediate vicinity belonged to his sons whose burial chambers still contained a wealth of unique items belonging to the original burial equipment. The present publication also provides a general environmental framework for the period under discussion. The following chapters may be found in the publication: 1 Introduction (M.

On the Neolithic Origins of Ancient Egyptian Mythology and Symbolism\n\nDryada, Prague 2010\n\nThe origins of ancient Egyptian civilisation have been attracting the attention of archaeologist ever since the beginnings of Egyptology more than 200 years ago. This book presents a new and original interpretation of the rock art in Egyptian Western Desert which is of a key importance for our understanding of the roots of ancient Egyptian civilisation. Indeed, her very origins can be most likely dated to the 6th millennium B.C. In this time and the centuries to follow the paintings in the Cave of the Swimmers known from a blockbuster English Patient and in the Cave of Beasts discovered only few years ago were created. These caves are located in a distant and hardly accessible part of Egypt, on the border of Egypt, Libya and Sudan. The rock-art preserved in these caves features several unique motifs that will become cornerstone of ancient Egyptian iconography and mythology. Among them may be named the motif of the sky goddess and the earth god, prototypic representation of an ancient chieftain in the much later pharaonic guise or the concept of cave creatures protecting the entrance to the Netherworld. During the Fifth and Fourth millennia B.C. the vast areas of Western Desert suffered from a major depredation of climate that most likely led to a gradual evacuation of the region and instigated appearance of permanent settlements in the Nile valley which led to genesis of ancient Egyptian culture. The present study aims to present a theory according to which at least some parts of the discussed rock art in the Western Desert was created by an ancient mind that later on contributed to the intellectual emergence of ancient Egyptian civilisation in the Nile valley.

Minor tombs in the Royal Necropolis I. The Mastabas of Nebtyemneferes and Nakhtsare, Pyramid Complex Lepsius no. 24 and Tomb Complex Lepsius no. 25\n\nCzech Institute of Egyptology, Prague 2008\n\nThis monograph presents a report on the results of the archaeological excavations of the Czech Institute of Egyptology undertaken from 1987 until 2004 and held in the area of the Abusir minor tombs clustered around the tombs of the 5th Dynasty kings. The first chapter isdevoted to the excavation and description of the mastaba of Nebtyemneferes, a rather enigmatic identity – probably a princess – who was buried among the tombs of the members of the royal family in the southern part of the Abusir pyramid necropolis. The tomb includescommon features of Abusir tombs of the period.The second chapter deals with research into the mastaba of Prince Nakhtsare, located to the south of Raneferef’s mortuary temple; it is the northernmost tomb in a row of tombs located on the southern border of the royal necropolis.The important position of this very destroyed tomb is also indicated by its rich burial equipment, as well as by the masons’ marks found on the masonry of the mastaba. The third chapter is devoted to the pyramid complex of an unknown queen in a tomb known as Lepsius no. 24. Because a large number of masons’ marks was present on this pyramid’s walls, and, in addition, because of the bad state of preservation of this monument, we have been able to study in an unique way the methods used by the ancient architects and builders in the construction of royal monuments in the middle of the Fifth Dynasty. A further chapter is dedicated to a most exceptional complex – the monument known to us now as Lepsius no. 25. This monument represents a double tomb whose name was written as double pyramid. Unfortunately, it is in a very desolated state of preservation, so much so that many details of its intriguing architecture as well as the burial equipments, etc., have been lost to us forever. The sixth chapter is devoted to the anthropological material discovered during the archaeological excavations of these monuments. The majority of this material is represented by remains coming from the Late Period cemeteries, which once covered this area. In addition to this fairly large group, there is one very significant study featuring the fragments of a female mummy which might have belonged to the owner of the pyramid complex Lepsius no. 24. A study of the stone vessels found in the monuments discussed in this monograph represents an Appendix.

The Architecture of the Mastaba of Ptahshepses\n\nCzech Institute of Egyptology – Academia, Prague 2008\n\nThe text consists of six chapters dealing with the history of exploration, with the tomb owner – Vizier Ptahshepses – his social status and his role within the royal court as well as with other members of his family, with the location of the mastaba in the frames of the Abusir Royal Necropolis. The largest part of the monograph is represented by the fourth chapter, which is dedicated to the description of the individual building stages of the mastaba. Besides the description of the remaining masonry and the architectural elements, possible reconstructions of the original appearance of the mastaba’s respective parts are presented as well. The fifth chapter (Remarks on the architecture and function of the mastaba) emphasises some features of the mastaba’s architecture which are discussed in the broader context of the development of ancient Egyptian architecture during the Third Millennium B.C. This chapter also includes a discussion on the spatial and functional analysis of the mastaba. The sixth, concluding chapter, sums up the previously mentioned topics and the place of the tomb and its owner in the framework of the development of the Old Kingdom. It is also devoted to an analysis of the dating of the mastaba’s construction.

Proceedings of the Conference Held in Prague (June 27–July 5, 2005)\n\nCzech Institute of Egyptology, Prague 2008\n\nThe present volume is the result of the second international symposium dedicated to the necropolis of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur that took place in Prague in June–July 2005. The thirty articles include contributions by Hartwig Altenmueller, Dieter Arnold, Vassil Dobrev, Ludwig Morenz, Miroslav Verner, Christiane Ziegler and numerous other scholars. The contributions cover various aspects of the Memphite region from the Early Dynastic Period to the Roman era, but the bulk of the papers focus on the Abusir–Saqqara necropolis in the Old Kingdom. A study and interpretation of the archaeological remains and literary sources form the main themes of interest among the contributions, but the most characteristic feature of most papers is the use of a combination of archaeological, literary and iconographic material in order to attain a deeper knowledge and better understanding of the Memphite necropolis and its development over time.

Tradition and Innovation in Temples of the Ptolemaic and Roman Period\n\nCzech Institute of Egyptology, Prague 2007\n\nThe volume provides an in–depth study of an architectural ensemble that consists of an open court and elevated chapel, better known as the wabet, and forms an essential part of the layout of a dozen temples in Egypt of the Thirtieth Dynasty and the Ptolemaic and Roman era (e.g Philae, Edfu, Dendara, Shanhûr, and Deir Shalwît). The volume focuses on the ensemble’s location, orientation, and layout, the designations in use to refer to the complex, and the decorative scheme applied to its walls in order to gain a better insight into the activities performed in the complex and its role within the temple. The volume also takes a closer look at various plausible precursors of the complex in temples of the New Kingdom and the Late Period and examines the ensemble’s relation to the wabet as a ‘place of embalming’.Format: 245 pages, 39 illustrations (20 plans, 19 b/w photographs) and 12 tables, hardback, 19 x 25 cm.\n\nMiroslav Bárta – Vladimír Brůna\n\nSatellite Atlas of the Pyramids\n\nDryáda – Czech Institute of Egyptology, Prague 2007\n\nThe book Satellite Atlas of the Pyramids presents satellite images of the most famous pyramid fields of ancient Egypt of the time of the pyramid builders. For the first time it presents satellite images of tombs and cemeteries of ancient Egyptian kings to Czech and international public, using the highest resolution possible.The examined area includes, from north to south, the sun temple of Abu Ghurab and the pyramid necropoleis of Abusir, Saqqara and Dahshur. These sites hold the vast majority of all known pyramids of Old Kingdom kings (and include also several Middle Kingdom pyramids at Dahshur) and hundreds of tombs of high and lesser officials of their time. The publication includes also texts relating the history of the mapping of the area and reproductions of maps that were gradually created since the time of Napoleon’s expedition to Egypt at the end of the 18th century until the present.The publication contains 3 folded large-format maps printed on the largest offset machine in the world (the maps at 192 cm long); a satellite image in full resolution, Lepsuis’ map (which has never been published as a whole and the only painted original of which is located in Berlin) and de Morgan’s map (which has also never been published as a whole).\n\nJohanna Holaubek – Hana Navrátilová – Wolf B.

Papers deal with many topics, including the presence of Europeans, especially people from the former Hapsburg monarchy, in Egypt, but also of Egyptians and people of Middle Eastern origin in Central and Eastern Europe. Special attention is paid to scholarly travel and expeditions. The history of travel in Egypt is also addressed, as well as politics, art history and cultural history. A selection of papers deal with special aspects of Egyptomania, such as the presence of Egypt in European funerary art, the impact of Egypt in Renaissance culture, or the presence of Egypt in education. Two exceptional contributions by A Lant (on sphinxes in silent cinema) and by J Janák (the Austrian ibises) bring new perspectives to our perception of relations between the West and the East.\n\nHana Vymazalová\n\nAncient Egyptian Mathematics.

Most of them served for teaching mathematics in the Egyptian scribal schools, and thus they offer us a glimpse not only at mathematics as such, but also on some of the methods that were used in the education of future state officials. The first part of the book contains a basic overview of the contents of the preserved texts, presents the scope of the problems solved in them and the differences between examples coming from various texts. The second part is formed by translations of hieratic mathematical texts, which include, besides the most famous Rhind mathematical papyrus also the Moscow papyrus, Kahun fragments, wooden tablets from Akhmim, the Berlin museum fragments, and the London leather roll.

Faience Inlays from the Funerary Temple of King Raneferef\n\nCzech Institute of Egyptology, Prague 2006\n\nIn the course of the exploration of the funerary temple of King Raneferef, the expedition of the Czech Institute of Egyptology discovered about 2000 fragments of faience inlays and tablets of Egyptian blue bearing texts and scenes in relief. The present volume contains the full description, analysis and interpretation of this unique find. The evidence, analysed by the author in archaeological and historical context, suggests that the inlays (and probably also the tablets of Egyptian blue) had once decorated wooden shrines containing the statues of the king, and the functional analysis of their motifs indicates that the inlays and tablets in all likelihood formed a substitute of the relief decoration that was missing in the temple of Raneferef.

Travel sketches from the Orient\n\nSet Out, Prague 2006\n\nAlbum of lithographs by Karl Ludwig Libay, accompanied with the text by Alfred von Kremer.The modern edition of a classical richly illustrated „picture travelogue“ of an Austrian painter. Karl L. Libay was a prominent vedutiste. He visited Egypt in 1850s and completed there a remarkable set of aquarel paintings, later transposed into lithographs. The lithographs are accompanied with a text by a prominent Austrian scholar of that time, Alfred von Kremer, later the Austrian deputy in the powers’ committee governing the Egyptian state debt in the late 1870s. The lively scenes are in part corresponding to the contemporary vogue represented e.g. by David Roberts, but in part they have an original setting and mise-en-scéne. The text is a unique testimony to the period vision of Egypt, her history and especially her inhabitants. Some Oriental stereotypes are mixed with genuine scholarship, the text aimed in its time at a broad audience and the tendency to attract various readers makes it a fascinating reading even today. The book contains colour reproductions of the complete set of lithographs as once published in 1858, and the original German and French text by Kremer, accompanied by the English, Czech and Slovak translation (Libay was born in that part of former Hungary which is now Slovakia) and commentary.

Some of the sources that will be published in terms of this edition, have already been published before, but mostly in the 19th century, and a re-edition in terms of modern editorial practices is much needed (this is the case of Harant’s journey or of the travelogue of Martin Kabátník). Others exist only in the form of the original publications (the texts of J. Žvejkal, V. Foit, or H. Mayer). The last group is formed by hitherto unpublished manuscript materials (eg. P. Dušková – correspondence or part of the correspondence of B. Hrozný and F. Lexa). The individual anthologies will be conceived as representative selections, this limited edition cannot cover all the relevant material. This is true above all for the most recent times. The first volume is dedicated to the travelogues of the 16th and early 17th centuries, of the authors Martin Kabátník, Bohuslav Hasištejnský of Lobkowitz, Kryštof Fictum of Fictum and above all Kryštof Harant of Polžice and Bezdružice.
