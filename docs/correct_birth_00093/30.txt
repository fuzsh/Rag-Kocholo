Helena Sukova was born with tennis in her blood: her mother, Vera, reached the Wimbledon final in 1962; her brother, Cyril, played on the ATP World Tour, and they teamed up to win three Grand Slam mixed doubles titles together.

In 1999, Sukova helped re-establish the International Lawn Tennis Club of the Czech Republic and became its President - and she still holds that position today. From 2001 to 2008, she served as a co-opted member of the Executive Committee of the Council of International Clubs. She has remained active in the further development of tennis in the Czech Republic and is co-founder of the Kids and Junior Tennis Advancement Organization in the Czech Republic. She served on the presidium of the Czech Olympians' Club from 2001 to 2008. Additionally, she is a member of the Champions for Peace Club, a group of famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport Organization.

Sukova got her University doctor degree as a psychologist and since February 2011 serves as a Vice President of the Association of Sport Psychologists in the Czech Republic, and serves on the working group of the Task Force on Sport Psychology of the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations. She works as a psychologist on a regular basis with her clientele, who range from non-sporting circles to former or current professional athletes.
