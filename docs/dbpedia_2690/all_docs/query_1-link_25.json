        "text": "WASHINGTON — In honoring the actor Jon Voight, an outspoken Trump supporter, with the National Medal of the Arts on Thursday, President Trump described him as “somebody I happen to really like.”\n\nIn introducing the author James Patterson as a recipient of the National Humanities Medal, Mr. Trump called him “another friend of mine,” although he failed to mention that Mr. Patterson was also a dues-paying member of his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nThe Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank whose alumni have gone on to serve in the Trump administration, also received a humanities award.\n\nAnd in his remarks about Sharon Percy Rockefeller, a longtime advocate for public broadcasting and the former president and chief executive of WETA in the Washington area, who was also chosen as an arts medal recipient, Mr. Trump joked that “maybe I’ll start getting good publicity” from shows like “PBS NewsHour” and “Washington Week.”\n\n“They tend to be on the other side of things, a little bit,” he added. “I think now I have a better chance.”\n\nThroughout a brief and relatively sedate ceremony in the East Room presenting medals celebrating the arts and humanities for the first time since he assumed office, the president made it clear that his own relationship to the artists or patrons of the arts, and their support for him, were front of mind as much as their collective contributions to society.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
