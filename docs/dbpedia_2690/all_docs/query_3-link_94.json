        "text": "Teresa Lozano Long—Texas civic leader, educator, and philanthropist—has been recognized as a 2019 National Humanities Medalist. Long was presented with her award by President Donald Trump during a ceremony at the White House on November 21, 2019. The citation distinguishes Long \"for supporting the arts and improving educational opportunities. Through scholarships and philanthropy, she has helped America's children and young adults learn the skills they need to succeed.\"\n\nThe National Humanities Medal was inaugurated in 1997 and honors individuals or groups whose work has deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities and broadened our citizens' engagement with history, literature, languages, philosophy, and other humanities subjects. It is one of the country's highest civilian honors.\n\nTexas natives Teresa Lozano Long and her husband, Joe R. Long, are known statewide for their philanthropy. Together they founded The Long Foundation, which supports programs that provide young Texans with educational opportunities. They also endowed the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies at The University of Texas at Austin, widely considered the best Latin American studies program in the country.\n\nThis year's other medalists are best-selling author James Patterson, award-winning chef Patrick J. O’Connell, and the Claremont Institute, an educational think tank."
