        "text": "President Biden hinted at running for reelection during remarks at an award ceremony on Tuesday honoring achievements in the arts and humanities.\n\nBiden has said he intends to run for a second term the 2024 presidential election, but has not announced his final decision on the matter.\n\nWhile handing out medals on Tuesday, he praised author Colson Whitehead, who won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 2017 and again in 2020 — one of only four people to have won the honor twice.\n\n\"Pretty good, man!\" Biden told Whitehead. \"I'm kind of looking for back-to- back myself,\" a quip that evoked laughter and applause in the East Room.\n\nIt was one of many light-hearted moments in an event marking the accomplishments of 21 people and organizations. \"You're amazing. And you do make this country better. You make it a better place,\" Biden said.\n\nSome of the recipients had a personal connection to Biden, like actor Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who starred in HBO television show \"Veep,\" which premiered at a time when Biden himself was vice president. Louis-Dreyfus spoke at the Democratic National Convention where Biden was nominated.\n\nWriter Richard Blanco read his poem, One Today, during former President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2013. Mindy Kaling is known for a role she played in \"The Office,\" set in Scranton, Penn., Biden's hometown.\n\nAnd he ribbed Bruce Springsteen for being from New Jersey, next to his beloved state of Delaware, noting his first performance was at an Elks Lodge in Freehold, N.J. \"I know where it is — Freehold, New Jersey. Just across the river. I've been to Freehold. And I married a Jersey girl,\" Biden said, referring to first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBiden joked that he is introduced to fashion designer Vera Wang every time he opens the closet. \"There's all those labels,\" he said. \"I know your dresses always look beautiful on my wife, God love her.\"\n\nBiden also recognized Fred Eychaner for his contributions to dance, architecture, arts education and LGBTQI+ advocacy. Eychaner is a major donor to the Democratic party.\n\nBiden previously gave the National Humanities Medal to Sir Elton John in September 2022 at a special White House performance.\n\nHere is the full list of winners:\n\nNational Medal of Arts\n\nJudith Francisca Baca, artist\n\nFred Eychaner, philanthropist\n\nJose Feliciano, musician\n\nMindy Kaling, actor\n\nGladys Knight, musician\n\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus, actor\n\nAntonio Martorell-Cardona, painter\n\nJoan Shigekawa, producer and arts administrator\n\nBruce Springsteen, musician\n\nVera Wang, designer\n\nThe Billie Holiday Theatre\n\nThe International Association of Blacks in Dance\n\nNational Humanities Medal"
