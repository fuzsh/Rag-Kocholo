        "text": "President Obama has announced that nine individuals will receive the National Humanities Medal at a White House ceremony on Monday July 28. Winners of the National Humanities Medal are honored for outstanding achievements in “history, cultural studies, filmmaking, cultural commentary, and historic preservation.” Among the nine individuals winners are two African Americans. One of the two African American winners has current ties to the academic world.\n\nDarlene Clark Hine is a professor of history and professor of African American studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. She is being honored for “enriching our understanding of the African American experience.” The citation accompanying the award states that, “through prolific scholarship and leadership, Dr. Hine has examined race, class, and gender and shown how the struggles and successes of African American women shaped the Nation we share today.”\n\nProfessor Hine is the author of many books including Hine Sight: Black Women and the Re-Construction of American History (Indiana University Press, 1996). Before joining the faculty at Northwestern University in 2004, Professor Hine taught at Michigan State University for 17 years. She is a graduate of Roosevelt University in Chicago and holds a master’s degree and a Ph.D. from Kent State University in Ohio.\n\nLatest News\n\nAnita Thomas Resigns as President of North Central College\n\nAnita Thomas has resigned as president of North Central College in Illinois after one year in the position. When she assumed her presidency in July 2023, she became the first-ever woman and person of color to lead the college.\n\nSignificant Increases in Homicides Partly Responsible for Racial Disparities in Life Expectancy During COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the United States experienced a 30 percent increase in homicides - the largest one-year increase in over century. A new study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has found this increase was largely responsible for the widened Black-White life expectancy gap during the pandemic.\n\nSignificant Drop in Black First-Year Enrollments at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has announced that just 5 percent of its entering class is Black. This is down from an average of 13 percent Black over the last four admissions cycles.\n\nSocioeconomic Factors that Influence Black-White Achievement Gap Among Elementary Students\n\nThe report authors write, \"The time to act is now. By enacting comprehensive and inclusive policies, we can narrow achievement gaps and create a more just educational landscape for the next generation.\""
