        "text": "President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will present Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright August Wilson with a 1999 National Humanities Medal at a special ceremony on the south lawn of the White House Sept. 29 at 11 AM. A White House dinner in honor of Wilson and the seven other National Humanities Medalists will be held that evening.\n\nThe other 1999 National Humanities Medal recipients are librarian Patricia M. Battin, Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and journalist Taylor Branch, scholar and historian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, author and Prairie Home Companion host Garrison Keillor, journalist and broadcaster Jim Lehrer, political philosopher John Rawls, and Academy Award-winning filmmaker Steven Spielberg.\n\nWilson has won two Pulitzer Prizes, the first in 1987 for Fences, and the second in 1990 for The Piano Lesson.. The NEH characterized Wilson as an influential promoter of the advancement and preservation of black theatre and performing arts, and a playwright whose works \"present an epic story of the black experience in America over the course of a century.\"\n\n“The 1999 National Humanities Medalists are distinguished individuals who have set the highest standards for American cultural achievement,” said William R. Ferris, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which sponsors the award. “They are gifted people with extraordinary powers of creativity and vision, and their work in preserving, interpreting and expanding the nation’s cultural heritage represents an incalculable public service.\""
