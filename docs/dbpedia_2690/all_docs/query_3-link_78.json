        "text": "Elton John has been honoured with the National Humanities Medal for his longtime work towards HIV and AIDS efforts.\n\nThe legendary musician was given the award at the White House in Washington D.C. by US President Joe Biden on Friday evening (September 23).\n\nAt the event, dubbed ‘A Night When Hope and History Rhyme’, John played a special live set including his hits ‘Your Song’, ‘Tiny Dancer’, ‘Rocket Man’ and ‘I’m Still Standing’. Biden surprised the artist by appearing onstage to present him with the National Humanities Medal.\n\nJohn was visibly shocked and emotional, covering his face and wiping away tears as the audience clapped and cheered. In a message that was read out during the ceremony, the singer was praised “for moving our souls with his powerful voice and one of the defining song books of all time”.\n\nThe message continued: “An enduring icon and advocate with absolute courage, who found purpose to challenge convention, shatter stigma and advance the simple truth – that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”\n\nJohn, who founded the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, then said he was “flabbergasted, humbled and honoured by this incredible award from the United States of America”, adding: “I will treasure this so much, and it will make me double my efforts to make sure this disease goes away.”\n\nIn a statement, John explained: “It’s been emotional for me to be recognised for the achievements of the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Since I founded the Foundation at my kitchen table in Atlanta 30 years ago, I made a commitment not to leave anyone behind and will continue on this mission.\n\n“We are striving for a future where people of all races, ethnicities, nationalities, sexual orientations, and gender identities have the opportunity to live free from AIDS, stigma, injustice and maltreatment – and I’m so grateful recognition likes this brings us a step closer to making that a reality.”"
