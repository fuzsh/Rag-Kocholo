Each year, the NEH invites medalist nominations from individuals and organizations across the country. The National Council on the Humanities – NEH’s presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed advisory body – reviews the nominations and provides recommendations to the President, who selects the recipients.\n\nCreated as an independent federal agency in 1965, NEH awards grants that support research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities. NEH is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year."
