        "text": "Yesterday we wrote about the National Medal for the Humanities winners. And today we have pitchas. Here’s Kay Ryan, looking spiffy, accepting the award at the White House ceremony.\n\nBut wait a minute! We hadn’t mentioned the National Medal for the Arts yet … or rather we did, because George Lucas and Tony Kushner were in fact winners of the arts medal, not the humanities medal.\n\nJust to sort everything out, here’s the complete list for both:\n\n2012 National Medal of Arts: Herb Alpert, Lin Arison, Joan Myers Brown, Renée Fleming, Ernest J. Gaines, Ellsworth Kelly, Tony Kushner, George Lucas, Elaine May, Laurie Olin, Allen Toussaint, and the Washington Performing Arts Society, Washington, DC.\n\n2012 National Humanities Medal: Edward L. Ayers, William G. Bowen, Jill Ker Conway, Natalie Zemon Davis, Frank Deford, Joan Didion, Robert Putnam, Marilynne Robinson, Kay Ryan, Robert B. Silvers, Anna Deavere Smith, Camilo José Vergara.\n\nAnother familiar face is buried behind the “Washington Performing Arts Society”: President and CEO Jennifer Bilfield (not Jenny Bellfield, as the subtitle says) accepts the award on behalf of the organization in photo at right – you can read more about the society here.\n\nBut bleccchhh… some of the bland clichés that were offered to presumably reward excellence and innovation in the texts! Robinson writes about “universal truths about what it means to be human.” The Washington Performing Arts Society has “inspired generations of young performers to follow their passion” – and follow their bliss, too, I’ll bet. Silvers, co-founder of the New York Review of Books, “elevated the book review to a literary art form.” So what about Edmund Wilson, Randall Jarrell, and a few others writing well before the NYRB launch in 1963?"
