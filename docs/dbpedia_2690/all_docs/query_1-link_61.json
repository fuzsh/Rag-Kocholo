        "text": "Born in Ukraine, Dr Olga Boichak researches the role of media, data, and technologies in contemporary military conflicts, as well as digital sovereignty and digital infrastructure in wars, in the School of Arts, Communication and English at the University of Sydney.\n\n\"I’m interested in the role of social media across the participative war spectrum,\" Dr Boichak said. \"This refers to the fact that anyone with an internet-connected device can participate in wars in different ways, by sharing information or mobilising people for humanitarian support or engaging in open-source intelligence.\"\n\nHer research also extends into how communication infrastructure — such as cables and satellites — and data can be used by adversaries in \"unprecedented ways in contemporary wars.\"\n\nDr Boichak’s research has previously been honoured with a Fulbright Fellowship and an Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA).\n\n\"I’m grateful to my nominators and all those who have supported me on this journey,\" said Dr Boichak. \"I am heartened to see the Australian Academy of the Humanities recognise the importance of public scholarship surrounding Ukraine at this time. The Max Crawford Medal gives me strength to continue this research and support other early-career scholars working at the intersection between war and media.\"\n\nDr Boichak will dedicate the medal to the hundreds of Ukrainian scholars who have lost their lives to the Russian invasion.\n\n\"Olga Boichak is an outstanding recipient of the Crawford Medal,\" said Emeritus Professor John Griffiths FAHA, Chair of the Selection Committee. \"The impact of her research is far-reaching, and it deals with major societal issues inherent with internet use — they go to our core humanitarian values and the fundamentals of our democratic society.\n\n\"Not only is it intelligent research, but it is also brave and bold in its focus on the current conflict threatening the existence of Ukraine. It is an outstanding example of the impact of humanities researchers in matters of urgent global concern and great human import.\"\n\nVice-Chancellor and President Professor Mark Scott congratulated Dr Boichak on her achievement. \"Dr Boichak’s dedication and passion to the humanities is truly inspiring. Dedicating this honour to the Ukrainian researchers who have perished since the 2022 invasion is a powerful and poignant gesture. Her work not only honours their memory but also highlights the resilience and importance of academic pursuits even in the face of adversity. We are deeply proud to have Dr Boichak as a part of the University of Sydney community.\"\n\nDr Boichak will be formally presented with the Max Crawford Medal at the 2024 Annual Academy Dinner in Canberra on Thursday 14 November.\n\nAbout the Australian Academy of the Humanities\n\nThe Australian Academy of the Humanities is the national body for the humanities in Australia, with a Fellowship of over 730 of Australia’s leading humanities scholars. The Academy is one of Australia’s five Learned Academies – independent organisations established to encourage excellence in their respective fields and to provide expertise and advice at public, institutional and government levels."
