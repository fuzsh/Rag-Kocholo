        "text": "The National Humanities Medal is an award that is given to people or groups that have helped Americans learn from and enjoy the Humanities. The award is given by the President of the United States. One version of the award was first given out in 1988. It was called the Charles Frankel Prize in the Humanities. In 1997 it was renamed as the National Humanities Medal.[1]\n\nIn any year, the President may name as many as twelve people or groups to get the medal. The number of awards is different for each President. For example, President Obama gave 71 medals between 2009 and 2015, but President Trump only gave 7 medals in 2019 and 2020.[2]\n\nAward winners\n\n[change | change source]\n\nSome well-known people who have gotten the medal are singer Elton John, musician Wynton Marsalis, novelist Madeleine L'Engle, chef Alice Waters, poet John Ashbery, historian Henry Louis Gates, Jr., and film director Steven Spielberg.[3]"
