        "text": "SORG is a full service architectural firm based in Washington, DC and founded by renowned architect Suman Sorg. We have won over 60 awards from the American Institute of Architects and other national associations. Our projects have been featured in numerous national publications such as Architectural Record, Metropolis Magazine and the Washington Post. SORG has been ranked among the top 50 architecture firms in the US by Architect Magazine for a commitment to sustainable design and for positively impacting our community.

With numerous repeat clients we have established a reputation for design excellence and dedicated service to the fulfilment of each clients goals.\n\nPhilosophy\n\nFor our founder, Suman Sorg, design excellence is portable. No matter a project’s scale, scope, location, program or budget, she approaches each client and each project as unique, while drawing from her extraordinary experience in designing projects of all types over her architecture career. Suman’s focus on the user is human-centered first – respecting the dignity and wellbeing of every individual – program-focused – meeting client needs at the outset – and rooted in environmental sustainability. Her work characterized by a strong commitment to thoughtful modern architecture that explores spatial, material and visual experience. Rather than imposing a style, irrespective of context, she carefully examines the unique characteristics of each project (site, climate, culture, community), along with programmatic requirements, and look to this intersection as the catalyst for an architectural concept. Deeply invested in creating modern designs that are sculptural, and often monumental, her work is always geared towards the human scale. A legacy of work in historic preservation and interest in vernacular architecture complements Suman’s modernist leanings. By combining contemporary architecture techniques and design strategies with the innovative handling of both traditional architectural language and indigenous building materials, she creates compositions are both functional and inspiring.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nWashington Post, “How D.C.’s First Sobering Center Could Ease Drug and Alcohol Addiction” February 13, 2024\n\nWashingtonian Magazine, “Look Inside 12 of the Coolest Houses in Washington” August 8, 2017 (John & Jill Ker Conway Residence)\n\nArchitectureDC, “Pushing the (Building) Envelope” Summer 2017 (John & Jill Ker Conway Residence)\n\nThe Washington Post, “After years on the streets, homeless vets in D.C. get new building to call their own” January 11, 2017 (John & Jill Ker Conway Residence)\n\nDC Rising Magazine, Top Women to Watch in Real Estate 2016, Suman Sorg, FAIA\n\nArchitectureDC, “Details, Details: Jury Creates a Special Category for Outstanding Building Elements” Winter 2015 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nArchitectureDC, “Rec Meets Hi-Tech: Suburban Complex Offers Place for Leisure and Learning” Spring 2015 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nLuxe DC Magazine, “Mixed Media” April 2014 (Apartment One)\n\nRecreation Management, “Survival of the Fittest – Keys to Successful Fitness Facility Management” February 2014 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nA Magazine, “Capital Living” February 2014 (Apartment One)\n\nWashingtonian Magazine,“Anacostia High School Snags Design Award” February 2014 (Anacostia High School) Washingtonian Magazine,“Anacostia High School Snags Design Award” February 2014 (Anacostia High School)\n\nParks & Recreation, “High-Tech Rec” January 2014 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nArchiScene, “Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex by Sorg Architects” January 2014 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nArchitectural Record, “India: Boom or Bust?” December 2013 (Sorg Architects, The Grand Arch)\n\nAmerican School & University, “2013 Architectural Portfolio” November 2013 (Anacostia High School)\n\nArchDaily, “Southern Regional / Sorg Architects” November 6, 2013 (Southern Regional Technology & Recreation Complex)\n\nThe Washington Post, “Renovation Writes a New Chapter in an Apartment’s History“ November 2, 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nDesign & Arredo, “Bianco A Colori“ October 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nArchitects + Artisans, “In Washington, DC, Apartment One” September 23, 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nInhabitant, “Sorg Architects’ Rockaways Water Dyke Concept Harnesses Surge Waters Themselves to Fight Flooding” August 2013 (Water Dyke)\n\nDesign Milk, “Historic Apartment Meets Modern Times” August 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nBeverly Willis Architecture Foundation, “Built By Women: Skyon” August 2013 (Skyon)\n\nHome Design Magazine, “Modern & Historic Combination by Sorg Architects” August 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nAEC Café, “Skyon in Gurgaon, India by Sorg Architects” August 2013 (Skyon)\n\nAEC Café, “The Water Dyke MOMA PS1 Rockaways Call for Ideas Winning” July 2013 (Water Dyke)\n\nModern Luxury DC, “Designing Women” by Jennifer Sergent, May 2013 (Suman Sorg)\n\nWashingtonian Magazine, Apartment One, July 2013 (Apartment One)\n\nArchDaily, “MoMa PS1 Water Dyke” July 3, 2013 (Water Dyke)\n\nMetropolis Magazine, “The Messy Suburb” March 2012 (The Grand Arch)\n\nAIA DC, Centennial Medal, Suman Sorg, FAIA 2014\n\nCODA Awards: Residential, Apartment One, 2014\n\nAmerican School + University, Outstanding Designs: Renovation/Modernization, Bruce-Monroe Elementary School, 2014"
