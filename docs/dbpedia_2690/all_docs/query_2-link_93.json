        "text": "Oral Histories\n\nIn 1993 SWG received a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation to initiate the current Oral History Program. The grant funded workshops to train SWG members as volunteer interviewers, the purchase of professional recording equipment, transcription of some oral history interviews, and a professional staff member for the early years of the program.\n\nThe MARPAT Foundation subsequently awarded several grants that enabled SWG to continue the Oral History Program with leadership provided by members. Training workshops were held, members conducted additional interviews, and all interviews were transcribed, including several interviews of SWG members that were audio taped in 1973 and 1974 as part of the celebration of SWG’s fiftieth anniversary.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013 SWG transferred more than 80 interview transcripts to the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress (LOC); original sound recordings of the interviews on audio cassettes and digital audio DVDs were transferred to the Sound Division of the LOC. Locating the interviews at the LOC ensures that the SWG oral history interviews will be widely available to researchers interested in exploration, scientific discovery, the careers of women, and the history of SWG. One of the interviews listed below and recordings of some other interviews are under restrictions and are available only at the SWG headquarters.\n\nOral History Summaries\n\nValeria Marie Absalonova (d. 1988), geographer, writer, and lecturer.
