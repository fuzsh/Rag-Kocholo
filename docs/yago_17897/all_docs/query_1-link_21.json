        "text": "June 22 of 1941 divided the life of the country into \"before\" and \"after.\" At that time \"Lenfilm\" had just finished the shooting of a musical comedy \"Anton Ivanovich is angry\" and the drama \"Masquerade\". The studio’s future plans included films about peaceful life.\n\nAlready on June 24, \"Lenfilm\" started shooting the first Soviet military movies: \"The girl from Leningrad\" and “The combat movie-collection”.\n\nOn August 8, 1941 the Government decided to evacuate \"Lenfilm\" to Alma-Ata, where the Central United Film Studio was established.\n\nSome of the Leningrad filmmakers were evacuated to Tashkent and Baku, where they actively worked for the local film studios.\n\nAmong the movies, created during the war by Lenfilm staff:\n\n\"The Defense of Tsaritsyn\" (1942, directed by Vasilyev brothers)\n\n\"His Name Is Sukhe-Bator\" (1942, directed by Aleksandr Zarkhi and Iosif Kheifits)\n\n\"She Defends The Motherland\" (1943, directed by Fridrikh Ermler)\n\n\"Submarine T-9\" (1943, directed by Aleksandr Ivanov)\n\n\"The Actress\" (1943, directed by Leonid Trauberg)\n\n\"The Front\" (1943, directed by Vasilyev brothers)\n\n\"Malakhov Kurgan\" (1944, directed by Aleksandr Zarkhi and Iosif Kheifits), and others.\n\nOn January 25, 1944, two days before the complete liberation of Leningrad from the enemy blockade, the Council of People's Commissars made a decision to start rebuilding the “Lenfilm studio.\n\nSix months later, the restored \"Lenfilm\" had already begun shooting the movie \"Marine Battalion\", released in the same year. It was the first post-war \"Lenfilm\" film.\n\nThe exhibition shows rare photographs taken during the filming of war movies in different years and of the restoration of \"Lenfilm\"; all of those are real evidence of the fighting and artifacts of the filming. On the screen you can see footage of the legendary movies about the war.\n\nThe decoration of the hall recreates in detail the room in which filmmakers lived and worked during the Blockade of Leningrad."
