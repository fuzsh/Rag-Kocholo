Faces, feet, mud, singers, soldiers, guns. Projected time and again.\n\nBabylon is described in the subtitles as the name of a department store. The owner (D. Gutman) is allowed plenty of footage in which to sip liquor monotonously or adjust his top hat. Nearest line to the story is an extemporaneous romance suddenly springing up between the soldier Jean and a sales girl. Between the triple exposures the couple are brought together.\n\nAt the crucial period Jean is with the Nationals who, licked by the Prussians, are now dealing with the Commune, the political faction within. At the finis, Jean and the store girl are again brought together. He is her grave digger and she is one of the targets for the firing squad.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nPicture claims it follows episodically events in the Franco-Prussian war and Commune activities in 1871."
