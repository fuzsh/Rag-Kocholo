When he went to art school in Petrograd he met Sergei Yutkevich, and the two boys joined with Leonid Trauberg to found FEKS, the Factory of the Eccentric Actor. They produced a book on Eccentrism, \"published in Eccentropolis (formerly Petrograd),\" and they produced all sorts of street theater, an amalgam of music hall, jazz, circus, and posters, meanwhile exhibiting their paintings at avant-garde shows.\n\nKozintsev was barely nineteen when he and Trauberg brought all this flashy modernism, their love of tricks and devices, their commitment to a new society, and their boundless energy together in their first film, The Adventures of Oktyabrina. Through their next few productions the two young directors perfected their art, learned how to control the fireworks, and developed a mature style which, however, never lost its distinctive FEKS flavor.\n\nIn The New Babylon, a story about the Paris Commune of 1870, largely set in a fantastic department store, they reached that standard of excellence only achieved by the greatest silent films: in complete control of the medium, using Enei's brilliant art direction to the full, but peopling a gripping story with human characters only the correct degree larger than life that the medium demanded. A young composer, Shostakovich, was commissioned to write the accompanying score.\n\nKozintsev and Trauberg were themselves a little disappointed with their first sound film, Alone, a contemporary subject, although it was by no means a failure and it at least brought Shostakovich to the notice of the world at large. For the Maxim Trilogy they returned to an \"historical-revolutionary\" subject with tremendous success, building on their own experience with New Babylon, but completely integrating sound and dialogue rather than merely adding them to the previous recipe.\n\nSadly, the trilogy was really the last work of this highly successful partnership; their Plain People, about the wartime evacuation of a Leningrad factory to Central Asia, ran into serious official trouble and, although completed in 1945, was not released until 1956 in a version that Kozintsev refused to acknowledge.\n\nFor the rest of his independent career he remained loyal to the Leningrad studios and, perhaps because of the troubles with Plain People, devoted himself exclusively to historical or literary themes. After two \"biopics\"—Pirogov and Belinski—he turned to Don Quixote, which was well received at home and abroad. His Hamlet, with its brooding Scandinavian background, superb photography, and beautifully handled acting, won even wider international acclaim, as did his even more brooding and original King Lear. These films were not merely very accomplished interpretations of Shakespeare's plays: they were the result of Kozintsev's own \"brooding,\" years of deep research and careful thought, electrified, however, by equally profound emotions—the final flowering, in fact, of that enthusiastic fifteen-year-old in Kiev.\n\nKozintsev himself wrote to Yutkevich after King Lear, \"I am certain that every one of us . . . in the course of his whole life, shoots a single film of his own. This film of one's own is made . . . in your head, through other work, on paper . . . in conversation: but it lives, breathes, somehow prolongs into old age something that began its existence in childhood!\" And indeed King Lear still combines Kozintsev's original emotionalism with his commitment to a cause; it is no accident that, despite its humanistic values, the film can be analyzed in terms of dialectical materialism.\n\nKozintsev's enthusiasm never deserted him. Not long before his death, after a private London showing of King Lear, the director was asked a question about which translation of the play he had used. Kozintsev, waving his arms in excitement, his eyes flashing, his voice rising several octaves, launched himself into a passionate eulogy and defense of the officially discredited poet Boris Pasternak. So Kozintsev was an \"eccentric actor\" to the last—but, as always, with a deep concern for humanity and truth, regardless of any personal consequences.\n\n—Robert Dunbar"
