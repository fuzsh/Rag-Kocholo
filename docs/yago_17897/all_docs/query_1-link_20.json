        "text": "Because Soviet Montage is so entwined with the history of the U.S.S.R. and the Russian Revolution, reading up on the early beginnings of the movement can feel more like a history in politics and propaganda than the history of making films, but this is bound to happen when a state attempts to seize complete control of a nation's entire film industry's production, distribution and exhibition. The ways in which communism shaped the use of montage theory is inseparable to the movement as a whole, and without the historical context it would be hard to differentiate the desires of the Soviet Union and the experimental intrigue from filmmakers residing within it. While France and Germany embraced avant garde cinematic techniques immediately after WWI, the political turmoil of the U.S.S.R. meant that Russia would not have a coherent, sustainable movement until the 1920s.\n\nAfter the Bolshevik revolution, Narkompros (the People' Commissariat of Education) was established until the new government could take complete control the film industry. The Soviet Union was still in a state of civil war at this point, and the industry continued to struggle. Lenin would finally nationalize the film industry entirely in 1919, causing production companies to be dissolved. This meant, however, that an entire generation of filmmakers would disappear. With this in mind, the nation's State Film School was founded in the same year, and director Lev Kuleshov, who had previously made an impression with his film Engineer Prite's Project, was invited to create his own workshop within the institute. His task was to train those who the Soviets deemed more important to the film industry, including filmmakers and actors alike.\n\nUnder the New Economic Policy, a limited amount of privately owned production companies were allowed to create films. By this time, the government had placed film as a priority, with Lenin famously saying \"Of all the arts, for us the cinema is most important.\"\n\nKino-Eye (1924) by director Dziga Vertov\n\nAlso set in Moscow during the years of the New Economic Policy, Your Acquaintance shows a journalist falling in love with the officer of an industrial plant. Her infatuation has catastrophic results, as the true nature of the officer is revealed. Meanwhile, she has no idea that a modest editor, working for the 'working inventions' department, has been in love with her for a very long time.\n\nMoscow in October (1927) Moskva v oktyabre by director Boris Barnet\n\nBarnet's Moscow in October was released in time to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the October Revolution, telling the historical events from 1917 until the creation of the Council of People's Commissars. However, the film was notably unpopular upon release.\n\nThe Diplomatic Pouch (1927) Sumka dipkuryera by director Alexander Dovzhenko\n\nIn documentary style, events in Petrograd are re-enacted from the end of the monarchy in February of 1917 to the end of the provisional government and the decrees of peace and of land in November of that year. Lenin returns in April. In July, counter-revolutionaries put down a spontaneous revolt, and Lenin's arrest is ordered. By late October, the Bolsheviks are ready to strike: ten days will shake the world. While the Mensheviks vacillate, an advance guard infiltrates the palace. Anatov-Oveyenko leads the attack and signs the proclamation dissolving the provisional government.\n\nIn 1929, Sergei Eisenstein would travel abroad and would not return to the U.S.S.R. until 1932.\n\nLace (1928) Kruzheva by director Sergei Yutkevich\n\nBased on Mark Kolosov's Stengaz, the film centers on Komsomol members in a lace factory that collectively decide to start a newspaper. Meanwhile, an activist tries to persuade a gang leader to change his ways.\n\nThe New Babylon (1929) Novyy Vavilon by directors Grigori Kozinstev & Leonid Trauberg\n\nFocusing on a shipyard worker belonging to the German Communist Party, Deserter tells the story of a man encouraged by the U.S.S.R. to demand more from his employers. This leads to an enduring worker's strike and brawls with the police. Although the shipyard worker proves to be cowardly, he ultimately joins the cause with fierce determination. Deserter was Pudovkin's first sound picture.\n\nThe Five-Year Plan and the End of Soviet Montage Cinema\n\nThroughout the movement, several domestic titles had become popular outside of the Soviet Union. Although the number of films produced was increasing, criticism from government officials was also mounting. Industry officials would often call these films with 'formalism', accusing them of being incomprehensible to the masses - and therefore far less useful for the Soviet Union's purposes. In particular, Sovkino and Lunacharsky came under fire for making films that would appeal to foreigners more than their comrades. It also frustrated officials that film theory was presumably more important to montage filmmakers than their government's ideological messages. In this way, it was ironically the international success of these films that ultimately led to governmental criticism and the end of the movement.\n\nKuleshov was among the first to be accused of formalist values, followed by Vertov, prior to making Man with a Movie Camera. Eisenstein's prestigious reputation as the director of Battleship Potemkin protected him for a time, but he also joined the accused with later releases. Then, the Soviet Union introduced the Five Year-Plan, which hoped to expand the industry's international success and eventually put a stop to the exhibition of all imported titles.\n\nThe Soviet Union's goal was to use film to appeal to the masses, and in the early 1930s their official policy shifted all domestic production towards Socialist Realism. Filmmakers had no choice but to adopt commercial frameworks for their productions, which would dominate Russian cinema between 1933 and 1945.\n\nReferences\n\nJay Leyda (1960).
