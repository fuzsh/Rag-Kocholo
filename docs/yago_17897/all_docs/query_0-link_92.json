        "text": "In this article, Emma Widdis suggests that a sensory history is a crucial counterpart to the recent emotional turn in Russian and Slavic scholarship on Russian and Slavic history and culture. In particular, the Soviet revolutionary project was a unique attempt to create new models of human experience to correspond to the new political order—an attempt to shape sensory experience itself. Widdis suggests that the still-young medium of cinema was a privileged site for the investigation of new models of sensory perception, for the working out of the problematic relationship between the body, the mind, and the world that had such ideological potency in early Soviet Russia. Linking close readings of little-known films from this period to a broader analysis of the discursive field within which they operated, Widdis suggests that, in the period of transition between 1928 and 1932, intensified sensory (and particularly tactile) experience emerged as a new and revolutionary mode of being in the world.\n\n3. Sensory history outside the Slavic field is a rich field, too dense to detail fully here. One might note, however, the pioneering work by cultural anthropologists: David Howes, Sensual Relations: Engaging the Senses in Culture and Social Theory (Ann Arbor, 2003); Classen, Constance, Worlds of Sense: Exploring the Senses in History and across Cultures (London, 1993)Google Scholar; and Constance Classen, The Book of Touch (London, 2005). In history, core work has been done by Mark M. Smith, Sensing the Past: Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and Touching in History (Berkeley, 2008), and the special issue of the fournal of Social History 40, no. 4 (Summer 2007) is dedicated to work in the history of the senses. The journal Senses and Society provides one of several other fora in which scholarship in sensory history is published and discussed. In Slavic studies, key works to note in this field include: Vladimir V. Lapin, Peterburg: Zapakhi i zvuki (St. Petersburg, 2007); Alexander M. Martin, “Sewage and the City: Filth, Smell, and Representations of Urban Life in Moscow, 1770-1880,” Russian Review67, no. 2 (April 2008): 243-74; Alison K. Smith, Recipes for Russia: Food andNationhood under the Tsars (DeKalb, 2008).\n\n4. The conference took place 15-21 March 1928; minutes were published a year later as a volume: B. S. Ol'khovyi, ed., Puti kino: Vsesoiuznoe partiinoe soveshchanie po kinematografii (Moscow, 1929).

In particular, Bliakhin demanded clearer attention to the “distinguishing characteristics” of the new byt, as produced by the conditions of urban labor.\n\n6. N.

In 1930, Adrian Piotrovskii made a speech at the Komakademiia, also published, in which he distinguished two “tendencies” in Soviet Činema during its first decade: “intellectualism” (exemplified by the work of Sergei Eisenstein) and “emotionalism” (of which directors Aleksandr Dovzhenko, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Ivan Cherviakov were representatives) .

The publication was a transcript of a speech presented to the Komakademiia on 22 April 1933. Both Iezuitov and Bleiman made frequent reference to Piotrovskii, “Khudozhestvennye techeniia v sovetskom kino.“\n\n21. Many articles on psychology were published in major newspapers: see, for example, 1. V Frankford, “G. I. Chelpanov v roli ‘Marksista-psikhologa,'” Pravda, 24 October 1926, 2. See David Joravsky, Russian Psychology: A Critical History (Oxford, 1989), 210, 224, 505n 4. According to Margarete Vohringer, of 55 institutions organized by Narkompros during the 1920s, 24 were explicidy linked to physiology and psychology: Margarete Vöhringer, “Professionalisiertes Laientum: Nikolaj Ladovskijs Psychotechnisches Labor fur Architektur,“ in Matthias Schwarz, Wladimir Velminski, and Torben Philipp, eds., Laien, Lektiiren, Laboratorien: Künste und Wissenschaften in Russland 18600960 (Frankfurt, 2008), 333.\n\n31. The dominant movement in Soviet psychology before 1930 was the study of reflexes— the study of the physiological responses of the human subject to objective stimuli, and their link with cognition and emotion. The predominance of discussion of “reflexes,“ as Irina Sirotkina has shown, reflects the materialist “fashion” that dominated debate in many fields in Soviet Russia in this period. Sirotkina, Irina, “The Ubiquitous Reflex and Its Critics in Post-Revolutionary Russia,” Berichte zur Wissenschaftsgeschichte 32, no. 1 (March 2009): 70–81.CrossRefGoogle ScholarPubMed Itwas this principle that underlay “psychotechnics” (psikhotekhnika) and “Industrial Psychology” (the “practical” application of psychological knowledge), most famously realized in Aleksei Gastev's experiments in his Central Institute of Labor (Tsentral'nyi institut truda), which sought to create the optimal conditions for efficient, rationalized labor processes.\n\n36.

See Barbara Wurm, “Gastevs Medien: Das ‘Foto-Kino-Labor’ des CIT,“ in Schwarz, Velminski, and Philipp, eds., Laien, Lektüren, Laboratorien, 347-93.

Oksana Bulgakowa has also worked extensively on film's “sensory” apparatus: Oksana Bulgakova, Sovetskii slukhoglas: Kino i ego organy chuvstv (Moscow, 2010). Note also that much has been written about Eisenstein's theories of perception and the extent to which his notion of “sensuous thought” was influenced by Lev Vygotskii's work on “inner speech“: David Bordwell, “Eisenstein's Epistemological Shift,” Screen 15, no. 4 (1974): 29-46.\n\n43. Irina Grashchenkova, “Vospitanie chuvstv: O stsenarii i fil'me ‘Ukhaby,'” Iz istorii kino (Moscow, 1974), 9:87. The Soviet film industry at this time was still producing historical melodramas such as Ledianoi dom (Ice House, dir. Konstantin Eggert, 1927) and Iurii Tarich's Kryl'ia kholopa (Wings of a Serf, 1926), and the overall repertoire was by no means dominated by the kind of “revolutionary” films exemplified by the work of Eisenstein and other avant-garde directors. Room's Tret'ia Meshchanskaia (Bed and Sofa, 1927) was another film praised for its new direction; Friedrikh Ermler's Parizhskii sapozhnik (The Parisian Shoemaker, 1927) was also much discussed. I have selected Ukhaby and Kruzheva as case studies because of their focus on the faktura of materials, but the broader endeavor certainly extended into the work of other filmmakers, and the work of Ermler and Ivan Cherviakov (Moi syn, [My Son, 1928]) is particularly important in this respect.\n\n47. For an excellent account of the avant-garde understanding of faktura, see Maria Gough, The Artist as Producer: Russian Constructivism in Revolution (Berkeley, 2005). For further analysis of the term in relation to film of this period, see Emma Widdis, “Faktura: Depth and Surface in Early Soviet Set Design,” Studies in Russian and Soviet Činema 3, no. 1 (March 2009): 5-32.\n\n48. Set designer Sergei Kozlovskii, for example, recalled the mid-1920s as a period when he “sought new types of faktura,” emphasizing an interest in different types of material surface. Kozlovskii cited in G. I. Miasnikov, Ocherki istorii sovetskogo kinodekoratsionnogo iskusstva (1918-1930) (Moscow, 1975), 45. In 1925, Sergei Iutkevich criticized the poor quality of Soviet Činematography for not exploiting the faktura of different materials, for making “silk look like calico.” Sergei Iutkevich, “Plat'e kartiny,” Sovetskii ekran, 1925, no. 39: 7.\n\n49. The script was published by Irina Grashchenkova in 1974. Abram Room and Viktor Shklovskii, “Ukhaby,” h istorii kino (Moscow, 1974), 9:96-121. Like Room's two previous films, Predatel’ (The Traitor, 1926), and Tret'ia Meshchanskaia, the screenplay was written by Shklovskii, adapted from a short story by A. Dmitriev. It is notable, indeed, that both Ukhaby and Kruzheva drew their screenplays from short stories by rabkors ﹛rabochie korrespondenty). Brooks, Jeffrey, “Public and Private Values in the Soviet Press, 1921-1928,“ Slavic Review 48, no. 1 (Spring 1989): 16–35;CrossRefGoogle Scholar Gorham, Michael, “Tongue-Tied Writers: The Rabsel'kor Movement and the Voice of the ‘New Intelligentsiia’ in Early Soviet Russia,“ Russian Review 55, no. 3 (July 1996): 412-29.CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n50. (“Worker“) A. Vasil'ev, “Eshche ob ‘Ukhabakh,'” Kino, no. 9 (28 February 1928): 3. The film was not universally considered successful in this respect, however: writing in the leftist Kinofront, M. Shneider accused Room of treating the “moral” and “domestic“ issues of the film in a retrogressive fashion, with its resolution based on traditional bourgeois familial structures: seeing Tania returned to a conventional relationship, rather than liberated and granted her independence. M. Shneider, “Ukhaby,” Kinofront, 1928, no. 1: 19-22.\n\n59. It is no accident that Kruzheva and Ukhaby shared many thematic and formal preoccupations. By 1927, lutkevich had worked twice with Room, serving as set designer for Predatel’ and Tret'ia Meshchanskaia, Shklovskii's influence on both filmmakers was also significant: it was he who suggested that the short story “Stengaz” be adapted into the screenplay for Kruzheva, attracted by the setting of the film in a lace factory, which “set film on ‘materialist’ tracks.” Sergei lutkevich, Sobranie sochinenii v trekh tomakh, vol. 1, Molodost' (Moscow, 1990), 327.\n\n61. L. Vaks, “ODSKnaprosmotre ‘Kruzhev,'” Kino, no. 21 (22 May 1928): 5; “O ‘Kruzhevakh,'“ Kino, no. 17 (24 April 1928): 3. According to lutkevich, Kruzheva was a victim of a dispute between Sovkino and RAPP (Leopold Averbakh, Aleksandr Fadeev, Iurii Libedinskii, Pavel Kirshon), in which members of RAPP accused Sovkino of being market-led. Probably as a result of this difficult time in the studio, the film was negatively received by the Sovkino audiorities, and its release was delayed—but the film was, lutkevich recalls, supported by RAPP. It was eventually released to generally positive acclaim (especially in open meetings held in ODSK (Obshchestvo druzei sovetskogo kino) and ARK (Assotsiatsiia revoliutsionnykh kinematografii). It was also, according to lutkevich himself, responsible for Iutkevich being invited, by Fridrikh (Friedrich) Ermler, to join the Leningrad branch of Sovkino. See Iutkevich, Sobranie sochinenii, 1:331-32.\n\n66. In Eisenstein's October: TenDays That Shook the World (1928), we see a similar juxtaposition of the filigree of lace against block shapes of machinery, when the Women's Battalion hangs a lace bra over the solid blocks of a billiard cue stand. Eisenstein's own interest in filmic faktura, of course, merits much further exploration, as one of the key sources of the avant-garde interest in material.\n\n80. Platonov, “Proletarskaia poeziia,” 523. Platonov defined oshchushchenie and chuvstvo in this essay in terms opposite to those I have proposed here, describing oshchushchenie (along with “intuition“) as a false, subjectively created idea of the world and chuvstvo (along with “consciousness“) as an outwardly directed “true” understanding of the world. See Steinberg, Proletarian Imagination, 130. The complexities of these definitions notwithstanding, what is significant is Platonov's clearly expressed focus on the encounter with the external, material world as the defining condition for the creation of a new subjecthood.\n\n84. I think of the work of Jean Epstein and Dimitri Kirsanoff in particular. Iutkevich, indeed, recalls how he had seen parts of Epstein's Le coeur fidèle (1923) and Kirsanoff's Ménilmontant (1926), brought back from Paris by Il'iaErenburg, and how these films had shown him that everyday life could be “photogenic.” Iutkevich, Sobranie sochinenii, 1:329-30.\n\n105. The film's Činematographer, Andrei Moskvin, used “white on white” Činematography for this film, exploiting a range of pure white tones (usually avoided in black-andwhite Činematography) in order to create what critics describe as a “desaturated screen.“ In the city, Kuz'mina is dressed in a white dress, in sunlit white streets, viewing white crockery. See Kaganovsky, “Voice of Technology,” 274.\n\n106. V. Sutyrin, “Ot intelligentskikh illiuzii k real'noi deistvitel'nosti,” Proletarskoe kino 1931, nos. 5-6: 17. Note that Kozintsev and Trauberg's ShineV also offers an oversized teapot; the crockery displays in Odna can be seen as a dialogue with that film, as well as with the department store in Novyi Vavilon. These intertexts provide further support for the reading of this film as a self-reflexive comment on the ideological implications of FEKS's own visual style.\n\n110. As my director-protagonists entered the 1930s, they went in different directions, presenting different responses to the new demands. In Zlatye gory (Golden Mountains, 1931) and Vstrechnyi (Counterplan, 1932), Iutkevich presented radically simplified sets and clearly defined heroes. For Kozintsev and Trauberg, Odna marked a transition that led to a trilogy of films focusing on an exemplary “individual,” Maksim. Room, in 1936, produced the ill-fated Strogii iunosha (Severe Youth, 1936), a film in which the director's evident interest in the formal properties of tilings and surfaces, his preoccupation with film as a means of sensing the world, brought severe censure.\n\n111. Shmidt's wife, Vera Shmidt, became the head of the Psychoanalytic Kindergarten, which was opened in Moscow in August 1921, and, in 1927, secretary of the Russian Psychoanalytic Society. Etkind points to Shmidt's importance in psychoanalytic circles in particular. Eddnd, Eros of the Impossible, 193-94."
