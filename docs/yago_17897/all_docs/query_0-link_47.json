        "text": "timespace coordinates: post-revolutionary Soviet Union, ten years or so after the October Revolution\n\nDirector: Grigori Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg.\n\nFull orchestral score by Dmitri Shostakovich\n\nWe have covered here the Sino-Soviet Split, Soviet Science Fiction, Tetris, 1990s shock therapy that led to Putin’s Russia (Lenin is according to Putin latest speech the complete anti-hero), and Big Computer Socialism. Now it is time to watch a social realist movie from the early Soviet period about a young teacher Yelena Kuz’mina who is sent to Siberia, or more exactly the Altai mountains to introduce socialism and to alphabetize the local population (which is evidently non-Russian speaking, altough they all seem to speak the same language). Empowerment of women, alphabetization, and education were key elements of the young Soviet state. The movie also depicts three ‘hot’ political topics at the time (or even today?!): education, technology, and the elimination of the kulaks.\n\nWhy watch this movie?\n\nI take my cues mainly for watching this movie from the analysis of Bogdan Popa’s De-centering queer studies: Communist Sexuality in the flow during and after the Cold War (Manchester University Press 2021). It is important to watch these movies that are freely available online, of course, playing them from YT still offers the platform ways to monetize, and streaming still contributes to the climate crisis we are currently in, but considering that Alone is such a low-definition, non-HD movie, I would still follow Bogdan Popa here basically echoing Boris Groys – perhaps the greatest contemporary theoretician of Soviet and post-Soviet art and theory: “Currently, socialist realism and its objects function as an aesthetic avant-garde because they are outside a circuit of cultural incorporation, or so Groys argues”. The ‘sexomarist’ detournement of Stalinist era Alone – is one of my favorite pieces from the book (before I had never seen this movie).\n\n(The most common example of price scissors is from the Soviet Union: agricultural prices continued to fall while industrial goods prices rose)\n\nTo me, Alone is also a movie that reflects the whole dialectic and division between the countryside and the city, or of how the growth of industry and new productive forces were paid for by the peasants (in a classic Price scissors case), something that will early be a point of contention between the Soviets and their Chinese counterparts, even if initially the Chinese followed the Soviet example.\n\nI would also recommend watching this movie in today’s context of current degrowth eco-socialism and solarpunk aesthetics that should openly embrace a communist and anti-capitalist outlook. While there is an inner debate between the eco-modernists (roughly those who still embrace the amenities of modernity for all, but are still tributary to a sort of limitless cornucopian idea of growth) and degrowth socialists (those who roughly question how Global North lifestyles are easily translatable to the Global South and also ask for a climate justice and climate reparations) this movie gives scope to what it means to actually confront the material realities and political contour to the experience of leaving the city and moving to the countryside. Many sent-down youths in China already did this, and some willingly, some forced, but in total this experience left a long impression and brought together people from different milieus, and made them face and address China’s problems, poverty and country/city divisions and make the first steps towards economic reform.\n\nThe movie critiques the residues of the market economy (NEP – New Economic Policy) in the Soviet Union that were part of the Leninist rebuild of the economy during the early days of the young Soviet state. We meet Kuz’mina, the young teacher in Moscow in an ideological setting that the socialists denounced: living alone in a single in Moscow, sleeping in a laced nightgown, easily enchanted by the symbols of comfort, window shopping or eyeing the glittering commodities. The kitchenware shop (think IKEA) is the place where one is seduced by the materiality of consumer objects. Luxury items are part of the exchange economy. >>”Like her the viewer is placed in a position of “refusing the sensory pleasure of a haptic encounter with the material” because they are encouraged to live in a different economy of [socialist] affects.>>\n\nIn Altai, Kuz’mina enters another world because she becomes a producer of things and just a consumer. In the Soviet imaginary, the local Shamanist indigenous people are shown to be “close to the labor production and the material world of objects. This tactile sensuous materiality -this involvement with actually existing communism, its programmatic productivism in terms of bodies or experiences is being bypassed in a lot of recent radical thought (see Frederic Lordon’s communism realism).\n\n“The book [Figures] can also be cursory verging on the cavalier in its stated decision to do without any but the most oblique discussion of ‘actually-existing communism’ – which, whether we’re thinking of workers’ councils, Cuban experiments with medicine, socialist planning, or what have you, certainly harbours pertinent lessons and materials for present debate.” (Alberto Toscano’s review of Lordon’s books)\n\nThat is why it is intersting to see how in Aline the Easterners (while being fully aware of what the East holds for both Imperial and Revolutionary historiography) “grasp, cut and rub wool, and live in a world where they are part of the natural life”. Emma Widdis (from the volume below) “argues that Kuz’mina develops a different sensory relationship to objects when she moves to Altai, which is the springboard for her becoming a communist.” In a sense, Kuz’mina gets educated first, in a more fundamental way leaving back her bourgeois, individualist self, before educating the children of the region.\n\n“Olúfẹmi Táíwò guest hosts an interview with Daniela Gabor and Ndongo Samba Sylla on how financial power has shaped the global economic order under capitalism from colonialism through Bretton Woods, the Washington Consensus, and today’s Wall Street Consensus.\n\nRead Daniela’s work: people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/DanielaGabor\n\nRead Ndongo’s work: rosalux.de/en/profile/es_detail/N8SVHTS8SA/ndongo-samba-sylla?cHash=ccf0c8d371bde0fecbac8337bbc6f832\n\nSupport The Dig at Patreon.com/TheDig“\n\nHere is 2h of the most intense and informative talk I got to listen to recently. I totally recommend both of them to follow in TW/X – if you are still on that platform. We had some previous posts on economy and political economy and inflation, but this one is truly essential for everyone interested in how global financial institutions came to exist and how the dollarisation of the world after WWII came to dominate our lives. It is also a very good introduction into two important theories that have lost the battle in the market of ideas – but are increasingly resuscitated in order to make sense of the rising unequal exchanges, dependencies, and monetary imperialisms that structure the Global North/Global South axis in capitalism: Dependency theory and World-systems theory. What is important is that both of them (one from Eastern Europe and the other from Equatorial Africa) advocate for a new global economic system where the Global South is at its center (the so-called “Bandung Woods” named after the Afro-Asian or Asian-African Bandung Conference in 1955 Bandung, Indonesia) to replace the Washington (or now Wall Street) Consensus.\n\nMost of what I am saying here tries to approximate what the two eminent (imho opinion) macroeconomists and monetary sovereignty experts spell out. I am going to quote in full Gabriela Gabor (who happens to be a Romanian born) from the written version of the interview (available here).\n\nDANIELA GABOR:\n\nThe Washington Consensus is in a sense a marker of who makes the rules in the global economic system, and that was Washington. Its intellectual father was John Williamson. He was quite reluctant to recognize himself as an intellectual father, because very quickly, the Washington Consensus was dubbed as a neoliberal consensus. I think it’s best described as a holy trinity of economic policies that were prescribed to countries, particularly in Latin America. This was a “what’s-happening-in-our-backyard” type of arrangement for the United States.\n\nThe three pillars of the Washington Consensus were economic stabilization, privatization, and liberalization [my emphasis). Economic stabilization basically meant the central banks have to target inflation and to keep prices stable; privatization meant trying to reduce the footprint of the developmental state in the economy by preventing the state from allocating capital or getting involved in production through state-owned companies or enterprises; and liberalization of international trade meant removing trade barriers, but also liberalization of prices domestically by not using price controls and removing subsidies as much as possible.\n\nThis is interpreted as an attempt to change the balance between the state and the market. Of course the states vs. markets framework is a crude description because the state had to construct certain markets. But it is true that the Washington Consensus was a policy paradigm and a political project to kill off the developmental state. In the 1950s and ’60s, the developmental state, under what we describe now as heterodox economic ideas, attempted to design a national development strategy in a context of deteriorating terms of trade.\n\nFor developing nations, the question was, how do we make sure that we will get paid better for our exports than what we have to pay for our inputs? That typically meant industrial upgrading. That typically meant having a good industrial policy. It typically meant having some form of financial repression, which subordinated the domestic banking system to the needs of the industrial policy. It meant some form of a social contract with domestic capital and also with foreign capital, but mostly domestic capital, to make sure that domestic capital worked together with the state for industrial policy purposes.\n\nThe Washington Consensus is basically a political project to dismantle this developmental state and instead to bring in the market as the mechanism to allocate resources. The state doesn’t disappear of course. But what we know is that the state that is useful for citizens in a sense disappears because you have an increasing removal of the state from the provision of public goods, one way or another, under the idea that the market can do things better than the state.\n\nIn the postwar era, you have the Bretton Woods institutions that are pushing this Washington Consensus all over the world. Wherever the IMF or the World Bank go, they leave a trail of structural adjustment programs. You have the IMF pushing for stability and particular forms of monetary and fiscal austerity under the Washington Consensus. There is an increasing recognition toward the end of the 1990s that this has meant a lost decade for Latin American countries, that it produced a lot of poverty across African countries that were forced to adopt them. Of course there are certain domestic political constituencies that preferred the Washington Consensus rules simply because they align well with the aims of right-wing politics.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Bretton Woods institutions become a bit more unwilling to promote the more radical elements of the Washington Consensus. This leads to what is called now the Post–Washington Consensus, which is a recognition that there are market failures. The idea is that if there are market failures, then of course the state is necessary. So you don’t have the resurrection of the developmental state, but you have the resurrection of the state as a regulator that tries to correct market failures but doesn’t allocate capital or doesn’t interfere with market signals. It corrects the signals if those have gone wrong one way or another.\n\nIn some ways we still have that now, because all discussions about carbon prices, for example, have to do with how to achieve the low-carbon transition; they rest on the idea that the state doesn’t need to do a lot more than just correct the failure of the market to price the climate crisis.\n\nNDONGO SAMBA SYLLA (who has written a book on the history of CFA – Africa’s last colonial currency):\n\nI am from the generation whose parents suffered the consequences of the IMF and World Bank austerity policies. You could see concrete impacts because many people were fired from their jobs, for example, because one of the ways to implement these structural adjustment policies was for the state to clean up its own budget. That means limiting its spending, and one way to limit the spending is to cut health expenditures and education expenditures and also to get rid of some civil servants.\n\nReduced state budgets also meant less investment and less open-door immigration policies. That has been the impact. That’s why if you look at the development trajectory of Africa and compare that to Asia, you would see that the most significant difference came after the 1980s. This is because Asian countries were not subject to IMF and World Bank policies in the 1980s and 2000s.\n\nSome countries, for example, Cote d’Ivoire, Senegal, and Niger — their real GDP per capita in, say, 2015 was lower than their best level of real GDP per capita before implementing the IMF and World Bank’s policies.\n\nThat’s a clear indicator of the failure of these kinds of policies. But their primary aim was to prevent the emergence of the developmental state. There are many things people say about Africa, but the first two decades were developmental decades, despite all the shortcomings and despite the many proxy wars. But the leaders were really committed to creating some development, and you can see that in the work by the African economist Thandika Mkandawire.\n\nOn that final note, what is the Wall Street Consensus? (paper by Gabriela Gabor here)\n\nhe Wall Street Consensus (WSC) is an elaborate effort to reorganize development interventions around selling development finance to the market. The Billions to Trillions agenda, the World Bank ‘Maximizing Finance for Development’ or the G20 ‘Infrastructure as an Asset Class’ all call on international development institutions and governments of poor countries to ‘escort capital’ – the trillions of institutional investors – into ‘investable development bonds’, preferably in local currency. For this, the 10 WSC commandments aim to simultaneously reorganize local financial systems around bond market-based finance and forge the de-risking state. The state derisks bond finance for institutional investors by extending guarantees and subsidies to cover (i) demand risks attached to user-fees for (PPP) infrastructure, (ii) political risk attached to policies such as nationalization, higher minimum wages and climate regulation, (iii) climate risks that may become part of regulatory frameworks as material credit risks and (iv) bond market (liquidity) risks that complicate foreign investors’ exit from development assets. The WSC narrows the scope for a green developmental state that could design a just transition to low- carbon economies."
