Zimonjić became a professional tennis player in 1995 and was relatively unknown on the international stage, which changed after he won the mixed doubles at the 2004 Australian Open. He defeated defending champions Martina Navratilova and Leander Paes in straight sets in an hour and nine minutes, partnering for the first time with Russian Elena Bovina.

Born in Belgrade and raised in the Borča district Zimonjić currently resides in New Belgrade. His paternal line originates from the Gacko region of Herzegovina and settled in Vučkovica near Kragujevac. His mother was born in Gospić, Lika. In 2008, Zimonjić married Mina Knežević, a former model with whom he had twins Leon and Luna on December 3, 2008.

Zimonjić has not fared well on the single’s tour, with his best performance being the round 3 in the 1999 Wimbledon. The Serbian player has won 3 men’s doubles grand slams and 5 mixed doubles grand slams in his career. 47 years old, Zimonjić never announced an official retirement. His last official match came at the 2021 Dubai Tennis Championships. Since then, he has only played in the mixed invitational doubles events.

Zimonjić was a captain of the Serbian Davis Cup team from 2003-2004, but since high-ranking Serbian players came about, he donned the role of a double’s specialist. Now, the 47-year-old player is likely to become Djokovic’s coach.

Nenad Zimonjić pseudo-coaching Djokovic

After splitting with Ivanišević, the Serbinator has not announced a new permanent coach in his team. However, fans have good reason to believe that Zimonjić will temporarily guide the player in the upcoming clay season. He was seen with Djokovic in Monte Carlo for the first clay Masters. One user wrote on ‘X’, “Former doubles #1 Nenad Zimonjić is in Monte Carlo with Djokovic, suggesting they’ve agreed to collaborate for at least a trial period. Whether it’s for the upcoming tournament alone or longer remains to be seen.”
