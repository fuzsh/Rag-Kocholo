ROME — Canadian Daniel Nestor and Serb Nenad Zimonjic claimed their third doubles title in as many weeks Sunday, beating Bob and Mike Bryan 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 at the Rome Masters.

The victory follows one in Monte Carlo — a crushing defeat of the American twins — and another in Barcelona last week, all on clay.

Nestor and Zimonjic, second in the world behind the Californians, also took revenge for a final loss in Rome a year ago and have now beaten the Bryans in five of their last seven finals dating to that 2008 event.

"This was a great win," said Nestor. "This year we’ve won two Masters 1000s and Barcelona. We’re playing pretty similar to the way we played last year.

"Hopefully we haven’t peaked too soon. We want to keep it going for the Slams."

Nestor and Zimonjic now own a 12-match clay win streak heading to next week’s new Serbia Open in Nestor’s Belgrade birthplace.

"This (spring) has been a great turnaround — similar to last year — where we found our game at Rome," added Nestor.

The 36-year-old from Toronto owns three trophies at the Foro Italico, winning the Italian title in 1997 and 2006 with former long-time partner Mark Knowles.

Nestor and Zimonjic are 23-6 on the season, with four titles including their first of 2009 indoors in Rotterdam. They stand 4-2 in 2009 finals, losing Sydney to the Bryans, who remain No. 1 in the team rankings.

Nestor sealed the latest victory in just under 90 minutes as he fired the team’s fourth ace to line up three match points. The Bryans saved two before going down to defeat, their sixth this season against 33 wins.

"I have a long history with the Bryans," said Nestor. "They are the favourites in every match they play. You have to hang with them, if you stay close then you have a chance. We played the big points very well today."
