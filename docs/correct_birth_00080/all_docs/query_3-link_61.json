        "text": "Novak Djokovic‘s most recent addition to his team puts a well-known face back in the spotlight. In the dynamic realm of tennis coaching, Nenad Zimonjic is the latest to rise to fame. For those who have followed the sport attentively, Zimonjic’s name is well-known owing to his legendary career that spanned decades. But the veteran’s fame goes beyond his skill on the court because of his crucial role in promoting justice in the doubles world.\n\nAs a well-known player on the doubles circuit, Zimonjic has been an outspoken supporter of treating doubles players fairly and recognizing their accomplishments. Nearly two decades ago, he was there when the battle for doubles, which was on the verge of extinction at the time, was fought. “I was present when doubles went through its greatest crisis”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAt that time while singing tennis was quite on the rise, the doubles category’s craze was declining. In an old interview from 18 years ago, Zimonjic talked about how he was a part of the team that stood with the Doubles category. He added, “That was 2005. The ATP organization, which has a board that brings together professionals (3) and directors (3), and the CEO as the seventh member, discussed the situation in tennis and made plans for serious changes.”\n\nThis all happened because the tournament directors were trying to reduce costs, virtually abolishing the doubles competition or reducing the number of teams participating in the category. However, the Doubles players hired a lawyer to fight for that category to remain as it was. And since they succeeded in that fight, even today, the doubles category remains a constant part of most of the tournaments here and there.\n\nZimonjic has demonstrated an unrelenting dedication to tennis greatness and integrity throughout his career, which spans from his days as a strong doubles player, where he advocated for equality and recognition in the sport, to his current position as Djokovic’s new coach.\n\nHowever, following the 24-time Grand Slam champion’s split with Goran Ivanisevic, Zimonjic made his first appearance in the Serbian player’s box at the 2024 Monte-Carlo Masters. Not only that, but recently he also opened up about his close bond with his Serbian coach.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n‘An older brother to me’—Djokovic’s equation with Zimonjic\n\nJust a few days before his Monte Carlo appearance, the world number one, in an interview with Eurosport, opened up about the history he has shared with Zimonjic. Novak Djokovic detailed how the 47-year-old has always been there to help him, on and off the tennis court.\n\nHe stated, “We have known each other really well for more than 20 years. He’s been always like an older brother to me. A mentor, a friend, who always tried to help me as a person and as a player.” Further, he also highlighted how they are trying to make the most of it, as Zimonjic is giving really useful advice that can work better for the 36-year-old Serbian tennis player.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWhat do you think this Serbian combo’s partnership is going to look like?
