        "text": "The Czech Republic's Tomas Berdych says the doubles point in this weekendâs Davis Cup final against Serbia in Belgrade will be critical. Berdych and Radek Stepanek will be seeking their 14th win in 15 Davis Cup doubles rubbers together.\n\nSerbian captain Bogdan Obradovic may play doubles stalwart Nenad Zimonjic with Ilija Bozoljac, as he did against the United States (a win) and Canada (a loss) this year, but he could also choose to pair Zimonjic with Novak Djokovic or Janko Tipsarevic, both of whom heâs paired with before. The Associated Press is reporting that Tipsarevic is considered doubtful for the tie with a heel injury.\n\nâThatâs definitely the most important point,â Berdych told DavisCup.com. âItâs been one of the most important points that weâve earned in many ties in the past and there will be no exception this time...We both know each other well on court. Thatâs why the results are great. We are both great singles players. We have many experiences in doubles, especially in Davis Cup, so I think these are the positive things that can help us to go through again.â\n\nIn other Davis Cup news, Czech Republic captain Jaroslav Navratil, who was admitted to a hospital last weekend for a pulmonary embolism, was released on Tuesday but will not attend the tie. Stand-in captain Vladimir Safarik will coach the team.\n\nâItâs completely different for me,â Safarik said. âI was always in the office or behind the bench so this is something new. Iâm happy to be here as a captain of course. I will support the team, I will protect the team but on the other hand I need the support from them. Itâs a job we have to do together and itâs an honor for me to be here.â"
