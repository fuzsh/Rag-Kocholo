        "text": "Novak Djokovic has been seen practicing with a potential new coach in his hometown of Belgrade. This comes after he announced earlier this week that he and Goran Ivanisevic, his coach for nearly five years, have decided to part ways.\n\nDjokovic shared on Instagram: \"Goran and I decided to stop working together a few days ago. Our on court chemistry had its ups and downs, but our friendship was always rock solid.\"\n\nNow, Djokovic is without a coach as he prepares for his next tournament, the Monte Carlo Masters, which begins in less than two weeks. He has been spotted training with retired Serbian player Nenad Zimonjic, leading to speculation that Zimonjic could be his new coach.\n\nHowever, Djokovic has now provided an update on his coaching situation, revealing that he is unsure if he will hire a replacement for Ivanisevic.\n\n\"I still don't have a clear idea who a new coach would be, or whether there will be one at all\", he said at the launch of Nikola Pilic's documentary. \"I've had coaches since I was a kid, now I am trying to feel by myself what I need, what I feel most comfortable with. You will be informed in case someone joins the team.\"\n\nThe 98-time career title winner also addressed the end of his working relationship with Ivanisevic. Djokovic added: \"First of all, Goran is my friend for life, mine and of my family's. He is a very dear person for me, the end of our professional collaboration doesn't mean that our friendship stops.\n\n\"Our separation has been positive, as positive as a separation can be. We have come to a point where we've exhausted our cooperation after almost five years.\" And Djokovic sent his well-wishes to the Croat as he reflected on their time together.\n\n\"Together, we've written history of our sport, we have won Slams, ended seasons as No. 1 in the world,\" he continued. \"But we went through trials and tribulations as well disqualification at the US Open, deportation from Australia. I will always remember that he was there for me as a person, as a human being, first and foremost, and that he brought the right set of values into our relationship. That kind of chemistry was followed by great results. I wish Goran all the best.\""
