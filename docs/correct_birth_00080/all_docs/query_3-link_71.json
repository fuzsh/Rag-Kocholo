        "text": "Novak Djokovic has opened up about the close relationship he shares with Nenad Zimonjic ahead of the 2024 Monte Carlo Masters, where he is working with his compatriot.\n\nThe world No 1 revealed he has known Zimonjic “really well for more than 20 years” and described his fellow Serbian as being “like an older brother” to him.\n\nDjokovic has been coached by Zimonjic in preparation for the clay-court season and the former doubles world No 1 is accompanying him at this week’s Monte Carlo Masters.\n\nThe 24-time Grand Slam champion, who is yet to win a title this season, split with long-time coach Goran Ivanisevic last month. Given the pair’s ongoing collaboration, Zimonjic has emerged as the leading contender to become the 36-year-old’s new head coach.\n\nIn a recent interview with Sport Klub, Ivanisevic gave his full backing to Zimonjic for the role: “I don’t know for how much longer Novak plans to keep on playing, but the perfect person is with him at the moment – ‘Ziki’.\n\nREAD MORE: Novak Djokovic’s next coach: Who is Nenad Zimonjic – the man tipped to replace Goran Ivanisevic?\n\n“He is a great friend of mine, we went through a lot together and I love him. He has vast tennis knowledge, but what is most important – he knows Novak really well.\n\n“At the moment, Novak doesn’t need someone completely new, who is yet to get to know him. Let’s say 10 days pass, Novak ‘goes crazy’ and this new coach is left wondering what is going on.\n\n“I have a theory – men from the Balkans can coach anyone, but only someone from this, our region can coach a Balkan player. Marian [Vajda] is Slovak, we’re close and we know each other well. Boris [Becker] also worked well with Novak, but his tennis IQ is off the charts.”\n\nAhead of his appearance in Monte Carlo, Djokovic explained the history he shares with Zimonjic and divulged how the 47-year-old has already been helping him with his net game.\n\n“We have known each other really well for more than 20 years. He’s been always like an older brother to me. A mentor, a friend, who always tried to help me as a person and as a player,” said the Serbian in an interview with Eurosport\n\n“When I stopped with Goran, I was starting my clay-court preparation in Belgrade and he was there. He came to the court, and we really enjoyed our collaboration and I asked him to come here for a few weeks.\n\n“We are trying to make the most of it. He’s been giving me really useful advice to find the proper position when I’m approaching the net, and it’s something I’m not best at because I don’t play as many doubles matches.\n\n“And Nenad was one of the best doubles players in the world, he’s won many Slams and tournaments, been No 1 on the tour.”\n\nDjokovic will face either Roman Safiullin or Jaume Munar in his opening match at the Masters 1000 event in Monte Carlo."
