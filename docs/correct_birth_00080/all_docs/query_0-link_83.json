        "text": "During the time off, in-between the two tournaments, world no.1 and the Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic came home to Belgrade where he was interviewed by Nenad Lj. Stefanovic on the RTS’ hour-long, one-on-one Serbian talk programme Svedok (The Witness).\n\nThe show was aired on Monday, February 23.\n\nNovak talked about how the birth of his son Stefan changed his life. He also spoke about the strong support from his family and his team…\n\n“I’m not the first and neither the last daddy in the world. I think whoever is a parent understands what my wife and I are going through. We entered a new chapter in life, a new dimension of love, I didn’t even know existed inside me. It is the greatest happiness I could experience. My life and my career, everything around me has a deeper meaning, a more intrinsic value,“ said Nole.\n\nAbout adjusting to life as a tennis-playing father, coordinating his tournament schedule, traveling and family obligations, the Serbian star said:\n\n“I was in Australia for three and a half weeks, it was hard for me to be away from my son and wife. But I did a great job there and got back home fulfilled. Good thing is I can afford to travel with them. After Stefan was born and my wife recovered from childbirth, we discussed our schedule and how we will educate and raise our child. We will probably have to sacrifice his routine, and babies love routine, because of my tennis obligations… We agreed it is important that I take part in his life as a father, see him as often as possible, so they’ll travel to most tournaments with me.“\n\nDjokovic spoke about his attitude and principles.\n\n“I want to be myself. I don’t like pretending, hypocrisy, I like to be open, honest all the time. Emotions that I show may seem unacceptable to some, but that’s who I am. Breaking racquets and swearing sometimes is not something I’m proud of. But even my coaches told me it’s better to let go of your frustrations than keep the anger inside.”\n\nFitness is one of many qualities of the eight-time Grand Slam titlist.\n\n“I have good genes. My maternal grandfather still plays volleyball at 78. But genes are only a small part of the big picture. More important is recovery and all the techniques, stretching, ice bath… I ride a bicycle, do aqua gymnastics, it helps a lot with muscular elasticity. We opt for quality over quantity when working in the gym. I have supreme professionals in my team that do great work.“\n\nHis professional goals remain unchanged, but the biggest priority in life for him is to spend more time with his wife and son.\n\n“The biggest priority in life for me is to spend more time with my wife Jelena and our son Stefan. Tennis is still one of the top priorities. I will not change my schedule, I still have the same approach. Things are changing for the better, I have a child, I play for him. I will try to stay at the top for as long as possible, I will fight for GS trophies. One of my goals is Roland Garros, the only major title I have not won.”\n\nSerbia will host Croatia in the Davis Cup by BNP Paribas World Group first round in March.\n\n“The tie will take place in Kraljevo. Viktor Troicki is back, we also have Nenad Zimonjic and Filip Krajinovic on the team. We believe we can win. Cilic and Karlovic won’t play, I’m not sure about Dodig. Borna Coric reminds me of myself in my younger days, he’s got a bright future. I’m glad we’re playing in Kraljevo, it will increase the popularity of tennis in that part of Serbia.“\n\nThe Belgrade native also spoke about the Novak Djokovic Foundation activities.\n\n“Establishing the Foundation was a major undertaking for me, it is a big responsibility. Our mission is to invest in education of children, because knowledge is an investment for the future, something that nobody can take away from them. Through our projects, we try to improve early childhood education, provide children with stimulating and creative conditions in classrooms and enable a safe surrounding for their progress. Many children in Serbia do not dare to dream big, so we started helping the most vulnerable municipalities. Over 6,500 children have been included in our projects, about 7.5 million dollars have been invested. Many generous people want to help, and together we are trying to do something nice.“\n\nStill pursuing his dreams…"
