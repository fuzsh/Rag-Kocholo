        "text": "LONDON (AP)âNovak Djokovic will lead the Serbian team in the Davis Cup final against France next month.\n\nThe International Tennis Federation said Tuesday that Viktor Troicki, Janko Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic were also selected by Serbia for the Dec. 3-5 matches on an indoor hard court in Belgrade.\n\nThe French team will be led by Gael Monfils and also include Michael Llodra, Gilles Simon and Arnaud Clement. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga is out with a knee injury.\n\nDjokovic, at No. 3, is the highest ranked player in the final. He has won all five of the singles matches he has played to lead Serbia to its first ever final.\n\nSerbia has beaten the United States, Croatia and Czech Republic to earn a matchup against nine-time Davis Cup champion France.\n\nSerbia captain Bogdan Obradovic has said 30th-ranked Troicki will likely get the No. 2 singles spot after Djokovic, with Zimonjic and Tipsarevic teaming up in the doubles.\n\nMonfils is Franceâs top singles player, with doubles specialist Llodra and Simon vying for the other spot."
