        "text": "And Zimonjic is the right man for the job, according to Djokovic’s former coach, Goran Ivanisevic, who gave an exclusive interview to Sport Klub.\n\nIvanisevic: “He doesn’t need someone completely new”\n\n“I don’t know for how much longer Novak plans to keep on playing, but the perfect person is with him at the moment – Ziki (Nenad Zimonjic),”said Ivanisevic, who parted ways with Djokovic last month. “He is a great friend of mine, we went through a lot together and I love him. He has a vast tennis knowledge, but what is most important – he knows Novak really well.”\n\n“At the moment, Novak doesn’t need someone completely new, who is yet to get to know him. Let’s say 10 days pass, Novak ‘goes crazy’ and this new coach is left wondering what is going on,” he said, with a laugh.\n\n“I have a theory – man from the Balkans can coach anyone, but only someone from this our region can coach a Balkan player. Marian (Vajda) is Slovak, we’re close and we know each other well. Boris (Becker) also worked well with Novak, but his tennis IQ is off the charts.”\n\nIvanisevic: “Ziki knows Novak’s mentality really well”\n\nIvanisevic went on to further explain why Zimonjic would be the best solution.\n\n“Ziki can help him tennis-wise. Novak does know everything already, but it will be refreshing for him to maybe hear the same thing from someone else, with a different approach. Ziki knows Novak’s mentality really well, they collaborated in the Davis Cup as well,” he said.\n\nThe full interview with Ivanisevic will be released on Wednesday."
