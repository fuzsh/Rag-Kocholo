This victory brought him 38 positions up on ATP ladder to the position of 54 prior to the Australian Open. At the Australian Open, he reached the third round before being eliminated by world No. 7, Tomáš Berdych in straight sets. In March, Troicki defeated young Croatian prodigy Borna Ćorić in five epic sets in round one of the Davis Cup; Serbia would go on to win and progress to the quarterfinals. In June, defeating Marin Čilić on 14 June, Troicki played in the finals of Stuttgart Mercedes Cup versus Rafael Nadal. Troicki played very well but Nadal won in straight sets, 7–6, 6–3. Seeded No. 22, his US Open campaign opened with a straight-sets victory over wildcard Frances Tiafoe and a 3–1 win over Rajeev Ram before losing in the third round to Donald Young having won the first two sets.\n\n2016: Third career title & 250th victory\n\nIn January, Troicki collected this third career title at the Apia International Sydney, defeating Grigor Dimitrov 2–6, 6–1, 7–6 and saving a championship point en route to his title defense. It was his second encounter in as many weeks with Dimitrov, who had gotten the better of him in three sets in their prior meeting at the Brisbane International. At the Australian Open, he equaled his 2015 result by reaching the third round. In February, he reached the final of the Sofia Open where he was defeated by Roberto Bautista Agut. At the French Open, he made it to fourth round where he lost to the defending champion Stan Wawrinka 7–6, 6–7, 6–3, 6–2 after three hours of play. Troicki lost in the second round of the Wimbledon Championships to Albert Ramos Viñolas. He was fined for the protracted verbal abuse of umpire Damiano Torella following Torella's overrule of a line call that resulted in a match point for Ramos Viñolas. Troicki lost the subsequent point and the match. At the Shanghai Masters in October, he recorded his first win over Rafael Nadal after six meetings.\n\n2017: Second Masters quarterfinal & fourth Davis Cup semifinal\n\nHe reached the third round at the Australian Open, losing to US Open champion Stan Wawrinka in four sets, narrowly missing a tiebreaker in the fourth to push for a fifth set. In February, partnering Nenad Zimonjić he won his second ATP doubles title at Sofia Open. After that two solid wins at the first round of the Davis Cup ensured Serbia would reached the quarterfinals for the seventh time in eight years. At the Davis Cup quarterfinals in April, a straight sets victory over world No. 19 Pablo Carreño Busta saw him record a personal best serve of 233 km/h. A doubles victory with Nenad Zimonjić ensured a fourth Davis Cup semifinal for him & his country.\n\n2018: Injuries and struggles with form\n\nIn doubles, partnering Jan-Lennard Struff he reached the finals of Sydney International where they lost to Łukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo. In singles, Troicki went 6–13 at the ATP Tour level in 2018. He suffered from a lower back injury during 2018 which limited his playing time. As a result, he fell out of the top 200.\n\n2019: Some success during the grass season\n\nHe reached the second round of Australian Open where he lost in 4 sets to the 14th seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas. During the year most of his success came only during the grass season. Troicki reached the finals of Surbiton Trophy where he lost to Daniel Evans, quarterfinals of Antalya Open where he lost to an eventual finalist Miomir Kecmanović and round of 16 at Hall of Fame Open in Newport where he lost again to an eventual finalist, this time Alexander Bublik.\n\n2020: Winning the inaugural ATP Cup and COVID-19\n\nBy winning the inaugural ATP Cup in 2020 with Serbia, Troicki became the first player in history to win all three major international team competitions (Davis Cup in 2010 and World Team Cup in 2009 and 2012). During summer, Troicki tested positive for COVID-19, which affected his preparations for the restart of the tennis season due to pandemic. At the end of the year, he was appointed captain of the Serbia Davis Cup team.\n\n2021: Retirement\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, he qualified for the Australian Open main singles draw where he lost in the first round to Michael Mmoh in 5 tight sets. After failing to qualify for the main draw of Roland Garros he made a surprising run at Queen's Club by beating No. 7 seed Lorenzo Sonego in straight sets before losing in the round of 16 to Frances Tiafoe. He announced that Wimbledon would be his last professional tournament before he retires. In the first round of qualifying he beat Christopher Eubanks before being defeated in the second round by Brandon Nakashima after three tight sets.\n\nCareer overview\n\nTroicki was a solid all-court player, who won more matches than he has lost on each surface. However, one factor that has kept him from more success is his poor record against top-10 players (65 losses vs 10 wins in his career).\n\nPerformance timelines\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# A P Z# PO G F-S SF-B NMS NH\n\n(W) Won; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (A) absent; (Z#) Davis/Fed Cup Zonal Group (with number indication) or (PO) play-off; (G) gold, (F-S) silver or (SF-B) bronze Olympic medal; a (NMS) downgraded Masters Series/1000 tournament; (NH) not held.
