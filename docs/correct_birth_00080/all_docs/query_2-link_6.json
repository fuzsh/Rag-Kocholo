This magnificent structure has captured the hearts of locals and tourists alike, drawing them into a world of serenity and awe. Join us on a captivating journey through the history, architecture, and spirituality that define the Temple of Saint Sava.\n\nA Historical Marvel\n\nThe story of the Temple of Saint Sava begins in the late 19th century when Serbia was rekindling its national identity. It was in 1895 that the idea of constructing this grand Orthodox Christian temple was first conceived. Named after Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the temple was envisioned as a symbol of Serbian heritage and faith.\n\nOver the years, the construction of the temple faced numerous setbacks, including wars, economic crises, and political changes.

Construction began in earnest in 1935 and continued through the tumultuous 20th century, with the dome finally being completed in 1989. This long and challenging journey makes the temple’s existence all the more remarkable.
