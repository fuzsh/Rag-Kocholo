        "text": "MELBOURNE — It has been more than six years since Nenad Zimonjic and Michaël Llodra played a doubles match on the same side of the net, and yet they should be among the favorites for the title when they rejoin forces next week at the Australian Open.\n\nBut that is only if they can move on from events in Belgrade last month, when the ebbs and flows of the Davis Cup final between Serbia and France reduced both these big hitters to tears on consecutive days.\n\nLlodra made Zimonjic cry first, teaming with Arnaud Clément to beat Zimonjic and Viktor Troicki in a five-set epic and give France a 2-1 lead that Zimonjic feared would be decisive. But when the final ended, Llodra was the one sobbing in his chair with captain Guy Forget and teammates gathered round after he had been overwhelmed by Troicki in the last singles match.\n\n“I was definitely sorry for him,” Zimonjic said in Melbourne. “I could imagine just what he was going through, but then again you try to support your own team, and we had been waiting and working for this for a long time in Serbia.”\n\nZimonjic, at 34, had been working for it longer than any of his teammates and was once a player-captain when Serbia was still working its way from outcast status in relative obscurity. But success has changed the equation, and Serbia’s first Davis Cup title was feted by the elite and hoi polloi alike with a celebration in front of Belgrade’s city hall and the release of a new postage stamp featuring the likenesses of the players.\n\nAt least Llodra got to keep his hair. Zimonjic, like Novak Djokovic and the other members of their team, had agreed to have his head shaved in the event of victory. He kept his word, right there on the court in Belgrade Arena (at least he still has his goatee).\n\n“That was kind of a shock to some of us, because we’ve never been like this, without hair, especially me and Novak,” Zimonjic said, laughing. “It’s growing quite slowly, but it’s a different look and everything is O.K.”\n\nThe question is whether Llodra feels the same way after faltering in the biggest match of his life. The flashy, left-handed Frenchman, who had the best year of his career in singles last year and is now ranked a career-high 22nd, skipped official warm-up events in favor of an exhibition in Adelaide. But Llodra, who made his name as a doubles player — winning three Grand Slam event titles, one with Clément and two with Fabrice Santoro — has stuck by his decision to play doubles regularly with Zimonjic this season while simultaneously trying to maintain his new status in singles.\n\nIt will be a huge challenge for a 30-year-old whose exceedingly rare net-rushing style in singles is easy on the eyes — particularly when he is creating minor miracles with his backhand volley — but demanding on the body. His new partner won’t have the same workload. Zimonjic, whose slightly menacing appearance does not jibe with his thoughtful manner, has long been a pure doubles specialist, one who has won seven Grand Slam titles (four in mixed doubles) and split up with his partner of three years, Daniel Nestor, in order to work with Llodra.\n\n“Michaël asked me at the U.S. Open if I would be interested, and it was kind of a joke, the way he asked me,” Zimonjic said. “And I told him, ‘When you get serious, and you say you want to really try to be the best team in the world or best two or three teams in the world, I’ll be more than happy to play with you, because I believe we can do well.’ So that’s how it started.”\n\nIt ended with Zimonjic asking Llodra in earnest a few weeks later, feeling that he and Nestor had completed a cycle even though their wives are friends, and Zimonjic’s twins and Nestor’s daughter were born within two weeks of each other in 2008.\n\nZimonjic and Nestor did not part ways without a final flourish, beating the Bryan twins, Bob and Mike, long the team to beat, in the semifinals of the A.T.P. World Tour finals in November and then winning the title and finishing the year as the world’s No.2 team.\n\nNestor’s age — the Canadian is 38 — was a factor in Zimonjic’s switch to the younger Llodra. But there are clearly similarities, and not only because Llodra has young children of his own. Like Nestor, Llodra is a left-hander who plays the ad court and is a streaky, ultra-aggressive returner.\n\nThat explains, in part, why Zimonjic believes that they can click quickly this season despite playing just twice together in the past: during the French interclub championships for A.S. Patton-Rennes, most recently in 2004. “I don’t think it’s going to be that big of a deal, because we both stay on the same side that we’ve been playing,” Zimonjic said. “There is no big change to work through.”\n\nIt will be a year of both changes and revivals on the men’s doubles circuit as the Bryans try to remain No.1. Nestor has teamed up with Max Mirnyi, and Andy Ram has reunited with Jonathan Erlich just as Leander Paes is reuniting with his longtime partner, Mahesh Bhupathi. But with Ram and Erlich both representing Israel and Paes and Bhupathi both stars at home in India, there is no risk of finding each other on opposite sides of the net at a Davis Cup final.\n\n“I think it would have more impact on a team if I had been playing, for example, against Daniel, who I’ve played with for three years,” Zimonjic said of the Davis Cup. “That would make maybe a little bigger difference, but this was before my partnership with Michaël, so I see it as a professional.”\n\nConsidering the final result, it would be no surprise if Llodra saw it rather differently."
