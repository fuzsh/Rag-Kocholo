        "text": "Daniel Nestor of Toronto entered the tennis history books on Saturday with his Wimbledon doubles victory alongside partner Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia.\n\nNestor and Zimonjic, seeded second, defeated eighth-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe 7-6 (12), 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3 to complete a Grand Slam of doubles titles for Nestor. He won the 2002 Australian Open, the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2007 French Open, all with long-time partner Mark Knowles of the Bahamas.\n\nIn addition to the Olympic gold medal he and SÃ©bastien Lareau of Montreal brought home from Sydney in 2000, Nestor now has a career Golden Slam of doubles titles. He joins Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde of Australia as the only men to hold that distinction.\n\nFor Zimonjic, who shares a Belgrade birthplace with Nestor, it was his first men's Grand Slam victory. Nestor became the first Canadian to win a Wimbledon title.\n\n\"Wimbledon has the most history and tradition of any tournament,\" said Nestor, 35. \"Being the only Canadian to win, it is very special.\"\n\nNestor had a thought for Knowles, his partner until they split last fall and with whom he won 40 of his 53 career titles.\n\n\"I don't know how he will react to this,\" he said of the Bahamian after Saturday's win. \"He's a great guy.\n\n\"Hopefully, he'll have this kind of chance. It would be nice if he won the only tournament missing in his career.\"\n\nNestor earned about $230,000 for the victory, the biggest payday of his career.\n\nHe also had something else to celebrate. On Saturday, he revealed that he and his wife, Natasha, are expecting their first child in December."
