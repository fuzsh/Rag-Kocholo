__ * High School Record * __ is a 2005 film from writer/director __ Ben Wolfinsohn __ ( * Friends Forever * ) that chronicles the lives of a mess of high schoolers as they make their way through a tumultuous senior year. Sure, it might sound like a thing or ten you might've seen before, but in the case of * High School Record * , chances are you haven't. The flick screened at a handful of big name film festivals a few years back, but now, it's finally available __ available on DVD through Amazon __ .

And what a cast! A list of the featured players in the flick reads like a veritable who's-who of the Los Angeles underground rock scene. No Age's Dean Spunt (pictured at top) and Randy Randall, Becky Stark of Lavender Diamond (pictured directly above), and Jenna Thornhill, Jennifer Clavin and Jessica Clavin of Mika Miko all make appearances, as does Minuteman Mike Watt as Thornhill's dad. Here's Jennifer Clavin and Jenna Thornhill at their crappy after-school jobs:

Also, here's Randy Randall as "Bully", threatening bandmate Spunt, who plays a nerd named Caleb. It's pretty darn funny:

Naturally, the flick's got a killer soundtrack, too, with tunes from No Age, Dan Deacon, Jad Fair, the Chicago Underground Quartet, Brokeback, and others.

You can watch * High School Record * starting Friday, September 26 over at __ Pitchfork.tv __ as part of the "One Week Only" series.
