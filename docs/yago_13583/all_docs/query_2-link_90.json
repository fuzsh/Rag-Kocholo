        "text": "Hold on to your jet packs, California. The next entry in the “Star Wars” film franchise is shooting entirely in the Golden State.\n\nCalifornia’s Film Commission announced in a news release Monday that Lucasfilm’s upcoming feature film “The Mandalorian & Grogu” will be produced entirely in the state, one of 15 movie productions coming to fruition thanks to California’s Film and TV Tax Credit Program.\n\nBased on the popular Disney+ series and directed by “The Mandalorian” creator Jon Favreau, “The Mandalorian & Grogu” is set to be the first film in the franchise’s 46-year history to be shot entirely in the state and the biggest blockbuster in the history of the commission’s tax credit program, bringing approximately $166 million to the state’s economy through wages and expenditures, the release said.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the film will get $21.8 million in tax credits.\n\n“The Mandalorian & Grogu,” which is due to begin filming later this year and is currently expected to be released sometime in 2026, will continue the story of the titular lone bounty hunter and his alien baby companion that began in the three-season series, Lucasfilm announced last month.\n\n“From Earth to Arvala-7 to Mandalore, there is no place to film like California,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom in the release. “Our iconic entertainment industry has brought us classics across generations, and through this program we’re making sure the state continues producing, while generating billions of dollars for our communities, creating thousands of good-paying jobs, and training our future workforce.”\n\nIn the release, a spokesperson for Lucasfilm said the company is thrilled to be shooting the next “Star Wars” movie in California.\n\n“Working with the California Film Commission, we are proud to be creating film jobs in California and excited to start production, utilizing the world class crew available here.”\n\nOther notable productions planning to shoot in California in the next year include an untitled Disney live action film, an untitled 20th Century Studios film, and two Amazon MGM Studios projects, “The Accountant 2,” a sequel to the 2016 Ben Affleck-led action film, and a sci-fi film “Mercy,” starring Chris Pratt.\n\nTen independent films were also slated to begin production in California as part of the tax credit program.\n\nOverall, the 15 selected productions are projected to generate over $400 million for the economy and create nearly 20,000 jobs, the release said.\n\nEditor’s note: A previous version of this story quoted a KNX News radio interview with California Film Commission head Colleen Bell which mentions Marin County as a “The Mandalorian & Grogu” filming site. The quote was taken out of context by the radio station, according to the film commission. The story has been updated to reflect that, according to the film commission, the movie is filming in California but not currently scheduled to film in Marin County."
