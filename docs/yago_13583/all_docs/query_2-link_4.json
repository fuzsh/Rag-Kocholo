        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: James McAvoy‘s directorial debut, which we revealed last fall, has set lead cast and is heading to the Cannes market with Bankside and UTA Independent Film Group.\n\nBAFTA winner McAvoy will take on a supporting role in the movie, which will be led by BAFTA-nominated How To Have Sex breakout Samuel Bottomley and newcomer Séamus McLean Ross, who is currently filming on Outlander: Blood of My Blood.\n\nCurrently titled California Schemin’ (working title), the film will chart the true story of two Scottish lads from Dundee who conned the international music industry by adopting American accents and pretending to be established Californian rap duo, Silibil N’ Brains.\n\nIn the late 90’s, Gavin Bain (McLean Ross) and Billy Boyd (Bottomley) had their musical ambitions consistently ridiculed for having the ‘wrong’ accents so they went for broke and reinvented themselves as Californian rappers. McAvoy’s movie will show how the duo re-recorded their own tracks with fake accents and turned up in London claiming to be an established duo on the Cali scene as well as childhood friends with Eminem. They quickly bagged themselves a record deal, a hefty sum in advances, and an appearance on MTV…until it all came crashing down.\n\nCurrently in pre-production, the feature is based on Bain’s autobiography of the same name, which was later re-printed as Straight Outta Scotland. The story was later adapted into 2013 SXSW documentary The Great Hip Hop Hoax.\n\nArchie Thomson (Deep State 2) adapted the screenplay, and Kahleen Crawford will be serving as casting director. Pic is produced by Scottish producer Guy J. Louthan of Ransom Films (The Call), and Danny Page of Homefront Productions. Stephen Kelliher and Sophie Green will serve as executive producers for Bankside Films.\n\nBankside Films will be introducing the film to buyers at the Cannes Film Festival and are handling international sales, while UTA Independent Film Group is repping North America.\n\nSplit, X-Men and The Last King Of Scotland star McAvoy said: “I’m proud to announce that for my directorial debut I will be telling the true Scottish story of Silibil ‘n’ Brains. California Schemin’ is as rooted in the California rap scene of the early 2000’s as it is in the working-class Scottish setting where our story begins. With California Schemin’ I’ll be telling a story about friendship, rap and glorious failure that has the potential to move, shock and entertain. Adapted by Archie Thompson we have a script that brilliantly captures the desperation, bravery, talent and sheer con artist genius of our Scottish rapping duo Silibil’n’Brains while with Samuel Bottomley and Seamus McClean Ross we have two special young actors who I feel privileged to be telling this story with on my debut feature.”\n\nKelliher of Bankside Films added: “We can’t wait to bring the mind-blowing story of Silibil N’ Brains to the big screen. Their astounding tale of ambition and determination delivers brilliant entertainment whilst being funny, poignant and ultimately moving. We have faith that James and his wonderful cast will create a truly special film which will leave audiences open mouthed as they bear witness to one of the biggest scams in music history.”\n\nMcAvoy will next be seen in Blumhouse horror Speak No Evil.\n\nMcAvoy is represented by UTA, United Agents, and Sloane Offer. Guy J. Louthan is also repped by UTA. Séamus McLean Ross is represented by Clarence Conway of Independent Talent. Samuel Bottomley is represented by Ellie Martin-Sperry at 42mp. Archie Thomson is represented by Nick Fenwick at Curtis Brown."
