        "text": "Professional writers often read works by other writers to think about new techniques. Although reading a good paper cannot teach you everything you need to know about writing in a given discipline, it can be enormously helpful. The papers below are past winners of the Writing Center essay contest. We hope you find some of these helpful for expanding your writing repertoire.\n\nIt can be even more valuable to ask your professors for sample essays that they admire. In fact, if your field is not represented below, please encourage your professors to send us a model paper in that discipline.\n\nThe headings below expand to show a list of downloadable papers within the selected department or discipline.\n\n“Occupy Wall Street: Creating a Successful Movement from a Chaotic Structure,” by Kelsea Jeon ’20.
