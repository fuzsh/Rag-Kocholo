        "text": "DIRECTING\n\n(click HERE or scroll down for Playwriting)\n\nThe best thing about studying directing in a liberal arts institution like the University of Winnipeg is that, to be an excellent director, you must have an extensive knowledge of social and artistic history, strong research skills, and a burning curiosity to explore art forms beyond the theatre. The breadth of classes at the University of Winnipeg provides student directors with the range of tools and knowledge required to excel in this field.\n\nWe find that the students who make the best directors aren’t solely focused on theatre as an art form. They are often also musicians or dancers or visual artists. Or they have a passion for film. And they are avid readers – and writers – of both fiction and non-fiction. It is in the intersection of these various arts that the directors find their individual voice.\n\nGiven the rigours demanded of a director, we don’t offer a general BA in this area. It is our belief that the full 4-years of a BA Honours is required to provide emerging directors with the skill and knowledge to succeed in this challenging field.\n\nSenior directing students also have an opportunity to take advanced courses in devised theatre, and can get credit for assistant directing our own shows or those with our community partners.\n\nProgram of Study for BA Honours\n\nCompulsory:\n\nTHFM-1001(6) Introduction to Theatre: Performance\n\nor THFM-1002(6) Introduction to Theatre: General\n\nor THFM-1003(6) Introduction to Theatre: Indigenous Performance\n\nANY TWO of:\n\nTHFM-2101(6) Acting Theory and Practice\n\nTHFM-2201(3) Principles of Design\n\nTHFM-3802(3) Stage Management\n\nTHFM-4331(6) Directing I\n\n6 additional credit hours at the 4000-level in directing, dramaturgy, or special studies\n\nRequired but not in any particular order or year:\n\nTHFM/ENGL-2703(3) Play Analysis\n\nA minimum of 3 credit hours from the Dramatic Studies Group\n\nTHFM-4441(3) Theatre Aesthetics OR a minimum of 3 credit hours in any Honours-level course in dramaturgy\n\nA minimum of 9 or 12 additional credit hours in Theatre at the 3000 level (depending on the choice of required course from the Dramatic Studies Group)\n\nA minimum of 3 additional credit hours in Theatre at the 4000 level\n\nRecommended (in no particular order of preference):\n\nTHFM-2401/HIST-2190(3) Theatre History I: Aeschylus to Shakespeare\n\nTHFM-2402(3) Theatre History II: Molière to Irving\n\nTHFM-2602(3) Lighting\n\nTHFM-2801(6) Production l\n\nTHFM-3401/HIST-3190(3) Theatre History III: Ibsen to the Present\n\nTHFM-3402(3) Canadian Drama\n\nTHFM-4131(8) Acting III: Honours\n\nTHFM-4802(3) Honours Stage Management – Theory\n\nTHFM-4803(3) Honours Stage Management – Practice\n\nA first-year English course\n\nA Midsummer Night's Dream - Photo Credit: Tim Babcock Director: Christopher Brauer Set & Costume Design: Adam Parboosingh Lighting Design: Rebecca Enns\n\nPLAYWRITING\n\nStudents specializing in Playwriting enjoy small classes and individual instruction in a number of areas including one-act plays, full-length plays, and screenwriting. Our instructors are all experienced playwrights and screenwriters. Students learn how to construct a play from the initial idea to the final draft, and work collaboratively with their classmates to develop an exciting story complete with all the required elements. Workshopping opportunities are available for senior students. As a result of our close relationship with the university's English Department, students can augment their drama courses with creative writing courses taught by top-notch English professors.\n\nIn addition to Playwriting I, Playwriting II: General, and Playwriting II: Honours, we teach an Intro and an Advanced course in Screenwriting and another called Script and Screen, which examines existing screenplays to determine what works and what doesn't. As well, our senior students have an opportunity to work on specialized projects on a one-to-one basis with a Professor who is an experienced playwright.\n\nA number of award-winning playwrights have come through this program including Brian Drader (Artistic Director of the Manitoba Association of Playwrights and long-time coordinator of playwriting at the National Theatre School) and Vern Thiessen (Artistic Director of Workshop West Playwrights’ Theatre and Governor General’s award Winner).\n\nProgram of Study for the General BA\n\nCompulsory sequence:\n\nONE OF:\n\nTHFM-1001(6) Introduction to Theatre: Performance\n\nor THFM-1002(6) Introduction to Theatre: General\n\nor THFM-1003(6) Introduction to Theatre: Indigenous Performance\n\nAND:\n\nTHFM-2701(6) Playwriting I\n\nTHFM-3701(6) Playwriting II: General\n\nRequired but not in any particular order or year:\n\nTHFM/ENGL-2703(3) Play Analysis\n\nAND a minimum of 3 credit hours from the Dramatic Studies Group\n\nRecommended:\n\nA first-year English course\n\nProgram of Study for the BA Honours\n\nCompulsory:\n\nONE OF:\n\nTHFM-1001(6) Introduction to Theatre: Performance\n\nor THFM-1002(6) Introduction to Theatre: General\n\nor THFM-1003(6) Introduction to Theatre: Indigenous Performance\n\nAND:\n\nTHFM-2701(6) Playwriting I\n\nTHFM-4041(6) Special Studies in Theatre in Playwriting\n\nRequired but not in any particular order or year:\n\nTHFM/ENGL-2703(3) Play Analysis\n\nA minimum of 3 credit hours from the Dramatic Studies Group\n\nTHFM-4441(3) Theatre Aesthetics OR a minimum of 3 credit hours in any Honours-level course in dramaturgy\n\nA minimum of 9 or 12 additional credit hours in Theatre at the 3000 level (depending on the choice of required course from the Dramatic Studies Group)\n\nA minimum of 9 additional credit hours in Theatre at the 4000 level\n\nRecommended (in no particular order of preference):\n\nTHFM-2401/HIST-2190(3) Theatre History I: Aeschylus to Shakespeare\n\nTHFM-2402(3) Theatre History II: Molière to Irving\n\nTHFM-2610(3) Script and Screen\n\nTHFM-2611(3) Introduction to Screenwriting\n\nTHFM-3401(3)/HIST-3190(3) Theatre History III: Ibsen to the Present\n\nTHFM-3402(3) Canadian Drama\n\nA first-year English course\n\nAny single or combination of dramatic literature and/or creative writing courses offered through another Humanities department.\n\nStudents in a 3-Year General BA program can take a maximum of 48 credit hours in their major subject.\n\nStudents in an a BA Honours program can take a maximum of 78 credit hours in their major subject.\n\n(In both cases, students must take a minimum of 42 hours outside their major subject.)\n\nConsult the Calendar or WebAdvisor for more detailed course descriptions and regulations. We strongly recommend that you arrange an appointment with the Department's Student Advisor early on to discuss your program (204-786-9955)."
