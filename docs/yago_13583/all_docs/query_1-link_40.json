        "text": "It’s Sunday night, and usually on a Sunday night I am cursing the heavens and shaking my fist in anger at the prospect of the coming Monday morning (and the lingering consequences of Saturday night). Sunday never seems to count as part of the weekend. Sure, it’s technically a weekend day and some religions even go so far as designating it a “day of rest,” but let’s face it: Sundays are far from restful.\n\nThis evening, however, I think I feel a little rest coming on and I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve been stressing about this coming week for a while (it involves the frantic finishing of one course and the nervous beginning of another), but I think that for once in my life I have managed to turn my stress into positive energy: I actually finished (almost) all my prep and grading yesterday, a fact which I can barely believe. Today all I had to do was grade a handful of papers and email the grades to our program coordinator. Done! And! DONE!\n\nI can barely believe the freedom I feel, settling in for the evening with no chores weighing over my head! I.. well.. I think I kind of like this feeling. I think I could get used to it. The palpable lack of anxiety is a rare treat; I tell you.\n\nIt seems the whole early-to-bed, early-to-work, frequently-to-the-gym schedule I have been doing the past month has given me ridiculous amounts of energy. It’s kind of sick, really, that I feel so wrong when I don’t get to the gym. I’m embarrassed to tell you that I can rarely even enjoy a nap on the couch with the dog on my belly and the gentle, comforting hum of the television in the background. I used to love that! SOB!\n\nThere’s only one problem: I have this whole evening of freedom and no more desire or ability to laze on the couch like a no-‘count ne’er-do-well, so what should I do with my time? Even if it were feasible to spend the evening with a bottle of fine small-batch Kentucky Bourbon (i.e. if it were not a school night), I don’t even have much desire to do that anymore. I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHO I AM. This whole healthy and virtuous living thing is so confusing. I suppose I will go read a book. Stupid books.\n\nP.S. Did the title of this post remind you of this? I really hope it did.\n\nDear Bag of Discount Spinach,\n\nWhen I saw you in the produce section, neon yellow tag proclaiming that you were a rare and sought-after 99-cent manager’s special, I snatched you from the cooler with a quickness. As I held you up to the light, inspecting your slightly wilted leaves, I looked upon you with the eyes of a hopeful lover.\n\nI saw the good in you; I saw the fresh, beautiful, dark green leaves hiding among the wilted and slimy ones. I saw your flaws, but with the naïveté I’ve often been known to exhibit, I thought I could change you. I thought I could save you.\n\nFine, I’ll admit I then forgot about you for a few days and I’m sorry for that. Those nights spent alone and neglected in the depths of my crisper drawer must have been hellish. You must have felt so lost and alone as I passed over you time and time again in search of other foods. But when I remembered you again, Discount Spinach, I tried! I really tried to make up for my neglect.\n\nWe spent so much time together then, you and I. Tonight, my arms sunk within your verdant depths, I sought out only the best in you. I carefully extracted each leaf from within your plastic cloak, painstakingly separating the soggy scraps of rotten leaves from the healthy ones. When I had finished exploring every inch of you, I observed with great sadness that only a fraction of your former glory remained. The bad leaves outnumbered the good; you had succumbed to a cold and lonely demise.\n\nWas the money I saved by buying a huge bag of discount spinach worth the pain? Not only the pain I caused you, but (let’s face it, more importantly) the pain I suffered by having rotten spinach leaves clinging to my arms during the lengthy salvage mission I was forced to undertake? No. No it wasn’t.\n\nYours in Iron and Calcium, but not in Decomposition,\n\nAV\n\nToo many things are annoying me today – most of them are small (had to request my drink be re-made at the coffee shop1, previously acceptable social plans were altered to be made less acceptable, etc.) and should therefore not really bother me, but I think I have reached some sort of saturation point where I am both in the final few sessions of my first summer class and also in the final few days before my second summer class2 and thus in the throes of inadequately finishing one while inadequately preparing for the other and it is making me a little on edge, shall we say, and if the length of this sentence is any indication I am nearing some sort of ominous scheduling-related brink.\n\n1On the subject of that coffee-shop request, please allow me to tell you why this is infuriating to me. I always request my iced coffee the same way: with soy milk. “Iced coffee with soy,” I always say. The cashier indicates this by scrawling a letter “S” in the “Milk” field on the plastic cup, which the barista then interprets, time after time, not as “soy” but as “sweetened.” I am forever being served black, sweetened iced coffee when what I wanted was unsweetened iced coffee with some goddamn SOY MILK. I mean Starbucksi is one of the few places in this godforsaken sown where they actually serve soy products; the least they could do is, you know, actually serve it.\n\niDon’t even start with me on the subject of Starbucks. We in New Wye are lucky to have even that. It’s not like Zembla, where a person in need is never more than arm’s reach from a coffee shop, coffee bar, coffee cart, or coffee kiosk. Lord knows it is not like Zembla.\n\n2Awesomely, these two classes actually overlap for a week. Won’t that be a thrill? This unusual overlap was not only the source of my payroll problems but also, at least tangentially, the source of faulty assumptions in social event planning. Everyone thinks I’ll be off when I will in fact be not only working that week but working double duty. I could explain all this but why? Explaining it has not proved useful once yet this summer.\n\nAnd how are you? Do you have any rants you’d like to share?\n\nI’ve been running and otherwise working out at the gym a ton lately, and for me they key to success is super-motivating music. You know, the kind of songs that get you to kick it up not just one notch but maybe two whole notches just so you can get your booty shakin’ even more.\n\nI have a tendency to enjoy semi-bad top-forty hip hop in these situations, but I’m also into anything with a strong driving beat – bonus points if it has uncomplicated lyrics that have anything to do with racing, running, dancing, walking 500 miles and then 500 more, shaking it, moving, or getting up offa that thing. I am nothing if not literal in my running music needs – no artistic metaphors for me; nothing that provokes too much thought! I like for my mind to wander around on its own, only dropping in by the music when I need to be told to be the one who’d walk a thousand miles to fall down next to this treadmill.\n\nMy running playlist has about 100 songs on it which I rotate around every now and then, but here are my current favorites (note: some are better for walking/warming up pace, some are better for a lighter run, some are better for ripping shit up – you get the picture):\n\n1. Paper Planes – M.I.A.\n\n2. Get up offa That Thing – James Brown\n\n3. Poker Face – Lady Gaga\n\n4. Heartless – Kanye West\n\n5. Live Your Life – T.I. (featuring Rihanna)\n\n6. I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) – The Proclaimers\n\n7. Sports & Wine – Ben Folds\n\n8. Stronger – Kanye West\n\n9. Don’t Stop the Music – Rihanna [This one is KILLER – Ed.]\n\n10. Way I Are – Timbaland (featuring Keri Hilson & D.O.E.)\n\n11. Let it Rock – Kevin Rudolph and Lil Wayne\n\n12. Disturbia – Rihanna\n\n13. Just Dance – Lady Gaga\n\n14. The Distance – Cake\n\n15. Today is the Day – Apollo Sunshine [If you’ve never heard this one go here – it’s perfect for running! – Ed.]\n\n16. Hey Mama – Black Eyed Peas\n\n17. Gold for Bread – Blitzen Trapper\n\n18. No Sleep Tonight – The Faders\n\n19. Survivor – Destiny’s Child [Good for when you feel like you’re going to die. – Ed.]\n\n20. Iko Iko – The Dixie Cups\n\n21. Bad Things – Jace Everett\n\n22. I Want You Back – The Jackson 5\n\n23. Still Dre – Dr. Dre\n\n24. L’Ami Cahouette – Serge Gainsbourg\n\n25. She Bangs the Drums – The Stone Roses\n\nSo, do you have any suggestions for what I should add to my playlist?\n\nI recently went to see The Decemberists, one of my very favorite bands, at Atlanta’s Tabernacle Theater. This was the first time I had seen them play live, and the concert most definitely delivered.\n\nI have been in love with the new album, The Hazards of Love, since my first listen through it, and I was glad to know I’d be able to hear them play it straight through during their first set. Although the room was hot enough to have us all sweating like we were in a Bikram yoga class, none of us cared. The band’s performance was spot on and the bar was only an arm’s reach away.\n\nAs I rocked out and swilled some over-priced Jim Beam, I managed to snap a few photos and even tried to record a few snippets of music on my iPhone. Our place in the crowd was convenient for finding each other and being comfortable, but it wasn’t the best for photography, so you’ll have to pardon the crap quality there.\n\nThey played the hell out of Hazards, with only one tiny exception: the creepy chorus of dead children in “The Hazards of Love 3 (Revenge!)” was piped in. We supposed it would be impractical to tour with a creepy chorus of dead children (I mean what do you feed them? And are the dead subject to child labor laws?), but we’d thought there could have been some kind of creative workaround for this. Other than that, the performance of Hazards went of stupendously, and my girlfriends Shara Worden and Becky Stark were incredible – as expected. (Although it must surely have been awkward for them to be performing on stage with my boyfriend, Colin Meloy. I hope there wasn’t too much tension on my account, you know?)\n\nThe second set was made up of a bunch of old favorites, including (if I can now recall correctly), “July, July,” “The Engine Driver,” and “O! Valencia,” among others. I particularly enjoyed hearing them play “The Raincoat Song,” as it is, to me, the perfect songly incarnation of the Pacific Northwest, water wicking up your pant legs and all. It fills me with the happy sort of longing, where I am longing for something I don’t have and don’t really want all that much (wet pant legs are my sworn enemy, but I do miss their familiarity to a degree). Well, that made no sense. IRREGARDLESS, as my students would say, I enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe highlight of the second set, however, was the return to the stage of Shara Worden and Becky Stark, who absolutely fucking blew me away with their rockin’ rendition of “Crazy on You.” The original Heart version is of course a classic, but this was approximately eighty hojillion times more badassed.\n\nEmbarrassingly, I tried to record a little of it with my iPhone, thinking that I could edit the sound later with one of the many sound editing programs I seem, inexplicably, to have. I couldn’t really figure out how to do that, though, as the software kept expecting me to know things about Mhz and other letters. So anyhow, I have this EXTREMELY CRAPPY sound file that I am going to insist on posting here just BECAUSE. I suggest you not bother listening to it. It’s honestly a waste of time and it will just make you sad that you can’t listen to the real performance. If, however, you defy my warning and listen anyway, you’re going to want the volume at a low level.\n\nOn the other hand, the real performance was honestly so awesomely mind-blowing that maybe it’s best, for your SAFETY, that you are unable to appreciate it in its full glory.\n\nBefore I get into telling you all about my new summer class (which I am really loving, I must say), I’ve got to get the brief recap of my California trip out of the way. I’ve waited for a while so I could avoid going off on a decidedly not nice rant about my brother, his political opinions, and the process by which, I suspect, he has formed them. I will avoid all that – I think it’s best for all of us.\n\nSuffice it to say that my brother and I are very much like Bart and Lisa Simpson, except that we are all grown up and Bart owns actual guns. Guns. As in more than one of them. (I can only assume that, as on The Simpsons, these guns were purchased at Bloodbath and Beyond.)\n\n[Ed. Note: Friends of mine have compared my brother not to Bart Simpson but to Achewood’s Showbiz Kazenzakis. If you read Achewood, you will enjoy this idea.]\n\nJust like Bart does with Lisa, he knows exactly how to push my buttons, effortlessly sussing out whatever it is in my life that I am currently the most involved and invested in and then ruthlessly ridiculing and deriding it. It’s pretty fun. I should also say that this doesn’t necessarily bring out the best in me, and I can only excuse some of the rude things I said by thinking with satisfaction of the many other, ruder things I virtuously refrained from saying.\n\nAs always when traveling with family (as I am sure each of you already knows in your own unique, individual ways of knowing that are informed by your own family’s particular brand of craziness), one must always find serenity wherever one can. Luckily, I always feel a certain serenity whenever I am far away from the humid treacheries of New Wye. Not only was the California weather blissfully dry (every day was a serenely good hair day!) but the landscape was just as pretty as ever. The cemetery memorial gardens where my grandparents are buried inurned is a beautifully groomed, peaceful space full of flowers and towering redwoods and we all agreed it was quite lovely.\n\nOne night, on our way back to the hotel, we stopped at the grocery store to pick up some wine, sourdough, and other items for dinner. The store we happened into had been my grandparents’ neighborhood grocery for decades – a store I’d been in countless times with them during those summers when I stayed out there – and it was honestly the strangest thing. So familiar and at the same time so strange to be shopping there without them hassling me to make a request for dinner or dessert. From what I can recall, the place hadn’t changed a bit.\n\nThe day after the service we drove down and back up the coast a little bit, taking in the ocean air and relaxing. In between my brother’s painful political observations I managed to find my serenity by watching a group of kitesurfers, sampling some locally brewed beers, and sticking my feet in the Pacific. Please to enjoy these photographs:\n\nWhile we were hiking along this area, we briefly stepped off the trail to get a better look at something, and my brother wound up getting a bunch of little foxtail burrs stuck in his socks and shoes. As he was standing on one leg, hopping angrily about and cursing as he tried to get rid of the burrs, my dad dryly observed, “Well, that’s what happens when you kick the foxtails out of the way instead of just…stepping over them.” This explains everything about our family.\n\nSo, kitesurfing. Apparently, this is a real thing. I know.\n\nIf you know me, you know how much I enjoy taking road pictures from behind the windshield of a moving car. At least this time I wasn’t driving while clicking. I just love the possibilities inherent in being on a road trip and I’m always trying to capture that idea, spotty windshield or not.\n\nOn my brother’s good side, I will tell you that the beer sampler was his, and he graciously shared with me all the varieties he didn’t like. Which, rather predictably, happened to be all the varieties I preferred anyway. Sometimes it pays to be opposite in every convceivable way.\n\nTomorrow I am off on a whirlwind week of adventures, guests, and travel and I am quite full of busy anticipation. I’m going to see The Decemberists play in The Big City, host a couple of out-of-town friends here in New Wye, and then fly off to California for my grandmother’s memorial. That last item is not something I’m exactly looking forward to, you know, who enjoys a funeral, and all, but I nonetheless have to get ready for it. Practically the moment I get back to New Wye I’ve got to start teaching the first of my two summer courses. Fine. Not the exact moment I get back, but at 8:00 the next morning. Which, to my jet-lagged body, will feel like 6:00 am. Um, yeah. That’ll be nice.\n\nWhat this has meant is that this week I’ve had to get all the course prep-work done (dealing with book-order problems on not one but two texts I need, making the syllabus, planning lessons, yada yada), pack for two trips (City Overnighter and California Weekend + Funeral = weird packing combinations), and make my house guest-ready.\n\nOh and another thing: starting tomorrow morning, I’m responsible for my own pets plus Egon’s little friend, Diego the Chihuahua. My friend B., Diego’s human, is traveling out of the country for a while and her dog will be staying with me while I’m here. While I’m away, he and Eegs will be boarded together. This will be the first time for him to be boarded while I’m away, and thinking about that has been yet another source of stress leading up to the trips.\n\nAs you can imagine, I’m feeling pretty cranked up lately. I tried to take a nap this afternoon, but I couldn’t. I was feeling too weird and anxious, so I decided to get up and work out instead, which actually helped. Now I am going to try to relax a bit, do my nails, and get myself in the right mindset to have a pleasant and delightful trip to the city with some of my best friends to see The Decemberists. (SO. MUCH. YAY.) I may not be posting for a while here, but you can always follow my mundanities on twitter if you miss me too much."
