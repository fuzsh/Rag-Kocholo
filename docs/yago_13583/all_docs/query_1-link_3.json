        "text": "[Leggi il testo in italiano]\n\nF.A.M.I.L.Y. is an ongoing video series made in collaboration with strangers (part of the solo exhibition Miranda July: New Society at Osservatorio Fondazione Prada, March 7 – October 28, 2024).\n\nIf you’d like to submit a video, follow the instructions below.\n\nI’ll be selecting from submissions and making three new videos that will be added to the show over the course of its run.\n\nThank you and I look forward to merging with you in some impossible new way, yet with both of us also safely alone and apart!\n\nmj\n\nInstructions:\n\nShoot a video of yourself interacting with me (“me”) (I’ll add myself later, inspired by whatever you do.)\n\nYou can wear what you like. A suit. A bathing suit. Sexy or not. Athletic, cute, ugly, whatever. Or you can isolate part of your body with a sheet, or cover it entirely to make yourself less human.\n\nStand far enough away from the camera that your whole body is visible.\n\nTry to remember that someone else is there with you, even though you are alone in the room right now. See them, feel them, look them in the eye (if your face isn’t covered).\n\nPerhaps draw from what you’ve been feeling or needing.\n\nWalk into frame. Or crawl, or slide, or drag yourself in… and then exit the frame at the end, before turning off the camera.\n\nUse only one hand when “touching” me (my technology is very simple and I can only go in front of or behind a hand, not between two hands).\n\nNo talking.\n\nSuper Important:\n\nChange your phone settings so that your phone shoots in 4K and 30FPS.\n\nUse the camera on the back of your phone.\n\nDon’t wear black or white clothes.\n\nThe video should be between 1 and 2 minutes.\n\nMake sure you are well lit (so light is in front of you, not behind you).\n\nTry not to be in front of things that are the same color as your skin or clothes.\n\nMake sure the video file is as big as possible, don’t compress it or make it smaller.\n\nUPLOAD USING THIS FORM, WHICH MAY ASK YOU TO SIGN INTO GOOGLE FIRST:\n\nhttps://forms.gle/MzmHc37Vw9H4mNa26\n\nYou are welcome to upload another video if you get a new idea. This call is open through the summer of 2024.\n\nIf your video is selected we will reach out; no submissions will be used in a final work without your written consent.\n\nJuly was asked by Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin to create a new work for the 2020 Edition 46 of the magazine. Past artists who have received this invitation are Sophie Calle and Maurizio Cattelan.\n\nThe photograph series she made with Jay Benedicto was developed into a limited edition book sculpture with Mack Books in London.\n\nExcerpt:\n\nOn March 13th I was heading to meet a friend at a cafe when I got a message from my child’s school announcing that they were shutting down indefinitely. This was the start of the pandemic for me, the first dawning that this was really happening, I could not ignore it. While I waited for my friend to arrive I texted my husband & everyone I knew, in shock, coming to realize this wasn’t just our school, our world, it was every school, the whole world. In the midst of this texting frenzy I got a phone call from an unfamiliar number. Right away it was clear that this was some kind of solicitation; the caller had a slight accent & the overt professionalism of someone offering “services”. Normally I would have hung up; I’m still surprised I didn’t. I suppose when your world has just been blasted open you are distraught, yes, but also: open. I stepped outside & began answering the caller’s questions. It became obvious that this offer was directed towards a very specific niche of hungry, unaffiliated people: self-published authors. Through some error I had ended up on this list. Was I interested in getting hundreds, maybe even thousands of new readers? “Well, my last couple books were on the New York Times best-seller list,” I said, “But sure, why not. New readers are always great.” I answered each question truthfully, kind of showing off in a way I would never usually do. It was as if I really wanted to impress this solicitor. When they were all done with their script they conceded that I did not, in fact, need their services. “Can I ask you some questions now?” The solicitor laughed, “What type of questions?” I asked where they were calling from (The Philippines), how old they were (27), what they liked to do when they weren’t at work (karaoke). “Are you a woman?” I asked. “Yes. I’m a trans woman,” Jay said. There was a rapport despite distances of all kinds. My friend arrived; I waved and held up one finger as I hurried to finish the call. I asked Jay if she used Instagram & she agreed to DM me. The following pages grew out of our exchange over the last six months, our first six months of this pandemic.\n\nGraphic Design by Chris Svensson\n\nThank you Jamie Dornan\n\nInterview by Mareike Neiberding with photographs by Elizabeth Weinberg.\n\nLimited Edition book sculpture with MACK BOOKS\n\nBy Miranda July with Oumarou Idrissa, commissioned for “The Future Starts Here” exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.\n\nFour velvet curtains open and close sporadically, of their own accord. A short text by July hangs alongside each curtain:\n\nOn 22 August 2015 I called for an Uber, and a man named Oumarou Idrissa picked me up from my house in Los Angeles. He drove me to Malibu in a black SUV. On the long drive across the city, Oumarou told me the story of his life, which began in a village in Niger, West Africa. He came to the U.S. on a student visa, hoping to attend the University of Idaho. When he couldn’t afford the tuition, he faced the possibility of deportation and was forced into hiding. He needed to stay in America; his family was counting on the money he could make there. During the worst of these years he was often homeless, which he kept secret. And he always knew that immigration agents were looking for him. He woke up every two hours, thinking: ‘They’re here’. Now Oumarou is a U.S. citizen – but he still can’t sleep more than two hours at a time and never more than a total of four or five hours a night.\n\nFor this project, I asked Oumarou if he would share his insomnia in real time and he agreed, hoping that telling his story of sleeplessness might actually bring him the peace he needs to finally sleep. We installed a sleep tracker program in his bed, and he began routing his phone data through a custom server that silently detects which apps he’s using, since he usually looks at his phone during these restless hours. When it’s midnight for Oumarou, the day is just starting in Niger and also here, in London. As he generates information throughout the night, it’s sent to the curtains in the exhibition.\n\n1. When the blue curtains are completely closed, Oumarou is asleep on his queen-sized mattress on the floor of his studio apartment in Los Angeles. If the curtains are partially open or moving, then he’s sleeping fitfully. His sleep data triggers this movement via a smart curtain track powered by a Somfy® motor. Sometimes he dreams of someone pushing down on him so he can’t move or get up. Sometimes he dreams he’s in Niger, talking to his mother about ordinary things. If the curtains are wide open, then he’s awake.\n\n2. Each time the brown curtains open, Oumarou has opened WhatsApp – the free, secure, worldwide messaging service. Every night around 11pm he begins to talk and message with his friends and family in Niger. ‘I don’t have any close friends in America’, he told me, ‘so my phone is my everything’. He exchanges videos and pictures with his 21 sisters and brothers and responds to requests for money, most often to pay for food, school tuitions, christenings and medicine. He used to talk to his mum every night, but she passed away two years ago. Just before she died, Oumarou texted to tell me she was sick. We had sporadically kept in touch after our long drive together. Just a few hours later he texted me that she had died, and he was headed back to Niger for her funeral.\n\n3. If the pink curtains are open, Oumarou has tapped ‘online’ on the Uber app, making himself available to receive calls for rides. Like most UberBLACK drivers, he leases a black SUV and often barely makes enough money to cover the cost of the lease. At times he has also lived in his leased cars, as many UberBLACK drivers do. ‘When you sleep in a new SUV you wake up sick from the fumes’, Oumarou told me. We met up when he got back from his mother’s funeral in Niger. He was frustrated that he had lost his place to live while he was out of the country. I rent a small house where I work from 9am to 5pm, so I suggested he live in it from 5pm to 9am until he got a new place. We shared the house in this way for seven months.\n\n4. When the green curtains are open, Oumarou is looking at Instagram. He posts pictures of soccer games, family, luxury hotels and beaches (from his side job as a travelling bodyguard). On 8 November 2016, he posted a video of himself voting for Hillary Clinton: I vote for Her. First time voter, historic day. Since we were registered to the same address, I showed him our polling place and we voted together. On 9 November, he wrote: The way I feel last nite was the worst feeling I ever have in my life. We love you Hillary this pain will go forever. Later that day he wrote: Motherland we coming back, and I wondered if he really would go back to Niger. On 10 November he posted a video of himself in the black suit he wears to drive for Uber; he was standing tall by a rooftop pool in Beverly Hills. I’m the president, baby, he said. And then, speaking as the president, he told us to: Stay focused, stay humble, you know, be positive in life, enjoy, life is beautiful, baby.\n\nNote: If Oumarou is sick, travelling, or needs privacy, this work runs on a pre-recorded script.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nGarage\n\ni-D\n\nElephant\n\nThere are more than 10,000 charity shops in the UK and now there is a unique addition with the launch of artist, writer and filmmaker Miranda July ’s major commission for Artangel, an interfaith charity shop open to the public from 31 August – 22 October 2017 on the third floor of Selfridges.\n\nThe UK’s first interfaith charity shop is run and staffed jointly by four religious charities chosen by Miranda July: Islamic Relief, Jewish charity Norwood, London Buddhist Centre and Spitalfields Crypt Trust. The proceeds will be shared equally between the four partners, all of who run their own charity shops. Items for sale are typical of those traditionally sold in charity shops – second – hand clothes, books, games, DVD’s, kitchen ware, toys ornaments and bric – a – brac. Prices are the same as in any charity shop.\n\nNet sales are divided equally between the four participating charity shops. Each is donating 2.5% of their share to another charity of their choice: Islamic Relief is donating to The Bike Project; Norwood to Carers in Hertfordshire; London Buddhist Centre to Praxis Community Project; and Spitalfields Crypt Trust to Providence Row.\n\nMiranda July is known for artworks that depend upon the public’s participation — be they apps, performances or sculptures. Her interfaith charity shop at Selfridges will present customers with an unexpected retail experience that will resonate with founder Harry Gordon Selfridge’s famous pronouncement in 1909 that his store was created as an open house, where “everyone is welcome.”\n\nMiranda July said: “For many years I’ve wanted to make a store as artwork; utilizing the inherently participatory conventions of commerce. When I first came to London, in my twenties, the sheer number of charity shops giddily amazed me, but it’s only in creating this store with Artangel that I understand what a radically unique economic model they are. The nuances of this come from my faith – based charity shop partners and from the site; Selfridges.”\n\nMichael Morris & James Lingwood, Co – Directors of Artangel, said: “Artists continually lead Artangel into uncharted territory so we are delighted to be collaborating with Miranda July in joining forces with four faith – based charities on the third floor of Selfridges. Our shop within a shop, like London itself, is proudly open to the world.”\n\nMiranda July in conversation with Jeremy Deller\n\nOpen to the World documentary VF.com\n\nINFO ABOUT THE ORGANIZATIONS\n\nArtangel view website\n\nArtangel produces and presents extraordinary art in unexpected places in London, the UK and beyond.

In 2003 W. Galen Weston purchased Selfridges and under his ownership Selfridges has become an extraordinary global destination for fashion, luxury and retail theatre. In June 2010 Selfridges was named Best Department Store in the World for the first time by the IGDS (Intercontinental Group of Department Store s). The title, which Selfridges held until June 2012, is the industry’s highest accolade. Selfridges won the title again in June 2012, and again in 2014 for an unprecedented three times consecutively. In May 2016, Selfridges won the inaugural award for World’s Best Sustainability Campaign at the IGDS world summit. Selfridges has four stores in London, Birmingham and Manchester (Trafford Centre, Exchange Square) and our international website now delivers within the UK and to over 130 countries, trading in eight currencies.

Their approach combines Christian values with best practice and innovation. They help people of all faiths and none.\n\nSomebody\n\nA new messaging service by Miranda July\n\nTexting is tacky. Calling is awkward. Email is old.\n\nOn August 28th Miranda July unveils a new way to communicate: Somebody — an app created with support from Miu Miu, available in the iTunes store as a free download (iOS only).\n\nWhen you send your friend a message through Somebody, it goes — not to your friend — but to the Somebody user nearest your friend. This person (probably a stranger) delivers the message verbally, acting as your stand-in. The app launched at the Venice Film Festival along with a short companion film, part of Miu Miu’s Women’s Tales series.\n\nSince Somebody is brand new early adapters are integral to its creation — the most high-tech part of the app is not in the phone, it’s in the users who dare to deliver a message to stranger. “I see this as far-reaching public art project, inciting performance and conversation about the value of inefficiency and risk,” says July.\n\nSomebody works best with a critical mass of users in a given area; colleges, workplaces, parties and concerts can become Somebody hotspots simply by designating themselves as one (details on somebodyapp.com).\n\nOfficial Somebody hotspots so far include Los Angeles County Museum of Art (with a presentation by Ms. July on Sept. 11), The New Museum (presentation on Oct. 9), Yerba Buena Center for The Arts (San Francisco), Portland Institute for Contemporary Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, The Walker Art Center (Minneapolis), and Museo Jumex (Mexico City.) Museum-goers are invited to send and deliver messages in these spaces where there are likely to be other users.\n\nWith Miu Miu’s support, July worked closely with designer Thea Lorentzen and a team of developers at the award winning Stinkdigital to create the complex, GPS-based messaging system. Half-app / half-human, Somebody twists our love of avatars and outsourcing —every relationship becomes a three-way. The antithesis of the utilitarian efficiency that tech promises, here, finally, is an app that makes us nervous, giddy, and alert to the people around us.\n\n“When you can’t be there…Somebody can.”\n\nVisit somebodyapp.com for movie, media kit and details.\n\nContact us at info@somebodyapp.com\n\nDetails:\n\n• Add actions and directions for your stand-in, such as [crying] or [hug] — or write your own.\n\n• The recipient always has the option of declining a delivery before it’s set in to motion, if now’s not a good time.\n\n• The first sentence of the message is automatically “[Recipient’s name]? It’s me, [Sender’s Name]” — reminding the stand-in to assume the identity of the sender.\n\n• Somebody™ uses GPS to locate your friend and users nearby, then presents you with photos and performance ratings so you can choose the best possible delivery person for your message.\n\nIf there’s no one nearby, you can choose to “float” your message indefinitely. Users interested in being a stand-in can browse nearby floating messages and pick one to deliver.\n\nWebsite.\n\nTumblr."
