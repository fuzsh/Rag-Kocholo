        "text": "from waynekramer.com ….\n\nBrother Wayne (foreground) as guitarist on stage in full regalia with Juini Booth (left, stand-up bass) and the entire Sun Ra Arkestra.\n\nMY NIGHT AS A TONE SCIENTIST\n\nIn the half-between world,\n\nDwell they: The Tone Scientists\n\nIn notes and tone\n\nThey speak of many things…\n\nThe tone scientists:\n\nArchitects of planes of discipline\n\nMathematically precise are they:\n\nThe tone-scientists\n\n(Sun Ra)\n\nBrazilian percussionist Elson Nascimento called last week and invited me to sit in with The Sun Ra Arkestra under the direction of Marshall Allen. They were Saturday night’s ArthurFest headliners, a four-day music festival held here in Los Angeles and curated by Arthur Magazine.\n\nWas I thrilled? That’s putting it mildly. I have had a long-time admiration for the work of Sun Ra and his merry band of intergalactic explorers. Still do today.\n\nI was first exposed to them in the 1960s with their ESP Disc, The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra and others. Those records – and the fact that John Sinclair booked us on a concert co-headlining with them at the Community Arts Auditorium at Wayne State University in Detroit – changed the way I would think about music for the rest of my life.\n\nWe continued to perform on concerts with The Arkestra over the next few years and I came to spend some time with Sun Ra himself. His ideas about Art, Music and culture helped form my own. In the Modern Age, with the resurgence of interest in the MC5, we have been able to reconnect with The Arkestra for concerts in London, New York and Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough Sun Ra and some of the other founding members have gone on to Saturn, the band continues to travel the space ways under the able leadership of alto genius Marshall Allen. Many of the players on the band have long-time membership and the spirit remains completely intact.\n\nSo when I got the call, it was as if I was at once being asked to enter into a fifth dimension of my own past and future.\n\nWhen I arrived at the gig, I took some good-natured kidding from the musicians about the traditional black suit and tie I was wearing. (I had just come directly from a TV studio where my current project, The Lexington Artists Workshop Ensemble, had performed a couple of numbers for the Hep C Awareness Telethon.)\n\nI was informed that, in order to perform with The Arkestra, I would need to be outfitted with the appropriate space uniform. No problem. I put on the dark blue sequined robe and matching headwear with joy.\n\nWhen I asked Marshall what numbers I should play on he said, “Play it all. Just be ready, because there is no way to know what might happen.” This has been my personal attitude for years and here it was being conferred on me by one of the masters. Was I ready? Yes, brother! I have been waiting for this night all my life.\n\nI was talking in the dressing room with trumpeter Fred Adams about the music Sun Ra composed and left to them. He told me they have just scratched the surface on the mother load of unrecorded material. Marshall talked with me about the dilemma of having so much music and so little time to perform it.\n\nI’m not someone who goes for the ritual of a group hug or prayer before a performance, but when I was told to “join-up” right before time to play I was honored to be included. This wasn’t a religious rite, but an invocation to recognize together who we were and what we were doing right then and there. That we were about to “create music for a better world. On this planet and all other planets!” And that we were all, “Sun Ra”.\n\nI took the stage with the players and never felt more proud to be an artist punching in on the job.\n\nThe music was expansive. We played inside and outside the forms. Some tunes I could grasp the basic 16-bar II-V-I structure and others were way too difficult to attempt. I was standing next to bassist Juini Booth and could read some changes from his charts but often they came just too fast and furious for me. Other tunes were deep, deep space grooves that I locked into and worked as relentlessly as I could.\n\nThis kind of playing takes a great deal of concentration and my sore wrists reminded me of it later. Marshall was so gracious in granting me a few solo passages. For me, this was Heaven. Of course there were interludes of music that some might call “free music,” although this is a misnomer. When and how you play in this context is anything but free. This is about discipline, not freedom, which was one of the principles at the core of Sun Ra’s philosophy.\n\nMarshall was a consummate bandleader in directing us through these sections. He was very clear and confident about what he wanted and when he wanted it. The Arkestra played, danced and sang and the audience enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nArkestra guitarist, David Hotep is a master chordist and I was trying to keep up, but it was like trying to catch a comet.\n\nDave Davis on trombone showed his great enthusiasm for music throughout the set, along with baritone saxophonist Rey Scott. As usual, drummer Luquman Ali drove the band with cosmic precision. The final notes played were a joyful exchange between Marshall Allen and tenor saxophonist Yahya Abdul-Majid.\n\nBefore I realized it, we had played for an hour and 30 minutes and it was time to go. We had traveled the space ways from planet to planet and returned to earth, all the better for it.\n\nSometimes it just doesn’t get any better.\n\nCheck it out: http://www.elrarecords.com/band.html\n\nWayne Kramer, Los Angeles. 10.23.06\n\nOctober 24, 2006 Los Angeles Times\n\nCRITIC’S NOTEBOOK\n\nDiversity is king at Arthur Nights\n\nThe counterculture magazine’s musical blowout packs a restorative punch with its sheer eclecticism.\n\nBy Ann Powers, Times Staff Writer\n\nSomething strange happened to this critic’s ears on the journey home from this weekend’s Arthur Nights concerts at the Palace Theatre downtown: they pricked up. Every song flowing out of the car radio sounded fresh and full of potential. Forty acts sampled over three long evenings should have produced exhaustion, but instead the pageant was restorative, thanks to music that kept raising questions about what it means to make music at all.\n\nThis most ambitious public event so far from the Los Angeles-based countercultural rag Arthur showcased artists whose work is au courant enough to give rise to many irritating catchphrases — drone-rock, orch-pop, psych-folk.\n\nSingle-minded concertgoers might have found their specialty and clung to it. For fans of punky women rockers there were the Heartless Bastards, Be Your Own Pet, Effie Briest. Mystic song-spinners included Josephine Foster and Mia Doi Todd. There were knowing elders (Michael Hurley, Ruthann Friedman, the Watts Prophets), and brain-melting noise generators (Charalambides, Om). Hip-hop was the great absence felt; otherwise, the field was fertile.\n\nThis eclecticism allowed for unforeseen connections. What did Kyp Malone, the singer with the semi-ambient art-rock group TV on the Radio — who delivered a sweetly improvisational solo set Sunday, proving his talent beyond the sonic manipulations of his band — have in common with Jemina Pearl, the teenage screamer with the endearing punk revivalist quartet Be Your Own Pet? What might Marshall Allen, the 82-year-old custodian of jazz saint Sun Ra’s Arkestra, which closed out Saturday with a bang, say to Becky Stark, the dubiously wide-eyed chanteuse who performed with the Living Sisters upstairs at the same moment? The answer has to do with challenging frameworks, from pop songwriting to artistic identity itself.\n\nOn Friday, the duo Charalambides exemplified the Arthur Nights style of inquiry. Strumming instruments forcefully to produce resonating echoes, once-married duo Tom and Christina Carter raised a wall of intoxicating sound scaled, like ivy, by Ms. Carter’s almost ambient vocals. This beauty held dissonance in its hand, revealing the echoes within folk songs and the softer turns within minimalist noise-rock.\n\nThe Living Sisters, featuring Eleni Mandell and Inara George along with Stark, produced a more comfortable sound, crooning ballads that would suit a Martin Scorsese soundtrack. But the group’s slyly satirical performance was far more David Lynch. Dressed in matching sequined disco dresses, having fun with synchronized dance moves, the Living Sisters seemed like a joke — until they broke into those lovely songs, languid with harmonies, and blurred the line between making fun of the past and longing for it.\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces, led by the siblings Matthew and Eleanor Friedberger, smudged different lines by playing most of the new album “Bitter Tea,” as one long song. Propelled by the Talking Heads-like rhythms of percussionists Bob D’Amico and Michael Goodman, and guitarist Jason Loewenstein, with Eleanor intoning her brother’s lyrics like a Shakespearean dame and Matthew raising the dust of his prog and pop influences on his keyboard, the Fiery Furnaces seemed more like a “new music” ensemble than an “indie-rock” band. It’s the point of the Arthur scene to put such labels in quotes, as free-thinking musicians move determinedly between them.\n\nThe four-day festival did have some problems. The lovely, decaying Palace proved dubious for amplified music; as happens in many old theaters, a lot got lost in the rafters. Upstairs, quieter acts were challenged by chattering drinkers in the back. Some artists, including the dynamic veteran spoken-word ensemble the Watts Prophets, boldly overcame the technical difficulties. Others, such as the folk revivalist Josephine Foster, did not. “The harp and I are not making love tonight,” Foster murmured before giving up on that instrument during her disjointed set. It can be hard to get intimate with your own talent in a large, echoing room.\n\nDespite these problems, Arthur Nights showed that the pop underground is still digging up and mulching old assumptions. The noisily brilliant rock band Comets on Fire made the perfect final statement. Its guitar turmoil, maddened by heavy drums and the sound loops produced by Noel von Harmonson’s vintage Echo-Electronics device, swept the crowd into a time-and-space tunnel where California psychedelia met English heavy metal, New York No Wave and Seattle grunge.\n\nAfter such a trip, whose ears wouldn’t pop?\n\nEthan Miller of Comets on Fire during last year’s ArthurFest performance\n\n(photo courtesy IceCreamMan.com)\n\nReview of Comets on Fire at ICA, London by\n\nTom Hughes in the Wednesday October 11, 2006 edition of The Guardian:\n\n[5 out of 5 stars]\n\n“It’s a sure sign that a band is going to be loud when the floor starts shaking as soon as they turn on the amplifiers. Before Comets on Fire have even begun, the ICA is trembling underfoot from the feedback, and when the band do explode into life it’s a gigantic, deafening joy.\n\n“Comets on Fire’s brand of arty, psychedelic rock is going through a purple patch in the US, but these stormy Californians seem to have the creative edge. Their recent albums (including this year’s superb Avatar) are full of soulful, jazzy subtleties that lift them way beyond the norm, and the power of their delivery tonight makes it all the more exciting.\n\n“The extra noise and speed with which the songs are attacked removes some of the precision – things get downright free-form at times. Ethan Miller and Ben Chasny’s guitars often break into lengthy, abstract wailings, while the five scruffy silhouettes flail around behind the strobes and dry ice. It is an overwhelming spectacle that comes close to achieving the ultimate way-out rock sound.\n\n“But equally great things happen when they ease off the volume. Jaybird revolves around a slinky guitar line that could almost be Cream or the Band of Gypsies, and the epic instrumental, Sour Smoke, moves through passages of delicate riffing with effective restraint. And, although the emphasis seems to be on sonic exploration rather than songwriting, Lucifer’s Memory puts Miller’s vocal upfront in a classy soul ballad that is the most melodic moment all night, and a great example of how far they can stretch their style.\n\n“Another spacey, psychedelic meltdown closes the set, and as the lights come up, the audience stumbles out, grinning. As an example of pure power matched by creative sophistication, tonight will be hard to beat.“\n\nComets on Fire will perform Sunday, October 22 at the Arthur Nights festival at the Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles. Other acts performing that night are Fiery Furnaces, Kyp Malone (TV on the Radio), The Sharp Ease, The Archie Bronson Outfit, Ocrilim, The Nice Boys, SSM, The Colossal Yes (feat. Utrillo of Comets on Fire), the Chuck Dukowski Sextet, Effi Briest and C.B. Brand.
