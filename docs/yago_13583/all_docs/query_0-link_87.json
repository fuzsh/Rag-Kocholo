        "text": "My bio is a million pages long and it doesn’t even mention the time I met the president of East Timor:\n\nBecky Braunstein grew up on a mountain in Eagle River, Alaska where she had no one to talk to, moved to America after being diagnosed with metastatic thyroid cancer and almost losing her voice forever - but she didn’t lose it, and now she won’t shut up. A uniquely enthusiastic comedian and actor, she appears in Trinkets on Netflix, Chad on TBS, Shrill on Hulu, and was recently featured in Teen Vogue, in an article which insisted that each one of her life experiences \"deserves [its] own television show\". Wanda Sykes & Page Hurwitz agreed, producing Becky’s half-hour stand-up/documentary special as part of ‘Unprotected Sets’ on MGM+. Becky is a fast-rising, one-in-a-million performer with fresh energy and wide-eyed enthusiasm that is impossible to ignore. Her scripted comedy pilot Cancer Culture was named a winner by the Yes And Laughter Lab, sponsored by Comedy Central, and she recently directed the music video for ‘Hey New Zealand’ by The Exbats."
