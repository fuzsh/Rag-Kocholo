Students may also take diverse electives such as film and television critical and historical studies, screenwriting, directing actors, makeup fundamentals, production design, etc. Individual Directed Research Projects are encouraged. These courses afford the student an opportunity to work one-on-one with faculty mentors, allowing the student to pursue targeted interests in aesthetic or technical subjects. Cinematography students also serve as the director of photography on projects written and directed by students specializing in the Production/Directing MFA specialization.\n\nTHIRD YEAR\n\nStudents who enter a third year of study in Cinematography complete a Thesis project in the form of an academic research paper, coupled with a creative or technical project on an aspect of cinematography of interest to them. Combining a written document with original photography, students may create a research project that contributes original knowledge to the field."
