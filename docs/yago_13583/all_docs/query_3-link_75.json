        "text": "Like the Beep Beep Beep of the Tom-Tom\n\nAfter visiting the doctor, Blanche learns that he wants to put a pacemaker in her. However, after the operation, Blanche is so scared of intimacy that she decides to give up sex.\n\nIn-Laws\n\nWhen Ray's in-laws come for a visit, he begs his parents to be nice to them and accept their differences even though their lifestyles are worlds apart. Ray admits to his parents that he doesn't always see eye to eye with Debra's folks but manages to fake it.\n\nThe Toaster\n\nRay is overjoyed by the reaction he is getting from friends and family who received a personalized \"Barone\" toaster from him as a gift -- even Debra's pretentious parents are thrilled with it. But, having heard nothing from his parents, Ray confronts Frank and Marie, the two people whose approval matters most, and is amazed beyond belief to hear what they did with the gift."
