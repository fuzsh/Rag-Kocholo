        "text": "Marvel shocked audiences at San Diego Comic-Con Saturday by announcing Robert Downey Jr. as the new Doctor Doom. Downey, however, isn’t the first actor cast in the role for the big screen.\n\nThe first big news to come out of Marvel’s presentation at the San Diego Comic-Con was the improbable news that Anthony and Joe Russo—who directed four Marvel Cinematic Universe movies including Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame—were returning to direct another two Avengers chapters.\n\nAs it turns out, the reintroduction of the Russo brothers was merely an opening act to the main event, where Downey lifted a Doctor Doom mask off his face on-stage to announce that he would be playing the MCU’s iron-clad supervillain in Avengers: Doomsday in 2026 and Avengers Secret Wars in 2027.\n\nForbesPhotos: Marvel's Wild San Diego Comic-Con Panel With Robert Downey Jr.\n\nDowney’s Iron Man/Tony Stark, of course, was the guiding light of the Avengers until the character’s tragic screen death at the end of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nWhile Doctor Doom made his debut in The Fantastic Four #5 on July 1, 1961, per Marvel Comics, it took more than four decades for the First Family of Superheroes’ nemesis to officially appear in live-action on the big screen.\n\nDoctor Doom was created by none other than Marvel Comics writer Stan Lee and his venerable artistic partner, penciller Jack Kirby.\n\nHere’s a look at the actors who have played live-action versions of Doctor Doom in movies before, including one whose appearance remains unofficial to this day.\n\nJoseph Culp (Unofficially, 1994)\n\nJoseph Culp played Doctor Doom/Victor Von Doom in the ill-fated, unreleased version of The Fantastic Four in 1994.\n\nA low-budget film produced by German filmmaker Bernd Eichinger under legendary producer Roger Corman’s New World Pictures banner, the first Fantastic Four movie was doomed—for the lack of a better word—from the start.\n\n“They had a script for a film with a $30 million budget but wanted to make it for $1 million,” Corman told The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. “My first thought was ‘Now that’s a challenge. We might have to trim a few things.’”\n\nAfter the film was made on the cheap, Eichinger had a change of heart about releasing it and the film remains unreleased to this day.\n\n“I went to lunch with Bernd, who told me he’d sold both the film and the rights to Fox, who was going to make a $60 million version and they didn’t want this low-budget movie around,” Corman recalled for THR. “I was kind of disappointed because it would have been an interesting challenge to distribute, but I was sitting there with a pretty hefty check.”\n\nThe unreleased Fantastic Four trailer, however, exists on YouTube, as does bootleg copies of the unreleased movie.\n\nForbesBlake Lively Gets Ladypool 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Action Figure\n\nIn addition to Culp, the unreleased version of The Fantastic Four stars Alex Hyde-White as Dr. Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Rebecca Staab as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Jay Underwood as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Michael Bailey Smith as Ben Grimm/The Thing. The movie was directed by Oley Sassone.\n\nLuckily, Joseph Culp—the son of legendary actor Robert Culp—didn’t suffer any collateral damage to his acting career after The Fantastic Four debacle in 1994. Culp was already in showbiz about 10 years before he donned the mask of Doctor Doom and he’s appeared in about three-dozen films and TV shows since.\n\nAmong Culp’s credits are guest turns on such hit series as Mad Men, House, New Girl and ironically, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nJulian McMahon (2005, 2007)\n\nJulian McMahon was already leading a successful career when got the call to play Doctor Doom/Victor Von Doom for director Tim Story’s version of Fantastic Four for 20th Century Fox in 2005.\n\nPrior to his work on the film, McMahon starred in the hit dramas Profiler and Charmed and was in the middle of working on Nip/Tuck for producer director Ryan Murphy.\n\nMcMahon played Doctor Doom in both Fantastic Four and its sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. The films also starred Ioan Gruffudd as Dr. Reed Richards/Mister , Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/The Thing.\n\nIn addition to his work as Doctor Doom on the two Fantastic Four movies, McMahon has starred in such films as Premonition and RED, and the TV series FBI, FBI: International and FBI: Most Wanted.\n\nMcMahon will next star opposite Nicolas Cage in the movie thriller The Surfer.\n\nToby Kebbell (2015)\n\nToby Kebbell played Doctor Doom/Victor Von Doom in 20th Century Fox’s 2015 reboot of Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank.\n\nLike Joseph Culp and Julian McMahon, Kebbell was already established as an actor when the opportunity to play Doctor Doom came along, having appeared in such movies as RocknRolla, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, War Horse and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nKebbell played Doctor Doom in the Fantastic Four reboot opposite Miles Teller as Dr. Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic, Kate Mara as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm/The Thing.\n\nSince appearing as Doctor Doom in Fantastic Four, Kebbell has starred in such films as Warcraft, Kong: Skull Island, War for the Planet of the Apes and Bloodshot. On TV, Kebbell has also starred in the M. Night Shyamalan series Servant and For All Mankind."
