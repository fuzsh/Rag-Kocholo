        "text": "“GO SEE” (recommended production) – San Francisco Bay Area Theatre Critics’ Circle\n\nAt once both sidesplittingly funny and charmingly romantic, ME AND MY GIRL was a major hit on the West End in 1937, but was largely unknown in the United States until a Broadway production in 1986, where it also became a major success. This fish-out-of-water comedy is the story of a roustabout Cockney lad who learns he’s actually an Earl and must try to adjust to his new upper-class life. Several of the songs from the show became major hits of the day, including “Leaning On a Lamppost,” “The Lambeth Walk” and the title song.\n\nME AND MY GIRL runs about two hours and fifteen minutes, including one intermission.\n\nPRESS REVIEWS\n\n(Click on links for full reviews)\n\n“Maybe the best show 42nd Street Moon has done in years!” Eddy Reynolds, Theatre Eddys\n\n“Upbeat, feel-good fun.” – Ilana Walder-Biesanz, Stark Insider\n\n“42nd Street Moon’s production shines” – George Heymont, Medium.com\n\n“42nd Street Moon, champions of the art, spirit and preservation of musical theater, has outdone itself with this spirited production” – Steve Murray, ForAllEvents.info\n\n“A delightful romp” – Alexandra Garfield, Theatre By The Bay\n\n“Your toes will be tapping while you hum…earns a solid ‘must see’ rating.” – Kedar Adour, ForAllEvents.info\n\nClick on pictures for full-size images\n\nMEET THE CAST\n\n*Member of Actors’ Equity Association\n\nEXPERIENCE A FULLER MOON\n\nOpening Night Receptions\n\nJoin the cast and crew as we celebrate the opening of each new production. Savor champagne, wine, and delectable delights from our Opening Night sponsor. The best part? It’s on us!\n\nOpening Night date for Me and My Girl: Saturday, May 5, 6:00 PM\n\nDiscussion Sundays\n\nGet all your burning questions answered about the show you’ve just seen during our fun and informative post-performance discussions with the audience, cast, and crew. Hosted by Executive Directors Daren A.C. Carollo and Daniel Thomas, who will share the history of the original production as well as our current incarnation! Learn more about the composers, lyricists, and book writers, as well as your favorite Moonie cast members. Discussion Sundays happen on the first and second Sunday of each show in our regular season offerings.\n\nDiscussion Sunday dates for Me and My Girl: May 6 & 13, 3:00 PM\n\nFamily & Student Matinees\n\nThe best deal in town for kids, parents, and students of all ages. Young people under 18 and college students with a valid student ID can see the show for just $10! Younger students receive a family activity guide, get to participate in an intermission contest (with prizes!), and can join in on a post-show discussion and visit with the actors that includes autographs and pictures. This is a great way to introduce the next generation to the heritage of American musical theatre. This is also a great idea for a kid’s birthday party. Please contact Education Director Dyan McBride for further details or if you have a large group wishing to attend.\n\n42nd Street Moon created the Family Matinee to make musical theatre affordable and accessible for young people along with their parents and to provide families the opportunity to experience classic Broadway. Relevant, fun activities and fascinating discussion guides enable families to rediscover how theatre has served an important function in our nation’s cultural landscape and been a way for families to come together. We have expanded the matinee to be a Family and Student Matinee, so that college-aged students can also take advantage of the generous discount."
