I am fascinated by the nature surrounding me and how I play a part in sustaining the planet Earth, otherwise known as our home. My college career started in community college where I explored these concepts in a class that I fell in love with titled Natural Resources. I was so inspired by this class that I changed my lifestyle and my diet to take into account environmental justice, becoming a plant-based eater and a gardener. I graduated with my AA in English at College of the Desert, and two years later I graduated with my BA in Literature and Writing. I became an assistant teacher at the college level while completing my undergraduate studies at the University of California, San Diego. At UC San Diego I integrated my knowledge of environmental justice, social justice, and sustainability into an interpersonal and collaborative approach to teaching. What I learned along the way is that environmental sustainability is social just as much as personal, and it relies on our collaborative efforts to be maintained appropriately. In my free time, I love to write, thrift, practice yoga, and hike along the beautiful San Jacinto mountainside. I am proud to be a staff member at ACE because this organization aligns with my values and beliefs. As we welcome people of diverse backgrounds to help in these environmental efforts, we take agency in sustaining this planet for many generations to come.\n\nHi! Kevin here.

These islands oral histories share sensory experiences of immersion in place, and when engaged in these stories Jennifer evokes heart-centered practices. These practices involve work with community-based archaeology to expand the stories in the webs of relations of past experiences to include the animals, the spirits, and the other-than-human beings with traditional scientific rigor. Jennifer’s background is in underwater cultural heritage of the Asia Pacific Region. Jennifer used archaeology/museology methodologies to organize data and note patterns (esp. spatial and particular locations), linguistic methodologies to study cultural concepts and a human worldview; and all in tandem with her specialization in Maritime Archaeology, which aims to understand and interpret the past relationships between humans and WATER.\n\nKelli Barnes is a scholar whose interests include 18th and 19th-century United States history, Black American girlhood, transatlantic material culture, interpretive planning, and exhibit design.

Fueled by my interest in all things animals and natural spaces, I studied and received a Bachelor of Science in Animal Science from the State University of New York at Cobleskill and now have a satisfying background in biology, education, and conservation. My degree allowed me to work within the zoological field for four years which led to the discovery of my fondness for helping young people unearth their love and drive for advocacy for the outdoors and its inhabitants. Being an internship coordinator for a small, nonprofit zoo in New York gave me a glimpse into this passion which is why working full-time for the people of ACE excites me. Our organization provides me with seemingly limitless opportunities to support young professionals and assist them through the door into the world of natural resources and on their way to finding their own calling. The feeling of seeing someone discover what makes their heart soar and their cheeks hurt from smiling is something indescribable. When off the clock, you will find me outdoors engaging in activities like hiking, kayaking, birdwatching, and fishing. And when the season turns chilly I’m often curled up in a cozy blanket painting landscapes of my adventures.\n\nGrowing up on the banks of the Indian River Lagoon in South Florida fostered in Sheana a passion for the outdoors and the space it holds for human connection.

Jennifer works with Rangers and Chamoru on Mariana Islands Wartime Experiences through Oral Histories, which is placed with War in the Pacific National Historical Park in Guam and American Memorial Park on Saipan. These World War II focused parks work to share the stories of the conflict in the Pacific as told by those who experienced it on these islands. These islands’ oral histories share sensory experiences of immersion in place, and when engaged in these stories Jennifer evokes heart-centered practices. These practices involve work with community-based archaeology to expand the stories in the webs of relations of past experiences to include the animals, the spirits, and the other-than-human beings with traditional scientific rigor. Jennifer’s background is in underwater cultural heritage of the Asia Pacific Region. Jennifer used archaeology/museology methodologies to organize data and note patterns (esp. spatial and particular locations), linguistic methodologies to study cultural concepts and a human worldview; and all in tandem with her specialization in Maritime Archaeology, which aims to understand and interpret the past relationships between humans and WATER.\n\nAmylee has spent her life exploring the deserts and mountains of Arizona and Montana.
