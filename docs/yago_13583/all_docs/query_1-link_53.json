There are currently eleven ILS branches throughout the state (see below for individual branch information); an additional branch is currently in the process of opening at the Washington State Penitentiary South Complex. ILS strives to provide a welcoming, neutral place where informational, educational, and recreational needs are met.\n\nIn addition to the library’s presence, individuals in these facilities have the benefit of a diverse array of educational, therapeutic, family, and cultural/religious services as well as enrichment programs, including sustainability projects and animal care programs. Programs and services such as these serve to contribute to recovery, personal growth, and constructive use of time for those that reside in these institutions, as do library programs and collections. ILS collections, which consist of a variety of books, audiobooks, magazines, film, and music, specially emphasize topics related to reentry, recovery, self-improvement, self-paced learning, digital literacy, consumer medical information, and small business information. Access to these materials supports a positive culture of learning and growth for both staff and patrons.\n\nDSHS Branches\n\nEastern State Hospital (ESH)\n\nEastern State Hospital for the Insane was established in 1891, and currently houses approximately 300 patients. It is nestled in the heart of Medical Lake, a quaint community with an abundance of wildlife and small-town charm located just west of Spokane. One of ILS's smallest branches, the library's collection of just under 10,000 items is located in the hospital's Active Treatment Mall, right across the hall from the patients' bowling alley.\n\nWestern State Hospital (WSH)\n\nThe state's first public psychiatric hospital, Western State Hospital is located in historic Lakewood, 30 miles southwest of Seattle. It began operations in 1871, and houses approximately 800 patients; ILS has served the library needs of its patients for more than 50 years. Today, the WSH library serves its patrons with a collection of over 13,000 items, with an emphasis on education and personal enrichment. Through the outreach delivery program, the library is able to reach every unit in the hospital, allowing patients unable to come to the library to access its services.\n\nDCYF Branch\n\nEcho Glen Children's Center (EGCC)\n\nEcho Glen Children’s Center, a medium/maximum facility, opened its doors in 1967 as the state’s first co-educational youth rehabilitation facility and is located on over 65 acres in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. EGCC provides a wide range of educational and treatment services to youthful offenders residing at the facility, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Aggression Replacement Training, and inpatient chemical dependency treatment. Youth at Echo Glen have the opportunity to attend classes through the Issaquah School District or Renton Technical College, as well as obtaining their GED. Echo Glen is also known for its Canine Connections program which allows youth to train future service animals and work with foster animals. The library at Echo Glen is the newest and smallest branch, serving youthful patrons to supplement their entertainment and educational needs.\n\nDOC Branches\n\nAirway Heights Corrections Center (AHCC)\n\nAirway Heights Corrections Center opened its doors in 1992 on a 160 acre parcel in Airway Heights, 10 miles west of Spokane. Today, the library provides services to AHCC's 1500 inmates with around 19,000 items in its collection; as one of the larger libraries in the system, the AHCC library stays busy with up to 50 patrons at any given time. When they're not in the library, inmates at AHCC benefit from a number of educational and vocational programs, including beekeeping and computer refurbishing.\n\nClallam Bay Corrections Center (CBCC)\n\nIn 1985, the Clallam Bay Corrections Center opened its doors to 900 inmates.

The library houses over 13,000 items and serve over 700 patrons.\n\nCoyote Ridge Corrections Center (CRCC)\n\nThe newest corrections center in the state is Coyote Ridge Corrections Center, which opened its doors in 2008 in the small railway town of Connell in southeastern Washington. The CRCC library is one of the largest in the system, serving over 2,000 inmates; it supports patrons studying computer programming, basic computer skills, HVAC systems, environmental sustainability and other fields via its collection of more than 16,000 items.\n\nStafford Creek Corrections Center (SCCC)\n\nStafford Creek Corrections Center opened its doors to almost 2,000 inmates in 2000. Located in Aberdeen, inmates of SCCC enjoy a variety of programs that allow them to contribute to the surrounding community, including a charitable bike repair program and the much-beloved dog training program. SCCC also has a unique Skill Builders program that helps individuals with intellectual, developmental, and neurological problems learn real-world skills; the library contributes to this initiative through literacy-building efforts and programs. One of ILS's largest branches, this library houses over 22,000 items.\n\nTwin Rivers Unit of the Monroe Correctional Complex (TRU)\n\nThe library at the Twin Rivers Unit of the Monroe Correctional Complex has been providing service to its patrons since 1984.

Located in Shelton on the Puget Sound, WCC provides a number of horticultural, agricultural, and sustainability programming opportunities for inmates; the garden program alone has supplied over 84,000 pounds of produce to food banks in Washington over the last 5 years. The library at WCC serves around 500 patrons who are long term residents in the Training Center and Intensive Management Unit, and has a collection of almost 14,000 items. Because WCC has the highest release rate of any DOC institution, the library focuses heavily on providing reentry materials and programming to its patrons.\n\nWashington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW)\n\nThe library opened its doors to the patrons of the Washington Corrections Center for Women in 1971; it currently serves approximately 900 inmates, and houses more than 19,000 items in its collection. The programs, treatment, health services, facility and staff training are all directed by gender responsive principles in order to make a safer and more supportive environment for WCCW inmates. The facility also has a nursery known as the Residential Parenting Program that allows participants who give birth while incarcerated to live with their children in a special unit where they can learn parenting skills and gain knowledge about child development. ILS supports early literacy and learning through a storytime called Baby Reads.\n\nWashington State Penitentiary (WSP)\n\nWashington State Penitentiary, the oldest corrections facility in the state, is located in Walla Walla, near the Washington-Oregon border. It has a rich history starting with its construction in 1886; although the facility has expanded over the years, some of the original structure - built with stone extracted from the Columbia River - remain in place today. ILS has served the library needs of WSP for over 50 years; in 2007 the West Complex branch opened to serve over 1,300 inmates with its collection consisting of approximately 15,000 items. In late 2020, a second ILS branch will begin to serve WSP's medium security inmates at its South Complex. See bibliography below for books about the Washington State Penitentiary.\n\nInterlibrary Loan Services for DOC Minimum Security Facilities\n\nDOC minimum security facilities do not have ILS libraries. To supplement in-house collections made up largely of donated books, inmates at those facilities can request to borrow any item that is owned by the ILS libraries through the program's Interlibrary Loan Service.\n\nBooks, Films, Magazines, and Reference Material\n\nPercipience – collections of poetry from the Institutional Library Services Poetry Months\n\nNon-Fiction - DSHS\n\nNon-Fiction - DOC\n\nMemoirs - DSHS\n\nMemoirs - DOC\n\nNovels - DSHS\n\nNovels - DOC\n\nYoung Adult Books - DSHS\n\nYoung Adult Books - DOC\n\nChildren's Books - DSHS\n\nChildren's Books - DOC\n\nDocumentary Films - DSHS\n\nDocumentary Films - DOC\n\nFeature Films - DSHS\n\nFeature Films - DOC\n\nWebsites - DSHS\n\nWebsites - DOC\n\nPrison Library Information\n\nNon-Fiction - DSHS\n\nThe Collected Schizophrenias Essays\n\nby Esmé Weijun Wang.
