The inclusion of production courses TFDP 170, TFDP 171, TFDP 172, TFDP 173, TFDP 174, and TFDP 175 gives the students the opportunity to put course work into the proper context and provides them with a practical understanding of the workings and problems of production. The minor in Theatre, Film, and Digital Production provides students with a basic understanding in major areas of study including performing arts literature, performance, and design. It also introduces the nonmajor to the discipline, providing breadth for those students majoring in unrelated disciplines.\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR (20 UNITS)"
