        "text": "Claire (Fonda) has traveled to Southern California to pay respects to her recently deceased college chum Molly (Dent), but also to murder Mollyâs husband, Howard (McDowell), because nearly half a century earlier, Howard raped Claire. Itâs a secret Claire has kept, and now that Molly has passed away, all bets are off for Howard. But Mollyâs funeral has also brought out Evelyn (Tomlin), another old classmate, and, it turns out, an ex-lover of Mollyâs before Howard stepped in. So, when Claire confides her plan to Evelyn, it doesnât take a whole lot of convincing for Evelyn to hop on board, accessory-wise.\n\nMoving Onâs tone is a hard one to pin down, since itâs constantly, uh, moving. It is predominantly a continued showcase for Fonda and Tomlin to gently trade barbs with each other and ruminate on the sadly specific lamentations of the twilight years. Itâs a subdued Grace and Frankie, although here Tomlin trades in the hippie tendencies and instead channels Fran Lebowitz, all deadpan and side-eye. Fondaâs Claire is of single purpose here, but she does have time to reignite an affair with her ex-husband Ralph (Roundtree), and here the film dips into its heartfelt mode.\n\nA boy who visits his grandfather at the assisted living home where Evelyn resides likes to play dress up with her clothes, and his parents are none too pleased. Mollyâs daughter Allie (Burns) confesses to Evelyn that she found love letters written by Evelyn to her mother, still kept after all these years, and hidden from Howard. Which is the other thread to this shambling film, the whole rape-revenge plot which is supposedly driving these characters."
