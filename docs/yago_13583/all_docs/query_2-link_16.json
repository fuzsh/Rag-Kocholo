        "text": "The movie version of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling novel, “It Ends With Us,” is already generating buzz ahead of its opening this Friday. And while much of the publicity has focused on star Blake Lively, who plays the lead character, in a fairly unusual situation, the movie’s costar, Justin Baldoni, is also the director.\n\nBaldoni may be best known for playing the role of Rafael Solano in the CW TV series, “Jane the Virgin,” but he has also been a producer and director. “It Ends With Us” represents Baldoni’s most high-profile project yet, as Hoover’s millions of fans have been eagerly awaiting this first movie adaptation of one of the author’s books.\n\nThe novel’s story was inspired, as Hoover has said, by personal experience, and memories of domestic abuse within her own family. As Hoover said during an interview on the “Today” show Wednesday, one of her earliest memories was of hiding with her sister, as she watched her father throw a television set at her mother.\n\nIn “It Ends With Us,” Blake Lively plays Lily Bloom, the owner of a flower shop, and Baldoni is Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni), a neurosurgeon. Their relationship begins as a romance, but soon becomes a darker tale of domestic abuse.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday on “CBS Mornings,” Baldoni, who was raised in the Medford area, talked about how he optioned Hoover’s novel back in 2019. In addition to his work as an actor, producer and director, Baldoni has also been outspoken about how men need to be more sensitive and vulnerable, subjects he addressed in a 2017 TED Talk, and has continued to discuss in other forums, including his podcast, “Man Enough.”\n\nOn “CBS Mornings,” Baldoni talked about trying to find the right way to approach the material in “It Ends With Us.”\n\n“As a man, I’m always going to come with my own biases, it’s one of the reasons I was afraid to direct this movie, let alone act in it,” Baldoni said. “And I wanted to make sure the film always had a female gaze, and I was never putting myself into it.”\n\nHe went on to note that it can be too easy to hear about someone who’s in a situation where their partner is abusive and ask the question, why did she stay?\n\n“And that’s the wrong question,” Baldoni said. “We need to be asking ourselves, why do men harm?”\n\nAsked what he wants men who see “It Ends With Us” to take away from the film, Baldoni said, “I want men to stop asking the question, why do women stay? I want men to take accountability. I want men to hold other men accountable.”\n\nStories by Kristi Turnquist\n\n‘Coraline’ 15th anniversary re-release lands in top 5 at the box office\n\n‘Last Week Tonight With John Oliver’ pokes fun at KGW morning newscast Olympics comment\n\n‘Tiger King’ director’s ‘Chimp Crazy’ is a shocking look at people who own chimpanzees\n\n‘America’s Got Talent’: Liv Warfield learns her fate in first quarterfinals results show\n\nBend-based poet and author Ellen Waterston is Oregon’s new Poet Laureate\n\n— Kristi Turnquist covers features and entertainment.
