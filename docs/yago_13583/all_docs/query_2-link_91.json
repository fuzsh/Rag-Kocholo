        "text": "A documentary about the famed 1982 Milwaukee Brewers from former CBS Entertainment President Kelly Kahl and Cannonball Productions will screen exclusively in Marcus Theatres in September.\n\nJust a Bit Outside: The Story of the 1982 Milwaukee Brewers will debut Sept. 13 in 12 Marcus Theatres throughout southeastern Wisconsin, including Sheboygan, Green Bay, Appleton, Oshkosh and Madison.\n\n“We are thrilled that we’re able to share this compelling, emotional and just plain amazing story with Brewers’ fans in Wisconsin, and especially grateful to our partners at Marcus Theatres for letting fans see the triumph and heartbreak of the magical ‘82 season play out on the big screen,” said Kahl.\n\nJust a Bit Outside takes fans through the highs and lows of the season, including the hiring of manager Harvey Kuehn Jr., mid-season after the team struggled, the Brewers battling the Orioles down to the final day of the season to win the American League East — the first division title in franchise history, and the incredible comeback from being down 2-0 to beat the California Angels in the American League Championship Series that set off a wild celebration at Milwaukee County Stadium.\n\nThe doc features in-depth interviews with many of the star players, including Robin Yount, Paul Molitor, Ted Simmons, Gorman Thomas, Rollie Fingers, Ben Oglivie, Jim Gantner, Cecil Cooper, and Pete Vuckovich, along with team owner Bud Selig and legendary announcer Bob Uecker.\n\nThe Brewers won the American League pennant but lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. After losing the World Series, they still returned to a heroes’ welcome in Milwaukee.\n\nWisconsin natives and longtime Brewers fans Kahl and Sean Hanish produced the documentary, along with Cannonball Productions principal Paul Jaconi-Biery.\n\n“Being able to meet my boyhood idols, and hear them open up about the highs and lows of that season, and their life-long connection with each other and to Brewer fans, is the culmination of a boyhood dream that I’m thrilled to share with sports lovers everywhere,” said Hanish, who directed the doc.\n\nHanish is repped by Jeffrey Thal at Ensemble Entertainment."
