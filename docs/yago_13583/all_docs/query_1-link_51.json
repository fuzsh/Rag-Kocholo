        "text": "Bright Eyes have released a new track “Rainbow Overpass,” from their forthcoming tenth studio album, Five Dice, All Threes, out on September 20th via Dead Oceans. The bright, punky anthem is propelled by acoustic guitar, horns, and fist-pumping gang vocals featuring Alex Orange Drink of The So So Glos, the accelerating tempo like a speeding car driving off the eponymous rainbow overpass.\n\nSTREAM “RAINBOW OVERPASS”\n\nOf the new track, Bright Eyes’ frontman Conor Oberst says, “Alex and I wrote a lot of the songs together, but ‘Rainbow Overpass’ is the only one he gets [to sing] a verse. He’s kinda like my hype man, getting a little Beastie Boys on the shit! They grew up on punk rock and the Beasties, so there are a lot of little bursts of other voices. I like that. It creates energy. Sometimes music can feel flat until you get into a live situation, when there’s adrenaline and raw energy. Instead of working in reverse, where that happens as we tour, I was trying to get some of that energy onto the record.”\n\nIn addition to the slew of European and US tour dates announced in July, the band has announced a massive North American tour for 2025 which will wind up the West Coast before canvasing the South and the East Coast before concluding in the Midwest.\n\nArtist Presale will take place on Wednesday, Aug 7 at 10AM local time with general on-sale on Friday, Aug 9 at 10AM local time.

Comprised of Conor Oberst, Mike Mogis, and Nate Walcott, the beloved band’s 10th studio album features guest performances from long time friends Cat Power, The National’s Matt Berninger and The So So Glos’ Alex Orange Drink. Alongside today’s album news comes the release of the first track, “Bells and Whistles,” and a slew of tour dates for the United States and Europe, including headline slots at Riot Fest and BFF Festival. All shows listed below.\n\n“Bells and Whistles” is a rollicking, anthemic bop that gallavants from NY to LA, its lacerating lyrics referencing Banksy, Princess Diana, the Mets, Silverlake stalwart bar Edendale, music biz pitfalls, and Kevin Costner’s greatest film. The lighthearted video, directed by Josh Boone, was filmed in Omaha, Nebraska and features a magical photobooth, a bar fight, and a performance.\n\nOf the track, Conor Oberst says, “This is a song about the many little details in life that can seem insignificant or frivolous or temporary at the time but eventually end up forming your destiny. And it's also kind of a whistle while you work scenario.”\n\nSelf-produced, and recorded at Mike and Conor’s studio, ARC, in Omaha, Nebraska, Five Dice, All Threes is a record of uncommon intensity and tenderness, communal exorcism and personal excavation. These are, of course, qualities that fans have come to expect from Bright Eyes, nearly three decades into their career. The tight-knit band of Conor, Mike and Nate tends to operate in distinct sweeping movements: each unique in its sound and story but unified by a sense of ambition and ever-growing emotional stakes. Even with this rich history behind them, these new songs exude a visceral thrill like nothing they have attempted before. Conor has always sung in a voice that conveys a sense of life-or-death gravity. At times throughout Five Dice, All Threes, you may feel worried for him; other times, he may seem like the only one with the clarity to get us out of this mess.\n\nBright Eyes on Tour: Thursday, September 19 - Brooklyn, NY - Brooklyn Steel\n\nSaturday, September 21 - Chicago, IL - Riot Fest\n\nSunday, September 22 - Omaha, NE - Steelhouse Omaha\n\nFriday, October 11- Oakland, CA - Fox Theater\n\nSaturday, October 12 - Los Angeles, CA - The Bellwether\n\nSunday, October 13 - Las Vegas, NV - Best Friends Forever Music Festival\n\nSunday, November 10 - Wolverhampton, UK - Wulfrun Hall\n\nMonday, November 11 - London, UK - O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire\n\nTuesday, November 12 - Nijmegen, Netherlands - Doornroosje\n\nWednesday, November 13 - Ghent, Belgium - Ha Concerts\n\nThursday, November 14 - Cologne, Germany - Carlswerk Victoria\n\nFriday, November 15 - Berlin, Germany - Tempodrom\n\nSaturday, November 16 - Weissenhauser Strand, Germany - Rolling Stone Beach\n\nMonday, November 18 - Stockholm, Sweden - Fållan\n\nTuesday, November 19 - Oslo, Norway - Parkteatret\n\nBright Eyes have announced the third wave of releases as part of their ongoing Companion project. The project, announced last March, sees the band rereleasing their entire catalog, each album accompanied by new recordings. Released June 16 via Dead Oceans: Cassadaga: A Companion, The People’s Key: A Companion, and Noise Floor (Rarities 1998-2005): A Companion. This new wave comes with artist contributions from Johanna and Klara Söderberg of First Aid Kit (“JeJune Stars,” “Coatcheck Dream Song,” “Wrecking Ball”), Gillian Welch (“Napolean’s Hat”) and Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff (“Clairaudients (Kill or Be Killed),” “Firewall,” ‘When You Were Mine”).\n\nThe announcement comes with the release of three new Companion series recordings: “Middleman” (Cassadaga), “When You Were Mine,” (The People’s Key), “Blue Angels Air Show” (Noise Floor).\n\nOf the project, Oberst says, “We are really excited about the final installment of our companion EPs. It’s been an interesting journey revisiting and reimagining all of these old songs. 54 songs total seems ridiculous now looking back, but I’m glad we did it. This new batch includes great contributions from Alynda Segarra (Hurray For The Riff Raff), Johanna and Klara Söderberg (First Aid Kit), and an amazing cast of other fantastic musicians that brought these songs into the present tense. I hope all of the fun and neo-nostalgia we experienced recording these comes through to the listeners.”\n\nListen to: “Middleman,”“When You Were Mine,” and “Blue Angels Air Show”\n\nBright Eyes re-issued all nine of their studio albums as a Companion series with additional recordings created together at their ARC Studios in Omaha. However, this wouldn’t be a Bright Eyes project if a moment devoted to appreciating the past weren’t turned into an opportunity to connect with the future. That’s where the nine companion EPs come in. Or as Oberst puts it, “the supplemental reading” for the primary reissues: One six-track EP per reissued album, each featuring five reworked songs from that album. “My thing was they had to sound different from the originals, we had to mess with them in a substantial way.” Plus one cover that felt “of the era” in which that particular albums was made – a song that meant something to the band at the time. To help the EPs come alive in the fullest way, Bright Eyes called in lots of old friends, like Bridgers, M. Ward, and Welch and Rawlings, and the Söderberg sisters as well as new ones like Segarra and Katie Crutchfield of Waxahatchee. The band also covers tracks from Elliot Smith, Simon Joyner, Lullaby for the Working Class, Azure Ray, Townes Van Zandt, The Faint, Prince and Gillian Welch.\n\nTheir spring tour kicks off in Milwaukee, May 10th, before stopping at more iconic venues; First Ave in Minneapolis, White Oak Music Hall in Houston as well as the brand new Salt Shed in Chicago. Maya Hawke, Cursive, Neva Dinova, Good Looks and Tim Kinsella & Jenny Pulse will support on select dates (full routing below).\n\nBright Eyes began in 1995 as a recording moniker for a then 15-year old Conor Oberst’s work with producer/multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis. Mogis and composer/ arranger/ multi-instrumentalist Nathaniel Walcott became fully fledged members in 2006. Over the course of 23 years the music’s impact and influence has been significant; Bright Eyes’ songs have been covered by dozens of artists, including Lorde, The Killers, Mac Miller, Dave Rawlings & Gillian Welch, Phoebe Bridgers, Snow Patrol, Jason Mraz and beabadoobee. For a band that’s often been perceived as an outlier, the depth, breadth, and impact of the Bright Eyes canon is remarkable. Over the last two-plus decades, as Bright Eyes has released one after another time capsule LP’s – urgent dispatches from transcendent, fleeting eras of our collective lives – they’ve also simultaneously been assembling a robust, mature, narratively cohesive discography.\n\nBeloved band Bright Eyes have announced the second wave of releases as part of their ongoing Companions project. The project, announced in March, sees the band rereleasing their entire catalog, each album accompanied by new recordings. Out November 11 via Dead Oceans: Lifted, or the Story is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground: A Companion, I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning: A Companion, and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn: A Companion.\n\nThe EPs include stellar guest performances from Gillian Welch, Dave Rawlings, Becky Stark,and Maria Taylor as well as stunning covers of “November by Azure Ray,” “Fare Thee Well, Miss Carousel” by Townes Van Zandt and “Agenda Suicide” by The Faint.\n\nToday’s announcement comes with the release of three new Companion series recordings: “You Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will,”(originally from Lifted), “Old Soul Song (for the New World Order),” (originally from Wide Awake) and “Gold Mine Gutted” (originally from Digital Ash). The band’s re-recording flips the styles of Wide Awake and Digital Ash - recording each of those tracks in the style of the other album which were released on the same day in 2005.\n\nListen to “You Will. You? Will. You? Will. You? Will.,” “Old Soul Song (for the New World Order),”and “Gold Mine Gutted” below.\n\nCoupled with this news comes a slew of new tour dates for fall. All dates below. Bright Eyes has partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 from every ticket sold goes to the PLUS1 x Noise For Now Reproductive Health Access fund supporting access to reproductive rights and services for all. Tickets on sale Friday, August 12th at 10am local time from www.thisisbrighteyes.com\n\nEarlier this year the band released their first wave of Companion EPs: A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997: A Companion, Letting Off The Happiness: A Companion and Fevers and Mirrors: A Companion to widespread acclaim. Like the previous series of releases, each reissue in this new wave will be partnered with the release of a Companion EP of five new recordings of songs contained on the original release plus a cover version from an artist they found particularly inspiring at the time of the original recording. The Companion series gives Conor Oberst, Mike Mogis and Nathaniel Walcott a chance to revisit some of their earlier material and re-work it entirely - with the occasional addition of some talented friends. This ambitious project will see the release of 54 new recordings over the coming year.\n\nBright Eyes began in 1995 as a recording moniker for a then 15-year old Conor Oberst’s work with producer/multi-instrumentalist Mike Mogis.

The revered band, who moved their entire recording catalog over to the Secretly Group label last year, have unveiled plans to re-issue all nine of their studio albums as a ‘Companion’ series with additional recordings created together at their ARC Studios in Omaha. The album reissue series will be partnered with the release of a Companion EP of five new recordings of songs contained on the original release plus a cover version from an artist they found particularly inspiring at the time of the original recording. The Companion series gives Conor Oberst, Mike Mogis and Nathaniel Walcott a chance to revisit some of their earlier material and re-work it entirely - with the occasional addition of some talented friends. This ambitious project will see the release of 54 new recordings over the coming year.\n\nFirst to receive the Companion treatment on May 27th are Bright Eyes’ first three albums - A Collection of Songs Written and Recorded 1995-1997, Letting Off The Happiness (initially released in 1998) and the now iconic 2000 LP Fevers and Mirrors.\n\nToday’s announcement comes with the release of three new Companion series recordings: \"Falling Out of Love At This Volume,\" \"Contrast And Compare\" (feat. Waxahatchee) and \"Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh\" (feat. Phoebe Bridgers).\n\nIn addition, Bright Eyes have added more dates to their 2022 touring schedule. All dates below.\n\nListen to:\n\n\"Falling Out Of Love At This Volume”\n\n“Contrast & Compare” (ft. Waxahatchee)\n\n“Haligh, Haligh, A Lie, Haligh” (ft. Phoebe Bridgers)\n\nWatch the Trailer For The Bright Eyes Companion Series\n\n“It’s a meaningful way to connect with the past that doesn’t feel totally nostalgic and self-indulgent,” says Conor Oberst of the ambitious series. “We are taking these songs and making them interesting to us all over again. I like that. I like a challenge. I like to be forced to do something that’s slightly hard, just to see if we can.”\n\nIt’s the desire to celebrate that sonic bounty that first got Oberst and the band excited about the idea of comprehensive reissues. But this wouldn’t be a Bright Eyes project if a moment devoted to appreciating the past weren’t turned into an opportunity to connect with the future. That’s where the nine companion EPs come in. Or as Oberst puts it, “the supplemental reading” for the primary reissues: One six-track EP per reissued album, each featuring five reworked songs from that album. “My thing was they had to sound different from the originals, we had to mess with them in a substantial way.” Plus one cover that felt “of the era” in which that particular album was made – a song that meant something to the band at the time. To help the EPs come alive in the fullest way, Bright Eyes called in some old friends; for the first batch of releases the featured guests are Waxahatchee, Phoebe Bridgers, M.

The album, considered a ‘reunion’ of sorts following a nine year hiatus for the trio, was released on Dead Oceans in August 2020 to international acclaim. Bright Eyes most recent release was a cover of Vic Chestnutt’s “Flirted With You All My Life” in February with special catalog reissues coming via Dead Oceans in 2022.\n\nDATE / CITY / VENUE\n\nWed Mar 23 – St. Paul, MN – Palace Theatre\n\nThu Mar 24 – Milwaukee, WI – The Riverside Theater\n\nFri Mar 25 – Madison, WI – The Sylvee\n\nSat Mar 26 – Chicago, IL – Chicago Theatre\n\nWed Mar 30 – St. Louis, MO – The Pageant\n\nThu Mar 31 – Louisville, KY – Paristown Hall\n\nFri Apr 1 – Nashville, TN – Ryman Auditorium\n\nSun Apr 3 – Columbus, OH – Express Live!\n\nTue Apr 5 – Pittsburgh, PA – Stage AE\n\nThu Apr 7 – Boston, MA – Roadrunner\n\nFri Apr 8 – Philadelphia, PA – The Met\n\nSat Apr 9 – Washington, DC – The Anthem\n\nSun Apr 10 - Norfolk, VA – The NorVa\n\nLast week, Bright Eyes were announced as additions to the bill for Planned Parenthood’s upcoming \"Village Of Love\" Virtual Fundraising Festival on October 25.

The track is available today exclusively via Bandcamp for $1 download and will be available on all streaming platforms from October 28th.\n\nSays Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst of the track, “This song should not exist in 2020 America. It is a protest song, I guess. Or maybe just a little story about what was, what still is in many parts of the world and what could be again here in this country if the GOP is successful in reshaping the Supreme Court and rolling back all of the hard fought progress made for reproductive rights in the last fifty years. Hopefully, if we all work together and vote, it will make this song sound as irrelevant and outdated as it should.\"\n\nThis recording features Bright Eyes members Conor Oberst, Mike Mogis, and Nathaniel Walcott, as well as Phoebe Bridgers, Jon Theodore, and Flea.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and the arts and entertainment community proudly partner to advance social justice — from civil rights and gender equality, to LGBTQ+ rights and reproductive freedom — and raise our voices when our health and rights are on the line.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is the nation’s leading provider and advocate of high-quality, affordable health care for women, men, and young people, as well as the nation’s largest provider of sex education. With more than 600 health centers across the country, Planned Parenthood organizations serve all patients with care and compassion, with respect and without judgment. Through health centers, programs in schools and communities, and online resources, Planned Parenthood is a trusted source of reliable health information that allows people to make informed health decisions.\n\nFor VOTER INFORMATION AND RESOURCES.\n\nBright Eyes' long-awaited tenth studio album and first record since 2011, Down in the Weeds Where the World Once Was, will be released via Dead Oceans on August 21st.\n\nToday's announcement comes alongside brand new single \"Mariana Trench,\" which rattles with anxiety, its epic sprawl exploding with a forward-chugging momentum of syncopated brass. Along with a mesmerizing, hand-painted animated video, \"Mariana Trench\" will premiere shortly at 9:30am Eastern.\n\nWatch the official premiere page here\n\nAs a title, as a thesis, Down In The Weeds, Where the World Once Was functions on a global, apocalyptic level of anxiety that looms throughout the record. But on a personal level, it speaks to rooting around in the dirt of one’s memories, trying to find the preciousness that’s overgrown and unrecognizable. For Conor Oberst, coming back to Bright Eyes was a bit of that. A symbol of simpler times, vaguely nostalgic. And even though it wasn’t actually possible to go back to the way things were, even though there wasn’t an easy happy ending, there was a new reality left to work with.\n\nDead Oceans is offering exclusive standard and deluxe bundles to pre-order on the Secretly Store, which include Down in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was 2xLP on limited transparent red & transparent orange vinyl, \"Persona Non Grata\" b/w \"Flirted With You All My Life\" 7” on limited transparent orange with opaque red splatter, and various other exclusive items.\n\nAll 2xLP variants feature a two-inch die cut hole through the entire package revealing the LPs from both sides. Side D contains an animated phenakistoscope etching by Drew Tetz and a four-panel lyric booklet.\n\nPRE-ORDER https://bright-eyes.ffm.to/ditwwtwow\n\nDown in the Weeds, Where the World Once Was track list:\n\nPageturner’s Rag\n\nDance And Sing\n\nJust Once In The World\n\nMariana Trench\n\nOne and Done\n\nPan and Broom\n\nStairwell Song\n\nPersona Non Grata\n\nTilt-A-Whirl\n\nHot Car in the Sun\n\nForced Convalescence\n\nTo Death’s Heart (In Three Parts)\n\nCalais To Dover\n\nComet Song\n\nHello friends, Strange days indeed. Just wanted to send our love and solidarity to everyone out there feeling alone, frightened and isolated. You are not alone. We are all in this together. We, like so many others, had many plans for 2020. We will be releasing a new album this year no matter what. We also have lots of touring plans which we are now reassessing. We will keep you informed as things progress. We very much want to get on the road and hope to see you all in person sooner rather than later. Until then, here is a song called Persona Non Grata. We hope you like it. It was hard to decide which song to share first because they are all quite different, but but one seemeed as good of a place as any to start. And it has bagpipes! Which is a first for us. We hope this finds you and your loved ones healthy and safe. Thinking of you fondly. Your pals, Conor, Mike, and Nate.\n\nListen to Persona Non Grata"
