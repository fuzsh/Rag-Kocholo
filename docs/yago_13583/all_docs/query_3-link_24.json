        "text": "Early work\n\nBundesmann’s family moved to New York City about 1917, and he entered the theatre as an actor after high school under the name Anton Mann. In the 1930s he became a director and production manager at the Theatre Guild, where he directed Christopher Morley’s Thunder on the Left, among other plays. From 1936 to 1938 he was a director for the WPA Federal Theatre Project, where he came to the attention of film producer David O. Selznick, who hired him to scout for talent and to direct screen tests for Gone with the Wind (1939) and Rebecca (1940).\n\nOnce in Hollywood, he began working as an assistant director at Paramount, most notably on Preston Sturges’s Sullivan’s Travels (1941). He was given the chance to direct his first feature, the low-budget mystery Dr. Broadway (1942). At Universal he made the musical Moonlight in Havana (1942), for which he changed his screen name to Anthony Mann, and then signed in 1943 with B-movie specialist Republic Studios. Of the four films he made for Republic Studios, the most notable was The Great Flamarion (1945), which starred Erich von Stroheim as the title character, a marksman who is seduced by his stage assistant into killing her husband.\n\nThe 1940s: film noirs\n\nThe Great Flamarion led Mann to a contract with RKO, where he made Two O’Clock Courage (1945), a mystery starring Tom Conway as an amnesiac who is aided by a taxi driver (Ann Rutherford) and discovers that he is a murder suspect. He returned to Republic Studios to make Strange Impersonation (1946), an eerie mystery that had a research scientist (Brenda Marshall) caught in a web of murder and blackmail. The Bamboo Blonde (1946) was a hybrid of a musical and a war movie about a bomber pilot who falls in love with a nightclub singer.\n\nDesperate (1947) was Mann’s first critical and commercial success and the first of his great noirs. He cowrote the original story about a truck driver (Steve Brodie) who runs afoul of a gangster (Raymond Burr) and his fur thieves and has to run for his life. Railroaded! (1947) was the first of four noirs that Mann directed for tiny Producers Releasing Corporation (later Eagle-Lion); there a tough cop (Hugh Beaumont) tries to save Sheila Ryan’s character from a lowlife hood (John Ireland). Railroaded! was Mann’s first film with screenwriter John C. Higgins, who wrote five of Mann’s noirs. T-Men (1947) was more ambitious, with Dennis O’Keefe and Alfred Ryder as treasury agents going undercover to nail a counterfeiting gang. With that movie, Mann began a six-film collaboration with cinematographer John Alton, whose use of deep shadows and stark lighting helped define the look of film noir.\n\nConsidered by many to be the greatest of Mann’s noirs, Raw Deal (1948) was about a convict (Dennis O’Keefe) breaking out of prison to avenge himself on his partner (Burr) who had framed him. Mann also directed much of He Walked by Night (1948), about the manhunt for a cop killer. The film was shot in a semidocumentary style and was ultimately credited to Alfred Weker. Often called a “historical” film noir, Reign of Terror (1949; also called The Black Book) was a thriller set during the French Revolution.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Side Street (1950) was a taut noir in which a mailman (Farley Granger) steals $30,000 from a pair of blackmailers, putting his life in jeopardy."
