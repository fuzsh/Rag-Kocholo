        "text": "Fractured Actors Theater Company proudly presents The Speakeasy Prom: Never Say Goodbye,our 5th annual festival of new plays and live music. This year’s edition features five world premiere one-acts by local playwrights. The Speakeasy Prom is an immersive theater and musical experience\n\nLaughter, music and a bloody good time are all on the menu at this year’s Speakeasy Prom. Eavesdrop on two best friends trying to outrun a violent past… as soon as they finish eating dessert. Meet your new substitute Drama teacher whose favorite subjects are anarchy and 80’s music. Women across four generations recount their prom nights as the youngest family member gets ready for her own. Grab a seat for a raucous dinner party filled with close friends airing their dirtiest laundry. Finally you will learn to love a gifted child pianist with a penchant for violent crime and the loving family that enables her.\n\nIt’s all accompanied by modern and classic rock from The Speakeasy band, under the musical direction of James Dorward and featuring Ventura County’s finest musicians. The Speakeasy Prom: Never Say Goodbye is hosted at Sweet Jay’s, our charming and spacious black box theater that will be transformed into a colorful and celebratory high school dance. Prom attire is encouraged.\n\nWritten by Gini Downing, Jeff Ham, Shannon McNally Ham, James James, and Emili Peach Miranda Directed by Erica Connell, Spencer Frederick, Jeff Ham, Shannon McNally Ham, and Benjamin Colby Wilson Musical Direction by James Dorward"
