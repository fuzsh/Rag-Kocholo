It is clear how much people miss going to the movies… Let alone movies where they will have ‘discovered’ new voices, authenticity in vision and films that you won’t be seeing next week at the multiplex. Team DANCES WITH FILMS created a unique and inviting atmosphere where connections were made among old friends as well as sparking lasting new relationships for projects yet to be envisioned. We are blessed to have had an amazing fest run this year and are thrilled to be looking to year 25 in 2022!”\n\nHere is a list of this year’s 2021 DWF:LA award winners…..\n\nGRAND JURY AWARD for Features\n\nDREAMOVER\n\nwritten & directed by Roman Olkhovka\n\nproduced by: Nikita Yefimov\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: MY FIONA & NEW YEAR\n\n______________________________________________\n\nGRAND JURY AWARD for Shorts\n\nENOUGH\n\nwritten by Caleb Slain & Nathan Nzanga\n\ndirected by Caleb Slain\n\nproduced by Max Losee, Ethan Seneker, Rick Stevenson, Hope Alexander, Jennette Vasiljevic, La’ Charles Trask, Caleb Slain\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS: LIMINAL & OVER MY DEAD BODY\n\n______________________________________________\n\nINDUSTRY CHOICE AWARD – over 40’\n\nVOODOO MACBETH\n\nwritten by Agazi Desta, Jennifer Frazin, Morgan Milender, Molly Miller, Amri Rigby,\n\nJoel David Santner, Erica Sutherlin, Chris Tarricone\n\ndirected by Dagmawi Abebe, Victor Alonso-Berbel, Roy Arwas, Hannah Bang, Christopher Beaton,\n\nAgazi Desta, Tiffany Kontoyiannis Guillen, Zoe Salnave, Ernesto Sandoval, Sabina Vajraca\n\nproduced by Jason Phillips, Miles Alva, Xiaoyuan Xiao\n\n______________________________________________\n\nINDUSTRY CHOICE AWARD – under 40’\n\nPANT HOOT\n\ndirected & produced by Richard Reens\n\nexecutive producers: Barbara Hollweg, Lewis Hollweg\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – COMPETITION FEATURES\n\nBENEATH THE BANYAN TREE\n\nwritten & directed by Nani Li Yang\n\nproduced by Nani Li Yang, Troy Chiu, Yue Wang\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – COMPETITION SHORTS\n\nOH, BABY!\n\nwritten by Brooke Trantor, Kate Morgan Chadwick\n\ndirected by Brooke Trantor\n\nexecutive produced by Kate Morgan Chadwick, Roxanna Dunlop, Arden Grier, Marlo McGriff, Nick Pukstas, & Joey Oliva\n\nproduced by Brooke Trantor, Danielle Argyros, Courtney Stewart, Clayton Apgar, David & Michele Chadwick, Annie & Chobe Oliva, Tim Wright\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – FUSION FEATURES\n\nDELICATE STATE\n\nwritten, directed & produced by Paula Rhodes\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – FUSION SHORTS\n\nSNAKE DICK\n\nwritten & directed by David Mahmoudieh\n\nproduced by George Lako, Annalea Fiachi, Josh Bachove\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – DOCUMENTARY FEATURES\n\nHOLY FRIT\n\nwritten by Justin Monroe & Ryan Fritzsche\n\ndirected by Justin Monroe\n\nproduced by Justin Monroe, Chris Saito, Kasey Monroe\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – DOCUMENTARY SHORTS\n\nSKID ROW, LOS ANGELES\n\nwritten & directed by Van Maximilian Carlson\n\nproduced by Van Maximilian Carlson, Kirk Palayan\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – PILOTS TV\n\nMIDDLE OF NOWHERE\n\nwritten & directed by Michele Palermo\n\nexecutive produced by Paul Prissel & Michele Palermo\n\nproduced by Larry Gilbert & Lolly Howe associate producer Susie Kim\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – PILOTS WEB\n\nSPANKY\n\nwritten & directed by Alex Martinez\n\nproduced by Spencer Valenzuela, Kirk Leins, Sundee Manusakis, Tanmay Mistry, Alex Martinez\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – DOWNBEAT\n\nDESOLVIDO\n\nwritten & directed by Andrés Roa Ariza\n\nproduced by Colin Rogero & Andrés Roa Ariza\n\n______________________________________________\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD – DANCES WITH KIDZ PRO\n\nFROM UNDER THE BRIDGE: WHEN BULLIES BECOME TROLLS\n\nwritten & directed by Paul James Houghton\n\nproduced by Connie Jo Sechrist & Lucas Ferrara\n\nThis year’s in-person festival ran from August 26 – September 12 at the TCL Chinese Theaters, located at: Hollywood & Highland, 6925 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028.\n\nRecently selected by USA Today as one of the top 10 film festivals in North America, the dedicated team behind DWF:LA are constantly looking for the best in emerging talent with unique visions and storytelling.

With Jane and Effie, and all on our Advisory Board, this next expansion of DWF will raise the profile of our filmmakers, providing access to the next generation of creatives for future collaborations.”\n\nCo-founder Michael Trent agrees, “With our next developments including the newest, DWF: UNLEASHED!, which will feature films with name talent, we know that the time is right as more and more alumni with larger budgets return ‘home’ to DWF each year. This growing expansion does not mean a divergence from our core mission. Our competition programming will remain steadfastly focused on emerging and unknown talent. ‘UNLEASHED!’ will enhance what’s already there, providing a stage in Los Angeles for filmmakers who have stars in their films.”\n\nVIEW ENTIRE RELEASE\n\n2019 DANCES WITH FILMS ANNOUNCES AWARD WINNERS AT CLOSING CEREMONY\n\nAnd the winners are….\n\nICA | INDUSTRY CHOICE AWARD OVER 40 MIN:\n\nLAST SUNRISE\n\nWritten By Wen Ren, Elly Li, Yankang Mei and Min Yu\n\nDirected by Wen Ren\n\nProduced by Xinran Li, Mingqian Li, Yang Lu and Elly Li\n\nICA | INDUSTRY CHOICE AWARD UNDER 40 MIN:\n\nWANDA\n\nWritten & Directed by Benjamin Nicolas\n\nProduced by Inna Pan, Philippe Lalande and Benjamin Nicolas\n\nPROGRAMMER’S CHOICE\n\nBLOWING UP RIGHT NOW\n\nWritten by Chris Lee Hill\n\nDirected by Tom Morris\n\nProduced by Jaz Kalkat, Aaron Webman, Tyler MacIntyre, Tom Morris and Chris Lee Hill\n\nExecutive Produced by Jonathan Lonsdale, Johnny Kuebelka, Natalie Oman, Neal Barta and John Giordano\n\nAssociate Produced by Rashaana Shah, Travis Hodgkins\n\nDANCES WITH KIDZ By Pros AUDIENCE AWARD\n\nTHE BOY, THE DOG AND THE CLOWN\n\nWritten & Produced by Ron Peer, Nick Lyon\n\nDirected by Nick Lyon\n\nOVERALL AUDIENCE AWARD | FEST SHORT:\n\nSUICIDE DATE\n\nWritten & Directed By Doug Hurley\n\nProduced By Mike C.

Their popular DANCES WITH KIDZ! program presents films BY kids and FOR kids.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (May 25, 2017) – Now in its 20th year, DANCES WITH FILMS (DWF) announces its lineup for DANCES WITH PILOTS, a division that features the hottest new television and web pilots, and DANCES WITH KIDZ!, which screens films by and for kids, staking its claim as the unstoppable fest for truly independent content makers. As previously announced, DWF will run June 1-11, 2017 in Los Angeles, CA at the TCL Chinese Theaters, located at: Hollywood & Highland, 6801 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028. Tickets and passes are available for sale at http://www.tclchinesetheatres.com/ or thru the festival’s own site: https://danceswithfilms.com.\n\nRecognizing that some of the hottest content these days is in the web and television space, DANCES WITH FILMS is offering an exciting lineup of eight web and ten television pilots in its DANCES WITH PILOTS division. With episodes ranging from the hilarious (see: Cubicle Zombies) to the absurd (Doucheaholics), to the sexy (Sexpectations), to the suspenseful (Doomsday), this is some of the most creative and wild programming you’ll see on the DWF lineup.\n\nAlthough the family film market is one of the most profitable in the industry, there are relatively few opportunities for independent projects in this genre to screen. DWF addresses this inadequacy by providing a platform for the next generation of media visionaries. The festival’s popular and unique DANCES WITH KIDZ! program is back for its fourth year of family-friendly films, with 28 of the 34 short films in the lineup created by kids under the age of 18. Films this year explore themes as diverse as friendship, growing up in the 90’s, and space exploration. DANCES WITH KIDZ! will rock the Chinese Theaters on the second weekend of DWF.\n\nA three-time alumna of the DANCES WITH KIDZ! division, Tara-Nicole Azarian had this to say about the experience, “I began with the inaugural year of DANCES WITH KIDZ! and I played three years, total. Each year, I was treated as a filmmaker. As an equal. As an artist with ideas worthy of sharing. I’ve played many, many festivals and all have something unique to offer, but DANCES WITH FILMS is an opportunity for growth. DWF gives you the air so you can fly higher than you thought possible. The resources, the support, the professionalism is priceless. I watched. I listened. I took advantage of everything offered to me…and this year, at age 18, I am not playing in DANCES WITH KIDZ…this year, I am playing in DANCES WITH FILMS.”\n\nThe previously announced film lineup features more than 160 titles, chosen from a record 2,100 submissions from all over the globe. The juried narrative competition section includes 16 features, 13 of which are world premieres, and nearly three-dozen shorts. DWF also has a category for groundbreaking short and feature documentaries, provocative genre fare in the Midnight section, and the most exciting music videos and dance-themed films from the indie scene in the Downbeats section.

Their popular DANCES WITH KIDZ! program presents films BY kids and FOR kids.\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA (May 25, 2017) – Now in its 20th year, DANCES WITH FILMS (DWF) announces its lineup for DANCES WITH PILOTS, a division that features the hottest new television and web pilots, and DANCES WITH KIDZ!, which screens films by and for kids, staking its claim as the unstoppable fest for truly independent content makers. As previously announced, DWF will run June 1-11, 2017 in Los Angeles, CA at the TCL Chinese Theaters, located at: Hollywood & Highland, 6801 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028. Tickets and passes are available for sale at http://www.tclchinesetheatres.com/ or thru the festival’s own site: https://danceswithfilms.com.\n\nRecognizing that some of the hottest content these days is in the web and television space, DANCES WITH FILMS is offering an exciting lineup of eight web and ten television pilots in its DANCES WITH PILOTS division. With episodes ranging from the hilarious (see: Cubicle Zombies) to the absurd (Doucheaholics), to the sexy (Sexpectations), to the suspenseful (Doomsday), this is some of the most creative and wild programming you’ll see on the DWF lineup.\n\nAlthough the family film market is one of the most profitable in the industry, there are relatively few opportunities for independent projects in this genre to screen. DWF addresses this inadequacy by providing a platform for the next generation of media visionaries. The festival’s popular and unique DANCES WITH KIDZ! program is back for its fourth year of family-friendly films, with 28 of the 34 short films in the lineup created by kids under the age of 18. Films this year explore themes as diverse as friendship, growing up in the 90’s, and space exploration. DANCES WITH KIDZ! will rock the Chinese Theaters on the second weekend of DWF.\n\nA three-time alumna of the DANCES WITH KIDZ! division, Tara-Nicole Azarian had this to say about the experience, “I began with the inaugural year of DANCES WITH KIDZ! and I played three years, total. Each year, I was treated as a filmmaker. As an equal. As an artist with ideas worthy of sharing. I’ve played many, many festivals and all have something unique to offer, but DANCES WITH FILMS is an opportunity for growth. DWF gives you the air so you can fly higher than you thought possible. The resources, the support, the professionalism is priceless. I watched. I listened. I took advantage of everything offered to me…and this year, at age 18, I am not playing in DANCES WITH KIDZ…this year, I am playing in DANCES WITH FILMS.”\n\nThe previously announced film lineup features more than 160 titles, chosen from a record 2,100 submissions from all over the globe. The juried narrative competition section includes 16 features, 13 of which are world premieres, and nearly three-dozen shorts. DWF also has a category for groundbreaking short and feature documentaries, provocative genre fare in the Midnight section, and the most exciting music videos and dance-themed films from the indie scene in the Downbeats section. The Fusion section brings together a multitude of additional features and shorts.\n\nNotable Dances With Films alumni who first gained notice at the festival include: Gina Rodriguez, Bryan Cranston, Will Scheffer, Mark V.
