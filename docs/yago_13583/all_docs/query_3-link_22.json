        "text": "Carson McCullers was born Lula Carson Smith in Columbus, Georgia, on Feb. 19, 1917. Most famous for her novels \"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\" \"Reflections in a Golden Eye,\" \"The Member of the Wedding,\" \"The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,\" and \"Clock Without Hands.\" McCullers was also a playwright and a short story writer.\n\nHer small but significant body of work includes five novels, two plays, 20 short stories, more than two dozen nonfiction pieces, a book of children's verse, a number of poems, and an unfinished autobiography.\n\nMcCullers' life was blighted by a series of cerebral strokes caused by a misdiagnosed and untreated childhood case of rheumatic fever. The first stroke occurred when she was only 24 years old, and within several years, she was completely paralyzed on her left side. McCullers suffered a final stroke in August 1967 and died at age 50 on Sept. 29, 1967.\n\nCelebrity Connections\n\nActress Marilyn Monroe came to lunch at Carson's house in Nyack, along with her husband Arthur Miller and novelist Isak Dinesen\n\nKnown as one of the most significant American writers of the 20th century, Carson McCullers was a novelist, a short-story writer, playwright, essayist and poet who grew up in Columbus, Georgia.\n\nWhen Oprah Winfrey selected Carson's book The Heart is a Lonely Hunter for her book club in 2004, the 76-year-old book became a No. 1 bestseller that May.\n\nTruman Capote, trailblazing writer from the South, author of Breakfast at Tiffany's and In Cold Blood, was a close friend of McCullers.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tennessee Williams first connected with Carson by sending her a fan letter after reading The Member of the Wedding.\n\nKaren Allen, costar in Raiders of the Lost Ark, debuted her short film adaptation of McCullers's short story \"A Tree. A Rock. A Cloud.\" at Carson's 100th Birthday Celebration.\n\nInteractive Map of Columbus\n\nView Interactive Map\n\nIn 1944 when Carson's father died, her mother left Columbus and moved to Nyack, New York, where she bought this house. Carson lived with her mother and sister off and on in this house for years. Carson eventually bought the house from her mother and is where she died in 1967. In December 2006, the McCullers house in Nyack was added to the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nCarson's physician and long time friend, Dr. Mary E. Mercer, bequeathed the home in Nyack to Columbus State University's Carson McCullers Center. After Mercer's passing in late April 2013, the Center inherited not only the house but also many Carson-related artifacts and documents that shed light on the last 10 years of Carson's life.\n\nDue to the generosity of Mercer, CSU is one of the only universities to own two homes by a single author and now houses the world's most extensive research collection on Carson. An endowment in Mercer's name also has been created to continue these efforts in the curation and preservation of Carson's legacy.\n\nNote from the Director\n\n\"I came across this story when I was in my early 20's. As a young actor I was drawn to Carson McCullers as a playwright and novelist at first, and then began to read everything she’d written that I could get my hands on. \"A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud\" always loomed large for me among her many short stories, It is a quiet, subtle, mysterious story. It sneaks up on you and has stayed indelibly etched in my imagination all these years. It is a delicate, Zen like passing of wisdom from a older man to a young boy on a rainy day in a roadside café when their two lives unexpectedly intersect. The story, as I see it, is flooded with the raw, tangible beauty of the natural world, set in contrast to the complex, intangible yearning for love in their interior worlds. I intend to stay very close to the story Carson McCullers wrote and to illuminate the characters she has so beautifully drawn in the pages of this story.\"\n\nKaren Allen\n\nDirector and Screenwriter\n\nKaren Allen (Director & Screenwriter)\n\nKnown for her work as an award-winning actor in more than 40 feature films (\"Animal House,\" \"A Small Circle of Friends,\" \"The Wanderers,\" \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" \"Starman,\" \"Scrooged,\" \"The Glass Menagerie,\" \"Malcolm X,\" \"The Perfect Storm,\" \"The Sandlot,\" \"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,\" \"White Irish Drinkers,\" \"Bad Hurt,\" and the soon to release \"Year By the Sea\").

To honor the contribution of these writers' residences to McCullers's work, the Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians awards fellowships for writers to study in her childhood home in Columbus, Georgia. The fellowships are intended to afford the writers in residence uninterrupted time to focus on their work, free from the distractions of daily life and other professional responsibilities.\n\nDescription and details\n\nThe Marguerite and Lamar Fellowship for Writers is offered during fall semester. The fellowship begins the first of September and ends the first of December. During this time, the writing fellow will reside in a spacious private apartment inside Carson McCullers's childhood home, the Smith-McCullers House. The fellow is provided with a stipend of $5,000 to cover costs of transportation, food and other incidentals. Fellowship recipients are encouraged to take an active role in the community and to meet informally with students and local residents interested in writing. The fellow will work with the McCullers Center director to plan a presentation near the end of the residency.\n\nThe Smith-McCullers House is located on a quiet residential street in Columbus' historic area. The fellow will occupy one-half of the Smith-McCullers House. The remainder of the house serves as the Smith-McCullers house museum. Because the house operates as a museum and outreach center, events and tours frequently occur in the upper part of the home during the fellow's time here. However, the apartment is comprised of a large living/writing/sleeping space, a private bathroom, and a private entrance, allowing fellows to work without interruption or disturbance by the Center and Museum. The kitchen is shared by the fellow and the Center. The Center uses the kitchen for special events throughout the fall, in which the fellow is always invited to participate.\n\nThe apartment is adequately furnished. Fellows need bring only their personal belongings. The Carson McCullers Center provides utilities, general property maintenance, a computer and online service. Fellows are encouraged to bring a laptop. Since public transportation is limited, an automobile is recommended; however, there are grocery stores, post offices, and other services within walking distance. A spouse or companion is welcome, but children and pets are not allowed.\n\n2024 Fellow: Howard Fishman\n\nHoward Fishman is the author of To Anyone Who Ever Asks: The Life, Music, and Mystery of Connie Converse (Dutton). He is a frequent contributor to The New Yorker, where he has published essays on music, film, theater, literature, travel, and culture, and his work has also appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, The Telegraph, Vanity Fair, The Washington Post, Artforum, San Francisco Chronicle, Mojo, and The Boston Globe.
