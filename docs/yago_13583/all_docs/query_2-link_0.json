When a woman named Lily Bishop is accused of cheating at poker in a saloon, farmer Michael Fabian invites her to join the wagon train over Trumbo's strenuous objections. Trumbo also accuses her of cheating at cards after losing to Lily, an insult that she promises not to forget.\n\nLily leaves with Booth Pennock, a ruffian who injures Trumbo with a whip before departing. Lily ends up in Pharaoh City running a saloon. The town is controlled by Pharaoh Coffin, a former slave trader who opposes law and order and California statehood. After Trumbo becomes involved in a saloon brawl, Lily orders him to never return to the saloon, but Trumbo wins the place in a poker game.\n\nLily mistakenly takes Pharaoh to be an honest man and moves into his hacienda. Coffin's men assault Trumbo, who is rescued on the trail by Mexicans and vows revenge. When his wounds heal, Trumbo returns and becomes a spokesman for statehood advocacy. Coffin's hired men kill Fabian for similar beliefs, causing Lily to finally see Coffin for the crazed villain he is. Trumbo forms a posse and corners Coffin, who is descending into madness, and Lily shoots him. Trumbo, in love with Lily, promises to return to the army to atone for his desertion, hoping to someday return to her.\n\nBarbara Stanwyck as Lily Bishop\n\nRay Milland as Jonathan Trumbo\n\nBarry Fitzgerald as Michael Fabian\n\nGeorge Coulouris as Pharaoh Coffin\n\nAlbert Dekker as Pike\n\nAnthony Quinn as Hernandez\n\nFrank Faylen as Whitey\n\nGavin Muir as Booth Pennock\n\nJames Burke as Pokey\n\nEduardo Ciannelli as Padre\n\nRoman Bohnen as Col.
