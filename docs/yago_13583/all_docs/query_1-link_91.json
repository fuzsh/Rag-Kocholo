I started working at the LAVC Writing Center in 2006 and never left! I also coordinate The Puente Program, a transfer support program for disproportionally impacted students.\n\nI received my B.A. in English from UCLA in 2009 and my M.A. in English from CSUN in 2014. I have an interest in British Romanticism, Children's Lit, Science Fiction/Fantasy, and Animal Studies.\n\nWhen it comes to writing, I believe that it's all about the process, not the product. Revision is where the magic happens!\n\nBland, Jay\n\nPhone: (818) 947-2586\n\nEmail: @email\n\nJames Bland received his PhD in English and American Literature from Harvard University. His areas of concentration were Pre-Modern Literature, African American Literature, and Critical Theory. He has extensive experience teaching a diverse range of developmental, advanced, and honors composition, rhetoric, and literature classes at the community college and university levels. He's also interested in Comic Studies, Video Games as Literature, and Creative Writing. His creative work has been published in the Kenyon Review, Ploughshares, Callaloo, and Agni among other journals and anthologies. He has also been awarded a Breadloaf Writer’s Fellowship and two MacDowell colony residencies.\n\nFornataro, Gayle\n\nPhone: (818) 947-2445\n\nEmail: @email\n\nBio Unavailable\n\nHunter, Patrick\n\nPhone: (818) 947-2800\n\nEmail: @email\n\nI lived my childhood, boyhood, and adolescence in the northeast side of the San Fernando Valley, close to the corner of Woodman and Devonshire. The liquor store, where I as a teen-ager used to place bottles of beer and wine on the shelves, still exists. After graduating from James Monroe High School, I volunteered to join the U.S. Navy, and, yes, I am a Viet Nam Era Veteran. After honorably discharged from active duty, I then was able to afford college, and I graduated with an A.A. from LAVC, and with a B.A. and M.A. as well as an ESL Certificate from CSUN. Today, I still live in the northeast part of the Valley, but in Panorama City. I have always felt most comfortable with working class areas and working class people.\n\nWhenever those who adore upscale housing regions (which often strike me as quite anemic) ask me how I can reside in such a scrappy neighborhood, I usually inform them that I don’t actually live in the whole neighborhood: just in one house. In fact, I have lived in the same house and been married to the same woman for over thirty years.\n\nMy passions are reading classic literature and viewing classic motion pictures. I am a couch potato, but I consider myself as a couch potato with taste. Spending ones evenings reading and conversing with ones mate might seem quaint for serving as leisure activities, but, as I am a sexagenarian, I prefer twentieth-century habits over those like video-gaming, friending, and tweeting. My teaching philosophy is rather complex, but I ground it with this idea: the most important lesson anyone can learn is that he/she/they counts as a free and equal member of a free and equal society. Despite the evidence to the contrary, I really do believe that.\n\nJeffries, Alison\n\nPhone: (818) 947-2586\n\nEmail: @email\n\nAlison T.

I received my BAs in English and in History, also from CSUN in 2007. I enjoy reading, writing, movies, Shakespeare in the Park, concerts, traveling, and spending time with my family and friends. In both of my degrees I focused on the role of women, both in literature and historically.\n\nMy central work throughout my MA career was focused on how students deal with the concept of identity in the composition classroom. Although my degree is in Rhetoric and Composition, I’ve always been a big fan of Shakespeare, specifically his tragedies such as Othello.I believe that the classroom works best when it is an open place where students can feel comfortable to speak/participate, engage and discuss the material presented to them. Pedagogically speaking Jonathan Alexander, author of Literacy, Sexuality and Pedagogy, was pivotal in my graduate career in guiding me, through his textbooks that I was assigned, in how I wanted to be as a teacher. He focuses on the concept of identity and how students write about themselves and issues that are important to themselves and their futures. I think that what happens inside the classroom has the potential to enlighten how students view their work in the classroom, but also how they engage with the world around them. I try to pick essay topics and assignments that are relevant to today’s day and age. I strive to create an environment where every student feels welcomed and is encouraged to participate.\n\nGlover, Star\n\nEmail: @email\n\nI earned an A.A. in English and another in history at College of the Canyons in 2011; then, I transferred to CSUN to earn my B.A. in English Single Subject Instruction in 2013 and my M.A. in English Rhetorical Composition in 2015. I currently teach at both LAVC and CSUN.\n\nMy various hobbies include comics, handcrafts, 3D printing, and vegan baking, although my real passion has always been communicating with and learning from other people. Since an increasing amount of our communication now takes place online, I hope to use my knowledge of rhetoric and composition to help others make themselves heard. As a first generation college graduate and community college alum, I place a great deal of importance on mentorship, so please come to me with any questions!\n\nHall, Debi\n\nEmail: @email\n\nDebi Hall has been a Professor at LAVC since 2010.

She finished high school at William Howard Taft and then continued on to Pierce Community College, CSUN for her BA in fine art, National University for a CLAD Single Subject Teaching Credential and an MA in English, and The University Of Wisconsin for a graduate certificate in Instructional Design. She is passionate about learning and has been in education since she begun college.\n\nShe has been teaching for LAVC for ten years now! She has always loved explaining things - she even used to set up her dolls as if they were in a classroom, so she could pretend to be a teacher, when she was only seven years old. Besides teaching, she loves to draw, read, go hiking, and at times enjoy a glass of wine and an evening with friends.\n\nTracey’s teaching philosophy is that all students are individual and everyone learns in their own unique way, and she sets up her curriculum to support that idea. She used multiple teaching methods to make sure that all of her students learn the content. She used visuals, videos, podcasts, articles… anything it takes to help get the message across. She believes that the ARCS adult learning theory is best used with college students because she can make the information relevant and even humorous at times, provides positive feedback, and she likes to give assignments that include group work and also she allows her students to understand that they will use the information learned in everyday situations throughout the rest of their lives.\n\nPayte, Trista\n\nEmail: @email\n\nBio Unavailable\n\nPetkovic, Sophia\n\nEmail: @email\n\nBio Unavailable\n\nPincolini, Rebecca\n\nEmail: pincolr@lavc.edu\n\nWhile still in grad school, I began working within Valley's very own Writing Center.

During that time, I have taught a wide variety of courses in basic skills, writing, critical thinking, and literature – but how did I get so lucky to be here in the first place? Well, a LONG time ago, I started off at UCSD studying theater and dance. That led to gaining a big ego at the time, so I auditioned and transferred to UCLA to get a toehold in the world of performing arts. Alas, I was fickle, changed my mind, and then went on to earn a B.A. in English. I have never looked back.\n\nAfterward, I graduated and began working in various writing endeavors: advertising, public relations, magazine editing, and corporate writing. While in the corporate world, I taught a business writing class, and the teaching bug grabbed me. I then enrolled in graduate school and stayed there for a long, long time, earning three teaching credentials and two M.A.’s, all while working as a teacher in public schools. Right before my second daughter was born, I was able to secure a spot at LAVC. That was in 1998. I am thrilled to be here and look forward to many more fun and productive years at “my second home.”"
