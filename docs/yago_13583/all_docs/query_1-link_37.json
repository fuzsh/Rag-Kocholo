        "text": "September 13, 2012 (Poway) -- Poway Center for the Performing Arts (POW!) Foundation is proud to announce the addition of Academy Award, Tony Award and Golden Globe nominee John C. Reilly to the cast for O Berkley Where Hart Thou?, to be staged at 8pm Saturday, September 22 at the Poway Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nReilly is best known for His offbeat character work in films like Step Brothers, Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, Magnolia, and Boogie Nights. For his role in the hit movie musical Chicago, Reilly was nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. He received a Tony nomination for his work in True West on Broadway with Philip Seymour Hoffman. Musical performance is nothing new to Reilly. He performed “Mr. Cellophane” on the soundtrack to Chicago, and wrote and performed music for the soundtrack to Walk Hard, for which he received a Grammy nomination. Reilly has recorded with Jack White. In addition to local hero Tom Brosseau, Reilly has performed with Willie Nelson, Band of Horses and Jamey Johnson.\n\nOf Reilly’s musical career, the San Francisco Bay Guardian writes, “Despite all the jests and subtle winks, the man can sing. And with his John C. Reilly and Friends group, including Tom Brosseau and Becky Stark (a.k.a. Lavender Diamond), he harmonizes on lovely old-timey country folk. As a true-blue artist, Reilly recently released a few singles — produced by entrepreneurial troubadour Jack White — including a plucky duet with Brosseau (a cover of the Delmore Brothers \"Gonna Lay Down My Old Guitar\") and a satisfying match-up with Stark on \"I'll Be There If You Ever Want.\" So sweet and twangy, it goes down like cool spiked lemonade on a sticky summer afternoon.”\n\nReilly accepted an invitation to join the cast of O Berkley Where Hart Thou? from O Berkley founder Jeff Berkley.\n\n“Music is obviously a huge part of JCR's life as an artist,” says Hart. “His movies all include some kind of music. Some have tunes he wrote himself. He's a great comedian and actor for sure, but more important to us, he's the real deal as a songwriter and performer! JCR is just part of the stunningly talented and successful Southern California songwriting community which will be on display at O Berkley, Where Hart Thou?!”\n\nO Berkley Where Hart Thou? features a variety of San Diego-based musicians re-creating the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to O Brother Where Art Thou? The September 22nd line-up includes Jeff Berkley and Calman Hart (aka Berkley Hart), Steve Poltz, Gregory Page, 7th Day Buskers featuring Shawn Rohlf, Dennis Caplinger, Robin Henkel, Lisa Sanders, Jeffrey Joe Morin, Robin Adler, Cathryn Beeks & Matt Silva, Tom Brosseau plus The Lovebirds\n\nTICKETS: www.powayarts.org\n\n$29/$10 Youth ticket (18 years and under with the purchase of an adult ticket)\n\nSenior and Group discounts available\n\nPoway Center for the Performing Arts is located at 15498 Espola Road, Poway, CA 92064.\n\nTicket office hours: Friday Noon to 5pm; Saturday 10am to 3pm and two hours before curtain."
