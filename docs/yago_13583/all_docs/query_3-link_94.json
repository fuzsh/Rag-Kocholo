        "text": "Steve stares at the finished product and hates it. But somehow, he knows that Hydra will like it. It has no personality, the only thing it really says is ‘we’re giant douche bags.’ Yeah, they will definitely love it. His office door creeps open, and Sam pokes his head in. “Did you see it?”\n\nSteve puts his hand to his forehead and tries to massage away the tension. “Yeah. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I can’t believe my company did this.” Sam looks like he wants to defend what they’ve done, but sees Steve put his hand up. “Don’t misunderstand, they will think it’s the best thing they’ve ever seen.” He goes to the drink cart and pulls out a water. “Just promise me that we never have to do this again.” The only reason Steve agreed to work with Hydra is because the guy in charge now isn’t as bad as past CEO’s, but it still goes against everything his artist heart believes in. He did promise to try to turn the company’s image around too, so Steve has to accept that sometimes what the client wants isn’t going to have an artistic soul.\n\nPlus, it will mean bonuses for all of Steve’s employees.\n\nSam smiles. “You’re the boss you know, you could have said no.”\n\nSteve really wants to take the bottle of water and splash it on his face or pour it over Sam’s, but he won’t do either. “I had to do what was right for my company and that was taking this account.”\n\nSam slaps him on the shoulder, pulling Steve in for a hug. They cling to each other for an extra minute or two. “I know it went against every artistic bone in your body, which is all of them, but it’s going to mean everyone gets a Christmas bonus this year. Including you.” Steve really is going to argue that point. “No, you don’t.” Sam points a finger at Steve. “You started this company and every year you give out bonus checks like Santa Claus and this year you’re giving yourself one.” Steve again wants to interrupt. “AH! No, you don’t give yourself a bonus, you don’t give me a bonus.”\n\nSam walks out and Steve spends the next couple of hours setting up for the meeting with Hydra tomorrow. It grates on his nerves and SHIELD would have been fine without the account, but it does mean that his company is going to be afloat for the next three years, not that it wouldn’t have been anyway, but this way, everyone gets their bonus and a raise. Everyone here has been with Steve since the start or a little after. He’s added others along the way and everyone that joins the company stays. It really is a family and Steve prides himself on that. He chalks it up to Sam knowing when a person fits and when they don’t.\n\nSHIELD Advertising is all Steve. He was an art major in college, but in his senior year was convinced by Sam to enter an advertising contest with a grand prize of $2000. Steve had balked at the idea, but Sam had talked about using the money to take all their friends on a trip during spring break and well, Steve liked the idea of giving his friends something good. So, he entered and won the damn thing. Now, thirteen years later, he’s running one of the most successful small advertising agencies in New York. He calls it small anyway. Oh, he’d been approached by many larger firms, trying to buy him and his staff and each time, he refused. Steve knew the consequences of refusing to sell his company.\n\nThe larger firms tried to blackball him in the industry, then two things happened within months of each other that caused Steve to have to start turning clients away. First, because of the attack on Steve’s reputation and because Tony is an arrogant douche bag with a heart of gold, he’d hired Steve’s company for a new project. Advertising firms all over the tri-state area had been courting Stark for that account, but he chose Steve. Tony told him later that it was because they’d tried to bully Steve into selling and Steve standing his ground. Steve stood up for what was right for his people and Tony respected that.\n\nThe second thing that happened, just months later, was that Margaret Carter, THE Peggy Carter had hired Steve’s firm on the advice of Tony for an international human rights campaign. She has been the fiercest advocate, the head of her own global law firm. She’d seen the preliminaries on Stark's project and fell in love with the artistic style and creative energy. The morning she showed up at Steve’s office, he’d been unable to talk for several minutes. She’d hired him on the spot and Steve’s company became a household name overnight.\n\nIt all made him smile now because besides Sam, Peggy had become a closest friend. Tony and Sam secretly speculated on the relationship between Peggy and Steve. They thought it was hilarious considering her wife is a stage actress in London and Steve is as gay as the day is long. He’s not sure how Sam missed that memo in college, so when he found out Steve was gay, he started re-examining everything they’d ever talked about, making Steve laugh for a good 10 minutes.\n\nAfter setting up for the meeting with Hydra, Steve goes to Dave’s. He calls ahead and asks for his regular table. Chloe, the hostess, tells him he doesn’t have to call, that Dave always holds a table for Steve. He explains that calling is the right thing to do, sending Chloe into a fit of giggles and her calling him a boy scout. When he arrives at the restaurant, he sees several new faces on the wait staff.\n\n“You have some new people.” When Dave found out Steve was coming in, which Chloe gave him a heads up on, he meets the man at the door.\n\n“Yeah, new semester at NYU, means new wait staff for me.” He guides Steve to the table in the back and hands him a menu. “It’s a pain in the ass to train new people, but this group isn’t bad. One of these days you’ll have to tell me how you keep your people loyal.” Dave winks at Steve as he walks away and Steve chuckles, opening the menu and checking for new items. Dave does a rotating menu, and Steve always looks to see when his favorites are back on the menu.\n\nSomeone sits a glass on the table and fills it with water. Steve absently says, “Thanks. What’s the special tonight?”\n\nThe voice that answers him is honey rough and sexy as hell. “Tonight, Aaron has a chicken piccata in a lemon garlic glaze, with roasted potatoes and asparagus.”\n\nSteve’s head raises and he locks eyes with the single most attractive man he’s ever seen. He’s tall, just shorter than Steve probably, with wavy chocolate brown hair pulled into a neat bun, blue/grey eyes that could pierce the soul and high sharp cheekbones that Steve very much wants to get up close and personal with. He’s goddam beautiful and Steve’s artist eye wants to paint him, preferably in the nude.\n\nFor more than a few seconds, Steve just stares at him, then clears his throat. “Uh…hi…I’m Steve.” Wanting to beat his head into the table because this isn’t a bar where he’s gone to pick up a quick fuck, he’s in an upscale Manhattan restaurant acting like a high schooler.\n\n“Hi Steve, I’m James and I’ll be your server tonight.” James pulls out his pad. “Can I start you with something more than water?”\n\n“Uh…yeah, whiskey, neat.” James nods and steps away from the table. Dave comes over, already smirking at his friend. “He’s new.” Steve’s eyes keep following the young man.\n\nDave laughs, amused. “Yeah, he’s one of the new ones. Graduate student at NYU in biometric engineering. One of the smartest kids I’ve ever met.” Dave looks at the bar where James is waiting for Steve’s drink. “See something you like, Steve?”\n\n“Jesus Dave, warn a guy when he’s going to be waited on by walking perfection.” Dave leaves the table again laughing, thoroughly entertained.\n\nBucky stumbles into work nearly tripping over his own feet. He’s late by 15 minutes and is trying to come up with a good excuse to sway his boss into not firing him in his second week. Class ran over and as the TA Bucky had to stay and answer all the inane questions that first years ask on syllabus day.\n\nMr. Rossi stops talking to the staff about the night's specials when he sees Bucky trying to sneak in. He raises an eyebrow, but keeps talking. “If anyone asks why we aren’t using veal, tell them because your boss isn’t a heartless monster. They want veal, they can go somewhere else.” The group chuckles and disperses. “Mr. Barnes, let’s talk for a minute.”\n\nBucky hangs his head, knowing he can’t afford to lose this job, but suspecting that it’s coming. “Mr. Rossi, I’m so sorry, I just couldn’t get out of class fast enough today. Please, it won’t happen again.”\n\nDave watches him intently, like he’s sizing him up or looking into his soul. Bucky’s not sure who this guy is, but he’d swear he’s a government spy of some kind. “Relax kid, I’m just going to give you a run-down of the nights special, so you have that information.”\n\n“Wait, you aren’t firing me?” Bucky is stunned.\n\n“You just came from the basic engineering class that you TA, right?” Bucky nods. “And this was day one, right?” Bucky nods. “And those sweet little undergrads were all confused and wouldn’t stop asking questions, right?” Bucky grins and nods again. “Not your fault then. Now, let’s get you up to speed.”\n\nMinutes later, Bucky’s in the change room getting into his uniform. Black pants, white button up, black tie and white apron. He looks damn good, if he does say so himself, and he does. The door bangs open and Clint comes into the locker room. “How bad did he ream you?”\n\nBucky sighs. “He didn’t, just wanted to go over the specials.”\n\n“How do you do that man? I mean, most bosses would fire you on the spot.” Clint comes over to straighten Bucky’s tie and brush his shirt down.\n\n“Well, he didn’t fire you and you broke 7 wine glasses in one night. It’s why he pulled you from the floor and put you in the kitchen.” Bucky checks his reflection, knowing that good looks means good tips.\n\n“I think he’s got a soft spot for me.” They head out of the locker room and into the kitchen.\n\n“I think he’s trying to slowly dock your pay to replace his expensive stem wear.” They laugh as Clint heads to the prep area and Bucky heads into the dining room to check his section.\n\nIt’s nearly 8 when Mr. Rossi comes to Bucky and asks him to take an extra table. He explains that it’s a table held for a personal friend and if Bucky plays his cards right, he can get a sizeable tip. Bucky grins and thanks his boss repeatedly. What he isn’t expecting is for the most beautiful man in the world to be sitting at the table a few minutes later, but there he is. At over 6 feet, shoulders that could easily support a Greyhound bus, dark blond hair and lips that Bucky really wants to see wrapped around a popsicle or a dick, Bucky’s dick to be precise. After pouring the water and giving the nightly special, the guy looks up and Bucky is so screwed because no one should have blue eyes that clear. Yeah, Bucky is screwed and prays to the restaurant gods that he doesn’t do something embarrassing tonight.\n\nBucky stands at the bar waiting for Steve’s drink and Chloe comes over to get a glass of water. “See something you like?” She looks over to Steve’s table where the two men are chatting. “He is a piece of work, isn’t he?” Bucky tries to be disinterested and shrug, but Chloe giggles. “That’s Steve Rogers, head of SHIELD Advertising. Comes in about once a week and never shows interest in anyone.”\n\n“Why are you telling me this, Chloe?” Bucky hasn’t looked back at the table in several minutes and then Gio places the whiskey on Bucky’s tray.\n\n“I’m telling you this because he’s barely taken his eyes off you, since you walked away from the table.” She pats his shoulder as she walks away. “Good luck.”\n\nBack at the table, Bucky helps Steve decided on something a little heavier than the special. He makes jokes about making the kitchen staff work a little harder tonight. When Steve looks at him funny, he explains that his friend is at the prep station, the wine glasses incident and making him work off the cost. Steve ends up laughing, head thrown back, gorgeous neck on display. Bucky is intrigued by this man.\n\nHe takes care of his other tables, but if Steve even looks like he might need something, Bucky’s there in seconds. At the end of the night, Steve pays and leaves, giving Bucky a wink. When he picks up the check holder and opens it to add to the till, he comes close to dropping it. The check was close to $110 for Steve’s meal and he left a $50 tip. What the fuck? How well off is this guy?\n\nAt home, later that night, Bucky does a search on Steve Rogers and holy hell, well off doesn’t even begin to describe this guy. Anybody with any integrity uses Steve’s firm for their advertising, if they just want their name out there, they use someone else. He’s the agency used by Stark Industries and The International Human Rights Coalition run by Margaret Carter. He’s THE advertising agency. He spends more time than he should reading about Steve and his company. Going on 2AM, Bucky shuts down the computer and goes to sleep dreaming of blue eyes and strong shoulders.\n\nThe following morning Bucky drags himself out of bed, without opening his eyes, he makes his way to the kitchen. Cracking an eye open, he finds Clint leaning over the coffee carafe with a straw. “God damnit Clint, stop doing that.”\n\nClint drops the straw and side eyes Bucky. “Need more sleep.” Then starts chasing the straw around the lip of the carafe with his tongue.\n\n“You need professional help.” Grabbing a cup from the shelf, Bucky takes the carafe and pours himself some coffee, placing it back under Clint’s face. “What classes do you have today?”\n\n“Don’t know, something in the math building.” Finally, he catches the straw and goes back to drinking the coffee.\n\n“How do you not know what classes you have? How have you survived this long?” Bucky plops down into a chair, breathing in the aroma of coffee.\n\n“I’ve had you. That’s the only reason I’m not dead yet.” Bucky quirks an eyebrow and nods. Shuffling off to the bathroom, he tells Clint he’ll see him at work.\n\nSam watches Steve through the whole meeting and knows that something is up. He’s focused and pleasant, but there’s an edge to his behavior. He thinks it’s just how much he hates this particular account, but it seems to be more than that.\n\nSteve gets through the meeting with Hydra and just like he thought, they loved the ideas and mock ups. Sam smiles through the whole thing, but as soon as they leave, it falls away. “Man, I’m not sure how much longer I could play excited about this shit.” Steve kind of hums at him, but Sam can tell his mind is somewhere else. He starts throwing odd things out just to see if Steve is listening. “I think we should do something similar for Tony. He’d love this.”\n\nSteve stacks the folders on his desk, which Sam has noticed he’s done three times now. “Uh, yeah, that sounds good.”\n\n“I think we should drop the Carter account, she’d too pushy for my taste.” Sam’s arms are crossed over his chest now and he’s smirking.\n\n“If you think so.” Sam watches the folders get stacked again.\n\n“I hired a stripper for the office. It will boost morale.” Now he’s holding in a laugh because if that doesn’t get Steve’s attention, he’s calling an ambulance.\n\n“Good…” His head shoots up. “Wait! What?”\n\n“And there he is.” Sam goes over to Steve and leads him to the sofa on the far wall. Pushing his friend down, he sits with him, taking Steve’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “Now I know it wasn’t that presentation that did this, so what’s up?”\n\nSteve pulls away, covers his face with his hands and tries to think of a way to talk about this. He went home last night and all he could think about was James. He went to sleep thinking about him and dreamed about him. He’s goddamn perfect and Steve can’t stop wishing. “It’s nothing.” No one should react this fast to someone they just met. It’s just not how real life is. And Steve’s been kicked a few times while he’s been down, so he’s a realist.\n\nSam’s hand lands on his shoulder and squeezes, then slides down, rubbing over Steve’s back. “How long have we been friends?”\n\nSteve pulls his hands away from his face and lets them rest across his knees. “Since high school.”\n\n“And in that time, have I ever given you a reason to think you can’t tell me anything?” He squeezes Steve’s shoulder again. Thinking of all the times that Steve could have told him he’s gay, but didn’t. It hurts to a certain degree, but Sam has come to realize that Steve didn’t do it because he didn’t trust Sam, he just never found anyone interesting enough to date, so there wasn’t a reason to say it out loud.\n\n“No.”\n\n“So?” Steve doesn’t move. “Come on man. I’m getting worried about you.”\n\nSteve pushes up and paces the office. Stopping every now and then and just trying to breathe. He finally stops and puts his hands on his hips, bracing for impact. He knows that Sam will just think it’s funny and probably laugh and give him a hard time. He goes for it anyway. Maybe a good laugh is what he needs. “I met someone last night.”\n\nNothing happens and Steve looks up to see Sam’s eyes wide. “Okay.” Sam chuckles, but doesn’t laugh. “That’s a good thing, right?”\n\nSteve stutters out the next words. “He’s…there’s…he’s a lot younger than me.”\n\nThat’s when Sam laughs. Then abruptly stops. “Wait, how much younger?” He’s a little worried that this might be a legal issue and if Steve slept with someone too young, it could be very bad.\n\n“He’s no older than 25.” Steve blushes a furious shade of red.\n\nSam loses it and laughs until he cries. “Jesus, man, I thought you meant like 16 or something.”\n\nSteve blanches and smacks Sam in the back of the head. “What kind of sick fuck do you think I am?”\n\nThey talk more and Sam gets the whole story from Steve. He still chuckles every now and then because it’s so typical Steve. He’s always so worried about everyone else that instead of seeing that this could be a good thing, he sees himself as a creeper.\n\n“Listen my friend, we are going back to that restaurant tonight because I need to see if this is worth all of your stress.” Sam stands, shaking his head.\n\n“Sam, I don’t know…”\n\n“Oh no, we are doing this. I’ll meet you downstairs at 7.” With that he walks out of Steve’s office. For a few minutes Steve stresses, a little more, but then it occurs to him that he’ll get to see James again. He calls Dave’s and lets Chloe know.\n\nChloe goes straight to Mr. Rossi’s office to let him know that Steve is returning at 7:30. Dave just smiles and thanks her. Checking the schedule, he sees that James is indeed working tonight. His smile gets bigger.\n\nBucky arrives 15 minutes early to make up for the time from yesterday. He gets changed and is ready when Mr. Rossi gathers everyone for the nightly special. Dave gives him a nod and goes on with his speech. At 7:20 he pulls James aside. “James, I’m going to need your help again tonight. We have another special table coming in and I want you to take it.”\n\nBucky nods. “Of course, sir.”\n\nBucky is not prepared for Steve. Especially Steve with a friend, a male friend, that seems really chummy, a little too chummy. But whether he’s prepared or not, there Steve is in all his perfection. Bucky fills the two water glasses. “Good evening, gentlemen, can I get you something from the bar?”\n\nSteve looks up into that face and blushes ridiculously. Sam just grins like the cat that ate the canary, with his hand on the back of Steve’s chair. “I’ll have a beer and get this fool a whiskey.” Even though the man seems to be insulting Steve, his look is one of affection.\n\nBucky looks at Steve, who hasn’t taken his eyes off him and asks, “Neat?”\n\nSteve just nods, feeling overwhelmed that during the night he hadn’t over exaggerated how beautiful James is, he really is that breathtaking. James leaves the table and heads to the bar. “Damn, I’m straight as they come Steven, but that is an insanely fine piece of ass.”\n\nSteve reaches over and smacks Sam in the head. “Don’t talk about him like that.”\n\nSam grins, rivaling the Cheshire cat. “Well, well, well, you are seriously into this guy.”\n\n“I was in here for two hours last night because I didn’t want to go home.” He says it without thinking about how it sounds.\n\nSam scoots his chair closer to Steve, knowing that the man never takes anything for himself unless forced. “Steve, I’ve known you since our sophomore year of high school and you’ve never talked about someone like that. Man, you have to do something about this.” Sam leans into Steve’s space, laying his hand on Steve’s arm in what appears from the outside as a very intimate gesture.\n\nThat’s what Bucky sees as he comes back to the table. It twists in Bucky’s belly, and he doesn’t know why that is. He doesn’t know the man, but for some reason, now knowing that Steve’s off limits, that he has someone in his life, makes Bucky sad. The tray he’s carrying wobbles, but he steadies it in time and takes a deep breath. Bucky’s never developed a crush on a customer before because the relationship is a business transaction. But it appears that Bucky liked the idea of Steve’s attention the night before.\n\nHe doesn’t know Steve, not really, so he’s just going to give the best service he can, earn a good tip and buy Clint pizza this weekend. He plasters a smile on his face, the same smile he gives every other customer and places the glasses on the table. “Have you gentlemen decided?” They haven’t touched the menus, so Bucky acts the good waiter. “Tell you what, I’ll give you a few more minutes.” Without another thought, he heads over to his other tables. He glances over numerous times and Steve’s companion touches him again and again. So that’s it, Steve’s seeing someone. It makes last night’s flirting even more inappropriate, on both parts. It tilts Bucky off center because Steve flirted, like actively flirted, and then left a huge tip. Like he was trying to buy Bucky. That gets under his skin and makes him want to ask Steve what the fuck he was doing, but he won’t. The rich play by different rules, but Bucky doesn’t have to be part of that game.\n\nBucky is attentive and gracious, but doesn’t spend near the time at the table with Steve as he did the night before. He will glance over to check their water or to see if they need assistance, but other than that, he has a job to do and he’s going to do it well for all his tables.\n\nHe picks up the check holder as the two men leave the restaurant and inside is a note from the other guy, Sam, according to the conversation he picked up while waiting on the table. Steve would like to talk to you about a personal matter. Call him ###-###-####.\n\nFirst, Bucky’s confused, then he’s angry. He steps away from the table and heads to the door. Chloe gives him a strange look because Bucky never walks away from his job. Steve and Sam are stopped on the sidewalk having a quiet conversation. Steve looks upset and Sam has one hand on his arm and one on his neck. “I thought he would be interested, but I guess I was wrong.”\n\nBucky stops next to them. “You were wrong.” He shoves the paper back at Sam. “I don’t need to be pulled into whatever this little game is you two are playing.” He goes back into the restaurant and back to his tables. Dave watched the whole thing from the bar, shaking his head. He knows what’s going on, but it isn’t his life, and people have to learn their own lessons. When Chloe looks over for instructions, Dave shakes his head, so she goes back to her job.\n\nHow could they think that Bucky would be interested in being part of their relationship games? Does he give off the vibe of someone that wants to be shared? He reexamines the previous night and sure he was flirty, that’s part of the job under certain circumstances. But if you have someone at home, someone you are romantically involved with, you just don’t do this kind of thing. Just like every other jerk he’s dated; he doesn’t need this in his life. He’s going to focus on school and this job. And he’s not going to think about Steve again.\n\nSteve gets home that night and sits in the dark, thinking about what happened. Downing another whiskey, he looks out at the skyline. He loves this city, everything about it, but he’s lonely. He has great friends, but besides a few one-night stands, he’s never had anyone that shared his life. He tried once, but he was so focused on getting the company up and running that it lasted all of four weeks before the guy had enough and left while Steve was at work, no note, no call, just disappeared.\n\nHis emotional state and the view inspire him, so he goes into his studio and for the first time in years, starts to paint. It’s just a mesh of colors until just before dawn he realizes that he’s painted James. He didn’t mean to and, to a certain degree, didn’t know he was doing it, but there he is with his messy bun and grey/blue eyes. Determination rears its head, he showers, grabs his jacket and heads out. Whatever the hell happened last night is not going to stop him because anything, anyone, that can make him paint again is someone that he needs to see.\n\nSam sits in his office the next morning playing and replaying dinner the night before. He has no idea what happened, but he’s sure he can figure it out. According to Steve, there was intense flirting the night before, so either James used that as a way to get good tips or he was really interested, but that came to an abrupt stop the following night. But the altercation on the street was weird. None of it is adding up.\n\nHe picks up the phone and calls Natalia. “I hope you know what time it is and if this isn’t important that I will kill you later.”\n\n“Good morning to you too, sunshine.” Sam grins\n\n“Fuck you, Wilson.” He hears moving around and looks at his clock. Shit, he really did wake her up. “What the hell do you want at this ungodly hour?”\n\nIt’s 6:30 and the office doesn’t open until 9, so this really is a bad time. “Jesus, I’m sorry, I didn’t realize what time it actually was. It can wait.” He starts to hang up.\n\n“WAIT! You wouldn’t have called if it wasn’t important. What’s going on?” She settles herself against the headboard.\n\n“It’s Steve.” She gasps and he can hear her jumping out of bed. “No, just wait.” She settles back down. “I’m just going to have to take the beating from you later because you aren’t going to think this is important enough for the early call.”\n\n“Let me be the judge of that. Talk.” Sam spends the next twenty minutes or so laying out the last two nights. He includes at much detail as he can.\n\n“How much did you touch him at dinner?”\n\nSam is stunned by the question. “Well, I don’t…” Then it clicks. “Fuck!” He’s up moving, hand pressed to his forehead. “This is my fault.”\n\n“Yeah, it is. The guy thinks that you two are together and propositioned him into a threesome.” She’s up getting coffee now, Sam can hear the clink of cups. “Way to go, Wilson. The first guy he’s been interested in in years and the guy thinks you two are sleaze bags.”\n\nBucky didn’t sleep, but he made it to class on time. Clint had tried to get him to talk the night before and Bucky had tried, but it was all so jumbled in his head. He’d showered, just to get the grimy feeling off. Was that what the tips had been about? Then he’d gotten angry again and showered a second time. That time Clint sat outside the bathroom yelling through the door. When Bucky had come out the second time, Clint really did seem worried.\n\n“Just tell me what I can do to make you feel better.” Bucky ignored his words and slouched onto the couch.\n\n“Grab my wallet, will ya?” Finally having Bucky talking, Clint jumped up and got the item. Bucky opened it and took out the $140 of tips. Specifically, the two tips that Steve had left. Bucky handed it over to Clint.\n\n“What do you want me to do with this?”\n\n“I want you to do whatever you feel like doing with it. I don’t want it.” Bucky leaned his head back on the sofa.\n\n“Is this your tip money?” Clint’s counting it out.\n\n“Not all of it.” Bucky sighed and thought himself an idiot.\n\nClint turned on the sofa so that his knee was against Bucky’s thigh. “I’m going to need you to explain what the fuck is going on.”\n\nBucky spent the next few minutes trying to explain everything, but it was hard to describe the first night waiting on Steve. How he’d been so nice and interested. How he’d seemed like the nicest guy. How he’d made Bucky think he was really interested. Then it all came crashing down when Steve and his boyfriend, Sam, had propositioned Bucky.\n\nWhat was surprising is that Clint didn’t lose it, he sat calmly and thought of the ways that he could make Steve pay. “We’re talking about Steve Rogers, right, THE Steve Rogers of SHIELD?”\n\n“Yeah, I guess that should have been my first clue that he was just way out of my league.” Bucky threw a pillow across the room.\n\n“Out of your league?” Clint rose, going to get the pillow, turning, he looked like an assassin. “OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!” Bucky flinched. “The guys a dirt bag and someone should kick his ass! You’re so much better than that!”\n\nThat’s all Clint said and when he went into his room, he slammed the door behind him. Bucky spent the rest of the night staring at the TV, which wasn’t on because it was too much trouble.\n\nSteve spends the morning trying to get the morning crew at Dave’s to give him any information about James, but they aren’t allowed to give out private information. Dave isn’t in, so there’s no way to get it from anyone else. Sitting behind his desk with his head in his hands, Steve tries to focus on work, but he can’t keep his mind on business. At the very least, he wants to find out what happened. What exactly James was accusing him and Sam of doing.\n\nHis office door swings open, Sam and Nat come in, Sam looks pensive, and Nat is smirking. “Whatever it is, can someone else handle it?”\n\nNat snorts. “Nope, this is all on you. Oh, and this dipshit.” She thumbs at Sam.\n\nBeing exhausted from a night of not sleeping, Steve really can’t deal with whatever this is. “What did I do? I haven’t been here long enough to have screwed anything up yet.” Sam looks at Steve like someone has kicked his puppy.\n\nBefore anyone can talk, there’s screaming from the outer office. Wanda is telling someone that without an appointment they aren’t allowed in and the other voice, an angry growl of a thing informs her that his beef isn’t with her. Steve’s office door slams open. The young man standing just inside the door, with heaving breath, looks deranged.\n\nClint looks at the three people in the room and knows from Bucky’s description which one is Steve. Barging over, he punches Steve square in the nose. “You fucking son of a bitch!” He turns on the other two and sees Sam, it has to be Sam. “And you! What kind of self-absorbed douche bags pull something like that?” No one seems to know what’s going on, no one but Nat.\n\nShe’s still smirking. “Let me guess, a friend of James?” The guy just nods and turns on Steve again. Nat chuckles when Steve looks at her for help. “You brought this on yourself.”\n\nClint sneers, then growls out, “Damn right you did!” He makes a move at Steve again, but this time Steve’s ready and avoids the punch.\n\n“Just a fucking minute! Who the hell are you?” Steve’s holding his nose and Sam, who’s just decided this is his life now, goes to get a towel and some ice.\n\n“Names Clint Barton and you and your boyfriend,” he indicates Sam. “Came into Dave’s last night and propositioned my best friend. Don’t pretend you don’t know.”\n\nAt that, Nat laughs her ass off. “Oh, this is better than coffee.” She goes to sit on the sofa.\n\n“Prop…boyfr…what the ever-loving fuck is happening?” Steve sits on the edge of his desk, unable to hold himself up. Clint looks like he’s going to keep punching, Sam looks like he’s guilty as sin and Natalia is still laughing. Then, because Steve is a smart guy, it all falls into place. “Oh God!”\n\nEveryone in the room sees the minute that Steve puts two and two together. Clint doesn’t know what to think of this because this guy really doesn’t seem to know what’s going on. “Wait, wait, wait…you didn’t mean to proposition him?”\n\n“I didn’t proposition him at all!” Steve’s indignant and Sam hands him the ice. “Thanks Sam.”\n\n“Are you two, or are you not, together?” And that makes Nat laugh all over again.\n\nShe gets up and comes over to the young man. “Let me see if I can straighten all this out.” Sam goes to get coffee, Steve stays seated on the desk and Clint and Nat sit in the chairs. “Steve came into the restaurant a couple of nights ago and for lack of a better way to describe it, fell for your friend James.” Steve starts to object, but Nat holds up her hand. “He told his best friend about it, who is straight with a wife, I might add, and they came in again last night. Your friend James saw them do what they always do, which is touch too much for polite company and thought what we’ve all thought at one time or another, that they are a couple.” Steve looks aghast. “Oh, stop it Rogers, you two are freaky with the touching thing.” She looks back at Clint, who is starting to sink into the chair. “He came home last night upset.” Clint nods slowly.\n\n“Upset doesn’t even cover it. He took two showers; they made him feel so dirty.” That gets Nat’s sympathy, and she lays her hand on Clint’s arm.\n\n“I’m sorry for that.” She looks at Steve. “You’re an asshole.”\n\n“But I didn’t do anything!” Sam comes back in with the coffee. “Sam, why does everyone think we’re a couple?”\n\n“Maria thought we were a couple when she first met us. Thank god, I got that straighten out or I wouldn’t have a wife right now.”\n\nClint snorts. “You people need a referee.” He looks at Nat. “Is this what success does to people?”\n\nNat pats his hand. “No, this is what stupid does to people.”\n\nClint grins. “I like you.”\n\nSteve stands. “Look, I need to explain this to James and make him understand that I would never do that.”\n\n“If I help you, you better make it good.” Nat hasn’t taken her eyes off Clint and is running her fingernail up and down the back of his hand. “And he prefers to be called Bucky, but Mr. Rossi thought James sounded more professional.”\n\nAccounts that Steve needs to look over are passed off to Sam, Steve goes home to change, and Clint takes Steve to all of Bucky’s favorite places for food and gifts. “Listen man, I’m sorry about this morning.” Clint’s really upset that he hit Steve now that he knows what was really happening.\n\nSteve stops in the middle of the sidewalk. “Why are you apologizing? All you did was stand up for a friend. That’s admirable.” Clint smiles and they head on their way.\n\nBucky comes out of class at 5:15 to a message from Mr. Rossi that he’s not needed on staff tonight. He almost calls in to make sure he still has a job, but figures if he was fired, Mr. Rossi would have said so. He heads to the library before going home. Close to 7:30 he heads out, trying to call Clint and getting no answer, he assumes that he’s working the prep table again. A night off doesn’t seem like a bad idea considering how he’s been feeling. His plan is to go home, put on his favorite pajama pants and work on his graduate project, and probably eat too much ice cream.\n\nAll that goes out the window when he opens the door to his and Clint’s apartment to find his roommate waiting impatiently. “Where the hell have you been?”\n\nScrunching up his face, he quirks an eyebrow. “Why aren’t you at work?”\n\nClint shakes his head and grabs Bucky’s arm, dragging him to the bathroom. “Shower and dress. The clothes you’re wearing are laying on your bed.”\n\n“I was…” Before he can finish the statement, Clint shoves him into the bathroom and slams the door. Confused, but willing to go along with Clint’s natural weirdness, he showers. The clothes on the bed are a surprise. They’re some of Bucky’s nicer clothes, but the shoes are not. The shoes are a pair that he’s been wanting, but can’t afford as a college student. He mentioned them to Clint a couple of times, so he’s trying to figure out how Clint bought them and still expects to make rent. Towel wrapped around his waist; he goes into the living room. Clint’s on the phone and holds up his hand to silence Bucky and then shoos him out of the room.\n\nMumbling to himself, Bucky goes back into the bedroom and puts on the clothes. Coming out dressed and pretty impressed with himself, Bucky finds Clint pacing. “What is going on? Are you okay? Clint talk to me.”\n\n“I can’t tell you what’s going on, it’s a surprise, but I can tell you that I think I have a date with the sexiest, smartest woman I’ve ever met, and I think she could kill me with her pinky. It’s scary, but awesome.” Bucky laughs. Leave it to Clint to bring him out of his awful mood.\n\n“Well, that’s great…I guess.” Clint ushers him out of the apartment and into the lift. Once outside, Bucky freezes. “Clint?”\n\nClint is standing in front of him, grasping his shoulders, so he can’t bolt for the door to go hide in his bedroom. “We’ve been friends for a long time, I want you to trust me.” Bucky glares at him, but nods.\n\nStanding next to a town car is Steve, holding a bouquet of sunflowers, Bucky’s favorite. This tells him that Clint helped set this up. Next to Steve is Sam, the boyfriend. This tells Bucky that Clint has lost his mind. Next to Sam is a woman with fiery red hair that’s looking at Clint like he’s dinner. This tells Bucky that Clint is right, and this woman can kill him with her pinky.\n\nSteve steps forward. “Bucky, I need to explain something to you.” That’s when Bucky notices the bruise on Steve’s face. He glares at Clint. “Don’t get mad at Clint, he came into my office today and punched me for propositioning you.”\n\nBucky’s face softens towards his traitorous friend. Clint raises his arms. “Hey, I defend my family, bro.”\n\nThe woman chuckles. “I swear you may be the only one in this mess that doesn’t need a life coach.”\n\nClint turns to her grinning. “So, you’re saying you don’t want to coach me?”\n\nShe kisses his cheek. “Later baby, later.”\n\nBucky raises his eyebrows. Clint is in for one crazy ride with that one. He turns back to Steve. “I don’t know what you think you know about me, but I don’t get into other people's relationships, even if both are okay with it. I can’t.” He lowers his eyes. “I thought you really liked me, which is dumb, since I was just your waiter.”\n\nSteve slams the flowers into Sam’s chest, who just barely catches them before they hit the ground and goes to Bucky. When Bucky flinches away, Steve stops. “I’ve really fucked this up. Sam, help.”\n\nSam gets his phone out and holds it up so Bucky can see. It’s Sam with a women, a very beautiful woman. She’s wearing a white dress, and Sam is in a tux. The wheels turn and it all clicks. Bucky looks between Sam and Steve. “So..you…he…not…”\n\n“No Buck, we’re not.” He takes the flowers back from Sam and hands them to Bucky. “Sam and I, we just…”\n\nNat smacks Steve in the back of the head and looks at Bucky. She’s frightening. “You see, James.” He looks confused. “I’m sorry, I refuse to call you Bucky. What kind of name is that anyway?” Clint cracks up and she sends him a pleased smile. “These two idiots don’t realize how much physical contact they have with each other, due to growing up together. So, when they came to the restaurant last night, they did what they always do and make everyone around them think they are a couple.” She steps away mumbling something that sounds like idiots .\n\n“If you’d like, I want to take you out. Or rather in, have dinner at my apartment. No strings, no expectation beyond dinner.” Steve looks pleadingly at Bucky. “Please Buck.”\n\nBucky holds the flowers close to his chest, a playful smile on his face. “I would like that.” He passes the flowers to Clint, and he gets in the car with Steve. “You did all this just to explain yourself.”\n\n“No…I mean yes, but not just to explain.” Bucky leans his head against the back rest and turns to look at Steve, quizzically. “I don’t know if you realize it or not, but I couldn’t keep my eyes off you that first night.” He brushes Bucky’s hair away from his face. “You are so beautiful.”\n\nThe first thing that Bucky thinks when they get to the apartment is holy shit. Once they are inside the actual apartment he thinks holy fucking shit. “You live here?” He steps over to the floor to ceiling windows, then out on the balcony. “This is insane.”\n\nSteve is very careful not to get too close. He doesn’t think touching is a good idea considering what Bucky thought about him last night. It makes him ache though. Just brushing his hair aside in the car had set something in Steve aflame. He can’t pinpoint what quality it is about Bucky, it’s just his everything. “I always wanted a place where I could see the skyline. When I first moved in 5 years ago, it’s the first thing I painted.”\n\n“You paint?” Bucky turns to rest his hip against the railing.\n\n“Yeah.” Steve points into the living room above the fireplace. “That’s the skyline I did.”\n\nBucky goes back inside looking up at the painting. It’s breathtaking. “Steve, this is amazing.”\n\nSteve is mesmerized by Bucky and thrown by how right he looks standing in Steve’s apartment. He clears his throat. “You want something to drink?”\n\n“Yeah, you have beer?” Steve nods and goes into the kitchen. Bucky follows close behind. He’s watching Steve and notices how he keeps his distance. There’s something warm about him and the apartment. Like home. He smirks when Steve turns around to find him in the kitchen. He takes a step back so he’s not too close to Bucky. “You afraid of me, Steve?”\n\n“I am actually.” Bucky wasn’t expecting that response. Posturing maybe, but not honesty. Bucky sits down on one of the stools and waits. Steve seems to be struggling with what he wants to say, how much could be misunderstood. His shoulders are tense, he's leaning with both hands on the countertop, his head is bowed, so Bucky keeps waiting. “I’ve never been so drawn to someone. I had a four-week relationship a few years ago and that guy just disappeared one day, and I never heard from him again. I love my job, Bucky. I built this company with Sam’s help from the ground up, but I don’t know what I did it for if I come home to an empty apartment every night.” Now, Steve Rogers is starting to make sense to Bucky. He’s a driven man, building his company, but he looked up one day and found that he has all the material things in life. He just doesn’t have anyone to share it all with.\n\nSteve finally looks up and meets soft, endeared eyes. “I’m working on my second master’s degree in biometric engineering, so I can build a better prosthetic. I want to help as many veterans as possible. My dad died serving this country and I want to give back.” He can see that Steve doesn’t know where this is all going, so he continues. “I’m 22 and have one more semester before I finish and it’s kicking my ass.” He sees Steve’s eyes widen when he mentions his age. “I may be young and what my grandma called a prodigy, but it’s made me figure out what I want from a much younger age than all my friends. I want a home with someone that I love, that loves me in return. I want a cat and nights when I’m snuggled up on the couch with the man I love, who understands how important my work is to me.” He grins over at Steve. “You know anyone that might want to apply for that position?”\n\n“Yeah.” Steve comes around the counter cupping Bucky’s face gently. “Yeah, I know someone that needs an immediate interview.” And he’s kissing Bucky like the young man has never been kissed before.\n\nNothing beyond kissing happens that night and Bucky is overwhelmed by what Steve went through for him. He cooks his favorite meal and then has gelato from Dave’s for dessert. They sit for hours talking about their lives and friends. Bucky finds out that Steve lost his dad before he was even born. It turns out that Steve’s dad died defending his country too. Steve’s ma died before he graduated from high school and the name of his company is because of her. “I was this little 90-pound weakling until my senior year in high school.” He shows Bucky a picture and he nearly spits his beer across the room. Tiny Steve was adorable. “Anyway, she was a nurse and took care of me through every illness that tried to kill me. She was my shield against the world. Never gave up on me, never saw me as anything but her perfect Steve.”\n\n“I’m sorry, Stevie.” Bucky pulls him close and holds him. He doesn’t think he’s helping until every muscle in Steve’s body relaxes into him. “My mom still lives in Indiana. I came back here for college because it’s where I grew up until I was about 14. We didn’t have a lot, but mom always did her best and I will always admire her for that. She’s proud of me and understands why this is important to me.”\n\n“You said that your grandmother called you a prodigy.” It’s not really a question, but Steve wants more information.\n\n“Well yeah, when I was six, I started taking things apart, you know to see how they worked.” Steve chuckles. “My grandma knew I was different when I could put it back together and it worked better than before.” They both laugh. “She encouraged me to do what made me happy and so if it could come apart, I took it apart and made it work better. I graduated high school when I was 15 and even though MIT wanted me on a full scholarship, I chose NYU because I wanted to come home.”\n\nSteve stays quiet for a while, taking in everything Bucky has volunteered. Then he sighs. Bucky looks up and sees Steve’s pensive face. “Buck, you know I’m a lot older than you. I’m 35.”\n\nBucky laughs, cupping Steve’s cheek. “Yeah, I know how old you are, and I don’t give a rats ass about age.” He strokes Steve’s cheek. “Does it really matter that much to you?”\n\nSteve looks down and won’t meet Bucky’s eyes. “It matters to me because of you.” Bucky cocks his head to the side, not understanding. “They’re going to see an older man with a younger man and think…”\n\nHe doesn’t finish because Bucky grins and interjects. “They’re going to think I have a sugar daddy.” There’s a sparkle in his eye and Steve’s breath gets sucked out of his lungs. Bucky scoots closer to Steve and pecks him on the lips. “You wanna be my daddy, Stevie.”\n\nSteve hops off the couch so fast, Bucky nearly falls over. “Jesus fucking Christ, Buck.” It’s a breathless whisper as Steve paces across the living room. Bucky thinks that Steve’s upset, until he rights himself and looks at the older man. His eyes are blow wide, his pants have gotten decidedly tighter in the crotch area, he’s breathing heavy.\n\nOh.\n\n“Oh.” Bucky gets up and saunters over to him. “You like that idea, don’t you?”\n\nSteve looks so embarrassed. “I’m a horrible person.” His head is hanging, and his shoulders are slumped.\n\nAnd for Bucky, that just won’t do. He slides his hands up Steve’s arms and around his neck. “I wouldn’t be opposed to that kind of thing. Especially since I have a feeling you bought me these shoes, just to show me you cared.” Steve nods, but seems unable to talk. “So, you want to spoil me, is that it?” Steve nods again. “And you’ll let me spoil you too?” Again, with the nodding, very emphatic nodding. “And when we get to that point, you know bedroom stuff, if Daddy slips out, you’d be okay with that?”\n\nSteve honest to god whimpers and lays his forehead on Bucky’s shoulder. “Fuck.”\n\nBucky laughs. “I’m going to take that as a yes.” Without raising his head, Steve nods. Then it hits Bucky like a freight train. “You don’t want people thinking I’m after you for your money. That’s why you're holding back.”\n\nSteve finally looks up holding eye contact for a few minutes. “I don’t want anyone ever thinking less of you. You’re special. Bucky, I’m not going to lie here, it won’t be long before I’m going to want to tell you ‘I love you’ and I don’t want that to be what chases you off, so if this is just something fun for a little while, for you, tell me now.”\n\nBucky pulls Steve against him and just holds him. He feels Steve relax against him again and it makes him wonder if Steve has been relaxed in recent years. It also stuns him to realize that he wants to be the one to make Steve relax at the end of a long day. “It’s not just something fun.”\n\nThe car takes Bucky home close to 11, when the lack of sleep the night before starts to catch up with him and he begins yawning. He fusses with Steve for a bit about leaving, but finally caves and lets Steve walk him downstairs. The driver looks at him in the rearview mirror, almost a smirk showing on his face and Bucky sees what Steve was concerned about. Except, Bucky just grins because Steve was worried about this very thing. He was worried about Bucky.\n\nWhen he arrives home, Nat is sitting in the living room eating his ice cream. “Come on! That’s mine.”\n\nShe smirks while putting another spoonful in her mouth. “I’d be concerned except I know you ate the best gelato in the city for dessert.”\n\nClint comes out of his bedroom in pajama pants grinning way too big. “She’s got you there.” He plops down next to Nat, and she feeds him.\n\n“How did it go?” The look she has makes Bucky uncomfortable, like she’s expecting the dirty details of some illicit affair.\n\nHe knows she’s a friend of Steve’s, so he won’t say what he’d like. “I’ll see you in the morning, Clint.” And with that, he goes into his room and flops on the bed. Pulling out his phone, he shoots a text to Steve.\n\nBucky: What do you feel comfortable telling me about the red head?”\n\nSteve: Who? Nat?\n\nBucky: Yeah.\n\nSteve: Buck, what’s wrong?\n\nBucky: Who said there’s anything wrong? I got home and she’s here eating my ice cream. If she’s going to be here, then I’d like to know who my best friend is…doing whatever with.\n\nSteve: <laughing emoji> She’s a good person. Comes off as rough around the edges, hell she is rough around the edges, but she’s a good soul.\n\nBucky decides to change the conversation when he notices the sneakers. He clicks a picture of them and sends it to Steve. Raising his leg, he looks at the shoes, grinning.\n\nBucky: I forgot to say thank you for the shoes.\n\nSteve: You’re welcome. Get used to it. I’m going to want to buy you things all the time.\n\nBucky grins wickedly and composes the next text.\n\nBucky: I can’t say that I won’t put up a fight sometimes, but I could also get used to you being a good daddy.\n\nBucky sees the typing bubble come up, then disappear, then come back up, like Steve is having trouble figuring out what to say.\n\nSteve: Baby, I am going to spoil you rotten.\n\nBucky groans and can feel his dick getting hard. He reaches down and rubs through his jeans, then gets an even better idea. Leaving his hand where it is on his clothed cock, he clicks another picture and sends it.\n\nBucky: This is what you caused.\n\nWhat he gets in return makes him completely hard and whimper like a puppy. Steve sends a dick pic and Bucky practically drools. Steve is perfect, thick, long and wet.\n\nBucky: Jesus Stevie…\n\nBucky unbuttons his jeans and pulls himself out. Clicking another picture, he sends it to Steve. No caption, just stroking himself.\n\nSteve doesn’t respond immediately, then Bucky’s phone rings. When he picks up, he knows that Steve is close, so he speeds up his hand.\n\n“Fuck baby, you are so goddam perfect.” Steve voice is rough, a near growl. “Say it, Buck. Please.”\n\nBucky swallows thickly, so close and knows that Steve is too. “Come for me, Daddy. Wanna hear it.”\n\nAnd that’s it, Steve screams Bucky’s name and it’s the most erotic thing that Bucky’s ever heard and comes seconds later whimpering Steve’s name. This man has an effect on Bucky that no one ever has.\n\nBucky cuddles his pillow and turns on his side with his phone trapped between his head and the other pillow. “Mmmmm, that was nice.”\n\nThere’s low chuckle from the phone. “Get some sleep, baby.”\n\nBucky smiles. “G’night Stevie.”\n\nThey make plans to see each other on Tuesday because Bucky is working double shifts at Dave’s on Saturday and Sunday. Monday, he has his lab time until 10, so Tuesday is the soonest they can manage. Nat isn’t there Saturday morning when Bucky gets up and Clint hasn’t risen from the dead yet. He makes coffee and pulls out his computer. He goes to the SHIELD website and if he has it bookmarked no one needs to know that.\n\nHe looks through the employees and finds bios on everyone that works there. He starts with Sam, the CFO of SHIELD. Sam and Steve went to high school and college together. Sam is credited with Steve starting SHIELD because of an advertising contest in college. He’s married to Maria Hill-Wilson, and they have a daughter, Rosy. Okay, good guy and happily married. Also, Steve’s best friend, so that needs to be addressed with an apology from Bucky.\n\nNext up is Natalia Romanova, CIO of SHIELD. She met Steve and Sam her senior year of college. She was an exchange student from Russia. The information is much less than what is on Steve and Sam’s pages. As he’s navigating through the few pictures on her page, his phone buzzes with a text. Grabbing it, hoping that it’s Steve, he finds it’s from an unknown number.\n\nUnknown #: Having fun creeping on my page, Barnes?\n\nBucky: Who is this?\n\nUnknown #: Nat.\n\nBucky: What do you want? Run out of ice cream at your place?\n\nNat: <laugh/crying emoji> I guess you think you’re funny.\n\nBucky: I’m goddam hysterical.\n\nNat: We need to talk. Meet me for coffee at that place down the street from you. The one with the mocha latte you like.\n\nBucky drops his phone. Who is this woman?\n\nBucky: And if I don’t?\n\nNat: You don’t want to go there, Barnes. See you in an hour.\n\nYeah, she’s scary and Bucky gets up to shower. He’s going to do what she wants until he can get a better read on her.\n\nHe steps into the coffee shop and sees her sitting at a back table, sipping on what looks like tea. There’s a latte sitting across the table waiting for him and a slice of plum tart. Sliding into the seat, he pushes his sunglasses on top of his head. He’s pretty sure he knows what this is about. The age difference might not be okay with everyone and she’s probably protecting her friend and making sure that Bucky isn’t a gold-digger.\n\n“Is this the ‘if you hurt him, I’ll kill you’ speech?” He’s trying to be funny, but is sure that’s exactly what this is.\n\nShe takes a sip, sizing him up, then floors him with her next statement. “No, this is the ‘I don’t want to see him hurt you’ speech.” He doesn’t know how to respond, so he just sits quietly. He reaches across the table and lays a hand on her arm, encouraging her to say what she wants to say. Her voice and face soften and that’s even more frightening than her normal ‘I can kill you with my mind’ face. “Steve is a really special guy. He hired me as soon as SHIELD had the budget. They are my family, but I know my family’s faults.” Bucky swallows thickly. “Sometimes he gets into his work.” Bucky smirks. “No, you don’t understand, he really gets into his work.”\n\n“Natalia, I really don’t understand what this is about.” He picks up the latte and drinks. It’s perfect, it even has an extra shot of espresso.\n\n“Did he tell you about his last relationship?” Bucky nods his head as he takes a bite of the tart. “Did he tell you that the guy disappeared?”\n\n“Yeah, he said he came home one day, and he was just gone.” Bucky gets a sinking feeling in his gut.\n\n“Well, he’d actually been gone for a week and Steve didn’t notice.” Bucky’s eyes nearly pop out of his head. “Don’t get me wrong, that was at the beginning, when the company was under fire, before Stark saved it by giving Steve a chance, but still, you can see why I’m worried.”\n\n“It took him a week to notice?” It’s so different from the man Bucky’s getting to know.\n\n“Yes.” There’s stunned silence for several minutes. “The difference this time is you have me in your corner. Steve’s never done anything like he did yesterday for anyone. This time, if you are really in this for the long haul, I’m going to make sure he doesn’t do that again, but I need to know that you are really in this.”\n\nHe gives her a half smile. “So, this is the ‘if you hurt him, I’ll kill you’ speech?” She laughs loud enough for several other tables to look at them. When she settles, he decides what the hell. “I’ve never been in a relationship.” She quirks and eyebrow. “I’ve slept with my fair share of people, but no one stuck. Maybe it was because I wasn’t really looking, maybe it was they weren’t really looking, I don’t know, but I do know that three nights ago a man walked into the restaurant and figuratively brought me to my knees. At first, it was just how gorgeous he was, then as we talked…and flirted…I could tell that he was a really nice guy. Kind and easy to talk to. I never reacted so strongly to anyone before.”\n\n“That’s good because at his core, he is just a really nice guy, but he can be a selfish asshole sometimes.” She smirks which seems to be her default setting.\n\n“I’m sure you’ve done your research on me, you probably know everything there is to know about me, so I’m going to assume you know about my life.” She nods. “I told Steve last night that because I was so far ahead of most of my age group, I had to make decisions faster. Being 22 and having two master’s degrees means I have to know what I want out of my life.” Their eyes lock. “I want Steve, in whatever capacity he wants me.”\n\nShe leans back and relaxes in the chair. “I expect to officiate the wedding.” Bucky bursts with laughter. They spend another hour just talking about his project.\n\nHe goes into work at 10:30 with a message from Steve that is nothing but a series of heart eye emojis. Bucky gets great tips that night because he can’t stop smiling no matter what happens on the floor. He’s exhausted when he gets home, but spends three more hours working through calculations on his project. He falls asleep without checking his phone. He misses the six texts from Steve.\n\nSunday morning dawns and Steve is out for a run when his phone chimes. Stopping long enough to check, he sees that it’s Bucky.\n\nBucky: God, I’m a fucking awful person. I’m sorry I didn’t respond last night, I was working on my project and fell asleep.\n\nSteve smiles down at his phone.\n\nSteve: It’s okay, Buck. I figured it was something like that. You don’t have to worry if you don’t text back or can’t take a call, you’re working on something important. I’m here.\n\nBucky: Jesus, are you real? You can be upset with me.\n\nSteve laughs.\n\nSteve: But I’m not upset. I miss you, but I’m not upset or mad.\n\nSteve: What time do you work today?\n\nBucky: I have to be there at 10:30. Working another double.\n\nBucky doesn’t tell Steve that he needs the money. Paying for another master's is expensive, and he needs every penny for rent and bills.\n\nSteve: Meet me at Dave’s at 10?\n\nSteve: If you want to.\n\nBucky: <blowing kisses emojis> I’ll see you then.\n\nSteve finishes his run, and Bucky does a little work on his project before getting up to shower. Clint is sitting in the kitchen with Nat when he comes in for coffee.\n\n“Nat! I didn’t know you were here.” She’s petting Clint’s hair while his head is on the table.\n\n“I was going to take this tired puppy for breakfast, but he can’t seem to wake up.” She’s grinning as she says it, hoping to get a response from Clint.\n\nHis voice is muffled from his face being buried in his arms. “Not a puppy.” They crack up. “Maybe a little bit of a puppy. Keep petting me.”\n\nShe keeps running her fingers through his hair and he rumbles with contentment.\n\n“Well, I have to get to the bookstore before work, so I’ll see you later.” He pours coffee into a travel mug and heads out. Whatever this thing is with Clint and Nat, it’s going to be fun to watch.\n\nAt 9:45 Bucky rounds the corner to the back entrance to Dave’s and finds Steve already there. He’s sitting out back, with Mr. Rossi at a table that the boss put there for employees to use to eat or in this case, smoke a really expensive cigar. Steve sees him and jumps up with more flowers. This time they are lavender roses. Bucky’s never seen anything so beautiful besides Steve. He’s also brought lunch from a deli that Bucky loves.\n\nThey stop in front of each other, Steve’s still holding the flowers, but he’s cupping Bucky cheek like he’s delicate and precious. “Hi.”\n\nBucky leans up and rubs noses with him. “Hi.”\n\nDave stands and puts out the cigar for later. “And on that note, I’m going to head in. Take a few extra minutes for lunch kid.” He turns to leave, but stops at the door. “Oh, and kid,” Bucky looks away from Steve to his boss. “Look up the meaning of those roses. There’s a message there.”\n\nSteve blushes so deep and looks away. “Steve?”\n\n“Come on Buck, let’s eat before you have to go in.” Lacing their fingers together, Steve pulls him to the table.\n\nLater, when there’s a break in the afternoon, Bucky does look up the meaning of the roses. They mean enchanted. He blushes and looks over at the hostess station where Dave put the roses in water and has them waiting for Bucky to take home at closing.\n\nHe works late into the night on his project, but makes a point to check his phone on and off. They text a little here and there, then Steve tells him to get back to work. It’s almost 3 when he crawls in bed, with a last text to Steve, saying simply, “g’night Stevie.”\n\nHe’s able to sleep in on Monday because his class is at 4 and lab time isn’t until 7. With a smile, Bucky makes a decision and goes into the kitchen to start cooking. He texts Nat asking about Steve’s regular lunch time. She promises to keep him in the office until Bucky gets there. When he shows up at 12:30, she’s waiting in the lobby for him. “I had Sam make up an excuse to keep him in his office.” Bucky grins, having friends in high places makes a world of difference. “I know you have a class at 4, but before you leave, I need to see you. I’m on the same floor as Steve.” He looks confused, but nods.\n\nWhen they get to Steve’s door, he can hear that Sam is about to give up. “No, really, I was just thinking that we should make some changes to Tony’s recent ad campaign.”\n\n“And this can’t wait until I’ve gone to get lunch. You’re the one always telling me to stop long enough to eat something.” Bucky pushes the door open and when Steve looks up, you’d think it was Christmas morning. “Is this why you’ve been trying to keep me here?” He looks at Sam accusingly.\n\n“What can I say? I’m rooting for the kid.” He and Nat leave the office, shutting the door behind them.\n\nBucky puts the bag on Steve’s desk and goes around to hug him. Steve leans in and kisses him lightly. “What do I owe this visit to?”\n\nBucky kisses him again, then again. “You brought me lunch yesterday, so I thought I’d repay the favor. Plus, you did say I could spoil you too.” He looks at Steve from under his lashes.\n\nSteve pulls him even closer. “Baby, you spoil me just by showing up.” Bucky buries his face in Steve’s neck, inhaling deeply. “What did you bring?” He unpacks the veggie spring rolls and chicken fried rice that Bucky fixed. “You made this?”\n\nBucky seems surprised and freezes. “Uh…yeah…”\n\n“Are there anymore secret abilities you have that I need to know about?”\n\nBucky flutters his eye lashes. “You’ll have to wait and see. If I tell you all my secrets, you’ll lose interest.”\n\n“Not in a million years.”\n\nAn hour later, he leaves Steve to a conference call and makes his way down the hall to Natalia’s office. He can hear her talking to someone and thinks it might be Sam, since it’s a male voice. He knocks and the door opens from the pressure. He isn’t expecting to see Tony Stark standing next to Nat’s desk, pointing at her computer.\n\n“Oh, James, come in.” He’s frozen for just a second, then stumbles in. “James Barnes, this is Tony Stark. I believe you two have something to discuss.” She exits the room, closing the door behind her.\n\nBucky looks at Stark like a deer caught in headlights. Stark starts laughing. “I’m going to doubt Romanova’s assessment of you, if you keep looking at me blank like that.”\n\nBucky shakes himself out of it and comes forward extending his hand. “Mr. Stark, it’s a pleasure.”\n\n“Of course, it is.” Tony smirks, but takes Bucky’s hand.\n\n“Nat tells me you’re working on a prosthetic.” That sets Bucky off and for the next hour he goes on about the project. Tony just lets him go and smiles at the enthusiasm. When he’s done, Tony sits in silence. Anyone that knows Tony Stark knows that very little makes him speechless.\n\nThen he gets up and starts pacing, but Bucky can tell that he’s processing. Finally, he looks at Bucky almost as excited as the young graduate student. “So, if I’m understanding this right and I am, because I’m me, you have found a way to harness the electrical impulses of the human body to make this arm work?”\n\nBucky likes that he’s talking to someone that gets it. “Well yeah, that part wasn’t hard. The hard part is an arm that is light enough to actually be of use.”\n\n“If I get you the material, can you build this thing? Like for real?” Tony is sitting again, looking at Bucky like he’s a diamond.\n\n“You’re damn right I can.”\n\nTuesday Bucky is at Steve’s having dinner with Nat, Clint, Sam, Maria and little Rosy. Rosy is 18 months, and the cutest damn thing Bucky has ever seen. He’s been carrying her around all evening and even sat her in his lap while they ate. He’s on the balcony with her, showing her the view, when she lays her head on his shoulder and starts to drift off.\n\n“That’s our cue to head home.” Maria comes out and takes the little girl. “You’re amazing with kids. Had some practice?”\n\nBucky grins. “Two little sisters. They kept me busy when I was younger.”\n\n“How old are they?” Maria pats her daughter’s back.\n\n“Becca is 18 now and headed to Berkley in the spring and Emma is 15 and the wild child.” Maria laughs.\n\n“You’re a good man, Mr. Barnes and you're really good for that idiot in there.” She pats his arm as she walks away.\n\nBucky blushes. “I hope so, I want to be.” Maria and Sam leave not too much later. Bucky finds himself back on the balcony with Steve wrapped around him from behind. “I like your friends.”\n\nSteve nuzzles the back of his neck. “I don’t think they’re just mine anymore.” Bucky relaxes back into the warmth of Steve. “I like your friend, too. When he’s not punching me in the face, he’s really funny.”\n\nBucky hums and closes his eyes to just feel. They don’t hear Nat come out. “Steve, why didn’t you tell me you were painting again?”\n\nThey both jump a little and Steve fumbles over his words unable to get a complete sentence out. Bucky can see his embarrassment. “Steve?”\n\nHe hangs his head. “Nat, I really wish you wouldn’t have gone in the studio.”\n\nFor the first time ever, Steve sees Nat flustered. “I didn’t know. I’m sorry, Steve.”\n\nBucky turns Steve to face him. “Steve, what’s wrong?”\n\nSteve sighs. “I was really upset that night, and I painted you. I didn’t really know I was doing it until it was almost done.”\n\nBucky grins. “I wanna see!” He goes into the apartment and heads to the studio. He hears Steve behind him, but doesn’t stop until he’s standing in front of the most incredible things he’s ever seen. “Jesus Steve, it’s…” He doesn’t finish because he’s speechless. See, Bucky knows that he’s attractive, but the way Steve painted him, he’s gorgeous. “I don’t really look like that.”\n\nAt first Steve thinks Bucky hates it until he comes around to apologize and sees Bucky’s face. Tears are tracking down his cheeks, but the look in his eyes is awed. “You’re that and so much more.”\n\n“And on that note, Clint and I are leaving. We’ll see you at home, James.” She stops at the door and adds, “Or not.”\n\nSteve wrapped himself back around Bucky from behind as they stared at the painting, neither move when they hear the front door close. “I can’t believe you made me look so beautiful.”\n\nSteve huffs a laugh and puts his chin on Buck’s shoulder. “Do you ever look in a mirror? I didn’t paint anything that wasn’t already there.”\n\nBucky turns in his arms and cups Steve’s face in his hands. “You see something that no one else sees.”\n\nResting his forehead against Bucky’s, Steve response. “I see you.”\n\n“I have classes tomorrow, but I want to stay with you tonight.” His answer is Steve’s kiss: deep, soul-searing, heart wrenchingly perfect kiss.\n\nWhen Bucky wakes in the morning, Steve is sitting in a chair by the window, facing the bed. The sheet draped at Bucky’s waist, making him look like a statue of the finest sculpted marble. Steve is sketching him, capturing this moment in time. Bucky smiles at Steve with his tongue poking from the corner of his mouth in concentration. “What are you doing, Stevie?”\n\nSteve looks up and he fills the room with joy and contentment. “Drawing an angel.”\n\nBucky blushes and rolls onto his stomach, hiding his face in the pillow. Steve sits the pad and pencil down and crawls back on the bed, pushing Bucky’s hair away from his face and smiling down at him. “So, spoiling means saying things like that?”\n\nSteve kisses his temple and lets his lips linger. “Most of the spoiling is going to be stuff like that.” Bucky rolls onto his back and makes grabby hands at Steve. Steve chuckles and goes without hesitation. “You are so fucking cute in the morning.”\n\n“Just for you. No one else thinks I’m cute.” They kiss and Steve rolls them so that he’s laying with Bucky’s head resting on his chest. Bucky hums when Steve starts to run his hand through his hair, scratching at his scalp. “I’m going to let you keep spoiling me.”\n\n“You don’t really have a choice.” They lay in silence and Steve just enjoys the warmth of the moment. “What time is your class?”\n\n“It’s not until four and I have the late lab again tonight.” The thought of leaving doesn’t sit well with Bucky, so he snuggles closer.\n\n“Speaking of your lab, are you okay with Tony being involved?” Bucky sits and looks at Steve, confused. “He has a way of taking over things and I don’t want anything messing up your project.”\n\nBucky grins down at him. “I’m going to start thinking you care about me, Stevie.”\n\nSteve blushes and doesn’t say anything for a minute. “You have no idea.”\n\nSettling back down on Steve, Bucky thinks about his day. “I’m going to have to go home to get showered and clean clothes before class.”\n\n“Uhmm…” Steve’s hand freezes in Bucky’s hair.\n\nBucky thinks about the new shoes from the ‘day of explanation.’ “Steve? What have you done?”\n\nSteve sits up, hands out in defense, looking guilty. “Now before you get upset with me, I just want you to know that Clint had something to do with it.” He gets up and goes to the closet, opening the door. Bucky can see that it’s a huge walk-in affair with a bench in the middle and built in drawers. “I wasn’t sure what to get that day and Clint just kept throwing things in my arms and well, Buck…I couldn’t help it and so I got other stuff…and…you’re going to make me take it all back aren’t you.”\n\nHe’s been babbling for several minutes, and Bucky is sitting slack jawed in the bed, while Steve indicates at least a third of the closet space that seems to be clothes for Bucky, shoes stacked underneath. He starts laughing when he doesn’t know what else to do. Climbing out of bed, he goes to the closet, but doesn’t miss the way Steve reacts to his lack of clothing. “You bought me a new wardrobe?”\n\nHe pulls Bucky against him and sucks in a breath. “Jesus, you feel good and no, not a whole new wardrobe, half of one…sort of.”\n\nBucky laughs again and looks at the clothes hanging there with tags still attached. “You are a ridiculous man, Steven Rogers.”\n\nSteve’s hands are roaming Bucky’s back and sides, seemingly unable to touch him enough. His voice drops, seductively. “I have to buy my baby things.”\n\nBucky turns, eyebrow cocked. “Well maybe we should shower, so I can try on my new clothes…” He heads into the bathroom and adds, “Daddy.” Steve is hot on his heels.\n\nWednesday morning finds Sam and Natalia sitting in Steve’s office waiting. When he comes in around ten whistling a happy tune, they start grinning and he freezes in the door. “What…why…did we have a meeting…oh fuck, we had a meeting.”\n\nA chuckle comes from the wet bar where Tony is getting some water. “Uh, yeah, Steve we had a meeting, but considering how happy you are, I’m going to let it slide this time.”\n\nSteve looks mortified. “Tony, damn, I’m sorry. I can’t believe I forgot.”\n\nTony smirks. “Well, since I know why you were late; I’ll overlook it if you tell me the filthy details.”\n\nSteve knows he’s kidding, but boy some part of him wants to scream from the roof tops that his baby is perfect and sweet and everything Steve’s ever wanted. “Not a chance in hell, man.” But the blush is enough to tell the room just how happy he is.\n\n“Wow, that good, huh?” Steve blushes even further and says nothing.\n\nBucky works long into the night. When he’d gotten to the lab after class, Tony was waiting; he’d personally brought the materials that Bucky needed to complete his final project. Bucky wasn’t expecting to open the crates and find vibranium. “Wha…”\n\n“I have friends in high places.” Tony just smirks and takes a seat next to the work bench, scanning the blueprints and schematics of Bucky’s project. “If this works, you have a job with me as soon as graduation is over.”\n\nBucky’s head shoot up. “Are you serious?”\n\n“I don’t joke about something this important. I’m already having them fit your lab at the tower. This is our new project. This is what I’ve been wanting to do, something that really matters, something that will help people that really need it, that deserve it.” Tony is an arrogant douche sometimes, but his ultimate goal is the betterment of society.\n\n“Thank you.” It’s all Bucky has, just unending gratitude.\n\nTony stays most of the night, watching and quietly being increasingly impressed. The kid’s a genius. On top of that, he makes Steve happy. Tony’s company paid an exorbitated amount for Steve’s firm’s services, but Steve is also Tony’s friend and this kid, this kid did something to Steve that Tony has wanted to see for a long time. He makes Steve happy.\n\nClose to four Bucky locks everything away in his work bench and staggers to the parking lot where a car is waiting. Tony had disappeared around three, but sent the car back for Bucky. In the back seat, Bucky checks his phone and finds an insane number of texts from Steve. Each one, sweeter and more worried. He shoots one back as they pull up to his apartment.\n\nBucky: ‘Hey Stevie. You asked me if I had a problem with Tony and my project. He just watched, didn’t even volunteer insight. It’s going to be amazing. I can’t wait for you to see it. I’m just getting home. Have work later. Miss you.’ Bucky falls into bed after setting his alarm.\n\nThe months come and go and Steve finds that working, as much as he loves it, isn’t as fun as being with Bucky. His friends watch as he spends more time with the young man, and no one begrudges him the time. The only problem comes when it starts to get close to Bucky defending his project. His nerves are overwrought and nothing that Steve does will settle him down. Steve steps back, giving Bucky the space to process his feelings.\n\nIt’s a quiet Sunday. Steve fixed a light meal and insisted that Bucky eat something. They had a stand off, but Bucky finally acquiesced and ate. Once he started eating, he was thankful and tried to apologize for being an ass. Steve waved him off and explained that he understands, that he’s been there, that he’ll give Bucky anything he needs to be okay. They try to watch something mindless on TV, but Bucky’s fidgety and finally pushes up off the sofa.\n\n“I’m going to go for a walk.” Steve gets up to join him, but Bucky holds up his hand. “I need to clear my head.” Steve sits back down, and Bucky grabs his keys, phone, and wallet. Steve’s learned in this short, but intense relationship that sometimes when Bucky is working through a problem with the arm or just gets overwhelmed with school and work, he walks. Before he leaves, Bucky comes over, kissing Steve. “Thank you for understanding. I’m really not this much of an asshole.”\n\nSteve snorts, hugging Bucky close. “I never thought you were an asshole. Go clear your head and when you get back, I’ll fix a bath for you.” Bucky kisses him again and heads out. He waves at the doorman, heading out into the gloomy city. Rain is coming and that suits Bucky’s mood.\n\nIn six weeks, he has to present his project and it’s not quite ready yet. Putting it together hasn’t gone as smoothly as Bucky would like and Steve can listen, but can’t really volunteer any help. Bucky’s intellect is beyond Steve’s comprehension sometimes. If Bucky can figure out the issue with the fingers, he can have it ready. He walks through Manhattan with his mind going over and over the specs; running calculations in his head.\n\nIt starts to rain and comes down in waves. Bucky doesn’t even notice and keeps working through the issue.\n\nHe doesn’t hear the car honk.\n\nHe doesn’t hear the screaming of the people around him.\n\nHe doesn’t hear the screeching tires.\n\nHe only feels the blinding pain before he passes out.\n\nBucky’s been gone for hours, and Steve starts to get worried. He calls Clint, who hasn’t seen or heard from Bucky since the night before at work. Steve’s call has Clint worried too. Much later, after it’s dark and Steve is pacing and trying to call Bucky’s phone for the hundredth time, there’s a knock on the door. Running, hoping that Bucky just didn’t think about the fact that he’s had a key to Steve’s apartment for months, he throws the door open to find the Clint. The tears cascading down Clint’s face tell the story.\n\n“Oh god…” They rush to the hospital, calling everyone they can think of. The orderly takes them to the surgery waiting area and before an hour is up, the room starts to fill up with his people. As Bucky’s emergency contact, Steve has to sign papers. He doesn’t know what he’s signing, although someone is trying to explain it. All he can think about is Bucky. He doesn’t even know when Bucky changed his emergency contact from Clint.\n\nClint sits with Nat, head on her shoulder and her fingers running through his hair, telling him that everything is going to be okay. Steve is still pacing while Tony and Sam watch, not knowing how to help their friend. When Sam had called Tony to tell him what was happening, Tony had immediately called Pepper. She doesn’t show up at the hospital until she’s called Helen.\n\nHelen comes and goes straight into the surgical unit. Steve doesn’t know how long she’s been back there, and the waiting becomes too much. The weight of this, of the fact that he could lose Bucky, hits him all at once. Falling to his knees, Sam and Tony come to him, pulling him into a combined hug. “Ssssshhhhh…Steve, he’s going to be okay.”\n\nSteve crashes, sobbing into Sam’s shoulder and holding Tony in a crushing embrace. “You don’t know that.” They let him cry, then pull him back into a chair. Steve meets Clint’s eyes from across the room. The two people, in the city, that love Bucky the most are right here.\n\nAfter what feels like an eternity, the doors open, and Helen comes out. She’s in scrubs and there’s blood. “He’s going to be okay.” Steve looks up, anxiety ridden. “But there was a complication.” As Bucky’s emergency contact, she talks directly to Steve.\n\nSteve stands, going to her. “Whatever it is, tell me. I need to understand what happened.”\n\nShe pulls him to the chairs. “According to the police, a car lost control and pinned him to the side of a building.” Steve chokes on another sob. She lays a hand on his arm. “They were trying to save the arm, but it just wasn’t possible. Every time they unclamped the artery he would crash. Saving the arm wasn’t an option. I had to make a decision, and it was either the arm or Bucky.”\n\nThe realization of what she’s saying hits Steve like a train. “So…the arm.”\n\n“Steve, we had to. If we didn’t, he would have died on the table.” Steve nods, lips in a thin line. “I know how this may seem, but he’s going to make a full recovery.”\n\nClint watches Steve and wonders if this will be what makes the man walk away from his friend, but Steve’s next words settle Clint’s nerves. “I don’t give a damn about the arm as long as he’s okay.” Clint comes over, hugging him tightly. “Can I see him?”\n\n“He’s going to be in recovery for several hours, then we’ll move him to ICU. He’s going to be out of it for a few days.” She squeezes his hand and goes back through the doors.\n\nSteve straightens his shoulders, squaring them and clears his throat. “Tony, I need you to call the university and explain what’s happened. Sam call Dave’s and explain the situation.” He looks at Clint. “I’m going to send movers to your apartment and have everything packed and moved to my place. He’s going to need a secure place to stay and he’s going to need you there for support.” Clint’s eyes bug out. “You live in Manhattan now, Clint.”\n\nClint squares off with Steve. “Don’t give a damn where I live as long as he needs me, he’s got me.” Nat kisses Clint’s cheek.\n\nSteve pulls out his phone, scrolling through the numbers. “I need to call his mother. I should have thought of it before now.”\n\nNat shakes her head. “You weren’t thinking. She’ll understand and so will Bucky.”\n\nSteve looks at Nat, nodding. “Call the St. Regis and reserve a suite for his family and get first class plane tickets from Indiana to New York.” She nods and pulls out her phone.\n\nThe call to Bucky’s mother is the hardest that Steve’s ever had to make. He explains what he knows and tells her that she has plane tickets and a hotel waiting for her and the girls. She’s thankful, but more concerned with Bucky. Once the call is over, he sends her the plane reservations to the email that she gives him. “Steve?”\n\nHe turns to see Clint looking dragged out and shaking. Steve pulls him over to a chair. Kneeling down in front of the younger man, Steve holds his hands. “It doesn’t matter what he needs or what you need, I’m going to make sure it happens. Clint?” Clint looks up. “We aren’t going to lose him. He made it through the surgery and anything he needs, he gets. And if that means he’s pissed at life for a while, then I’ll be his punching bag.”\n\nClint snorts. “Man, you really are in love with him, aren’t you?”\n\nSteve stops and realizes that somewhere in all the time they spend together, he’s fallen head over heels for Bucky. “You damn right I do and I’m not giving up on him.”\n\nBucky wakes a few days later with Steve holding his hand and Clint watching over him. He wheezes out a barely there, “hey.”\n\nSteve’s on his feet and Clint’s out the door to get the doctor. “Hey, baby.”\n\nBucky smiles softly. “what happened?”\n\nThe door flies open and Dr. Cho, who’s taken over his care due to Pepper and Tony, comes in smiling. “Mr. Barnes, it is really good to see you.” She does a once over, telling him what happened and Steve watches him closely for any signs of grief or anger. None of it shows up.\n\nIn fact, he smiles up at Steve. “So glad I didn’t die before I told you I love you.”\n\nSteve doesn’t try to cover the choked sob and leans over, kissing all over Bucky’s face. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” Clint cackles at the display.\n\n“Man, you have no idea how glad I am you’re okay.” Bucky smiles at his best friend then Clint’s face gets serious. “I’m really glad you’re here. I’m gonna get your mom and let everyone know you’re awake.”\n\nBucky looks up at Steve. “My mom?”\n\n“She got in yesterday, with your sisters. They needed to rest, but Winnie came back this morning. She’s down getting coffee.” Steve can’t stop touching Bucky and smiling.\n\n“You flew them in, didn’t you?”\n\n“Yeah, I did. I’ll do anything you need, Buck. I love you.” Bucky mouths ‘I love you too,’ then turns to the door when Winifred Barnes comes through, followed by Clint.\n\nShe’s at his bedside, crying and kissing his forehead. “I’m so glad to see you awake.”\n\n“Hi, Mom.”\n\nSteve sits on the edge of the bed, watching as Bucky looks over where his left arm used to be. Taking Bucky’s right hand again, Steve kisses it. “I know that at some point you’re going to be off the pain meds and probably going to be mad at the world, but you hafta know that you losing an arm doesn’t change anything.”\n\nIn his drug induced state, he grins up at Steve. “You still going to spoil me, Stevie.” Steve leans in, kissing him again. “And anyway, I built an arm. I’ll just be the guinea pig for the trial.”\n\nSteve barks a laugh as Bucky fades back into sleep.\n\nIt’s two weeks later and Helen has decided to discharge Bucky into Steve’s care. There’s a visiting nurse that will come every two days to make sure he’s healing well and taking his meds properly. Bucky will be healing for weeks to come, maybe months and he’s still on pain meds, but he’s aware enough to realize that they aren’t headed home. His ma sits in the back of the car with them and smiles at his confusion. “Uh, Steve, where are we going?”\n\nSteve kisses his temple. “We’re going home.”\n\nClint grins even wider. “Yeah buddy, we’re living the high life now.”\n\n“Steve?” Clint leans into Winnie’s side. Bucky looks up confused. Steve reaches over, caressing his cheek.\n\n“Okay…don’t get mad, but when all this happened, I sorta had you and Clint’s stuff moved into my apartment. I have more than enough room and Clint’s already gotten everything put away.” He tries one last thing to settle any argument that Bucky might have. “And your ma thinks it’s a great idea.”\n\n“Really Steve? Bringing my mother into this?” Steve grins sheepishly.\n\n“It’s worth a shot.”\n\n“Do you really want me living with you?” Bucky searches his face.\n\n“I think it’s really important to live with someone before you marry them. You know, testing the waters and everything.” Bucky’s eyes bug out and Winnie and Clint just laugh.\n\nCarrying Bucky through the door, Steve can’t help laughing because Winnie is behind him. “This better not be the only time you carry my son over the threshold, Steven.”\n\nBecca and Emma who were in the kitchen fixing food for lunch, come running into the room, hugging and kissing Bucky. Steve carefully sits Bucky down. He hugs his sisters, but Steve sees a look cross his face, then quickly covers it. After eating, Steve insists that Bucky needs to rest, so he sweeps him into his arms and carries Bucky upstairs. Once in the bedroom, where it’s quiet, he caresses Bucky’s cheek.\n\n“What happened earlier?” Bucky turns his face away from Steve, staring at the window with tears in his eyes. “No matter what you say, I’m going to love you forever.”\n\nThe sob that comes out sounds like it’s ripped from the very depths of Bucky’s soul. The words that come out are broken. “When I hugged them, it felt like my arm was still there.”\n\nSteve shuffles into the bed, pulling Bucky against him. They don’t talk for a long time. Steve doesn’t know what to say; he’s never been in this position before. Finally, breaking the silence, Steve offers, “I’ll never understand how you’re feeling, Bucky. I’ll try, but I’ll never fully understand what you’re going through. All I can say is we’ll get through it together because there’s no other way for us to be, except together.”\n\nBucky doesn’t respond, but does cuddle closer, tears dampening Steve’s shirt. Winnie finds them later, easing the door open to check on her boy. Clint leans on the door frame, holding in tears of his own. Once back downstairs, he hugs Bucky’s mom. “He’s the last person that deserved this.”\n\nWinnie pulls Clint’s face from her neck, staring into his eyes with determination. “We don’t get to pick the bumps that come along in our lives, Clinton. We just have to learn to navigate them when they do.”\n\n“Winnie, this isn’t a bump.” She kisses his forehead, then pulls him into a hug.\n\n“That’s what this is unless we make a big deal out of it. If we fall into that trap, then Bucky will spiral into his own head. We have to be more determined than he thinks he can be. We have to guide him through this by example.” Nodding into her shoulder, Clint gives a deep sniffle.\n\n“I’ll do anything he needs me to.” Patting his shoulders, Winnie grins.\n\n“Good man.”\n\nA few days later, Bucky wakes to a deep throbbing in the stump on his left side. He doesn’t want to take pain medication because he’s tired of feeling fuzzy all the time. Leaving Steve to sleep a little longer, Bucky heads into the bathroom. He’s supposed to cover the bandages to shower. Looking down at the plastic and tape, he realizes that he can’t do it on his own. Taking a breath, he stares at the bag, then blows out the breath.\n\nIn that moment, Bucky understands his new normal.\n\nSinking to the floor, sobs wrack his body for the independence that he’s lost. How long he cries is unknown and until Steve sits next to him, pulling him into strong arms, Bucky wishes to go back, to never walk out of the apartment to think about his project. Steve doesn’t speak, he just holds the man he loves and lets him cry. Once the tears are dried up, Steve gets up, pulling Bucky with him, grabs the bag and tape.\n\n“How long are you going to be willing to do this kind of thing for me, Steve?” Steve huffs a mirthless chuckle.\n\n“As long as I live.” When the bag is in place, Steve helps Bucky out of his clothes, then strips himself. Starting the shower, he drags Bucky in with him and starts wetting his hair to help Bucky wash. “I know you don’t believe me, you think I’m going to get tired of you, but there’s nothing more important than you.”\n\n“You have a business to run. You can’t be here with a cripple all the time.” Bucky’s looking for a fight, which is obvious from his raised voice.\n\nBracing his hands on Bucky’s face, Steve forces him to look into his eyes. “Watch me! You went out that night to clear your head! This is unfair, it’s awful; it was a horrible accident. Until the day I die, I will be so thankful that all you lost was an arm. You could have died, Bucky! Do you understand that? You could have died that day! I’m thankful every single day that I’m not going to your funeral.” Steve cries, trying to make this man understand that it could have been so much worse. “You’re here. That’s all that matters to me and after a while, when you’re healed, if you want to be a guinea pig and attach that arm, I’ll support that too. If you choose not to, I’ll love you just as much because I could be standing in this shower alone and instead, I get to have you here.”\n\nClosing his eyes, Bucky lets the words wash over him like the water soothing his back. “Why do you love me? I’m a mess.”\n\nSteve chuckles. “I love you because you’re my baby boy.”\n\nThere’s silence, then Bucky looks into blue eyes. “I’m not sure how I feel about that anymore.”\n\nSteve gives a shrug, thinking that Bucky’s trying to get Steve to leave him. “Then you’ll be my baby, and we’ll leave that other stuff alone.”\n\n“I’m not getting rid of you, am I?” Steve laughs outright at that, making Bucky smile.\n\n“Not on your life.”\n\nIt’s been four months. Winnie and the girls went home to Indiana, leaving Bucky in the capable hands of Steve and Clint. The healing process has been slow and there are days when Bucky wants to give up and wallow. Sometimes, Steve lets him and sometimes, he insists that Bucky get up and do something. They’ve been shopping, they’ve been to the park for picnics, they’ve been to Coney Island. Bucky’s therapist is impressed with Steve’s determination to keep Bucky grounded.\n\nTonight's distraction is dinner with the people that have become important in Bucky’s recovery. Slowly, Bucky’s been working on the project, trying to see things from a different perspective. Tony goes to the university and retrieves all of Bucky’s work and prototype. They sit in the living room, talking about an idea that Bucky had a few days prior. Rosy is sitting in Bucky’s lap, grinning at the two men talking.\n\nThe balcony is set up with string lights and candles, while everyone else is in the kitchen helping Steve get dinner ready. Pepper checks on the two in the living room, then comes back to the kitchen, pulling Steve into a hug. “You’ve helped him so much. He could have lost himself in all this and you didn’t let that happen.”\n\nSteve’s surprised by her affection, but accepts it. “I couldn’t lose him. I’m just thankful for Sam and Nat being willing to pick up the slack at work.”\n\nClint’s leaning into Natalia’s side, head rested on her shoulder. “We’ll do anything you need, so you can be here with him.” Bucky barks with laughter in the other room and Steve looks over, smiling softly. “Plus, we like seeing that look on your face, Steve.”\n\nHe turns back to his friends. “He’s been telling me that I need to get back to work. I think I’m going to start working on a few accounts from here.”\n\nSam reaches over, squeezing Steve’s shoulder. “You do whatever you think is best.”\n\nMaria comes in from the balcony. “We might want to turn one of the heaters on out there. It’s getting a little chilly.”\n\nBy the time they all sit down to eat dinner, Steve’s sure that taking this time was the right thing, but Bucky’s right, he has to get back to his job. Tony offers the lab at Stark Tower for Bucky to do his work. “I can send a car for you, and it can have you home by dinner.”\n\nBucky looks around the table. In the light of the candles, he blushes. Taking a deep breath, he stands, holding up his glass. “I’d like to make a toast to all of you.” They raise their glasses. “When Steve and I found each other, I didn’t know that I was going to gain such amazing people. Thank you for everything you’ve done and are still trying to do for me.” He looks over at Steve, blushing again. “Thank you for being the love of my life and putting up with my bullshit.”\n\nClint snorts, while everyone else laughs. Standing, Steve leans in, kissing Bucky. “You’ve handled this whole thing with more grace than I ever would have.” Steve looks Bucky over, taking in everything that makes up this unique man. “I would have found you even in the darkest night. You’re the light that calls me home.”\n\nNine months after the accident, Bucky’s lying on a table on the medical floor of Stark Tower. The schematics are up on the screen and the doctor’s job is to follow the instructions and attach the base for the arm. The surgery is going to take hours, but when he looks up into the gallery, Steve and Clint are watching. He knows they won’t leave until this procedure is over.\n\nDr. Cho comes in, mask in place and hands held up for the nurse to put the gloves on. “Are you sure about this, Bucky?”\n\nHe tears his eyes from Steve’s worried ones and looks into Helen’s. “Yeah, I’m sure.”\n\nShe nods at the rest of the staff. “Okay, let’s put him under.” Looking back down, she smiles behind the mask. “We’ll see you on the other side.”\n\nSteve paces for the first few hours. When he sits, Clint gets up and paces. Tony and Pepper come in around lunch, bring something for the two men to eat. Steve doesn’t think he can hold anything down, but does try. Clint doesn’t seem to have an issue. Texts from Sam, Nat, and Maria filter in during the day and even Dave checks in. By hour eleven, Steve’s going crazy with worry that something’s gone wrong. Nothing seems amiss, so he has to trust that it’s just taking this long.\n\nAt nearly thirteen hours, the door to the gallery opens and Tony comes back in. “She’s almost done, and we’ll know if this is going to work or not.”\n\nSteve’s nearly frantic. “How will we know?”\n\nTony smirks. “You really have no idea how smart this kid is, do you, Steve?”\n\nDr. Cho looks up at the gallery. “We’re ready down here, Mr. Stark.”\n\nTony presses a button on the wall. “JARVIS, bring it online.” The screens around the perimeter of the operating room light up. They show Bucky’s vitals, which are good. One shows the base, attached to the stump on Bucky’s left side. After a few seconds, the base lights up on the screen and Tony pulls his glasses from his face. Wiping his eyes, Tony looks over at Steve. “The kid did it.”\n\nSteve’s staring at the screens, then back down to Bucky, who’s still unconscious. “I don’t understand.”\n\nDr. Cho’s voice breaks in before Tony can say anything else. “We’re going to move him into recovery.”\n\nTony takes Steve’s arm, pulling him down the hallway. Clint follows behind, listening to what the billionaire is saying. “The base isn’t just to hold the arm in place, Steve. The base collects the natural electrical impulses from the body and holds that charge. When the arm is attached, that collected charge will make the arm function using the nervous system.” Steve’s not really sure he understands. Tony can see that and tries a different approach. “Okay, think about it this way.” Tony waves his arm around. “I can do that because my body has natural electricity running through my nervous system. My brain is telling my arm to move. That base collects that charge.” Steve nods, understanding that. “But to get the arm to work, it takes more than just that charge, it takes the nervous system working like his flesh arm is still there. That base has been hardwired into Bucky’s body, it’s why the surgery took so long. Now, that base is collecting electrical impulses it can give the arm power, but it’s also hardwired in, so Bucky’s going to be able to move the arm as though it were flesh and blood.”\n\nWhen they reach the recovery room, Steve stands, staring at Tony. “My boyfriend is a genius.”\n\nTony laughs. “Yeah, he is, and this thing is going to revolutionize prosthetics. He’s going to be a rich genius.”\n\nFor the next two months, Bucky’s body adjusted to the base. “Buck, what is it that you’re waiting for with the base?”\n\nSteve spent the day at the office, then came home about four, bringing food for Bucky and Clint. He’d forgotten that Clint was working, so the extra food went into the fridge. Bucky looks up from his tablet, giving a lazy smile to Steve. The question isn’t meant in any other way than curiosity. Leveraging on the back of the sofa, Bucky turns, facing his boyfriend. “When Dr. Cho amputated the arm, the damage causes a disruption in the normal afferent and efferent signals with the missing limb.” Steve cocks an eyebrow in confusion, causing Bucky to chuckle. “Basically, Steve, we have to wait for the nerves to recognize the base.”\n\nSitting next to Bucky, Steve brushes his hair away from his face, caressing Bucky’s cheek. “You are the smartest person I know and every time you talk to me about these things, it just cements that I’ll never understand the world you work in.” When Bucky tries to respond, Steve leans in, kissing him. “It’s really hot.”\n\nBucky’s nose scrunches up when he smiles. “You’re turned on by my intellect?”\n\nSteve kisses Bucky’s nose. “I’m turned on by all of you.” He starts to get up and leave Bucky to work, but is pulled down again.\n\n“It’s been almost a year, Steve, and in that time, you haven’t pushed me to...to...” There’s a deep blush on Bucky’s cheeks.\n\n“I haven’t pushed because you’re healing. I’ll wait.” Pulling Steve in, Bucky kisses him deeply and probingly. When Bucky leans away, Steve has to take a couple of deep breaths to gain his composure. “You kiss me like that again and I’m libel to pick you up and carry you upstairs.”\n\nBurying his hand in Steve’s hair, he pulls him in again. This kiss is all teeth and tongue. “That a promise?” Then he winks at Steve. “Daddy.”\n\nThere’s a growl, then Bucky’s being heaved into Steve’s arms. “Baby, I hope you were done working because I’m gonna pound you into the mattress until you can’t walk.” Bucky giggles all the way up the stairs.\n\nBecause of Tony, the university allows Bucky to forego the usual classes and present his paper. He turns it into the panel, waits a week, then one of Tony’s cars takes him to campus for his defense. He’s nothing but nerves, straightening his jacket and tugging at the glove over his left hand. When the TA comes out to get him, he’s pacing like a caged animal.\n\nOnce inside, the panel watches him, seeing that he’s nervous, but confident. “Mr. Barnes, why don’t you walk us through your findings.”\n\nBucky talks for over an hour about the need to make a prosthetic that functions better than a place holder. He talks about using the body’s natural electrical pulses a"
