        "text": "(Photo by FX)\n\nRyan Murphy’s TV Series and Films Ranked by Tomatometer\n\nWhat do you do when you’ve conquered the worlds of network and cable TV, won a slew of awards for your efforts, and become one of the few household-name showrunners in the country? Do it all again.\n\nMurphy, who made waves in 2018 with a record-breaking Netflix deal that resulted in series like Ratched and Halston, is also the executive producer in the latest installment of FX’s American Crime Story: Impeachment, which is about the Bill Clinton sex scandal of the 1990s and is created by Sarah Burgess. The new season, at 70% on the Tomatometer (as of September 8, 2021), caused an 8-point drop in the anthology series’ score, moving it lower on our list of Murphy properties.\n\nThe producer, writer, director, and showrunner has been hugely influential in the medium, inspiring a resurgence in TV musicals with his high-school set Fox series Glee, unleashing a flood of anthology projects with FX’s American Horror Story, creating trans awareness with his Emmy-winning FX show Pose, and gathering an informal troupe of fiercely loyal top acting talent, including Sarah Paulson, who portrays Clinton whistle-blower Linda Tripp in the new limited series. He has also been involved with several movies, such as directing Netflix’s film adaptation of the musical The Prom and directing and executive producing the HBO film adaptation of the AIDS crisis play The Normal Heart.\n\nHere’s how Murphy’s movies and series stand so far by Tomatometer score.
