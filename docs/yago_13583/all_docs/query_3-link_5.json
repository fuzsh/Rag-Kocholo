        "text": "A great portrayal of the microcosm of the American high school experience. This is an brilliant film on multiple levels. Both witty and humorous the film presents an adult viewpoint on the teenage experience without being preachy or dumbed-down (like many high school films). The acting is great, the scenes are well-written, and the dialog is spot-on. It takes a little bit to become accustom to the style of the film, but ultimately you become completely engaged with the originality of everything the film has to offer. With the similarities of the truthful awkwardness and sincere characters of Freaks and Geeks (without the clich√©s), High School Record is film that many can relate to and I highly recommend checking it out."
