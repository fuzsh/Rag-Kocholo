        "text": "Palestinians are marginalized across all western media, including cinema. Yet for the past several decades, Palestinian filmmakers have created an extraordinary archive of films documenting their lives under occupation. They have revealed the terror of checkpoints, the trauma of war, and the everyday challenges of living in a territory that is increasingly dominated by armed soldiers.\n\nI introduce here some of the main genres and themes of Palestinian cinema in recent years. Although it is impossible to list all recent Palestinian films of importance, I highlight some of the films that have meant the most to me personally, and which have done the most to open my eyes to what it means to be Palestinian today. All of these films are required viewing for anyone who wants to understand life under Israel’s apartheid system.\n\nEveryday existence\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of contemporary Palestinian cinema is the major contribution made by female directors. Two female filmmakers in particular have made a significant mark on Palestinian cinema: Palestinian-British filmmaker Farah Nabulsi (b. 1978, London) and Annemarie Jacir (b. 1974 in Bethlehem)."
