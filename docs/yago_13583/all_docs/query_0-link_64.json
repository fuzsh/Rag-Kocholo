In March we'll present a live reading for Ai Aida's new play, Deirdre the Queer Queen.\n\nBECOME A MEMBER\n\nThe Kilbanes\n\nLive Performace Presented Digitally\n\nSaturday, July 31, 2021 | 5 PM PST\n\n_TICKETS ON SALE THROUGH 7/30/21\n\nFor our final online cabaret performance of the 2020/2021 Season, Aurora welcomes celebrated Bay Area rock-and-roll band and theatremakers The Kilbanes. Fresh from their remarkable production of Weightless, filmed at Cal Shakes' Bruns stage for WP Theater in New York, the Kilbanes will help us celebrate the end of one more Aurora season and the beginning of the next with their uniquely soaring, catchy, and ecstatic sound.\n\nThe Kilbanes are Kate Kilbane and Dan Moses, a married songwriting and performing duo.

In Smith’s world premiere play, Thomas, a highly regarded public intellectual and author, is brought to the University of California at Berkeley campus to help facilitate conversations concerning extrajudicial police violence. A member of the UCB Black Student Union was violently beaten by an officer while peacefully protesting and the students find themselves rejecting Thomas’ middle-ground, #NotAllCops rhetoric. Miriam and Raz, leaders of the BSU, want immediate action, radical reform, and are sick-and-tired of having to rely on a corrupt system for justice. Nina, the Vice Chancellor of the University, is caught between the demands of the students to shut Thomas down, and loyalty to Thomas, her dearest friend from graduate school.\n\nCleavon Smith is an award-winning playwright who has recently been recognized as a playwright to watch in the San Francisco Bay Area, where he lives. The upcoming premiere of The Flats is his first project with Aurora Theatre Company. As Playwright in Residence at Berkeley’s reputable TheatreFIRST (T1) for the past three years, he has written and produced five new works. T1’s production of his critically acclaimed full-length work, The Last Sermon of Sister Imani was nominated for a 2018 Theatre Bay Area (TBA) Best Production award, and his short play Just One Day was included in T1’s TBA Best Anthology award-winning production Between Us. Also premiering this fall is Affinity, a mini-series of short videos filmed via Zoom and produced by TheatreFIRST. Additionally in 2020 Cleavon has had a multitude of short plays produced and/or read by theatres in Ann Arbor, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose. Cleavon teaches English at Berkeley City College and in the winter will be working on new commissions for the Aurora Theatre Company, Bay Area Children’s Theatre, and Oakland’s renowned Skyline High School Drama Department.\n\nDeirdre the Queer Queen\n\nBy Ai Aida\n\nPresented by The Holy Fools\n\nLIVE reading Saturday, March 20, 2021 | 5 PM PST\n\nHoly Fools is a theatre collective in residence at Laney College under the leadership of Michael Torres. As inspired by Barbara Hammond’s play, We Are Pussy Riot Or Everything Is P.R. our troupe or The Holy Fools, comes from the Orthodox tradition of saints who, in the Russian hymn, strive “with imaginary insanity to reveal the insanity of the world.” We are a diverse group of mostly young Oakland-based artists striving to make our space, honing our craft, creating theatre rooted in our multiethnic, multiracial, cross- economical experiences in the Bay Area.\n\nColonialism is terrible, but pho is delicious\n\nA Virtual Reading\n\nLIVE reading Saturday, February 13, 2021 | 5 PM PST\n\nDustin Chinn’s Colonialism is Terrible, But Pho is Delicious took its inspiration from two viral incidents around cultural appropriation and food. [Chef Tyler Akin did a how-to video for Bon Appetit, \"PSA: This is How You Should Be Eating Pho,\" and Dan Pashman of The Sporkful suggested you could improve bibimbap using a bundt pan.] Chinn says he “followed the rabbit hole” and wrote Colonialism; what he dubs “a triptych about the ownership and authorship of food following the journey of Vietnamese noodle soup.” This dark comedy spans centuries, continents, and cultures in its three-part vignette structure. Beginning in 1880s Hanoi, the capital city of 19th-century French Indochina, where a Vietnamese cook finds herself in the kitchen of aristocratic French settlers. Then 1999, a century later, in Ho Chi Minh City, where American diners get their first taste of the local cuisine. Then finally, a present day, gentrifying Brooklyn, where the simmering argument around culture, ownership, and authenticity come to a roaring boil.\n\nCREATIVE\n\nDustin Chinn (Playwright) is a Seattle native whose plays include Snowflakes, Or Rare White People, I Am Nakamura, The Ensemble Studio Theatre/Sloan Commission Herschel: Portrait Of A Killer and Let’s Ninja Science Ranger Team Get!
