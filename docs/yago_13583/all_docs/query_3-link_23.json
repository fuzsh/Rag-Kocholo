As an activist festival rooted in the foundational belief that art can inspire change, the 2023 Tribeca Festival showcases numerous documentary features that shine a light on the ongoing war in Ukraine as well as the silencing of artists in Iran.\n\nFor the third year, the Tribeca Festival continues its commemoration of Juneteenth through the “Expressions of Black Freedom” program, sponsored by Indeed, which includes a festival-wide celebration of the 50th anniversary of hip-hop, the world premiere of All Up in the Biz, a documentary about New York hip-hop legend Biz Markie, and the world premiere of Cinnamon, directed by Bryian Keith Montgomery Jr. and starring Damon Wayans and Pam Grier.\n\n“The Tribeca Festival is a celebratory event that honors artists and uplifts attendees, and this year is no exception with a lineup of 109 feature films from 127 filmmakers. Over the course of 12 thrilling days, we invite audiences to explore the magic of storytelling as a powerful tool of democracy, activism, and social awareness,” says Tribeca Festival Co-Founder and Tribeca Enterprises CEO Jane Rosenthal. “We’re also proud to highlight the 50th anniversary of hip-hop as a culture-defining genre that originated right here in New York City, with insightful world premieres about beat-boxing legends and live performances from today’s top-charting musicians.”\n\nThe 2023 “Spotlight+” category includes a series of live events that bring the film experience to life following each premiere. A performance from She Is The Music artists, curated by Alicia Keys, will follow the world premiere of Uncharted; Sara Bareilles will give a special performance following the world premiere of Waitress, the Musical - Live on Broadway!; the one and only Gloria Gaynor will perform following the world premiere of Gloria Gaynor: I Will Survive; a conversation with Peabody Award-winning news anchor Dan Rather and director Frank Marshall will follow the world premiere of Rather; Gogol Bordello will perform following the world premiere of Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story; a songwriting masterclass by Indigo Girls will follow the New York premiere of It’s Only Life After All; a musical Q&A with Marc Rebillet will follow the world premiere of Songs About Fucking; and a group of dancehall legends will perform following the world premiere of Bad Like Brooklyn Dancehall.\n\n“This year's slate of films is a joyful celebration of everything we love about the big screen experience,” says Tribeca Festival Director and VP of Programming Cara Cusamano. “We are bringing to New York eye-popping 3D films and rousing music docs, white-knuckle thrillers and knee-slapping comedies, independent edge and old Hollywood glamour. And as potent as the work is on-screen, we are equally excited to ‘plus up’ the moviegoing experience off-screen with an incredible lineup of live experiences in ‘Spotlight+’.”\n\nThe Tribeca Festival is expanding its “Midnight” offering with the introduction of “Escape from Tribeca,” a psychotronic sidebar presenting genre movies from across the globe, including the world premiere of India’s big-budgeted visual feast Adipurush, directed by Om Raut and starring Prabhas and Kriti Sanon. Festival-goers are also invited to a 50th anniversary screening of the global phenomenon Enter the Dragon followed by a talk with co-star Angela Mao and producer Andre Morgan about superstar performer and choreographer Bruce Lee and the production of the film.\n\nThe Tribeca Festival is also proud to announce that the second annual Human/Nature Award, a prize established to amplify a film that best exemplifies solution-oriented environmental storytelling, goes to Common Ground, directed by Rebecca and Josh Tickell, and will world premiere at the Festival.\n\nOnce again, movie fans can enjoy selections from the Tribeca Festival from the comfort of their homes immediately following the Festival, from June 19 through July 2, via the “Tribeca at Home” online platform: Tribecafilm.com.\n\nThe Tribeca Festival is curated by Festival Director and VP of Programming Cara Cusumano, Artistic Director Frédéric Boyer; VP of Programming Sharon Badal and VP of Shorts Programming Ben Thompson; Senior Programmers Liza Domnitz, Faridah Gbadamosi, and Jarod Neece; Programmers José F.
