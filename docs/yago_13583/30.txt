Mexican-American actress Eva Longoria directed the movie Flamin’ Hot, and personally tapped Mexican-American singer Becky G to perform its theme song, “The Fire Inside.” Becky sang the Best Original Song nominee on the Oscars stage March 10.

The movie is based on the memoir of Richard MontaÃ±ez, who claims to have invented the popular snack Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.

Wearing a black bikini top with a long tulle cape attached, black trousers and a huge diamond necklace, Becky performed in front of a round screen showing flames, while the orchestra performed one level above her on the stage. She was joined by a choir of young girls from Inglewood, California.

The song was written by 15-time Best Original Song nominee Diane Warren, who has won a special achievement Oscar, but has yet to win a competitive statuette.
