        "text": "A horrifying dream was all it took for Timbaland to get his life in order.\n\nThe Grammy-winning producer — known for his work with Missy Elliott, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Madonna and several others — dropped 130 pounds after having a frightening nightmare just after learning he developed prediabetes.\n\n“I had a dream that death was near. I saw myself with a white face,” Timbaland, who’s real name is Timothy Mosley, confessed to Men’s Health.\n\nThe 47-year-old admittedly packed on the pounds due to unhealthy eating habits. The songwriter also became addicted to OxyContin and Percocet after taking the prescription pills for root canal pain in 2011. Other stressors — such as his messy divorce and an IRS investigation into his taxes — contributed to his unhealthy lifestyle.\n\n“[The pills] put me in a great feeling of not caring, of just being free. I’m like traveling, doing shows, poppin’ ’em, having fun, just being ignorant,” he said.\n\nAt his heaviest, the 5-foot-7 beatsmith weighed-in at 350 pounds. After moving into a smaller Miami condo, straightening out his divorce and settling his debt with Uncle Sam, Mosley decided to take his health seriously for the first time in years.\n\nWith the support of his children and girlfriend — Punch Elite Fitness gym founder Michelle Dennis — the musician dropped 50 pounds after one year of training."
