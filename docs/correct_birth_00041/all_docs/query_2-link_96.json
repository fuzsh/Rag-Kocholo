        "text": "Timbaland’s new album is about to sound like some American Idol s**t.\n\nTimbaland is a legendary producer who helped mold the careers of artists such as Missy Elliott, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado, and more. Recently, he dropped a new single with Anna Margo called “My Way,” proving to the world that he is still more than capable of making fire-ass beats. This past weekend, Timbo returned to the music scene with a new single called “Desire” with Vita.\n\n“Desire” is an electrifying song designed to swiftly lure people to the dancefloor. Fueled by a powerful beat with an unconventional tempo and action-packed vibes, the track features Vita delivering a vocal performance reminiscent of Rihanna—smooth and effortless. Timbaland’s robotic adlibs are interspersed throughout, adding a touch of old-school vibes that truly enhance the overall experience.\n\nTimbaland will be releasing a new album called Textbook Timbo soon. It will be his first since 2009. In the meantime, check out “Desire” from it."
