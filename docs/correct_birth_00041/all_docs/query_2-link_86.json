        "text": "In a musical reunion that’s been long-awaited, legendary producer Timbaland is back with a bang on his latest single, “Keep Going Up,” featuring the dynamic talents of Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake. This track not only marks Timbaland’s triumphant return but also serves as his debut as an artist under the partnership between his Mosley Music Group and Def Jam Recordings.\n\nFans will remember this iconic trio from their 2007 hit, “Give It To Me,” which skyrocketed to #1 on the Billboard 200 and has since amassed nearly a billion streams. The track was a pivotal part of Timbaland’s platinum-certified full-length album, Shock Value, which dominated the Top 5 of the Billboard 200.\n\n“Keep Going Up” showcases Timbaland’s signature sound, with a head-nodding drum groove and a thick bassline laying the foundation for dynamic verses by Nelly Furtado. Justin Timberlake adds his hypnotic high-register vocals, weaving seamlessly into the rich layers of production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe origins of this musical gem trace back to Timbaland’s Beatclub, a thriving music creator platform. Collaborating with Beatclub members Last Trip to the Moon, Timbaland found his inspiration. After a session with production team members Brandon Stewart and Brandon Cordoba, who created the beat, Timbaland was ignited with creative energy. With his signature production style, he brought together Timberlake and Furtado as featured vocalists.\n\nYou can hear the new single below."
