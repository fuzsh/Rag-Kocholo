According to his posts on Instagram, the track is being titled ‘Keep Going Up’ and will be released this Friday (September 1).\n\nIn the clip above, Timbaland and Justin Timberlake play the track’s final cut for Nelly Furtado. Timberlake also describes Furtado’s vocals on the track as a mix of ‘Promiscuous’ and ‘Say It Right’ in one track. The clip also includes a snippet of the track’s chorus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n‘Keep Going Up’ will mark the first time the trio have released a song together since 2007’s smash hit ‘Give It To Me’. Prior to that, Timbaland had worked with Furtado and Justin Timberlake extensively on separate occasions.\n\nEarlier this year, Timbaland confirmed that his longtime collaborator Timberlake has finished his next album.\n\nRecommended\n\nEarlier this month, Timbaland paid tribute to his longtime collaborator and rapper Magoo, who died at 50. Magoo was best known for being one half of the Timbaland & Magoo duo, which formed in 1989. The pair met as teenagers and released their debut album ‘Welcome To Our World’ in 1997, spawning the hit ‘Up Jumps Da Boogie’."
