        "text": "Multi-platinum, Grammy Award-Winning Producer, Artist, Author & Entrepreneur Multi-platinum, Grammy award-winning, super-producer, and artist, Timbaland is one of the greatest minds in music history. With more top-ten hits than Elvis Presley or the Beatles, he has taught the world to “say it with sound.” Dubbed the Emperor of Sound and ranked #3 by Billboard on a list of 50 of the greatest producers of the 21st century.\n\nTimbaland’ the musical mastermind is behind the most memorable hits of our times. With over 18-Grammy nominations, 4-Grammy wins and 200+ ASCAP Music awards, his indelible imprint has been stamped on countless hits from some of the most successful and legendary artists in the world. From Jay-Z’s “Dirt Off Your Shoulder” and “Big Pimpin,” to Justin Timberlake’s “Sexy Back” and “Cry Me A River,” Aaliyah’s “One In A Million,” Missy Elliott’s “Get Ur Freak On” and “Work It,” Ginuwine’s “Pony,” and One Republic’s “Apologize” amongst many others, Timbaland’s credits have established him as one of the most iconic producers in the last 30 years.\n\nAmong his long list of accolades are hits he’s produced for artists including Kanye West, Bryson Tiller, Madonna, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Mariah Carey, Rihanna, Sam Smith, Maluma, Nelly Furtado, Keri Hilson, Brad Paisley, Coldplay, Nickelback, The Fray, Destiny’s Child, Ludacris, Jodeci, Snoop Dogg, Drake, Alicia Keys and countless others.\n\nIn the 1990s, his partnership with high school friend Missy Elliott blossomed into a pairing that delivered legendary R&B singer Aaliyah’s double-platinum sophomore album, One in A Million, which went on to sell over 15-million copies worldwide. Becoming one of music’s most successful production/songwriting teams, as a result, Elliott naturally looked to Timbaland to help define her as an artist. Their work together, which included tracks such as “The Rain,” catapulted Elliott to major stardom and critical acclaim.\n\nTimbaland’s collaboration with Justin Timberlake went on to become one of the most successful and iconic partnerships in music, producing the 2006 mega-hit “Sexy Back” which sold over 6-million copies and became Timberlake’s first #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100. Together, the two went on to have a tremendous amount of success, selling over 30-million albums worldwide with multiple #1 hits including “Cry Me A River,” “My Love,” “What Goes Around Comes Around,” “4 Minutes,” “Give It to Me,” “Suit and Tie,” “Mirrors,” and more.\n\nBorn Timothy Z. Mosley in Norfolk, Virginia March 10, 1972, Timbaland, so named by Jodeci member Devante Swing after the Timberland boot, has had many reincarnations–from disc jockey DJ Tiny Tim, to half of the hip-hop group Timbaland & Magoo, from membership in Devante Swing’s Swing Mob crew known as Da Bassment, to S.B.I. (Surrounded By Idiots), a production ensemble including Pharrell Williams, to being CEO of his own label, Mosley Music Group.\n\nIn 2006 he founded a new label appropriately called Mosley Music. Mosley debuted with Nelly Furtado’s “Promiscuous,” featuring Timbaland which hit #1, as did her album which sold over 15 million copies. Mosley Music has since sold over 40 million albums and over 50 million singles with global success from releases including Nelly Furtado, Bubba Sparks, One Republic, Chris Cornell, Keri Hilson and several others including Timbaland’s own solo releases.\n\nTimbaland has released two books, a biography aptly titled The Emperor of Sound, and his children’s book Nighttime Symphony.\n\nTimbaland is the co-founder of the music tech platform Beatclub, which he created with long time music manager Gary Marella. Beatclub is a music creator platform that offers all of the tools, resources, community, mentorship, education, placement opportunities and more in a centralized creator hub which has attracted artists, producers and songwriters at all levels from the emerging bedroom producer and artist, to Grammy Award-winning creators.\n\nBeatclub’s mission is to support and empower music creators by providing the necessary tools, access, education and monetization opportunities to be successful, all in one subscription. Timbaland is also the co-creator of pandemic phenomenon Verzuz with music producer Swizz Beats."
