        "text": "Jay-Z, photographed as he arrived at DJ’s Music & Videos on Tidewater Drive in Norfolk, Virginia by Portlock Rogers in October 1998.\n\nJigga was in Timbaland’s hometown to promote his third studio album Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life; the rapper and producer had began their fruitful relationship on that album with the fourth single “Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)” and the Foxy Brown-featuring “Paper Chase.” The appearance of one of New York’s hottest rappers for a signing session brought out hundreds of people to the store, causing a large commotion in the street and stopping traffic. The police department had to send officers over to clear the crowd and restore the flow.\n\nJay-Z was a big fan of Norfolk and the neighboring Virginia Beach, and he had been traveling down there since he was a teenager for both legal and illegal reasons (“Used to dribble down in VA,” “My tenure took me through Virginia”). VA was like a second home to him; after the passing of Danny Dan he and his business associates had moved into the state and made a lot of money peddling their wares. Whenever Jay was in town he had a connect in Richmond who would send down a fleet of luxury vehicles for he and his team to use during their stay.\n\nThe month before this photograph was taken he and the Roc-A-Fella Records family had spent Labor Day Weekend there. On September 5th he had been present for the Norfolk State vs. Virginia State Labor Day Classic football game, where he was mobbed by thousands of fans and had to be rushed out by heavy security. Journalist dream hampton was with him that day and during the commotion she lost a shoe. He had performed at the HBU’s Homecoming concert in 1996.\n\nJigga’s other festivities that year included headlining the Labor Day concert with DMX, Memphis Bleek and Amil’s group Major Coins at the Hampton Convention Center, and partying aboard the double-decked tour boat that Timbaland had rented to cruise on the East Atlantic Ocean off Virginia Beach. During the party his hit single “Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)” was on repeat as the Roc-A-Fella crew poured themselves seemingly limitless amounts of Cristal champagne and shots of cognac (with Jay also drinking his favored rum punch); and later when “Money Ain’t a Thang” came over the speakers Jay and his man from Richmond threw Benjamins ($100 bills) from their table on the top deck down to the VSU students dancing on the lower deck."
