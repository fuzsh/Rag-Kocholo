Timbaland took interest in music during his -teenage. While still in secondary school, he used to play in a band called ‘surrounded By Idiots’ with rapper Magoo and Pharrell Williams, who later helped to establish ‘The Neptunes’.

While he was working on the collection, “The Show, the After Party, the Hotel” he was named Timbaland.\n\nIn 1996, not long after Timbaland began spreading out, he stumbled upon the opportunity of a lifetime as a producer with Ginuwine’s debut collection “Ginuwine..the Bachelor” and Aaliyah’s second album “One out of many”.

The name quickly struck instant gold with Nelly Furtado’s popular album “Loose”, and Timbaland got to produce Justin Timberlake’s second independent collection “Future Sex/Love Sounds”. The two of them worked together again for two “20/20 Experience albums”, both delivered in 2013. Up to this point, he has won 4 Grammy Awards in R&B and dance categories.\n\nTimbaland Popular Video\n\nTimbaland Family, Relatives and Other Relations\n\nTimbaland’s parents’ names were Garland Mosley and Latrice Mosley.
