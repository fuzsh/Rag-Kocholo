        "text": "Timbaland is definitely a pro, even though the competition is fierce with many young talents emerging.\n\nAll of a sudden everyone wanted to work with the hottest producer in town. Fabolous (Def Jam) demanded that he help with the Make Me Better single. Frontman Kele Okereke (Bloc Party) really needed his help, even Madonna trusted him.\n\nHis second solo album Timbaland Presents Shock Value was released on April 3, 2007. It peaked at number 5 on the Billboard 200, selling 138 copies in its first week. It was his highest charting achievement of his entire solo career.\n\nThe same thing happened with his first single Give It Me with singer Nelly Furtado and Justin Timberlake. He received 148 thousand digital downloads and hit the Billboard 100. He has always been, is and will be a sought-after artist.\n\nCarier start Timbaland\n\nTimbaland didn't become creatively wise spontaneously. He has been in the music business for a very long time, so he has already managed to get to know every corner.\n\nHis journey into the music industry began in the early 1990s when he met two people who have been by his side throughout his career.\n\nHis hometown of Norfolk, Virginia paired the producer, born March 10, 1971, with Melissa Arnett Elliott (Missy Elliott) and Melvin Barcliffe (Magoo). He was indebted to the first person for “faith in him,” and to the second for reliable communication.\n\nHis real name is Timothy Mosley. All three guys lived in the same area. They later became friends knowing that they share the same interest. And they began to develop in the same direction.\n\nMosley first shaped his talent by making sounds on Casio keyboards. He recognized himself as a DJ, but his career was only limited to his hometown.\n\nMissy Elliott began her career by forming the R&B group Sista in the late 1980s. She entrusted Mosley to become the group's producer and began creating demos for the musicians.\n\nThe collaboration resulted in an agreement between Sista and record producer DeVante Swing. The group was required to move to New York. Missy Elliott did not leave Mosley, and together they began their path to success.\n\nFrom Timmy to Timbaland\n\nIn the big city, Mosley was signed to Swing Mob, the same label that accepted Missy Elliott. His name was changed to Timbaland for commercial purposes and he started working for DeVante.\n\nUnder the wing of the label, Timbaland had the best experience interacting with other musicians such as Ginuwine, Sugah, Tweet, Playa and Pharrell Williams.\n\nThese parties were later combined into several collaborations and are known as the Da Bassement collective. In 1995, the group began to gradually disintegrate.\n\nEach of them started their own individual projects, but some of them were still together. Those remaining members were: Elliott, Timbaland, Magoo, Playa and Ginuwine.\n\nTimbaland kept his talent alive by playing music for 702 and Ginuwine. His work became the first recognizable song of Steelo (written by Missy Elliott). He became successful thanks to the single Pony. Along with Ginuwine, he created a single that ruled the US R&B chart and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both of them achieved stardom, Ginuwine is a breakthrough artist and Timbaland is a notable hit maker.\n\nTimbaland and Magoo\n\nHis name soon passed to Aaliyah, who immediately asked him to collaborate on One in a Million. Like his work with Ginuwine, Timbaland ranked this project #1 in the game.\n\nIt paid off when One in a Million was certified double platinum within a year. Timbaland then devoted some time to his band with Barcliff named Timbaland and Magoo.\n\nTimbaland's baritone is unusual. But Magu's natural high-pitched voice is the perfect match for stuffy hip-hop music. Their first album was released in 1997 under the title Welcome to Our World. Guest artists participated in the recording. For example, such as Missy Elliott, Aliyah, Playa and Ginuwine, etc.\n\nIn general, this album had several successful singles, thanks to which it became \"platinum\". The duo took a break and then recorded two more albums. Indecent Proposal (2001) and Under Construction, Pt. II (2003), unfortunately, did not make the debut album a success.\n\nExpanding horizons\n\nIn 1998, the singer tried to continue his solo career with the release of Tim's Bio. By 2000, Timbaland had climbed the ladder of achievement as a producer thanks to the successful commercial albums of Missy Elliott.\n\nBut the most commercially successful album was Jay-Z Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life. As well as the release of a new star - Petey Pablo. His range however was not limited to hip hop artists.\n\nAs more people became aware of his work, Timbaland got involved in music such as Limp Bizkit and alternative rock Beck.\n\nIn 2001, Timbaland expanded its territory by setting Beat Club records. The first artist to sign and release an album under this label was rapper Bubba Sparxxx.\n\nThe following year, Timbaland became more solid when he co-produced Justin Timberlake's Justified with The Neptunes.\n\nJustin needed a record that wouldn't jeopardize his career. Justified marked Justin's credibility as a solo artist, selling 7 million copies worldwide.\n\nBy that time, everyone already knew about Timbaland. His unique combination of conventional hip-hop sound with oriental instruments was perceived as a spark of genius.\n\nHe went on to release commercially successful singles for artists such as Xzibit, LL Cool J, Fat Man Scoop, Jennifer Lopez. And even the Japanese singer Utada Hikaru. During 2003-2005 he worked with more famous artists, his name was not very popular.\n\nMore than just an artist\n\nIn 2006, he exhibited two of his famous works, which received more resounding reviews than before. Starting with Nelly Furtado Loose, he released hits like Promiscuous and Say It Right. Both were chart singles that stayed on the list for a very long time.\n\nAt this time, Timbaland started making videos, and just got to the time when he was considered a popular singer. He then took an even bigger hit with Justin Timberlake's second album, Future Sex / Love Sounds, which became successful with the song Sexy Back.\n\nHis career was long, which allowed him to make friends with many musicians. He earned their respect for the fact that many wanted or even had the honor to work with him. The second solo album Timbaland Presents: Shock Value went platinum. Timbaland just wasn't into hip-hop and R&B.\n\nHe has explored a range of musical genres through collaborations with The Hives, She Wants Revenge, Fall Out Boy and Elton John. At the height of his career, he constantly thought of one thing: \"You can do anything you want if you remain persistent and disciplined,\" he said.\n\nTimbaland does not talk about his personal life. He was secretly engaged to his girlfriend Monica Idlett, whom he dated for two years. The couple has a daughter."
