        "text": "World-class oysters and the rugged Appalachian mountains are just a couple of things that Virginia features. The land was also home to the Roanoke colony, the first colony that the English established in what would become the United States. As a result, Virginia has a deep history; its state capital Richmond served as the capital for the Confederacy in the Civil War and four of the first five presidents were born in Virginia.\n\nVirginia isn’t only for lovers; a host of talented musicians also come from the state. It is no surprise that the state so rich in history is the birthplace of numerous talented musicians.\n\n1. Jason Mraz\n\nThe American songwriter, guitarist, and singer Jason Mraz was born in Mechanicsville, Virginia has enjoyed a large amount of success from even the early stages in his career.\n\nHis first album was a delightful mixture of folk-pop, jazz, and country, and featured the single “The Remedy (I Won’t Worry)” which went number one in multiple countries.\n\nMraz’s third studio album received multiple Grammy nominations including Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, a category he won in 2010.\n\nMraz uses his platform and fame to champion several philanthropic causes raising awareness for climate change and child trafficking.\n\n2. Wayne Newton\n\nKnown affectionately as Mr. Las Vegas despite being born in Norfolk, Virginia, vocalist, guitarist and pianist Wayne Newton swayed onto the music scene in the 1960s with the Newton Brothers.\n\nMovie buffs might know Newton’s song “Danke Schoen” from cult classic film Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.\n\nWayne Newton is known for his showmanship, unique voice, and charismatic personality.\n\nThe multi-talented musician plays guitar, steel guitar, and piano and has starred in thousands of Las Vegas shows.\n\nWhen not performing music, Newton dabbles in acting too having appeared in dozens of film and television productions.\n\n3. Ella Fitzgerald\n\nIt takes a big voice to receive the title of the Queen of Jazz. Singer Ella Fitzgerald, hailing from Newport News, Va, had a larger-than-life voice that ranged an impressive three octaves.\n\nFitzgerald first burst onto the scene in the 30s at a Harlem theater, and she quickly took over the charts, co-writing “A-Tisket, A-Tasket.”\n\nHer impressive career constantly transformed, and in the ’40s, Fitzgerald began incorporating scat singing in her performances.\n\nShe is easily one of the greatest singers of all time and has left a huge mark on the jazz world.\n\n4. Bruce Hornsby\n\nWith influences from folk-rock, jazz, and bluegrass music, singer and pianist Bruce Hornsby, born in Williamsburg, Virginia, is a powerhouse in the music world.\n\nHis song, “The Way it Is” is featured in 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, and Mase songs; the song is an ode to the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nHornsby is a talented pianist and vocalist who has performed with Grateful Dead and The Noisemakers.\n\nHe’s been nominated for multiple Grammy Awards and won Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1994.\n\n5. Patsy Cline\n\nBefore her untimely death in a plane crash at age 30, Patsy Cline was considered one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century.\n\nCline, from Winchester, VA, was best friends with fellow country music singer/songwriter Loretta Lynn, and the two southern belles made sweet music together.\n\nA childhood throat infection left Cline with a self-described booming voice. It was a smooth sound that was a contralto, the lowest vocal range of a female vocalist.\n\n6. Timbaland\n\nOne of the hottest producers in the music industry, Timbaland has worked with artists like Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado, Jay-Z, and Drake.\n\nTimbaland grew up in Norfolk, Virginia, and is a Grammy winner with nominations in genres such as hip hop, dance, and R&B.\n\nHe’s famous for his lack of reliance on traditional instruments like the guitar, piano, or bass. Instead, Timbaland has a unique producing style characterized by swift-kick drum sounds.\n\nOne interesting fact is that his cousin is famous musician Pharrell Williams – music certainly runs in the family!\n\n7. Pharrell Williams\n\nPharrell Williams from Virginia Beach, Virginia makes up one-half of the music-producing duo The Neptunes.\n\nPharrell works with the hottest artists in music, including Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, and Britney Spears.\n\nHe has an impressive range of styles, which allowed him to serve as the composer for Universal Pictures megahit, Despicable Me.\n\nPharell’s music has mainstream appeal; songs like Happy and Get Lucky were worldwide smash hits that also won Grammy awards.\n\nThe ability of Pharrell to produce critically acclaimed music that is also extremely popular makes him a uniquely talented artist.\n\n8. D’Angelo\n\nD’Angelo, a Richmond, Virginia native, is a smooth crooner with funk, soul, and R&B origins.\n\nAs the son of a Pentecostal preacher, D’Angelo grew up with the sounds of gospel playing a large part in his vocal development.\n\nHis debut album Brown Sugar was revered across the industry, and fans were unsure if he could duplicate the magic.\n\nHe proved that he had staying power as Voodoo, his second album, earned him a Grammy Award and a permanent place on the list of influential R&B singer/songwriters.\n\n9. Hilary Hahn\n\nHilary Hahn started her career as a child prodigy, performing the violin unlike any others in her age group.\n\nThe classically trained violinist has performed at Vatican City and in the world-renowned New York Philharmonic orchestra.\n\nAlthough she prefers to play Bach above all other musicians, Hahn also plays Beethoven, Stravinsky, and Brahms.\n\nThe talented musician from Lexington, Virginia is no longer a child, but she still plays classical music around the world and is one of the greatest violinists of her generation.\n\n10. Chris Brown\n\nKnown for his singing as much as his dancing, singer Chris Brown, born in Tappahannock, Virginia, became an overnight sensation.\n\nHis first song, Run It, was an instant success, dominating airwaves.\n\nEarly in his career, Chris Brown drew comparisons to the King of Pop Michael Jackson; Brown paid homage to Jackson on multiple occasions.\n\nHis impressive dancing skills set him far apart from peers in his demographic. Brown has released ten studio albums in his impressive career of nearly two decades.\n\n11. Wes Borland (Limp Bizkit)\n\nWhen people think of Limp Bizkit, they think of loud beats, artistic metal, and intense, experimental sound.\n\nThe success of Limp Bizkit is due, in part, to the talents of bass player Wes Borland from Richmond, Virginia.\n\nBorland has country music influences which are a far departure from the music of Limp Bizkit. Along with frontman Fred Durst, Borland popularized the genre of rap-rock.\n\nHe eventually left Limp Bizkit in 2000 to focus on creating music with his brother and their band Big Dumb Face.\n\nAfter a short hiatus, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit and performs with the group to this day.\n\n12. Roy Clark\n\nIt is perhaps no surprise that singer and guitarist Roy Clark was born to two musical parents in Meherrin, Virginia.\n\nClark learned from his parents and took their skills to the next level, becoming a world-renowned fiddle and banjo player.\n\nClark called himself a “hillbilly singer” and had lightning-fast guitar skills that often places him near the top of best guitar players lists.\n\nRoy Clark has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Many modern famous guitarists credit Roy Clark as an inspiration.\n\n13. Ruth Brown\n\nAtlantic Records is known as “The House That Ruth Built,” thanks to the success that singer-songwriter Ruth Brown of Portsmouth, Virginia brought the emerging record label.\n\nAfter releasing “Teardrops from My Eyes,” Brown became known as “Miss Rhythm.” She is a pioneer of R&B music; her songs dominated the charts in the fifties, and she later transitioned into acting.\n\nMusic runs in the family; her nephew is legendary hip hop MC Rakim.\n\n14. Kali Uchis\n\nKali Uchis is a Colombian American singer, born in Alexandria, Virginia, who has already won a Grammy in her young career.\n\nThe singer takes Colombian influences and makes them her own, with music that is critically acclaimed and receives mainstream success.\n\nAlthough Uchis is a celebrated singer, she has other musical talents, playing the saxophone and piano.\n\nShe frequently collaborates with Tyler the Creator and The Gorillaz, two distinct artists with loyal followings.\n\n15. Steve Earle\n\nSteve Earle, from Hampton, Virginia, is a popular bass guitar player with folk and country inspirations.\n\nHis songs have been performed by the likes of Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, to name a few.\n\nEarl’s songs draw inspiration from his upbringing, including a song about a coal miner tragedy that resulted in 29 deaths.\n\nEarl advocated for numerous causes, like autism, after his young son’s diagnosis at age two.\n\n16. Missy Elliott\n\nMissy Elliot from Portsmouth, Virginia is known for loud beats, wild fashion, and infectious music.\n\nAlthough she is a celebrated performer of hip-hop music, Elliot is also a successful producer and songwriter. Along with lifelong friend Timbaland, Missy has produced hits for Aaliyah and SWV.\n\nShe’s also the recipient of four Grammy awards, and she has received numerous other accolades – she’s truly a pioneer in her domain.\n\n17. Gene Vincent\n\nGene Vincent was an enigmatic performer who donned all-black leather while cementing his name as a rock rebel.\n\nVincent, born in Norfolk, Virginia, is a rockabilly music pioneer whose song Be-Bop-a-Lula drew immediate comparisons to Elvis Presley.\n\nHis career was short but explosive and wildly successful as Vincent had an untimely death, passing away at only 36 years old, but his legacy still lives.\n\nSumming Up Our List of The Greatest Musicians From Virginia\n\nVirginia is home to the first English settlement of what would become the United States.\n\nSince explorers stepped foot on the rocky beaches nearly five centuries ago, Virginia has continued to grow.\n\nFederal government buildings, presidential homes, national cemeteries, and delicious food are just a few of the things that call the “Mother of all States” home.\n\nThe Mother of all States is also the birthplace of many musicians, all born and bred in the influential state."
