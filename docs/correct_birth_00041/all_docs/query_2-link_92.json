        "text": "Timbaland, Nelly Furtado, and Justin Timberlake have reunited for “Keep Going Up,” a brand new single featuring the three titans of ‘00s pop. Stream the song below.\n\nThe trio previously collaborated on 2007’s “Give It to Me,” which hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 when it debuted. Now, 16 years later, they’ve come together again to craft more of the R&B, pop magic they are each masters of. After teasing the track on social media for a few weeks — and landing it a placement in ESPN’s Week 1 Monday Night Football promotional spot — “Keep Going Up” has finally arrived.\n\nFurtado, who is just now coming out of a half-decade pause from releasing music, explained that “Keep Going Up” originated as a collaboration between Timbaland and Timberlake, but the two reached out to her because they felt her energy was exactly what the track needed. “We connected. There was a real healing thing that happened,” she said in an appearance on Emily Ratajkowski’s High Low podcast (via Yahoo). “Between the three of us — me, Timbaland, and JT — we’ve all had long careers with ups and downs… To me, personally, doing this song together feels very authentic and is a mini-miracle.”\n\nRelated Video\n\nWatch the visualizer for “Keep Going Up” — featuring footage of the trio doing their thing in the studio — below.\n\n“Keep Going Up” also comes ahead of even more new music from Timbaland, who took to Instagram on Wednesday, August 30th, to announce that he has a new EP on the way, entitled Textbook Timbo. Along with the announcement, he shared a snippet of a new song featuring Conway the Machine, and promised that the EP is coming “ASAP.” You can also check out that clip below."
