        "text": "358\n\nTimbaland is a widely revered, highly celebrated, stellar producer who has jazzed up some of the most memorable tunes in the history of the 21st-century entertainment industry, with his masterly, gingerly beats and ingenious infusions of usually overlooked everyday items as garbage cans, buckets, spoons and rakes into his beat-making repertoire.\n\nTimbaland, born Timothy Z. Mosley, got his stage name from producer and musician DeVante Swing, under whose tutelage he learned to use studio equipment, who would mispronounce the name of shoe manufacturer Timberland. Timbaland quickly got the hang of the beat-making craft and swiftly blossomed into a production demigod. He produced for Aaliyah in her 1996 hit song, “One in a Million,” and subsequently signed with Blackground Records as a solo act and part of the rap duo Timbaland and Magoo. Timbaland and Magoo released their first album, Welcome to Our World, in 1997, with the hit song, “Up Jumps da Boogie.” This album sold platinum.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Timbaland had metamorphosed into a rapacious conflagration on the music industry mountain, churning blazing beats and hazy hits for every significant name in the game. The entire entertainment industry was sounding with the alarm of the marvelous melodies of the production pundit. Timbaland produced for hip-hop artists such as Ginuwine, Jay-Z, Missy Elliott, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg to pop and rock stars such as Nelly Furtado, Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Beck and Bjork. Proud of his illustrious achievements, the contented beatmaker created new record labels under the umbrella of Interscope-Beat Club and Mosley Music Group and received three Grammy Awards for his work with Justin Timberlake on “SexyBack” (2006), “LoveStoned/I Think She Knows” (2007), and “Pusher Love Girl” (2013). He also earned a Grammy for his contributions to Beyonce’s “Drunk in Love” (2013).\n\nTimbaland is not only about the beats and the hits; he has a flair for lifting the spirits of the young. In 2019, he released his first children’s book, Nighttime Symphony. He is not only a book writer but also an investor who has invested in Yuga Lab’s MMORPG metaverse named “Otherside.” He has also acquired a strategic stake in UK-born lifestyle and vinyl brand 12on12.\n\nJoin Billionaires.Africa as we delve into the multifaceted world of Timbaland, exploring five of his business ventures that reflect his genius, both within and beyond the music industry.\n\nMosley Music Group\n\nMosley Music Group (MMG) is a record label founded by Timbaland in 2006. The imprint is distributed exclusively by Interscope Records and Def Jam Recordings. Timbaland’s Mosley Music Group has sold over 25 Million albums and more than 40 million singles with artists including One Republic, Nelly Furtado, Keri Helson, Bubba Sparks, and more.\n\nLe Sutra Liqueur\n\nIn 2012, Timbaland launched his breakthrough ultra-premium sparkling liqueur, Le SUTRA, in four flavors: blueberry, strawberry, grape, and peach.\n\nApe-In Productions\n\nApe-In Productions (AIP) is a Web3 record label, entertainment company, and talent agency co-founded by Timbaland and Bored Ape Yacht Club members. Ape-In Productions develops music and animation for metaverse applications.\n\nVerzuz\n\nVerzuz, an American webcast series, was conceived by record producers Timbaland and Swizz Beatz. It is broadcast on Verzuz TV. The series initially debuted amidst the COVID-19 pandemic as a virtual DJ battle. Timbaland and Swizz Beatz squared off in the first iteration of Verzuz, which was showcased through an Instagram Live broadcast in March 2020.\n\nBeatclub\n\nBeatclub, which he founded in 2021, is a music platform and marketplace for artists, producers, and songwriters that connects the creative community with record labels, music publishers, licensing companies, and independent artists."
