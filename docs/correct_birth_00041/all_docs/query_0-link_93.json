        "text": "Timothy Zachary Mosley (born March 10, 1972), known professionally by his stage name Timbaland, is an American musician, record producer, rapper, DJ, and record executive. Timbaland's first full credit production work was in 1996 on Ginuwine...the Bachelor for R&B singer Ginuwine. After further work on Aaliyah's second studio album One in a Million (1996) and Missy Elliott's debut studio album Supa Dupa Fly (1997), Timbaland became a prominent producer for R&B and hip hop artists. As a rapper he initially released several albums with fellow rapper Magoo, followed by his debut solo album Tim's Bio in 1998. In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single \"Cry Me a River\" for Justin Timberlake, going on to produce most of Timberlake's subsequent LPs such as FutureSex/LoveSounds and The 20/20 Experience and their respective hit singles. A Timbaland-owned imprint label, Mosley Music Group, featured artists such as Nelly Furtado, whose Timbaland-produced album Loose (2006) was a commercial and critical success. In 2007, Timbaland released a solo album, Shock Value, which was followed by Shock Value II in 2009. Later in his career he was responsible, along with Swizz Beatz, for creating the popular webcast series Verzuz in 2020. Aside from the aforementioned artists, Timbaland's production credits from the 2000s forward include work with Jay-Z, Nas, Ludacris, Bubba Sparxxx, Madonna, Rihanna, OneRepublic, Brandy, Drake, Rick Ross and others. As a songwriter, he has written 85 UK hits and 99 hits Stateside, as of 2014. Timbaland has received widespread acclaim for his production style. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly stated that \"just about every current pop trend can be traced back to him â€” from sultry, urban-edged R&B songstresses ... to the art of incorporating avant-garde sounds into No. 1 hits.\"\n\nBio from Wikipedia - See more on en.wikipedia.org Text under CC-BY-SA license"
