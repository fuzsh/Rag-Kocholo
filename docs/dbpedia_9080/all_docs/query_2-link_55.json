        "text": "Description\n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nIsrael has seized the opportunity of Hamas’s operation on 7 October 2023 to devastate Gaza, reducing it to rubble, massacring a huge number of its inhabitants and forcing the rest to flee. Another Nakba is underway, 75 years after the creation of Israel. This booklet includes articles by Gilbert Achcar written as the Israeli onslaught started unfolding in Gaza. He explains why the population of Gaza is facing such ‘massive extermination’, and argues that the refusal of Western governments to call for a ceasefire is making them accomplices to crimes against humanity.\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1. Initial comments on Hamas’s October counter-offensive; 2. The impending catastrophe and the urgency of stopping it; 3. Two Gaza scenarios: Greater Israel vs. Oslo; 4. The Plan to Complete the Nakba Revealed; 5. The Zionist Genocidal War and Its Accomplices; 5. The crisis in Gaza: an interview"
