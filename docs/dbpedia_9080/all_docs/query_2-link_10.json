        "text": "While this mutation is a tribute to the importance of the protest movement against the war in the United States, we cannot ignore its opportunistic and hypocritical nature.\n\nThere is little doubt that Israel will respond to Iran’s launch of three hundred and twenty drones, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles on its territory with a major attack on Iran, and this for several reasons.\n\nAchcar clarifies and expands his argument on the position the left should take on peace in Ukraine\n\nA response to Jean Vogel’s critique of Achcar’s “For a democratic antiwar position on the invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nWhat are we to make of the Saudi vote to cut OPEC+ oil production?\n\nGilbert Achcar responds to six questions about his “Memorandum on the radical anti-imperialist position regarding the war in Ukraine.”\n\nThe Afghan government’s fate is but the most recent in a long list of cases of puppet entities created by a foreign occupation that collapse when that occupation ends.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a left anti-imperialist today? Stephen R. Shalom interviews Gilbert Achcar.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a left anti-imperialist today? Stephen R. Shalom interviews Gilbert Achcar.\n\nIsrael’s official discourse vehemently denies its “deeply ingrained institutionalized” anti-Arab racism and the settler-colonial nature of its state, although it is as blatant as could be and was even acknowledged by Zionism’s prominent historical figures."
