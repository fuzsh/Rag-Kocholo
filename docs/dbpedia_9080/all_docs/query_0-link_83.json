        "text": "The Lebanese power sharing consociational system has structurally engendered recurring protest cycles: student mobilisations, labour and union mobilising, left-wing collectives, as well as a more routinised associative sector. In a long temporality, and looking at these movements in a longitudinal approach, changes they appear to be seeking appear to be marginal or quite limited, which may lead to the observation that contentious movements play the role of mere relief outlet within the system they are challenging, hence, contributing to the permanence of the social and political structures they are challenging. The past year has witnessed the emergence of a mobilisation cycle in the country that displays a continuity with previous forms of organising, although unprecedented in terms of its geographical spread over the territory. To understand how this current protest cycle unfolds, its dynamics, and limits, we propose to consider how social actors “move” in a contested, competitive,...\n\nIn the midst of a severe economic crisis, the protests that broke out in Lebanon on October 17th represent a potential monumental rupture in the country’s post-Civil War political and social order. Lebanon’s ruling class has been shaken and traditional political dynamics have been disrupted. Yet, in a state often characterised as weak, the political and social regime premised on sectarian and confessional divisions remains strong. Attempts to re-enforce sectarian divisions by traditional political parties are a clear demonstration of this dynamic. While the protest movement continues to press its demands for the removal of what they see as a corrupted political class, an independent cabinet and new a new electoral law, many challenges remain. Understanding both the dynamics of the protest movement and the lenses through which politics are viewed in the country represents an important piece of the puzzle in understanding where the country may be heading and determining long-term policy solutions to the country’s economic, political and social ills.\n\nFrom the end of the 1960s until the outbreak of the Civil War (1975), Lebanon experienced a phase of relatively sustained industrial expansion. Albeit the \"boom\" did not modify significantly Lebanon's tertiarized economic structure, it was anyway sufficient to create the structural conditions for the emergence of a new militant working-class able to become one of the most relevant contentious actors of its time. This new working class was made primarily of very young and recently urbanized unemployed of rural origin, brutally injected in a crude and hyper-exploitative productive cycle where formal labor unions were, for the most part, absent or scarcely effective. The input for their grassroots, transgressive organization into factory-based Workers' Committees came from the Organization for Communist Action in Lebanon (OACL), i.e. the most important force of the so-called Lebanese New Left, within the framework of a broader process of militant penetration of the \"revolutionary classes\" produced by the contradictions of Lebanese capitalism. This created the precondition for the Committees to affirm themselves not only as the radical avant-garde of the Lebanese labor movement but also as an integral part of a broader process of contestation of the existing status quo by the subaltern groups emerged from-or activated by-the structural and cultural changes that the country was experiencing. By retrieving the forgotten history of the Workers' Committees, the article wants to examine the forms and the trajectories whereby such a new working class became an integral part of this process. In particular, by adopting a Gramscian methodology, the article will first expose the structural changes in the Lebanese industrial sector in the examined period and their labor implications. Then, it will focus on the dynamics which superseded the Committees' birth and affirmation, reserving particular attention to the role played by the OACL. Finally, it will conclude by examining the impact of their agency on the political developments that the country was experiencing. The paper contends that the emergence and the affirmation of counter-hegemonical and transformative workingclass activism on the eve of the Civil War, along with representing a direct by-product of structural stresses and constraints, was significantly debtor also of the new ideological and militant infrastructures that the emergence of an Arab New Left had contributed to\n\nWith the onset of the garbage crisis in Lebanon in July 2015, the unbearable odors and mounting heaps of waste presented the tipping point for people's growing anger and resentment against self-serving political elites, debilitating public services, and deteriorating socioeconomic conditions. In response, the socio-political scene witnessed significant developments following the eruption of popular discontent, with the multiplication of media-savvy protest groups, followed by the rise of \"independent\" municipal electoral campaigns and, most recently, the emergence of a \"non-traditional\" \"political party experiment.\" Running under the elusive banner of \"civil society,\" emerging collective actions have all been attempting to advance \"alternative\" forms of organization and political participation. Examining three contentious and intriguing developments that have captured public attention, namely Al-Hirak, Beirut Madinati, and Sabaa, this article explores the antinomies of collective organization and action in the building of political \"alternatives.\" The research makes use of a thorough content analysis of Facebook campaigning posts and interview data and engages with literature on \"new\" social movements, digital activism, and collective organization to explore collective actors' contending relations to \"the political\" at the organizational level. The research concludes that rather than reconcile individuals with political participation through lasting organizational frameworks and coherent political \"alternatives,\" novel forms of collective organization increasingly conform to a global neoliberal logic of action that is increasingly fragmentary, individualizing and commercializing, and a fleeting logic of organization that is mostly unaccountable and unrepresentative.\n\n‘From castles and palaces and churches to prisons and workhouses and schools; from weapons of war to a controlled press’, Raymond Williams writes, ‘any ruling class, in variable ways though always materially, produces a social and political order’. This productive activity constitutes the essence of what can be referred to as social movements from above. This paper explores social movements from above as the organization of multiple forms of skilled activity around a rationality expressed and organized by dominant social groups, which aims at the maintenance or modification of a dominant structure of entrenched needs and capacities in ways that reproduce and/or extend the power of those groups and its hegemonic position within a given social formation. Starting from a theoretical conception of social structure as the sediment of struggle between social movements from above and those from below, the paper discusses the relevance of a conception of social movements from above to activist experience – in particularly as a way of avoiding the reification of exploitative and oppressive social structures. The paper moves on to an outline of a model of the fields of force animated by movements from above and below in understanding the major ‘epochal shifts’ and ‘long waves’ in capitalist development. This model is then put to work in a prolegomenon to an analysis of global neoliberal restructuring as a social movement from above aiming to restore the class power of capital over labour. This analysis aims to discern the hegemony of neoliberalism not as an accomplished and monolithic state of affairs, but as an unfinished process riddled by internal contradictions which the movement of movements might exploit in its efforts to impose an alternative direction and meaning upon the self-production of society.\n\nThe topic of contentious politics raises important questions when studying social collective action against neoliberal institutions. What explains this mobilization against such institutions? What accounts for the bottom-up mobilization as opposed to top-down actions? And what does the Lebanese case say about contentious politics theory and vice versa? This chapter applies these questions when analysing Solidere; the institution responsible for reconstructing Downtown Beirut. It draws on critical studies of neoliberalism from New Urban Governance literature, as well as the vigorous local debates surrounding the reconstruction of Downtown Beirut. It will be divided into two main sections. The first section will give a brief theoretical analysis on the way neoliberal institutions (such as Solidere) function and the impact of this grassroots mobilization against these institutions. From that, the second section will provide an overview of the battle over the reconstruction process in Downtown Beirut, and shed light on the different individuals and interest groups that confronted Solidere, as well as their different interests and discursive strategies. It will then conclude with a small summary that will stress that even though the mobilization that took place represented the beginnings of a return to democratic and peaceful culture in Lebanese society, it did not foster inclusion and equal representation in Solidere.\n\nAs the “October Revolution” of 2019 spread throughout Lebanon, the northern city of Tripoli soon became a veritable hotbed of protests. Over several weeks, the city saw a string of the largest anti-government protests in the country, thus earning the moniker “Bride of Revolution” (‘Arus al-Thawrah). However, it did not take long for things to begin to fall apart. Tripoli would soon give a picture of a not-so-glorious protest movement, penetrated by a potpourri of scheming elements of the Lebanese kleptocracy and business elites and geopolitical interests. The revolutionary slogans and bonds that connected the city’s sectarian mosaic proved ephemeral. The ontological vibrancy, multiplicity, and heterogeneity of the protest movement gave way to political monotony, sameness, and ideological harmony. This paper provides an explanation of how the revolution coexisted, and often perilously so, with its nemesis – counterrevolution – in the protest movement in Tripoli.

Protestors railed against structural corruption and demanded immediate reforms to end the overtly clientelist structure embedded in the very core of Lebanon's political and economic system. During the protest's intoxicating early days and its carnival-like atmosphere , there was a lot of hope for revolutionary change. My essay frames these protests and the hopes of the protestors. It examines why the sudden announcement of a series of regressive taxes that, in reality , had become the norm for three decades triggered such universal anger and mobilization. It also briefly charts the uprising's demise amid the unmasking of a nationwide banking Ponzi scheme, galloping inflation, palpable insecurity , national and protestor group division, and COVID-19 lockdowns. With the country in disarray, most people had been reduced to survival mode.\n\nThroughout 2011, workers, business associations and the government of Lebanon negotiated a wage increase. On January 25, 2012, the government of Lebanon adopted Decree No. 7426 increasing the monthly minimum wage for private sector employees from LBP 500,000 (USD 333) to LBP 675,000 (USD 450) and providing for a living cost increase up to LBP 299,000 per month (USD 200). The General Confederation of Workers in Lebanon (GCWL) not only relinquished the occasion to champion the social reforms package presented by Minister of Labour, but it was also quick to accept the government’s meagre wage increase. In 2012, amidst the paralysis of the GCWL, a seminal mobilisation of public sector employees who rallied under the Union Coordination Committee (UCC) demanded wage adjustment. Nevertheless, after several years of mobilisation, the UCC did not oppose the 2017 salary scale despite its obvious drawbacks. What were the means of emaciation of workers during this period and to what extent did the manipulation of sectarian and political affiliations tame the workers’ struggle? The intervention of the ruling elite within the GCLW structure through the manipulation of sectarian and political affiliations implied, first, a divided movement, and second, an overall cautious and moderate behaviour towards the government. Recently, the co-optation of the UCC reflected the recurrence of the same tactics and manoeuvres applied by the ruling elite against the GCWL that aimed to contain the demands of public sector workers leading to the weakening of the UCC after three years of continuous confrontation."
