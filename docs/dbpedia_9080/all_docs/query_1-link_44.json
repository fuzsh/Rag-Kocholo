I finished writing it in October 2012. This was close to two years after the ignition in December 2010 of the revolutionary shockwave, quickly dubbed the Arab Spring, that engulfed most Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), culminating in major popular uprisings in six of the region’s countries: Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria.\n\nThe tenth anniversary of the Arab Spring in 2021 elicited a predictable deluge of comment and analysis offering various assessments of the shockwave and its consequences. These comments sounded more often like obituaries than appraisals of the state of play, even though two years earlier, in 2019, the media had identified a Second Arab Spring, potential or actual, represented by the popular uprisings that unfolded in that year in four of the region’s other countries: Sudan, Algeria, Iraq and Lebanon. To these four could also be added the massive popular protests that brought down the cabinet in Jordan in the spring of 2018.\n\nThe overall result is that, within less than ten years, ten or eleven of the twenty-two member-countries of the League of Arab States,1 between them representing the vast majority of the region’s population, have reached the point of full-fledged uprisings. Except for the highly peculiar Gulf states of Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, close to 90% of whose populations are made up of migrants, all other countries have witnessed waves of social protest at some point since 2011, recurrently in some cases. Thus, a key contention of this book – namely, that what occurred in 2011 was but the opening salvo of a long-term revolutionary process affecting the whole Arabic-speaking region – has been amply confirmed.\n\nThis contention is closely related to the book’s core thesis about the root cause of this social and political explosion. I argue that it was provoked by a developmental blockage that had been hampering the region’s economic growth for several decades, producing dire consequences in social inequality and the underemployment of human resources. The MENA region had long been suffering from the highest rates of youth unemployment of any world region – a situation that has only deteriorated since 2011. These crucial factors generated huge social frustration, which inevitably translated into political discontent: the region’s populations, especially its youth, could no longer endure a hopeless social condition enforced by various types of undemocratic regimes, all of them deeply corrupt.\n\nThe book’s second core thesis is that the developmental blockage described above is determined in turn by a particular inadequacy of the neoliberal paradigm, which had prevailed in the Arabic-speaking region, as in most of the rest of the world, since the 1980s. The neoliberal orientation of economic policy is predicated on the centrality of the private sector as the driving engine of development. It stems from a highly idealised view of capitalism as an economic system propelled by fair competition, whereas actually-existing capitalism is routinely very remote from this ideal-type. Indeed, there is hardly a region of the world where capitalism is more remote from its ideal type than the Arabic-speaking region, where crony capitalism, closely intertwined with the state, prevails under conditions of long-term unpredictability, determining a take-the-money-and-run attitude among the owners of capital.\n\nIn these countries, the sharp decline in public investment induced by neoliberal imperatives has not been offset by an increase in private investment, especially of the kind conducive to development. Leaving aside sectors related to the exploitation of natural resources – especially hydrocarbons – private investment has mostly been directed towards speculative activities: real estate, and the connected sectors of construction and tourism; nepotistic state-licenced activities, especially in the telecoms industry, that facilitate speedy accumulation of capital under quasi-monopolistic conditions. The bulk of private investment in the region has been of a kind that creates very limited long-term job opportunities. Such investment cannot compensate for the drastic reduction in public employment that has accompanied the neoliberal shift, often pushed through by the global enforcers of the neoliberal economic order – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nThe book’s third core thesis is that this dysfunctional economic system is shaped by the regional prevalence of state rentierism and patrimonialism. A distinctive feature of the region is that it includes several states where these characteristics find their highest expression, each of them bolstering the other. Due to the MENA region’s rich hydrocarbon resources, it includes more states that are overwhelmingly dependent on rent than any other part of the world. This in turn leads to some states benefiting, due to strategic and security considerations, from rents drawn on richer states’ hydrocarbon rents, or determined by foreign powers’ eagerness to maintain a regional system of hegemony whose key motivation is narrowly linked to the region’s resources. Intimately related to this is the fact that the region has long included a number of fully patrimonial states – an oddity in the modern world. These are states where any separation between the ruling families and the institutions of government is simply a polite fiction: the former regard the latter as their private property, and the elite sections of the armed forces as their private guard.\n\nThe high degrees of rentierism and patrimonialism that characterise several of the region’s states have a strong gravitational effect on the rest of them, which display the same two features – albeit at lesser degrees. All of them depend on various types of rent to sustain or complement their expenditure, and all of them exhibit highly corrupt forms of neopatrimonialism.2 These basic characteristics of states in the MENA region create an environment that is the opposite of ideal-typical capitalism, in which development is led by the private sector – an environment poisoned by the arbitrary and predatory nature of government power, and by political and economic unpredictability.\n\nA corollary of the above is that there can be no way out of the crisis that erupted in 2011 without a structural alteration of these debilitating features of the state; in short, putting the region back on the path of development will require radical sociopolitical change. Viewed from this perspective, the Arab Spring was only the beginning of a long-term revolutionary process – one whose goals cannot be achieved by a merely procedural shift towards electoral democracy: in the absence of radical sociopolitical change, democratisation would remain precarious and doomed to fail. The immediate aftermath of the 2011 uprisings saw the advent of democratic experiences in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. At the time of writing, they have all failed: a military coup brought the Egyptian episode to an end in 2013; Libya and Yemen sunk into civil war, starting from 2014; and the longest-standing democratic experience in Tunisia was abruptly ended in 2021. A similar fate threatens the limited democratic gains achieved in 2019 by Sudan’s uprising.\n\nAnd yet, the Arab Spring is neither dead nor forever transformed into winter, as so many commentators have asserted. The euphoria of 2011 gave way to gloomy assessments during the reactionary backlash that followed, signalled most of all by the 2013 coup in Egypt. The second revolutionary wave, in 2019, led to some revival of positive views, albeit much more sober and cautious than those of 2011. Soon after, however, the Tunisian presidential coup of 25 July 2021, followed by the Sudanese military coup of 25 October, prompted new obituaries for the prospect of democratic change in the Arabic-speaking region. Orientalist tropes about the incompatibility of Islam or of Arab culture with democracy have reasserted themselves since their first apparent refutation in 2011. Such tropes completely disregard the fact that Europe’s own transition from absolutism to democracy was neither rapid nor smooth, and that, unlike Western Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth century, the Middle East and North Africa must contend with both a history and a present of foreign domination that is fundamentally inimical to genuine democratisation.\n\nHere we arrive at two major complications identified in this book. The first derives from the division of the Arab region’s states into a hard core of fully patrimonial states and a larger set of neopatrimonial states afflicted by various degrees of corruption and repressiveness. After the fall of Mubarak in Egypt, in the wake of Tunisia’s Ben Ali in early 2011, euphoric expectations of a domino effect taking down leaders in the other countries affected by the regional shockwave were widespread. Two illusions were at work in this belief. The first was that nonviolent popular uprisings would be capable of inducing state apparatuses everywhere to ditch their rulers, as they did in the two countries that were the first to succumb to the Arab Spring. The second was that the abandonment and removal of the head of state by those apparatuses was tantamount to the overthrow of the regime that the people want, as per the most famous and ubiquitous slogan of the uprisings.\n\nThe scenario in which the state apparatuses would distance themselves from the head of state, ultimately pushing him (certainly not her in the regional political system) out of power was much less likely in the patrimonial states than in their neopatrimonial neighbours. In the former, there is no separation between the state and the ruling family, who own it as their patrimony. They therefore make sure to weave strong organic links between themselves and the institutions of the state, beginning with the most crucial of them: the military and security forces, which are the ruling dynasty’s ultimate shield. These forces are therefore led by members of the ruling family or by members of their kinship and tribal clans. Elite troops are recruited among the tribal, sectarian or regional communities most loyal to the regime. Under such conditions, short of a split within the ruling family itself, the armed forces’ hard core is most likely to remain wedded to the regime and willing to fight in its defence, which is synonymous with the defence of its own privileged position. Peaceful wholesale removal from power of the ruling clan is therefore highly unlikely: if the popular uprising manages to survive an initial phase of bloody repression, civil war becomes inevitable.\n\nIn the neopatrimonial states, on the other hand, state apparatuses are much more likely to abandon the head of state to preserve the state when the former becomes a source of concern about the future of the latter. In all three neopatrimonial states of the region where the armed forces constitute the central political institution – Egypt, Algeria and Sudan – the military deposed the president by means of what I referred to, in relation to Mubarak’s removal in Egypt in 2011, as a conservative coup. In 2019, the militaries in both Algeria and Sudan followed suit. Sadly, these three cases of the straightforward overthrow of the regime’s head by the military – going way beyond the usual tinkering with the governmental fuse-box – have now amply demonstrated the falsity of the second of the two illusions mentioned above. The removal of the head of state in neopatrimonial states should not be confused with the overthrow of the regime: it is much more often a measure aimed at rescuing the regime, enabling it to catch its breath before it can find an opportune moment to crack down on the popular movement.\n\nBeyond this distinction between the likely turn of events in patrimonial and neopatrimonial states, the stubborn fact remains that the structures underlying the region’s regimes are hugely difficult obstacles to surmount. All over the Arabic-speaking region, highly corrupt regimes are firmly entrenched behind an iron wall of repressive military and security forces. The only way for revolutionary movements to bring down such regimes and dismantle the repressive apparatuses that protect them without too much bloodshed is by managing to build up such a massive popular counter-hegemony that they succeed in winning over the bulk of the rank and file within the military and security forces.\n\nThe second complication confronting the regional revolutionary process in its initial phase was the nature of the region’s political landscape, whose three contending camps permitted complex political triangulations. Ranged against the traditional counter-revolutionary camp, represented by the incumbent powers whose rule is contested, is the revolutionary camp consisting of a motley coalition of political persuasions from secular or moderately religious liberals and reformists to left-wing nationalists and socialists. But this picture is complicated by the existence throughout the MENA region of a powerful current of Islamic fundamentalists. It comprises three major factions: among Sunnis, the Muslim Brotherhood and associated political movements, on the one hand, and the Salafis on the other (excluding the relatively minor violent force referred to as Salafi jihadism); and, among Shias, the Iran-led Khomeinists.\n\nWhereas mainstream Salafis, who are mostly linked to the Saudi kingdom, usually stand by the existing regime, entrenched in the reactionary camp, they can occasionally join the protest movement as a Trojan horse – as they did in Egypt in 2011, while maintaining their allegiance to the military. For its part, the Muslim Brotherhood – consisting of formal branches in some countries and like-minded forces in others, all of them backed by the Emirate of Qatar – was in the political opposition in most countries before the upheaval, harshly repressed in some countries, such as Libya, Syria or Tunisia, tolerated as a more or less loyal opposition in others, such as Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. In Sudan and Algeria, by contrast, forces belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood current were periodically accommodated within government.\n\nWhen the Arab Spring unfolded, political organisations associated with the Muslim Brotherhood stepped forward in all of the countries where they were in opposition, joining the uprisings with a view to hijacking them. Being much stronger than the motley assortment of groups that had initiated the protests, they were able to take the helm, sailing into power through 2011 elections in Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco (where they were co-opted into government by the monarchy to defuse the protest movement) and Libya (despite their initial electoral failure there); meanwhile, they secured a share of power in Yemen. At the time, all of this looked very much like an Islamic tsunami engulfing the whole region, inciting many commentators into impressionistic Orientalist statements about Islamism being the region’s natural inclination. This book warned against such simplistic views.\n\nBriefly sketched, what has happened since 2011 is that the clash between the pillars of the old regimes and the Muslim Brotherhood factions prevailed over the confrontation with the third, progressive pole that had in every case initiated the protests, only to find itself relegated to the margins. This clash eventually led to the ousting of Muslim Brotherhood factions from government, or else degenerated into what became a regional pattern of civil war. Its main theatres and stages have been as follows: the Libyan civil war broke out in 2011, followed by the Syrian civil war, the Muslim Brotherhood playing a key role in opposition coalitions in both cases; in Egypt, the military overthrew a Muslim Brotherhood president, launching a bloody crackdown on the movement in 2013; in Tunisia, the Muslim Brotherhood-associated movement was forced out of its commanding government and parliamentary positions in 2014, though it managed to remain as a junior partner in a ruling coalition with sections of the old regime’s power elite; a second Libyan civil war began in 2014, and Yemen’s civil war began in that same year – although the role of the Muslim Brotherhood was less central and the overall situation more complex in the latter country.\n\nThese events represented the key moments of the counter-revolutionary backlash against the first shockwave of a long-term regional revolutionary process. The backlash started with the rescue of the Syrian regime by the direct military intervention of Iran and its regional auxiliaries in the spring of 2013, and was boosted by the military coup that occurred in Egypt in July of the same year. In 2016 I published a book-length analytical account of that first counter-revolutionary phase, with a special focus on Syria and Egypt.3 It includes a detailed discussion of the shortcomings of the progressive factions in both countries.\n\nSince then, a second regional revolutionary wave was initiated in Sudan in December 2018, followed by similar events in Algeria in February 2019, and in Iraq and Lebanon in October of the same year. A key characteristic of this second wave was that, unlike in the first wave, Islamic fundamentalists were almost exclusively on the side of the ruling powers, against the uprisings. In Sudan the fundamentalists, including the local Muslim Brotherhood affiliates, had been partners of the military dictatorship from its inception in 1989, and fundamentally remained so, even though factions within them were intermittently at odds with the military. In Algeria, the radical wing of the Islamic fundamentalist movement had been brutally crushed and politically discredited as a result of the country’s bloody civil war of the 1990s. During the following twenty years, local Muslim Brotherhood associates became intermittent participants in Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s regime. In both Iraq and Lebanon, Iran-backed Shia Islamic fundamentalists have constituted the main political and armed pillars of the existing regimes – in Lebanon, Hezbollah; in Iraq, various militias regrouped within the Popular Mobilisation coalition.\n\nThis should have laid to rest the Orientalist idea of the ineluctable domination by religious forces of every popular protest movement in the MENA region. Soon after, in 2021, the two remaining instances of participation of Muslim Brotherhood parties in government – Tunisia and Morocco – were brought to an end, respectively, by a Bonapartist presidential coup in July and a monarchy-fomented electoral wipeout in September. Thus ended the ten-year-long window of opportunity opened by the Arab Spring for the Muslim Brotherhood and its associates. This is not to say that this current has been consigned to the dustbin of history: it remains a significant component of the regional political landscape that must be reckoned with. But it has been largely discredited by its failure to show a way out of the structural socioeconomic crisis that underlies the regional revolutionary process.\n\nAnd this process is far from having expended itself. Anyone expecting the MENA region to return to the kind of stability, sustained by despotism, that prevailed within it for most of the four decades before the Arab Spring is gravely delusional. The real question is not whether the region will revert to despotic stabilisation, but whether new progressive forces will manage to emerge from among the new generations – forces capable of leading the popular movements towards a true overthrow of the region’s regimes. This will require nothing less than the wholesale replacement of the existing rotten states with truly democratic states, and a radical shift away from neoliberal-inspired policies towards a socially progressive, gender-emancipatory and environmentally sustainable future.\n\nIn the absence of such a best-case scenario, there is a high risk of the continuation of what I have described as a clash of barbarisms, in which the barbarism of the old regimes and their foreign backers – global powers such as the United States and Russia or regional ones such as Iran and Saudi Arabia – fuels the emergence of a counter-barbarism on the opposite side. The most hideous manifestation of the latter has been the so-called Islamic State, born in reaction against the barbaric US occupation of Iraq in 2003. This in turn followed the destruction of Iraq’s infrastructure by the US and its allies in 1991, and then twelve years of a criminal embargo that chiefly affected the poorest, their children most of all. Eventually defeated in Iraq, Islamic State moved into Syria, entering into a civil war that had been provoked by the regime’s barbaric repression of what had started as a peaceful uprising in 2011. The extreme barbarity of the Syrian regime found its reflection in that of Islamic State: the latter is more infamous only because it deliberately publicised its most horrendous acts for propaganda purposes, and because it targeted Westerners. In 2014, Islamic State spectacularly swept back into Iraq, provoking a debacle for the US-built government troops that would be matched only by the debacle of their Afghan equivalent in August 2021.\n\nIslamic State has been defeated once again, largely through a major US contribution consisting mainly of remote warfare. But it remains able to rise again from its ashes as long as the historical impasse endures. Like any other avatar of extremely violent Islamic fundamentalism, Islamic State is but a morbid symptom resulting from the putrefaction of conditions in which the old is dying and the new cannot be born, to use Antonio Gramsci’s well-known formulation. In this instance, morbidity prevails on both sides, and in the most extreme forms. Only the development of a progressive alternative to the regional old order stands any real chance of interrupting the infernal spiral of this clash of barbarisms. It was widely noted in 2011 how the hopes initially inspired by the Arab Spring had marginalised Al-Qaeda and its avatars. When Osama bin Laden was killed by US forces in May 2011, widespread commentary asserted that he had already been killed politically by the Arab Spring.4 Conversely, the frustration of the expectations created by the Arab Spring undoubtedly played an important role in facilitating Islamic State’s recruitment of young people in the region.\n\nIs the MENA region doomed to remain stuck in this dreadful vicious circle? In response to this question, I can only reiterate the distinction between optimism and hope that I emphasised in 2015:\n\nI’m still hopeful, even though I wouldn’t describe myself as optimistic. There’s a qualitative difference here. Hope is the belief that there is still a progressive potential. Optimism is the belief that this potential will win.\n\nI’m not betting on its winning because I know how difficult the task is, all the more in that building alternative progressive leaderships has to start almost from scratch in many countries. The task is daunting, it’s huge, but it’s not impossible. No one expected such an impressive progressive uprising as that of 2011.\n\nThe long-term revolutionary process in the region will be measured in decades rather than years. From a historical perspective, we are still in its initial stages. This should be a major incentive for intensive action to build progressive movements able to take the lead. The alternative is further descent into barbarism and a general collapse of the regional order into the kind of terrible chaos that we see developing already in quite a few countries.5\n\nThere is indeed no reasonable ground for much progressive optimism in the MENA region, given the extreme difficulty and complexity of the prevailing conditions. But there are nonetheless real grounds for hope in the political maturation of a new generation that has been awaking to politics in a context of upheaval and global information that is radically different from what their parents and grandparents knew. In our highly interconnected world, the future of this political maturation will also be very much conditioned by the evolution of political trends at the global level, especially among young people.\n\nI completed this book in October 2012, and it first came out in 2013. Since then, it has been published in Arabic, English, French, Persian and Turkish, and recently in Mexico in its first Spanish-language edition. This is the second English-language edition. The publishers and I believe that the book has lost none of its relevance ten years after its composition. Even Chapter 5, which offers a provisional balance sheet of the uprisings at the end of 2012, should remain useful in pointing to the problems encountered in each of the six countries of the 2011 Arab Spring. But readers will be able to judge for themselves: this edition reproduces the text of the first edition unaltered, except for the few minor corrections that are usual in second editions.6 A selected list of freely available readings complementing this book or assessing recent developments is provided at the end.\n\nLondon, 30 October 2021\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis book is the outcome of intensive work that started shortly after the beginning of the revolutionary wave engulfing the Arabic-speaking region. It is based, however, on the course on Problems of Development of the Middle East and North Africa that I have taught at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS, University of London) since the academic year 2007–8. This means that I owe much to my institution, which offers an ideal environment and one of the richest libraries for the research on the region that is the object of this study. The students who attended my lectures and who will remember them when they read the following pages have contributed with their questions to forming the answers this book provides.\n\nYet scholarly teaching and research are but two of the sources of this work. My major debt is toward the great number of those whom I met and with whom I had a chance to discuss during my travels in different countries of the region over decades, and most particularly since the beginning of the uprising. I clearly cannot name them all. Four key stages in this experience occurred in 2011, when I was honoured to be invited to take part in the Spring University of ATTAC Morocco in Casablanca, in April; the Socialist Days organised in Cairo after the uprising by the Egyptian Center for Socialist Studies, in May; the meeting of prominent members of the Syrian opposition, many of whom came directly from Syria to the place near Stockholm where it was held, in October; and the festivities celebrating the first anniversary of the beginning of the uprising in Sidi Bouzid, the Tunisian town where it all started, in December. I thank here one more time the organisers of these meetings, as well as the team of the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin which gave me the opportunity to take part in a gathering of persons involved in cultural activities in the Arab region in January 2012.\n\nI am also grateful to all those who invited me to submit some of this book’s theses to the critical attention of audiences including people knowledgeable about the region in various academic institutions – in particular Henry Laurens at the Collège de France, Robert Wade at the London School of Economics, Rashid Khalidi and Bashir Abu-Manneh at Columbia University in New York, Joel Beinin at Stanford University, Ronit Lentin at Trinity College in Dublin, Haideh Moghissi and Saeed Rahnema at York University in Toronto, Farid al-Alibi at the University of Kairouan, Tunisia, Tullo Vigevani at the Universidade Estadual Paulista (UNESP) in São Paulo, and the Brazilian National Social Science Postgraduate and Research Association (ANPOCS) at its annual convention in Caxambu.\n\nThe friends whose names follow have read the manuscript of this book in part or in whole and given me the benefit of their comments in finalising it: Henry Bernstein, Ray Bush, Franck Mermier, Saleh Mosbah, Alfredo Saad-Filho, Fawwaz Traboulsi and Lisa Wedeen. Very acute remarks by Omar El Shafei, who translated this book into Arabic, were most useful. My collaboration for the second time with Geoff Michael Goshgarian, who translated this book into English most elegantly after my previous one, The Arabs and the Holocaust, was equally an opportunity for useful exchanges between us. I beg those whom I failed to mention in these acknowledgements to excuse me. None of the above-mentioned persons can in any way be held responsible for the theses of this book and the errors that it may include.\n\nPreliminary Notes\n\nOn the Arab countries and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)\n\nIn the following pages, Arab refers to the member states of the Arab League (with the exception of the Union of the Comoros, Djibouti and Somalia). These countries are called Arab because Arabic is their main language of administration, communication and instruction. Thus Arab and Arabic are, here, geopolitical and linguistic terms (whence also the occasional reference to the Arabic-speaking region); neither is in any sense an ethnic description. Non-Arab groups comprise a significant segment of the populations of these countries, notably the Amazigh in North Africa (Maghreb) and the Kurds in the Middle East (Mashriq). They have taken an active part in the uprisings in the region.\n\nSeveral international institutions whose studies and statistics are copiously cited in the present book focus on a group of countries they call Middle East and North Africa (MENA or the MENA region). In addition to the countries identified above, MENA includes Iran. When data limited to the Arab states are lacking, data for the MENA region have been used.\n\nAll the figures published in this book are original; the sources of the data used in making them are indicated.\n\nOn Transliteration of Arabic\n\nThe method adopted for the transcription of Arabic words and names in the Latin alphabet is a simplified version of the transliteration system in use in specialised literature; the aim is to make it easier for non-specialists to read the text, while allowing the knowledgeable to recognise the original Arabic. Special characters and diacritical marks have been avoided, except for the inverted apostrophe representing the Arabic letter ‘ayn. The common spellings of the names of the best-known individuals have been retained. Finally, when Arabs have published in European languages, their own transliteration of their names in Latin letters has been respected, as has, in the citations, the transliteration of Arabic names in the form in which it occurs in the original.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUprisings and Revolutions\n\nThe people want! This proclamation has been and still is omnipresent in the protracted uprising that has been rocking the Arabic-speaking region since the Tunisian episode began in Sidi Bouzid on 17 December 2010. In every imaginable variant and every imaginable tone, it has served as the prelude to all sorts of demands, from the now famous revolutionary slogan The people want to overthrow the regime!, to highly diverse calls of a comic nature – exemplified by the demonstrator in Cairo’s Tahrir Square who held high a sign reading: The people want a president who doesn’t dye his hair!\n\nThe people want ... first emerged as a slogan in Tunisia. It echoes two famous lines by Tunisian poet Abul-Qacem al-Shebbi (1909–34) inserted in the country’s national anthem:\n\nIf the people want life some day, fate will surely grant their wish\n\nTheir shackles will surely be shattered and their night surely vanish.1\n\nThe coming of the day of reckoning expressed in this collective affirmation that the people want, in the present tense – that they want here and now – illustrates in the clearest possible way the irruption of the popular will onto the Arab political stage. Such an irruption is the primary characteristic of every democratic uprising. In contrast to the proclamations adopted by representative assemblies, such as the \"We the people\" in the Preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America, here, the will of the people is expressed without intermediary, chanted at lung-splitting volumes by immense throngs such as those that the world has seen packing the streets of Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, Bahrain, Libya, Syria and many other countries besides.\n\nThe use of the term revolution to qualify the upheavals underway in the Arab region has nevertheless been, and continues to be, hotly debated and stoutly contested, even in those victorious cases in which the people have succeeded in ridding themselves of an oppressive tyrant. The more neutral term uprising has been used in this book’s subtitle not only to avoid settling the debate on the cover, but also because the word revolution has more than one sense.\n\nThe Arab region has unquestionably witnessed uprisings. Indeed, it has witnessed the whole gamut of what that word designates, from outpourings of demonstrators to armed insurrections. The Arabic term intifada, which the Palestinian population of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 has added to the international lexicon, covers the same semantic range. The Arabic term thawra also has a broad range of meanings: derived from the verb thara (to revolt), it originally corresponded more closely to the idea of revolt than to that of revolution. Thus thawra is accurately translated in the familiar English names of other events that have shaken the Arab region: the Great Arab Revolt of 1916–18, the 1920 Revolt in Iraq, the Great Syrian Revolt of 1925, and the Great Palestinian Revolt of 1936. For the same reason, insurgents, rebels and revolutionaries alike are called thuwwar in Arabic.\n\nFarsi, together with the languages it has most deeply influenced, has for good reason settled on the Arabic term inqilab (overturning) to translate the Western concept of revolution. In Arabic itself, however, inqilab has come to mean coup d’état, whereas thawra means not just revolt, but also revolution – in the sense of a radical upheaval including, at the very least, a change in the political regime accomplished in ways that violate existing legality. These diverse semantic developments can help us bring out the imprecision of the terms in our own ordinary lexicon.2\n\nThe concept of revolution generally evokes, in Western languages, a movement in which the people seek to overthrow the government from below, although a revolution need not lead to the use of arms. A coup d’état, in contrast, is the work of a faction, usually originating in the army, which seizes power at the pinnacle of society, always by force of arms. It so happens that the history of the Arab region is dotted with coups d’état that were unquestionably revolutionary, in that they culminated in profound transformations of political institutions and social structures. To cite just one example, the 23 July 1952 coup of the Free Officers led by Gamal Abdel-Nasser unquestionably led to a transformation of Egypt much more radical than anything that has so far resulted from the Revolution of 25 January 2011.\n\nThe 1952 coup led to the overthrow of a dynasty, the abolition of the monarchy and parliamentary regime, the creation of a republican military dictatorship, the nationalisation of foreign assets, the subversion of the old regime’s property-holding classes (big landed property, commercial and financial capital), a major drive to industrialise and far-reaching progressive social reforms."
