        "text": "published on 2020-09-13T04:58:22Z\n\nIt's been six weeks since a devastating explosion rocked the port ofÂ Beirut, killingÂ hundreds and leaving widespread destruction throughout the city.Â Caused by the negligent storage of nearly 3000 tons of ammonium nitrate in a portside warehouse, the disaster has dramatically exposed the criminal nature of the Lebanese ruling class. Alex Whisson spoke to Gilbert Achcar,Â Professor of Development Studies and International Relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London."
