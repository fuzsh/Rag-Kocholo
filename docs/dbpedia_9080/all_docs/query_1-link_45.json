        "text": "Summer Rain by Annette Levy Willard. Psychology News Press £9.99, pp192\n\nThe 33-Day War by Gilbert Achcar and Michel Warschawski. Saqi Books £12.99, pp136\n\nAnnette Levy Willard, a senior reporter with the French newspaper Liberation, kept a diary of life in Israel during last summer's month-long conflict with the Hizbollah militia of Lebanon. The result, Summer Rain, is an immediate and intimate portrait of a tiny country at war: militarily mighty, hated and feared by its neighbours and living in a permanent state of fear itself.\n\nOn 12 July 2006, Hizbollah, whose members operate a 'state within a state' in south Lebanon, fired rockets into kibbutzim over the border while their fighters sneaked into Israel, killed three soldiers and kidnapped two others, expecting to then trade prisoners with Israel. Unusually, neither the Israeli Prime Minister nor its defence or foreign ministers had military backgrounds. 'They will want to show they have balls,' explains a friend of Levy Willard's. So Israel used the kidnapping as the excuse it needed to launch a long-prepared war plan, dubbed 'Operation Exterminator', for the destruction of Hizbollah.\n\nDuring the following 33 days, more than 1,500 people were killed, two-thirds of them Lebanese civilians. The aerial bombardment left Lebanon in ruins and on the verge of civil war and the Israeli military's reputation badly damaged, as it failed to dislodge Hizbollah and regain its captured soldiers. Hizbollah, whose weaponry and tactics far exceeded Israeli expectations, was politically strengthened. As Levy Willard puts it, having spent time under the whistling Katyusha rockets: 'this is not a band of suicidal terrorists in scruffy jeans who squabble among themselves'.\n\nLevy Willard interviewed Israeli commandos on a 48-hour leave from combat. 'Some of the soldiers chose to injure themselves so that they wouldn't have to go back ... some fell down stairs deliberately in the hope of breaking a bone.'\n\nSummer Rain is partly a parody of the machismo of war reporting - Levy Willard has to argue with her children to let her go to the front line. It also includes intriguing apercus on modern warfare - the general who secretly sells his stock portfolio, the war photographer caught 'Photoshopping' more dead babies into his pictures, a song said to be popular with teenage Israelis: 'Our Country is Crap But It's the Only One We Have'.\n\nAll this captures how fluid political opinions have become with modern media coverage. At first, many of the Israeli Arabs living in Haifa were on the side of their government, but as images of the devastation in Lebanon were fed back by satellite TV, this changed. Ditto many non-Arab Israelis. Novelist David Grossman, whose son was killed in the conflict, made a powerful speech in Tel Aviv months later, stating: 'We have discovered in this war that military power cannot ultimately guarantee our existence.' On Israeli TV, an amateur video was screened showing an officer telling exhausted soldiers about the terrorists they will face in Lebanon. 'Why call them terrorists?' says one of his men. 'They are soldiers like us.'\n\nOn 16 August, a UN-brokered ceasefire was implemented and both sides declared victory. 'The military offensive has eliminated Hizbollah's state within the state of Lebanon,' claimed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. He subsequently survived an inquiry into the war's failings by the skin of his teeth.\n\nAccording to Gilbert Achcar and Michel Warschawski's The 33-Day War, a poll of the 'Arab street' conducted after the war found that Hizbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah was the most popular political figure in the region. The most unpopular figure, President Bush, had broadcast his private beliefs by mistake six days into the conflict. The US government was refusing to join the EU and UN in calling for a ceasefire, saying Israel must be allowed to root out the 'A-team of terrorists'. Then, in his 'Yo Blair' conversation, Bush set out a road map for the UN to end the conflict. 'What they need to do is get Syria to get Hizbollah to stop doing this shit and it's all over ...'\n\nThe degree of ignorance in Bush's formulation is made clear in this dry but penetrating book. The self-proclaimed pacifist academics (one from Lebanon, one from Israel) paint a picture of an exceptionally complex and politically fluid Lebanon, the most religiously and ethnically mixed country in the region, racked by a 15-year civil war. Hizbollah was born in this period and became the force best equipped to resist Israel's occupation of the country's south, eventually driving them out in 2000.\n\nAlthough Hizbollah is funded by Iran and Syria and receives its armaments via the Syrian border, it is a broadly independent organisation which runs schools, hospitals and social services in south Lebanon and enjoys huge support there, not only among the Shias, Lebanon's largest sect. Hizbollah enjoys far greater autonomy and popular support than characterised in the neocon world view.\n\nLooking at Israel, the authors draw the controversial conclusion that its recent military failings and willingness to kill Lebanese civilians stem from the same source: a 'colonial' inability to respect their adversary. In former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's words, Israel is 'the modern and prosperous villa in the jungle' of the Middle East, and Israel now formulates its fight for survival as a battle of civilisation versus brutality. This concept is used to justify the apparent imbalance in the value of Arab and Israeli life, which, incidentally, cuts both ways. Hence 429 Hizbollah prisoners were exchanged for one kidnapped Israeli businessman in 2004 and in last summer's conflict, the civilian body count was 1,070 Lebanese and 43 Israelis.\n\nAccording to this book, Barak's 'civilisation' analysis seems to have been bought wholesale by Washington and by Tony Blair in the wake of 9/11. Blair, somewhat incredibly now a Middle East peace envoy, described the fighting last year as part of an ongoing struggle between 'democracy and freedom' against an 'arc of extremism right across the region'. Something which ignores the fact that popular feeling in the Middle East, as expressed democratically in the election of Hamas, supports so-called 'extremism'.\n\nWhile Hizbollah leads the reconstruction effort in south Lebanon and digs a new set of fortifications, and Israel tops up on bunker-busters ready for the next round, both of these fine books make it clear that the region's increased stock of fear is keeping no one safe."
