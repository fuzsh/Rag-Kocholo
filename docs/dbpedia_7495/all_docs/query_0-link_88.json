        "text": "Today’s “What’s On My Bookshelf” features a young adult author we love, Josh Berk. In addition to working as a children’s librarian, Josh wrote the edgy and funny mystery, THE DARK DAYS OF HAMBURGER HALPIN, as well as the upcoming GUY LANGMAN, CRIME SCENE PROCRASTINATOR, which Kirkus raved about, saying, “Hilarious wit and serious gloom blend seamlessly as Guy wades through the year after his dad’s death…Guy’s running inner monologue is sharply observational, sardonic, funny and sad…Best friend Anoop and other peers are freshly unusual, not recycled character types.”\n\nThese are the bookshelves in my home library. Every room in my house is sort of a library (and my workplace is a literal library) but this is the prettiest shelf. That’s entirely due to my wife’s work. She’s the one with style. If it was up to me I’d probably live in some sort of hovel. A hovel with bookshelves of course, or at least a bucket of books. I love books! And also buckets. The decorating I cannot take credit for, but the book selection is mostly me. I do see one of my son’s books in there — the Cars “Look & Find.” I swear that’s not mine. OK, sometimes I look at it. Why are you so hard to find, Mater-in-a-fire-hat?!?!\n\nIt’s not to easy to title-snoop from this picture so I will tell you that they are basically in four categories: art books, baseball books, comic books, and young adult novels. Oh yes, there are also some other fancy books by people like Tennyson & Longfellow. If those books had a Dewey number, it would be 000, as in the chance I will ever read them. I totally have read “Remembrance of Things Past” by Marcel Proust though. Great read. I totally recommend picking it up.\n\nAll the comics and baseball books have been read. That book by Don Zimmer is actually autographed. So is the umpire one, by Bruce Weber. Actually a ton of these books are autographed. My parents both were librarians for many years & they went to ALA whenever they could. Which is why I have some awesome autographs from legends such as Avi, Virginia Hamilton, and Norma Fox Mazer. That one actually says “To Julie,” whoever that is. (Just kidding, that’s my sister. I hope she doesn’t read this and find out I stole her Norma Fox Mazer…)\n\nA lot of the other autographs are from people I’m proud to call my friends: Cyn Balog, A.S. King, Shaun Hutchinson, Jon Skovron, and Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich to name a few. I have a copy of STARGIRL autographed by Jerry Spinelli, but we’re not friends (though once I did pretend we were to try to impress a stranger for some reason). I have some Kurtis Scaletta & Steve Brezenoff up there, though I don’t think those two are signed. Thanks a lot, dudes.\n\nIf you asked me to pick a favorite book from these, I would have to say that is impossible. As Proust said, “Each book is a masterpiece of love and the admiration for each is whole.” (Just kidding, he never said that. I totally never read that book.)"
