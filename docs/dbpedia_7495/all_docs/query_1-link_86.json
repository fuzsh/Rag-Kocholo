        "text": "Finally, when her husband becomes angry and starts to scolds her, she chooses to endure it. Although she knows that her job is no less valuable than her husband’s job, she does not refute him. Her choice avoids many unnecessary quarrels between her and her husband. She is the first and only person to say, “I love you.” (Gilb,360) in the entire story. She loves her husband and her family deeply. According to a research in psychology today, Barton Goldsmith mentions that “Mothers are the emotional backbones of the family.” (Goldsmith, P6) Obviously, she provides the holding place for everyone’s feelings and does her best to keep them from being and getting hurt.\n\nA main point in what she is doing and where she ends up getting hurt the most is trying to make her parents care more about her. You can tell all she wants wants is appreciation for what's she does but when they don’t even notice her she ends up working harder. When they do pay a little attention to her she works really hard to be able to have that moment with them again. But they sometimes unfairly blame her for stuff she didn't\n\n“She was a girl who’d lost her brother, and someone had led her to believe I did it, and in anguish she had tracked me down. If I’d been in her place, would I have done anything differently?”Maria Lu p. 230. This quote shows the ways that Day has grown because of his experience while he was with June. At First , he felt anger while he was June because she betrayed him. However, after making an effort to empathize with her he comes to understand why she treated him the way she did. He also begins to see what he has common with the girl he believes is his enemy. Near the end of the book June finally understand why Day means so much to her and how she can’t let him go, he reminds her of her brother.\n\nThis type of upbringing would lead one to believe that her life would not amount to anything and torn by the fact that she was not residing with her family. However, subconsciously, when she needed reassurance, her paternal mother’s words to her would always surface in her mind, “Sunshine, you’re my baby and I’m your only mother, but you must obey the one taking care of you but she is not your mama”.\n\nMothers are pictured as the care giver of the families and the ones who love their children unconditionally no matter the situation. They’ll do anything to support their family and raise their children right. In “The Queen of Mold” by Ruth Reichl, the mother in the story is pictured as the one who makes a meal almost out of nothing, just to provide and have something on the table for her family. Even though the food she cooks is moldy, this is how she demonstrates her motherly love.. In “Everyday Use” by Alice Walker, the mother is portrayed at first as an over excited mother waiting for her over achieving daughter Dee. As the story progresses the excitement for the daughter starts to go away and her motherly love towards Dee becomes complicated because Dee thinks she is greater and much smarter than the rest. Both of the stories depict complex motherhood, in Reichl story her mother’s love becomes complicated when she cooks food for the guest and her daughter tries to save the guest from being killed, while by the end of Walker story she only has love for the one daughter that has always been by her side and that’s Maggie.\n\nThrough humorous comments, the mother paints a picture of what she is thinking, and allows the audience to see her as she is, and not as the world and those around her perceive her to be. Specifically the mother describes the characters appearance, and actions, as well as offers analogies, such as mothers on T.V. To support her view of reality, or how things really were, in her opinion. As the story progressed, she reveals cultural differences between Mama, Maggie and Dee. Walker also points out the importance of respecting your immediate heritage such as parents, and other family, and truly knowing and internalizing the real meaning of racial\n\nMama resembles an individual who has high hopes for her children no matter what they have given to her in return. Mama is a “large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands” (109). In addition, Mama “can kill and clean a hog as mercilessly as a man” (109). Mama’s other house was burned to the ground and she can sometimes she can “still hear the flames” (110). In addition, Mama goes through many hard times, but she always stays strong so she can be a wonderful mother to her kids. Mama is a strong, loving mother who is willing to do anything for her children.\n\n“Tuesday of the Other June” is a short storynovel written by Norma Fox Mazer. The main character, June T, is a modest girl who only lives with her mother in a small town. But one day, she meets a bully named June M who bullies her excusing that she has the same name. This story clearly tells about bullying, and that the author believes that “You should stand up for yourself to stop bullying.”\n\nWhat a loving mother! Lena Younger, or Mama, is nurturing and supportive when it comes to raising and maintaining a family. Personally speaking, being nurturing means to love, care for, and show concern over someone. Analyzing Mama’s relationships with family members can show us her view on parenting and ultimately show us her devotion to her family. In A Raisin in the Sun, by Lorraine Hansberry, Mama is a nurturing mother who cares for and protects her family in her struggle to keep them unified.\n\nMothers are great people to have in young children’s lives. Maggie’s and Dee’s mother kills cows for them to have food on the table. She makes sure she can cook and be strong for her daughters. No matter what problem they have, their mama makes sure they are safe. Their Mama and mine share the similarities of how hardworking our mothers are. Since I am the first child, it was just me and my mother in one apartment where she worked two jobs to make a living. Then when my sister came along, my mother went back to college to get a better job. She put us before herself and she was just 30 years old. The mother in “Everyday Use” has a favorite child, and it is Dee. The difference between my mother and Dee’s mother is that my mother did not have a favorite. My mother treated her daughters with equal respect and equal amounts of\n\nMama, however, is strong, spiritual and eager to help her children in any way she can. She values family above and beyond all else, but has the deep insight into the other character's motivations even when she doesn't agree. In the middle of the play (at the fuse for the final conflict), she recognizes that Walter is miserable because no one believes in him and his dreams. She gives him a large chunk of the insurance check to invest in a liquor store even thought she doesn't agree with it. She trusts him with it and, when he loses the money to a \"trusted friend,\" she becomes enraged and begins to physically attack him. However, by the next scene she has forgiven him and tells her daughter that she should do the same; \"There is always something to love: when do you think the time is to love somebody the most? It's when he's at his lowest and can't believe in hisself 'cause the world done whipped him so!\" With those words, Mama seems to symbolize all that is good, solid and peaceful in the world.\n\nIn return, Mrs. Young is a wonderful mother; she has suffered and sacrificed for her children. She always explains and lesson to her children instead of making them feel guilty. The Young family starts running into problems when Mrs. Young (Mama) receives about ten thousand dollars from life insurance of her husband. With a poor family likes Young, ten thousand dollars is really a dream, it is a huge amount of money that they could never get for all of their life. The children start fighting over the money; every one has his/her own reason to use that money. Mama must figures out how to keep the family in peace and together. Mama deeply believes in God and lives her life in \"cultural and ethnic pride\". She usually talks about how her generation has won its freedom and proud to be able no longer be slaves. At the end of the play, even she failed to convince Walter not to put the money in the liquor store but she made her commitment, she has what she has fought for all of her life, her family now all together in love, happiness and forgiveness.\n\nA mother is someone who can take the place of all others but no one can take the place of her. There are many different definitions you could use to describe your mother. My mother, Pam Krull, fits every one of those. Today I decided to pick the three that I thought was most important to me. I admire and aspire to be like my mother because of how supportive, how selfless, and how loving she is."
