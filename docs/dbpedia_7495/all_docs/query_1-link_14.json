        "text": "The family is a potent web, linking the fortunes of one generation with anther's, Of all the linkages in that web, the one between child and grandparent is often the strongest. In “A Figure of Speech” Jenny Pennoyer loves her Grandpa, and finds it tough to get along with ‐the rest of her family. This is hardly surprising, considering what a selfish lot they are. Grandpa lives in the basement, which is damp, but at least it keeps him out of the way.\n\nJill Paton Walsh is the author of “Fireweed,” “Goldengrove” and the forthcoming “Toolmaker.”\n\nOnly Jenny visits with him. Too often her Another says, “You ought to like being with your family a. little more.” But Jenny feels closest to Grandpa; he is her family. Unlike the others, she doesn't mind if he tells the same story over and over. Also, she is horrified at their fussy and humiliating attitude to. ward him.\n\nThe crisis comes when Jenny's brother drops out of college and comes home with a young wife, and the couple look covetously at Grandpa's basement apartment. A small fire on his cooking stove gives the family their chance, and they move him upstairs to share a bedroom with Jenny's teen‐age brother —where Grandpa is even more in the way.\n\nWhen the old man asserts himself by running away, back to his remembered past, Jenny goes with him to share the last days of his life. “Didn't suffer a bit,” say her parents, talking abOut his death. “A real comfort to us that he went so easily.” But then they have a cozy figure of speech to cover up the truth about anything.\n\nThe Pennoyer family could have prevented what happened to their Grandpa; the Taliaferro family in “Changes” cannot help what happens to theirs. Loving and caring deeply, they are defeated by illness and poverty. Grandpa goes blind. Then his wits begin to wander. Since Chris is too young to leave school and his widowed mother must work, there is nobody at home to look after Grandpa. It is decided he must go into a home. At first Chris visits him, but in the end he is defeated by the depressiveness of the place. When Grandpa dies, Chris hasn't been to see him for a long while.\n\nBoth these books, written in a quiet, remorselessly realistic style, are infused with a deeply felt compassion and humanity. And yet neither quite rises to the importance of its subject Death is always a mystery; when it comes it is a cataclysmic finality. Rightly perhaps, the authors concentrate on those aspects of aging that can be avoided. (Families don't have to be cruel. Old people's homes don't have to repel.) The authors tell us about dying rather than about death. “If we'd thought of it in time, we might have saved him,” says Jenny's mother. But the truth is that no one can be saved from death—either his own, or another's. Children, too, must face this;\n\nNorma Mazer in “A Figure of Speech” comes closest to the heart of things. The death of Grandpa in “Changes” is merely a message on the telephone, a disembodied sort of death, while “A Figure of Speech” offers us an image of death itself: an old man lying in the attitude of sleep on the wet grass under an apple tree."
