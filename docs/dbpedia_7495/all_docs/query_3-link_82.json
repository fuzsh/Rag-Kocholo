        "text": "If you are a gamer, you might be familiar with Marc LeBlanc, a principal creator of OASIS. LeBlanc teaches Game Design Tuning Workshops at games conferences where he breaks down his theory that designers need to be more specific about the kinds of fun they build into games. He describes eight specific kinds of fun, noting most games do not provide all eight.\n\nI wonder if some attention to kinds of fun might enliven the chapter book I am revising? Lately I have been tuning and finetuning my manuscript and I think Marc LeBlanc’s eight kinds of fun might provide another lens through which to view both the narrative and the experience of reading it.\n\nSo here they are. Marc LeBlanc’s eight kinds of fun and how I think they could inject more flavor/interest/pizzazz? into a novel writing project.\n\n1. Sensation – Games that evoke pleasure through sound, visuals, controller rumble or physical effort. In writing, I think our readers’ sensations are most piqued when we involve all the senses. Norma Fox Mazer used to tell her students, “Furnish your scenes.” This reminds me to write more than the visuals; to include smells, tastes, and tactile and audible descriptions too. I’ve heard the rule of thumb is that it takes a minimum of three senses bring a scene alive.\n\n2. Fantasy – Of course there is a whole genre of children’s fantasy – from The Wizard of Oz to Ursula LeGuin et al – but what about fantasy fun in “realistic” stories, like the quotidian world of my characters in 1932 California? Perhaps a journey into imagination is in order.\n\n3. Narrative – Because we use words to create a narrative, we have language itself to bring fun to the story. All the tools of wordplay are at hand, like puns, alliteration, onomatopoeia, metaphor and homophones; plus language itself in sentence construction, rhythm, dialogue, punctuation etc.\n\n4. Challenge – In game design, that’s creating challenges that escalate and draw the player deeper into the game. (No wonder gaming can become addictive.) We novel writers have a direct parallel: grab the reader with the drama of the story and raise the stakes right to the end.\n\n5. Fellowship – The game as a social framework. This makes me think of sci-fi and fantasy where world building, including modes of social interaction, is key to a game’s fun. But certainly any characters’ interactions bring fellowship to a story — especially when there is humor and empathy between characters, not to mention the fellowship between the characters and the writer – and the reader, too.\n\n6. Discovery – A game in which a player explores a world. Part of the fun of creating any story is writing your way into another world. That’s one reason writing is so compelling. Hopefully readers get the same sort of discovery fun when they read their way in.\n\n7. Expression – a game in which the player’s choices allow for self-expression. Choose Your Own Adventure stories work this way. But any written work is dependent on what the reader brings to the page. Hmmm.\n\n8. And finally, Submission – The game as a pastime – i.e. games that have “farming” or “grinding” as core elements. Writing itself is sometimes a fun pastime, and, when we get it right, our books offer the very real, very fun pastime of reading.\n\nSo game’s on. Let’s have all kinds of fun.\n\n– Laura Kvasnosky\n\nI HAVE MOVED from place to place inside our house today, seeking a quiet spot where I can write this. Outside, workers move ladders from window to window preparing our house for painting. Their process and mine are fairly incompatible. But I will persist…\n\nNOT LONG AGO, when our grandsons came for a sleepover, they brought along blueberries they had picked the day before with their parents.\n\nWe got busy making a pie, working together to roll out the dough and to fill it up. Right before we put it in the oven, I pointed out that it looked kind of patchy and homely — really not up to our usual best.\n\nAnd my oldest grandson said, “When I look at that pie, Nana, I don’t just see a pie. I see all that went into it. I see us picking blueberries yesterday and the long drive – over one hour each way – to the blueberry fields. And I see you putting the ingredients in the bowl and us stirring it up and rolling it out.”\n\nAt age six he had already internalized an outlook that I am still trying to embrace at 72.\n\nNot that I don’t get a lot of practice. You can’t make children’s books without a big appreciation for process. It takes lots of research, study, reading, sketching, pondering, writing and rewriting to create work that may, in the end, look kind of patchy and homely. I’m not complaining, because despite the uncertainty of the final product, I have the compensation of spending lots of time in the seductive hum of the creative zone. (Or is that my husband sanding on the other side of the wall? Argh.)\n\nIn any case, when I find myself feeling disappointed with the outcome of my creative endeavors, I remember that blueberry pie.\n\nIt was delicious.\n\nI am a big fan of Dolly Parton. And not just because of the video she made while getting her Covid shot to the tune of her song Jolene, lyrics reworked to “Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine…” Under her fancified outer self beats a heart that’s true.\n\nIn 1995 she launched a formidable effort to raise literacy in Sevier County, Tennessee, where she grew up: The Imagination Library. Since its inception, this book-gifting program has mailed monthly high-quality books to children from birth to age five, no matter their family’s income.\n\nThe program grew quickly and now serves children in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and Ireland. As of January 2022, 174 million books had been gifted. Wow.\n\nThe books are chosen by committee and purchased in wholesale agreement with Penguin Random house. My sister Kate and I were lucky to have our book SQUEAK! included in the Imagination Library. And this year the Dollywood people created an English/Spanish edition of ISLAND LULLABY for distribution.\n\nAs you probably know, Dolly’s main gig is not literacy. She is a memorable performer and remarkable composer, known for having written Jolene and And I Will Always Love You on the same day. A ten-time Grammy winner, Dolly says, “I take myself more serious as a songwriter than anything else. I always say I’ve written about 3,000 songs and three good ones, but I just love the joy of writing.”\n\nNow Dolly writes books, too. Monday, March 7, she and author James Patterson co-released Run, Rose, Run, a novel about navigating the music industry in Nashville. The previous Friday she had released her latest studio album with the same title.\n\nI think it was on an American Idol show where she was the guest coach that I heard her advise a contestant, “Figure out who you are and do it on purpose.” That has sure worked for Dolly.\n\nEach month, Julie Paschkis, Laura Kvasnosky, Bonny Becker, Julie Larios and I meet at one of our houses, around one of our tables, to review and critique each other’s work. We also share news, thoughts, stories, quandaries and lunch (or brunch) and tea. As most of you already know, this blog evolved out of our working friendship.\n\nEach year, we exchange gifts for the holidays – small things, often items we have made ourselves, sometimes souvenirs from places we have visited in the past year.\n\nBut the greatest gift we give each other isn’t at these yearly holiday gatherings; it is what we give each other each time we meet, and often in between. We give our eyes, ears, brains and trust. It has been many years since I joined this group (around 2002) and it started ten years before that. A few members have come and gone (and come back again). We started blogging together in January of 2012. Between the five of us, we have published 69 books and 309 blog posts. Geez.\n\nThere have been a lot of thoughts and ideas shared around our tables. I am forever grateful for the excellent input and feedback I have received over the years – and that is not to discount in any way the friendships we have developed.\n\nIf you have a professional critique group like ours, you know how valuable it is. If you don’t and wish you did, find a few open-hearted individuals whose work you respect see if they are amenable to starting a children’s book group with you. Maybe you will find a good group if you take a picture book writing or illustration class or workshop (that is how this group got started). It helps if you are all at a similar place with your writing and/or illustration careers.\n\nBest wishes for a creative and productive new year!\n\nLast month I confessed to a bout of nerves before starting on a new picture book project. I have gained some calm as I have delved into defining the imagery for the book. I am no longer on the shore. I am wading in.\n\nOf the two primary characters in the book (a dog and a child), it is the dog that I have been working on the most so far.\n\nI have a dog. He is a rat terrier. My initial drawings for Lily were based on him.\n\nBut they were rejected for not being cute and cuddly enough. I admit, Nik is a bit angular and bony and he doesn’t have much of a tail.\n\nSo I drew a dog very unlike Nik; a furry pooch with a more expressive tail (as I showed you in my last post).\n\nThat Lily thankfully got the go-ahead.\n\nEven though Lily the dog appears in less than half of the imagery, I want to be sure of what she looks like and how she moves. The best way for me to do this is to draw lots of character studies. This is how I familiarize my brain with characters so that I can draw them without having to actually see them. I mostly draw characters from my imagination and then seek reference to augment the drawings. It may seem like an ass-backwards approach, but it’s how I feel most comfortable working.\n\nI have drawn a lot of children. Usually I do about five to ten studies per character before starting on illustrations for a book. But I have not drawn a lot of dogs, so I set myself a goal of one hundred Lily drawings. Here are a few of them.\n\nAfter I had drawn about seventy imaginary Lilies, I thought it was time to find a real dog to look at. Then one day, while walking in the park with Nik, I met Romeo.\n\nI introduced myself to Romeo’s family and they let my take photos of him. Those pictures helped get me up to my three-digit goal.\n\nNow I feel like I know this Lily. She becomes more real to me, each time I draw her.\n\nThe Library of Congress is one of those things that you feel you know—because you’ve said the words all your life—but then you realize you don’t really know that much about it.\n\nOne of my sisters recently sent me a link that I want to share, but first a bit about the library gleaned from the web. It’s the largest library in the world. According to its website “its collections are universal, not limited by subject, format, or national boundary, and include research materials from all parts of the world and in more than 450 languages. Two-thirds of the books it acquires each year are in languages other than English.”\n\nOfficially, it’s the research library for the United States Congress and it’s the oldest federal cultural institution in the U.S. It includes the Center for the Book which supports the Young Readers Center and the Poetry and Literature Center, which promote books, reading and libraries.\n\nAnd it does lots of amazing things including scanning and posting this wonderful collection of classic children’s books: http://read.gov/books\n\nMost of the books are from the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s. It’s fun to see how kids books have changed.\n\nI love this one–The Children’s Object Book published in the 1880s.\n\nI instantly thought of Richard Scarry books.\n\nThe objects have changed, the art style has changed, the sheer volume of stuff has changed—but kids still like to look at and identify the objects of their world.\n\nThe book collection is heavy on fairy tale and folk tale collections, Mother Goose and lots of rhyming. Some of it pretty tortured.\n\nBut it’s fun to see “concept” books like The Rocket Book by Peter Newell, 1912, being played around with early on in children’s publishing. Another concept book, Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures for Young and Old, published in 1896, encourages kids to use their imaginations with inkblots.\n\nOf course, it instantly brings to mind the Rorschach test. So out of curiousity I googled it to see how the dates matched up. The Rorschach test wasn’t developed until the 1960s, but interpreting blobs of ink started much earlier. According to Wikipedia, “Justinus Kerner invented this technique when he started accidentally dropping blots of ink onto paper due to failing eyesight. Instead of throwing them away, he found that intriguing shapes appeared if he unfolded the papers. He elaborated these shapes into intricate cartoons and used them to illustrate his poems.” This was in the 1850s.\n\nThe collections features work from some big name illustrators like Arthur Rackham:\n\nAnd N.C. Wyeth\n\nAnd W.W. Denslow:\n\nThere are also early versions of what I would call “franchise” books (like Disney’s Winnie the Pooh books.) There’s a long chapter book about Peter Rabbit called Mrs. Peter Rabbit from 1919. They don’t claim this is Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit, but still the name serves its purpose.\n\nIn this case, Peter Rabbit, after many adventures finds his true love, gets married and has kids.\n\nPart of what I love about this on-line collection is the clarity of the reproductions. The pages show the wear and tear of the years and the hands they passed through.\n\nIt reminds me of the books I read from my family bookshelves as a kid. Many of them dating back to the turn of the century. I remember the tattered covers, the soft, yellowed pages and their musty smell; the occasional colored illustration on it’s own page of slicker, whiter paper. Sometimes there was onion paper between the illustration page and the next page of text. All of this shows up in the Library of Congress’s collection. So the experience of these books will be saved for generations to come.\n\nIf you want to check out the Library itself and all it has to offer you can here: https://www.loc.gov\n\nLast week I returned to House of Illustration to see their current show – A New Childhood: Picture Books From Soviet Russia.\n\nIt is an excellent, eye-opening exhibit. I snapped a few subversive shots to share with you.\n\nBefore the October Revolution of 1917, children’s books were beautifully illustrated but expensive. Only children of the upper classes were regularly taught to read. Children’s books were not for the masses.\n\nIvan Bilibin, 1895\n\nAfter the end of the Tsarist regime, fairy tales were considered irrelevant. Children were reimagined as “builders of the new egalitarian future.” New children’s books would promote socialist beliefs and give practical instruction.\n\nGalina and Olga Chichagova, poster design with text by A. Galena, 1925.\n\n“The images of old storybooks. Out with the mysticism and fantasy of children’s books!! Give a new children’s book!! Work, battle, technology, nature – the new reality of childhood.\n\nOn the positive side, during this time there was a blossoming of creativity in children’s literature. The influence of folk art as well as past art movements and picture books from Europe converged in these new books.\n\nEduard Krimmer, How the Whale Got His Throat (Rudyard Kipling) 1926.\n\nIllustrators explored new styles and techniques. The Soviet government lifted a Tsarist ban on Yiddish publishing.\n\nIssachar Ber Ryback for In The Forest (Leib Kvitko) 1922.\n\nBooks were considered valuable tools in disseminating new ideals. Publishers flourished.\n\nEduard Krimmer, Numbers, 1925\n\nVera Ermolaeva, Top-Top-Top (Nikolai Aseev), 1925\n\nAbsurdism proved useful in communicating the regime’s ideas.\n\nIllustrations for The Flea (Natan Vengrov) by Iurii Annenkov, c. 1918\n\nKonstantin Rudakov’s work was humorous and zany, but considered “bourgeois dregs” by Nadezhda Krupskaya, noted theorist and Lenin’s wife. Some of his books were banned.\n\nKonstantin Rudakov, Telephone, 1926\n\nPicture books would show children how to build the future.\n\nEvgenia Evenbakh, The Table, 1926\n\nAleksandr Deineka, Electrician (B. Uralski), 1930\n\nTevel Pevezner, The Cow Shed (Evgeny Shvartz), 1931\n\nTevel Pevezner, The Poultry Yard (Evgeny Shvartz), 1931\n\nGeorgii Echeistov, What It Carries Where It Travels, 1930\n\nUnknown illustrator, First Counting Book (F. N. Blekher), 1934\n\nThe circus was still popular, but the Lion was no longer portrayed as King of the beasts. Instead he was President.\n\nMaria Siniakova, Circus (Nikolai Aseev), 1929\n\nVladimir Lebedev, Circus (Samuil Marshak) 1925\n\nSome illustrators were still determined to show children at play and having fun. Some got away with it.\n\nVladamir Konashevitz, unpublished illustration for Pictures For Little Ones, 1925\n\nVladamir Konashevitz, Mugs, 1925.\n\nOthers delved further into the new reality of childhood.\n\nAleksandr Deineka, The Red Army Parade, 1930\n\nThe atmosphere of experimentation ended in the mid-1930s when “socialist realism” became the assigned aesthetic ideal. Children’s books could only support Soviet approved aspirations. State censorship was enforced. Yiddish publishing was no longer tolerated and high taxes caused many Russian publishers to close. Many illustrators continued to work but ceased experimenting. Some fled to Europe. Others were arrested.\n\nI visited Soviet Russia when I was a child in 1970. What I remember most about Moscow was how bleak it was. Saint Basil’s Cathedral rose like a glorious fantasy out of the concrete. Everything else, including the people, was grey and heavy. Our guide was afraid to answer any of our questions. People spoke to us in whispers if they spoke to us at all. They were the children who had grown up under the Soviet regime.\n\nFor those of you who aren’t able to make it to London to see this show before it closes in September, you can look for the book, Inside the Rainbow, Russian Children’s Literature 1920-1935: Beautiful books, terrible times, which inspired House of Illustration to exhibit works from this collection.\n\nWhile researching for my last post, Gwen White’s Pictorial Perspective, I discovered that she had written and illustrated other books as well. That led to research into whether I could buy any of them. Most were not available or beyond my budget, but I did find one copy of White’s A Book of Toys that was affordable. Gwen White and toys. I bought it based on that combination, and the cover, without knowing anything about the interior contents.\n\nI am happy to report that the book is as wonderful as I’d hoped. The images are simple and grand at the same time. The writing is straightforward yet playful. This is part of our heritage as children’s book illustrators and authors.\n\nI want to share it with you here and I couldn’t decide what to leave out so I have scanned the entire book. It feels an appropriate companion piece to my earlier posts on A Book of Pictorial Perspective and Folk Toys -les jouets populaires.\n\nI may have to go back to the London Museum and Kensington palace to see if any of the toys White has illustrated are still on exhibit. The museum at Bethnal Green is now the Victoria & Albert Museum of Childhood which I wrote about here.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed reading this little book as much as I have.\n\n(Maybe you figured this out already, but the Penguins on the cover aren’t just toys. The publisher is Penguin and the book is part of a King Penguin Books series)"
