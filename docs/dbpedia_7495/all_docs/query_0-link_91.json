        "text": "Synopsis\n\nA young boy describes his offbeat relationship with an unlikely friend during a difficult year in his life\n\n\"synopsis\" may belong to another edition of this title.\n\nFrom School Library Journal\n\nGrade 5-8-- Following A, My Name Is Ami and B, My Name Is Bunny (both Scholastic, 1987), this third book in Mazer's series features a male character. Cal is in high school, but he has never kissed a girl, he lacks skills for casual conversation, and he is about to be kicked off the basketball team. The source of his troubles seems to be that his father abandoned him and his mother years before. The two share a house with Garo, his best friend. Garo's father is a pilot and Cal's mother has been hired as housekeeper and stand-in mother for Garo. Although Garo is full of life and more fun to be around, the girls are attracted to the more sullen Cal, maintaining the teen romance tradition. When Cal's father shows up, Cal makes some attempts to open up and seems headed toward a hopeful future. Despite the fact that this novel features a male protagonist, it will most likely appeal to girls, especially those familiar with other of Mazer's works. Even among her ardent fans, however, it's unlikely that the characterization and story line of this novel will receive more than a \"C\" rating. --Judie Porter, Media Services Center, Portsmouth School Department, RI\n\nCopyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc."
