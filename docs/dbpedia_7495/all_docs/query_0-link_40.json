        "text": "Vermont College of Fine Arts’ Hunger Mountain (n14, 2009) features a section on Young Adult and Children’s Literature that includes Katherine Paterson’s keynote speech at VCFA, October 2008 (“Fellow Travelers”), Liz Cook’s winning entry for the 2009 Katherine Paterson Prize for Young Adult and Children’s Writing (Crazy Cat), and Janet S. Wong’s discussion with examples of the Poet’s Process.\n\nThe Hunger Mountain web site includes a full-content section on Young Adult and Chilren’s Literature, including a tribute to Norma Fox Mazer, essays on controversial issues (writing about sex and whether or not children’s poetry “matters”), discussions of female fairy tale characters, a tool box, fiction, poetry, and more."
