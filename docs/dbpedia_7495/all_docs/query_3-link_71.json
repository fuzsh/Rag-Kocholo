        "text": "Today is a wonderful day. Why you (probably don‚Äôt) ask? Because the cover for Gabrielle Moss‚Äôs ‚ÄòPaperback Crush‚Äô has been revealed and it‚Äôs even better than I could have possibly imagined it would be.\n\nThe cover has been designed by the talented Andie Reid Design with artwork commissioned by Ricky Mujica.\n\n‚ÄòPaperback Crush‚Äô has an expected release date of October 30, 2018 and is published by Quirk Books ‚Äì an excerpt is available on bustle.com! The book can be preordered at all the usual places!\n\nThis gorgeous book is a must-have for 80s and 90s YA and Middle Grade fiction fans ‚Äì I can‚Äôt wait to get my hands on it! üòç\n\nA big thank you to Sarah for letting me know about the cover reveal and to Cameon for initially bringing the book to my attention, you guys are awesome!\n\n[image credit: @andiereiddesign on Instagram]\n\nhttps://www.bustle.com/p/paperback-crush-by-gabrielle-moss-is-the-history-of-teen-lit-youve-always-wanted-to-read-excerpt-9265834/amp\n\nMORE ON INSTAGRAM: @retro_reads\n\nAs you can probably see, this page is transitioning. Posts and menus are being deleted, pages are getting moved and I‚Äôve even changed the site‚Äôs URL. What the hell am I doing, right? What started off as a simple blog is turning into a project which I am excited to announce!\n\nWith the help of some fine folk on Instagram, I am starting an online archive of 70s, 80s and 90s Young Adult, Middle Grade and selected Adult pulp fiction book covers. I‚Äôve been blown away with the amount of support I have so far received ‚Äì A big shout out to @SweetValleyBooks, @Yearling_Reads, @DirrtyPete, @90s__Love__Shop and @SweetheartsRB who have already submitted some book cover scans and everyone else who has expressed interest in helping out.\n\nWhy am I doing this? Quite simply, these covers are amazing! Sadly though, the books that these covers belong to are quickly being destroyed, disregarded and forgotten by many. A lot of these older paperback books which we hold dear are considered junk by most. A lot of them weren‚Äôt considered all that valuable to begin with ‚Äî they were cheaply produced mass market paperbacks which often had a short shelf life, never reprinted and destroyed if not sold.\n\nThrift shops and used bookstores often regard them as trash ‚Äì either because they get an influx of them or they are thought to be too dated and unsaleable. But to some of us they are special and collectable ‚Äì they evoke great memories and a good ol‚Äô dose of nostalgia.\n\nIt‚Äôs great that some of these older books which were long out of print are now available as retail ebooks or digitally archived by The Open Library, but many aren‚Äôt! This means that not only will the actual book be forgotten but so will it‚Äôs gorgeous cover. Many of these covers are stunning, with hand painted illustrations ‚Äî something you just don‚Äôt see anymore. I love the idea of being able to preserve a little piece of publishing history that may soon be forgotten.\n\nAlthough a lot of cover images are available online already, most are stock images from Amazon or online used bookstores and the image quality is terrible, especially as screen resolution on mobile devices and computer monitors keeps getting higher and higher. The plan is to scan the book covers and digitally enhance them where necessary to make them look as good as they once did when they were brand spanking new. Hopefully, then, if someone searches for a particular book, they will be able to have access to a hi res image. I am hoping to get cover images for all the main series (Sweet Valley, BSC, Fear Street etc) as well as images of books published by Scholastic, Bantam Skylark, Troll, Dell, Archway, Avon, Fawcett Juniper etc. I‚Äôm mainly interested in archiving the paperback covers with the exception of a few authors.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a project I can do alone and would love anyone and everyone to get involved if they can help out! Any images provided will be credited to you. Please let me know if you would like to get involved.\n\nThe 1970s was an interesting time in popular culture and my favourite era of fiction. In the 70s, YA really found it‚Äôs feet and blossomed ‚Äì the era is known as ‚ÄòGolden Age of Young Adult Literature‚Äô.\n\nThe sexual revolution of the late 1960s was reflected in an abundance of the literature of the time. Authors had a new freedom in what they could write about with many subjects being less taboo than they had been, previously. Young Adult fiction was often hard hitting and realistic, not straying away from topics such as sexuality, sexual assault and abuse, drug use, death, teenage pregnancy and other important topics to young people at the time. Sex and female sexuality was often discussed positively.\n\nInterestingly, Young Adult fiction seemed to change somewhere in the 1980s, becoming almost‚Ä¶ sanitised.\n\nThe Regan-era 1980s was quite a conservative decade compared to the 1970s. This was an era which saw America try and find its moral compass once again, which some might argue had been thrown out with the bong water sometime in the 1960s. (Those damn hippies! )\n\nTraditional American values seemed to be at the forefront of most Young Adult novels with sex not being as frequently or openly discussed ‚Äì at least not without dire consequences for any participants of the aforementioned activity. Oh and a healthy dose of good old slut shaming if she was female. The 80s was the start of the serialised young adult fiction boom (Ahh the 80s and its mass market consumerism) which lasted until the mid 1990s. This meant a lot more sub standard young adult fiction was churned out mostly with white, one dimensional, stereotypical characters and all about hetrosexual teen romance. These novels generally didn‚Äôt tackle any hard hitting subjects or particularly challenge readers. It definitely was a change in reading culture, for the worse.\n\nAs much as I love the 80s, purely for nostalgic value, I‚Äôm the first to admit that a lot of trash was published during this era. (But the covers were great!)\n\nHere, I‚Äôve selected a handful of book covers from the 1970s which I think are far out! Not particularly my favourites, but pretty groovy all the same. The covers aren‚Äôt as colourful and as attention grabbing as their 80s successors, but my goodness, those delicious fonts! What era of fiction is your favourite?\n\nPS. I would love any 1970s YA book recommendations, too!\n\nI couldn‚Äôt imagine being the kind of person who inspires and reaches out to so many people through my words and creativity. I‚Äôm a person who, although at times creative, is often stuck with the right words to say in any given situation. Judy Blume has managed to speak to and inspire millions with her countless novels for both middle grades and young adults. I was about 9 or 10 when I read my first Judy Blume novel (Tales of a 4th Grade Nothing) and from then on, I was hooked ‚Äì I had soon read her entire collection of works. This was pretty impressive for a kid who solely lived on a diet of Sweet Valley and The Baby Sitters Club. I was finally reading something real, something that spoke to me.\n\nEven as a child, I loved the way Judy wrote, her character dialogue was always so realistic and relevant. She was never theatrical or over the top. There was no flowery prose, there was no exhaling or dramatic musing and sometimes nothing much happened. But that was okay, this was everyday life. This is what we wanted to read about. We wanted truth. Her characters were often flawed, they didn‚Äôt always get their happy ending, but they always grew and with them, as readers, we did too. Judy was never patronising or spoke down to her reader. We were kids, sure, but she got it. We understood and felt things that other adults didn‚Äôt think we did. She expressed the things we were all thinking and feeling, for us. Judy was the ‚ÄòHashtag Relatable‚Äô for the kids of the 1970s and 1980s. Although I came to her books in the mid 1990s, these books were not only a comfort to me and a reassurance that I was normal, they were also nostalgic. Nostalgic, but never dated. Revisiting the books as an adult is never disappointing, but like putting on a favourite pair of slippers, ones that will always fit.\n\nWhat can I say about Judy Blumes middle grade novel, ‚ÄòBlubber‚Äô, that hasn‚Äôt already been said? A lot of people don‚Äôt like this book due to it‚Äôs unlikeable protagonist and the frank and realistic way which it portrays school yard bullying without any real consequences for the bullies. Sure, Jill (who is mainly a bystander in the books events and shows no sympathy toward the bullied girl Linda but occasionally partakes in the name calling) gets her comeuppance in the end when the tables are turned onto her, but the issue of bullying is never seriously addressed. Nor are the ringleaders punished. Jill had a lot of resentment toward Linda (for no apparent reason) and a strong dislike for her, partly due to Linda not sticking up for herself. This, I feel, shows that Jill has strong insecurities which aren‚Äôt really addressed in depth.\n\nThis book was written in the early 1970s where sayings like ‚ÄòBoys will be boys‚Äô and ‚ÄòSticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me‚Äô, were reinforced. Attitudes toward school yard bullying has since changed. Today if this book were written, it would more than likely address the psychological damage that schoolyard bullying can cause. The bullies would possibly face some repercussions. I think the author purposely didn‚Äôt include this in the novel, because let‚Äôs face it, often people do wrong and don‚Äôt see consequences or learn lessons ‚Äì but hey that‚Äôs the harsh reality of life. Maybe not the best message to convey in a children‚Äôs book, but a very realistic one. I suppose Jill learnt a lesson so that‚Äôs somewhat satisfying. Only as an adult re reading this book I understood what Blume was trying to subtly convey.\n\nAnyway, now that that‚Äôs out of my system, on to the covers! These are all of the English language covers that I could find prior to the year 2000, minus a couple of late 90s ones with photographs on the cover as opposed to painted artwork. Let‚Äôs face it, who wants to see those?"
