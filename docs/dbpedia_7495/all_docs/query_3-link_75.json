It is a simple story about five sisters. We get to know them individually and as a group. For me, five was about two too many. I couldn’t keep them straight. They go about their daily life, going to school, doing homework, etc.\n\nFinally, in Part II, one of the girls gets kidnapped. But, even that isn’t very exciting. She sits in a locked room all day while her kidnapper is at work. After a few days, she breaks a window and escapes on her own, which was good. Still, no very exciting to me."
