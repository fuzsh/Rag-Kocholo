However, Rachel Simmons not only remembered it, she decided to find out why it happened. Simmons found that not many people study the way girls bully each other, so she did just that. She wrote a book that discusses how girls bully, why they bully, and how to help. The goal of her writing this book seems not to be able to end bullying, but to be able to spread information. Before reading this book, most people would have had no idea about the different types of aggression, and how girls use these aggressions to bully one another. However, after reading the book, any reader would have much more knowledge on the topic of bullying.\n\nThe theme of \"All Summer in a Day\" by Ray Bradbury is that one shouldn't judge a person because they don't understand their inner struggles and are jealous of their experiences. The children do not know what Margot experienced with the Sun. They are jealous that Margot knows the Sun, but they only know of the Sun. The children end up disregarding her feelings and locking her in a closet during the nearly the most few precious hours of her life. Once they go out and see the Sun for two hours they understand how Margot feels empty without it. They go through a feeling of euphoria, as the narrator said, \"The children layout, laughing, on the jungle mattress, and heard it sigh and squeak under them, resilient and alive. They ran among the trees,\n\nSaturday Night and Sunday Morning is a novel following the rebellious life of twenty-two year old Arthur Seaton. Arthur spends his weekdays working at a bicycle factory and relaxes on weekends with plenty of drinks while in the company of various lady friends. The novel was written by Alan Sillitoe who came to be known as one of the “angry young men.” This group of writers was a dominant literary force during the 1950s and was immensely popular due to their accurate portrayal of postwar Britain and the working class. The angry young men produced a number of books (amongst other things) expressing their contempt with the class system, postwar welfare state and the lack of class change post war, the disdain of these issues are very prominent\n\nIt is important to read about bullying through fiction, like the book Eleanor and Park, because it helps the reader get a sense of what bullying is like and what it does to the person being bullied. Many teenagers go through the saame thing Eleanor went through, such as physical and emotional abuse, which is why bullying is relevant in the real world. Learning through fiction will give the students a better outlook on bullying and it will help them understand the importance of stopping bullying.

I think it’s very important for schools to teach students about bullying, and why everyone should be treated the way they want to be treated.

Mrs. Vickers told the young girl that she was going to call her\n\nFor my second book review, I chose to read Mothering Mother by Carol D O’Dell. After looking up this book on Amazon.com, I saw that this book was rated a 5 out of 5. In addition, I saw that reviews said that it was a funny book, and the previous book I read for this class was a little more serious than I would have liked. Another reason I chose this book was because other students I talked to in class seemed to enjoy the book.\n\nThe article looks at the different groups that are involved in bullying and how they affect the situation. Some are knowingly involved and participating in the act of bullying while others participate without even realizing it. The article shows a good understanding of the issue of bullying and informs the reader of what to look for and how to prevent it. The author helps us to understand the bully and what causes a person to bully, it also shows why some kids get bullied and how bystanders can contribute or prevent it.

We will create peer responsibility through peer intervention and will build a classroom culture that encourages team work and group support. Using this article the students will understand the implications of their actions and will know how to change the path of the bullied. They will understand how being a bystander also contributes to the situation.

On page 252, it says, “A dozen protesters carrying signs with messages like MY SON WAS A VICTIM and ENOUGH PAIN-START THE HEALING NOW! had walked out onto the field and were chanting slogans in front of the TV cameras...they sat down, linked arms, and refused to budge.” The text shows that bullying is an issue and both children and adults want it to stop. It goes with the theme because it shows that bullying is bad, it is an important topic, and we should try to end\n\nTuesday of the Other June is a story of bullying, and how June T., our main character, found a solution to end the bullying that didn’t involve tattling or violence.

Students enjoyed the open discussion portion of the assignment and were able to understand that there are more than one way to deal with bullying\n\n“The first program lesson given to the students included an explanation of work methods, class rules and exposing the problem of bullying” (Wilfer & Scheithauer, 2014). The following two classes were repeated lessons on addressing the issues of violence and moral courage, educating and sensitizing students for the repercussions of bullying (Wilfer & Scheithauer, 2014). The third module aimed to improve the student’s understandings of their personal feelings as well as others. They did this by forming a circle taking turns talking about situations were they felt angry, betrayed, or sad and why they felt this way. The following two classes approached the topic of social complexity of bullying by discussion about why it has been accepted. They also role-played in order to understand how it is to be the burlier and the victim (Wilfer & Scheithauer, 2014). The sixth module was repeated for six lessons that trained the students to consider other people’s perspective and how to empathize through role-playing and discussion. The seventh module taught the students about diversity and how it is important to respect other cultures,"
