        "text": "children's books Tender rays pierce darkness of lepers' hospital\n\nBy Claire Martin\n\nDenver Post Staff Writer\n\nAug. 30 - Mette Newth's \"The Dark Light,'' translated by Faith Ingwersen (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, $17), is extraordinary, a book that will open doors for anyone who's known someone with a terminal illness.\n\nIt is a stark, appalling and breathtakingly beautiful book about dying and living. That sounds pat, and the novel, set in an early 1800s Norwegian hospital for lepers, is anything but.\n\nThe 13-year-old narrator, Tora, has just been diagnosed with leprosy. She tells her story unflinchingly, in images that flash from awful to ephemeral.\n\nShortly after being brought to the hospital, still in a state of shock, Tora meets Mistress Dybendal, the viciously bitter adult daughter of a nobleman who disowns her after the Mistress' socially unacceptable diagnosis.\n\nIn a rage, the Mistress throws \"something so quickly that Tora didn't manage to shield herself from it. She caught it, and suddenly the Mistress's forefinger, as dry and gnarled as the bark of a dead tree, lay in her own hand.''\n\nThis is the wrenching introduction, which eventually leads to an unlikely alliance that is as much a contest of wills as it is a friendship. Desperate to learn to read, Tora can't comprehend why God inflicted this terrible disease on her and believes the answer lies in the Bible. She relentlessly makes the dying Mistress Dybendal so dependent on her that the older woman, indebted beyond tolerance, feels compelled to grant Tora's wish.\n\nNewth's portrait of the lepers' hospital is at once chilling and tender. She graphically illustrates the hospital's limitations - cold, chronically short of medicine and staff, with little food and less money - but she also shows how gently the poor and the dying care for one another, easing pains large and small.\n\nThere is buoyancy here as well as dread. There is no false hope for Tora or the others. Their eventual deaths are a given. That honesty allows Tora and the others to explore the darkest rooms of their hearts and soar on dazzling flights of the soul.\n\n\"The Dark Light'' is an aching story whose conclusion somehow leaves you feeling more purified than depressed. Tora's painful question is left to be answered by the reader. Is her death punishment or accident? Curse or blessing? Or something else entirely?\n\nNewth's book, direct and faithful, is the sort of powerful storytelling that belongs on every bookshelf, especially in the homes of families who have felt death's shadow.\n\nIn \"Leaving Home'' (HarperCollins, $10), stories selected by Hazel Rochman and Darlene Z. McCampbell offer 15 exceptional writers telling about other lifechanging personal journeys.\n\nSome are true and some have the ring of truth. Edward P. Jones' story of a 5-yearold who learns, on the first day of kindergarten, that her mother cannot read or write, may not be strictly autobiographical, but it is absolutely authentic.\n\nAmong the most muscular, and most candid, stories is Tim O'Brien's \"On the Rainy River.'' It's sort of a prelude to O'Brien's gripping books on the Vietnam War and reads like something from his diary. Drafted in June 1968, a month after graduating from college, O'Brien fought his first battle, internally, and its conclusion left him in tears.\n\nO'Brien was a liberal. He opposed this war. \"The problem, though, was that a draft board did not let you choose your war,'' he notes wryly. Twenty yards from freedom, he makes his decision. \"I was a coward,'' he writes. Did he go, or stay? You'll have to read it to find out.\n\nThis book speaks especially to readers teetering through the dicey years of adolescence. Most of the writers - Amy Tan, Sandra Cisneros, Norma Fox Mazer, Toni Morrison, Tim Wynne-Jones - may be of an age with the parents of those readers, but their memories of the chasm that gapes between childhood and adulthood are as clear and sharp as glass."
