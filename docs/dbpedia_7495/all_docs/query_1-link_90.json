        "text": "Alison Morris at ShelfTalker has a response to the movie of Beowulf that makes me feel that the world is an okay place to be again. I’ve been traveling the New York subway system against a backdrop of seemingly permanent Beowulf movie posters for what feels like half a year. I was convinced that the movie already came out in October and bombed, so you can imagine my surprise when I learned that it only came out last week or so. I know that Neil wrote it (initially) and all, but CGI high-heels do little for me.\n\nAll good little children know their Winsor McKay. Or they are at least passingly familiar with Little Nemo, appreciating the art even if the words themselves were a bit odd at times. Now from Spring Lake, Michigan (home of the artist himself) comes the blog Meeting McKay. It’s a cool little site with numerous links and bits of info regarding the man and his works. Right now it’s talking about what kind of memorial to make for the Mr. McKay. Statues are considered (tying nicely into my own statuary-centric post the other day) and how cool would it be to have a gigantic Gertie? I like the idea proposed by a commentator of making a statue of the man himself with his little characters running around his knees. Perhaps someone should sponsor this statue. When I’m rich I’ll do it myself, but until then anyone else can pick up the ball."
