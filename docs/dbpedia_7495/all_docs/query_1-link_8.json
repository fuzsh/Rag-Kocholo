The novel When We First Met was filmed for television by Home Box Office, 1984.\n\nWORK IN PROGRESS: Several novels; a short story.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: \"It's not hard to see why Norma Fox Mazer has found a place among the most popular writers for young adults these days,\" observed Suzanne Freeman in the Washington Post Book World. \"At her best, Mazer can cut right to the bone of teenage troubles and then show us how the wounds will heal. She can set down the everyday scenes of her characters' lives in images that are scalpel sharp,\" the critic continued, adding that \"what's apparent throughout all of this is that Mazer has taken great care to get to know the world she writes about. She delves into the very heart of it with a sure and practiced hand.\" New York Times Book Review contributor Barbara Wersba described Mazer as \"a dazzling writer\" who \"brings to her work a literacy that would be admirable in any type of fiction.\" For example, in A Figure of Speech, Mazer's story of an elderly man neglected by all of his family except his granddaughter, \"the fine definition of all characters, the plausibility of the situations and the variety of insights into motivation make [the novel] almost too good to be true,\" Tom Heffernan asserted in Children's Literature: Annual of the Modern Language Association Seminar on Children's Literature and the Children's Literature Association. \"There is no point at which it passes into an area of depiction or explanation that would exceed the experience of a young adolescent. But there is also no point at which the psychological perceptiveness and narrative control would disappoint an adult reader.\"\n\nBorn the middle daughter of three, Mazer grew up in Glens Falls, New York. Mazer noted in a Teen Reads interview that she taught herself to read when she was four or five and \"read voraciously from then on. The love of reading and stories perhaps led to my want to be a writer.\"\n\nMazer has been especially acclaimed for her young adult novels. She has written a number of award-winning and highly acclaimed books for young adults, some with her husband, critically acclaimed author Henry Mazer. Her characters are not always likable, but they are believable young people on the verge of adulthood struggling with issues of importance.\n\nMazer's short-story collections also have a broad appeal, as reviewers have commented about Summer Girls, Love Boys and Other Short Stories. Bruce Bennett, for instance, noted in the Nation that the collection \"is accessible to teenagers as well as adults. Most of the characters are young people,\" the critic elaborated, \"but Mazer writes about them with an affectionate irony that older readers will appreciate.\" Because Mazer \"has the skill to reveal the human qualities in both ordinary and extraordinary situations as young people mature,\" stated New York Times Book Review contributor Ruth I. Gordon, \"… it would be a shame to limit their reading to young people, since they can show an adult reader much about the sometimes painful rite of adolescent passage into adulthood.\" Strengthening the effect of Mazer's collections is that they are \"written specifically as a book, a fact which gives the stories an unusual unity and connectedness,\" related Bennett. \"Clearly, Mazer appreciates the short-story form, with its narrow focus and spotlit moments,\" commented a Kirkus Reviews writer about Dear, Bill, Remember Me? and Other Stories, \"where others might do up the same material as diluted novels.\"\n\nWhile she has earned praise for her forays into the short-story form, it is Mazer's novels that have brought her the most recognition, both with critics and readers. Taking Terri Mueller, for example, earned Mazer an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America although she had not intended it as a mystery. The book follows Terri Mueller and her father as they wander from town to town, never staying in one place for more than a year. Although Terri is happy with her father, she is old enough to wonder why he will never talk about her mother, who supposedly died ten years ago. An overheard discussion leads her to discover that she had been kidnaped by her father after a bitter custody battle. \"The unfolding and the solution of the mystery [of the truth about Terri's mother] are effectively worked,\" remarked a Horn Book reviewer; \"filled with tension and with strong characterization, the book makes compelling reading.\" Freeman similarly observed that despite the potential for simplifying Terri's conflict, \"Mazer does not take the easy way out in this book. There are no good guys or bad guys. There are no easy answers.\" The critic concluded, \"We believe in just about everything Terri does, because Mazer's writing makes us willing to believe. She wins us completely with this finely wrought and moving book.\"\n\nIn her Newbery Honor Book, After the Rain, Mazer returns to the subject of a elderly man dying; but in this instance, grandfather Izzy rebuffs his loving family, and granddaughter Rachel must exert herself to build a relationship with him. As it becomes clear to her that Izzy is dying and needs companionship, Rachel decides to regularly spend her free time with him. \"It's surprising that she should make such a decision,\" claimed Washington Post Book World contributor Cynthia Samuels, \"but once the reader accepts her choice and begins to join her on her daily visits with the crotchety old man, the story becomes both moving and wise.\" The result, continued the critic, is a book that \"deals with death and loss in an original and sensitive way.\" Carolyn Meyer, however, felt that there is a lack of tension in the story: \"you never really worry that Rachel won't do the right thing,\" she wrote in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. In contrast, a Kirkus Reviews critic suggested that \"what distinguishes this book, making it linger in the heart, are the realistic portrayals of the tensions, guilt, and sudden, painfully moving moments involved in Rachel's and Izzy's situations.\" As a Horn Book reviewer concluded, Izzy's \"harsh, rough personality [is] so realistic and recognizable that we feel we have known him and can understand the sorrow that overcomes Rachel. [After the Rain is] a powerful book, dealing with death and dying and the strength of family affection.\"\n\nWith the publication of Good Night, Maman, Mazer ventures into historical young adult fiction. The novel centers around twelve-year-old Karin, who must struggle to find freedom and begin a new life without her beloved mother. The Nazis have sent Karin's father to a prison in Poland and Karin, her brother, and her mother are in hiding in an attic. When they are told they must leave, the children head south. Karin and her brother eventually board a ship headed to America, but they must leave their ill-stricken mother behind. \"This moving World War II story is neither highly dramatic nor politically charged. It is the very personal and immediate experience of a young girl grappling with the loss of her old life and a new life that changes daily,\" explained Lauren Adams in Horn Book. A Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded, \"The strength of this novel lies in its intimate recognition of the way adolescents think and feel.\" Mazer explained in a Teen-Reads interview that writing historical fiction is difficult because you have to fit a fictional character into an actual event. \"I had to write this novel over completely four times, and this was because I was working out how to balance fiction and history,\" she remarked. To prepare to write the book, Mazer said, \"I read a fair number of books, most of them memoirs of people who had lived through the Holocaust. What struck me was that despite the numbing universality of that murderous time, each person's story, each survivor's story, was unique, distinct….my intention in writing this book was not to write history, but to write the unique history of an individual, albeit a fictional one.\"\n\nLike Good Night, Maman, Mazer's novel Girlhearts deals with a young girl's loss of her mother. Sarabeth Silver must deal with the loss of her mother, the only parent and family member she knows. Because she has no one else to turn to, Sarabeth must eventually track down her long-lost extended family members, who had turned their back on her mother when she became pregnant at sixteen. \"With a pitch-perfect intensity, Mazer captures the fractured sense of loss, of self, of time, that comes with a death in the family,\" explained GraceAnn A. DeCandido in Booklist. Writing in School Library Journal, Susie Paige noted, \"The theme of death and renewal is not a new one, but Mazer's characters deal with the process in a realistic, heartrending manner.\"\n\nMazer once told CA:\"I seem to deal in the ordinary, the everyday, the real. I should like in my writing to give meaning and emotion to ordinary moments. In my books and stories I want people to eat chocolate pudding, break a dish, yawn, look in a store window, wear socks with holes in them….\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nbooks\n\nAuthors and Artists for Young Adults, Gale (Detroit, MI), Volume 5, 1990, Volume 36, 2000.\n\nButler, Francelia, editor, Children's Literature: Annual of the Modern Language Association Seminar on Children's Literature and the Children's Literature Association, Volume 4, Temple University Press (Philadelphia, PA), 1975.\n\nChildren's Literature Review, Volume 23, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1991.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 26, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1983.\n\nHoltze, Sally Holmes, Presenting Norma Fox Mazer, Twayne (New York, NY), 1987.\n\nReed, Arthea J., Norma Fox Mazer: A Writer's World, Scarecrow Press (Lanham, MD), 2000.\n\nSt. James Guide to Young Adult Writers, 2nd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1999.\n\nTwentieth-Century Children's Writers, 3rd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1989.\n\nperiodicals\n\nBooklist, June 1-15, 1993, review of Out of Control, p. 1804; April 1, 1995, Merri Monks, review of Missing Pieces, p. 1388; September, 1997, Stephanie Zvirin, review of When She Was Good, p. 118; January 1, 1998, Bill Ott, \"Editors' Choice '97,\" p. 725; April 15, 1998, Stephanie Zvirin, \"What Grandparents Teach,\" p. 1445; August, 1999, Hazel Rochman, review of Good Night, Maman, p. 2053; November 15, 1999, Stephanie Zvirin review of When She Was Good, p. 613; June, 2000, Stephanie Zvirin, review of When She Was Good, p. 1875; July, 2001, GraceAnne A.
