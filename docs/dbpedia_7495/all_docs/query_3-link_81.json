        "text": "Who ever imagines they may hear themselves on the radio someday? I sure didn’t, but I recently heard my Covid-19 poem and a short essay aired on a program called Esoterica. It’s a feature focusing on the written word airing on WERU, Blue Hill, Maine’s community radio station. It happened this way.\n\nDuring April, New Hampshire’s Poet Laureate, Alexandria Peary, offered an online poetry workshop. We practiced mindful writing with relaxation exercises before beginning writing. We practiced sestinas, villanelles, and new revision techniques.\n\nAlex is an awesome teacher, and each session was focused on writing Covid-19 poems. How could we share our individual experiences of this global pandemic in poetry? Each NH poet was invited to submit three poems to a Covid-19 anthology to be published by Hobblebush Books. Entries would be read blind.\n\nA critique partner joined me in the class. We critiqued each other’s poems and focused on strengthening them. I wrote a villanelle -challenging. I tried a sestina- too challenging for me, but my poet friend succeeded! I wrote a haiku, turned it into a haibun, and that one was accepted for the anthology. Two of my friend’s Covid-19 poems were accepted for a separate anthology. Success!\n\nOn a tip from a Maine writer friend, I submitted a piece about the writing influences in my life to Esoterica, (thank you Wendy Kasten) and sent along one of my Covid poems from the online workshop. Both pieces aired on June 16.\n\nIt’s strange to hear my own voice. Of course, I get a preview of it whenever I record a new answering machine message. But hearing my voice speak for almost five minutes without my mouth moving is sort of surreal. I’m out of my own head, just listening, thinking ‘Who is this person? She doesn’t sound like me. Does she?’\n\nThere will be rose and rhododendron (after Edna St. Vincent Millay, “Elegy before Death”) There will be rose and rhododendron before you take your leave. Apple blossoms’ heady scent will welcome swarms of bees. In the crotch of Cortland branches, finches will nest and sing. Eggs will hatch, young will fledge, blind to your scourge’s sting. There will be solitary picnics beneath gnarled apple trees, gratitude for setting fruit, for cool shade of leaves. Oh, would the plucked fruit of Eve, her curious mind cursed, yield knowledge of a longed-for cure before orchard drops are pressed! Your demise will leave us reeling. Our wounds are grave and deep. Not one of us will mourn your passing; for you, we will not weep. ~Joyce Ray © 2020\n\nThis past week we had to do a difficult thing; we cut down 10 pine trees very close to our home.\n\nWe have lived with these trees for forty-two years, and they were huge when we arrived. This winter strong winds sheared off a thirty-foot top, which, thankfully, did not land on the roof. So it was time to say goodbye with gratitude. We spoke this litany to the sentinels who stood with us for so long.\n\nTo pines who have sheltered us from wind and snow whose shade has cooled us we offer gratitude, And let you go. For birds’ nests and sighing branches, for holding swings, wind chimes and clothes lines we offer gratitude, And let you go. To friends who’ve grown older with us, given us oxygen to breathe, we offer gratitude, And let you go. May your spirits remain close, your whispers stay in memory, your legacy bless what shall come anew. We let you go.\n\nWelcome Joyce Ray, author of Feathers & Trumpets, A Story of Hildegard of Bingen!\n\nHildegard agonizes over the origin of her visions. Is God speaking to her? Does she dare share her secret? In 12th century Germany, she could be declared heretic and burned at the stake. In a life fraught with challenges, Hildegard emerges as the most dynamic 12th century female voice.\n\nEnduring a beginning unimaginable to today’s teens, Hildegard strains against the ascetic lifestyle of Jutta, her mentor nun. Relationships with Volmar, her monk tutor and Richardis, her daughter nun, bring joy to Hildegard. But does she allow herself to love them too much?\n\nFeathers and Trumpets chronicles the life of the recently named saint and Doctor of the Church against the backdrop of a rich tapestry we know as the Middle Ages.\n\nJoyce Ray’s nonfiction work includes Women of the Pine Tree State: 25 Maine Women You Should Know and other titles in the America’s Notable Women series\n\nWhat was the most difficult element to cut/change during the revision process and why?\n\nIt was difficult for me to cut several chapters from the end of the manuscript. The novel evolved from a biography, and I wanted all the important elements of Hildegard’s life to be included. Striving to achieve that goal blinded me to the real climax of my story, and I resisted eliminating these chapters which were essential to my character’s life but not to the story.\n\nWhat authors do you love for their sentences? How about plot? Character?\n\nI love Cynthia Rylant and Beth Kephart for language. Two representative titles are: Appalachia, The Voices of Sleeping Birds by Cynthia Rylant, illustrated by Barry Moser (Harcourt Brace, 1991); Small Damages by Beth Kephart (Philomel, 2012)\n\nDeborah Wiles delivers every time with character! I love Each Little Bird That Sings (Harcourt, Inc., 2005)\n\nAnd Katherine Paterson for everything!\n\nWhat nugget of craft advice has been especially helpful to you?\n\nI’ll pass on two bits of advice. For the first two semesters I wrote picture books, or what I thought were picture books! I couldn’t even say the word “novel” if it applied to my writing. Then I heard Norma Fox Mazer and other wise mentors say, “Just write down the scenes and fit them together like pieces of a puzzle later.” And it worked!\n\nEric Kimmel told me to make my mantra “Persistence and volume.” Feathers and Trumpets‘ journey to publication took 13 years. Don’t give up!\n\nWho were your advisors at VCFA?\n\nMarion Dane Bauer, Eric Kimmel, Jane Resh Thomas and Carolyn Coman\n\nHow did attending VCFA affect your writing life?\n\nVCFA made me part of a community of writers and elevated my writing to a lifelong adventure. I began to see what made books work. My critical analysis skills developed, and my critiquing skills improved. Most importantly, I learned to write from my heart.\n\nFeathers & Trumpets, A Story of Hildegard of Bingen, (Apprentice Shop Books, LLC, March 16, 2014)\n\nJoyce Ray\n\nwww.joyceraybooks.com\n\nwww.joyceray.blogspot.com (Musings) originally posted March 26, 2014"
