The novel When We First Met was filmed for television by Home Box Office, 1984.\n\nWork in Progress\n\nSeveral novels; a short story.\n\nSidelights\n\n\"It's not hard to see why Norma Fox Mazer has found a place among the most popular writers for young adults these days,\" observed Suzanne Freeman in the Washington Post Book World. \"At her best, Mazer can cut right to the bone of teenage troubles and then show us how the wounds will heal. She can set down the everyday scenes of her characters' lives in images that are scalpel sharp,\" the critic continued, adding that \"what's apparent throughout all of this is that Mazer has taken great care to get to know the world she writes about. She delves into the very heart of it with a sure and practiced hand.\" Mazer's many acclaimed books for teen readers include After the Rain, A Figure of Speech, Silver, and Good Night, Maman.\n\nNew York Times Book Review contributor Barbara Wersba described Mazer as \"a dazzling writer\" who \"brings to her work a literacy that would be admirable in any type of fiction.\" In her National Book Award-nominated A Figure of Speech, Mazer tells the story of an elderly man neglected by all of his family except his granddaughter. \"The fine definition of all characters, the plausibility of the situations and the variety of insights into motivation make [the novel] almost too good to be true,\" Tom Heffernan asserted in Children's Literature: Annual of the Modern Language Association Seminar on Children's Literature and the Children's Literature Association. \"There is no point at which it passes into an area of depiction or explanation that would exceed the experience of a young adolescent. But there is also no point at which the psychological perceptiveness and narrative control would disappoint an adult reader.\"\n\nMazer grew up in Glens Falls, New York, the middle daughter in a family of three girls. Her father was a route driver, delivering such things as milk and bread, and the family lived in a succession of apartments and houses. \"The year we lived on Ridge Street, when I was eight,\" stated Mazer in her autobiographical essay for Something about the Author Autobiography Series (SAAS), \"I learned to ride a two-wheeler, changed my name (briefly, because I kept forgetting I'd changed it) to the more glamorous Diane, made up triplet brothers in the Navy to impress my new girlfriend, and was caught stealing.\" School, reading, and boys were her childhood loves, and it was in a new apartment on First Street that she may have realized the possibilities of her imagination: \"A girlfriend and I are playing near … wooden steps. I have forgotten the game, although I made it up, but not her words. 'Norma Fox! What an imagination!' And perhaps it was precisely then that I realized that my imagination had some other function than to torment me with witches in doorknobs and lurking figures in the shadows of the stairs.\"\n\nDuring Mazer's teen years, her family started calling her the \"Cold One,\" as she began to live more and more in her own world. Feeling like an outsider, Mazer admitted in SAAS that, \"were I to be asked to use one word to describe myself then and for years afterward, it would be—eyes. There's a picture of me around thirteen, sitting in a high-backed leather chair, looking out of the corner of my eyes, looking around, watching, a little frightened smile on my face. Along about then, it struck me, a bone-aching truth, that grown-ups—adults, these powerful mysterious people—were all play-acting; they weren't, in fact, any older, any more grown-up than I was.\"\n\nA job with the school newspaper gave Mazer her first opportunity to write for publication, and writing soon became the focus of her existence at school. \"But I wanted to write more than newspaper articles. There was a longing in me, vague,… but real, almost an ache,\" the novelist recalled. When she was fifteen, Mazer met her future husband, Harry Mazer, for the first time. He was a friend of her older sister, and at the age of twenty-one, he seemed ancient to Mazer. Two years later, they met again, and a much-more-confident Mazer was determined that Harry should fall in love with her. Harry thought that Mazer was too young, though, and she had to work at making him notice her—the couple fell in and out of love and quarreled many times before finally getting married.\n\nDuring the early part of their marriage, the Mazers worked at \"boring\" jobs and tried to learn how to cook. Three children soon became part of the family, and Mazer took on the role of Mommy. \"I had almost forgotten Norma,\" she remembered. \"One day, looking around at the houseful of kids and listening to the never ending cries of Mommy! Mom! Mama!, it occurred to me that the day I'd been both putting off and waiting for—the day when I was all grown up—had arrived without my noticing. Indeed, it must have been here for quite a while. And that famous question 'What are you going to do when you grow up?' had not gone away.\" A serious talk with her husband followed, and both Mazers revealed a desire to be a writer. They decided that if they were really serious about writing, they had to do at least a little every day. So, for three years, the Mazers spent an hour at the end of each day writing. Money from an insurance settlement finally enabled them to write full-time. \"It was mildly terrifying,\" revealed Mazer in her autobiographical essay. \"I had some days when I sat in front of the typewriter and shook because I couldn't think of what to write next.\"\n\nTo support the family, the Mazers wrote for the women's true confessions market. These stories were presented as first-person confessions of women who had made serious mistakes in their lives, but were actually the work of professional writers. During the following years, the Mazers each wrote one of these 5,000-to-8,000-word stories every week, leaving little time to devote to the writing of novels. In 1970 Mazer managed to find the time to pen her novel I, Trissy, and it was published the following year. A Figure of Speech came two years later and received a National Book Award nomination. \"I remember meeting a member of the National Book Award committee some time after A Figure of Speech had received a … nomination and hearing him say to me, '… and you just came out of nowhere.' I laughed. My 'nowhere' had been the ten years I'd spent writing full time and learning the craft.\"\n\nMazer has been especially acclaimed for her young-adult novels, some of which she has written with her husband, and although her fictional characters are not always likable, they are believable young people struggling with challenges while teetering on the verge of adulthood. Her 1981 book Taking Terri Mueller earned Mazer an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America although she had not intended it as a mystery. The book follows Terri Mueller and her father as they wander from town to town, never staying in one place for more than a year. Although Terri is happy with her father, she is old enough to wonder why he will never talk about her mother, who supposedly died ten years ago. An overheard discussion leads Terri to discover that she had been kidnapped by her father after a bitter custody battle. \"The unfolding and the solution of the mystery [of the truth about Terri's mother] are effectively worked,\" remarked a Horn Book reviewer; \"filled with tension and with strong characterization, the book makes compelling reading.\" Freeman similarly observed that despite the potential for simplifying Terri's conflict, \"Mazer does not take the easy way out in this book. There are no good guys or bad guys. There are no easy answers.\" The critic concluded, \"We believe in just about everything Terri does, because Mazer's writing makes us willing to believe. She wins us completely with this finely wrought and moving book.\"\n\nIn her Newbery Honor Book After the Rain Mazer returns to the subject of a elderly man dying; but in this instance, grandfather Izzy rebuffs his loving family, and granddaughter Rachel must exert herself to build a relationship with him. As it becomes clear to her that Izzy is dying and needs companionship, Rachel decides to regularly spend her free time with him. \"It's surprising that she should make such a decision,\" claimed Washington Post Book World contributor Cynthia Samuels, \"but once the reader accepts her choice and begins to join her on her daily visits with the crotchety old man, the story becomes both moving and wise.\" The result, continued the critic, is a book that \"deals with death and loss in an original and sensitive way.\" Carolyn Meyer, however, felt that there is a lack of tension in the story: \"you never really worry that Rachel won't do the right thing,\" she wrote in the Los Angeles Times Book Review. In contrast, a Kirkus Reviews critic suggested that \"what distinguishes this book, making it linger in the heart, are the realistic portrayals of the tensions, guilt, and sudden, painfully moving moments involved in Rachel's and Izzy's situations.\" As a Horn Book reviewer concluded, Izzy's \"harsh, rough personality [is] so realistic and recognizable that we feel we have known him and can understand the sorrow that overcomes Rachel. [After the Rain is] a powerful book, dealing with death and dying and the strength of family affection.\"\n\nWith Good Night, Maman Mazer ventures into historical fiction. The young-adult novel centers around twelve-year-old Karin, who, amid World War II, must struggle to find freedom and begin a new life without her beloved mother. The Nazi invaders have sent Karin's father to a prison in Poland and Karin, her brother, and her mother are in hiding in an attic. When they are told they must leave, the children head south. Karin and her brother eventually board a ship headed to America, leaving their ill-stricken mother behind. \"This moving World War II story is neither highly dramatic nor politically charged. It is the very personal and immediate experience of a young girl grappling with the loss of her old life and a new life that changes daily,\" explained Lauren Adams in Horn Book. A Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded that \"the strength of this novel lies in its intimate recognition of the way adolescents think and feel.\" Mazer explained in a Teen Reads online interview that writing historical fiction is difficult because a writer must fit a fictional character into an actual event. \"I had to write this novel over completely four times, and this was because I was working out how to balance fiction and history,\" she remarked. To prepare to write her book, Mazer said, \"I read a fair number of books, most of them memoirs of people who had lived through the Holocaust. What struck me was that despite the numbing universality of that murderous time, each person's story, each survivor's story, was unique, distinct … my intention in writing this book was not to write history, but to write the unique history of an individual, albeit a fictional one.\"\n\nLike Good Night, Maman, Girlhearts deals with a young girl's loss of a parent. Sarabeth Silver is devastated by the death of her mother, the only parent and family member she has ever known. With no one to turn to, Sarabeth decides to track down the extended family members who had turned their back on her mother after she became pregnant at age sixteen. \"With a pitch-perfect intensity, Mazer captures the fractured sense of loss, of self, of time, that comes with a death in the family,\" explained GraceAnn A. DeCandido in Booklist. Writing in School Library Journal, Susie Paige noted that \"the theme of death and renewal is not a new one, but Mazer's characters deal with the process in a realistic, heartrending manner.\" In Publishers Weekly a reviewer praised the novel for conveying its author's \"intimate recognition\" of teen emotions, adding that Mazer \"conveys the heroine's feelings of shock, numbness, loneliness and powerlessness with her usual authenticity.\"\n\nMazer melds prose with poetry in her 2005 novel What I Believe. The book tracks middle-schooler Vickie Marnet's changing world after her middle-aged father is laid off from his corporate job and the Marnet family falls from affluence into depression and struggling financial circumstances. Moving from the family's comfortable suburban home to a crowded city apartment, Vickie must now deal with a new school while her mother heads off to work and a renter moves into the spare bedroom to help pay the rent. Consisting of diary entries, e-mails, and Vickie's poetry, Mazer's text reflects the girl's \"struggles to master the dramatic changes in her life,\" according to Booklist reviewer Holly Koelling. A Kirkus Reviews writer praised \"Mazer's ear for teen language,\" while in School Library Journal Denise Moore asserted that readers will be \"drawn into the girl's struggle\" and \"taken with the novel's free-flowing style and revelations.\"\n\nLike her novels, Mazer's short-story collections, which include Dear Bill, Remember Me? and Other Stories and Summer Girls, Love Boys and Other Short Stories, have also won her many readers. \"Clearly, Mazer appreciates the short-story form, with its narrow focus and spotlit moments,\" commented a Kirkus Reviews writer about Dear, Bill, Remember Me? and Other Stories. The eight short stories in the collection deal with young girls going through a period of crisis: In \"Up on Fong Mountain,\" Jessie strives to be accepted as something other than an extension of her boyfriend, while eighteen-year-old Louise in \"Guess Whose Friendly Hands\" knows she is dying of cancer and wishes her mother and sister would accept her reality. Mazer's tales \"are clearly broadcast on a young teenager's wavelength, with the signal unobtrusively amplified as in good YA novels,\" contended a Kirkus Reviews contributor.\n\nBruce Bennett, writing in the Nation, noted that Summer Girls, Love Boys and Other Short Stories \"is accessible to teenagers as well as adults. Most of the characters are young people,\" the critic elaborated, \"but Mazer writes about them with an affectionate irony that older readers will appreciate.\" Because Mazer \"has the skill to reveal the human qualities in both ordinary and extraordinary situations as young people mature,\" stated New York Times Book Review contributor Ruth I. Gordon, \"… it would be a shame to limit their reading to young people, since they can show an adult reader much about the sometimes painful rite of adolescent passage into adulthood.\" Strengthening the effect of Mazer's collections is that they are \"written specifically as a book, a fact which gives the stories an unusual unity and connectedness,\" related Bennett."
