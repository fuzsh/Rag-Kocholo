With tiny meals that wouldn’t fill a mosquito ( the big wonderful treat is unlimited celery sticks ) , Camp Thin-na-Yet is worse than prison. In fact, the only good thing at camp is Belinda Moss, who hates the place as much as Sam.

Three-year-old Muffin flushes Kammy’s best paints down the toilet, almost strangles the cat, and the baby cries for hours at a time. Camp has always sounded hateful. But when Dad and Kate suggest that Kammy go away to Camp Arrowhead, Kammy figures it can’t be worse than staying at home. How wrong can a person be? Arrowhead is a disaster. Now the only question is: what can Kammy do to save the summer from being a total bummer?\n\n* Missing Since Monday\n\n* Slam Book\n\n1989. In junior high, everyone knew Anna. But getting noticed at Calvin High was going to be more difficult, and the last thing Anna wanted was to be a nobody. So she and her friends start a slam book. Anna’s cousin promised that it would be their key to popularity. All Anna had to do was buy a notebook and make pages for people at school – cute guys, nerds, friends. Then the book got passed around and kids wrote what they really thought about those people. The slam book did make Anna and her friends the center of attention.

The threatening notes scare Lisa terribly. Lisa doesn’t see why Harvey’s being Jewish would upset anyone enough to make them send the notes. But someone is upset.

He doesn’t want to be part of any team. But lately when Willis runs, it’s like he’s running away from things. Things like his alcoholic father trying to beat him up. Or Rabbit Slavin and his gang on Villa street – since Willis challenged them, they’ve been out for blood. And on top of it all, Willis has gotten himself a job coaching a retarded kid in sports.

People thought because we ran a dump, and lived near the dump, that we lived in it. We couldn’t even see the dump from our house, but that didn’t matter to the kids who taunted me. I never let them see I ( Joyce Adams ) was bothered, which is something I learned from my uncle, Old Dad, who I’ve lived with since I was little.
