Kirkus Reviews, starred reviewLike Robert Cormier's Tenderness (1997), this novel peeks into the mind of a villain with ominous effectiveness...' Booklist(USA), starred reviewThis well-crafted thriller with mythic undertones...ultimately reassures readers that with determination, forethought, courage, and luck, even the youngest of children can meet overwhelming odds and find their way home again.' School Library Journal(USA), starred review\n\nNorma Fox Mazer wrote over 30 novels and short-story collections for young adults, including Ten Ways to Make My Sister Disappear, When She Was Good, Missing Pieces, Out of Control, Girlhearts, and the Newbery Honor Book After the Rain. Her books won many prestigious awards. Nine of her titles were designated Best Books for Young Adults by the American Library Association.\n\nNorma grew up in a small city at the foot of the Adirondack Mountains, the middle of three sisters. She saw witches in doorknobs and dancers in wallpaper, and decided to be a writer when she was 12. Later she married Harry Mazer, with whom she had four children and co-authored three novels.\n\nThis is the story of five sisters. Beauty longs for love. Mim holds a secret tightly. Stevie is tempestuous and impulsive. Fancy talks too much and understands too little. And Autumn, the youngest sister, struggles to discover who she is. None of the Herbert girls is aware of the mild-looking man who has become obsessed with them - until the day one sister doesn't come home."
