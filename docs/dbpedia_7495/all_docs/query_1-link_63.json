Gallo, National Council of Teachers of English (Urbana, IL), 1990.\n\nADAPTATIONS: Snow Bound was filmed as an NBC After School Special in 1978.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: \"Harry Mazer writes about young people caught in the midst of moral crises, often of their own making,\" asserted Kenneth L. Donelson in Voice of Youth Advocates. \"Searching for a way out, they discover themselves, or rather they learn that the first step in extricating themselves from their physical and moral dilemmas is self-discovery. Intensely moral as Mazer's books are,\" the critic continued, \"they present young people thinking and talking and acting believably,\" a characteristic which accounts for Mazer's popularity. In The Girl of His Dreams, for example, Mazer relates the romance of two ordinary young adults with \"a credibility apart from its fairytale ending,\" commented Marianne Gingher in the Los Angeles Times, a credibility due to the \"dimensional characters.\" Although \"contrivances abound,\" the critic believed that \"the happy ending feels earned. Harry Mazer writes deftly about the nature of adolescent yearning, both from a boy's and girl's perspective.\" And Snow Bound, the tale of two mismatched teens who are caught unprepared in a New York blizzard and must cooperate to survive, has a similar appeal. New York Times Book Review contributor Cathleen Burns Elmer noted that \"occasionally a plot turn seems contrived,\" but she admitted that the book has a \"capacity to enthrall [that] lies in the mature reader's willingness to suspend disbelief. Snow Bound is a crackling tale; Mazer tells it with vigor and authority.\"\n\nThe Dollar Man presents another \"average\" youth in uncommon circumstances; Marcus Rosenbloom is overweight, prone to daydreaming, and obsessed with finding out the identity of his father, about whom his single mother refuses to speak. \"The idea is not novel, or even presented with extraordinary subtlety or style,\" observed Tobi Tobias in the New York Times Book Review, \"but there is such charged energy in Mazer's work and Marcus is such an authentic person that you care, very much, what happens.\" \"Not incidentally,\" a Kirkus Reviewer writer remarked, \"this is an outstandingly empathetic and realistic study of … a food addict and, moreover, a sensitive interior view—undistorted by the self-discounting sarcasm that has become a narrative cliche—of the kind of kid who is usually shoved into the background … but who in this case deserves the front and center attention Mazer accords him.\" The result, concluded the critic, is \"a rare combination—uncompromising yet ever so easy to connect with.\" Mazer brings his life experience to the keyboard when he writes. According to one biographer, \"The halls and the stairs were Mazer's playground, and he grew up between two worlds—the park and the street—both of which he would later use in his novels.\"\n\nThe Last Mission, based in part on Mazer's experiences in World War II, \"represents an amazing leap in writing, far surpassing anything [the author] had written before,\" claimed Donelson. Fifteen-year-old Jack Raab is Jewish and so desperate to fight against Hitler that he borrows his older brother's identification to enlist in the Army Air Forces. Jack is trained as a gunner, and he and his fellow crew members fly out of England on over twenty missions before being hit by enemy fire; Jack bails out and is the only one to survive—but he ends up a German prisoner of war. While war stories form a much-explored genre, Paxton Davis felt The Last Mission stands out; as he detailed in the New York Times Book Review, the force of Mazer's novel \"lies less with details of Air Force training and service … than with the emotional substance upon which the experience depends. For Jack Raab is no mere author's pawn,\" the critic explained. \"The reader feels his shock and grief at losing his friends, suffers with him the doubts and apprehensions that being a Jewish prisoner inevitably raise, and especially, experiences with him the bewildering mixture of relief and repugnance that comes with returning to civilian life.\"\n\nA Kirkus Reviews writer, however, believed that \"despite Mazer's evident and convincing first-hand acquaintance with the material,\" the novel is a \"reduction of a genre that is best met at full strength.\" Donelson, on the other hand, asserted that The Last Mission \"conveys better than any other young adult novel, and better than most adult novels, the feeling of war and the desolation it leaves behind…. This book is a remarkable achievement, both for its theme and its portrait of a young man who searches and acts and finds the search futile and the actions incoherent.\" As Davis concluded, \"Mazer is a prize-winning writer for young people. No wonder.\"\n\nIn Someone's Mother's Missing, Mazer tells the story of Lisa Allen, a young girl whose world falls apart when her father passes away. Her mother cannot cope with the void and the mountain of bills he left behind, so she leaves Lisa. A Publishers Weekly reviewer criticized this book and felt that its \"overly brief and choppy chapters omit many details and preclude examination of the characters' motives or the impact the events have on their lives.\" Mazer tells the tale of another troubled teen in Who Is Eddie Leonard? Eddie, a teenage boy, shows up at the home of a family whose son has been missing for years. He claims to be their son, but they never quite trust him or believe his assertions. The father eventually locates the boy's birth certificate, proving that he is not their son. A Publishers Weekly reviewer observed, \"Mazer does a better job with internal monologue than with dialogue,\" but added that \"the character does work\" in spite of this flaw. The same reviewer felt that Eddie is \"a metaphor for the alienation that many teenagers feel\" and that readers may \"appreciate the unsentimental treatment of the main character, who is far from perfect and far from innocent.\"\n\nMazer's disturbance about the accessibility of guns among today's youth led to the compilation of Twelve Shots: Outstanding Short Stories about Guns. Mazer invited young people to write stories about the way guns are present in people's lives. \"The result is a varied, involving collection with stories by familiar writers such as Walter Dean Meters, Chris Lynch, Rita Williams-Garcia, and Richard Peck,\" observed Helen Rosenberg in Booklist. Rosenberg also noted, \"Some stories are serious and subtly antigun, others are hilarious.\"\n\nA twelve-year-old boy with Down's syndrome narrates The Wild Kid. When Sammy gets lost in the woods, he is kidnapped by Kevin, a juvenile delinquent. Kitty Flynn in Horn Book described the book as both \"harrowing and touching.\" She added that \"Mazer manages to portray both the victim and the victimizer as sympathetic.\" Kevin finally makes an anonymous call to the police and then disappears back into the woods. Booklist's John Peters remarked, \"Kevin's sudden disappearance makes a stimulating loose end that may, paradoxically, strengthen readers' responses to this survival-story-with-a-difference.\"\n\nMazer once told CA:\"I felt—I've always felt—that I write and even speak with difficulty. I think I am a writer not because this was something I did well—an inborn talent—but for the opposite reason, because I did it so poorly. I was like the child suffering from polio who determines to become a runner.\n\n\"Everything I've done as a writer I've done despite the feeling that I have no natural talent. I've never felt articulate or fluent, rarely felt that flow of language. When I think of the origins of these feelings, I wonder if this may be physical, some form of dyslexia. My mother, despite strenuous efforts, never learned to read or write with fluency and my brother seemed to have the same problem in school.\"\n\nThe author added: \"When I started writing I had no idea I would find myself writing for young readers. My agent suggested I do something in this area, and I discovered that I liked writing about this time of life. Adolescence for me was so intense, so filled with joy, pain, expectations, hope, despair, energy, that though those years are far behind me they remain real to me, and have a vividness and clarity that events much closer to me in time do not have. To my surprise I discovered a thirteen-year-old voice inside me.\n\n\"In writing for the young you can't allow yourself the diversions, the long descriptions, philosophical ruminations, endless dialogues of other fictions. You have to rivet the interest of your reader rapidly. I don't expect my reader to be any more patient than I am.\n\n\"A greater danger, though, is to oversimplify, to write down, to fudge on emotion, and development, and the realistic working out of the story. Good children's fiction is finally no different than good adult fiction. It needs fully shaped characters, conflict, and development. It has form, a beginning, middle and end.\n\n\"I'm interested in character, in those parts of people that are hidden, misunderstood, areas of deprivation, longing, separation and isolation. I write out of the memory of those feelings in myself. When I feel the conflict in the character, the disparate feelings, then I begin to feel the truth of the character, the inner tension, the opposing emotions, that inform the book as well.\"\n\nFor an earlier published interview, see entry in Contemporary Authors, Volume 97-100.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nbooks\n\nButler, Francelia, editor, Children's Literature Review, Volume 4, Temple University Press (Philadelphia, PA), 1975, p. 206.\n\nChildren's Literature Review, Volume 16, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1989.\n\nLystad, Mary, Twentieth-Century Young Adult Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1994.\n\nNilsen, Alleen Pace, and Kenneth L.
