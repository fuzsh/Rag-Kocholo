Norma Fox Mazer, an award-winning novelist for young people whose work helped illuminate many dark corners of adolescence, exploring subjects like poverty, betrayal, abandonment and loss, died on Oct. 17 at her home in Montpelier, Vt. She was 78.

The cause was brain cancer, her daughter Anne Mazer said.

The author of more than 30 books, Ms. Mazer was known in particular for her young-adult titles on uneasy themes. One such novel, “After the Rain” (Morrow, 1987), which explores a girl’s relationship with her difficult, dying grandfather, was named a Newbery Honor Book by the American Library Association in 1988. Another, “A Figure of Speech” (Delacorte, 1973), also about a grandfather and granddaughter, was a National Book Award finalist in 1974.

Ms. Mazer’s work was widely praised by critics for its literate dialogue; psychological astuteness; believable characters and situations; and unflinching yet nuanced portrayal of lives fraught with guilt, pain and rupture. In her books parents sicken and die, families are separated, troubling secrets come to light, and children are abandoned.

Given Ms. Mazer’s directness, it is not surprising that her characters are offered few easy answers. Yet her plots are less about tidy resolutions than they are about interior journeys toward self-knowledge. As a result, her work can be permeated with an aura of suspense. This was perhaps nowhere more evident than in her novel “Taking Terri Mueller” (Avon, 1981), which won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1982 although it was never intended as a mystery.

The novel centers on Terri, a teenager who moves from place to place with her loving but itinerant father. She has been told that her mother died long ago, but is stunned to discover that she is still alive. In fact, Terri’s father kidnapped her from her mother when she was very young, during the couple’s painful divorce. Besides unraveling the true story of her past, Terri must reconcile conflicting loyalties toward both parents.

Reviewing the novel, The Washington Post said: “We believe in just about everything Terri does, because Mazer’s writing makes us willing to believe. She wins us completely with this finely wrought and moving book.”

Norma Diane Fox was born in New York City on May 15, 1931, and reared in Glens Falls, N.Y., north of Albany. She studied at Antioch College before marrying Harry Mazer in 1950; she later studied at Syracuse University.

As a young mother, Ms. Mazer determined to be a writer. So did her husband, and the two of them resolved to learn their craft by doing. Week after week for several years, each contributed “first-person” articles to pulp magazines like True Confessions and True Story  articles with titles along the lines of “I Fell in Love With My Sister’s Husband” and neat, didactic endings, as Anne Mazer recalled on Tuesday.

Ms. Mazer published her first juvenile novel, “I, Trissy” (Delacorte), about separating parents, in 1971. Her other books include “Silver” (Morrow, 1988), about a girl living in a trailer park; “Out of Control” (Morrow, 1993), about sexual harassment; “Good Night, Maman” (Harcourt Brace, 1999), about a family fleeing the Nazis; and two collections of short fiction, “Dear Bill, Remember Me?” (Delacorte, 1976) and “Summer Girls, Love Boys, and Other Short Stories” (Delacorte, 1982).

With her husband, who also became a well-known juvenile author, Ms. Mazer wrote several joint novels, among them “The Solid Gold Kid” (Delacorte, 1977) and “Bright Days, Stupid Nights” (Bantam, 1992). From 1997 to 2006, she taught writing at the Vermont College of Fine Arts in Montpelier.

Besides her husband and daughter Anne, who is herself a children’s writer, Ms. Mazer is survived by two other children, Joseph Mazer and Gina Mazer; two sisters, Adele Machia and Linda Fox; and two grandchildren. Another daughter, Susan Mazer, died in 2001.

In an interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse in 1988, Ms. Mazer sought to dispel any notion that her work, despite its emotionally rigorous subject matter, had a neat, didactic aim.

“I hesitate to say I’m delivering messages,” she said. “I’m writing stories and novels. I hope there’s an underlying feeling for the reader  a hope, perhaps a moral. But I’m not preaching. I’m telling stories.”
