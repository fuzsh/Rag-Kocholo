        "text": "According to the 2013 census, Miskito are the second largest indigenous community in Honduras, numbering 80,007 or 11 per cent of the total indigenous population. Miskito in Honduras primarily speak the Miskito language and Spanish as well as some English (due to the British colonial influence). Miskito inhabit a large area in the south-eastern section of Honduras located on the Caribbean coast from Río Plátano to Gracias a Dios. Miskito traditional territory also extends into Nicaragua but is divided by present-day state boundaries.\n\nWhile other groups have integrated into urban centres, Miskito have largely remained in their traditional areas, engaging in agriculture and fishing. Miskito men often travel away from home for seasonal work, such as diving for lobsters and conch. Poor equipment and exploitative labour conditions result in serious health problems that have affected a large percentage of divers. This has been exacerbated by inadequate healthcare and educational facilities and the historical socio-economic marginalization of Miskito areas.\n\nMiskito are largely Protestants associated with the Moravian Church, which has a strong influence in contemporary Miskito life.\n\nStrong ties maintained by Honduran Miskito with their Nicaraguan counterparts have contributed to a resurgence and strengthening of advocacy by Honduran Miskito indigenous groups."
