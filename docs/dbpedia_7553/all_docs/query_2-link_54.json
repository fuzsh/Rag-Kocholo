        "text": "Report on the Situation of Human Rights of a Segment of the Nicaraguan Population of Mikito Origin, Inter-Am. C.H.R., OEA/Ser.L./V.II.62, Doc. 10 rev. 3 (1983).\n\nPART ONE\n\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTROVERSY\n\nA. Background\n\n1. Before analyzing the various issues involved in the current human rights situation of a segment of the Nicaraguan population of Miskito origin, the Commission considers it advisable to provide some historical background that may facilitate the understanding of this complex matter.\n\n2. What is called “the Atlantic coast�? of Nicaragua is a region that includes the Department of Zelaya and part of the Department of the Rio San Juan. From time immemorial, this area has been inhabited by the ethnic groups denominated Miskitos, Sumos and Ramas, the sole genuine descendants of the primitive aborigines who inhabited Nicaragua. Of these, the Miskitos are the largest ethnic group.\n\n3. As a result of the particular circumstances of the historical development of Nicaraguan society, this part of the country is unlike the pacific region from an ethnic, cultural, historical, linguistic or religious perspective.\n\nThus, while the Spanish, Catholic captains and religious orders colonized the Pacific zone, the Atlantic coast was the object of similar activity by the British, who since 1640 has established themselves in the northeast part of this region, dedicated to the exploitation of sugarcane and hardwood.\n\n4. The English won and cultivated the friendship of the natives, and occasionally were allied with them in attacks on some Spanish settlements in the interior of the country. To consolidate their domination of the region, in 1687 the British created the Miskito Kingdom, which was brought under the protection of Great Britain. In the same year, the Governor of Jamaica approved the appointment of the Indian chief Oldman as monarch of the Miskito territory; this artificially established the Miskito dynasty, an institution which had not existed previously in Indian social organization. The monarchy lasted until 1894, when Nicaragua again acquired full sovereignty over these lands through the decree of reincorporating of the Mosquitia.\n\n5. At the beginning of 1847, the British Government notified the Republics of Central America that what was called the “de la mosquitia�? coast, extended from the Cape of Honduras to the southern bank of the San Juan River, and that in the future the Miskito Kingdom should be recognized as a sovereign nation under the protection of Great Britain.\n\n6. In 1849 the Atlantic coast witnessed the first arrival in the region of missionaries of the “Unitas Fratum�? church, known as the Moravian church because it originated in Bohemia and Moravia, Czechoslovakia which soon became the dominant influence in the area, displacing the Catholic Church which maintained its predominance in the pacific region. Thus, by 1900 most of the Miskito and Sumo communities had embraced the Moravian faith; Criollo and Miskito pastors gradually replaced those of German and North American origin, and at present nearly all centers populated by Miskitos have a Moravian pastor trained at the Biblical Institute of Bilwaskarma, on the Coco River.\n\n7. The Treaty of Managua was signed in 1860, whereby Great Britain recognized Nicaraguan sovereignty over the Atlantic region and declared that the British protectorate over that territory would expire following exchange instrument of ratification. The Treaty established that the Miskitos would have the right of self-government and the right to govern all residents within the region, in accordance with their own custom and with whatever regulations they adopted that did not contravene the sovereign rights of the Republic of Nicaragua. In turn, the latter agreed to respect and not oppose their customs and regulation.\n\nDue to the unique status obtained by the Miskitos as result of this arrangement, serious and ongoing problems arose between the authorities of the Republic and those of the Miskito Reserve. On February 12, 1894, this led the Government of Nicaragua to reenact the reserve by means of a Decree issued by the Inspector General of the Atlantic coast, General Rigoberto Cabezas.\n\nOn November 20 of the same year, the inhabitants of the Reserve, speaking through their mayors and delegates, declared their acceptance of the sovereignty of Nicaragua, reserving some privileges though what was called the Miskito Convention.\n\n8. On April 19, 1905, Great Britain and Nicaragua signed the Altamirano Harrison Treaty, which annulled the 1860 Treaty of Managua. In accordance with this new instrument, Great Britain recognized the absolute sovereignty of Nicaragua over the Territory constituting the earlier Miskito Reserve.\n\nSubparagraphs b), c), d) and e) of Article 3 of that Treaty read as follows:\n\nb. The Government shall allow the Indians to live in their villages in enjoyment of the concession granted under this Convention, and in accordance with their own customs, insofar as they are not contrary to the laws of the country and public morality.\n\nc. The Government of Nicaragua shall grant them a period of two years to legalize their rights to the property they have acquired in conformity with the provisions that governed the reserve prior to 1894. The Government shall not charge for their lands or for the concession of titles. For that purpose, titles that were owned by the Indians and Creoles prior to 1894 shall be renewed in conformity with the law; and where such title do not exist, the Government shall give each family eight squares of property in their place of residence.\n\nd. Public land for grazing shall be set aside for the use of the inhabitants in the neighborhood of each Indian village.\n\ne. Should any Miskito or Creole Indian prove that the property he owned in accordance with the provisions in force prior to 1894 has been revoked or adjudicated to another person, the Government shall compensate him by granting him idle land of like value, as close to his place of residence as possible.�?\n\n9. The Altamirano-Harrison Treaty closed the chapter on Great Britain’s claims to the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. Yet several factors remained that made it difficult to legalize ownership title to the properties that belonged to the Miskitos prior to 1894 and to specify other rights to lands referred to in Article III of the above-mentioned Treaty. Among such factors should be mentioned the lack of precision with respect to the boundaries of the former Miskito Reserve; the difficulty in transportation and communication among the remote Indian communities and with Bluefields, capital of the Department; and the persistence of some Miskito chiefs in considering themselves subjects of the Kingdom of Great Britain.\n\nEven though some communities obtained title to their lands, the problem still remains unresolved, and the Miskitos have since maintained an ongoing claim to compliance with the provisions of the treaty concerning their lands and their right to live in accordance with their customs.\n\n10. Moreover, the relative economic and social development that took place in the country at the end nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth never reached the Atlantic coast. The liberal and conservative governments that governed the country following the reincorporation of the Miskito reserve until July of 1979 focused their attention on the rest of the country, particularly the Pacific zone. Thus, the Atlantic zone was not included in the general development process of the country, and was subject to economic exploitation and cultural domination.\n\nThe natural resources of that region, chiefly mineral, forestry and fishing resource were exploited by national or foreign companies of the pacific region. To mention but a few, these were: The Neptune Gold Mine Company; The Rosario and Light Mine Company; The Nicaraguan Long Leaf Pine Lumber Company (NIPCO); and the Pescanica, Plumar-Blue, and Boot Fishing Companies.\n\nThe Miskito population that worked in these enterprises received wages that were considered to be very low, while the Atlantic region, as a whole received no particular benefit as a result of the economic activities of those companies. Thus, the only route of communication with the Pacific zone was by means of navigation of the Rio Escondido from Bluefields to the City of Rama (6 hours), and then by road to Managua (5 hours); the principal population centers-Puerto Cabezas and Las Minas- are linked by rough dirt roads, which are not always passable.\n\n11. In general, it may be stated that the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua in July of 1979, lacked electricity, drinking water, sanitary facilities, transportation services, communications, radios and schools.\n\n12. As a reaction to this state of absolute neglect, as a manifestation of the resurgence of an awareness of ethnic identity on the part of the natives vis-à-vis the attempts at acculturation by the previous government, foreign companies, and in general, the populace of the Pacific—whom the Miskitos called “the Spaniards�? – and as a means of defending their ancestral rights, in 1972, the Indian organization Alliance for the Progress of the Miskito and Sumo (ALPROMISO) was created, and in November of 1979 this was transformed and replaced by the Organization MISURASATA.[1]\n\nB. Recent Background\n\n1. It was not long before serious problems arose between the Indian communities and the Sandinista Government, which has assumed power in July 1979.\n\n2. According to substantial background material in the hands of the Commission, shortly after the triumph of the revolution, a good part of the Miskito population began to resist the attempts of the new Government of Nicaragua to make them adapt some of their ways of life and tribal organization to the political and social objectives set out by the Sandinista National Liberation Front. (FSLN).\n\nAccording to reports received by the Commission, the resistance of the Miskitos to such changes, and the insistence of the government that they accept them, gradually gave rise to a distancing of the two groups which sharpened into antagonism, due to the conflict between the FSLN’s expectations of the Miskitos and the expectations of the Miskitos with respect to the Sandinista Government.\n\n3. As the Indian’s resistance grew, the Government began to apply increasingly drastic measures to control what had become an organized counterrevolutionary movement in the eye of the official authorities, with influence on the whole Atlantic coastal region and with secessionist intent.\n\nOn February 19 and 20, 1981, approximately 30 Miskitos leaders of the Misurasata Organization were imprisoned by the State Security forces, among them Brooklyn Rivera, Hazel Lau, and Steadman Fagoth. In addition, the organization’s offices were placed under army control.\n\nGovernment accused the leaders of Misurasata of promoting a separatist movement on the Atlantic coast. New waves of protest broke out in the area, and led to the formation of February 25 of that year of a Peace Committee comprised of members of the FSLN, Misurasata, and religious institutions.\n\nIn response to the recommendations of that Committee, Rivera and Lau were released together with the other leaders who had been captured; Steadman Fagoth, representative of Misurasata in the Council of State, accused of high treason and of being an agent of the Security Force of the previous regime, a charge he denied, was not released.\n\nAt the insistence of Misurasata and other organizations, Fagoth was released in May 1981, returned to the Atlantic coast and moved to Honduras, where he was followed by 3,000 Miskitos. Later, in September of that year, Brooklyn Rivera, who had continued to negotiate with the Government on behalf of Misurasata, also left the country.\n\n4. In July 1981, the Government announced the launching of the Agrarian Reform Program. Misurasata leaders believed that the program should take into account the claims of the Indian communities to ownership of lands involved in the program, since from their viewpoint, it would first have to be determined which lands belonged to them and which others the Government could dispose of without compensation.\n\nFurthermore, the Miskito leaders accused the Government of not observing an Agreement which, in their view afforded the Indian organization a four/month deadline to submit a study in support of their land claims.\n\n5. In the course of these events, the Government of National Reconstruction repeatedly denounced the existence of anti-Sandinista armed groups operating along the border with Honduras, from within that country, which were organized and led by officers of the disbanded Somocista National Guard. According to the Government of the FSLN, those groups made constant incursions into Nicaraguan territory, attacking border posts and terrorizing the Miskitos who lived in various communities along the Coco River.\n\nIn response to this situation, the Nicaraguan Government expanded its military presence in the area, which gave rise to many confrontations or incidents between soldiers and Miskitos, which led some of the Indians to begin seeking refuge in Honduras, by crossing the Coco River border. In the last months of 1981, the incursions of these armed insurgent groups became more frequent, according to the Nicaraguan Government.\n\n6. According to information received by the Commission, on December 20 and 21, 1981, rebels in opposition to the Government of Nicaragua crossed the Coco River from Honduras and occupied the town of San Carlos, where they ambushed soldiers of the Nicaraguan army, and mutilated and killed several of them. The Government of Nicaragua denounced this incident as part of a massive uprising planned to break out in the towns of the Coco River inhabited by Miskitos, in the course of Christmas week. At the same time, denunciations and information received by the IACHR stated that during this confrontation, and in retaliation for the killings in San Carlos, Sandinista Army forces killed a considerable, although thus far undetermined, number of Miskitos in the area of Leimus and its surroundings.\n\n7. On December 28, 1981, the Government of Nicaragua decided to move 42 villages of the Coco River region to an area located some 60 kilometers south of the river, on the Rosita-Puerto Cabezas road. The up-river towns, from Leimus to Raiti, had to be evacuated on foot, under very difficult and harsh conditions, as there were no passable roads for vehicles. The down-river villagers, from Leimus to the Atlantic coast, were moved in trucks and most of those evacuated were allowed to take some of their belongings. Throughout January and part of February, q982, approximately 8,500 Miskitos were relocated in five different camps in what the Government has called the Tasba Pri project “free land�? in the Miskito language).\n\n8. As a result of the events related to the so-called Red Christmas operation, many Miskitos were captured by the Government of Nicaragua, and together with some ministers of the Moravian Church, accused of being counterrevolutionaries. A massive exodus then ensued; during which approximately 10,000Miskitos and many Moravian ministers crossed the Coco River into Honduras, where some 8,000 were subsequently settled in refugee camps in the area of Mocoron, in the Gracias a Dios Department.\n\nC. The Government of Nicaragua invites the IACHR to make an on-site visit\n\n1. On February 22, 1982, Foreign Minister Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann, on behalf of the Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua, invited the IACHR to visit the country and to directly observe the situation of the new ethnic minority settlements on the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe pertinent section of the note addressed to the Executive Secretary of the Commission, Mr. Edmundo Vargas Carreño, reads as follows:\n\nI AM HONORED TO GREET YOU AND TO TRANSMIT TO YOU, ON BEHALF OF THE DIRECTORATE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, A MOST CORDIAL INVITATION FOR THE HONORABLE INTER-AMERICAN COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS TO VISIT NICARAGUA AND MAKE AN ON-SITE OBSERVATION OF THE SITUATION OF THE NEW SETTLEMENTS OF ETHNIC MINORITIES ON THE ATLANTIC COAST OF OUR COUNTRY.\n\n2. The Executive Secretary of the Commission, in reply to the Foreign Minister, indicated that the note would be considered by the IACHR, which would meet on March 1, 1982, at its Fifty-fifth Session.\n\nD. The Misurasata Complaint\n\n1. A few days prior to the invitation of the Nicaraguan Government, the Commission received from the Misurasata organization, whose coordinator General is Mr. Brooklyn Rivera, the first formal complaint Indian Miskito people by the Government of Nicaragua.\n\n2. The complaint was submitted to the Government of Nicaragua on February 24, 1982 in accordance with Article 31 of the Statute of the Commission, with a request for information on the facts described therein. According to the complainant, the facts were as follows.\n\nEVENTS OF DECEMBER 1981\n\na. On December 23, the Sandinista Air Force bombarded the Indian communities Os Asang and San Carlos, located on the bank of the upper Coco River, with “Push and Pull�? airplanes and helicopters, killing 60 Indian brothers with 80-lb bombs. Fifteen brothers were taken prisoner from San Carlos in the direction of Waspan or Puerto Cabezas, and among them were: Rev. Higinio Morazan (the community’s Moravian Minister), Juan Saballos, Julian Mansanares, Noel Wellington, Balandor Barrow, Manuel Saballos, Juan Charles, Alberto Zelaya, and Elsa Barrow.\n\nA military air base and 82 members of the Sandinista Army were installed in Asang. San Carlos received reinforcements of 150 troops, with some Cubans among them. Both communities were militarized to prevent the populations from fleeing to Honduras. The soldiers take away the Indian’s food force them to dig trenches, and forbid them to leave their communities in search of food and other necessities.\n\nb. In Leimus, close to Waspan, 80 brothers from Asang, San Carlos, Waspuk, Krasa, etc., were captured on December 22, as they prepared to travel to their respective communities from Waspan, Puerto Cabezas and Managua in order to spend Christmas and the New Year with their relatives (a Miskito custom). The next night (December 23), the army killed 35 of them, and buried them together in a single grave. Some of those killed were: Norma, Rogelio and Simeon Castro, Joselin and Asel Mercado, Cristina and Mayra Lacayo, Victor and Carlos Perez, Justo Martinez, Villanor Pantin, Roseno Gomez, Luis Fajardo, Efrain Poveda, Celso Flores, Ramiro Damasio, etc. The wives of these brothers were raped by the soldiers from Leimus and later forced to go to their communities. On the 24th, twelve (12) brothers were thrown into the Coco River and killed. On the 26th, four (4) brothers were buried alive near Leimus. The whereabouts of the remaining 80 brothers taken prisoner are unknown. The military base in Leimus runs a concentration camp and a forced labor program for prisoners.\n\nc. In Bluefields, on December 26, 30 Criollos, Indians and Mestizos were imprisoned without any charges. A civilian Criollo was seriously wounded by a soldier for resisting forced recruitment into the Sandinista Army.\n\nd. In the Raudales communities (Raiti, Aniwas, Walakitan, Bokay, etc.) along the Coco River, Indians who are part of the Sandinista Army are thrown into the river with heir hands and feet tied for refusing to take part in the massacre of their brothers in those communities. The corpses of many of these military brothers can be found in the communities of Siksayaru and Andristara. In each of the communities of this zone, there are concentrations of from 100 to 3000 soldiers.\n\nEVENTS OF JANUARY, 1982\n\na. On January 7, 300 soldiers appeared in the Sandy Bay Tara community, repressed the people, militarized the community, and took 40 prisoners to Puerto Cabezas. Many Indians were forced to abandon their community and flee to the mountains.\n\nb. In the Bilwaskarma community of Rio Coco, the Moravian Hospital (the only in the area), was closed and converted into a command headquarters for the army. The community was militarized, and dozens of brothers were taken prisoner, among them, Barbara Diaz (a nurse in the hospital and the daughter of the Minister of the community’s Moravian Church).\n\nc. In the community of Uhri, down-river on the River Coco, six (6) bombs were dropped by a Push and Pull airplane belonging to the Sandinista army, thus forcing the population to take refuge on the Honduran side.\n\nAs a result of the events of Leimus and of Asang-San Carlos, the militarization and bombardment of communities, the capture and massive repression of the Indians, persecution of church and communal leaders, and the constant military threat to exterminate the Indian race, thousands of brothers from the Rio Coco communities fled to Honduras after December 23, joining those who had gone to that country year earlier. Nearly 6,000 Indians from more than 20 entire communities are already in Honduras; among them, are the Siksayari, Andristara, Karisal, Santa Isabel, Krasa, Taniska, San Sang, Kitaski, Krinkrinkia, Pilpilia, Namahka, Winwika, Paliyuhmba (Esperanza), Isulibila (Santa Fe), Wirapahni (San Alberto), Pransa, Nasuni (San Jeronimo), Ipritingni, Bulsirpi, Lakuntara, Wiswis, Nilwas, Uhri. It should be noted that the brothers of these communities left empty-handed, abandoning their homes, their livestock and their other belongings because of the prevailing situation in the region.\n\nRECENT EVENTS\n\nThe FSLN is carrying out an intense political propaganda campaign urging the refugee brothers in Honduras to return to their respective communities, since they know that the refugees have suffered hunger and sickness in that country, and the FSLN is offering food, medicine doctors and every kind of assistance. They say that those who kill and oppress the Indians are the Somocistas or the counterrevolutionaries (??0 and to pay no attention to the lies of other groups. But the Indian people is not to be deceived; they know nothing of the existence of such alleged anti-sandinista armed groups, but they have experienced the oppression and bombardment of their communities, the mass killings of their brothers by the soldiers of Sandinismo. What is ironic in this FSLN campaign is that while their propaganda makes an effort to persuade on the basis of lies, their military sets fire to communities, expropriates the livestock and property of the refugees, and forces the few families who remained in the communities to move to another area as alleged refugees.\n\nBeginning on January 11, the military began to burn houses, temples and schools in the communities of Irpitingni, Pransa, El Carmen, Lakun Tara, Bulsirpi, San Jeronimo, Wirapahni, etc.\n\nAlso, the livestock (cows and horses) of theses communities are being given over to the INRA (Nicaraguan Institute for Agrarian Reform) and they are then used to feed these same officers (who have red meat daily).\n\nIn some communities, such a Santa Fe (Isulibila), Esperanza (Paliyuhmpa) and San Jeronimo (Nasuni) where a few Indian families still remained, the Armed Forces of Sandinismo have forced them to abandon their communities and move to the Tasba Raya area as supposed refugees, under the pretext of protecting them from Somocista and counterrevolutionary groups.\n\nMisurasata DENOUNCES TO THE WORLD THE ETHNOCIDE OF ITS Indians by the Sandinista regime, the massacres at Leimus and Asang-San Carlos, the dozen of prisoners from San Carlos, Sandy Bay Tara, Blue fields, Bilwaskarma, and Leimus, the bombardment and burning of the communities of the Coco River the expropriation of the livestock and other property of the Indian refugees, the persecution of the leaders of the churches and communities, the decision to annihilate the Indian race, the militarization of the communities and especially the defamation campaign to denigrate the authentic struggle of our Indian peoples for their lands and autonomy, which links them to the Somocista or counterrevolutionary groups. We repeat that the Somocistas have always been the enemies of our Indian peoples and we believe that no counterrevolutionary group represents the interests of the Indians of MISURASATA, so that the Indian struggle can in no way be related to the interests of these unknown groups. We denounce that the FSLN, while lacking grounds and fair arguments in the face of the claim of our Indian peoples for the defense of their historical rights, has launched this slanderous campaign to continue to deny us our ancestral rights and in order to exterminate the Nicaraguan Indian race.\n\n3. In a note dated March 31, 1982, which refers to Case Nº 7964 and to the pertinent sections of the complaint which has been transmitted by the Commission in its note of February 24, the Government of Nicaragua merely noted that:\n\nThe Government of National Reconstruction has invited the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to visit and observe in loco the situation of the settlements of the Miskito groups on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua. That invitation was accepted by His Excellency, Mr. Tom Farer, Chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, who will arrive in Nicaragua with a delegation in the first week of May.\n\nThe same note adds that:\n\nOur Government has been obliged to defend our country’s sovereignty and at the same time protect the Miskito population from Somocista bans by relocating them in a safe place where they are not in danger. In the Miskito settlements, the most basic of all rights, the right to life is fully protected. The Government of National Reconstruction and the Sandinista Front for National Liberation carry out integral programs to improve and lend dignity to their living conditions, especially with respect to health, education, and housing.\n\n4. In a note dated May 21, 1982, the Commission reiterated its communication of February 24 to the Government of Nicaragua, and again requested that information it deemed appropriate be submitted to the Commission with respect to the facts in the complaint.\n\n5. In a note dated June 24, 1982, from the Permanent Mission of Nicaragua to the OAS, the Government of Nicaragua replied to the Commission’s request, with a note dated June 23, 1982 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the pertinent sections of which read as follows:\n\nThe Government of Nicaragua was fully convinced that the facts contained in the complaint had been processed by the IACHR during its in situ investigation, carried out from May 4 to 7, and because it was known that these complaints were investigated during the above/mentioned visit carried out at the invitation of the J.G.R.N. to clarify the issue of the Nicaraguans of Miskito origin.\n\nIt is difficult for the Government of Nicaragua, as it would be for any other government, to understand why the complaints received by the IACHR prior to its visit to Nicaragua, and during whose stay we have understood investigated those complaints, still require a written reply, especially since the IACHR had that information and the object of its visit was to confirm the truth or falsity of the facts complained of in Case 7964.\n\nDespite the foregoing, this Ministry, at the request of the National Commission of Human Rights, will again urge the competent authorities to submit their own version with a reasonable period of time, since the previous request only allowed a deadline of ten days.\n\nE. Other complaints and information\n\n1. The Commission also received other complaints and reports from various individuals and institutions which, with some variation, referred to the facts set forth in the original complaint.[2]\n\n2. Within this context, the Commission considers it important to refer to the message of the Bishops conference of Nicaragua of February 18, 1982 addressed to the people and Government of Nicaragua and to the families of Miskitos, Sumos and Ladinos.\n\nThis message is signed by Monsignor Miguel Obando y Bravo, Archbishop of Managua; Monsignor Pablo A. Vega M., Bishoop of Juigalpa; Monsignor Leovigildo Lopez Pitoria, Bishop of Granada; Monsignor Jualian L. Barni S., Bishop of Matagalpa and Apostolic Administrator of Leon; Monsignor Salvador Schlaefer, Apostolic Vicar of Bluefields; Monsignor Ruben Lopez Ardon, Bishop of Esteli and Monsignor Bosco Vivas Robelo, Auxiliary Bishop of Managua. One part of the message reads as follows:\n\nThe events that took place in the Coco River zone, on the border with Honduras, in the Department of Zelaya, Nicaragua, beginning in December, 1981, and which have culminated, on the one hand, in the massive transfer of entire Miskito populations to the interior of the country and on the other, to the flight off a considerable part of the population of that zone to Honduran territory, have had painful effects on all the inhabitants: Miskitos, Sumos and Ladinos of that region.\n\nIt is well know that the armed encounters in that zone that took place during those months led to the death of many members of the militia and soldiers of the Popular Sandinista Army, as well as the death of many of their political adversaries and even some uninvolved citizens.\n\nAs a result of these events, dozens of people have been detained, and almost all of the towns along the Coco River have been evacuated by the army. Even if the massive evacuation of these towns can be explained militarily we still must regret, from a humane and Christian viewpoint, the displacement of these Indian groups whose roots in hat region go bank to time immemorial: displacements both to the settlements established by the Nicaraguan Government in the interior of the country, as well as to Honduras where many Indian fled, perhaps out of fear, or motivated by the sometimes drastic examples of some of the earlier transfers to he above-mentioned settlements.\n\nAs pastors of all our people we feel deeply the suffering caused by the uprooting of these peoples from their lands and we wish them to know that we share their suffering, and that we have for them deep pastoral concern, and fatherly love.\n\nWe recognize the government’s authority, and it right to take the necessary measures to guarantee the defense and integrity of the country’s territory.\n\nWe also recognize the autonomy of the State and its right to take emergency military measures in all or part of the country to effectively defend the country.\n\nNevertheless, we wish to remind every one that there are inalienable rights which under no circumstances may be abridged, and we note with sorrowful surprise that in some specific cases, there have been serious violations of the human rights of individuals and families and even of entire villages:\n\n- Evacuations conducted by the military, with no prior notice or explanation.\n\n- Forced marches of several days with insufficient consideration for the weak, the elderly, women and children.\n\n- Charges of counterrevolutionary collaboration aimed at entire groups of the population.\n\n- The destruction of homes, belongings and livestock.\n\n- Also, the death of individuals under circumstances which, very much to our regret, remind us of the drama which our brothers in the region are living.\n\nThese facts move us to denounce vigorously, attitudes on the part of those who, having power and force in their hands, should always be the first to guarantee the observance of human rights; and to urge the competent authorities to apply the disciplinary measures which would prevent a repetition of such events in the future.\n\nIn addition, recalling that the integrity of the country’s territory must be protected as a historic duty of all Nicaraguans, once the integrity of the national territory is secured, one must also recall that it is a right and a duty to protect the legitimate possession and enjoyment of the riches of the natural, traditional and cultural patrimony of the Indian peoples of the Atlantic coast, in whom we find and recognize with pride not only the ancestry of the race, but also the identity of our age-old, pre-Hispanic nationalities.\n\nHaving briefly put forward these facts that describe a situation where the dignity of the individual has not been respected and there has been a violation of their rights, as pastors, and in open solidarity with the Miskitos, Sumos and Ladinos of the Atlantic coast, we request that the competent authorities carry out an objective investigation and take the proper measures to promote peace and tranquility, by guaranteeing justice in the region.\n\nF. The IACHR considers the matter at its 55th session\n\n1. In March 1982, the Commission held its 55th session, and considered the invitation extended by the Government of Nicaragua to visit the Atlantic coast of the country, and also considered the complaints that it had received with respect to alleged violations of the human rights of the Miskitos.\n\n2. The Commission decided to accept the invitation extended by the Government, in the terms of a cable sent by the Chairman of the IACHR, Professor Tom J. Farer, to his Excellency, Mr. Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann, Minister of Foreign Affairs, which is cited below:\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights at its 55th session has taken note of the invitation of the Government of National Reconstruction for this Commission to carry out and on-site investigation of the situation of the new settlements of ethnic minorities on the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua.\n\nThe Commission accepts this invitation in the understanding that pursuant to its jurisdiction it may carry out the activities that it deems necessary and advisable to clarify the facts related to the situation of the ethnic minorities in the Atlantic zone of Nicaragua and to contribute to the observance of the Human Rights of these minorities. The Commission has requested me to contact officials of your Excellency’s distinguished Government in Washington in order to reach agreement with them as to the details of the timing and duration for this visit, the schedule of activities that the Commission will carry out in the various places that it will visit and the facilities that should be provided by the Nicaraguan authorities to ensure the success of this mission. In addition to expressing the gratitude of the Commission to you for this invitation; I reiterate the assurances of my highest esteem and consideration.\n\n3. At the same time, the IACHR authorized its Chairman, in consultation with the other members, to appoint a Special Commission which would visit Nicaragua[4] and instructed the Executive Secretary to obtain authorization from the government of Honduras to visit the camp of Nicaraguan Miskito refugees located in the area of Mocoron, Honduras.[5]\n\n4. In view of the special importance of this case, the Commission devoted several sessions to its study, and in accordance with its Statute, held hearings and received testimony from individuals who had requested them. In addition, it received the representatives of the Government of Nicaragua who had asked to be heard by the Commission.\n\nThose who gave testimony to the Commission were Mr. Steadman Fagoth Muller, Reverend Graham J. Rights and Mr. Armstrong Wiggins.\n\n5. Mr. Steadman Fagoth, former Representative of Misurasata on the Council of State, repeated in a written presentation the charges that he had put forward on other occasions. According to Mr. Fagoth, a large part of the Indian population of the east coast of Nicaragua had been massacred, which constituted genocide< the Miskitos who had not fled to Honduras had been interned in concentration camps, after their property had been burned or otherwise destroyed; and the compulsory relocation to these camps had led to the deaths of those who were unable to survive the harsh conditions of the relocation.\n\n6. Reverend Graham J. Rights, Executive Director of the Moravian Church of the United States of America, in his testimony referred to the religious work carried out by Moravian pastors in that region of Nicaragua and how they had been affected by the conflict. He emphatically denied that the Moravian pastors had carried out counterrevolutionary activities, and stated that if in some cases some kind of involvement had been proven, those pastors had been suspended from their official duties. Finally, Reverend Rights requested the Commission to investigate recent events and to act as a mediator between the Government of Nicaragua and the Miskito Indians in seeking a satisfactory solution to this matter.\n\n7. Mr. Armstrong Wiggins, who had coordinated the regional Misurasat leadership in the Atlantic region in 1980 and the early months of 1981, submitted testimony on his own behalf and on behalf of the Us Indian Law Resource Center.\n\nCited below are parts of Mr. Wiggins testimony:\n\nAlthough there has been difficulty in obtaining factual information from that area, we have now received much reliable information which leads us to conclude that the Indians of the east coast are presently suffering a gross violation of their most basic human rights.\n\nThousands of Indians have been forcibly relocated by the Sandinista Government and are now interned in concentration camps far from their home villages. Many have been killed and injured. An unknown number have been imprisoned. Many Indian villages have been burned. Indian livestock and some Indian religious leaders have been imprisoned and others have been forced to leave the country. There are reports of forced labor by those held in the camps. The frontier area from which the Indians have been removed has been completely militarized, and almost all other Indian villages have been place under direct control by military authorities.\n\nIn the view of Mr. Wiggins, the relocation of the Indians and the destruction of their property cannot be justified by the Nicaraguan Government’s need to control counterrevolutionary activities.\n\nAccording to this line of reasoning, counterrevolutionaries operating out of Honduras had successfully infiltrated many Indian communities on the Nicaraguan side of the border and had created a situation where a “fifth column�? of counterrevolutionary Indians was preparing to join with an invading army from Honduras. To remove this threat to national security, all the Indians were removed from the area and a military zone was created.\n\nThis argument would admit that the relocation of Indians and the destruction of Indian property were at least in part, punitive. Moreover, it suggests that the entire civilian population in the area is being punished for what might at most be the crimes of only a few. This situation is much like the situation which the United States Government created during World War II when it relocated and interned in concentration camps the entire Japanese-American community as an alien, untrustworthy population. It is now generally agreed that the decision to relocate and intern the Japanese I a shameful chapter in United States history, and that such treatment of a racial group would today be recognized as a violation of fundamental rights.\n\nFurthermore, we call on all concerned to investigate closely why there has been discontent within the Indian communities, and why the central government now views them as a dangerous, alien presence which must be confined and controlled. Are we to accept the timeworn cliché that this is merely a situation where outside agitators are stirring up the happy natives? We firmly believe that there will be no harmony between the Indians and the Sandinista Revolutionary Government unless and until there is a good faith agreement which respects the Indian’s rights to self-determination and to their property and the resources of their territories. By taking the opposite approach, by forcibly imposing its will and denying fundamental Indian rights, the Sandinista Government has dramatically widened the gulf between itself and the Indians of Nicaragua and has thereby helped to undermine its own true security.\n\n8. Mr. Wiggins concluded by stating that in his opinion the government of Nicaragua had violated articles 1, 6, 7, 11, 15, 16, 21, and 22 of the American Convention on Human Rights, detailing the role of the Government in the violation of those rights.\n\n9. Also in the course of its 55th session, the Commission received a delegation of the Government of Nicaragua which described the situation of the new settlements given to the Miskito Indians in the Atlantic region of the country. The delegation was composed of Dr. Leonte Herdocia, Chairman of the national commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Nicaragua; Casimiro Sotelo, Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the OAS; Commander Humberto Campbell, Vice Minister for Atlantic Coast Affairs; Mr. Saul Arana, Ambassador, Alternative Representative to the OAS; Mr. Sixto Ulloa, Coordinator of the Evangelical Committee for Assistance to the Poor (CEPAD) and Reverend John Wilson, bishop of the Moravian Church.\n\n10. In its statement, the delegation ratified the terms of the Government’s invitation to the Commission to visit the new settlements to which the Miskitos who had lived on the banks of the Coco River had been resettled. In addition, each member of the delegation briefly presented the reasons which, in the opinion of the Government of Nicaragua, justified the relocation of that population, and gave details on the conditions and characteristics of the settlements. In particular, the delegation referred to the relocation of the communities and how the evacuation was carried out, and pointed out that it took place without a resistance from the Miskito tribes and without a single casualty in the civilian population. They also stated that pregnant women, children and the elderly were transported by helicopter or trucks, and that the rest of the population that traveled on foot was given the necessary food and medical assistance.\n\nThe delegation explicitly acknowledged that Government agents proceeded to burn down houses, the personal belongings, furniture and other possessions of these families, and slaughtered their animals and set fire to their churches and crop fields, in order to leave no shelter or food for the armed insurgent groups that operate in the zone.\n\nAmbassador Leonte Herdocia stated that it was quite possible that in the course of the evacuation some excesses had been committed by the authorities charged with carrying it out, but that they had been exaggerated by the international campaign to denigrate the Government of Nicaragua.\n\nWith respect to the scope of the invitation extended to the Commission to carry out an in loco visit, one of the members of the IACHR inquired if that visit would have to be limited to the zone where the new settlements were located, or if the places inhabited by the Miskitos prior to their relocation could also be visited. In reply, the delegates of the Government of Nicaragua considered that it was practically impossible to visit the places from which the Miskitos had been removed since it is a high security military zone and they would therefore have to consult with the government, which would give the definitive reply.\n\n11. At its 55th session, the Commission also studied other information and testimony that had been submitted to it in writing.\n\nG. Subsequent complaints and information\n\n1. After its 55th session, the Commission continued to receive complaints and information on this matter. Among these, the Commission specifically wishes to refer to the presentation made by the Coordinator-General of Misurasata, Mr. Brooklyn Rivera.\n\n2. In his written statement of April 8, 1982, Mr. Rivera explained the origins of the dispute of the Indian populations of the Atlantic coast with the Government of Nicaragua, and proposed a negotiated settlement that would allow the Indians use of their lands and autonomy within the state of Nicaragua. Some paragraphs of his document are cited below:\n\nThe principal reason for the Indian rights crisis in Nicaragua is the antagonism created by the Sandinista government policy which denies the ethnic identity of our Indian peoples. It follows that the recognition of Indian rights to their territory and their autonomy is also denied. The government’s policy requires assimilation of Indians to the philosophy and culture of those who control the government in Managua, thus converting us into peasants and mestizos without definition and aboriginal rights.\n\nThis basic conflict with Indian rights has been revealed since the triumph of the revolution in 1979. Immediately after the revolution the revolution the Indian leadership has great faith in the Sandinista government and in the process of the revolution. We tried to walk as a people and as an organization with the current of the revolution and not against it. Later we learned that the Sandinista leaders never had good intentions towards our Indian peoples. Despite our efforts to work together as allies of the revolution, the Sandinista government consistently tried to impose its own will on MISURASATA and on the Indian peoples in general. We learned through experience that the government had no respect for our Indian customs and values, our traditional way of life and ancient rights.\n\nSeveral MISURASATA leaders, including myself, stayed in Nicaragua after our release from prison and interrogation. We and all Indian leaders other than Steadman Fagoth had been cleared of all allegations of Somocista and counterrevolutionary activities. Our hope was to find a peaceful solution to the growing crisis through negotiations with the Sandinista government. We were worried that Somocista or other counterrevolutionary forces would try to use our people for their own ends and we believed that an agreement could be negotiated which would protect the rights of our Indian peoples and the security of the Nicaraguan government.\n\nWe had talks with the Sandinista government and we had the government’s agreement to go to Honduras and meet with those Indian leaders who had fled. It became very clear to us at that meeting that there was a great lack of trust among many of our people in Honduras. The past dishonesty of the Sandinista government, the many arrest of our people and the general repression in our Indian communities by military authorities had generated fear and suspicion among Indian peoples that even we might be agents for the Sandinista government. Upon our return to Managua, the Sandinista government openly turned against us and we were accused of simply fomenting counterrevolution. We were told that we had no choice but to join the Sandinista government, that we could not be “in the middle�?, that we were either for the revolutionary government or against it. We were subjected to intimidation, and some of our group were even threatened at gunpoint. I personally was told that if I did not take an administrative position with the Sandinista government and work to carry out the government’s policies, that the government would not be responsible for my life.\n\nThese events made clear that denial of true Indian leadership and Indian self-determination was absolute. At the same time the denial of cultural rights had become very obvious as the literacy campaign was halted in our communities, and as the government began its practice of teaching our Indian children in Spanish rather than their native languages. Here again we saw the dishonesty of a government which preached bilingual education but which practiced instruction designed to assimilate our peoples to another way of life.\n\nAs we made our last efforts to negotiate with the Sandinista government in June, July and August 1981, it also became clear that the government has decides to deny us our basic Indian land rights, the most important matter in the crisis. We told the government in June that a solution to the dispute over Indian land rights would be the key to resolving the Indian crisis. The government agreed that we would present a written statement of our position in July, but while we were in the process of preparing that documents the government decreed it Agrarian Reform Law which announced that the government would “give�? to Indian people defined parcels or sections of land which each village would hold under an “agrarian title�?. This decree denied Indian ownership of all the lands of the Indian territory of the east coast of Nicaragua and set in motion a process which would promote confrontations between individual Indian communities. Once again Indian rights had been denied in a policy dictated by the government in Managua.\n\nShortly after the Agrarian Reform Law decree, we presented our own document which contained three principal points:\n\n1. Indian land rights in Indian Territory must be recognized as a whole and not as parcels or sections granted by the government.\n\n2. Indians must be guaranteed their right to the natural resources of their territory.\n\n3. The Indian right to self-determination or autonomy within their territory must be recognized.\n\nThese three points were flatly rejected by the Sandinista government at a meeting in the first week of August. Our demands were criticized as counterrevolutionary demands of Steadman Fagoth and as separatism. We were unable persuade the government that these demands are not those of any individual but of all Indians of the Americas and that the autonomy or self-determination which we sought did not mean separatism or complete independence.\n\nIn little more than two yeas time the relationship of Indians to the Sandinista government deteriorated from harmony to extreme crisis. Today all the legitimate Nicaraguan Indian leadership is either in exile or underground. The unprecedented destruction of our communities and the undeniable assault on our peoples and their way of life has led to despair and anger. Some of our people have already engaged in confrontations with Sandinista forces, and many others are prepared and willing to flight for their fundamental rights.\n\nSuch a fight would, of course, compound the suffering and the tragedy already experienced. It must be avoided if at all possible.\n\nMy hope and my sincere intention is to convince all interested people of the gravity of the crisis and of the urgent need for sincere negotiations between our Indian leadership and the Sandinista government. The participation support and encouragement of international human rights organizations and others will be necessary to make such talks a reality and to guarantee the implementation of the agreement which we will seek. We firmly believe that the basis for a comprehensive solution of the problems and struggle necessarily should begin with an honest compromise policy which includes FSLN recognition of the existence of Indian nations and their land base, aboriginal rights and the right to an Indian national personality. We continue to believe that we can arrive at an agreement which will protect the basic Indian rights to land and self-determination. Such an agreement would bring an end to the Indian crisis in Nicaragua, and just as important would serve as a model for other Indian peoples throughout the Americas who have been closely watching our struggle.\n\nH. On-site observation in Nicaragua in May, 1982\n\n1. In accordance with the scheduled program, a special Commission of the IACHR began the planned in loco visit to Nicaragua on May 1, 1982. The members of that Special Commission were Mr. Tom J. Farer, Chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Cesar Sepulveda and Dr. Luis Demetrio Tinoco Castro. The Special Commission was accompanied by Drs. Christina Cerna and Manuel Velasco Clark, attorneys of the Executive Secretariat, and Messrs. Juan Carlos Goldie and Marcelo Montecino, the former as administrative support staff and the second as the interpreter for Mr. Farer.\n\n2. During the course of its stay in Nicaragua, the Special Commission held interviews with the members of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, with the Minister of the Interior, with members of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Bluefields Court of Appeals, with the National Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, with authorities of Nicaraguan Institute for the Atlantic Coast (INICA), and with other civilian and military, national and departmental authorities, as well as with the head of the Seventh Military Region of the Atlantic coast.\n\n3. The Commission also met with representatives of various religious, humanitarian and professional institutions of the country, from which it received important testimony with respect to the problems involved in the case considered in this report.\n\n4. On Monday, May 3, 1982 at 2:00p.m., the Commission visited the “Héroes y Mártires de Nueva Guinea�? penitentiary, formerly the Zona Franca prison, and following a tour of the installations where approximately 125 Miskitos of both sexes were in detention, proceeded to select a large group of prisoners to speak with them, in private. For assistance the Commission contracted the services of a Miskito interpreter.\n\n5. On Tuesday, May 4, 1982 at 7:00 a.m., the Commission traveled in a Nicaraguan Air Force plane to the mining center of Bonanza, and from there to Rosita, accompanied by Drs. Julio Cesar Aviles and Orlando Matus del Carmen, of the National Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Father Edgard Parrales, Ambassador of Nicaragua to the OAS, Moravian Bishop John Wilson, the legal adviser of the Ministry of the Interior, Dr. Melvin Wallace, and 2 delegates from CEPAD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, respectively.\n\n6. In Rosita, Mr. Julio Rocha, Vice Minister of the Nicaraguan Institute for the Atlantic coast, explained to the Special Commission the scope of the “Tasba Pri�? project and how the settlements in Wasminona, Truslaya, Sahsa, Columbus and Sumubila had been planned and organized and how they currently operate.\n\n7. Continuing its tour by land from Rosita, in the Central Zone of Nicaraguan territory, to Puerto Cabezas on the Atlantic coast, the Commission visited the new settlements of Sahsa and Sumubila. On that occasion, it spoke with relocated Miskitos in order to hear directly from them their own versions of the events, the reason for the relocation and how it had been carried out; the Subcommission also sought to inform itself as to the reaction of the Miskitos population to the resettlement and their current circumstance, and on the conditions pursuant to which they carry out their activities.\n\n8. After spending the night in Puerto Cabezas, the Special Commission visited the Chief of the Seventh Military Region of that area, commander Manuel Calderon –Comandante Rufo- and later visited the Detention Center of that military region where 47 Miskitos were detained, in order to obtain information on the conditions of their detention, their state of mind, and to speak with them directly about the events that took place on the banks of the Coco River. Following other scheduled interviews, the Commission traveled by air to Bluefields.\n\n9. At noon on Wednesday, May 5, 1982, the Special Commission arrived in the city of Bluefields, and interviewed members of the Court of Appeals in order to obtain information on developments in the proceedings against the Miskitos whose cases were pending before that court at the time of this visit.\n\n10. The Special Commission also spoke with the defense attorneys for the accused, and discovered that none of them has met with clients or even spoken with them.\n\n11. Finally, while still in Bluefields, the Special Commission held private talks with Monsignor Salvador Schlaefer, Apostolic Vicar of Bluefields and co-author of the message issued on February 18, 1982 by the Conference of Bishops of Nicaragua.\n\n12. In Managua, on May 6, 1982 the Commission took leave of the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction, represented by its member, Dr. Rafael Cordoba Rivas, to whom the Commission submitted a document containing the preliminary recommendations that the Commission considered should be implemented immediately[6] and thus concluded its in loco visit. The Commission subsequently gave a press conference in which it expressed it thanks to the official authorities, the press, and the various representative institutions of the Nicaraguan community and to the people of Nicaragua for the facilities and hospitality offered to it.\n\nI. In loco visit to Honduras\n\n1. On May 7, 1982 at 6:45a.m., a Special Subcommission left Nicaragua for the city of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in order to continue its investigation. The Subcommission consisted of Dr. Luis Demetrio Tinoco Castro, who was assisted by Dr. Christina Cerna, Dr. Manuel Velasco Clark and Mr. Carlos Goldie.\n\n2. After arriving in Tegucigalpa, the Subcommission, accompanied by the general counsel of the Foreign Ministry, Dr. Ernesto Paz, was taken immediately in a Honduran Air Force plane to Puerto Lempira, capital of the Gracias a Dios Department, the zone corresponding to the Honduran Moskitia.[7] It was received by the Military Commander of that region, major Leonel Luque, who personally drove the members of the Subcommission to Mocoron.\n\n3. The Subcommission toured the refugee camp of Mocoron, which at that time sheltered 8,154 Miskitos, and held various interviews with the Nicaraguan Miskitos, whom it visited in their homes, churches and communal meeting centers.\n\n4. The Subcommission also held a two hour meeting with a group of individuals representative of the Miskito community in the communal meeting room of the camp, where it received testimony on the events that took place on the banks of the Coco River. In addition, the Subcommission had an opportunity to question several Indians on the possibilities of reuniting the Miskito family and on their interest in returning to Nicaragua.\n\n5. Despite the enormous population congregated in this refugee camp, the Subcommittee noted that it had no wire fences or control posts for the entry or exit of the Nicaraguan Miskitos, and that they had total freedom of movement; it also noted that the military control personnel assigned to maintain order among the refugees consisted of only 7 soldiers.\n\n6. The Subcommission stayed in Mocoron until after 10p.m. to continue its personal interviews with members of the Miskito Community and the officials of the Christian Churches working in that area. It also met with staff members of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and with personnel from the World Relief Services that work in that camp.\n\n7. On Saturday May 8, 1982, the Subcommission returned to Tegucigalpa and held an interview with the Director of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Guy Prim. The Subcommission also met with Mr. Tom Hawk, Director of World Relief Services in Honduras. Matters related to the situation of the Nicaraguan Miskito refugees in the Mocoron camp and possible solutions were discussed at both meetings.\n\n8. On Sunday, May 9, 1982, the Subcommission concluded its activities in the Republic of Honduras and through the good offices of the Representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its gratitude to the Government of Honduras and in particular to its Foreign Minister, Dr. Edgardo Paz Barnica, for the facilities and full support extended to it in carrying out its mission.\n\nJ. Preliminary recommendations\n\n1. As stated above, at the conclusion of its visit to Nicaragua, the Commission submitted to the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction a document containing preliminary recommendations aimed at improving the situation of human rights of the ethnic groups of the Atlantic coast.\n\n2. The text of the document is cited below:\n\nPRELIMINARY RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) reiterates, first, its gratitude to the Junta of the Government of National Reconstruction for the invitation extended to it to visit Nicaragua and observe in situ the situation of human rights of the ethnic groups of the Atlantic coast of that country. It also acknowledges the cooperation and support offered throughout by the governmental authorities to assist the Commission in carrying out its mission.\n\nThe Commission takes this occasion to set forth some preliminary considerations and recommendations.\n\nHaving concluded this visit at its next session in June, the Commission will have occasion to submit to the Government of Nicaragua its final recommendations, after studying in greater detail the situation that gave rise to this visit.\n\n1. The problem of the ethnic groups in the settlements\n\nIt appears to the Commission that the populations that were relocated have been affected in very different ways by the resettlement. In particular, not a few of them have suffered the loss of their homes, livestock and other property.\n\nThe Commission considers that the injury they have suffered could be substantially reduced in two ways: a. by assurances that in the near future, when there is no longer danger in the border zone, those who wish to return to their former homes may do so; and b. by assurances that those involved will receive adequate compensation for the damage done to their private property.\n\n2. Reunification of families\n\nOn the basis of interviews held with various members of the communities that were visited, it is clear that they are deeply concerned for their family members located in Honduras.\n\nThe Commission considers that there is a deep desire to bring about the reunification of the Miskito family, and that many Indians located in Honduras would return if they had the necessary guarantees and assurances.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the Government of Nicaragua make use of intergovernmental agency channels to facilitate the return of the Miskitos to their own country, through the coordinated action of the Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua, with the participation of an international agency in a supervisory role.\n\n3. Conditions of detention\n\nThe Commission visited the Miskitos who are detained in the “Héroes y Mártires de Nueva Guinea�? prison, the former Zona Franca in Managua, and the detention center in Puerto Cabezas.\n\nThe Commission considers that there are three aspects to be noted with respect to “Héroes y Mártires de Nueva Guinea�? prison. The first is what appears to be frequent punishment, consisting of being stripped and left naked in groups for prolonged periods. The second is restrictions on visit; they are kept almost entirely incommunicado, a situation which deserves special consideration due to the fact that family members who come from Managua must make enormous sacrifices in time and money to come visit them. Third, the Commission also recommends that sick detainees be given immediate and competent medical care.\n\nWith respect to the Miskitos confined in the detention center of Puerto Cabezas, the Commission considers that the conditions under which they are detained are restricted and inadequate in view of the fact that it is a provisional detention center, despite the fact that improvements have recently been made due to the efforts of the Chief of Operations of the Center. It is also recommended that sick detainees be given immediate and competent medical care.\n\n4. Right to due process\n\nThe Commission has found that there is a substantial number of detainees in Puerto Cabezas who have not yet been submitted to the process established by law. They have been imprisoned for over two months in unsuitable conditions. In this regard, the Commission hopes that the Government will act expeditiously immediately to submit them to due process or release them, as appropriate.\n\nIn conformity with the principle of the presumption of innocence, the Commission recommends that the statements of self-incrimination made by the accused be taken in the presence of a judge and a defense attorney in accordance with the law that governs criminal proceedings in Nicaragua. By taking measures to ensure that all confessions are taken in conformity with the law, the government would reduce the risk of the occurrence of mistreatment during the interrogation process. The Commission therefore considers it improper to televise the incriminating testimony given by the defendants themselves before a final decision is handed down in the trials. Television broadcasting of these statements leads public opinion to pre-judge the culpability of the defendants.\n\nIf the Miskitos have to remain in detention form a greater period of time as a result of the final judgments reached in their cases, the Commission recommends that they be transferred to places near their zone of origin to serve their sentences.\n\nOn June 15, 1982, the Commission received a cable from the Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Hugo Tinoco, addressed to the Chairman of the Commission, in which he refers to the implementation by the Government of Nicaragua with these preliminary recommendations. That document reads as follows:\n\nI am honored to greet Your Excellency to refer to preliminary recommendation submitted Junta of Government of Reconstruction May 7 on invitation extended by my Government to IACHR to visit Nicaragua and observe situation of the human rights of the Nicaraguan citizens of Miskito origin residing in Zelaya Department (north).\n\na. With respect to the first recommendation, the Government of Nicaragua guarantees, as was stated by member of the Junta Dr. Rafael Cordoba Rivas, assurances that when border danger passes, those who wish to return to their places of origin may do so and that the Government of Nicaragua has provided more than the adequate compensation suggested by giving these Nicaraguan citizen lands, homes seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, food and medical attention, totally without charge.\n\nb. With respect to reunification of families, the government guarantees assurances for the return of Nicaraguans in Honduran territory and to this effect lists are being updated of all families residing in the Tasba Pri settlements to be transmitted by the UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross to those Nicaraguans who moved to Honduras so that they may verify false statements that their families have been killed.\n\nc. With respect to the conditions of detention, instructions have been given to give full respect to the dignity of these Nicaraguan citizens explaining that in the penitentiary system the only times when they may be fully searched (without clothes) is when entering or leaving workshops due to the danger of their taking with them scissors, knives, razors, pocket knives or sharp instruments that are used in the workshops for shoemaking, saddlery carpentry, tailoring, etc., but offering to reduce insofar as possible these searches, while safeguarding the security of the detainees and guards. The penitentiary reports that the family members have the right at any time to visit their detained relatives and this rule will be institutionalized by order. Also, medical care has been reinforced and measures are being taken to make improvements in the detention center.\n\nd. All detained persons are submitted to due process and their cases are on appeal and awaiting decision in the Court of Appeals of Bluefields. The Government of Nicaragua has fully prohibited presentation by radio or television of the statements given by the defendants prior to a final verdict in the trials. Both the Supreme Court of Justice and the National Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights are actively working on these matters, and the latter has sent two attorneys to observe the work of the defense counsel.\n\ne. Should the final verdict in these cases require longer detention of Nicaraguan citizens of Miskito origin, every effort will be made, within the severe economic constraints experienced by the country as a result of the recent disaster caused by floods, to have the sentences carried out in places close to where they lived previously.\n\nThe Government of Nicaragua reaffirms its will to maintain an ongoing and fruitful dialogue with the Honorable Commission and to this end would be grateful for information on the result of the visit made to Honduras by the IACHR and on the interviews held with the Nicaraguan residents with respect to desires expressed to return to Nicaragua. We maintain contact with Mr. Philippe Sargisson, a senior official of the UNCHR and with the help of the local headquarters in coordination with the Government of Honduras and the Office in Tegucigalpa; provisions can be implemented with respect to their return.\n\nK. The Commission adopts its Special Report on the situation of the Human Rights of the Miskito Indians in Nicaragua\n\n1. On June 26, 1982, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, at its 56th session, adopted the “Special Report on the Situation of Human Rights of the Miskito Indians in Nicaragua�?.[8]\n\n2. The Report extensively analyzes the various problems that arose on the Atlantic coast with respect to the sector of the Nicaraguan population of Miskito origin, following the events of late 1981 and early 1982.\n\nIn the above-mentioned report, the IACHR particularly studied the existence and observance of the following human rights that affect this sector of Nicaraguan: a. the right to life; b. the rights to liberty, personal security and due process; c. the right to residence and d. the right to property. The Commission also extensively studied in this report whether the Miskito Indians could invoke special rights as an ethnic group.[9]\n\n3. Upon provisional adoption of these conclusions, which were transmitted to the Government of National Reconstruction of Nicaragua together with the Report, the Commission proposed the following recommendations:\n\na. To allow Misurasata or another Indian organization chosen by the Indian communities themselves to function, and to authorize the return of is leaders to Nicaragua, with guarantees of their security and liberty;\n\nb. To continue to seek an agreement with the Government of Honduras to guarantee peace on the common border in order to prevent potential conflicts;\n\nc. To investigate all matters related to the violation of the right to life of the Miskito Indians and to bring to trial and sanction with the full force of the law those who are found to be responsible.\n\nd. To consider the relocation of the Miskito Indian in Tasba Pri as a provisional measure, to be limited to the time required by the current emergency;\n\ne. Once the emergency has ended to allow the return of the Miskito Indian who wish to do so from Tasba Pri to their homes by the Coco River;\n\nf. To facilitate, if possible, the voluntary repatriation the Miskitos of Mocoron, with the assistance if possible of the Government of Honduras and of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR);\n\ng. To facilitate, while the emergency lasts, the exchange of information through the International Red Cross and the UNHCR between the Miskitos residing in Tasba Pri and those in Mocoron to contribute to family reunification and voluntary repatriation;\n\nh. To facilitate, under the auspices of the UNHCR, the voluntary resettlement of any Miskito of Tasba Pri to Mocoron or from Mocoron to Tasba Pri, to rejoin the family group, for the duration of the emergency.\n\ni. To permit, during the emergency, the return of the religious who serve the Misikito population of the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua so that they may perform religious services for their people;\n\nj. To consider the possibility of an amnesty for the pastors of the Moravian Church who have been tried or detained;\n\nk. To guarantee freedom of association and assembly, without interference, in the camps of the new settlements, to allow the Miskito community to maintain its cultural identity, preserve its traditional structure and facilitate its participation in the decisions of the community;\n\nl. To clarify the number and location of detained Miskitos, to publish a complete list of their names and the detention centers where they are held;\n\nm. To declare null and void the decisions made by Judge Casaya in the Cases of the Miskito Indians who were accused of “counterrevolutionary�? activities, and to retry the accused in accordance with the guarantees of the right to due process;\n\nn. To study a just solution to the problem of the Indian Lands that will fulfill both the aspirations of the Indians as well as the economic interest and the territorial unity of the Republic;\n\no. To compensate the Miskitos of the Coco River as soon as possible for the loss of their homes, crops, animals and other belongings;\n\np. To include, on the basis of their merits, representative figures of the Miskito community in important positions in the administration of the Atlantic coast region.\n\nL. Later developments\n\n1. On August 24, 1982 the Government of Nicaragua replied to the Commission on the report that had been submitted to it by the IACHR. In the reply, the Nicaraguan Government analyzed the conclusions and recommendations put forward by the Commission, and proposed that it assume the role of mediator in order to reach a friendly settlement, in conformity with Article 48-1(f) of the American Convention on Human Rights. The Government of Nicaragua indicated the procedure that should be followed for the purpose.\n\nThe proposal of the Government of Nicaragua was considered by the Commission at its (special) 57th session, which was held in September in San José, Costa Rica.[9]\n\n2. Although at that and all subsequent sessions up to the adoption of this report, the subject of human rights of the Nicaraguans of Miskito origin was principally considered in the context of the process of reaching a friendly settlement which the Commission has undertaken, the Commission also continued to be concerned with the general situation of the Miskito Indians, and it received all information concerning new events which were taking place in the northern zone of the Department of Zelaya, and adopted the measures at its disposal.\n\n3. Among the events that took place following the adoption of the Report on June 26, 1982, note should be taken of the harassment by government authorities and soldiers of the Sandinista Army of the Miskito towns and villages; the frequent skirmishes between the Sandinista Army and armed insurgent groups generally comprising or supported by Miskitos that took place in the northern part of the Department of Zelaya, particularly in locations near Puerto Cabezas, and which led to dozen of deaths; the November 4, 1982 declaration of the territory of 24 municipalities in the Departments of Chinandega, Madriz, Nueva Segovia, Jinotega and Zelaya, adjacent to the border zone with Honduras, as a military emergency zone; the consolidation of the Tasba Pri settlements; the relocation in November and December of 1982 of approximately 4,000 Miskitos from their villages in the Coco River and the Bokay River zone, in the Department of Jinotega, to settlements located in the interior of the same department; the accident on December 9, 1982, which took place in the course of the relocation of several Miskito children to these new settlements, and which claimed the lives of 75 of them and of 9 of their mothers, when the helicopter transporting them accident ally crashed; the increase in the number of detentions of Miskitos, and the subsequent release of some of them; the transfer of nearly 400 Miskitos, prisoners to Managua, first to the Zona Franca prison and then to the Granja del Régimen Abierto (minimal security work farm); the flight to Honduras of hundreds of Nicaraguan Miskitos; the claim of disappearances of Miskitos; and the sentences handed down on September 16, 1983 by the Supreme Court of Nicaragua, which by nullifying the criminal proceedings overturned the sentences that had been given by the Court of Appeals of Bluefields and dismissed the charges against the accused.\n\nThese facts, which were not included in the previous report, were given special consideration by the IACHR, and they are considered Part II of this Report.\n\n4. At sessions held following the adoption of the Report on June 26, 1982, the Commission received the testimony of several individuals and of representatives of institutions concerned with the situation of the Miskitos. Thus, at its (special) 57th session, held in San Jose, Costa Rica in September 1982, the Commission received the testimony of Mr. Rafael Zelaya Herrera, representing Misurasata, who insisted on the preconditions that the Government of Nicaragua should establish to make possible mediation between the Miskito people and the Government. Among these preconditions, Mr. Zelaya Herrera insisted on the release of all imprisoned Miskitos and on “an end to the massacre of the Miskito Indians.�?\n\n5. At its 58th session, held in November of 1982, the Commission gave a special hearing to Dr. Leonte Herdocia, National Commissioner for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, and to Ambassador Edgard Parrales, permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the OAS. In addition, in another interview it spoke with Reverend Fernando Colomer, Superintendent of the Moravian Church of Nicaragua, who submitted a document titled “Considerations with respect to Peace and Reconciliation in Nicaragua: An Indian Proposal�?. In the course of this session, the Commission also gave a hearing to Mr. Tillet Mullins and four other members of the Council of Elders, all of whom are currently exiled in Honduras. The group’s spokesman, Mr. Wyciffe Diego, stated on its behalf that 15,000 Miskitos had left Nicaragua for Honduras due to repression and terror and that they were opposed to the repatriation of Miskitos from Honduras to Nicaragua. The Council of Elders also submitted several documents summarizing their viewpoints to the Commission.\n\n6. At its 59th session, held in April 1983, the Commission received Mr. Armstrong Wiggins of the Indian Law Resource Center. According to Mr. Wiggins, the procedure to reach a friendly settlement has failed because the human rights situation of the Miskito peoples according to him, had led to the machine-gunning of 4300 Miskitos by the Nicaraguan Air Force as they tried to reach the border with Honduras after abandoning one of the relocation camps. He said that hundreds of Miskitos had been killed or wounded in confrontations with the army, that others had been arbitrarily arrested and interrogated and that perhaps over 600 were currently imprisoned, accused of counterrevolutionary activities. Mr. Wiggins added that the entire region was still under military occupation, and that Indian leaders had been replaced by officers of the Sandinista Government and Security Forces, while access to the northeast region of Nicaragua was closed off and the Government insisted that all of the problems arose from an external imperialistic conspiracy. As a result, Mr. Wiggings added that the mediating role of the Commission should be terminated, and without prejudice to subsequent renewal of the process, the report should be published now.\n\nIn the course of that session, the Commission also interviewed Mrs. Margarita Wilde of the Moravian Church of the United States, who had been to Nicaragua the previous month. She stated that the role of the Commission had been very positive and that it would be regrettable if no progress were made in the search for a friendly settlement. Mrs. Wilde added that the Commission still had much to do, either on its own or in cooperation with the ICRC and the UNCHR, in contributing to improving the circumstances under which the Miskitos live. Mrs. Wilde added three matters of particular concern to her: 1. The fact that some 60-70 persons had disappeared, of whom the Moravian Church has a list; 2. The fact that the cases of the accused Miskitos are currently at a standstill in the Supreme Court of Justice; and 3. That the rules of due process have not been followed in these cases. In response to a question from the Chairman, Mrs. Wilde replied that the only institutions that at this time genuinely united the Miskitos in Nicaragua is the Moravian Church, which nevertheless does not wish to assume a role of political representation.\n\n7. At its 59th session, the IACHR decided to authorize the Executive Secretary and whatever staff members he might appoint to travel to Honduras and to Nicaragua in order to gather reports and update the information in the possession of the Commission.\n\n8. As a result of this decision, a lawyer from the Secretariat, Dr. Guillermo Fernández de Soto and a staff member Mrs. Dafne Murgia traveled to Honduras, and interviewed Honduran authorities and staff members of the UNHCR in Tegucigalpa; they also held several meetings with representatives of the refugee Miskito communities in Mocoron and other settlements in the Gracias a Dios Department. At these meetings, the refugees expressed their desire to remain permanently in Honduras and not to return to Nicaragua.\n\n9. On June 7, 1983, Dr. Edmundo Vargas Carreño, Executive Secretary of the Commission, and Dr. Christina Cerna traveled to Nicaragua and interviewed senior officials of the Government of National Reconstruction, including a member of the Government Junta, Dr. Rafael Córdoba Rivas; the President of the Supreme Court, Dr. Roberto Arguello Hurtado; the Minister of Foreign Relations, Miguel D’Escoto; the Minister Secretary General of North Atlantic Zone, Commander William Ramirez and the National Commissioner for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, Dr. Leonte Herdocia. They also held several meetings with the defense attorneys for the Miskitos, with the Representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Moravian clergymen, and representatives of other institutions such as the Permanent Commission on Human Rights of Nicaragua.\n\nThey also visited the penitentiaries where the Miskitos are detained, both in Managua and in Puerto Cabezas; they toured the towns of Slilma Lila and Yulu and two of the Tasba Pri settlements, on which occasions they obtained testimony from various Miskito inhabitants, with the assistance of the Moravian pastor, Fernando Colomer, who served as interpreter.\n\n10. At its 60th session, held in June of 1983, the Commission studied the status of the dispute in the light of the events that had taken place in recent months. In addition, it discussed who could be considered as a party to the dispute in addition to the Government of Nicaragua; and it evaluated the compliance of the Government of Nicaragua with the previous recommendations of the Commission.\n\n11. At is 61st session, held in September of 1983, the Commission received testimony from representatives of the Council of Elders, headed by Messrs. Mullins and Diego and also from the US anthropologist, Bernard considered that the partial compliance by the Government of Nicaragua with the previous recommendations set forth by the Commission were insufficient to establish an atmosphere of détente between the Government and a large part of the population of Miskito origin to reach the necessary friendly settlement. For that reason, the Commission decided to adopt this report in accordance with Article 50 of the American Convention on Human Rights. Nevertheless, the Commission wished to make one last effort with the Government of Nicaragua before concluding its participation as the mediator in a friendly settlement and for that purpose it submitted to the Government a concrete proposal aimed at obtaining a settlement.[10] Should the proposal not be accepted by the Government of Nicaragua within the deadline indicated by the Commission, it would proceed to terminate the friendly settlement procedure and publish this report, after meeting the requirements and time periods established in Articles 50 and 51 of the American Convention on Human Rights.\n\nM. The problem of determining the parties to the controversy\n\n1. In light of Article 48 1.f of the American Convention on Human Rights, one of the most important problems that arose in this matter has been to determine who should be considered the other party to the dispute in addition to the Government of Nicaragua. In this respect, it should be pointed out that there have been changes in the viewpoints of those who initially submitted a complaint to the Commission; furthermore, the problem at this time involves new aspects due to the position taken by the Government of Nicaragua. This has produced a situation that merits further analysis.\n\n2. On January 28 of 1982, the Commission received a “Charge of genocide by Sandinismo of the Indian of Misurasata�?, dated January 15 of 1982 and addressed to various other international organizations, unsigned and with no address, but with the stamp of the Coordinator General of Misurasata. Once it had been confirmed that the charge was that presented by the Coordinator General of Misurasata, Mr. Brooklyn Rivera, with whom the Commission had contact, the Commission transmitted the pertinent parts to the Government of Nicaragua on February 24 of 1982. Subsequently, by men of a written presentation dated April 8 of 1982, Brooklyn Rivera reiterated his earlier charge, explained the origins of the dispute of the Indian peoples of the Atlantic Coast with the Government of Nicaragua and proposed a negotiated solution that would give the Indians title to heir lands and autonomy within the State of Nicaragua.\n\n3. In February of 1982, Mr. Steadman Fagoth, Former representative of Misurasata on the Council of State, came to he Commission’s offices and gave an oral presentation on the events that took place in the surroundings of the Coco River late in 1981. Mr. Fagoth later submitted to the IACHR, at its 55th session, a written statement dated January 7 of 1982, in which he brought serious charges against the Government of Nicaragua.[11]\n\n4. Mr. Armstrong Wiggins, who has acted as coordinator of the regional leadership of Misurasata on the Atlantic Coast in 1980 and the early months of 1981, also came to the Commission’s offices in February, and gave background information on the events that took place on the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua. Mr. Wiggins subsequently came to the Commission when it was holding its 55th regular session, representing the Us Indian Law Resource Center, at which time he expressed the viewpoint of that institution with respect to the Nicaraguan Government’s behavior towards the Miskitos.[12] In addition, on May 19 of 1982, the Indian Law Resource Center formally requested the Commission to considerate a party to this matter.\n\n5. In the course of its 55th regular session, the Commission also received the testimony of Reverend Grahan J. Rights, representing the Moravian Church of the United States, and he requested that the Commission investigate the events that took place in late 1981 and early 1982 on the Government of Nicaragua and the Miskito Indians.\n\n6. The position of the original claimants changed as further events took place and evolved in Nicaragua.\n\n7. At this time, Misurasata is deeply divided between the faction headed by Steadman Fagoth and that directed by Brooklyn Rivera. To some extent, this division reflects the differences which exist at a broader political level among the groups that oppose the Sandinista Government. Thus, while Fagoth, in close coordination with the Nicaraguan Democratic Front (FDN), has taken up arms against the Government of Nicaragua, Brooklyn Rivera, in Costa Rica, has united with Alfonso Robelo, Fernando Chamorro and Eden Pastora in the Democratic Revolutionary Alliance (ARDE).\n\n8. According to the information available to the Commission, it is clear that a considerable number of the Miskitos who have taken refuge in Honduras give their unconditional support to Fagoth and consider him to be predestined to lead the Indian rebellion to topple the Sandinist regime. For that reason, the refugee Miskitos in Honduras consider Brooklyn Rivera and those who follow him as traitors who have encouraged “Divisionism in our national liberation movement, who prejudice and seek to destabilize our MISURASATA Organization which is made up and organized from within and without Nicaragua�?. The MISURASATA faction led by Brooklyn Rivera on the other hand, in addition to the support of the leaders in Costa Rica, appears to have greater international recognition, especially from Indian organizations such as the Indian Law Resource Center.\n\n9. With respect to this dispute, Misurasat (Costa Rica), led by Brooklyn Rivera, has been relatively cooperative with the Commission. Initially, Brooklyn Rivera suggested that the Commission assumes a mediating role; however, with the passage of time, this position has gradually been abandoned and at this time its position is that the Commission publish its Special Report on the situation of the Miskitos in Nicaragua. Thus, in a letter dated April 30 of 1983, Brooklyn Rivera stated the following to the Executive Secretary of the Commission:\n\nWe wonder when we will see some firm resolution on the part of the IACHR against the FSLN regime, concerning their continuous violations of the human rights of the Indians. It is clearly not just to continue to allow the commanders who use pretext and calumnies to freely continue to commit atrocities against the humble Indians. It is time that the IACHR publicly admit that the commanders are not interested in a friendly settlement with the Indians, and that it publish its report on the situation of the human rights of the Indians in Nicaragua.\n\n10. On the other hand, Misurasata (Honduras), which is now called Misura, and headed by Steadman Fagoth, has been harshly critical of the Commission, and has attributed base motives to it. Thus, in an interview that appeared in Diario Las Americas on October 20, 1982, Fagoth stated “The IACHR does not enjoy either the trust or the esteem of the Indian populace… and the IACHR the IACHR will try to find a ghost representative of the Indians to use in the mass communications media in order to divide the refugee populations, but we can confidently state that Indian unity is indestructible.�? Later, the Political Committee of Misura, through one of its spokesmen, stated to the Diario La Tribuna of Tegucigalpa, on May 4 of 1983, that: “We recognize no authority in the measures taken by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the OAS because it has conspired with the genocidal Sandinista Regime to force our people to return to Nicaragua and be completely exterminated.�?\n\n11. The position of the Indian Law Resource Center, stated by its most authoritative spokesman in this mater, Mr. Armstrong Wiggins, has been similar to that maintained by Misurasata (Costa Rica) headed by Mr. Brooklyn Rivera, i.e., in the course of the last few months they have been in close contact with the IACHR, and at present are urging it to abandon its mediating role and publish its report. Thus, Mr. Armstrong Wiggins, in his testimony to the Commission on April 12 of 1983, stated:\n\nWe believe that it is time for the Commission to declare that it will no longer continue to act as mediator. The Commission should openly declare that its efforts to promote a friendly settlement have not been successful, and the Commission should invite other institutions, including governments and human rights organizations, to investigate the situation of human rights in Indian territory in Nicaragua.\n\n12. The position of the Moravian Church, both in the United States and in Nicaragua, as stated through authorized spokesmen, continues to be that the Commission should continue to play a mediating role, despite the difficulties encountered. Thus, Mrs. Margaret Wilde, in her testimony to the IACHR on April 12 of 1983, reaffirmed the view of the Moravian Church of the United States that the role of the Commission as mediator has been very positive and that it should continue that role. During a visit to Nicaragua, the Executive Secretary and Dr. Cerna spoke at length with religious authorities of the Moravian Church, such as Bishop John Wilson, Reverend Fernando Colomer, and Pastor Santos Cleban, and were given the impression that they saw the Commission as an important instrument for promoting the observance of human rights, and for that reason it should not abandon its presence in Nicaragua and its relations with the Government.\n\n13. The viewpoint of the Government of Nicaragua is that Misurasata cannot be considered a party to this dispute, as it is an organization that has been disbanded and whose principal leaders are currently in exile, and who have taken up arms against the Government.\n\n14. As early as December of 1981, Mr. William Ramirez declared that the Government of Nicaragua was “obliged to withdraw official recognition of Misurasata both because its claims had reached the point of violating national sovereignty and because it had undergone an objective distancing from its bases.�?\n\n15. The Government of Nicaragua, in its proposal Document to the Commission of August 24, 1982, later responded to the recommendation of the IACHR that Misurasata or another Indian organization be allowed to operate in Nicaragua, in the following terms:\n\nThe Government of Nicaragua maintains a position of respect for international agreements signed with respect to human rights, for which reason it guarantees the right of assembly of Nicaraguans, obviously including Indian Nicaraguans. Within this framework, there is already an association of Sumos and organizational structures are being established for Criollos, Ladinos, Ramas and Miskitos. With respect to the return to Nicaragua of the leaders of the disbanded Misurasata organization, the Government of National Reconstruction states for the record that there is no persecution in Nicaragua of leaders for membership in any organization, and it assures all Nicaraguans residing abroad that they may return, with full guarantees.\n\n16. Nevertheless, the Government of Nicaragua later stated that it would not allow the leaders of Misurasata to return because of serious criminal charges pending against them. In a note of January 5, 1983, the Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Nicaragua to the OAS, gave the following reply to the Commission’s recommendation that it allow these leaders to return so that they could participate in the process of a friendly settlement:\n\nAn unacceptable element has been added, as the Government of Nicaragua is required to provide security and liberty to all those who attend such a meeting even when there are formal charges against some of them. This requirement by its very nature violates the juridical structure of the State and places the Executive Branch in the position of impeding, should it accept the requirement, the exercise of an autonomous stand independent judiciary.\n\n17. The same position was subsequently reiterated in a note dated November 14 of 1983, in which, in reply to the recommendation of the Commission to hold a Conference with the participation of representatives of the broadest possible sectors of the various communities of Miskito origin, the Government of Nicaragua expressly rejected “the presence of any representative of the Council of Elders, of Mr. Armstrong Wiggins and of the counterrevolutionary Misurasata Organization, guilty of numerous crimes against the people of Nicaragua an instruments of barbarous North American aggression.�?\n\n18. Thus, the Government of Nicaragua does not allow either of the factions that comprise Misurasata to be considered a party to this dispute: neither that headed by Brooklyn Rivera nor that led by Steadman Fagoth.\n\n19. Who then would be acceptable to the Government of Nicaragua to be a party to the dispute? With which representative sector of the Miskito population could the Government of Nicaragua have a dialogue to seek a settlement to their difficulties? The reply that the Government has given is that contained in the proposal document of August 24, 1982, according to which, once the Miskitos who are now in Honduras are repatriated, under the observance of the IACHR, “the Indian communities would democratically elect the delegates that would meet at the table in conversations with the delegates of the Government of Nicaragua to seek solutions.�?\n\n20. In the view of the Commission, at this time the proposal of the Nicaraguan Government cannot be implemented. As the IACHR or the staff members of its Secretariat have has opportunity to note on two occasions, at this time the condition do not obtain that would allow the refugee Miskitos in Honduras to return to Nicaragua, and thus participate in the election of the representatives who would negotiate with the government. On the other hand, even in the hypothetical case that such a return took place, those Miskitos would only represent part of the Miskito population, whose problems and difficulties, as will be seen throughout this report, go beyond the mere question of the return of the refugees to Nicaragua.\n\n21. In view of the above situation, there would be no institution or agency that could truly represent all of the Miskitos, within and outside Nicaragua, and act on their behalf with respect to the matters that concern them.\n\nUnder these circumstances, and taking into account the importance of reaching a friendly settlement that can meet the aspirations and interests of those concerned, the Commission considers that although the status of party in this matter cannot be strictly assumed by representatives of a single organization, it is possible to try to obtain the participation of Miskitos to represent their various communities.\n\n22. On this point, the Commission notes the following:\n\na. There is no organization in Nicaragua, which at this time represent all of the ethnic groups. The Commission has observed, however, that the religious groups that are active on the Atlantic Coast maintain close contact with the Miskito people of that region. Of these religious groups, clearly the most numerous and important is the Moravian Church, although the Catholic and Anglican Churches also maintain a small but relatively important presence in the region. Therefore, the Commission considers, first, that there is a possibility that the religious groups, especially the Moravian Church, could assume representation of the interests of the Miskitos.\n\nb. A second group whose interest should be represented in negotiations aimed at achieving a friendly settlement is that of the Miskitos who have been moved from their traditional villages and relocated in new settlements. Of these new settlements, those of Tasba Pri appear to be the largest, and according to information provided by the Government, they have already elected their own representative.\n\nc. The largest group of Nicaraguans of Miskito origin outside of Nicaragua is that which has taken refuge in various parts of the Gracias a Dios Department in Honduras. The most representative institution that these Miskitos have is apparently the Council of Elders.\n\nd. It is also necessary to bear in mind that a group of Miskito leaders who continue to claim representation of the Misurasata Organization are refugees in Costa Rica and have assumed an important role in this matter.\n\ne. Furthermore, the Commission cannot overlook the existence of the Indian Law Resource Center, Which formally requested to be considered a party to this dispute, and which through its representative, the Miskito Nicaraguan leader Armstrong Wiggins, has participated actively in this matter.\n\nThe Commission considers that the organizations, agencies and persons mentioned above could have acted as counterpart to the"
