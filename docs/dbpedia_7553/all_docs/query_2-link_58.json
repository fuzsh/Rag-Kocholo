        "text": "The USAID Community Action for Reading and Security (CARS) Activity, implemented by DevTech from 2013 to 2019, was designed to improve early-grade reading outcomes and community security in eight municipalities across Nicaragua’s Caribbean Coast.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016, the CARS Activity reached coastal communities in Nicaragua’s southern Caribbean region. In 2017, CARS extended its activities to the northern Caribbean region. Both the northern and southern regions are characterized by their linguistic diversity, with Spanish, English, Garifuna, Miskito, Ulwa, Creole, and Mayangna being spoken by different communities.\n\nAt the time of the project’s implementation, the region counted an insufficient supply of skilled teachers in preschools and primary schools as one of its many challenges in improving reading performance among young learners. Additionally, children and youth in the region faced inadequate access to preschool and non-formal alternative education opportunities. For example, according to 2014 EMNV data, 70.1 percent of three to five years old in Nicaragua’s Caribbean Coast did not have access to a preschool—a figure that is 12.5 percentage points higher than the national average. The region also experienced significant security challenges in comparison to national averages, including high homicide and sexual crime rates (National Police Yearbook, 2018).\n\nThe Menorca School in Bluefields is located in a very high-risk zone for children. Within this adverse context, the Menorca EpC became a lighthouse for vulnerable children. According to Estela Rigby, the EpC facilitator in charge, “thanks to CARS, five of the kids who are attending this EpC have become good students in their morning public school class.”\n\nAudring Alisha Dayson Humpyes, a seven-year old girl who was in first grade in the Menorca School, was one of this EpCs success stories. “Before CARS, this girl did not know how to read or write; thanks to CARS the kids who belong to this EpC have overcome their initial shortcomings when they first began EpC classes,” explained the EpC facilitator Ms. Rigby. Audring took full advantage of opportunities made available by the CARS program. As per Ms. Rigby: “She really fell in love with the school, and now is an excellent student in her section because she significantly improved her reading and writing skills.”\n\nWhen contemplating the reasons for the success of the EpC program, Ms. Rigby noted that in addition to providing a space for learning, the EpCs work because attending children also find love, tenderness, and affection at the centers."
