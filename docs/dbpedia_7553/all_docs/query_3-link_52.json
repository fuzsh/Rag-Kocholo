        "text": "LinguaTrans is a translation agency that provides language services in Nicaragua for public and private clients of all kinds: from private individuals who need a sworn translation to large projects for renowned companies and institutions. Below, we tell you a little bit about this country and why it is so important to us.\n\nNicaragua is a country in Central America, known for its natural beauty and rich culture. The official language is Spanish, though other indigenous languages are also spoken in some regions.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION\n\nTranslation is an important skill in Nicaragua, especially given the diversity of languages spoken in the country. Translators are essential for effective communication between people who speak different languages, and can work in a variety of fields, such as business, tourism, law and medicine, among others.\n\nIn Nicaragua, translation is also important in the field of literature. Many Nicaraguan writers have been translated into different languages, which has allowed them to reach international audiences. For example, Rubén Darío, one of Nicaragua’s greatest poets, has been translated into several languages, including English, French and German.\n\nAdeFurthermore, translation is essential for the promotion of tourism in Nicaragua. As a tourist destination, it is important that information on tourist attractions, services and cultural norms is available in several languages to attract visitors from all over the world. Translators can also help companies establish contacts with international customers and suppliers.\n\nEXTRA INFORMATION\n\nInterestingly, Nicaragua is the largest Central American republic of all, situated between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. It also borders Honduras and Costa Rica.\n\nIt has a population of about 7 million, and its capital is Managua. The official language is Spanish, but a variant of English is spoken on the Atlantic Coast, as well as indigenous languages such as Misquito, Sumo and Rama.\n\nThe currency used is the Córdoba (C$), named after the conquistador Francisco Hernández de Córdoba. On the other hand, Catholicism is the predominant religion in Nicaragua."
