        "text": "PRONUNCIATION: SOO-moo and MISS-key-toe\n\nLOCATION: Nicaragua; Honduras (Eastern coasts)\n\nPOPULATION: 215,000\n\nLANGUAGE: Sumu; Spanish\n\nRELIGION: Protestantism (Moravian Church); Catholicism\n\n2 • LOCATION\n\nThe Sumu live in isolated inland villages along the main rivers of what is known as the Atlantic or Miskito Coast, located in Nicaragua and Honduras. (Many of the areas they occupy can be reached only by water.) While the Miskito Coast is extremely diverse geographically, most Sumu live in the tropical rain forest.\n\nThere are three main subgroups among the Sumu. Each speaks its own variant of a common language. During the prolonged warfare of the 1980s, the Sumu suffered persecution at the hands of both the government and the Miskitos. A great number of their settlements were destroyed. Many Sumu fled to refugee camps in Honduras, but most have been repatriated (returned to their homeland) in the years since 1985. Those who have returned are attempting to rebuild their shattered communities. Altogether, there are thought to be about 150,000 Mikito in Nicaragua and 50,000 in Honduras; and about 14,000 Sumu in Nicaragua and 1,000 in Honduras.\n\n3 • LANGUAGE\n\nBoth the Sumu and Miskito languages are derived from the Chibchan Indian language family of South America. Outside influences have caused both groups to borrow words from the other's language, as well as from English and Spanish. Most Sumu and Miskito are multilingual, speaking Spanish in school and their native language at home. In addition, many learn to speak the other native language (either Sumu or Miskito). Few Sumu or Miskito know how to write in their own language.\n\n6 • MAJOR HOLIDAYS\n\nThe major holidays of the Christian calendar are celebrated, including Christmas (December 25) and Easter (late March or early April). They are combined with the traditional practices of singing, dancing, and drinking.\n\n7 • RITES OF PASSAGE\n\nFestivities mark major events in the life-cycle, such as weddings and funerals. Both the Sumu and Miskito mark major life events—births, marriages, deaths—with Christian ceremonies.\n\n8 • RELATIONSHIPS\n\nThe Sumu family traditionally functioned as an independent, self-sufficient economic unit. Men cut down trees and hunted, while women performed agricultural work and household chores. Today, both men and women participate in the cash economies (employment for wages) of the countries in which they live.\n\nAmong the Miskito, it is common for villagers to magnify personal quarrels into major feuds between communities.\n\n9 • LIVING CONDITIONS\n\nBoth Sumu and Miskito dwellings are typically wooden, split-bamboo, or post-and-pole structures. Roofs are thatched or corrugated tin, and floors are made of board, split bamboo, or palm branches. They mostly consist of one room—although some have interior divisions—and generally have windows and doors. Instead of having a foundation, houses are usually raised several feet or meters off the ground on posts.\n\nTraditional herbal remedies are used in conjunction with Western-style medicine. Herbal remedies using roots, leaves, bark, and seeds are still used for a variety of purposes, including the treatment of poisonous snake bites. However, modern medicine is beginning to replace traditional folk remedies for many illnesses.\n\n10 • FAMILY LIFE\n\nMost Sumu and Miskito live in extended families with two or three generations under one roof. Sumu men formerly had more than one wife, but today monogamy (having only one spouse) is the rule. Courtship customs include the giving of gifts by the man to the young woman's parents. These may include food and firewood. Once married, the couple generally lives with either the wife's or the husband's parents until their own house is built. At one time, marriage with outsiders was strictly forbidden. Today it is common for the Sumu and Miskito to marry blacks, mestizos (mixed-race peoples), or members of other native groups—even their traditional enemies. In addition to their domestic responsibilities, women take part in farm work, including planting, weeding, and harvesting.\n\n11 • CLOTHING\n\nFormerly, Sumu and Miskito women made loincloths and skirts from pounded tree bark or locally woven cotton. Other clothing was made from cotton that was spun, dyed, and woven by hand. Today, however, like other inhabitants of Nicaragua and Honduras, Sumu and Miskito wear mass-produced Western-style clothing, mostly lightweight cotton.\n\n13 • EDUCATION\n\nHonduras and Nicaragua, where most Sumu and Miskito live, both have free, required primary education. However, the educational systems of both countries are inadequate, with low enrollment and graduation rates. Consequently, adult illiteracy (inability to read and write) is high. Estimates of the adult illiteracy rate are as high as 80 percent in rural areas, where most Sumu and Miskito live. Schools are understaffed and undersupplied, with as many as eighty students per classroom. In the 1980s, the Nicaraguan government instituted the first bilingual education programs for native people, taught in the Miskito language.\n\n14 • CULTURAL HERITAGE\n\nMany of the traditional Sumu flute melodies imitate bird calls. Accompaniment is provided by rattles and drums.\n\n16 • SPORTS\n\nBaseball, soccer, basketball, and volleyball are popular in Nicaragua and Honduras. Cockfighting is a favorite spectator sport among the Sumu and other groups living along the Miskito Coast."
