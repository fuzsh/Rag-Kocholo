Mohéli Information

History of Mohéli National Park

On April 19, 2001, the first protected area in the country was established, known as the Mohéli Marine Park. This achievement resulted from a unique process in which local communities from the ten villages located on the park’s boundaries negotiated a collaboration agreement with the government for its establishment and management. The marine park program was recognized as one of the 27 finalists selected from nearly 500 nominations by the Equator Initiative. This initiative is a partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), IUCN, the United Nations Foundation, and four other international groups, with the aim of promoting community initiatives that foster sustainable development.

In 2010, the marine park was upgraded and declared as Mohéli National Park, and in 2015, it was expanded to include approximately three-quarters of the island’s land area. This expansion was a significant step for the conservation of Mohéli’s natural resources and the protection of its biodiversity. Its creation marked a milestone in the island’s biodiversity conservation and the development of sustainable ecotourism in the region, becoming the first national park in the Comoros. The park covers an area of 404 km2, and the Mohéli region had a population of 41,428 registered inhabitants in 2022. The majority of the island’s inhabitants are Sunni Muslims.

Mohéli consists of 9 uninhabited islets and 10 coastal villages. Also, within the park’s protected area is Lake Dziani Boudouni, recognized on February 9, 1995, as a Ramsar Site of International Importance, the only one in the country with this designation.

Visitor’s Guide

Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit Mohéli National Park is during the dry season, from May to October, when the weather conditions are ideal for exploring the park and engaging in outdoor activities.

Accommodation

In the vicinity of Mohéli National Park, visitors will find a variety of accommodation options, ranging from cozy guesthouses to luxurious resorts. One recommended place is Vanilla Lodge in Niamchoua, which offers warm hospitality and clean rooms for guests. Although some of the community bungalows are still in operation, such as in Itsamia, many of them remain closed or have been damaged due to the cyclone that occurred in 2019. It is advisable to check before arrival and make reservations in advance before heading to the park.

Dining in Mohéli

Visitors can also indulge in the exquisite local cuisine, rich in fish, seafood, and tropical fruits. However, due to various transportation issues, the product offerings in Mohéli’s supermarkets are limited. Additionally, finding fruits out of the local season can be challenging, as most products available in the markets come directly from local fields. Nevertheless, do not be discouraged by the scarcity of variety and take the opportunity to enjoy fresh and high-quality products sourced directly from the land. There are very few restaurants available in Mohéli.

Camping on the Islets of Mohéli National Park

From Nioumachoua, you can request a fisherman to transport you by boat to any of the park’s islets. Spend the night surrounded by the purest nature and enjoy a unique camping experience. For more exciting activities, we recommend visiting the website of Mohéli’s Ecotourism House. There, you will find additional information about other thrilling options to explore this magnificent natural park.

Rules and Regulations

It is essential for visitors to follow the park’s rules and regulations to ensure the protection of its ecosystem. This includes respecting wildlife and flora and adhering to designated hiking trails.

Visitors should be prepared for the terrain and climate conditions, and it is recommended to bring enough water, sunscreen, and insect repellent. It is also advisable to hire local guides to ensure a safe and rewarding visit.

How to Get There

By Plane

Mohéli Bandar Es Eslam Airport in Fomboni has daily flights from the other islands of the archipelago. You can purchase tickets at tourism agencies, and the approximate price for a one-way flight is 50€.

By Boat

There are options to travel by boat to and from Grande Comore (Moroni/Chindini) or Anjouan (Mutsamudu). You can choose between speedboats or cargo ships.

Speedboats

From Grande Comore, boats depart from Chindini, located approximately an hour away by shared taxi from Moroni (you can take it at the Karthala stop in Moroni at 7 a.m.). Make sure to register your passport as a foreigner. Some police officers may try to request a bribe for this fee, but you can seek help from locals to avoid this situation. Boats usually depart around 09:00, and the crossing costs around 10,500 francs. Be prepared to get wet during the trip, which can take about an hour in calm waters and several hours in turbulent waters. It is advisable to wear a life jacket and find a spot on the boat with less cargo and fewer people for safety. The boats will drop you off at a beach between Hoani and Fomboni. It is advisable to arrange transportation in advance as it can be challenging to find taxis upon arrival. If you don’t have transportation, look for a taxi driver and negotiate the price. A trip to Nioumachoua should cost around 10 euros or 5000 KMF. Also, keep in mind that boats do not operate every day in bad weather, so you should be prepared to spend an additional day in Moroni/Mwali.

Cargo Ships

There are also weekly cargo ships traveling to Moroni and Mutsamudu. The schedule is not fixed, so you should check at the port to know when the next ship will depart. These ships are slower and take the whole night to reach Moroni or Mutsamudu. Note that there are no available beds, so passengers spend the night sleeping in chairs. The prices are similar to those of speedboats, but no police permit is required. It is always recommended to see the ship before buying the ticket.

To get around the island, you can use local buses, which are called taxis by the locals. These buses connect Fomboni with most destinations on the island. The bus stop in Fomboni is located at the market, but you should be aware that the buses stop operating before noon. After that time, you can choose to take a shared taxi.

It’s essential to note that taxis or buses departing from places other than Fomboni are limited. Usually, you’ll find only a couple of taxis in each town. They usually depart every day at 5:00 a.m. towards Fomboni, so it is advisable to reserve a seat the day before. However, keep in mind that Mondays can be extremely difficult to get to Fomboni as many teachers and students travel to the city for school. Therefore, advance planning is essential, and you may have to wait for a few hours.

Until November 2018, there was a shortage of fuel on the island, which complicated internal travel. Hitchhiking is possible and very safe in Mohéli, although not as easy as in Grande Comore due to the lack of cars. Keep in mind that the road between Itsamia and Niamchoua was destroyed by the cyclone of 2019, so the trip that used to take 15 minutes can now take up to 3 hours as you will have to go all around the island.
