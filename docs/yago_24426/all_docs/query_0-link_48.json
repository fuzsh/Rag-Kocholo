(We’re now left to find out whatever happened to the black and yellow flag with white crescent and star, and to the yellow flag with red star.) The colour yellow is still “Mwali’s color”, as reflected by the four stripes of the national flag.\n\nAntónio Martins, 26 Mar 2006\n\nThe actual local flag now of Moheli in the Comoros under the new Union constitution is the same yellow-red flag used during the brief secessionist period.\n\nBen Cahoon, 01 Mar 2006\n\nOddly enough, it seems that the bicolor flag, once used by separatists, has become a sign of official allegiance to the central power, so that separatists have moved to the starry flag to express their claims.\n\nIvan Sache, 18 Sep 2010\n\nNot unlike, say, Puerto Rico (cp. current and former separatists).\n\nAntónio Martins, 18 Sep 2010\n\nYellow flag with red star\n\nimage by Eric Milan and António Martins, 15 May 2004\n\nI am just coming back from Moheli island, and I can tell you that the yellow and black flag displayed on many websites is false: I can swear that the flag was yellow with red star.\n\nEric Milan, 04 Dec 2003\n\nThere is no Moheli flag anywhere on public buildings in Moheli; I found only 3 flags on the whole island:\n\nHand drawn flag in the office of the MAMWE (Electricity and Water Company) Director\n\nHand sewn (incorrect) flag in the same place (star with 4 branches instead of 5)\n\nHand sewn flag posted on the front of the President Fazul official car (But I was prevented to take photos due to the fear of the mercenaries)\n\nEric Milan, 04 Dec 2003\n\nFour point variant\n\nimage by Eric Milan and António Martins, 15 May 2004\n\nHand sewn (incorrect) flag in the office of the MAMWE (Electricity and Water Company) Director (star with 4 branches instead of 5). I saw it at the director’s desk, a hand made flag of Moheli. But he admitted that his wife forgot a branch of the star when sewing this flag.\n\nEric Milan, 04 Dec 2003\n\nIt seems that after all the official version of Mwali’s red star has in fact 4 points. In the KweliMag website we see a photo of the new president of the island wearing the presidential sash (yellow with a 4-pointed red star). I find it hard to believe that the star on the sash can be different from the one used on the island flag!\n\nParaskevas Renesis, 08 Jul 2007\n\nIt shows the newly elected president (July 2007) Mohamed Ali Said wrapped in four-pointed flag.\n\nChrystian Kretowicz, 28 Mar 2008\n\nYellow flag with white crescent and black stripe\n\nimage by Horváth Zoltán, 15 Jan 2011\n\nI came across with an interesting page about Mohéli/Mwali. This is website of Mwali International Services Authority (MISA), which is frequently updated (latest news put in January of 2010). It says that black-yellow flag with crescent and star has been adopted in 2002, stating that this is current flag of Mwali. Flag depicting on this page is slightly different than previously reported. Black stripe is narrow, and horn of crescent is short. The crescent and star emblem is small and slightly placed near to fly.\n\nHorváth Zoltán, 15 Jan 2011\n\nThere is an official photo of 2002-2007 island President Fazul with the (new) national flag and a dark yellow flag with white crescent and star facing the hoist (the flag draped in such a way that a black hoist stripe would not be visible). This flag is still the one shown as the Moheli flag in several versions of Wikipedia: English and French (which it is not an authoritative source, as the official government webpage, but surely Comorian Wikipedia visitors would change the image or at least warn the editors about it…?)\n\nAntónio Martins, 24 Feb 2008\n\nAccording my references, the flag is vertical dark and yellow (dark about 1/4 of the flag) probably black and yellow. Some info appear in Flag Report 36 [frp].\n\nJaume Ollé, 06 Aug 2003\n\nApparently, the island constitution of Mwali (Moheli) says nothing about flags; no “drapeau” nor “emblème” in this page.\n\nAntónio Martins, 02 Apr 2003\n\nSeparatist flag (11-28 August 1997)\n\nimage by Ivan Sache, 13 Oct 1997 and 10 Oct 2002\n\nIt seems that the self-proclaimed Democratic Republic of Mwali lasted only from 11 to 28 August 1997.\n\nIvan Sache, 20 Apr 2002\n\nCountry: Moheli Island, Archipelago of Comoros\n\nStatus: Self-proclamated independent state (unrecognized)\n\nDate: 1997.08.11-?\n\nUsage: Unofficial “national” flag\n\nRatio: 3:2\n\nSource: Franciae Vexilla 6/52 (1997.09) [frv]\n\nAccuracy: High\n\nIvan Sache, 13 Oct 1997\n\nOn 6 August, NANDO Times reported that «The separatists in Fomboni, the main town on Moheli, hoisted the yellow-and-black flag of Queen Fatima Djoumbe, the last ruler of Moheli before colonization by France.» As usual, no design details are offered. (Source: “Separatists on Comoran island Moheli follow lead of Anjouan”, NANDO Times, Global Briefs, 6 August 1997)\n\nJan Oskar Engene, 06 Aug 1997\n\nThe flag used by Fatima Djumbe is shown by Calvarin [clv02]: it was yellow and red, not yellow and black.\n\nIvan Sache, 20 Apr 2002\n\nOther flags in Moheli\n\nGrande Comore\n\nThe flag of Grande Comore can be seen on all official buildings in Moheli, because the island is also the head of the union and there is a conflict between the island and the union governments.\n\nEric Milan, 04 Dec 2003\n\nFrance\n\nThe French flag was attempted raised for the French national day 14 June. (Source: “Barrages et drapeaux français à Moheli”, Le Journal de L’Île, 6 August 1997)\n\nJan Oskar Engene, 06 Aug 1997\n\nReporting riots against the central power that broke out in Mohéli in May 2010, AFP, 27 May 2010, states:\n\nA few home-made French flags have been hoisted on electricity poles, together with the Moheli flag, yellow with a red star.\n\nIvan Sache, 18 Sep 2010"
