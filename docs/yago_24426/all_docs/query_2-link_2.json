        "text": "The grandeur of the Comoros’ natural attractions is enough to make you want to stay for a few days. Its shores are laden with fine sand and fringed by palm trees, typical of an untouched beach paradise with unrivaled opportunities to see diverse sea life. Inland are quaint towns and cultural discoveries, plus beautiful mountains, lakes and vegetation that unfold each step of the way. From stunning rock formations shaped and reshaped by the volcanic Mount Karthala to the diving bays, laid back villages, and the distinct Arabian glamor of Moroni, the Comoros will never run out of pleasant surprises.\n\nMount Karthala\n\nMount Karthala is the most notable feature of Grande Comore not only for its “largest in the world” title, but because of its undeniable beauty. Its latest eruption may have flattened villages into a sea of ashes, but it also created spectacular landscapes on the mountain. During calmer days, the volcano giant is a popular hiking, walking and trekking spot. While the ascent can be challenging, the views from the top are unmatched with flora and fauna unique to Comoros. Address: Grand Comore, Comoros Phone: n/a Website: n/a\n\nGrande Comore\n\nThe largest of the islands, Grande Comore is also home to the nation’s capital, Moroni, which exudes an intoxicating Arabian charm. Best known for the Vendredi Mosque and excellent beaches, the island is also home to Mount Karthala and Comoros’ second reserve, Coelacanth Marine Park. Divers will find Trou du Prophéte in the Misamiouli area particularly spellbinding. Address: Grande Comore, Comoros Phone: n/a Website: n/a\n\nDziani Boundouni\n\nAnother must-see attraction, Dziani Boundouni is a beautiful sulfur crater lake situated right in the heart of the island of Mohéli. It is a pleasurable walk from the capital town of Fomboni, which is also known for its beautiful beaches. Address: Mohéli Island, Comoros Phone: n/a Website: n/a\n\nMohéli Island\n\nMohéli is the smallest of the four main islands in the Comoros archipelago. It offers an interesting array of attractions, including the crater lake and the quaint fishing village of Fomboni. The locals have preserved a tradition of hand-built sailboats, and outsiders can freely observe Arab ships being constructed right on the shore. Mohéli Marine Park is located just off the island’s southern coast, and is best known for its population of green turtles and spectacular coral reefs. Niumashuwa Bay is a fine diving spot and a good starting point for visiting the marine park.

The island’s capital is known for it’s unique-17th century feel, with old houses lining the twisting alleyways. In the center is the old citadel and some mosques. A short drive away are stunning beaches and breathtaking waterfalls, enhanced by abundant vegetation. Anjouan is also home to multiple perfume distilleries found in the town of Bambao. Address: Anjouan Island, Comoros Phone: n/a Website: n/a\n\nMayotte\n\nIf you have time to spare, the stunning French Mayotte Island is also worth a visit for more beaches and good diving facilities. Mayotte is also home to what is supposedly the largest lagoon in the world, which may be explored via a dugout canoe. The gem of the island is the Sulu waterfall, which drops straight into the sea.
