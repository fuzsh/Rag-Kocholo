        "text": "Traveling around\n\nTaxis run from Fomboni to most destinations on the island several times per day, if not more. They usually stop running between 15:00 and 18:00 hours; the farther the destination, the earlier the taxi stops. The only place with serious taxi problems is Nioumachoua. Nioumachoua only had two taxis as of the beginning of 2007, and one or both frequently broke down. In addition, many teachers and students commute to Fomboni for school, so trying to get to Fomboni on Mondays is extremely difficult. In other words, planning ahead is essential and waiting for hours is expected. From Fomboni, you can catch the taxi to Nioumachoua from the market. From Nioumachoua, you wait along the main street.\n\nHitchhiking is possible on Moheli, though not nearly as easy as on Grand Comore."
