        "text": "Under the 2001 constitution, the president was directly elected for a single five-year term, with eligibility rotating among the main islands of Grande Comore (Ngazidja), Anjouan, and Mohéli. However, a new constitution approved in 2018 allows the president to run for two consecutive five-year terms and abolished the system of rotating power among the islands.\n\nThe 2018 constitution allowed President Azali Assoumani of the Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros (CRC) party to contest and win the 2019 presidential election, which was boycotted by the opposition. Observers, including from the African Union (AU), said the contest was marred by irregularities, and 12 opposition candidates rejected the results.\n\nIn 2023, political parties prepared for a January 2024 presidential election, and some opposition parties announced that they would boycott the election.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), while historically able to run credible elections, has faced more recent accusations of bias and corruption. Ahead of the January 2024 presidential election, the opposition demanded that the CENI be reconstituted in order to ensure that it would be independent and that the electoral process would not be influenced by the country’s armed forces.\n\nOpposition groups boycotted the 2018 constitutional referendum, denounced it as an unconstitutional power grab by Azali, and said Azali’s dismissal of the Constitutional Court ahead of the vote rendered it illegal. There were also allegations of voter intimidation and fraud. Among other things, the 2018 constitution allows the president to run for two consecutive terms and transfers the competencies of the Constitutional Court, which was considered impartial in deciding electoral matters, to a new Supreme Court chamber.\n\nPolitical parties are mainly formed around specific leaders and draw on island or ethnic bases of support. In the past, parties generally operated freely, though the government occasionally disrupted opposition parties’ activities by denying them meeting and assembly space.\n\nThe authorities systematically cracked down on opposition figures who publicly criticized the 2018 constitutional referendum. The former governor of Anjouan, Abdou Salami Abdou, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022 for allegedly participating in an insurrection, among other charges. Observers have called the former governor a political prisoner. Presidential candidates Achmet Said Mohamed and Soilihi Mohamed were briefly detained in 2019. Soilihi, who led a National Transitional Council (CNT) that unsuccessfully attempted to force Azali from office through civil disobedience and industrial action, agreed to refrain from further involvement after his release.\n\nAhead of the January 2024 presidential election some opposition leaders were arrested after publicly praying for political prisoners.\n\nIn the past, numerous opposition parties had a realistic chance of gaining power through elections, though they were impeded by occasional government interference, and allegations of misuse of state resources by incumbents were not uncommon. However, the arrests, convictions, and harsh sentencing of opposition leaders who spoke out against the 2018 constitutional referendum hampered the ability of opposition parties to compete in elections. The 2020 legislative elections were boycotted by the opposition and ended with progovernment candidates winning every seat.\n\nWhile individuals are generally free to exercise their political choices, the influence of Comoros’s army and religious authorities can place pressure on voters and candidates. The army cracked down on dissent during the 2018 constitutional referendum, and was also used to intimidate and detain opposition figures during and after the 2019 presidential campaign.\n\nThere are reports of corruption at all levels, including within the judiciary, civil service, and security forces. The Azali administration dissolved the National Commission for Preventing and Fighting Corruption in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, former president Ahmed Abdallah Sambi was arrested for corruption, embezzlement, and forgery in connection with a passport-sales scheme that reportedly cost Comoros as much as $971 million. Sambi was convicted of “high treason” for his role in the scheme and sentenced to life in prison in 2022.\n\nThe constitution and laws provide for freedom of speech and of the press. However, some pressures, including the use of censorship laws to prosecute legitimate journalistic work, have prompted widespread self-censorship. Journalists continue to face harassment and intimidation, including from government officials, and arrests of journalists and bloggers are common.\n\nJournalistic activity remained restricted throughout 2023. During the year, Comoran authorities arrested four journalists who reported on alleged sexual harassment within the Comoros Radio and Television Office (ORTC). The journalists were charged with “defamation and insult,” convicted, and given a suspended sentence of nine months.\n\nSome 98 percent of the population is Sunni Muslim. Sunni Islam was made the state religion in 2018. Previously, the state religion had been “Islam,” and some observers suggested the change reflected Azali’s efforts to bring Comoros closer to Saudi Arabia and to counter the influence of former president Sambi, who was seen as close to Iran.\n\nAnti-Shia sentiments have been publicly expressed by some government figures, while many Christians keep their faith private to avoid harassment. Proselytizing and public religious ceremonies are prohibited for all religions except Sunni Islam.\n\nThe judicial system is based on both Sharia (Islamic law) and the French legal code. Though the law establishes mechanisms for the selection of judges and attorneys, the executive often disregards these and simply appoints people to their positions. Court decisions are not always upheld.\n\nThe 2018 referendum abolished the Constitutional Court and established a new constitutional chamber of the Supreme Court. This chamber ruled in favor of the government during the 2019 election period by barring several candidates from running and by validating the electoral results, despite widespread concerns over voting irregularities.\n\nAll defendants have the right to a fair public trial, but they often face lengthy delays. Due-process rights are affected by corruption.\n\nPolitical figures, including candidates, have been denied due process. Former president Sambi’s legal pretrial detention period ended in 2019, but he remained under house arrest until his trial in 2022. Sambi refused to attend the trial after the first day, calling the proceedings “illegitimate.” Some observers have called Sambi a political prisoner. Though Sambi was initially charged with corruption, at his trial, he was sentenced to life in prison for the crime of “high treason”—a crime his lawyers claim does not exist in Comoran law.\n\nIn 2020, Inssa “Bobocha” Mohamed was arrested for allegedly attacking President Azali in an unsuccessful bombing the previous month. Bobocha remained in pretrial detention until escaping from prison that November; he was returned to custody in 2021. He was allegedly held as a “secret prisoner” before his 2022 trial, after which he was sentenced to eight years in prison for “criminal association and conspiracy.”\n\nThe law provides for equality of persons. However, same-sex sexual activity is illegal, with punishments of a fine and up to five years’ imprisonment. Few women hold positions of responsibility in business outside of elite families. Laws requiring that services be provided for people with disabilities are not well enforced.\n\nIn accordance with civil and some customary laws, women have equal rights in inheritance matters. Local cultures on Grande Comore and Mohéli are matrilineal, with women legally possessing all inheritable property. However, this is complicated by the concurrent application of Sharia, interpretations of which can limit gender equality. In addition, a poor land-registration system and women’s difficulties in securing loans hampers their right to own land.\n\nEndemic corruption and a lack of transparency hampers normal business activity."
