        "text": "Day 1: Arrival Moroni (Grande Comore)\n\nArrive in Moroni, capital of the Comoros Islands and transfer to your accommodation. The rest of the afternoon is at leisure for you to relax or start exploring the area on your own. No guided arrangements nor meals are included today. Overnight Retaj Moroni Hotel, or similar.\n\nNote: The Retaj Moroni Hotel does not serve alcohol.\n\nMoroni\n\nThe sleepy capital Moroni is a delightful little town perched on the edge of the Indian Ocean and often surrounded by fishing boats in its harbour. The old quarter of the town is a maze of narrow streets that are fantastic to explore, and many buildings still have the traditional carved doors, reminiscent of those that can be found on Zanzibar. Moroni’s main feature is its ancient Friday Mosque, while its market is a great place to wander around to observe scenes of daily life. Once an important trading town on the Indian Ocean, Moroni has slipped quietly into a forgotten existence where tourists are rare and visitors are treated as a curious novelty. The views out to sea as the sunsets, over tiny ships heading out for an evening’s fishing, are unforgettable.\n\nDay 2: Moroni - Full Day exploration of the northern part of Grande Comore\n\nAfter breakfast embark on a full-day tour of Grande Comore with private car, driver and English-speaking guide. We drive across the island from the foothills of the Mount Karthala, an impressive active volcano, to the high plateau of Diboini to view other extinct craters. We then proceed to the agricultural cooperative in Mbeni where you can see another ylang ylang distillery and a vanilla pods warehouse.\n\nIn this pedagogic cooperative, it is also possible to encounter lemurs and tortoises as well as the odd and legendary cœlacanthe fish. Later, we drive to the famous rock formation shaped as a Dragon and we stop by the enchanting Salt Lake, which water colour may vary from white to blue turquoise. On our way back to Moroni we stop at the beautiful white sand beaches of Galawa and Chomoni where you can enjoy a swim in the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean if you wish to. Overnight at Retaj Hotel, or similar. (BL)\n\nGrande Comore\n\nOfficially known as Ngazidja, Grande Comore is the largest of the Comoros Islands but has no rivers or waterways at all – all water is gathered via wells or as rainwater. Prior to the arrival of the French, it was divided up into several sultanates. Grande Comore is dominated by Mt Karthala, which at 2361m is the largest active volcano in the world. The island has around 315,000 inhabitants, most of whom are of Arab or African descent.\n\nDay 3: Moroni - Anjouan (Domestic flight) – Mutsamudu City tour\n\nTransfer to the airport for the short flight to Anjouan, widely accepted as the most beautiful of the islands which make up the Union of the Comoros. On arrival, you will be taken for a city tour around the charming capital Mutsamudu with its historical citadel and the Medina. Overnight at Al Amal Hotel, or similar. (B)\n\nNote: Accommodation in Mutsamudu, is limited. Al Amal Hotel is known as the best available hotel in Anjouan, although rooms are very basic and service can be slow at times. Wi-Fi connection is available from the restaurant but we cannot guarantee that it will be working.\n\nAnjouan\n\nAnjouan seems to sit uncomfortably within the Comoros nation. In 1997 it declared itself an independent nation, and then asked to be re-integrated into France, but following French refusal re-joined the Comoros in 2002. Not entirely happy with this though, it announced once more its independence in 2007, prompting military action from the Comoros, although it now has a semi-autonomous status. Anjouan is a pretty little island which is the world’s principal exporter of ylang-ylang oil, an ingredient found in most perfumes. The island is heavily forested with beautiful beaches and small villages dotted here and there, and like Grande Comore its centre culminates in the peak the 1600m Mt Ntingui.\n\nDay 4: Full day guided tour around Anjouan\n\nAfter breakfast, we depart for a full day tour of Anjouan. We first drive through the col de Patsy which offers spectacular views of the island and we continue to the ylang ylang distillery of Bambao. After a short stop we proceed to the Tatringa falls where you can observe the former building once used by the French manufacturers to distillate the flowers used to prepare the world-renowned perfume Chanel No 5. Continue to the interesting town of Domoni to discover the historical mausoleum of former president Abdallah and stop for a picnic lunch along the ocean. In the afternoon we drive through the farmer lands of Nyumakele before returning to the hotel. Overnight at Al Amal Hotel, or similar. (BL)\n\nDay 5: Anjouan - Mohéli (Domestic flight)\n\nMorning transfer to the airport for the flight to Mohéli. On arrival you will be met by a local guide and transferred to the Laka Lodge, a small and intimate resort with its own beach. There are a number of other optional excursions available including trips to some of the smaller islands nearby, and evening visits to watch turtles lay their eggs in the sand. Overnight at Laka Lodge, or similar. (BLD)\n\nMohéli\n\nMohéli is the smallest of the four islands of the Comoros archipelago, and is the wildest and least populated island of the Union, but also the most scenic and well-preserved, the true ‘Pearl of the Comoros’.\n\nNature lovers will like it here – its flora is rich and includes different species of orchids and endemic palms, while animal life includes turtles, the Livingstone fruit bat (the largest bat in the world), whales, dolphins and dugongs. Beaches are pretty and plentiful, especially on the south coast, and you will have long stretches just for yourself. All in all a true island paradise.\n\nDays 6 and 7: Mohéli at leisure\n\nTwo full days at leisure to enjoy this beautiful island. We have not pre-arranged any sightseeing or activities as Mohéli is very easy to explore independently or optional excursions can be arranged directly with the lodge. Relax and enjoy the different pace of life and meet the friendly local people. If you are feeling a little more energetic, you can arrange a guided hike across the island on tracks of virgin rainforest. Alternatively, you can cycle around the island, on virtually empty roads. Then of course there are the beaches. Two of the most beautiful are Sambadjou and Nioumachoua. You can also snorkel to discover the rich marine life or even go whale and dolphin watching. Finally, at certain times of the year you may be lucky enough to see giant turtles lay their eggs at night on Itsamia beaches. Overnights at Laka Lodge, or similar. (BLD)\n\nDay 8: Mohéli – Moroni (Domestic flight) – Moroni City tour\n\nAfter a leisurely breakfast, transfer to the local airport for your flight back to Moroni. On arrival, take a short city tour and visit the Medina with its famous narrow streets and colorful material shops. Then, transfer to the hotel. Tonight, you will be staying in a nice hotel located just further north of the capital and there will be leisure time to relax and unwind on the white-sand beach. Overnight at Golden Tulip Resort & Spa, or similar. (B)\n\nDay 9: Day at leisure in Moroni or Mt Karthala climb\n\nToday you have the option of leaving Moroni for a climb to the summit of Mt Karthala (2,361m). Although it is possible to do the climb in just one long day, we recommend that you camp at the summit in the crater itself and return the next day. For those not wishing to make the climb, you will have today and the next day to relax or perhaps enquire locally about the options to dive. Overnight at Golden Tulip Resort & Spa, or similar / camping. (B – Hotel / BLD – camping)\n\nMt Karthala\n\nMt Karthala is the largest active volcano in the world and erupts on a fairly regular basis – the last time being in 2005. The climb can be challenging and should only be attempted if you are reasonably fit. It will take about seven hours depending on your personal fitness. Although the slopes are normally blanketed in thick mist for much of the day, the summit and crater are frequently clear, rewarding you with the most spectacular of early morning sunrises. It should be noted that we only recommend attempting the climb during the dry season (between April and November). We will arrange for all camping equipment and supplies to be provided as well as a porter.\n\nDay 10: Moroni – Full day guided tour around the south of Grande Comore\n\nThis morning, we depart for a full day guided tour around the south of the island, stopping first to the beautiful white sand beaches of Galawa and Chomoni where you can enjoy a swim in the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean if you wish to. Continue on to Bandamadji with its nice costal view and short stop at Ouroveni village to see the impressive baobab twins. Later we stop at the superb Chindini beach where we also get a panoramic view of the island and continue to Singani, were one can still see the remaining of the last volcanic eruption dated from 1977. On the way back to Moroni we also visit the ruins of the former Sultan Palace built in the XVIIIth Century, stop by the peaceful lake Marabou where many birds nest and take a stop at the impressive suicide cliffs in Iconi for a reminder of the past slavery time – the spot is gorgeous but one can still feel the dramatic atmosphere as hundreds of women choose to commit suicide rather than being captured by slavers. Overnight at Golden Tulip Moroni Resort & Spa, or similar. (B)\n\nDay 11: Moroni - Departure from the Comoros\n\nTime at leisure to either relax or explore further until your transfer to the airport and your onward flight. (B)\n\nForeign Office Travel Warnings\n\nBefore booking your tour, please familiarise yourself with the country specific information provided by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) - www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice. This includes important information such as latest immigration requirements, and details of any travel advisories.\n\nWe constantly monitor the advice posted by the FCDO. In particular we will always advise clients of any travel warnings. At present there are no warnings against travel to the parts of Comoros that we visit on this tour. Please feel free to contact us should you have any specific concerns or would like to know in detail what measures are being taken to ensure visits remain trouble free and without incident.\n\nIt should be noted that this information applies to British citizens. Other nationals are asked to check the current position of their respective government.\n\nVisa Information\n\nAt the time of writing British, US and Australian nationals require a visa for a tourist visit to the Comoros.\n\nAlgeria. For further details please visit the applicable website shown below.\n\nBritish Nationals - www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\n\nUS Nationals - travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel.html\n\nAustralian Nationals - www.smartraveller.gov.au\n\nOther nationals should check the latest requirements with the authorities in their home country, or with the destination’s nearest embassy or consulate.\n\nShould you require any documentation to support a visa application, such as a letter of invitation, upon request this will be provided by Undiscovered Destinations after receipt of your balance payment.\n\nAs it is the travellers’ responsibility to ensure that they meet all entry requirements it is essential that you check the rules and any other conditions at the time of booking and again when making your balance payment. In addition, we would strongly advise that you make a final check around two weeks before your arrival. This is important as requirements can change at short notice. Undiscovered Destinations, when possible, will provide guidance about entry rules, but in the first instance please contact the relevant authorities, including the applicable embassy or consulate for assistance.\n\nPassports\n\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that you are in possession of a full passport, valid for at least six months after the date of return to your country.\n\nWe strongly advise that your passport contains a minimum of two blank pages, as this may be a requirement of the local immigration authorities. In addition, certain countries will stipulate that the two blank pages are opposite each other. If you are unable to meet these requirements, you may be refused boarding by your airline or denied entry by the immigration authorities.\n\nFor specific information about the requirements for your destination please check with the country’s embassy or consulate. Alternatively, UK citizens can visit www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice.\n\nVaccinations & Protection\n\nAs with travel to most parts of Africa, we strongly recommend that you contact your doctor’s surgery or a specialist travel clinic for up-to-date information, advice, and the necessary vaccinations. For a visit of less than one month, almost certainly you will be advised to have immunisations against the following: Diphtheria and Tetanus, Hepatitis A, Typhoid, Meningitis. The use of a DEET-containing insect repellent is highly recommended.\n\nThe legal status and regulation of some medicines prescribed or purchased in your home country can be different in other countries. If you’re travelling with prescription or over-the-counter medicine, read this guidance from NaTHNaC on best practice when travelling with medicines. For further information on the legal status of a specific medicine, you’ll need to contact the embassy, high commission or consulate of the country or territory you’re travelling to.\n\nTravel Insurance\n\nIt is a condition of booking with Undiscovered Destinations that you have adequate valid travel insurance. It is your responsibility to arrange appropriate travel insurance and ensure you have read and understood the full terms and conditions of your travel insurance policy to ensure that you are covered for all activities you intend to undertake whilst on the tour, including all optional activities. Your Insurance Policy must fully cover you for medical expenses (including cover for Covid-19 conditions) and emergency repatriation to your home country and be valid for the entire duration of your holiday.\n\nLocal Conditions\n\nWhen travelling to our destinations, many of which are underdeveloped and untouristed by mainstream tourism, a good deal of patience and a sense of humour is an important attribute. This will help you to cope with problems such as ageing or poor infrastructure and when maintenance may not be as high as we would always like.\n\nThe choice of appropriate accommodation in some towns and cities (particularly the smaller places) can be limited, and standards of both service and maintenance can be less than polished. Guides and other service providers in some of our destinations do not always have the decades of collective practice and experience that their counterparts in more developed countries can draw upon. Although we will always try and resolve any issues as quickly as possible, on occasions there may be some shortcomings which no matter how hard we try will be unavoidable."
