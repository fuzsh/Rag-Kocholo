        "text": "If you wish to disappear off the face of the earth and cradle in a blue-green gem of land, Comoros awaits you.\n\nA place so pristine and untouched, you’d wonder if it’s for real.\n\nFlanked by therapeutic toe-tickling white beaches, emerald green rainforests, and turquoise blue waters, Comoros is not your typical travel destination.\n\nSo, if you’re looking to explore an off-the-beat path, Comoros can be your perfect destination.\n\nAlthough the beaches alone are reason enough to pay a visit to this wonderland.\n\nTop reasons why you should visit the Comoros Islands.\n\n1. Whale Wathing and paradise beaches in Moheli\n\nMoheli- the smallest and probably the most fascinating island among the three islands in Comoros, is not your typical beach destination. Devoid of any mainstream amenities or beach activities this is a relaxing spot to unwind and slow down.\n\nThe beaches here are so gorgeous, people guiltlessly spend most of their well-curated Comoros holiday lounging on them.\n\nBut Moheli is one than just beautiful beaches, it´s also one of the best places in the world to swim and see humpback whales, the sparsely inhabited and enchantingly wild, Moheli houses the archipelago’s only national park- Parc Marin de Mohéli.\n\nThis is a place where you can watch sea turtles laying their eggs, snorkel and swim with the humpback whales and watch dolphins dancing with the waves. It´s one of the most pristine places in Africa.\n\nHere you can read a complete travel guide about Whale Watching in Moheli\n\n2. Streets and Sceneries of Fomboni\n\nOne of Comoros’ largest and major cities, Fomboni is a silent place located in the center of Mohéli island.\n\nYou can walk along the nameless main road that encircles the town and explore the markets and eateries flanking the street.\n\nThere’s also a quaint little jetty where you can watch the fishermen in action or just spend some time in solitude.\n\nNature lovers can visit Dziani Boundouni, a crater lake situated in the middle of the forests, through a day hike.\n\nWandering around the neighboring town of Nioumachoua and interacting with the locals can also be a great leisure activity.\n\nThe locals in this city are slightly more reserved than their busy counterparts but all the more friendly and welcoming.\n\n3. Off-the-Beat Paths of Anjouan\n\nLocally called Ndzouani, and nicknamed “The Pearl of Comoros” the unspoiled island of Anjouan is as remote as remote could get.\n\nComoros is called the “perfumed islands” because of the fragrant plants grown here that are used in the making of perfumes and essential oils.\n\nThe warm, heady scent of cloves and the fruity, flowery scents of ylang-ylang pervade the streets and woods of Anjouan.\n\nYou can wander through the old Arab plantations or head inland and saunter through the town of Mutsamudu.\n\nHere you’ll find old 17th-century structures like ancient mosques and citadels built in Swahili-Shirazi style- complete with intricate doors and winding alleyways.\n\nYou can also hike up the jungle-clad Mount Ntingui and choose a vantage point to watch the mist roll over the emerald hills, spot colorful birds or just enjoy the breathtaking vistas of the archipelago.\n\nFrom candy-colored sunsets to teal-colored waters, this tropical paradise of Anjouan seems to have jumped out of a fantasy novel.\n\n4. Gorgeous Lake Lac Sale at Grande Comore\n\nThe largest of Comoros island, Grande Comore is also the most developed one.\n\nWith the right balance of natural untouched landscapes and advanced bustling cities, this is one of the most beautiful places to visit in the whole of Comoros.\n\nIf you’re an adventure lover in search of an adrenaline rush, we have the perfect suggestion for you. A hike to the bottomless, saltwater crater lake of Lac Salé situated near the northern coast.\n\nFor a panoramic view of the lake, climb the small hill behind and the breathtaking green and blue-hued water is sure to enthrall you. There are also some souvenirs sold here.\n\nIf you’re yearning for a pleasant drive, head south of Grande Comore for lovely countryside-filled scenery.\n\nWhile the land on one side is covered in fruit-laden banana and coconut trees the other side is interspersed with vanilla and cassava plantations.\n\n5. Active Volcano at Mount Karthala\n\nCan anything be more exciting and thrilling than hiking up an active volcano?\n\nGrande Comore’s southern part is dominated by Mount Karthala, an active volcano that last erupted in 2007.\n\nMount Karthala is Comoros’ highest point and also the world’s largest active volcano that towers 7,500 feet above Grande Comore. It is reachable after a challenging two-day trek.\n\nThe view from the top, which consists of layers of thick, harsh plains of black lava fringed by the distant blue hues of the ocean, is a sight for sore eyes.\n\nNot only is the trek an enriching experience but the surrounding lush rainforests are a great site to spot some exotic birds!\n\n6. Laid-Back Capital of Moroni\n\nLocated on Grande Comore Island, Moroni is the capital city of Comoros. Head here for a cultural mix of French, Arabic, and Swahili traditions.\n\nThe streets, structures, and the whole neighbourhood is swathed in a network of ancient buildings and narrow alleys.\n\nIt’s reminiscent of the ancient Swahili and Arabian period, complete with traditionally dressed men smoking shisha and sipping on fragrant teas.\n\nMoroni’s major landmark is the two-storied, sparkling white, fifteenth century old, Friday Mosque.\n\nAnother prominent attraction is the Volo-Volo market whose streets are lined with quaint Middle Eastern-style cafes, spice stalls, and souvenir shops of local artisans.\n\nThough the area bustles with activity, it’s never chaotic.\n\nOn one side you find wheelbarrows heaped in colourful attires and on the other side you find carts selling fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nThis is also the best place to taste the local cuisines like chicken in coconut sauce, crunchy seafood, or stews made from freshly sourced vegetables.\n\n7. Relax at the Pristine beaches on Grande Comore, the best beach in Africa.\n\nComoros and the Grande Comore is home to some of the very best beaches in all of Africa, and best of all there, are no other tourist around on the beaches here, the bad thing, they are hard to reach, so you will have to make full day-trip to visit most of them.\n\nProbaly the best beach in the Comoros is the Mitsamiouli Beach which is located on the north west coast of the main island,\n\nAnother great beach located on the north western coast is the long stretch of beach at L’île aux Tortues and Ndroudé.\n\nBut if you don’t want to travel too far from Moroni so can you either relax at the public Moroni beach which is popular both among locals and the few foreigners living in the Comoros.\n\nThe Moroni beach is a great place to go for sunset, but also one of the very few places where you can buy ber and alcohol at the beach resturant.\n\nThe last beach you should check out is the beach located at Golden Tulip Hotel Grande Comore (Previously known as the Itsandra hotel)\n\nThis is the best hotel in Comoros; it offers a spa, a great dinner buffet, the best beach and Snorkelling around Moroni.\n\nIf you want to go Scuba diving or Kayaking so is this the only place on Grand Comore. You are free to use the beach with the sunbeds or the swimming pool here as long as you buy drinks or food at the bar,\n\nIf you need WIFI is the best place to come and to enjoy a cold beer, a cold, imported Madagascar beer at the sundeck while watching a fantastic sunset.\n\n8. Sea Cliffs of Iconi\n\nA town next door to Moroni, Iconi is in equal doses a sleepy village with a rugged, rock-filled coastline and a bustling town with shops and stores.\n\nOn one side is the famed Iconi Mosque while on the other are the breathtaking mountain cliffs.\n\nOnce an important trading port, this ancient town still has its history intact in the form of forts, palaces, and old buildings with attractive wood carvings.\n\nTwo of its other attractions are the Old Palace and the tomb of Prince Said Ibrahim, both of which are under renovation.\n\nConclusion about Comoros\n\nSo, these were the 10 reasons why you should visit Comoros. Language barrier notwithstanding, Comorian people are ever-ready to jump to your aid during times of need.\n\nAlso called Mwali or Moili by the locals, this is a land stuck in the past where the untouched nature makes up for the lack of modern amenities.\n\nFrom craggy islets to calm corners, it is the perfect place to satiate your wanderlust."
