        "text": "Highlights\n\nComoros islands do not belong to popular tourist destinations – but there is enormous potential. Islands are very poor – but the scenery is beyond gorgeous, local towns and villages may be dirty but people – friendly and welcoming.\n\nHighlights of Comoros are:\n\nHistorical towns. The value of ancient Comoran towns is not yet appreciated. These towns today are poor and mostly – very dirty, but they represent a unique blend of Persian and Swahili art and construction traditions. Comoran towns have narrow, crooked streets with centuries-old buildings, many buildings here are adorned with traditional woodcarvings.\n\nBiodiversity. A unique place is Mount Karthala near the capital of Comoros. Near the summit of this giant volcano grows the only forest of heath Erica comorensis, here live birds and other animals which are not met anywhere else in the world. But elsewhere in Comoros are found unique ecosystems as well.\n\nCentral Mohéli forests\n\nPristine forest (some 3000 ha in size) with numerous endemic species of reptiles and other organisms.\n\nMount Karthala shrubland\n\nUnique ecosystem, dominated by the endemic giant (up to 8 m high) heath Erica comorensis. Four species of birds are found only on the slopes of this volcano, such as Humblot’s Flycatcher, Comoro White-eye, Comoro Drongo, Karthala Scops Owl, and many other endemic species.\n\nShirazi Mosque in Domoni\n\nPossibly, the oldest mosque in Comoros. It was built by Shirazi settlers from Persia.\n\nMutsamudu\n\nHistorical trading city, established in the 14th century. A densely built city with narrow streets and historical architecture. Several covered bridges across the streets were preserved – a place where high-ranked women crossed the streets without being noticed. Traditional Swahili-Shiraze architecture with woodcarvings.\n\nDomoni\n\nHistorical town with narrow streets. It was established in the 12th century. Many houses have beautiful doors that are covered with woodcarvings. Fortification wall and tower, a fairly well-preserved palace from the 13th century. Palaces with polychrome ceilings. Fortification wall.\n\nIconi\n\nThe first capital of Grande Comore, was developed in the 12th century. Buildings are adorned with beautiful woodcarvings, remnants of old palaces, and fortifications.\n\nItsandra Mdjini\n\nSmall, walled maritime trade town, founded in the 14th century. Numerous historical buildings, such as the 17th-century fortress that is linked to the city with a 130 m long, fortified stairway.\n\nMoroni\n\nThe historical center of the old African – Arabic trade town, developed in the 14th century. Characteristic maze of narrow streets. In the former royal palace still live descendants of the royal family."
