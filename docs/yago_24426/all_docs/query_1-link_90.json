        "text": "Unspoiled nature and palm-fringed beaches\n\nDuring this active 8-day trip, most of the focus is on the unique and unspoiled nature of Comoros, on the islands of Grande Comore and Mohéli. A compact journey of discovery that includes the activities not to be missed. The trip can be completely customized or extended as desired.\n\nMohéli\n\nSo rich, unique and diverse is the nature of Mohéli that the entire island has been declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, and the Mohéli National Park includes a vast rainforest area as well as a marine area of 400km2. Against a backdrop of colorful coral, here you will swim among schools of fish, in water of unparalleled clarity. You may just see manta rays gliding majestically by, and you may see reef sharks, sea turtles and dolphins.\n\nTrade the silence of the underwater world for a walk in the sometimes noisy rainforest. Open all your senses wide for an intense experience. The forest chirps and sings, the ylang-ylang flower spreads a sweet fragrance, you will discover among the trees how cinnamon, black pepper and coffee grow. Seek out the friendly lemurs (Mongoose lemurs), and observe the impressive Livingstone's fruitbats as they rest - upside down - in their favorite tree. Wait patiently for such a flying fox to spread its wings, as its wingspan can reach up to 1.4m!\n\nAfter sunset, a magical experience awaits you: adult sea turtles come sauntering ashore, to lay their eggs. With luck, you will also see dozens or even hundreds of young turtles making their way to the sea.\n\nGrande Comore\n\nTake a trip to the crater rim of the active Karthala volcano, and look out over the complex of calderas. The skin of the earth here is wafer-thin; beneath it bubbles red-hot lava. The panoramic view of the island and ocean is fantastic from this height. In the capital, Moroni, you will see the diverse expressions of the melting pot of cultures. You will see it in the architecture, the clothing, the fresh produce in the market, and if you are lucky you will even experience an authentic wedding ceremony.\n\nTips & Tops Active Tour Grande Comore and Mohéli:"
