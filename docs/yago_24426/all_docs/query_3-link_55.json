        "text": "Comoros Country Profile\n\nGeneric Information\n\nComoros, officially the Union of the Comoros, is an island country in the Indian Ocean located at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel, off the eastern coast of Africa, between north-eastern Mozambique, the French region of Mayotte and north-western Madagascar. Other countries close to the Comoros are Tanzania in the north-west and Seychelles in the northeast. The capital and largest city is Moroni on Grande Comore. The Union of Comoros has three official languages: Comorian, French and Arabic. The religion of the majority of the population is Sunni Islam.\n\nWith 1,660 km2, Comoros is the fourth smallest country in Africa. The population is estimated at 850,000 (Grande Comore 590’000, Anjouan 185,000, and Mohéli 75’000). As a nation formed at a crossroads of different civilisations, the archipelago is noted for its diverse culture and history, first inhabited by Bantu speakers who came from East Africa, supplemented by Arab and Austronesian immigration.\n\nThe sovereign state is an archipelago consisting of three major islands and numerous smaller islands, all located in the volcanic Comoro Islands. The major islands are commonly known by their French name: Grande Comore (Ngazidja), Moheli (Mwali) and Anjouan (Nzwani). In addition, the country has a claim on a fourth island, Mayotte (Maore), located in the extreme south-east of the country which is currently administered by France (as an overseas department).\n\nThe Comoros is a member state of the African Union, the Francophonie, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League (of which it is the most southern state, and the only Member State with a tropical climate and entirely located in the Southern Hemisphere) and the Indian Ocean Commission (IOC).\n\nGeneric country information can be located from sources which are regularly maintained and reflect current facts and figures. For a generic country overview, please consult the following sources:\n\nWikipedia information for Comoros\n\nIMF information for Comoros\n\nEconomist Intelligence Unit information for Comoros*\n\n(*note - this is a paid service)\n\nHumanitarian Information\n\nComoros United Nation Development Programme information: http://www.km.undp.org\n\nComoros United Nations Children's Fund information: https://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/comoros.html\n\nPlateforme d’intervention régionale de l’océan Indien (PIROI) information: https://piroi.croix-rouge.fr/notre-actualite/?pf=37\n\nFacts and Figures\n\nWolfram Alpha information on Comoros\n\nWorld Bank information on Comoros\n\nDisasters, Conflicts, and Migration\n\nFor more detailed database on disasters by country, please see the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters: EMDAT information for Comoros\n\nSeasonal Effects on Logistics Capacities\n\nSeasonal Effects on Transport Transport Time Frame Comments Primary Road Transport Nov-Apr Primary roads are paved and passable all year. Blockages can be caused by landslides during the rainy season. The asphalt has deteriorated in some places. 16 Million Euros of the 10th EU FED are invested for the road network repairing. Secondary Road Transport Nov-Apr Non-paved roads can be non-passable during the rainy season. Rail Transport N/A N/A Air Transport All year round Air services are sometimes affected on account of severe weather conditions. Waterway Transport All year round Maritime transport is related to weather conditions; lack of well sheltered ports in Grand Comore and Moheli can impede load/unload operations with bad weather.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe DGSC (Direction Générale de la Sécurité Civile), under the authority of the Ministry of Interior is the department in charge of the National civil Security and Civil Protection. It is a national entity in charge of preparation, coordination, prevention and response of emergency crisis in Comoros. It has been officially established through a president official decree and leaders are appointed though the same decree. The operational section of the DGSC is the Centre des Operations de Secours et de la Protection Civile (COSEP). COSEP is the main organ of early warning and coordination of operations during a disaster response.\n\nIn case of emergencies COSEP coordinates the response: Civil Protection, UN, the Red Cross, or Comoros Red Crescent, and NGOs meets in the DGSC base.\n\nThe Comorian Government, with the collaboration and funding from UNDP have established a risk analysis and an operational emergency response plan for cyclones and volcanic eruptions. The Observatoire du Volcan Karthala (OVK) volcanic observatory has been established to monitor the seismic and volcanic activity.\n\nFor more information on government contact details, please see the following link: 4.1 Government Contact List.\n\nHumanitarian Community\n\nThe international humanitarian community has little presence on the Comoros archipelago. The French Red Cross, through the PIROI (Regional Intervention Platform for the Indian Ocean), set up, from the year 2000, a regional structure of intervention in case of disaster including pre-stored relief and emergency stocks such as: buckets, jerry cans, mosquito nets, lanterns, stoves, treatment units Water, family tents, rescue station, warehouse tent (66sqm), and sleeping mats.\n\nThe Comoros Red Crescent trains and coordinates volunteers who can intervene when needed. Several UN agencies such as UNDP, UNICEF, WHO and the World Bank are present in Moroni, the regional office of WFP in Johannesburg has set up a rapid response plan for natural disasters.\n\nCitizens and the private sector in the country are actively participating and donating, after the floods in May 2012 and hurricane Kenneth in 2019.\n\nFor more information on humanitarian agency details, please see the following link: 4.2 Comoros Humanitarian Agency Contact List."
