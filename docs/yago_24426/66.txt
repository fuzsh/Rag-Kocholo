Why Mohéli Island is Unique

Mohéli Island stands out from other travel destinations for several reasons. Firstly, it is one of the least developed islands in Comoros, which means you can experience an untouched and authentic environment. The pristine beaches, lush forests, and diverse wildlife make this island a haven for nature enthusiasts.

One of the most unique features of Mohéli Island is its commitment to conservation. The island is home to the Mohéli Marine Park, a protected area that aims to preserve the rich marine biodiversity. Snorkeling and diving in the crystal-clear waters of the park allow you to witness vibrant coral reefs and swim alongside sea turtles, dolphins, and countless tropical fish species.

Another aspect that sets Mohéli Island apart is its cultural heritage. The island has a strong African and Arabian influence, reflected in its traditions, music, and cuisine. Exploring the local villages and interacting with the friendly inhabitants will give you a glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry of Mohéli Island.

Best Time to Visit

The best time to visit Mohéli Island is during the dry season, which runs from June to October. During this period, the weather is pleasant, with plenty of sunshine and lower chances of rainfall. The dry season is ideal for outdoor activities, such as hiking, snorkeling, and wildlife spotting.

However, if you prefer a more vibrant atmosphere and don’t mind occasional showers, the wet season from November to May can also be a good time to visit. The island’s lush vegetation comes to life during this period, and you may even witness some rare migratory bird species.

How to Get to Mohéli Island

Getting to Mohéli Island requires a bit of planning, but the journey is well worth it. There are no direct international flights to Mohéli Island, so you will need to fly to Moroni, the capital of Comoros, first. From Moroni, you can take a domestic flight or a ferry to Mohéli Island.

The Comoros Islands have an extensive network of domestic flights, with several airlines operating regular flights to Mohéli Island. The flight duration from Moroni to Mohéli Island is approximately 30 minutes, offering breathtaking aerial views of the turquoise waters and lush landscapes.

If you prefer a more scenic route, you can also take a ferry from Moroni to Mohéli Island. The ferry ride takes around 8 hours, but it allows you to enjoy panoramic views of the Indian Ocean and soak in the tranquility of the journey.

Local Transportation on Mohéli Island

Once you arrive on Mohéli Island, you’ll find that it is relatively small and easy to navigate. The most common mode of transportation for locals and tourists alike is the traditional dhow boats, which serve as water taxis. These boats can take you to different parts of the island, including the Mohéli Marine Park and the picturesque beaches.

If you prefer to explore the island by land, you can rent a bicycle or a scooter from the local rental shops. This allows you to discover hidden trails, visit remote villages, and immerse yourself in the island’s natural beauty at your own pace.
