        "text": "The Feminist Know-It-All: You know her. You can’t stand her. Good thing she’s not here! Instead, this column by gender and women’s studies librarian Karla Strand will amplify stories of the creation, access, use and preservation of knowledge by women and girls around the world; share innovative projects and initiatives that focus on information, literacies, libraries and more; and, of course, talk about all of the books.\n\nThrough this column, I provide Ms. readers with a list of new books being published by writers from historically excluded groups.\n\nThe aims of the column are threefold:\n\nI want to do my part in the disruption of what has been the acceptable “norm” in the book world for far too long—white, cis, heterosexual, male;\n\nI want to amplify amazing works by writers who are women, Black, Indigenous, Latinx, APIA/AAPI, international, LGBIA+, TGNC, queer, disabled, fat, immigrant, Muslim, neurodivergent, sex-positive or of other historically marginalized identities—you know, the rest of us; and\n\nI want to challenge and encourage you all to buy, borrow and read them!\n\nYou’ve seen the other “most anticipated books for 2023” lists, now read this one… you know, for the rest of us!\n\nI have spent the last few months scouring catalogs and websites, receiving hundreds of books and even more emails from authors, publicists and publishers, reading your book Tweets and DMs, all to find out what books are coming out in 2023 that I think you, my exceptional, inquisitive and discerning Ms. readers, will want to hear about.\n\nBut let’s state the obvious first. I know I am biased but the first book I am most excited about this year is releasing in September. It’s 50 Years of Ms.: The Best of the Pathfinding Magazine That Ignited a Revolution, of course, edited by Kathy Spillar, with an introduction by Ellie Smeal and a foreword by Gloria Steinem! Preorder yours and be sure to celebrate with us all year long.\n\nOkay, now on to the rest of the list. There are more than 80 books here and honestly, for each one I’ve included, there are at least two (or 10) other great books coming out by women of color, femmes, queer and gender-diverse writers that I could’ve picked. It was near impossible to choose from among them, and that is so great! I love seeing more books each year that challenge the colonizer status quo of publishing and open more hearts and minds to the delicious joy and wisdom that comes from reading books outside our usual shelves.\n\nSo some of the well-publicized books you’ve probably already heard about and should absolutely read but that aren’t on this list include Rebecca Makkai’s I Have Some Questions for You (Feb. 21); Jessica George’s Maame (Jan. 31); Ayọ̀bámi Adébáyọ̀’s A Spell of Good Things (Feb. 7); Rachel Heng’s The Great Reclamation (Mar. 28); and more.\n\nWhile there are some books here from the Big Publishers—HarperCollins included, but I remain in full support of the strike—I focus my energies on indie publishers, debut authors and those who may not have the resources of the heavy hitters. These are still amazing books by wonderful writers that you should definitely check out.\n\nSo let’s get to it!\n\nThe fine print:\n\nYou’ll notice the list is front-loaded because, well, we know about more books coming out in the next few months than those coming in the fall.\n\nRelease dates are always subject to change, especially for books due to come out later in the year.\n\nI include nonfiction and academic titles because I know you are smart people who are always learning!\n\nI also include young adult (YA) books because they are often on the cutting edge in terms of character inclusion and candor about the realities of the world in which we live.\n\nI don’t include poetry (SORRY!) only because the list is already so long—but watch for my poetry round-up coming in April.\n\nI am certain to have missed some fine new books or just decided not to include others. I can’t include them all, so when I curate these lists, I choose to highlight debut authors and indie publishers presuming the big names may have the resources to reach more people on their own. (That’s why it’s a damn good thing I give you a list of new releases every month so be sure to come back to check those out.)\n\nTL;DR: Here’s your TBR (to be read) for the year. Enjoy!\n\nJanuary\n\n(See my list of January Reads for more!)\n\nBad Cree: A Novel\n\nBy Jessica Johns (Sucker Creek First Nation) (@JessicaStellaaa). Doubleday. 272 pages.
