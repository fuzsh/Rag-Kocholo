        "text": "Heartburn is a burning feeling in the chest caused by stomach acid travelling up towards the throat (acid reflux). If it keeps happening, it may be called gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD).\n\nCheck if you have acid reflux\n\nThe main symptoms of acid reflux are:\n\nheartburn – a burning sensation in the middle of your chest\n\nan unpleasant sour taste in your mouth, caused by stomach acid\n\nYou may also have:\n\na cough or hiccups that keep coming back\n\na hoarse voice\n\nbad breath\n\nbloating and feeling sick\n\nSymptoms are often worse after eating, when lying down and when bending over.\n\nCauses of heartburn and acid reflux\n\nLots of people get heartburn from time to time. There's often no obvious reason why.\n\nSometimes it's caused or made worse by:\n\ncertain food and drink – such as coffee, tomatoes, alcohol, chocolate and fatty or spicy foods\n\nbeing overweight\n\nsmoking\n\npregnancy - find out more about indigestion and heartburn in pregnancy\n\nstress and anxiety\n\nan increase in some types of hormones, such as progesterone and oestrogen\n\nsome medicines, such as anti-inflammatory painkillers (like ibuprofen)\n\na hiatus hernia – when part of your stomach moves up into your chest\n\na stomach ulcer\n\na bacterial infection in your stomach\n\nHow you can ease heartburn and acid reflux yourself\n\nSimple lifestyle changes can help stop or reduce heartburn.\n\nDo\n\neat smaller, more frequent meals\n\ntry to lose weight if you're overweight\n\ntry to find ways to relax\n\nDon’t\n\ndo not have food or drink that triggers your symptoms\n\ndo not eat within 3 or 4 hours before bed\n\ndo not wear clothes that are tight around your waist\n\ndo not smoke\n\ndo not drink too much alcohol\n\ndo not stop taking any prescribed medicine without speaking to a doctor first\n\nYou may find that using wood, bricks or books to raise the head of your bed by around 10 to 20cm, so your chest and head are above your waist, helps relieve symptoms. This can help stop stomach acid travelling up towards your throat.\n\nBut do not try to achieve the same effect by using additional pillows, as this can increase pressure on your belly and make your symptoms worse.\n\nA pharmacist can help with heartburn and acid reflux\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist for advice if you keep getting heartburn.\n\nThey may recommend medicines called antacids or alginates that can help ease your symptoms.\n\nIt's best to take these with food or soon after eating, as this is when you're most likely to get heartburn. They may also work for longer if taken with food.\n\nAlthough antacids and alginates help symptoms in the short term, they will not cure the problem and should not be taken regularly for long periods.\n\nIf you're pregnant, a pharmacist can advise you about medicines you can take.\n\nNon-urgent advice: See a GP if:\n\nlifestyle changes and pharmacy medicines are not helping your heartburn\n\nyou have heartburn most days\n\nyou also have other symptoms, like food getting stuck in your throat, frequently being sick, or losing weight for no reason\n\nA GP can provide alternative or stronger treatments and help rule out any more serious causes of your symptoms.\n\nIf at any time you feel your symptoms are getting worse, contact a GP, go to 111.nhs.uk or call 111.\n\nTreatment for heartburn and acid reflux from a GP\n\nIf you have acid reflux, a GP may prescribe a medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that reduces how much acid your stomach makes.\n\nPPIs include:\n\nomeprazole\n\nlansoprazole\n\nYou'll usually need to take this type of medicine for 4 or 8 weeks, depending on how serious your acid reflux is.\n\nGo back to the GP if your symptoms return after stopping your medicine. You may need a long-term prescription.\n\nImportant\n\nIf a PPI does not help, your doctor may suggest trying a different type of medicine called an H2 receptor antagonist, such as famotidine.\n\nTests and treatments for severe heartburn and acid reflux\n\nIf medicines do not help or your symptoms are severe, a GP may refer you to a specialist for:\n\ntests to find out what's causing your symptoms, such as a gastroscopy (where a thin tube with a camera inside it is passed down your throat and into your stomach)\n\ntests to check for bacteria that can cause heartburn – this can be treated with a combination of antibiotics and PPIs\n\nsurgery on your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus) to stop acid reflux"
