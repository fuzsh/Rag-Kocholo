        "text": "At the Golf Club at Devils Tower, we strive to create and provide the finest experience possible for our members and their guests. Since our course is located in the scenic “Black Hills” of northeast Wyoming, it is essential that the golf carts we use are both comfortable and powerful as well as aesthetically pleasing and cost efficient for us to operate. This last season, with the personal attention of sales manager Justin Allred from Masek Golf Car Company, we were able to trade in our existing fleet of Yamaha YDRA golf cars and upgrade to the new EFI units saving us on both monthly lease expenses and fuel cost. Our members immediately noticed the smoother acceleration and we noticed the 18% savings in gas mileage! Yamaha ergonomics provide a large comfortable seat and four cup holder dash along with storage compartments not only keep everything organized but allow our staff to opportunity to stage various information on product such as goodie bags etc. right at their fingertips. We are happy to provide a product to our members that is a recognized industry leader and our staff has been fortunate to work with a dealer that takes pride in customer service.\n\nThis is my second time purchasing a golf cart fleet from Joe/Desert Golf Cars; it was a \"no brainer\" decision after my first experience. Joe’s strong customer service skills coupled with his team’s keen attention to detail in golf cart fleet maintenance are unmatched. We have several elevation changes that demand a strong product like Yamaha, and it stands up to the test. The craftsmanship in the golf cart does not go unnoticed. Whether you’re in Phoenix or in Northern Arizona, Joe and his team will provide service and buying experience for you like you’re the neighbor next door.\n\nTatanka Golf Club chose Yamaha carts for the efficient power needed to get around this course, there are so many up and down hills with severe climbs we needed a cart that would be able to handle this for an 18 hole period. The overall value we received from Yamaha was unmatched, the high quality cart we received and the low cost was exactly what we were looking for in our new opening. Yamaha's customers service was second to none, it seemed that I was getting calls on a regular basis asking on the carts progress here, I had all questions answered with minutes of me asking. We are extremely happy with the fleet of Yamaha carts we have here, I have never seconded guessed my decision when going with Yamaha.\n\nSome say service sells. I completely agree, but I would take it further and say that service saves. My budget is tight. I need a dependable fleet that looks good, rides good and worth my monthly lease payment. I am very happy with my Yamaha fleet, but I am even happier with the attention to service. Since the first meeting with Joe Ronewicz, I never felt like a sale. Always quick to answer a text or email, Joe not only saved me money, he continues to save me headaches. My purchase of a Yamaha fleet and preventative maintenance program has proved to be the beginning of a relationship, not the result of transaction. What a concept.\n\nWe are currently on our fourth fleet of Yamaha cars and can say without question that the Yamaha brand cars are the best we’ve owned. To give a little background for that statement, over my father’s 50 years of services to the municipal golf courses in Cheyenne, we have had the opportunity to work with Club Car. Harley Davidson, E-Z-Go, and Hyundai. We have run gas and electric cars in all these brands. Without question, the Yamaha cars have been the best running, most durable, best looking, and most serviceable cars we have had. There are the reasons we continue to purchase the Yamaha brand golf car. Keep up the great work!\n\nFountains has been with Yamaha for over seven years now. We purchased the golf course in 2007, and inherited Yamaha Golf Cars from Boylan. We have had outstanding service. Typically, a cart or two that may have been damaged will be fixed within a couple of days after we call. Your service technician that comes to our golf course, Kevin, is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and cooperative. I would highly recommend Golf Cars + and Yamaha Golf Cars to any facility in need of a new fleet.\n\nI have owned my own golf courses for over the past 25 years. During this time I have owned and leased golf cars from all the major companies in the industry. Joe Ronewicz has provided the best service and follows up far better than anyone else. I am finishing my 6th year with my Yamaha gas cars and they still look brand new and performance is outstanding. I also have over 400 other Yamaha Golf Cars at my other courses that are a mix of electric and gas, with no concerns about reliability.\n\nWe have had an ongoing relationship with Masek Golf Cars of Colorado for 5 years and Masek Golf Cars has always been committed to providing great service and wonderful products. They have exceeded my expectations each time, from service to sales to replacement parts and to new fleet opportunities. They have a well-trained and friendly staff willing to help in anyway. We look forward to doing business with them in the future and continuing our great relationship with Masek. Congratulations to Masek for having a great company and wonderful people working for it.\n\nMy name is Justin Cirbo, and I am the PGA General Manager of Spring Valley Golf Club in Elizabeth Colorado. I have the distinct pleasure of doing business with Masek and Yamaha for nearly 15 years. During this time frame, I have come to appreciate working with all aspects if the Masek/Yamaha operation. From their sales force to customer service all the way up to ownership, Yamaha/Masek are truly first class originations. After leasing carts through Yamaha and Masek for over a decade now, we have decided to purchase our first fleet. This was a big decision for our business, but one that was made confidently due to our working relationship and respect for the Masek/Yamaha companies. It has been our privilege working with these companies, and we look forward to continuing this relationship into the future as our business continues to grow. With seamless transition in fleets, I would recommend this company to anyone looking to help their golf cart operation.\n\nWe are starting our second year with Yamaha and Cunningham Golf. We switched our fleet from electric to gas carts and it was one of the best decisions we have made, both with efficiency and financially. Cunningham has been great to work with and follow up to make sure we are always satisfied. I would recommend Yamaha and Cunningham to any other course!"
