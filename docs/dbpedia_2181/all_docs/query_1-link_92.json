How we write our content →\n\nTretinoin is an effective solution if you are seeking to improve skin texture, reduce wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, and combat acne. In this article we asked Dr. Alpana Mohta, expert dermatologist about when you should apply it, how often, the strength you should start with, the amount you should use, and how to layer it in order to minimize skin irritation and other undesired side effects.\n\nSo, if you’re ready to dive into the world of tretinoin, we will help you gain a deeper understanding of how to use this prescription strength medication to achieve the clear complexion you desire.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about tretinoin, read our Tretinoin patient guide by board-certified dermatologist Dr. Alpana Mohta.\n\nWhen should you apply tretinoin?\n\nAccording to Dr. Mohta, you should always apply tretinoin at night. This is because when retinoids are exposed to sunlight, they can create harmful substances and excite retinoid molecules. These reactions can cause immediate and long-term damage in your skin1.\n\nDo you apply tretinoin all over your face?\n\nYes, Dr. Mohta says you should apply a very thin layer (pea-sized amount) of tretinoin to your entire face and neck.\n\nHow much tretinoin should I apply to my face?\n\nDr. Mohta says you should apply a pea-sized amount of tretinoin to the tip of your finger and touch several areas of your face leaving a tiny amount behind each time. After you have done this, distribute the tretinoin cream evenly over your face.\n\nWhat tretinoin strength should I use first?\n\nDr. Mohta recommends you start with a low (0.01% or 0.025%) tretinoin strength so your skin gets used to the medication.\n\nConsidering adding a specific tretinoin strength to your skincare routine? Begin your journey here: Tretinoin 0.025% cream | Tretinoin 0.05% cream | Tretinoin 0.01% cream.\n\nHow to get a tretinoin prescription?\n\nYou can start a photo consultation with an online dermatologist to request a tretinoin prescription for acne or anti-aging. This is done via the Miiskin app. The process is very simple and it takes a few minutes.\n\nA provider will evaluate your case and get back to you in one or two days’ time. You can collect your prescription at your local pharmacy the same day.\n\nThe price of a virtual consultation is $59 and you need to pay cash for it, however the price of your medication may be covered by insurance depending on your health plan.\n\nHow long should I use tretinoin for?\n\nDr. Mohta says that tretinoin can be used long term, even your entire life, as tretinoin is commonly used for the treatment of acne, fine lines, wrinkles, and hyperpigmentation.\n\nDr. Mohta, also says that it may be necessary to use tretinoin for a few weeks before you can notice changes in your skin. This is because the skin needs to adjust to the medication for the full benefits to become apparent.\n\nWhat is the sandwich method of tretinoin?\n\nThe sandwich method involves washing your face with a mild cleanser, patting it dry with a towel and waiting 30 minutes. After this time you can then apply a layer of moisturizer, wait 10 more minutes, apply a thin layer of tretinoin and wait 10 more minutes to then apply a final layer of moisturizer or a hyaluronic acid serum.\n\nWhy wait 30 min after washing your face to apply tretinoin?\n\nYou need to wait 20 to 30 minutes before applying tretinoin to ensure your skin is completely dry. If you apply it ahead of time, you risk irritating your skin. Using a micronized version of tretinoin or Altreno can minimize the risk of irritation.\n\nHow often should I use tretinoin in the beginning?\n\nThese are some recommendations Dr. Mohta usually gives her patients:\n\nFirst 2 weeks: Apply low concentration (0.01% or 0.025%) two nights per week\n\nFollowing 2/4 weeks: Apply tretinoin 3 times per week or every other night\n\nAfter 6/8 weeks of use: If your skin tolerates the product well, apply the product every night\n\nAfter 12 weeks: After 12 weeks of using the product on a daily basis. You may be able to increase the strength of the product (0.04%, 0.05% and 0.1%). People with sensitive skin can benefit from using micronized formulations.\n\nHow long does it take for tretinoin to work?\n\nMost patients using tretinoin for the first time will begin to notice a positive effect after approximately 10 weeks, if they are using it every 2-3 days. Learn a week by week process of how long does tretinoin take to work.\n\nShould I use tretinoin every night?\n\nYou should aim to use tretinoin every night, however, you must start slowly as your skin needs to get used to it. The first 2 weeks apply it 2 to 3 nights per week, after that try applying it every other day, and then if your skin can handle it, apply it every night. However, skip a night or two if your skin is irritated, because it will make it worse.\n\ntreno which is much more gentle on the skin as its formulation includes: micronized tretinoin, collagen, hyaluronic acid and glycerin. In clinical trials this tretinoin version caused skin irritation to only 1% of patients using it6.\n\nWarning and precautions when using tretinoin\n\nAccording to Dr. Mohta, you should always use a daily sunscreen SPF 50 when using tretinoin and reapply it every 2 hours when outdoors.\n\nYou should also avoid using too much of your tretinoin cream. You only need a pea-sized amount to cover your entire face. Using too much cream can increase your risk of experiencing side effects without offering extra benefits.\n\nDo not do any dermaplaning treatments while using tretinoin. Do not wax or use chemical peels. Do not use tanning beds or expose yourself to the sun and use protective gear (sun hats, sunglasses and sunscreen) if you do and do not do any laser treatments while using tretinoin. All these things can increase your risk of increasing the side effects of tretinoin.\n\nRetinoids cannot be used by women who want to get pregnant, are pregnant, or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing age should use effective contraception due to the teratogenic effects of retinoids. Tretinoin is approved for people 12 years of age or more and some of the micronized versions may be used by people 9 years of age or older.\n\nFrequently asked questions about the proper use of tretinoin\n\nWhat is a tretinoin burn?\n\nA tretinoin burn, also referred to as retinization, tretinoin irritation, occurs when you start using tretinoin and may cause symptoms like burning, dryness, peeling, redness, and flaking. Dr. Mohta suggests that these symptoms typically subside as your skin adjusts to the product. To treat a tretinoin burn, it is advised to stop using tretinoin until the symptoms cease. To soothe inflamed skin a cold compress and maintain a gentle skincare routine without makeup. Use a gentle, ceramide, propylene glycol, or hyaluronic acid-based moisturizer to help to rehydrate your skin. It will seal moisture so your skin can heal and will provide you relief from flaking and dryness.\n\nWhat is the tretinoin purge?\n\nDr. Mohta says that the so-called tretinoin purge is a common skin reaction that occurs when a patient uses tretinoin for the first time. The symptoms often associated with this process include intensified acne breakouts (for a short period of 2 to 6 weeks), severe skin dryness and peeling, redness and irritation. However, this process is temporary and once it’s over, in general, the skin will improve, and you will be able to see the positive effects of tretinoin.\n\nWhen to contact your healthcare provider?\n\nDr. Mohta says that you need to make sure that the symptoms you are experiencing are within the realm of what is “typical” as far as side effects go. Call your healthcare provider if your skin irritation is causing you severe pain or if it gets too uncomfortable.\n\nHow do you maximize tretinoin results?\n\nTo maximize the results of tretinoin, start slowly, apply tretinoin at night on perfectly dry skin and between two layers of moisturizer, wear sunscreen with SPF 50 every morning, and combine with niacinamide or hyaluronic acid to minimize irritation.\n\nWhat cannot be mixed with tretinoin?\n\nYou should not combine tretinoin with any other retinoid. Unless indicated by your dermatologist, you should avoid using these ingredients at the same time or on the same day as tretinoin: benzoyl peroxide, lactic acid, salicylic acid, and physical exfoliants.\n\nWhat cancels out tretinoin?\n\nThe effectiveness of tretinoin can be reduced by sun exposure as tretinoin is photosensitive, which means it degrades in daylight. A study shows that benzoyl peroxide in conjunction with light exposure reduced the effectiveness of tretinoin gel within 24 hours under specific lighting conditions up to 80%. If your tretinoin tube has not been stored properly or if it has been open for more than 6 months can also reduce efficacy of the medication.\n\nWhat is best paired with tretinoin?\n\nTretinoin should always be paired with a moisturizer and sunscreen with a SPF 50. In addition to these two items, you can also pair it up with Vitamin C (applied before your sunscreen in the morning) and hyaluronic acid or niacinamide 10 minutes after applying your tretinoin cream.\n\nDo I need to wash tretinoin off in the morning?\n\nYes, it is recommended to wash your face every morning before applying vitamin C, your moisturizer and sunscreen with SPF 50.\n\nCan you put hyaluronic acid over tretinoin?\n\nYes, in fact it is recommended that you apply hyaluronic acid over tretinoin as this ingredient complements the effects of tretinoin due to its ability to attract and retain moisture in the skin. Tretinoin can cause dryness and irritation, especially in the beginning, so adding hyaluronic acid into your skincare routine can help minimize these side effects."
