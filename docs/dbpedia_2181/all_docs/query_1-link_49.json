        "text": "Minette Walters goes for a walk on the wild side in ACID ROW (Putnam, $24.95), departing from the sinuous storytelling of her novels of psychological suspense to take a more dynamic approach to the spectacle of mob violence in a low-income, crime-infested housing development on the outskirts of London. There is no ambiguity about the events in this urban thriller, which are based on actual incidents of community vigilantism gone haywire. A neglected child disappears from home, presumably lured away by a child molester. Alerted to the presence of a convicted pedophile on their home ground, outraged mothers at a nearby project mount a protest that is co-opted by a savage element of local teenagers fueled by drink and fury. The rampage spreads until some 2,000 people are caught up in the riot, which claims three lives and injures scores.\n\nWalters focuses on a few key households -- including one in which the pedophile and his creepy son are holding a female physician hostage -- and methodically tracks the trajectory of violence as it spreads from house to house on a wave of escalating anger. The tension is fierce, but not as piercing as her group portrait of social outcasts for whom ''the pedophile was just an excuse for the boiling resentment of Acid Row's underclass.''\n\nBarbara Hambly continues to delight us with her sensuous evocation of life in New Orleans in the turbulent era of the 1800's. In WET GRAVE (Bantam, $23.95), she gives the stage to the buccaneers who dropped anchor in the Barataria islands to ply their trade in guns, slaves and smuggled goods. Ben January, the freed slave who holds the moral high ground in this series, is investigating the death of a used-up prostitute who enchanted him in his youth (''January had seen what became of freebooters' women when they ceased to be young and fiery and gay'') when he gets wind of one clandestine smuggling transaction that could lead to a slave revolt.\n\nGiven Hambly's panoramic views of life in this boisterous city, we'd be lost without someone like January to guide us through its various social quarters and to interpret its many patois. As an accomplished musician, January has access to the finest drawing rooms in the city, and as ''a 6-foot-3-inch Congo-black Negro'' he is welcomed in the meanest slave quarters. And when a mighty storm floods the riverbank, we discover that he can make his way through the swamps, too.\n\nHas it really been 12 years since the publication of Joseph Trigoboff's bruising police procedural ''The Bone Orchard''? Guess so, although there's little sense of time lost in its equally muscular sequel, THE SHOOTING GALLERY (Lyons/Globe Pequot, $19.95), which finds the New York City police detective Alvin Yablonsky in Central Park on New Year's Eve, keeping the peace at a celebrity party at Tavern on the Green when a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist is found frozen in an ice sculpture. Since the reporter was doing an expos√© on police corruption for his muckraking newspaper, the case blooms into a high-profile event involving everyone who is anyone in this town, from bent judges and tricky politicians to the literary elite who take the murder of one of their own very personally.\n\nTrigoboff has his ways of cutting his self-important characters down to size: by letting movie stars stuff themselves silly with cocaine, by ribbing cops who try to hustle their stories to film directors, by marching fastidious doctors through a homeless encampment. And when it's time to toughen up, as Yablonsky must when he picks his way through a booby-trapped drug den, Trigoboff is up to that task, too. Although his populist political sensibility has a tendency to round off all the character edges, he brings a nice clarity of vision to the murky ethics of the hard-boiled school.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
