        "text": "Then. Now. Always. Celebrating 150 Years of Saint Peter’s Prep, by Jim Horan, ’70, is a richly illustrated journey through all things Prep. This much-anticipated final piece of Prep’s sesquicentennial celebration is now available for preorder via the Prep Campus Shop (Books are expected in stock no later than May 5).\n\nThen. Now. Always. chronicles Prep history through the eyes of more than 100 alumni, teachers, administrators, and coaches who have lived those days of Pride & Glory firsthand. The hardcover book’s 352 pages are a beautiful, full-color exploration of all things Prep, from the arrival of the first Jesuits by boat more than 150 years ago to the arrival of the Saint Peter statue on Warren Street in the fall of 2022.\n\nReaders will gain new insight into Prep’s beginnings thanks in part to rarely-seen official diaries—which Horan likens to a nautical “captain’s log”—kept by the Jesuits who secured the school’s charter, developed the initial curriculum, opened the first buildings, and steered the school through its first few decades. But as the years roll by, the diaries give way to glimpses of life at Grand & Warren year by year, as recalled by alumni from each class from 1940-2022. These accounts are supplemented by personal reflections from some of Prep’s “boldface names,” sidebars on Prep culture, perspectives on the broader historical context and, of course, hundreds of stunning photos that capture 150 years of Prep Pride.\n\nThen. Now. Always. is sure to hold a special place in the heart—and on the bookshelf—of anyone who loves Saint Peter’s Prep, and it will be here just in time to make a great gift for the Prep Mom, Dad, or Grad in your life!"
