        "text": "Yes it does.\n\nIt overheats to such an extent due to power dissipation that it melts.\n\nIn the case of a base stopper one wants it to survive undamaged in the event of some amplifier abuse.\n\nIf the output devices did catastophically fail, then a blown base stopper is not the end of the world.\n\nIt is about power dissipation !\n\nHi Andrew,\n\nYou are exactly right about both fuses and resistors, perhaps with the exception of a few extreme cases for resistors.\n\nMany people have only a vague understanding of how fuses work. They must have some resistance and must heat up in order to work. It is about power dissipation, although there are some significant nonlinearities in the way it functions. As it heats up, its resistance increases and that in turn increases the amount of power dissipated in it. Fuses take quite a long time to blow unless they are subjected to current much larger than their rating. Just go to the LittleFuse web site and look at the blowing time vs overload curves.\n\nHowever, fuses can \"wear out\" if repeatedly subjected to significant overloads.\n\nMany resistor types can be remarkably robust to brief overloads of easily 10 times their rated dissipation. Metal Oxide Film (MOF) resistors are very robust this way. I usually use 3-Watt MOF's for output emitter resistors rather than non-inductive wirewound resistors. I don't know about the level of robustness of SMT resistors to brief large overloads.\n\nCheers,\n\nBob"
