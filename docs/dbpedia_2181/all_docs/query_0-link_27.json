        "text": "1 Out of 150 — or 0.67%\n\nThat's how many products one can say are truly worth it in a market overloaded with skincare choices.\n\nJust think back on all the different clothing brands you've tried. How many do you still swear by?\n\nThat little sliver you see above is where you'll find Full Moon Dip®.\n\nSkeptical? That's okay. Keep reading so you know this is more than hype!\n\nI can't summarize things into one perfect sound bite.\n\nBut if you're looking for one woman's obsession to create something that can bring a beautiful, iridescent glow to your face, then just give me 2 minutes of your time by continuing below.\n\nInspired by the Virtual World\n\nIn the last few years, when video calls became a “thing”, so did the race to figure out how to look better under any lighting because most lighting makes us look tired and quite frankly, terrible!\n\nThink back for a moment: you joined a work call or FaceTimed your girlfriends. But the combo of poor lighting and camera quality washed out your face and made you look worse!\n\nMaybe you thought, “why did I even bother to put on makeup?!”\n\nI had that same experience.\n\nIt inspired me to find a way to help women highlight their natural beauty under any lighting.\n\nTo give them a gorgeous, awakened and radiant sheen (no Instagram filters or Photoshop necessary).\n\nWith or without makeup.\n\nBut adding something to a routine would need to work for everyone, on camera or in person.\n\nIt has to have a barely-there texture and the right ingredients to be compatible with every skin type (especially dry skin).\n\nLet me explain how we did just that (and I'll show you the results in real, undoctored photos)...\n\n7 Formulations + Sunlight, Office Light & On-Camera Tests\n\nWhen you use Full Moon Dip®, achieving a beautiful glow like this will be effortless:\n\nBut formulating it was incredibly difficult.\n\nOne thing I knew we'd do for certain is start with the billowy texture of our cult-classic body moisturizer, Moon Dip®.\n\nThe texture is as light as air. And the three botanicals are perfect for all skin types:\n\nJojoba oil to moisturize and nourish the skin without clogging pores.\n\nOrganic cucumber extract (from FarmHouse Fresh grown cucumbers) to improve the look of skin texture through vitamin C and key antioxidants.\n\nUS-grown non-GMO soybean oil to reduce dryness with a spectrum of omega fatty acids.\n\nBut something needed to be added so it could provide you with an incredible glow. I wasn't certain how to get a universally flattering sheen for all skin tones.\n\nWe tried 7 different ingredient combinations and spent hours with each formula testing its look under makeup, over makeup, lightly tapped on cheekbones - and also in sunlight, in office light and on camera across 5 skin tones.\n\nWe found the winning combination: a blend of natural mica minerals with a hint of pink, which provides a beautiful iridescent natural sheen. (Keep reading to see real-world photo examples.)\n\nThat's why this is known as Full Moon Dip®… it's like a light pink dusting of radiance that hits every high point of the face — just like moonlight would on a clear night.\n\nSee for yourself across so many skin types in the images below — the youthful glow is real!\n\nThis was Just an Overview\n\nBut if you spend a few more minutes on this page, you'll discover so much more:\n\nOver 1,000 customer reviews (almost all 5 stars) and Instagram posts.\n\nInstructions on how to use Full Moon Dip®.\n\nAnd maybe some stories about happy farm animals.\n\nReady?\n\nMore (Home-Grown) Good Face Days\n\nAnd we're thankful you're taking this journey with us.\n\nFrom small-town Texas, to the celebrity-filled hills of LA, to being featured in the highest-rated luxury spas and cosmopolitan hotels of Dubai, Three Milk Ageless Moisturizer has grown to become THE #1 fan favorite—beating out 240+ other products thanks to its home-grown formulation of 3 nourishing botanical milks.\n\nYou have our attention and our gratitude for making it a perennial best-seller.\n\nAnd if you're like most of our customers, we realize that you went through dozens of different moisturizers before discovering Three Milk. Our heart is full as it's become a must-have staple in morning and nighttime routines, a timeless go-to that works effortlessly in varied conditions — with makeup, under your sunblock, or in tandem with favorite powders — all without the unflattering shine.\n\nNo Filter\n\nNo redness. No shine. Just a reduction in wrinkles from your nose to mouth, around the eyes, and across the forehead.\n\nThis luxurious ageless moisturizer uniquely combines the revitalizing effects of three of nature's most calming and purifying milks: coconut milk, milk thistle, and milk vetch.\n\nThese nourishing botanicals work in unison with our clinical, advanced peptides to dramatically reduce the appearance of deep lines and wrinkles while providing an almost immediate feeling of a lift. It's like an instant glow-up (that just keeps going).\n\nIn short, Three Milk brings you the luxury spa experience we're famous for—your home.\n\nBut like so many of our other customers, you've likely tried dozens of options before without positive results. What could possibly make Three Milk different?\n\nPrecision (and Persistence)\n\nThere's a craft to product development; and new product development takes years of research, dedication, and testing.\n\nOne of our biggest hurdles with Three Milk was trying to reduce the amount of glycerin you're exposed to vs. other skincare products people rely on.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with glycerin, but too much of it can make the final product unreliable with certain skin types.\n\nWe wanted Three Milk to work for you no matter your skin type or tolerance for glycerin.\n\nSo we minimized the glycerin and maximized the ceramides—a far better option, especially for those looking to reduce the appearance of deep lines and wrinkles.\n\nCeramides naturally occur in the skin and serve as the binder that holds our skin together. But as we age, our naturally-occurring ceramides diminish.\n\nThis is why we knew ceramides were the better choice for you.\n\nCompared to glycerin, they're more expensive for us to include in Three Milk, but for better skin we insisted on a precision selection of only the best ingredients and botanicals.\n\nIt took almost 15 different formulations, and thousands of hours of testing on the spa table with our expert estheticians and massage therapists who have a combined 128 years of experience in the industry. They tested Three Milk after steaming the face, adding oils, mixing it with other products, putting it on before makeup, and after using a booster.\n\nWe didn't stop until we had a formula that worked in all of these conditions.\n\nFarmHouse Fresh has been voted among the top 3 spa brands by American Spa Magazine for 12 years in a row.\n\n(Neighborhood) Local\n\nWe're not just grown in the US — we're grown here on our Texas farm. Our ingredients are as fresh as fresh can get.\n\nWe are committed to sustainability and keeping our supply chain as close to Texas as possible. And when we do have to source beyond the neighborhood, we've partnered to feature ingredients, caps, glass bottles, and more from “made in USA” suppliers, farmers, and manufacturers in our vicinity.\n\nBottomline: Your ingredients are inherently fresher and more nutrient rich vs. others that have to travel across oceans and through shipping ports while sitting in containers for 70+ days.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? You get our best, richest vitamins at their peak for your most natural, enduring glow-up.\n\nNo Empty Promises Here\n\nWe're not happy unless you're happy. If you don't love Three Milk, we'll gladly refund the full purchase price if returned within 30 days of the original purchase date.\n\nYour Personal Taste of Hollywood\n\nEach FarmHouse Fresh product was specially formulated using up to 100% natural ingredients and botanicals to give you the power to unlock the best version of yourself.\n\nHalf our team is made of expert, licensed estheticians and massage therapists with over 128 years of combined experience. It often takes up to 2 years and 17 18 19 different formulations to develop a single cleanser, moisturizer, exfoliator, or other skincare product.\n\nWe consider every possible ingredient and discard anything that doesn't deliver results the right way: with natural botanical extracts and ingredients grown and sourced within the US.\n\nNo filler ingredients. No cruel animal testing. No empty promises.\n\nThis commitment to expertise and quality ingredients is what makes us a favorite amongst the stars of Hollywood and others in the entertainment industry.\n\nTheir faces are shown everywhere, blown up 100x on billboards, movie screens, and buildings in Times Square where every single pore and wrinkle can be closely examined.\n\nFor them, high quality skincare products are not a want, but an absolute necessity.\n\nLisa Kudrow glows with FarmHouse Fresh's Moon Dip for the Friends reunion.\n\n“To give Lisa's skin that healthy glow that can only come from sheer hydration, I prepped her face with FarmHouse Fresh's Moon Dip Facial Mousse. The perfect kiss of moisturizer that never feels heavy or interferes with makeup.”\n\n- Brett Freedman, Celebrity Makeup Artist\n\nBefore Reba McEntire hosted the 53rd Annuals Country Music Association Awards, the country icon got her glow on with FarmHouse Fresh!\n\nMarlee Matlin, who stars in the 2022 Best Picture-winning film CODA, was prepped for Hollywood's biggest night by celebrity makeup artist Brett Freedman, who whipped out his favorite FarmHouse Fresh all-stars for the evening.\n\nBut our products are not only for them.\n\nOur vision from the very beginning was to put the revitalizing power of natural and potent ingredients in the hands of anyone who wanted it. It doesn't matter if you have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame or if you're going downtown to catch up with friends or if you're taking your kids to soccer practice.\n\nWe all deserve to share our beauty with the world.\n\nIngredients Grown & Sourced in the USA\n\nOur goal is to give customers the highest quality money can buy so we can save as many animals as possible at our FHF Sanctuary.\n\nTo date, we've rescued forgotten, neglected and abused farm animals. But that's only made possible by customers like you.\n\nIn order to ensure the highest quality, we need to oversee as much of the process as possible, from seed to bottle.\n\nThat means growing our own ingredients at our Texas farm. When we need an ingredient that we can't possibly grow due to the Texas climate, we still make sure to source it from another farm in the US.\n\nWe feel it's our moral responsibility to support our home. For your skin health, for American jobs, and for the animals we save each year.\n\nWhile it costs us more to do each step in the US, we think the quality and impact make it worth it.\n\nIf we could go back in time and start over again, we wouldn't change a single thing about how we source ingredients.\n\nWe're Not Happy Unless You're Happy\n\nIf you don't love your purchase, we'll gladly refund the full price if returned within 30 days of the original purchase date. And yes, you can actually use the product before returning it! (We're not sure why some brands don't let their customers actually try their products before returning them.)\n\nWe're not just grown in the US — we're grown here on our farm\n\nOur ingredients are as fresh as fresh can get.\n\nIf the option to grow an ingredient on our own farm or to source it from within the US is possible, then that's exactly what we choose to do.\n\nWe are committed to sustainability and keeping our supply chain as close to Texas as possible.\n\nYears ago we drew a line across a map of the U.S. and made a concerted effort to source as many ingredients, caps, glass bottles, and more from “made in the USA” suppliers, farmers, and manufacturers in states closest to Texas.\n\nKeeping the supply chain tight and close to our chest reduces carbon emissions and helps ensure the quality of ingredients, including the nutrients within them.\n\nThe ingredients in our commercial greenhouse are grown fresh and harvested every 7 days. Our US suppliers are similar, harvesting and creating their ingredients and delivering them fresh.\n\nThe secret to providing products (like Three Milk) that do exactly as they're advertised is to grow as many ingredients as possible ourselves, and to source everything else from local farms and suppliers.\n\nThis means our ingredients are inherently fresher and more nutrient rich than ingredients that have to travel across oceans and through shipping ports while sitting in containers for 70+ days.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nYou get only the best, richest vitamins at their peak."
