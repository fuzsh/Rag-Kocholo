        "text": "My book reflections May 2024 have a common theme: Second Chances, infused with a lot of magic, alternate universes and realities.\n\nI‚Äôm in love‚Ä¶with all the books I‚Äôve read in May because they have opened me up to other worlds and moved me in ways I haven‚Äôt expected.\n\nMy dear friend Fiona, aka Fee, said it so perfectly: I ‚Äúlove how with novels it‚Äôs like we are swept up into a new world, but also the characters travel with us, like friends sitting down with me for a picnic.‚Äù\n\nAnd I want to quote January Andrews, the main character in Beach Read by Emily Henry:\n\n‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the thing about writing Happily Ever Afters: it helps if you believe in them.‚Äù\n\nJUST FOR THE SUMMER by Abby Jimenez\n\n(first published: April 2, 2024; Publisher: Forever; 432 pages, Paperback; Book series: Part of Your World #3)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n(read book: May 4, 2024)\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this novel gets multiple of awards. It‚Äôs a masterpiece!\n\nThe moment I started reading it I was hooked. I especially loved the alternating perspectives between the two main characters, Emma and Justin, it just made it so much more engaging.\n\n‚ÄúJust for the Summer‚Äù is the third novel of the trilogy ‚ÄúPart of Your World‚Äù by Abby Jimenez. The series begins with ‚ÄúPart of Your World‚Äù as the first book, followed by ‚ÄúYours Truly‚Äù as the second.\n\nEmma and Justin & Their Fake Relationship\n\nJustin thinks he‚Äôs cursed because each woman he dates miraculously finds her soul mate right after they part ways. He must be so fed up with it that he somehow feels the need to make this public and publishes a very funny post on Reddit where it soon goes viral.\n\nEmma, a traveling nurse, reads his post and can‚Äôt help but identify so much with Justin, despite it being such a funny story.\n\nShe‚Äôs experiencing the same dilemma as all the people she‚Äôs dating somehow end up with their perfect match after they split.\n\nEmma finds Justin‚Äôs story quite intriguing and his humor quite attractive, and with a little push from her best friend she messages him on Reddit.\n\nAnd‚Ä¶he responds.\n\nAnd they hit it off right from the start ‚Äì as allies‚Ä¶\n\nThey devise a plan: to date, break up, and nullify each other‚Äôs curses.\n\nBrilliant idea. If they only knew ‚Ä¶ This wild idea just might have a chance of succeeding but maybe not in a way they anticipate.\n\nBeing so intrigued, Emma, unexpectedly assigns as a traveling nurse in Minnesota, and seizes the opportunity to fake-date Justin, and with her best friend, she rents a charming cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka.\n\nJustin and Emma make it clear from the very start that this is about to last just for the summer.\n\nWell, again if they only knew!\n\nAs the summer days stretch out, Emma and Justin find themselves growing closer, the lines between their fake relationship and real emotions blurring more each day.\n\nJustin, who is used to being the perpetual stepping stone for others‚Äô happiness, begins to see a future where he isn‚Äôt just a footnote in someone else‚Äôs love story. Emma, on the other hand, starts envisioning a life that isn‚Äôt overshadowed by her mother‚Äôs toxic presence. They both realize that for the first time in a long while, they aren‚Äôt just surviving‚Äîthey are living.\n\nThe Trope of a Faked Relationship\n\nThe trope of fake relationships is a bit overused in my opinion. I see it so often; and it‚Äôs interesting why it attracts so many readers, including myself. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I myself love it too. But I wonder why there‚Äôs such a hype around it. Perhaps it‚Äôs the allure of seeing two characters navigate the complexities of pretending to be in love, only to discover real feelings along the way.\n\nI can see how this trope often brings a mix of humor, tension, and heartfelt moments, making it a rollercoaster of emotions that many readers find irresistible. Additionally, fake relationships often provide a safe space for characters to confront their fears and insecurities, leading them to personal growth and deeper connections. I can imagine it‚Äôs a narrative that resonates with the hope that love can blossom in the most unexpected places.\n\nAnd that feels good, right? Because it offers a comforting sense of predictability and the promise of a happy ending. And who doesn‚Äôt want that?! There‚Äôs something very soothing about it.\n\nBut that‚Äôs just my personal take on the trope of fake relationships. üòâ\n\nAnd in Just For The Summer Jimenez takes the fake relationship trope to a whole different and exciting level.\n\nThe Characters & the Setting\n\nEach chapter revealed new layers to their personalities and motivations, drawing me deeper into their world. And that‚Äôs exactly what makes an author a good author.\n\nEmma‚Äôs resilience and determination shone brightly, while Justin‚Äôs introspective nature offered a subtle counterbalance, adding depth to their (fake) relationship.\n\nI often times wanted to shake Emma and scream at her to f***ing let down her guards and stop being so annoyingly stubborn and rigid.\n\nI got sometimes so frustrated with her character to be honest, but I think that is what made the story so much richer and captivating, and so involving.\n\nBut I also felt so much for her and my heart was breaking for her every single time her toxic mother came into the scene.\n\nI love Abby Jimenez‚Äôs depiction of Emma‚Äôs connection with her mother. Through Emma‚Äôs character, the novel explores how her mother‚Äôs past actions have influenced and molded her. Tragically so.\n\nThe reader gains a deep understanding of Emma‚Äôs guarded nature, and her reluctance to let others in except for her best friend. It highlights the profound impact of childhood trauma on someone with such narcissistic and toxic parents, and how it leads them to sabotage relationships and their overall well-being in their adult life. The portrayal of how she‚Äôs always out for an escape as soon things get too intimate is striking.\n\nEmma‚Äôs and Justin‚Äôs interactions were both touching and realistic, and became even more interesting as they grew closer together; filled with moments of tenderness, conflict, and growth. A lot of growth!\n\nThe setting of the story added another layer of richness, with vivid descriptions of their surroundings that made the scenes come alive. Whether it was a bustling cityscape or a serene countryside (island life), I felt like I was right there with them, experiencing every moment. I want to travel there.\n\nThe plot twists were cleverly woven into the narrative, keeping me on the edge of my seat (or couch üòâ) and eager to find out what would happen next. The Jimenez‚Äôs skillful use of foreshadowing and suspense ensured that each revelation was both surprising and satisfying, making the story an unforgettable journey. And trust me, I was laughing, sobbing, and ugly crying throughout the entire book.\n\nBy the time I reached the final page, I felt a deep connection to Emma and Justin, as if they were old friends. And I experienced so much emotional release and relief, it‚Äôs almost unreal.\n\nTheir journey of self-discovery, love, and resilience left a lasting impact on me, and the themes explored in the story resonated long after I had finished reading.\n\nJust For The Summer was not just a fleeting escape but a truly profound experience that touched my heart and mind in ways that I can‚Äôt even fathom; and it healed certain aspects of myself because I was exploring deep seeded emotions within myself. Sometimes we‚Äôre not aware of what we‚Äôre not aware of. üòâ\n\nI look forward to reading more from Abby Jimenez, because now I got hooked. She‚Äôs got a remarkable gift for storytelling and character development. Absolutely admiring!\n\nAbout Abby Jimenez\n\n‚ÄúAbby Jimenez is a New York Times bestselling author and Food Network champion living in Minnesota.

Abby loves a good romance, coffee, doglets, and not leaving the house.‚Äù (Source: Abby Jimenez‚Äôs Website)\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book\n\n‚ÄúIn a world where you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot everything that comes out of crisis is bad. Sometimes your traumas are the reason you know how to help.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUnhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don‚Äôt know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks.\n\nBeing broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe home isn‚Äôt a place. Maybe it‚Äôs a person.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause when you‚Äôre in love, you do hard things.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just that they weren‚Äôt you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTo me, love meant you stayed. But now I understood that love sometimes means you let someone go.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSometimes the best way to show love or be kind to someone is to meet them where they are.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou are not what happened to you. You are what you do next.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúUnhealed trauma is a crack. And all the little hard things that trickle into it that would have rolled off someone else, settle. Then when life gets cold, that crack gets bigger, longer, deeper. It makes new breaks. You don‚Äôt know how broken she was or what she was trying to do to fill those cracks. Being broken is not an excuse for bad behavior, you still have to make good choices and do the right thing. But it can be the reason. And sometimes understanding the reason can be what helps you heal.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNot everything that comes out of crisis is bad. Sometimes your traumas are the reason you know how to help.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe home isn‚Äôt a place. Maybe it‚Äôs a person.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting my whole life to feel like this and I thought it was a curse that nobody else ever worked out. But it wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just that they weren‚Äôt you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to forgive her. You really don‚Äôt. You can still love someone that you‚Äôve decided not to speak to anymore. You can still wish them well and hope for the best for them. Choosing a life without them doesn‚Äôt mean you stop caring about them.\n\nIt just means that you can‚Äôt allow them to harm you anymore. But if you don‚Äôt think your life would be better without them in it, then accept that they have cracks. Try to understand how they got them and help fill them with something that isn‚Äôt ice.‚Äù She peered at me. ‚ÄúIf you can choose anger or empathy, always choose empathy, Justin. It‚Äôs so much healthier than anger. For both of you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe do not go out of our way for men. We do not inconvenience ourselves for men, we do not change our well-laid plans for men.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI think you went through something horrible and that‚Äôs who you needed to become to get through it.‚Äù\n\nHOW TO END A LOVE STORY by Yulin Kuang\n\n(first published: April 9, 2024; Publisher: Hodder Paperbacks; Pages: 384, Paperback;\n\na Reese‚Äôs Book Club Pick: May 2024)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n(read book: May 7, 2024)\n\nWhat can I say? ‚Äì This one was a total surprise in the best way possible! How To End A Love Story has quickly become one of my top romance reads this year. Trusting my instincts pays off!!!\n\nBack in April, I stumbled upon How To End A Love Story in the bookstore, feeling really drawn to it; I flirted with the idea of reading it but then opted for other books instead. However, when Reese Witherspoon revealed it as the book of the month for May 2024, I took it as a sign. And I have no regrets! AT ALL! I absolutely adored this book ‚Äì it captured my heart completely! Like wholly and fully! It‚Äôs a Love Story!\n\nHelen and Grant ‚Äì When the Present outweighs the Past\n\nHelen Zhang and Grant Shepard have not crossed paths in thirteen years since a tragic event forever linked their lives.\n\nShe‚Äôs a successful author who dedicates herself to her work, and with her popular young adult novels being up for a TV adaption, she travels to L.A. to be part of the writers‚Äô room for the TV adaptation. If she can conquer her impostor syndrome and overcome her writer‚Äôs block, she believes her life will fall into place. Los Angeles offers her the fresh start she craves, where she can remain anonymous. However, there‚Äôs one exception‚Ä¶\n\nGrant, a screenwriter, is part of the writer‚Äôs room. After all those years they meet.\n\nAlthough he knows working on Helen‚Äôs show may not be the best idea, the opportunity to advance his own projects is too tempting to resist.\n\nAnd this is where both of them get the chance to start writing a new story. Their story!\n\nAs time goes by, more and more details and secrets are being revealed.\n\nWill Helen let her walls down and will she let Grant in?\n\nDo they both take the opportunity and overcome their shared past, giving them a second chance?\n\nImportant to know: This book addresses the subject of suicide.\n\nIntroducing Yulin Kuang\n\n‚ÄúYulin Kuang is a screenwriter and director, whose credits include The CW‚Äôs I Ship It and Hulu‚Äôs Dollface. She was once fired from a Hallmark movie for being ‚Äòtoo hip for Hallmark‚Äô and is the adapting screenwriter of Emily Henry‚Äôs People We Meet On Vacation, as well as the writer/director of the forthcoming Beach Read film for 20th Century Studios. Yulin‚Äôs own debut novel, How to End a Love Story, has been featured on Vogue, Elle, People Magazine, NPR, and more.\n\nShe is a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University, and is repped by UTA, Kaplan/Perrone, and Root Literary.‚Äù\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book\n\n‚ÄúShe‚Äôs made only the barest of attempts at dating in L.A.‚Äì‚Äìfrankly she finds the game of swiping and messaging and flirting to be somehow both tedious and embarrassing. There shouldn‚Äôt be a written record of her rough-draft attempts at dating.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be completely healed to be everything I want. To be mine. I want every part of you, you silly infuriating woman. I love the parts of you I haven‚Äôt even met yet.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my favorite thing to look at in the room.‚Äú‚Äù\n\n‚Äú[‚Ä¶] it‚Äôs ridiculous, the buzzing thrill that shoots through her when she sees his name on the screen.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe keeps drawing a slow circle around her ankle bone, unwilling to break contact completely‚Äì‚Äìhe feels like he‚Äôs just started a new favorite book and he can‚Äôt put it down or he‚Äôll lose his place.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou could keep me your dirty little secret, come to me tasting like other men, I‚Äôd still take you back every fucking time,‚Äù he says, a muscle ticking violently in his jaw. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have a fraction of you than all of someone else.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚ÄúSometimes I miss you when you‚Äôre right in front of me.‚Äù she says as he nudges her cheek with is nose. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that weird?‚Äú‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúHe takes a step forward and her world seems to tilt on its axis. ‚ÄùI want all of it this time,‚Äù Grant says, his voice harsh and impossibly close. ‚ÄùI want the nights and the days and the weekends and the holidays and I want you at my side and in my bed and in my life. [‚Ä¶] I want to see what kind of person you are when you‚Äôre eighty. I want to do this for real, and I want to call you mine so badly it‚Äôs a fucking joke, but if you can‚Äôt sign up for the whole show this time, then don‚Äôt‚Äì‚Äì‚Äù‚Äù\n\nHONEY & SPICE by Bolu Babalola\n\n(first published: July 5, 2022; Publisher: William Morrow; 448 pages [Paperback];\n\na Reese‚Äôs Book Club Pick: July 2022; British Book Award Nominee for D√©but Fiction 2023)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (3.5)\n\n(read book: May 12, 2024)\n\nMy honest take on it\n\nIf I‚Äôm being completely honest, while the novel was interesting and enjoyable, it didn‚Äôt quite capture my heart. I know, I know, I‚Äôm so sorry to say this but it‚Äôs true.\n\nI had high expectations for it, considering Babalola‚Äôs impressive writing skills. Despite its quality, Honey & Spice didn‚Äôt leave me completely enchanted. Still, I enjoyed it.\n\nBut as I delved into the book, I found myself wondering if it fell into the young adult (YA) fiction category. To my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt classified as such. At 39 years old, I do indulge in YA fiction occasionally, like Check & Mate by Ali Hazelwood. However, the dialogue in Honey & Spice didn‚Äôt really resonate with me.\n\nThe dialogue‚Äôs pace sometimes threw me off, and the abundance of youthful drama didn‚Äôt align with my current interests; I‚Äôm actually pretty much over that kind of stuff. And that is what made it challenging for me to fully immerse myself in the story, especially since I‚Äôve outgrown that phase. It still puzzles me that the book wasn‚Äôt categorized as YA.\n\nFeeling a bit disappointed, I found myself checking how many pages remained, a clear sign that the novel didn‚Äôt fully engage me. With 448 pages, the plot felt prolonged for my taste. But, of course, this is just my personal take on it; and there were chapters that I actually did pretty much enjoy.\n\nI, however, truly appreciated the smart and lively pace. Kiki‚Äôs humor and candidness resonated with me, making the reading experience quite delightful. You can see that I‚Äôm a bit conflicted because again it was a good read, don‚Äôt get me wrong.\n\nAnd I again must commend Babalola‚Äôs exceptional writing skills; there‚Äôs a captivating passion and energy, a certain drive and thirst, in the way she crafts her storylines that leaves me eager to explore more of her writing. I‚Äôm quite excited to check out Love in Colour.\n\nThe Plot\n\nThis novel follows the story of Kiki Banjo, a young Black British woman, who, despite her disinterest in love, finds herself entangled in a fake relationship with Malakai Korede, the man she cautioned her her radio show audience about.\n\nKiki is known for her sharp tongue and hidden soft side. She faces a significant blunder. Despite her expertise in avoiding relationships and hosting the popular student radio show Brown Sugar, she accidentally kisses Malakai Korede, the man she publicly criticized as ‚ÄúThe Wastemen of Whitewell,‚Äù putting her show in jeopardy.\n\nTo salvage their reputations and futures, they concoct a fake relationship. Kiki, who has never let anyone into her heart, remains adamant against Malakai‚Äôs charms and their undeniable chemistry. However, as they share study sessions and heartfelt conversations at diners, Kiki begins to question her assumptions.\n\nWill Kiki be willing to explore deeper emotions and let her guard down?\n\nFemale Friendships under the Microscope\n\nWhat I truly adore about Honey & Spice is not only the romantic relationship that is unfolding between Kiki and Malakai with all its twists and turns, but it also delves into Kiki‚Äôs relationships with other women, showing how her past traumas and hurts have made her hesitant to form close bonds, except for her friendship with Aminah. Throughout the narrative, Kiki discovers how to set aside her preconceptions about other women and takes a chance on forming connections with them.\n\nKiki begins to see the power of sisterhood and how it can empower her to heal and grow. The novel paints a poignant picture of resilience and the importance of building meaningful relationships beyond romantic love; something that I really appreciate.\n\nHoney & Spice invites us to reflect on our own connections with others and the beauty that can blossom when walls are broken down and hearts are opened; it teaches us about the power of forgiveness and reconciliation.\n\nAbout the Bolu Babalola\n\nHoney & Spice was Babalola‚Äôs debut novel. She ‚Äúis the author of the Sunday Times best-selling and Waterstones Book of the Year shortlisted collection Love In Colour,‚Äù which was published in 2020. ‚ÄúIn 2016, she was shortlisted in the 4th Estate‚Äôs B4ME competition for her short story Netflix & Chill and she has worked as a writer for books, TV, press and as a cultural commentator.‚Äù\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book\n\n‚ÄúKiki, it‚Äôs not arrogant to know what you‚Äôre good at. It‚Äôs arrogant to think you don‚Äôt need to grow.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only guy that‚Äôs ever held my hand without the intention of getting something from me. You just hold my hand to hold it. To hold me. Like you like doing it or something.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhat if the butterflies flew too close to the edge of my stomach, so he could see the imprints of their wings pressed up against my skin?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùOur breathing became even more erratic, Malakai‚Äôs eyes a hypnotic blackhole that held my deepest, most desperate desires. His touch made a home in me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùI missed the fact that I felt like I had my own personal sun when he looked at me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùAnd I figured ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs why people do it, right? Be vulnerable and shit. Because they want to be close to the person who makes it worth it. It‚Äôs about connecting with someone who makes you want to try. And she made ‚Äì‚Äì makes me want to try.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùThere‚Äôs a whole universe in her and I would be so lucky to live in it, explore it. Over and over.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùThat‚Äôs how I feel when I look at her. She‚Äôs the perfect shot. And the perfect shot isn‚Äôt about something being flawless, it‚Äôs about the truth to me. Clarity. The world is doable when she is near me.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄùHis heat melted into my heat and created an alchemy that metamorphosed the butterflies into a bird of paradise, and I was taking flight with it. This kiss, this this, this us, tasted like indulgence and sustenance. Our tongues moved like we were each other‚Äôs rice and wine, twirled with the ease of drunken, fed hips. In the kiss, I tasted him and I tasted me and I tasted what we were and what we could be. It tasted like hones and spice, twined.‚Äù\n\nBEACH READ by Emily Henry\n\n(first published: May 19, 2020; Publisher: Penguin; 368 pages [Paperback];\n\nranked second place with 60,124 votes in the Romance category at the Goodreads Choice Award 2020)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (4.7)\n\n(read book: May 17, 2024)\n\nTwo Writers, One Summer, One Romance\n\n(little spoilers included üòâ)\n\nJanuary Andrews is a renowned romance writer who has lost faith in love, which is quite tricky when your job depends on writing happy ending love stories.\n\nAs the deadline for her new book manuscript approaches, January finds herself yet to begin writing.\n\nWhen January arrives at her father‚Äôs beach house which she has inherited, she‚Äôs being confronted with her unprocessed grief, feelings of betrayal, and an old nemesis from college as her neighbor.\n\nAugustus Everett is an esteemed literary author who grapples with a creative block.\n\nDespite their differences, the two writers share a predicament: they are both struggling with writer‚Äôs block, living as neighbors in beach houses, and facing financial difficulties.\n\nAs the summer unfolds, January and Augustus dive headfirst into their unconventional experiment. Augustus will attempt to write something uplifting, while January will tackle the task of crafting the next Great American Novel.\n\nJanuary takes Augustus to a series of whimsical dates designed to ignite his sense of romance and wonder. Meanwhile, Augustus immerses January in his world of gritty realism.\n\nAs they navigate their respective challenges, January and Augustus find themselves opening up to each other in unexpected ways. Late-night writing sessions turn into heartfelt conversations about their pasts, their fears, and their dreams. The lines between their professional collaboration and personal connection blur, and the tension between their growing attraction and their professional pact adds a layer of complexity to their journey.\n\nIn their quest to conquer writer‚Äôs block, January and Augustus not only rediscover their passion for storytelling but also learn that sometimes, the most unexpected collaborations can lead to the most profound transformations. As the summer days come to an end, they are faced with the ultimate question: can they achieve their creative goals without losing their hearts in the process?\n\nPersonal Note\n\nTo be quite frank ‚Äì‚Äì and I have to say it ‚Äì‚Äì I found the excessive alcohol consumption by the main characters quite disconcerting after a while. It seemed as if they both have some issues with alcohol and could have benefited from therapy. I questioned the necessity of portraying them drinking so much, as there could have been alternative approaches.\n\nBut maybe that was all part of the story. But to me it felt off. This aspect influenced my decision not to give Beach Read a full 5-star rating, as it felt like the promotion of drinking so much alcohol and making it seem okay was unnecessary in my opinion.\n\nA beautiful Romance\n\n(a little spoiler ahead üòâ)\n\nNevertheless, I adored the development of the love story between ‚ÄòGus‚Äô and January. The plot twist where January learns to love again while dealing with grief and forgiving her father was particularly captivating, and made me sob like big time.\n\nThe letters will pull the strings of your heart, too, I‚Äôm sure of it!\n\nEmily Henry is the #1 New York Times best-selling author of Beach Read, You and Me on Vacation (People We Meet on Vacation),Book Lovers, Happy Place, and Funny Story.\n\nBeach Read as well as Book Lovers will be adapted into a movie by Yulin Kuang. I cannot wait for that. It‚Äôs promising, since I love both Henry, the author, and Kuang, the screenwriter and author. A match made in heaven, I‚Äôd say. It can‚Äôt be anything but exceptionally fantastic.\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book\n\n‚ÄúIf you think the story has a sad ending, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not over yet.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou know that feeling, when you‚Äôre watching someone sleep and you feel overwhelmed with joy that they exist?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the key to marriage. You have to keep falling in love with every new version of each other, and it‚Äôs the best feeling in the whole world.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSometimes life is very hard. Sometimes it demands so much of you that you start losing pieces of yourself as you stretch out to give what the world wants to take.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThat is how life feels too often. Like you‚Äôre doing everything you can to survive only to be sabotaged by something beyond your control, maybe even some darker part of yourself.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúGus touched the side of my face. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need snowflakes.‚Äù He kissed me. ‚ÄúAs long as I have January.‚Äù\n\nTHE SEVEN YEAR SLIP by Ashley Poston\n\n(first published: June 27, 2023; Publisher: Berkley; 352 pages, Paperback;\n\nranked 9th with 30,820 votes in the Romance category at the 2023 Goodreads Choice Awards)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n(read book: May 19, 2024)\n\nIn my honest opinion, this should have been the winner of the Goodreads Choice Award in the category Romance and Fiction. It‚Äôs been one of my favorite reads. I want to give it more than five stars for the romance, the magic, and for the celebration of and love for delicious food. AND: I love the lemon theme that is woven into the story.\n\nYes, the other ones are absolutely amazing and they, too, deserve to be the award winner, but this novel, I don‚Äôt know, was something else. It‚Äôs a must read for everyone who believes in love and in the mystical. I love romance paired with magical realism. I find these novels most enchanting and captivating.\n\nI want to tell you something; it has nothing to do with the book, well, it kind of does. Ever since I was a child I‚Äôve been fascinated by the concept of time and how time can bend. I have had some very surreal experiences myself where I seemed to be in alternate timelines. As children, we are more open to those possibilities; we‚Äôre still more connected to source, and less infiltrated by the 3-D human experience.\n\nAnd I think that‚Äôs why I love this novel so much. It reminds me of the magic that exists when we look beyond the veil of our programmed perception.\n\nI simply flew over the pages of the book. It deeply resonated with me.\n\nIt touched a deeper part of me that has been so thirsty for magick, for the mystical. I‚Äôm so glad I trusted my intuition at the bookstore when the cover of this book drew me into its realm.\n\nBooks really do speak.\n\nLove that conquers Time and Space.\n\nClementine West falls in love with a man that lives seven years in the past.\n\nThe apartment she inherited from her beloved aunt is not an ordinary apartment. Her aunt used to share captivating stories and memories associated with this special place. But now, with that stranger from the past in her kitchen, Clementine is beginning to believe that those stories were indeed true. How can that be?\n\nIwan, an aspiring chef, and Clementine, or as he lovingly calls her Lemon, begin to form an unusual friendship over delectable lemon pie and other tasty dishes that Iwan cooks for them. Their connection deepens, leading to them falling in love. But soon this new development starts to unsettle Clementine, causing her to reevaluate her career and life goals.\n\nShe had guarded her heart from potential pain for years, not letting any man into her heart; she diligently pursued her career, convinced that it was what she desired. But now, with Iwan‚Äôs presence in her life, everything she once thought she desired is now under scrutiny. His presence brings a warmth that she hadn‚Äôt realized was missing, and his laughter fills the empty spaces in her heart. The more time they spend together, the more she realizes that her career, while fulfilling, isn‚Äôt the entirety of who she is or what she needs.\n\nIn matters of the heart, timing outweighs time itself. It‚Äôs a novel about magic, love, and second chances!\n\nJumping between the Present and the Past\n\nI love how the chapters transition between the present and seven years in the past, gradually unveiling intricate details that add to the allure of the story. It‚Äôs a smart structure that keeps the reader engaged as the puzzle pieces are slowly coming together, with some expected and unexpected twists and turns.\n\nPersonally, I was completely spellbound by this book. I found it impossible to stop reading; my emotions were running high as I cried and laughed my way through it. It‚Äôs a deeply touching love story that will tug at your heartstrings in a significant way.\n\nPlease, read this book! And thank me later. üòâ\n\nAbout Ashley Poston\n\nAshley Poston is a #1 New York Times and USA Today best-selling novelist of The Dead Romantics, The Seven Year Slip, and her new book A Novel Love Story coming out in June 2024.\n\n‚ÄúHer young adult novels have been nominated for the Indie Next List, the Goodreads Choice Awards, and have been featured in countless articles and recommended reading lists.\n\nWhen not writing, she likes to go on adventures with her three cats‚ÄîMoose, Muppet, and Beanie, tend to her perpetually-dying flower garden, and play tabletop games. She lives in a small grey house in South Carolina with too many pothos plants and never enough coffee.‚Äù\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book.\n\n‚ÄúNothing lasts forever. Not the good things, not the bad. So just find what makes you happy, and do it for as long as you can.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou never commit a mundane moment to memory, thinking it‚Äôll be the last time you‚Äôll hear their voice, or see their smile, or smell their perfume. Your head never remembers the things your heart wants to in hindsight.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòNo, no, it‚Äôs fine. You asked what makes a meal perfect. It‚Äôs this. Food‚Äô‚Äì‚Äìhe mentioned to our almost empty plates‚Äì‚Äì‚ÄôIt‚Äôs a work of art. That‚Äôs what a perfect meal is‚Äì‚Äìsomething you don‚Äôt just eat, but something you enjoy. With friends, and family‚Äì‚Äìmaybe even with strangers. It‚Äôs an experience. You taste it, you savor it, you feel the story told through the intricate flavors that play out across your tongue ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs magical. Romantic.'‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou can say things with food that you can‚Äôt quite with words sometimes.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúRomance wasn‚Äôt in chocolate, it was in the gap of breath as we came up for air. It was in the way a cradled my face, the way I traced my finger over the crescent-shaped birthmark on his collarbone. It was in the way he muttered how beautiful I was, the way it made my heart soar. It was in the way I wanted to know everything about him‚Äì‚Äìhis favorite songs, finally guess his favorite color.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it strange how the world works sometimes? It‚Äôs never a matter of time, but a matter of timing.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou are who you are, and you like what you like. You are you, and that‚Äôs a lovely person to be.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt find out who I wanted to be until I was almost 40. You have to try on a lot of shoes until you find some you like walking in. Never apologize for that.‚Äù\n\nMEET ME AT THE LAKE by Carley Fortune\n\n(First published May 2, 2023; Publisher: Viking; 336 pages, Paperback;\n\nNominee of the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Romance 2023)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n(read book: May 23, 2024)\n\nMy heart! Oh yes, kayaks, Canada, lodges, and romance, plus the love for food! Definitely my type of novel. And yes, books speak wth another, I‚Äôm sure of it. Because how is it possible that this book also makes the lemon theme an important aspect of the narrative, such as in ‚ÄòThe Seven Year Slip‚Äô? Like for real!\n\nThis was such an amazing, heart-wrenching, captivating read; it made me flow over the pages in no time, totally captivated by the magic Carley Fortune created. I was deeply engaged in the story and rooting for the main characters. Second chances vibes in this one!\n\nSometimes people just meet at the wrong time, or let me put it differently: they were meant to meet to enter each other‚Äôs lives and plant the seeds for what‚Äôs about to come only many years later in the future. But of course they don‚Äôt know it.\n\nLove is not enough in a relationship.\n\nPeople meet, and they fall in love, they have that inexplicable connection where everything appears flawless, but yet sometimes there are significant discrepancies: personal dilemmas, job changes leading to relocation, commitment fears, or personal insecurities hindering trust. Timing plays a crucial role as well.\n\nThere are all sorts of reasons why people who seem to be meant for each other don‚Äôt work out.\n\nI love how the concept of timing that we explored in ‚ÄúThe Seven Year Slip,‚Äù resurfaces in this novel, only slightly different and not through a magical time-travel apartment.\n\nTime matters, and the right place matters, too.\n\nThe Love Story of Fern Brookbanks and Will Baxter\n\nTen years ago in Toronto, Fern, who was working at a coffeeshop at the time, met artist Will. Will, the same age as Fern, was completing a mural for the coffeeshop. Finding themselves alone, they began chatting. Instantly hitting it off, they shared dreams and secrets, forming a strong bond. After finishing the painting, Will suggested showing Fern parts of Toronto she hadn‚Äôt seen yet, as she would soon be leaving the city to return to Muskoka. Despite not wanting to leave, Fern had promised her mother she would go back to the family‚Äôs resort to work and had a boyfriend waiting for her there.\n\nFern and Will spent a memorable day together; forming a unique connection and falling in love. They planned to reunite at the Muskoka lake after a year, but Will never showed up, leaving Fern heartbroken for years.\n\nNow at thirty-two, 10 years later after they first met, Fern‚Äôs reality is far from what she had envisioned. Instead of city life, she finds herself back at her mother‚Äôs Muskoka lakeside resort, a role she had sworn to avoid. The resort is in disarray, managed by her ex-boyfriend, leaving Fern feeling lost; and also in deep grief over her mother who was killed in a car accident 6 weeks ago.\n\nIn need of a lifeline, Fern is surprised when Will reappears after all those years, offering his help and support. Will‚Äôs arrival brings a sense of familiarity, yet Fern struggles to trust this polished version of the person she once knew. Will is keeping secrets, leaving Fern uncertain about building something new.\n\nWhat is Will hiding? And why didn‚Äôt he show up nine years ago? Do they get a second chance?\n\nYou will find out when you get yourself a copy. Oh, I think Carley Fortune has become one of my favorite authors. I‚Äôm such an admirer of her writing style and how she weaves stories together that stir feelings deep within you.\n\nI‚Äôm so fond of the way the book shifts between the present and June 14, a decade ago, offering the reader a distinctive and vivid portrayal of their love story. Each chapter gradually unveils crucial details that bring it all together, which makes engaging in this narrative so exciting.\n\nJust what my heart needed.

So, despite Lost In Pages being devoted to female writers only, I occasionally make exceptions like this one. And gosh, what can I say?!\n\nI loved it.\n\nNora and the Midnight Library\n\nAfter many ‚Äúattemps‚Äù at doing life, battling clinical depression, grieving the loss of her father, mother, and now cat, and after losing both of her jobs, Nora Seed is done, she decides to end her life.\n\nBut in the space between life and death lies a library known as the Midnight Library. And a transformative journey is on the horizon.\n\nIs there such a thing as a second chance at life?\n\nNora, upon entering this mystical library, is presented with a chance to set things right.\n\nTo her surprise, the familiar face of Mrs Elm, the beloved high school librarian, awaits her. How did she end up here? Mrs Elm seems to have an in-depth knowledge of the endless rows of books in the Midnight Library.\n\nWithin the Midnight Library‚Äôs books, Mrs Elm shows Nora the Book of Regrets where she can see how her life has been overshadowed by sorrow and remorse, feeling she has disappointed everyone, herself included.\n\nNora quickly realizes that this library is no ordinary place. It offers her a chance to explore different paths she could have taken. With the guidance of Mrs Elm, she sets out on a mission to address each regret, striving to achieve her ideal life.\n\nShe tastes her life as a rockstar, an Olympian swimmer, a glaciologist, a married woman‚Ä¶at some point she loses track and the reality kicks in: because things don‚Äôt always align with her visions, leading to unforeseen consequences that endanger both herself and the library.\n\nAs time runs out, Nora is faced with a crucial question: What truly defines a fulfilling existence?\n\nFeeling Lost in Life ‚Äì There‚Äôs Hope\n\nI love how The Midnight Library addresses important topics such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and suicide. There needs to be much, much more open conversation about it. So many people feel lost in their lives, or find themselves battling with anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions; so many feel like a failure, just like Nora does, trying to live up to a certain dream, comparing themselves to others which makes them only feel more miserable.\n\nMore people than we think are right now caught in a downward spiral.\n\nTherefore, it‚Äôs crucial to remind ourselves and others that everyone‚Äôs journey is unique, and that we have these conversations and create more space for people to heal.\n\nI personally think that this book should be part of every school curriculum.\n\nThere needs to be an open dialogue in schools, workplaces, and communities where people can seek help and get the tools and support they need to overcome these challenges. Mental health resources, such as counseling and peer support groups, should be readily accessible for everyone no matter someone‚Äôs income and social status.\n\nAdditionally, sharing stories of overcoming these kinds of life challenges and adversities can inspire and motivate others, creating a ripple effect of positivity, compassion, and understanding.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I recommend this book to everyone. It takes you on a very personal journey through your own regrets (we all have them). It is a wonderful read that opens our eyes and heart; and makes us ponder.\n\n(If you feel lost in your life or you know someone who does, please seek professional help and support.)\n\nThe Chess Analogy\n\nI find the following one of the most powerful analogies in the book; it‚Äôs where Mrs Elm and Nora are about to play chess (they used to play chess all the time in the school library way back then) and how it is a game of infinite possibilities.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòLook at that chessboard we put back in place,‚Äô said Mrs Elm, softly. Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.‚Äô [‚Ä¶]\n\n‚ÄòAt the beginning of a game, there are no variations. There‚Äôs only one way to set up a board. There are nine million variations after the first six moves. And after eight moves there are two hundred and eighty-eight billion different positions. And those possibilities keep growing. There are more possible ways to play a game of chess than the amount of atoms in the observable universe. So it gets very messy. And there is no right way to play; there are many ways. In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.'‚Äù\n\nAbsolutely beautiful, and eye-opening! It puts things, our problems, challenges into perspective, offering a fresh look at life, and our choices in life.\n\nThis is life, it is messy and beautiful all at the same time.\n\nMy heart is still full; and I know I will read it again.\n\nAbout Matt Haig\n\n‚ÄúMatt Haig is the author of novels such as The Midnight Library, How to Stop Time, The Humans, The Radleys, and the forthcoming The Life Impossible. He has also written books for children, such as A Boy Called Christmas, and the memoir Reasons to Stay Alive.‚Äù (Source: goodreads.com)\n\nSome of my favorite Quotes from the Book:\n\n‚ÄúThe only way to learn is to live.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don‚Äôt give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from. That the prison wasn‚Äôt the place, but the perspective.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhen you stay too long in a place, you forget just how big an expanse the world is. You get no sense of the length of those longitudes and latitudes. Just as, she supposed, it is hard to have a sense of the vastness inside any one person. But once you sense that vastness, once something reveals it, hope emerges, whether you want it to or not, and it clings to you as stubbornly as lichen clings to rock.‚Äù\n\nMAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE by Taylor Jenkins Reid\n\n(first published: July 7, 2015; Publisher: Atria Books; 336 pages, Simon and Schuster Paperback)\n\nMy rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\n(read book: May 28, 2024)\n\nAnd as fate would have it, I stumbled upon this fantastic read.\n\nAnd oh wow, I didn‚Äôt expect that! And I love that I didn‚Äôt expect it! What a triumph! I‚Äôm so in love with this novel! Well crafted and truly captivating. Well, I admit that I knew it was about alternate lives, but I was completely surprised by how everything turned out, and how the author managed to bring it all together in a heart-warming way.\n\nI may have said it before: each book I select appears to have a magical link to those I‚Äôve previously read. It‚Äôs almost as if they narrate a distinct story, with each book connected in a way, forming a continuation or progression, like another part of a puzzle, a deeply personal message, only meant for me. I feel like I‚Äôm continuously getting messages from the universe, guiding me, giving me aha-moments, and many insights that come with a lot of tears and laughter.\n\nEach month has a particular theme it seems, guiding me through deeply personal topics, allowing me to heal and work through things, taking me deeper into my inner emotional landscapes. It‚Äôs truly fascinating. I feel like I‚Äôm gaining a deeper understanding of myself with each book I‚Äôm reading.\n\nAnd I always go with my intuition and I don‚Äôt select books based on their excerpts (although I read them), but on a gut feeling that draws me to them. It‚Äôs like these books communicate with each other in a mystical way. And I love the mystical! And I love being guided by a force that seems to be greater than myself. üòâ\n\nHannah & The Alternate Realities\n\nAt 29 years old, Hannah Marie Martin has been living a transient life since leaving college, switching jobs and locations, always feeling kind of lost and adrift. But now at a turning point in her life, and curing her broken heart, she makes the decision to leave NYC and go back to her hometown of Los Angeles, CA, to stay with her best friend Gabby for a while, who lives in a charming townhouse with her husband Mark. While Gabby‚Äôs life appears flawless, Hannah‚Äôs life seems to be in disarray.\n\nBut everything changes the moment she arrives in L.A.:\n\nTo celebrate Hannah‚Äôs first night back in L.A., Gabby organizes a gathering at a local bar, including friends from high school. Hannah even invites her high school ex-boyfriend Ethan to join, just to see where things might go.\n\nAfter a fun evening, Gabby informs Hannah that she‚Äôs leaving with Mark sooner than expected. Ethan, who doesn‚Äôt want Hannah to leave, offers her a ride to Gabby‚Äôs later on if she wants to stay longer. Hannah is torn between leaving with Gabby and Mark or staying with Ethan, unsure of what to do.\n\nAnd this is where the novel splits in two, and this is where it gets really juicy and exciting: Let‚Äôs explore parallel lives! Whoop Whoop!\n\nLife is full of decisions and once a choice is made, it‚Äôs essential to stand by it, learn from it, and move forward, or is it not?\n\nHannah‚Äôs struggle with decision-making makes having two options intriguing. And let‚Äôs be honest who doesn‚Äôt know this decision-making dilemma?\n\nBut which one is she going with?\n\nParallel universes? Why not take the risk and see where it leads?\n\nOh, the reader is in for a treat! It‚Äôs this kind of ‚ÄúSliding Doors‚Äù moment that resonates deeply with me.\n\nIt‚Äôs fascinating and a total reality, not just only a fantasy, as we now know.\n\nSo I hope, if you‚Äôre reading this and you want to invite a bit more magic and wonder into your life, that you consider grabbing yourself a copy of this book.\n\nHow does life unfold when we go in one direction? And how does life unfold when we go in the other direction?\n\nI rooted for both versions of Hannah. And I loved both (positive) endings. We need those hopeful messages, that everything, no matter where it‚Äôll take us somehow always works out, in either way!\n\nIt shows us, as the readers, that there‚Äôs not just one fate, one destiny but that there are infinite ways, with a lot of magic and mystery woven into our lives.\n\nWhat I particularly loved about Maybe In Another Life is that in both lives her friend Gabby was by Hannah‚Äôs side no matter what, both of them giving each other unwavering support.\n\nAh, novels that highlight strong female friendships like this one truly resonate with me. It‚Äôs incredibly uplifting. We need more of those stories. It‚Äôs healing.\n\nPicking up on the Topic of Parallel Lives\n\nThe Midnight Library was a novel on the infinite versions of lives we can try on and live out. Maybe In Another Life was the perfect continuation.\n\n(A little spoiler ahead but it‚Äôs a good one that will make you wanna read this novel even more.)\n\nIn both versions of her life, Hannah reaches the same conclusion:\n\n‚ÄúIf there are infinite number of universes, I don‚Äôt know how I got so lucky as to end up in this one.\n\nMaybe there are other lives for me out there, but I can‚Äôt imagine being as happy in any of them as I am right now, today.\n\nI have to think that while I may exist in other universes, none is as good as this.‚Äù\n\nThis makes me think of what is said in The Midnight Library that ‚Äì and I‚Äôm paraphrasing ‚Äì regardless of the life you‚Äôre living, the most important thing is the present moment, living in the now, and making it meaningful and worthwhile.\n\nSo much to ponder. So much hope. And so much beauty. We get to choose.\n\nAbout Taylor Jenkins Reid\n\n‚ÄúTaylor Jenkins Reid is the author of the New York Times Bestselling novels Carrie Soto Is Back, Malibu Rising, Daisy Jones and The Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, as well as One True Loves, Maybe in Another Life, After I Do, and Forever, Interrupted.

I‚Äôm hooked.\n\nMy favorite Quotes from the Book\n\n‚ÄúI need someone in my corner in order to thrive. I think I am one of those people who need people. Because my family left and I was OK with it, I always thought that I was more of a lone wolf. I guess I thought I didn‚Äôt need anyone.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou spend your life learning how not to get pregnant, and then, one day, you suddenly have to reverse all of that training.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause you are the kind of person who deserves a fuss made over her. That‚Äôs why. And I‚Äôm just the guy to do that.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBut I wonder how different my world would be if any of those things happened. You can‚Äôt change just one part, can you? When you sit there and wish things had happened differently, you can‚Äôt just wish away the bad stuff. You think about all the good stuff you might lose, too. Better just to stay in the now and focus on what you can do better in the future.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIn general, I find that when you are doing something you are not supposed to be doing, the best course of action is to act as if you are absolutely supposed to be doing it.‚Äù\n\nI love the following paragraph, long quote, but important!:\n\n‚Äú[‚Ä¶] I was reading about the different theories about the universe. I was really taken with this one theory that states that everything that is possible happens. That means that when you flip a quarter, it doesn‚Äôt come down heads or tails. It comes up heads and tails. Every time you flip a coin and it comes up heads, you are merely in the universe where the coin came up heads.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another version of you out there, created the second of every day. The world is splitting further and further into an infinite number of parallel universes where everything that could happen is happening. This is completely plausible, by the way. It‚Äôs a legitimate interpretation of quantum mechanics. It‚Äôs entirely possible that every time we make a decision, there‚Äôs a version of us out there somewhere who made a different choice. An infinite number of versions of ourselves are living out the consequences of every single possibility of our lives.
