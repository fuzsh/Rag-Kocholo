        "text": "Joy-Ann Reid didn’t set out to publish her best-selling third book, “Medgar and Myrlie: Medgar Evers and the Love Story That Awakened America” — which chronicles the lives of the prominent activists of the same name — in February, a month dedicated to both romance and Black history. But she’s glad it worked out that way.\n\n“It’s a civil rights love story that gets released, you know, in the month of love,” the MSNBC journalist said in a phone interview, a day after Valentine’s.\n\nTo tell this slice of this country’s history, one of racial segregation and violence, through the lens of a couple’s bond may not be an obvious choice. But for Reid, who waxes lyrical about Evers and Myrlie Evers-Williams, there wasn’t an alternative.\n\n“In talking with Myrlie about Medgar Evers, what comes through most is how in love with him she still is, and how he was truly the love of her life,” said Reid, who conducted more than a half-dozen interviews with Evers-Williams. “You couldn’t really tell the story through her eyes and through her memories without that being the primary focus.” (Evers-Williams was wedded to Evers for more than a decade before he was assassinated by a Ku Klux Klansman in 1963; she later married Walter Williams, who died of cancer in 1995.)\n\nReid added that she realized how central and integral their relationship was to Evers’s civil rights activism. After he was killed, Evers-Williams “took up the mantle of his legacy in order to burnish his legacy and then became a civil rights leader in her own right,” she said.\n\nThe Coretta Scott Kings (Martin Luther King Jr.) and the Betty Shabazzes (Malcolm X) are often omitted from the narratives of significant historical figures, Reid said. “We leave off their better half, their second half, the other part of their legacy that allowed them to do the work they did.” “Medgar and Myrlie” is her 352-page attempt to remedy that.\n\nAt the mention of her own spouse — whom she met when they were both 21 and married in 1997 — Reid’s voice perked up. “I won’t give my age, but we just celebrated our 27th anniversary,” she said. “I did my little Valentine’s Day post of him on Instagram, because that’s my ride or die.”\n\nShe added: “Love is a good thing. It helps you to do the work that you’re doing, and it’s good to have a grounding and loving relationship and partnership — so, I’m definitely a fan.”"
