        "text": "You can view Nucleotide BLAST (blastn) search results as pairwise alignments. Further, you can opt to display the CDS feature on the alignment. See the article on blastn and CDS feature set up. In this article we describe pairwise alignments with CDS feature display. A pairwise alignment can help you determine properties or problems of a sequence.\n\nAlignments on blastn search results pages (see an example in Figure 1) consist of two rows of nucleotide sequence. The top row represents your search sequence (Query). The bottom row represents a database sequence, called Subject (Sbjct). Lines connect the matching bases between Query and Subject. Missing lines indicate mismatches. Dashes (-) indicate gaps in the alignment. Gaps represent parts where Query or Subject have no counterpart.\n\nIf you select the CDS feature option, you will see two more rows of sequence. BLAST translates the CDS annotated on the Subject into a protein. You will see the protein sequence below the Subject nucleotide sequence as a row of letters. These letters are single-letter amino acid (AA) codes. Each code sits in the middle of its nucleotide codon (coding triplet). BLAST finds the aligned region between the Subject CDS and Query. It translates the Query based on the CDS alignment. It shows the protein translation above the Query (top-most row of letters).\n\nBLAST uses the genetic code (translation table) from the Subject record, but it applies this code only to the Subject translation. It uses only the standard genetic code for any Query translation that may not be appropriate for the query.\n\nNote the numbering for each sequence row. You can use the numbers to count the base- or amino acid positions.\n\nQuery and Subject can represent the same strand of the double-stranded DNA. In such case, you see the Plus/Plus Strand statement above the alignment. If the strands align in opposite directions, BLAST makes the Query sequence the plus strand. You then see the Plus/Minus Strand statement."
