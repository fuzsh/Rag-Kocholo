        "text": "Pasco County Official Records\n\nPasco County Official Records are searchable by name within document types and date ranges. Book and page and instrument numbers also allow direct access to individual documents. The Official Records system contains documents related to property, such as deeds and mortgages. They also contain many court documents, including final judgments.\n\nIndexes are available from 1975 through the current date. Images from 1990 to the present are viewable online by the public except for documents related to probate or family law cases, military discharges, and death certificates.\n\nThe images archived are digital reproductions of the original documents presented to the Clerk for recording. Except as specifically directed by law (e.g., redaction of information directed by statute), the Clerk's Office does not alter the content of the original documents during the recording process. Unclear or illegible content in the archived image is likely to be the result of unclear or illegible content in the original document.\n\nPasco County Historical Records Search\n\nThrough Kofile Quicklink we provide free access to Pasco County's Archived Records, including Deeds and Official Records dated 1876-1974.\n\nProtection of Minor Injunction Database\n\nA database with the identity as well as the fact that a final judgment for an injunction for the protection of a minor has been entered against that adult respondent.\n\nPasco County Plat Maps\n\nSearch plat maps online by using the name of the subdivision, plat book, and page number found on the warranty deed, or the section/township/range.\n\nA 24-by-36-inch version of a plat map is available by visiting the Clerk & Comptroller's Office for a fee of $5 per page.\n\nCertified Copies\n\nE-Certify is now available!
