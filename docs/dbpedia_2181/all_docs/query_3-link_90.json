        "text": "Chosen by the IBR Staff\n\nKindle Unlimited has over 4 million books to choose from.\n\nHow do you know which books are the good ones?\n\nWith a Kindle Unlimited (KU) subscription, you pay a monthly fee (now at $11.99 per month) so that you can read multiple ebooks per month without having to pay the full price per book. This includes eBooks, audiobooks, and magazines. There are super popular ebooks in KU (like Hunger Games & Colleen Hoover), but there are a lot of great indie books too.\n\nSingle eBooks usually range from about $4.99 to $14.99 depending on what you read (classics vs. new releases, indies vs. major publishers). The membership fee is meant to save you money if you read around 2-3 ebooks per month.\n\nThat’s a lot of choosing.

We have reviewed over 1,000 books since 2018, and we have found some absolute gems in the process. So we put together some of our highest recommended books on Kindle Unlimited.\n\nSince it’s important to sustain a healthy reading diet with a lot of variety, we’ve got recommendations in a number of genres: sci-fi & fantasy, literary & general fiction, horror, mystery-thrillers, nonfiction, and books for younger readers.\n\nHere are 23 great Kindle Unlimited books that you probably didn’t know you needed.\n\n1. The Devil Pulls the Strings\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nThe story follows Boone, a seemingly ordinary boy with a tragic past and fierce friendships. He’s sent on a mission which turns darker and more perplexing with each reveal. Boone innocently travels to an address where he’s supposed to take his friend’s place performing in a musical concert. But when he gets there, it’s a murder scene—happening live—a body and piano falling from the sky, crashing down in front of him.\n\nWhether the characters are running from terrifying monsters, sword-fighting sinister attackers, or fleeing from the scene of bloody murders, there’s always more going on. We wonder along with them: Is this time travel? An accidental trip through a magic portal? A mental break?\n\nEqually reminiscent of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, the surreal conversations with classical prodigies in Mozart in the Jungle, and particularly trippy episodes of The Magicians, this novel never stops surprising Boone or its readers.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nThe Devil Pulls the Strings is a twisted, joyous, and bloody shifting kaleidoscope of a fantasy adventure. It is a story so arresting, so action-packed and personality-filled, that even readers unfamiliar with or not usually interested in the historical setting will be enthralled by it.\n\nIs is a charming novel filled with curious characters. There is violence, death, terror, and suspense, but as Boone works to avoid summoning the Devil, the overall mood of the book is upbeat. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable, wholly unique, and brilliant read.\n\n–Andrea Marks-Joseph\n\n2. Commendable Delusions\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nA.T. French’s Commendable Delusions provides a breadcrumb trail of ten magical realist stories, each nestled in some unique nook of dream-tinted reality far from the bustle of cities and quotidian life.\n\nAirplanes, arid planes, and farmlands; each tale takes its venue and gently warps it into something surreal, serving as wholly engaging vehicles for the author’s messages on perception, connection, and our place in a jumbled reality.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nAs with the best of magical realism, French’s stories use the unknown and unreal to provide better understanding of the world around us… French does well to create his individual style and ambiance, but I can’t help but draw comparisons to Jorge Luis Borges or Haruki Murakami, only to better prepare the reader for the joy to come upon reading these stories.\n\nCommendable Delusions is one of those hidden gems, a read that I’m glad has intersected my path. In only ten pieces, it does what the best of stories do: it at once imparts wisdom, inspires the mind, and entertains with a sense of playful joy.\n\n–Joshua Ryan Bligh\n\n3. Season of the Dragon\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nSeason of the Dragon opens with Quen, a Solian desert merchant’s daughter. She was born with two different eye colors and two souls. Her other soul is one of a darker nature she must calm with magic. Animals fear Quen whenever she approaches them, and the townspeople keep their distance from her.\n\nOne day, a mysterious woman approaches Quen’s father, announcing secrets about Quen and her deceased mother. The angry father casts the woman out of sight before Quen can learn more. Later, a dragon burns down Solia, killing Quen’s father.\n\nThe strangest part about this tragic event? Dragons aren’t even supposed to exist.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nThere are some books you wish you could read forever. For me, Natalie Wright’s Season of the Dragon is one of them. The author writes with a deft hand, ensnaring us in the mystery that is our great heroine. Quen is a genuinely inspiring protagonist, and she’s never afraid to fight.\n\nThe Indrasi world is absolutely captivating. Wright has created a land with great cities, memorable characters, and curious customs. It feels alive. Those who loved Rachel Hartman’s Seraphina and other beloved dragon fantasies will enjoy this one.\n\n-Alexandria Ducksworth\n\n4. Cul-de-sac\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nThe Oughtside is here, and it is time to bathe in red. Nick Perilli takes you through a surreallist urban fantasy that dances a shadowy jib across genres as broad as soap opera, haunted house horror, and isekai. Perilli’s inspiration seems pulled from a wide creative interest, weaving together each piece into a singular, unique novel.\n\nWhen Derek, referred to as “the boy” for most of the narrative, wakes up, he knows something has gone down. He is tipped off by the sky, a strange red hue basking his typically boring suburban cul-de-sac in an otherwordly glow. If that doesn’t close the deal, then the shadowy figure in his hallway sure does, apparating and whisking him away à la A Christmas Carol to serve as Judgment, witnessing the varied lives of his neighbors and either condemning or saving them.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nLively and surreal, something born of a Venn diagram of Dali, de Chirico, and David Lynch, Cul-de-sac plays out with fascinating detail as a testament to the author’s imagination and playful style.\n\nThere is humor, resentment, passion, longing, missed chances, and more beneath the fragile surface of each of his characters, shining with a grounded clarity in an otherwise phantasmagoric landscape.\n\nReaders who enjoy the odd and spooky (without dipping into the kitsch of gratuitous horror) will find a crisp joy in Cul-de-sac.\n\n-Joshua Ryan Bligh\n\n5. The Bear & the Rose\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nThe Bear and the Rose is set in a world where humans shift into bears and community elders make pacts with gods for protection. Rhoswen, the “warrior rose” of her town and the protagonist of this wonderful book, has pledged her allegiance and sworn commitment to protect her village from the vicious bears who attack during the “waking nightmare” that is the season of Spring.\n\nThis year, right after the first attack, Rhoswen meets a beautiful woman and all her plans change, almost immediately. Suddenly nothing matters besides freeing her new lover from the curse that keeps her under the torment of a dangerous forest. She ventures out into the world, abandoning her village for the first time, in the fierce hope that the instrument that will free her lover from the forest can also prevent the bears from attacking her people.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nWritten so lyrically that it often feels as though you’re listening to a melodic folksong, author E.K. Larson-Burnett weaves nature and beauty into this imagined world. This novel is bloody murder and befriending beasts. It is at times a brutal fight for love, loyalty, and revenge.\n\nThe story is filled with all the wild creatures, dramatic gods, absurd dysfunctional families, and mythical tricksters you could want from a fantasy adventure novel, but it also moves with twists and turns and satisfying payoffs at a quick pace. If you’re looking for a captivating afternoon read that has a refreshing energy and richly woven lore, The Bear and the Rose is such a good choice.\n\n-Andrea Marks-Joseph\n\n6. Welcome to the Free World\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nWill Robin is part of a group called “Scalpels,” and they are in opposition of the creators of the AI technology dominating the society he lives in. Scalpels work tirelessly to remove microchips embedded in the brains of individuals in society.\n\nAs a part of Scalpels, Will’s job is to help individuals escape a totalitarian government that wishes to survey and control society through a metaverse where the “utopia” is in their heads.\n\nOf course, there are higher-ups who are not very pleased with the nature of Will’s job. Soon he finds himself on the run from assassins, the authorities, and everyone else who is against the work he is doing.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nThe world is so intricately woven together that readers are going to be sucked in from the moment they begin. Everything from the details of how the Aurora technology works to the state of the society has been so cleverly crafted that we always feel a part of the story and world.\n\nSettle in to the comfort of your chairs for this story that grabs you by the throat.\n\n–Chika Anene\n\n7. Tourist Trapped\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nTobias Munch feels stuck. Stuck at a job he hates, in an apartment he hates. He’s recently divorced and looking for solace in the novel he’s been writing for the last eight years.\n\nEnamored with a vibrant barista, Mia, from the café he frequents, he yearns in secret until the night she accidentally hits him with her car. And invites him into her life.\n\nHe takes psychedelic drugs with her, desperate to impress her, but their trip takes them to a place called the “the–in-between”—the afterlife between life and death. Tobias is trapped once again, it seems. And it’s up to him to find the answers.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nVelasquez has a wonderful way of describing the intricate world in which we’re thrown. We see how people communicate through the vastness of this purgatory and spend time with activities they do to stay busy while there. The attention to worldbuilding is refreshing, and it keeps the pages turning quickly.\n\nThe author’s background in psychotherapy brings forward a unique perspective on introspection and how every aspect of character development is a type of growth.\n\n–Audrey Davis\n\nLooking to bookify your wardrobe?

The Old Men Who Row Boats and Other Stories\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nThe Old Men Who Row Boats and Other Stories is a collection of perceptive observations on people living on the Iberian Peninsula. A simple moment, like a quiet interaction between strangers, transforms into a captivating tale of lost time or lost love, newfound friendship or newfound hope, under the pen of David Joseph.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nDavid Joseph shines as a storyteller. He knows what his stories are about, and he knows how they should be told. His characters are simple but imagined through a lens so romantic, so compelling, that they stand clear in the mind’s eye.\n\nI highly recommend immersing yourself in Joseph’s world of lovers and dreamers, strangers and lifelong friends. Each story offers an opportunity to make a meaningful connection with another human being, serves as a recollection of how intertwined we once were, and will be once again, with each other.\n\n–Madeline Barbush\n\n9. Just Wide Enough for Two\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nJust Wide Enough for Two is a love story between childhood best friends Emily Dickinson and Susan Gilbert, spanning years of complicated life changes where their passionate connection remains constant.\n\nEmily Dickinson is wild and offbeat, more comfortable running around outdoors and speaking out of turn than she is in any stereotypical “ladylike” capacity.\n\nBetween vivid descriptions of the ever-changing natural landscapes, seductive descriptions when looking at each other, and the secret-coded letters slipped between breasts before sneaking off to rendezvous, open-hearted Emily and Susan always take center stage.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nJust Wide Enough for Two feels like a classic romantic comedy filled with grand gestures of love in a charming historical setting. There’s a powerful sense of longing and suspense while reading, as we cannot imagine how the women may achieve their happily ever after under these circumstances, but trust that they will.\n\nA long-lasting romance with steady beats of delicious sapphic sexual tension, this book makes sure that even readers who are unfamiliar with the story of Emily Dickinson’s life will be pulled in by the beautiful, sincere, and poetic love depicted\n\n–Andrea Marks-Joseph\n\n10. Navarro’s Gold\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nEven though he is innocent, Cole Baxter is a wanted man.\n\nAfter the love of his life, Maggie, chooses Cole’s best friend over him, he seeks out a treasure that he and Maggie have talked about for years in hopes that, with the treasure, he can win her back.\n\nWhat he doesn’t expect is for his former friend Doyle, Maggie’s husband, to put up a reward for his arrest. As Cole travels from town to town in search of a famous astronomer who can help him read the pirate’s journal to track down Navarro’s treasure, he is tailed by Pinkertons and bandits, making an already fraught hunt even more dangerous, often almost deadly.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nHansen’s knowledge of the wild west landscape is matched only by his poetic diction in which he expresses the beauty of the natural world. Navarro’s Gold, is an adventure and treasure-hunting novel that harbors a sophisticated depth. The treasure hunt is not about the gold itself, but the history behind it, and the story of those who try to find it.\n\n–Nick Rees Gardner\n\n11. Morphosis\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nOllie Hooper and his family relocate to a rural farm in Larton, home to approximately 3,800 people. Hooper has taken a job with the Sheriff’s Department, leaving his partner, Dwayne Brenner, as the primary caretaker to Hooper’s two children, Jodi Lee and Sam.\n\nIn addition to catching a killer dubbed “The Visitor,” Dwayne attempts to guide Jodi Lee through her fledgling adolescence and first crushes in a new town. Unfortunately, Jodi Lee is befriended by the daughter of the town priest. Dwayne’s medicine slowly starts to go missing; his home is being bleached and disinfected daily; and Jodi Lee won’t face him without a mask covering her face.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nAJ Saxsma has delivered one of my favorite books of 2023. Morphosis operates with an undercurrent of tension exacerbated by a cast of characters all chasing something. It’s a tense LGTQ horror novel you aren’t going to forget.\n\n-Lindsay Crandall\n\n12. A Perfect Night\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nFran has a gift of seeing spirits, but she also has some terrible secrets. She lives with her Aunt Laura after her mother dies in a terrible car accident and after her father gives up his only daughter and is never seen again.\n\nFran believes her mother’s spirit is still with her despite the naysayers. Whenever Fran is sad, her mother sends her ladybugs. Other times, her mother disciplines her for wrongdoings.\n\nWhen a wealthy relative enters her life, she learns that she’s not the only one with connections to spirits. Soon, the spirit that might not be her mother turns malevolent.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nYou think you have read dark fantasy—and then you read A Perfect Night. Stone weaves heavy scenarios you can’t stop thinking about. It’s like not being able to fall asleep after watching a horror movie. Stone really knows how to give us the creeps. Scenes are disturbing yet strangely captivating. Readers may become addicted to the drama. Be warned, A Perfect Night contains plenty of shock matter and death.\n\nEverybody involved in this gripping story has something to reveal, and the results are often jaw-dropping and downright scary.\n\n–Alexandria Ducksworth\n\n13. Unshod, Cackling, and Naked\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nIn one story, a woman disappears on occasion and leaves her husband questioning how; in another, a man wakes up to discover his town is under siege by bats; another follows a woman as a tree overpowers her body and mind. The ten other stories will take readers on completely different journeys. What they all have in common? They’ll all leave readers with mouths wide open.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nMore than once I thought to myself, “How did she come up with this?” And I have a feeling many other readers will think the same. Thompson displays an impressive range—stories of the supernatural, of hallucinations, of the all-too-real horrors of the human mind. From deeply heartbreaking to inspiring and destructive, anything is possible as these characters question what’s become of their realities.\n\nWhen I finished this collection, I wanted to clap like the annoying person in a movie theater. To say I enjoyed it would be an understatement.\n\n–Jaylynn Korrell\n\nIn a book club? Check out these book club gifts for hosts & members!\n\n14. In the Vanishing Hour\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nEight years after her brother Mac’s tragic drowning, 20-year-old Frances has never recovered. She became a shell of the girl she once was, and she longs to be something more, to see someone else when she looks in the mirror.\n\nWhen she meets new model Gwen at the department store where she works, Frances is set down a new path and begins to explore the possibility that there could be more for her out there. But how can she move forward and live a life she dreams of when she can’t outrun her grief or control her newest obsession?\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nIn the Vanishing Hour pairs suspense with drama and a touch of romance, for an effect that is pleasant and cozy. What a novel for a rainy afternoon.\n\nMartin expertly moves between characters and timelines, jumping between 1959 and 1974, blending past and present together, all the while slowly unravelling details that keep the reader guessing and on the edge of their seat, desperate to know more.\n\nThe writing is poetic and detailed enough to give us a clear picture of this little town and its characters, both in their prime and in their decline. Martin’s dialogue flows so effortlessly and smoothly that you forget you’re not sitting in the moment with the characters.\n\n–Melissa Suggitt\n\n15. Soiled Dove Murder\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nSchool is out for the summer. Schoolteacher Lucie Santoro and Delores Bailey, her incongruous moonshiner companion, are using the break to help one of Lucie’s old pupils.\n\nThe once-impoverished student is now running a bordello of prostitutes in Virginia City. When one of her so-called “soiled doves” goes missing in suspicious circumstances and law enforcement doesn’t care, Ruth turns to Lucie, the one person she knows will help.\n\nAs a teacher in the 1920s, life is a delicate balancing act for Lucie. Being seen with the owner of a bordello would be enough to shatter her reputation and destroy her career. Little does Lucie know that losing her career may be the least of her worries. On this holiday, she’ll be in danger of losing her life.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nI don’t know if you can really have a gripe with this book. It’s clever, nuanced, entertaining, and fun all at once. As with all of the books I’ve read from Sherilyn Decter, the historical attention to detail is remarkable. From the very first bumpy, exhausting bus ride to the portrayal of Chinese immigration in 1920s USA, it’s clear how well Decter understands the world she’s writing.\n\nWhat I love about these novels is that the protagonists aren’t immune to the values of their time. They judge and misstep, but they are fully rounded empathetic characters and the more they experience, the wider their understanding becomes.\n\n-Joelene Pynnonen\n\n16. Here in the Not Yet\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nThe story opens as our protagonist (Ben) and his father (Mr. Knight) are departing on a road trip like they used to do when Ben was a child. A wholesome and thoughtful conversation is tragically cut short as a car accident claims his father’s life and traumatizing Ben.\n\nAfter that event, Ben takes a morning jog that disturbs the fates and propels us on a thrilling journey that beautifully combines what is real with what is imaginary. Traumas from the past resurface and take form. How Ben reacts to them will define not only his fate, but his loved ones’ as well.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nI’m struggling to think of a book that I’ve read in the last few years that resonated with me quite as much as Here in the Not Yet did. David Spaugh writes about trauma, death, separation, fears, and more in a way that makes them palpable.\n\nThe constant blend between two worlds lends the story an incredible sense of danger. It doesn’t care for reality or emulating it; it emerges out of the dark and makes its presence known, and with it comes everything that Ben has underneath.\n\n–Akram Herrak\n\nReading nonfiction is a great way to read multiple books at once!

Life, Travel, and the People in Between\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nAt nineteen, working in a Comfort Inn motel, and studying at Norfolk State University, Mike Nixon dreams of having a bigger life. One that more resembles the lives of the guests checking into the rooms of his motel every day.\n\nOnly when he travels to the Dominican Republic as part of his university’s study-abroad program does he realize what he’s been missing. Visiting new countries and meeting people from different walks of life calls to him. On his return to the USA, Mike’s only concern is how to repeat the experience. As a poor uni student, his options seem limited. But the calling to experience the world is far too powerful to refuse, and soon Mike is doing everything he can to follow it.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nLife Travel and the People in Between is like an interesting discussion with someone talking about the life they love. It’s accessible, relatable, sometimes funny, and sometimes painful. It’s also one of those books that inspires you just by existing. For someone without a lot of means, either social, professional, or economic, it’s amazing how Nixon manages to build such a fulfilling, enriching life while following his heart.\n\n–Joelene Pynnonen\n\n18. Whole Body Prayer\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nYan Ming Li was born and raised during the Maoist China era. There was little freedom, people toiled endlessly in factories, and food was strictly limited. His parents had little time to spend with him and his siblings, as they were busy working 10+ hour days to make sure their children were fed.\n\nLi eventually was introduced to the Light, an inner guide to everything in his life. It told him where to go and whom he will meet. It is the qi inside every one of us, our natural energy system. Li uses this unique energy to heal people.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nWhole Body Prayer is incredibly inspiring and spiritually magical. The book reads like Yogananda’s The Autobiography of a Yogi and Kosta Danaos’s The Magus of Java. A warm wave of peaceful energy emits from the pages of Li’s memoir.\n\nWhole Body Prayer reveals an important message: we all have a gift to share. Li’s gift was his qi. Not only does he use it to help hundreds of people, he reminds others that they can heal themselves.\n\n-Alexandria Ducksworth\n\n19. The Anthropocene Epoch\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nAuthor Bruce Glass tells a complete story of how we’ve arrived and where we are going. The earth has gone through extinction-level events before (five to be exact), and we go through each one early on in the book. Then, we arrive at the small fraction of time humans have been on the planet. We may be making our lives more convenient and our standards of living higher, but we have “altered nearly half of our planet’s land surface area.” We have dammed and diverted almost all major rivers. Cut down trees. Filled our air with enough cow farts & burps to rapidly change our atmosphere.\n\nAnd the earth is responding with warmer climates and catastrophic storms.\n\nWhat can we do to stop this?\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nThe Anthropocene Epoch: When Humans Changed the World is about as good of a book on the climate crisis as I could have asked for. Supremely readable and undeniably informative, it has what it takes to transform everyday citizens from unknowing contributors in the end of the world to enthusiastic and active participants in its possible salvation.\n\nA terrifically important piece on the future of our planet, The Anthropocene Epoch will inspire readers to take an objective view of our choices and to act on them before it’s too late.\n\n-Joe Walters\n\n20. Kingdom of the Silver Cat\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nAfter their school bus travels through a mysterious blue light and ends up in a strange field, a group of kids quickly discover the truth—that they won’t be going to school today. They assume the adult in charge (their bus driver) will figure things out for them, but when he fails to return from searching for help, they soon realize that it’s up to them to get themselves back to where they came from.\n\nBut not long after arriving, the kids begin to show unique magical powers. While the world and powers seem exciting, they still know they need to get back home, for the road back is filled with challenges they never could have imagined.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nI read most of this book with a smile on my face, happy to feel a part of the group that evolves because of this magical bus ride. Ranging in age from 8 to 13, each child is on a personal journey along their trip back home.\n\nCarroll’s imaginative writing really brings the world of Hevelen to life. The way he describes each new aspect of the land gives the reader a clear image that is often exciting and unique to imagine. The fruit he describes makes your mouth water, the animals seem realistic despite their kooky differences, and when danger arrives, the hairs on your neck will stand tall. I feel impressed by the care given to each small detail.\n\nCarroll’s imagination seems to know no bounds, as do the places that this series can possibly go in the future.\n\n-Jaylynn Korrell\n\n21. The Journey to Jumbalot\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nFat housecat Alby loves three things: naps, a filled food bowl, and his owner Professor Wizoom. But Wizoom soon disappears through a bright triangular door in the name of science. A mysterious voice from beyond beckons, telling Alby to be brave and leave the safety of his now owner-less home. It’s time for him to take the leap.\n\nOn the other side of the door, Alby discovers the bright and fantastical world of Jumbalot and its inhabitants. But he soon discovers that the once-friendly kingdoms of Jowla and Wolvoon are warring over the powerful Gem of Jumbalot.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nRyan Wakefield’s Journey to Jumbalot is as entertaining as it is smart, addressing themes of courage, compassion, friendship, and more. It is a classic fantasy tale at heart, but Wakefield brings a delightful originality to it in creating this world and his “jumbo:” the beasts and creatures of Jumbalot who are composed of different Earth animals. Firephants, warthawks, and deermations keep our imaginations churning on this fantasy friendship adventure for the whole family—pets included.\n\nThis book is sure to be a bedtime favorite with the family. It is jam-packed with adventure, action, and heart, and it would be a great book to teach your children how to handle problems with love and compassion and show them how to lead with their hearts.\n\n-Samantha Hui\n\n22. Wicked Blood\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\nA shapeshifter travels to Berlin in search of her father, where she ends up tangled in a deadly feud with the city’s supernatural creatures.\n\nWhat at first feels like a novelty, or a result of not visiting the right tourist spots, turns out to be a supernatural crisis: Cynthia hasn’t seen any supernatural beings in Berlin—no vampires, shifters, witches, or hunters—because they have gone into hiding, or worse, may be dying en masse.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nDe Klerk’s worldbuilding is rich with fresh takes on old magic. The fascinating mechanics of being a shapeshifter are by far my favorite. Shapeshifting is described clear as day, as if you’re watching on screen. The rules of Cynthia’s magic create challenges just as exciting as the opportunities they cause. The supernatural in Wicked Blood is wonderfully accessible and conversational, bringing you into the experience with ease.\n\nIn this tale of abandoned buildings and misplaced trust, Cynthia finds Berlin’s history entangled with ancient magical theories and creatures. Wicked Blood is easy to sink your teeth into and such a sweet thrill to read.\n\n-Andrea Marks-Joseph\n\n23. Dawn of Deoridium\n\nWhat it’s about:\n\n16-year-old Kaili, who is next in line of the queens of the kingdom of Kalulishi, is no ordinary royal. She possesses electromagnetic power caused by The Shift—an upheaval of the earth’s magnetosphere more than three hundred years ago.\n\nWhen Kalulishi faces an attack by an outside force bearing the name Iron King, Kaili puts her life on the line and travels to the deadly Dead Lats to find Deoridium—a mythical element that possesses unmatched electromagnetic energy that her father spent a great deal of time searching for while he was alive—in order to save her people.\n\nWhy you should read it:\n\nFrom reading Dawn of Deoridium, one thing is clearest to me—Jeff Ting is one heck of a talented writer.\n\nThe descriptions in Dawn of Deoridium are so alive, and the banter shared between clansmen of certain cities during Kaili’s journey, or the little children who eagerly want her to perform tricks with her powers, are great specific details added to the already strong worldbuilding. You’re going to love the world Ting has created here.\n\n–Chika Anene\n\nWhat are the best Kindle Unlimited books you’ve ever read? Let us know in the comments!\n\nAbout the IBR Staff"
