        "text": "Abdominal pain may result from a wide range of causes.\n\nAdditionally, research from 2023 suggests that the most common causes of nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than 7 days are:\n\ngastroenteritis\n\nnonspecific abdominal pain, which means that healthcare professionals did not identify the cause of the pain\n\ngallstones\n\nkidney stones\n\ndiverticulitis\n\nappendicitis\n\n1. Gastroenteritis (stomach flu)\n\nViruses, bacteria, and parasites can cause gastroenteritis. However, people usually use the term “stomach flu” to refer to viral gastroenteritis.\n\nIn this case, the abdominal pain is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. Additionally, viral gastroenteritis may sometimes cause fever and may lead to dehydration.\n\n2. Gallstones\n\nGallstones may form if bile contains too much bilirubin or cholesterol or not enough bile salts. Gallstones may also occur if the gallbladder does not completely empty or does not empty frequently enough.\n\nA person typically does not experience any symptoms unless the gallstones block the bile duct, causing bile to build up in the gallbladder. This can cause a gallbladder attack, which may present with pain in the upper right abdomen. This abdominal pain may last for several hours.\n\n3. Kidney stones\n\nKidney stones may form in one or both kidneys as a result of high levels of certain minerals in the urine. These minerals include calcium, oxalate, and phosphorous.\n\nA person should contact a healthcare professional immediately if they experience any of the following symptoms:\n\nsharp pain in the lower abdomen, side, back, or groin\n\nblood in the urine, which may appear pink, red, or brown\n\na constant need to urinate\n\npain while urinating\n\ninability to urinate or only urinating in small amounts\n\ncloudy or foul-smelling urine\n\nKidney stones can also cause:\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nfever\n\nchills\n\n4. Diverticulitis\n\nDiverticula are pouches that may form and push outward through weak spots in a person’s large intestine, or colon.\n\nDiverticulitis refers to inflammation of the diverticula. It can cause abdominal pain, typically in the lower left side. Other symptoms of diverticulitis include:\n\ndiarrhea or constipation\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nchills\n\nfever\n\n5. Appendicitis\n\nAppendicitis describes inflammation of the appendix. It can cause abdominal pain that may:\n\nstart near the belly button and move lower and to the right\n\nstart suddenly, possibly waking a person if they are sleeping\n\nworsen during movement, deep breathing, sneezing, or coughing\n\nbe severe and feel different than any pain a person has felt before\n\noccur before other symptoms and worsen over a few hours\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\nfever\n\nloss of appetite\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nabdominal bloating\n\nIt may also cause bowel issues, such as:\n\ndiarrhea or constipation\n\ninability to pass gas\n\na feeling that having a bowel movement will help relieve discomfort\n\n6. Trapped gas\n\nGas occurs when bacteria in the small intestine break down foods that the body finds intolerant. It can also occur if a person swallows more air than usual.\n\nTrapped gas may cause abdominal pain. It may also cause abdominal bloating and flatulence or belching.\n\n7. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n\nDoctors do not know exactly what causes IBS. Abdominal pain is the primary symptom for many people with IBS. It often occurs alongside bowel movements and changes in bowel movements, which may include constipation, diarrhea, or both.\n\nOther common symptoms include:\n\nbloating\n\nfeeling that a bowel movement is not complete\n\nmucus in the stool\n\n8. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER)\n\nOccasionally, stomach acids travel backward, moving up into the throat. This reflux typically causes heartburn and regurgitation. People refer to chronic GER as gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD).\n\nGER may also cause:\n\npain in the abdomen\n\ndifficulty swallowing\n\nabdominal bloating\n\nnausea\n\nbelching\n\n9. Constipation\n\nWhen too much waste collects in the bowel, it increases the pressure on the colon, which may cause abdominal pain.\n\nConstipation occurs for many reasons, including:\n\ntoo little fiber or fluid in the diet\n\ntaking certain medications\n\nlow levels of physical activity\n\npregnancy\n\nIt can also be a sign of a neurological disorder or a blockage in the intestine. If constipation persists and is uncomfortable, experts recommend talking with a doctor.\n\n10. Food intolerances\n\nFood intolerance is when a person’s body has difficulty digesting certain foods or ingredients in food.\n\nFood intolerance may cause abdominal pain and other symptoms, such as:\n\nbloating\n\ndiarrhea\n\nflatulence\n\n11. Peptic ulcers\n\nPeptic ulcers are sores that occur on the lining of the stomach or duodenum, which is the first part of the small intestine. They commonly cause abdominal pain.\n\nOther symptoms may include:\n\nbloating\n\nbelching\n\nfeeling too full soon while eating\n\nfeeling uncomfortably full after eating\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nThe most common causes of stomach and peptic ulcers are the bacteria Helicobacter pylori and the overuse or continued use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen.\n\n12. Crohn’s disease\n\nCrohn’s disease causes inflammation of the digestive tract lining. It commonly causes:\n\nabdominal pain\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\ndiarrhea\n\nSymptoms can vary depending on the location and severity of inflammation. Stress and certain foods may trigger or worsen symptoms.\n\n13. Celiac disease\n\nCeliac disease happens when a person has an allergy to gluten, a protein found in many grains, such as wheat and barley. It causes damage to the small intestine.\n\nDigestive symptoms include:\n\nabdominal pain\n\nchronic diarrhea\n\nbloating\n\ngas\n\nlactose intolerance\n\nnausea\n\nvomiting\n\nPeople with this condition need to avoid consuming gluten.\n\n14. Pulled or strained muscles\n\nMany daily activities require the use of the abdominal muscles. Occasionally, a person may injure or strain these muscles, resulting in pain.\n\nPeople may also experience abdominal pain as a result of exercise. Doing more situps than usual, for example, may lead to muscle pain in the abdominal area.\n\nA person should speak with a doctor if pain does not improve with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE).\n\n15. Menstrual cramps or endometriosis\n\nMenstruation can cause inflammation and pain in the abdomen. Bloating, gas, cramping, and constipation can also occur during menstruation, causing abdominal discomfort."
