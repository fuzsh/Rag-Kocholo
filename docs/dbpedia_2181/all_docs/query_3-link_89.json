        "text": "Locations\n\nCampers can choose from four parks and more than 140 campsites. Set up camp on waterfront's edge or on a site secluded beneath majestic trees. Then sit back and watch the stars and moon dance across the sky.\n\nCampsites\n\nFull hook-up campsites include electric, water, and sewage connections. Full hook-ups are available in Central State Park.\n\nPrimitive campsites in Central State Park and Edmond Park are available for campers who are not in need of electrical, water, or sewage hook-ups.\n\nRegular campsites feature electric hook-ups and community water. Regular campsites are located in Central State Park and Scissortail Campground.\n\nPlease note: Each campsite has a maximum limit of two sleeping units, two vehicles, and up to 10 people allowed per site. All camping has a 14 stay limit, per park, from March 1-October 31.\n\nCampground Amenities\n\nWe've made roughing it a lot smoother. Each campsite has a picnic table, utility table, charcoal grill, fire ring, and access to community water and restrooms. Electric and water hookups are available for recreational vehicles in select areas. We also offer numerous picnic areas nestled along the waterfront, with large community pavilions to accommodate group activities.\n\nOnline Campsite Reservations:"
