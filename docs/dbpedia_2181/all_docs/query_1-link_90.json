        "text": "Dosage and strength\n\nColchicine comes as 500 microgram tablets. Your dose will depend on what you are taking it for.\n\nIf you have kidney or liver disease, your doctor may prescribe a lower dose. You will also have regular blood and urine tests.\n\nFor gout\n\nIf youâ€™re having a gout attack\n\nThe usual dose to treat a gout attack is 1 tablet (500 micrograms), taken 2 to 4 times a day until the symptoms get better. You must not take more than 12 tablets (6mg) during a course of treatment.\n\nAfter completing your course of treatment, you cannot start another course for at least 3 days.\n\nTo prevent another gout attack\n\nIf you've had gout, your doctor may prescribe a medicine such as allopurinol to lower the levels of uric acid in your body. Uric acid forms crystals around the joint and make it painful.\n\nYour doctor may also prescribe colchicine to help prevent another attack while the uric acid levels are being reduced.\n\nIf you're taking colchicine to prevent gout, the usual dose is 1 tablet (500 micrograms) taken twice a day.\n\nYour doctor will tell you how long to take it for.\n\nFor familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)\n\nDoses can vary between 1 and 4 tablets (500 micrograms to 2mg), taken once a day.\n\nHow to take it\n\nSwallow your tablets whole, with a drink of water.\n\nHow long to take it for\n\nIf you have gout, you'll usually take colchicine for just a few days. Your doctor will tell you how long to take it for.\n\nFor familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), your doctor will usually recommend taking this medicine long-term.\n\nIf you forget to take it\n\nIf you forget to take your dose, take it as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. If this happens, skip the missed dose, and take the next one at the usual time.\n\nNever have 2 doses at the same time. Never have an extra dose to make up for a forgotten one.\n\nIf you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember your medicines.\n\nIf you take too much\n\nTaking more than your prescribed dose of colchicine tablets can be very dangerous. It could be fatal.\n\nSymptoms of taking too much colchicine can include:\n\nfeeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting)\n\na stomach ache\n\ndiarrhoea containing blood\n\nsigns of low blood pressure, such as feeling dizzy or light-headed\n\nIf you go to A&E, do not drive yourself. Get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance.\n\nTake your medicine packet or leaflet inside, plus any remaining medicine with you."
