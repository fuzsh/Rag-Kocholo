        "text": "Minette Walters is clearly on a roll. Each novel she brings out differs from the one before in style and subject matter but remains the same in the sheer verve of the writing and the thrills she provides. After the formal experimentation of The Shape of Snakes came Acid Row, a straight-ahead thriller set on a sink estate. Now she has moved to the fox-hunting set and the shenanigans that take place in an isolated Dorset village.\n\nThe English village is, of course, the chosen habitat for a host of 'cosy' mysteries that are long on nostalgia and short on reality. There's nothing nostalgic in Fox Evil (Macmillan £12.99, p384) as it deals with the nastier side of village life: vicious rumour-mongering and a dislike of outsiders, particularly travellers.\n\nWalters's fictional village of Shensted is built on secrets and deceit. Elderly Ailsa Lockyer-Fox is found dead in her garden, dressed only in nightclothes and with bloodstains on the ground near her body. Her husband, Colonel Lockyer-Fox, seems the obvious suspect but the coroner's inquest gives a verdict of natural causes.\n\nThat doesn't stop the gossips, who begin a vicious campaign against the colonel. Rumours are spread about him that concern much more than the death of his wife. The colonel, despite his increasing isolation, seems unwilling to challenge these rumours. Instead, he concentrates his energies on the search for an illegitimate child - his only grandchild - who was put up for adoption when she was born. Engrossing.\n\nDenise Mina's Garnethill trilogy ensured her a seat at the top table of British mystery writing. Sanctum (Bantam £12.99, pp360) is her first stand-alone novel - and it is quite simply brilliant.\n\nA psychiatrist working in jail with serious offenders is found guilty of murdering a notorious serial killer, with whom she is also said to have had sexual relations. Her husband, convinced she is innocent of both charges, moves into her office to study her medical notes and her transcriptions of interviews with the killer.\n\nHe is looking for evidence to overturn the charges but soon begins to question his wife's version of events. He wonders what exactly the relationship was between his wife and the serial killer. And he wonders too what it is that his wife doesn't want him to find. Denise Mina springs a number of surprises, not least the terrific ending.\n\nMichael Connelly's latest stand-alone novel, Chasing the Dime (Orion £12.99, pp416), is set in the cutting-edge world of the latest computer technology. Thankfully, Connelly keeps the geek stuff to a minimum. Indeed, his basic premise is almost old-fashioned in its simplicity. A man moves into a new apartment and starts getting phone calls for a woman who had the number before and who seems to have disappeared. She's an escort and the phone number is listed on a website called LA Darlings.\n\nThe man, Henry Pierce - brilliant but broken-hearted head of a technology company that is about to make it big - tries to track down the missing girl. There's a reason for his obsession with her - years earlier his own sister, also a prostitute, disappeared and ended up a victim of the Dollmaker (a serial killer who featured in Connelly's The Concrete Blonde).\n\nThe premise might sound vaguely Hitchcockian, but unfortunately Connelly doesn't deliver anything near Hitchcock's blend of thrills and surprises. There are some pleasing twists and one or two shocks but the bad guys are two-dimensional and the way the police focus in on Pierce himself as a possible abductor of the missing girl doesn't really convince.\n\nConnelly knows what he's doing so Chasing the Dime is an entertaining enough read but it's by no means his best work. However, he obviously takes it seriously himself - he has purchased websites mentioned in the book and set them up to link with the novel.\n\nAs it's almost the year's end, here is a reminder of some of the best mystery writing published in 2002.\n\nJoseph Kanon's The Good German (Little, Brown £10.99, pp482) was, in my view, the best mystery novel of the year. As a judge for the inaugural Ian Fleming Steel Daggers, I tried hard to get it on the short list but the other judges felt its pace worked against it.\n\nIt is slow but that's because Kanon is trying to pack so much in. The Good German is set in Berlin in 1945 when the USSR and the US were competing for what was left of Hitler's V2 rocket project: the Russians grabbed the hardware, the Americans grabbed the scientists.\n\nYou don't often find thrillers that deal with big themes with assurance, but Kanon's measured novel explores issues around the Holocaust while still delivering a powerful thriller. Magnificent - and watch out for next year's film version, to be directed by Steven Soderbergh, starring George Clooney.\n\nJose Carlos Somoza deservedly won the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger Award for The Athenian Murders (Abacus £6.99, pp320), his ingenious mystery set in Plato's Athens. A modern translator uncovers a murder plot hidden in the ancient Greek text he is translating. Its solution unfolds in his footnotes to the translation - then he finds his own life is threatened. Umberto Eco, move over.\n\nLouise Welsh's beautifully written The Cutting Room ( Canongate £10.99, pp294 ) won the CWA John Creasey Memorial Dagger for the best first novel of the year. Its subject matter is dark - in Glasgow a gay antiques auctioneer stumbles into the cold world of hardcore pornography - but it's a memorable piece of work.\n\nDavid Benioff's The 25th Hour (NEL £5.99,pp278) is being filmed by Spike Lee with Ed Norton playing the central character, Monty. The premise is simplicity itself - Monty spends his last day before going to prison for drug-dealing walking the streets of New York, remembering life's wrong turns and dealing with the friends and enemies he encounters on the way. Another impressive debut."
