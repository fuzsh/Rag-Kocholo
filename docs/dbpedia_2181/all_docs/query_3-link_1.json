        "text": "I've seen a lot of discussion about this in a couple of different writer's forums I belong to, and I made a point of writing down a consensus that many of them seemed to reach. While the actual word counts will vary and everybody will have different opinions on what the count should be, this should help to serve as a general guide.\n\nShort story - under 10,000 words\n\nNovelette - 10k-20k words\n\nNovella - 20k-50k\n\nNovel - 50k-100k\n\nEpic Novel - over 100k\n\nIt's hard to say; length is usually measured by word count and not page count or thickness. Layout and font choice can change the number of pages a book has without changing the length of it.\n\nThat being said, I believe 50,000 words is still the minimum to scratch by as a novel, though most run between 75k and 100k words of late, though it used to be shorter. You can go longer than that but it's harder to sell unless you are established.\n\nWord counts offered by publishers are guide lines.\n\nEnough -good words- to tell the story and keep the attention of the audience.\n\nSome folks want to pronounce some magic word count/page count and will will bemoan my answer as wrong. So it goes.\n\nHow many manuscript pages/word count are in Joyce's Ulysses? Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow? Pynchon's Crying of Lot 49?\n\nLot's of authors can hit the word count exactly and never get published....\n\nTechnically, 50k and up is a novel, but in most genres for adults, 80k is the minimum.\n\nNovellas (20k-50k) tend to be very hard to sell because there aren't many markets that even look at them--they're too short to be books and too long to fit in a magazine.\n\nHowever, with ebooks, length restrictions are being relaxed by some publishers, and novellas can be published as standalone books. (For example, Samhain Publishing publishes ebooks from 12k to 100k, though only those 50k and up will have print versions.)\n\nIt depends on the genre or audience, I believe. I've seen lists all over the place. Googling will give you some answers.\n\nI've seen 80-110,000 for an adult novel, but sci-fi, for example, often goes longer. Young adult will be less, children's even less.\n\nNo there isn't. If you are contributing stories to a magazine, paper or a collection of short stories the editor might have an upper limit and you can ask him or her about it. If you are writing a novel, there is no preset limit. Most classics we read today were originally published in bits on newspapers of those days.\n\nYou can follow one JKR did with Harry Potter books. The first book was relatively short, and as the series became more popular the length of the books increased."
