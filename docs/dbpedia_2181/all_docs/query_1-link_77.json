        "text": "What is indigestion?\n\nIndigestion is pain or discomfort after eating, while your stomach is digesting. Healthcare providers also use the term dyspepsia, which means the same thing: impaired digestion. If you get a stomachache or upset tummy after eating, something in your digestive process isn’t going quite right. It’s not always a problem with your body, though. Sometimes it just means you ate the wrong thing or ate too fast.\n\nAlmost everyone has experienced occasional indigestion. But for some people, it’s a daily occurrence that diminishes their quality of life. When indigestion becomes a significant problem, you may find yourself seeking healthcare for answers and relief. Sometimes there’s an underlying gastrointestinal (GI) disease that needs treatment. But sometimes there’s no simple explanation for these symptoms.\n\nWhat does indigestion feel like?\n\nIndigestion may involve several different symptoms, but it always involves some level of abdominal pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is where most of the organs in your digestive system live, so if they’re having difficulties while doing their jobs, that’s where you’ll feel it. Indigestion symptoms always occur after eating, when your stomach is digesting — what healthcare providers call the postprandial period.\n\nExperts generally agree that the symptoms of indigestion include:\n\nEpigastric pain. Your epigastrium is your central, upper abdominal region. This is where your stomach is.\n\nBurning sensation. Burning may come from stomach acids and enzymes in your GI tract, or from inflammation.\n\nEarly or late-lasting satiety. Feeling full soon after eating, or long after, suggests your stomach is overwhelmed.\n\nBut people who experience indigestion often report other symptoms along with it, such as:\n\nBloating.\n\nGas.\n\nNausea.\n\nBurping.\n\nRegurgitation (when swallowed food comes back up).\n\nAcid reflux.\n\nHeartburn.\n\nThese symptoms can overlap with indigestion, but they can also occur separately from it.\n\nNote: Sometimes a heart attack can masquerade as indigestion. Seek medical attention right away if your indigestion is accompanied by sweating, shortness of breath or a tight, clenching feeling in your upper abdominal area.\n\nHow long does indigestion last?\n\nYou may have symptoms of indigestion for a few minutes to a few hours after eating. It takes 3-5 hours for your stomach to digest a meal before passing it on to your intestines. During that time, your pancreas and gallbladder send bile and enzymes to your stomach to help with digestion. These are the organs in your epigastric region (upper middle abdomen), where indigestion symptoms occur.\n\nWhat causes indigestion?\n\nCauses of occasional indigestion can be simple. For example, many people get indigestion after an especially large or rich meal. That’s easy to explain: your digestive system is working harder than usual to accommodate a heavy load. Your stomach is stretching, your gallbladder and pancreas are contracting, and they’re all producing strong digestive juices, which may be irritating your tissues.\n\nBut indigestion that lasts longer than one meal, or that comes and goes chronically, is often less simple. There may be a variety of factors involved. Sometimes there’s an organic cause, like a disease. And sometimes there’s no obvious cause. This is called functional dyspepsia. Functional GI disorders occur when the nerves in your GI tract are hypersensitized, which lowers your threshold for discomfort.\n\nIn general, causes of indigestion fall into three categories:\n\nYour eating habits.\n\nHow your digestive system is functioning.\n\nYour perception of pain and discomfort.\n\nWhat is the main cause of indigestion?\n\nWhen there’s an organic cause, it usually has to do with stomach acid. Acid causes the telltale burning sensation often described in indigestion. Your stomach has a strong lining designed to protect it from its own acid, but sometimes the lining is worn down. When this happens, it becomes irritated and inflamed by the acid. Inflammation of your stomach lining has other causes, but they’re less common.\n\nSometimes gastric juices escape from your stomach into the top part of your small intestine (duodenum). Your duodenum doesn’t have the same protective lining as your stomach, so acid can do more damage there. Acids can also escape from the top of your stomach into the bottom of your esophagus. This is called acid reflux. Your esophagus isn’t designed to tolerate acid, either.\n\nAcid reflux may explain other symptoms that can come with indigestion, such as burping, regurgitation and heartburn. You can have acid reflux and discomfort in your esophagus even if your stomach lining is still intact. When acid eats away at your stomach lining, though, you have peptic ulcer disease, which can cause ulcers in your stomach and duodenum. Peptic ulcers also cause a burning kind of pain.\n\nPeptic ulcer disease may explain other symptoms that can come with indigestion, such as early satiety (fullness), nausea and bloating. In fact, acid and ulcers are so often the organic causes of chronic indigestion that healthcare providers have come to refer to functional dyspepsia as “non-ulcer dyspepsia”. But overall, functional dyspepsia is more common than any organic cause of indigestion.\n\nWhat are other possible causes?\n\nDiet and lifestyle factors that may contribute to occasional dyspepsia include:\n\nEating too much or too fast. Overeating stretches your stomach and makes it more likely for acid to escape through the top.\n\nToo much fat in your diet. High-fat content triggers more acids and enzymes, which may irritate your tissues.\n\nUnidentified food intolerances. You may be having difficulties digesting certain foods.\n\nSmoking and alcohol use. Both of these substances irritate the mucous lining throughout your GI tract. They can cause inflammation.\n\nOveruse of NSAIDs (like aspirin and ibuprofen). Too many NSAIDs can erode your stomach lining.\n\nStress and anxiety. Your GI tract is intimately connected with your brain through nerves, and each can affect the other.\n\nDiseases and conditions that may be involved in chronic dyspepsia include:\n\nPeptic ulcer disease.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease.\n\nHyperchlorhydria (too much stomach acid).\n\nGastritis (inflammation of your stomach lining).\n\nGastroparesis (slow stomach emptying).\n\nHiatal hernia (your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm).\n\nBacterial overgrowth (in your stomach or small intestine).\n\nEating disorders.\n\nGallstones.\n\nGallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis).\n\nPancreas inflammation (pancreatitis).\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\nCeliac disease.\n\nSmall bowel obstruction.\n\nStomach cancer.\n\nVisceral hypersensitivity.\n\nHow do I relieve indigestion at home?\n\nMany people find indigestion relief from over-the-counter (OTC) antacid medications, like Tums ®, Rolaids ® and Pepto-Bismol ®. Antacids neutralize the acid in your stomach so it doesn’t irritate your tissues. They work well for occasional indigestion when acid is the cause, but you shouldn’t take them too often. If you have chronic indigestion, or if antacids don’t help, you should see a healthcare provider.\n\nDoes drinking water help?\n\nSmall sips of water when you’re experiencing indigestion may help a little. If you have acid reflux in your esophagus, the water may help wash the acid back down into your stomach. If your stomach seems slow to digest and release your food, a little water may help move things along while also diluting the acid. But don’t drink so much that it expands your stomach, or it might have the opposite effect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat medical treatment is available for chronic indigestion?\n\nIf you go to a healthcare provider with chronic indigestion, they’ll ask you about your symptoms, your health history and your diet and lifestyle. They’ll physically examine you to look for any obvious signs of disease. Depending on what they learn, they may want to run some other tests to confirm or rule out a specific condition. Or they may start by prescribing acid-blocking medications to see if they help.\n\nPrescription acid blockers include:\n\nHistamine receptor antagonists (H2 blockers). These medications reduce stomach acid by blocking the chemicals that tell your body to produce it (histamines). You can take them more frequentlythan antacids, but they don’t always work long-term. Your body may adapt to them, making them less effective.\n\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These are stronger acid blockers that also promote the healing of the tissues. Your provider may prescribe these if your symptoms are relatively severe or you have signs of ulcers or other tissue damage in your GI tract. They’re very effective against acid, and you can take them long-term.\n\nOther medications for indigestion may include:\n\nProkinetic agents — medications that speed up your digestive system if it’s sluggish.\n\nAntibiotics — if you have bacterial overgrowth in your stomach or small intestine.\n\nWhat helps indigestion when it’s not acid-related?\n\nIf you have a specific disease, you’ll need specific treatment for it. If you have functional dyspepsia, it can take some trial and error to discover the treatment plan that works for you. Since functional disorders are based in your nervous system, typical medications may not work. But medications that target your nerves, combined with mind-body therapies, have a better chance of succeeding.\n\nWhat can I do to prevent indigestion?\n\nTry not to eat too much at once, and don’t eat dinner too late. Give it time to digest before you lie down. Pay attention to the foods and drinks that trigger your symptoms and reduce them if possible. Some people find that general health measures like getting enough sleep and exercise, managing stress and losing weight helps their indigestion. If you take NSAIDs regularly, consider alternatives."
