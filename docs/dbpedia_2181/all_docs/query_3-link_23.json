        "text": "In what may be our epoch’s most brilliant statement ever on millennial culture, Kim Kardashian is working on a book that will consist purely of her selfies. “Selfish,” to be published by Rizzoli’s Universe imprint, will feature “many never-before-seen personal images,” according to the book’s description, and appears to not be a parody.\n\nBesides being a full-throated celebration of narcissism at its sultriest and most duck-lipped, it could, theoretically, be a moneymaker. Or a work of art that defines our times, apparently:\n\n“Widely regarded as a trailblazer of the “selfie movement”—a modern-day self-portrait of the digital age—Kim has mastered the art of taking flattering and highly personal photos of oneself,” says Rizzoli in its description of the book.\n\nThe $20 book will be 352 pages long and feature close-ups of the starlet’s pouting face on page after page, until each of those pages are filled."
