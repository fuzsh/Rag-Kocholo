James also produced and directed the film.\n\nDave told Variety that he avoided working with his older brother because he wanted to establish his career on his own.\n\n\"For a while, I made a conscious decision not to work with him, just because I wanted to pave my own path,\" he said. \"I didn't want to be referred to as 'James Franco's little brother' for the rest of my life.
