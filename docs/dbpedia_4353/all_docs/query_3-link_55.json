        "text": "VH1 is teaming up with Star Jones for a soapy new drama. In a rare scripted order for the cable network, VH1 announced Thursday that it is adapting the former View panelist’s 2011 novel Satan’s Sisters.\n\nAs the title and Jones’ résumé might lead one to believe, the book and the series follow the antics at a long-running popular ladies’ talk show where “alliances are forged, careers are made and bridges are burned.”\n\n“I’m so excited that Satan’s Sisters, which was such a fun book to write, is finally coming to the small screen,” said Jones, who was infamously let go from The View back in 2006. “I would be lying if I said that Satan’s Sisters wasn’t influenced by the soap opera life of daytime TV, but it is a work of fiction. All the characters are inspired, in parts, by someone I’ve worked with, worked for, interviewed, was interviewed by and/or even prosecuted.”\n\n.\n\nVH1 has been slow to move into the scripted arena, though it is currently airing the third season of Hit the Floor. Satan’s Sisters will be executive produced by Jones, Josh Berman, Suzanne DePasse, Madison Jones and Susan Levison. Amy and Wendy Engelberg, who will also serve as executive producers on the Sony Pictures Television co-production, are writing.\n\n“Daytime TV now comments on and creates pop culture,” said VH1 general manager Chris McCarthy. “Star Jones’ book is the perfect project for VH1 and our partners to bring to life.”"
