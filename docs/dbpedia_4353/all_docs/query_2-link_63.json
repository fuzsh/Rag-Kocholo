        "text": "VH1 is backing alternative rock band Morningwood - Pedro Yanowitz and sexy singer Chantal Claret - whose song \"Best of Me\" is the theme for VH1's Daisy of Love.\n\nExecutives in the music and/or television business said the MTV Networks outlet pitched the band to join a new music label the network is planning - diving into the troubled music industry, leveraging the exposure it can provide.\n\n\"Artists would go into business with VH1 for the promotion,\" one industry executive who heard the plans told The Wire, quietly. \"VH1 is giving artists promotion, so why not get more? If VH1 can carve out a few million from artists, that moves the needle.\"\n\nThat exec said VH1 was going after major label-type artists - unlike VH1 Classic Records, which signs bands (Kiss, Thin Lizzy) big labels are done with. Morningwood, which was said to be dropped by Capitol, is a template.\n\nThe Morningwood page on Wikipedia (not the most reliable source) says the band \"recently signed with VH1 as the first artist on the newly formed VH1 Records.\" The Answers.com page about the band also cites VH1 Records.\n\nA VH1 rep, though, says there are no plans for a VH1 Records, just a one-off deal to promote Morningwood's upcoming release. Checking around, The Wire found some Morningwood interviews on VH1.com, and Morningwood performed at sister channel Logo's NewNowNext Awards in June.\n\nEfforts to reach the band were unsuccessful. Its MySpace page lists its label as Capitol Records, though sources say that relationship ended. Capitol's Web site has the band on a list of artists but has no other info."
