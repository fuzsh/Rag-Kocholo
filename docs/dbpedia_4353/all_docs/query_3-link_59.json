        "text": "Fans of Emmy-nominated actress Tichina Arnold remember her for roles on comedic sitcoms such as Martin and Everybody Hates Chris. However, it looks like the veteran actress is expanding her resume once more with another television role. According to Deadline, Tichina Arnold has joined the cast of Satan’s Sisters, VH1’s new drama series. Based on the book of the same name by former View co-host Star Jones, the series will star Vanessa Williams as Maxine, the host of a popular talk show.\n\nREAD: Tichina Arnold Lands Best Friend Role In New Sitcom ‘Happily Divorced’\n\nArnold will star as Mo, one of Maxine’s fellow co-hosts. Set behind the scenes of a long running daytime talk show, the program will chronicle the professional relationships and workplace camaraderie (or lack thereof) between five female talk show hosts. Aside from the addition of Arnold and Williams, Satan’s Sisters will also star Hit The Floor actor McKinley Freeman, Chloe Bridges and Camille Guaty."
