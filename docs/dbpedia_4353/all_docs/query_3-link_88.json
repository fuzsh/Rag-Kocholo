        "text": "Originally Posted by Raymond Stereo\n\nI'm curious if anyone here's been watching VH1 since before \"Celebreality\", before their \"100/50\" Best/Worst/Most\" countdowns, before their \"I Love The\" series........hell, even before \"Pop-Up Video\" (so glad they still air that on VH1 Classic!) and \"Behind The Music\".\n\nWhen I first started actively listening to music as a kid in the late '90's (1997 to be exact), I remember first tuning to VH1. At the time, MTV was knee-deep into \"shiny suit\" Hip-Hop and techno/trance music, which was all one big WTF to me. I preferred the lighter, adult Top 40 selection of VH1. I remember getting crap from my friends for listening to \"white boy\" music, but I didn't care. I recall VH1 airing music from several artists that either didn't or wouldn't have gotten airtime on MTV during it's \"shiny suit\" period. Not a single Hip-Hop song in sight, and even R&B was rare (once a week, late Saturday nights on their \"VH1 Soul\" block.......that was it!). MTV: Puff Daddy & Mase. VH1: Loreena McKennitt.\n\nAs they reached the new millenium, they started adding more Rock & Pop artists (though not to the extent of the stuff airing on \"TRL\" at the time) which was great for diversity. But I remember, sometime in late 2002, when the channel was close to re-branding (from their now-classic \"1\" logo to that hot mess of a cube logo) seeing Hip-Hop videos for the first time on the network. It just blew my mind........in a bad way. At the time I didn't realize that this was simply the fate of many a cable TV network, but seeing Missy Elliot's \"Work It\" on VH1, a channel that sort of prided itself on being different from big brother MTV for so long, cave in like that saddened me...........for about a week or two, and then I saw the first \"I Love the '80's\" installment and quickly forgot about it.\n\nFor those who've been watching VH1, then and now, do you think it's changed for the better? People have seemingly argued about MTV's lack of music videos for close to 20 years now (the network's 28 BTW), and those who were there from the start often wax nostalgia about \"the good old days\". Did VH1 ever have that following, or was it really a channel that few watched for most of its life?"
