MTV and Nick, the other two channels in the group, are already with the TheOneAlliance bouquet.\n\nTalking of the transition, Sanjev Hiremath, senior vice-president, network development, SA–MTV Networks, says, “Over the last two years, VH1 was available on the Zee-Turner platform. It has a viewership of 20 million households in India. VH1 is now migrating to the TheOneAlliance platform. As India’s only international music channel, VH1 is sure to augment TheOneAlliance’s offering.”\n\nKunal Dasgupta, CEO, SET India, and chairman, SET Discovery, says: “With the addition of VH1, viewers will now enjoy music and lifestyle, too, and this will complete the all-inclusive entertainment package of TheOneAlliance bouquet. This partnership will mark a landmark deal and mutually benefit VH1 and TheOneAlliance by offering an incremental viewer base.”\n\nSET Discovery Private Ltd is a joint venture between SET India and Discovery Communications. The company was set up in April 2002. Today, the company distributes 15 channels under the brand name of TheOneAlliance to more than 61 million homes in 4,000 cities and towns across India."
