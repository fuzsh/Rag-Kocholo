        "text": "Originally posted by Kaiser2000\n\nWell I agree with the posters here that music channels should be about MUSIC.... take MTV - Cribs, Jackass etc etc - VERY little music nowadays.\n\nAnd yea, screen junk is very annoying - especially that love match thing on whatever channel it's on - but that leads me to my next point and maybe partly why these channels are so \"samey\" (aside from the fact that they're owned by the same 2/3 major companies)... no viewer loyalty.\n\nIf I have a half hour to kill, I just flip back and forth between the 15/20 of em until I find somethin I like..when thats over if the next track isn't to my taste, I switch channels again.. I'd say a lot of viewers are like this so as a result theres no consistent ratings = less advertising revenue = no budget = lots of reruns and \"borrowing\" from sister channels and \"gimmicks\" to attempt to draw in viewers, ultimately annoying those same viewers who just wanna see a video!\n\nCourse I could be completely wrong?\n\nOriginally posted by planetnokia\n\nHow much did VH1 pay Mr Marketing Man for their new logo - it's pants.\n\nHave you notice how small VH1 playlist is and how all their guest presenters always select the same videos.....Police (Walking on the Moon Again) Dexys Midtnite Runners (The Denim Overall Song) Gloria Flippin Bleedn Gaynor (The Rollerskate Song) and so on and so on and so on and so on....Hell i'm switching to Channel 664...."
