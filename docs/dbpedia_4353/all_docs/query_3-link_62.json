        "text": "He and Chance appeared together on two seasons of Real Chance of Love, starting in 2008. They had made their reality show debuts on the VH1 dating series I Love New York in 2007 and also starred in Real and Chance: The Legend Hunters in 2010. Real also appeared on the cable network's show I Love Money.\n\nReal had felt ill in January 2013, suffering flu-like symptoms, and was misdiagnosed several times before he was told in March 2013 that he had stage 4 colon cancer. He told UrbanDaily.com in early 2014 that his doctor was too emotional to deliver the news and that another one did so in her place, telling him, \"You have about two weeks to live. I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do for you.\"\n\nReal told the website that his mother was with him at the time and that he had to call his wife and tell her the news, which was the hardest part.\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, he penned a moving tribute to his wife on Instagram, saying, \"If it wasn't for this beautiful woman, I don't know where if be or if I would be doing as well as I'm doing.\"\n\nHe underwent chemotherapy and at least two surgeries to remove cancerous cells in his colon and liver. He was also treated for a brain tumor, according to UrbanDaily.com.\n\n\"God was number one and my family was number two,\" he said. \"God just really blessed me with abreast strong support system. I just kept a positive outlook. And on those days when I was down, I didn't let anybody see that because I didn't want them to get down. My son kept me going because I knew he needed me and I needed him so I fought to be here for him.\""
