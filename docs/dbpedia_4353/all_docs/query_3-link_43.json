        "text": "Good decision to formally re-launch the channel, but it really needs to move into the Entertainment section of the EPG on Virgin Media like it has done on Sky, otherwise it will fail to get noticed on there.\n\nTechnically speaking on Virgin 4Music is still in its original EPG despite the UKTV dispute, I don't think Virgin are that bothered about these channels where they are.\n\nWell technically speaking in regards to VH1 going full on reality - they tried this back in the 00s and it failed so I guess they are giving it another go ... so what happens if it fails again? Does VH1 go under MTV or shall we expect it back to music once more? (I rather be proved wrong in any case).\n\nI just don't understand the turnround on VH1 with this lot they couldn't give a damn about it when it was a music channel but now they are trying it with reality (once more), I still think it'll be promoted/cross promoted for 6 months once it dies down it'll be back to square 1 ... lets all go to MTV....\n\n0\n\nI'm surprised they're bothering here. VH1 feels like a completely dead brand in the UK. They should call it something else.\n\nGive it time they'll rebrand it MTV something ... VH1 Classic has went as MTV Classic these days ... but you are right VH1 is pretty much dead in the UK...\n\nYawn. Same argument over and over again. Change the record...\n\nOh give it a break...\n\nWell lets see then what was TMF? TMF had changed to VIVA they got rid of that and it went to .... oh look MTV (OMG), you can't tell me this won't happen seems predictable to me.\n\nAnother VH1 Classic - rebranded to ... MTV Classic ... so what chance does VH1 actually have as a brand in the UK? They clearly seem to be alarm bells ringing that they need to do something with VH1 in the UK now since its decline but of course its deja vu once more -- lets go back to reality programming so what happens if this fails? Will we expect it back to music or be rebranded MTV (save face than closing it)? For someone like you to criticise what I say is unbelivable, everyone is entitled to opinions so why not you respect my opinion as I respect yours??\n\n0\n\nGood decision to formally re-launch the channel, but it really needs to move into the Entertainment section of the EPG on Virgin Media like it has done on Sky, otherwise it will fail to get noticed on there.\n\nTechnically speaking on Virgin 4Music is still in its original EPG despite the UKTV dispute, I don't think Virgin are that bothered about these channels where they are.\n\nWell technically speaking in regards to VH1 going full on reality - they tried this back in the 00s and it failed so I guess they are giving it another go ... so what happens if it fails again?

Given that it still has MUSIC in its name Virgin Media are right to leave it where it is. VH1 is a very different matter.\n\nSo does VH1 for now in its current position, I brought this up as at the time 4Music whilst it was in its original slot it had moved to 129 (somewhere like that), So whats the difference between VH1 and 4Music? - just now VH1 has 6 hours of music - 4Music - is more of a general setup music by day programming by evening but at weekends they have shows on at 1pm in between its shows, generally 4Music is basically like VH1.\n\nWhat does a channel have music got to do with its postion? MTV doesn't stand much for music these days it only has one you can get away with calling music and thats MTV MUSIC. So why has 4Music and VH1 moved on Sky if in general they are not in a MUSIC section but more of ENTERTAINMENT??\n\n4Music has shows like King of the hill on at the moment so what relation is that show to do with MUSIC??\n\n0\n\nI'm surprised they're bothering here.

For someone like you to criticise what I say is unbelivable, everyone is entitled to opinions so why not you respect my opinion as I respect yours??\n\nYou are completely missing the point.\n\nIt's the right decision.\n\nThe music video channel genre has been in decline for a very long time and MTV has plenty of others.\n\nVH1 UK will now align with the US channel and allow for greater content sharing and brand development.\n\nThey need to get VH1 UK a presence on social media by the time it re-launches.\n\nWhy is it the right direction? I remember VH1 in the 00s it didn't last long it was tried and tested - you seem to forget this was even done on TMF/VIVA - the channel moved from music to entertainment to then be reverted back to music.\n\nVH1 UK will align with VH1 US with greater content and brand development ... right then if you believe that you believe anything.... whats currently on VH1 at the moment? old MTV/BBC 3 shows and the odd Channel 5 programme - thats not great content thats basically the same content you could throw on MTV! However VH1 UK is that slow behind VH1 US it doesn't surprise me these days (it took them long enough to give VH1 a makeover well past the US). They'll say this but its just another filler channel full of reality content (as if there isn't plenty out there), pity that Viacom seem to say they realise potential for VH1 they really need to give Comedy Central a shake up too.\n\nVH1 UK and social media: not trying to be funny but this should have been done at the same time whilst MTV UK has had its presence on social media with its shows but like you know they never thought it out but as mentioned before they let the channel rot/decline but if we are to take their word for it realised that all this change will give it a boost (yes where was the boost for it prior?), its just a marketing gimmick here had they really cared for VH1 I would agree but since I was more of VH1 viewer to MTV it doesn't surprise me the depths of it now and its finally scraping barrels. This is just a setup and I think it won't last - VH1 will probably and eventually go under .... MTV Shows... wait that too was done!.\n\nVH1 in general is just going to be used as a secondary channel for repeats, i'll guess that Fresh Prince will appear next? Oh why not its a programme thats been thrown around the whole Viacom network so why not just bring it to VH1? Its that predictable coming from Viacom they say they'll improve the channel content and its not (fine its not my liking) but really do we need these channels? Why not for one since VH1 is also subscription based that this lot (Viacom/MTV UK) drop the teleshopping for starters?\n\n0"
