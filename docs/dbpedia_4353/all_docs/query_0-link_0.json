        "text": "American pay television network\n\nTelevision channel\n\nBET Soul (formally VH1 Soul) is an American pay television network that debuted on August 1, 1998, and is currently owned by Paramount Global's BET Media Group. The channel showcases R&B, funk, soul, neo soul, hip hop, jazz and Motown music from various decades.\n\nSoul was originally a commercial-free service, along with sister channel VH1 Smooth, and part of the \"MTV Digital Suite\" of digital cable channels (which was sold only to cable providers to give them an advantage over satellite services). The first video shown on the channel was \"Boogie Wonderland\" by Earth, Wind & Fire.[1]\n\nOn December 28, 2015, management of the channel was moved to BET Networks. It was subsequently rebranded as BET Soul that same day, and became a sister channel to BET.[2] The move would be part of a series of programming and management shifts within then-parent company Viacom in the coming years.[3] In 2019, the legacy assets of Viacom and CBS Corporation would be reunited in a merger between the two companies that lead to the formation of ViacomCBS, later to be rebranded as Paramount Global.\n\nOn November 9, 2022, oversight of VH1 would move to the later-renamed BET Media Group. The move reunited the two networks, while also splitting them from MTV and its other formerly-branded sibling channels (VH1 Classic and VH1 Country).[4]"
