        "text": "DJ Soul Sister is an internationally-known, veteran DJ artist, whose broadcast programs and live performances feature her personal collection of thousands of vinyl records, which earned her a spot in the book Dust & Grooves: Adventures in Record Collecting.\n\nA native of New Orleans, Soul Sister has hosted her Soul Power show on WWOZ FM New Orleans for 25 years (as of 2020), and has hosted internationally-aired radio programs on Sonos Radio and Worldwide FM, among others. She has been a crate digger and vinyl collector ever since she was six years old.\n\nAnd as a DJ artist who self-produced her first event in 1997, her infamous sets and parties (such as the HUSTLE! party) led to her tenure as one of the longest-running DJ artists in her hometown. Notably, her sets only feature the music she loves, as she improvisationally and skillfully mixes, blends, and beat-matches vinyl-only selections of 1970s – mid-1980s R&B, funk, soul, rare groove, underground disco, jazz fusion, true school hip hop, and more.\n\nAs a performance DJ, she is the first to win New Orleans’ prestigious Big Easy Entertainment Award for “Best DJ.” She has also performed everywhere from the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, Voodoo Music Experience, Essence Music Festival (2008-2010 and the festival’s first-ever mainstage DJ), BUKU Music & Art Project, Jam Cruise, Boiler Room, and Electric Forest. Soul Sister has opened for many of her favorite artists like George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic, The Roots, Bootsy Collins, Maceo Parker, DaM-FunK, Average White Band, George Duke, Teena Marie, Doug E. Fresh, ConFunkShun, the funky Meters, Dumpstaphunk, Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers, Soul Rebels, Lettuce, Tower of Power, and more; and has also performed alongside DJ artist/producers such as Questlove, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Mannie Fresh, KON, Maseo (De La Soul), Low Down Loretta Brown (Erykah Badu), Rich Medina, Biz Markie, and others. She was even personally invited by George Clinton to DJ his 71st birthday party. Music artist Solange called her “wonderful” and “life given,” and dj artist King Britt said she was “the best…top 3 DJs for me.”\n\nSoul Sister’s mission is to share music, and is equally dedicated to educating about music, both as a writer/researcher and as a university lecturer."
