        "text": "VH1, with its slate of celebrity love series and outrageous reality fare, is looking to revamp its lineup and slowly move away from series like \"Flavor of Love,\" the Hollywood Reporter reports.\n\nThe network is prepping to launch 44 new series before the end of the year, with each show falling into three categories: music, celebrity or \"real-life stories.\"\n\nAmong the 44 series: New episodes of \"Behind the Music\" and \"Storytellers.\"\n\nAccording to the article, \"As much as they’ve enjoyed the ‘Love’ franchise, our audience was getting a little fatigued by all those manufactured reality shows,\" said Tom Calderone, president, VH1. \"They want more authenticity in their reality, which isn’t to say that it can’t be comedic and light.\"\n\nShows gearing up for launch include \"You’re Cut Off!,\" about cleaning up nine party girls, and \"Money Hungry,\" which revolves around contestant losing $10,000 of their own money if they don’t shed their excess weight."
