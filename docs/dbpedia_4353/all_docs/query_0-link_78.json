        "text": "Maybe it’s time for Christina Norman to lease that Volvo and try on those Birkenstocks for size.\n\nLongtime MTV exec Norman \"Is That You?\" has been named to the top role at VH1 as Executive Vice President and General Manager by MTV Networks Music Group President Judy McGrath, to whom she’ll report in the N.Y.-based position.\n\nPreviously MTV Sr. VP Marketing and On-Air Promotion, Norman will now be responsible for the day-to-day leadership, strategy and management of VH1. In addition to guiding the channel from a creative and branding standpoint, Christina has ultimate responsibility for marketing, on-air promotion, finance, communications, research, human resources, business development and digital services, including VH1 Classic, VH1 Mega Hits, VH Uno and VH1 Soul. She will also immediately assume John Sykes’ credit line at Barneys. The veteran MTV exec left VH1 last month to assume the Chairmanship of Infinity Radio (see hitsdailydouble.com, 3/15/02). Brian Phillips continues to head up CMT.\n\nNorman joined MTV Networks in 1991 as a Production Manager. She has held a number of posts at the channel, including her most recent job, which entails responsibility for the on- and off-air marketing, branding and positioning for MTV, MTV2 and MTV.com. She oversaw the channel’s On-Air Promoitons, Advertising and Affiliate Marketing departments and was responsible for the short-form visual packaging and design of the network, including the campaigns to launch The Osbournes (featuring Jack Black) and brand 10 Spot, MTV’s longest running programming destination.\n\nCommented McGrath: \"Christina is a tremendously creative executive who has a great strategic understanding for connecting with consumers, combined with a great feel for how to brand and position a network. In her 11 years at MTV, she’s proven to be a fantastic leader of creative people—cultivating an environment where they can produce their absolute best work. And she’s the only one who knows the current whereabouts of Dominic Griffin for our next Real World reunion.\"\n\nAdded MTV Networks Chairman/CEO Tom Freston: \"I can’t think of a better choice to lead VH1 into the future. Christina is a most gifted, creative executive and has helped make MTV just about the smartest and most distinctive network out there. She will now bring her many talents to VH1. And I can’t wait for her Behind the Music segment on A Flock of Seagulls.\"\n\nChristina will work closely with Judy McGrath on developing the programming strategy for VH1and finding a place to dump all those leftover Late World with Zach T-shirts."
