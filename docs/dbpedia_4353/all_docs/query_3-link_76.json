But behind the scenes, they are “Satan’s Sisters” — a backstage world filled with power struggles, personal demons, diva fits, love affairs, man troubles, cat fights…and cocktails.\n\nExecutive producers for the series are Josh Berman (“Drop Dead Diva,” “CSI”), Star Jones, Suzanne DePasse (“The Temptations,” “Lonesome Dove”) & Madison Jones, and Susan Levison. Writers for the series are Amy Engelberg and Wendy Engelberg who also serve as executive producers. The series is a co-production with Sony Pictures Television.\n\n“I’m so excited that ‘Satan’s Sisters,’ which was such a fun book to write, is finally coming to the small screen,” said Star Jones. “I would be lying if I said that ‘Satan’s Sisters’ wasn’t influenced by the soap opera life of daytime TV but it is a work of fiction. All the characters are inspired, in parts, by someone I’ve worked with, worked for, interviewed, was interviewed by and/or even prosecuted.”\n\n“Daytime TV now comments on and creates pop culture,” said Chris McCarthy, General Manager, VH1. “Star Jones’ book is the perfect project for VH1 and our partners to bring to life.”\n\nThe series will continue VH1’s momentum in the scripted arena. The network recently gave the series greenlight for its critically acclaimed original movie “The Breaks” which was seen by 2.6 million total viewers on its January 4 premiere night and ranked #1 in its time period among adults 18-34. The third season of “Hit The Floor,” currently airing on Monday nights, premiered last month as the #1 non-sports cable program in its time period among women 18-49, women 18-34 and adults 18-34.\n\nVH1 is the dominant pop culture brand for adults 18-34, creating their pop culture today while celebrating the pop culture of their past. VH1 is available in 93 million households in the U.S. VH1 also programs full episode and short form video plus pop culture and lifestyle editorial content on all major digital platforms and devices including vh1.com, @vh1, Facebook.com/vh1, and the VH1 app for iOS and Android. VH1 is a unit of Viacom Inc. (NASDAQ: VIA, VIAB), one of the world’s leading creators of programming and content across all media platforms.
