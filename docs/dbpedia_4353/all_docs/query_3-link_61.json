        "text": "Meagan Alexander had her doubts about undertaking a major project with her four sisters. But in the end, togetherness won out.\n\n\"I figured that's the time to be with my family, which I love, so why not take the chance?\" says the metro Detroit assistant store manager and nursing student.\n\nSo what did she embark upon with her siblings? A Caribbean cruise? A new business? A cross-country family reunion?\n\nTry a sister-themed reality TV show.\n\nOxygen's \"It Takes a Sister,\" which airs at 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays, is the latest in a television subgenre that takes a female-centric look at familial ties.\n\nThe mother of all sister shows, of course, is E!'s \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\" Focused largely on the lives of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney (and, in recent seasons, Kendall and Kylie Jenner), it spawned an empire of branded products, show spin-offs and tabloid coverage that has yet to let up.\n\nThere is also WE's \"Braxton Family Values,\" which chronicles Grammy winner Toni Braxton and her singing sisters, Towanda, Traci, Trina and Grammy nominee Tamar. While the Braxtons have a lot of fun together, they also let viewers in on their personal dramas and marital problems.\n\n\"It Takes a Sister\" brings a younger, more energetic and chaotic vibe to sister reality. The best-known cast member is Nikki Alexander, a.k.a. \"Hoopz,\" who originally hails from metro Detroit. A reality TV veteran, she became famous as the past winner of VH1's \"Flavor of Love\" and \"I Love Money.\"\n\nThe show, which premiered Aug. 4, follows what happens when Nikki, the oldest, temporarily moves her four sisters — Jenni, Erika, Kortnee and Meagan — and their eight children into one big house in Tennessee.\n\nOh, and did we mention the cast includes Dre —Meagan's ex-boyfriend and the father of her 5-year-old son — who is employed as Nikki's personal assistant?\n\nIn the first episode, a fight erupted during a dinner over a twerking video that Meagan had posted online. \"World War III is finally approaching us,\" said Kortnee, who focused on her spaghetti instead of the argument.\n\nEpisode two brought a yard sale of useless items left by ex-boyfriends, including shorts from Nikki's ex Shaquille O'Neal. Erika helpfully modeled a pair of underwear (or make that not-so-helpfully, since she added some racy stuffing).\n\nWith its mix of humor and squabbling, \"It Takes a Sister\" can be compulsively watchable. But to the sisters involved, it's been a chance to spend time together and to prove that, no matter what conflict ensues, sisters stick together through thick and thin.\n\n\"Things are great. I would say it's the way it's always been,\" says Meagan Alexander, 26, of her current relationship with her sisters. \"Even with all the adversity with the show, all the negative comments and everything, we try to uplift each other and keep that bond strengthened.\"\n\nMeagan, who lives in metro Detroit, works as an assistant retail store manager and is getting a nursing degree with the goal of pursuing a career in anesthesiology.\n\nThe youngest of the sisters, Meagan says the show hasn't changed her life. \"In my mind, even before we went out and filmed the show, I told myself that was going to be the outcome. Fame means nothing to me. What's important to me is building a future for me and my child. That's what I'm focusing on now.\"\n\nAlthough the series often portrays what Meagan calls \"baby mama drama\" surrounding the tensions with her ex-boyfriend, she describes herself as \"the least dramafied one\" of the family.\n\n\"I think it's just because I keep my distance and I know what needs to be done in life to be where I need to be. And I'm willing to do that.\"\n\nMeagan's favorite episode so far has concerned the throwing of a Halloween party. \"We take pride in holidays and we go all out. There's no negativity. We're all just having fun. It was awesome.\"\n\nThat's the same episode where Jenni Alexander, 32, was trying to create a Zen mood for a client of her at-home massage business, but kept getting interrupted by loud, running, happy children. \"This guy would have been better off getting a massage at a playground or a Chuck E. Cheese,\" commented Dre.\n\nThe second-oldest sister, Jenni is also living now in metro Detroit with her three children, who are 11, 8 and 4. She's busy getting them ready for the three different schools they attend and she's planning to restart her massage business soon.\n\nShe thinks the show has revealed how hilarious the Alexander sisters are, much like the Braxtons. \"We are all goofy, period,\" she says.\n\nJenni says she doesn't do \"the alliance thing\" with her sisters. \"I love all of them equally,\" she stresses. And that, ultimately — not the squabbling or the hectic house — is the message she thinks is important to \"It Takes a Sister.\"\n\n\"The best thing about doing it was knowing that the world will see me and my sisters and how much we really are down to earth, loving, being there for each other no matter what and the fact we all get to come together again, our kids get to be together,\" says Jenni. \"No matter what happens with it, it's something we'll never forget.\"\n\nContact Detroit Free Press writer Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.\n\n'It Takes a Sister'\n\n9:30 p.m. Tuesdays\n\nOxygen"
