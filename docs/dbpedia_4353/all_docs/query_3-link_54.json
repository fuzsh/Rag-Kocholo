        "text": "By Pretty Honore\n\nPublished Dec. 21 2023, 8:39 a.m. ET\n\nThe Gist:\n\nThe popular VH1 reality series Real Chance of Love was a spinoff of Tiffany Pollard’s I Love New York.\n\nReal Chance of Love stars Ahmad \"Real\" Givens and Kamal \"Chance\" Givens disappeared from the spotlight and fans want to know why.\n\nReal faced a tragic fate while Chance returned to reality TV.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe 2000s were a marvelous time to be alive thanks to the reality TV content that was available at the time.\n\nAlong with dating shows like The Bachelor and A Shot at Love With Tila Tequila, The Flavor of Love changed the landscape of unscripted television. The series paved the way for endless spinoffs — one of which was I Love New York.\n\nThe show saw two-time first-runner-up Flavor of Love contestant Tiffany “New York” Pollard look for a love of her own after being dumped twice by Flavor Flav.\n\nAmong the cast members who appeared on I Love New York were Ahmad and Chance Givens (aka Real and Chance), a charming pair of brothers who were at war for the same woman.\n\nAt the end of I Love New York, neither Real nor Chance were able to win over Tiffany’s heart — thus the reality series A Real Chance of Love was born.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe spinoff dating series, which premiered in 2008, aired for two seasons before it went off-air. Not long after, the brothers seemingly disappeared from the spotlight. So, where are the siblings now? Read on for the truth.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhere are the ‘Real Chance of Love’ guys now?\n\nA Real Chance of Love came to an end in 2008, but Real and Chance's TV fame didn’t end there. In 2010, they filmed 10 episodes of a much lesser-known series on VH1 called Real & Chance: The Legend Hunters.\n\nThey also continued to pursue their career as rappers under their label, The Stallionaires. However, their dreams were brought to a halt when Real was diagnosed with a terminal illness.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHere’s the truth about Ahmad “Real” Givens’s cause of death.\n\nReal was first diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer in 2013. Things were looking up for the reality star after he had surgery until two years later when the cancer came back with a vengeance.\n\nUltimately, his chemotherapy treatments weren't successful and Real died in February 2015. Needless to say, his brother took his death pretty hard.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhat is Kamal “Chance” Givens up to these days? Here’s an update.\n\nFollowing his brother’s death, Chance stayed out of the spotlight for some time. He didn’t return to the small screen until 2020 when he made his debut in the Zeus original series One Mo’ Chance.\n\nAccording to the series synopsis, One Mo' Chance saw the reality star deal with everything from “his relationship with the mother of his children to the death of his brother and partner, Real.”\n\n“However, the original Stallionaire is now ready to get back on his horse to give love another shot,” the series description adds.\n\nSince Season 2 of the One Mo' Chance wrapped, Chance has seemingly gone back to the single life and spends his spare time with his horses, who make frequent appearances on his Instagram feed."
