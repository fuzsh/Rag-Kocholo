        "text": "“If you lose money for the firm, I will be very understanding. If you lose reputation for the firm, I will be ruthless.” Warren Buffet\n\nDear VH1:\n\nThis quote from Warren Buffet explains the outrage you have unleashed over the airing of Sorority Sisters, a reality show featuring the stereotypical depiction of women as callous, petty, jealous, violent and amoral. But this time, the women are members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. There are tens of thousands of women globally whose reputation (brand) is directly or indirectly tied to their commitment to service and sisterhood by virtue of having pledged Delta Sigma Theta Sorority (myself included). Simply put, your depiction of the Sorority is bad for the brand.\n\nIncreasingly it appears that the entertainment industry has a warped definition of “entertaining”. You regularly demonstrate disdain for the very viewers you cultivate by producing shows featuring human behavior at its worst. The quest for dollars has clouded your judgment. This cocktail of factors offers the only explanation for why you’ve elected to persist in airing Sorority Sisters despite immense opposition.\n\nGiven the volume of trashy reality shows why did this one strike a cord? Because unlike a franchise such as \"Real Housewives\" or \"Basketball Wives\" where an individual decides to make \"bad girl\" the cornerstone of their personal brand; the star of Sorority Sisters isn’t the miscellaneous faces on the screen. The star is Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and by default all African-American sororities and fraternities. We won’t tolerate your attempt to profit at the expense of a long, proud legacy of scholarship and community service. Fortunately, 51 advertisers (and counting) agree and have pulled their dollars.\n\nI realize to you it’s “just business”. A quick Google search of Robert Horowitz, Toby Barraud, Susan Levison, Nina L. Diaz and the other producers of the show uncovers that you’ve built your reputation by producing “unscripted” programming depicting over the top and often uncouth behavior by people grasping for their 15 minutes of fame. I understand that in your industry bad behavior is good for business. You probably think of yourself as starmakers; helping people gain notoriety by being the loudest, meanest, or bitchiest person in the room. In actuality at its best it is exploitation. And at its worst, your programming is toxic perpetuating negative stereotypes of African-American's in general and women in particular.\n\nFrom a marketing perspective; your lack of understanding about your target is embarrassing. Hubris allowed you to assemble a team with a lack of knowledge about the culture or organizations you are presenting. This kept you from appreciating the significance of a 100 year old organization whose first act of service was participating in the Women's Suffrage March in Washington, DC in 1913. You were oblivious to the conviction of a large body of educated, well organized and passionate women who care deeply about what our sorority represents.\n\nFrom a business perspective; I know that buzz can build brands. But all brands are not created equal. VH1 has demonstrated that it does not distinguish between good and bad buzz in the quest to drive awareness. You cultivate controversy anticipating that the potential for ratings is higher than the outrage.\n\nThe reality TV formula focuses on the fringe of society. The novel. You bet on any outrage being contained because the size of the group being portrayed negatively is small. Just how many Mob Wives are on Twitter? Is the up and coming rap artist community going to threaten boycotts over K. Michelle? No. You bank on the offended being few but the curiosity seekers being many. Any resulting outrage only fuels the buzz thereby driving the curious to tune in.\n\nYou thought this formula would hold up when you approved Sorority Sisters. You thought you had another Love and Hip Hop. Did the conversation go something like this: Atlanta? Check. Young demographic? Check. Predominantly female cast? Check. African-American? Check. From there, finding a handful of individuals willing to debase themselves for a shot at becoming a household name wasn’t difficult. Add contrived scenarios with skillful editing and you surely had a hit in the making. But you got it wrong. Really, really wrong.\n\nSadly you underestimated the star of the show. It’s not the misguided young ladies you sought to exploit. It’s Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and by default the entire Black Greek network including our family and friends. Your show is bad for the brand; the Sorority's and every member past and present that proudly proclaims association.\n\nAnd as Warren Buffet stated, damage the brand…and we will be ruthless. Please cancel Sorority Sisters.\n\nI welcome comments. If you agree with this post, please \"like\" and repost."
