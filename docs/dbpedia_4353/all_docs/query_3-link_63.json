It garnered instant popularity as it was the only game in town to launch, market and expose new indie Music Videos on traditional TV. After three successful seasons IndiMusic TV broadened their horizons by launching a world wide mobile TV network partnering with Yamgo TV, a mobile TV start up in the UK. In September 2012, IndiMusic TV launched as the first 24-7 independent only Worldwide Music Video TV channel and Musician Social Network.\n\nThe site was founded by Chris Pati, a musical genius who began at 5 years old playing piano, guitar, bass and drums, and established himself as a multi-instrumental prodigy by age eight. Chris wrote his first Piano piece at age seven and was playing Grade 6 N.Y.S.S.M.A. Piano music by the likes of Liszt, Chopin and Rachmaninoff by age 9. Chris was playing professionally by the age of 13 and subbed for famed session drummer Steve Gadd at age 16. This is quite impressive in itself, but Chris went on to become even more well known for his blazing ability on guitar when after many years of producing records, he released several highly acclaimed blues records on his own label Modern Voices Records. Chris has also spent time guest conducting for various National Symphony Orchestras such as The Louisville Orchestra and the Arlington Symphony. He has also arranged all the Herman’s Hermits hits for symphony and acts as Peter Noone’s Musical Director for all of his symphonic shows. Through his success as a Solo Artist, Producer and Label Owner, he has gone on to have over a dozen top 20 Billboard hits and his Modern Voices Records was named a TOP 10 Label by Billboard in 1997. He parlayed that success into a Major Label distribution deal with Island/Def Jam. Chris, as a musician and businessman, has always been ahead of the curve. Back in 1981 he was already refining the home project studio and fifteen years later he foresaw the demise of the brick and mortar music business. Thus, he decided to focus strictly on Digital Distribution and create and promote Digital Content. He created a digital store and website in 1995 at a time when the music industry was not ready for such a new business model. Most recently, Chris was honored by Berry Gordy (former President of Motown Records), who called on Chris to arrange and perform an impromptu medley of “America the Beautiful” and “Lift Up Your Hearts And Voices” for opera star and actress N’kenge at President Obama’s 2009 Inaugural Ball."
