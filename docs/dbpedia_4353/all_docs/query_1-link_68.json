You’ll find 30 memorable images in the slide show above — just click on that classic shot of the original VJs to get started — and once you’ve taken a spin through it come back here and let us know your favorite MTV memories.\n\nYou can also spend the weekend on sister channel VH1 Classic, which will air a three-day tribute called “MTV30 on VH1 Classic,” which will include at midnight on Sunday a replay of the first-ever hour of original programming on MTV. (You may well know that the first video played was the Buggles’ “Video Killed The Radio Star,” but can you tell us what else played that first hour without looking? The answer is at the end of the slide show above.)\n\nThe VH1 weekend also will include clips from shows such as “Remote Control,” “YO! MTV Raps,” Beavis and Butt-Head,” “Headbangers Ball,” “The Real World,” “Liquid TV” and “Club MTV.” They’ll also show highlights from the MTV Movie Awards, the Video Music Awards, Live Aid and more.\n\nYou want your MTV? You get those original promos and a whole lot more this weekend.\n\nPREVIOUSLY FROM PEDRO"
