        "text": "VH1 or Video Hits 1 is the 24-hour music channel of India. It has the appropriate music for the apt music lover. Vh1 connects its audience to music through a wealth of original international and local programming that explores and celebrates the power of the music, artists and pop culture. VH1 basically takes off where MTV leaves!\n\nWarner Amex Satellite Entertainment and the owners of MTV created the channel in the year 1985. VH1's aim was to focus on the lighter, softer side of popular music, including such musicians as Tina Turner, Elton John, Sting, Diana Ross, Kenny G, and Anita Baker, in hopes of appealing to people aged 18 to 35, and possibly older. VH1 has always been branded as an urban version of MTV India. It played more jazz and R&B artists than MTV and had a higher rotation of urban-contemporary performers.\n\nIn India, VH1 is collaboration of MTV India and Zee-Turner, the distribution arm of Zee Telefilms and Turner International India. It was launched in the year 2005. In India, VH1 is a 24-hour pay channel that caters to the 16-44 SEC AB demographic and it plays International music. VH1 India's exhaustive range of classic videos covers international genres from pure Rock to unadulterated Pop and everything in between. The launch of VH1 in India represents a new milestone reflecting the rapid growth of the nation and the development in the country. This launch makes it the third 24-hour VH1 channel in Asia.\n\nVH1 is positioned as a channel that caters to an audience in the age group of 16 to 44 and is keen on international music. In effect, it takes over the slot vacated by MTV a few years ago, when the latter decided to add a considerable dash of Bollywood and Indi-pop to its programming juncture. VH1 offers music and shows that suit audiences past their adolescent years. In a niche channel, advertisers are able to reach audiences more effectively, so VH1 is never out of advertisements too. Vh1 has brought the best international music to India, coupled with the biggest stars, the juiciest stories and the latest in your favourite artiste's life. With an exhaustive music library spanning over 30 The Fabulous Life - Hip-hop Superstars years and genres like flower power, punk, rock, reggae, hip hop, pop and many more, Vh1 customizes its music and programme mix to appeal to Indian tastes. Globally, VH1 is available across 142.8 million households in over 141 territories. It also encompasses celebrity lifestyle and pop culture. Back-to-back classic music videos from the 70s to the 90s include Queen to Linkin Park, Pink Floyd to Robbie Williams and Billy Joel to Eminem. The programme line-up also consists of shows on music and celebrities. Unplugged is a series, where stars perform acoustic versions of their hits and share secrets on what makes them tick. Fabulous Life focuses on the lifestyle of the rich and famous, while Behind the Music takes a peek at the personal life of the pop star, tracing their struggles, setbacks and successes. Chart action unfolds through Greatest, a countdown show with a celebrity host presenting definitive rankings of the best songs, artistes, albums and everything else in rock n roll. Some programmes that are broadcasted in VH1 are Global Music Xpress, Dance 101, Big Brother, Vh1 Playlist, Jazz Masters, Yo Momma and tickers.\n\nThe launch of VH1 channel makes India the second country, after Australia, in the whole of Asia to carry all three channels- MTV, Nick and VH1, together on a 24-hour basis. Vh1 is India's only international music and lifestyle channel that brings to its viewers a unique concept: video games and music videos all in one morphed mix. VH1's Video Modes transforms music videos by injecting a unique video game environment and featuring characters from one or even a few video games."
