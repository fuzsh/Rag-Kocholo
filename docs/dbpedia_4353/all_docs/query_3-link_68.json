        "text": "VH1 lost its way in around 2002, when most of the original shows were axed and pop culture programmes/themed music days became the order of the day. But that wasn't too bad compared to what they've done recently...\n\nAt first I didn't mind when they replaced the themed music days/weeks with The Fabulous Life of... etc all day, but then after a while you notice its the same programmes every single day. They used to have loads of Behind The Music episodes with a different one every night at 10pm, but they only seem to show Britney or Celine Dion these days, at random times. Plus theresthe same Top 20's over and over again. The only time you see unthemed music videos now is from 1am-8am, and they actually have quite a good selection so its a shame to see it relegated to such a crap timeslot.\n\nI'm not sure why they're just leaving the channel in its current state. I selected a random date from 1999 on the BARB site (w/e 17/10/1999) and the top rated show had 120,000 viewers. The latest data on BARB says that the top rated show of w/e 25/04/04 got just 50,000. With the massive increase in digital tv subscribers in recent years, the ratings should have improved!\n\nBack to back programmes all day might work in America, but that doesn't instantly mean it'll also work in the UK!\n\n0\n\nThe only good thing about VH-1 these days is that surely it can't get any worse? There was a programme on there last week called something like ''Best Celebrity Bums ' From Kylie to J-Lo''. (I had no idea these women were even homeless)\n\nHave to say I did actually quite enjoy those Bands Reunited programmes a few weeks ago though. But apart from those VH-1 is not a channel I can be bothered with these days. Call me old fashioned but I like my music channels with a bit of music on them.\n\n0\n\nThe budget which was leaked to the papers last year was still enough to produce somthing half decent, even if just themed days - they were miles better than the current schedule. At least you got to see a good mixture of videos.\n\nThe themed days/Number Ones Week that they were running until about March were much better than the same few programmes on an endless loop. It really is utterly boring at the moment compared to how it used to be, and the ratings reflect that.\n\nMTV are obviously greatly concerned about ratings - hence why MTV Dance is more like MTV Base 2 - so why do they allow VH1 to continue to broadcast crap thats watched by less than half the ammount of people that used to watch?\n\n0\n\nDue to ntl's channel line-up changes for analogue I will loose this channel after around 8 years. Since this has been the only music channel for me pre-Freeview I thought I'd be sorry to see it go, but I really agree that it has become very poor lately.\n\nThe Fabulous life of. . . , Behind the Music, VH1 Collections, Rock the Box etc all seem to be rehashes of the same thing - people talking about artists and discussing some viseo footage. It has been done to death, and it is a shame since when it does play videos it can have a decent selection but we just don't see enough of them, VH1 Breakfast Club is often quite good (why does it finish at 8 though?), but Planet Celebrity News - you've gotta be kidding!\n\nThe on-screen graphics have went very down-hill - program titles in the middle of the screen (well near enough) and Vhr??? When they had the clock on Breakfast Club it was a nice touch but it seems to have gone recently. The ads for programs on screen seems to have disapeared lately, but it's still way too cluttered compared to say TMF.\n\nSo other than the ocasional 90s/number 1s weekend and a bit of early morning music I won't be sorry to loose this channel. It is a shame when you look at the state of it\n\n0"
