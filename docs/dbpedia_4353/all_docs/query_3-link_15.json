        "text": "Vanessa Williams is headed for VH1.\n\nThe actress has been tapped to star in VH1 scripted drama Satan’s Sisters, based on the 2011 Star Jones book of the same name.\n\nThe book and series follow the antics at a long-running popular ladies talk show where “alliances are forged, careers are made and bridges are burned.”\n\nWilliams will star as Maxine, the creator and host of The Lunch Hour, the show within the show. The character is described as formidable, powerful and decisive, a person who fears being put out to pasture.\n\nThe series will premiere on VH1 in 2017 and revolve around Maxine and her co-hosts — five women with very different points of view who are best friends and sisters but only while they’re on TV. Behind the scenes, they’re “Satan’s sisters” — a backstage filled with power struggles, personal demons, diva fits, love affairs, catfights and cocktails.\n\nThe role marks a return to series regular work for Williams following Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty and 666 Park Avenue. More recently, she’s recurred on The Good Wife and had a role in Lifetime’s The Trip to Bountiful.\n\nSatan’s Sisters will be executive produced by Jones, Josh Berman (Drop Dead Diva), Suzanne de Passe, Madison Jones and Susan Levison. Amy and Wendy Engelberg, who also will serve as executive producers on the Sony Pictures Television co-production, are writing.\n\nWilliams is repped by UTA, GEF Entertainment and Ziffren Brittenham."
