He was represented by his sister Iqra Chaudhary during the election campaign. She claimed people would vote in favour of the SP-RLD alliance. BSP's Rajendra Singh Upadhyay and Congress' Haji Akhlak are also in the fray.\n\nASSEMBLY ELECTION 2022: FULL COVERAGE\n\nNahid is a sitting SP MLA from Kairana and had won the 2017 polls, defeating BJP's Mriganka Singh.
