According to The Hindu ,Â Election Commission of India had ordered the removal of all pictures of Siddaramaiah and other Congress ministers from government websites\", and could also include “previous posts on social media championing achievements of the government”.\n\nThe removal, it claims wasÂ as a result of the Model Code of Conduct which was in effect in the state following the announcement of the election dates, and requiredÂ ministers contesting an election to not use government resources or official media for electioneering.\n\n9:34 AM (IST)\n\nKAIRANA: Hindus back to stay with Muslims after riots in 2013, claims Mriganka\n\nâ\n\nEarlier in a interview to The Times of India, Mriganka has said that her fatherâs (Hukum Singh’s) âsecular beliefsâ have won hearts in the past and that BJPâs winâwhich she feels is certainâwill be another endorsement of Hukum Singhâs legacy, adding that the 2016 migration controversy was âexaggerated by locals.â âI have knowledge of at least three Hindu families which owned shops in Kairana and have returned to run them. Locals exaggerated the number of Hindus who migrated while providing information to my father. This was later clarified in a report by then-UP BJP president Keshav Maurya.

After the violence in theÂ panchayat election, there should be a change. However, the fight is not against ideologies or parties. The fight is against money. I got news that huge amount of money flowed into many wards yesterday. Hence, the fight is against this money and muscle. I personally don’t believe that I need to be an MLA to be able to work for the people. Win or loss is not the end goal. Fighting for people is and the good feedback I have received from common people in the last 19 days, makes me hopeful of a change.”\n\nInput byÂ Utsa Sarmin/101Reporters\n\n9:16 AM (IST)\n\nKAIRANA: Made headlines during MuzaffarnagarÂ riots\n\nKairanaÂ is a place which was in the headlines a few year ago for reasons known to all.

The villagers had nothing to do with the assault and it was all the handiwork of the NPP workers. The threeÂ were on their way to Mukdangra and were not campaigning at all, nor were they distributing money,â MPYC president, Richard Marak said.\n\nEarlier, on 23 May, party workers of both the NPP and the Congress were involved in a scuffle.
