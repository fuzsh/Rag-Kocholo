        "text": "SP’s Iqra Hasan emerges victorious over BJP’s Pradeep Chaudhary in Kairana Lok Sabha seat, winning by over 69,000 votes. Hasan secured 5,28,013 (48.9 per cent) votes compared to Chaudhary’s 4,58,897 (42.5 per cent), according to Election Commission data.\n\nOut of 17,224,32 voters in five assembly constituencies, 10,758,39 voters cast their votes. The contest primarily featured SP’s Iqra Hasan, BJP’s Pradeep Chaudhary and BSP’s Shripal Rana. The main competition was between BJP and SP, highlighting the seat’s significance in shaping the political landscape of Western UP.\n\nThe Kairana Lok Sabha seat holds sway over the politics of Delhi and Lucknow, making it crucial for all parties as the mandate here often sets the course for political parties. In 2014, BJP gained attention in UP and nationally with the Kairana migration issue and secured a significant victory.\n\nFor SP’s Iqra Hasan, this election is particularly important as Chaudhary had defeated her mother Tabassum Hasan in the 2018 by-election and her brother Nahid Hasan in the 2012 Gangoh assembly elections. Iqra Hasan, contesting Lok Sabha elections for the first time, has paved her way for a promising political career by winning this election.\n\nIqra Hasan, the Samajwadi Party’s winning candidate from Kairana Lok Sabha, says, ” Fake case was registered against my brother and mother and distanced them from politics, during that time I joined the politics…2-3 years I was on field…young people like me to enter into politics and bring some change from inside and this is the time for that…I have also struggled but I want to do something good for my people and constituency”"
