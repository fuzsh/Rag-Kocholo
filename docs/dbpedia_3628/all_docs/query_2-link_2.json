        "text": "Situated in western Uttar Pradesh, Kairana stands as a Lok Sabha constituency with a rich political legacy dating back to 1952. Encompassing portions of Saharanpur and Shamli districts, this seat boasts a diverse political landscape characterized by the presence of prominent parties such as the BJP, RLD, SP and INC. The 2019 general elections saw the BJP's Pradeep Choudhary emerge victorious. However, his untimely passing necessitated a by-election in 2022, resulting in Tabassum Hasan of the RLD claiming victory, indicating a shift in the constituency's political paradigm. During the 2019 elections, Kairana recorded 1,666,703 electors, yielding 1,124,047 valid votes. Pradeep Kumar of the BJP secured triumph with 566,961 votes, while Tabassum Begum of the SP secured second place with 474,801 votes, trailing by 92,160 votes. In 2014, Kairana had 1,531,767 electors, with Hukum Singh of the BJP emerging victorious with 565,909 votes. Nahid Hasan of the SP trailed in second place with 329,081 votes, with a margin of 236,828 votes separating the two candidates."
