Uttar Pradesh' Kairana went into polling in the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections 2024 on April 19, with a voter turnout of 62.46%.\n\nSamajwadi Party's candidate, Iqra Choudhary, emerges victorious with a margin of 69,116 votes, followed by BJP's Pradeep Kumar and BSP's Sripal. Kairana encompasses approximately 261,399 Scheduled Caste (SC) voters, constituting approximately 15.6% of the total electorate.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP leader Pradeep Kumar won with a margin of 5,66,961 votes, defeating SP’s Tabassum Hasan, who ended with 4,74,801 votes, while Congress Harendra Singh Malik received 69,355 votes.\n\nAlso Read | New winners in UP: Young, educated & raring to go.\n\nThe Kairana Lok Sabha constituency, established in 1962, is situated in the Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh and includes five assembly constituencies: Kairana, Shamli, Thana Bhawan, Nukud, and Gangoh.\n\nWho Is Iqra Choudhary?\n\nIqra Choudhary, a 28-year-old candidate from the Samajwadi Party, has made headlines by winning the Kairana Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh on her very first attempt. Armed with a Master's degree in International Politics and Law from SOAS University, London, Iqra's victory came as a surprise to many.\n\nShe secured the SP ticket for the Kairana constituency, endorsed by party leader Akhilesh Yadav, and emerged victorious over the BJP candidate by an impressive margin of 69,116 votes. The 28-year-old has her postgraduate degree in international law from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.\n\n“My priority will be to work for my constituency, especially women, who are still backward and lack adequate educational facilities,” she Iqra told news agency IANS.\n\nWhat makes Iqra's win even more significant is that she triumphed in an area where the BJP had previously highlighted the issue of alleged 'Kairana migration.'\n\nOpen in app"
