        "text": "As voting in bypolls for four Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly constituencies in 10 states got under way on Monday, faulty electronic voting machines (EVMs) have been reported from several places.\n\nFaulty EVMs were reported across polling booths in Bhandara-Gondiya Lok Sabha constituency of Maharashtra, while voting has not yet started at polling booth number 170 in Arjun-Morgaon area. The Election Commission has cancelled polling in at least 30 polling stations in Bhandara-Gondiya, following reports of malfunctioning EVMs.\n\nA control unit at 216 booth number and three voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) machines at booth numbers 169, 170 and 222 were replaced during a mock poll due to a technical snag in Punjab's Shahkot Assembly seat. Four VVPATs at booth numbers 27, 28, 132 and 45 were replaced during polling in Shahkot.\n\nAt Kairana Lok Sabha constituency in Uttar Pradesh, RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan wrote to the Election Commission about faulty EVMs and VVPATs in around 175 polling booths across Shamli, Kairana and Noorpur.\n\nSP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said 140 EVMs were tampered in Noorpur and that similar reports have come in from Kairana. \"BJP wants to avenge their defeat in the earlier bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur anyhow and win the ongoing polls,\" he said. An RLD spokesperson echoed his claims, alleging reports of faulty EVMs were coming in from areas perceived to be dominated by the opposition.\n\nAt Tharali Assembly constituency in Uttarakhand, various political parties demanded a new EVM at a polling booth in the Sarpani area after a mock poll revealed issues."
