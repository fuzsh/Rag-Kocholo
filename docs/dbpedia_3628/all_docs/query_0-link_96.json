        "text": "Post by KPS Gujjar on\n\nDear Vijay Raj,\n\nHere I am again replying to your message, as I promised and I will keep my word (being a GUJJAR).\n\nI did a mistake some time back but I assume if you learn by mistakes you become a better human, and if you keep on repeating the same you are becoming worse. So I opted to get better.\n\nI tell you a short story. We use to live in a township. My family is very considerate towards poors and animals. I need no appreciation for the same. There use to come a beggar, almost two/three times a week. He use to wear Dhoti, Kurta, Nehru Topi and Jootis. He use to talk in our own very dilect (Western UP).\n\nWe never asked him which caste he belongs to though he knew well about most of the villages in our area.\n\nWe always use to help him. One fine day my mother asked him what caste he belongs to bcoz we had an assumption that he might be a poor gujjar. First he was reluctant. His words \"Gareeb ki koi jaat nahi hoti, jiske bachcho ne use ghar se nikaal diya ho, uski kya jaat aur kya khaandaan\".\n\nMy mother insisted and told him what did she assume. He told \"I am JAT, and my family still owns land and is doing well\". This didn't change our attitude bcoz whatever he was, he was an old man in much of help. We don't see him anymore may be he expired. Don't you feel pitty on this old man. He might have died on road side, may be bcoz of Winter/Summer. Municipality might have taken care of his dead body in the so very usual way. I think he deserved decent last rights, being a human.\n\nVijay its not about being JAT/GUJJAR/RAJPUT I think it is more about being a HUMAN in first place. See what you get in return if you abuse. You are abusing other's sister and they are writing all stupidity about yours. Is this the way we treat our families.\n\nPlease don't take it otherwise, I am not saying that only JATs beg. If this is what you concluded I am SORRY my dear friend. God might show any one of us the days we dare not think of.\n\nYou termed us as criminals, its not only you who does. This is bcoz any gujjar do anything you will see a news ----- Gujjar did this and that. Don't JATs fare well in crime. You must have heard of Navneet Sikera.\n\nWhat a gentleman police officer he is. He almost cleaned whole MuzaffarNagar belt. If you read India Today there was a story about him when he killed Nitu Kail, do you know which caste he belong to (nitu Kail).\n\nYou, me and all of us claims we are from a very glorious history. Answer my question \"How did the human population came to this number ? Assume any number in the beginning and calculate, can they ever arrive to present day's number, having the social obligations and restrictions that we have today. You know well what I am talking about. We are improving as a society not as a community and we need to do so.\n\nAgain please refrain from using the names of big shots. They are because they did something. When you will achieve something in your life may be someone else will quote your name, but inorder to see that day, do something. Yes you can keep on doing what you are doing and one day you will die very ordinary death. Again handful of relatives will be there to perform your last rights. If someone will post a message on this forum that day I assume people won't be concerned.\n\nGujjars are milkman, well they are earning their livelihood. I know many people from your community giving us neck to neck competition in this bussiness.\n\nIn recent elections when Dharmendra contested the elections from bikaner, people from your community said loud and clear \"He is not a JAT he is RAMGARHI\". See every caste has subcastes you JATs won't accept KOLIs as JAT. Do you ? But as soon as any KOLI will become primeminister of India you will say \"He is a JAT\". What is this man ? Mentioning these names here won't add to your numbers but what will happen is people will start digging their roots and as soon as they will find anything fishy, they will say whatever crap they are capable of. You are the one who is earning disrespect to them.\n\nThese politicians are dividing us on the basis of region/caste etc etc. You being an educated youth of this country need to address or atleast understand all this below the belt politics.\n\nDid you hear of a political party, came into existence recently \"PARITRAN\", they are IITians and committed to make a change in this system. Put your energy to better use.\n\nMy gut feeling says your father Sh. Amar Singh won't be prod of you being a very good ABUSER.\n\nRest depends on you, you are mature enough.\n\nRegards\n\nKPS Gujjar\n\nPost by KPS Gujjar on\n\nDear VijayRaj,\n\nAs I mentioned earlier I will always owe you a reply.\n\nOne :\n\nVijay ji, I didn't intend to say anything about/against Dharmendra. What I was telling you is \"See what ever name you will take people will try to find out their loop-holes, loose-knots etc. All of them did something great in their life. Not even you and me, but all of us praise them for what they have achieved. They are national HEROs not community Heros.\"\n\nIf you wish even I can pull anyone's leg, out of the names you mentioned. But I say that will be a shame on me. Let me achieve something of their stature then may be I will eligible.\n\nTwo :\n\nIt is my earnest request, please do not quote politicians names. None of them are Heros. They are SHRUDE politicians nothing else. They are the one who should be held responsible for this disorientation of the Nation as a whole. Uttar Pradesh was the biggest state. Some started pulling one piece of it APART and they succeeded, now we have UTTRANCHAL, born out of U.P., some other are asking for HARIT-PRADESH. Come-on Vijay you are wise enogh to see what is happening. Please donot quote their names, even if they belong to any caste, I firmly believe they can even sell their PRIDE for glittering GOLD.\n\nThree :\n\nMy dear friend. You better know why people are, what they are today. I am also standing by your side, that we GUJJARs cannot live on past glory. But you do admit at times that we had a glorious past. So when we had a glorious past what happened to us today. You brought Sachin's name in discussion. I must tell you one thing, \"PUBLIC KABHI SOCH HI NAHI SAKATI HAI\". Even if we had a separate brain for eyes, one for taste, one for smell, one for touch, one for locomotion etc etc our body would have been a mess. So, that is why we always nead a brain to make this apart body function, and we need governance.\n\nDon't go by illiterate and JAHIL janta's opinion are you the one who hates Sachin Tendulkar ? I firmly believe \"YOU ARE NOT\". Reason is you know his past achievements and today because of 1000 reasons he is going through a bad time. We know his past, we accept his present and we wish like his past he will be in his FUTURE.\n\nVijay this is what we are trying to do on this forum. You cannot coin all of us with a single term, or don't like us because we are having a bad phase, you know our past and let us come to the terms of our past in our future. We all shall prevail and let BHARAT prevail like anything.\n\nFour :\n\nYou said we are criminals. I will tell you later why we are criminals, if we are. Did you listen to the NEWS day before yesterday, One CRIMINAL is shot dead by delhi police. I don't want to quote him by caste, name etc. To which ever community he belongs to, now a days we are seeing that the CRIMINAL GRAPH of that very class is ascending. This is an ALARM. That community is degrading. This degradation is for no reasons, but we had a sound reason.\n\nQuestion is why we are CRIMINALs or whatever ? Vijay ji the only problem with us GUJJARs is we don't know how to give-in & we are very proud of this trait of ours. We are still continuing with this hounour. We had a glorious past. With our descend came RAJPUTs. They made allies with Mughals we didn't, and we were deprived of our legacies. We kept on fighting (chhapamaar youdh), we refused to pay the taxes. We as a creed, were taken very well care of by Mughals, they never let us rest in peace. Then came British, as Rajputs told Mughals who we are, same was passed onto British by Mughals and what ever was left was also confiscated. So as usual we faught British and refused being taxed. We were declared NOTIFIED TRIBE. Which means this creed is notified to be criminals. Now you answer a few of my questions :\n\na) What means of earning a livlihood we were left with, when everything of ours was confiscated.\n\nb) How could we go to schools when we were declared NOTIFIED.\n\nc) How could our parents taught us, to whatever extend they were capable of, when almost all adult males were put behind the bars.\n\nd) Had there been any crime, the first GUJJAR they could lay there hands on, was blamed and prosecuted.\n\nSir even after independence, we were deprived of our rights. What did we get only again labelled as DENOTIFIED TRIBE. Ha ha ha !!!! A new LABEL for us as a community as WHOLE. Some of us still had lands, then came the 1952 Zamindari-Act What the hack man !!!!\n\nVijay ji we are still struggling and with the same dignity and pride. We are trying to put our community and youths back on track. My Grandfather was illiterate, they were five brothers. He took the onus and educated next generation to his best capabilities. Five of my Taus retired as Head Masters, one of them retired from Sugar Mill Accounts Deptt, My father going to retire this year from BHEL. I am carrying forward the trend I am working in one of the best (best workculture/ best paying/ best ethics) MNC on the face of earth. I AM NOT A CRIMINAL, butlet me tell you very frankly \"SAME BLOOD RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS,\n\nIf it is a matter of DIGINITY I can KILL with my bare hands, though to whatever extent I am civilized and educated. THIS IS IN OUR BLOOD.\n\nFive:\n\nVijay I am requesting you again. You can never say you are better just by saying others are not good.\n\nplease do not quote Fauji, Satbeer etc names. You are a JAT and may have a very limited list I can fill a whole page on this forum with the names. You trigger a GUJJARs self-pride and you make him a CRIMINAL. My cousin threw a local CRIMINAL from the top of a running BUS, because he slapped the bus conductor and refused to pay the fare. I say he did the best and I don't call him Criminal nor did the COURT.\n\nMy cousins killed two COPs and seriously injured few more, just because they were trying to rob a poor man off his last belongings, my cousins intervened. Later at night at their attacked by the COPs and their friends. I am GLAD my cousins did that it is our duty towards society.\n\n1824 we killed thousands or British/British soldiers and we are not even there in History. I am from that village. Irony is even those who did nothing are known as FREEDOM Fighters. I ask you what did Sardar. Kultaar Singh do in the fight for FREEDOM ? He as a kid at that time. Just because he is brother of Bhagat Singh. He was given plenty of land in Saharan Pur. Now a days he is selling Plots. People who testified Real Freedom Fighters in Jails became dignitories of India. Even we had such a Prime Minister.\n\nSee this way we not going to derive any conclusion. If you ask me I can tell you the story of Fauji, Satbeer, Jagata etc. Even I can tell you the story of your \"Inspector Rathi shot dead Satbeer Gujjar \" and I assure you, you won't be PROUD of what he did.\n\nIn order to make our community better. First we need to make them feel PROUD/AWARE of our GLORIOUS PAST, then make them PROUD of our presnet by telling them why we are in this SOUP today and still proud. I assure you we will have a GOLDEN FUTURE, because we haven't yet compromised our PRIDE/ DIGINITY.\n\nRegards\n\nKPS Gujjar\n\nPost by KPS Gujjar on\n\nABOVE ONE WAS FROM VIJAY\n\nDear Vijay,\n\nFirst let us do one thing \"Keep the discussion on same THREAD\".\n\nSo now I have pasted your reply to this thread, I ask you to please keep replying here. Now my replies :\n\n1. Vijay Ji, please revisit my earlier reply and let me know where did I accepted/not accepted Dharmendra as a JAT. If you sincerely wish to know my opinion about Dharmendra as a Hindu Indian Male. I say, he is not a man of MORAL. In this day of light we Hindus do not encourage Polygamy. I had seen the interview where he was asked a queation \"Whose name did you put in the \"SPOUSE\" column for application for contesting elections from Bikaner ?\". He didn't reply and said \"it is my personal matter\".\n\nI agree that might be his personal matter but we as a civilized community wish to know, what is his marital status in a society where we condemn polygamy.\n\nTo whatever caste he belongs whether JAT/Ramgarhi Badhai, I really don't think very high of him as a member of this society. If you really feel proud of him being a JAT, I pity you. You are educated and living in a civilized society where we follow some rules, if someone is not obeying a rule of such a high importance, I don't expect you to be proud of Him.\n\nNext thing is He didn't become a film star bcoz he was a JAT (or whatever), Sahwag didn't became a goor player bcoz he was a JAT (a Very vlose friend of mine is JAT and he is really PISSED off with Sahwag, He also plays cricket and is a very good player, he is of Sahrawat Gotra).\n\nThese people achieved something because they are good at something, it is not because of their caste.\n\nLate Sh. Rajesh Pilot was a good politician not bcoz he was GUJJAR because he had capabilities, my cousin is Mr. ASIA (bodybuilding) he is not Mr. ASIA bcoz he is Gujjar but because he worked hard, Mr. Pranav Singh is not ASIA Champion Armwrestling bcoz he was Gujjar because he worked for it.\n\nSo, let us not count on some big shots names and say the community is GREAT because they belong to that community. Any community accepts or rejects people based on their merits/de-merits. They are heroes of the Nation.\n\nIf some criminals are known because they are Gujjars there are those who are known because they were JATs. People do put Gujjar after their name in my community but not even a single example where people put JAT as their post-fix who belongs to your community, still they are known as Bhoori JAT, Deepak JAT etc.\n\n2. Now let us discuss about Harit-Pradesh. Now we have Uttranchal (earlier part of U.P.), what is so great has happened in Uttranchal after becoming a separate state. Still people in Uttranchal are struggling for basic eminities. Farmers are struggling for better MANDIs, better rate for Sugarcane etc, others are asking for employment. Though quite a lot of industries from other states have migrated to Uttranchal. This is not because they love UTTARNCHAL this is because they are getting good profit when legally they can evade some taxes, that adds to their profit. Had U.P. put some policies in place for that region, industries would have come.\n\nHad you ever been to Eastern U.P. ? If not please do visit and see what shape those cities are in compared to Western. Farmers are really in a BAD shape in Eastern U.P. So I can say with confidence that they are not eating into your share, these are politicians and beurocrats who are eating your share. So next time you go and vote, ask the candidates what are they gonna offer you and your area, instead of blindly following their ugly politics.\n\nIf you say small entities entitle to better governance, Why don't we split the state, in states on District basis. We will have smaller states and better governance. It is all about the model of governance not the area.\n\nWhen in Free India, police is wearing the same uniform what they use to in British India, when still the mentality of police force is same that of British India i.e. torturing masses, extorting money (like they use to collect taxes), like when people die of their negligance and they try to give you wrong data of casualities (Meerut) isn't it same like in Jaliawala Bag massacre govt figures 379 while 1000s died. Till we have this model of governance we wil keep on suffering may it be U.P. or Harit-Pradesh.\n\n3. Who said Muslims are poor ? Ask the Muslim politician who spent 5 crores on the Engagement ceremony of his daughter. You said Muslims are traitors, what about JAT muslims ? Boss if you know you are also a foreign race who occupied this subcontinent. On these basis all of us are Traitors or what so ever. Who ever is living in this country and loyal to the mother land is not a TRAITOR.\n\nSir, Presidnt of India is a Muslim !!!! They are not same as they were because they are reluctant to change.\n\nI ask you a question. You must be knowing of Maharana Pratap, When he died and Moughals captured Chittor his family (whatever left) pledged not to live in a Chittor Ruled by Moughals and will only return when they have their Chittor with the dignity and till date they are roaming in India and living by roadside. Their condition is well known to all of US. What are your remarks about them.\n\nfor you they must be FOOLS, ruining their present for some odd MATTER of PRIDE. This is the difference between you and US. I have a key word to coin you and your CLAN i.e. \"OPPORTUNIST\". Vijay ji had we been opportunist like you we would have been in better situation than you.\n\nWho ever had a GLORIOUS PAST tells about their achievements in past and also the MORALS, VALUES and PRIDE they are carrying in their blood.\n\n4. Vijay ji when did I say \"Gujjars have been betrayed by Muslims, British and Rajputs\". There is no point of betrayl. We never asked for any loyalty from them. We lost the rule to Muslims and Rajputs because Rajputs (some) helped Muslims in doing so. Mughals lost to British because Rajputs(some) helped British. We never accepted Mughal/ British rule. We wre not OPPORTUNISTS so we are paying the price till date with DIGNITY.\n\nFor your kind information, Landhora Riyasat and Kunja-Bhagawanpur Riyasat were taken over by British only in 1859, both are Gujjar Riyasats and very close to your home town. Even people from your area use to pay Mal-Guzari to kunja-Bhagawanpur Riyasat.\n\nVijay dear, how did you arrive at the conclusion that we are going through any humiliation By the way I am still proud that 156 people from my village were \"Hanged by neck till Death\" ona single day and still we didn't give-in to Bitish rule, tell me one JAT village with same HISTORY. This is what I call proud of being what we did and in whatever situation we are today bcoz of what we did.\n\nVijay ji Losers don't talk about DIGNITY and PRIDE, but we do. I have told you and I am telling you, this PRIDE and DIGNITY will take us back to where we were. Time will speak for itself, Vijay Bhai.\n\n5. Why don't we have any regiment in our name ? Good Question. My answer is \"We were never and will never be OPPORTUNISTS, like others who have regiments in their name\"\n\nYaar Vijay, How do you read in between lines. I never said any criminal became criminal for any cause good to the community. They all have their own reasons and CRIMINALS are CRIMINALS. Every one reaps what he sows.\n\nregards\n\nKPS Gujjar\n\nPost by Vijay Raj on\n\nKPS\n\nGreat to see your response. Honestly I liked your response where you have mentioned\n\n?These people achieved something because they are good at something; it is not because of their caste?\n\nI agree with that and would stop taking names of great Jats from now onwards however I would also expect you to stop talking name of Sardar Patel or all the past gujjar Kings because they were also individuals and they are not popular because they were gujjars. As far as your comment that a Jat friend of your hates Sehwag it does not make any sense because Shewag is just a player not a god, it is not mandatory that every body should love him or respect him. I can give you tons of eg where gujjar hates another gujjar. One gujjar killed another gujjars. I hope you know that Mahendra Bhati was killed by Mahendra Fuaji. Let me give you one more eg. There is a village called Rajpur in Distt Ghaziabad near Faruknagar. Rajpur is just next to Jawli (Madan Bahiya Village) In Rajpur there were two real brothers Satte and Krishan. Krishan was shot dead by Satte in front of his parents. So please do not make a big deal of Sehwag.\n\n2. As far as Harit Pradesh is concerned, let us not discuss about it because your or gujjars participation in this would not make a difference. This is majorly demanded by Jats, Yadavs and Muslims because we Jats hold the most fertile and the maximum land of Western U.P. Jats and Muslims form the major part of the Western U.P population. Gujjars are the minority community in UP and will remain minority population in Harit Pradesh as well. Harit Pradesh make lots of sense to Jats as Jats grow the maximum Sugarcane in Western U.P. So honestly let us not discuss about it. Yeh demand minority communities ki samajh mein nahin aayegi. It is just the same Gujjars and Jats both got the OBC status but it is only Jats who got the maximum benefit out of it because Jats have more educated popualtion than gujjars. Jats got most of the govt jobs. Same is happening in Rajasthan where everybody is concerned about Jats as jats have taken away most of Govt job in Rajasthan.\n\nPlease do read the linen given below:\n\n?There are 269 OBC castes across Rajasthan, yet the benefits go to the Jats simply because of these reservations,\" says Manch Vice-President Mishra. \"In the most recent recruitment drive for the Rajasthan Administrative Service a couple of years ago, 85 seats were reserved for OBCs and 79 of these were bagged by the Jats. Six pradhan (district heads) seats were reserved for OBCs; all were taken by Jats. Of the 105 sub-inspector (of police) posts reserved for OBCs, Jats got 104 of them. What will happen to the other OBCs for whom reservations were actually created?\"\n\nTo confirm the above click on the hyper link given below:\n\nia.rediff.com/election/2003/nov/27akd.htm\n\n3. I do not understand on what basis you consider a community is poor or rich. If one or two Muslims are rich it does not mean the whole community is rich. I hope you know that majority of the Muslims lives under the poverty line.\n\n4. Now let us answer your last comment about Gujjar Riyasat.\n\nYou have mentioned that Landhora Riyasat and Kunja-Bhagawanpur Riyasat were gujjars riyasat. What is difference does that make. All these riyasat were once ruled by Jat Maharaja Suraj Mal. So every gujjars staying in Raja Suraj Mal kingdom was paying tax to him.\n\nTo confirm about Suraj Mal, jats struggle against Muslims and British and also about Jat Kngdom please click on the hyper link given below:\n\nwww.jatland.com/home/Maharaja_Suraj_Mal\n\nI have pasted some line from the original post about Jat kingdoms\n\n?Please note that Maharaja Suraj Mal. Mal, described as the \"Plato of Jat tribes\" and \"Jat's Ulysses\", extended his kingdom to include Agra, Mathura, Dholpur, Mainpuri, Hathras, Aligarh, Etawah, Meerut, Rohtak, Farrukhnagar, Mewat, Rewari and Gurgaon. He was described as the greatest warrior and the ablest statesman that the Jats had ever produced. He moved the capital from Deeg to Bharatpur after 1733. Great Rustam, a Jat king of the Sogariya clan, laid the foundation of the modern city of Bharatpur?\n\nTo cofirm the above please click on the hyperlink given belwo and read the history column:\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jat\n\nI hope you also know that Distt Ghaziabad and Bagpat are made of Disst Merrut. Now tell me all the above distt have good gujjar population it means all gujjars were paying tax to jat raja and I am not talking nuts I have given you the proof of whatever I am saying.\n\nAlso note that British were defeated by Jats of Bharatpur and British had to do compromise with Baharatpur. Bristish lost almost 3000 soldier in that battle. To help you more I have pasted line from the original post, please read below:\n\n?The inaccessible Lohagarh fort could withstand repeated attacks of British forces led by Lord Lake in 1805 when they laid siege for over six weeks. Having lost over 3000 soldiers, the British forces had to retreat and strike a compromise with the Bharatpur ruler. Of the two gates in the fort, one in the north is known as Ashtdhaatu (eight metalled) gate while the one facing the south is called Chowburja (four-pillared) gate.?\n\nTo confirm please click on the hyperlink given below.\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_Suraj_Mal\n\nAs far as brave Jat villages are concerned let me give you only one eg, you might have heard about a famous Jat village Shaidpur in distt bulandshahar. It is the only village in entire U.P who lost maximum soldier during 1971 India Pak war. This is 100% Jat population village having sirohi gotra. After 1971 war Indira Gandhi made a special visit to this village to pay her tribute to brave soldier and their families. Does that make any sense to you. KPS ji kuan ke madak mat bano apni duniya se bahar aao. I would request you to visit this village and you will see that names of the brave soldiers on the big stone which was inaugurated by Indira Gandhi. Infact Birtish had and Indian army has a cantonment office in this village to recruit Jats in the army. Does that make any sense to you? How many gujjar villages have Indian army cantonment office. What ever I have said I can provide you evidence if you don?t believe me visit village shaidpur. As far as freedom fighter are concerned come to my village and ask anyone 463 people were arrested by British out of which 213 were hanged, 135 were sent to kala pani and 115 were jailed. If you do not believe come to my village you will know the story.\n\nAs far as your regiment is concerned, yes it is true gujjars are not opportunist. It is only Jats or Rajputs or Sikh who always look for an opportunity to die for their country. We would like each and every opportunity to come to us so that we can die for your country.\n\nKPS ji Fauj main bahrti hoone ki opportunity mardon ko di jaati hai hizdon ko nahin. If you are not opportunist than why are Gujjars shouting now to have their regiment.\n\nYou have not responded to my previous post question, why Chamars despite being exploited by each and every community are in a better situation than you.\n\nLooking forward for your response.\n\nVijay\n\nPost by KPS Gujjar on\n\nHello Vijay,\n\nHope you are doing fine and sound in all respects.\n\n#1. I am glad that now both of us agreed \"Not to mention any names, no BIG SHOTS\".\n\n#2. Harit Pradesh : Vijay both of us have different opinion on this subject. But I will still insist that area does not matter, what matters is model of governance. Please read some good books on Pub. Ad.\n\nVijay I would really love to see the numbers, percentage wise contribution of Gujjars, Jats in western India. Please donot quote anything just out of your own brain. Hey please let us also know \"Kaun se number ka ganna laga rahe hain JAT aaj kal? aur kab se JAT ganne ke sabse bade utpadak ho gaye?\".\n\nWell my mama was Director Sugarcane Research & was posted in Hisar, Karnal and Yamuna Nagar (your State). I know very well about the Sugarcane Production trends in India.\n\n\"Bhai mere GANNA kisi jati ki jageer nahi hai\". Please don't mind but really you made me lbrust into laughter !!! Thanks a lot BUDDY!!! Keep on cracking these kinda JOKES!!! LOL !!!\n\nLet us come to the other point. Boss in U.P. Yadavs are the one who are getting most out of OBC reservation. Let me tell u one more thing \" Yaar tum sabse jyada ganna ugate ho (ha ha ha), tum sab se jyada bahadur ho, tum sab se jyada intelligent ho, to bhai ye OBC reservation ki zaroorat tumhe kyon pad rahi hai?\". This is why I call JATs OPPORTUNIST. For your kind information, When I was doing B.Tech there was only a single JAT in whole college . Total strength comprising of four years was 800.\n\nOh my God !!! Now I am able to understand why you are asking for Harit Pradesh, what a dumb I am yaar. OK you guys will first make Harit Pradesh, then you will put yourself into OBC category derive maximum benefit out of it, and also you will make a world record of SUGAR CANE Production in Harit Pradesh. If you have real GUTs ask for JAT Pradesh instead of Harit Pradesh, keeping the same boundaries as for Harit Pradesh.\n\n3. That is it, one or two individuals cannot mean a community is poor or rich. But as you said they don't have any respect, treated like traitors, no body gives a dammm about their history. Well I did saw a serial The Great AKbar, I did see TajMahal (movie), I did see Mughal-e-azam. It does mean that people do give weightage to their history. Man we are poor and backward. What about YOU ? I never saw any serial \"SURAJ MAHAL MAHAN SAMRAAT\" or anything on that line.\n\nOpen your eyes, Muslims are NOT POOR. If you see some TELI Muslims in your village and say they are poor, traitor or deprived, you are wrong my dear. Visit places except \"Bawli & Bagpat\".\n\n#4 :\n\nI don't take Wikepedia and Jatland's urls as authentic proofs. I have better written, documented and verified proofs with me. My dear Vijay till 1813 British dare not fight with Landhora Kings. They never ever thought of and straight forward ran into \"SANDHI\". You are talking about British fighting in 1805 for the lohagarh fort, my dear till 1813 they didn't even dare look at us. After 1813 when the riyasat splitted, britishers tried to get hold of it, in 1822 we faught and kept on fighting. This is a well documented proof that we were never under Mughal or British rule till 1859. Mind it Mr. Vijay 1859. Go read some good books other than posts written by JATs like you.\n\n#5:\n\nArmy. Good topic I was really happy to see whn you mentioned this. Do you know Forces have a back-door entry option. I describe it to you. If your father is/was in services you will get a fair chance to get into forces. When some castes were liking the soles of British Empire and they were in British Army, their kids also got a very-very fair opportunity. Same continued post independence.\n\nNow about \"cantonment office\" in some JAT village. reason above supports the WHY and also let me tell you this is a tradition in your caste. Do you remember \"Open Recruitment of JATs\" in police force from Distt. Bagpat on behest of a JAT leader (I don't wish to mention the name). So this is a custom in your caste. This is what I call being OPPORTUNIST.\n\nNow about Rajput regiment. Above quoted stands on well grounds for them as well.\n\nSikh Regiment. I will be highly greatful to you sir if you can please tell me, When did SIKH became a caste ? Please go and read SIKH history and you will come to know, why this clan originated, what was the purpose, how many Sikh Gurus were Gujjars. Please do read their History you will come to know a lot about them and us.\n\n#6.\n\nRegarding you village. I won't buy the story until you give me some names, years, gazetteer records. I respect all freedom fighters. Well do you know of \"Dulle JAT\" (Dileep Singh JAT) , he was from your area BAGPAT. You must be proud of Mr. Dulle JAT as well. This is what most of you, I am not saying all of you, are doing for years and years and years.\n\n#7 : Regarding Harijan's, well BOSS in my area they are still very suppressed and expolited. May be in your JAT area they are in better shape. If you are saying they had a CM in U.P. Answer is they are united and we are not. Same stands for you, you are also very united.\n\nYou see sheeps are also very united but Lions are not. The day Lions will unite will be the end for all the sheeps. BEWARE, we are heading towards that day.\n\nVijay hamare yahan ek kahawat chalati hai :\n\n\" Ya to janamayo Bhakt, Ya Dani ya Shoor\n\nWarana Rahiyo Banjh, kyon gawaye Noor\"\n\nKoyi Jaton ki bhi suna do except \"Anpadh jaat padha sa, padha likha khuda sa\", \"jat mara tab janiyo jab terahi ho nibate\"\n\nAre haan ek aur hai, aakhir hamare liye sari achchi achchi kahawat kaise ho sakati hain \"Gujjar se to Ujjad bhale\". So mitra, Gujjaro se nahi ulajhana.\n\nRegards\n\nKPS Gujjar\n\nPost by vijayraj on\n\nKPS JI\n\nAb to sara response maine ek post mein daal diya hai. Kindly responsd.\n\nThis is really coming to conclusion about Gujjars. In this response I have tried to show you ground realities of Jats and Gujjars and also proof of Jat producing maximum Sugarcane. In next post I will put response of your other doubts.\n\n1. We are already set on Harit Pradesh. It is after all not for minorities.\n\n2. As far as contribution of Jats and Gujjars is concerned I have not doubt that Jats are at much higher position than Gujjars. If you feel Gujjars have contributed more than Jats please provide evidence. It is not me who bring anything just out of own brain it is actually you, if not than provide me the evidence that 186 people were hanged from your village. Whatever I have said I have always provide you the evidence but you only talk by yourself which does not make any difference in this world.\n\n3. Now let us come to Sugarcane. Let us first talk about Western U.P. Major Sugarcane producing Distt in Western U.P are Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Bulandsahar, Merrut, Ghaziabad, Bagpat, Muzafarnagar and Bijnore. I will talk about every distt step by step. There is a simple common sense that if in a particular distt gujjar population and gujjar villages are more than Jats than obviously Gujjar will grow more sugarcane or any other farming products and vice versa as well. Let us first talk about Agra\n\nAgra Distt- It is densely populated by Jats. Out 10 MLA seats in Distt Agra. 5 MLA’s t are Jats and most of them are from RLD party which is Jat party. List is given below:\n\na) Sh. Chotey Lal Verma- MLA Fatehabad- Phone No- 2230387\n\nb) Sh. Ganga Prasad Pushkar- MLA party RLD consti Etmadpur- Phone- 2332189\n\nc) Chaudhary Baboo Lal- MLA party RLD constituenct Fatepur Sikri- Phone- 2110210\n\nd) Amar Singh Parmar- MLA from RLD constituency Kheragurh\n\ne) Sh. Raja Mahendra Aridaman Singh MLA from BAH\n\nNow let us come to MP. MP from Agra Raj Babbar is Muslim Jat.\n\nNow let us come to Mayor and Zila Panchayat Chariperson, they both are Jats names are given below:\n\na) Smt. Prem Lata Parmar- Zila Parishad Chairperson- Phone-354493\n\nb) Sh. Kishori Lal Mahor- Mayor- Phone- 363065\n\nTo confirm all above please click on the hyperlink given below:\n\nagra.nic.in/elect.htm\n\nI have also provided the contact number of all the MP’s and MLA please feel free to confirm. Gujjars existence in Agra in nearly zero so there is no point they can grow more Sugracane than Jats. And everybody in India knows that Jat are big time in farming. Jats hold maximum and most fertile land in India including Western U.P.\n\nMathura: Mathura has 6 MLA seats and out of those 6 MLA’s 3 are Jats from RLD (Jat Party) Details are given below:\n\n1. Sh. Tejpal Singh( MLA from RLD party constituency Chatta\n\n2. Sh. Prem Singh Daroga (MLA from RLD party constituency Gokul)\n\n3. Sh Pratap Chaudhary (MLA RLD party constituency Sadabad)\n\nTo cofirm all above please click on the hyperlink given below:\n\nmathura.nic.in/poltical.htm\n\nMathura has given 3 times Tejveer Singh as a JAT from BJP, Also note that Jat population in Mathura is 3.5 lakh nearly 30 % out of 14 lakh, total population of Mathura.\n\nTo confirm please clink on hyperlink given below:\n\nwww.dailypioneer.com/vote_2004_2.asp?main_variable=vote_2004&file_name=vote317.txt&counter_img=317\n\nAligarh: Out 7 MLA seats, Jat have 2 MLA names Sh. Mahendra Singh (BSP), Sh. Jaivir Singh, it would have been 3 but RLD candidate from Khair lost by very less margin because 3 jat candidates were contesting. T\n\no confirm about Jat MLA please click on the hyper link give below:\n\naligarh.nic.in/mp.htm\n\nMP from Aligarh Chaudhry Bijendra Singh is Jat from INC to confirm please click on the hyperlink given below:\n\nwww.telegraphindia.com/1051213/asp/frontpage/story_5593956.asp\n\nBulandshahar: - It is densely populated by Jats, Lodh, Yadav and Muslims. It has one MP seat and 9 MLA seats. MLA seats are as follows:\n\n1. Bulandshahar- MLA is Mahendra Yadav from BJP. Yadav’s have 24 villages in this constituency. It has a mixed population of Muslim, Yadavs and Jats. One of the largest JAT village Bhatona near Gulaoti having population of 25,000 comes is in this constituency. D.P Yadav has won election 2 times from the same seat\n\n2. Agota- MLA is Kiran Pal Singh (SP) He is Jat having Sirohi gotra from village Dhameda. Agota has 80% Jats. In the history of Agota politics no non Jat has become a MLA. This constituency have 2nd largest village of Jats which is Saidpur and Saidpur has a population of 35000 and all are Sirohi Jats.\n\n3. Anoopshahar- MLA is Hosiar Singh (Independent) He is a Jat from village Suratgarh and Post Malakpur. His gortra is Rajora. Anoopshahar is densely populated by Jats as it has some of the largest Jat villages like Charora (Population 18000), Khalor (Population 28000) and Khadana (population 15000)\n\n.4. Shikarpur- MLA is Munsilal Gautam. He is Chamar resident of Tulsi Market near Kala Aam. It is a reserve constituency but 59% Jat population. This has always been Ch Charan Singh seat but to weaken Ch Sahab support in U.P Indira Gandhi made it a reserve constituency.\n\n5. Siyana- MLA is Sunder Singh (RLD) He is Lodha from Devipura. It has mixed population of Muslim, Tyagi and Lodh.\n\n6. Sikandrabad- Ved Ram Bhati. He is a Gujjar from Village Girdharpur and Post Gurkul. It is indeed a Gujjar dominated constituency.\n\n7. Debai- MLA is Rajveer Singh (BSP)Village Madhauli Nisfi Asharfabad and Post is Khas. He is a Jat and his gotra is Tewatia.\n\n8. Jevar- MLA is Narendra Kumar from BSP. He is Chamar from Village & Post Mangrauli, Tehsil Jevar.\n\n9. Khurja- MLA is Anil Kumar Sharma from BSP. He is a Pandit from Village and Post Surjawali.\n\nAll other eg clearly proves that it a Jat dominated constituency as Jat has 3 MLA from Bulandshahar and Gujjars have one. It could have been 4 Jat MLA if Shikarpur would not be the reserve constituency. However MLA from Shikarpur is from RLD which is JAT party.\n\nNow let us come to MP seat of Bulandshahar- Please note that it is not a reserve constituency. Bulandshahar has so far seen 14 MP elections and out of these 14 elections seven times it has given a JAT MP and their names are as under:\n\n1. Surendra Pal Singh- He is from Unchagaon Distt Bulandshar.. He belongs to a royal family of Jats from Unchagaon. He has his own fort in Unchagaon near Jhangirabad 40 KM from Bulandshahar City. He owns atleast 1200 Bighas land in Bulandshahar. Ask anybody from Bulandshahar he will tell you about him. He was married to daughter of Jat Raja from Bharatpur. He has won MP election 4 times from Distt Bulandshahr. He won in 1962, 1967, 1971 and 1984.\n\n2. Ch Chatrapal Singh- He has been MP from Bulandshahar 3 times in 1991, 1996 and 1998. He is also a Jat from Agota Bulandshahar. His gotra is tewatia.\n\nTo confirm, please click on the hyperlink given below, you will find the names of all MP’s from Bulandshahar.\n\nScroll left hand side scroll bar and click on the MP.\n\nbulandshahar.nic.in/\n\nThe current MP from Bulandshahar is Kalyan Singh from Lodha community. He won by a very close margin of 10 thousand votes from Badrul Hasan (candidate of Jat party RLD) In the history of Bulandsahar not even once a Gujjar has become a MP and it is pretty clear that it is not a reserve constituency. All the above data clearly shows that Bulandshahar is not Gujjar dominated constituency.\n\nAlso gujjar has only one MLA and JATS have 3 MLA. Only a DUMB would say that it is gujjar dominated constituency.\n\nAlso recently on Jan 7, 2006, Distt Bulandshahar went for Zila Panchayat election on 46 Seats. Results came very good for RLD (Jat Party) as 18 candidates won from RLD out 46 and because of this Savita Singh is elected as the Chairman of the Zila Panchat. Savita Singh won Zila Panchayat on RLD ticket. She is Jatni from village Mumrejpur near Khurja in Distt Bulandshahar. Anybody who knows the politics is well aware that the Zila Panchayat chairman is as powerful as the MP. The Chairman get Red Light Car and DM of the district is the secretary of the chairman. Now you tell me a distt is called dominated by a community who has given 7 MP’s so far or a community who has given ZERO MP. Appointment of Savita Singh (RLD) as Chairman of Zila Panchayat clearly shows Jat power in Bulandshahar. So far Jat has given 6 Chairman of Zila panchyat. I can provide the details if needed.\n\nMeerut- It is dominated by Muslim, Jats and Gujjars. Infact after recognizing Jat power Mulayam changed the name of Merrut Univ to Ch Charan University. Please note not even a single MLA from Meerut is Jat or gujjar. In fact Ranvindra Pundir MLA from Sardhana is Rajput. However RLD Jat party has one MLA from Siwalkhas constituency.\n\nBagpat- This distt has 3 MLA from RLD (Jat Party) All 3 constituency Bagpat, Baranawa, Chaprauli has RLD MLA.\n\nDistt Muzafarnagar:- Muzafarnagar- It is densely populated by Jats and Muslims. Muzafarnagar has always been the centre point of all the famers protests and revolution. Mahendra Singh Tikait (JAT) belongs to this district. It has 2 MP seats and 9 MLA seats. MLA seats are as follows:\n\n1. Kandhla- MLA is Ch Virendra Singh from (RLD). This constituency is called Garh of JATS. Nearly 75% of the population is JAT in Kandhla. Ch Virendra Singh belongs to JASALA village Distt Muzarfanagar. His gotra is RATHI.\n\n2. Khatuli- MLA is Rajpal Singh Baliyan from (RLD)) He is Jat from village Garinabad Distt Muzafarnagar. Please note that Baliyan gotra has 84 villages in this constituency. Mahendra Singh Tikait is Chaudhry of the Baliyan KHAP in Muzafarnagar.\n\n3. Bagra- MLA is Paramjeet Malik from (RLD). This seat got vacant after Anuradha Chaudhry won MP, Lok Sabha election from Kairana. Anuradha earlier was MLA from the same seat. After Anuradha this seat went again for election Paramjeet Malik won it from RLD ticket (JAT PARTY)\n\n4. Jansath- MLA is Yashwant Singh from (RLD). He is Jat from village Chudiyala distt Muzafarnagar. His gotra is Nehra.\n\n5. Morna- MLA is Rajpal Saini from (BSP) He is Dheemar from Sarwat Gaon -6 distt Muzarfanagar.\n\n6. Muzarfanagar (City)- MLA is Chitranjan Swaroop from (SP). He is a Bania and resident of H.NO-197 North Civil lane Muzarfarnagar U.P\n\n7. Charthawal- MLA is Uma Kiran from (SP). She is Chamar from Halwayian Chauhatta distt Muzarfanagar and it is a reserve constituency.\n\n8. Kairana- MLA Hukum Singh from BJP. He is only gujjar MLA from Distt Muzarfarnagar. He is the resident of H.No 107 Alkala, Kairana U.P\n\n9. Thana Bhawan- MLA is Kiran Pal Kashyap from SP. He is Kashyap resident of Dheemanpura -2 Majra Road, Shamli Distt Muzarfanagar.,\n\nTo confirm the all above, please click on the hyperlink given below:\n\nmuzaffarnagar.nic.in/pubrep.htm\n\nGujjar have only one MLA whereas Jats have 4 MLA’s. Not only Jats dominates the above 4 Assembly seats they also make significant impact on 3 other Assembly seats like Charthawal, Kairana and Thana Bhawan. This is the only reason Samajwadi Party (SP) made an alliance with RLD (JAT Party) to compromise on seats.\n\nNow let us come to MP seat of Distt Muzarfanagar. Muzafarnagar Distt have 2 MP seats Muzafarnagar and Kairana. Please note that none of them is a reserve constituency. From Muzafarnagar MP is Ch Munawar Hasan from SP. This seat was under joint election of SP and RLD.\n\nFrom Kairana MP is Anuradha Chaudhry from RLD. Anuradha is Jatni everybody knows it.\n\nAlso note that from Muzafarnagar Distt we have a Member Parliament of Rajya Sabha as well. His name is Harinder Malik. He is from Village Kazi Khera, Distt. Muzaffarnagar (Uttar Pradesh)\n\nPlease note that Muzarfanagar is totally a JAT and MUSLIM dominated district. They all together form 70% of the total population.\n\nTo enhance your knowledge about Muzarfanagar prominent personalities click on the hyper link given below:\n\nmuzaffarnagar.nic.in/prominent.htm\n\nOut of 3 personalities Mahendra Tikait and Virender Singh both are JATS\n\nKPS ji- I have provided all the details which clearly proves that all Sugarcane belt of Wetern U.P is dominated by Jat or Muslims. You do not need an Einstein to understand that if Jats are in majority in these distt and they have the most fertile and the maximum land it is obvious that Jats grow the maximum Sugarcane in these distt.\n\nPlease find hereunder the hyperlink about Jats holding maximum land in Muzarfanagar. For your kind information this link is not from Jatland or Wikepedia. To help you I have posted the line from the news.\n\n“Kukda, located 5 kilometres from Muzaffarnagar town, is a large village with a sizable Muslim population. In fact, the Muslim population in Muzaffarnagar district is supposed to average between 35 and 40 per cent though some would optimistically put it at 50 per cent. This is part of the sugarcane belt in western Uttar Pradesh. Land ownership is concentrated mainly among the Jats. A few upper-caste groups and fewer Muslims own land. The large majority of Dalits, Maalis and Muslims work as agricultural labour. Sugarcane is grown almost throughout the year, and given the ample supply of canal water, the crop is assured and the owners devote their time to activities that people say have resulted in a high rate of crime in the region. The area is sometimes referred to along with Meerut, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad as the \"Wild West\".\n\nTo confirm above click\n\nwww.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2215/stories/20050729006512100.htm\n\nNow let us come to Gujjar dominated areas in Western U.P. Gujjar mainly dominated Dadri Belt and Khekra in Distt Ghaziabad and Mawana in Distt Meerut and also some parts in Muzarfarnagar.\n\nI hope you know that Dadri belt land is not conducive for Sugarcane because it is near to Yamuna land is very Retili. And Khekra also is not a fertile area for Sugarcane.\n\nHowever in Mawana and Muzafarnagar Gujjar do grow lots of Sugarcane which is peanuts in front of Jat production in whole Western U.P\n\nSome more link of what other think about Jats and this link is not also from Jatland\n\nkcm.co.kr/bethany_eng/clusters/8083.html\n\nI have already provided the proof in my above response that The Jat regions in India are among the most prosperous on a per-capita basis (Haryana, Punjab, and Gujarat are among the wealthiest of Indian provinces).\n\nIt is only Jats who always raises issues about Sugarcane because we are first to be affected by low price., Jat leaders like Mahendra Singh Tikait take rally for Sugarcane farmers.. Now I would like to see a response from you. About Gujjar MLA’ or MP in Western UP or Gujjar population in WesternU.P. Let me tell you total population of Jats in Western U.P is 2,964,000 and Gujjars is 1,075,000\n\nTo confirm Gujjar population U.P and India please clink on hyperlink\n\nwww.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php\n\nKPS Ji App sirk bolte ho koi proof kabhi nahin provide karte. Please respond the way I have responded than I would believe you. All the information I have provided above is not from Wikepedia or Jatland. Now I would also like to see the response like this not a response what you think.\n\nJAT GANDA NA DEVE BHEELI DEVE HAI\n\nNow let us come on the Movies on Raja Sural Mal. It is true that there is no movie on Raja Sural Mal but KPS JI Kya gujjar king per koi Movie bani hai.\n\nTo know more about Jats and Suraj Mal please click on the hyper link given below, also note that this is not from Jatland or Wikepedia.\n\nwww.indiasite.com/rajasthan/bharatpur/history.html\n\nI have pasted one incident from the above link\n\n“Obviously the Jats were always trying to assert their supremacy over other fellow human beings. Once what happened was that a maharaja of Bharatpur was snubbed by an insolent young Rolls Royce salesman. It hurt the Jat's pride immensely, and to counter that, he brought a whole fleet of Rolls Royces. and guess what he did with them? He made them Bharatpur's garbage collecting vehicles!”\n\nKPS JI padha, yuu hoo Jaat.\n\nNow let us come to Army. Sir now you are really acting like bad looser. Aapke mutabik in whole India the Indian Army mein sab sifarish se hi jaate hain.\n\nAapke mutabik Jat, Rajput, Sikh, Gorkha sab fauj mein sifarish ki wajah se hain. Tell me one thing jab ye hi community ke log jung mein jaan dete hain tab aapki sifarish ka logic kahan chala jaat hai.\n\nSir I think you do not read whatever you right. You have always said that most of the Rajputs are gujjars than again you are saying here that Rajputs are opportunist. Than by default it proves that Gujjars are opportunist because as per your previous comments most of the rajputs are gujjars.\n\nSir agar Prithvi Raj Cahuhan ko aap Gujjar kehte ho phir Jai Chand ko bhi gujjar kaho. I hope you know Jaichand is the biggest traitor. Ye to koi baat nahin hui jab rajput accha Karen to who gujjar hain jab who fauj mein jaaye to woh opportunist hain.\n\nSir apne funde clear kar lo.\n\nNow let us come to Chamars or Harizans. You have said that in your area they are still exploited you are right even in my area they are exploited. Than you said they powerful because they are united and gujjars are not.\n\nAb mera sawal yeh hai sir, ke gujjars are poor because of Muslims, British or Rajputs. They are not educated because of Govt policies. Ab yeh bhi keh do ke gujjars are not united because of Muslims, Rajputs, or Govt. Than you say that Gujjars are lion. Sir what kind of lion you are ke aapki sabne maari hain.\n\nSir United aap ho nahin sakte kyonki aap kutte nahin hain. Loin aap rahe nahin kyonki aapki sabne maari hain. Sir Jab aadmi sher bhi na ho aur kutta bhi na ho toh who beech ka ho jaat hai. Aur sir beech ke aadmi ko kya kehte hain aapko apata hoga.\n\n“JAAT KA JHATKA DHEERE SE LAGE’\n\nAs far as freedom fighter proof is concerned I have proofs first you shows me the proof that 186 people were hanged in your village.\n\nKPS ji aapka mukabla padhe likhe jat se ho raha hai kissi anpad gujjar se nahin. Ye bakwaas apne gaon mein chutiye gujron ko hee suna ke kush ho jaya karo. Kabhi jat ko mat sunana.\n\nKyonki- ANPAD JAT PADHA SA AUR PADHA JAT KHUDHA SA\n\nAnxiously waiting for your response.\n\nAs far as reservartion is concerned yes in U.P Yadav;s are taking the maximum advantage.\n\nKPS ji in U.P I was not comparing Jats with Yadavs I was talking in context of Jats and Gujjars in reservation. Jats are definitely taking better advantage of reservation than Gujjars in U.P. It very simple to understand that Jat Youth is more eduated and career orientated than Gujjar youth whose main motive in life is to become a Milkman or a criminal reason is again simple Gujjars are illetarte.\n\nWe are asking about OBC status because majority of the Jat population is farmer and farmer deserve help from the Govt afterall we are the one who is producing Sugarcane and wheat for whole country. Saari country hamara boya hua khati hai.\n\nPar aapka kya, appka to OBC mein bhi aakar peet nahin bhara. Ab to gujjas are demanding of ST status from Rajasthan govt .\n\nTo help you understand I have pasted the line from the Hindu news paper for you, Please note that Hindu newspaper is neither run by Jats and it has nothing to do with Wikepedia.\n\n“JAIPUR, APRIL 16 . Divisions have surfaced among Gujjars in Rajasthan over their support to the Bharatiya Janata Party ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, with a faction in the community announcing that it was convinced by the ruling party's promise to include Gujjars in the reserved category of Scheduled Tribes and the others opposing it. Gujjars currently enjoy the reservation benefits as Other Backward Class (OBC). However, they have been agitating for shifting the community to the fold of Scheduled Tribe following the previous Congress regime's decision to accord the OBC status to Jats. Jats are believed to have carried away a major chunk of the quota benefits to the detriment of other sections in the category.”\n\nTo confirm please click\n\nwww.hinduonnet.com/2004/04/17/stories/2004041705750500.htm\n\nAb KPS JI kya kehna hai aapka. You are saying we are opportunistic. Tum log to itne gire hue ho ke naukri ke liye apne aapko ST category mein bhi karne ko raazi ho. It is really a shame.\n\nKPS JI- Aaj kal ki duniya main apna hak cheena jata hai manga nahin. Ab jeeta who hai jiske gurde main jaan hoti hai. Jaaton ke gurde main jaan hain isliye Jaaton ne reservation ka haq BJP govt se dara kar liya tha.\n\nTo help you I have posted lines from rediff news and it is also not run by jats or wikepedia\n\n\"Both the political parties are scared of the Jats because in the 1998 assembly election, the Jats claimed they had dumped the BJP for the Congress and the latter won, while in the Lok Sabha election in 1999, they said they had supported the BJP since the Congress did not appoint a Jat chief minister, and the BJP won more seats in Rajasthan,\" he says.\n\nTo confirm please click on the hyperlink given below:\n\nia.rediff.com/election/2003/nov/27akd.htm\n\nAb bataiye KPS JI Kya kehna hai aapka ya phir raag alapo ge ki hamen sabne dhoka diya isle hum aise hain. It is really funny. I like that.\n\nDil Behlane ke liye Khayal Accha hai.\n\nJAAT JISPE NA JUKH JAAYE USSE BAAT NAHIN KEHTE\n\nHAR BAAT PE JO JUKH JAAYE USSE JAAT NAHIN KEH"
