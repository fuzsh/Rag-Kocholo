        "text": "The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) on Monday raised allegations of rigging in the Noorpur Assembly and Kairana Lok Sabha by-election polling after EVM malfunction was reported in several booths.\n\nThe RLD's candidate in Kairana Tabassum Hasan has written to the Chief Election Commissioner complaining about malfunctioning EVM and VVPATs in the constituency. Despite raising the flag, the administration is not dealing with the issue and voters were being deprived of their right, she wrote, urging the EC to urgently send engineers and technicians to repair the machines.\n\nIn a letter to the UP Chief Election Officer, SP State president Naresh Uttam Patel has complained that faulty EVMs were reported from 113 booths in the stronghold of the SP and its allies in Noorpur. \"It appears that the EVMs are made to go faulty in such large numbers on the directions of the State government so that people cannot go and vote in these booths,\" Mr. Patel wrote.\n\nA delegation led by BJP UP vice-president J.P.S. Rathore met the UPCEO demanding immediate restoration of EVMs and possible re-polling on booths where voting was stalled for a long time. Submits list of 67 booths in Kairana where faulty EVMs have been reported. The BJP also says that the election officers and booth officers were not paying heed to complaints raised by BJP polling agents.\n\nAs per her complaint, EVM related issues have been reported in booths in each of the five Assembly segments in Kairana. Shamli: 47 booths, Kairana 13, Gangoh 48, Nakud 38, and Thana Bhawan 9. Raising the issue on Twitter, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said: \"So many malfunctioning EVMs point to some sort of systematic anarchy!\"\n\nThe SP also raised allegations of rigging in the Noorpur bypoll, saying that EVMs in most of the booths in Dalit and Muslim areas were \"selectively\" not functioning. The SP pointed out at least 19 booths where EVM malfunctioning was allegedly reported. The EC is yet to comment on the accusations by the Opposition.\n\nSP president Akhilesh Yadav said: \"Is this a technical fault or failure of election management or a conspiracy to deprive people their voting rights? At this rate, the foundations of democracy will be shaken.\"\n\nSP MLC Udaiveer Singh alleged there was \"scientific rigging\" going on as EVMs were \"selectively\" malfunctioning in 90% Dalit and Muslim populated booths in Noorpur. \"No engineer (are) available, DM irresponsibly behaving. Ramzan being used as a tool by BJP. Yahi hai (this is) digital India aur VIKAS (development),\"he said.\n\nAlmost 90% of officers in Noorpur have their phones switched off, added Mr. Singh. \"Administration ko message hai kaise bhi jeetna hai (It has been indicated to the administration to ensure victory at any cost),\" he said.\n\nThe SP says that polling has been stalled in many booths in Noorpur seat, including 97, 200,231,205,206 337, 25,29,30,266,30,24, 222,305,282,311,230,287,221."
