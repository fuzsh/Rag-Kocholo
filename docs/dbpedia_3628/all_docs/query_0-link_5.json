        "text": "Town in Uttar Pradesh, India\n\nTown in Uttar Pradesh, India\n\nKairana is a city and a municipal board in Shamli district of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is approximately 14 km (8.7 mi) from Shamli city.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2011 Indian Census, Kairana had a total population of 89,000, of which 47,047 were males and 41,953 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 16,074.

The effective literacy of population seven years and above was 37.6%.[4]\n\nMigration\n\n[edit]\n\nKairana and Kandhla migration row (also known as Kairana exodus) refers to mass migration of Hindu families from Kairana and Kandhla in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh during the period 2014–16. Media sources have stated that the migration was due to threats of extortion from Mukim Kala, described as a \"gangster.\" The National Human Rights Commission issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government regarding the migration from Kairana. Bharatiya Janata Party politician Hukum Singh released a list of 346 Hindu families which had migrated from Kairana. On 14 June, he released another list, this time containing the names of migrant families from Kandhla. Both these list and the subsequent response have received extensive media coverage . Several families have reportedly deserted the city due to extortion and loot by goons of gangsters like Mukim Kala. Many families have reportedly been forced to shift to nearby Haryana villages due to the terror. Locals said they were getting threats on phone and through letters. If one refuses to give protection money, he is killed by the henchmen. They have no option but to leave the city to save their lives.[5] However it was also reported that many migrated not because of communalism, but crime.[6]\n\nNational Human Rights Commission confirmed the exodus in an inquiry which also cited the influx of Muzaffarnagar Riot refugees as exacerbating the harmony in Kairana.[7]\n\nPlaces of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many religious and natural attractions in and around Kairana. Of these, are mainly the Nagarpalika building and procession house, Devi Mandir and Talab, Nawab Talab, Jain Mandir and Bagh, Imambara, Gaushala, Idgah and many shrines including Nogza Pir, the Yamuna river at 6 km (3.7 mi).[citation needed]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nRahmatullah Kairanawi\n\nShabab Kiranwi\n\nBegum Tabassum Hasan\n\nChaudhary Munawwar Hasan former MP\n\nHukum Singh former MP\n\nAbdul Karim Khan\n\nJamil Naqsh"
