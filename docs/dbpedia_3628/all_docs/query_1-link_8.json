        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe political landscape in Kairana is shaped by a century-old conflict between the Hasans and Singhs, while the 'exodus' of Hindu families continues to be a contentious issue. Ikra Hasan, a new contender, is vying for the Lok Sabha position amidst local support and challenges. The scars of the past 'exodus' incident still affect the community.\n\nEveryone in Kairana is familiar with these two stories. The first story dates back 120 years and narrates the tale of the Hasans and Singhs. The second story, a blend of reality and exaggeration, focuses on the 'exodus' of Hindu families from the arid town in UP, just an hour's drive from Haryana. The main characters in both narratives are closely connected – both to each other and to the political destiny of the constituency.Let's start with the first story.\n\nMore than a hundred years back, the Singhs and the Hasans – the prominent political families of Kairana – were part of a single Gujjar family associated with the Kalshyan khap. However, a predecessor decided to break away and embrace Islam, triggering a series of conflicts. The offspring of this lineage, Hukum Singh from BJP and Chaudhary Munawwar Hasan from Samajwadi Party, engaged in political battles during the 1990s. Similarly, their children, Mriganka Singh and Nahid Hasan, continued the rivalry in recent times following their fathers' demise.\n\nCurrently, competing in the arena is Ikra Hasan, aged 30 and the sibling of Nahid Hasan who recently returned from London. A graduate of the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), she is contesting against BJP's Pradeep Chaudhary for the Kairana Lok Sabha position. Despite the temporary diversion from her family's century-old conflict with the Singhs, she remains a contender, albeit facing a new opponent.\n\n\"Ikra is like a daughter to us,\" expressed Furqan Siddique, a vendor of fruit juices in a bustling market square. \"When Nahid faced unjust imprisonment, it was Ikra who flew in from England to fulfill the necessary tasks. She has dedicatedly campaigned for more than two years and stands out as the prominent figure in this election. She is clearly leading in the race.\" In February 2021, Nahid and his mother Tabassum Hasan were implicated under the Gangster Act by the UP Police. Despite being released on bail, Nahid has been noticeably absent, seldom appearing at campaign events and gatherings.\n\nWithin the city boasting an immense Muslim population, nearly 80% in number, numerous individuals firmly believe in Siddique's prediction. Munna Khan, a vendor of readymade garments, expressed, \"She's youthful, committed, and intelligent. We admire her.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nLok Sabha election: Stage set for close contest in western Uttar Pradesh\n\nIkra expressed optimism in her statement to TOI on Thursday, saying, \"I don't see any major obstacles in these elections as it's clear from engaging with the public that there is no prevailing national narrative, unlike the narrative being pushed by BJP. What holds importance are the local issues and the local community.\"\n\nThis is the point where we must introduce the second narrative, the \"exodus\". Back in 2016, Hukum Singh, the former BJP's Kairana MP, made public a list of 346 Hindu families who had \"migrated due to fear\" from the region that year. This \"revelation\" grabbed national attention and quickly escalated into a significant controversy. While the storm has calmed down, the scars of the incident still linger.\n\nIn Teacher’s Colony at Kairana, where it was believed that Hindu families had left after listing their homes for sale, there is a sense of calm. Sayyam Sharma, the owner of RDS coaching centre with 200 students, mentioned, \"We are seeing an increase in student enrollment. I will need to make room for more classes. It's important for us to move on from the past.\" Akshit Garg, a grocery store owner, stated, \"I have no recollection of the scandal. I prefer not to dwell on it.\"\n\nAt the BJP’s campaign office, the staff present unanimously agreed that \"memories of such events do not fade easily\". Shakti Singh, prominently involved at the chaupal, declared, \"Who was responsible for restoring peace? How can one overlook the presence of crime? Why were the Hindu families compelled to leave? These questions continue to linger. Babuji (Hukum Singh) has made significant contributions. The people of Kairana will uphold his legacy.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nUP Lok Sabha Election 2024 Phase-1 Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar Bijnor seats on April 19: Check party-wise candidates, other details\n\nShakti Singh promptly mentioned that the current BJP MP Chaudhary, despite facing allegations of being an \"outsider\" and of \"neglecting\" the constituency, is \"making steady progress\". He joyfully exclaimed, \"Please enjoy some laddoo. We are already in a celebratory mood.\"\n\n(The article was originally published in TOI)\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nUP Lok Sabha Elections: Rajput community to boycott BJP candidates in Muzaffarnagar, Kairana, Saharanpur\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nThree reasons why Mumbai, NCR beat Bengaluru in the IPO treasure hunt\n\nIs the great Indian snacking boom slowing down finally?\n\nStock Radar: Laurus Labs likely to find support above lower band of rectangular pattern; time to buy?\n\nHow fintech startups are dealing with bleak credit cards outlook\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
