A ground-level survey of the Kairana Parliamentary constituency was conducted by India News to analyse the performance of Pradeep Chaudhary, the Member of Parliament from Kairana, and gather voters’ feedback about him.

Pradeep Chaudhary, an Indian politician, secured a seat in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s Parliament, representing Kairana, Uttar Pradesh, in the 2019 general elections as a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Located in the Shamli district of Uttar Pradesh, Kairana is renowned for its association with the ‹Kirana Gharana› in classical music. However, in recent years, the political dynamics of this region have captured significant attention.

Chaudhary, a BJP member, currently represents the Kairana constituency in the Lok Sabha. His political journey saw him elected as a legislator from Nakur Assembly constituency in 2000 on a Rashtriya Lok Dal ticket, followed by a victory in the Gangoh Assembly area on the Congress ticket in 2012. Subsequently, he contested and won from Gangoh on the BJP ticket in 2017. Finally, in 2019, he secured the seat of Kairana in the Lok Sabha elections.

The Kairana constituency has been a battleground for various political parties, maintaining a significant hold over the region›s electoral landscape. With nearly 1.7 million voters, it stands as a pivotal seat in Uttar Pradesh›s political scenario.

Chaudhary›s performance in parliamentary proceedings, with an approximate 92% attendance, raising 13% of questions, full fund utilization, and significant special contributions, reflects favorably at 0.68 out of 1, indicating a commendable performance in representing Kairana at the national level.

According to the survey, Chaudhary›s ground-level performance in Kairana has yielded mixed feedback, scoring at 0.35 out of 1, signifying a 35% approval rating. Similarly, on social media, the MP›s presence has been less convincing, with a score of 0.25 out of 1, indicating a mere 25% approval.

India News› comprehensive evaluation includes Chaudhary›s performance in parliamentary sessions, where he scored 0.68 out of 1, reflecting a commendable 68%. However, the overall assessment, when combined with ground performance, social media presence, and the India News survey, brings his score to 5.27 out of 10.

The voters of Kairana, after extensive discussions with various demographics, seem divided on their evaluation of Chaudhary›s performance. While he almost clears the halfway mark in the report card, scoring approximately 53%, the electorate appears indecisive, leaving him in a precarious position.

The report card, reflecting the MP›s parliamentary performance, ground engagement, social media presence, and media surveys, presents a picture of uncertainty, with the constituents evenly split on their opinion of Chaudhary.

With key issues like unemployment, agrarian concerns, water crisis, dilapidated roads, education, healthcare, rising crime, women›s safety, religious tensions, and caste-related issues plaguing the constituency, voters face a challenging decision in the upcoming elections.

The demographics present a diverse electorate with a near-even gender split, a significant rural population, and a notable representation from marginalized communities, emphasizing the complexity of this electoral battleground.

As the electoral scenario heats up, these mixed survey results portray an uncertain future for Chaudhary›s political journey in Kairana, leaving the electorate in a contemplative state, pondering which factors will shape their voting decisions in the upcoming elections.

Ultimately, this survey depicts a constituency in flux, presenting a mixed bag of opinions and a wavering stance toward MP Pradeep Chaudhary›s performance, setting the stage for a closely contested and thought-provoking electoral battle in Kairana.
