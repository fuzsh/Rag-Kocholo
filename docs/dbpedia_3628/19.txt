Who Is Iqra Choudhary?

Iqra Choudhary, a 28-year-old candidate from the Samajwadi Party, has made headlines by winning the Kairana Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh on her very first attempt. Armed with a Master's degree in International Politics and Law from SOAS University, London, Iqra's victory came as a surprise to many.

She secured the SP ticket for the Kairana constituency, endorsed by party leader Akhilesh Yadav, and emerged victorious over the BJP candidate by an impressive margin of 69,116 votes. The 28-year-old has her postgraduate degree in international law from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.

“My priority will be to work for my constituency, especially women, who are still backward and lack adequate educational facilities,” she Iqra told news agency IANS.
