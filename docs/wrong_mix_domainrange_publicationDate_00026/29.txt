THats the whole point of the list. you can begin anywhere you wish. if you want to tell us some specific elements that you enjoy someone could narrow it down a bit further, other than that, have at it!

That is the trouble with big lists. They are not sufficiently refined. People don't specify in sufficient detail why they like or dislike something. Picking 5 books at random could get 4 you don't like before you get 1 that you do. Even definitions have changed over the decades.

Now that I know how old it is I think it is a good idea to read a couple of books by E. E. "Doc" Smith. I think that basically defines "Space Opera". It is good in a "campy" kind of way because it is cheezy. I think it can be fun for young kids but it is lacking in refinement. It was written almost 30 years before the atomic bomb.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylark_(series)

That wiki entry says published in 1928 but it doesn't say it was started in 1915 and turned down by a number of publishers and sat in a drawer for almost a decade.

But 30 years later there were lots of bad examples of BAD SPACE OPERA to learn how not to write that junk. I would suggest Ensign Flandry by Poul Anderson. But don't assume all Flandry stuff is that good.

The Rebel Worlds (1969) is pretty good but A Circus of Hells (1970) doesn't quite make the grade.

Almost any stuff worth reading is not space opera if it was written after 1960. Some authors might deliberately imitate that cheezy style because some readers like it though. I don't like Revelation Space but I wouldn't call it space opera. It almost certainly qualifies as epic.

That is the trouble with big lists. They are not sufficiently refined. People don't specify in sufficient detail why they like or dislike something. Picking 5 books at random could get 4 you don't like before you get 1 that you do. Even definitions have changed over the decades.

Now that I know how old it is I think it is a good idea to read a couple of books by E. E. "Doc" Smith. I think that basically defines "Space Opera". It is good in a "campy" kind of way because it is cheezy. I think it can be fun for young kids but it is lacking in refinement. It was written almost 30 years before the atomic bomb.

psikeyhackr... What, in your opinion, is the definition of space opera?

Ive always thought of "Revelation Space" as space opera, as well as being epic. But honestly if I think too hard about it I cannot come up with a solid definition of space opera.

Or maybe we should ask Andols what he/she thinks space opera is, since its his/her list let him/her define it

sorry for all the he/her/him's, but I hate to assume gender online.

It it that subjective characteristic where it's so BAD it's GOOD kind of thing. That was my reaction to Triplanetary when I read it in the 60s. I just couldn't stop laughing. So then I read some Skylark stuff but I didn't know it went back to 1915.

At the time I just read science fiction I did not read about science fiction. I don't recall where I first encountered the term "space opera" but by that I mean low quality but can be fun and funny. But the writers of the 30s reflected the way people thought in the 30s. By the 60s it was weird and funny. And by low quality I mean the "science" can be totally without correspondence to anything real and the literary quality mediocre and no intellectual significance whatsoever. But can be a hell of a lot of fun if you are in that state of mind. But there was a general rise in scientific and literary quality from the 30s through the 60s. So mostly I don't call post-1960 material material "space opera". I relate it to soap opera that I never watched.

It is like reading stuff from the 50s today seems weird because the characters are all smoking cigarettes all of the time. How often do you encounter that in SF since the early 80s?

I am male by the way.
