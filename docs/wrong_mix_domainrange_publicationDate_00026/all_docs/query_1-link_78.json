        "text": "The Internet has opened up many opportunities for publishers, editors and amateur writers through its capacity of creating communities. The online literary communities empower the amateurs as writers. This article aims to evaluate the Romanian online fiction websites and to provide insights into the ways of constructing amateur fiction online. The present study also aims to offer a large perspective on an emergent phenomenon, that of the expansion of the Romanian literary online communities and the practices used by these communities to engage the people in their activities. The article introduces a new topic among scholars and could become subject to wider debates at national and global level.\n\nBreve panorama histórico y cultural del fenómeno de la escritura amateur en círculos de aficionados, y su difusión viabilizada por las nuevas tecnologías. Disclaimer: an Overview of Fanfiction Rafaelli, Verónica 2004 Primeras Jornadas de Cultura y Literatura en Lengua Inglesa, organizadas por la Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación. Publicado en Actas de las Primeras Jornadas de Cultura y Literatura en Lengua Inglesa (ISSN 1668-8449; 2004). ABSTRACT Sometimes classed simply as easy reading for the idol-deprived masses, fanfiction has rarely enjoyed the status of literature, while only grudgingly acknowledged as a somewhat shameful subtype of literary creation. Recent academic interest in its newest and most extended publication medium, the World Wide Web, has sparked a new surge of appreciation for this little-loved cousin of the parody, illicit lover of the pulp novel and grandson of the newspaper serial. The obvious space limitations will force us to reduce four years of research to a few meagre highlights, doing away with all the subtler considerations: historical, ideological, linguistic... Our aim will then be only to introduce the unaware reader to the most salient points of this fascinating phenomenon, hoping to arouse new interest in what we hope will soon become a much more legitimated genre.\n\nScience fiction is the genre that links our lives to the future: the faster the pace of scientific and technological advancement, the greater our awareness of what István Csicsery-Ronay called “the science-fictionality” of everyday life. The more we feel the effect of scientific and technological change on global flows of economic, social, and cultural exchange (not to mention the blurring of biological and environmental boundaries), the more we are drawn to a literature that Boris Strugatskii identified as “a description of the future, whose tentacles already reach into the present.“ It is hardly surprising that scholarly interest in Russian and Soviet science fiction has been growing in recent years, with an expanding roster of roundtables and panels exploring the topic at professional conferences. Why talk about Soviet science fiction? As the articles in this special thematic cluster suggest, science fiction functions more as a field of intersecting discourses than as a clearly d...\n\nThe article explores the effects of convergence culture (H. Jenkins) on the system of literary production and consumption. The study is focused on fanfiction culture with a special accent on Harry Potter fandom. The analysis investigates several areas where the creative practices of amateur writers challenge and subvert the corporate and state control over literary production: copyright vs. nonprofit literature, transformative work vs. plagiarism, literature vs. visual arts, author vs. audience, writer vs. reader, classical vs. popular literature, canon vs. fanon.\n\nWhen Chingiz Aitmatov&#39;s Plakha first appeared in Novyi mir in 1986 many readers here were astounded at the uncanny ability of this established author to ride the wave of the future. This sensational novel, with its stark portrayal of the drug trade, exploitation of the environment, and social alienation in the Soviet Union, was seen by many as the ultimate expression of newfound creative freedoms under Mikhail Gorbachev. For all its seeming novelty, however, Aitmatov&#39;s venture into the area of exposé literature has not been an isolated incident. Plakha is only one of a number of recent Soviet novels that focus exclusively on the ills of contemporary Soviet society.The appearance of exposé literature under glasnost could be viewed simply as a direct effect of the loosening of controls under Gorbachev. Its emergence at this time, however, is actually the result of a whole complex of factors, only one political. Soviet literature has already dealt with such issues as the enviro..."
