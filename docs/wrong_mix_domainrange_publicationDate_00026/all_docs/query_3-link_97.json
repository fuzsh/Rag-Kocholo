        "text": "Short Stories\n\nAll posts tagged Short Stories\n\nIt’s possible that I’m one of the very few people who will read this book who has never read a Matthew Scudder novel before. I’m not sure that I’ve ever read any novel by Lawrence Block. I’ve been wanting to read some of Block’s work, and I’ve been in the mood for some ‘hardboiled’ fiction so I thought I’d give this a try. I’m glad I did.\n\nIt should not surprise anyone that someone with Block’s publishing history knows how to tell a good story. What was a surprise, however, was how effortlessly Block managed to combine the classic, hard-boiled detective fiction popular in the 1950’s with the modern day world and modern P.I.\n\nThough I’ve never read a Matthew Scudder novel, I feel as though I got a pretty good handle on the character from these stories. Starting with the first story in the collection, “Out the Window,” we get a idea of Scudder’s keen sense, and observation, his drive to find a conclusion, and that he’s willing to get pretty dirty to find the answers (“I spent the next five days picking the scabs off Paula Wittlauer’s life”).\n\nIn “By the Dawn’s Early Light” we see that Scudder isn’t afraid to do what’s ‘right’ (by his moral standards as well as the general morals of the population) rather than trusting a system that is set up to offer every protection to the accused (and thereby the guilty as well). The story is more a reflection on a past case and the current Scudder does say he would do things differently.\n\nWe also see that Scudder tends to look favorably on the downtrodden, doing what he can for them\n\nI gather that the collection is a bit of a ‘good-bye’ to the character and the final story reflects this, with a core group of the characters gathered for a final time in a favorite local hangout. I suspect this is a place that appears in many of the books.\n\nI really liked this collection and I will be seeking out some of Block’s Matthew Scudder novels based on my readings here. I don’t think I would call these mystery stories specifically (some of them clearly are, like the aforementioned “Out the Window”) but rather a ‘procedural’ or a detective story, where the focus is on a character or their methods instead of on the mystery itself.\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\nGrowing Up with Matt Scudder by Brian Koppelman\n\n“Out the Window”\n\n“A Candle for the Bag Lady”\n\n“By the Dawn’s Early Light”\n\n“Batman’s Helpers”\n\n“The Merciful Angel of Death”\n\n“The Night and the Music”\n\n“Looking for David”\n\n“Let’s Get Lost”\n\n“A Moment of Wrong Thinking”\n\n“Mick Ballou Looks at the Blank Screen”\n\n“One Last Night at Grogan’s”\n\nAbout These Stories…\n\nBeyond the Afterword\n\nA final, technical, note, which does not impact my review; this book, as it was sent to my Kindle, was stripped of some formatting so that the title of each new story was missing. In general, I could tell when a story was finished and therefore when a new one was starting, but I did need to go to the PDF that I was sent as well in order to really see the separation of stories. But I don’t like to read for pleasure from a computer screen – I do enough of that in my day to day work. Hopefully this is resolved for the actual sale purchases of the digital book.\n\nLooking for a good book? The Night and the Music by Lawrence block is a collection of short stories featuring the author’s popular detective, Matthew Scudder. Fans of the Matthew Scudder books won’t want to miss this collection and newcomers, such as myself, will find they don’t need any prior knowledge of the character to enjoy these well written stories.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Night and the Music\n\nauthor: Lawrence Block\n\npublisher: Subterranean Press\n\nISBN: 9781645240273\n\nhardcover, 232 pages\n\nI just discovered this “PM Outspoken Authors” series of books (by PM Press) and as I am a tremendous fan of Kim Stanley Robinson’s work, his was the first volume I chose to read.\n\nThis book, almost a chapbook really, contains Robinson’s short story/novelette “The Lucky Strike” and his short story/essay “A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions” and an interview with Robinson, conducted by Terry Bisson. Both stories center around an alternate history idea of the dropping of the atomic bombs over Japan.\n\n“The Lucky Strike” focuses on Captain Frank January, the bombardier on The Lucky Strike, which is scheduled to make the atomic bomb drop after there are problems with Enola Gay. But January learns of the destructive power of the bomb and has second thoughts about making the drop. One man’s decision has massive, world-wide effects.\n\n“A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions” is a look at ‘the butterfly effect’ and its use in alternate history stories.\n\nI enjoy listening to Robinson talk (I have heard him a couple of times, in person) and I really liked his reflection and comments in the interview with Bisson.\n\nI don’t know that this is a great reflection of Robinson’s writing – I’d recommend either his Mars series or his West Coast series before I’d recommend this to anyone who isn’t familiar with Robinson’s work. But for anyone who enjoys a good, solid science fiction story, as well as a conversation with an intelligent, out-spoken science fiction author, then this is a small volume that is worth reading.\n\nLooking for a good book? Kim Stanley Robinson’s The Lucky Strike, a part of the PM Outspoken Author’s book series, could be a quick read, but the power in the short works leaves the reader with a great deal to think about.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Lucky Strike\n\nauthor: Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nseries: PM Outspoken Authors\n\npublisher: PM Press\n\nISBN: 9781604860856\n\npaperback, 128 pages\n\nIt’s probably just a little surprising to admit that I am not a big Andre Norton fan. Given my penchant for science fiction and fantasy (as well as for cats), Norton’s work would be at the top of my list of favorites, one might think, but based on a couple of novels I’d read in my youth, I’ve never really gotten into her work.\n\nI’m not sure if my tastes have changed significantly with age, or the fact that I typically really like reading short stories, but I enjoyed this collection more than I initially expected (which is always the hope). Still, I’m not really a fan of fantasy stories featuring cats.\n\nThe book starts with a few poems, which I would have to admit, I skimmed over. I just don’t enjoy poetry.\n\nMy favorite story among the collection might have been “The Silent One” which was a bit of a ghost story, and that’s definitely not the kind of fantasy I was expecting with this book. I also really liked “A Very Dickensian Christmas” (which was also a ghost story).\n\n“Swamp Dweller” also stood out as a very good story for me.\n\nThe last group of stories in the collection all featured ‘The Noble Warrior’ – a cat. The stories read well, but I definitely had the impression that these were characters from a novel or series of novels that I hadn’t read.\n\nThis book features the following:\n\nPoems:\n\nFreedom\n\nOmniumgathum Poems\n\nCats\n\nSong of the Barbarian Swordsman\n\nThe Last Cohort\n\nShort Stories:\n\n“Swamp Dweller”\n\n“Get Out of My Dream!”\n\n“Of the Shaping of Ulm’s Heir”\n\n“Rider on a Mountain”\n\n“The Silent One”\n\n“The Nabob’s Gift”\n\n“Nine Threads of Gold”\n\n“A Very Dickensy Christmas”\n\n“Noble Warrior”\n\n“Hob’s Pot”\n\n“Noble Warrior Meets with a Ghost”\n\n“Noble Warrior, Teller of Fortunes”\n\n“Noble Warrior and the “Gentleman””\n\nWhile I am glad I read this and I generally enjoyed my reading, I can’t say that I would be eager to read another volume in the “Tales From High Hallack” collection.\n\nLooking for a good book? Fans of Andre Norton will enjoy this collection of shorter works, Tales From High Hallack, Vol. 2, but those less familiar with Norton’s work should consider becoming familiar with Ms. Norton through some of her better known novels.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nTales From High Hallack, Vol. 2\n\nauthor: Andre Norton\n\nseries: Tales From High Hallack #2\n\npublisher: Premier Digital Publishing\n\nISBN: 9781624672439\n\nhardcover, 300 pages\n\nI know nothing about Iginio Ugo Tarchetti, but the description of these short stories sounded like something right up my alley. “Italian Gothic tales of obsessive love, mysterious phobias, and the hellish curse of everlasting life.” Yes, this sounds fascinating to me.\n\nAnd best of all … I really enjoyed these stories.\n\nWriting roughly around the same time as America’s favorite macabre storyteller, Edgar Allen Poe, Tarchetti shows a great deal of versatility here with these works – from the dark an eerie stories that would rival Poe or Lovecraft, to the humorous to the absurd. It was fun not knowing what i was going to get next with each story. Though with the first major shift in story genre, I did go back to make sure i had opened the correct book on my Kindle because it wasn’t what I was expecting.\n\nUnlike a lot of Western literature from the 19th century, which I often find to be onerous to read, Tarchetti was extremely approachable. His tone was generally quite casual and direct, speaking to the reader in a conversational manner. How much of this is the author and how much is the result of the translation by Lawrence Venuti is hard to say.\n\nI’m really glad to have had the opportunity to read these short stories and to be introduced to a ‘new’ author.\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\n“The Legend of the Black Castle”\n\n“Captain Gubart’s Fortune”\n\n“A Spirit in a Raspberry”\n\n“Bouvard”\n\n“A Dead Man’s Bone”\n\n“The Lake of the Three Lampreys (A Popular Tradition)”\n\n“The Letter U (A Madman’s Manuscript)”\n\n“The Fated”\n\nLooking for a good book? For readers who enjoy a surprise, love short stories, and don’t mind the occasional dark gothic tale, Iginio Ugo Tarchetti’s Fantastic Tales is a book to look for.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nFantastic Tales\n\nauthor: Iginio Ugo Tarchetti\n\ntranslator: Lawrence Venuti\n\npublisher: Archipelago Books\n\nISBN: 9781939810625\n\npaperback, 260 pages\n\nSometimes I read a ‘classic’ author and I wonder why the heck anyone thinks it’s still worth reading, and other times I will read a ‘classic’ author and realize that the author is still relevant and accessible and well worth reading. This collection of early short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald fits comfortably in the latter category.\n\nOddly enough, I’m not a huge fan of Fitzgerald’s novels, but I’ve long admired his short works. I feel as though his short fiction really captures the era – the jazz age (coined by Fitzgerald) – better than any other author of the time. I see it in the characters who always seem to be on the verge of crossing from innocence to experience within the confines of the stories.\n\nSometimes this transformation is not too subtle (remember, these are Fitzgerald’s early short stories) as in the first story “Babes in the Woods” – the second section of which opens with “Isabelle and Kenneth were distinctly not innocent, nor were they particularly hardened.”\n\nConsider also ‘Omar’ (not the young man’s name, but …”I just call you Omar because you remind me of a smoked cigarette”) who has fallen in love with Marcia Meadow and says, “Every person I’ve met on the streets since I met you has made me jealous because they knew what love was before I did.”\n\nI also noticed twice Fitzgerald describes the discovery of kisses – “kisses that were not a promise but a fulfillment” and “kisses that were like charity, creating want by holding back nothing at all” – which also seem to describe that moment of a characters step into a new stage of life.\n\nMy favorite story here was “The Camel’s Back” (from 1920) in which Perry Parkhurst decides that his long-time engagement to Betty Medill has gone on long enough so he presents her with an ultimatum: get married immediately or part ways. They do part ways, which sends Perry into a funk and he retreats to alcohol. Where does the camel’s back come in? You’ll have tor read the story.\n\nSome of these stories are clearly not as polished as Fitzgerald’s later works, but that’s part of the charm in reading them, knowing that these are early works from a master.\n\nI highly recommend this collection.\n\nIncluded in the book:\n\n“Babes in the Woods”\n\n“The Pierian Springs and the Last Straw”\n\n“Sentiment—And the Use of Rouge”\n\n“The Spire and the Gargoyle”\n\n“Benediction”\n\n“The Camel’s Back”\n\n“The Cut-Glass Bowl”\n\n“Dalyrimple Goes Wrong”\n\n“The Four Fists”\n\n“Head and Shoulders”\n\n“The Lees of Happiness”\n\n“The Smilers”\n\n“Jemina, the Mountain Girl”\n\n“Tarquin of Cheapside”\n\n“The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”\n\n“Winter Dreams”\n\nLooking for a good book? The Early Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald is a wonderful collection of short fiction by a master story-teller.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Early Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\nauthor: F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\npublisher: Dover Publications\n\nISBN: 9780486794655\n\npaperback, 256 pages\n\nI really do enjoy short stories, and when a book is a collection of short works by one of my favorite fantasy authors I’m really interested.\n\nLaughter at the Academy is a collection of short works by Seanan McGuire, author of the October Daye series, Wayward Children series, Ghost Roads series, InCryptid series, and more!\n\nLike nearly every collection or anthology of short stories I’ve ever read, there are some stories I really liked, some that didn’t do anything for me, and some that were a pleasant enough way to pass some time but maybe not particularly memorable.\n\nMy two favorites were “Down, Deep Down, Below the Waves” and “The Tolling of Pavlov’s Bells.” “Down, Deep Down…” bears a resemblance to Into the Drowning Deep (as written by Mira Grant – McGuire’s pseudonym) – one of my favorite dark fantasy novels. In the short story, we are in the future where all-female submarine crews see women being modified to become mermaids.\n\n“The Tolling of Pavlov’s Bells” makes McGuire seem quite prescient as the story is about a pandemic. She writes in her introduction to the story:\n\nI also believe that the modern world’s disdain for quarantine\n\nand willingness to support structures which encourage its violation\n\nis going to do a great deal of damage one day…and that with new\n\ndiseases emerging regularly from a variety of sources, that day may\n\nnot be particularly far in the future.\n\nThe story is copyright 2011 and the introduction was probably written in 2018 or 2019. This story also connects to a series of books written by McGuire as Mira Grant (the Parasitology series).\n\nI didn’t care at all for “#connollyhouse #weshouldntbehere” – a short story told through a series of tweets. Style over story just never works well for me.\n\nI think that one of McGuire’s strengths is her ability to plot a story and the natural progression or growth of her characters. These things are more easily seen in longer works and sometimes, due to the nature of a short story, we don’t see these things as often in this collection. We see it best in “Down, Deep Down…” – which is the longest of the works here.\n\nBut it is fun to see the growth in McGuire’s craftsmanship and her ability to really capture the nuances of individuals.\n\nAlthough McGuire notes in her introduction that “All these stories take place outside my pre-existing universes…” I’ve already noted a connection to two series, and other stories, such as “Driving Jenny Home,” which feels like it could be a Ghost Roads story, have a tendency to lean heavily toward some of her pre-existing universes, even if they don’t fall directly in.\n\nLooking for a good book? I wouldn’t necessarily recommend Seanan McGuire’s Laughter at the Academy for first-time readers of Ms McGuire, but for those who enjoy her books, this is a really variety pack – a little bit of all the different styles she writes.\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Laughter at the Academy: A Field Study in the Genesis of Schizotypal Creative Genius Personality Disorder (SCGPD)”\n\n“Lost”\n\n“The Tolling of Pavlov’s Bells”\n\n“Uncle Sam”\n\n“Crystal Halloway and the Forgotten Passage”\n\n“Emeralds to Emeralds, Dust to Dust”\n\n“Homecoming”\n\n“Frontier ABCs: The Life and Times of Charity Smith, Schoolteacher”\n\n“We Are All Misfit Toys in the Aftermath of the Velveteen War”\n\n“The Lambs”\n\n“Each to Each”\n\n“Bring About the Halloween Eternal!!!”\n\n“Office Memos”\n\n“Lady Antheia’s Guide to Horticultural Warfare”\n\n“Driving Jenny Home”\n\n“There Is No Place for Sorrow in the Kingdom of the Cold”\n\n“In Skeleton Leaves”\n\n“Please Accept My Most Profound Apologies for What Is About to Happen (But You Started It)”\n\n“Threnody for Little Girl, With Tuna, at the End of the World”\n\n“From A to Z in the Book of Changes”\n\n“#connollyhouse #weshouldntbehere”\n\n“Down, Deep Down, Below the Waves”\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nLaughter at the Academy\n\nauthor: Seanan McGuire\n\npublisher: Subterranean Press\n\nISBN: 1596069287\n\nhardcover, 376 pages\n\nI last remember reading Edgar Allan Poe’s fiction back in middle school, and his poetry when I was in college so I thought it was well past time to dig into some of his work again. And what a treat to do so!\n\nPublisher Dover, who repeatedly does a very good job publishing no-frills ‘thrift’ editions of classic works, has done a fine job here, giving us a lot of Poe. And let’s be honest here, a little Poe goes a long way, so a lot of Poe needs to be read over lengthy periods of time.\n\nWhat I found is that Poe’s short stories still show why he’s a master story-teller and why students still read his works in school. There’s a lot of power and suspense in his short works. Stories like “The Fall of the House of Usher” and “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Pit and the Pendulum” (the first story I ever remember reading by Poe) still hold up well against modern fiction, though some of the formality of the language does seem archaic at times.\n\nI’m not a person inclined to read poetry much but one of my favorite poems has been Poe’s The Raven. Once again, I was reminded why I like this so much as I read through it. Poe combines the power of the rhythm with an almost supernatural, dark story and it really sucks you in. I also enjoyed “The Bells” – a poem I’d not known about. Poe definitely caught the sense of ringing bells in this work. The rest of the poetry for me was, “eh.”\n\nThe one longer work included here was The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym (sometimes referred to as The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket). I think this was my first encounter with the book and I was not impressed. It felt unnecessarily drawn out and I was interminably bored through 90% of the book.\n\nBut the gem here for me was some of Poe’s non-fiction.\n\n“Maelzel’s Chess Player” is an article Poe wrote, exposing the fraud behind an automaton chess player known as ‘The Turk’ which was touring Europe and America in the mid-1820’s. It’s a really interesting read and you don’t have to know ‘The Turk’ as Poe’s article describes it quite thoroughly.\n\nAnd finally we get The Philosophy of Composition” in which Poe writes about how good writers write when they write well. (Thanks, Wikipedia.) Examining his own work, Poe chooses his poem “The Raven” – which I’ve already mentioned as one of my favorite poems. Getting insight on how he wrote this iconic work is quite interesting. I’m a little disappointed that my college professor who introduced me to the poem didn’t share this article as well (we didn’t have the internet when I was a college student, friends).\n\nI had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven—the bird of ill omen—monotonously repeating the one word, “Nevermore,” at the conclusion of each stanza, in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object supremeness, or perfection, at all points, I asked myself—“Of all melancholy topics, what, according to the universal understanding of mankind, is the most melancholy?” Death—was the obvious reply. “And when,” I said, “is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?” From what I have already explained at some length, the answer, here also, is obvious—“When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: the death, then, of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world—and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover.”\n\nI had now to combine the two ideas, of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a Raven continuously repeating the word “Nevermore.”—I had to combine these, bearing in mind my design of varying, at every turn, the application of the word repeated; but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the Raven employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover.\n\nFascinating.\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\nFICTION\n\nMS.

If you haven’t read Edgar Allan Poe in a long time (or not at all), then you really should pick up The Dover Reader: Edgar Allan Poe. There is a reason his works are still published – they are good.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nEdgar Allan Poe: The Dover Reader\n\nauthor: Edgar Allan Poe\n\npublisher: Dover Publications\n\nISBN: 048679119X\n\npaperback, 544 pages\n\nBack sometime in the late 1980′ or early 1990’s, when I was working in a bookstore, I remember publishers trying out a ‘new’ trend, releasing very thin paperback books – novelettes and novellas really – usually older works by noted authors. The idea was that with the quickly rising costs of printing books, this was an affordable way for readers to connect with their favorite authors. The idea did not catch on. (Some of those books were so thin it was hard to understand how they could get a perfect binding.)\n\nBut as almost any self-published author today will tell you, selling a novelette or novella in digital format is not only easy, it makes a lot of sense. People will often shell out a dollar or two for a quick read. And now that the publishers are getting back on board with this, publishing a recognizable and renowned author’s short works for a $1, I suspect that the market might just explode.\n\nThe only problem here, however, is that publishers are taking old works, easily found in a collection elsewhere, and trying to get us to buy them again. Will we do it? I guess it depends on how much you want to reread that story and would rather just put it on a Kindle for a dollar rather than search your bookshelf or your library for the same story. It so happens that I really like Anne Tyler and I’d but this for a buck.\n\nTyler writes brilliantly about ordinary people and ordinary tragedies. “Teenage Wasteland” is one of those ordinary tragedies.\n\nDaisy Coble tries to be a good mother. She only wants what’s best for her son, but she’s not equipped with the life skills to provide. She’s distraught when she learns that Donny is misbehaving at school, and she is sick with grief that she has failed as a parent.\n\nDoing the best she can, she hires a tutor for Donny, though the tutor has some unusual ideas on how to help the boy, and the gap between mother and son widens until it is too much of a chasm to bridge.\n\nThis is not a feel-good story. This is a tragedy and reading a short story that isn’t necessarily positive (I think there are some positive aspects here) is difficult for a lot people.\n\nOne of the bigger issues with the story is actually that it leaves the reader with so many questions. I don’t mind some questions when I finish a book or a story, but this little slice of Daisy and Donny’s lives with so many unanswered questions, and a lost and bewildered Daisy that it’s hard to understand what benefit there was to reading this.\n\nThis is the sort of book or story that needs to be read in a classroom or a book club so that people can talk about it. The story begs discussion.\n\nLooking for a good book? If you don’t belong to a group that talks about books, you might want to skip Anne Tyler’s “Teenage Wasteland.” But if you do have a reader’s group, consider giving this a read.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\n“Teenage Wasteland”\n\nauthor: Anny Tyler\n\npublisher: Vintage\n\nASIN: B08H19LY7X\n\nKindle Edition, 18 pages\n\nSuperheroes and sex – two big topics in today’s market. I’ve read a number of superhero-related books in the past couple of years, but never one specifically one looking at erotic/sometimes-graphic sexual scenarios, but, why not? I would think this is the perfect time for a book like this. This particular book is a collection of short fiction and like nearly every anthology I’ve ever read, there are some stories here that i liked, some I didn’t, and some that were fairly average.\n\nThe first of three that stood out in a positive light was “Time for No Mercy” by Elizabeth Schechter. I liked the look at politics and political correctness, but I also liked the science and the idea of developing a widespread morning-after type spray that would allow women to not get pregnant any time they didn’t want to, and here the hero was trying to stop it. This was well written and thoughtful and it really had me thinking afterward.\n\nNext was “No Words Needed” by David T. Valentin in which a young man can’t decide what’s caught his attention the most – that he has superpowers he’s only just discovered, or that the guy he likes happens to like him back. This was well-written and tasteful.\n\nAnd finally, by the editor of the anthology, Rachel Kenley, we have “Just Be Yourself.” This was probably the best written story here. The ‘romance’ is dialed up a notch – in fact gets pretty graphic. But unlike a lot of erotica, where the sex drives a meager plot, this is definitely plot-driven with some steamy sex. And I chuckled at the sentence: “She had a moment to wish her underwear was sexier, then decided it didn’t matter because she wouldn’t be wearing it much longer.”\n\nOn the negative end I’d start with “Swiftly in Love” by Stella B. James. I don’t even want to go into it. This was just a big ‘no’ for me.\n\n“The Little Push” by Christopher Peruzzi was also at the bottom. the story, the writing, the characters … nothing clicked.\n\nThe rest were quite average. Nothing was interesting enough that I wanted to read more by any particular author (other than Rachel Kenley). For an anthology, especially one with only a dozen or so stories, average is about what I would expect.\n\nThis anthology includes:\n\nIntroduction by Rachel Kenley\n\n“Flying Fast, Falling Hard” by Kim Strattford\n\n“Where There’s Smoke” by E.D. Gonzalez\n\n“Trust Paradox” by Naomi Hinchen\n\n“Time for No Mercy” by Elizabeth Schechter\n\n“No Words Needed” by David T. Valentin\n\n“Swiftly in Love” by Stella B. James\n\n“Supergay” by Julie Behrens\n\n“The Little Push” by Christopher Peruzzi\n\n“Foolproof” by Louisa Bacio\n\n“Just Be Yourself” by Rachel Kenley\n\n“Love, Law, and the Whippoorwill” by Austin Worley\n\nAuthor Bios\n\nLooking for a good book? The anthology, Under the Cape, edited by Rachel Kenley is a pretty average collection of short fiction featuring superheroes and romance/erotica.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nUnder The Cape: An Anthology of Superhero Romance\n\neditor: Rachel Kenley\n\npublisher: Riverdale Avenue\n\nISBN: 1626015597\n\npaperback, 320 pages\n\nStories inspired by paintings? That makes a lot of sense. Stories, many by noted and respected authors, of classic, respected works of art? This should be really fantastic.\n\nShould be, but isn’t.\n\nIn his foreword, editor Lawrence Block notes that this was to be a follow-up to his previous collection (In Sunlight or in Shadow) but that he didn’t get the exciting responses he had hoped, and even after getting commitments, two writers were not able to deliver – including Block himself. The general impression is that this was not a priority for many involved.\n\nOverall the stories are a bit dull and uninspired. This is odd, given the quality of the art that inspires them and that each author was able to select the artwork they wished. While I recognize that the artwork served as ‘inspiration’ (which can be very liberally applied) I generally couldn’t make the connection between artwork and story, or I found the connection extremely tenuous.\n\nSome of the authors here are authors whose work I regularly read, which is part of what drew me to the collection.\n\nTwo stories stood out for me – one for being quite enjoyable and the other not so much.\n\nSarah Weinman’s “The Big Town” (inspired by Nude in the Studio by Lilias Torrance Newton) is the final story in the book and is far and away the best piece included. Aside from the fact that this story is also most obviously connected with the painting among all the stories, the work is moody and reflects the era of the artwork. It’s excellently written and the narrative builds well. My interest in the story was captured early and held on all the way through. I’ve never read anything by Weinman prior to this, but I’ll be looking for more of her work now.\n\nMy least favorite piece was “Truth Comes Out of Her Well to Shame Mankind” by Thomas Pluck (inspired by La Vérité sortant du puits by Jean Léon Gerome). The title was perhaps my favorite, and the title, when taken in context of the painting, was really intriguing. But my one word comment at the end of the story was … “Yuck.”\n\nDavid Morrell’s story here is interesting and well done … and nearly memorable (as I looked back through the book to write this review, I remarked “oh yeah, that was okay”).\n\nThe rest really were quite average. Not inspiring and not particularly memorable, which makes the book a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\nForeword: Before we Begin… by Lawrence Block\n\n“Safety Rules by Jill D. Block\n\n“Pierre, Lucien, and Me” by Lee Child\n\n“Girl With a Fan” by Nicholas Christopher\n\n“The Third Panel” by Michael Connelly\n\n“A Significant Find” by Jeffrey Deaver\n\n“Charlie the Barber” by Joe R.

Alive in Shape and Color, edited by Lawrence Block, is a collection of stories inspired by works of art, written by noted authors, and should be much more appealing than it is.

I’d discovered her Accidental Alchemist series by … well … by accident, and found them really unique and great fun to read. I sought out her other works and came across the Jaya Jones series. Think, female Indiana Jones, but cleverer.\n\nThis book is a collection of short stories in the Jaya Jones series. There are eight short stories and one “bonus” novella (what makes it a bonus when it comes between the covers of a book? The fact that it’s not a short story?) included here, most of which have been published in various magazines or anthologies, but one of which at least is new to this collection. Since I almost never read mystery short stories, these are all new me.\n\nNot everyone can write short stories and novels – the two forms are different enough to make it challenging. But it impresses me how Pandian is able to write as smoothly here – giving us thoughtful, challenging, mystery plots for some of her familiar characters.\n\nIt’s hard to pick a favorite here, as I liked them all quite a bit. “The Hindi Houdini” stands out to me – Sanjay Rai is the main character here and it’s a good mystery. His is also the main character in “The Curse of Cloud Castle.”\n\nPandian’s first published work, “The Shadow of the Rover” is also included here. It was interesting to note that this is the only work featuring Jaya Jones that has a different narrator. While I enjoyed the story, this was not a piece that would have driven me to seeking more of her work.\n\nIn addition to appreciating Gigi Pandian’s writing a little more, this book has also opened me up to reading more short story mysteries. Any recommendations?\n\nThis book contains the following:\n\nIntroduction: Why Do We Like Our Rooms Locked? by Laurie R. King\n\nForeword: In the Tradition of John Dickson Carr by Douglas G. Greene\n\n“The Cambodian Curse”\n\n“The Hindi Houdini”\n\n“The Haunted Room”\n\n“The Library Ghost of Tanglewood Inn”\n\n“The Curse of Cloud Castle”\n\n“Tempest in a Teapot”\n\n“A Dark and Stormy Light”\n\n“The Shadow of the River”\n\n“Fool’s Gold”\n\nLooking for a good book? Whether you’ve read any of Gigi Pandian’s Jaya Jones mystery books before, or not, this collection of short mystery stories, The Cambodian Curse and Other Stories, is worth reading,\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Edelweiss, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Cambodian Curse and Other Stories\n\nauthor: Gigi Pandian\n\nseries: Jaya Jones Treasure hunt Mystery\n\npublisher: Henery Press\n\nISBN: 1635114187\n\npaperback, 270 pages\n\nIf you are like me, when someone says “mermaid” images of Ariel from Disney’s The Littlest Mermaid film, or Daryl Hannah from the film Splash come to mind. Though lately the other image might be a creature looking half human, half fish, with piranha-like teeth – from Mira Grant’s excellent book Into the Drowning Deep. But if you are expecting a collection of these sorts of mermaids, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\nEditors Cristina Bacchilega and Marie Alohalani Brown have gathered mermaid stories and legends from all over the world. The term ‘mermaid,’ however, is quite loosely defined for the purposes of gathering the stories for this book. Any human-like creature that lives primarily in the water is acceptable here.\n\nIt did take me awhile to get used to this concept that the idea of a ‘mermaid’ could be so drastically different from culture to culture. For instance, this book contains a tale from the Passamaquoddy tradition, here titled “Of the Woman Who Loved a Serpent Who Lived in a Lake” in which the ‘mermaid’ is more snake than fish, and male. It’s an odd tale as the woman who interacts with the serpent/mer-being is a vessel for the serpent’s poison, transferring it to her husband’s (multiple, as they die shortly after being with her). My note from the reading is simply: “Mermaid?”\n\nI enjoyed this collection quite a bit, and I enjoyed expanding my knowledge of the mermaid concept, but at the same time, I can’t say that this was overwhelmingly ‘good.’ Only one story/legend stood out for me: “Julnar the Mermaid and Her Son Badar Basim of Persia.” Wait … does this sound familiar? It should … it’s more commonly known as “Julnar the Sea-Born and Her Son Kind Badr Basim of Persia” and it’s the 23rd chapter from Tales from the Arabian Nights.\n\nThis is actually one of the things I really appreciated about this book … the research of so many different sources for mermaid/sea-creature stories. I also learned a few things (“Ningyo, the Japanese word for mermaid, has no gender.”) and it did occur to me that the purpose to read a collection like this is not so much for ‘pleasure’ but for knowledge or perspective or cultural significance or social significance (which is not to say some of us don’t take great pleasure in expanding our knowledge or perspective or …).\n\nLooking for a good book? If you are willing to expand your horizons and your concept of what a mermaid is, you should give The Penguin Book of Mermaids (edited by Cristina Bacchilega and Marie Alohalani Brown) a read. But don’t expect too many stories that project a Daryl Hannah style creature.\n\nI received a digital copy of this book from the publisher, through Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe Penguin Book of Mermaids\n\neditors: Cristina Bacchilega and Marie Alohalani Brown\n\npublisher: Penguin Books\n\nISBN: 0143133721\n\npaperback, 368 pages"
