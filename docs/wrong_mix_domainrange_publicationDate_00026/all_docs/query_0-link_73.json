        "text": "Technological Ideology\n\nA human or alien civilization could be at the same technology level as our human protagonists from the Terran empire. But tech levels are the clunky one-dimensional way of measuring the relative technological advancement of a given culture. All the cool science fiction writers are using Tech Trees in their novels.\n\nTech trees give far more flavor to various cultures. Culture Alfa may have advanced relatively far down the subatomic physics branch of the tree, but be relatively ignorant of the organic chemistry branch. For Culture Bravo the situation may be the reverse. Compare this to the dull situation where according to tech levels, both Alfa and Bravo are exactly the same at Tech Level Six.\n\nIn other words, different cultures emphasize different branches of the tech tree. In contemporary culture here on Terra the current state of nuclear physics and computer science is pretty darn advanced, but the state of sociology and psychology is woefully primitive.\n\nIn fact, some cultures might be altogether unaware of the existance of certain branches.\n\nTechnologies in Conflict\n\nA popular trend in science fiction (and sometimes in the real world) are underlying philosophies and ideologies setting the direction of technological advance. For example, from the real world we have the debate over fossil-fuel energy as opposed to renewable energy.\n\nSince science fiction is literature, and commonly has a theme of conflict, there are often two major ideologies. And they don't like each other very much.\n\nBruce Sterling (perhaps inspired by Freeman Dyson's essay \"The Greening of the Galaxy\" found in his book Disturbing the Universe) created his Shaper/Mechanist universe. Both factions are posthuman civilizations. The Shapers direction of technology is advancement by manipulating the human body: genentic engineering and psychological training. Mechanists on the other hand direct their technology along the lines of cybernetic implants, computer software, drugs, and permanently implanted space suits. The third faction is the traditionalists who like human bodies the way they are right now, thank you very much, and do not like either the Shapers nor the Mechanists.\n\nIn Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space universe most of the factions are reasonably human, except for the Conjoiners. They use technology to augmenting human consciousness, creating group minds and amplyfing intelligence. They actually created a mini-Singularity called the Transenlightenment. Of course this triggered a war with the other more conventional-human factions. The Conjoiners eventually lost the war, fled the solar system, and colonized other systems.\n\nOrganic Technology\n\nThis is a age-old sci-fi trope. The idea is: why make tools and gadgets by hammering metal and soldering electronics when you can genetically engineer animals into living tools?\n\nScience fiction writers tend to equip their aliens with organic technology just to make them unique and different, not because it makes any sense. Unfortunately this has been used so often that it has its own entry in TV Tropes. So much for \"unique and different\"\n\nAbout the only use case where organic technology makes sense is for use by an alien species that lives underwater. It is real hard to smelt iron when fire doesn't burn underwater, and equally hard to use electronics when the blasted seawater keeps short-circuiting everything. But existing aquatic creatures can be genetically engineered to be tools or electronics, and work just fine underwater.\n\nThe other advantage associated with organic tech is that broken machines can try to heal themselves. This generally appears in science fiction in the form of a organic living starship recovering from damage inflicted by meteors or hostile weapons fire.\n\nThirdly, instead of manufacturing tools and machines, with organic tech you might be able to breed them.\n\nRocketCat points out some of the draw-backs.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Greening of the Galaxy\n\nPentapods from 2300AD RPG: \"an amphibious species with a preference for aquatic environments, with a biotechnological technical infrastructure (including starships that are massive living beings)\". Their equipment works very well, but is usually damp and has to be regularly given food and water.\n\nTyranids from the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Imagine if the Xenomorphs from the Alien movies had genetically engineered themselves to produce living starships, combat creatures, and weapons. Tyranid organic technology has the classic \"warm, moist, skooshy and drips goo everywhere\" along with a side order of \"far too many sharp pointy bits.\"\n\nZ'ensam from Rogue Powers by Roger MacBride Allen. Though the Z'ensam aliens appear to have only a medieval level of technology, that is only with conventional technology. Their covert organic technology is terrifyingly powerful. You see, the species somehow actually has the innate power of Lamarckism. Changes in an individual Z'ensam will be passed on genetically to its offspring. Including surgical changes. In other words they discovered genetic engineering before they discovered how to use fire or chip flint. The bad guys think that the Z'ensam are just lizard cave-men who are good at biological warfare, so they contract them to make some combat germs. The bad guys find out too late that they are at the Z'ensam's mercy.\n\nTnuctip from Larry Niven's Known Space series. These were an alien species, enslaved by the Thrints. Covertly they used genetic engineering to create things that were apparently of value to their masters, but turned out to be harmful. Items included Stage Trees (trees that created a core of rocket fuel as they grew, to make cheap rocket boosters), Sunflowers (tall plants whose silver parabolic flowers can focus sunlight into deadly beams, used to protect Thrint households), and Bandersnatchi (thought to be non-sentient food beasts, they were actually both sentient and immune to the Thrint telepathic slavery)\n\nLiving Spaceships. Another well-used troup\n\nThe Crucible of Time by John Brunner. The pneumatic aliens of the saga use bio-engineered animals for most of their technological history. But they are not above using metal-based tech when they start building rocket ships.\n\nLords of the Psychon by Daniel Galouye. Aliens who are energy creatures conquer Terra. Their technology is based on a weird energy called \"psychon plasma\", which can only be controlled by thought. The aliens periodically hunt and kill humans in order to harvest bits of their brain. So if the aliens want a support truss for a machine, they take a bit of still-living human brain tissue, force it to constantantly think of being a support truss, and link it to a measure of psychon plasma. Instant support truss.\n\nGaean series by John Varley. The titanic ring-like structures around Saturn appear to be space habitats. They are, but they are made from organic-tech, not metal-tech. And they are intelligent too.\n\nAmnion from The Gap Cycle by Stephen Donaldson. All their tools and artifacts are manufactured by genetically engineered organisms. This is one of the few science fiction stories where it is made clear that organic tech is inferior to human technology.\n\nYilanè from West of Eden by Harry Harrison. Everything they use on a daily basis is a genetically modified creature.\n\nDavey Jones' Ambassador by Raymond Gallun. The squid-people who live on the ocean floor are forced to use organic aquatic tech for the usual reasons. They bio-engineer organisms to serve as everything from transportation to weapons to architectural elements, and produce whatever substances they need as secretions from these creatures.\n\nEarly Bird by Theodore R. Cogswell and Theodore L. Thomas.\n\nOn a very weird planet, the local apex predator has internal organic weapons: lasers, missiles, particle beams, that sort of thing. Momma creature lays an egg (about the size of an aircraft hangar) then broadcasts on the mating frequency. All male creatures in range elevate their artillery and fire off a volley of sub-orbital spermatozoon missles, targeting the egg. Momma creature sets up an anti-missile barrage, because she only wants the missile with the highest combat skill to survive and fertilize her egg.\n\nOur hero is in a fighter spacecraft, at war with some hostile aliens. He passes nearby the egg. Momma creature is astonished at the combat power of the space fighter. She uses a tractor-beam to grab the fighter and causes it to crash into her egg and fertilize it.\n\nThe egg hatchs, and our hero wakes to find that his space fighter has been hybridized into the ultimate war machine, using organic tech. He finds the rest of his fighter wing and has them fertilize other eggs. The hybrid fighters then fly off and proceed to kick the living snot out of the entire hostile alien armada.\n\nThe Flintstones. Any machine not made out of rock is made out of a re-purposed dinosaur\n\nOrganic Spacecraft\n\nSpacecraft that are partially or totally composed of a living creature are a neat-oh, keen-oh, golly-gee-whiz science fiction idea that apparently was invented by Robert Sheckley in 1953. The concept turns up occasionally when the author wants to throw in something weird to remind their readers that they ain't in Kansas any more. Justifications include:\n\nThe organic ship can be \"spawned\" as a tiny sprat and automatically grown to full size by feeding it, instead of requiring a spacecraft graving dock in a shipyard and large numbers of skilled workers to build the blasted thing\n\nComponent breakage and combat damage can be \"healed\" instead of requiring the ship to be towed to a repair yard\n\nThe author insists for handwaving reasons that organic ships are somehow much better than conventional dead metal ships, even though that does not make logical sense.\n\nRocketCat says if you want something organic you can go look in his litter box.\n\nAnother common type of organic spacecraft is a Space Tree equipped with an engine. Those are listed here because most space tree are stationary.\n\nAquatic Technology\n\nMost science fiction authors and many real scientists are of the opinion that any alien race that live underwater are going to have a real problem trying to advance out of the stone age and develop science. All that water is a problem. For one thing the water is most counter-productive if one is trying to discover fire and all the technology it enables.\n\nThe standard science fiction dodge is to postulate the aquatic aliens using organic technology. Aquatic aliens do not need to figure out how to make fire burn underwater in order to smelt steel, not if they can genetically engineer the local equivalent of whales into living submarines. Living things can be created without fire, and water is their natural element.\n\nIn lieu of aquatic aliens using organic technology, the fallback science fiction dodge is that some air-breathing aliens (like humans) visit the aquatic aliens and give (or sell) them enough air-based tech so that they can bootstrap themselves. Tech like remote control robot drones that can be use to mine metals and build factories on islands, while the aquatic aliens can control the drones from the comfort of adjacent lagoons. This same dodge is often used to give high technology to aliens living in the atmospheres of gas giant planets. Such aliens are not handicapped by living in water, but they do have a problem with a lack of land area to lay their tools and equipment on.\n\nThe other major drawback that science fiction authors love to harp on is that aquatic spacecraft life-support systems are difficult. You see, with gas breathing mix like we humans use, the gas can be compressed into tanks so it takes up less room. Sadly, water is almost totally uncompressible. The aquatic breathing mix tanks are going to be huge.\n\nFor computers and digital devices, slebetman and Journeyman Geek are of the opinion that the logical thing for an aquatic race to do is use Fluidics aka \"fluid logic\". This uses pneumatics and hydraulics instead of electronics to do analog and digital operations. Note that such devices are more or less immune to electromagnetic interference, ionizing radiation, and EMP; unlike electronic devices. Fluidics also will not suffer catastrophic electrical short circuits if immersed in sea water, also unlike electronic devices.\n\nOne of the main draw-backs of fluidic computers is the maximum clock frequency is only a tens of kilohertz, as compared to the gigahertz typical to computers such as the one you are using to read this website. This means an aquatic race using fluidics would try the parallel, multi-core approach much sooner than we did.\n\nThe second-most serious drawback is fluidics cannot be miniaturized anywhere near the scale of electronics. At a rough guess a halfway powerful computer will fill a room, much like old vacuum tube computers.\n\nBefore aquatic aliens developed digital fluidics, they might start with fluid analog computers such as water integrators and the Phillips Hydraulic Computer.\n\nAfter the limits of fluidic computing were reached, it would be relatively easy to make the conceptual leap to optical computing.\n\nClockwork Technology\n\nBasically this is technology that uses no electricity or electronics (digital or otherwise). There are some applications where this is an advantage. And I am not really talking about SteamPunk, though they do bear a superficial resemblance to each other.\n\nPlanned Obsolescence\n\nEugenics\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nEnd of Natural Selection\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nMutants\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nStratified Cities\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nThe Death of Cities\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nMuseums\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nImmortality\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nDecadent Population\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nCasual FTL Travel\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nYou-Simulator\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nIntelligence Amplification\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nMind Control\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nTechnomages\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nThe Singularity\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nRevolt of the AIs\n\nThis section has been moved here.\n\nGalactic Survey▶\n\nGalactic Survey▶\n\nAtomic Rockets notices\n\nThis week's featured addition is SPIN POLARIZATION FOR FUSION PROPULSION\n\nThis week's featured addition is INsTAR\n\nThis week's featured addition is NTR ALTERNATIVES TO LIQUID HYDROGEN\n\nAtomic Rockets search\n\nAtomic Rockets information\n\n©1995-2023 Winchell Chung (鄭) (ᚾᚤᚱᚫᚦ) ρ=Σ+Ψ\n\nPage last modified\n\nAug. 24, 2022, 01:10 UTC"
