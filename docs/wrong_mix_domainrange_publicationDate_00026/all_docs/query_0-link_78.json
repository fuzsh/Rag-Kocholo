He is easy of access to all; but if he chances to get familiar with one whose vices admit no correction, he manages to loosen and let go the intimacy rather than to break it off suddenly Hence he amused himself with composing epigrams when a young man, and enjoyed Lucian above all writers. Indeed, it was he who pushed me to write the ‘In Praise of Folly’ that is to say, he made a camel frisk. ‘Morias Encomium’ can also be read as ‘In praise of ____.’”\n\n157. This description, however, is contrary to how this character has been portrayed in Hilary Mantel’s double Booker winning series.
