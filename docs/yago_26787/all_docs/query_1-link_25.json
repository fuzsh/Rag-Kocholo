        "text": "Africa is a continent divided into 54 countries, among which French, English, Italian, German and Dutch are usually spoken. In addition to these European languages, there are local dialects, indigenous languages and tribal languages specific to each region. Together with the European language, they are the official languages on state documents.\n\nIn this article, we take a look at these specific languages, which stem from the tribal heritage of each country. We tell you all about these languages, which are spoken every day by both urban and rural dwellers. What languages are spoken in Congo, Kenya, Comoros and Madagascar?\n\nTo answer this question, we’ll start by looking at the languages used in the Congos, then move on to the official languages of Kenya, continue with the official languages of the Comoros and finish with the official languages of Madagascar.\n\nCongos :\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo:\n\nA French-speaking colony, the Democratic Republic of Congo has 5 official languages. These are French and 4 Bantu languages, each with its own specificities and differences. The 4 languages are part of the country’s national languages and are heard on a daily basis in the streets of the DRC.\n\nBantu languages is the term used to designate all the languages of Central Africa. The term was first used by the German linguist Wilhelm Bleek in 1851.\n\nLingala :\n\nLingala, a language that emerged around the 19th century, is a lingua franca that has evolved into a regional language. It is spoken in large parts of the Congo. In Kinshasa, for example, Lingala is more widely used than Kikongo ya leta, and many artists and media outlets use the language in their songs and for communication.\n\nIn particular, it is used in the songs of sexion d’assaut wati by night.\n\nThe language is spoken by both Congos.\n\nKituba :\n\nKituba, Kikongo ya leta or munukutuba, Kikongo ya leta or Government Kikongo is a language spoken by 4 million people in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe language was originally spoken between Africans and the region’s traders, explorers and settlers. Today, the language is used in government, on the radio and on television.\n\nThe language is spoken by both Congos.\n\nKiswahili :\n\nKiswahili is a vernacular language of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Kiswahili shows signs of creolisation, as well as numerous borrowings, notably from Arabic.\n\nTshiluba :\n\nTshiluba, or Ciluba, also known as Luba-Lulua or Luba-Kasai, is one of the 4 official languages of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The language is mainly spoken by the Baluba people of Kasai in the south of the country.\n\nRepublic of Congo :\n\nA French colony, the Republic of Congo has 3 official languages: French, Lingala and Kituba. They are the main means of expression in the country.\n\nLingala :\n\nA very popular language in sub-Saharan Africa, Lingala is one of Congo’s national languages.\n\nKituba :\n\nKituba, kikongo ya leta or munukutuba, kikongo ya leta or government kikongo is the first language of the Republic of Congo.\n\nKenya :\n\nAn English colony which gained independence on 12 December 1963, Kenya has a single official language in addition to English. Swahili is used by at least 12 million people as a second language.\n\nSwahili :\n\nA neighbouring language to Kiswahili, Swahili is widely spoken in Kenya. The language has been spoken on the African continent since the 17th century. Old poems in Swahili can be found on the Lamu archipelago in the north of the country.\n\nComoros :\n\nA former French colony, the Comoros speak French, Comorian and Arabic. The Comoros archipelago is made up of 4 islands where the practice of one of the 3 languages mentioned below is recommended. The islands are home to 900,000 inhabitants, all of whom speak at least one of the three languages.\n\nArabic :\n\nUnsurprisingly, Arabic is spoken in Comoros, a vestige of the Muslim traders who passed through the island. The archipelago is a busy place for shipping, so you may also come across someone who speaks English.\n\nComorian :\n\nThe island’s vernacular language, Comorian is the mother tongue of the majority of the population. Nearly 1,000,000 people speak the language, so if you want to travel to the Comoros, this is the language to speak.\n\nMadagascar :\n\nA former French colony, Malagasy and French are spoken in Madagascar. These are the two official languages of Madagascar, and both are taught at primary and secondary level.\n\nAlmost 50% of Madagascans have some knowledge of French.\n\nMalagasy :\n\nMalagasy is the island’s mother tongue and is spoken by 100% of the population. The official language is Imerina, the Malagasy of the capital. There are many dialects of the language."
