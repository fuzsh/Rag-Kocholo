        "text": "“Comoros? Where is Comoros?” That was the response I got from most people when I told them where I was going. Even now, I can not not say that I know a lot about Comoros. However, I can tell you that it is a country worth knowing. Please learn about the history, people and culture. I can share with you a few of my experiences during my brief time there. You already know from my last post that transit to Moroni, Comoros required multiple flights over multiple days. The last 4 hours were the toughest, but it was 100% worth it. Driving from the airport to the hotel, I witnessed what I can best describe as an emerging urban environment mapped onto a tropical paradisical landscape. Glorious palm trees, crystalline blue waters, roads with no stop signs or streetlights, roadside kiosks selling water, produce and other goods. It was the contrast between the two landscapes that kept me in a state of curiosity and wonder. Islam is the majority religion. This gave me an opportunity to really focus on diversity within a particular faith. Some of the visible diversity was represented in people’s clothing. I could hear the call to prayer at different times throughout the day. I went to the beach one day for fun, and saw a man praying on the rocky ocean coast. There are 3 official languages: Shikomori (Comorian), French and Arabic. I also heard Kiswahili. All of these languages were being spoken all the time at once. Whereas, in other cities I hear the official language spoken in most places and occasionally the native language. My brain was confused and started to think in Chinese! I think it all just activated the language center in my mind. What is hardest to explain is the kindness, generous spirit and humor of the Comorians that I met. It all sounds so cliché, but what I experienced was being seen, embraced and treated in a familial kind of way - beyond my status as a visitor, colleague, tourist. I think it was more about the Comorian warm and open heartedness, in general. I am still processing the experience. Those 8 days in Comoros had a deep impact on me. Below are some photos from my trip."
