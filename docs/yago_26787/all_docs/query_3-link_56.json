        "text": "What is the Comorian Franc (KMF)?\n\nThe Comorian Franc (KMF) is the official currency of the island nation, the Union of Comoros, which is located in the Indian Ocean, near Madagascar and Mozambique. Originally pegged to the French franc, the Comorian franc is, as of 2020, pegged to the euro.\n\nThe franc of Comoros is nominally divided into 100 centimes, but no denomination lower than 1 franc has ever been minted. Minted and printed currency ranges from 1 franc to 10,000 francs.\n\nHistory of Comoros\n\nOriginally comprised of a collection of four islands – Grande Comore, Anjouan, Mohéli, and Mayotte – Comoros was a French colony from the mid-19th century until 1975 when all of the islands except Mayotte formed an independent nation, the Union of Comoros. Mayotte chose to remain under the governance of France.\n\nThe vast majority of the country’s population – the majority of which live in extreme poverty – follows the religion of Islam, which is the official religion of the country. Comoros has three official languages – French, Arabic, and Comorian. The country’s two main industries are agriculture and fishing. It has one notable export, a popular perfume essence called ylang-ylang.\n\nAs of 2020, the population of the Union of Comoros is estimated at just under one million people.\n\nThe Comorian Franc\n\nThe Banque Centrale des Comores is the central bank of the country. It is guided by an eight-member Board of Directors that consists of officials of the government of the Union of Comoros and representatives of the central bank of France and the French government. The Comorian central bank imposes a compulsory reserve on the country’s banks equal to 30% of total deposits.\n\nFrom the time of its independence in 1975 up until 1994, the Comorian franc was pegged to the French franc at a rate of 50:1 (50 Comorian francs = 1 French franc). A devaluation of the Comorian franc eventually led to a re-peg at the rate of 100:1.\n\nUpon the creation of the euro in 1999, the Comorian franc ceased being pegged to the French franc, moving instead to a peg to the euro. As of late 2020, the KMF/EUR exchange rate is 491.48 Comorian francs to 1 euro. The KMF/USD exchange rate is approximately 403.80 Comorian francs to 1 US dollar.\n\nThe currency of the Union of Comoros is denominated in coins and banknotes, as follows.\n\nCoins issued by the central bank are in denominations of 1 franc, 2 francs, 5 francs, 10 francs, 25 francs, 50 francs, and 100 francs. The denominations below 25 francs are rarely used. The coins are actually minted in France by the Monnaie de Paris, the oldest existing coin minting institution in the world.\n\nThe central bank issues bank notes in denominations of 500 francs, 1000 francs, 2000 francs, 5000 francs, and 10,000 francs.\n\nLearn More\n\nCFI is the official provider of the global Commercial Banking & Credit Analyst (CBCA)™ certification program, designed to help anyone become a world-class financial analyst.
