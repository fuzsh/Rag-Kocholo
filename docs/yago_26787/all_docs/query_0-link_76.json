        "text": "Prayer Profile\n\nThe Ngazija Comorian of the Comoros The Comorians (also known as the Mauri or the Mahorais) live on a group of islands in the Indian Ocean between Madagascar and Mozambique, Africa. The Comoros chain consists of four main islands plus several smaller ones. These islands, with a population that is approaching 28,000, are officially known as the \"Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros.\"\n\nUntil 1975, all the islands belonged to France. At that time, the three largest islands declared their independence; but Mayotte, the fourth island, chose to remain a French possession.\n\nThe Comorians are a blend of settlers from the past: Iranian traders, mainland Africans, Arabs, and Malagasy. Comorian communities can be found on all of the islands in the Comoros chain as well as in Madagascar. Due to the poor economic conditions, the islands receive monetary and technical support from other countries.\n\nWhat are their lives like?\n\nMost of the islanders work as farmers or fishermen, while a few breed cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys. A small number work in industry or in jobs relating to tourism.\n\nThe Comoros Island is very poor and undeveloped. The basic diet of the Comorians consists of rice, potatoes, corn, fish, coconuts, and bananas. Other crops that are grown are sweet potatoes, citrus fruits, and pineapples.\n\nAlthough young people wear Western style clothing, traditional clothing is still common among the adults. While in town, a Comorian man will typically wear a white cotton garment and a knee-length shirt, sometimes with a white jacket and white skull cap. Out of town, a long cloth sarong (colorful skirt) is worn. Most women wear long, colorful cotton dresses with bright shawls as face coverings. Others prefer wearing black robes that cover their heads.\n\nPolygamy is an acceptable practice among the Comorians. Children are expected to help with family duties such as farming, fishing, and caring for the animals. For recreation they enjoy dancing, singing, and playing instruments, especially horns and drums.\n\nAbout 27% of the Comorians live in cities; but whether in rural or urban areas, housing on the island is generally poor. Although French and Arabic are the official languages of the island Comoros, Swahili is the native language spoken by the Comorians.\n\nWhat are their beliefs?\n\nThe Comorians are 99.9% Shafiite Muslims. Surprisingly, however, mosque attendance is very low. Mixed with their Islamic practices, there is a strong involvement in occultism and spirit possession.\n\nTraditionally, the Comorians have been very resistant to any kind of religious change; however, they are gradually becoming more indifferent.\n\nWhat are their needs?\n\nThe physical needs of the Comorians are numerous. Major problems on Comoros Islands include poverty, disease, and hunger. Educational levels are low and only 46% of the population is literate. The economy is struggling and unemployment levels are very high. There is a shortage of hospitals and doctors, and many suffer from illnesses and chronic malnutrition. Hygiene is poor due to the fact that the Comorians have a poor water supply. Such problems contribute to a high death rate, especially among young children.\n\nThe spiritual needs of the Comorians are even greater. Though there is freedom of religion on the islands, evangelism is not well received by these Shafiite Muslims. Their commitment to Islam, coupled with involvement in occult practices, has made the Comorians difficult to reach.\n\nThere are presently two mission agencies working among the Comorians. Unfortunately, their resources are limited. Only portions of the Bible have yet been translated into Swahili. Traditional Islamic mentality has made the people difficult to reach. Consequently, there are only 55 known Comorian believers.\n\nPrayer Points\n\nAsk the Lord to call people who are willing to go to the Comoros Islands and share the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nPray for the quick production of the Jesus film in Swahili, with an abundant response when it is shown.\n\nAsk God to strengthen, encourage, and protect the fifty-five known Comorian believers.\n\nPray that God will raise up qualified linguists to complete translation of the Bible into Swahili.\n\nAsk the Holy Spirit to soften the hearts of these Muslims towards the Gospel.\n\nPray for God to send Christian teachers and medical teams to work among the Comorians.\n\nPray that at least one strong local church will be planted on each of the Comoros Islands by the year 2000.\n\nSee also the following related groups:\n\nthe Comorian of Mayotte; the Mwali Comorian of Comoros; the Nzwani Comorian of Comoros; and the Ngazija Comorian of Madagascar.\n\nStatistics\n\nLatest estimates from the World Evangelization Research Center.\n\nTHE PEOPLE\n\nPeople name: Comorian\n\nCountry: Comoros\n\nTheir language: Ngazija\n\nPopulation:\n\nLargest religion:\n\nChristians: <1%\n\nChurch members: 55\n\nScriptures in their own language: Portions\n\nJesus Film in their own language: None\n\nChristian broadcasts in their own language: Available\n\nMission agencies working among this people: 2\n\nPersons who have heard the Gospel: 85,500 (31%)\n\nPersons who have never heard the Gospel: 190,200 (69%)\n\nTHEIR COUNTRY\n\nCountry: Comoros\n\nPopulation:\n\nMajor peoples in size order:\n\nMajor religions:\n\nNumber of denominations: 6"
