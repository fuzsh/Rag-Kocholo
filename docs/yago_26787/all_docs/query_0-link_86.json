        "text": "Results\n\nThe Archipelago of Comoros\n\nThe Comoros archipelago is located in the western Indian Ocean, midway between the island of Madagascar and the coast of East Africa at the northern end of the Mozambique Channel. The archipelago is composed of four main islands ( ). These islands represented a potential maritime crossroads between Bantu East Africa, Middle East, the Red See, the Arabic Peninsula and south-east Asian countries. In the past, the Indian Ocean was viewed as a closed, round sea, meaning there was much more sea traffic on this ocean compared to the Atlantic, for example. The name “Comoros” seems to derive from the Arabic “Kmr”, meaning “light in the sky” (Allibert, 2001), probably in reference to “the Cloud of Magellan” star constellation, whose position in the southern sky was used by seafarers as a means of finding the archipelago. The Comorian ethnic group is a synthesis of Bantu, Arab, Malay, and Malagasy cultures, and the main religion is Sunni Islam.\n\nFrom the 7th century, the Comoros were populated by Bantu Africans and the islands were used as a stepping stone for Middle Eastern traders and boats along the East African coast and for Austronesian traders travelling to Madagascar as well. The contacts between the Bantu population living on the coasts of East Africa and the Arabic traders coming from the Arabic Peninsula around the 10th century lead to the emergence of the Swahili culture and language (Nurse and Philippson, 2003). The structure of the Swahili language was derived from the Bantu language but comported 40% of Arab words. Indeed, the Arab word “Swahil” means coast. The success of the Swahili civilization during the 9th-12th centuries was linked to its commerce with the countries around the Indian Ocean. In the 12th century, the Shirazi, from the city of Shiraz, which is now located in Iran, arrived on the Comoros, traveling and trading along the East African coast as far as India and the Maldives. Islamization of the Swahili coast and Comoros occurred, and the first mosque was built in Anjouan 800 years before present. Today, the oldest mosques found in the Comoros are all located in Anjouan (Sima and Domoni, 11th-12th) (Wright, 1984). Later the European colonization by the French, English and Portuguese traders and armies took over the administration of these countries. In 1886, the Comoros were established as a French Protectorate.\n\nFollowing a vote for independence in 1975, today, three islands (Njazidja: La Grande Comore; Mwali: Mohéli, and Ndzwani: Anjouan) compose the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros, and the fourth one (Mayotte) remains French since 1843 ( ). The Republic of the Comoros is a poor country, and has been rated as 160th among 188 countries for the Human Development Index (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros).\n\nXeroderma pigmentosum patients in Comoros\n\nIn the Comoros, about 32 black-skinned XP patients have been diagnosed in the last 15 years. Due to the high level of melanin, black XP patients are relatively more resistant to sun exposure than white-skinned patients. Sun exposure induced hypo- and hyper-pigmentation on black skin that progressed with age (compare and ). The first skin tumors they developed are in the eyes or on the tip of the tongue ( ). Later, they will develop skin tumors on exposed body sites ( ). In agreement with a normal development and normal neurology, the Comorian patients are all mutated on the XPC gene, exhibiting the same homozygous mutation (IVS 12-1 G>C) leading to an abnormal splicing site between intron 12 and exon 13 ( , ). Three abnormal mRNAs are produced, but none of them allowed the synthesis of a full-size XPC repair protein, as shown by western blot analysis ( ). These patients are, therefore, deficient in genome global excision repair, causing hypersensitivity to sunlight, showing numerous skin cancers, and ophthalmological anomalies, including early blindness. Because sun exposure is very high in Comoros, caused by the proximity with the equator and because of the absence of prevention and developed health care, these patients usually died in very dramatic conditions before the age of 15 (Cartault et al., 2011).\n\nWe were able to follow 18 of these patients in terms of both clinical and genetic analysis. Today, more than half of these patients live in Mayotte with free medical care provided by the French hospitals, but, in fact, all of them are originated only from the island of Anjouan. The familial structure in Comoros is “matrilocal”, meaning that after marriage the family lives in the village of the woman’s family. This situation is very well known to produce consanguinity and, therefore, the appearance of homozygous individuals. Moreover, the father or uncle is involved in the choice of the bride’s husband. This familial structure ensures a stable location of families over time because women are less subject to location change than men. Several generations, therefore, live at the same location due to this family structure. Indeed, most of the XP families are still now living in the middle of the volcanic Anjouan island in mountain villages with still very difficult access, far away from other cities and the seacoasts, meaning no genetic exchange with other individuals in the same island or from the other three islands. Interestingly, in some of these small villages we could find several XP patients, as much as four or six individuals in a small community, indicating that the number of heterozygotes should be elevated in the villages and the consanguinity factor rather high. In the three most developed cities on the coast, including the main town Moutsamoudou, only one XP family is found for each of these harbors, suggesting that the heterozygote individuals and consanguinity are essentially regrouped in closed villages, immune to genetic admixture ( ).\n\nThe genetics of the population of Comoros\n\nThe admixture analysis of the maternal and paternal contributions to the general Comoros population reveals the genetic pool to be essentially sub-Saharan African, distributed between 60% for males and 85% for females (Msaidie et al., 2011). By computing genetic distances using haplogroups on the Y chromosome between the Comorian population and other source population, Ducourneau (2006) showed that the closest proximity is with sub-Saharan Africa and the Bantu expansion. This analysis also provides evidence for human Bantu migration from West-Central Africa down to the eastern/southern African coasts of the Indian Ocean (De Filippo et al., 2012). With respect to male origins, the Arabic peninsula and Iran show a similar proximity (Msaidie et al., 2011). The population dispersion was essentially done by sea routes, as shown by the lack of a Somalian population in Comoros. No detectable individual was coming from the Middle East with respect to the female contribution to Comorian peopling, in contrast to the Y chromosome contribution. This asymmetry suggests that an only men migration from the Middle East occurred, while women originated from East Africa stayed on the islands. This male expansion was linked to sea-borne commerce along the East African coast, as well as to the Islamic expansion. Some of these Arabic men married Comorian women of African and Swahili origins.\n\nThe distribution ( ) of the Y haplogroups in XP-C patients from Comoros, that we have established, [E1b1 (62%), J2a1 (15%), R1a1a (15%), E2b (8%)] is statistically different from the one published for the general population (p<0.01) (Msaidie et al., 2011). Some relatively important haplogroups reported in the general Comorian population (E1b1a7 and E1b1a8a, 22% and 9% respectively) were completely absent from the XP-C population (Msaidie et al., 2011). Although this difference was not statistically significant, probably due to the small number of XP-C patients, it is tempting to suggest that the fathers of the XP-C patients correspond to a small and restricted part of the African population originated from a limited number of heterozygote individuals peopling the Comoros in the past, at least based on the Y chromosome haplogroups. Indeed, African XP-C patients with the same mutation as the one found in Comorian patients, have been recently found in Kenya (data not shown), Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and north of South Africa (Coulombe et al., 2016; Kgokolo et al., 2019).\n\nTable 1\n\nComorian XP-C patientsY-chromosomemtDNADNA codeHaplogroupsOriginsHaplogroupsOrigins3003E1b1a1a1f1West-Central AfricaL1cWest-Central Africa3538E1b1a1a1f1West-Central AfricaL0a2South-East Africa7961E1b1a1a1fWest-Central AfricaL1c2a1West-Central Africa9199E1b1a1a1fWest-Central AfricaL1c2a1West-Central Africa7053E1b1a1a1f1aWest-Central AfricaL3e3West Africa2068E1b1b1bNord-West AfricaL3d1a1aWest-Central Africa2067J2a1b1East AfricaL3e3West Africa3124J2a1b1East AfricaL3e3West Africa1949E2bSouth-West-East AfricaL2a1South Africa7888R1a1a1b1a2b1EurasiaL3f1b4aEast Africa Sahel Z.9826R1a1a1b1a2b1EurasiaL0a2South-East Africa2629E1b1a1a1fWest-Central AfricaL3bWest AfricaAS970E1b1a1a1fWest-Central AfricaL0d1bAustral Africa\n\nA similar analysis has been done by the Msaidie’s group on 577 mtDNA samples from Comorian islanders: 85% of the haplogroups (L0, L1, L2, L3) confirm that the ancestral population originated from south-eastern and eastern Africa corresponding to the Bantu expansion (De Filippo et al., 2012), and 15% of Comorian mitochondrial origins are from southeastern Asia. This finding, based on a large Comorian population, is relatively close to the distribution that we found for the mtDNA of Comorian XP-C patients, except for the absence of a southeast Asian population in our patients ( ). Our XP-C maternal lineage corresponds to 100% (13/13 samples) of African origins (haplogroups L0, L1, L2 and L3) while the general Comorian population is around 85% of African origin (489/577 samples). This difference is not statistically significant probably due to the small number of XP-C patients. The mitochondrial haplogroups are more homogeneous in Comoros compared to the Y chromosome ones. This is in full agreement with the male-biased flow from Africa and Middle East to the Comoros, caused by male-dominated trade and religious propagation (Msaidie et al., 2011).\n\nAlthough the sample size of the XP-C patients is small, the XP families appear as a sample different from that of the total of Comorian inhabitants, particularly for the male lineage of XP parents. This result agrees well with the unique African/Bantu origin of the XPC mutation (for both lineages), which remained as such during centuries due to the absence of genetic exchanges with other populations, particularly Arabic and Asian ones.\n\nWhy are all Comorian XP patients originated from only a single island: Anjouan?\n\nWhen we tried to determine the geographical origins of the Comorian XP-C families, we discovered that all families were initially originated from a single island, Anjouan, and that no XP-C families were originated from any of the three other islands. Anjouan is a small volcanic island of 424 km2 with less than 300,000 inhabitants, and with no obvious difference from the other Comorian islands ( ).\n\nLike the other Comorian islands, Anjouan has been peopled by the east African Bantu between the 7th and 10th centuries. Since we know that the XPC founder mutation is present in East Africa, one can hypothesize that some individuals, men and/or women, who migrated from the mainland to the Comoros should have been asymptomatic XP heterozygotes.\n\nBetween the 11 and 13th centuries, Arabs coming from the Arabic Peninsula and Shiraz (now Iran) followed the East African coast by boat for trade and eventually taking the black population as slaves. To avoid the slavery trade, it is possible that some of Anjouan inhabitants, including XP heterozygotes, may have fled to the central part of the island to hide in small valleys between the volcanic mountains. Due to the “matrilocal” familial structure and to the geography of the island, this people and their descendants stayed for centuries in the middle of the island, with almost no interaction with individuals living on the coast, coming from other islands or other countries (Blanchy, 2013). Although XP-C patients will not live very long due to their sun sensitivity in an equatorial country, their heterozygous parents had a normal lifespan because they were not sensitive to sun exposure and to cancer development. This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that even today the families of XP patients live essentially inside the island in villages still difficult to access, and not along the coast where admixture and exchange with Arabic men would have been observed (see ). The populations living outside of cities and descending from Africans (the “Busmen” or Wamatsaha) were poor farmers and did not mix with the educated and sea traders from major towns of a Shiraz origin and an Islamic education (the Makabaila) (Blanchy, 2015). Even recently, peasants from African origin were obliged to move away from cities and coasts to places more and more difficult of access and farming, due to political reasons imposed by the rich traders of the three major harbors ( ). This absence of mixing between different ethnic origins in the same island is a good picture of how the situation was centuries ago for the African individuals.\n\nThis hypothesis is in agreement with the age of the XPC mutations in Anjouan patients that we calculated to be around 800 years from now (Cartault et al., 2011), which corresponds roughly to the arrival of the Arabs in Comoros. These 800 years correspond to the time the XP families and their descendants stayed together as a close bubble and without genetic exchange with other genetically different populations.\n\nWhy such a story did not occur in the other Comorian islands is difficult to say?\n\nMay be the frequency of XP heterozygote Africans who crossed the sea from East Africa to Comoros, was low enough that statistically no or a too small number of such individuals arrived in the other islands? Indeed, we found only four different haplogroups in the Y chromosome and four different haplogroups in the mtDNA for the origins of the Comorian XP-C parents ( ), indicating that the number of ancestral XP heterozygotes was probably small during the Comoros peopling.\n\nMay be in the other islands, the Bantu Africans did not flee at the arrival of the Arabs, or did interact much more with commercial traders so that a high level of consanguinity did not occur as much as in Anjouan? It is interesting to note that the general population of Anjouan in the Middle Ages was known to be restricted to itself and to its own political situation (Blanchy, 2013). The international commercial trades were very active in Anjouan, but were conducted by a small minority of educated elite, living on the sea coasts, where the African farmers were excluded. The absence of mixing between poor farmers and educated individuals found in the classical Swahili society in Anjouan did not occur so much in the other Comorian islands, probably because of less competitive commercial activities (Blanchy, 2015).\n\nFinally, the geography of the four islands is quite different, although all are volcanic islands. In Anjouan, there are several volcanoes with very isolated valleys of difficult access , where the XP families are still living now, in isolated small villages. In the three other islands, it appears to have been more difficult to hide and flee possible invaders. For example, in the biggest island (La Grande Comore), there is only one big volcanic mountain, and the rest of the island is flat. So, it is almost impossible to hide with families and children.\n\nWe can, therefore, hypothesize that the specific prevalence of XP-C patients in Anjouan could be due to a mixture of local historical and geographical circumstances leading to a specific evolution and life-style of the initial African peopling, including XP heterozygote individuals."
