        "text": "Comorian (shiKomori / شِكُمُرِ)\n\nComorian is a Bantu language spoken on the Comoros Islands and Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. There are also some speakers in Madagascar and Réunion. In 2004 there were about 700,000 speakers. Comorian is related to Swahili and is sometimes known as Comores Swahili.\n\nThere are a number of dialects of Comorian, including Ngazidja, or Shingazidja, which is spoken on Grande Comore; Maore, or Shimaore, which is spoken mainly on Mayotte; Ndzwani, or Shindzwani, which is spoken on Anjouan, and Mwali, or Shimwali, which is spoken on Moheli.\n\nHistorically Comorian was written with a version of the Arabic script, which is still used. The Latin alphabet was adopted to write the language after Comoros was colonised by France in the 19th century. The Latin alphabet introduced in colonial times was modified, and the modified version is still used, however these days more people use the Arabic script and the Latin alphabet.\n\nArabic script for Comorian\n\nNote\n\nح, ع and ق are only used in words borrowed from Arabic\n\nLatin alphabet for Comorian\n\nDownload an alphabet chart for Comorian (Excel)\n\nSample text (Ngazidja dialect)\n\nHa mwakinisho ukaya ho ukubali ye sheo shaho wo ubinadamu piya pvamwedja ne ze haki za wadjibu zaho usawa, zahao, uwo ndo mshindzi waho uhuria, no mlidzanyiso haki, ne amani yahe duniya kamili.\n\nSource: http://unicode.org/udhr/d/udhr_zdj.html\n\nTranslation\n\nAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
