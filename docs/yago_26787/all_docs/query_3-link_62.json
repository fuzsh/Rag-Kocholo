        "text": "I (ASC) think it is only fitting to reprint JF’s acknowledgements as they appeared at the end of his linked articles in The Linnean (J. Franks, 2005):\n\n“Having worked on the Braad papers for ten years, it’s a pleasure and a privilege to have this as a first opportunity to acknowledge my debts of gratitude. For financial support that’s let me work at home and in distant archives I am indebted to, respectively the Torsten and Ragnar Söderberg Foundations and the Helge Ax:son Johnson Trust, all of Stockholm. Those in Australia, Britain, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Holland, India, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, the United States and the Vatican who’ve helped me in many ways will excuse me, I hope, for putting off a final settlement until there’s space to thank each by name. This won’t do, however, for three in Sweden: Tomas Anfält in Uppsala; Philip K. Nelson in Norrköping; and Bo Ralph in Göteborg, to whom I’d like to offer my warmest thanks for support and guidance in especially the initial years of my work. Finally my gratitude to my wife for her affectionate forbearance in putting up Braad as our lodger is more than all the rest: I’m happy to acknowledge it but to thank her adequately for it is quite another matter.”\n\nI myself have to thank first Jeremy’s interest in elucidating points of natural and human history, with which I was able to help him, and his eventual unfulfilled wish for me to help edit the Braad oeuvre, of which this article is but a very small part. I thank Martin Walsh for helpful input, especially on shinzwani words, and for first finding JF’s date of death, then speculatively contacting Peter Franks in South Africa on the off-chance he was a relative—he is, and he led me to Rebecca Ekenberg, JF’s daughter, holder of the archive, who clarified a puzzling passage. Also I thank Thomas Vernet-Habasque as editor for detailed and constructive comments on the document as a whole, and two referees for their useful contributions. One was anonymous; the other, Sophie Blanchy, was unusually forensic and provided several useful references; the paper is better as a consequence. The article is dedicated to the memory of the late Jeremy Franks.\n\nIntroduction [by ASC]\n\nIn reading through this account of travel that is a copy of the original that I delivered in 1752 to the directors of the East India Company, I have noticed not only many clerical errors but also in many places usages especially in style that discover a young man’s work. As I later had opportunities during a stay of several years in the places described to examine matters more closely and obtain information about matters that escaped my notice on my first visit, I hope in future, should the Almighty grant me health, to be able to communicate a more reliable account of my travels in Asia. In the meantime may I remark that the errors in this book do not materially run counter to truth; but every traveller ought to be able to attest to the general truth that one ought later to see a matter otherwise than on the first hurried occasion.\n\n3While there is nothing of great moment in Braad’s account of Anjouan, surprisingly full for a two-day visit, it adds a useful account of the island, its people and its productions from a period from around 1720 to the 1780s, when despite many visits by English and French ships, few accounts were written, presumably because the island was by then considered well known. Other than the standard domestic livestock and crops described by Braad himself, I have where possible (in footnotes) identified animals, plants and people mentioned or described but unnamed in the text. Braad’s is the only known account of any of the Comoro islands by a Swede and thus looks at the island, despite the short visit, in a slightly different light from English and French commentators, though with the usual bias of European superiority. One can usefully compare his text with Grose’s (1766) account from a six-day visit a fortnight earlier. Braad’s reading of past information is sometimes somewhat awry, possibly because some information came orally from the Anjouanais and his reading of the semi-fictional book by Defoe (1724); this is picked up in the footnotes.\n\n4The emphasis here is on the translation of a previously unseen historical account, and, apart from some elucidation in the footnotes, I have made no attempt to enlarge on the larger political and economic circumstances of the time. Apart from Franks’s investigations there is little literature on Braad, excepting Melkersson’s thesis (R. Melkersson, 2013), using the account of Braad’s 1748–49 Hoppet journey, but which however focuses on Braad’s style and graphology rather than the historical content. Melkersson acknowledged that Franks “is the one who has paid the most attention to Braad in recent years and is perhaps the one who has most eagerly asserted the intrinsic value of Braad’s texts” (my translation with Google’s help). Allibert (C. Allibert, 1984, citing J.C. Hébert’s personal data) was aware of the Swedish visit to Anjouan in 1750, mentioning Olof Torée [sic, for Torén, see below], in a list of visits to the Comoros, which he admitted was far from complete.\n\nChristopher Henric Braad, a brief biography\n\n5[condensed from scattered information in J. Franks, 1999, 2005, 2006]\n\n6Born in Stockholm in 1728, Braad lived in his mother Gertrude’s home town of Torneå, northern Sweden, where his father Poul was an official, moving to Norrköping with his family at age six. After private tutoring and learning several languages, he went to Uppsala University aged 14, but left dissatisfied. Briefly working as a clerk, he joined the SOIC, sailing for the first time in January 1748 as ship’s clerk on the Hoppet [Hope], on a voyage to Canton. He made further journeys in 1750–52 (on the Götha Leijon), then again in 1753, when, having reached Canton, he was directed to travel independently to gather natural history material in Southeast Asia and India, much of which time he spent in Bengal, considered a spy by the British but cleverly diverting their attention. He lost almost all his papers from 1754–58, some earlier ones, and “two chests with many rare natural-history specimens of all the realms of nature [in] Asia” in a shipwreck on his return voyage to Europe in 1758. He got back to Sweden in summer 1759, writing his account of Malaya and Bengal that autumn. He met Carl Linné (Linnaeus) to discuss his findings in 1760. On his first two journeys the ship’s pastor was Olof Torén, a pupil and correspondent of Linné, and there is evidence in Torén’s correspondence with Linné of discussions with Braad, although he is not mentioned. Torén died in 1753, a depressive and alcoholic according to Braad’s unpublished autobiography. Promoted to supercargo, Braad sailed again for Surat in 1760, but by then the British were foiling all other traders; the mission was not a commercial success there, but did better in China. Back home in 1763, he was offered, but declined, a directorship in the SOIC, preferring to retire at age 35 with the money he had made in permitted private trading. He settled back in Norrköping, marrying and being widowed twice, then marrying a third wife in 1772. He had three daughters by his first wife, and a son by his third. He built up an impressive library of 3,000 books. Apparently still in good health, he began a more detailed account of his life but died in October 1781, just four months after starting it.\n\nBeskrifning på skeppet Götha Leijons resa till Surat oen åtsillige andre Indianske Orter opsat och i ödmjukhet öfwerlemnad till Högloflige Swenska Ostindiske Compagniet\n\nVth Chapter: Onward voyage to Johanna, and about Madagascar\n\n935 [...] On August 8 [1750] we sighted the islands of Mohilla [Moheli/Mwali] and Johanna [Anjouan/Nzwani], and the following day that of Mayotta [Mayotte/Maore], although we could not make much way towards them. Ever since we had sighted Madagascar, the wind had been light and now it became even lighter and became finally a calm, so that we could only drift on the current between these islands that lay now to the north east, then between SW by S and N. On the evening of 11 August we were close to the eastern side of Johanna, and because we could only assume that we could come in on the following day, we sent the ship’s boat ashore to see whether any other ships were there before us, and to report our arrival; but by fortune a west-going current that night was so strong that the slight wind could not stop us from losing sight of land in the morning; we could not anchor, for the bottom would not hold, so that some days were spent working to windward that was lost at night\n\n11These difficulties in reaching the island derived largely from the poor wind, but the strong adverse current and the lack of any anchorage except close to land were part of them. I have no reason to believe that our course off the east of the island could make so great a difference, although the author of the English India Pilot Book does not advise it, but his reasons are not consistent and some seem false, for the strong northerly winds that he mentions were not apparent along the coast, 36 where calms mostly prevailed, while the SW monsoon was blowing strongly a bit further out to sea, and the land winds were not as steadily from the SE as he claims but blew from all quarters.\n\nVIth Chapter: Description of the island of Johanna\n\n12Johanna, one of the largest of the Comoro islands, is situated between the mainland of Africa by Mozambique and the northern point of Madagascar, at the exit of the Mozambique channel that, on account of the eastern extension of this island, is at its widest point. Its [=Johanna’s] longitude is 44°10´E from London and its northern end’s latitude from accurate observation is 12°10´S; its coastline is fourteen to fifteen Swedish miles [140–150 km] long, in the form of a triangle with corners to the south, to the north east and the north west. Between the latter two a deep bay [Fig. 1] is most serviceable for visiting ships that can anchor close to land, off an inconsiderable spot or settlement, over a small sandbank in 40–50 fathoms; the sea constantly breaks over a depth of 20 fathoms, and on the shore, so that one who lands has trouble to keep dry; the ebb and flood run very strongly here, respectively south and north, with a rise and fall of three fathoms. Otherwise the whole island comprises heights surrounded by precipitous falls of land that give the uneven and rising hills that are covered with greenery an agreeable appearance; occasional sandy dells detract slightly from its charm.\n\n15Samoder lies near the beach by the bank where our ship anchored, a bit to the east of the middle of the bay, below a great height and between two groves of coconut palms, with the one to the west on the farther side of a small stream. It is a random collection of seventy to eighty stone buildings that seem to have narrow alleys between them. All are old and dilapidated with small apertures for windows. The land around each is fenced in by interwoven palm leaves that are also used everywhere as roofs, except on the largest mosque that differs from the others on account of its round tower in stone, but its interior comprises no more than bare walls.\n\n16Otherwise one sees nothing in houses beyond a bed, a chair and table, some bottles and broken china hung like a frieze around the wall. A curtain separates the harem or women’s quarter from the living room and, to tell the truth, they need not fear any virtuous European would be tempted by the beauty of their womenfolk; others need not be mentioned for locks and portcullises are too weak to resist such lusts. Some people say that because the houses are so old, badly kept up and roofless they were built by the Portuguese. But, besides not resembling any European building, they evoke no wonder that the Muslims do not do up their dilapidated and time-worn buildings because the inevitability of fate so impresses them that they apply it to the most minor matters.\n\n19This subject reminds me that I cannot overlook what others say of many thoughtless travellers who publish narratives that so embellish minor but absolute Indian rulers and call them ‘prince’ and ‘king’ and other such titles, and speak without reserve of their residences, courtiers, states and I do not know what else, so that their readers are all too often gulled into believing their abused and ill-chosen words signify what they signify in Europe. Nothing in fact could be more different. One does better to say that such peasants are more suited to be servants to some Don Quixote. Whoever mistakes miserable hovels for royal palaces or slavish blacks for courtiers, must have eyes unlike those of others or use them to perceive what only some mounted but itinerant knight can perceive.\n\n21I admit that I had hardly seen a fairer land than Johanna. Although high and hilly everywhere, it is nowhere bare and rocky, but in a few places open expanses are sandy, and is covered up to its hill tops with thick jungle. 39 The wide valleys between the hills are as richly covered with every sort of fruit tree, with crowns impervious to the fiery sun and casting a shade that is as cool as it is pleasant. Countless small streams of the clearest water bubble between the trees and, together with many small birds’ calls, harmoniously appeal to the most discriminating of senses. In a word, these pleasures are so great that one can scarcely believe that a more appealing place exists outside some romances.\n\n22As to its fertility, it is no less, especially on the island’s northern side. For the most part its soil is black without any larger stones in it, and I saw in many places where they have dug or where the ground has fallen away that the soil depth is two alnar [about 110 cm] so that this, and the many streams that run down from the hills, and the many springs that can be found everywhere, can only cause an incomparable fertility.\n\nFrom Braad’s MS ‘Beskrifning på skeppet Götha Leijons resa till Surat’, 1752.\n\nVIIth Chapter: On the inhabitants [of Johanna] and [remarks] on the other Comoro islands\n\n32One finds them neither given to thievery or quarrels but it is well known that they show themselves to ready to avoid trouble, being happy to let days go by, but this may be put down more to the conditions of their lives, which do not require them to work very much, than to their natural inclination, for nothing so induces hands and minds to go to work as a lack of things. But they are not covetous and their resources are slight, so they can all the more easily renew them. Fortunate people! Their morals have not yet been spoiled by much intercourse with foreigners or the oppression of some conqueror, through example to imitate those sins that are perpetrated under such circumstances. But no such virtues are exhibited by their way of life that one can adduce as exemplary or comparable to some of the ancient and celebrated philosophers’ strictly honourable customs, so can they even so be prized as blessed in an ignorance that averts many gross moral errors, and the less they take trouble to curb their desires, the more their innocent way of life is to be envied.\n\n34One finds among them neither indigents nor beggars who might expose their country to rebuke: each and every man has what he needs, in the form of an allotment of a bit of land that can be used for cattle, for planting or for sowing rice. The fertile soil that almost of itself gives rise to every sort of the most delightful fruit and plant makes easy their labours for the seven or eight summery months between rain periods while, when the rains do come, they have nothing more to do than to go into the jungles and knock down coconuts, so the whole of their lives pass in agreeable peace and quiet.\n\n36They say that they themselves have come from Arabia but it seems most likely that they have come from Mozambique or the nearest part of Africa, for they are distinguished from the Malagasy by their hair, which falls in small clumps instead of keeping it long.\n\n38Women, who are less constricted here than among other Muslims, are permitted to visit the mosques, the largest being to that end divided in two, so that each sex had their own room.\n\n40Here was elegantly demonstrated how easily one who does not check can err by assuming a number of things from seeing them [only] at first glance. Most of our crew, when they saw how the people of Johanna ate during Ramadan took it that they always did so and one, who was a little sharper than his fellows, wrote in his diary of the incomparably restrained people of Johanna who did not eat during the day. When I had returned home I heard many speak of this amazing people, including some devoted souls who praised them, for their eternal fasting was exemplary for Christians. Nothing was in fact more absurd. So soon can one ignorantly deceive oneself and others. I do not doubt at all 47 that if one began closely to inspect and copy the pile of the last two centuries’ published accounts of true travel stories that are as well based as this one, both these discursive books and a great many Indian curiosities would become really quite slim.\n\n46Otherwise it was remarked that all provisions for the ship had to be ordered on land from the sheriff, who made his money once he knew what was ordered. Besides him, masses of people came on board from narrow dug-out canoes with double outriggers, like those of Java, loaded with greenstuffs, hens, goats, eggs, milk and so on that they offered for sale in an open market on board from morning to night, without in any way abusing the freedom that we gave them, to go wherever they liked on board, by stealing things.\n\n52The English ship Schaftsbury [=Shaftesbury] that lay ahead of us at Johanna had in passing between Madagascar and the African coast unexpectedly encountered an island that its officers took to be the well-known and much-feared Bassas de India; and while the few [published] remarks about this are as valid as new ones, and I cannot do better than to be able to offer my readers some of the latter; it seems to me that there is no better place to include them than at the conclusion of the present account of the island of Johanna.\n\nVIIIth Chapter: Journey from Johanna to Surat roadstead\n\n55The ship Shaftesbury left Johanna on the 19th of August, and the next day we followed, as expected, provisioned and watered. [...]\n\n56[They crossed the Line on 28 August and anchored at Surat on 16 September. The Swedish company were operating freelance, without factories or trading posts in any of the ports (Sinha 2012)]"
