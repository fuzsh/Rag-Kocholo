        "text": "Where is Comoros?\n\nLocated in Southern Africa, Comoros is an island nation. It has a 340.00 km coastline. Comoros claims that French-administered Mayotte belongs to them, and challenges both France's and Madagascar's claims to Banc du Geyser.\n\nThe capital of the Union of Comoros is Moroni which is located on the west coast of the island of Grande Comore, the largest island in the country. The area was settled by Arab travellers as early as the 10th Century and was a part of a trade route with Zanzibar. The name Moroni means \"in the heart of the fire\", in the local Comorian language. The climate of the city is considered a tropical rainforest environment with heavy rainfall (2,700mm/100 inches) throughout the year. Average temperatures throughout the year are relatively constant with highs between 32–34 degrees Celsius (90–93 degrees Fahrenheit) and lows ranging between 14–20 degrees Celsius (57–68 degrees Fahrenheit). The area is also subject to cyclones on a regular basis. The population of Moroni is estimated at 55,000 inhabitants making it the largest city in the country in terms of population. Sunni Muslims account for approximately 98% of the citizens of Moroni but there are also Roman Catholic and Christian minorities. The majority of people in Moroni speak Comorian but will have knowledge of Arabic, French, and/or English. Attractions in the city include the historic town centre which was built in 1427 and is based on the stone town of Zanzibar. There are also many interesting cultural sites such as the mosques and the History and Literary Museum.\n\nRead more on Comoros's Capital\n\nComoros is an African country covering 2,235.00 km2.
