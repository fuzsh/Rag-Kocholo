        "text": "How widely spoken is English in Comoros?\n\nEnglish is not widely spoken in Comoros. The official languages of the country are Comorian, French, and Arabic. English is not recognized as an official language, and as a result, its usage is limited to a small number of individuals, typically those who have received education or have had exposure to English-speaking environments.\n\nWhat language do they speak in Comoros?\n\nThe people of Comoros primarily speak Comorian, also known as Shikomor. Comorian is a Bantu language and is spoken by the majority of the population. It is a collection of dialects, with the most widely spoken ones being Shingazidja, Shimwali, and Shindzwani. French and Arabic are also commonly spoken in various contexts.\n\nHow do you say \"I only speak English\" in Comoros?\n\nTo say \"I only speak English\" in Comoros, you would need to use French or Arabic, as English is not commonly understood. In French, you would say \"Je parle seulement anglais,\" and in Arabic, you would say \"أتحدث الإنجليزية فقط\" (pronounced \"Atuhadithu al-ingliziya faqat\").\n\nWhat’s it like to deal with the people of Comoros?\n\nThe people of Comoros are known for their warm and welcoming nature. They are generally friendly and hospitable towards visitors. However, due to the limited usage of English in the country, communication may pose a challenge if you do not speak Comorian, French, or Arabic. It is always beneficial to learn a few basic phrases in the local language to facilitate interactions and show respect for the culture.\n\nCan you live and get a job in Comoros only speaking English?\n\nIt would be challenging to secure and sustain a job in Comoros solely relying on English. As mentioned earlier, English is not widely spoken or understood in the country. Most job opportunities require proficiency in Comorian, French, or Arabic, as these are the languages commonly used in business and professional settings. However, there may be some specialized positions or international organizations where English fluency is valued, but such opportunities may be limited.\n\nCan you travel in Comoros only speaking English?\n\nTraveling in Comoros with only English proficiency can be difficult. While major tourist areas and hotels may have staff members who speak some English, the majority of the population does not. It is important to note that English signage and information in tourist areas may be limited, and local transportation and services may require knowledge of Comorian, French, or Arabic. To ensure a smoother travel experience, it is recommended to learn some basic phrases in the local language or travel with a guide who can assist with translation."
