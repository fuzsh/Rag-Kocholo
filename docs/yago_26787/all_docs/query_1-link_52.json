        "text": "The Comoros Islands is an archipelago in the Indian Ocean located off the East African coast. It is made up of four islands, Ngazidja (Grand Comore), Mwali (MohÃ©li), Ndzuwani (Anjouan), and MahorÃ© (Mayotte). It is a sovereign state recognized by the United Nations, with a population of 866,595 people and a land area of 2,236 square kilometres. The country is an incredibly diverse cultural and ethnic melting pot of African, Arab, and French influences, and the official languages are French, Arabic, and Comorian, among others. The country's volcanic soil, tropical climate, and abundance of natural resources make it a prime destination for tourists and investors. Comoros has had its fair share of political and economic troubles, but it is a nation on the rise, with a government committed to economic and social progress."
