The Grand Comore (Ngazidja), the largest island in the nation-state, is surrounded by beaches and old lava from the active Mount Karthala Volcano. Each of the islands has an economic and tourist potential characterised by the abundance of Arab and African cultures. The Comoros is a country of peace and security and whose economic wealth, based in particular on agriculture, tourism and the blue economy, remains untapped and to be discovered."
