        "text": "The Comoros economic citizenship program was established in 2001 in accordance with the Union of Comoros Constitution. The Program is regulated by the Law on Economic Citizenship as of 27 November 2008. The last significant amendments to the citizenship by investment scheme were made in 2013. The authority responsible for processing citizenship applications is the National Independent Committee. Citizenship is granted solely by decree of the President of the Republic. The typical processing time is two months from the moment you submit a complete application. However, processing times may vary depending on the complexity of each individual case. After approval, you will get your Comorian citizenship (the Certificate of Naturalization and passport). Passport is valid for 5 years and is renewable upon expiration.\n\nThe Main Advantages\n\nLifetime citizenship at a reasonable cost (compared to other second passport programs). Dual citizenship is recognized. No need to renounce your current citizenship.\n\nSpouse and children under 18 years old are qualified.\n\nFast and simple process. Processing of applications takes up to two months; no residency requirements; no personal interview.\n\nNo risk of losing money without getting the desirable result (Government donation is to be made only after the approval).\n\nNo notification about new citizenship to your home authorities.\n\nNo tax obligations for new citizens\n\nPassport can be used for banking purposes\n\nEligibility:\n\nMain applicant must be at least eighteen years old and must be a foreign person residing outside of the Comoros;\n\nMain applicant must have no criminal record (be of good character), and must not be a member of a terrorist organization;\n\nMain applicant must have made an government donation in the prescribed amount;\n\nThe application procedure is personal (not only for the main applicant but also for the family members).\n\nNationalities restricted from participation: French (i.e. citizens of the French Republic), Iranians. Citizens of the above-mentioned countries are not eligible to apply in the Comoros.\n\nCosts and Fees\n\nThe Comoros economic citizenship is the cheapest one among all of the existing citizenship by investment programs. The government fees are as follows. Main applicant: 45,000, spouse: 20,000, child 0-18 years old: 10,000. All the fees are in US dollars. There will be extra travelling costs (for the applicant, his family members, and the Comoros Immigration Officer) for the application procedure. Application can be made in Turkey or some Middle East country. As for the professional fees, please, contact us to receive a quotation.\n\nVisa Free Entry or Visa on Arrival for the Comorian citizens:\n\nVisa free travel with the Comorian passport is rather limited (51 countries and territories).\n\nAbout the Country\n\nThe official name of the country is the Union of the Comoros. It is a sovereign island nation in the Indian Ocean located Mozambique and Madagascar. Other countries near the Comoros are Tanzania to the northwest and the Seychelles to the northeast. The population, excluding Mayotte, is estimated at 798,000. The Union of the Comoros has three official languages – Comorian, Arabic and French – though French is the sole official language on Mayotte. In addition to many smaller islands, the country consists of the four major islands in the volcanic Comoros archipelago: Grande Comore, Mohéli, Anjouan, and Mayotte. Mayotte, however, has never been administered by an independent Comoros government and continues to be administered by France (currently as an overseas department) as it was the only island in the archipelago that voted against independence in 1974. The Comoros is the only state to be a member of the African Union, Francophonie, Organization of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, and the Indian Ocean Commission. Since independence in 1975, the country has experienced numerous coups d’état and as of 2008 about half the population lives below the international poverty line of US dollars 1.25 a day.\n\nImportant Notice: Comoros citizenship-by-investment program was closed (terminated) by the Comoros Government from May 2017. Please, note that e-mails and questions regarding Comoros citizenship will not be answered.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding citizenship by investment in other countries, for instance, in the Caribbean, contact us today. When you send us an e-mail, please, indicate your citizenship, country of residence, and age of every family member to be included into application. We must have the age in order we could quote the fees and expenses applicable in your case.\n\nLast updated 04.09.2023"
