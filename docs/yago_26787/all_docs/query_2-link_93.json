        "text": "Most visitors to Comoros will require a visa to enter the country. However, the requirements vary depending on your nationality and the length and purpose of your visit.\n\nSome countries are eligible for visa-free travel, while others may be able to obtain a visa on arrival or through Comoros' electronic visa system. Here are the details:\n\nVisa on Arrival: Citizens of the European Union, the United States, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, can obtain a visa on arrival at the airport. It's valid for up to 45 days and costs around 30 euros. Provide your passport (with at least six months before expiry), recent passport-sized photos (x 2), printed proof of accommodation (not just a screenshot on your device), proof of onward travel, and sufficient funds to cover your stay.\n\nElectronic Visa: Comoros also offers an electronic visa system for travellers who need a visa prior to arrival. The e-visa is available for both tourist and business purposes It costs around 50 euros.\n\nIt's important to check with the nearest Comoros embassy or consulate to confirm the specific visa requirements for your nationality and the most up-to-date information on visa applications.\n\nComoros has a tropical climate with two distinct seasons: a wet and a dry season.\n\nWet Season (November to April): January and February are typically the wettest months. The islands receive heavy rainfall and high humidity. But the rain also brings lush vegetation and blooming flowers (ideal for visiting Moheli).\n\nDry Season (May to October): July and August are the coolest months. The islands experience warm, sunny weather with lower humidity and little to no rainfall. This is the peak tourist season."
