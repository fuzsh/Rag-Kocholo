        "text": "Plausibly the centermost country in Africa, the landlocked 622,984 km2 Central Africa Republic, with a population of 5.12 million (2019), engulfed by Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, DRC & Cameroon, is among the shrouded places in Africa simply because the effects of skirmishes and warfares have rendered is one of the poorest in Africa and globally. Be that as it may, C.A.R is elegantly culturally diverse with about 83 languages utilized across it. The biggest of these are: Gbaya (33%), Banda (27%), Mandjia (13.1%), Sarra (11.2%), Mbum (7.5%), Ngbaka (4%). Smaller groups include the forest-dwelling Pygmy, Greek, Yakoma & Yemeni. The nation lingos’ are French and Sangho.\n\nChad, a landlocked country in North-Central Africa, spanning 1.284 million km2 – of vast, arid plains in center, desert in north, dry mountains in northwest, and tropical lowlands in south – only has 3% of arable and fertile land, and none of it has perennial crop. Remarkably, over 190 indigenous dialects are spoken across Chad, by the 16.1 million inhabitants. A vernacular adaptation of Arabic, Chadian Arabic, is the national lingua franca and the language of business, spoken by 40 to 60% of the citizenry. Chad’s two national languages have slighter speakers than native Chadian Arabic, with French being concentrated in the capital (N’Djamena) while usual Arabic is ubiquitous in the north.\n\nThe state languages of the Union of Comoros are French and C. Arabic. Although each language holds alike recognition under the constitution, language use varies across Comoros. Their unofficial minority languages, in particular Malagasy and Swahili, are also spoken on the Island with limited use. Located in the Indian Ocean, betwixt Republic of Mozambique and Madagascar, with four major islands (Ngadizja, Mwali, Maoré and Ndzouani), the Comoros has a land surface of 2,236 km2 with almost 340 km of coastline. The citizenry as at 2019 was 835,000.\n\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is a multilingual nation, where an deemed total of almost 250 unique linguas are used. The official language is French. Four of its natal dialects have the clout of national language: Kituba (or Kikongo), Lingala, Swahili and Tshiluba. Claimed as the cradle of the widespread Bantu lineage, they make up a general majority. Of these, the Luba, Kongo, Teke, Mongo, Rwanda, Azande, Bangi, Rundi, and Boa (alongside their sub-groups) account for 80% of its citizenry. Notable non-Bantu tribes include: Pygmy (Bambuti, Twa and Babinga), Alur, Banda, Barambu, Adamawa, Mangbetu, Bari, Logo and Tusti. In spite of its rich cultural tapestry, tumult and tribal strifes as have adverse post-colonial policies, exploiting Africa’s richest mineral hotspots, rendered D.R.C one of the direful and politically disunited in Africa\n\nImmediately west of D.R.C is the arboreous Republic of Congo, with a population of 5.21 million (2018) over a land surface area of 342,000 km2. Largely covered by dense tropical forest, with Gabon straddling its entire boundary, it is sparsely populated, with more than half of its populace residing in its two largest cities of Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville. Similar to D.R.C, Congo is culturally varied, with almost 55 ethnic groups the largest of these belonging to the Bantu family. Kongo is the most widespread, accounting for 50% of the population. Other common tribes are Teke (17%), M’Boshi (12%) and Pygmies (2.5%). The Congo’s state language is French.\n\nCôte d’Ivoire, expanding over 322,463 km2 with a population of 25 million (2019), is a highly ethnically-diverse country with more than 80 indigenous ethnic groups, belonging to five major ethno-linguistic groups: Akan (32%), Voltaic (or Gur) (15%), Krou (9%), Northern Mandé (12.1%) and Southern Mandé (9%). All these key groups have good linguistic and cultural ties with groups in nearby countries: Krou in Liberia; Kwa related to Akan of Ghana, Togo and Benin; while the Mandé are also found in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali and Burkina Faso; and Gur in Mali, Burkina Faso and Ghana\n\nPositioned at the Bab el Mandeb Strait, that links the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in Northeast Africa, with a nation area of 23,200 km2 and population of about 958,920 (2018), Djibouti is inhabited by two major cultural groups: Afar or Danakil, and Somali. Despite the historic rivalry between these tribes, they are Muslim, Cushitic-speaking, with nomadic customs; and have close cultural affinities. The Afar is an ethnic group that resides in Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Eritrea and comprises 35 percent of Djibouti’s population and lives mainly in southern Djibouti. The Issa (Muslim), who also thrive in Somalia and in Ethiopia make up 60 percent of the population and live mainly in northern Djibouti. In addition to the Issa and Afar, varied Europeans, Arabs, and Ethiopians live in Djibouti. 94 percent of the people are Muslim\n\nAs is with ample African nations, woeful colonial and post-colonial policies in Equatorial Guinea did not propitiate equality among the culturally diverse citizenry. After independence 1968 – previously a Spanish territory – inequalities pilled between tribal groups and migrants, and also within each of the groups. In 1969, the fronting of the Fang, their largest culture, against the myriad ethnic groups of E. Guinea has been studied as a focal impediment to its growth and development. Other notable groups, include: Bubi, Ndowe, Annobonese, Bissio, Bujeba, Fernandinos and Pichingliss."
