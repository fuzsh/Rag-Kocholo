        "text": "CHAPTER 1\n\nA Mozart Concert or Three Simple Chords? Limits for Approval in Admission Tests for Swedish Specialist Music Teacher Education\n\nRagnhild Sandberg-Jurström\n\nKarlstad University\n\nMonica Lindgren\n\nUniversity of Gothenburg\n\nOlle Zandén\n\nLinnæus University and University of Gothenburg\n\nAbstract: Against the background of problems with unarticulated concepts of quality and assessment criteria when assessing music, this article concerns how the limit for approval is constructed and legitimised by jurors when assessing entrance auditions to Swedish specialist music teacher education. The data comprise video documented auditions, focus group conversations, and stimulated-recall based interviews, involving jury members at four music education departments. Social semiotic theory is used to study how jurors assess applicants’ knowledge representations in main instrument tests, what is considered decisive for an approval, and how this set limit is legitimised. Four approaches have been constructed: the demanding education and profession, the supposed capacity of the applicant, the flexible admission situation, and the care of the applicant. What is considered to be the minimum requirement for approval in these constructions differs markedly, which shows a striking difference between the views of jurors within and between institutions on how the applicants’ musical performances on a main instrument should be assessed. These findings are discussed in relation to two possible scenarios of revised admission tests.\n\nKeywords: admission tests, assessment, music teacher education, social semiotic theory, video observations, interviews\n\nCitation of this chapter: Sandberg-Jurström, R., Lindgren, M. & Zandén, O.

However, the design of these tests has varied between different educational institutions and programmes as have the skills, knowledge and attitudes tested (Jørgensen, 2009). The eight specialist music teacher programmes in Sweden qualify students to teach a variety of music subjects including instrumental courses at upper secondary schools. To enter any of these programmes, the applicants’ have to demonstrate skills on a) a main instrument; b) singing to own accompaniment; c) interplay and musical leadership; d) music theory and aural skills. In every test, juries listen to and assess the applicants’ performances based on common criteria and standards communicated by the institutions. In the main instrument tests, the applicants are also ranked for selection to available places. Although the performance at admission tests, and what is recognised as sufficient for approval, seem decisive for accessing applied education, the area is largely unexplored, and there is a great need for research, especially regarding the assessment procedure. In addition, previous research has reported that assessment criteria and norms in higher music educations are not always clearly conceptualised (Harrison et al., 2013; Olsson & Nielsen, 2018). If unarticulated perceptions of knowledge and quality in music are common in higher music education, the credibility and value of assessments in tests for admission to higher music education programmes may be weakened. In Sweden, as in many other western countries, universities must strive for strengthened societal democracy by promoting broadened recruitment. From this perspective, it is important to review various selection methods, not least given the lack of positive results in a recent Swedish experimental study of aptitude testing and assessment procedures for access to teacher education (Universitets- och högskolerådet, 2018). Hence, the interest in this article, which is part of a larger project about assessment of entrance auditions to Swedish specialist music teacher education financed by the Swedish Research Council, is what is considered decisive for approval on main instrument in entrance auditions. The purpose is accordingly to critically examine jurors’ views of the limit for approval in main instrument auditions to Swedish specialist music teacher programmes, and to problematise these with regard to issues of transparency and broadened recruitment.\n\nAssessing Music\n\nEntrance tests with performance auditions on a main instrument are reportedly the most common requirement for both the bachelor of music programmes in Europe (Tomatz, 1996) and the music teaching programmes in USA (Payne & Ward, 2020). Assessments of performance auditions regarding main instrument are reported to concern technical skills, artistic expression, knowledge of music styles, and communication (Olsson, 1997; Sandberg-Jurström et al., in press). However, assessments of music skills can be seen as complex and problematic, for both applicants, evaluators and institutions, due to lack of transparency regarding what is assessed, how judgments are made in different practices, and how criteria are used and interpreted (Olsson, 2014). The need for greater clarity was called for in a study of ensemble playing in a bachelor of music programme, where teachers’ unfamiliarity with documents and procedures, and students’ problems with the grading process resulted in confusion and lack of transparency about how to assess ensemble playing (Harrison et al., 2013). Although sharply articulated criteria were used for technical proficiency in music bachelor courses, the assessments of sense of style, expression and communication used fuzzy criteria with lack of appropriate concepts (Olsson & Nielsen, 2018). Also, non-musical aspects, such as personal traits fitting to teacher profession, are assessed in instrumental tests to specialist music teacher education (Sandberg-Jurström et al., in press), despite lack of such criteria on the institutions, and despite leadership skill tests in other parts of the admission tests.\n\nHence, there are many challenges in assessing musical performance fairly and reliably, for example the degree to which a single performance is indicative of the performer’s “true” ability. This includes the evaluator’s ability to draw reliable conclusions about this ability from a single performance, and intra-rater reliability, for example the effect of previously made assessments on an adjudicator’s subsequent evaluations (Bergee, 2007). Analytic criteria, through the use of rubrics and rating scales, are said to be effective by articulating specific aspects of performances (Bergee, 2003; Stanley et al., 2001) and describing what constitutes acceptable performances (Latimer et al., 2010). Analytic assessment has also been a way of addressing both inter- and intra-rater reliability (Bergee, 2003). Several studies have found that analytic assessments result in higher inter-rater reliability than holistic assessments, especially if the holistic assessment is only communicated through a grade (Ciorba & Smith, 2009). However, as Jonsson and Svingby (2007) notice, there is a risk that “the essence” of a performance can be lost in the pursuit of highly reliable analytic scoring. Likewise, Eisner (2007) argues that judgments in the arts need to bring out the subtle and significant and therefore require refined sensibility narratives and not only the use of measurement. Although analytic criteria provided useful focus during assessment at a tertiary conservatory, examiners preferred fewer criteria and greater focus on subjective responses (Stanley et al., 2001). In spite of using a 30-item rubric for evaluating solo instrumental performances in secondary school, the jurors still made holistic judgements, especially when the assessments were set in the cut point between different achievement levels (Wesolowski et al., 2018). Also, different results depending on the assessment strategy used have been noticed in bachelor of music programmes. Evaluators using analytic criteria gave higher ratings for technical skills and lower ratings for musical expressions, while the opposite was the case when using own personal criteria (Iusca, 2014). However, Sadler (2015) questions the idea that pre-determined criteria are necessary to make fair and reliable qualitative judgments. He claims that judges can make trustworthy assessments “backwards”, by starting from holistic appraisals of a performance and then analysing the criteria (qualities) and standards (degree of these qualities) that are most critical or decisive for the overall quality of the assessed artefact or performance. Standards clarified and instantiated by a selection of works or performances can, according to Sadler (2014), enable mutual “tuning” among the assessors. Also, Sadler (2017) points out that the passing grade, the minimum level of achievement, “should represent satisfactory and suitably competent (not marginal) achievement” (p. 93).\n\nAlthough previous research reports what is assessed, how assessments are made and the effect and questioning of rating resources, little is known of limits for approval. The standards for approval on main instrument at most of the institutions involved in this article are formulated using only two criteria: technical competence and artistic performance, thus opening for fairly holistic assessments. Hence, the main issues in the study are (a) how standards for approval are articulated and interpreted and (b) how the set limit for approval is legitimised.\n\nTheoretical Considerations\n\nThe theoretical framework used in this article is designed to capture how instrumental/vocal skills are represented by applicants’ in auditions for specialist music teacher programmes, and verbally articulated and assessed by jurors. Using a social-semiotic approach, individuals’ meaning-making activities can be rendered visible through their choice and use of historical and socially available semiotic modes to represent and communicate their understandings of, attitudes to, and interpretations of various phenomena in the social world (Kress, 2010). In this regard, multimodal meaning-making, is seen as the realisation and articulation of particular aspects of the reality in ways appropriate to the interests of social actors in specific contexts. This implies that semiotic modes, such as speech, images and gestures, offering variations of resources, let individuals represent what they regard as knowledge of the world. In such processes the term transduction is used to signal a re-articulation of meaning from one mode to another (Kress, 2010). In the present study, this approach provides the opportunity to see and hear how applicants transduce pieces of music into music performances by using instrumental, vocal and bodily resources as well as musical resources such as dynamics and timing. It also provides the opportunity to see and hear what understandings of music style and practice the applicants’ express and communicate in their performances. According to Kress (2009), knowledge assessment in an institutional context is intended to recognise signs of learning, i.e. to see the result of a meaning-making engagement. This implies how jurors see, hear and understand the applicants’ communicated representations of skills and understandings in order to recognise required knowledge, and how jurors transduce their own multimodal experience into descriptions and evaluations. Thus, the focus in this study is mainly on jurors’ verbally expressed values and assessments of the applicants’ knowledge representations, and how the jurors legitimise their statements.\n\nParticipants and Analysis\n\nFor data collection, video documentation illustrating the use of semiotic resources (Jewitt, 2006), focus group/individual interviews addressing specific themes (Wibeck, 2000), and stimulated recall method for comments on video recorded situations (Calderhead, 1981) were used. The data comprise video documented entrance auditions and audio or video documented conversations with jury members. Some of these were structured individual conversations, while others were focus groups with two to four participants. In all, 59 jury members from four Swedish institutions offering music teacher education programmes participated. The institutions were chosen from a total of eight institutions offering specialist music teacher education programmes, and the selection was based on variation in institutional background, current organization, teacher programme profile and musical genre. Most of the interviews were conducted within two weeks of the entrance auditions, and a few within two months. The jurors were invited to select videos of the auditions they assessed and were asked to comment on the quality of the applicants’ performances. They were asked to use the videos to remind themselves of their thoughts and evaluations at the time of the auditions, and the few jurors who were not present at the auditions were simply asked to comment on what they saw and heard in the videos. They were also asked to reflect on entrance auditions for specialist music teacher education in general.\n\nIn the first step of analysis, in order to understand what is going on in the performances, parts of the selected video-recorded sequences were transduced by the researchers into musical scores illustrating what is visible and audible in the applicants’ music playing. In the presentation of the findings these transcriptions are visible as well. Furthermore, this step also concerned the researchers short analyses of the transcriptions. The second step of analysis, includes codifying of the jurors’ detailed descriptions of what they could see and hear in the applicants’ performances, as well as the qualities and skills that caught their attention in the representations. The third step of analysis, concerned distinguishing and categorising variations in the jurors’ meta-reflections about what was communicated and recognised as acceptable knowledge and skills in the applicants’ representations. In addition to identifying constructions of the acceptable limit for approval, the jurors’ rhetorical strategies to legitimise these constructions were also analysed, and what seemed to be at stake when deciding the limit for a pass.\n\nThe Swedish Research Council’s guidelines regarding information requirements, de-identification, voluntary participation and consent were followed for both jurors and video-recorded applicants. For ethical reasons and the risk for recognition, de-identification has been made without references in the quotations. In presenting the results, no statements or categories are attributed to specific institutions, juries or individual jurors. When a dialogue between jurors is cited, a dash is used before each statement. In the block quotations, deleted passages are indicated with ellipses.\n\nApproaches to the Limit for Approval\n\nIn the analysis of what is considered decisive for an approved main instrument test, and how limits of approval are legitimised, four approaches have been constructed: the demanding education and profession; the supposed capacity of the applicant; the flexible admission conditions, and the care of the applicant. In the following, the researchers’ transcriptions and short analyses of excerpts from the auditions are followed by quotations from the jurors’ comments on the applicants’ performances and the researchers’ analyses of jurors’ statements.\n\nThe Demanding Education and Profession\n\nThe construction of the demanding education and profession is based on the view that the applicants’ knowledge representations, and the limit for approval, must be at a level that ensures good or very good potential for development and prospect for managing the education and the future professional life.\n\nIn Figure 1, an applicant’s use of vocal and bodily resources are highlighted where the end of an improvised part in a jazz song switches to the regular melody:\n\nHow the applicant used the voice, intonated and articulated the tones shows signs of some vocal technical skills. The applicant’s gaze and the movements with hands and arms can be seen as a communicative act directed both to the pianist in the band and the jury, although the gaze is only directed in these directions a few times during the excerpt. The applicant’s use of bodily resources and way of transducing notes and chords into improvised singing can all be seen as a genre-based interpretation. A juror verbalises a similar understanding of the applicant’s skills:\n\nI also listen to the feel for rhythm, the timing, and he is very distinct … What you can hear is that he may not be so much into jazz … he is not especially free rhythmically in his phrasing, but he sings very accurately … you hear that he is musical … I think one should sing without the music [in front of him], which he does not, and I would like to see a little more expression … but he opens a little and communicates with the audience, that is, us … what mainly makes him approved is that number one, he sings in pitch, he nails the notes, he has a free [sound], he has a very good technique … he is totally relaxed [in the body].\n\nWhat is recognised as approved knowledge in this statement is that the applicant has developed good technical and performing skills. It also is suggested that an approved level does not necessarily require much expression, clear bodily communication with fellow musicians, good knowledge of jazz or knowing the music by ear even if this is considered desirable. Necessary representations of knowledge are legitimised as follows:\n\nIf you haven’t worked so much with shuffle, that is triplet phrasing, then it would be, because we have so much jazz in the education so you need some of that … it’s part of the tools that must be in place to get through …\n\nIt’s rhythmically improvised music … the whole package should be there. It must be anchored rhythmically in the bodies, in the music making, otherwise it will not work.\n\nThe requirement to be able to use jazz-related music resources is related to the possibility of managing a five-year music teacher education with focus on the jazz field, which is not seen as feasible without adequate skills. Within this construction also the limit of approval is legitimised through adaptation to the structure of the education, especially with regard to the demands of the ensemble courses, which according to some jurors define the high level:\n\nYes, and they usually have the ensemble, and it kick-starts. It is not [organised in] ability groups, it is also mixed ensembles and then you look at, will this one manage to get started in this … has [the applicant] the knowledge to solve or problematise the songs and learn them.\n\nIn the symphony orchestra with XX they play very challenging repertoire. Sometimes it’s Beethoven … It’s original stuff.\n\nThe proficiency level needed for participation in the institution’s orchestras and smaller ensembles, and the capacity to solve problems that may arise in the repertoire, is taken as arguments for requiring a high level of skills and knowledge. The limit for approval is also legitimised by the small number of instrumental lessons that are provided. Accordingly, the limit for approval is based on adaptation to the structure of the education to ensure quality linked to the education requirements.\n\nThe construction of the demanding education and profession is also based on assertions suggesting that the applicant’s performed knowledge representations should be at a very high level, equal to the approved limit demanded for admission to a bachelor of music. Since very high instrumental or vocal skills are required in order to cope with the high demands of both the studies and the coming profession, a demand for well-founded technical and interpretative knowledge representations is therefore strongly emphasized. The importance of such skills is exemplified in the statement below:\n\nNow this is university studies and you know what the first year is like. It’s pretty tough. There is no time for ten hours a day practicing the violin, so [those skills] must already be at hand, so we need to set a level where they are so skilled that they have time to tackle other subjects the first and second year … we want those who are self-propelled … So, for me there is no difference … the level … should be at least as high for music teachers as it is for musicians because it is the same profession. And the students we send out from here should be able to take care of all different kinds of children and young people and talents, and be able to help them to become amateur musicians or have great fun in groups or those who want to be able to apply here. And then they have to know a lot.\n\nThe excerpt shows how the applicants’ knowledge representations are related to, above all, the high demands on skills in the main instrument tests in bachelor music programmes, with the suggestion that the musician and the specialist music teacher require the same high instrumental skills. The demand for a very high level on the main instrument already at the start of the programme is legitimised by the high pace in the studies and the time competition with other courses included in the music teacher programme. Very high demands are also argued for with reference to the education’s university status as well as to the necessity to secure the future music teacher’s need for high instrumental skills. Similar reflections are made by other jurors, for example:\n\nThis training programme, at least in our house, requires an awful lot of prior knowledge because you don’t have much time for your own instrument … are we talking about reality or what we want? We want something completely different. We want a Mozart concert, just like the musician programme … You have to know how the instrument works at that level, having nailed the basic technique, and the left hand speed and position changes, all that.\n\nThis statement suggests that the very high requirements for instrumental skills are not always met in the applicant’s knowledge representations, but rather constitute a wishful thinking. In other statements, past specialist music teacher educations are highlighted as exemplary, with higher quality requirements and significantly more instrument lessons. This construction thus signals that a change has taken place over the years and that there now is a need for higher demands on the applicants, which in the jurors’ statements shows a desire not only to adapt the requirements to the current educational programme, but also to a historical context.\n\nThe Supposed Capacity of the Applicant\n\nThe starting point for the construction of the supposed capacity of the applicant is conversations about an absolute lowest, marginal limit for a pass. This construction is based on jurors’ reflections on applicants whose knowledge representations are judged to be mostly below the jurors’ suggested limit for approval, and therefore between fail and pass, but that are nevertheless being recognised as acceptable. Here, in spite of an applicant’s lacking qualifications, the jurors hope that he or she will be able to learn the skills that the education and the profession require.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates an applicant performing their own composition in which music-related resources, such as singing and guitar accompaniment, and bodily resources are used:\n\nThe applicant shows some instrumental technical skills with the voice, as well as with three simple and rhythmically played chords on the guitar. Head movements and directed gazes coordinated with accentuation on certain words can be seen as signs either of genre-based interpretation, difficulties in singing higher notes or attempts at communicating intensity to the listeners (bars 1, 3 and 4). The jurors evaluate the applicant’s skills as follows:\n\nYes, it’s only three chords for a very long time and the melody is, yes, it is unbelievably plain. The text is horrible.\n\nThe guitar playing, monotonous, without variations, just the typical pop chords everyone plays, nothing original. He doesn’t contribute with variation in the accompaniment there, mediocre … it’s exactly the same level of energy, no change.\n\nThe applicant’s knowledge representations are obviously not recognised as acceptable. The jurors wish for resources such as more interesting text, more chords, originality, varied accompaniment and variations in energy levels. They also miss chords other than those associated with the pop genre, despite the fact that a pop focus is prioritised in this test. In the argumentation about the applicant’s communicated skills, there are considerable doubts about an approval:\n\nHe feels very unaware of what music can be, like form, dynamics, phrases, directions, it is just like a single, it is very unaware, very immature and then, he is not really young and the question is, how much can this guy develop given he has not come further at 22 or whatever? How much more can he improve, and should he teach high school students at the high school where all kinds of individuals are studying, including future world stars too. Should they have him as a music teacher?\n\nThe suggested lack of musical skills and understanding, the age of the applicant and the development possibilities are related to the opportunity to, within five years, teach music in a high school where some students can be on a very advanced level. However, the applicant was approved, albeit below the very limit for approval, and due to a single, narrowly passed test on another instrument. In jurors’ statements, the phrase “benefit of the doubt” is often used, suggesting that inadequacies could somehow be overcome during the education. In this construction a lack of skills on the main instrument can be compensated by skills on other instruments or by competencies shown in other parts of the admission tests. Although the jurors show signs of doubt about an applicant’s capacity to cope with the education, may still be admitted if the skills are likely to be developed so that the applicant can become a “decent” teacher. It is also suggested that the tests can be seen as diagnostic rather than excluding, implying that applicants with low skills are suggested to have possibilities to learn enough during five years given the right support. Thus, the “door is slightly open” for these applicants, which might call for institutional adaptation to applicants rather than the opposite.\n\nThe Flexible Admission Conditions\n\nThe construction of the flexible admission conditions is based on the idea that the limit for approval does not necessarily have to be fixed, but can be changed depending on contextual and institutional conditions. The view of what is recognised as acceptable skills is considered as dependent on available education places and the number of applicants at the time of application. Also the jurors’ views of what to be assessed as well as the absence of clearly stated standards are considered to affect the limit for approval.\n\nOne applicant drummer’s use of the drum set and the body as resources, when playing with a guitarist in a jazz song, is illustrated in Figure 3:\n\nThe applicant’s transduction of the original song to the drum set takes place with a steady and simple drum pattern (bar 1–3) with some added rhythms on the snare drum and the cymbals (bar 4–5). Some communication with fellow players through gazes is visible (bar 1–3). The volume is the same throughout the song, the applicant’s body is rigid and the playing is rhythmically static. In the jurors’ reflections, several depreciating metaphorical linguistic resources are used:\n\nFor the present it is a pass, obviously, but it is puppyish …\n\nYes, it is.\n\nBut also, the fill-ins, I mean these digidigi, that is. It feels very quiet, aah, youngish and a bit, unmusically is the wrong word, but like.\n\nAlmost unstructured or nearly careless.\n\nLike, slapish …\n\nHe is banging himself through it rather than playing, in my opinion.\n\nInterviewer: But what makes him approved, nevertheless?\n\nWell, but he keeps it together, so it doesn’t fall like a house of cards … we’re like still standing. It’s okay, but he hasn’t really added anything. It is very inside, it is very, like, eh, simple stuff and equally thick and bad dynamics, quite uninteresting.\n\nIn the juror’s dialogue, the low technical level, the dull performance, the rigid body movements and immature performance seem to be redeemed by the playing holding together. Not only is the performance approved, but an even lower level could have been accepted. Also, the applicant’s instrumental skills are not considered decisive:\n\nIt will nearly always be alright, no matter what level they are at. It’s just to take it where they are … he has the water surface here, you know (points under his nose) … but he survives, so to speak. It is not here (points over the nose), so it would work in an ensemble situation, though a bit on the border … but I could actually accept someone doing it even worse. I just want to know, well just feel that it is not completely like black.\n\nHere it is implicated that it is entirely possible to learn what is required during the five-year education provided that the applicant can function in different ensemble situations. What is recognised as crucial is, if anything, the ability to develop further with a teacher’s support despite few technical and interpretative resources represented. However, the final decision for approved is legitimised on the basis of institutional and contextual conditions:\n\nAgain, it’s a bit about how, how broad the line-up is (a dry laughter). This year he probably would have been [accepted], when they are five applicants …\n\nInterviewer: But do you change the limit for approval depending on how many the applicants are?\n\nWell it’s about the competition, sort of. Like, we have to have something, so at the end we have to set the bar on the basis of this year’s applicants.\n\nThe limit for approval here is very flexible, depending on the number of applicants and their result of the tests, given that it is important to fill up the places available. It also happens that administrative staff asks for approval despite low scores due to vacant places. The lack of an absolute assessment scale is also considered to contribute to variations of the limit for approval. However, to ensure the quality, admitted applicants are considered to have at least some potential for development. As a result, the level of approval may change year by year at the same institution, and applicants can be assessed on the basis of different premises, depending on the jurors, institution and the admission situation. One consequence of these statements is that the threshold for pass is flexible and unstable with fuzzy conceptions of quality and a strong adaptation to the prevailing conditions.\n\nThe Care of the Applicant\n\nIn the jurors’ conversations of what cannot be approved, a limit for approval describing what is insufficient and not recognised as acceptable skills, is also expressed. The construction of the care of the applicant is based on statements in which applicants, due to undeveloped and insignificant musical qualities in their performances, are not considered to be able to learn what is required during the course of the education and therefore will not become good enough teachers. Starting the programme with such qualifications would be far too difficult for a future student.\n\nFigure 4a illustrates an excerpt from the original composition and 4b the applicant’s use of musical and bodily resources when playing four bars from the classic piano repertoire:\n\nThe applicant’s transduction from the original sheet of music to piano playing includes missing notes, rhythmic indistinctness, an unsteady pulse, relatively too much pedal and a lack of prescribed changes in dynamics and tempo. The performance is interrupted after several flaws. The applicant seems to focus on the printed music throughout the performance, and the body is fairly rigid. Two jurors reflect on the applicant’s knowledge representations as follows:\n\nShe has already made two mistakes here … it was a tie and then it was a wrong note and then it was rhythmically a bit limping at the beginning … then it says piano crescendo and fairly obviously back to pianissimo … and bit by bit stringendo … it is very very clear instructions but she has none of that. Exactly the same nuances right through … it doesn’t feel that there is an idea.\n\nThere is a lot to do with her hand … the body is rather free, but she doesn’t use her arms in an organic or good way.\n\nThe applicant’s skills are not considered to be at a sufficient technical or interpretative level given several flaws, such as the rhythmical problems, lack of dynamics and expression as well as improper use of arms and hands. It is considered important to understand, use and reinforce the music with the body. The consequence of insufficient knowledge representations is argued:\n\nI imagine her in the role of piano teacher, and what kind of musical ideas will you have to give your students, eight or sixteen or whatever [age] they are.\n\nIt’s troublesome if you start from a too low level, it will not be good for anyone, not the person in question, not for the fellow students, not for the students, or for the students this person will teach, and not for society at large.\n\nYou really wouldn’t put them in a totally uncomfortable experience. And it’s not just that it drags down the others. It can also be very disruptive for their future.\n\nHere, a rejection of applicants is motivated by care for them. Otherwise, they should “probably have a number of tough life stories and sad people”. With low skills, it is considered difficult to learn enough to be able to mediate something essential to future students. Low skills on the instrument are also considered to impair the applicants’ ability to function in interaction with other students. The level of knowledge is here legitimised as a care of the applicant, since insufficient skills are expected to result in problems both for the applicant and for future fellow students. Thus, this construction emphasizes not only the importance of securing the requirements of the education and profession, but above all the well-being of the future student.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is a striking difference between the views of how jurors define and argue for limits for approval when assessing applicant’s musical performances on main instruments. What is considered to be the requirement for approval differs markedly from the highest level with very high requirements, such as a Mozart concert, to the lowest level with acceptance of major deficiencies, by way of singing and playing three simple chords. The jurors also judge the applicants on the basis of premises other than the criteria and standards communicated to both evaluators and applicants through the institutions’ information channels. The applicants’ potential for musical development, their capacity to meet the educational and professional requirements and their ability to adapt to teachers and fellow students as well as future students, school and society is presented as essential by the jurors. Person-related evaluations of applicants’ knowledge representations are also voiced, and it does not seem uncommon that the level for pass is adapted to the ratio of the number of applicants to the available places. Such lack of transparency regarding criteria used to evaluate an applicant has also been reported by Harrison et al. (2013), and by Olsson and Nielsen (2018) who have found unarticulated or fuzzy criteria in higher music education. Also, the varying views regarding competences needed for admission to the education coincide largely with ideas about what and how much is considered necessary and possible to learn during the music teacher education and what competences a future music teacher is expected to possess after completed education. The compass of expected knowledge and skills necessary for admission found in this study is thus paralleled by the scope of exit expectations, from being able to probably become a rather functioning teacher at an ordinary secondary school to becoming a highly-qualified teacher for advanced music students at a music profile upper secondary school.\n\nIn the light of these variations, we will discuss the findings from the perspective of the transparency. We also take the opportunity to suggest what to consider when developing the tests by outlining two scenarios. Scenario 1 is related to the design of the admission situations in our study, where jointly set tests and standards are common in most of the institutions. In this scenario, homogeneous specialist music teacher training programmes are strived for, where similar structure, criteria and limit for approval in the programmes require a common lowest level for admittance, here linked to the construction of the demanding education and profession. Based on this scenario, today’s skill tests would need to be revised and developed so that they assess only musical skills and knowledge. Analytical criteria would be the basis here, rather than the fairly holistic criteria, with place for a variety of interpretations, that can be said to take precedence today. This type of homogeneous proficiency test has been advocated in previous research and proved effective and reliable (Bergee, 2003; Wesolowski et al., 2018). Furthermore, the joint development of a combination of verbalised and instantiated standard for approval suggested by Sadler (2014) could provide the necessary “tuning” and harmonisation of an assessment culture. Such standards could clarify the judgement process, both for applicants and for jurors, and may deter from assessing other competencies than musical skills. Although this scenario would assure transparency to obtain a place on a specialist music teacher programme, no matter where in the country the applicant chooses to study, it could render a broadened recruitment more difficult unless the tests are opened for other traditions of music-making.\n\nScenario 2 is related to the findings of varying approaches of limits for approval, regardless of jurors, jury groups and institutions. This scenario is based on a completely different logic. Here, variation and pluralism are sought instead of homogeneity, and variation in requirements is seen as an advantage and not a problem. Educational institutions with differing profiles generate different criteria and standards for approval and ranking. Here, Sadler’s (2014) clarification of standards through examples can be useful both to provide consistency of grading within institutions and to clarify the differences between institutions regarding demands and profiles. Applicants can then choose a university based on their own musical profile and background, which would create opportunities for applicants with a broader spectrum of competencies to enter a music teacher programme. In this scenario, explicitly marketed variations of requirements for approval between institutions can from a national perspective be a way of widening recruitment to the music teacher profession and thereby contribute to a strengthened democracy. Regardless of which scenario is realised, however, criteria and standards for the approved level, as well as criteria for ranking approved applicants, must strive for transparency in order for the tests to be considered reliable and fair as a selection tool for music teacher education in Sweden.\n\nFunding\n\nThe work was supported by the Swedish Research Council, grant number 2017–03425.\n\nReferences\n\nBergee, M.

Investigating the Role of the Principal Instrument in Music Teacher Education Programs\n\nFritz Flåmo Eidsvaag & Elin Angelo\n\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology\n\nAbstract: This chapter investigates the role of the principal instrument in music teacher education programs that qualify people to teach music in Norwegian compulsory schools. The data material for the study is the mapping of 12 music teacher education institutions and the reflection notes from six music teacher educators. The theoretical premises for the paper are Aristotle’s concept of techné and Fullan’s description of deep learning. Techné concerns both technical skills and artistic sensitivity, and this combination provides a framework in which to discuss the educators’ reflections about the principal instrument in music teacher education in relation to deep learning, which entails commitment, perseverance, and the learner as a whole human being. This chapter leans on previous studies on music teacher education and the new curriculum for Norwegian compulsory schools, and the concluding remarks point to new perspectives that are needed to evolve music teacher education, concerning both the subject of music and what skills and types of knowledge music teachers should ideally have.\n\nKeywords: principal instrument, music teacher education, techné, deep learning\n\nCitation of this chapter: Eidsvaag, F.

As part of this discussion, the students were asked by the facilitator to place themselves on an axis from left to right, where the left side reflected the standpoint that specialist music knowledge was crucial for teaching music in school and the right side that specialist knowledge was less important. The Norwegian generalist students generally positioned themselves further to the right and the specialist students further to the left. This reflected a great difference in their views on the knowledge and skills that are necessary for music teachers. This exercise led to a follow-up discussion among the students about how their music teacher education programs emphasize specialist music knowledge differently.\n\nOngoing discussions in the international field of music education research concern the content, forms, and aims that should constitute music teacher education programs (e.g., Bowman, 2007; Johansen, 2007; Kaschub et al., 2014; Sætre, 2014, 2018). A central topic in these discussions is the relative importance of generalist knowledge and specialized knowledge for the effective teaching of music in schools (e.g., De Vries, 2015; Dobrowen, 2020; Holden & Button, 2006). In this chapter, we approach this topic by examining how skills with a principal instrument is emphasized in music teacher education programs that qualify people to teach in Norwegian primary and secondary schools. Historically, music education builds on a master-apprentice tradition, wherein a master (for example, of the violin or piano) teaches learners at various levels (Gies, 2019). This tradition is also found in music teacher education programs in Norway (Sætre, 2014). Today, this tradition is challenged or supplemented by music technology, and there is reason to believe that the same challenges concerning authentic and inauthentic learning and learning spaces as presented by Eiksund and Reistadbakk (2020), is also valid in the education of music teachers. For teaching classroom music in primary and secondary schools, the debates center on who are best suited as teachers, those with expertise on an instrument or those with expertise in classrooms and teaching young pupils (Daniel & Parkes, 2017; De Vries, 2015; Hennessy, 2000; Holden & Button, 2006; Rusell-Bowie, 2009; Seddon & Biasutti, 2008; Wiggins & Wiggins, 2008). These debates reveal a lack of confidence among generalist school teachers towards teaching music, which does not necessarily correspond to a lack of skills or formal music education. The debates also point to a frequent notion about music as a “special” subject in school that requires and nurtures given talent (Hennessy, 2000; Ruddock & Leong, 2005; Russell & Bowie, 2013). We aim to contribute to these discussions by examining the research question: How is a principal instrument emphasized in music teacher education in Norway? We were curious to find out how much time is dedicated to the student’s principal instrument in diverse music teacher education programs and how music teacher educators reflect upon the time spent on principal instruments. Our data material for this study is derived from (1) a survey of institutions that offer music teacher education programs qualifying people to teach music in Norwegian primary and lower secondary schools and (2) reflection texts from six music teacher educators working in these institutions. By using the theoretical and philosophical premises from Aristotle’s concept of techné and the concept of deep learning in educational theory and curricula (Fullan & Langworthy, 2013; Fullan et al., 2018; NOU, 2015: 8), the discussions about the role of the principal instrument in music teacher education can be deepened and the division between generalist/specialist musical skills challenged.\n\nOur motivation for this study partly relates to the new curriculum for primary and lower secondary schools introduced in Norway (2020) and to its increased focus on music as a practical and creative subject, as well as the introduction of the concept of deep learning in the curriculum. For example, music is presented as a subject with creative power that fuels the pupil’s urge to explore, create, and experiment. Deep learning concerns the pupil’s gradual development in understanding the concepts, systems, methods, and contexts within a particular subject area, as well as topics and issues that intersect several areas. Central to the idea of deep learning is that students engage in analyzing and problem-solving and that they reflect upon their own learning to construct a lasting understanding (NOU, 2015: 8). These aspects of deep learning make it relevant for examining the place of the principal instrument in music teacher education. Our motivation also builds on previous research on the subject of music in compulsory schools in Norway (e.g., Bandlien, 2019; Dobroven, 2020; Fredriksen, 2018) and other Scandinavian countries (e.g., Georgii-Hemming & Westwall, 2010; Holgersen & Holst, 2020; Lindgren & Ericsson, 2011) and international research on music teacher education (e.g., Bowman, 2007; Kaschub et al., 2014). A main topic in this research is how music education in schools can be understood as an individual pursuit, with little support provided by the school as an organization and the professional community (Benedict & Schmidt, 2014; Dobrowen, 2020; Fredriksen, 2018; Georgii-Hemming & Westwall, 2010). Another major topic is the underlying tension between the positioning of the subject of music as an arena for the pupil’s general growth and well-being, or as an arena in which to gain specific musical knowledge and skills (Bowman, 2007; Lindgren & Ericsson, 2011). A third main topic relates to the music teacher’s competence, background, and tasks, and to the critical questioning of who is best suited to teach music in the compulsory school; the specialized music teacher or the generalist teacher who teaches music as one of several school subjects (Dobrowen, 2020; De Vries, 2015, 2013; Hennessy, 2000; Holden & Button, 2006; Wiggins & Wiggins, 2008). Previous research elaborates on how teachers with different educational backgrounds, as specialists or generalists, tend to choose different content and activities in their music teaching. For example, Sætre et al. (2016) found that teachers in the lower grades (1–4) often are female, seldom use instruments in their classes, and have low participation in non-formal musical activities outside of school (choirs, wind bands, etc.), while music teachers in the higher grades often are male, use instruments, and are more oriented towards individual musical activities, such as composing, listening, and playing. Interestingly, a study about music and other arts subjects in generalist teacher education in Sweden (Lindgren & Ericsson, 2011) revealed that a lack of specialized competence is seen as a sign of pedagogical quality, as this equalizes the position between the teachers and the students and makes the subjects (e.g., music) seem less threatening.\n\nIn this chapter, we follow up on the discussion between the Norwegian and Dutch music teacher students (from the start of the chapter), by examining how a principal instrument is emphasized in music teacher education programs. The chapter has four parts. The first part elaborates on the concepts of techné and deep learning, which serve as the theoretical premises for our discussion. The second part explains our research design: (i) how we mapped the diverse music teacher educational programs that exist in Norway, and the hours spent on a principal instrument in these programs, and (ii) how we conducted the work of gaining reflection notes from six educators in these programs. After analyzing and discussing these in the chapter’s third part, we end the chapter with some concluding remarks on the (perhaps artificial) division between specialist and generalist music teachers, and about a possible reconsideration of principal instruments in transgressive and transformative music teacher education.\n\nTheoretical Perspectives\n\nTo theoretically dive into the new curriculum’s emphasis on practical and creative work in music and deep learning, Aristotle’s concept of techné serves as our entrance. Our use of the term techné is philosophically geared through Heidegger’s philosophy on art, and music-pedagogically geared through Varkøy et al.’s thoughts about music and craftsmanship (Aristotle, 2011; Heidegger, 2006; Varkøy et al., 2020). The Greek concept of techné (English: art) concerns the necessary knowledge of bringing something new into the world and implies both technical skills and artistic sensitivity. Technical skills are undoubtedly needed to play an instrument, and performing musicians need technical knowledge. This knowledge may also be necessary for music teachers in teaching pupils to play and sing alone and together with others. However, the Aristotelian term techné does not refer to mere technical skill, but rather to the knowledge that allows one to perceive the sense of “being” and be able to put this into one’s work, in artworks (Heidegger, 2006). Related to music and art, this interpretation of techné coincides with the term “handicraft” and with the aesthetic aspects of artistic expression and craftsmanship. In this sense, handicraft does not relate to mere technical skill but to a way of knowing that is crucial for bringing something new and authentic into the world. In this view, techné (both skills and sensitivity) is needed to “do” (make/create/explore) music, as required in the curriculum (The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, 2019). Importantly, techné is not about the superficial skills needed to reproduce (as machines) but is deeply rooted in the essence of human beings. Music, understood as an object, is also suggested to imply depth, with different layers of meaning that correspond to different layers of human consciousness (Nielsen, 1998, pp. 137–139). From this perspective, refinement in playing a principal instrument can be seen as revealing forms of knowledge that contain depth in relation to the craft, the music played, and the human being.\n\nThe concept of deep learning has flourished in international educational literature and research from mid-2000 and is heavily emphasized in the 2020 curriculum for compulsory schools in Norway (Ministry of Education and Research, 2017; NOU, 2015: 8). This idea can be traced back to the mid-1970s (Marton & Säljö, 1976) and refers to the distinction between surface learning (simple memorization of new ideas) and deeper learning (actively integrating new ideas with previous knowledge and creating new connections between concepts) (Ahrony, 2006; Biggs, 1999). The concept of deep learning has been employed in general research on education, teaching, and learning (e.g., Biggs, 2004; Filius et al., 2018; Hay, 2007), in research on different subjects and in diverse contexts (e.g., Rillero, 2016; Hall et al., 2004), and in music education research (e.g., Ferm & Johansen, 2008). So far, however, we have not found studies that employ this term specifically with regard to teaching and training in a principal instrument. Garrison et al. (2001) emphasized that the whole person needs to be engaged to promote deep learning cognitively, socially, and affectively. Deep learning is thus meaningful learning that goes beyond the acquisition of new skills and information.\n\nMichael Fullan and his colleagues explain deep learning as a means to develop learners to become creative, connected, collaborative, engaged, and healthy individuals with skills to pursue their own visions in an ever-emerging world (Fullan et al., 2018, 2013). Fullan describes deep learning skills as concerning character (e.g., honesty, self-regulation, perseverance, responsibility, and self-confidence), citizenship (e.g., sensitivity and respect for others), communication, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, creativity, and imagination. The Ludvigsen Committee (NOU, 2015: 8), which has thoroughly prepared and influenced the new curriculum in Norway, defines deep learning as the understanding of concepts and interrelationships within one discipline or across disciplines, which is developed and nurtured gradually and over time. They explain deep learning as characterized by processes in which the pupils become absorbed by the learning material over time, are given suitable challenges, and receive useful feedback. The students’ own reflections on their learning are emphasized as necessary to improve their understandings of the connections between disciplines (NOU, 2015: 8, p. 14). However, a critique of the curriculum’s explanation of deep learning is that it is one-sided, targeted towards the cognitive perspective of learning, but lacks the perspectives of childhood and adolescence, as well as humanity and society as a whole, which are needed to fully grasp the complexity of learning in primary and secondary schools (Østern et al., 2019). In our study, the tensions and topics around the concept of deep learning, as related to the above discussions of the concept of techné, serve as a framework in which to discuss the mapping and the reflections on the importance of principal instruments in music teacher education.\n\nResearch Design\n\nIn Norway, several paths can be chosen to gain formalized qualifications to teach music in primary (grades 1–7) and secondary (grades 8–10) schools. Some of these paths are clearly targeted towards music and musicians, with pedagogical courses as an add-on education. Others are clearly targeted towards classroom teaching and the teacher profession. To gain an overview of this varied landscape, our first step was to map what education programs confer the formal qualification of music teacher in compulsory schools in Norway, and the amount of lesson hours on a principal instrument these programs offer. Our second step was to approach six music teacher educators from the two types of music teacher education programs that are most targeted towards the teacher profession (types 1 and 2, which will be explained in the results section) and ask them to reflect openly on four questions about the role of the principal instrument in their education.\n\nIn 2018–2020 we conducted the mapping part first through finding the diverse institutions that offer music teacher education in Norway. This information was found in the Ministry of Education and Research’s list of state-owned universities and university colleges and through web searches of private institutions, such as the Barratt Due Academy. In total, 12 institutions were located. Secondly, we found the relevant contacts and e-mail addresses via the different institutions’ web pages and forwarded our questions to the music education program leaders. These questions concerned (1) the amount of principal instrument lessons given to each student during their music teacher education, and (2) the duration of these lessons (appendix 1). These steps provided us with the information to map the landscape and identify huge differences in the amount of lesson time given to principal instruments and the duration of these lessons (appendix 3). To further explore how the principal instrument was viewed in these education programs, we needed qualitative data. To generate these, we designed a short reflection note, with four questions, and emailed them to six music teacher educators (later referred to as E1–E6), including a question on their willingness to participate. E1-E3 are from the specialist music teacher education (SMTE) and E4-E5 are from generalist teacher education (GTE). E6 is from both SMTE and GTE. These six reflection notes are seen as examples, not as representative of music teacher educators’ views on the place of the principal instrument in music teacher education. The questions were designed to encourage freely written reflections on the educators’ meanings about the role of the principal instrument in their education (appendix 2). The written form was chosen to provide the teachers with the freedom to write and revise whenever they had time.\n\nThe analysis of the reflection texts was done through a qualitative, inductive approach, identifying the reoccurring themes across the texts (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Creswell & Creswell, 2018). The six reflection texts (altogether 20 pages) were arranged in groups relating to what kind of music teacher education program the educators were engaged in: (i) specialist music teacher education or (ii) generalist music teacher education. Secondly, we read the texts with the aim of grasping a general description of these programs, along with the overall meanings ascribed to the role of the principal instrument in these programs. To facilitate this process, we wrote notes in the margins of the texts, collected these notes in a new document, and used these to write a small description of the two programs, which is presented in the results section of this chapter. As a third step, we aimed to identify the reoccurring aspects that the six educators expressed across the programs and then form these into themes for deepening the discussion. This step was implemented through a process of further synthesizing the reflection texts, bracketing segments and highlighting words and expressions that reoccurred in the six texts. From this investigation, we identified three themes: subject-specific, human-specific, and learning-specific. These themes were then advanced and discussed by mirroring them against the concepts of techné and deep learning (Aristotle, 2011; Heidegger, 2006; Varkøy et al., 2020). Our backgrounds and experiences as music teachers and music teacher educators were both fruitful and challenging in this analytical work; fruitful because we could relate to the contexts and practices described and challenging because we aimed for the analysis to grow from the data and not from our background and preunderstandings. To meet this challenge, we constantly returned to the raw texts throughout the whole process and adjusted the in-progress analysis of the descriptions and the wording of the themes with regard to what the six educators actually wrote. In the following section, quotes and critical questions are provided to improve the transparency of the research process. This study has been conducted in line with the Norwegian Guidelines for Research Ethics in the Social Sciences, Humanities, Law and Theology (NESH, 2016) and the guidelines and requirements from the Norwegian Data Protection Services (NSD). All six educators who provided reflection notes are anonymized, and direct consultation with the NSD has ensured that the whole research process is conducted in line with the GDRP rules for privacy protection.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nThe Mapped Landscape\n\nSeveral paths can be followed to gain formal qualifications as a compulsory school music teacher in Norway. This study’s first step provided us with an overview of the diverse music teacher education programs that qualify people to teach music in the compulsory schools in Norway. Five formalized educational paths were found, two of them clearly targeting the teacher profession (1, 2) and three targeting the professions of musicians or musicologists, including a practical-pedagogical study programme, 60 ECTS (PPU) (3, 4, 5).\n\nSpecialist Music Teacher Education, [no: faglærerutdanning] (BA – 3–4 years, 180/240 ECTS)\n\nGeneralist Teacher Education, [no: grunnskolelærerutdanning] (MA – 5 years, 300 ECTS in total, music: 30/60/135 ECTS)\n\nMusic Performance Education, [no: utøvende musikkutdanning] (BA – 3/4 years 180/240 ECTS) + PPU\n\nBachelor in Musicology, [no: BA i musikkvitenskap] (3 years, 180 ECTS) + PPU\n\n1-year Music course, [no: årsstudium i musikk], (60 ECTS) + PPU\n\nThe mapping work also showed that the hours spent on principal instrument teaching in these programs were quite diverse (see appendix 3 for details). This might be obvious because the programs are differently targeted, but we were surprised to find huge differences also within the same educational programs in different institutions. To give an example: if a student chooses the second path, (2) GTE and the subject Music 1 (30 ECTS), only two out of eight institutions offer principal instrument lessons. If the student adds Music 2 (30 ECTS) for further specialization, three out of eight institutions offer lessons in principal instrument. However, this is not required to teach in primary and lower secondary schools in Norway. Some institutions also offer music as the master specialization subject (MA) in the GTE program. The table below shows the different music subjects or paths in the Generalist Teacher Education program in the different institutions and the total duration of principal instrument lessons that these programs offer.\n\nTable 1 Principal instrument lessons in GTE\n\nInstitution OsloMet NTNU UiA INN USN UiS UiT HVL Subject Music 1 105 min 0 min 180 min 0 min 0 min 0 min 0 min 0 min Music 2 105 min 150 min 0 min 0 min 0 min 0 min 0 min 360 min MA 0 min 450 min Not offered Not offered Not offered Not offered Not offered 0 min\n\nIf we focus solely on the subject Music 1, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences (INN), University of South-Eastern Norway (ISN), University of Stavanger (UiS), and Western Norway University of Applied Sciences (HVL) offer zero principal instrument lessons. However, if the student is enrolled at the University of Agder (UiA), he/she will get a total of 180 minutes of lessons spread out over two semesters. Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet) also offers a total of 105 minutes of principal instrument lessons within the subject Music 1.\n\nThe differences between the education programs are also remarkable in the first path, (1) Specialist Music Teacher Education. This program qualifies people for teaching music in Norwegian primary, lower, and upper secondary schools, and are located at different institutions; both earlier conservatories/music academies (UiA, NMH, UiT) and teacher educations (INN, Nord, HiVolda, HVL). The Norwegian Academy of Music (NMH) offer the most with a total of 65.25 hours of lessons on a principal instrument per student. In comparison, The Arctic University of Norway (UiT) which also offers a specialist program in music teaching, does not include principal instrument teaching.\n\nTable 2 Principal instrument lessons in SMTE\n\nInstitution INN Nord UiA HiVolda NMH HVL UiT Path SMTE 2160 min 2160 min 2880 min 810 min 3735 min 2160 min 0 min\n\nSMTE: Specialist Music Teacher Education\n\nThe studies in music performance, musicology, and the 1-year course in music are equally diverse in the amount of lessons provided on a principal instrument, but since these types of programs are not first and foremost music teacher education, we refer readers to appendix 3 for further details.\n\nTo summarize the findings: Although many of the aforementioned education programs provide qualifications for the same music teacher professions in primary and lower secondary schools, the differences between them are evident. These differences not only relate to the different programs but also to different institutions. Which university the students choose, therefore, determines if and how many lessons they will get on their principal instrument.\n\nAnalysis of the Reflection Texts\n\nAs described, six reflection texts were gathered, three from educators in the generalist music teacher education program [no: grunnskolelærerutdanning] and three from educators in the specialist music teacher education program [no: faglærerutdanning]. The analytical work on these texts was geared towards describing the contexts and the educators’ reoccurring themes about the principal instrument. In the following sub-sections, we first employ the reflection texts to describe these two types of education programs, (i) specialist music teacher education and (ii) generalist teacher education, and then we (iii) discuss the identified themes (subject-specific, human-specific, and learning-specific aspects) in relation to the concepts techné and deep learning.\n\n(i) Specialist Music Teacher Education\n\nThree of the reflection texts (E1, E2, E3) were from teachers in specialist music teacher education programs. The descriptions of the different educations show variations in the practice fields that the educations target; e.g. Nord University targets: primary, lower and upper secondary school and UiT targets primary and lower secondary school. In E1–E3’s texts, the principal instrument seems emphasized not (only) as a main sole subject, but as a basis for other subjects, such as “music and communication” [no: musikkformidling] and “ensemble and leading” [no: samspill og ensembleledelse]. Specialized skill on one main instrument is explained in all three texts as a prerequisite to be able to play with others, perform for an audience, and conduct qualified and varied music lessons. Educator 3 describes this as follows:\n\nWithout skills on a principal instrument, I think the teacher will be poorer as a music-expert and will lack much insight into what it means to acquire a craft. These skills are transferable to other instruments and are absolutely fundamental to understanding what can be expected of a given group in specific situations. (Reflection text, E3)\n\nHere, not only the specialized expertise but also the process of gaining expertise on a main instrument are emphasized as crucial in terms of becoming aware of future pupils’ endeavors to take part in and perform music in given situations. The reflection texts from the teachers in this type of music teacher education program explain that the students learn several instruments and might change their choice of a principal instrument over the three-year educational program. Educator 2 sees this as problematic in relation to a continuous and deepening learning process:\n\nThis means that students cannot access deep learning on their instrument, which is required if you are to be able to develop and have a good and constructive process. (Reflection text, E2)\n\nAccording to this educator, the students should stick to the same principal instrument throughout their whole education to ensure they experience a long-term, ever-deepening, and continuous learning process.\n\nThe three educators from the music-specific teacher education program all describe an educational culture in which the principal instrument is regarded as a cornerstone of their programs, and where there is a broad consensus that aspiring music teachers need specialized knowledge and skills on an instrument to learn about themselves as well as about music and teaching. Teacher E6’s expressions (which has a background from both GTE and SMTE) undermines this and shows a reluctance towards E1–E3 description. E6 points to a culture where the principal instrument has not been emphasized. He explains a culture where to have competence on several instruments are seen as more important than having one dedicated principal instrument.\n\n(ii) Generalist Teacher Education\n\nEducators 4, 5, and 6 are teachers in the generalist teacher education program, which clearly targets the primary and lower secondary schools and qualifies the students to teach several subjects (for example, music and mathematics). In this program, all the students receive training in band playing and experience with band instruments, such as piano, guitar, bass and drums. This is explained by E4 and E5 as fundamental, and the band instruments are considered the most useful instruments through which to teach classroom music. E6 also points to that the relevance of a principal instrument in a classroom setting depends on which instrument the teacher or teacher student plays. The principal instrument is not emphasized in the same way as in the subject-specific music teacher education program, but the “skills to play” are highlighted as important in both E4’s and E5’s texts. E5 explains that:\n\n… the skills to play are demanded in order to function as a music teacher in compulsory schools, both to play for and with the pupils, support their learning processes, understand music from a performer’s perspective, and adjust the learning content/music according to the pupils and contexts. (Reflection text, E5)\n\nHowever, music teacher students in these two generalist teacher education programs cannot necessarily choose the principal instrument that they know from before or want to learn. E4 writes that “the students have to choose either singing, guitar or piano,” and E5 points out that the students can only choose a principal instrument that is offered by the teaching staff in the institution, and that the subject “principal instrument” occurs for the first time in the 4th year of the education program.\n\nThe principal instrument is positioned in a different way in these reflection texts than in the texts from the educators in the music-specific teacher education program. E4 and E5 describe educational cultures in which the music educators agree that the student’s skills to play and sing are fundamental, but that the instrumental training as well can happen on “useful” instruments for classroom teaching, such as guitar and piano.\n\n(iii) Principal Instrument – Art, Craft, and Deep Learning\n\nFrom the descriptions of the two types of music teacher education programs above, we now will discuss the three themes that reoccurred in the educators’ reflection texts about the role of the principal instrument. These themes relate to the use of the principal instrument for (a) subject-specific concerns, (b) human-specific concerns, and (c) learning-specific concerns. These are discussed in the following paragraphs and elaborated in relation to this chapters theoretical premises.\n\nA topic emphasized in all six reflection texts is that mastering an instrument is essential to understanding and being able to teach music. Even though the principal instrument is not the most weighted subject in the student’s timetable, the ability to play for and with others is explained as a basis for understanding music as a subject, as well as an important area of learning. One educator explained that the principal instrument is the foundation for all music disciplines, such as music communication, choir, projects, concerts, and piano accompaniment (E3). These diverse musical disciplines and activities all include communication with others, and insights around finding and taking one’s right place. For example, in a band setting, a musician’s role is different when playing the bass or a percussion instrument or singing solo. The fundamental aspects of the music (steady rhythm, correct harmonical progression, etc.) need to work in order for the melody to be revealed or to support the soloist. Experience and security playing a principal instrument are fundamental to this. Primary school music teachers have been shown as especially vulnerable in relation to security and self-confidence in this area (Hennessy, 2000; Holden & Button, 2006). From the six reflection texts in this study, the emphasis on skill with a principal instrument in the teacher education program is seen to contribute to a safe platform that reassures teachers of their musical skills. Thus, the subject-specific explanations explicitly underline handicraft knowledge as crucial. This includes not only the technical skills to play an instrument, such as the ability to play both easy and advanced music and handle difficult passages, but also the musical sensitivity to create, perform, and be affected by musical expression. Handicraft, in this sense, refers not to the superficial skills necessary to produce music, but rather the insights into oneself as a player in relation to one or several music instruments and diverse pieces or styles of music. In mirroring these explanations to the Greek concept techné (Aristotle, 2011; Heidegger, 2006), handicraft concerns both art and craft as interdependent, in a form of knowing that is essential for musical creation and communication. Exactly this type of knowing might seem a prerequisite to operationalizing the subject of music in school as described in the curriculum (The Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training, 2019). In their reflections, all the educators underline that mastering an instrument is the basis of knowledge for teaching music in school – not only for their own confidence and musical knowledge – but also to facilitate their pupils’ learning paths. Music teachers are viewed as requiring the ability to play both with and for their students, which is a basic part of their role. As E1 writes, “Without mastering an instrument, they would become ‘fake’ music teachers,” and thus this ability relates to their trustworthiness, knowledge, and responsibility as music teachers. Several of the educators point to the fact that many music teachers in primary and secondary schools in Norway have no formal music education and emphasize the importance of music teachers knowing how to play an instrument and sing. Although there were variations between the generalist teacher educators and the specialist music educators regarding their view on what instrument the students should choose (most useful in classroom or freely chosen with reference to previous music education or other preferences), all six point to the process of learning an instrument as crucial and beneficial to teaching music, regardless of the instrument.\n\nClosely interrelated with the subject-specific theme are the reoccurring explanations of skill with a principal instrument as an area that expands one’s insights in terms of identity, personality, and human relations. This concerns the students’ gradual development of a music teacher identity, as well as their abilities to understand and support the learning processes of their future pupils. Earlier studies point to a lack of confidence as a problem for primary school music teachers without specialized musical knowledge (e.g., Hennessy, 2000; de Vries, 2015). Similarly, it can be said that a lack in special competence in playing and singing contributes to a lack of perspective about the relation between the music teacher and the pupil, as well as in relation to the common references of musical works and to the characteristics of being a music teacher. Dobrowen (2020) describes being a music teacher in primary school as a “lonely professionality”, and this might be encompassed and broadened, progressing from the educators’ reflections in this study. For example, learning an instrument through long-term effort can be related to learning about people, something that is common to teachers in all subjects in school. Knowing a principal instrument is explained as important both for meeting and dealing with the various pupils and groups that music teachers encounter in school, and also for differentiating for the learners the learning content (what is meant to be played or sung) and the musical progression. To have experienced the same process as the pupils are engaged in is described by E3 as fundamental to gaining perspective on each pupil’s level, prospects, and paths. E1 states this as crucial in gaining respect from prospective pupils, as well as having respect for the handicraft and subject of music itself. Sennet (2008, p. 65) points to how the knowledge to make something exists in both the hand and the head, as well as in the heart, and warns against making a separation between “arts” and “craft,” as these are seen as two sides of the same coin. Techné-knowledge, as explained by Heidegger (2006), goes even deeper and suggests that the ability to create something is a way of knowing that is essential for humans. Learning a handicraft, as a principal instrument, is a quality-driven process, aiming for unique expression as well as good relationships – for example, in a musical context as a choir or a band. The six educators’ pinpointing of the “identity” aspects related to mastering an instrument at the advanced levels might also be deepened through Nielsen’s elaboration of the musical work and its correspondence with human consciousness on different levels (Nielsen, 1998, pp. 137–139). The innermost layers in music are here explained as existentially oriented, connected to an awareness of what it is to be a human, and what reality is or should be. Even though the principal instrument, especially in the music-specific program (ii), seems to be taught through one-to-one lessons, all six educators point out that an important aspect is the ability to play with and for others. This points to a relational understanding of music and to the notion of music as something that one does together with others. In Small’s theories about music as “musicking,” these perspectives on music are fundamental. Here, musical works and individual mastery are subordinated to the musical activities’ potential for revealing the “relationships between person and person, between individual and society, between humanity and the natural world and even perhaps the supernatural world” (Small, 1998, p. 13). From this perspective, promoting the role of the principal instrument in music teacher education could serve as a human-oriented approach that not only considers individual music teachers and their qualified abilities to perform and experience music, but also facilitates and advances musical expressions and engagements with groups and societies.\n\nMost of the educators (E1-E5) emphasize the principal instrument with regard to the process and quality of learning, whereas E6 is using more general terms; e.g. “principal instrument certainly has a value in itself”. E3 states that “there is no ‘quick fix’!” and explains how the thorough process of learning an instrument demands patience and endurance and provides insight into the gaining of knowledge that facilitates the learning processes in all school subjects. This explanation is hardly distinguishable from how deep learning is described in the educational literature, research, and curricula (e.g., Fullan et al., 2018, 2013). Deep learning is explained as “meaningful” (Ferm & Johansen, 2008) in that it involves character, self-understanding, and subject knowledge in engaging with the same learning content and learning activities over an extended time (Fullan et al., 2018). Approaches to learning that aim for deep understandings of subject knowledge, connections between subjects, and an understanding of humans, cultures, and societies are portrayed with the same thorough and passionate approach that the six educators employ in their reflections on the place of the principal instrument in music teacher education. The contradiction to deep learning is often articulated as superficial learning, which refers to how learners in today’s society can access all kinds of information rapidly, with minimal effort and engagement. However, to support more engaged, healthy, and visionary individuals, experiences with deep learning processes are seen as vital (Fullan et al., 2018; Østern et al., 2019). Three of the educators in this study warn against giving the students possibilities to constantly change their principal instrument (for example, from drums to piano), because this threatens the student’s experiences with long-time processes and deep learning. Even though classroom music teaching demands skills on different and specific instruments (e.g., piano, guitar, song), the process of “learning how to learn” (E3, E1) is best achieved on the same instrument throughout one’s whole education. From this; fundamental learning, skills on other instruments and in different musical styles can be gained more superficially, but a specialization on a principal instrument may lead to a deeper understanding of music, craftsmanship, and human relations.\n\nTogether, these three themes suggest a discussion about what kind of subject music should be, both in schools and in music teacher education programs. From the educators’ reflections in this study, discussed with reference to the concept of techné (Heidegger, 2006; Varkøy et al., 2020), deep learning (Fullan et al., 2018; Østern et al., 2019), and craftmanship (as explained by Sennet, 2008), the principal instrument can be seen to nurture many kinds of knowledge and various ways of knowing, based on the notion of music as a primarily practical and aesthetic subject. The principal instrument is seen as necessary in the development of music teachers, regarding their knowledge, skills, identity, and character, and as a unique means for learning how to learn and relate to different persons and groups.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThe research question for our study was: How is the principal instrument emphasized in music teacher educations in Norway? The mapping of the diverse music teacher education programs shows great variation in whether and how a principal instrument is prioritized in the different programs, as well as between institutions that offer the same programs. The institutional emphasis towards principal instrument instruction, reflected in the course plans and timetables of specialist music teacher education and generalist music teacher education program, varies between 0 and 3735 min. Educators E1–E5 in this study emphasize the principal instrument as crucial to (i) develop broad and deep knowledge and specialized skills in music (subject-specific), (ii) develop broad and deep knowledge to meet diverse pupils as individuals and groups, as well as insight into oneself and the development of a secure and robust music teacher identity (human-specific), and (iii) to “learn to learn” (learning-specific). Their emphasis of a principal instrument in music teacher education intersects the division between arts and crafts, and positions skill with an instrument as crucial for both music-specific knowledge and for knowledge about learning and teaching that is needed to work as and, perhaps equally important, to be a music teacher.\n\nThe content, forms, and aims in music teacher education are the topics of ongoing discussions in the international field of music education research (e.g., Angelo et al., 2021; Bowman, 2007; Kaschub et al., 2014). A central topic in these debates is the tension regarding specialists or generalists as best suited to teach music in primary and secondary schools (e.g., de Vries, 2015; Holden & Button, 2006; Wiggins & Wiggins, 2008). In these discussions, the place and weight put on learning a principal instrument are vital. Traditionally, the handicraft to play one or several music instruments has been a cornerstone of music education and in music teacher education. As mentioned in the introduction, the impact of music technology is bringing new perspectives to this view and the students may well be taught their principal instrument by their “virtual craft guild”, e.g. via YouTube. Regardless, this study reveals great variations between educational programs as well as between different institutions in terms of the time spent learning a principal instrument. A main question after this examination is: what is the time and effort spent, in music teacher education when it is not given to playing and singing? This question needs follow-up studies to be answered. Still, earlier studies on higher education in general, as well as on higher education in music, point to how the processes of academization have heavily influenced how time is spent in higher education for many vocations and professions (Angelo et al., 2019; Gies, 2019; Messel & Smeby, 2017; Wolter & Kerst, 2015). The music teacher students in GMTE, SMTE and PPU programs in this study are expected to write bachelor’s and master’s theses (or similar) and to engage in research-informed literature about music and education. This might increase future music teachers’ critical reflections on music and education and perhaps strengthen the place of music in the educational systems, but it is also a time- and effort-consuming path that might challenge the time for learning music-specific skills and mastery. Although subject-specific skills can be seen to discredit a pedagogical competence to equalize with students, and to remove the fear of failure (Lindgren & Ericsson, 2011), there are good reasons to question the lack of skills to play and sing among music teachers in schools. In 2019, around 60% of the teachers that teach music in primary and secondary schools in Norway had no formal music education (Statistisk sentralbyrå, 2019). From this study, the ability to play an instrument for and with the pupils can also be questioned with regard to the 40% of the teachers that actually have music as part of their education. According to the discussions in this chapter, the curriculum’s emphasis on deep learning and the portrayal of music as a practical subject with the power to urge creativity and experimentation can be seen as thoroughly enabled through the time and effort spent on learning a principal instrument in music teacher education programs.\n\nIn this study, learning and practicing a principal instrument is expounded as providing thorough understandings and critical insights related to the subject of music, to the essence of being human, and to the deep processes of learning through long-time study, with constant examination of the connection of previous knowledge to the learning process. In this regard, the principal instrument can be seen as occupying a valuable place in music teacher education programs that combine arts, crafts, and deep learning. Thus, it can provide future music teachers with the artistic sensitivity to better grasp diverse expressions, and, intertwined with their technical knowledge, the enhanced skill to make and form unique expressions. Indeed, without this ability, words such as creating, experimenting, and exploring might seem unqualified, empty, and utopian.\n\nThe students referred to at the beginning of this chapter discussed whether specialized or generalized musical knowledge was most important in becoming a school music teacher. This spurred our curiosity and demanded a deeper discussion about what content and activities are seen, and should be seen, as central in music teacher education. Through explicating the potentials of techné, arts, and crafts in relation to deep learning processes, this study gives music teachers and music teacher educators a perspective for viewing the specialization on a main instrument as general education, with processes that provide insights on learning how to learn. This also intersects the division found in music education research between supporting students’ general growth and well-being and developing their music-specific knowledge and skills. Instead of discussing the craftsmanship that disappeared, this provides us with a perspective to argue for the craftsmanship to reappear in music teacher education that qualifies people to teach music as one or several subjects in school.\n\nReferences\n\nAngelo, E., Varkøy, Ø., & Georgii-Hemming, E.
