The remainder of the papers are published in a special double issue of the Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development and in Volume Four of the Copenhagen Studies in Bilingualism. The Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development contains papers dealing with two sub-themes of the conference which have particular relevance in the Scandinavian context. One is the schools' relationship to bilingualism, discussed on the national level. The other group of papers in that volume deals with learning and development processes going on in the individual. Volume Four of the Copenhagen Studies comprises the papers on bilingualism and the individual speaker. There are papers on interactional analysis, on linguistic structure and variation in bilinguals, on different backgrounds and second language learning. The volume also indicates the papers on bilingualism and literature (fiction). Some of the exhibits from the conference shows and exhibitions are used to illustrate the Copenhagen Studies in Bilingualism volumes. The artists are Milton Blanch, Mario di Lucci, and Ilona Ösz. At this time we as organisers wish to express our gratitude to: ¾ our co-organisers, especially Marie Hald and Inger Nørgaard, our colleague Bent Søndergaard of the Pedagogische Hochschule Flensburg, and, from our own institution, Gerd Gabrielsen, Erik Larsen, Jørn Lund and Marie-Alice Séférian; ¾ the participants in the conference; ¾ the publishers of the proceedings of the conference (not least for kindly agreeing to go against the house policy of not accepting manuscripts that are written in languages other than English). It was one of the provisions of the conference, however, that all papers submitted before the deadline were to be published with the proceedings; ¾ UFE's Jette Reentz-Petersen, Ulla Varming, Kirsten Schalburg and Irene Hansen, the organisers of the workshop for teachers; ¾ and our sponsors: King Frederik and Queen Ingrid's Foundation, Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik's Foundation, The TUBORG Foundation,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iv\n\nnext page > Page iv\n\nKnud Højgaard's Foundation, Rosalie Petersen's Foundation, Julius Skrike's Foundation, SAS Travel Grants, The Rockwool Foundation, The Foundation for Danish-Swedish Co-operation, The Cultural Foundation for Denmark and Finland, Denmark's Teachers' Union, The Danish Masons, The Letterstedt Society, The Ministry of Education, The City of Copenhagen, The County of Copenhagen, The Research Council for the Humanities, The Greenland Foundation of the Danish Parliament, The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies Emdrup, November 1987 NORMANN JøRGENSEN, ELISABETH HANSEN, ANNE HOLMEN, JøRGEN GIMBEL\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iv\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_v\n\nnext page > Page v\n\nIntroductory Note J. Normann Jørgensen, Elisabeth Hansen, Anne Holmen And Jørgen Gimbel Department of Danish Language and Literature, The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies, 101 Emdrupborg, DK-2400 Copenhagen NV, Denmark The Fifth Nordic Conference on Bilingualism was held at the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies at Copenhagen, 22-25 June, 1987. The main theme of the conference was Two Languages and Two Cultures in Education. This theme was dealt with in many ways by the contributions offered during the conference, and no less in the more than 1,300 pages of manuscripts turned in for publication in the proceedings. Many of the papers, however, deal with certain aspects of bilingualism currently attracting interest from many students of the discipline. These aspects include, on the macro-level, the planning of language education in multilingual societies; on the micro-level, second language learning strategies; on the linguistic level, analyses of interactional data involving bilinguals; and, on the cultural level, bilingual writers. As our editorial principle we have chosen to group the papers according to their relation to the main theme of the conference. The papers in this volume deal mainly with bilingualism at the supra-individual levels, i.e. group, institution, society, etc. The papers discuss such fields as language planning, status differences between languages, the schools' role in bilingual societies and, most notably, the importance of the schools in promoting minority languages. Pyee-Cohen's paper is devoted to this very issue. She presents a comparison between three quite different Canadian school systems, and evaluates their role in the maintenance of individual and societal bilingualism. Hoffman, in her paper, describes the development of the status of Catalan in Catalonia over the past century. She explains its present status as a result of political and social development. Nevertheless, in her judgement the schools are highly important for the maintenance of the status of Catalan. It is, of course, important to educators worldwide whether the schools are central or peripheral vehicles for societal linguistic development. As far as the factors can be distinguished from each other, the non-educational factors of\n\n< previous page\n\npage_v\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vi\n\nnext page > Page vi\n\npolitics, economy, social status, etc. may or may not have a greater direct impact on the maintenance or decline of minority languages than education has. Lucas & Nercissians, maintaining that language planning has attracted only little interest from political scientists, present a game-theoretical model covering also the involvement of different institutions with possibly conflicting goals. This could be a rewarding approach to several problems, e.g. the explanation of how certain languages survive in spite of sometimes determined attempts to annihilate them. This volume is not without its descriptions of attempts to weaken languages by means of the educational system. Timm's account of the French government's handling of Breton is a prime example. In this case the minority language has managed to survive, and it now has certain modest hopes for the future, not the least because the educational system has in fact recognised the minority tongue. The opposite is the case for Malecite, a language now (in young speakers) heavily influenced at all linguistic levels by English, as described in Szabó's paper. He illustrates his point with examples from three Malecite speakers of different generations, the youngest being able to speak Malecite only with considerable English influence. C. Lauren presents a model of language planning based on the following three dichotomies for structuring speech communities: majority language versus minority language, so-called 'outside standard language' versus indigenous standard language, and 'official implementation' versus 'non-official implementation'. Saleem discusses the relationship between Faroese and Danish in the Faroe Islands. A millenium-old oral tradition has ensured the survival of the Faroese language in spite of the schools' being monolingually Danish. The creation of a Faroese orthography further strengthened Faroese. Today the language is the medium of instruction in Faroese schools, and Danish is the first foreign language. Henriksen shares his subject, and to a certain extent also his attitude, with Saleem. He describes the factors which characterise the development of the status of the Faroese language over the past hundred years. His paper is a detailed historical account of language politics and language policies in the Faroe Islands. Gerbault describes how a similar process is taking place now in the Central African Republic. Sango, today an undisputed lingua franca and national language, is on the rise - at least numerically, but perhaps also in status at the cost of French, but mainly at the cost of a number of other African languages. French is the language of the administration - and the schools. The status of Sango, however, has reached a point where its introduction as a medium of instruction is under consideration. Gerbault discusses the problems\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vi\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vii\n\nnext page > Page vii\n\nin this, partly against the background of an extensive questionnaire investigation among Sango speakers in Bangui. The historical and political factors are important in Nercissians' paper about the Armenian minority in Iran. She discusses the relationship between the Armenian language and Farsi in a model of role distribution among languages. This model takes into account not only the status dimension, i.e. the force of the 'stronger' language, but also the 'solidarity dimension', i.e. the force of the 'weaker' language. Several papers directly discuss the role of schools in bilingual societies. Møller describes the problems of promoting (Western) Greenlandic in Greenland related to a shortage of teachers and materials in that language. The Danish language is still an important, and to some, a burdensome factor in the daily activities of Greenland's schools. Møller furthermore specifically deals with the problems of the so-called 'third group', i.e. the children of mixed marriages. Ulrich's paper deals with the same situation, and presents some very practical aspects of the problems. The French language in Canada, however, is an altogether different matter, and the contrast between, on the one hand, the situation described by Møller and Ulrich, and, on the other hand, the one described by de Vries and Mougeon & Beniak, is striking. In the case of Canada the effects of teaching the majority through the minority language are discussed. Mougeon & Beniak question the wisdom, as seen from the point of view of the Francophone population, of admitting Anglo-Saxon children into French-medium schools designed for the Francophones. They hypothesise that too large a proportion of English speakers may turn out to be a threat to the daily use, and the quality, of French in the schools, and therefore in the long run to the Francophone population. De Vries, on the other hand, presents the results of an investigation of the use and perceived usefulness of French among Anglo-Saxon graduates of immersion schools. He finds that French is indeed used a lot by former students, thereby in fact contradicting the fears of Mougeon & Beniak. Most of the languages mentioned so far have been so-called indigenous minority languages (Breton, Catalan, Sango, Malecite), some of which are in fact majority languages (Faroese, Western Greenlandic). This is the area in which language planning has been discussed longest, but the issue is also becoming more urgent in industrialised Europe, with its new immigrants speaking a multitude of languages hitherto unknown in that part of the world. Both Andenæs and Källström look at the languages of immigrants in Scandinavia. Andenæs describes the Norwegian scene, discussing the role of the schools, and of linguists, in this connection. Källström presents two investigations that have tried to determine the chances of the minority languages' survival in Sweden, Boyd's (1985) study, and one from Källström's\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_viii\n\nnext page > Page viii\n\nown SPRINS project. He discusses the surprisingly different conclusions reached by these projects. The difference in conclusions may be explained by the different material used by the two projects, most notably the informants. Brunell also deals with a Scandinavian language, but as a minority tongue, namely (standard) Swedish in Finland. He describes its role in Finnish schools. A further group of papers deals with bilingualism as a group phenomenon (i.e. at a sub-societal, but supra-individual level). Both Northover and Hermann discuss the importance of certain group factors, language and attitude, for the identity of the individual minority member. Hawkesworth takes us into the classroom and shows us how these factors influence everyday life in the multilingual classroom. Knubb-Manninen takes a different, but nonetheless salient, approach to cultural differences and second language classrooms. She describes the importance of gender and social status group differences. These factors have different effects on second language learning, not unlike that which we find for different ethnic groups. Some of the papers focus on children younger than school age. This is the case of Olesen's paper, which presents the pedagogical work done in the Danish Refugee Aid as an offer to refugee children under school age. Chylinski's contribution also deals with refugee children, who attend day-care institutions at a younger age and after a shorter stay in the host country than do children of migrant workers. Chylinski discusses the ways and means of bilingual socialisation in such institutions. Kragh presents a bilingual project in a daycare institution for pre-school children in Århus. He describes the elements of this project, which is centred on Danish and Turkish. Stockfelt-Hoatson gives an overview of current Swedish pedagogical development projects involving immigrant and refugee children, aiming at improving the day-care institutions to meet the needs of linguistic minority children. Her perspective is national, but at the same time very practical, and therefore has general interest. The final group of papers at long last brings us to the discussion of teaching practice. Glebe-Møller criticises, in particular, the Danish adult language-teaching system for being insensitive to the background of third world learners of Danish. Pinholt & Sand, on the other hand, describe how the language teaching at the Danish Refugee Aid tries to takes the characteristics of the learners into consideration. In both cases the question of activationand how the teacher and the school handle the immediate motivation of the beginneris highly important. Kragesteen & Skovbjerg discuss the right time for the introduction of the Danish language in Faroese schools. They describe three different so-called 'teacher profiles' which determine the attitude of the children. Again, the question of motivation is important, not least because the political aspects of the problem may very well be the strongest.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_viii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_ix\n\nnext page > Page ix\n\nTomasevic discusses several aspects of the practice of so-called 'home language' teaching in Sweden, emphasising the linguistic ones. He illustrates his description of the development of Swedish practice with Serbo-Croatian home language teaching. He furthermore presents some results from the JUBA project in Lund. He stresses the need for individualised teaching, the students being so different in background, length of stay, first languge competence, etc. The final paper is Varming's account of the workshop arranged by the Danish organisation of teachers of linguistic minority students (UFE). Different opinions and attitudes were presented during the workshop, but there seemed to be almost unanimous agreement on the need for bilingual school personnel, on the introduction of minority languages into school curricula, and on bicultural approaches to teaching practice. This is, in fact, the best conference conclusion the organisers could hope for.

Abstract. In many modern societies, the language problem has become one of the most important social and political questions. The increased importance of communication, the interrelation between language and identity, the reflection of social structure in language structure, and the role of language in nation-building and state-building are among the factors giving language a central role in contemporary social and cultural processes. However, although language planning has been recognised by scholars as a separate field of specialisation drawing upon the results obtained in sociology and linguistics, it has so far attracted the attention of few political scientists. The language-planning literature has mainly studied the attempts by governments to change a language and its functions for some specific purpose. The purpose of this paper is to invite attention to the modelling of conflicts in language planning due to the involvement of several institutions, existence of different goals, and multiplicity of underlying processes, especially in bilingual settings. Game theory has been used as a tool for analysing different language-planning problems and modelling different situations of conflict. It is shown that since in most cases of interest the decision-makers have common interests, several social dilemmas can be explained by simple gametheoretical models. Introduction The importance of language in all human societies, and particularly in modern societies, has been recognised for a long time. Language plays such a central role in human life that no branch of social sciences can afford to ignore it. In recent times, the advent of modern sociolinguistics has facilitated the study of language from a broader, multidisciplinary point of view. The\n\n< previous page\n\npage_1\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page > Page 2\n\nmethodologies and theoretical results obtained and used in the fields of sociology, psychology, anthropology, etc., have been applied in the linguistic field with great success. One of the aspects of this is the concept of human control over linguistic change. This control is of interest because language is so closely related to several important factors of our individual and social lives. For example, language has been the basic tool for communication in all historical and contemporary societies and no social scientist can analsye the communication problem without using the results obtained by modern sociolinguistic theory. The role of language in the nation-building process has long been recognised by historians and sociologists (Fishman, 1972; Weinstein, 1979; Gellner, 1983; Grillo, 1980). The different schools of psychology agree on the centrality of language in the identity formation process (Mead, 1962; Lacan, 1968; Tajfel, 1982). It is even conjectured that language can condition our thoughts (Miller & Johnson-Laird, 1976). By controlling language change one can at the same time influence all these associated variables. It follows that the interest in language planning can stem from several different considerations. The term 'language planning' has been used here to mean any decision-making process the aim of which is to influence the structure or the usage of a language or a number of languages (or language varieties). So far, language planning has been established as a subbranch of the sociology of language. However, very little attention has been paid to the scientific modelling of conflict in the language-planning process. Language planning is an act involving different social interests and so it usually cannot be conceived free from any conflicts. An obvious example is provided by bilingual communities, with each linguistic group trying to promote its own language. Conflict can also arise from the fact that language influences various social and psychological variables in different ways. For example, it has been argued that a language-planning strategy may have contradictory effects from the viewpoints of status and solidarity (Lucas & Nercissians, 1986). Thus a solidarity-stressing language-planning strategy may be in conflict with a status-enhancing strategy. More generally, language planning may be carried out for different goals, such as language purification, language reform, language revival, language standardisation, and policies designed to achieve one of these goals usually also affect the other goals. For instance, language standardisation programmes also involve some language purification and language reform (Bourhis, 1984). More importantly, language planning is usually not as simple as the conscious and sustained effort by a government to change the structure or functions of a language that has so far been discussed in the language-planning literature (see, e.g. Weinstein, 1983; Fishman, 1974). In most cases language planning involves several institutions whose strategies are unco-ordinated and contradictory (Nercissians & Lucas, 1986). Even within a government, the language policies pursued by the legislative, executive and judiciary branches, by the\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page > Page 3\n\ndifferent ministries and organs or by the federal (or national) and regional levels of administration are often in conflict, and if we also include the civic society, and the pressure groups, then it is difficult to see how a language policy can be designed and implemented without any conflict. The mathematical tool for modelling decision-making processes in the presence of conflicts is game theory. In recent years, this theory has been applied in a number of works to language-planning problems (e.g. Nercissians & Lucas, 1986; Lucas & Nercissians, 1986, 1987; Eastman & Laitin, 1986; Laitin & Sole, 1986). However, these works have presented only some very simple models of language-planning situations. It is the purpose of this paper to invite the attention of researchers to the necessity for modelling conflicts in language planning by applying game theory. In the next section, several game-theoretical models that have been presented in previous literature will be discussed, and in the concluding section, some theoretical questions associated with the game-theoretical approach to language planning will be examined. Building Models As the first example, let us consider the conflict between the majority and minority groups in determining the language to be used at a regional level. Let us assume that the minority group, which speaks a different language, is concentrated in a region of the country, and the majority group controls the government and can decide the language of regional administration. The minority group can decide whether to learn and switch to the majority language or continue to use its own language. If we show the majority and minority languages by LM and Lm respectively, then the language-planning game discussed above can be represented in its normal form by the model shown in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_4\n\nnext page > Page 4\n\nThe majority preferences are O4>O3>O2>O1>. For the minority group, however, the dilemma is whether to press for the preservation of the regional language or to learn the language of the centre as useful cultural capital. Depending on the relative weight of these two considerations their preferences will vary. If their main concern is to ensure the preservation of their regional language in local administrative matters, then their preferences will be O1>O2>O4>O3. However, if learning the language of the centre is associated with sociopolitical and economic success then these preferences will become O4>O2>O1>O3. The second case is less interesting, for there is almost no conflict and the outcome O4 has the maximum utility for both parties. But even in the first case, O4 is the equilibrium point and, although the minority would prefer the use of its own language, it has other choices than to settle for O4. The majority group has the advantage of having a dominant strategy. The minority, however, does not have a dominant strategy (not to learn LM), because if LM is the language of regional administration, it prefers to learn it (therefore, O4>O3). This preference is especially strong among the minority élites, who are influential in making language strategy decisions, and know that by knowing LM they can become their group's leaders by assuming middlemen's role between the state and their group. (Their preferences can be represented as O2>O1> O4>O3 and here again, there is a dominant strategy which is to learn LM.) Even if the majority group, while still trying to promote their own language, realise that this can be done better by encouraging the minority élites to learn it rather than by enforcing it through its use as the administrative code of the region, and change their preferences to O4>O2>O3>O1, this will not change the fact that the use of their language for regional adminsitration is their dominant strategy, and O4 is still the equilibrium point of the game. The above model, presented by Laitin & Sole (1986), aims to demonstrate the robustness of the final outcome with respect to different assumptions. In the authors' view, the final outcome, O4, i.e. the minority's switch to the majority language, which is used as the administrative code in both regional and national levels, is a sort of 'rationalisation' in Max Weber's sense, which they call 'linguistic rationalisation'. As long as refusing to learn the majority language constitutes a dominant strategy for the minority, the majority can always assure that O4 is the final outcome. This explains why the formations of modern nation-states are often associated with the suppression of minority and regional languages. In their next model, Laitin & Sole show why it is so difficult for the individual minority members to organise an effective linguistic resistance strategy. Every individual must decide whether to use Lm or to learn and switch to LM. If they collectively refuse to accommodate to the language of\n\n< previous page\n\npage_4\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nnext page > Page 5\n\nthe majority, they can resist assimilation. But each party will be tempted to learn the majority language in order to secure a decent job for himself and social mobility for his children. The game can be represented by the model in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2 A's preferences can be shown as O3>O1>O4>O2. (Learning the majority language when other members of his group do not know it involves socioeconomic advantages, but he also has a collective interest in organising linguistic resistance.) Similarly, B's preferences can be shown as O2>O1>O4>O3. This is a classical example of the situation called the prisoner's dilemma by game theorists. O4 is the equilibrium outcome of the game. Moreover, learning Lm is not only the maximum strategy, but also the dominant strategy. But it can be seen that O4 is not the optimal strategy in Pareto's sense and both decision-makers prefer O1 to O4 (Luce & Raiffa, 1957). When considered together, the above examples explain why, as a result of modern state building, and political and economic 'rationalisation', the linguistic minorities will eventually have to switch to the majority language. However, if the 'linguistic rationalisation' with its implied one nationone language formula could be considered a historical necessity in the context of nineteenth century Western Europe, language standardisation in favour of official bilingualism has also emerged as a partial solution to language problems in several contemporary states. Even in the case of older Western European states, Switzerland provides a classic example of the successful implementation of such linguistic policies. Two types of official multilingualism have been distinguished. In the territorial approach the indigenous language of each region becomes the official language in that region, while in the personality approach the state must accommodate the lingusitic preferences of individuals and provide its public services in two or more official languages. Thus nationalistic and pluralistic approaches are two distinct policy options between which the majority and the minority groups can choose. If each group can\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nnext page > Page 6\n\npromote the use of its own language by choosing a more nationalistic policy, then the language-planning games can be shown by the model in Figure 3 (Nercissians & Lucas, 1986).\n\nFigure 3 In both O1 and O4 we have a state of bilingualism as the outcome. In O1 the bilingualism is of a subtractive type, since each language is being promoted at the expense of the other, while the bilingualism of O2 is of an additive type and is preferable to O1 from the point of view of both groups. Otherwise the majority prefers O1 to O3 and O2 to O4 and the minority prefers O1 to O2 and O3 to O4. The language-planning game described above is another example of the application of the prisoner's dilemma. It explains why a mechanism for promoting co-operation may be necessary for achieving optimality. The Canadian setting provides a good example of this, as can be seen from the Annual Report of the Commissioner of Official Languages (1985). The next example considers the possibility of using another code by two or more communities speaking different languages, in order to resolve their communication problem. Here, the choice for each community is whether to continue using its own language or to switch to a common code. The obvious examples of this model are the newly independent third-world countries, composed of two or more nationalities, none of which is the dominant majority group or pluridialectal settings. The common code might be the standard language, a lingua franca, or the colonial language. The game can be represented by the model in Figure 4. Again, O4 is the optimal outcome. But O1 is the equilibrium point and in the absence of a mechanism (like the colonial experience) promoting the common code the cost of switching to LC may prove too high. In the previous three examples the nature of the dilemma was always the same. The equilibrium of the game is not the optimal outcome. Therefore, there is a need for a co-operation-promoting mechanism in order to achieve optimality. However, this is by no means the only possible dilemma which\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nnext page > Page 7\n\nFigure 4 can be explained by game theory. If, in the above example, we exclude the possibility of switching to a different language, but consider the possibility of resolving the communication problem by learning (and eventually switching to) the other nationality's language, then the game can be represented as in Figure 5. Clearly, O1 is the most preferred outcome for nationality A, and O4 is the preferred outcome for nationality B. If we additionally assume that the gain obtained from resolving the communication problem is higher than the cost of accommodating to the language of the other nationality, then nationality A will prefer O4 to O2 and nationality B will prefer O1 to O3. Here, the dilemma stems from the fact that we have not one, but two equilibria. The situation is problematic because it is not clear which group will have to accommodate to the other group's language. If we further assume that the two groups cannot communicate before choosing and implementing their strategies, then the game will be even more complex. Not only may both groups decide not to accommodate, but also each group may decide to go for the second best outcome, assuming that the other group will not accommodate, so that the final outcome is O3, which is sub-optimal. Finally, if we assume that both switching to the other nationality's language, and a third common language are possible, the game can be represented as in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 5\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nnext page > Page 8\n\nFigure 6 Here we have both dilemmas. It is not clear which outcome should be selected and how to guarantee optimality. The eventual outcome will be determined by pre-game conditions and the mechanisms designed to promote co-operation in order to achieve Pareto optimality. Conclusion The models described in the previous section are representative of the present state of the application of game theory. It can be seen that the models are very simplistic and hardly reflect the real complexities of language planning. However, even in these simple models we can see several of the essential problems involved in typical language-planning situations. Also, the models so far discussed in the literature are all descriptive and no attempt has been made to use game theory normatively. This reflects in part the strength as well as the shortcomings of game theory itself, and in part the preliminary stage of applying this theory to language planning and the lack of maturity of this area of investigation. At this stage, it would not be improper to be pessimistic about the potential for the normative application of game theory to language planning in the near future. It is safer to expect that in the future more complex and more powerful descriptive models will be presented for analysing particular, rather than general, language situations. The models described in this paper also demonstrate where game theory can be expected to help in analysing language-planning situations and what the prospects for its application in the near future are. Most of the interesting cases can be modelled as games that are non-zero-sum. It is well known that some of the main properties of the zero-sum games such as the existence, uniqueness and optimality of an equilibrium do not extend to the case of non-zero-sum games. An equilibrium may not exist. Even if it\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nnext page > Page 9\n\ndoes, it may not be unique and there is no guarantee that it will be optimal. Even the concept of solution and solvability does not have one single definition (Luce & Raiffa, 1957). This allows us to use game theory in order to explain and categorise some of the observable dilemmas in language planning. Many social dilemmas stem from the fact that the equilibrium outcome is not optimal in the sense of Pareto. The prisoner's dilemma type models discussed here provide examples of this kind. In these cases the factors promoting co-operation for achieving optimality are of importance. One such factor is time. Models of repeated games have been analysed by Lucas & Nercissians (1986), and conditions under which optimality will be achieved in the dynamic case have been discussed. Another type of dilemma, based on the non-uniqueness of the equilibria, has also been examined in Lucas & Nercissians (1987) and in this paper. The solvability of the game becomes problematic if the equilibria are not interchangeable and equivalent. The prisoner's dilemma is at least solvable in Nash's sense, although it is not solvable in the strict sense (because there does not exist an equilibrium among the jointly admissible strategy pairs; see, e.g. Luce & Raiffa, 1957). But the last two models discussed in the previous section are not solvable because the equilibria, and even those among the jointly admissible strategy pairs, are not interchangeable; and neither are they equivalent. Again, some of the properties of non-zero-sum games like the power of disclosing one's strategy and the value of pre-game communication and information about the other decision-makers' strategy choices, which unlike the case of the zero-sum games are not a matter of indifference, become of importance. One is often forced into such questions as the bargaining psychologies of the decision-makers, interpersonal comparisons of utility, etc. In future, it can be expected that the rich game-theoretic literature will be utilised for the cases where pre-play messages can be transmitted, binding agreements can be concluded, and utilities are transferable and side payments are possible. Concepts like solutions, cores and stability will then be applied in analysing language-planning problems. Also, the concept of mixed strategies, which has been discussed by Lucas & Nercissians (1987), will probably be used and its interpretation can be expected to be a subject of discussion in future applications. Finally, our discussion would be incomplete without a brief mention of some of the limitations of the application of game theory, which have become apparent even at this early stage of its application. Firstly, there are important extra-theoretical psychological and sociological considerations without which the purely technical discussion and game-theoretical modelling would be incomplete and not very useful. In addition, the modelling of utility, which has been altogether avoided in this paper, is very problematic. The assumption that the preferences of the decision-makers are independent\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_10\n\nnext page > Page 10\n\nof their strategy choices may be untrue, the decision-makers may not behave in a 'rational' manner, etc. A general discussion of these limitations can be found in the literature (e.g. Luce & Raiffa, 1957). One of the most important problems here is the consideration of all the possible strategy choices. Misleading results may result from the omission of some of the possibilities. For example it was shown that when the possibility of bilingual strategies was not considered, a robust model justifying assimilation was obtained (see Lucas & Nercissians, 1987 for elaboration). Thus it should always be remembered that the theoretical approach of the game-theoretical model should not overshadow its sociological content. This should be considered by future theorists who are going to build more complex and elaborate game-theoretical models. Game theory is only a mathematical tool and its successful application is only possible when it is based on a sound underlying social theory. References Bourhis, R.Y.

Abstract. The field of language planning to be discussed is mainly what has been called implementation and elaboration. The starting point is the situation of speech communities like the Finland Swedes, who use a language which could be characterised as a minority language with an outside standard. A model is proposed for predicting attitudes and measures taken in the field of language planning. An important dichotomy used is majority language-minority language. It is proposed that this dichotomy is also crucial in situations not bounded by political borders. Language planning is also influenced by the international status of the language. Therefore, the model is applicable on national, regional and international levels. The field of language planning to be discussed here closely corresponds to Swedish 'språkvård', Norwegian 'språkrøkt' and German 'Sprachpflege'. These terms could be translated as 'language cultivation', as Neustupny (1978) does. This term is not, however, as satisfactory in English as its equivalents in other languages. In his model of language planning, Haugen (1983) regards the concept of cultivation merely as the process of implementation and elaboration, these concepts being defined as follows: Implementation includes the activity of a writer, an institution, a government in adopting and attempting to spread the language form that has been selected and codified. (Haugen, 1983:272) and Elaboration is in many ways simply the continued implementation\n\n< previous page\n\npage_11\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_12\n\nnext page > Page 12\n\nof a norm to meet the functions of a modern world. (Haugen, 1983:273) Finland-Swedish language planning is in many ways influenced by the fact that Finland is a bilingual society. We have two official languages with a long history of geographical and political co-existence. This, of course, very strongly influences attitudes and measures taken in the field of language implementation and language elaboration. The behaviour which I am interested in is typically the behaviour of communities in developed countries. There are different problems in developing countries, where attention may be focussed on selection and codification, the two other central concepts of Haugen's model. According to Haugen (1983:274) himself, his model provides a description of what language planners have done, but it does not tell us why they have done it, nor what goals they have hoped to attain. My model is connected with Haugen's model through its concern with implementation and elaboration of function. My model has, however, another aim. It tries to understand why language planners, or perhaps in this case language cultivators, of different speech communities behave differently. Hence, it may also be called a hypothesis. The processes indicated by Haugen's model are not realised in my model. It is possible at least to hypothesize causes behind the differences of language-planning processes suggested by Haugen. This is what I shall be concerned with below, i.e., I will suggest some reasons behind differences in strategy in the fields of language implementation and language elaboration. My starting point is that there are real reasons behind the differences in strategy. There is normally nothing odd or ridiculous in the fact that one speech community behaves differently from another. The reasons may simply be complex. The concept systems of linguistics as well as those of sociology may not suffice to explain the reasons for the differences in question. One way of discovering these could be to study the language-planning traditions of different speech communities in order to define the underlying common characteristics of communities with common attitudes and behaviour with regard to implementation and elaboration. Against this background I want to suggest three dichotomies for structuring speech communities according to attitudes and measures in the fields of implementation and elaboration: majority language-minority language; outside standard languageindigenous standard language; officially directed implementation and elaboration-non-officially directed implementation and elaboration. With these three dichotomies speech communities can be classified into eight categories in a figure with three dimensions as in Figure 1. The dichotomies are extra-linguistic and my claim is that they predict the\n\n< previous page\n\npage_12\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_13\n\nnext page > Page 13\n\nFigure 1 guidelines of implementation and elaboration in a speech community. These guidelines concern, for example, regionalisms, loan translations, loan-words, neologisms, terminology and pronunciation. Of course, other variables could be added and as a result we would have a more complex figure, one with more than eight categories of languages. In order to discover general tendencies we have, however, to simplify the situation. Still, it is not my intention to give lists of possible variables. A linguistic criterion which nonetheless could be mentioned is the degree of linguistic distance between two languages in contact with each other. Considerable linguistic distance can make interference in some fields impossible (cf. Swedish and Finnish in Finland), linguistic closeness can cause problems because, for instance, interference on the semantic level may be hard to discover (cf. French and English in North America). Below I will comment upon the eight classes of my figure. (1) Majority languages with standards of their own. Swedish of Sweden, French of France and Italian of Italy are examples of speech communities belonging to this group. It has not always been evident that the languages of these communities could meet all possible demands. Therefore these speech\n\n< previous page\n\npage_13\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nnext page > Page 14\n\ncommunities are at least to some extent interested in developing vocabulary by using resources of their own. (2) Minority languages with standards of their own. For instance, New Norse in Norway and the Gaelic of Ireland are minority languages with standards of their own. Speech communities belonging to this group are linguistically under strong pressure from the majority language of the same country and therefore they make a great effort to maintain their linguistic identity. (3) Majority languages with outside standards. This group may be exemplified by the German of Switzerland and the German of Austria. There are practical reasons why these speech communities try to keep the standard variety of their language close to that of the society which determines its development. There would, of course, be no risk involved if the speech communities in question were inclined to support a different development of their language. In time, however, they would no longer possess a language which it would be possible to use outside the political borders of the country in question. A speech community of this type has in any case a safe existence, which usually cannot be threatened by another speech community as in case 2. (4) Minority languages with outside standards. Examples of this group are Swedish in Finland and French in Canada (cf. a comparison of these given in Laurén, 1983). These are speech communities under strong pressure from a majority language as in case 2. They try to keep their language variety close to that of the main area of the language because of the support this gives them in their minority situation. This possibility of support is a remarkable advantage to these communities when comparing them with those of case 2. Behaviour which may be good for a community of category 2 may perhaps not be good in this case. I cannot agree with Haugen (1983: 286) when he advocates Norwegian behaviour for Finland Swedes concerning language. With categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 we have covered the speech communities with officially directed implementation and elaboration. Responsibility for such direction devolves on academies, language councils, meetings or other governmental or nongovernmental bodies authorised for their tasks in some way. Two West-European extremes in the field of implementation and elaboration are French and English. English is often mentioned as an example of a language used by a speech community with a remarkably liberal attitude with regard to language. At least in some respects this view is superficial. Of course, there is no English academy but there are traditions embodied in dictionaries and maintained in other ways, too. Well established norms exist but because they often are not of the same type as those of, for example, French, there is seldom any discussion of these norms. A hypothesis I want to propose is that a language with officially directed implementation and elaboration socially\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nnext page > Page 15\n\noften has a more accessible standard variety than English. The lack of officially directed activities may lead to a situation where the pattern of the standard variety is very complicated, with relatively many rules existing only implicitly. English is in many ways exceptional in the context of my model but one should not draw any conclusions about the availability of a standard English for its users compared with other languages. My model concerns only differences of attitudes and measures. The next case is, of course, close to case 1: (5) Majority languages with standards of their own. This is the case with the English of Great Britain and that of the U.S.A. English has a strong position internationally. Because of the mixture of Germanic and Romance elements, it is not possible to maintain puristic language planning. Structurally the language can accept a great deal of influence from outside. One could possibly compare the situation with that of Latin in Western Europe until the time when efforts were made to return to Ciceronian Latin. (6) Minority languages with standards of their own. As examples of this category we may mention Sardinian, Rhaeto-Romanic, the Gaelic of Scotland. These are languages which, using a term employed in Bossong (1980), are in a recessive cycle if WestEuropean. If there is no officially directed activity in our field and no support from another speech community, it must be difficult for a language to exist in a modern society. The modernisation of Rhaeto-Romanic society has recently called for activities directed towards the development of a standard language; otherwise there will not be one single standard for the language. (7) Majority languages with outside standard. This is a variety of the English model existing in many countries outside the U.S.A. and Great Britain, for example in New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Because of English traditions, there do not usually exist officially directed activities in our field. Typically, there is a strong dependence on either the English variety of Great Britain or that of the U.S.A. There are problems of regionalisms but they are not often discussed. (8) Minority languages with outside standard. A speech community which could be mentioned is the Basque community of France, which quantitatively is weaker than the Basque-speaking community of Spain. Another is the Catalan community of France, which has a similar status. 1. From the point of view of bilingualismand from my personal point of viewthe case of minority languages with an outside standard is the most interesting one. One way of describing the characteristics of the language planning of these speech communities is to do it by means of contrast. The German of Austria is the language of a majority population even if the standard\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_16\n\nnext page > Page 16\n\nlanguage is mainly developed in Germany. The majority situation gives the German of Austria a basis for independent language planning. The Austrians can afford themselves all literature in special fields of knowledge if they want to. They will, however, derive great advantage from their language situation if in the future they are also able to communicate in German with other German-speaking areas of the world. One could mention as some signs of a greater independence in language-planning matters the fact that Austrians generally use 'Jänner' and 'Fäber' for standard German 'Januar' and 'Februar', and Österreichisches Wörterbuch (35th edn, 1979), a very authoritative source, presents Austrian regionalisms without any marking. Words like 'Standel', 'Budel', 'beiläufig', 'brocken', 'Dachtel', 'Beutler', 'einhakeln', 'gar sein', 'derweil', 'warschelnass', 'verschwitzen' and 'gelungen' (= 'originell') are included; these are either unknown by Germans in Germany or have a special meaning in Austria. I am aware of the fact that the dictionary has been criticised because of this tendency; the dictionary has, however, been compiled by a very competent and well established team of Austrian scholars. Regionalisms can as a rule never have an opportunity to be included in this way in dictionaries with official or semi-official status in speech communities where the language is a minority language. 2. It is, however, interesting to see that my model is applicable also to situations not bounded by political borders. A speech community can feel its language threatened in a larger context. In the middle and at the end of the nineteenth century this must have been a correct description of Finnish and the Finnish speech community. A great deal of work was done to coin new words for use instead of the mass of Swedish and other Germanic or Indo-European loan words: e.g. 'shäkö' for 'elektrisiteetti', 'otsikko' for 'rubriikki', 'ongelma' for 'probleema', 'mittakaava' for 'skaala', 'kyljys' for 'kotletti' and 'arvovalta' for 'auktoriteetti'. In the 1980s the Norwegians already had and still have many terminological projects for creating adequate Norwegian terms in the field of petrotechnology, which is dominated by the English language. They, too, felt themselves to be a minority threatened also by the influence of English terminology. This is also true for all the Nordic languages in the wide application of computer technology. They all, in their attitudes and measures taken, react as minority languages in the traditional sense. In Nordic co-operation measures have been taken many times and problems have been discussed concerning international loanwords, the goal being to integrate loan-words better in the same or mainly the same way into the Nordic languages. One dominating principle has been to harmonise. Another one has been to overcome problems caused by a far too large number of fresh loan-words. A language can in this way in different contexts simultaneously function as\n\n< previous page\n\npage_16\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_17\n\nnext page > Page 17\n\na majority and a minority language. Therefore the speech community in question can show attitudes typical of both, with differing emphasis according to the actual relations between those communities. 3. There is, of course, also a change due to time. The status of a language as a majority or a minority language can change as a result of political and/or cultural ups and downs. 4. Hence, my model of language planning may be a useful tool when a rough analysis of implementation and elaboration situations is needed, be it from a synchronic or a diachronic point of view. It can also be used taking into account either a narrower or broader context of neighbouring speech communities. The nature of possibly existing societal bilingualism seems to be crucial.

Timm Program in Linguistics, University of Califonia, Davis, Calif. 95616, U.S.A. Abstract. This paper provides a brief historical overview of language promotion efforts in Brittany, placing them within the context of the larger movement for ethnic revival and regional self-determination that has existed for at least a century in this far western region of France. Language has almost always played a role in the Breton movement, but the importance attached to it has varied by generation, class, political orientation of activists, and by whether or not the latter have themselves been Breton speakers. Since the 1960s the movement has gained momentum, accelerated in part by the worldwide burgeoning of the expression of ethnicity, in part by the increasing participation in the movement by non-élites, and in part by a degree of decentralisation recently permitted by the French government. A prime achievement of this last wave of activism has been the establishment of a network of pre-school and elementary classes that use Breton as a medium of instruction. Yet in spite of this and some other victories for the language in the public sector, it is concluded that the prospects for Breton as a living vernacular remain dim. Prologue Comment peut-on être breton? was the trenchant title of a provocative book published by Morvan Lebesque in 1970. This is indeed a profound question for Bretons, as it is for Basques, Occitans, Alsatians and other so-called 'regional' minority groups living within the territorial boundaries of modern France; for it is hardly a secret that the French state has for nearly two centuries sought the elimination of languages other than French and the cultures that support them. The Jacobin mentality of the French Revolution has sustained itself through the generations: countless statements from government officials (and others) stretching back two hundred years attest\n\n< previous page\n\npage_19\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_20\n\nnext page > Page 20\n\nboth to the low regard in which all non-French (i.e. Parisian) 'idiomes' were held and to the government's intense desire to get rid of the whole lot of them. One of the first public pronouncements articulating this viewpoint came from Barrère in 1794 when he declared in the name of the 'Committee of Public Safety' that 'Federalism and superstition speak Breton; emigration and hatred for the Republic speak German; counter-revolution speaks Italian and fanaticism speaks Basque'. He ended by proclaiming that 'among a free people, the language must be one and the same for everyone' (quoted in Gwegen 1975:33). Only in recent years have these attitudes begun to attenuate, most notably with President Giscard d'Estaing's 'Charte culturelle' in 1978 that established a Cultural Council of Brittany and that declared itself favourable to the teaching of the Breton language and culture and other actions in support of the language (promises that have been only partially realised). The current French President, François Mitterand, had as one of his campaign slogans 'le droit à la difference'. While campaigning in Brittany in 1981 he proclaimed: It does not behoove France to continue the shameful persecution of the regional languages and to remain the only European country to prevent national minorities from obtaining their basic cultural rights. (Bar-Lewaw, 1986) Yet six years later French minorities feel that, although they are no longer persecuted in the overt manner of the past, there has not been the kind of support and promotion of their languages and cultures that they had been led to believe the Socialist régime would usher in. The promised 'renaissance' of cultural diversity has hardly taken place. Part of the reason for this relates to the different viewpoints on the question of minority languages held by key government officialse.g. Jack Lang, the current Minister of Culture, has been favourable and opened certain doors (such as allocating the use of bilingual road signs and promoting the approval of a baccalaureate degree in Breton); at the same time, the Minister of Education, Jean-Pierre Chevènement, was stating publicly that he felt it was not in young people's best interest to study 'languages that do not help in opening new perspectives in the future' (ibid.). A few years earlier, in 1981, after much anguished debate, promises by the government, then retractions, the then Minister of Education, Savary, finally grudgingly approved the creation of the licence (equivalent of a university bachelors degree) in Breton. Protest and political mobilisation of students and other pro-Breton activists were required to extract this concession from the government. These examples illustrate the fragile, or perhaps, volatile, nature of the\n\n< previous page\n\npage_20\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_21\n\nnext page > Page 21\n\nstate's commitment to language minorities; it is understandably a source of frustration and grief to the latter groups, some of whose languages are in obvious danger of extinction. Breton is one of these. Brittany as an 'Ethnie' Thus far I have been referring to Brittany as one of France's linguistic and cultural minorities; but it is important to emphasise the fact that the Bretons constitute an ethnic community, or group, by most criteria that have been proposed in the literature on ethnicity. Definitions of the concept abound, and differing formulations are drawn depending upon the relative weight given to cultural, linguistic and political factors. For purposes of this paper I have found the characterisation by A.D. Smith (1981:66) apropos: For short, we may define the 'ethnie' or ethnic community as a social group whose members share a sense of common origins, claim a common and distinctive history and destiny, possess one or more distinctive characteristics, and feel a sense of collective uniqueness and solidarity. On all these counts the Bretons comprise an 'ethnie', though it is true, as with many other ethnic groups, that the claim of a 'common and distinctive history and destiny' has had to be elaborated and upheld mainly by the intellectual segment of the population, inasmuch as the French state has for so long attempted to suppress minority histories in the educational system and to assimilate their cultures to the French; thus common folk are not usually well informed about their ancestral past. It is also true that not all contemporary Bretons are especially interested in their ethnicity and may even repudiate it, or, perhaps, claim co-allegiance to France and accept that their destiny is bound up with the latter's. Nevertheless, the Breton people are linked to one another by 'primordial' ties of kinship, religion, custom and, until the twentieth century, of language. 1 It is arguably because of these very real or authentic ties (i.e. not invented or contrived as happens in the mobilisation of some ethnic groups) that Brittany has possessed a strong ethnic movement for nearly a century now, one that has ebbed and flowed in different waves, with differing results for successive generations of Bretons, and one that seems likely to go on. A book-length study would be necessary to do justice to the intricate history of this movement (and there are some good ones available, e.g. Reece, 1977; Nicolas, 1982); what I propose to do in this paper is to sketch in briefly some of the historical highlights of the movementEmsav in Bretonand then to indicate the role\n\n< previous page\n\npage_21\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_22\n\nnext page > Page 22\n\nthat the linguistic dimension of Breton ethnicity has played for movement activitists and for the Breton people in general. The Breton Movement (Emsav) The present day Emsav is no recent phenomenon, a simple by-product of the turbulent 1960s or a transitory effort to secure more political and economic rights for the Breton population. Its roots go back well into the nineteenth century and even intertwine with the late eighteenth-century Romantic notions associated with 'Celtomanie' (such as the idea that a Celtic language, presumably Breton, was spoken by Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden) touted by such Breton intellectuals as LeBrigant and La Tour d'Auvergne. Moreover, ethnic nationalism was not unknown elsewhere in Europe in the nineteenth century. As Smith (1981:24) points out: Ethnic revival is not only a global phenomenon, but a major trend stretching back, at least in Europe, for two centuries or more. It began in the late eighteenth century, erupted in the French Revolution and spread quickly to Central and Eastern Europe. There, the doctrines of nationalism fired and sanctioned the budding ethnic movements of Poles, Hungarians, Greeks, Serbs, Czechs, Italians and others. By the late nineteenth century, the Middle East had been caught up in this revival, with Armenians, Egyptians, Arabs, Kurds and others staking their ethnic claims. Smith argues, therefore, that 'the ethnic revival is a far more durable and powerful phenomenon than is usually depicted; and it draws on far deeper and historical roots than many would allow' (ibid.). Concerning Brittany, the movement as such 2 may be said to have been launched in the late nineteenth century with the establishment of the Union Régionaliste Bretonne (URB) in 1898 (Nicolas, 1982:43). This organisation is considered by historian J. Reece to be 'the first avowedly Breton regionalist society' (quoted in Fortier, 1980:140), one that attempted both economic and political reform and advocated teaching Breton in the schools. While the URB set the model which others could look to, it nevertheless failed ultimately due to its élitist stance (membership came mainly from the aristocratic and landed classes [Reece, 1977:61]). The URB also got bogged down, ironically, in the language issue itself, i.e. the draft resolution calling for bilingual instruction in the school system led to an imbroglio between the Francophone and Bretonophone members, the former only weakly committed to the idea, and the latter claiming that the language issue was central to advancing Breton\n\n< previous page\n\npage_22\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_23\n\nnext page > Page 23\n\ninterests. Heated debates arose at this time over the issue of the role of language in Breton identity, a debate which would resound throughout the twentieth-century movement. Bretonophone leaders left the organisation in disgust, and the URB ultimately withered away in about 1911. In the meantime, other nationalist organisations had been developing, e.g. the BleunBreug (Heath Flower), a Catholic association founded in 1905 by Abbé Perrot (later to be canonised as a Breton martyr following his assassination in 1943 for allegedly nationalistic activities). The Bleun-Breug flirted with political issues, but was devoted chiefly to promoting the language and traditional culture of Brittany. Another pre-World War I organisation, secular and separatistand a reaction to the conservative URBwas the Strollad Broadel Breiz (in French, Parti Nationaliste Breton, or PNB). Its aim was complete severance of ties with France. Breton, of course, was to be reinstated as the national language. Again the question arose among the leadership as to whether or not language was a crucical component of Breton identity, or as crucial, at any rate, as, say, history and culture. To some degree, the debate over language, filling many pages of the Breton militant journals, reflected the split between 'the two Brittanies'the French-speaking eastern or upper half (pays gallo) and the Breton-speaking western or lower half. The former territory (which includes the important historical urban centre of Rennes) had not been Breton-speaking since the tenth/eleventh century, yet the Gallo activists wanted to press the point that that particular unfortunate accident of their history did not and should not disqualify them as Bretons. Indeed, some went so far as to see this language lack as a positive attribute enhancing their sense of Bretonness and their national consciousnessand this precisely because they felt their Breton identity more jeopardised when they did not command the ancestral language (ibid:93). Though perhaps not acknowledged by this group of activists, the valuing of history over language may also have reflected the apparent reality of language use in Brittany at the time: Breton was the vernacular (in its many dialect forms) of the rural, coastal and island populations. It was, then, the language of peasants and fisherfolk, of the working class, in short. The commercial and professional classes as well as the aristocracy had been speaking primarily, if not exclusively, French for decades (the aristocracy for centuries). 3 Even the clergy spoke French among themselves, though they still found it necessary to know Breton in order to communicate with their parishioners; and they still offered mass and catechism in Breton, though French was beginning to encroach more and more in this domain.4 Nevertheless, the Breton-speaking militants would not accept a second-place position for the language. They argued their case passionately in the pages of the nationalist periodicals Brittia and Brug (ibid., pp. 84f.).\n\n< previous page\n\npage_23\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_24\n\nnext page > Page 24\n\nThese World War I organisations and publications had, in truth, little impact on the Breton population, who mobilised readily in defence of France at the outbreak of the war. 5 The war, moreover, brought the movement to a standstill, and it did not begin to regather its mometum until the 1920s. Reece argues that although there was no nationalistic activity during the war years, one result of that global turmoil was the development of Breton nationalism amidst the disrupted society that the war had produced, a nationalism fuelled more powerfully now by resentment at France for the loss of so many Breton lives. Thus, a new organisation and a new journal were born, Breiz Atao ('Brittany Forever'). 'Rising like a phoenix from the ashes, it embodied the resurrection of the polemic, the spirit and fervour of the prewar publications' (Fortier, 1980:143). Attention was now focussed less on history and the preservation of traditional ways than on the economic problems of the Bretons and the inequity of taxation for what Brittany was getting in return. Language was an issue to the Breiz Atao activists, but Francophone members were not told that they could not be patriots; rather, they were enjoined to make every effort to learn the language. As it turned out, a number of prominent interwar nationalists represented just this sort of patriota Francophone from birth who acquired Breton as a result of political beliefs. Some members of this group were interested primarily in achieving Breton independence and with rediscovering and revalidating Breton and Celtic history. Othersand several are of relevance to this paperdevoted themselves chiefly to language matters. The towering figure in the latter group is Roparz Hemon (born Louis Nemo). Hemon not only founded and edited an influential literary revue, Gwalarn ('Northwest'), that attracted the talents of a distinguished assemblage of Breton writers and poets but also contributed an awesome quantity of original linguistic and literary works, including dictionaries (contemporary and historical), grammars, essays, plays, novels and Breton translations of world literature. To a significant degree the codification of the modern language is due to Hemon's prodigious efforts; and the fact that the zedachek ('ZH') orthography is widely used today (there are at least two competing ones) is surely attributable to the fact that it was the choice of Hemon and the Gwalarn group.6 However, along with this codification and elaboration of the literary language came a widening of the gap between spoken and written forms of Breton, for an important aspect of Hemon's elaboration efforts entailed the creation of Breton neologisms to replace French-derived ones or to fill lexical gaps. His Breton-French dictionary is replete with words that no native speaker had ever used or would even be likely to comprehend. This is an ironic result for the linguist who once wrote: Nous voulons nous mêler au peuple (. . .) car il est la chair de notre chair. Ce n'est pas comme des imbeciles que nous venons le regarder,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_24\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_25\n\nnext page > Page 25\n\nmais comme des fils respectueux (. . .) c'est en lui que nous trouverons le sens de notre littérature, de notre vie. . . (Quoted in Lebesque, 1970:179) Yet Hemon, and many of the movement intellectuals for that matter, was in truth schizoid in his attitude toward the people. Revering them from a distance, he (and others) nevertheless were repelled at the thought of mixing with them and allowing their 'coarse' and 'corrupted' speech to percolate into the new literary standard that he was crafting. This is evident in the editorial of the inaugural issue of Gwalarn, in which Hemon describes (in French) the purpose of the journal: Revue littéraire destinée à l'élite du public bretonnant . . . pour la première fois une revue bretonnante presentera exclusivement à des lecteurs instruits des articles faits pour eux ... travaux d'une irreprochable tenue littéraire, et fermant la porte aux patois (même decorés du nom de dialectes) . . . déclencher un mouvement général de l'élite bretonnante. (Quoted in Nicolas, 1982:86) His 'ivory tower' approach to the creation of the literary languageone of Hemon's legaciesremains a troubling problem today for the implementation of Breton language programmes in the schools. Yann Sohier is another name of importance in the Breton language movement. He may, in fact, be regarded as a precursor to the present-day Diwan movement, the network of Breton language schools that will be described later. Sohier's relationship with many of his nationalist peers was not always good, for he was an avowed communist, this penchant evident in the title chosen for the journal he launched, Ar Falz (The Sickle), targeted at lay teachers of Breton. From Upper Brittany (pays gallo) and trained as a teacher, Sohier was given a position in a school in Lower (Breton-speaking) Brittany. It was there that he became fully aware of the linguistic and cultural oppression of the educational system; he soon began speaking out in favour of Breton language instruction, and in 1933-34 worked intensively to garner public support for this idea. An early death unfortunately prevented Sohier from realising his dream, but a few years later, in 1942, one of his friends, Kerlann, opened the first Bretonlanguage elementary school (in Tregor). In announcing his plans to open this school, Kerlann explained: 'Tired of waiting in vain for Breton to be taught in State schools, I've decided to create the first wholly Breton school' (quoted in Gwegen, 1975:97). He goes on to admit that he has almost nothing with which to start a schooldesks, books, writing pads, pencils are all in short supply, as is money. 'However,' he concludes resolutely, 'I've firmly decided to realise my project against all odds' (Gwegen, 1975). It is this same spirit and tenacity that drive today's language activists.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_25\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_26\n\nnext page > Page 26\n\nKerlann's school lasted only three years, shut down in the aftermath of the purges against Breton activists following World War II. The history behind these events is complex and would take me too far afield to discuss here. Suffice it to say that there was a vigorous post-war anti-Breton campaign waged by the government in retaliation for the alleged collaboration of Breton activists with the Nazis during the war and especially during the Occupation. Hundreds of Bretons were arrested merely for having been members of any sort of Breton association or organisation. Many were stripped of civil rights and/or had their property confiscated. Leaders were imprisoned or exiled (Hemon, for example, went to Ireland, where he lived out his life); fifteen were executed as traitors (Fortier, 1980:146). The post World War II decade, then, in contrast with the years following World War I, was not only depressed economically but also from the perspective of Breton morale. While other parts of France began experiencing growth and were starting to enjoy new levels of prosperity, Brittany languished. An ever-strong birth rate coupled with stagnant economic conditions promoted much out-migration. The age pyramid began shifting in favour of the older segment of the population, a situation that has not really changed even today in rural Brittany. A new organisation emerged in 1950, avowedly apolitical, with the aim of stimulating economic growth on the Peninsulathis was the Comité d'Etudes et de Liaison d'Interêts bretons (CELIB); it had a cultural commission that worked unsuccessfully to earn official recognition for Breton in the schools in traditionally Breton-speaking areas (Reece, 1977:181). In 1957 the Mouvement pour l'Organisation de la Bretagne (MOB), more inclined than the CELIB toward political action, was founded. A hallmark of this organisation was its adherence to the idea of Brittany as a colony 7 and a return to the idea of Breton autonomy (i.e. home rule for Brittany's five departments). This interpretation of Breton problems, ironically perhaps, attenuated the degree of emphasis that had previously been placed by militant organisations on linguistic and cultural oppression; and language was not a burning issue within the MOB. However, for the group that soon split off from the MOBthe Union Démocratique Bretonne (UDB)language was crucial (though this group, too, adopted the Brittany-as-colony perspective). In fact, many of its members were Breton speakers from the Finistère in Lower Brittany. This organisation has, since 1964 or so, been an important element in the leftwing of Breton politics. It launched in the mid-1960s what would turn out to be a highly successful magazine, Le Peuple Breton, that has always espoused strong support for the language; indeed, for several years it published a Breton-language version (much slimmer) of Le Peuple Breton under the Breton banner of Pobl Vreizh. Unfortunately, if tellingly, the\n\n< previous page\n\npage_26\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nnext page > Page 27\n\nlatter folded just a year or two ago due to financial malnutrition. As we move further into the 1960s and then into the 1970s and 1980s in this rapid trek through Breton movement history, we see a veritable explosion of militant organisations, some of which have attracted no small measure of media attention through their more spectacular actions, e.g. the FLB (Front pour la Libération de la Bretagne) bombing in 1974 of the main television transmission tower for western Brittany and in 1978 the bombing of a wing of the Château de Versailles. These latter-day militants are chiefly younger people, from diverse walks of life; 8 they are also predominantly neobretonnant(e)s (if they speak Breton at all) and aggressive in their claims for linguistic as well as political and economic selfdetermination. Certain ones, following arrest for their actions, have languished in prison for refusing to speak French in the courtroom. A few have gone on hunger strikes to draw attention to the financial plight of the Diwan schools. A point of great importance about these recent organisations is that. they are far less élitist than their predecessors and that they haveto a far greater extent than ever beforecaptured the imagination of a broader swatch of the Breton population. In brief, the movement has been galvanising the general public and at the same time moving out of the wings into the flow of everyday social life. This is evident in the profusion of Breton festivals, in the propagation of Breton literature, music and musical societies, the ubiquity of 'Bzh' (Brittany) car stickers and the Breton flag. Last, but not least, there is the emergence of Diwan and the granting of a licence and CAPES in Breton.9 Diwan (a Breton word meaning 'seed') is a network of Breton-medium elementary schools strung throughout Brittany, and it is equally an association of parents and teachers. This year marks its tenth anniversary, which is no mean achievement considering the obstacles and financial difficulties that have plagued this dauntless and innovative organisation from the beginning. Diwan owes its existence to the efforts of concerned young parents who feel deeply the effects of having been denied their traditional language in their own childhood and are determined that their children will not be so denied. Diwan warrants a history of its own, which cannot be attempted here. I will simply say that its emergence in the late 1970s is certainly related to the popular prise de conscience of ethnicity that was manifested in Europe and the U.S.A. beginning in the mid to late 1960s10 and to the actions of the more radical organisations in the Emsav, mentioned above. Another factor was the emergence in the 1970s of a French government less overtly hostile to linguistic/cultural minorities, as noted at the beginning of this paper. Launched on a diminutive scale and a shoestring budget with one\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page > Page 28\n\nkindergarten class in northwest Brittany (Lampaul-Ploudalmézeau), the Diwan network now comprises 30 classes, including 13 pre-schools, 17 primary level classes, and 380 students. There are some 40 teachers, none of whom is paid by the state, and an overall annual operating budget of six million French francs. A critical issue for Diwan is integration into the state educational system, a process that had been envisaged from the outset in order both to 'mainstream' Breton and ensure financial stability and regular teaching careers for instructors. However, integration has still not taken place because the government's stipulations are problematic: specifically, the government has proposed only partial funding for the teachers and is also demanding that French be introduced from the lowest (pre-school) levels, whereas Diwan has been running the pre-school classes in Breton only, and introducing French in the primary levels. It is feared that the government is using this as a tactic to undermine the Breton component of the bilingual programme. For years Diwan had staunchly resisted this, but finally in early 1987under threat of bankruptcythe beleaguered association was forced to accept the government's conditions. As one observer says of this predicament: 'Diwan est aujourd'hui à un tournant. Se saborder en refusant trop de concessions ou perdre son identité en allant trop loin dans la réforme' (Seité, 1987). 11 In addition to seeking a place for Breton in pre-school and elementary education, language activists of the 1970s and 1980s have been breaking new trails in the groves of academe: as noted earlier, 1981 saw the granting of the licence in Breton (following a decade of requests and petitions), which was an immediate success343 students enrolled in September 1981 at the Université de Haute Bretagne (Rennes-2). It is true that enrolments tapered off in subsequent years, but this was arguably due more to the fact that other degrees needed to render the licence a tenable one (in terms of preparation and employability) were still lacking. One of these, the CAPES (Certificat d'Aptitude au Professorat de l'Enseignement du Second Degré) was granted in 1985it is the degree required to be employable as a language teacher in the public schools. It, too, was won only after an arduous campaign by language activists in Brittany and elsewhere in Europe and the U.S.A.12 The final link in the chain of higher degrees still needed to put Breton on an equal footing with other languages taught in France is the DEUG (Diplôme d'Etudes universitaires générales), which has hitherto been denied by the government. This degree may be an end in itself or may qualify a student to go on for the more specialised licence. A question naturally arises to any outsider reading this account: namely, what does the Breton public think . . . do they care about Diwan and Breton in the schools, or anywhere else for that matter? I believe that the answer increasingly is yes. Breton language supporters and promoters are\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page > Page 29\n\nfound throughout Brittany, and they show their support by means of public manifestations (street rallies, sign-carrying), petitionsigning, and direct contributions to Diwan's coffers (over 4,500 people have volunteered an automatic payroll deduction payable to Diwan). A weekend gathering in March of 1987 to demonstrate interest in and promotion of language and other Breton cultural issues drew 4,000-5,000 people to the interior town of Carhaix. Stourm ar Brezhoneg (Battle for Breton), a group that worked for several years clandestinely in burning or tarring 10,000 French street and road signs, has recently been put out of work: bilingual signs are, with government authorisation, being erected along a major northern highway of the Peninsula. It is unfortunate that vandalism had to be resorted to, for this has meant arrests and court fees for those judged guilty, who can ill afford the fines; but Breton history has shown repeatedly that the state will never give an inch on its own initiative. Through Diwan, bilingual road signs, Breton theatrical productions, and an expanding corpus of Breton literature, the traditional language of Brittany is at last gaining a true public presence. Much more visibility is needed especially in the media, which are still overwhelmingly French in language and cultural content); 13 but this presence is already helping to counteract 'the deafening propaganda of the status quo' (to borrow E.P. Thompson's apt phrase)helping, that is, Bretons reassert their sense of distinctiveness as a people with a shared heritage. It is perhaps in the achievements and the works in progress of this last wave of Breton activistswho have reached out to and affected a more popular base than ever beforethat Bretons of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries will be able to find an answer to Lebesque's troubling question, with which I opened this essay. Conclusion Where is the Breton language headed? With perhaps a half-million speakers, most of whom are (well) over 50, and lacking strong institutional support, the ineluctable answer appears to be that it is on its way out. Yet Diwan and other expressions of the Emsav over the past decade or so have mobilised impressive numbers of Breton people from different walks of life to take a stand on issues that affect their lives. Ultimately the Breton movement exists because Bretons are discontent with the way things arewith economic discrimination, with insufficient social services, with long years of insults and depracation, and with the historical suppression of their linguistic and cultural expression. Language is a symbol of that\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nnext page > Page 30\n\ndissatisfaction and of the Bretons' claims for fairer treatment. If they can sustainor better, of course, increasethe current level of interest in protesting the status quo and promoting the language through Diwan and other initiatives, then it seems to me that Breton has a fighting chance of surviving. However, I possess no crystal ball, and while I admit (to paraphrase Roamain Rolland) to a pessimism of the intelligence, I, along with many Bretons, cling tenaciously to an optimism of the will. Notes to Chapter 3 1. An opposing view has recently been voiced by writer P. Rannou (1987) who denies that there is either a Breton people or a Breton culture, the latter being absent because the population has assimilated to the French; and the former consisting of no more than 'militants marginalisés' (p. 18). This cynical assessment of contemporary Breton society contains, certainly, some insights into an ethnic group that has been subject forcibly to assimilation, but it overlooks the positive creations (such as Diwansee below) that are emerging from the Breton movement, creations that, in turn, are forging a new sense of Breton identity (cf. Kuter, forthcoming). 2. That is, the movement in terms of organisation. Linguistic reformssuch as efforts to normalise the orthography of the three northern dialects and to expunge French loanwordshad been underway since the early nineteenth century. 3. The fact that the working classes were numerous and did not interact extensively with the other classes within or outside of Brittany is one of the reasons Breton has persisted for so long (cf. Hechter & Levi, 1979:265). 4. In some recent archival research Per Denez (1986) has come across documents from the turn of the century in which the departmental prefects were instructed to have local mayors surveille the local cures to make sure that they were giving Sunday sermons and catechisms in French at least every other week. If the priests made no effort to introduce French into their services, their salaries were to be withheld. As many as 99 priests in the départemente of the Finistère had their salaries so suspended, but the plan was never effective on a massive scale due to the resistance of the mayors, who balked at acting as informers. The whole scheme, however, is indicative of the subversive techniques used by the government in their attempts to assimilate the Bretons. 5. And who paid dearly in lives: Brittany may have lost as many as 240,000 men to the war, amounting to a fatality rate of 1 in 14, compared with 1 in 28 for the rest of France (cf. Reece, 1977:87). 6. Well known names associated with this group include Jakez Riou, Youenn Drezen, Kongar, Langleiz, Abeozen and Meavenn. 7. This was a concept articulated in 1957 by Yann Fouéré, a leading nationalist figure for many years; Fouéré likened Brittany to an external colonised nation such as Algeria (Reece, 1979:289, n. 2). The notion has gained wide currency and has been formulated as an explicit model to account for the socio-economic underdevelopment and ethnic resurgence in the 'Celtic fringe' of the British Isles (see Hechter, 1975; Hechter & Levi, 1979); Reece (1977) applies the model to Brittany. For critiques see Smith, 1981; Williams, 1980. 8. Reece (1977:207-8) reports on the demographic characteristics of arrested FLB suspects as follows: Men and women, Bretonnants and non-Bretonnants, rich and poor, radicals and conservativesall figured among the factory workers, farmers, university intellectuals, military officers, businessmen and priests accused of clandestine terrorist action. One attribute most had in common, however, was their youthfulness. 9. The significance of the latter two will be noted below.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_31\n\nnext page > Page 31\n\n10. Berger maintains that the movement of the 1960s attracted young people because it 'provided a way of not being French, a way of being revolutionary' (1977:173). My feeling is that while this may have been true initially, nowadays people are not simply 'not being French' but are positively, pro-actively being Breton. 11. Matters have gone from bad to worse for Diwan since this was written: the latest French Minister of Education, R. Monory, has unceremoniously cancelled all previous commitments made, and signed, by the government to the officials of Diwan regarding the integration of its teachers into the public system. As reported in Ouest France (3rd February 1987), the document signed in February 1986 between the state and Diwan, assuring the integration of 31 teachers and classes 'n'est que le fruit de circonstances particulières' and thus lacks 'aucune valeur', according to Monory. Unless alternative revenue sources are found quickly, the Diwan teachers will be laid off their jobs. 12. Through the activities of the International Committee for the Defence of the Breton language (ICDBL), an organisation founded in Brussels in 1975; it now has branches in a dozen or more countries, including an active U.S. branch that publishes an informative newsletter, Bro Nevez, several times a year and tries to promote awareness of and interest in Breton language and culture.
