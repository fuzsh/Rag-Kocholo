        "text": "English summary\n\nFilm and digital radiographic receptors\n\n8 – 15.\n\nX-ray film emulsion consists mainly of silverhalide grains, which after exposure are reduced to metallic silver in the basic – or more recently ascorbic acid-based – developmental process. Ascorbic acid-based chemicals are less toxic and do not smell and should be preferred in dental practice. The dentists can choose between the film and three well established digital receptors for intraoral radiography, the CCD-based («charge-coupled device») sensor, the CMOS-based («complementary metal oxide silicon») sensor and the photostimulable phosphor plate (PSP). The spatial resolution (line pairs/mm) in images from intraoral examination is lower in many digital systems than in the dental film and varies between approximately 6 and 20 lp/mm. The contrast resolution or bit depth (number of possible shades of grey available) in digital intraoral images is between 8 (256 grey shades) and 16 (65.536 grey shades), and the image file (size of the image) increases proportional with the resolution. For caries diagnosis no studies have found differences between intraoral digital images with various resolutions; for endodontic file measurements 12-bit images had higher accuracy than 8-bit images. PSP systems have a larger dynamic range than CCD and CMOS sensors, i.e. PSPs tolerate more variation in exposure settings.\n\nFilm technology implies that the emulsion can be damaged, and image quality is highly dependent on the developmental chemicals and procedure. PSP plates are scratched at loads between 50 and 100 grams. Some scanners for PSP plates possess «intelligence» and display only the exposed part of the image. The plate loses information if exposed to light after exposure before scanning, but no subjective change can be perceived in the image up to 7 days after exposure if the plate is stored in complete darkness. A «blooming» phenomenon may occur in CCD-based images after over-exposure to the sensor, leading to burned-out areas at the bone crest or cervical part of the tooth.\n\nPatients’ feeling of unpleasantness during an intraoral radiographic examination is higher with digital receptors than with film. PSP plates are less unpleasant than sensors, and thicker sensors are as may be expected more unpleasant than thinner sensors and a wireless sensor. Many more retakes – up to double as many – are needed when performing bitewings or a periapical examination of the third molar region with CCD sensors than with PSP plates or film. An «acceptable» image quality can be obtained with sensors and older versions of PSP systems using approximately 40 – 70 % of the radiation dose needed for E-speed film at a single exposure. However, a reduced scanning time in present PSP systems among other factors implies that radiation dose should be the same to the PSP plate as to film in order to obtain an optimal quality image. The smaller image field in sensors compared with PSP plates and the more retakes that are performed add to the conclusion that overall, no dose saving exists with digital systems compared to film. Even though the digital receptors are re-used for exposure of many consecutive patients, cross-contamination seems not be a problem since bacteria from the oral cavity could not be cultured from PSP plates when these were packed in envelopes during exposure. The sensors can be wiped with alcohol tissue while the plates do not tolerate wiping.\n\nFilm should be read on a light box with a reasonable luminance (> 1700 cd/m2), and digital images are read on the computer monitor. Recent high-cost LCD monitors do not increase caries diagnostic accuracy, and older low-cost monitors do not impair accuracy. Many dentists however need to adjust light- and contrast settings of their monitor, which together with the intensity of the room light < 50 lux, is important for the caries diagnostic outcome. Most diagnostic studies of digital intraoral images show no differences in diagnostic accuracy between digital receptors and film or among the digital systems. Several reviews are published within the areas of caries diagnosis, endodontics, pediatric dentistry and orthodontics.\n\nOne of the advantages of digital imaging compared with film – besides the lack of wet chemicals – is the ability to change the image after capture. The software contains various possibilities for post-processing of the image: zooming, density and contrast changes, enhancement filters, grey scale inversion, conversion of grey shades to pseudo-color and measurements in true mm after calibration of the image to an object with known size. Though the software is usually dedicated to a particular digital receptor type, general software may provide as accurate measurements and diagnostic accuracy as the system-dependent ones. If the digital image is optimally exposed the use of enhancement has little effect on the diagnostic outcome. The development of «task-specific» enhancement algorithms may in the future be an aid for the dentist as well as automatic computer-assisted image analysis.\n\nFilm radiographs are often mislaid, and few dentists use double film or make film copies. A digital image can be «copied» infinitely to third parties, but the file of a patient should be encrypted before sent over the internet. When exported from its original software, the digital image may be fraudulently changed, undetectable to the observer. Irreversible image compression, like JPEG changes the pixel values and implies a destruction of the original image. For caries lesion detection, the diagnostic accuracy may be impaired with high compression rates, but which details are lost in a compressed image depends on the initial information in the image. Generally, compression should be avoided in the primary storage of digital images."
