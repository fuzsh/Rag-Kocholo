        "text": "Every Vibration, Every Sound, Hangs in the Air:\n\nThe Sound and Video Works of Dodda Maggý\n\nTina Rigby Hanssen, PhD in Art History and Media Theory\n\nJune 2017\n\nIn the Icelandic composer and artist Dodda Maggý’s ten-minute video and sound installation DeCore (venus) (2015), we are immersed in flickering, undulating patterns as they build up from a single element to a cluster of overlapping elements which looks like a parallelogram. The elements then slowly dissolve, and new ones appear in a perpetual process of transformation. The intricate designs, which are digitally animated, evoke natural elements and processes such as the fractal or repetitive patterns associated with foliage, mountains ranges, raindrops, snowflakes or coastlines. It is evident, however, that despite the apparent repetitiveness of, for example, a snowflake’s hexagonal symmetry, there is a variety and depth to Maggý’s projection. Both the images and the soundtrack consist of certain small elements which together form and regroup into shifting entities. There is something fragile and organic about the whole installation, as it pulses and circulates its patterns. This flow is rendered as both audible and visible signals, creating an ambience from these raw materials for us to experience as part of the unfathomable mystery of life.\n\nAs we enter this exhibition space, our bodies become part of Maggý’s ubiquitous play with shadow and light, introducing an additional ‘pattern’ to the constantly shifting structure of the artwork. We become part of this ‘living’ organism and its pulsating, flickering images. Standing in the beam of the projector, we can even cast a purposeful shadow onto the projected image and in this way become part of the narrative. Maggý has installed a transparent curtain in front of the projected images, so that the visitor can move between it and the projection. Using our senses in the room is, in other words, a crucial element of this work. In the accompanying soundtrack, Maggý explores the multiple layers of a single sampled cello sound, converting the frequency spectrum of the pitch into a host of subtle overtones through a strictly controlled reverberating drone. This sound gives us little to work with, but it lodges itself in our ears and minds nevertheless.\n\nThe ambient use of the frequency spectrum of a single note rather than a more complex or varied soundscape forces us inward. Maggý’s soundtrack shares qualities with the genre of electronic music known as drone music, which is often discussed in terms of its physical effects. As Joanna Demers notes:\n\nIn drones, dub techno, and noise, the use of stasis and noise runs counter to habitual expectations for how elements of musical syntax interact with one another. These elements last too long and are too loud, and they disrupt the sense that music functions as a language by calling attention to physical aspects that music usually asks us to ignore. The liminal quality of this music – the stresses it places on the body and the attention span – all wrest music out of a reasoned, ordered plane and thrust it back into the world of objects and raw materials.1\n\nMaggý’s use of extended durations and loud volumes not only impacts the work’s environment but also tests the limits of our concentration and tolerance. Drones, after all, affect our bodies in unique ways, transmitting ‘sound’ not only through the ears but also through the whole body. The assumption is that hearing and touch are closely connected, and that they ‘meet where the lower frequencies of audible sound pass over to tactile vibrations (at about 20 Hertz)’.2 We listen with our ears as well as with our bodies – our skin and bones function as excellent sound conductors, to ensure that our bodies respond more effectively to sound stimuli. This is why even deaf people can sense sound, and Maggý draws upon these associations via the sustained drones in her work.\n\nThe repetitive qualities of these sounds not only challenge our conception of listening to music but also engage us on their own terms.\n\nMaggý’s use of sustained sounds and repetitive animated patterns recalls the avant-garde music and experimental psychedelic scene of the 1960s – think of artists such as the American minimalist composer La Monte Young, best known for pioneering the concept of extended time durations in contemporary music, and in Tony Conrad’s flickering films, as well as Terry Riley, Phill Niblock, Marian Zazeela, Meredith Monk, all from the USA, and Bridget Riley UK, known for the optical illusions of her famous op-art paintings of psychedelic patterns.3 The artists of this era all sought to explore various perceptual effects, and Maggý’s use of the multiple layers within a single sampled cello sound recalls, in particular, Niblock’s manipulation of recordings of long tones played on acoustic instruments to create dense compositions of sound.\n\nWhile Maggý’s soundtrack does not feature much noticeable variation in intensity, it is not static but rather subtly variegated. It begins with the fading in of the single sustained but undulating pitch; then, after a short time, we hear another sustained tone entering above the initial one, and this process of aggregation continues over the course of the work. Still, these changes are only perceivable if we listen very carefully, thus introducing a pointed ambiguity to the experience of Maggý’s work: was there a change in the tone we heard just now? Did we imagine that sound or was it real? Can we trust our ears?\n\nWhereas images have a tendency to keep the viewer at a distance from what is going on, sound pulls us in, positioning us at the centre of it all. We engage in a continuous process of filtering and absorbing sound as we attempt to distinguish between different sounds and assign respective meanings to them. We experience the world as much through our ears as through our eyes, and the two sources of information do not always cohere – listening can even challenge the way we see and participate in the world. But it is, at the same time, as Salomé Voegelin observes,\n\n[…] an experiential fact full of playful illusions, purposeful errors and contingent idiosyncrasies. Listening is not about the physical constitution of sound; as little as seeing is about the physical constitution of the seen, it is the perception of those physical constitutions, fraught with the uncertainty of an erroneous, unreliable ear.4\n\nListening is always tinged with uncertainty and unreliability, thanks to what we cannot hear or are afraid that we might have misheard or misunderstood. Nor does it harbour any physical evidence, because it is always in the process of becoming. Maggý’s work prepares for us, with these qualities and characteristics, a new audio-visual environment, which enables us to sink into our inner associations and memories. It even allows us to reflect on the ways in which the human perceptual system functions as it acts to enlighten, betray or seduce our minds.\n\nThe suggestive qualities of Maggý’s sound open her work to alternative interpretations, as opposed to specific associations or motives. When there are few sonic cues with which to connect certain associations or sources, one’s auditory imagination tends to kick in, which opens up a new set of questions related to sensory and perceptual processes and subjectivity. This kind of exploration of drone music and repetitive sounds, of course, again recalls the sound art pioneers mentioned above, as well as the various Fluxus artists from the 1960s, who experimented with sound processing and recording.\n\nLucy and Rainbow: the Murmur of Voices In the short video and sound installation Lucy (2009), we encounter a captivating female singing voice before we see any images. The voice has been recorded close up in order to capture its physicality, and we hear breathing noises and register even very small changes in tone and pitch, which ranges from very low to very high.5 Every tone is sustained for several seconds before changing. Suddenly, a silhouette emerges fleetingly from the darkness, and then we experience brief flashes of a female figure in a shimmering gold dress, her dark hair and pale skin surrounded by a black field. The identity of this woman is never revealed although the work’s title indicates that her name is Lucy. At first, the voice seems to align with the appearances of the character on the screen, as though to represent her as a person. When the soundtrack changes from a single voice to a choir, however, the character’s behaviour promptly changes as well. This sudden shift in the installation’s aural and visual elements disrupts the relationship between the voice we hear and the figure we see. The character now appears to be desperately struggling to control and embody the voice which, in contrast, effortlessly sustains its quality of sound, breath, volume, pitch, and tone. The character’s erratic behaviour adds a sense of strangeness to the work, and, in tandem with images now reminiscent of a movie by David Lynch – that is, mysterious, weird, and hard to grasp – seems to suggest that we are witnessing a dream sequence, or even the collapse of the character’s mind. At first, then, it may seem that nothing much is happening, given the simplicity of the narrative but, beneath the surface, very deliberate attention is being paid to the psychological shift or transformation in the protagonist. The emotionally intense images ex- press something of the vulnerability and frustration that characterises the female character’s imprisonment in her own mind, and the sound adds a particularly unsettling quality to the installation, especially as its layering becomes more complex.\n\nIn Performing Rites, Simon Frith presents four characteristic ways of listening to the human voice: as an instrument, as a body, as a person and as a role or character. In other words, we can listen to the abstract qualities of the voice – its materiality – or we can connect the voice with a particular person or character. Either way, of course, the voice sustains its link to the world that surrounds it, and we hear it within the context of established cultural rules and norms.6 Frith even concludes that its authenticity is typically constructed – that is, it derives from a staging of expected norms within which the voice is understood as a ‘real’ expression of one’s personality. In short, your voice comes from your body and tells the story of who you are. Steven Connor describes its essential paradox:\n\nMy voice defines me because it draws me into coincidence with myself, accomplishes me in a way which goes beyond mere belonging, association, or instrumental use. And yet my voice is also most essentially itself and my own in the ways in which it parts or passes from me. Nothing about me defines me so intimately as my voice, precisely because there is no other feature of my self whose nature it is thus to move from me to the world, and to move me into the world.7\n\nIndeed, we tend to take the voice for granted and make an issue of it only when it fails us. Think, for example, of an opera singer whose voice suddenly disappears during a performance or a news announcer interrupted by a coughing fit. In Lucy, the character seems to be confronted by a voice which takes on a character or identity of its own separately from her. In discussing the not (yet) visualised voice in film, film theorist Michel Chion (and Pierre Schaeffer before him) relies upon the term acousmêtre – that is, a voice which is able to ‘be everywhere, to see all, to know all, and to have complete power’.8 He also connects the power of voice to a form of panoptic fantasy, or total mastery of space through vision and concludes that the intervention of an acousmatic voice, or a voice heard in the absence of a physical body visible on screen, often makes the story into a quest of anchoring this voice there.\n\nWhen the voice is not localised but separated from the body, then re- turned as an acousmêtre, it often speaks from an ‘I-voice’ position, in particularly close proximity to the spectator’s ear.9\n\nLucy raises questions related to situations where there appears to be a struggle or psychological interruption between one’s understanding of one’s self and the voice which is expressing it. People recovering from a stroke that causes aphasia often experience a change in the language centres of the brain – they may find, perhaps, that they are unable to articulate or pronounce the words they want to say. This inability leads to a sudden collapse of linguistic structures, so that words become meaningless and may block communication. Other voice-related situations can be even more complicated. What if one does not recognise one’s own voice while one is speaking? This condition, known as an auditory hallucination, is one of the many disabling symptoms experienced by people diagnosed with schizophrenia, who are believed to have a defect in the circuit which allows one to recognise one’s own voice.10 This failure can also happen to non-schizophrenic people, during spiritual experiences or times of trauma, sensory deprivation or emotional dis- tress. The voice one hears at these moments is immediately recognisable, but it may not be one’s own.11 It could be that of a family member, a friend or someone from one’s past. These voices can be as real as hearing a person speaking in the same room, or they can be a constant mumbling in the background. They come from inside us and engage with our whole psyche – our fears, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIn this sound installation, the materiality of the voice, that is, its repetitive qualities, sustained overtones, duration, and pitch – combined with the layered recordings to contribute to the presentation of fragility and vulnerability in the singing voice, or something between a scream and a moan, a cry and a sigh. At the same time, this work obscures the pas- sage of time, because we are unable to situate this voice in any particular place. As such, the recording and processing of the voice contribute to a deprivation of the senses. While the voice in Lucy is always clearly human in nature, the voice in Rainbow (2011) dissolves into an unrecognisable mass of sound. Maggý created this installation from more than one thousand recordings of a single voice, producing a monotone hum which spans a range of pitch levels. The initially fragile voice gains strength as it is layered, and both volume and tension increase as the work progresses. Presented via two 5.1 surround-sound systems, this mass of sound circles around an al- most completely darkened space until it becomes a drone of singing voices, a thick blanket of sound which ends in a crescendo of voices at a high volume and with great intensity.\n\nThe sound designs of Dodda Maggý demand a visceral engagement with her works through enhanced vibrations not only in the eardrums but also in the resonant chambers of the body. With the help of specific drone frequencies and digitally animated flickering images, she creates new ways for us to interact with both her art and our own inner spaces. We are forced to fall back on the human perceptual system and the continuous processing activity of our brains – a network of connections which sometimes gets lost in a fluid zone between reality and hallucinations. Maggý enables us to face the intangible, including what might otherwise exceed our limited sensory experience in the world, by presenting installations whose content we can think both with and through as it unfolds.\n\n1 Joanna Demers, Listening through the Noise: The Aesthetics of Experimental Electronic Music, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010: p. 91.\n\n2 R.

And literature, actually. Music is sort of my background. I first studied music and then when I started working with visual arts, I sort of found ways to create my own language using a musical sensibility combined with films. Some of it comes from my interest in phenomenology, especially from reading Gaston Bachelard and Jean-Paul Sartre. But also lyrical filmmakers such as Maya Deren and Sergei Parajanov. Even though I studied art and, of course, look at art and follow what’s happening in the art world, I’m more inspired by cinema and music. When it comes to what I read and research, it’s mostly connected to cinema or film theory and music or sound design rather than visual arts.\n\nLP The animations you compose, do they create a base for the music to grow or is it the other way around?\n\nDM Well, it’s a bit funny because it’s both ways at this point. I find it hard to say whether it’s more the music or more the visual arts. For example, first I studied music and then I started working in visual arts and, in particular, video. There’s a connection between video and music, as they’re both time-based, so you’re constructing something on a timeline and, to put it very simply, it deals with build-up and tension.\n\nWhen I started working with the visual arts, it was sort of the combination between film and music and how the two mediums combined created a new space, somehow. When I was in art school studying visual arts, I was working with both music and video and then, after my master’s degree, I went back to study- ing musical composition. After returning to the musical department, I felt my musical language had been ruined, somehow. I could feel that my brain had changed after studying visual arts. When I talked to my fellow classmates, I realised that I saw mu- sic from another perspective. I’ve been wondering if I’m more of a visual artist than a composer. Sometimes I feel that I don’t belong to either. I feel I’m really somewhere in between in my creative thinking and how I process ideas.\n\nLP So your work isn’t a visualisation of music? It’s much tighter than that?\n\nDM Yes, it really is. In my recent works, I’m working much more formally with these animations and, in a way, I’m exploring compo- sition and music visually. But I’m still composing when I create images; they’re made with a musical sensibility. And, actually, in some of my older works, I was using music as a narrative tool to drive the underlying ‘story’ of the piece, as the music was paired with video. I’m composing a visual language of music appealing to all senses, somehow.\n\nLP So when you say that you’re also very inspired by films, how does that relationship work, then? Is it from well known classical films or is it more from film theory that you get your inspiration?\n\nDM I use a lot of technical elements from film theory in the way I work with video. There are some technical devices in the cinema that are quite underestimated. Like the power of audio. We sort of forget about it, we forget about the sound design, and we forget about the music; we take it for granted that the sound is just a natural component of the image when, in fact, it’s constructed and added after filming. If you remove the music and sound de- sign, the film would collapse.\n\nAs a viewer, you become familiar with the language of moving images through popular media. For example, it wasn’t until I was in art school that I really started to study video art and, even at that time, in the early days of YouTube, you could only see video art in museums and galleries. I could only read descriptions and see stills of a lot of the pieces that I was learning about. Today, you can find almost anything online. So I use these structural devices that viewers understand to create my work, but I don’t necessarily use them conventionally. I’m not a tradition- al filmmaker. I play with the devices, sometimes skewing and twisting them.\n\nLP So, it’s more on a technical level than on a story line level?\n\nDM Well, I think it’s both. I think that a significant part of the story is portrayed through sound. It’s just not always obvious to the viewer. Through sound, the viewer experiences another level of the narrative, and the sound contributes a lot when creating the energy of a film. I’d say that we, as viewers, underestimate the power of sound design. My earliest influence was David Lynch and particularly the old Twin Peaks series. I’d go so far as to say that a lot of his work really is the sound design, the way he uses music. The sound is really what creates the energy in his visuals. For example, he sometimes uses a very low bass, almost so low that you cannot hear it, but it moves the air, it sort of creates another dimension of something you can’t see, which, I think, is a theme he often works with.\n\nLP I recently heard a documentary about how David Lynch collaborated with the composer on creating the theme tune for Twin Peaks. How they did it as a mix of everyday recognisable sounds, which fill our daily lives without us noticing it, but still carry a huge part of the meaning.\n\nDM Yeah, totally. Even in the new series, I really do think that David Lynch is very much working like a sound artist. David Lynch and Angelo Badalenti used the music technique called leitmotif, which comes from opera (Wagner) and denotes a short, musical phrase associated with a particular person, place, or idea. Now it’s standard use in the cinema. But in the old Twin Peaks, Lynch gave each individual main character their own theme song and he then wove these themes, these leitmotifs, together with the overall music. He used leitmotifs to indicate something that’s happening ‘below the surface’. For example, when we hear a theme of a character not appearing on the screen, the viewer can’t see him, but his presence is looming.\n\nLP Let’s move on to your kaleidoscopic works. In some of your works, the symmetrical visual patterns are constantly transforming into ‘kaleidoscopic’ compositions. What do you intend to show your audience by using this approach?\n\nDM Well, I’d like to start with the first one I did entitled DeCore (aurae). That piece represents a new way of working. I was really interested in sound art – I feel that I’m always working with music even if it’s in videos. It started with me filming plants and then I began manipulating and sampling the images into new organic shapes and putting these back together in a new structure. It took me four years to work out this piece, since it was so tricky to turn it into something interesting. There’s a fine line when working with something that you want the eye to engage with, something that could be viewed as merely decorative. It’s really tricky because it’s so easy to label it decorative and thus redundant. I’m playing with this line and poking fun at it, hence the title DeCore, a play of words for something that’s perhaps decorative and something that’s hard core. I’m pushing this idea of constant rapid movement; the eye is almost always unable to catch the image as it is forever changing.\n\nWhat I found was that proportions are the key. They are the key elements in our experience of something as being visually pleasing or displeasing. With DeCore (aurae), I’m transferring the way I work with sound art and field recordings into visuals. I’m recording images and sampling/manipulating/changing the recordings and layering them whilst creating new structures. When I did this piece, I was thinking of music. I really approached it as if I were making a sound piece – even if it was silent. I was working with the proportions of the shapes in the image, structuring them proportionally as you do when composing notes; creating intervals which are basically just notes structured in certain proportions. I’m making harmonies, structuring the rhythm of the movement and creating colour combinations. But there’s another level, too; usually when I am working, there’s a personal approach and a formal approach. So you can often enter my work from different perspectives. In this instance, the personal connection to the visuals that I started creating really resembles an experience of migraine where I lose my sight. I gradually go completely blind and, as I lose my normal sight, I start to see these colourful organic shapes. A lot of people experience this and it’s called an aura. Each individual experiences it differently but, in my case, it’s like these flashes of lights and colours and shapes that sort of take over my field of vision.\n\nLP Like looking through a prism?\n\nDM Yeah. Exactly. But it’s never the same shape; the shape of the image or the hallucination changes each time.\n\nLP Could you please try and explain to me how, technically, you compose the visuals?\n\nDM Like with DeCore (aurae), it starts with recordings of plants and flowers. Then I take this material and I manipulate the images with filters and effects to create new organic shapes. And then I do it again, and again, and again. This is often how I work. It goes through many different stages of change until I achieve the final shapes. I actually created, like, two hundred new visual flowers that I then used as a base to create new shapes by layering them into new combinations. In DeCore (aurae), you can see the visual flowers as both really big and really small. I manipulated the video so many times, layering it, that I was able create the final structure from a sort of patchwork of video fragments.\n\nLP So you create this composition as you would a piece of music and then there’s a personal level that refers to a health condition that you have: the migraines. The formal element that you mentioned is the rules or the rhythm that you’re incorporating into the repetitions, so to speak?\n\nDM So there’s a structure of forms and colours, of movement and rhythm. There are different things and ideas behind it. One is that I formalise the structure of the visuals in the way I would compose sound on a timeline. For example, the structure of elements moving in a repetitive motion is the same that I might use when constructing a sequence of musical themes or melodies in a musical composition. Another is that, with the continual rapid movement, my idea was to represent the idea of ‘energy’, something that’s never still, constantly moving and changing. Also, the movement is reminiscent of the way I experience the visuals in the migraine hallucinations, the shapes flashing and moving.\n\nLP Yes, but the rhythm is also in the repetition of the gesture that you copy over and over again?\n\nDM Totally. And that’s actually sort of a recurring theme for me, this repetition of patterns.\n\nLP So when you’re fascinated by something that looks like a kaleidoscope, does that refer to your migraines or does that fascination stem from somewhere else?\n\nDM DeCore (aurae) comes from these kinds of hallucinations or what you’d call it. That sort of led me on to exploring geometry and sacred geometry that goes even further, to these alchemist graphs where you have forms or shapes which, when puzzled together, all fit into different combinations. Sacred geometry led me to explore alchemist graphs, which go into a sort of mystical space. The graphs are used as symbols for hidden knowledge in the occult or mystical groups and my fascination with hallucinations comes from the shapes I see, these fractured shapes which are somehow everywhere in nature. This fascination led me on to exploring fractals and from there on to geometry.\n\nIn DeCore (rosen), which is the silver piece, I’m really exploring sacred geometry and the main visual motif is actually created from an alchemist graph. This is the first piece that I created from something else that is not conceived within my own self, but from an image that I found. I’ve actually been collecting images of alchemist graphs for a long time. I didn’t really want to, you know, understand them or try to find a meaning in them, but I still wanted to access them and make them my own. I wanted to absorb the images and then create my own output from those images – and in that way try to understand them. Not by reading exactly what it was supposed to mean, but by assimilating it into my own work. My own process of working with this material.\n\nLP And in what way does Curlicue (spectra) relate to DeCore (aurae) and DeCore (rosen)?\n\nDM They all connect. They all sort of paddle along some road that I’m exploring. In DeCore (aurae), I’m working with these images of plants which exist in the real world. In both DeCore (rosen) and in the Curlicue (spectra), I’m working with an idea of artificial material, material that doesn’t exist in the real world. While in DeCore (aurae), the base material is images of plants, the base material in DeCore (venus) are pearls. In DeCore (rosen) and Curlicue (spectra), the base material is created in a 3D software where I created 3D circular shapes that I used as the material for new constructed shapes used in a more traditional animation technique developed by myself. So the source material is computer-generated, one might call it a non-existing material, but the way I work with it is by using an animation technique. As in the other works, the images and shapes are created through multiple processes.\n\nCurlicue (spectra) is a reference to the migraine hallucinations. This is, so far, my closest attempt at portraying these hallucinations. They are so colourful, almost like bright neon lights. Like if you compare it to the resolution in a video, it’s like 1000K. The resolution is so fine that it’s utterly impossible to portray. Last time I had one I was thinking, “Okay, I’m going to grab a pen and paper and I’m going to draw it.” But when I was actually about to do it, I looked at my pencil and it was like I was drawing with a crayon compared to what I was seeing. It was just impossible to try to capture the colours and the speed of it – as it moves very quickly – it’s almost neurological. It’s very colourful, the whole colour spectrum. There’s also a meditative element to Curlicue (spectra), both in the image and visually. The spiral grows continuously but still contains its shape. There’s movement but still nothing changes. It’s slightly similar to Minerva in terms of dealing with ideas of time and space.\n\nI think we all have an internal visual world that it would be fascinating to shape out in materials, so that we could see each other’s inner visions, which is what I’m really fascinated with. I actually very rarely talk about these hallucinations, because it’s so personal and somehow it’s easier to talk about the formal aspect.\n\nLP I would like to ask you about the women in your films. They look like archetypes in Hollywood productions and you’ve chosen to work with a certain kind of female figure in your films. Could you tell me more about the kind of woman or kind of female figure that appears in your films? For instance, what fascinates you with the crying woman in Madeleine?\n\nDM That’s a very direct Hollywood reference. In Madeleine, I was re- ally, as a performer, taking on the role of the actress. The idea comes from a split desire within myself – as with everybody – to be desired. Women have been portrayed in certain ways in the media and we have an idea of what it is to be desirable. And this stereotype of the desirable woman is something I both want to embody, but it’s also a stereotype that I despise and want to reject. And I despise this desire in myself. As a performer, I’m confronted with this issue and I’m often dealing with my own desire of wanting to be presented in a certain way.\n\nSo, in Madeleine the character is quite ironic, I think. She is glitzed up with the lights, this Hollywood lighting, and make-up, and this pink glittering dress, and then she’s crying. It’s almost like a fetishist kind of crying. It’s almost like she’s enjoying it.\n\nLP Fetishist crying, you call it?\n\nDM Yeah, you know. It’s so over-sentimental that, to me, it’s totally ironic. It’s a character that we know, especially in old Hollywood films – the helpless woman that needs to be rescued.\n\nFor example, in the film Notorious by Hitchcock, Ingrid Berg- man starts out as this strong rebellious female character hunted by the secret service, and then at the end of the movie, she’s giving away all her power and needs to be saved by the male hero. This is the scene where she’s the most beautiful and one experiences the ending as romantic, it’s like the perfect movie ending. It’s quite disturbing to me that we’re so used to these female characters.\n\nLP Does that relate to the female person in Lucy, too?\n\nDM Lucy is a bit different, actually. But they’re still connected, because in there I’m portraying an opera singer. In Madeleine, I’m taking on the role as an actress and, in Lucy, I’m taking on the role as opera singer. In both, there’s this very embarrassing desire that I want to be the actress, and that I want to be the opera singer. It’s really role-play, and it almost goes back to this sort of playing, you know, when you were a kid taking on all these roles. Well, I was just sort of role-playing in my studio, and I just thought, “Okay, I’m not an opera singer. But I want to be an opera singer, so I’m going to make it happen. I’m going to create the space for myself. I’m going to create this world. Nobody else is going to hire me as an opera singer.”\n\nLP But what’s this fascination with opera singers about?\n\nDM I’m really fascinated with tragic heroines and Maria Callas, especially. She’s such an extremely tragic figure. I’m fascinated with these really strong females, like Maria Callas and Jacqueline du Pré, the cellist. I can’t really say why, but I’m just sort of fascinated. Actually, I love Maria Callas so there’s a basic desire in me; I want to put myself in the shoes of Maria Callas and, at the same time as I did that piece, I was really exploring the voice as a phenomenon.\n\nAnd now it goes into film theory; in the cinema, the voice is often used as a character. Especially when it’s a voice that doesn’t have a body, like a narrator, or you hear a voice, but you never see the person. This sort of voice almost becomes supernatural. It has the same qualities as a being that is otherworldly, because it doesn’t have a body. It comes from a writer called Michel Chion. He’s one of my favourite writers. He has a name for this bodyless voice. He calls it the acousmêtre. It’s French and doesn’t translate.\n\nLP What does it mean?\n\nDM The word comes from acousmatic and it actually goes way back to Pythagoras, who used to teach his pupils behind a curtain. So his pupils weren’t allowed to speak, and he used to stand behind the curtain and teach, so that they wouldn’t see him. They could only hear his voice. So it refers to this ancient way of teaching. The followers of Pythagoras were called acousmatics and this bodyless voice is called the acousmêtre. I was really exploring the voice and, at the same time, I created a musical composition. I was working with the voice as a material and as this ‘semi’ being’. When I was developing the piece, I really had to find this voice. The way I’m singing in Lucy is not my usual voice. It was, like, a voice that I had to find or create within myself. I had to look for it and I found this voice within my body, an entity that wasn’t really mine. I’m focusing on the voice as a material; so when I recorded the voice, I did it in close to try and find the grain – the physicality. The physicality is sort of the structure. And then the way that I composed the piece in terms of chords, the way I layered the voices together, I was really trying to create a feeling of light. I don’t know if it makes sense? When I was composing it, the chords and the sonic affect, that I was trying to portray, was light. It’s mastered in surround sound. It’s the experience of a voice floating in space. It’s the voice, it’s like this bodyless entity that moves around the speakers and, as a viewer in space, you’ll feel the voice flying around you.\n\nThe story of the opera is really about this character that has a voice, a voice that seems to be always escaping from the character – or possibly embodying the character. And we can only see the character when the voice, the sound source, is actually coming from the image. It can feel as if you can only see the character when the voice is where the body is, and then it escapes. It’s the drama about this character trying to embody and hold on to this voice. But it’s all disappearing in darkness somehow.\n\nLP Now we’ve been talking a lot about sound and the underestimation of sound in visuals, but you have a film in the exhibition that is soundless, Minerva. Could you please tell me a bit about it and why it’s without sound?\n\nDM I think that silence is as important as sound. I also use silence as a device. I never put sound to an image ‘just because’. Or an image to sound ‘just because’. There always has to be a reason. So if there wasn’t like a purpose for it, then I would rather have it silent – or the other way around.\n\nLP So why is it silent with the owl in Minerva?\n\nDM First of all, I don’t think that sound adds anything to it. But the thing about Minerva is that there’s this owl that’s sort of continually flying, but it’s not going anywhere. It’s in this sort of dark space. Or not even space. It’s out of time and out of space. There’s no sound. It’s this other dimension which is outside of out of time and out of space. Minerva is really about time and space. Or the absence of time and space. The way I approached Minerva, actually, is how I would approach drawing.\n\nLP How is that?\n\nDM Often when you draw, it comes straight as an idea and you draw it down. The drawing is a bit more spontaneous. I think it took me 2-3 months to create Minerva, working day and night, which is like the fastest piece I’ve ever done. Timewise, if you compare, like, a drawing with a painting, to me, Minerva is like a drawing, even though it took, like, 2-3 months. Like a quick sketch.\n\nVariations by Dodda Maggý at BERG Contemporary\n\nart*zine\n\nErin Honecutt\n\nAugust 2017\n\nDodda Maggý’s exhibition Variations is on view at BERG Contemporary from August 18th to October 21st. The artist was recently awarded the ARoS – Aarhus Art Museum’s Young Talent Award. Using sound and music as departure points, the artist further compounds their intertwining by using rhythm and narrative to engage the senses. Her animated symmetrical compositions explore the experimental possibilities of translating sound into visual form with a technical mastery of the formalities of harmonics and how these form the basic formations of the universe. With a dynamic interplay between the parts and the whole in the image, the patterns appear as though in perpetual evolution, like a kaleidoscope. In an in-depth interview, the artist explains her complex working methods as we walked amongst her work.\n\nErin: Can you tell me about this piece (DeCore (etude))?\n\nDodda: So this is an ongoing series called DeCore that started in 2008. When it started as a video I was working with methods of applying field recordings and sounds to video. I basically went around with my video camera and filmed flowering plants and trees and then started to manipulate that material to create new organic forms. The first version, which was called DeCore (aurae), took me three years to figure out the right form. I was thinking a lot about visual music as well as synesthesia, the state of having your senses crossed that causes people to see music or experience forms as colors. I was applying these methods and sounds to video and also thinking about how to represent music. DeCore was then installed as a large silent installation, followed by another version, and now I’m showing two of the newest versions here, DeCore (etude), and DeCore (loom). It’s the same source material of trees and flowering plants, actually.\n\nI’m continuing to resample in this exhibition. However, I’m not re-sampling the works themselves but going back into the source material and making new manipulations- almost a remix of the original recordings. With this piece, I actually wanted to take the source material and create print stills. It’s another thing to really create the image rather than take a still, so I created the video in order to take the still image.\n\nThere is a lot of crossing of mediums in the show. I wanted to create a technique in order to create prints as this is my first show exhibiting prints. Usually, I’m only working with video, music, and sounds so I had to create a technique that I could relate to in order to create still images. When you’re used to working with time-based art, which is always moving, you have to recalibrate how to translate this movement into a still image.\n\nErin: It’s going from 3D to 2D, so of course, it’s a huge recalibration.\n\nDodda: You have to think about it differently. So this is like the DeCore series but evolved. I’m still thinking about music here and I think music is still the understory of everything I do. I start with music before visual arts.\n\nErin: You studied both right visual art and composition, right?\n\nDodda: I studied both. Before I went to university I felt like I had to make a decision between going further into music or visual art and I chose visual art because I felt there was space for both. Later, I finished studies in composition as well. I think as a visual artist, I really connected with video and this time-based medium because I understand it as it relates to music.\n\nErin: It’s as though your process of making videos is an image of harmonics itself, so your work is both in the medium and the resulting image.\n\nDodda: That’s my aim, but we can debate whether it comes forth. In this piece with these small sorts of flowers, each flower is made out of many recordings of flowers, so there are many details combined. In just one little flower there are multiple processes happening at once. I like the size of it because you can see the details.\n\nErin: You’re making your own language, it seems, by working with each note in itself and making them work together to become its own vocabulary. What programs are you using?\n\nDodda: I use a lot of programs of all kinds and am mixing all of them. It’s my own method of layering that I developed with many variations.\n\nErin: The last exhibition here at BERG was of Steina and Woody Vasulka, the video art pioneers. They were some of the first to make tools that would manipulate audio into visual and vice versa.\n\nDodda: There is definitely this link. Steina actually was also trained as a violinist first. Having a background in music seems to be the case with a lot of video artists, especially in Iceland.\n\nErin: Narrative and rhythm seem to be two intertwining themes in the exhibition, each carrying the other forward.\n\nDodda: That is definitely the case with the videos, especially this one that I’m making to create prints from. I’m making the videos with this musical application and thinking about proportions. Just like with different chord combinations and sounds that make major and minor chords, we also have these proportions visually which create tension or harmony in the image so there is also geometry involved. I’m applying a set of movements to this, as well as colors obviously. This is much more monotone, I would say, but maybe baroque monotone. The first DeCore had each frame changing and was more chaotic but this is more still. It holds the shape but it still changes in color. This looks a lot like rhythms, almost like beats.\n\nErin: I was reading another an early article about your work about how your work engages the viewer visually but the rhythm engages your body, so it somehow traps you between these two states of being when you’re watching it. Perhaps this was more the DeCore installation when the viewer could be part of the projection and be very physical, but I think it still has a very mesmerizing effect on both body and mind.\n\nDodda: I’m very interested in these sensorial effects. My earlier work was more portraying these different states while now I’m more interested in creating this effect for the viewer. I know I can never estimate how the effect will be on the viewer, but I can stimulate some senses, definitely.\n\nErin: Where does the name DeCore come from?\n\nDodda: DeCore comes from something on the verge of being decorative, which is a total taboo. When I starting working on DeCore in 2008, to do something decorative or visually appealing was almost like porn. So I’m playing with crossing that line and questioning if it being visually appealing makes it less interesting. I’m playing with these aesthetics about how the proportions and harmonies bring affects. It’s also on a fine line to do something flowery so there is also a play on that. There is so much information in each frame, really, so I’m just pumping information out.\n\nErin: Isn’t it like that with music? Why is music allowed to be harmonious but not visual art?\n\nDodda: It goes in circles. After the Second World War, Romantic music was just not allowed. So, really serious, atonal music came into fashion because this Romantic music was connected to nationalism and it was totally out. It really just goes in circles depending on what is accepted at the time, beautiful music or atonal music. I think there’s been a shift in the last ten years, although it’s almost hard to say this out loud. I feel a shift from a focus on very theoretical to a slightly more Romantic, or more spiritual aesthetic. I think the themes I have been flirting with are actually being more accepted whereas before they were a little bit ‘outsider’.\n\nErin: I think it is definitely a noticeable shift.\n\nDodda: I don’t know if it is a trend, but it is definitely more accepted. Even before, to talk about energy, was a bit out there. It wasn’t really what my teachers were going for when I was in school, either. I can’t generalize it but I can definitely feel a shift in the atmosphere of what is going on and what is accepted.\n\nErin: The new age needs a new age, it seems. Is all of the work in the exhibition a variation of DeCore?\n\nDodda: No, there are three variations. We have three main pieces: DeCore, C Series, and Étude. Moving from DeCore to C Series, I am really continuing to investigate this relationship between the visual and the aural. I was interested in making a technique of composing using video and music but here I am much more in composition mode. I’m studying the flute as an instrument. I picked fifteen notes to work with and composed them in this one composition that is part of the exhibition, a nearly 18-minute long piece.\n\nI made these video forms, a circular form with different proportions, for each of the 15 musical notes. Then, I connected each note to this form and I created a video animation with the music corresponding to what is happening in the video. With each composition, I pair a note to a form, which creates the musical composition. Later, I decided to remove the video and compose on the base of sound. I have one video from this process, but I’m only going to show the notes. When I was making the composition, I made another video from the same source material which became Coil, a part of C Series.\n\nC Series is the focal point for the composition and so the accompaniment for the music, but then in the working process, I realized I didn’t need it. I’m just showing the music, like a work in progress, that shows how I composed this piece. If we go into the purely musical side of it, it appears as though I’m working in music. However, I’m not that interested in just composing. I’m interested in detuning.\n\nWe have this modern way of tuning instruments at 440 hertz. All instruments are tuned after that, but there is an older tuning at 432 hertz. When we tune after that the harmonics are a little more balanced. There are a lot of different theories about why we changed it, mostly conspiracy theories, but no one is really sure. So the tuning today is a little bit harder. You can see in visuals of chords how the frequencies make different forms.\n\nI was thinking about how interesting this conflict is and wanted to start to detune my notes. I’m working from the range of 440 down to 432 up to 448 hertz so my instrument is mistuned. What happens when you have these fine misattunements is you get these frequencies that meet and give off all these vibrations, overtones, and new frequencies that erupt. Even if it is fifty notes, and three octaves, they are all in a different tuning and when they meet they create this friction. I also took the notes I created and manipulated into each of these movable forms. I changed the speed of the vibration, so it was shaped by how quickly the note reverberated.\n\nAs you can see, I’m really going into the material and treating musical notes as material. Each note is carefully created and then manipulated. Afterwards, I layer them and compose them together. You can hear this piece on the record and you can also see these two projections in these two projections on the wall. They are still part of the piece and part of them will be in the daylight, so they kind of disappear into the light in a mystical way.\n\nErin: Can you explain this visual (the animated projection in C Series) a bit and how it correlates to your vertical investigations?\n\nDodda: So the music is a vertical investigation and that’s the translation from lyrical film where I’ve been working in video with this vertical investigation with video that I’ve been applying to music as well. This piece is the one I made after the composition was finished and is actually a result from starting DeCore and investigating proportions, going into geometry, and alchemist’s graphs. This is actually created from an alchemist’s graph and shows an Egyptian energy key. I don’t make my work after other images, though, I have three works where I’m working with alchemists’ graphs. Usually, I never use outside material but I was just interested in these geometric images that have this visual energy to them. There is some message being told and I’m not exactly interested in finding out what it is supposed to tell me but I’m interested in the energy of them. That is why I wanted to assimilate it into my own process.\n\nErin: The name of it even, ‘alchemist’s graph’, sounds like a parallel investigation to the work you’re doing. What an alchemist does is tries to transmute gold out of these chemical elements.\n\nDodda: But it’s all symbolic in the end. When they’re talking about gold they’re actually trying to find spiritual gold. It’s spiritual, not material. Alchemist’s search for gold was sacred knowledge.\n\nErin: Even that transition between material and spiritual knowledge and matter is like a parallel investigation to what you’re doing.\n\nDodda: Especially in this one because I’m working with the base material in C Series which is actually these 3D computer generated spheres. I basically took snapshots of 3d images and took them through a very 2d way of working, almost to this old school level of animation. So I’m working with this artificial form to create this alchemist’s key. To me, it feels like energy plugged into this loop. It also reminds me of the music symbol where you have an F key or G key and you ascribe a key to your composition.\n\nI’m also breaking a lot of musicology rules here by playing with terminology and using it inaccurately on purpose. The tradition is such a long one and can be quite fixed, so it is perhaps good to playfully skew it a little. I also did this with Études by really playing with the terminology. We’ll be releasing a record on the opening, a limited edition vinyl of 30 editions that will also be on Spotify. I’ve been working with music for such a long time and it has been such a nice experience, materializing these prints, so releasing the prints and materials and music as materials is quite exciting.\n\nErin: You’re working in such an immaterial realm, so I can imagine it is exciting to have such a material outcome in an exhibition.\n\nDodda: It’s a new development in my work for sure. Here are the different forms of the notes for C Series, screened as just a small projection in the exhibition. I find the musical compositions much more interesting than the visuals actually. The original animation I made doesn’t add anything to the composition so when I’m working with video and music together there always has to be a purpose. If there is no reason I usually take it out as I would rather have silent videos or stand alone sound pieces. You can see this is just how a material note might materialize. I’m just opening up ideas of what music might be. This almost could be presented as a sound piece as I’m working with sound ideas even though it is silent.\n\nErin: This is a similar shape to the Mandelbrot set, a fractal named after the mathematician. Anytime you zoom in or out into one specific part you come out eventually into the same shape for infinity.\n\nDodda: You can find it in nature and in the cosmos. The environment is just the basic building block of everything around this fractal relationship. Even in these snapshots of planets of stars, it’s always fractals. Even the path Venus moves around the sun is a fractal. It makes one wonder how everything is connected to these forms.\n\nErin: You can look at your work very formally. You don’t have to go there, but it’s laid out for you if you want to, however you can also just recognize the mathematical and musical harmony in the formalities.\n\nDodda: If people are interested in certain subject matters they pick it up or they don’t. There are different perspectives of looking at my work- very formal, very sensorial, and sometimes working with more mystical ideas. I’m always questioning and never offering answers.\n\nErin: You’re still very technical in your mystical notions, which is a beautiful combination.\n\nDodda: The last part of the exhibition is called Étude for which the basic building blocks are these Opal forms. There are different investigations into visual music which started in the 1910s and 20s by visual artists trying to find ways of composing music visually. It’s hard to define as a genre because it crosses all these styles between animation and structural film, but the umbrella term is ‘visual music’ which began in Europe and was developed later in California. One experimental filmmaker, in particular, was intriguing for me, John Whitney. He regarded himself as a composer but his instrument was the camera. He spent his career trying to develop ways of translating visuals into music. So I was quite inspired by his technique and wanted to experiment with his technique to apply it to my own experimentation. So I’m not duplicating but I am interested in how he structures entities together in a visual. I think there is definitely a visual reference to his work in Étude. Étude pays a little bit of an homage to him in the name Étude, which is usually a musical composition that a skilled composer creates for his student to practice. I’m using it as an exercise for practicing visual music.\n\nI want to make a visual music piece in this tradition and so I regard this as my practice piece in visual music with a certain methodology. I’m also making a wordplay between the use of “Opus” in music which stands for the “work number” and is written as Op. In Étude, Op. stands for the number of opal stones, so the first piece is actually 88 Op. I’m also examining the piano in particular by working with 88 stones which represent the 88 notes of the piano.\n\nIn the Étude series of prints, you can see the full 88 notes, as well as compositions with 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, and 77. So I’m making up these rules, imagining how to materialize chords into a visual. I created these seven structures that are in the composition and I these as my elements in the installation. So this is a very formal piece but the idea actually came from a dream. In the dream, somebody took me up to the cosmos into black space and showed me opals growing in the darkness. I was being told that they have energy and frequency. So I was quite intrigued by these stones mined from the earth that have a measurable frequency. So even if it was a dream, it is still quite formal, personal, yet very formal. I was also interested in working with the relationship between the visual and the sonic/aural/musical in this piece and exploring perceptual experiences involved in translating internal experiences into the external to represent different states of consciousness.\n\nErin: This cultural critic named Gene Youngblood wrote a book in the 70’s called Expanded Cinema about how all of these expansive techniques in film have been parallel with the expansion of consciousness.\n\nDodda: Compared to where video was in 2000, you had to have a video camera and know how to use it, but today it’s totally part of our daily life. It’s so interesting how video is the same material as our memory, like our current state of consciousness.\n\nTemperatures\n\nFeminism Now?! – A two-part exhibition at Babel and Galleri Blunk\n\nSolveig Lønmo\n\nTranslated by Kjetil Myskja and Birgit Kvamme Lundheim\n\nTrondheim, March 5 – 11 2007\n\nWe define temperatures in terms of differences and oppositions; warmth is seen in opposition to cold. Our conception of the world around us is to a large extent structured by oppositions or dichotomies. The relationship between two contrasts can be described by pointing out the presence or absence of something. We are often not conscious of the value judgements inherent in the oppositions. Almost always, a hierarchy will be created, where one side is assigned positive characteristics, while the other one tends to be described through negative or less positively charged adjectives.\n\nBoth naturally and culturally, the Man/Woman dichotomy is a central one in the basic structure upon which our western society is founded. Along with post-structuralism, feminism has tried to unsettle and make us aware of the hierarchical thinking which to a very strong degree has permeated our ideas of the sexes. The art exhibition “Feminism Now?!” intends to find the bearings of feminism’s present position. What is feminism today, and where is it heading? How hot is the topic today? Have things cooled down? How will 18 young, Nordic artists comment on feminism in today’s situation?\n\n“To me, feminism is a room, in which I am allowed to bring to light problems, systems, structures, constructions, habits and norms. Where I can criticize them, try to remake them, change them, cancel them.” Thus says Thea Veronica von der Maase, one of the exhibitors. She wants to “bring to light, criticize, cancel”; she wants to show us the disparities between the sexes, and she wants to deconstruct our habitual perceptions. Just as the slash in the opposition Man/Woman, her artwork is a barrier, the kind used to enclose an area and mark divisions. However, von der Maase’s barrier is soft and limp; it is made from felt and wadding and lies collapsed and useless on the floor. It no longer works the way it is supposed to, and we can easily step across it. It is far from virile. Should we perhaps lower the slash: Man_Woman?\n\nMale artists were encouraged to submit works for “Feminism Now?!” (Are there others beside me that find the term “male artist” irritatingly unfamiliar? “Artist” is traditionally perceived to be a male, and we still haven’t got rid of this expectation. It is never mentioned specifically that an artist is male. “Female artist”, however, is commonly used to point to the fact that, “Hey, this time the artist is a woman!” As an exception from the rule.) However, it may not be unexpected that the great majority of the submissions come from women. One of the relatively few male contributors is Klas Hallerstrand, who shows a baseball bat. Masculine – yes, certainly, a bat may stand for something virile, sporty, active, and even for something violent. On the other side of the slash stands the feminine and passive, and the position of a victim. But Hallerstrand has decorated the bat with silk yarn in soft colours. Thus,he has stepped across von der Maase’s barrier. The bat gains a new dimension; it has been repositioned from the masculine to the feminine sphere, and thus becomes a strange and ambivalent element in the exhibition. A similar crossover between spheres is made in Yvonne Normanseth’s works, which consist of embroidered graffiti. It is hard to think of a greater contrast to embroidery than tagging and street art. The rough, quick and dangerous against the well behaved, painstaking and safe. Trend versus tradition. And the masculine versus the feminine. Such associations lie just below the surface, whether we want it or not, and it is difficult for us to rid ourselves of our accustomed thought-patterns. Such art can, if nothing else, make us conscious of our straitjackets.\n\nThe artists Naja Lundstrøm and Troels Lundstrøm make an interesting and sly comment on the exhibition concept. They have both submitted photographs of themselves. Their applications are almost identical. Troels writes, “Hi! I am interested in seeing what my chances are as a male artist to be included in the exhibition “Feminism Now”… Naja wants to see what her chances to be included are as a female artist. Their pictures are conspicuously similar… you choose for yourself what you want to believe. We can let this be a comment on the topical question of quotas. What if 10% of all artworks in all exhibitions had to be made by men? In this case, the 10% male representation is safeguarded by Klas Hallerstrand and Troels Lundstrom.\n\nWe have so far focused on stereotypical feminine qualities like passivity, innocence, frugality and on women’s role as bearers of traditions. However, the Femme fatale is another version of the feminine. She is someone over whom man has no control, and she is both frightening and destructive (we will here disregard the fact that this female stereotype has also been also sexualized and objectified.) We meet her in Hanna Paulin’s video works. An outdoorswoman aims her gun straight at us and fires. And it is not at all Cupid’s arrows that strike us. Here, we are drawn into the work of art, and into a dangerous world in which girls shoot – watch out all men! The femme fatale is also extremely flirtatious. In her video, Camilla L. Haukedal flirts with Joseph Beuys himself. Beuys is the prototype of a mysterious, masculine artist genius – active and avant garde. Haukedal consults him on how to become a better artist. The encounter moves in a slightly comical direction by and by, and it is Beuys who becomes the comic figure: he is demystified and becomes almost cute. Simultaneously, the artist plays so heavily on her feminine charm that she limits herself, and thus questions how imbalanced patterns are maintained by both camps.\n\nIs it possible to escape prejudices and culturally determined standards for how to relate to members of the opposite sex? One of Lise Stålspets’ videos chooses as a point of departure the Greek myth about Apollo and Daphne. Apollo is head over heels in love with fair Daphne, but she does not reciprocate his love. He chases her, and she implores the gods to save her from being caught. They grant her prayers by transforming her into a tree. She has to pay an unreasonably high price for being left in peace. In her video, Stålspets allows Dapne to escape both Apollo and the passive existence of a tree.\n\nFor many it is difficult to avoid the cultural standards of femininity when our popular culture is permeated by feminine ideals that only a few may live up to. Listen carefully to ridiculous lyrics and see the vulgarly wiggling bottoms in music videos. Maria Meinild Nielsen has focused on Britney Spears’ lyrics. She transforms the pop lyrics to texts dealing with serious existential questions by having real, mature girls present them as if though they were their own thoughts. The acting in this video is impressive, and the texts have gained a vulnerable, solemn quality that the originals never possessed. The same sense of vulnerability is found in Dodda Maggy’s powerful video. Here the vulnerability is not anything weak or “feminine” in a negative sense, it is rather something more forceful than the most macho action painting. Iris jumps up and down in a bed, in slow motion. Maggy has also made the accompanying music, music that underlines the power of this poetical video. In the middle of the video there is a black pause, giving emphasis to what follows: Iris falls sideways into the bed, over and over again. She is virtually thrown into it. The overall impression is that of playfulness. Or of violence. By and by, it becomes impossible not to think of violence. The offender is not seen, but his or her presence can still be perceived. Iris keeps her mouth shut. We are never told about what goes on. Too often violence and abuse continue without being discovered by the surroundings.\n\nAs the exhibition demonstrates, feminism is still a hot topic. And if art related to feminism, as Dodda Maggy’s video, can have an influence on gender- related social problems, feminism should absolutely continue to be a hot issue. We’ll see if the temperature will rise to boiling hot in the course of the festival week. It’s a pleasure to record the quality of the contemporary art presented in “Feminism Now?!” So let us overcome the fear that women often harbour, the fear of expressing ourselves squarely and plainly; let us remove the hesitant question mark and shout “Feminism Now!”\n\nVideo/Music\n\nVane\n\nPaul Usherwood\n\n2 March – 1 April 2006\n\nDodda Maggý creates a series of female characters based on personal experiences, which are then enacted in front of a video camera, accompanied by piano music composed and played by herself, sometimes re-worked using a simple recording technique, building layers as if sculpting. She creates audiovisual narratives that objectify the female body without degrading it to the status of a mere object. Digitally manipulated in post-production the characters are eerily illuminated and set within a void space, adding to the theatrical nature of the work. She edits the video in the same manner as one composes music; with highs and lows and a certain rhythm designed to create tension and heightened emotions. This method allows the work to communicate self and body as experienced in a context where existence is challenged or threatened.\n\nBoth video and music have the ability to construct narrative. Maggý uses both to attract her audience’s attention and then hold it until the end of the piece. She deliberately stretches the limit of how far she can take a certain emotion, sometimes to the point of being over-dramatic, leaving the viewer unclear as to her exact intentions – is she being serious or joking? This ambiguity gives the audience space to draw their own conclusions as to what the work is about.\n\n‘Video/Music’ brings together two video works by the artist. Stella (2004) consists of two projections, back to back. In the first projection, a female character is shown walking, aware of being watched. Initially, she appears to enjoy the attention and flirts with the viewer. However, she gradually becomes uncomfortable with the gaze and frantically tries to escape it. In the second projection, two girls hop up and down in slow motion. As they take their bunny hoods off it transpires they are identical. They continue to jump euphorically and end up on the ground, touching and flirting with each other.\n\nIn Margret (2005), a small monitor shows a girl dancing in circles against a black background. She is reminiscent of a figurine in a music box, a ballerina on stage, or a woman dancing in a peepshow. In between advancing and retreating, she falls down repeatedly. Close-ups are evocative of melodramatic scenes from the black and white silent days of early cinema. The process is both enchanting and slightly disturbing to watch. One might think of it as a metaphor for the process of experimental creation: you begin somewhere, fall and stand up again, fall, stand up and so on.\n\nThe dramas and dilemmas of the desiring gaze emerge as a main theme of Dodda Maggy’s two video installations in this exhibition.\n\nStella (2004) comes in two parts. Part one begins with two girls bouncing up and down against a black background on what is probably a trampoline. Slow motion and a Debussy-ish piano score of tumbling scales and arpeggios (specially composed and performed by the artist) combine to suggest the intoxicating fun they are having. However, we soon discover this is not just the Billy Elliot-ish fun of bouncing up and down; it’s also the joy of simply being together. They clearly find each other irresistible. And this is confirmed by the closing scene where the two of them are shown sitting on the ground, gazing into each other’s eyes.\n\nSo what is their relationship? Are they lovers? Are they identical sisters? Is one of them the doppelgänger of the other – the kind of perfect imaginary friend that some children like to invent? Certainly, although they wear different coloured T-shirts and leggings, in many ways they seem uncannily alike. Before we can get any answers, however, the second part of the piece on the wall opposite starts up.\n\nThe lack of a sound track in part two seems to confirm that the young woman whose face we watch has a very different mood. Like the ‘girls’ in part one this character is also played by the artist. However, this is not immediately apparent. On the contrary, initially she seems happy enough to be the object of another’s (the viewer’s) gaze as she walks along. Her jewellery, hair and make-up suggest she is at an event of some kind, a film premiere perhaps, and she’s confident she’s looking good. Gradually though we realize she finds the viewer’s attentions intrusive, even threatening and the second part of the work ends with her in obvious distress walking faster and faster, and finally breaking into a run,\n\nin a desperate attempt to escape.\n\nIt might seem therefore from this description that Stella is a pretty straightforward exercise in fetishistic scopophilia, albeit the narrative in each part remains unresolved. Indeed, the moment when terrified and tearful the young woman tries to hide from view might be seen as distinctly Hitchcockian in character. However, it does not come across like that. This is mostly because of the way the two parts are projected: not in a conventional manner but one after another, on opposite walls of the gallery. For what this does is ensure that at a certain moment we are obliged to turn and face in a new direction: a simple device but one that means that we feel estranged from the narrative; we have to engage with it in a way which is active rather than passive.\n\nA similar Brechtian device occurs in the other work in the exhibition, Margret (2005). Here what prevents us from becoming immersed in the narrative is the fact that we have to listen to the accompanying soundtrack through headphones and have to view the image on a monitor that is just a few centimeters across. Because it’s so tiny all we are able to make out is a tiny white speck in the dark. However, when, rather clumsily, the camera moves in closer it becomes clear what this is. It is a young woman in slightly childish clothes (the infantilized woman again) spinning round and round, playing that game beloved of small children where you spin round until you make yourself dizzy and cannot stand up anymore.\n\nI say ‘game’ because initially, as we watch her spin round, fall to the ground, get up, and start spinning again that is how it seems. Indeed, for a while it is possible to imagine a smile playing on her lips. However, as the sequence repeats itself not just once, but two, three times, this hardly seems appropriate. It is evident she has lost control and is continuing more or less against her will.\n\nBut why? What drives her on? At one level it could be the music we hear on the headphones for the impression is that this is being played by some invisible piano-playing authority figure. It is melodious but the way it is repeated over and over has a relentless, domineering quality. However, perhaps it is not so much this as we ourselves who are responsible for her ordeal. How come? Well, there is something about the business of viewing her ‘game’ on a tiny screen that makes one feel like a scientist in charge of an animal experiment or a pleasure-seeker operating an end-of-the-pier peepshow or one of those pirouetting ballerinas in a wind-up music box that you play with as a child.\n\nIs Margret therefore in some way a feminist reflection on the role cinema plays in the construction of the image of woman? Interestingly, the fact that the woman wears starkly black and white clothes coupled with the slightly hammy, theatrical way she throws up her hands every time she falls to the ground and the clumsy camera movement gives the piece a decidedly archaic, early-cinema feel. It does seem therefore as if we are being asked to consider the way in which during its history cinema as an apparatus has served to manage pleasure for its viewers in accordance with the psychic formations of masculine sexuality positioning woman as image and man as the bearer of the look, as Laura Mulvey’s famous essay puts it. Indeed, in common with Stella, Margret might be read as an illustration of Mulvey’s thesis that in patriarchal culture the image of woman is “bound by the symbolic in which man can live out his fantasies and obsession through linguistic command imposing them on the silent image of woman still tied to her place as bearer and not maker of meanings”."
