        "text": "Fine-tune your speaking and writing skills\n\nThis course is for you if you are already an advanced English student, but you would like to develop your English speaking and writing skills even further. Perhaps you haven't used your English for a while and you lack confidence and/or need a brush-up. On this course, we will improve your spoken fluency by discussing thought-provoking news stories taken from leading current affairs publications supplemented by YouTube excerpts to inspire debate.\n\nThe topics we discuss include the rise of AI, work/life balance, health, the importance of music in our lives, the attraction of the nomadic lifestyle and transportation of the future.\n\nIn each lesson, we focus on broadening your vocabulary and improving your pronunciation through, for example, studying syllables and word stress, prefixes and suffixes and the definitions of new words.\n\nThree written assignments will be given for homework. These will be discursive essays based on the topics discussed in the lessons. We focus on how to structure your writing and you will receive feedback from your teacher on grammar, spelling and style. Additional homework will be in the form of advanced vocabulary exercises.\n\nThis is not a grammar course, so your teacher will give you relatively brief explanations about grammatical mistakes, although you also have the opportunity to receive extra material that focuses on identified mistakes. You can complete these extra exercises for homework.\n\nSome lessons will be based on tasks, which have been developed by the teachers to get you to talk together as much as possible.\n\nTeaching material\n\nYou don't need to buy a book for this course. Your teacher will select suitable material, which is included in the price.\n\nOverview of the course layout and material\n\nYou will receive access to our online digital platform, Moodle, which provides a comprehensive overview of the entire course. You will also be able to contact your classmates and discuss the activities taking place in your class.\n\nOn Moodle you can:\n\nsee the plan for the course, the individual teaching sessions and homework\n\nsee teaching materials including extra materials such as videos\n\ncommunicate with your teacher and your fellow students\n\nfollow up and catch up on lessons missed if you are absent during the course\n\nPreparation time: approx. 1-2 hours including the written assignments.\n\nThere is a maximum of 16 students in this class.\n\nThere is no teaching on September 13 or November 8."
