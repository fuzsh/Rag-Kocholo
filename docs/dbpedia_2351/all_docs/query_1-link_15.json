Schein, was first printed in a little pamphlet with the hymn, “Machs mit mir, Gott, nach deiner Gut,” and later it appeared in Schein’s Cantional, Leipzig, 1645. In Schein’s Choralgesänge there are two arrangements by J. S. Bach. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Mach’s mit mir, Gott” is by Johann Hermann Schein, 1628. It is based on an older melody, set to the hymn “Ein wahrer Glaub’ Gottes Zorn stillt” in Bartholomäus Gesius’s Geistliche Deutsche Lieder, etc., Frankfurt a. d. O.,1607. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMACHT HOCH DIE TÜR (FREYLINGHAUSEN) ◊ 92\n\nThe most popular tune for this hymn is by Johann A. Freylinghausen. It appeared in his Neues Geistreiches Gesangbuch, Halle, 1704. Some musicians think it is a recast of Crüger’s tune by the same name “in the Freylinghausen manner”; others consider it an original melody. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMAGDALEN ◊ 197\n\nThe melody (Magdalene) is by Sir John Stainer, and was composed especially for this hymn for The revised Edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1875. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMARIA HUN ER EN JOMFRU REN ◊ 268\n\nThe melody was written by the Danish organist and composer, Johan Christian Gebauer (b. Copenhagen, 1808; d. ibid. 1884), for the hymn “Du Herre Krist, min Frelser est.” The first four measures are repeated. Lindeman’s Koralbog has two melodies, the one being taken from Kingo’s Gradual, 1699, the other being composed by Lindeman. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMaster of eager youth ◊ 183\n\n??? This hymn is a rather free translation, if it can be called that, of one of our oldest Christian hymns, attributed to Clement of Alexandria, beginning with the line Stomion pwlwn adawn.\n\nIt was appended to the second of Clement’s great trilogy, The Tutor.\n\nHenry M.Dexter declared that after he first translated the Greek text of Clement’s into prose, he “transfused as much of its language and spirit” as he could into the verse. This was in 1846. While he was preparing a sermon from the text Deut. 32:7: “Remember the days of old” on “Some Prominent Characteristics of the Early Christians,” he wrote the hymn in order that it might be used in the service. The hymn was first printed in The Congregationalist, December 21, 1849. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMay God be praised* ◊ 327\n\n(See: O Lord, we praise Thee)\n\nMay God bestow on us His grace ◊ 591\n\nEs woll’ uns Gott genädig sein\n\nUnd seinen Segen geben;\n\nSein Antlitz uns mit hellem Schein\n\nErleucht’ zum ew’gen Leben,\n\nDass wir erkennen seine Werk’,\n\nUnd was ihm liebt auf Erden,\n\nUnd Jesus Christus Heil und Stärk’\n\nBekannt den Heiden werden\n\nUnd sie zu Gott bekehren.\n\nSo danken, Gott, und loben dich\n\nDie Heiden überalle,\n\nUnd alle Welt, die freue sich\n\nUnd sing’ mit grossem Schalle,\n\nDass du auf Erden Richter bist\n\nUnd lässt die Sünd’ nicht walten\n\nDein Wort die Hut und Weide ist,\n\nDie alles Volk erhalten.\n\nIn rechter Bahn zu wallen.\n\nEs danke, Gott. und lobe dich\n\nDas Volk in guten Taten;\n\nDas Land bringt Frucht und bessert sich,\n\nDein Wort ist wohl geraten.\n\nUns segne Vater und der Sohn,\n\nUns segne Gott der Heil’ge Geist\n\nDem alle Welt die Ehre tu’,\n\nVor ihm sich fürchte allermeist.\n\nNun sprecht von Herzen: Amen!\n\nThis is Martin Luther’s Ps. 67, rewritten as a New Testament missionary hymn. It first appeared, without a tune, at the end of Luther’s Ein weise christlich Mess zuhalte, Wittenberg, and in Eyn Enchiridion, Erfurt, 1524. The melody, “Es woll’ uns Gott genädig sein” was first coupled with the text in Teutsch Kirchenamt, Strassburg, 1525. The composer is unknown. It is the first missionary hymn of Protestantism. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nTHE 67th Psalm furnished the inspiration for this hymn by Dr. Martin Luther. It was evidently printed in 1523-1524 in a leaflet together with “Aus tiefer Noth” (Out of the depths I cry to Thee. L. H. 273), and shortly after the text was published in Luther’s Ein weyse Christliche Messe zu halten und zum Tisch Gottis zu gehen, Wittenberg, 1524. The same year it was also published in Eyn Enchiridion; from this it passed into all the German hymnals. Klaus Mortensøn translated it into Danish and added a closing stanza (see Landst. 28). This version was used in the Malmø Hymnary of 1533 and later in the editions of H. Thomissøn, Kingo, and Pontoppidan. Landstad’s and Hauge’s versions are somewhat different. The revised hymn book of the former Norwegian Synod follows in the main Mortensøn’s translation.\n\nIn connection with this hymn the story is told from Magdeburg that one of the citizens, an old clothier, gathered people in the marketplace by singing and selling this hymn together with the companion hymn, “Out of the depths I cry to Thee.” The burgomaster had him arrested, but he was released following a demonstration of protest staged by the citizens. Two months later the people of Magdeburg put through the Reformation in their city. The hymn was sung by the army of Gustavus Adolphus on the morning of the battle of Lutzen, November 6, 1632. Both this hymn and “A Mighty Fortress is our God” were sung to the accompaniment of trumpets and kettle-drums. Ludvig Holberg relates that the hymn was sung by a child during the night before the introduction of the Reformation in Helsingør. The hymnologist, James Mearns, says that Luther remodeled the Old Testament Psalm into a New Testament missionary hymn and adds, “It was therefore fitting that it should be sung at the opening service during the dedication of the mission church in Trichinopoli, India, July 11, 1792. The service was conducted by C. F. Schwartz. “\n\nBesides 14 English translations there are numerous versions in Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, French, Portuguese, Latin, and other languages. The version in The Lutheran Hymnary is by Richard Massie, born 1800, in Chester, England. In 1854 he published in London Martin Luther’s Spiritual Songs. His Lyra Domestica, London, 1860 and 1864, contains Spitta’s and other German hymns in English translation. He also translated many German hymns for Mercer’s Church Psalter and Hymn Book. Massie died March 11, 1887. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMEIN SCHÖPFER, STEH MIR BEI ◊ 513\n\nJohann J. Rambach published this hymn in his Poetische Festgedanken, 1729. It was accepted in the Hannoverisches Gesang Buch, 1740, together with the tune “Mein Schoepfer, steh mir bei” by Franz Heinrich Meyer, to which is has since been wedded. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMEINEN JESUM LASS ICH NICHT (DARMSTADT) ◊ 88, 426\n\nThe tune “Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht” is found in the Darmstadt hymnal, Neuverfertigtes Gesangbuch, 1699, set to the text of the hymn beginning with that line, “Jesus I will never leave”. The composer is unknown. It has long been a popular melody.\n\n\\\\\n\nMEINEN JESUM LASS ICH NICHT (HAMMERSCHMIDT) ◊ 362\n\nMELITA (NAVY HYMN*) ◊ 418\n\nMENDELSSOHN ◊ 125\n\nThe melody (Mendelssohn) was mainly borrowed from Mendelssohn’s Festgesang by W. H. Cummings in 1855, and has gradually taken the place of all melodies formerly used. It is said that Mendelssohn himself wished to use this melody for words other than those for which it was originally written, and that he also considered it unsuitable for a religious text. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Mendelssohn” is from the Festgesang for Male Chorus and Orchestra, composed for, and first sung at, the festival held in Leipzig, June, 1840, to celebrate the invention of printing. Dr. W. H. Cummings, organist at Waltham Abbey, adapted the tune for this hymn, 1856. In some books the tune is called St. Vincent; in others, Bethlehem.\n\nSongs of Praise Discussed, adds this interesting comment on the tune:\n\n“It is curious that some years previous to the publication of Dr. Cummings’s adaptation, Mendelssohn, in writing to his English publishers on the subject of an English translation of the Festgesang, said: “I must repeat the wish I already expressed in my letter to Mr.Bartholomew. I think there ought to be other words to No. 2. If the right ones are hit at, I am sure that piece will be liked very much by the singers and hearers, but it will never do to sacred words. There must be a national and merry subject found out, something to which the soldierlike and buxom motion of the piece has some relation, and the words must express something gay and popular, as the music tries to do it.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMENDON ◊ 249\n\nThe tune “Mendon” was introduced to American tune books by Samuel Dyer in the Supplement of Samuel Dyer’s Third Edition of Sacred Music, 1828, where the tune, called “German Air,” had one more note in each line and a different last line than the form now familiar. The omission of the additional note in the fourth edition of the book was accompanied with this comment: “It is believed that the present arrangement is the original form.” It is thought Lowell Mason altered the last line which he began using is it in his publications and that he gave it its present name. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMERRIAL ◊ 560\n\nThe melody (Merrial) was written by Joseph Barnby, 1868. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMERTON ◊ 96\n\nMICHAEL ◊ 203\n\nMIGHTY SAVIOR ◊ 567\n\nMILWAUKEE ◊ 91\n\nThe tune, known in our circles as “the Milwaukee tune,” is by August Lemke, 1849. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMIN SJÆL OG AAND* (See: OM HIMMERIGES RIGE)◊ 586\n\nMISSIONARY HYMN ◊ 195\n\nThe melody (Missionary Hymn), written by the well known American church musician, Dr. Lowell Mason (b. 1792, d. 1872), is one of the very few American melodies found in the leading English hymnals. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Missionary Hymn,” also called “Heber” and “Gospel Banner,” was written for this hymn by Lowell Mason and appeared in 1829 in The Boston Handel and Haydn Society Collection, 9th edition. J. T. Lightwood says this tune will not soon be forgotten if “modern editors will leave the simple, original, but effective harmonies alone.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMIT FREUDEN ZART ◊ 26\n\nMIT FRIED UND FREUD ◊ 48\n\nThe tune “Mit Fried’ und Freud’“ appeared with the text at its first publication in 1524. The composer is unknown. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMITTEN WIR IM LEBEN SIND ◊ 527\n\nThe tune “Mitten wir im Leben sind” is from a 13th-century gradual. It was first used with Luther’s text in Johann Walther’s Gegstliche gesangk Buchleyn, Wittenberg, 1525. The melody in The Lutheran Hymnary has been associated with this hymn since the earliest German version. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns, and Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal] [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMONKS GATE ◊ 183\n\nMORGENGLANZ DER EWIGKEIT ◊ 75\n\nThe melody (Dayspring) is first found in J. J. Freylinghausen’s Geistreiches Gesangbuch, 1704. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe beautiful tune “Morgenglanz der Ewigkeit” is found in Freylinghausen’s Neues geistreiches Gesangbuch, Halle, 1704. It is an adaptation of Johann Rudolf Ahle’s spiritual aria “Seelchen, was ist Schönres wohl als der Höchste Gott?” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMORNING HYMN ◊ 74\n\nThe melody (Morning Hymn, or Magdalene) is composed by Francois H. Barthélémon (1741-1808) for The Female Orphan’s Asylum and appeared first in 1785. Barthélémon, who was a composer and violinist in France, first came to England on a visit in 1765. Later he took up his residence there. He died in 1808. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Morning Hymn, also called “Magdalene”, and “Hippolytus,” was composed by François Hippolite Barthélémon. It was written for the Female Orphan Asylum at the request of its chaplain and was first printed in the Supplement to the Hymns and Psalms at the Asylum or House of Refuge for Female Orphans, 1785. W. Gawler, organist to the asylum, was the editor. It was headed “New Tune” and set to the words of this hymn. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMORNING STAR ◊ 169\n\nThe tune “Morning Star” for the hymn “Brightest and best” also seems to be growing in popularity in our country. It was part of an anthem composed by James P. Harding, in 1892, for use at Gifford Hall Mission in London. According to Robert Guy McCutchan the tune was first used in an American hymnal when it was included in The New Psalms and Hymns, Richmond, Va., 1901, by the Presbyterian Committee of Publication. It was set to Heber’s hymn in The Methodist Hymnal, 1905, and also in the Evangelical Lutheran Hymn-Book, 1912. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMOSCOW* (ITALIAN HYMN) ◊ 11, 12, 202\n\nMost ancient of all mysteries ◊ 419\n\nMOVILLE ◊ 425\n\nMÜDE BIN ICH ◊ 570\n\nThe tune “Müde bin ich, geh’ zur Ruh”’ first appeared in Theodore Fliedner’s Liederbuch für Kleinkinder-Schulen, Kaiserswerth, 1842, where it was set to the famous German children’s evening song beginning with those words. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMUNICH ◊ 171\n\nThe melody (Munich) was first published in Meiningisches Gesangbuch, 1693; later in J. G. Störl’s Choralbuch, 1710. Mendelssohn made use of this melody in the oratorio Elijah. The melody for “O Gud, du fromme Gud,” “Ach Gott, verlass mich nicht,” “O God, Thou faithful God” (L. H. 457), is a variant of this melody. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Munich” is by an unknown composer. It appeared in the Neuvermehrtes Gesangbuch, Meiningen, 1693, where it was set to the hymn “O Gott, du frommer Gott” by Johann Heermann. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal] ?????\n\nMy course is run ◊ 528\n\nEs ist vollbracht! Gott Lob, es ist vollbracht!\n\nMein Jesus nimmt mich auf!\n\nFahr hin, o Welt! Ihr Freunde, gute Nacht!\n\nIch ende meinen Lauf\n\nBei Jesu Kreuz mit tausend Freuden,\n\nIch sehne mich, von hier zu scheiden.\n\nEs ist volltracht!\n\nEs ist volltracht! Mein Jesus hat auf sich\n\nGenommen meine Schuld;\n\nEr selber hat am Krenzesstamm für mich—\n\nO ungemeine Huld!—\n\nGebüsset, und in Jesu Wunden\n\nHab’ ich die rechte Freistadt funden.\n\nEs ist vollbracht!\n\nEs ist vollbracht! Hier bin ich ausser Not.\n\nAngst und Gefahr gesetzt:\n\nHier speiset mich der Herr mit Himmelsbrot,\n\nHier bin ich hoch geschätzt;\n\nHier hör’ ich auf den Engelsbühnen\n\nDen süssen Ton der Seraphinen.\n\nEs ist vollbracht!\n\nEs ist vollbracht! Gott Lob, es ist vollbracht!\n\nMein Jesus nimmt mich auf;\n\nFahr hin, o Welt! Ihr Freunde, gute Nacht!\n\nIch schliesse meinen Lauf\n\nUnd allen Jammer, der mich troffen.\n\nWohl mir, ich seh’ den Himmel offen.\n\nEs ist vollbracht!\n\nThis cento is composed of Stanzas 1, 2, 4, and 7 of the hymn “Es ist vollbracht,” which is commonly attributed to Andreas Gryphius. It first appeared in Vollständiges Haus- und Kirchen-Gesangbuch, Breslau, 1726.\n\nThe translation is by August Zich and was prepared for The Lutheran Hymnal in 1937. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMy faith looks up to Thee ◊ 184\n\nHEBREWS 12:1-2. This hymn was written immediately after the author had graduated from college, and had accepted a teaching position in New York. “I gave form to what I felt, by writing the stanzas with very little effort. I recollect that I wrote with very tender emotions, and ended the last line in tears.” A short time afterwards the hymn was given to Dr. Lowell Mason for a work then to be compiled by him and Dr. T. Hastings. In 1831 that work was published as Spiritual Songs for Social Worship, etc., words and music being arranged by Thomas Hastings, of New York, and Lowell Mason, of Boston. “My faith looks up to Thee” is included in this work, in four stanzas, entitled Self Consecration, to the tune by Dr. Mason, later known as “Olivet.” The hymn has found a place in most of the modern collections in all English-speaking countries, and has been rendered into numerous languages. The Latin translation, by H. H. Macgill, begins “Fides Te mea spectat.” [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMy God, accept my heart this day ◊ 512\n\nWITH my whole heart have I sought Thee: let me not wander from Thy commandments” (Ps. 119:10).\n\nThis confirmation hymn, used largely in England and America, appeared first in the author’s Hymns of the Heart, 1848. In some hymnals it begins with the second stanza of the original, “Before the cross of Him who died.” [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMy God, and is Thy table spread ◊ 323\n\nCOME, for all things are now ready” (Luke 14:17).\n\n“None of the hymns of Watts,” says H. L. Bennett, “can compare with this one in form, or in feeling, or in beauty of diction.” With Malachi 1:12 as a title, it was first printed in 1755 in Job Orton’s edition of Doddridge’s hymns. These were published after the author’s death. The original has six stanzas. Our edition has made use of stanzas 1, 2, and 4. The hymn is found in the abbreviated form in most hymnals, but it is used very extensively and has been translated into many languages. It has been rendered into Latin by Bingham. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMy heart is longing ◊ 61\n\n\\\\\n\nMy hope is built on nothing less ◊ 197\n\nORIGINALLY this hymn has as its first line “Nor earth, nor hell my soul can move.” Our version begins with the second stanza of the original. There has been much doubt as to the authorship of this hymn. Hence, Edw. Mote, at one time, sent the following explanation to The Gospel Herald: “One morning it came to my mind as I went to my labor, to write a hymn on the ‘Gracious Experience of a Christian.’ As I went up Holborn, I had the chorus:\n\n‘On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand, All other ground is sinking sand.’\n\n“In the day I had the first four verses completed, and wrote them off. On the Sabbath following, I met brother King, as I came out of the Lisle Street meeting—who informed me that his wife was very ill, and asked me to call and see her. I had an early tea, and called afterward. He said that it was his usual custom to sing a hymn, read a portion, and engage in prayer before he went to meeting. He looked for his hymn-book, but could find it nowhere. I said: ‘I have some verses in my pocket’; if he liked, we could sing them. We did, and his wife enjoyed them so much, that after service he asked me, as a favor, to leave a copy of them for his wife. I went home, and by the fireside composed the last two verses, wrote the whole off, and took them to sister King. As these verses so met the dying woman’s case, my attention to them was the more arrested, and I had a thousand printed for distribution. I sent one to The Spiritual Magazine, without my initials, which appeared some time after this. Brother Rees, of Crown Street, Soho, brought out an edition of hymns (1836), and this hymn was in it. David Denham introduced it with Rees’ name, and others after.—Your inserting this brief outline may in the future shield me from the charge of stealth, and be a vindication of truthfulness in my connection with the Church of God.” The hymn was written about 1834 and printed in the author’s Hymns of Praise, London, 1836, under the title, The Immutable Basis of a Sinner’s Hope. Bishop Bickersteth has called the hymn, “A grand hymn of faith.” Two stanzas are omitted in The Lutheran Hymnary. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nMy inmost heart now raises ◊ 79\n\nAus meines Herzens Grunde\n\nSag’ ich dir Lob und Dank\n\nIn dieser Morgenstunde,\n\nDazu mein Leben lang,\n\nO Gott, in deinem Thron,\n\nDir zu Preis, Lob und Ehren\n\nDurch Christum, unsern Herren,\n\nDein’n eingebornen Sohn,\n\nDass du mich hast aus Gnaden\n\nIn der vergangnen Nacht\n\nVor G’fahr und allem Schaden\n\nBehütet und bewacht.\n\nIch bitt’ demütiglich,\n\nWoll’st mir mein’ Sünd’ vergeben.\n\nWomit in diesem Leben\n\nIch hab’ erzürnet dich.\n\nDu wollest auch behüten\n\nMich gnädig diesen Tag\n\nVor’s Teufels List und Wüten,\n\nVor Sünden und vor Schmach,\n\nVor Feu’r und Wassersnot,\n\nVor Armut und vor Schanden,\n\nVor Ketten und vor Banden,\n\nVor bösem schnellem Tod.\n\nDein’n Engel lass auch beiben\n\nUnd weichen nicht von mir,\n\nDen Satan zu vertreiben,\n\nAuf dass der bös’ Feind hier\n\nIn diesem Jammertal\n\nSein’ Tück’ an mir nicht übe,\n\nLeib und Seel’ nicht betrübe\n\nUnd bring’ mich nicht zu Fall.\n\nGott will ich lassen raten,\n\nDenn er all’ Ding’ vermag;\n\nEr segne meine Taten,\n\nMein Vornehmen und Sach’,\n\nDenn ich ihm heimgestellt\n\nMein’n Leib, mein’ Seel’, mein Leben\n\nUnd was er mir sonst geben.\n\nEr mach’s, wie’s ihm gefällt.\n\nDarauf so sprech’ ich Amen\n\nUnd zweifle nicht daran,\n\nGott wird es all’s zusammen\n\nSich wohlgefallen lan;\n\nUnd streck’ num aus mein’ Hand,\n\nGreif’ an das Werk mit Freuden,\n\nDazu mich Gott bescheiden\n\nIn mein’m Beruf und Stand.\n\nThis hymn is by Georg Nigidius (Niege). According to Prof. P. Althaus it was first published in Creutzbuechlein, 1585—1587, at Herford, Germany. A Low German version is found in the Bremer Gesangbuch of 1589. Then in 1592 it appeared in four different publications with text variations. The hymn has long been a favorite in many circles. Gustavus Adolphus loved it, and it was often sung at matins by his soldiers.\n\nThe translation is based on that of Catherine Winkworth, Chorale Book for England, 1863. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMy life is hid in Jesus* ◊ 473\n\n(See: For me to live is Jesus)\n\nMy Maker, be Thou nigh ◊ 513\n\nMein Schöpfer, steh mir bei,\n\nSei meines Lebens Licht!\n\nDein Auge leite mich,\n\nBis mir mein Auge bricht!\n\nHier leg’ ich Herz und Glieder\n\nVor dir zum Opfer nieder;\n\nBestimme meine Kräfte\n\nFür dich und dein Geschäfte!\n\nDu willst, dass ich der Deine sei:\n\nMein Schöpfer, steh mir bei!\n\nMein Heiland, wasche mich\n\nDurch dein so teures Blut,\n\nDas alle Flecken tilgt\n\nUnd lauter Wunder tut!\n\nSchliess die verirrte Seele\n\nIn deine Wundenhöhle,\n\nDass sie von Zorn und Sünde\n\nHier wahre Freiheit finde!\n\nIch bin verloren ohne dich:\n\nMein Heiland, wasche mich!\n\nMein Tröster, gib mir Kraft,\n\nWenn sich Versuchung zeigt!\n\nRegiere meinen Geist,\n\nWenn er zur Welt sich neigt!\n\nLehr mich den Sohn erkennen,\n\nIhn meinen Herrn auch nennen,\n\nSein Gnadenwort verstehen,\n\nAuf seinen Wegen gehen!\n\nDu bist, der alles Gute schafft:\n\nMein Tröster, gib mir Kraft!\n\nGott Vater, Sohn und Geist,\n\nDir bin ich, was ich bin.\n\nAch, drücke selbst dein Bild\n\nRecht tief in meinen Sinn!\n\nErwähle mein Gemüte\n\nZum Tempel deiner Güte,\n\nVerkläre an mir Armen\n\nDein gnadenreich Erbarmen!\n\nWohl mir, wenn du der Meine heisst:\n\nGott Vater, Sohn und Geist!\n\nJohann J. Rambach published this hymn in his Poetische Festgedanken, 1729. It was accepted in the Hannoverisches Gesang Buch, 1740, together with the tune “Mein Schoepfer, steh mir bei” by Franz Heinrich Meyer, to which is has since been wedded.\n\nThe translation is by the Rev. R. E. Taylor of Melbourne, Australia, somewhat altered. It was prepared for the Australian Lutheran Hymn-Book, 1925. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMy song is love unknown ◊ 303\n\nMy soul doth magnify the Lord ◊ 47\n\n\\\\\n\nThis hymn is a free paraphrase by John Theodore Mueller of the German metrical Magnificat, “Mein’ Seel’, o Gott, muss loben dich,” for the Visitation of the Virgin Mary (Fünf auserlesene geistliche Lieder, Marburg, 1535) of unknown authorship. The translation was prepared for The Lutheran Hymnal in 1940. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nMy soul, now bless thy Maker! ◊ 456\n\nNun lob, mein’ Seel’, den Herren,\n\nWas in mir ist, den Namen sein!\n\nSein’ Wohltat tut er mehren,\n\nVergiss es nicht, o Herze mein!\n\nHat dir dein Sünd’ vergeben\n\nUnd heilt dein’ Schwachheit gross,\n\nErrett’t dein armes Leben,\n\nNimmt dich in seinen Schoss,\n\nMit rechtem Trost beschüttet,\n\nVerjüngt dem Adler gleich.\n\nDer Kön’g schafft Recht, behütet,\n\nDie leiden in sein’m Reich.\n\nEr hat uns wissen lassen\n\nSein herrlich Recht und sein Gericht,\n\nDazu sein’ Güt’ ohn’ Massen,\n\nEs mangelt an Erbarmung nicht.\n\nSein’n Zorn lässt er wohl fahren,\n\nStraft nicht nach unsrer Schuld,\n\nDie Gnad’ tut er nicht sparen,\n\nDen Blöden ist er hold.\n\nSein’ Güt’ ist hoch erhaben\n\nOb den’n, die fürchten ihn.\n\nSo fern der Ost vom Abend\n\nIst unsre Sünd’ dahin.\n\nWie sich ein Mann erbarmet\n\nÜber sein junge Kinderlein,\n\nSo tut der Herr uns Armen,\n\nSo wir ihn kind ich fürchten rein.\n\nEr kennt das arm Gemächte\n\nUnd weiss, wir sind nur Staub,\n\nGleichwie das Gras von Rechte,\n\nEin’ Blum’ und fallend Laub,\n\nDer Wind nur drüber wehet,\n\nSo ist es nimmer da:\n\nAlso der Mensch vergehet,\n\nSein End’, das ist ihm nah.\n\nDie Gottesgnad’ alleine\n\nBleibt stet und fest in Ewigkeit\n\nBei seiner lieben G’meine,\n\nDie steht in seiner Furcht bereit.\n\nDie seinen Bund behalten.\n\nEr herrscht im Himmelreich.\n\nIhr starken Engel, waltet\n\nSeins Lobs und dient zugleich\n\nDem grossen Herrn zu Ehren\n\nUnd treibt sein heil’ges Wort,\n\nMein’ Seel’ soll auch vermehren\n\nSein Lob an allem Ort.\n\nMartin Chemnitz, the great Lutheran theologian and one of the authors of the Formula of Concord, is given as authority for the statement that Johann Gramann (Graumann; Poliander) wrote this hymn in 1525, based on Ps. 103, at the request of his friend the Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg-Ansbach, a follower of Luther’s and supporter of the Reformation. It is without question one of our most majestic and most fervent hymns of praise, one that should be in the reportory of every Lutheran congregation. A fifth stanza, evidently not by Gramann, appeared in 1555 and was added to the hymn in a number of German hymnals. It reads:\n\n5. Sei Lob und Preis mit Ehren\n\nGott Vater, Sohn und Heil’gem Geist!\n\nDer woll in uns vermehren,\n\nWas er uns aus Genad’ verheisst,\n\nDass wir ihm fest vertrauen,\n\nGänzlich uns lass’n auf ihn,\n\nVon Herzen auf ihn bauen,\n\nDass uns’r Herz, Mut und Sinn\n\nIhm festiglich anhangen.\n\nDrauf singen wir zur Stund:\n\nAmen, wir werd’n’s erlangen,\n\nGlaub’n wir aus Herzensgrund.\n\nThe hymn was used by Gustavus Adolphus on April 24, 1632, at the first restored Protestant service in Augsburg and also by the inhabitants of Osnabrück, in Westphalia, as a thanksgiving at the close of the Thirty Years’ War on October 25, 1648.\n\nThe translation is by Catherine Winkworth, slightly altered, in her Chorale Book for England, 1863. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nGRAUMANN’S famous hymn, based upon the 103rd Psalm, was first published in Nürnberg, 1540. It also appeared in Kugelmann’s Hymnal of the same year. Martin Chemnitz relates that Graumann was requested to write this hymn in 1525 by the elector Albrecht, whose favorite Psalm was the 103rd. Chemnitz adds: “I often recollect with joy what I witnessed eight years ago, when this pious ruler lay upon his deathbed. At all devotional meetings he requested that this hymn be sung last. How he joined in the singing of the beautiful text and was cheered with the many pious thoughts which he thus gathered! On this account the hymn is especially cherished also by me.”\n\nThis hymn was sung at the Lutheran service conducted in the Church of St. Anna by Gustavus Adolphus after he had entered the city of Augsburg and restored the Augsburg Confession. It was sung with bassoon accompaniment at Osnabruck, 1648, celebrating the peace at the close of the Thirty Years’ War. The Danish-Norwegian king, Christian III (d. 1559), sang this hymn upon his deathbed and expired while singing the words, “For, as a tender father hath pity on his children here.” It has found a place in almost all Danish-Norwegian hymnals. The first Danish version was published in Hans Thomissøn’s Hymn Book of 1569. Another translation was later made by Landstad.\n\nThe first English translation was rendered by I. C. Jacobi in 1722. The version which appears in our Lutheran Hymnary is by Miss C. Winkworth and dates from the year 1863. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNAAR MIT ØIE (CONSOLATION*) ◊ 412\n\nThe melody (Naar mit Øie) is by Ludvig Lindeman. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Consolation,” also called “Naar mit Øie,” is by Ludwig M. Lindeman and appeared in 1871 in his Koralbog for den Norska Kirke, set to H. A Brorson’s hymn “Naar mit Øie, træt af Møie.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNature with open volume stands ◊ 299\n\nNAVY HYMN* (MELITA) ◊ 418\n\nNEANDER* (UNSER HERRSCHER) ◊ 29, 217, 547\n\nNear the cross was Mary weeping ◊ 294\n\n\\\\\n\nTHIS is commonly accepted as the most pathetic of all the hymns from the Middle Ages. It belongs, possibly, to the 13th century. It was not written for liturgical use, but it soon became very widely known. It was used by the Flagellants during the middle of the 14th century. As they marched from town to town scourging each other they sang the “Stabat mater.” During the 15th century, or somewhat earlier, it entered into a few of the missals in use. Not before 1727 was it incorporated into the Missale Romanum. It was commonly used in redactions containing ten stanzas, but more stanzas have been found. Our cento in The Lutheran Hymnary is made up of several revised and combined strophes. There are many such free renderings of the original poem. The original hymn describes the Savior’s mother in anguish beneath the cross. “Stabat mater” is based upon John 19:25; Luke 22:35; Zech. 13:6; 2 Cor. 4:10; Gal. 6:17. It is not definitely known who wrote this stirring poem, picturing to us the mother of Christ standing beneath the cross—this poem with its deep sincerity of feeling, its beautiful rhythm, and its melodious feminine rime. Jacopone di Benedetti (from Todi), who died in 1306, has commonly been mentioned as the probable author of this hymn. Pope Innocent III (1161-1216) and others have also been mentioned. It is not known that this form of verse was used earlier than 1150. The hymnologist Mone is of the opinion that the original poem was written by Pope Innocent III and later revised and enlarged by Jacopone.\n\n… The oldest Danish translation of “Stabat mater” dates from the Middle Ages; first three lines thus:\n\nHoss korssens tree, mz sorg oc wee, stood christi moder, med graadzens floder, hennes søn paa korssyt hengde.\n\nIn 1777 it was revised into current Danish by B. G. Sporon: “Naglet til et Kors paa Jorden.” With a few changes this was employed by Landstad.—”Stabat mater” has been set to music by great composers, such as Palestrina, Pergolesi, Haydn, Rossini, Dvorak, etc. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNETTLETON ◊ 42\n\nNEW BRITAIN ◊ 218\n\nNICAEA ◊ 15\n\nThe melody (Nicea) by J. B. Dykes was composed for the first edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861. It has much in common with the melody for “Wake, awake, for night is flying,” by Philipp Nicolai. The name “Nicea” was given to this melody in memory of the Council of Nice, where the doctrine of the Trinity was finally established. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nicaea” was written for the hymn by John B. Dykes and appeared in Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1861. It was named “Nicaea” because the doctrine of the Trinity was definitely estabiished as a dogma in the Church at the Council of Nicaea, 325 A. D., against the Arians. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNot all the blood of beasts ◊ 305\n\nIsaac Watts published this hymn in the enlarged edition of his Hymns and Spirztual Songs, 1709. The text is slightly altered, chiefly in Stanza 4, Line 4, where Watts had\n\nAnd hopes her guilt was there.\n\nThis change was made, with others not so happy, in the Wesleyan Hymn Book, 1875. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNot in anger, mighty God ◊ 454\n\n\\\\\n\nTHE Biblical basis for this hymn is the Sixth Psalm, by stanzas as follows: 1, “Jehovah, rebuke me not in Thine anger”; 2, “Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away; O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled”; 3, “I am weary with my groaning”; 4, “Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping”; 5, a doxology.\n\nA special edition of this hymn was published in 1655. A number of years later it appeared in a hymn book entitled Andächtig Singender Christenmund, Wesel, 1692. The English translation of this hymn was made by Miss Winkworth and was included among the hymns in her Chorale Book for England, 1863. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNot what these hands have done ◊ 433\n\nSALVATION through Christ alone.”\n\n“For all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God; being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 3:23-24).\n\nThis hymn appeared first in Hymns of Faith and Hope, second series, 1861. It contained 12 four-lined stanzas. As a rule it appears in an abbreviated form. The first line is also found thus: “Not what I feel or do” (second stanza, first line, of the original); “I bless the Christ of God” (seventh stanza, first line, of the original). It is used very extensively in these various versions.

It is not found in many hymnals. The Rochlitzer Gesangbuch of 1746 is one of the few that have it.\n\nThe translation is an altered form of that by Frederick W. Herzberger published in the Selah Song-Book.

James Mearns thinks it is of German origin. He further states that Luther spoke of this hymn as a work of the Holy Spirit. It is found in Latin and German versions, but the author and the original text cannot be determined. The German version is given by Wackernagel as a fifteenth-century translation from the Latin. Some of the various German versions have as rnany as thirteen stanzas.\n\nOur translation is an altered form of what was prepared for The Lutheran Hymnal in 1940. The tune “Der Tag, der ist” is also at least of fifteenth-century origin. It is found in M. Vehe’s Ein neues Gesangbüchlein, Geistliche Lieder, Strassburg, 1537. It had previously appeared in the hymnbook of the Bohemian Brethren by Michael Weisse, 1531. The tune has also been set to a harvest hymn by Eleanor Farieon, in Songs of Praise, and is called “Cornfields.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNow hush your cries and shed no tear ◊ 480\n\n\\\\\n\nNow I have found the ground wherein ◊ 499\n\nIch habe num den Grund gefunden,\n\nDer meinen Anker ewig hält.\n\nWo anders als in Jesu Wunden?\n\nDa lag er vor der Zeit der Welt,\n\nDer Grund, der unbeweglich steht,\n\nWenn Erd’ und Himmel untergeht.\n\nEs ist das ewige Erbarmen,\n\nDas alles Denken übersteigt;\n\nEs sind die offnen Liebesarme\n\nDes, der sich zu dem Sünder neigt,\n\nDem allemal das Herze bricht,\n\nWir kommen oder kommen nicht.\n\nWir sollen nicht verloren werden.\n\nGott will, uns soll geholfen sein;\n\nDeswegen kam der Sohn auf Erden\n\nUnd nahm hernach den Himmel ein;\n\nDeswegen klopft er für und für\n\nSo stark an unsre Herzenstür.\n\nO Abgrund, welcher alle Sünden\n\nDurch Christi Tod verschlungen hat!\n\nDas heisst die Wunde recht verbinden,\n\nDa findet kein Verdammen statt,\n\nWeil Christi Blut beständig schreit:\n\nBarmherzigkeit!

Rothe is the author of this fine hymn. It was first published in Zinzendorf’s Christ-Catholische Singe- und Bet-Büchlein, 1727. The following paragraph from Julian shows that there is uncertainty as to its exact date:\n\nIn the Historische Nachricht (to the Brüder Gesang Buch, 1778), ed. 1835, p. 176, it is said to have been written for Zinzendorf’s birthday, May 26, 1728. This is probably a misprint for 1725, and the hymn, as will be seen above, was in print in 1727. Koch, II, 241, suggests that it was written in return for the hymn “Christum über alles lieben” which Zinzendorf had sent to Rothe in 1722 (in the Sammlung, 1725, No. 652, and in the Deutsche Gedichte, 1735, p. 30, marked as “on a friend’s birthday,” and dated May 12, 1722). This, if correct, would rather suggest 1723 as the date of Rothe’s hymn; only in that case Zinzendorf would almost certainly have included it in the Sammlung of 1725. Zinzendorf, it may be added, gives in his Deutsche Gedichte two other pieces written for Rothe’s birthdays, one dated 1724, for his 36th birthday (beginning “Wer von der Erde ist”), the other dated 1728, for his 40th birthday (beginning “Der du der Herzen König bist”).\n\nIt was suggested by Heb. 6:19.\n\nThe translation is composite. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nTHIS beautiful poem is one of the German hymns which is most popular, not only in Germany, but also in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, and in the English-speaking countries as well. It was first published in Zinzendorf’s Christ-Catholisches Singe- und Bet-Büchlein, 1727. It was later taken up in the hymn books of the Moravian Brethren. This circumstance gave rise to the conception that this and other hymns of Rothe were of the “Zinzendorf” type and, hence, they were not recognized and employed by the Lutherans until a later period.\n\nThe original contains 10 stanzas. It was rendered into Danish by H. A. Brorson and appeared first in Nogle Psalmer om Troens Grund, 1735. This version with a few alterations entered into Landstads Salmebog. The English translation of stanzas 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 10, was rendered by John Wesley, 1740, for his Wesley Hymns and Sacred Poems. Wesley’s translation was rendered in a meter different from the original. …\n\nThere are at least five other English renderings of this hymn. It is related that the well-known pastor Ludwig Hofacker, upon his installation into the office in Rielinghausen, voiced his confession in the words of the tenth stanza of this hymn (the sixth of the present version), “Fixed on this ground will I remain,” etc. “I pray to God that He will let my whole congregation find this ground.” Many incidents are related from English-speaking countries, showing how this hymn has been a source of comfort and blessing to many. Words from this hymn were heard from the lips of the pastors Edward Bickersteth and J. W. Fletcher as they lay upon their deathbeds. Skaar says that if Rothe had not written any hymns other than this one, it alone would have entitled him to rank among the best hymn-writers of the Church.

The hymn first appeared in Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, 1648. The hymn has long been popular in the German-speaking church because of its truly childlike popular spirit, its naive simplicity of expression, its loftiness of thought, and its depth of Christian experience. During the period of Rationalism in Germany it became the object of much shallow wit, especially Stanza 1, of which it was said, How can the dead woods rest, which never are awake, and how can the world lie in slumber? We know that when one half of the world retires to sleep the other half awakes from it! However, Richter, in his Biogr. Lexikon, 1804, already pointed out that, “if to represent the earth as tired and woods and trees as sleeping is not true poetry, then Vergil (Aeneid IV, Lines 522—528) was a blockhead, for what Paul Gerhardt writes is almost a verbatim translation of those lines.”\n\nStanza 8 of the original, our Stanza 5, has long been used as a children’s evening prayer, as Lauxmann (Koch VIII, 194) writes:\n\nHow many a Christian soul, children mostly, but also God’s children in general, does this verse serve as their last evening prayer! It has often been the last prayer uttered on earth and in many districts of Germany is used at the close of the baptismal service to commend the dear little ones to the protection of their Lord Jesus.\n\nThe translation is composite. The omitted Stanzas 5, 6, and 7 read:\n\n5. Head, hands, and feet reposing\n\nAre glad the day is closing,\n\nThat work came to an end;\n\nCheer up, my heart, with gladness!\n\nFor God from all earth’s sadness\n\nAnd from sin’s toll relief will send.\n\n6. Ye weary limbs, now rest you,\n\nFor toil hath sore oppressed you,\n\nAnd quiet sleep ye crave;\n\nA sleep shall once o’ertake you\n\nFrom which no man can wake you,\n\nIn your last narrow bed—the grave.\n\n7. My heavy eyes are closing;\n\nWhen I lie deep reposing,\n\nSoul, body, where are ye?\n\nTo helpless sleep I yield Them,\n\nOh, let Thy mercy shield them,\n\nThou sleepless Eye, their Guardian be!\n\n[Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nTHIS noted evening hymn appeared first in the third edition of Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, 1648, containing 9 stanzas. It is one of the most beautiful and beloved of all the German hymns. In a masterful manner the bodily and the spiritual, the temporal and the eternal, the terrestrial and the celestial are set over against each other in every stanza of the hymn. It soon gained universal favor, and as long as God’s Word and the Spirit remained in power over the hearts of men, it was one of the dearest and most commonly sung of all hymns. This union of lofty sentiment and childlike piety, simplicity, and homelike tone gives it a unique charm.\n\n“Ever since its publication this hymn has been one of the most beloved and best known hymns of devout meditation throughout Germany. Experienced and conceived in a truly childlike and popular spirit, it unites, with a rare, naive simplicity of expression, a loftiness of thought, a depth of Christian experience, a grace of poetry, so that for this union of qualities it must rank as an enduring masterpiece among hymns” (J. Mearns, after Bunsen).\n\nAccording to an old legend, Gerhardt wrote this hymn one evening upon hearing this melody resound from the church tower. One thing is certain, that in this hymn the poet has been exceptionally fortunate in striking proper chords in the popular religious consciousness. In homes where the closing hours of the day have been hallowed by prayer and devotion, this hymn has resounded from generation to generation, and in the case of many, it has become part of the never-to-be-forgotten heritage of childhood memories. Thus, in the case of the great German poet, Friedrich von Schiller, whose pious mother often sang him to sleep with this hymn. The hymnologist Söderberg says: “The noteworthy characteristic of this hymn is the sincerity and impressiveness of its diction, the deep-toned and at the same time unaffected comparisons whereby the thought is led forward from beholding the features of this temporal life into meditation upon the eternal. The truly naive poetry of this hymn has not always been understood. On the other hand, it has even been ridiculed by those who were not familiar with the childlike piety of spirit out of which it has sprung. Thus it happened that ‘Now rest beneath night’s shadow’ was made the butt of jokes and ridicule during the so-called period of ‘Illumination’ (era of rationalism). But with the faithful Christian this hymn will always retain its undying favor. It possesses something of the mild glow of the evening star, which gently breaks through the twilight of the day of life.”\n\nEspecially has the eighth stanza of the hymn (the fourth stanza of our version) been of great comfort and encouragement to thousands of souls. Lauxmann says in Koch’s history: “How many a Christian soul, children mostly, but also God’s children in general, does this verse serve as the last evening prayer. It has often been the last prayer uttered on earth.”\n\nAmong the 16 or more English centos and translations, there are three in common use. Of these, the one by Miss Winkworth, 1855, has been, with a few changes, adopted by The Lutheran Hymnary. Our version contains stanzas 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 of the original. A Danish version by an unknown author was printed in Cassubius’ Hymn Book of 1681. A new translation was rendered by Landstad, 1843: “Nu tier alle Skove.” Another version, which follows the original more closely, was prepared by Landstad for his Kirkesalmebog. Our present version employed in The Lutheran Hymnary is based upon Bible passages as follows: No passage for stanza 1; stanza 2: Isaiah 61:10; stanza 3: Isaiah 57:2; stanza 4: Matthew 23:37; stanza 5: Psalm 91:10 and following verses.

The macaronic was rather, as Nelle says, the result of the delight which many people took in this type. Luther is credited, by Albert F. W. Fischer, with having changed the third stanza of the macaronic to its present form. Prior to that time this stanza overemphasized the place of the Virgin in the plan of salvation. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nIN dulci jubilo” belongs to the so-called “mixed hymns,” with partly Latin, partly German text:\n\nIn dulci jubilo Nun singet und seid froh! Vnsers hertzen wonne leit in praesepio Vnd leuchtet als die sonne matris in gremio. Alpha es et o, Alpha es et o.\n\nHymns of this type were common in Germany towards the close of the Middle Ages. These hymns were generally of a happy and joyous vein, and they were used chiefly on occasions like Christmas and Candlemas. Among these, “In dulci jubilo” was one of the most popular. Eight versions of it have been gathered by the hymnologist Wackernagel. One of these was used in Valentin Babst’s Gesangbuch, published in 1545 with a preface written by Luther. Peter of Dresden (Peter Faulfisch), a school teacher and a follower of the Husites, has been mentioned as the author. He died in 1440, as rector in Zwickau. But strong evidence points to a more remote date. According to the hymnologist Skaar, a Zwickau manuscript dating from the fourteenth century contains a sketch of the life of the Dominican monk, Heinrich Suso, and tells the following story: “Heavenly youths came one day to Suso, and, in order to comfort him in his suffering, one of them sang this joyful song of the Christ-child, and the hymn was ‘In dulci jubilo.’” Heinrich Suso died in 1365, about 75 years before the death of Peter Faulfisch. The story shows that even as early as the close of the fourteenth century this hymn was cherished very highly, hence the conception of its heavenly origin.\n\nThis hymn has brought heavenly comfort to others besides Suso. Especially has the longing for heaven, so beautifully expressed in this hymn, struck home to many hearts. “May we praise Him there,” were the last words of the hymn-writer Ludaemilia Elisabeth as she lay upon her deathbed. As he felt death approaching, a German pastor, Berger, of Brunswick, began to sing “In dulci jubilo.” And with these words Philipp Nicolai closes his mighty hymn, “Wake, awake, for night is Hying”; third stanza:\n\nKein Aug hat je gespürt, Kein Ohr hat mehr gehort Solche Frewde: Des sind wir froh, io, io! Ewig in dulci iubilo.\n\nDanish form:\n\nIn dulci jubilo sjunge Wt oc ere fro, den vort hjerte trøster, ligger i præsipio, oc klar som solen skinner matris in gremio, Alpha es et O :|: [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNow thank we all our God ◊ 63\n\nNun danket alle Gott\n\nMit Herzen, Mund und Händen,\n\nDer grosse Dinge tut\n\nAn uns und allen Enden,\n\nDer uns von Mutterleib\n\nUnd Kindesbeinen an\n\nUnzählig viel zugut\n\nUnd noch jetzund getan!\n\nDer ewig reiche Gott\n\nWoll uns bei unserm Leben\n\nEin immer fröhlich Herz\n\nUnd edlen Frieden geben\n\nUnd uns in seiner Gnad’\n\nErhalten fort und fort\n\nUnd uns aus aller Not\n\nErlösen hier und dort!\n\nLob, Ehr’ und Preis sei Gott\n\nDem Vater und dem Sohne\n\nUnd dem, der beiden gleich\n\nIm höchsten Himmelsthrone,\n\nDem dreieinigen Gott,\n\nAls es im Anfang war\n\nUnd ist und bleiben wird\n\nJetzund und immerdar!\n\nThis German “Te Deum” was, according to James Mearns, published in Martin Rinckart’s Jesu Hertz-Büchlein, 1663. He adds: “There does not seem any good reason for supposing that it did not appear in the first edition, 1636.” In this book the hymn was entitled “Grace” (“Tisch-Gebetlein,” i. e., a short table-prayer). The various stories told about the origin of this hymn seem to be legendary; nor was it written in thanksgiving for the Peace of Westphalia, 1648, which put an end to the Thirty Years’ War.\n\nThe first two stanzas of the hymn are evidently based on Ecclus.50:22-24: “Now, therefore, bless ye the God of all, which only doeth wondrous things everywhere, which exalteth our days from the womb and dealeth with us according to His mercy. He grant us joyfulness of heart and that peace may be in our days in Israel forever; that He would confirm His mercy with us and deliver us at His time.” The last stanza is a metrical form of the “Gloria Patri.” See also Ecclus. 39, last verse.\n\nThe translation is by Catherine Winkworth, Lyra Germanica, second series, 1858. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nTHIS hymn appeared for the first time in Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, 1648, and in Crüger-Runge’s Gesangbuch, 1653. It was slightly varied in the second edition of Rinkart’s Jesu Herz-Büchlein, 1663. Very likely it appeared also in the first edition of this book, Leipzig, 1636, but of this no copies are extant. It is one of the most favored hymns of the Protestant churches. It has been called the “Te Deum” of Germany and has been sung at all national festivals of thanksgiving, not only in Germany and all the north-European countries, but also in America. Since it was sung at the festivals of thanksgiving at the close of the Thirty Years’ War, many have drawn the conclusion that it was composed at that time. It was sung after the battle of Leuthen, 1757, while the army of Friedrich II was yet upon the battlefield. A soldier began the hymn, and the whole army, even the mortally wounded, joined in the singing. It was sung during the festivities in connection with the opening of the Cathedral of Cologne, August 14, 1880. It was likewise used at the laying of the cornerstone for the new parliament building in Berlin, June 9, 1884. It was sung at the thanksgiving services in England at the close of the Boer War. There are at least 12 English translations. The version in The Lutheran Hymnary (31) is by Miss Winkworth and appeared in the Lyra Germanica, 1858.\n\nThe hymn is based upon the words of the high priest Simeon, Ecclesiasticus 50:29-32: “And now let all praise God, who hath done great things, who hath glorified our days, and dealeth with us according to His loving kindness. He giveth us the joy of our heart, that we may find peace in Israel as in the days of yore, thus He lets His loving kindness remain with us, and He will redeem us in our day.” Luther’s version follows: “Nun danket alle Gott, der grosze Dinge thut an allen Enden, der uns von Mutterleib an lebendig erhält, und thut uns alles Gutes. Er gebe uns ein fröhliches Herz, und verleie immerdar Frieden zu unserer Zeit in Israel, und dass seine Gnade stets bei uns bleibe, und erlöse uns, so lange wir leben” (Sir. 50:24-26). The third stanza contains the ancient doxology, the Gloria Patri. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNow the day is over ◊ 560\n\nTHIS hymn was written for, and sung by, the children of Horbury Bridge, and was first published in Church Tunes, February 16, 1867, and then in the Appendix to the Original Edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1868. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nNow the light has gone away ◊ 570\n\nFrances R. Havergal wrote this evensong on October 17, 1869, at Leamington. It appeared in Songs for Little Singers, 1870. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNU RINDER SOLEN OP ◊ 83\n\nThe melody for the above-mentioned hymn is supposed to have been composed by Hartnack Otto Konrad Zinck (1746-1832). It appeared first in Zinck’s Choralbuch, Copenhagen, 1801. This volume contained the melodies for The Evangelical Christian Hymnary. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nu rinder Solen op” is by an unknown composer. It appeared in Hartnack Otto Konrad Zinck’s Koralbog, 1801. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN BITTEN WIR ◊ 33\n\nLuther adopted this Pentecost stanza and added the three following. In this new form the hymn was first printed in Johann Walther’s collection for four voices: Geistliche Gesang-Büchlein, 1524, together with the melody. It has found a place in all Lutheran hymn books. Luther, who himself ordered it for use after communion, later included it among his funeral hymns. It has commonly been sung on Pentecost Day, but in many places it is used as a fixed hymn to be sung before the sermon every Sunday. The oldest Danish translation is found in the missal of 1528 and is no doubt the work of Klaus Mortensøn. This version was made use of in the first Danish-Norwegain hymn book by Guldberg. The first stanza here is as follows:\n\nNu bede wy then helligaandh, alt om then Christelighe thro och reth forstandh, thet oss Gud beuare och sin naade sende, nar wy hæden fare aff thetthe ellende. Kyrieleis.\n\nIn the second edition of Klaus Mortensøn’s Hymnal, 1529, there is, besides this version, also another by the minister, Arvid Pedersøn. Again, a third attempt, which is rather a free translation, appeared together with these in the Malmø Hymn Book of 1533. Grundtvig’s translation has been adopted in the new Danish hymnals. The accepted Norwegian version is by Landstad. The first stanza is always used in our Church at the ordination of ministers.\n\n…\n\nThe melody is possibly as old as the first stanza of the hymn. The oldest source is a Hussite cantionale from the 15th century. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nun bitten wir” is evidently as old as the text of the first stanza and was used with Luther’s version in Walther’s hymn-book, 1524. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN DANKET ALL’ ◊ 32, 52, 180\n\nThe tune “Nun danket all und bringet Ehr,” also called “St. Mary Magdalene” and “Gräfenberg,” according to Zahn is by Johann Crüger and is traceable to the fifth edition of his Praxis Pietatis Melica, Berlin, 1653. In the twenty-seventh edition, 1693 of Crüger’s work, which we have before us, this tune is No. 1154. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN DANKET ALLE GOTT ◊ 63, 404\n\nThe melody (Eng. title, Nun danket, or Wittenberg) is by Johann Crüger. It was used in an early edition, still to be found, of Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, 1647. In Crüger-Runge’s Gesangbuch, 1653, it is marked with Crüger’s initials. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nun danket alle Gott,” also called “Wittenberg,” is found in the third edition of Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica, 1648, and is very likely by Crüger himself. The hymn was sung to this tune to celebrate the Peace of Westphalia, December 10, 1648, and has since been widely used for all celebrations of praise and tbanksgiving. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN FREUT EUCH ◊ 374, 378, 392\n\nThe melody is one of the oldest of Lutheran origin. It was used as a setting for Luther’s first church hymn, “Nun freut euch lieben Christen g’mein,” 1524 (L. H. 526; Landst. 9).\n\nThe melody was first published in Etlich Christlich Lieder, the so-called Achtliederbuch, 1524. It is very extensively used in Germany and in the Northern countries. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nun freut euch,” also called “Luther” and “Altdorf,” has been inseparably wedded to the hymn since its appearance with the text in 1524. It is said to have been written down by Luther from hearing it sung by a traveling artisan. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN KOMM, DER HEIDEN HEILAND ◊ 90, 165\n\nIt has not been definitely established that the melody for this hymn dates from the fourth century. It is possibly a German tune from the Middle Ages and was used by Johann Walther for Luther’s version of the Latin text. It was printed together with this hymn in the Geystliche Gesangk-Buchleyn and in the Erfurt Enchiridion, 1524. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland,” also called “Veni Redemptor gentium,” one of the heritages of the Middle Ages, is adapted from the arrangement found in Geistliches Gesangbüchlein, Wittenberg, 1524. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN LOB, MEIN SEEL ◊ 326, 456, 494\n\nThe original tune used with this hymn in 1540 was possibly written by Hans Kugelmann. This is found in The Lutheran Hymnary as the setting for Nos. 385 and 468. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe composer of the tune “Nun lob’, mein Seel’“ is unknown, although it may have been written by Dr. Gramann or by Johann Kugelmann, in whose Concentus Novi, etc., it first appeared in 1540. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nNUN RUHEN ALLE WÄLDER (See: O WELT, ICH MUSS*)◊ 266, 475, 569\n\nNUNC DIMITTIS ◊ 572\n\nThe tune is called “Nunc Dimittis.” It was composed by Louis Bourgeois for the Genevan Psalter, 1549. It may have been an adaptation of an existing tune, as some of its phrases are reminiscent of the old German Christmas carol “Es ist ein’ Ros’ entsprungen.” In the Genevan Psalter it was set to the “Nunc Dimittis.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nO bless the Lord, my soul (Montgomery) ◊ 369\n\nTHIS paraphrase, based on the 104th Psalm, appeared first in Cotterill’s Selections, 1819. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO bless the Lord, my soul (Watts) ◊ 60\n\nIsaac Watts first published this hymn in his Psalms of David Imitated, 1719, as a metrical paraphrase of Ps. 108:1-7.

Amen.\n\nThis hymn was written by Abbé Sebastian Besnault, a priest of St. Maurice at Sens. It was published in the Sens Breviary, 1726, in seven stanzas. The omitted Stanza 5 reads:\n\nThe wound He through the Law endures\n\nOur freedom from that Law secures;\n\nHenceforth a holier law prevails,\n\nThat law of love, which never fails.\n\nThe translation is an altered form of the version by John Chandler, first published in his Hymns of the Primitive Church, 1837.

Later, in Centuria secunda, etc., Wittenberg, 1608, the author recast the hymn in eight stanzas It is from this version that this hymn is taken, being Stanzas 1 to 5. The only change is that in Stanza 2, Line 1, Behm has “the Father’s might.”\n\nThe translation is an altered form of that by Conrad H. L. Schuette, in the Ohio Lutheran Hymnal of 1880. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nO blessed home where man and wife* ◊ 189\n\n(See: In house and home)\n\nO blessed Sun whose splendor ◊ 531\n\n\\\\\n\nTHIS is a beautiful hymn concerning Christ, the Life and Light, Helper and Protector of the faithful throughout this life. The hymn was printed in Spitta’s Psalter und Harfe, Pirna, 1833, containing eight stanzas under the title: Life and Full Salvation in Christ. The translation is by R. Massie in his Lyra Domestica, 1860. A large number of centos or excerpts from this hymn are in common use in England and America.

It was entitled “Delightful Picture of a House that Serves the Lord. On the Parents of Jesus.” It was written for the First Sunday after Epiphany, 1746.\n\nThis cento contains Stanzas 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8. Catherine Winkworth, in her Chorale Book for England, 1863, translated this hymn, omitting Stanza 6 of the original (our third above) and combining the thoughts of Stanzas 3 and 4 into one. The omitted stanzas in her version are:\n\nBlest where their prayers shall daily rise\n\nAs fragrant incense to the skies,\n\nWhile in their lives the world is taught\n\nThat forms without the heart are naught.\n\nBlest where the busy hands fufil\n\nTheir proper task with ready skill,\n\nWhile through their different works ye see\n\nOne spirit run of unity.\n\nThe translation of Stanza 3 in the hymn, by an unknown writer, is from the Ohio Lutheran Hymnal of 1880. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nPRESUMABLY written for the First Sunday after Epiphany, 1746. This hymn was published in Pfeil’s Evangelisches Gesangbuch, Meiningen, 1782. Originally it contained eight stanzas. Miss Winkworth’s translation for her Chorale Book for England, 1863, omits the second and sixth stanzas. In the Hymnal of the Ohio Synod two stanzas of her version have been left out and a translation of the sixth stanza has been added. This is the arrangement followed in our Lutheran Hymnary. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO Bread of life from heaven ◊ 266 [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nThis hymn is thought to have been written by a German Jesuit of the 17th century. It has also been ascribed to Thomas Aquinas. The oldest copy that has been found is in a Roman Catholic Mainz Gesangbuch of 1661. It contains three stanzas with German and Latin text under the title: A Hymn concerning the True Bread from heaven. It is also found in Hymnia Sacra, Mainz, 1671; in the works of the hymnologist Daniel and in other collections. There are nine English translations; the version found in The Lutheran Hymnary was rendered by Philip Schaff, 1869, though somewhat changed.

Arrebo refers this hymn to an earlier period, and surely both the form and the melody of this hymn seem to belong rather to the pre-Reformation era.” Rudelbach is of the opinion that this hymn “most certainly belongs to the hymn-treasury of the Middle Ages,” and he repeats Arrebo’s statement. Concerning these assertions Skaar says: “‘Most certainly’ is not the right expression. It is true, Arrebo calls it an old hymn; but he had no more information than we concerning its author and designated it as ‘old,’ because he had been acquainted with this hymn and had heard it sung from his earliest youth. In regard to the internal evidence, the matter is quite different; but, everything considered, both the form and the melody of this hymn may be referred to the period of Sthen, at which time the folksong was adopted into several English hymn books and was known under the name ‘Göttingen’.” [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO Christ, our hope, our hearts’ desire ◊ 397\n\n\\\\\n\nAN Ascension hymn, dating from the seventh or the eighth century. It is found in three manuscripts: one from the 11th century, kept in the British Museum; one in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, dated 1064; and one from the 11th century, preserved in St. Gall. It is also found in the old Roman breviaries of Venice, as well as in those of York, Aberdeen, and other places. The printed text may be found in many hymnological works: Daniel, Mone, Cardinal Newman, and others. The translations into English have been rendered either from the Latin original (see the opening lines in the title), or from the revised editions found in the Roman breviaries, with the first line: “Salutis humanae Sator.” The hymn was commonly used at vespers or lauda, the service of praise rendered at the close of the hour of prayer in the evening. There are upwards of 25 English translations. The present version is by John Chandler (1806-76), educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford; minister of the Church of England. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO Christ, our true and only light ◊ 198\n\nO Jesu Christe, wahres Licht,\n\nErleuchte, die dich kennen nicht,\n\nUnd bringe de zu deiner Herd’,\n\nDass ihre Seel’ auch selig werd’!\n\nErfüll mit deinem Gnadenschein,\n\nDie in Irrtum verführet sein,\n\nAuch die, so heimlich fichtet an\n\nIn ihrem Sinn ein falscher Wahn!\n\nUnd was sich sonst verlaufen hat\n\nVon dir, das suche du mit Gnad’\n\nUnd sein verwund’t Gewissen heil,\n\nLass sie am Himmel haben teil!\n\nDen Tauben öffne das Gehör,\n\nDie Stummen richtig reden lehr’,\n\nDie nicht bekennen wollen frei,\n\nWas ihres Herzens Glaube sei!\n\nErleuchte, die da sind verblend’t,\n\nBring her, die sich von uns getrennt,\n\nVersammle die zerstreuot gehn,\n\nMach feste die im Zweifel stehn!\n\nSo werden sie mit uns zugleich\n\nAuf Erden und im Himmelreich,\n\nHier zeitlich und dort ewiglich\n\nFür solche Gnade preisen dich.\n\nThis hymn by Johann Heermann, first published in his Devoti Musica Cordis, Breslau, 1630, was one of the “Songs of Tears” in the section entitled “In the Time of the Persecution and Distress of Pious Christians.” We can understand what the author had in mind when we remember that he wrote during the dreadfal years of the Thirty Years’ War. That it is a splendid missionary hymn the contents show. It is perhaps Heermann’s most widely used hymn in the English-speaking Church. Wackernagel writes: “When we consider the many kinds of trials, sufferings of body and soui, under which many would have lost courage and given up in despair, then Heermann’s hymns will loom up before us as among the most exalted of spiritual poems. Here the cries of anguish of thousands, arising from the homes, from the streets, and from the fields of the beautiful country, have found an expression which is well-pleasing unto God; they have found the peace of prayer, through communion with the Lord.... How touchingly Heermann, in this hymn, prays for the enemies of the Church, for the weak, and for the faint-hearted! He does not desire the destruction of his enemies, but their repentance and, above all, their salvation.\n\nThe translation is an altered form of Catherine. Winkworth’s Lyra Germanica, second series, 1858. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nDEVOTI Musica Cordis, 1630, contained the original setting of this hymn under the title: Zur Zeit der Verfolgung und Drangseligkeit frommer Christen. Thränen-Lieder (Songs of tears). Wackernagel says: “When we consider the many kinds of trials, sufferings of body and soul, under which many would have lost courage and given up in despair, then Heermann’s hymns will loom up before us as among the most exalted of spiritual poems. Here the cries of anguish of thousands, arising from the homes, from the streets, and from the fields of the beautiful country, have found an expression which is well-pleasing unto God; they have found the peace of prayer, through communion with the Lord… How touchingly Heermann, in this hymn, prays for the enemies of the Church, for the weak, and for the faint-hearted (motløse). He does not desire the destruction of his enemies, but their repentance and, above all, their salvation.” Prof. Thomasius began a sermon on Missions and the Church by quoting the first stanza of this hymn. Then he continued: “My wish is, that we might have sung this hymn today, but it is not included in our hymnal, which is the case also with several other sweet and grand hymns.” (We hope that our ministers under similar circumstances will quote not only the first stanza, but the whole hymn.) The English translation used for The Lutheran Hymnary was prepared by Miss Winkworth, 1858. The Norwegian version was made by M. B. Landstad.

Amen.\n\nThis ancient hymn dates from the sixth century or earlier. The author is unknown. It has long been a favorite and has been translated into various languages. The oldest German form appeared in the Erfurt Enchiridion, 1526, “Christe, der du bist Tag und Licht,” (supposedly by Luther’s pupil and friend Erasmus Alberus, which was translated) by Miles Coverdale, in his Goostly Psalmes, 1539, “O Christ, Thou art the lyght and daye.” The translation is based on that by William J. Copeland in his Hymns for the Week, 1848. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nI AM the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life” (John 8:12). This evening hymn has also been ascribed to Ambrose, but no mention of it is made by the Benedictine authors. Some authorities claim that it was not written by Ambrose, and they point to certain irregularities in meter. But because of the position of it in Milanese tradition, we have a right to call it an Ambrosian hymn in a wider sense. Mone has it from the 8th century. In England it is found in a manuscript from 890 and in three manuscripts from the 11th century (British Museum). The hymnologist Daniel gives it from two manuscripts of the 13th century. It was also taken up in many hymnological works and in a large number of breviaries, as the Sarum and York breviaries, by Wackernagel, Cardinal Newman, and others. Among the old German translations may be mentioned “Christe, der du bist Tag und Licht,” Erfurt Enchiridion, 1526; “Christe, du bist der helle Tag,” by Erasmus Alber, 1556; mentioned as a very popular evening hymn in Württemberg “from the earliest period down to the present day.” There are at least 12 translations into English based upon the Latin original, and 5 renderings based upon the above mentioned German versions. Among the latter the oldest is that rendered by Bishop Miles Coverdale, 1539, “O Christ that art the lyght and daye.” In Gude and Godlie Ballates, 1567, the first line is written thus: “Christ, Thou art the licht, bot and the day.” The hymn was rendered into Danish even before the Reformation. It was translated, presumably by Hans Tausen, 1553: “Christe, du est baade Liuss oc Dag.” At an early date the hymn was rendered also into Swedish and Icelandic. But the hymn has won the greatest popularity in Holland, where it has been the regular evening hymn for generation upon generation, “from the earliest period down to the present time.” From Holland it was also carried to South Africa, where the missionaries have called it “the beautiful evening hymn of the natives.” Authorities are not agreed as to the age of this hymn. But St. Caesarius, born 469, Bishop of Arles from 502 (died 542), mentions in his rules for the Monastery of Arles, where his sister was abbess, a few hymns recommended for use, and among them “Christe qui lux es et dies.” According to this we must conclude that the hymn could not have been written later than the 6th century.

There are no manuscript copies earlier than the middle of the 18th century. Though written in Latin by an unknown author, it may be of English origin, as it made its first appearance in English Roman Catholic books. It is possible, because of its great popularity in France, that it originated there and was brought thence to England. The hymn has been ascribed to St. Bonaventura, prominent scholastic teacher of the 13th century, but without historical foundation.\n\nThe hymn seems to have been composed in eight stanzas originally. The cento above contains Stanzes 1, 2, 7, and 8. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nVERY little is known concerning the date and authorship of “Adeste fideles.” It has been credited to Bonaventura, cardinal and hymnwriter (1221-1274), but it is not found in any of the editions of his works. It has been claimed that it dates from the 17th or the 18th century; that it is of French origin and thus belongs to the Latin hymnody of the French Church. And yet it has been established that it was used at an earlier date in England than in France. The hymn appears in three forms. The oldest and, presumably, the most complete contains eight stanzas and is found in the Thesaurus Animae Christianae, Mechlin (without date), and is there called a Second Sequence for Christmas, Ex Graduali Cistercienci. The English text or cento is found to be composed of stanzas 1, 2, 7, and 8! while the French versions generally employ stanzas 1, 3, 5, and 6 of the Latin. In France it was first printed in St. Omer’s Officium, 1822. It has later been included in many French hymn books, and it is said that the hymn is so well known that these books print the title only. The English text dates as far back as 1751 and is found in a manuscript bearing the title: Cantus Diversi pro Dominicis et festis per annum, copied by Rev. John Francis Wade. In 1760 the hymn was included in a church book, and in 1782 it was published in An Essay on the Church Plain Chant, London.—In the Portuguese chapel of London, where Vincent Novello was the organist, “Adeste fideles” was sung as early as 1797, and Novello mentions John Reading, organist of Winchester College, as the composer of the melody. Novello arranged the melody for church choirs, and the hymn with this stately setting became very popular in a short time. It has been established, however, that Reading did not compose the melody. This has also been called the Portuguese Hymn, and it has been claimed that a Portuguese musician, Marcas Portugal, wrote the tune. This has never been proved. In England the melody has been called “Adeste Fideles” (or Torbay), and it has always been associated with this hymn.\n\nThere are over forty English translations of “Adeste fideles.” [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO come, O come, Emmanuel ◊ 110\n\nVeni, veni.

Their address was to our Savior, and they reflect a joyful anticipation of His advent. They are therefore probably not of Roman origin, although they were introduced in Rome already before the 9th century. Some unknown Latin writer of the twelfth century later versified five of the great antiphons, of which four compose the Latin text above.\n\nThis hymn was put into English dress by Dr. John Mason Neale and published in his Medieval Hymns, 1851, beginning “Draw nigh, draw nigh, Emmanuel.”\n\nDr. Neale afterwards revised his translation for the trial copy of Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1859, and the text above is his unaltered, but with the fifth stanza omitted. This stanza, without the refrain, reads:\n\nOh, come, oh, come, Thou Lord of might,\n\nWho to Thy tribes on Sinai’s height\n\nIn ancient times didst give the Law\n\nIn cloud and majesty and awe.\n\nModern hymn-books do not agree as to the merits of Dr.Neale’s translation. Some use a translation by Dr. Henry Solace Coffin, president of Union Theological Seminary, New York, others that of Dr. T. A. Lacy, an Anglican theologian, who was a member of the editorial committee of the English Hymnal, 1906. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nTHIS hymn is a versification of five different antiphones, and the stanzas were printed in Neale’s Hymni Ecclesiae, 1851. The source material was not mentioned. Later it has been found in a supplement to Psalteriolum Cantionum Catholicorum, dating from 1710. A translation by Neale was published in Mediaeval Hymns. This rendering was included in Hymns Noted, 1854. There are several English revisions and one in the German: “Nun sende, Herr, uns deinen Sohn,” found in a Trier hymn book, from 1846-1847. A note in this volume states that this hymn dates from a München hymnary published in 1586.

Johann Rist added seven stanzas and published the hymn in the Erste Zehen of his Himmlische Lieder, Lüneburg, 1641. He wrote: “The first stanza of this funeral hymn, along with its devotional melody, came accidentally into my hands. As I was greatly pleased with it, I added the other seven as they stand here.” The omitted Stanza 6 reads:\n\nO lieblich Bild,\n\nSchön zart und mild,\n\nDu Söhnlein der Jungfrauen,\n\nNiemand kann dein heisses Blut\n\nSonder Reu’ anschauen.\n\nThe translation is an altered form of that by Catherine Winkworth, in her Chorale Book for England, 1863, except Stanza 2, which is a composite. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nHIMMLISCHE LIEDER, Lüneburg, 1641, contained this hymn of eight stanzas under the heading Klägliches Grablied über die trauriche Begräbnisz Jesu Christi, am stillen Freitag zu singen. The author gives the following explanation: “The first stanza of this funeral hymn together with its touching melody came into my possession by chance. It appealed to me very much and, since I could not obtain the remaining stanzas, I have added the seven stanzas as they are found here.” The first stanza appeared in a Roman Catholic hymn (containing seven stanzas), published in the Würtzburg Hymn Book, 1628.—Rist’s hymn with its classical melody became very popular throughout Germany and has entered into most of the hymn books in common use. The English translation by Miss C. Winkworth dates from 1863 and contains stanzas 1, 3-5, 7, and 8. This has been employed in The Lutheran Hymnary. The first translation into Scandinavian was rendered by B. K. Aegidius. A later Norwegian rendering, with a ninth stanza added, was made by Landstad. … “The popularity of this hymn was greatly aided by the plaintive melody which appeared with the original hymn in 1628” (J. Mearns). [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO DASS ICH TAUSEND ZUNGEN HÄTTE (DRETZEL) ◊ 226, 242\n\nThe tune “O dass ich tausend” is not to be confused with the tune of the same name by Joharn B. König. This tune is by Kornelius Heinrich Dretzel, who edited Des evangelischen Zions Musikalische Harmonie Nürnberg, 1731, in which this tune appeared. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nO DASS ICH TAUSEND ZUNGEN HÄTTE (KÖNIG) ◊ 443\n\nThe melody is by Johann Balthazar Koenig (born 1691, in Waltershausen von Gotha, and died 1758, in Frankfurt am Main). In the latter place he served as music director and published in 1738 a large collection of chorals: Deutscher Liederschatz. [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nThe tune “O dass ich tausend Zungen hätte” is very likely by Johann Balthasar König, published in his Harmonischer Liederschatz, Frankfurt, 1738, where it was set to Angelus Silesius’s hymn “Ach sagt mir nichts von Gold und Schätzen.” It has practically become wedded to Mentzer’s hymn. [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nO day full of grace ◊ 401\n\n\\\\\n\nTHIS old Christian “day hymn” belongs “to the old hymns used in the Church of Rome; hymns which were preserved partly by copies, but especially by oral tradition from generation to generation. The oldest and most venerable of all the Nordic hymns is permeated in a wonderful manner with the light from that supernal day, which is not recognized by the men of the world who cling to earthly things, but which can only be perceived by the spiritual eye of simple and innocent faith” (Söderberg). The hymn was adopted into many Lutheran hymn books of the Northern countries, but, independently of this “authorized” version, another popular form of the hymn maintained itself for many centuries in the current tradition of the people. The Swedish hymnologist, L. Högmarck, relates m his work of 1736 that “mycket enfaldigt gammalt folk, hvar gång thet siunger denna psalmen, wid slutet deraf tillägger således”:\n\nThenna wisan hon är nu quadin, hon är icke lång,\n\nHon är nu snart kommen til enda. Hon är af Sanct Johan beskrifwen en gång,\n\nAt til oss paa jorden nedsenda.\n\nHo thenna wisan quäder och gifwer act ther uppå,\n\nHans mål skal få en god enda.\n\nThe hymnologist Rudelbach says concerning this hymn: “This old Christian day hymn is a festival hymn and at the same time a ‘day hymn’; the birth and the cross of our Lord greet each other; His resurrection and eternal power are felt like a breath of light through the whole hymn; and the reverent morning and evening meditation lays effective emphasis upon those holy thoughts to which the Christian must continually return.”\n\nThe oldest copy of this hymn is Swedish. A manuscript in the old fashioned hand writing of the monks is kept in the university library of Upsala in Sweden. It dates, apparently, from the year 1450. Söderberg calls this the oldest Swedish hymn. It is not yet possible to determine whether the original was written in Swedish or in Danish. It was first printed in Danish, 15 69, in Hans Thomissøn’s Hymn Book. It bears the title Den gamle christelige Dagvise, which proves that it was a well known hymn from an earlier period. While the Swedish version contains prayers to the Virgin Mary, these have been eliminated in Thomissøn’s book. The Protestant hymn writers have always in their treatment of Medieval hymns rewritten them in the Lutheran spirit and given them a free rendering. “They have, so to speak, smelted and refined them, and recast them in the true Reformation spirit, so that they shine forth in pure evangelical light, as they are sung by the congregation at services or in the devotional meeting of the quiet home circle” (Heggtveit).\n\nThomissøn’s redaction of this hymn has been copied in most of the private editions of the old Danish hymn books. It is entered as No. 1 in En ny og fuldkommen dansk Salmebog, indeholdende 1010 Salmer, 1709. A Swedish translation has also been adopted into the later Swedish hymnals.\n\nAt the millennial celebration, 1826, commemorating the introduction of Christianity into Denmark Grundtvig published a version of this hymn containing 12 stanzas, entitled “Den signede Dag med Fryd vi ser.” In Festsalmer, 1850, he published a version containing seven stanzas. Landstad employed this in his Pentecost hymn (Landst. 434), while he has used the “day hymn” following Thomissøn’s version in its place among the morning hymns (Landst. 604). [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO day of rest and gladness ◊ 485\n\nTHIS is the day which Jehovah hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it” (Psalm 118:24).\n\nThis hymn for Sunday is given first place in Wordsworth’s Holy Year, 1862. The original of six stanzas has been abbreviated in most hymn books. In a few collections stanzas 5 and 6 are listed as a separate hymn.

It is entitled “The Cause of the bitter sufferings of Jesus Christ and consolation from His love and grace. From Augustine.” It is based on the so-called Meditations of St.Augustine, chapter VII. This, however, is not an original work of Augustine, but rather a medieval compilation from various Church Fathers, including Augustine, Gregory the Great and Anselm of Canterbury. Chapter VII is by Anselm. The hymn is written in the Sapphic meter. However, the English translation does not always conform as well as it might.\n\nThe translation is an altered form of that by Catherine Winkworth in her Chorale Book for England, 1863.

The original setting for this hymn contained 15 stanzas and was printed in Heermann’s Devoti Musica Cordis, Breslau, 1630. It is used very extensively in Germany, and has been translated into English at least 11 times. It was not included in Landstad’s Hymn Book. The English translation adopted by [Dahle, Library of Christians Hymns]\n\nO DU LIEBE ◊ 199, 222, 240\n\nThe tune “O du Liebe meiner Liebe,” also called “Cassel” and “Lucerne,” is from Johann Thommen’s Erbaulicher Musikalischer Christenschatz, Basel, 1745, set to a German hymn of unknown authorship, beginning with the same line. It was already in use among the Moravian Brethren at Herrnhut before that date. Thommen calls it a Herrnhut tune. Among them it was called “O gesegnetes Regieren.” It is supposed to have been a folk-tune originally, used with a popular song, beginning “Sollen nun die grünen Jahre.” [Handbook to The Lutheran Hymnal]\n\nO DURCHBRECHER ◊ 484\n\nThe melody employed with this hymn was first published in Geistreiches Gesangbuch, Halle, 1704, as a setting for the famous hymn, “O Durchbrecher aller Bande,” by Gottfried Arnold.
