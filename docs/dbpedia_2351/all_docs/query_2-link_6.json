The remainder of the papers are published in a special double issue of the Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development and in Volume Five of the Copenhagen Studies in Bilingualism published by Multilingual Matters, Ltd. The Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development contains papers dealing with two sub-themes of the conference which have particular relevance in the Scandinavian context. One is the school's relationship to bilingualism, discussed at the national level. The other group of papers in that volume deals with the learning and development processes which go on in the individual. Volume Five of the Copenhagen Studies comprises the papers on Bilingualism in Society and School. There are papers on language planning, on the different status of different languages, and on language ecology. The volume also includes papers on group bilingualism, on pre-school children, and finally on classroom practice. Some of the exhibits from the exhibitions at the conference are used as illustrations in this volume. At this time we as organisers wish to express our gratitude to: our co-organisers, especially Marie Hald and Inger Nørgaard, our colleague Bent Søndergaard of the Pedagogische Hochschule Flensburg, and, from our own institution, Gerd Gabrielsen, Erik Larsen, Jørn Lund and Marie-Alice Séférian; the participants in the conference; the publishers of the proceedings of the conference (not the least for kindly agreeing to go against their house policy of not accepting manuscripts that are written in languages other than English. It was one of the conditions of the conference, however, that all papers submitted before the deadline were to be published as part of the proceedings); to our sponsors: King Frederik and Queen Ingrid's Foundation, Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik's Foundation, The TUBORG Foundation, Knud Højgaard's Foundation, Rosalie Petersen's Foundation, Julius Skrike's Foundation, SAS Travel Grants, The Rockwool Foundation, The\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iv\n\nnext page > Page iv\n\nFoundation for Danish-Swedish Co-operation, The Cultural Foundation for Denmark and Finland, Denmark's Teachers' Union, The Danish Masons, The Letterstedt Society, The Ministry of Education, The City of Copenhagen, The County of Copenhagen, The Research Council for the Humanities, The Greenland Foundation of the Danish Parliament, The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies. EMDRUP NOVEMBER 1987 ANNE HOLMEN, NORMANN JØRGENSEN, JØRGEN GIMBEL, ELISABETH HANSEN\n\n< previous page\n\npage_iv\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_v\n\nnext page > Page v\n\nIntroductory Note Anne Holmen, J Normann Jørgenson, Jørgen Gimbel, Elisabeth Hansen Department of Danish Language and Literature, The Royal Danish School of Educational Studies at Copenhagen The Fifth Nordic Conference on Bilingualism was held at the Royal Danish School of Educational Studies in Copenhagen, 22-25 June 1987. The main theme of the conference was 'Two Languages and Two Cultures in Education'. This theme was dealt with in many ways by the contributions offered during the conference, and no less in the more than 1,300 pages of manuscripts submitted for publication in the proceedings. Many of the papers, however, deal with certain aspects of bilingualism currently drawing attention from many students of the discipline. These aspects include the macro-level planning of language education in multilingual societies, the micro-level second language learning strategies, the linguistic level analysis of interactional data involving bilinguals, and on the cultural level bilingual writers. We have chosen to group the papers according to their relationship to the main theme of the conference. The papers in this volume deal mainly with bilingualism in relation to the individual. The first group of papers have their main emphasis on the analysis of conversational data involving bilingual speakers. Pedersen, Ytsma, Dahlbäck, J¬rgensen and Hirvonen all present material from bilingual (school) children. Pedersen's children belong to the German minority in Denmark, and she is particularly interested in their changing relationship over their school years with the three languages (namely standard German, standard Danish and the local Danish dialect, S0nderjysk) at their disposal in the border region between Denmark and Germany. Dahlbäck has studied the difference in second language conversation between two girls, one pre-schooler and her nine-yearold sister, finding substantial differences in their use, both towards adults and towards peers, the younger girl playing more with the language, and the older sister having a more instrumental relationship to the second language. Hirvonen compares the 'foreigner talk' of monolingual and bilingual children. She finds, and expresses some surprise at this, that the monolingual children adjust their language more to the (perceived) competence level of learners than bilinguals\n\n< previous page\n\npage_v\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vi\n\nnext page > Page vi\n\ndo; i.e. the monolinguals use more foreigner talk than the bilinguals when talking to learners. Hirvonen ascribes this finding to the bilinguals' greater awareness of what learners really are capable of, and their being more acquainted with the task of communicating in two languages. Ytsma presents data from two Frisian-Dutch classrooms in bilingual schools. His approach is partly quantitative, partly qualitative, and he finds that the question of language choice is particularly ambiguous in bilingual classrooms with two languages which are in principle equal. Jørgensen's material was collected among Turkish children in Danish schools. He has analyzed their communication strategies in solving a communicative problem well-known in school: explain something to an adult who knows it all perfectly well in advance! Lanza's paper describes the growing bilingual awareness of a child growing up in a bilingual family with parents adhering fairly strictly to the one-person-one-language strategy. She finds clear evidence that the child's awareness, as it appears in conversations with her parents, is due to the parents' deliberate metalinguistic input. Vejleskov uses his material from Norwegian pre-school children engaged in role play to express doubt about the distinction between 'social' and 'cognitive' language, maintaining that children in role play exhibit both kinds of language simultaneously and indistinguishably from each other. Arnberg looks at children's role in conversation from the other side, namely that of perception. She has developed a means of assessing comprehension skills in very young bilinguals in which they control the speaking rate (the input speed!) themselves. Her intriguing experiment allows for comparison of comprehension and production skills as well as assessment of comprehension skills in bilingual children of different ages. Håkansson & Lindberg set up a typology of questions in their paper. They emphasise that the teacher's questions in the second language classroom are not only cues for imitation and repetition of socially meaningless phrases, but also parts of a verbal interplay with the learner. Kalin deals with metalinguistic knowledge in adult second language learners, focusing on their ways of handling difficulties in understanding and the development of strategies over time. All these papers show bilinguals in verbal interaction, especially bilingual children in conversation with each other, with monolingual children, and with adults. The sheer number of papers dealing with this aspect of linguistic analysis marks a shift in emphasis from previous conferences. Structural linguistic data have given way to conversational and interactional data. Perhaps it is more precise to say that the researchers' perspective on the data has changed. The focus is not on the language being learnt, but rather on the way the learner uses his or her second language. To a certain extent, this development reflects a general trend. It is, however, also characteristic of the study of the linguistic aspects of bilingualism in the Nordic countries that it has gradually gone through the steps that appear from the proceedings of the conferences, e.g. Ejerhed & Henrysson (1981) and Wande et al. (1987). Not that hard-core linguistics dominates in either, but the dimension represented in contributions like Mejdell's and Viberg & Axelsson's in Wande et al. (1987)\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vi\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vii\n\nnext page > Page vii\n\nhas now been supplemented by the interactional dimension. This is not to say that linguistics in the narrow sense of the word is outdated. On the contrary, it is alive and well, as can be seen in the section entitled 'Linguistic Structure and Variations in Bilinguals'. Boseker's paper not only presents a quite comprehensive review of Black American English and its place in the American educational discussion, but also presents a strategy for teaching children speaking Black American English to read. Similarly, Melchers presents a bidialectal area, the Shetlands. The linguistic data are likewise presented and discussed in an educational context. Two papers discuss the influence of a majority language on the mother tongue of school children. Stankovski uses material from the JUBA project at the University of Lund to follow the phonological mother tongue development of Serbocroatian-speaking children living in diaspora conditions in Sweden. He finds that his material, together with similar investigations of the development in speakers of Slavic languages, sheds important light on the development of pronunciation as such. Ulla Lauren discusses the vocabulary deviations from 'Standard Swedish' in the written production of Finnish children. Two clearly different phenomena occur, namely on the one hand integration of Finnish elements (leading to regionalisms in Finland Swedish), and on the other hand interference, the individually occurring influence from Swedish. In contrast to these two papers, Strömman's paper looks at the linguistic interplay between two languages spoken in the same surroundings. She has investigated the trade slang of three work places in a Swedish-speaking area of Finland. She found that the trade slang in a given place is determined not only by the language dominance in general, but also by the language of the trades' educational approaches. Although it was clearly present in many discussions during the conference, and although it had an important place in the opening address of the conference by Bertel Haarder, Minister of Education (Haarder, 1988) the acquisition of foreign languages in school by majority language speakers was underrepresented in the papers. One exception is Haastrup's investigation of the changing influence of English and French on the spelling of loan words in Danish. The third group of papers in the present volume covers a number of approaches to the question of the effect of the learners' different backgrounds on their second language acquisition. Mägiste has studied hemispheric involvement in German and Polish speakers learning Swedish and found evidence against the hypothesis that involvement of the right hemisphere peaks at an early stage of second language acquisition and gradually gives way to involvement of the left hemisphere. Her study supports the so-called age hypothesis, according to which lateralization will be less important in languages acquired after puberty. Stroud has studied text production by near-native learners of Swedish and compared learners with different mother tongues and different cultural backgrounds. Mougeon & Beniak maintain that English speakers having been\n\n< previous page\n\npage_vii\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_viii\n\nnext page > Page viii\n\nimmersed in French-medium schools acquire a French which is characterised by several shortcomings, especially with regard to casual style speech. Hvenekilde compares mathematical and arithmetical concepts in Norwegian and certain minority languages, such as different number systems and alphabets as well as different traditions of 'finger calculation techniques'. The project described in her paper is a systematic analysis of the differences. An empirical investigation among minority language students in Norwegian schools will be carried out later. Berliner uses the stroop test and other psychological experiments to investigate the relationship between cognitive style and attitudes in Greenlandic speakers with Danish as their second language, and Bent Søndergaard also reports a study on attitudes towards Danish as a first foreign language, in the Faroe Islands. He finds a surprisingly neutral attitude towards Danish. The last group of papers in this volume brings us to one of the most fascinating themes covered by the study of biculturalism in education, that of bilingual fiction and fiction produced by bilinguals. Séférian discusses the first question that comes to mind. Can a poet really be bilingual, or better: can a bilingual produce poetry in both of his (or her) languages? To answer this she presents the case of the Algerian-French writer Kateb Yacine. She answers the question in the affirmative, although somewhat hesitatingly: yes, a poet can be bilingual. Gaski looks at what he calls ethno-poetry from a different angle. He describes the use of minority language fiction as a vehicle for the survival of the minority language (and culture). Herberts explains the relationship between bilingual (or minority) identity and creative fiction. Fiction and poetry mirror the conditions under which they are createdand in turn may influence the feeling of identity in future generations who are taught about the same fiction and poetry in school. This aspect is also taken up by Kleivan in her paper about child literature in Greenland. She describes both the translated Danish literature (e.g. literature written in Danish for Danes about Greenland) and the Inuit literature. This fairly small section of four papers thus embraces the full spectrum of language combinations covered by the conference: from the suppressed indigenous minority language, to the established prestigious foreign language!

Abstract This paper presents a longitudinal sociolinguistic project in the Danish-German border region and gives some results from the first part of the project that concentrates on children living in Southern Jutland. Half the informants belong to the German minority, and they have either a Danish dialect or German as their first language. The children's second language acquisition is described at different age levels in kindergarten and school, and their attitude to their bilingualism is explained. The manner in which the youngest group communicates successfully is often seen to be dependent on the hearer's bilingualism, but among the oldest informants the language norms of the group seem to be decisive for success or failure in communication. As the children grow older, the necessity of acquiring standard Danish as the third variety is considered, and the introduction and function of the majority language in minority education is discussed. The overall long-term aim of the longitudinal research project, 'The meeting between the Languages in the Danish-German Border Region', is to understand the role of the languages and their varieties in social and cultural processes in general, but also in educational processes. The first part of the project describes the languages of children living in Sønderjylland, the Danish region bordering on Germany, where a German minority is estimated to number approximately 5% of the population. In the area three languages are spoken: Sønderjysk, which is a Danish dialect, Danish and GermanGerman partly as a minority language, partly as a foreign language. The main questions for the analysis are 'Why and how the children are socialised to become either monolingual, bilingual or multilingual speakers, and whether their linguistic, communicative and cultural competence qualifies or stigmatises them in the educational system and in their choice of professional\n\n< previous page\n\npage_1\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page > Page 2\n\ncareer'. We hope to be able to answer the questions by collecting data on a micro-level, applying both qualitative and quantitative methods, and by analyzing and interpreting the data so that they give an explanation at the individual level at different ages and open up the prospect of making comparisons between the informants. The analysis will not result in statistical generalizations, but in qualitative descriptions, and in this paper some results from the preliminary analysis are given. We have had the opportunity to work with 65 children in the municipality of Tinglev, a typical rural district. They were chosen at random from two groups: 4-5-year-old children from kindergartens and 12-13-year-old pupils. Half of both groups attend German minority institutions and I shall concentrate on that group. The data come from tape-recordings of various types of verbal interaction among the children and between children and interviewers. They are supplemented by participant observation and information from questionnaires about the linguistic and sociocultural background, completed by parents and pupils. Language Distribution From the questionnaires we know that attending a German minority kindergarten or school does not necessarily indicate that one speaks German at home. Twenty per cent of the youngest group and 13.3% in the oldest group speak German at home, but the rest speak 'Sønderjysk, the Danish dialect of Southern Jutland. It cannot be ascertained, however, whether the distribution in the use of German, Sønderjysk and standard Danish is typical of the whole minority, because available statistics differ greatly. According to Byram (1986) a conservative estimate indicates that two-thirds of the minority speak Sønderjysk as their low (L)-language and German as their high (H) language in minority affairs, but minority authorities say it is fifty-fifty. The percentage of my children with German as H language may, however, be typical of rural areas like Tinglev, the percentage being higher in urban districts, where many members of the minority educated in Germany live together with new arrivals from Germany, a constellation that might result in German being used as both L and H language. All the informants but one began to learn their second language at the age of 2½ or 3 years, and I want to give an analysis of some conversational sequences in order to illustrate how the children are socialised to this successive bilingualism and in order to discuss some pedagogical perspectives.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_2\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page > Page 3\n\nCommunication Strategies in the Kindergarten The kindergarten children who speak the Danish dialect at home are very positive towards learning German, and they feel free to use both languages. The teachers also use both languages. They speak German in activities such as singing, games and meals and when they give instructions like 'Go and brush your teeth'. Dialogues with children who have been in the kindergarten for a year or so are also in German, but the teachers speak the dialect to the youngest dialect-speaking children. The code choice in 'Memory'a game of cardsis German. When playing 'Memory' with the German-speaking interviewer, the three 4-5-year-old girls, Hanne, Tove and Kirsten, intend to explain in German the pictures on the cards, when they turn them. Hanne:\n\nein\n\nTove:\n\nein Feuermann\n\nHanne:\n\nein Feuermann\n\na fireman.\n\nIn the transcriptions single underlining indicates deviations from standard language, whereas double underlining indicates interference or code-switching. Tove corrects the interference in Hanne's remark by saying 'Feuermann', and Hanne repeats the word. Though it is not quite correct, the interviewer does not interfere. Later in the play Kirsten says 'Feuerwehr' (fire brigade) to the same picture, and the two girls repeat it. We cannot make out whether they have learnt the correct expression or not, but imitations like these seem to be typical learning strategies. Kirsten, who knew the word 'Feuerwehr', speaks German at home in contrast to the two other girls, but she does not always succeed in teaching them new words in German on the first occurrence. Tove:\n\nein\n\na watch.\n\nKirsten: ein_ Uhr\n\na watch.\n\nTove:\n\nno.\n\nnæh\n\nKirsten: doch ein Uhr_ kan man\n\nyou can also say a watch.\n\nauch sagen The interviewer confirms Kirsten's statement, but does not explain that ' ' is a Danish dialect expression, and 'eine Uhr'is a German word. During the participant observation we never heard the teachers give the children such a metalinguistic knowledge either, so we decided to use the same strategy as the teachers in order to analyze the learning strategies. Later on Tove and Hanne repeat without protest after Kirsten: 'eine Uhr'.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_3\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_4\n\nnext page > Page 4\n\nThe play goes on, and Tove turns two similar cards with cats on: Tove:\n\nKatze_ wir hab_ zwei\n\ncats we have two cats at\n\nKatze_ zu Hause\n\nhome.\n\nHanne:\n\ndu skal ikke/når vi Hælder mælk you ought not/when we are pouring op til den se så får man sådan milk for it look then you get a scratch like this. en krads på\n\nTove:\n\nvi giver den hver dag mad\n\nwe give it food every day.\n\nHanne:\n\nja og æ missekat har kradset oven på æ finger du\n\nyes and the pussycat has scratched my finger you see.\n\nInterviewer:was ist das?\n\nWhat is that?\n\nKirsten:\n\na moped and a moped.\n\nein Moped und ein Moped\n\n(The play goes on in German.) The interviewer and Kirsten stick to German throughout the play. Hanne does not, she switches to dialect, giving Tove a piece of good advice about cats. She is referring to an episode from home where she speaks Sønderjysk, the Danish dialect. That may be the reason why she chooses the dialect, but it is also possible that she uses dialect because she is very involved in her message. She either cannot express such an involvement in German because of a lack of vocabulary items, or she is not used to it. Other communicative situations show, however, that she is able to produce sentences in German. The reason for Tove's code-switching is that her speech is a continuation of the last language used, but of course, it is also possible that dialect is used because the activity referred to takes place at home, where Sønderjysk is the only language spoken. As exemplified by different explanations, the cause of code switching might be a combination of many reasons. Interference and code-switching to the Danish dialect are accepted and understood in the kindergarten, but the status of the dialect is peripheral because the linguistic goal is German. The focus on German and not on the Danish dialect as a second language has consequences for L1 speakers of German like Kirsten. Their first language is highly esteemed and understood by all, apart from the very youngest, a function that seems to prevent some of the German speakers from acquiring a productive competence in the Danish dialect. These are mainly children from an entirely German network. The result is that the children being asked a question in dialect often resort to an answer in German or avoid answering by saying the formula: det ved jeg ikke\n\n< previous page\n\nI don't know\n\npage_4\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nnext page > Page 5\n\nPlaying 'Memory' with the Danish interviewer, Kirsten explains about the cards in German, but uses the formula, 'I don't know' five times when she is asked to explain some well-known episodes on a picture. She produces one sentence in dialect: Hvorfor tror du han står helt Why does he stand there Interviewer: alene der og kigger på? watching all alone, do you think? Kirsten: for ingen leger med ham nobody plays with him. When she talks to the German interviewer about almost the same picture, she turns out to be an involved speaker, not doubting what to say. Having attended the kindergarten for one or two years, the German L1 speakers seem to be at an early stage of successive bilingualism. They use formulas and produce a few other sentences, but interference from German is hardly seen. Code-switching is the predominant strategy. The dialect speakers, on the other hand, seem to have moved quickly through stages like those in simultaneous bilingualism, though the situation is of a successive character, probably because the second language is a necessity from the age of 2½ or 3 years. The type of bilingual development is, of course, dependent on how well established the first language is when the second language is introduced. It is also dependent on how much time the child spends in kindergarten every day (this may vary from four to ten hours) and on how much the parents speak to the child at home. After a year the children's language mixing has almost disappeared, but there is some influence from the Danish dialect on German, resulting in interference. The children's code choice is dependent on the topic they are talking about and the type of activity they are taking part in, and not so much on the person they are talking to. Though the children define a situation as being German, they code-switch to the dialect when referring to an experience that took place in dialect or that normally takes place in dialect outside kindergarten, just as in Hanne and Tove's dialogue about the cat. They also often switch to the dialect when they have problems to solve, and it need not be linguistic problems. In a dialogue with the German interviewer, Tove speaks German until she cannot answer a question. Without hesitation she changes into dialect: det kan jeg ikke huske det ved jeg I can't remember I don't Tove: ikke hvad for en farve det er know what color it is. The interviewer replies in German, and, feeling her problem solved, Tove also continues in German. In opposition to this situation code-switching as a\n\n< previous page\n\npage_5\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nnext page > Page 6\n\ncontinuation of the last language used is common among the dialect speaking interlocutors. Sometimes they even go on speaking the dialect until a new activity or topic is introduced. School Languages The 3-5-year-old children were not able to discuss the use of two languages, but three years later in school they are aware of a minority and a majority language. At school German is used as medium of instruction in all subjects apart from one lesson a week in grade one and grade two where standard Danish is introduced through playing activities, and five lessons a week from grade three in the subject of Danish. Few children were able to distinguish consciously between dialect and standard Danish, but some of them tended to change from 'pure' dialect towards a regional variety when they talked to the standard-speaking interviewer, but they kept to 'pure' dialect when they spoke to the dialect interviewer. The dialect speakers do not doubt their proficiency in German, they take it for granted, and the occurrence of interference from Danish has diminished, and code-switching is rare. Instead of interference a new type of deviation from High German has appeared, that is German words or expressions which are wrong in the context. They are probably chosen because they either sound like a Danish word-'a false friend'or there is a transfer from Danish to German, resulting in a non-idiomatic expression. I call such examples similarity transfer: Frucht (da. frugt) instead of Obst. Sie sagt Entschuldigung (Da. sige undskyld) instead of: Sie bittet um Entschuldigung. The German speakers, on the other hand, are not satisfied with their performance in their second language, as Kirsten says: Jo jeg kan godt men ikke så godt\n\nWell I can, but not very well.\n\nHer attitude towards learning Danish is positive, and she wants to watch Danish TV to a greater extent, but her younger brother prevents her from doing so, because he does not understand Danish. Vi kan slet ikke så godt We are not good at Kirsten:dansk. Danish at all\n\n< previous page\n\npage_6\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nnext page > Page 7\n\nNot long ago Kirsten gained a Danish-speaking friend at home. en på min gade hun hedder Lise hun kommer altid til mig så snakker vi dansk hun er One girl in my street she is called Lise she always come to me and then we speak Danish, she is a også Dane too Kirsten:dansker. Being asked whether the friend speaks the dialect or standard Danish, Kirsten replies: gør hun gør sådan you see she does so if she says hun hvis hun siger 'kache' cake ( , dialect) then she says Kirsten:så siger hun kage cake ('kage', standard). The standard pronunciation, 'kage', instead of Kirsten's dialect form 'kache' shows that the friend probably speaks either standard Danish or the regional variety. This extension of Kirsten's social network might be decisive for her linguistic and communicative competence in Danish. At this age level it is characteristic for Kirsten, as well as for most of the other children, having dialect as their second language, that the interference from German is dominant, but code-switching rarejust the opposite of the situation three years ago. Now the children also ask for help in the dialect (Hvad hedder det? (what is it called). That does not prevent interference, of course, but sometimes they realise they have chosen the wrong code and a correction follows: her er en\n\n/bold\n\nKirsten: her er en /æble Language Norms at School\n\nHere is a Here is a\n\n/ball (dialect). /apple (standard).\n\nIn kindergarten and the first years in school, German tends to be the high status code among the children, quite independent of their code choice, but later in the educational system two parallel sets of high status language usage norms seem to be established: that of the school system: German, and that of the majority of the children: Sønderjysk, the Danish dialect.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_7\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nnext page > Page 8\n\nThe code choice is not entirely the Danish dialect, but it is dominant both in and outside school. If the child's proficiency in the dialect is not good, it might be a stigmatizing factor. The dialect is, for example, used among the pupils both in remarks irrelevant to the teacher-pupil dialogue and in group discussions in lessons where German is the medium of instruction. The teachers are nevertheless addressed in German most of the time, apart from the teacher of Danish, of course. The informants, 12-13 years old, were tape-recorded during group work where the task was to write a Christmas card. In German they were told to help each other and if they wanted to talk about the picture on the post card, they were allowed to do so. The following group consists of three boys; Mads, who has German as his first language, whereas Ole and Ove have German as their second language. vi skal først Mads: Ole:\n\n. vi skal skrive her jo\n\nfirst we are going to we have to write here.\n\nnej først skal vi Mads:\n\n.\n\nfirst are we going to\n\nOle:\n\nhvem siger det?\n\nwho says that.\n\nMads:\n\ndet siger hun\n\nshe says.\n\nher er en Ole: Mads:\n\n. det siger da Heidi (. . . .)\n\nOle: Mads:\n\nhere is a Heidi says so. laughter.\n\nser jeg at de laver lygter I see they make lanterns.\n\nOle+Ove: (laughter) Mads: Ove:\n\nde laver lygter\n\nthey are making lanterns.\n\nOle:\n\nstearinlys\n\ncandles.\n\nOve:\n\nog de bager\n\nand they are baking.\n\nOle: de laver stearinlys they make candles. The dialogue goes on in dialect and Mads is silent for a time. He has succeeded in defining the task to be solved first, but has been defeated linguistically. In this interaction there is a conflict between the norms of the German school and the code choice norm within the group, but there is also\n\n< previous page\n\npage_8\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nnext page > Page 9\n\na conflict about the task. Mads knows about the group norms and starts speaking the dialect, but changes into German, referring to what the teacher said. Ole speaks dialect and does not agree with Mads. Mads goes on switching from dialect to German, and in an attempt to make the friends describe the picture he changes into dialect: ser jeg at de laver Mads: lygter The reaction of the other two is laughter. The reason is probably that Mads speaks dialect but gives a standard pronunciation of the word 'lygter' (lanterns), but it might also be because he has chosen a wrong word. It should have been 'stearinlys' (candles) instead of 'lygter'(lanterns). His following speech shows he knows the word candles in German, Kerzen, and his friend is so kind as to translate it for him into 'stearinlys'. The German code and a mixture of dialect and standard Danish are not accepted, and the norm of the group dominates through the rest of the group work. Not only are some L1 speakers of German frustrated in their L2 acquisition, but some parents also worry about their children. Their attitude is expressed in a questionnaire for a pupil in grade six: Wir haben mit unserem Kind von der Geburt an deutsch gesprochen, um es von Anfang an, auf die deutsche Schule vorzubereiten. Wir erwarteten, es würde dänisch auf der Straße mit seinen dänischen Freunden lernen. Die dänischen Freunde sprachen aber oft deutsch mit ihm (ein schlechtes deutsch übrigens). Das kam unerwartet für uns, und wir würden bei einem nächsten Kind nun 'sønderjysk' sprechen. Standard Danish in Kindergarten and School The minority has been recommended to introduce standard Danish earlier than grade one, partly because of the frustration of the German speakers, partly in order to give the dialect speakers a productive competence of the standard variety. Byram (1986:171) says: strengthening of standard Danish:that consideration be given to earlier introduction of standard Danish, preferably in the light of a scientific investigation of the linguistic socialization of pupils in the early years.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_9\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_10\n\nnext page > Page 10\n\nWhat might happen if standard Danish were introduced in kindergarten? The L1 speakers of German would have diminished their chances of learning the dialectthe language of the minority and the majorityand the dialect speakers might become standard or regional variety speakers of Danish instead of dialect speakers. At any rate, preliminary results from the majority group seem to indicate that most L1 speakers of dialect attending kindergarten from the age of three, where standard Danish is the dominant 'institution language' among the teachers, are not bilingual at the age of five, but have become monolinguals, speaking a regional variety of Danish. As it must be just as important for the minority children that they get a chance to establish the language which is dominant within the German minority as it is that they acquire standard Danish at that age, an earlier introduction of standard Danish might be counterproductive. By introducing one hour a week in grade one with a standard-speaking teacher, as was the case some years ago, where the children are neither allowed to read nor to write in Danish, but are allowed to play games, to sing, to get traffic instructions etc., the children get the impression that standard Danish is the norm in such situations or activities within the minority and the group, and they try to speak standard Danish. In fact social activities like the above mentionedapart from singingare connected to the dialect within most of the minority, and the majority by the way. In that way the Danish lesson might create a conflict for some of the L1 speakers of dialect. They feel their dialect is of no use when they speak to their only Danish-speaking teacher. What the children want is 'real Danish', as they say, and by that they do not mean standard Danish, but to read and write in Danish, as well as they learn to read and write in German. My suggestion is that the reading process in German from grade one be supplemented by reading in Danish. The reading and writing process in standard Danish does not demand standard Danish as a spoken language (cf. Goodman et al., 1979). Let the children use their dialect when both telling and retelling stories and do not correct deviations in the written language that originate from the dialect. Let the German speakers practice what they have picked up until now in dialect, a chance they will not get very often in the classroom interaction because group work does not seem to be used much at that level. The Danish teacher and the German teacher agree on a thematically based instruction and discuss the goal and the content of the lessons day to day or week to week. Such a coordinated reading process in the two languages is realised in intercultural education in Germany (cf. Wolf, 1986), and the two languages do not seem to disturb each other. Gradually standard Danish is introduced as a spoken language, but not without the children's awareness of its function within the minority and the\n\n< previous page\n\npage_10\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_11\n\nnext page > Page 11\n\nmajority, and not until they know about the function of the dialect. Do the L1 speakers of German then learn both dialect and standard Danish? If they do not learn the dialect from their classmates, being allowed to speak it in the Danish lessons and speaking it as group language, if they do not learn it from the Danish teacher's speaking it, or from friends at home, they probably will not learn it before leaving school. I doubt one can teach a dialect as a second language in school. It has an informal social function and a status other than that of a standard language. If the children do not acquire a receptive and a productive competence in standard Danish before leaving school, the curriculum of the subject Danish must be changed. Until now research has not determined the school-leavers' competence, so only time will show. An insight into the position of the three languages, Sønderjysk, standard Danish and German, within the minority and the majority might, however, compensate for a lack of linguistic proficiency. Being confronted with an essential need for mastering, for example, standard Danish completely for a job, psychological, sociological and metalinguistic knowledge will help them to come up to the standard very quickly.

Abstract This paper deals with the questions of two children (L1 Spanish, ages 6 and 9) to children and adults in Swedish. The questions are taken from a corpus of spontaneous audio-recorded conversation. The form and content of the learners' questions are examined, as well as aspects of learner-initiated question exchanges. Questions from the younger child to other children often serve to establish social relationships and to play with language. Questions to adults elicit information. The learner is more active in exchanges with children than with adults. The older learner's questions to both children and adults elicit information, and she is equally active with both types of interlocutors. Introduction Questions have long been a favorite subject of second language (L2) acquisition research, mostly from the point of view of syntactic development (cf. McLaughlin, 1984: 105ff). The present study, however, is concerned with questions in a framework of dialogue, thus tying in to a growing interest in discourse in language acquisition (see McTear, 1985 for L1, and Larsen-Freeman, 1980; Hatch, 1983; Glahn & Holmen, 1985 and Day, 1986 for L2). In my paper, 1 I explore some of the differences between child L2 learners' questions to children and adults, and the properties of question exchanges with the two types of interlocutors. The introductory part of the paper sums up some general characteristics of child-child and child-adult conversation in a first and in a second language. After a presentation of the children and the corpus, results are given in two sections, each of which also contains brief overviews of earlier research. The\n\n< previous page\n\npage_13\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nnext page > Page 14\n\nfirst section deals with the form and meaning of questions, and the second with question exchanges. Child-Child and Child-Adult Conversation The earlier view of L1 child-child conversation was very much influenced by Piaget's (1926) opinion that children are egocentric and often do not adjust to the listener. This seemed to be borne out by experimental evidence to the effect that children have difficulty in describing objects so that another person can identify them from the description (cf. Lloyd & Beveridge, 1981), and it could explain why children with little input from adults have been reported to develop more slowly linguistically (see Bates, 1975). Furthermore, a large number of studies have documented syntactic, prosodic, etc. adjustments by adults to children (cf. Snow, 1986). However, observational studies of natural conversation among even small children have indicated a high degree of coherency (Keenan, 1974 and others), and children from the age of two have been reported to adjust linguistically to infants (Shatz & Gelman, 1973; Sachs & Devin, 1976; Dunn & Kendrick, 1982). But there are still differences. Dunn & Kendrick (1982) found pragmatic differences between mothers' and siblings' speech to infants, and Tomasello & Mannle (1985) report, for example, that siblings do not reply to the same extent as mothers. Likewise, in second language acquisition, not only adults but also children show evidence of adjusting to children learning a second language (overview in Hatch, 1983; studies on children's adjustments by Katz, 1981 and Hirvonen, 1985). Camaioni (1979) characterises the role of the adult in L1 conversation as that of a teacher who engages the children in rigid patterns of interaction, whereas a child will leave more room for his peer, in play-type situations. Thus, peer conversation is said to be 'symmetric' and child-adult conversation 'asymmetric'. In a study of an eight-year-old acquiring English, Peck (1978) reports similar conversational patterns in L2 communication. Meaning was central in conversation between a native adult and the learner, whereas a child interlocutor left more freedom for the learner to respond, e.g. with language play. Nauclér (1985) also stresses the rigidity of child-adult L2 interaction in a daycare center. The Children The subjects of this study are two Spanish-speaking sisters from Latin America. The youngest child, whom I will call Ana, was six years old when\n\n< previous page\n\npage_14\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nnext page > Page 15\n\nthe study was made. She went daily to a Swedish daycare center where she was the only Spanish-speaking child, and she did not receive any systematic instruction in Swedish. Her elder sister, called Rina, was nine years old. She was subjected to intensive training in Swedish, together with other immigrant children in a preparatory class. Neither of the children had much contact with Swedish speakers in their free time. Data Collection Once a week, if possible, I audio-taped the learners during their usual interaction with children and adults. The recordings of Ana were made at the daycare center and those of Rina at an activity center (Sw. ''fritidshem') in the school. In both places the children were doing similar things, such as drawing, baking, playing. The recordings were made by means of small radio microphones the learners carried in a belt. Thus, they were free to run around and engage in all activities as usual. The equipment and my own presence influenced the behaviour of the learners and others very little, as far as I can judge. Recordings with Ana were begun two weeks after she started going to the daycare center and were continued for eight months. The first recordings of Rina were made when she had been going to school for ten weeks and were continued for five months, until she moved to another school. Prior to going to daycare center or school, the learners had almost no exposure to Swedish. The Corpus For this study, I extracted all of Ana's and Rina's questions in Swedish from the transcripts, as well as all other utterances by them and others in question exchanges initiated by them. By a question I mean one or in some cases two utterances with the function of eliciting a verbal response, regardless of whether a response actually occurs; cf. Ahrenberg (1987) for an extensive discussion of questions. Excluded are requests for clarification or confirmation, which depend upon an earlier utterance of another speaker. For the term 'question exchange', see below. For Ana there are about 900 questions which are identified as directed to an adult or child, for Rina about 350. This disproportion is due to the fact that Ana talks more, that the recordings of her are generally longer, and that more recordings have been made. However, as can be gathered from Table 1, questions form a larger proportion of Rina's utterances. For both Ana and Rina, questions are a greater part of their utterances to adults.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_15\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_16\n\nnext page > Page 16\n\nTable 1 Questions in proportion to all learners' utterances (in percentages) Learner To adults To children Ana 12% (315/2616) 9% (576/6562) Rina 20% (184/911) 16% (169/1042) Questions Meaning For L1 child-child conversation, van Hekken & Roelofsen (1982) report that five-year-olds often use questions as a means of influencing a peer (e.g. to ask for permission or suggestions), while older children's (11 years) questions serve more to get information. The meanings of Ana's and Rina's questions to children and adults are shown in Table 2. The questions that occur significantly more often to adults (by chi-square test, p<0.05) concern own action (What shall I do with it?), label (What is it?) and cause (Why do you do that?) for Ana; and own action for Rina. To children, Ana puts more questions about ownership (Is it yours?) and opinion and will (Do you like it?). She also makes use of what I call dialogue initiators, i.e. questions which are obviously not meant to elicit information, Table 2 Meaning of questions (in percentages) Ana Rina To ad To ch To ad To ch Meaning N (315) (576) p (184) (169) p Own action 51 31 <0.001 65 7 <0.001 Label 16 8 <0.001 10 34 <0.001 Cause 7 2 <0.001 9 12 n.s.

Dialogue initiators include nonsense syllables with question intonation[bibibi'biba]?and, more often, repeated questions like Va heter du? (What's your name?) or Alskar du Pia? (Do you love Pia?): cf. Garvey (1977:43) for L1 and Nemoianu (1980:34ff) for L2. Rina often asks the other immigrant children about labels in Polish or Persian. She also wants to know what the others are doing, the whereabouts of objects or the role in play (Are you the little sister?), and the opinion or will of the children. One may say that Ana's questions to children mostly have to do with social relationships, directly or indirectly, whereas her questions to adults are more concerned with the way things are or should be. Rina's questions are more matter of fact, both to children and adults, and the playful character of some of Ana's questions lacks a counterpart in Rina's. Form For pre-school native children, several studies (cf. Tyack & Ingram, 1977) report that about 60% of the children's questions are yes/no questions. Ana's questions are in the majority of cases yes/no questions both to children and adults. Rina likewise uses more yes/no questions to adults, but more wh questions to children. This can be seen as a result of the informationseeking character of her questions to children; to ask about labels, places, etc. one needs wh-questions. Note that in Table 3 the figures do not sum to 100%, mainly because not all question utterances are heard so clearly that they can be classified. A striking fact about question form (see Table 4 below) is that questions to adults are more often incomplete, in that they are not framed as a complete sentence but as a word or a phrase, e.g. den? (that?). Ana also uses vocalizations that do not correspond to Swedish words, such as [a:]? To children, Ana utters two-part constructions consisting of a statement followed by a short wordusually ja? (yes? )or vocalization as a tag to bring about the desired reply, e.g. in Ja kan hjälpa. Ja? (I can help. Yes?). Similar constructions are described by Berninger & Garvey (1982) in L1 and Nicholas (1986) in L2.

The grammatical incompleteness of questions to adults is not surprising when one considers that the questions are used in a context of ongoing, visible activity. A very simple signal from the child suffices to make the adult offer the required information. Many questions to children have other functions and require a fuller linguistic expression. On the other hand, Ana's questions to children, in particular, are probably unanalyzed formulas (see Wong Fillmore, 1976) and occur time and time again. Exchanges The Exchange So far we have looked at the learners' questions in isolation. The rest of the paper will deal with exchanges (cf. Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975), which\n\n< previous page\n\npage_18\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_19\n\nnext page > Page 19\n\nconsist of at least a question and a response, plus, optionally, some frame and follow-up moves. Stenström (1984) describes in great detail question exchanges between native speakers of English. Before considering each part of the exchange, I will say something about the quantitative aspects. Dominance For Ana, there is a marked quantitative difference in her contribution with adults and children. In those question exchanges she initiates with children she contributes 64% (670) of the utterances in the whole exchange; with the adults she contributes only 48% (512; chi-square: p<0.001). Rina contributes slightly over 50% both with children and adults (54%, i.e. 199, and 51%, i.e. 330, to be exact). The qualitative aspects of the difference for Ana are dealt with below. Frame When the question is preceded by one or more utterances from the learner, those utterances are usually calls for attention. Ana uses names of persons, and Rina also calls out titta (look), which takes on a more general meaning 'listen to me', which it does not normally have in Swedish. Sometimes the listener will confirm by saying mm or ja (yes). It is somewhat more common for adults to offer such confirmations than for children. Question If the learner's question is not answered, she may, of course, simply give up. But in many cases Ana and Rina show great tenacity and flexibility in their efforts to get an answer. One of the simplest strategies is to use a verbatim repetition of the question, as Ana does when a child doesn't respond to Hur gammal e du? (How old are you?). Another strategy is to request a response by means of a word or vocalisation such as va? (what?), ja? (yes?), nej? (no?), aa?, or mm?. The question may also be followed by a suggested answer: Hur gammal e du? Fyra? How old are you? Four? Ana: Fyra? Fyra? Four? Four? Of particular interest for the light they shed on formal competence are the modifications questions may undergo if they are not answered. Having uttered in vain a nonsense question [bibi'biba]?, Ana then adds another syllable of\n\n< previous page\n\npage_19\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_20\n\nnext page > Page 20\n\nthe same sort initially: [bibibi'biba]?, Another type of modification amounts to specifying the referent: De e dina, Pia? Pia. De e It is yours, Pia? Pia. It is Ana: dina, Pia? De e din en docka? yours, Pia? It is yours a doll? Modification may also mean a change from a single word to a full-blown sentence: Du? Pia. Pia, du kommer You? Pia. Pia, you're coming Ana: imorron? tomorrow? A yes/no question can be turned into a wh-question. Du också hunden? (Are you also a dog?) becomes Vad e du? (What are you?). And, conversely, wh- questions become yes/no questions: Va'vems' e den? (Whose is it?) is changed into De e din? (It is yours?). Rina is somewhat more inclined to use modifications than Ana. For example, Va gör ja? (What shall I do?) becomes Va ritarja? (What shall I draw?). Rina possesses a more advanced competence in L1 and L2 and is cognitively more mature. Thus, it is in line with expectations that she would make greater use of modifications, rather than verbatim repetitions. Ana re-initiates questions more often to children than to adults. For Rina it is the other way around. In general Ana has to work harder to initiate dialogues with children than Rina, and re-initiations are one result of this. Response Whereas in adult-adult conversation almost all questions are responded to (e.g. Stenström, 1984), children have frequently been observed to break that rule (Dore, 1977; van Hekken & Roelofsen, 1982). In this corpus as well, adults respond more often than children. From adults, Ana receives a verbal response, immediately or after some tries, in 80% (253) of the cases; from children only in 51% (292). The difference for Rina is smaller: 78% (143) versus 66% (111). From the adults, the learners often get a complete sentence in reply. Children restrict themselves more often to a single word or a phrase, which in many cases is a noun, a 'yes' or a 'no'. To Ana, children reply with a nej (no) more often than adults. As will be seen below, conflict is characteristic of many dialogues between Ana and children, and negative replies are one reflection of conflict.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_20\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_21\n\nnext page > Page 21\n\nFollow-up After the response, the dialogue can continue with follow-up moves from both participants. One early dialogue from Ana's corpus demonstrates what can be done with very small means: Ana:\n\n[bibi'biba]? [bibibi'biba]? [a:]\n\nChild:\n\nYes.\n\nAna:\n\nNej? [ebibibi'biba]? [ebibibibi'biba]?\n\nNo?\n\nChild:\n\nJa.\n\nYes.\n\nAna:\n\nJa? A nej. Nej?\n\nOr no.\n\nChild:\n\nNej.\n\nAna:\n\nJa ja ja. Ja?\n\nChild:\n\nJa.\n\nAna:\n\nJa. [ejbibibibibi'biba]?\n\nChild:\n\nJa.\n\nJa? Tack så mycke Ana: Tack så mycke, Pia. Thanks a lot. It is mainly through the use of the polars 'yes' and 'no', addition of nonsense syllables, and shifts in prosody that Ana carries on the conversation. And the other child plays willingly along. The exchange is typical in that Ana does not accept the first reply but continues to request confirmation and reinitiate questions. The playful character of the dialogue is also evident in the next example: An: Va heter du?\n\nWhat's your name?\n\nCh: Katarina. An: Katarina, Katarina? Ch: Mm. An: Catalina. A ja. Katarina. Here, Ana has discovered that Swedish Katarina with /r/ corresponds to Spanish Catalina with /1/. In another exchange, Ana substitutes the original sounds of the reply with nonsense syllables, keeping only the stress pattern intact: An:\n\nVa heter du?\n\nCh:\n\nKatarina.\n\nAn:\n\n[tçuju'juju].\n\nWhat's your name?\n\n< previous page\n\npage_22\n\nnext page > Page 22\n\nBesides language play, a characteristic of Ana's dialogues with children is conflict. Ana often rejects the child's reply, and Ana's rejection may in turn be rejected, etc.: An:\n\nStina kommer idag? Nej.\n\nStina will come today? No.\n\nCh:\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nAn:\n\nJo.\n\nYes.\n\nCh:\n\nNo, Ana.\n\nNo, Ana.\n\nAn:\n\nStina inte kommer.\n\nStina will not come.\n\nCh:\n\nNo.\n\nNo.\n\nAn:\n\nNo?\n\nNo?\n\nCh:\n\nNej.\n\nCh2: Jo. An:\n\nNähä.\n\nCh2: Joho An:\n\nNo. Yes.\n\nJo.\n\nCh2: Nähä. Etc. Ana's rejections in many cases seem to be part of a strategy to maintain a dialogue, rather than serious objections to another's views. Exchanges with adults are very different. As mentioned above, adults tend to take over much of the exchange, although it was initiated by Ana in the first place. Ana's contribution may be confined to imitations of the adult's reply: An:\n\nLa cola?\n\nThe tail?\n\nEn svans ja. De har du rätt i, Ana. Adult:Han fick ingen svans.\n\nA tail, yes. That's right, Ana. He didn't get a tail.\n\nAn:\n\n[e'vas] [e'svas] [e'svases]\n\nImitates the word svans (tail).\n\nAd:\n\nSvans.\n\nTail.\n\nAn:\n\nEn svans.\n\nA tail.\n\nAd: Mm. Mm. When Rina imitates a reply, it is usually a reply from a child, not an adult. And the word imitated is Polish or Persian. It is in many cases the adult who follows up her own reply to Ana: An: Mm? Mm?\n\nMm? Mm?\n\nAd: A så på andra hållet. För\n\nAnd then the other way\n\n< previous page\n\npage_23\n\nnext page > Page 23\n\naround. For those marks should face dom märkena ska va uppåt. De upwards. That mark should be in that där märket ska va på de hållet. direction. Holmen's (1985:75) remark that native speakers 'consistently get in the last word' is indeed relevant here. The adult may also become a teacher: An:Blomma?\n\nFlower?\n\nYes. Good. And that flower is called . . . Ja. Bra. Å den blomman heter . . . ros. rose. Rose. Ad:Ros. An:Ros.\n\nRose.\n\nAd:Ja. Precis som . . . rosa.\n\nYes. Just like . . . pink (Sw. rosa).\n\nAn:Rosa.\n\nPink.\n\nAd:Mm. Ros. Mm. Rose. Another persistent feature of dialogues with adults is negotiation for meaning and more precise information: We will go out? We will go An:Vi ska gå ut? Vi ska gå ut? out? Ad:Ja. Vi ska gå en runda.\n\nYes. We'll go for a walk.\n\nAn:Vi ska gå ut?\n\nWe will go out?\n\nNo. Only me and Sven and Ad:Nä. Bara ja d Sven å Kalle. Kalle. An:[a'do]?\n\n[a'do]?\n\nAd:Å ja.\n\nAnd me.\n\nAn:E du ska gå ut?\n\nYou will go out?\n\nAd:Va?\n\nWhat?\n\nAn:E ska pd biblioteket?\n\nGoing to the library?\n\nAd:Nä. De eja . . . å . . .\n\nNo. It's me . . and . . .\n\nNä. Men du . . . du a Sven å No. But you . . . you and Sven An:Kalle biblioteket? and Kalle the library? Ad:Nej.\n\nNo.\n\nAn:Nej.\n\nNo.\n\nAd:Ska vi gå ner till torget.\n\nWe'll go down to the square.\n\nAn:[tuwe]?\n\nThe square?\n\nAd:Torget ja.\n\nThe square, yes.\n\nAn:Ad.\n\nOh.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_23\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_24\n\nnext page > Page 24\n\nIn contrast to Ana, Rina does not play with language and does not argue to the same extent. With children as well as with adults, Rina is concerned with getting at the facts: De e på svenska? En bok pd It is in Swedish? A book in R: svenska? Swedish? Nej. Inte på svenska å inte på No. Not in Swedish and not in Ch: polska. Polish. R: Vilken språk?\n\nWhat language?\n\nCh:På ryska.\n\nIn Russian.\n\nR: Ja har inte (---) på ryska. I haven't (---) in Russian. This is not so different from Rina's dialogues with adults, such as the one below: Får ja måla den? Får ja måla R: den?\n\nMay I paint it? May I paint it?\n\nAd:Rina, den ska brännas i en ugn. Rina, it will burn in an oven. R: Va e egn?\n\nWhat is oven?\n\nDen ska brännas i en ugn . . . där de blir varmt varmt varmt varmt. Förstår du? Nästan åttahundra grader varmt . . . så Ad:den blir hård.\n\nIt will burn in an oven . . . where it gets hot hot hot hot. Do you understand? Almost eight hundred degrees hot . . . so it gets hard.\n\nR: Men de e hård.\n\nBut it is hard.\n\nJa. Men den går lätt sönder nu. Yes. But it breaks easily now. Ad:Den håller inte så bra. It doesn't hold so well. R: Aha.\n\nAha.\n\nAd:Nä. /. . ./ Discussion\n\nNo. /. . ./\n\nThe foregoing figures and examples have given ample evidence that the learners' questions and contributions to exchanges are indeed different with adults and children. There are also great individual differences between the two learners. One can characterise the learners', especially Ana's, role in interaction with the adults as more passive. This is reflected in the higher proportion of\n\n< previous page\n\npage_24\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_25\n\nnext page > Page 25\n\nquestions about own actions to adults, as well as in the higher proportion of incomplete sentences. It would still be an incorrect conclusion that interaction with children is more beneficial to syntactic development; Ana's questions to children may be syntactically more complete, but the same questions recur again and again. With children, Ana gets many opportunities to engage in dialogues as an active partner. She can count upon the other child to play along in dialogues that involve very little exchange of information and put very low demands upon her knowledge of vocabulary and grammar. She works hard at getting into the group. With adults she is more passive, although she and the adult both work at finding out the other's message. This fits in with observations by Peck (1978). Rina is a different case. We do not find such differences between dialogues with adults and with children. Instead, there is a concern about meaning, regardless of the age of the partner. There are several possible explanations for this. Rina is older, and is probably past the age of language play. Her classmates are second language learners like herself, with a restricted language competence, and there is not an existing group that she has to break into. Rina is also a more reserved person than Ana. In a forthcoming report based on the same corpus I will describe these and other (developmental) aspects of second language dialogue in greater detail. Acknowledgements I wish to thank the two learners who willingly let themselves be recorded, as well as all other children and personnel. Thanks are also due to Bengt Sigurd for comments on an earlier draft of the paper. Notes 1.

Abstract The study deals with the question of bilingualism from the point of view of monolingual and bilingual language users' interactive skills when conversing with second language learners. Dyads of 8-10-year-old children (native speakers with learners of English and native speakers with other native speakers) were recorded in free play and game instruction tasks. The data were analyzed quantitatively for a number of syntactic and discourse variables to find out how monolingual and bilingual children modify their speech when talking with learners. The monolingual and bilingual children studied here seem to differ in their discourse approach to the learner: the bilingual children use less obvious modification strategies and resort to modification at the discourse level only. The monolingual children modify both syntactically and at the discourse level. Foreigner Talk and Peer Talk In many schools all over the world, teachers and students alike come into contact with foreign children, most of whom initially have to go through the process of acquiring a new language. Those interested in psycholinguistics and second language acquisition have a special interest in how we communicate with learners and also in how children communicate with learners of their own age. In other words, we are interested in input and interaction patterns between learners and native speakers. From descriptions of native speakers talking with learners we might be able to deduce patterns or ways of communicating potentially helpful to learners. In this study, eight learners of English matched in age with native speakers of English, each learner with both a monolingual and a bilingual child, were\n\n< previous page\n\npage_27\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page > Page 28\n\nrecorded in dyads in a free play situation and a game instruction task. The control material of native speakers talking with each other was collected from the same children who played with each learner. The study was concerned with two broad questions: firstly, whether children modify their speech when talking with learners and, secondly, whether monolingual and bilingual children differ in this respect. A number of syntactic variables, syntactic discourse indicators and the discourse structure of the conversations were studied quantitatively. The study falls under the general heading of simplified codes or foreigner talk (FT) studies. This type of research started in the 1970s with Ferguson's (1972) and Ferguson & DeBose's (1977) suggestions about FT as a modified, either simplifying or non-simplifying, code. Several studies since (e.g. Long, 1980; Long, 1983; Freed, 1981; Arthur et al., 1980; Hatch, Shapira & Gough, 1978; Hirvonen, 1985) have highlighted the fact that second language learners are exposed to similarly modified input language as first language learners: pauses, limited vocabulary, brevity of syntactic structures and repetitions characterise this register. It has, however, become clear that syntactic modifications are not as consistently observed in FT as interactional modifications. The native speaker's role in child-child conversations has not received much attention, although children receive input not only from adults, parents and teachers, but also from peers (see Katz, 1981; Fillmore, 1976; Hakuta, 1974). Various types of situations between children provide the learner with different types of language learning opportunities. In these situations, the native speaker's role is important, since the native speaker carries the main burden of the conversations. The native speaker's task is to carry on the conversation, but the situations and the native speakers' interactive skills vary and therefore the type of input and interactive situations the learner is engaged in vary from one native speaker interlocutor to another (for differences in children's native speaker-native speaker interactions, see e.g. Foot et al., 1979; in native speaker-learner conversations Gass & Varonis, 1985; Hirvonen, 1986; Leiwo, 1985). Because of the general interest shown in bilingualism recently and the various references to the possible beneficial influence of bilingualism on a child's development as far as metalinguistic awareness and flexibility of language use go, it was decided that bilingual children would be included in the study. Here I shall discuss the results of the monolingual-bilingual comparison. Surface Syntax Variables and Discourse Indicators In general, it was hypothesised that more surface syntax modifications would be shown by the bilingual speakers. The results, however, show that out of\n\n< previous page\n\npage_28\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page > Page 29\n\nnearly twenty variables, only five vary significantly between monolingual and bilingual speakers. Of these, four vary seemingly in the direction of monolinguals modifying their speech more. These variables are the following: 1. the number of full verbal groups/utterance, 2. the distribution of surface sentence types, 3. the number of attention-getting devices, 4. the number of vocatives, 5. use of non-immediate reference. The first two variables, however, differ significantly between monolingual and bilingual native talk (NT) as well as between monolingual and bilingual foreigner talk (FT). This indicates that monolinguals use less complex language both in NT and FT. This is also reflected in utterance length, which is shorter for monolinguals. Both groups modify their utterance complexity. It seems that some differences between monolinguals and bilinguals reflect differences in their NT behaviour, and not differences in their FT behaviour. The distribution of surface sentence types also shows clear differences between monolinguals and bilinguals both in FT and NT, and both groups again show modification in FT: fewer statements, more commands and more questions are used when speaking to a learner. The different sentence types occur in different proportions in monolinguals and bilinguals' speech, reflecting their NT style, e.g. the bilinguals tend to use more statements. The other three variables show no significant differences between monolingual and bilingual NT and it is possible, therefore, that they may prove useful in distinguishing between monolingual and bilingual FT. The use of vocatives and attention-getting devices (e.g. Look!, Here!) is significantly modified in monolingual FT, but not at all in bilingual FT. For instance, in monolingual FT, 7% of all utterances contain a vocative as opposed to 1.1% in NT. The corresponding figures for bilinguals are 0.8% in FT and 1.1% in NT. Only the occurrence of fewer utterances with non-immediate reference in bilingual speech supported the hypothesis of differences between monolinguals and bilinguals. The bilinguals use significantly fewer non-immediate references in their FT than the monolingual speakers, who do not seem to modify their reference in the direction of the immediate environment and the present when talking to learners. These features show the different levels from which the native speaker can select modification strategies: the complexity of surface sentence structure; the presence, in this structure, of certain interactional characteristics of the discourse, e.g. the use of vocatives; and the global discourse structure, e.g. the use of reference. Looking at these variables, it seems that monolinguals resort more to the surface syntax strategies than bilinguals.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_29\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nnext page > Page 30\n\nThe differences proposed may be the result of the different experiences, attitudes and expectations that the two groups of children have. The monolinguals with little FT experience have possibly only one model to follow, that of parents speaking to younger siblings, and some of them do not even have this. Also, because they are faced with a new situation they may resort to the first means available to them, i.e. verbally grabbing the interlocutor. They may expect the learner not to understand and, therefore, feel that obvious strategies are the best. The bilinguals, even with limited FT experience, probably have different expectations. They know that people with limited linguistic skills understand something, and can be made to understand. Some of the children may actually find it difficult to comprehend that the other person does not know the language. Because s/he can communicate in two or three languages, others can as well. They treat the learners more as equals and are perhaps less likely to have stereotypic reactions to them. The bilinguals' attempts at communication seem to be modified more at the discourse level rather than at the obvious interactional level of attention-getting. Bilinguals may, due to their metalinguistic awareness and different experiences, use different patterns of modification. Discourse Structure Discourse Role and Commodity In the descriptive model used, dialogue is interpreted as a process of exchanges involving two variables: the nature of the commodity being exchanged (topic) and the roles of the speakers that are defined by the exchange process. In this Halliday (1984) model, code is defined as 'potential for behaviour', and behaviour as 'the actualization of the potential in a real-life situation'. The model suggested by Halliday (1984) has been used in the Bristol Language Development Project. In this project a large number of Bristol children were studied in their language development up to and including early school age (Wells, 1975; Wells, Montgomery & Maclure, 1979). In these analyses, conversations are considered as 'the formal realization of simultaneous selections from the sets of options available in three major areas of meaning' (Wells, Montgomery & Maclure, 1979). The three areas of meaning are interpersonal purpose, i.e. establishing, maintaining and specifying relations between speakers, ideational, i.e. transmitting information, and textual, i.e. the organization of meanings as a repertoire of discourse options. Two of these, the interpersonal and the ideational, are discussed here. Figure 1 presents the discourse options network.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_30\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_31\n\nnext page > Page 31\n\nFigure 1 The repertoire of discourse options according to Wells, Montgomery & MacLure, 1979 In this network, the discourse role assumed by the speaker is to initiate, continue or respond. Initiating is either giving or requesting a commodity. When responding, the speaker either gives-on-request or acknowledges the commodity received. 'Continue' covers those cases in which the speaker both responds and initiates in the same utterance, e.g. in 'No, you can borrow mine' as an answer to the question 'Should I buy this book?'. The discourse commodity is either goods and services or information. In case of goods and services, the exchange of symbols helps to bring about the exchange, whereas information is realised only through language: the exchange of symbols is the exchange of information. Three types of information are differentiated: display, non-display and textcontingent. In asking for display information, the speaker knows the answer and requests a display of the interlocutor's knowledge, as in classrooms. In exchanging non-display information, speakers are engaged in genuine information exchange. Text-contingent information is information about the discourse itself, which is either specified, confirmed or repeated. The distribution of the discourse role varies significantly between monolingual and bilingual FT, but the same variation can be found in NT as well. The\n\n< previous page\n\npage_31\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_32\n\nnext page > Page 32\n\nmonolingual children initiate by making more requests and giving less information or goods and services than the bilinguals. However, both groups modify their FT discourse when initiating conversational exchanges by increasing the proportion of requests, in the case of monolinguals from 24.8% in NT to 33.6% in FT. For bilinguals the corresponding figures are 19.3% in NT and 24.9% in FT. In monolingual FT this change is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the response roles assumed by the speakers: there are fewer occasions in FT than in NT conversations either to give-on-request or to acknowledge the interlocutor's contributions. In bilingual speakers' conversations there is less variation between NT and FT. Monolinguals and bilinguals do not differ significantly in NT in the type of commodity exchanged, but there are clear differences between these two groups in their FT behaviour: the monolinguals employ more goods and services and less information. That is to say, when they initiate a conversational exchange, we can expect them to request goods and services more often than they either ask for or give information. Of the following two examples, (1) is then the type of exchange to be expected in monolingual FT and (2) is more likely to be found in NT or in bilingual FT: EXAMPLE 1 (NS: a monolingual girl; NNS: an Arabic-speaker, girl) NS: Chazal. NNS:Eh? Listen to all the noise. (Request for goods and services.) Listen to all the noise, NS: listen. It's our class. NNS:What? NS: It's our class making the noise. EXAMPLE 2 (NS: a bilingual girl; NNS: a Malay-speaker, boy) NS: What country do you come from? (Request for information.) NNS:From B. NS: It's down China somewhere. (Request for information.) NNS:Yeah. NS: I come from P. Are you a Muslim? (Request for information.) NNS:I don't know The difference between the two groups can be accounted for by modifications in the monolinguals' FT: the bilinguals again seem to react to the learners in the same way as to other native speakers. The only way they modify the commodity exchanged is by increasing the use of text-contingent information,\n\n< previous page\n\npage_32\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_33\n\nnext page > Page 33\n\nespecially repetitions. The same increase can also be found in monolingual FT, as in Example 3: EXAMPLE 3 (NS: a monolingual boy; NNS: a Chinese-speaker, boy) NS:\n\nDavid, do you know how to play that?\n\nNNS: Eh? NS:\n\nThe other game you played. (Specify.) What what game did you play?\n\nNNS: No, I haven't got played games. NS:\n\nWhat games did you play? (Articulates clearly.) (Repeat.)\n\nNNS: Nothing. NS: Just the Lego? (Confirm.) Display information, in these data, is used exclusively by monolinguals and mostly by one very skilful user of FT in her tutorial sequences. In tutorial sequences the NS takes the role of a teacher and intentionally uses the conversation for didactic purposes. This is what happens in the next example of a tutorial sequence, where the native speaker asks a series of questions about the learner's relation to various Japanese children, although she knows that the learner has one brother and that the other children mentioned are not her relatives: EXAMPLE 4 (NS: a monolingual girl; NNS: a Japanese-speaker, girl) NS:\n\nYou got a brother?\n\nNNS:\n\nYes, short.\n\nNS:\n\nNo, Mitsumi: You got a brother, Mitsumi?\n\nNNS:\n\nYes.\n\nNS:\n\nLittle brother?\n\nNNS:\n\nBig brother.\n\nNS:\n\nBig brother. Is Kyoto your SISTER?\n\nNNS:\n\nNo.\n\nNS:\n\nIs YUKI your sister?\n\nNNS: No. Sequence structure The texts have been analyzed as sequences to consider stretches of conversation larger than an exchange but shorter than the whole interaction.\n\n< previous page\n\npage_33\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_34\n\nnext page > Page 34\n\nA sequence is defined as 'a stretch of conversation having a unitary topic and purpose' (Wells, 1975:38). There are various criteria for deciding when such a unitary topic and purpose may be considered to have occurred, such as a change in speaking turns and overt marking by utterances which mark a change of topic, or a conclusion, or a change of activity. It has been suggested by Coulthard, Montgomery & Brazil (1981) that sequences can be identified in terms of surface recognition criteria, but no internal structure has been found in the data studied (doctor-patient interviews, committee discussions and broadcast interviews). The following sequences have been suggested in the Bristol Project (Wells, 1975:37-9): 1. Control: controlling the behaviour of one's interlocutor, either by commanding, suggesting, requesting action, etc.; 2. Representational: exchanging information, without the direct indication of an action as a desired goal; 3. Expressive: expressing feelings and attitudes as an affective response to a situation; 4. Tutorial: interactions with a clearly didactic purpose; 5. Procedural: (a subsequence mode) concerned with the channel of communication; used to repair a breakdown in communication or to initiate or to end a sequence. The sequence modes used here are control, representational, expressive, tutorial and play. In addition, a subsequence mode, procedural, is distinguished. Constituents of the subsequences are utterances, each of which realises a particular function in the interpersonal interaction. Play was added as a sequence mode, because it was considered an important mode in child-child speech. Play includes sequences of sound and word play, role play, play routines, etc. Overall, control and tutorial sequences are more frequent in FT, and representational and play sequences in NT. In NT, there is no significant difference between monolinguals and bilinguals, although there is a tendency for bilinguals to use more control mode. Monolingual and bilingual FT, however, differ significantly in the distribution of the sequence types. The difference is clearly apparent in the way the control mode is used: nearly 50% of all utterances in bilingual FT are in the control mode, against nearly 40% in monolingual FT. For both groups, this represents an increase in the use of control mode and a corresponding decrease in the use of representational and play sequences in FT as compared with NT. There seem to be two discrepancies in the result: on the one hand, the monolinguals make more requests for goods and services than the bilinguals\n\n< previous page\n\npage_34\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_35\n\nnext page > Page 35\n\nand this could lead us to expect more sequences whose primary purpose is control in monolingual FT. It may be, however, that what at the discourse role and commodity level is considered to be giving information, at the sequence level can be interpreted as being in the control mode. This is the case in game instructions, which were here interpreted as control mode, if there was an 'indication of an action as a desired goal'. Genuine information, for example, discussions about school and family, were thus separated from control and instructions. This may account for the high proportion of control sequences in the data. The following type of instruction is then interpreted as a control sequence: EXAMPLE 5 (NS: a monolingual girl speaking to a NNS) No no Mona, no you mustn't put it you must put it 'cross there because it's NS:gonna be a wall alongyou're starting now. The difference between the two groups in the use of control and representational modes cannot be explained on the basis of different numbers of game and play interactions: in fact, both groups were engaged in equal numbers of free play and game interactions. On the other hand, it has been argued here that the bilingual children's different attitudes and expectations could result in less modified behaviour. Although one might expect the high proportion of control mode sequences to be a marked modification strategy in FT, what seems to happen is that in FT conversations the bilinguals behave as they do with native speakers. We have seen that bilinguals do modify their speech less than monolinguals in all other respects. Therefore, the increased use of control mode cannot be considered a very highly marked strategy here, rather an indication of the bilinguals' speech style in general. Conclusion The results of the monolingual-bilingual foreigner talk comparison indicate that the monolingual children studied here modify their speech to learners both syntactically and at the discourse level, whereas the bilinguals' modifications are found only at the discourse level. The hypothesis about the bilinguals' heightened sensitivity to problems presented by the foreigner talk situation was not supported by the results. I have suggested that explanations could perhaps be looked for in the speakers' attitudes towards the learner and in their expectations of the speech situation. It is clear, however, that children\n\n< previous page\n\npage_35\n\nnext page >\n\n< previous page\n\npage_36\n\nnext page > Page 36\n\nas well as adults can modify their speaking styles and that they use various strategies to keep the conversation going, to involve the interlocutor, and to repair and to check when communication breaks down. Language acquisition takes place in conversations with other speakers and it is important to study the native speaker's contribution to this process. A skilful user of foreigner talk strategies, even in peer talk, may be able to provide the learner with the right kind of interactive encouragement in addition to the required comprehensible input. The differences discussed in this paper are group differences, but individual differences may be a much more important factor in a foreigner talk situation. These data provide material for further analysis of such individual differences, also between monolingual and bilingual children.
