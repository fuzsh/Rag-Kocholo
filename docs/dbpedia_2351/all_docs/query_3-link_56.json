        "text": "NGO \"Eye Protection\" was established in 2023. In order to help the vulnerable sections of the population who suffered as a result of military operations. The main mission is the development of Ukrainian optometry in accordance with modern international standards and the resolution of professional qualification issues, promotion of morbidity reduction, rehabilitation and restoration of working capacity of the population of Ukraine, and promotion of a healthy lifestyle. We pay a lot of attention to children, because helping children with vision problems is extremely important for their full development and successful inclusion in society. Vision problems can occur for a variety of reasons, such as birth defects, injuries, or illnesses. The \"Healthy Eyes of a Child\" project is an initiative aimed at preserving and improving visual health among children. This program aims to provide affordable and effective medical care, prevention of vision problems, and education and support for parents and teachers. The main components of the \"Healthy eyes of a child\" project: Ophthalmological examinations: - free ophthalmological examinations for children in boarding schools and orphanages. - Detection of various types of vision disorders. Information company: Conducting information events for parents, teachers and the community about the importance of caring for a child's vision. Cooperation with medical institutions: Establishing partnerships with ophthalmology clinics to provide additional consultations and treatment for children with identified problems. Providing financial support for treatment and purchase of glasses for those with limited financial opportunities. The \"Healthy Eyes of a Child\" project seeks to create an environment where eye health becomes an important part of a child's overall health. With the help of this initiative, the formation of customs and knowledge is promoted, which help in maintaining visual acuity and preventing possible problems. It is important to support such initiatives and join them, contributing to the creation of a favorable society for the development of children with visual characteristics.\n\nLegal Trio Paternity Test I'm often asked about legal maternity and paternity tests, so I thought I would provide some information about the various tests through a series of posts. DNA testing can be used to determine if there is a biological relationship between two individuals. This is typically done by obtaining genetic material (DNA samples) from the two individuals via cheek swabs, then comparing these samples. The Trio Paternity Test compares a child’s DNA to the DNA of the biological mother and the alleged biological father. Both parents must participate in this test. If the mother does not participate in the test, it is called the “motherless paternity test”; however, it is preferable to have the child’s mother participate in a paternity test as well, since she contributed 50% of her DNA to the child. The results from this trio test can be used for legal purposes.\n\nThe New York Times reports that #alabama legislators will be proposing ways to ensure #ivftreatment is not prevented by the state’s #supremecourt’s decision to consider #embryos full human beings. Yet the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling is the only logical decision when the belief that #life begins at #conception is enshrined in law. #Science tells us something different though: human embryos, if successfully implanted, may grow to be human beings, but if they do, they will also become placenta. Furthermore, an embryo may never implant into a woman’s uterus. So. Is placenta also a human being with certain rights assigned to humans? Is a woman’s uterus legally liable if an embryo does not implant? Worse, is she liable herself? These are yet more tragic, inhuman consequences of ideological absolutism driving real world #policy and #practice.\n\nWith exceptional image quality and specialized transducers, #SonoScape #P60Exp works brilliantly in providing well-rounded evaluation on reproductive health, including examinations for gynecological disease, fallopian tube patency, follicle growth monitoring, etc. *Specialized Transvaginal Transducers Ingenious design of the crank handle More than 220°large sweeping angle *Superior Endocavity 3D/4D Imaging Impressive improvement of endocavity 3D/4D imaging, works well for routine exams and supports follicle auto measurement and multiple 3D rendering modes. More diagnosis information at higher confidence is acquired, especially for uterine anomalies, observation of endometrium and tumor morphology *HyCoSy with SPI Color coded Hysterosalpingo Contrast Sonography (HyCoSy) is a proprietary feature on P60Exp that can clearly demonstrate the arrival time of contrast agents into different parts of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries. As a result, clinicians are provided with strong and confident evidence to investigate tubal patency for subfertile female. #WomenHealthcare #ReproductiveMedicine #Ultrasound #OBGYN\n\nReversible male contraception by targeted inhibition of serine/threonine kinase 33 Discovery of CDD-2807 is the outcome fact that poorly understood kinase called STK33 is enriched in the testis, and both men and mice that lack this kinase are infertile. More importantly, the effects of CDD-2807 treatment was found to be reversible, and the mice recovered their fertility soon after the treatment was discontinued. CDD-2807 was also nontoxic to the mice. While it easily crosses the blood-testis barrier, and didn't get into the brain at appreciable levels. The study could pave a way for an oral formulation of this or a similar drug to prove safe in additional animal testing and can be studied in men soon for contraception https://lnkd.in/gX2kz5yK https://lnkd.in/g_e2R86R"
