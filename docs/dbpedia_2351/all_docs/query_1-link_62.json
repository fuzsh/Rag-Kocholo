        "text": "How do you create a culture and space of adhocism?\n\nWe wanted to create an environment that isn't just about grand structures or the aesthetics of design, but an environment that is fundamentally rooted in the ordinary and in the adaptive measures we take to fit into ever-changing environments. The workshops were a testament to the power of adhocism and how over-engineering and overthinking often lead to unnecessary complexities.In a situation where most summer schools have a very curated approach and a very calculated outcome, we wanted to take a different approach and embrace the unpredictable, the failures and first and foremost the process itself. By setting a task without context, freeing the student for a wide learning experience, we provided space for learning free of the fear of meeting expectations. The first edition of Paraply was held on 10-18 of August 2023. This year's summer school took place in the Seaplane Hangar H53 in Copenhagen, transformed by Dorte Mandrup in 2001. The building has been home for the Institute of Architecture and Culture of the Royal Danish Academy for over a decade and is now entering a new phase as the academy is moving out. During this moving limbo, we hosted 40 international architecture students for a week of creation.\n\nThis year we marked the 100 years that have passed since Le Corbusier published Vers une architecture, a group of essays defining modernist architecture as we know it â A turning point that has brought both big benefits and big consequences to our built environment. With the climate crisis increasingly defining our everyday life, we find ourselves in a moment where radical transformation is not just a theoretical exercise but an imperative practice. In this critical time, we are forced to reflect on the insights gained from the past century and cast our gaze forward to the everyday realities of the next hundred years. How does architecture evolve from being linear to becoming circular?\n\nThe workshop's primary objective is to fuse environmental awareness with practical adaptability. Participants enter with no prior knowledge of the materials at their disposal or the eventual outcomes of their projects. The aim is to create a mindset where action serves as a mode of thought, emphasizing the act of physically sketching in real space, creating a process where creation evolves from interacting with material â feeling and examining material qualities, thereby creating a functional hierarchy. Mistakes and failures are not discouraged but celebrated as valuable accidents. We believe that progress is found in the friction of process.\n\nWhat if we only worked with materials that are at the end of their life? We purposely started the workshop by creating an opening exhibition, showcasing our collection of waste material that was gathered in days up to the workshop,primarily consisting of leftover materials from the moving process [Ill.1]. As the school is downsizing there was significant waste associated with the move. We wanted to embody that in our process, to emphasize that the building is changing, carefully laying out each finding to emphasize the quality that can be found in waste and to spark our participants' creative processes, showing the participants both their canvas and palette. It was an intentional decision to present the participants with a task with little context. By doing this, there were no obvious paths, no premeditated goals, and no suggested outcome. The only choice they had was their preferred workshop leader. After the opening talks, introducing the central themes and subjects, the participants were organized into three groups, led by Allan Wexler, MacIver-Ek Chevroulet and PARABASE.\n\nALLAN WEXLER, SWEEP THE FLOOR\n\nA 3Ã3â square is marked on the floor at the center of a delineated stage. One row of chairs surrounding it. Before any introductions, Allan Wexler initiated his workshop with a simple directive for each member of the group: \"When your name is called, you will have 16 seconds to stand up, walk toward the square, enter the square, pick up the broom, sweep the floor, place the broom back inside the square, exit the square, walk toward your chair, and sit down.\" Every action, whether it's instinctive, playful, or hesitant, serves as the inception of an idea, weaving a narrative thread that imbues the mundane with significance. One participant at a time would be called by Allan Wexler to sweep the floor. With each try, the sweeping techniques evolved and the boundaries for such a mundane task began to crumble. Every aspect of every move was carefully analyzed and optimized by the group, helping each member of the group to perfect their sweep. The performance acted as a catalyst for the work that lay ahead. Boundaries were immediately broken down between the participants and gave zero room for hesitation. A seemingly banal, boring and insignificant task becomes the topic of an afternoon. A philosophy followed by artist Agnes Martin: beauty is in your mind, not in the rose. The same approach is vital in the design alchemy required to turn abandoned waste into useful and beautiful space. [Ill.2]\n\nMACIVER-EK CHEVROULET\n\nIn the same manner, Maciver-Ek Chevroulet started their workshop by breaking into BWERK [Ill.3], a one-room white pavilion, which sat outside the back of the Seaplane Hangar, used for student exhibitions. âD R I F Tâ, âFitzcarraldo IIâ, âMaking the Impossible Possibleâ â the undertaking of their workshop took many names. The group undertook the challenge of preserving the building by moving it.\n\nThe plan was simple: move the building 800 m, as the crow flies, from its location at the hangar, where it has been since 2017, to the new home at the main campus. The brief set a massive undertaking that proved to be both impossible and possible. The first task broadened the imagination with a drawing exercise â âWhat do you imagine is inside the space, which was locked and key-less?â The second task overcame shyness â âMake a new entranceâ. After forcing a new opening, the move officially began with one last performance in BWERK as we knew it. The act of forcing their entrance into the building removed any hesitancy to begin the deconstruction and moving of the building, and set the pace for the following week.\n\nPARABASE, PARTY\n\nPARABASE started their workshop with a visit to Christiania, documenting details of bricolage architecture, and introducing the act of urban mining. âHow can gathering become creating, by recognizing both the aesthetical and constructional qualities of everyday objects?â Their approach highlighted how some of the most iconic elements in architectural history are derived from an almost accidental representation of an everyday object. Showing appreciation for what is already here and what we already have is a great motivator for creation. Immediately thereafter diving into the material palette we had gathered, the invitation was to create spaces for partying. This sparked a discussion about the spatial needs for a party or social gathering, and where the special moments are created. âHow do we as architects create these spaces around activity?â The participants with PARABASE were free to gravitate toward functions that drew them in, which led to the formation of a team that started to take apart a pavilion for materials, a team that made an inflatable space with scaffolding tarp and dust sheets, and a team that began to explore sound. Over the workshop days, the participants fluidly moved between teams, supporting those who needed them.\n\nTHINKING BY DOING\n\nAllan Wexler's team were tasked with finding an inconspicuous detail or overlooked place within the building, inviting them to craft a stream-of-consciousness text around it and create a small photo essay documenting their findings. These subjects ranged from finding zodiac signs in spots on a window pane, to recognizing the social needs of a brick, to recreating a plumber's stream of thought when installing a sink in a glass box. This led to a multifaceted week in which the main task was to explore each other's findings and fascinations, and to then in smaller groups develop a 16 minute site-specific installation / intervention that made an observer, occupant, or audience aware of the space that they chose [Ill.4]. Alongside this, each person developed their written text, photo essay and sweeping technique throughout the week. This way of working created a unique process where the participants were forced to create in many different mediums, constantly switching back and forth leaving no room for overthinking. With no room for overanalyzing, they were forced to engage with the material that presented itself in the exact moment of presentation. That was the goal from the beginning, to create a space where creation came from the instant engagement with the space and the materials, where you had no choice but to apply yourself to the immediate task at hand instead of spending a lot of time analyzing and over developing. Just go.\n\nThe same mentality was present in Maciver-Ek Chevrouletâs team, after Madame Nielsen joined us to give some historical context to the BWERK exhibition space (previously known as Das Beckwerk) around her personal history and work as an artist [Ill.5]. The building was created for the Funus Imaginarium, an imagined funeral, of the then Claus Beck-Nielsen. The team felt the importance of the building and the history that follows, thereby creating an urgency with the task at hand. The fate of the building was suddenly in their hands. A corner section and a section of the iconic curved walls were quickly chosen as the starting point. Over the course of several days, careful cuts were made dividing the building. This process proved to be much more difficult than first anticipated, so much so that the corner section only moved by 1 millimeter after the first day of cutting [Ill.6]. After the second, by one centimeter. After the third, by one meter [Ill.7].\n\nOUTCOME\n\nThe interplay between music and architecture, often underestimated in recent history, took center stage in the PARABASE group. Two meter tall enclosures for the speakers were built first, functioning as an exocabinet, each employing distinct frequencies to generate vibrations and focal points of sound. These speakers doubled as spaces that visitors could step into. Then a sinuous, inflatable room structured by air emerged, offering a setting for conversations within its confines and delineating a boundary with the outside, constructed using only thin plastic sheets, tape and an air pump: A testament to how simple it can be to create spaces [Ill.8]. And finally, a pavilion made for raving. By deconstructing a pavilion near the hangar, they discovered a skeletal framework. This disassembly yielded six buttress-like elements, which were reconfigured into a hexagonal configuration, expanding the space and function of the old structure [Ill.9]. The roof overhang enveloped visitors, obscuring their view from the chest upward, while a tall hexagonal space at the center illuminated the hangar's ceiling. During the closing ceremony, these three distinctive spaces were inhabited, casting a luminous glow and serving as venues for conversations and raving [Ill.10].\n\nThe culmination of Allan Wexlerâs group work results in presentations that breathe new life into various elements or spaces within the building. An ordinary light switch is transformed into an exploration of electricity [Ill.11]. A lonely brick gains awareness as it becomes an integral part of every action around a breakfast table [Ill.12]. The space beneath the stairs evolves into a captivating theater. And a piece of plumbing that passes through a glass pane evolves into a continuous line connecting multiple glass chambers. The workshop pushed each person to rethink what is intentional and what is accidental. What happens when your person becomes the architecture? Your movement, your thoughts suddenly become the act of architecture.\n\nOn the last day of the workshop the Maciver-Ek Chevroulet team completed the one kilometer move to the campus. One corner of the building was transported on scaffolding on wheels [Ill.13], while a portion of the curved wall miraculously was floated across the harbour with the assistance of empty beer kegs [Ill.14]. Now in the last stage of its life the moving of the building was accompanied by Madame Nielsen who sailed and pulled the surviving pieces to their final destination [Ill.15]. One of the key takeaways from this intense immersion was that architecture isn't just about grand structures or the aesthetics of design; it is fundamentally rooted in the ordinary and in the adaptive measures we take to fit into ever-changing environments. They set sail to fail by approaching the move of the BWERK, but in their failure to complete the move a much more beautiful project emerged.\n\nThe workshops were a testament to the power of adhocism and how over-engineering and overthinking often lead to unnecessary complexities. As brilliantly stated by Maciver-Ek Chevroulet in their closing remarks, ask an architect for shelter from the rain and you will get an entire house. Architectural workshops and summer schools have been a significant part of architectural education, creating space for students to access thinkers and designers from different contexts, and thus influencing their own development. Often, briefs are heavily designed in advance with outcomes carefully calculated for specific purposes and following a particular standard. While such exercises are meaningful learning experiences, they can sometimes become restrictive. In a closing window to meet global climate targets, we need less speculation, less hesitation, less fear, and more direct action. Hope is not a prerequisite for action. Action alleviates anxiety, and through action, solutions are discovered. In an increasingly digital context, architectural design can become abstract with form, tectonics and order following aesthetics without weight. An infinite palette of materiality is achievable in a few clicks, making any formal expression possible from digital model through construction technology. Paraply strips away the speculation, and offers instead imagination. Restrictions are welcome design elements. Form, properties and gesture are there in the abandoned palette, waiting to be discovered and transformed through design alchemy into useful space, requiring no new mining or shipping, requiring only observation and adaptivity.\n\nâ\n\nJakob Ravn Abildgaard is a student at Finder Sted at the Institute of Architecture and Culture, co-founder of Paraply School and editor of KÃ RK magazine.\n\nValentin Abend teaches Sustainable Systems at Parsons School of Design in New York, leading architectural projects under Studio Abend.
