        "text": "Getinge is committed to continue supporting the advancement of clinical and nonclinical study research that relate to disease states, conditions, and treatments relevant to the company’s mission. We recognize the important role that research plays in our mission, both in benefits to patient care and the advancement of medical technology, treatment, and knowledge.\n\nWe aim to provide responsible support. Due to finite resources and regulatory requirements, not every proposal will receive support.\n\nWhat should I expect?\n\nThe application must be completed with all requested information in order to be considered.\n\nAn incomplete application will be delayed and may be denied if the relevant information is incomplete.\n\nDecisions for funding are at the sole discretion of Getinge and decisions are final. Each application will be sent to the relevant business area for alignment with budget considerations before being forwarded to Getinge Research Committee for final review.\n\nApplicants will be informed of the approval status once the decision has been made.\n\nThe representative contacting you may not be privy to the decision factors influencing the final budget decision. However, if support is denied for Compliance purposes, the applicant may be contacted to determine if the compliance issue can be resolved to align with Getinge’s criteria for support prior to the final decision being rendered.\n\nIf a study research grant is awarded, the requesting institution will be required to enter into a written agreement provided by Getinge in order for funds to be released by an authorized signer of the applicant. The applicant should be willing to assume all Sponsor obligations as laid out in applicable research regulations and standards.\n\nWhat if I submitted a study research request outside of this process?\n\nGetinge will work through any applications submitted under the prior process and be in contact with you about the status of the study grant requested. If your request has not been submitted under the prior or this process, and you have not heard since your submission, please re-submit by completing the below form. As appropriate, the Research Committee may request additional information in order for the research grant to comply with our procedures.\n\nFor your convenience, please see below for required documents to be uploaded when filling out the form. These must be provided to be evaluated by the Review Committee.\n\nSigned and dated Principal Investigator’s CV\n\nDetailed Activity Budget (if monetary support is being requested)\n\nProtocol synopsis and if available, protocol draft\n\nIf requesting monetary support, a detailed budget is required for consideration. Items should include:\n\nDirect study costs: start-up costs, participant-related costs, study personnel-related costs, diagnostic fees, testing facility costs, lab evaluations and services that are required as part of the study not considered standard of care, data management and statistical expenses. This should include any overhead.\n\nIndirect study costs: Review fees for ethics/institutional review boards, supply/equipment costs required for the study, publication costs.\n\nNote: compensation is not permitted for fringe benefits of study staff, purchase of capital equipment unrelated to the study or that would generate revenue, general educational or training activities, construction funds for new offices, buildings or funds to establish or expand existing research activities. Payment for staff salaries is not permitted.\n\nWithout a detailed budget, the request cannot be processed.\n\nProcessing of your personal data\n\nSome of the services offered on our website require the processing of your personal data. Getinge process personal data collected on our website for the purpose to evaluate the proposal for a study and the relevant experience of the investigator-sponsor. If your study receives Getinge support, your personal data will also be used for contracting and follow-up of study conduct. To accomplish this, we collect your name and your professional contact details including email, phone number, affiliation/institution name and address, and additional information as provided in your CV.\n\nAs a rule, we do not keep your personal information for longer than necessary for the purposes for which we collected it. Any personal information will be retained for the duration of the proposal processing and study conduct, if relevant. Once the data retention period is terminated, your personal data will be deleted from our systems.\n\nLearn more about Getinge's GDPR Compliance Statement."
