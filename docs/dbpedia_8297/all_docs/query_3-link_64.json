Time codes refer to the approximate times in the ad-supported version of the show.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:00:00):\n\nIt's time for TWiG. This Week in Google, we're gonna talk about, of course, <laugh> ai and that weird statement from a bunch of AI scientists and important people saying, we've gotta avoid a mass extinction event. What? We'll, also weird, right? We'll also talk a little bit about Amazon and all the things they're discontinuing, including the celebrity voices I paid for. And then finally, Nvidia and TPUs, CPUs, GPUs and NPUs. What's the difference? We talked chips and more. Next on TWiG podcasts you love from people you trust. This is TWiG is TWiG.\n\n(00:00:52):\n\nThis is TWiG this week at Google. Episode 718, recorded Wednesday, May 31st, 2023, clean as a whistle. This episode of this week at Google is brought to you by H p e GreenLake, orchestrated by the experts at C E D W, who can help you consolidate and manage all your data in one flexible edge to cloud platform to scale and innovate. Learn more at cdw.com/hpe. It's time for TWiG. This Week in Google the show, we cover the latest news from everybody. But Google, Twitter, meta, Facebook, Google's hair, my hair. We were doing my hair earlier. Stacey iGen Buffam is here. Hello. Stacy. Missed you last week. Hello, Stacy. On I ot.com. Also Mr. Aunt Pruit missed you last week. Yeah. Hands on photography. Twit tv slash hop. Yep. Yep, yep. Good to see you. Sir, you had the week off, or no? You were a little under the weather. I was sick. Yeah. Sorry, mom. You're feeling better though? Oh,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:02:03):\n\nI feel much better\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:04):\n\nNow. I think it's for doing too many pull-ups personally. No,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:02:07):\n\nNever. Never. Okay. I'll actually make that part of my pick the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:10):\n\nWeek discussion. Oh, good. All right. Good. All right. We'll save it for then. <Laugh> also with us, the Leonard Tao, professor for the journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmar Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff. Hello. Did we stop the singing? I didn't. Bonito has a day off. John hasn't figured out how to push the button. Okay. <laugh> Got it. I was, there's the, there's the button. You\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:02:38):\n\nFeel better now.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:02:40):\n\nAh, so why, why, why have the AI scientist now doubled down with a, what is it, a 22 word, press release. It's not even, you know, like a it doesn't explain it or anything. It's just like a statement. A statement released by leading names in ai. It's basically this, I can read it to you. It won't take long. Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI of ex. Look, let me, wait a minute. Slow down. What did you say? Extinction? What the heck does that mean? What mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority? Priority. And then they had, I think somebody said, Hey, you guys, there's other issues too. Oh. Alongside other societal scale risks like pandemics and nuclear war. I think honestly, if you're talking extinction event, most scientists agree global warming is the is the next extinction event. And maybe an asteroid AI signed by Jeffrey Hinton, the Google guy who retired. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Professor of career Science at the University of Montreal, Sam Altman, the c e o of open ai\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:03):\n\nDoes, he wouldn't sign the moratorium cuz he has to keep working.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:05):\n\nSo the, yeah, that's what's weird. These are people who did not sign the, the, the moratorium letter in some cases. Martin Hellman from Stanford it's not as long unless Bill McKibbon, he's the guy who wrote about the, you know, the end of the world on, in the New Yorker.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:04:25):\n\nHe's the climate\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:25):\n\nChange, new climate change.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:04:27):\n\nRight. Climate change end of the world. Yeah. Well, okay, so there's nothing,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:30):\n\nLawrence, he's controversial from Harvard. I like him. Oh,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:32):\n\nIt's controversial to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:33):\n\nSay Norfolk. I trust him.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:35):\n\nDestroy mankind. That mean what what bigger B s D can you imagine\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:40):\n\nIan Goodfellow, who's a Google Deep mind principal scientist? I mean, this is a, a who's who? Where's the money?\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:48):\n\nWhere's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:04:48):\n\nThe money? Lex Friedman, the guy does the podcast. Oh,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:51):\n\nHe's just ridiculous.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:04:53):\n\n<Laugh> the guy who does the podcast. My\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:04:55):\n\nGoodness. <Laugh>. Well, in that case,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:04:58):\n\nMy goodness, we should listen to him. So\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:00):\n\nDustin Moskovitz, who was one of the founders of of Facebook, he's now his son. Well, yeah.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:05):\n\nAgain, yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:06):\n\nBruce Schneider. I love Bruce Schneider, security guru. Maybe we should get Bruce Schneider on to explain why, Bruce, you don't you\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:13):\n\nNeed No, you know, you, you need Emily Bender on.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:15):\n\nOkay. Emily Bender did. She's not a signatory obviously, right? Well,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:19):\n\nExactly. She's not. Cuz she has sanity.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:21):\n\nOkay. She\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:22):\n\nIs the University of Washington computational linguist who says, enough boys, enough. You got, you got problems. The problems are present tense. Deal with them. Now. All this is so much chest pumping.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:05:33):\n\nWell, yes, that is. It's, it, it is marketing. But you know, I a statement, it's not offensive. It's just silly\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:41):\n\n<Laugh> barard getting anything out of this, this 20 word.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:05:45):\n\nWell, okay, this is the real cynic in me, but the cynic in me says people like Sam Altman are because it over it. So overstates what's going on with ai, it makes you think, wow, we're we, we actually we're, they could.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:05:56):\n\nMicrosoft says, we gotta rush. We gotta install this stuff. Oh my God. It's huge. It's powerful.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:00):\n\nWell, or just, I think they're giving a lot more credit. If it's just spicy auto Correct. It ain't gonna <laugh> if ain't gonna wipe out mankind off the face of the earth. Right. So this is, I don't, I'm being very cynical by saying this, but it, but it does, it does promote the notion that this AI is really more significant than I I and many others think it is. I agree.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:06:21):\n\nI agree. And I think the other thing you they got out of it is regulatory capture is that they're, they're, you know, it's, if you watch Altman non Congress, it's let us help design how to regulate us and cut out everybody else.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:33):\n\nBut this is gonna scare Chris Anderson of of Ted Talks Grimes, the musician and artist.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:06:40):\n\nOh, well, well then, then that's it. Forget the\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:43):\n\nPodcast. <Laugh> Aza Raskin. I mean, there are people I respect, oh,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:06:46):\n\nTristan Harris. Of course, of course. Always. But there\n\nLeo Laporte (00:06:49):\n\nAre people I respect on here as well as people. I don't. Well,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:06:52):\n\nAnd if someone sent you that statement and was like, Hey Leo, look, AI is a big deal. We need Congress to regulate it. Can you sign this statement? I mean, my God, you're gonna sign it. These things come from your friends.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:05):\n\nWell, it's also the case that you not I'm not gonna sign it all. Sign it. Well, but no, I'm, what are you saying? You're saying, you're not saying that there is a risk from, of extinction, from ai. Just that if there were one, you should, you should be paid. Well, you shouldn't do it.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:07:18):\n\nThere's basically like, look, AI has the potential to be like really problematic and, you know, maybe we should consider that.\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:07:26):\n\nSo does the, another big problem. So does social media, all of that has a Yeah, you could I know. Really problematic. I know.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:07:33):\n\nThat's why they signed\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:07:34):\n\nIt. You know, this is, that's that's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:07:35):\n\nWhat I'm saying.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:36):\n\n<Laugh>, you could safely replace the word AI or the letters AI in here with any number of things. Mitigating the risk of extinction from social media should be a global priority. Alcohol, alcohol, Chipotle, you could put anything in there. <Laugh>.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:07:50):\n\nHey,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:07:52):\n\nHe didn't say ta. It\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:53):\n\nWouldn't be wrong. It wouldn't be wrong. You,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:07:55):\n\nYou, you start, you start diamond on, on ka pepe\n\nLeo Laporte (00:07:58):\n\n<Laugh> during Trump mitigating the risk of extinction from kahoi. Peppe should be a global priority. <Laugh>, that's, I mean, you can't say, well, you're right. I mean, global priority's a little higher. Right? But\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:08:12):\n\nEspecially for cati Pepe.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:14):\n\nSo I guess the real question, it was\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:08:15):\n\nMicrowaved, huh? Stacy, that's a global threat.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:18):\n\nThe real question I have for all you, you three is, is there a risk of extinction from ai? Anne? No. No. Is there, Jeff, is there, is there any way you could say there's, I've\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:08:30):\n\nBeen looking Leo, for any scenario that takes me through how we go extinct and honest to God, the only thing I have found thus far is Max Tegmark, I think it was Max Tegmark, m i t theorizing that the AI could at some point decide to cut off oxygen so that it wouldn't rust the machines.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:50):\n\nNo, but the But you\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:08:50):\n\nDon't, I can't find any, any\n\nLeo Laporte (00:08:52):\n\nSerial, if humans don't any sense, first of all, you cut off the oxygen to the earth <laugh>. So\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:08:58):\n\nWell, that's why Yes. That's why this is so stupid. I mean, you\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:01):\n\nCould, you could wait, you could not open the pod bay doors and then Dave's gonna be stuck in space. But, but unless you give AI's agency, maybe that's what they're saying is just don't let them give them the nuclear codes. The only\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:09:13):\n\nThing I can think of is like with the food, food supply chain\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:16):\n\nAnd, but we're not giving them control of the food supply. Yeah, they're right.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:09:19):\n\nThey don't\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:20):\n\nYeah. Nor Stacey didn't, Stacey didn't. Yes or no? Are they a threat to her?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:09:25):\n\nI think the biggest threat would be sowing discord via de deep fakes and like leading to some sort of war slash global\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:33):\n\nCata.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:09:33):\n\nOh, I agree. And I think that's actually a viable thing. Okay. That\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:09:35):\n\nThat's be, that's already there. We don't need ai. We're\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:09:38):\n\nThat\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:09:39):\n\nNo, but\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:39):\n\nAlex\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:09:40):\n\nStamos not all the way\n\nLeo Laporte (00:09:41):\n\nThere. Alex Stamos, who's the leader of the internet observatory at Stanford there, look, this is what they watch for, is if disinformation says that there will likely be an AI driven avalanche of disinformation and misinformation leading up to the 2024 presidential,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:09:56):\n\nAgain, we've got plenty of that already. I think it's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:09:59):\n\nGonna get worse. And I think we're gonna see, I don't think it'll, it's like a, a bay a pig situation. I think what's gonna happen is we're gonna have much more what's it called? Cranky people with weapons during our elections process disrupting things. And yes,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:19):\n\nI'm more worried about that. Not ai, that's not,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:10:22):\n\nBut Well, no, you're gonna rile those people up with non-truths using Right.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:10:27):\n\nExisting and then it's already there. Alright. I's try this.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:10:30):\n\nI know they're there, but,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:10:31):\n\nSorry, go ahead.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:10:32):\n\nI was like, I know they're already there. But look at what's happening with, like, that one lady who went into the target and saw the swimsuit that was laying around in the kids. It's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:40):\n\nGiving them power\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:10:41):\n\nThat led to an escalation. Right. That was almost ridiculous. If you think about, I don't how that got there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:10:47):\n\nSo I've been saying that about Twitter since 2016 mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and I was right, by the way. Yeah. But I've been saying that. I said we've have, we have, you can go back and look. We've weaponized social media. Social media, which was this great thing. We, the bad guys were able to weaponize Russian. And\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:11:03):\n\nThese are bigger bullets\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:04):\n\nFarms. Yeah. In\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:11:06):\n\nMore compelling bullets. So I think, and then\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:09):\n\nAt the time, you have\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:11:09):\n\nEnough of them,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:10):\n\nPeople said, well, you're not gonna ban social media because of that. Are you, would you say ban AI cause of that?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:11:18):\n\nNo, I would not say ban ai because of what do we do? Do you think we need to understand? Well, I don't, that's a good question. Like, I, I'm like, we need to understand how these things propagate. How we can stop them from propagate. I mean, maybe stopping them isn't the right how to, to diffuse this\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:11:36):\n\nIssue. Well, here's a scenario, Stacy just guards. What is, this is for weeks. I'm gonna go the opposite way. That there's so much junk out there that no one believes anything and everyone becomes cynical and critical again. And we're actually better off that,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:49):\n\nBy the way. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:11:49):\n\nSo you and I will do that. But then there's plenty of people who are,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:11:53):\n\nThey've got itchy trigger fingers\n\nLeo Laporte (00:11:54):\n\nAnd they're just, aren't those believe problems? Not AI or social media? I mean, this is what I was told saying AI is, this is what I was told when I said social media is the problem is then you have to educate the electorate. You have to teach people critical thinking. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, I was told the solution isn't doing something that social media, that's just the, the solution is to fix people. I agree. Now, it didn't work so well. And I, and so I understand.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:12:16):\n\nWell, I'm listening to Jeff Charlotte's book under tow right now. And Jeff's a really good academic and journalist. And the scariest thing in the book, by far, to me is this silliness you're about to hear is that people argued that the, the, the really rabid Trump followers argue that everything in his tweets is purposeful. Every capital letter, every capital's has meaning. Yeah. And they add up the numbers from the capitol letters. That's QAN for secret messages, right's, qan, those are Taylor Swift fans.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:44):\n\nWell, it's human, isn't it? It's a very human thing. When I was a dj the, the craziest people, you know, you'd always, anytime you're in the public eye, a certain percentage of the population, oh,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:12:54):\n\nGive them a phone. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:12:55):\n\nSo those cr there were lots of people who thought, oh, you're playing that song for me because our brain is very able of making these connections. And the person would say, oh yeah, no, you're sending me a message. I know you are. That's a very common form of mental illness, by the way, that anybody who's been in radio or TV knows. And we've, and 50 years ago, a guy came into the KG radio station in San Francisco. I know you remember this Jeff and shot the place up because he said, you're putting, you're broadcasting into my, I had, I\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:13:25):\n\nHad somebody next. Wasn't that a George Clooney movie\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:28):\n\nTime? Maybe. So you had a lady, cosmic lady call you cosmic\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:13:32):\n\nLady. She would call and she discovered that my answering machine, cause I was one, I had one of the few ones in, in the examiner that you, she could leave an hour long message. Mm.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:41):\n\nSo she did.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:13:42):\n\nOh, she did. Or she did. I I found the solution here. Felix Simon on, on Twitter. The one thing I'm gonna, I'm gonna get behind is this. Please consider signing my open letter for a murder moratorium on AI open letters. <Laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:13:54):\n\nAbsolutely <laugh> call. Here's what the information writes. Martin Pierce. Well, God, you could\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:14:03):\n\nAfford to read it. <Laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:14:04):\n\nYeah. I could pay for this. Well, yeah. That's one way to get attention. <Laugh>. Yeah, exactly. <Laugh>, the question is, why are very people responsible for AI development suggesting it should be a priority to stop the new technology from killing off every human? Aren't they the best people to ensure that doesn't happen? Yes and no. He goes on to write ai scientists want government's help. That goes back to that regulation. Capture that. Okay. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:14:36):\n\nAlso part of this whole long-termism crap. And accelerationism, let's get there as fast as we can to prove how big we are. Yeah. you know, it's, there's a lot of crazy stuff going on. And again, the academics who are actually studying this, the authors of the stochastic parrots paper, how often do you see them quoted anywhere? Yeah. They're the ones who actually worry about the present case dangers. They warn of them. They say they are present case dangers. But that, that all gets, that's shoved under the rug. Cause we're gonna talk about things that are just supposedly just, just gonna destroy mankind.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:10):\n\nPierce goes on to write. Cynic will say, we shouldn't read too much. This is me by the way. We shouldn't read too much into this statement. Scientists are essentially virtue signaling, preempting political calls for regulation by taking the lead in that campaign. Nailed it themselves. An alternative cynical view, you can choose this one if you wish, is that existing AI firms are simply pushing for regulation to make like life difficult for future entrants. That's regulatory capture. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Either way, those involved with today's statements are taking a big risk because remember, there's this thing called Congress and, but, but\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:15:45):\n\nCongress can't do anything. A b, they're gonna be part of this. Sam Walman learned from Mark Zuckerberg and has the charm tool, charm tour, and C, they're not going for revenue. They're going for investment. Well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:15:55):\n\nPierce says the only logical response that Congress might come up with is to ban ai. Wow. Or regulate it so tightly that even firms already in the business suffer that Surely\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:16:07):\n\nAlton said, license fine. License us and give me a license.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:09):\n\nYeah. Give me the license. That's surely not what these scientists are looking for. But what do they want per <laugh>? This is a good line from Martin Pierce. Perhaps instead of issuing a single sentence statement meant to freak everyone out, AI scientists should use their considerable skills to figure out a solution to the problem they have, Rob. But I don't think we even know what the problem is. No, exactly. Is either, oh, but okay, let's be hon. Let's be fair. It's not ace. Is there any, but there are some\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:16:39):\n\nSeveral concerns.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:16:40):\n\nIt's not necessarily but concerns. Is there any reason to say that the, well, maybe we should be looking more closely at this. The threat of ai. I mean, we, we talked about disinformation. That's real.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:16:51):\n\nWe know it causes disinformation. We know that people, because we're all lazy, tend to rely on things that make our lives easier without checking it. So we know there's a danger with hallucinations or whatnot. So there over-reliance on ai, over trust in ai, which is ironic given the disinformation. We know that it can be used to scale propaganda. We know that it can be used to, we know that people trust what they see and trust visual mediums pretty highly. So that's a weakness we have that can be taken by that.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:28):\n\nYeah. We have to teach people not to trust photos.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:17:31):\n\nI don't think that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:17:32):\n\nPossible. Not to trust. I just saw a deep fake thing where you could take a single picture, a still picture of anyone's head, put it on top of somebody else's moving body, and it makes a video. That's indi It's, it's very impressive. We, and even if this is just a parlor trick, this will be something that will happen.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:17:49):\n\nRight? Dare, dare I return\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:17:51):\n\nResolve.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:17:51):\n\nNow, dare I say, this is exactly what happened with print. Nobody trusted what came off the printing press. And then we had to invent institutions to imbue trust and faith like publishers and editors and libraries and so on. We don't have those institutions now. We're gonna have to reinvent them because those old institutions ain't gonna work. But yeah, I think people will become grossly mistrustful of much of what they see. And that's fun. Look at the surveys you see about social media. People say, oh, I mistrust most of what I see on social media. Good.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:18:22):\n\nBut they still are easily influenced by it. That's what's hard.\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:18:26):\n\nI've seen the other side.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:18:27):\n\nThe\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:18:27):\n\nOther thing is too, on social media that people are, they trust just as much. What's that? What's put out there? Because they saw it on Facebook or saw it on Twitter from a so-called trusted source. I've seen both sides.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:18:40):\n\nAnd you're gonna see people lose their jobs because of this. And then that's gonna create a layer of societal unrest that we already have based on like income inequality. So that is another area where that's a second layer effect, but it's still a very real one.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:18:56):\n\nIf we did this actually,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:18:57):\n\nTruck drivers, there's still cab drivers. That still hasn't happened yet when we've gone through this before. Yes. We went through looms and threshers. I,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:19:06):\n\nI, I don't think it's gonna be quite to that level. I think what, I've already talked to companies that are hiring like one or two fewer software developers because there's greater efficiencies in thanks to ai.\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:19:22):\n\nThat's a good business decision, right? Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:19:25):\n\nI'm not, the point is, there's gonna be trickles. These are small effects individually, but in aggregate, you've gotta think, okay, if you can cut down by the, the workforce in certain industries by 20 or 30% because it makes sense, that's a big change.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:19:44):\n\nWell, we may create, as only happens in these cases, Stacy, we end up creating new jobs too. At the same time.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:19:49):\n\nWe, we very well could. We very well could. And I hope we do. But there's also a lack of people that are be trained for those new jobs. And what about people that are 55?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:01):\n\nIsn't it the case though, that we could go through this very similar exercise with any kind of massive world changing technology? If you said the smartphone instead of ai yeah. In people would lose jobs. Look at journalists,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:20:14):\n\nYou know, photographers are, have, have lost to all their value. Operators are gone.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:19):\n\nI think new techno\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:20:20):\n\nBooks are gone. Really? The big advertising is down\n\nLeo Laporte (00:20:23):\n\nThe big world-Changing technologies have these kinds of massive mm-hmm. <Affirmative> impacts. They do, should we, but we don't want to. We don't want stasis. We don't want the world to stop evolving. But\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:20:35):\n\nWe do need to think about, I mean, think about how right now the economy feels precarious for so many people. And one of those is a fun that is a function of technology and runaway capitalism. But if you think about like the gig economy, and we've talked about this, that creates a lot less economic certainty for people. We see people already struggling for things like buying a house. You could argue that that's a result of technology in the sense that Airbnb has bought up, you know, real estate in cities and caused, I mean like\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:21:09):\n\nRight.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:21:10):\n\nThese are very real effects that are actually like, we could be like,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:13):\n\nOh, I'm not saying they're not, but I'm just saying they'd always, but,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:21:16):\n\nBut how much do, what do, do are you, or how about how wise are we to be able to understand those effects fully in\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:21):\n\nControl them? Jeff, have you ever seen, well, we can't, have you ever seen Jeff the pessimists archive?\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:21:26):\n\nOh, I love, like I talked, I met him in my office two weeks ago. He's great.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:21:29):\n\nSo this, somebody brought this up on Twit on Sunday, and I thought, oh, Jeff Jarvis would love this. So at the bottom is a timeline of, of technological innovations, like the telegraph, the telephone, the camera, and then a collection of clippings from that era talking about the hazards of, you know these new technologies. And it's very, it's a very similar conversation. Yeah. The bicycle, you know, <laugh>. Well, that's the big one. And\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:21:58):\n\nThat's, that's the great one cuz Tristan Harris and his anti-social media film said, who? Nobody freaked out about the bicycle. Well, indeed there was huge\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:05):\n\nOn bicycle fright. What the medical record says of this common phenomenon, it may attack any rider. The remedy is suggested is to avoid looking at the dreaded object. The rider should never watch the wheel or the pedals. <Laugh> <laugh> it, so moral panic is nothing new. I guess you've known that all along Jeff Elevators\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:22:29):\n\nChapter four. The next book is,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:22:31):\n\nYeah. Elevators. all of the things that elevator sickness, cases of elevator sickness are on the rise said Dr. E c Nolton of Chicago. When physicians first began to claim there was such a thing as elevator sickness, their statements were usually discredited. But it is now becoming well-defined. Its effects are found in an increased number of cases of brain fever and disordered nervous systems. Hmm. Everyone has felt a sense of emptiness in their heads. A sensation as if they were falling when riding rapidly in an elevator. Especially if it's going down <laugh>. This is from the Cincinnati, we're elevators\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:23:13):\n\nInvented.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:14):\n\nThis, these articles are from the turn of the century. This is 1894.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:23:19):\n\nOkay. So before, like airplanes are riding real fast in cars downhill.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:23:23):\n\nYeah. There's an amazing book. The four reasons to, to to turn off tv that this was, this is very similar just to get rid of tv. Do I have it here? Somewhere around the here. I do. And one of the reasons was that the, the artificial light was gonna be terrible and his whole\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:36):\n\nBook. Oh yeah. My mom used to terrible say that. Yeah. Turn on a light in the room because the you're gonna go blind.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:23:42):\n\nYeah, I used to hear that. Which was, which was a PR from the light electrical\n\nLeo Laporte (00:23:46):\n\nIndustry. Yeah. Children's addiction to TV presents serious problems. This is from the Valley Times 1957. First of four articles gives the remarks of psychoanalyst Dr. Isidor and zine made to a valley audience recently reported in the valet times. But I mean, I can go on and on. This is, this is\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:24:07):\n\nGerry Mander, who was the author of four Arguments for the elimination of Television. Yeah. Television literally enters inside human beings. Listen to the languages so much like, like social media, right Inside our homes, our minds, our bodies making possible the reordering of human processes from inside.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:24:22):\n\nHow about jazz? Here's Oh yeah. From the twenties. <Laugh> jazz blame for the delinquency of girls today, <laugh>. So, okay. So we can stipulate that there is often a certain amount of moral panic that goes along. Here's the other thing, technology, but isn't, isn't there some, a kernel of truth in this or no\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:24:45):\n\nConcern? Stacy's Right. There's concerns and we've gotta deal with those. But the but the present tense concerns, that's what, that's what Emily Bender argues by talking about this, this destroying mankind dinosaur moment stuff. They're distracting from current issues around privacy, around disinformation, around veracity and truth. That's kinda\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:07):\n\nAlso point out that\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:25:09):\n\nWould normally say is, is a should be a primary concern.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:12):\n\nWell, this statement and previous statements from AI scientists has garnered a lot of news print and so forth. We are facing down the barrel of a climate apocalypse. Yes. Yes. That we're doing nothing about that's gonna happen in 50 or 60 years. Yep. And I mean, I guess we just are in denial about it. I mean, that's a mass extinction event. I don't understand why we're so worried about this. Purely hypothetical. It's like Eliza's gonna kill you when we are literally looking at something horrible. Yeah. That no one wants to baptism\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:25:47):\n\nWith nuclear weapons. Take that.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:25:49):\n\nIt's because we can't solve any of these. But this is one you can rig your, it's it's a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:25:54):\n\nNew, you can wrap your head around it's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:25:56):\n\nEx Well, you well, I was gonna say, you can ring your hands over <laugh> better. Climate change is not something we can do anything about. It\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:04):\n\nIs, it's not quite too late. But then it's gonna be, if we don't as an can, take\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:26:09):\n\nSteps for the future\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:26:10):\n\nAs an individual. There is very little. You as an individual can too. Right. You can call your content critter. Let's, in politics. Right. Well, I know, but the, and this is where, I mean, so sure there is an element of, oh, look at the AI while we're gonna be burning up. But <laugh>,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:26:28):\n\nThere's a great\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:26:29):\n\nAlso a lot of linear television right now because it's not football season, but we have all of\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:26:34):\n\nThese, sorry, ed,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:26:36):\n\nWe don't have all of, we have all of this, this mainstream news talking about how horrible quote unquote AI is are why isn't there anything out there on in Linearal television in mainstream that says, Hey, let's have some common sense about this. It's, it's always on podcasts like ours where I hear the common sense mentioned about ai. Why isn't there a push wait, what For the regular common sense on podcasts, <laugh>, why isn't there a push on, you know, on N B, NBC A, B, C, whatever. Because it\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:27:06):\n\nDoesn't, because, because everything we accuse social media of doing it a clickbait needing attention, making money from, from engaging people and exciting them. That was invented by media. That's what they do. Yeah. I'm ashamed of my entire life and career cuz that's what I've been part of. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:27:21):\n\nAlso, there's not a lot of great imagery. I mean, I know we could create some awesome imagery, but like <laugh> the, the narrative in television, because you've got such a short timeframe, it has to be a really, well, it's gotta be a big easy to understand narrative and it's gotta have good visuals with it. And that's why linear TV is probably failing us on the AI front.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:27:44):\n\nThe reasonable this doesn't doesn't cut it on on, on tv. But, but again,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:27:49):\n\nBecause we named off a lot of advantages of ai as well as all of the misinformation stuff out there, we do mention a lot of different Yeah. We do advantages of, and\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:00):\n\nI also, I'm also one of the people saying, calm down on that, by the way. Yeah.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:28:04):\n\nYeah. I think you, and you said that last week on the show with, with with Chris Ena and I, and I think you, I was thinking about more, Leo I think you're right that it's overdone. The one of my favorite story of the week, and I sent you guys stuff over the weekend was the lawyer who used chat G P T, which\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:28:18):\n\nI Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That was amazing. But it's,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:28:21):\n\nI'm waiting for every, every journalist and everybody else to do the same thing. It's, it does, it can't do fact. It's really bad. It's, they're o they're so overplaying its capability. Yeah. It sounds like us. And that's pretty, pretty darn and amazing. And there's neat stuff we could do with it. Yep. But it's really limited what it could do. I think, I think your point last week was exactly right, Leo,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:41):\n\nHere's that,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:28:42):\n\nThat's where everything's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:28:43):\n\nAround to back it up by a guy named Rodney Brooks, who's a legendary roboticist. And once one time head of the ai department and m i t, his actual title. He was the director of the computer science and artificial Intelligence laboratory at m I T until 2007. He knows what he's talking about in his head. This is in the I e e Spectrum Journal. Just calm down about chat G p t four already and stop confusing performance with competence. He's saying exactly. This, he actually wrote a great article and now it's amazing six years ago, the seven Deadly Sins of predicting the future of ai. Mm. And we are giving into every one of those sins.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:29:29):\n\nBut you know what, that's what humans do. We always, performance always wins with us. Yeah. And for competence, think about it. We're, that's just what\n\nLeo Laporte (00:29:40):\n\nWe do. Well, I've said this before I've been saying this for years that people often think I've been, in fact I've been saying this for more than 25 years. People often think of a computer as a thinking machine. There's even a computer company called Thinking Machines. And, and it's really important to understand they don't, that's an anthropomorphism. Computers don't think, they basically are very simple calculating machines. They just do it so fast. The the looks like we think we project onto them. They're actually thinking, but they're not. They're just performing calculations incredibly rapidly. Right. Even including ai, it's not thinking, it isn't anything close to ranking\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:30:21):\n\nThose calculations when performed super. I mean, you could argue that our brain is not thinking it's just performing analysis of inputs really fast. Okay. I mean, I guess we're, we're neurological the way our brain has developed in I'm not, I'm just thinking about No, I agree. Sure.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:30:39):\n\nThis is an unsolved computer science question, which is what is the difference between a rapid calculator and the human brain is the human brain just so sophisticatedly calculating that. We don't see exactly how, but we could eventually.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:30:53):\n\nWell, and we think, I mean, think about like how dogs, like they're finding dogs that can detect like various diseases, really early covid. Yeah. So the same thing. I mean, we don't give dogs the same vaunted, you know, well actually we might, I don't know, as unfortunate\n\nLeo Laporte (00:31:11):\n\nConversation always like, often goes down to, well, there's a well human has a soul and the machine doesn't. And I think that that people reject that, that like, well you can't, that's not, that's, that's magical thinking. But I do think there may be something that we do in our brains that is very, very hard from a von Noman really machine to do. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:31:31):\n\nWell, okay. For Aon Noman machine. But I also would say, I would argue that we're no more special than any of these other things. The only reason we think we're so special is we're judging us. Right. If you think about I I like, if you think about animals octopuses, the way they think they're whole separate, I mean, way their brain has developed to process their environments. I mean, what are we doing? We're actually really crappy at processing our environment. Cuz otherwise we would've done something about the damage that we're causing. In some ways, I'm like, well,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:06):\n\nWe've designed, we've been designed in such a way to respond to certain environmental stimulus like a, a tiger in the brush mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and, and not to other environmental stimulus. And so we don't long-term thinking and stuff. There, there are, there's a, this is the realm of philosophy as much as it is science. Yeah. But I mean, there's some say, well, which we need more discussion of in this, in this arena. Yeah. What, what humans, what distinguishes humans from animals is that we know we're going to die. An animal doesn't know it's gonna die. We know we are,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:32:38):\n\nWe don't know that. We don't know that dogs go off, depend on how they themselves and so do wolves.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:32:42):\n\nWell, they know when they're sick and they don't feel well. But humans go through life with the knowledge that they will eventually die. Animals don't have that.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:32:50):\n\nHow did We don't know that. They watch their go out to die. Take a look. Elephants, those elephant funerals they have, I mean, yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:00):\n\nOnce their sick and die, they know they're dead. But do they know that elephant? They're\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:33:03):\n\nGonna die mourn the loss of their kin.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:05):\n\nYeah. Yeah. They, because they're dead. But do they know that they're going to die? You don't\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:33:09):\n\nThink that if they're, if they can mourn, they don't recognize that that is could have, I could be next.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:14):\n\nOh, maybe. Yeah. All right. So we can't, we, we can't know that, I guess <laugh> and there are others. No, I'm just saying what people have said. Let's put it that way.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:33:22):\n\nNo, I know. Yeah. I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:33:25):\n\nThere's others who have the opinion that it was, I mean, by the way, that's what some have given as the explanation of the Cambri explosion was there was sudden realization that we could, in fact, I I think Leonard Schlein said that in one of his books. There are those who say are not our, our sense of time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> you know, we don't, I mean, many scientists and maybe some philosophers who think, who understand that there is no such thing as time. Time is what we think <laugh> happens, but there, but it isn't. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, that is our impressions. There was a really good interview that your, your buddy Lex Friedman did with\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:34:07):\n\n<Laugh>,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:34:09):\n\nWith Steven Wolfrem, in which Wolfrem pointed out that really what, what we think of his time is just our averaging of all the of all the events that happened all at the same time. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we, we, we overlay this sequentiality on it. It's very interesting. It's a physicist's point of view, not necessarily a philosopher's point of view. Although the point is, I I do think there's something different from what a computer does. Now, I, I interviewed the the guy who invented graffiti Jeff Hawkins, who's also a neuroscientist, and his, his premise, he wrote a number of really interesting books on brain neuroscience. Is that the thing that distinguishes humans? Our our rate of calculation is much slower than a computer, but we are massively parallel. And he said the mistake we're making is trying to take a v Noman machine, which is much more sequential.\n\n(00:35:05):\n\nAnd, and what we really need to do is build massively parallel machines. So he started a company, Numenta, you've heard of this, Stacy. I know. Cause I think we've talked about it mm-hmm. <Affirmative> that was designed to create memory chips that worked more in parallel, like our brain does. Not, not achieving success yet, but in any event, the, the the point being, I think, and maybe you're right, maybe it's just a kind of a subjective and and self-centered point of view. There is something different about the way humans think than, and machines think. And I don't think making a machine think faster or with more data is gonna ever achieve whatever it is that we've got going on consciousness. It that seems to be, I\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:35:48):\n\nWould argue\n\nLeo Laporte (00:35:48):\n\nYou could, but\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:35:49):\n\nYou could maybe argue maybe what we're doing. So computers deal with exact information unless we're talking about probabilistic computing. But let's pretend we're not, because that is a whole different realm of both chip design and programming. But in general, although AI is probabilities, we're, we're teaching them to use exact calculations to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:11):\n\nWell, and quantum computing probabilities is in fact also not. Okay. Quantum\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:36:15):\n\nComputing isn't real yet. We're not gonna go there yet. There. I'm just talking about what's available to us. Right.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:36:19):\n\nOk. It's there, it's just not a scare. There's a scale.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:36:22):\n\nOkay. Yes. <Laugh>. I'm like, no, don't bring that in yet. Okay. So what we're good at is seeing things in making an intuitive leap and not being able to account for our work. What we're getting with, with AI and what makes us uncomfortable is we're actually allowing Theis to make those, what we think of as intuitive leaps they're making based on calculations on much of the data and making a probabilistic assumption. So in some ways they're, they may be computing like us. I don't, I don't, I'm, I'm kind of thinking out loud on this. So, but we trust human intuition a lot sometimes. But then we also want, like, we value the data driven aspects of a computer. So we might be having, our issue is, we've always thought of computers as like neutral sources of data. But now that they're making these probabilistic assumptions that mimic intuition, we're like, whoa, this is scary. This is, this could be a problem. And I don't know if that's really true.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:26):\n\nI would submit this. We could\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:37:27):\n\nJust trust them as intuitive things.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:29):\n\nWhat we're seeing and so far, and I think it's gonna prove to be the case, is that by itself, whether it's a self-driving vehicle or Chatt writing a novel, they're not very good in conjunction with human thinking. They're a very good partner. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Right.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:37:46):\n\nI love, I love\n\nLeo Laporte (00:37:47):\n\nThe premise of that. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Yeah. And I think it's a better way to think of these as, as a, a way of augmenting human abilities. But leaving the human out of it almost always is disaster. I mean, you left, let a Tesla drive yourself. Well, we can't\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:38:00):\n\nBe out of it because our data is what feeds it. Writing.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:03):\n\nYeah. But that's not sufficiently in it. I\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:38:06):\n\nThink. Well, well, but, but I, I, I agree with you. But, but I also think that Leo one, one of the interesting things is that, not that I, I think what's interesting about AI is not that it produces good content, it produces bad content. And in that sense, it reflects our biases and our presumptions and our mistakes and foibles over time. And that's what's interesting about it. We're not doing that. What we're thinking, it's always, it's now a computer brain. It's gonna produce perfect content. It ain't, cuz it's based on\n\nLeo Laporte (00:38:30):\n\nUs. Oh, it's us. It produces a amalgam of what it gets from us. But it's not, it, it's not thinking about it. It's not processing it, it's just statistically generating it. And I don't think that's particularly useful.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:38:44):\n\nI watched a a video of the, the chief scientist at open AI who used to be, I forget his name, suddenly it's on the rundown. But it was to Microsoft. It was an hour long about how all this works. My favorite part of it, the only funny part of it was he said that you can ask it to do things like give it a first break up your queries into, into pieces. Don't give it the monster query. And then he said, you can tell it. I want you to be smart. I want you to have 120 iq. He said, don't tell it that you want him to have a 400 iq. Cuz then it'll get into all kinds of sci-fi crap. <Laugh>. Geez.\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:39:21):\n\nGreg Crow Hartman was on Floss Weekly couple weeks ago, and I'm pretty sure you were quite a fan of his being Mr. Lenn colonel and Awe. But I remember him mentioning AI and he wasn't really sold on it. And he said something along the lines of AI is just pattern matching sort\n\nLeo Laporte (00:39:38):\n\nOf Yeah, it is. Yeah. No, that's essentially what it is. Yes. You know and it has some value. So <laugh>, it's Paul Throt said, you know, Stephen King has a terrible time ending his novels, but probably with a little help from ai, he could come up with an end Yeah, yeah. For his novels. Yeah. I think Steven would still have to write it. Yeah. But maybe the AI could come up with some solutions that Steven had a partner thought\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:39:59):\n\nOf. Have a partnership there.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:01):\n\nI mean, I think that's useful, but I, I think AI always needs to be done in a context of a human Absolutely. As an assistant. Well, and\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:40:08):\n\nI, I, I mean, how many people are actually not including, granted Yes. People, companies are doing like really crappy jobs with chatbots, but they were doing that before AI got good. Right, <laugh>. True, true. So like, if something really matters and if it's core to your product or core to your competency, I, I don't think we'll see AI without humans. And I think, I mean, like,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:36):\n\nIn which case like I'm\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:40:37):\n\nUsing, so\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:38):\n\nYeah, that answers two of our qualms, which is, okay, so for every ai ai there's gonna be a human. So don't worry about job loss, maybe job change, but, but humans will, well, no,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:40:47):\n\nThere will still be job loss if you're going to take, you know, massage jobs if I doing 40% less work. Yeah. Well, I mean,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:40:54):\n\nBut there still needs to be a human taking the output of the AI and massaging it or using it.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:41:00):\n\nNo, I think there'll be a human making sure the output of the AI fits with the standard.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:04):\n\nWell, we'll see, my guess is, and this has been, it depends on the job too, in full self-driving, in other areas where AI has let us down, that you may be surprised by how much human input is needed going forward. So that's one. It also solves the problem that mass extinction, unless the human is a evil genius intent on the destruction of mankind. Well,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:41:28):\n\nThat's a different story. Story\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:41:29):\n\nTotally could happen. But\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:30):\n\nThat is the AI or the human, that's the problem.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:41:33):\n\nWell, it just, it makes us more scalable. Like if you think about it makes our That's a good point. Workloads.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:38):\n\nSo you'd be a scalable evil genius. I think I see your point here. Yeah. <laugh>,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:41:43):\n\nI mean, I can scale up and write more thanks to ai. Right. I can have it generate ideas for\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:49):\n\nMe. Does that put people outta work though? I mean,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:41:52):\n\nWell, not in my case, no. Because I'm ethical and I'm not venture-backed. But if you're,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:41:58):\n\nAnd this is one of things lot a seen that are out of work or ended up getting fired because red Ventures decided to use ai. But I'm gonna say, know how well did that work? Yeah. I'm gonna say that that didn't work out so well for Red. Not as\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:42:08):\n\nWell as Schwartz, Esquire, the lawyer.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:11):\n\nRight?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:42:12):\n\nYeah. But I think, I think under our current economic regime, if you can cut out costs and people are more expensive, well, actually AI is not as economical as we think it is right now. It's very, yeah. That's very expensive. And we don't really talk about that a lot. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:29):\n\nThat's,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:42:29):\n\nDidn't Ravino bring\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:30):\n\nThat up about the Yeah, well we talked about it on Sunday. Yeah. With Daniel Ravino. I brought it up too. I keep bringing it up. The, you know, this is not a cheap technology. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it. Well, interesting part of it is not so expensive. The part that's expensive is creating the model models. But actually, once you have a model, you can, you can run queries against the model more cheaply. That's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:42:52):\n\nStill expensive. Well, it's still, I mean, creating,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:42:54):\n\nSam Altman says it's 10 times more expensive than a Google search at at chat. Yeah. So it's still still pricey.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:43:00):\n\nSo, but, but Bruce Schneider had a really good place enslaved talking about where the action's gonna be is in the small open source models\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:07):\n\nFor that reason. Right? Yeah. Right. by the way, Schneider's, one of the people who responsible to control Schneider is one of the signatories to that statement, which I don't, I love Bruce. I have huge respect for him\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:43:20):\n\nAs to\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:20):\n\nWhat Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:43:22):\n\nWell ask him why I did it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:24):\n\nYeah. I mean, we gotta get him on. I'm\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:43:25):\n\nBetting\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:43:27):\n\nRemember that. Get on Emily Bender, get on Timney Guru. Get on Margaret Mitchell. Get on one of those. Jason, Jason,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:34):\n\nYou, you write this all down for Techn News Weekly. Jason and Micah. Bruce Sni versus Emily Bender by itself would be Wow. Great. I think\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:43:43):\n\nMust see tv.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:43:44):\n\nMust see tv. Yeah. I think this is one area where I think we can do a good job, better job than mainstream media because we're maybe we're a little more in informed and a little more skeptical. Yeah. And we have three hours and we have three freaking hours to fill <laugh>.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:44:00):\n\nWe don't have to have three hours. It's three. I just want y'all to know <laugh>. It could just be two. I didn't\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:05):\n\nKnow it was three. Good. I'm gone for two this week. You'll be glad to know Stacy, which is why I am gonna take a little break, a little teeny tiny time out so you can go get a waffle.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:44:16):\n\nI'm gonna have a chip question for Stacy if I\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:18):\n\nCan. And a chip question, chip question for Stacy. I think Anne has one too actually. What's Stacy? Believe it or not, what, what's Stacey doing? Stacy,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:44:27):\n\nMy child brought me a lemon bar that they made brought their clouds.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:44:32):\n\nWow.

Do you wanna do a chip story? Are you through with a lemon bar? Yeah. Let's\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:46:34):\n\nStacy a question I wanna, I wanna explain if if she's, if she's not too puckered up to talk,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:39):\n\nI think she's in a, in a lemon bar combo. Sweet lemon bar or she's in a lemon bar coma right now. Yeah, she is. Yeah. She's not, she can't hear a word she's saying. We can't even hear her. She's,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:46:47):\n\nOh, did we finish the ad? Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:49):\n\n<Laugh>. Sorry, did you finish the lemon bar?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:46:52):\n\nNo, I started writing something.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:46:54):\n\nOh. Are you a little a d d d a d d. Just outta curiosity.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:46:59):\n\nI'm a I am a lot a d d\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:01):\n\nWho is, who here is not a d d? It's always me. Just you. It's always me. You're not, not not ad everywhere I go. Everybody else is a d d everywhere I go Boy, bad study. It says it's the fluoride in the water od\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:47:18):\n\nI'm on a, well I don't have fluoride now.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:20):\n\nLemme just have more. So maybe I can be like that. That's it, Leo. The AI is gonna figure out a way to put too much fluoride in the water and we're alls the extinction event. Oh, okay. There\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:47:30):\n\nIt is. Nailed it.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:31):\n\nNailed it.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:47:31):\n\nAlright, here's my dumb question for Stacy. Oh yeah. Was it accidental that AI said, oh, these graphic chips are good at this stuff that, that avidia happened to make, or Avid is now the, the first trillion dollar company of AI because their chips are reuse in all of this stuff. Right? Those chips already existed before for graphics and games and things\n\nLeo Laporte (00:47:57):\n\nAnd, and then it was Bitcoin, right? So remember <laugh>? Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:00):\n\nOkay. So remember how Lao was talking about the humans are really great at parallel processing Uhhuh <affirmative>. To do graphics, you have to be great at parallel processing. So graphics chips are different from like Intel's chips, Uhhuh, <affirmative> because they're, they do a bunch of jobs in parallel.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:16):\n\nThey do chunk of data. They do\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:17):\n\nTheir ca Yeah, they do a lot of So Nvidia in this is why, back when I was at Fortune, I wanted to put Jensen on the cover of Fortune back in 20. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:26):\n\nYou were right.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:26):\n\nThey're like, oh, too early. Oh,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:29):\n\nYou were so right.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:31):\n\n<Laugh>. Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:31):\n\nThe way she's talking, Jensen Wong, the founder of Nvidia, who is gone from being the $200 man to being the 30 billion. Man, it's really a great story.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:48:40):\n\nYou should, you should write to all those editors who stopped you and say, yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:43):\n\nI mean he Jensen,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:44):\n\nThey already knew\n\nLeo Laporte (00:48:45):\n\nReal. Yeah, they know They blew it <laugh>. They\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:48:47):\n\nKnow, but he can't tell you.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:48:50):\n\nSo, so that's why graphics strips and graphics strips remember like the seminal moment in computer vision was back in 2012 when it was actually Jeff Hinton. They did resonant, was it ImageNet? Sorry. ImageNet. And they basically were able to prove out Jeff Hinton's theories about how quickly and how well a computer could make, could name things like recognize an image. So they were able to do that thanks to graphics chips. And they're massively parallel processing. So it is not a secret or it's not like\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:49:28):\n\nA No, no, no. I'm just, I I guess what I'm trying to ask is this, it's, it's, they looked around and said, oh, graphic chips already do that. If you were gonna design chips from scratch mm-hmm. <Affirmative> to do what AI does now, would it look a lot like a graphics chip or was it just incredibly good timing to have really good graphics chips that then had other uses?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:49:49):\n\nAnd I'm gonna throw in a little extra on this one. What is the difference between A G P U and A N P U or when Intel's calling a vpu,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:49:59):\n\nA neural, a neural processing or a visual processing?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:02):\n\nYeah. These are the new AI chips in, in addition to gps.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:50:05):\n\nRight, right. Good.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:50:06):\n\nI don't know what the difference between a GPU and a,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:09):\n\nI'm glad you asked. I'm\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:50:10):\n\nGuessing, I'm sorry.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:50:10):\n\n<Laugh>. <laugh>. No.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:50:13):\n\nAnd it depends on, so we built the algorithms for the silicon we have. Right. And then we're like, it's kind of a market and ED, where they're running in lockstep. Right? So now we have things and we're like developing chips. So we're like, oh, okay. So you have to move when a computer is doing a calculation, you have memory, right? You leave stuff in memory. Right. Next to, there's two levels of memory. There's on chip memory and then there's the memory. Like that used to be tape or\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:50:41):\n\nMm-Hmm. <Affirmative>,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:50:43):\n\nOther memory disks.\n\n(00:50:45):\n\nDiscs. Or even it's not on the same chip, it's not right next door. Right. Right. So you gotta go if you've gotta, so that memory is limited. So you can only store so much information and the chip, if it's massively parallel, it can pull all of that in and then it needs more. But that's like IO that to get from, you gotta go to the next building over to get your more of the data that you need to process mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and bring it over to the room that's next to the big processor. Right. Right. Let's just think of a chip as a series of rooms. So you could design a chip with a bigger memory room. That's right. That's accessible to your processor. There's also things like the way we do our algorithms, like there's things like matrix multiplication, that type of math is really important. So you can build chips that are optimized for better matrix multiplication. But we're also like, we're also developing new algorithms and new ways to do this all the time. So you actually might find something that's really effective, like from a either cost or from a power or performance perspective. And you might actually be like, I wanna do this so much and I'm Google, I'm gonna build a whole new chip design for this. Was this tensor?\n\n(00:51:59):\n\nIt could be tensor, but it could be like if some genius at in or at Google decides they wanna build a whole different type of algorithm, they might. And if, if they decided it was the best algorithm for search, it would be economically viable for them to design a completely new chip just for that. And this was\n\nLeo Laporte (00:52:18):\n\nThis what has done with the NPUs, because they're basically f PPGs, they're programmable processors. Yeah. So you can optimize them for new, new workloads or new styles of calculation.\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:52:30):\n\nSo Stacey, when you pushed Nvidia cover story, what was your pitch then?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:52:36):\n\nMy pitch was they're enabling AI evolution. They're one of the only contenders because at the time Intel didn't have a great graphics option A M D did, but Intel or sorry, but Nvidia was doing just so well at it that, and there was very little competition that wasn't a startup, that they were gonna win for a long time to come. Did\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:53:00):\n\nYou see these other uses for graphics processors on the horizon at that time?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:53:05):\n\nYou saw it starting, I mean, once again, once that image net competition happened in 2012. Yes. And I went to a couple, they called it nips. They used to, that's sexist. So they don't call it that now. I went to a couple of their shows and listened to like the researchers talk about the types of chips they wanted. So then I was trying to work with like all the, because all these startups were coming with new architectures.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:31):\n\nSo basically I'm gonna see if I can summarize in a, this simple way. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:53:36):\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry. Was that,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:53:39):\n\nLemme, I think I can do this in a, in a sentence. So the way computers, since time and Memorial have been designed as something called the Von Noman architecture, which is basically a single instruction. Von Noman machine has a processor, it has memory, it might have storage, and it's a single pipeline. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, it's like an assembly line for calculation. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Very quickly we realized, especially once graphics became popular, Intel did something called the m mx extensions. We realized, or cmdi extensions that we should be able to operate instead of on a single thing at a time, on a mass of a, a ti a texture, for instance, in a, in a graphics environment in one instruction, operate on all of that data. So they created these more parallel forms of, of processing. And that's when the first graphics processors came along.\n\n(00:54:31):\n\nYou might probably remember the 3D FX voodoo card. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. And these graphics processors were just basically glorified multiprocessor machines. All we've done is, and that's what Nvidia actually Butch bought, I think, bought 3D FX and, and incorporated their technology along with a lot of others. Created these massively parallel processors. They're not vno machines, but they are, they're just many, many, many vno machines all working at once. And what it turns out, if you're doing a specific kind of thing, not graphics, but machine language training large language models and gans and things like that, you can specialize even further in these graphics chips into something that's designed for particularly artificial intelligence applications. Those are NPUs or TPUs or what, in until calls vpu, they are basically GPUs that have been specialized for the kinds of calculations you do in machine learning. Am I, is that accurate? Thank you. Stacy, is that a fair way of summarizing that?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:55:30):\n\nThat's much better. No, that no, Stacy, yours was, was was really informative. Alright. No, and I used to have this, go ahead. Oh, go ahead. No, you, well, I was gonna say there, and there's all these cool new things coming down the pipeline cuz one of the issues is when you have all of these parallel processing, you have to figure out how to tell everything, how to work together and do the job. Right. And so you see like the rise of these fabrics inside, right? Right. And communicating what's going on and moving all that data around is becoming a bottleneck. So your next generation, like, we're not there yet, but I'm really excited about like, photonics on Chip. I know you're excited about quantum Leo.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:09):\n\nYeah. Photonics too is a little closer actually. Yeah. Yeah. Both Microsoft and apple have fabrics to support this kind of movement. Apple's. What Apple's done is actually put, put the NPU on chip. They call it the machine, what do they call it? They have a name for it. A machine learning module or something like that. And so that's one way of doing it that's perhaps even faster. Cause it's integrated Apple's making these giant chips that have everything including RAM on one.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:56:37):\n\nWell, now what you're talking about is the rise of chips,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:39):\n\nRight? And SOCs. Yeah, yeah,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:56:42):\n\nYeah. It's basically, I mean, we would call it a system on a chip, which is a bunch of chips, you know, on a\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:47):\n\nBig on one dye chunk of, or\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:56:49):\n\nDye. Thank you. I was like, I had a big chunk of wafer, what do you call that?\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:56:52):\n\n<Laugh>? Where does tensor fit into this?\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:55):\n\nIt's Google's brand\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:56:56):\n\nCustom designed. Yeah,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:56:57):\n\nYeah. For their neural process, their version of\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:57:00):\n\nThis. Yeah. All right. One more question. I, I'm, I'm sorry, but this is, you know, Jeff Lauren's moment now put this into the discussion of neural networks. Is it just a whole bunch of massive processing going on in massive processing? <Laugh>?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:57:17):\n\nSo a, a neural network. I mean, when we talk about ai, a lot of what we're talking about are neural networks, which Uhhuh is,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:57:24):\n\nThat's why I'm asking. Yeah,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:57:25):\n\nIt's, I mean, a neural network is just,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:28):\n\nSo this is where the computer scientists are saying, well, we know the brain is very, very parallel. Well, this is so why, so maybe that's how that the best way to simulate learning in a machine is to do this highly parallel processing. So it's,\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:57:45):\n\nIt's, it's parallel.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:46):\n\nWe're trying to duplicate neurons, right? That's the word. Neural the chip\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:57:49):\n\nWith, with the chip was parallel, was capable of parallel. And now you wanna do a whole bunch of parallels.\n\nLeo Laporte (00:57:54):\n\nWell, and then Stacy brought up matrixes, and that's really a better way of describing it. So parallel sounds like lanes that are going in the same direction, right? These are all inter interconnected in a variety of ways. They're more like a grid. Okay. Right? Yeah. And so it's much more flexible in, in the kinds of parallel processing. Look it we're, Stacey is obviously a neural network, is more of an expert on this than I am. And I'm just trying to understand it and understand it in layman's terms. It's part of the computer revolution that's going on. It really is. Yeah. Go ahead, Stacy. Well,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:58:26):\n\nAnd, and we have all these branches that we, we've tried. And what's really fun, I think what's really fun is right now we're seeing like there's one way to train and run a model that's on these massive Nvidia type cards. Right? And, you know, y'all know I'm excited about tiny email, but there's a lot of research going into other places, like how do we shrink those models and mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, it's turning out that the way you build the models on the big machines are probably not the best way to build models that are gonna run on the small machines, which means we're going, so I just sat through like three hours. Oh, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:02):\n\nInteresting, huh?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:59:04):\n\nYeah. So like, things like back propagation and pruning are really good ways to, like,\n\nLeo Laporte (00:59:09):\n\nThis is what Google was talking about, about apps at Google io was how we get these massive models into your phone. Right? And it's, I didn't realize it's different. You change the way you do the model\n\nJeff Jarvis (00:59:20):\n\nItself, which is also part of the Bruce Schneider article, is all the open source being able to use it on, on smaller machines of any sort and, and have a real impact,\n\nAnt Pruitt (00:59:29):\n\nRight? What is considered small machine versus big machine. That's what I'm asking.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (00:59:33):\n\nYeah. And, and the other thing you have to be real clear about when we're talking about this is there's the training, which is the building of the model, and then there's the inference for the running of the model. So what I'm, so when you're talking about training, it's all in these big computers, but the, the cutting edge thinking that it, I I'm listening to research on is actually let's figure out how to train on these small computers. But when we train, we're gonna actually run completely different types of algorithms and, and help, help establish weights and focus for those algorithms for tiny machines. What Google's talking about with their large language models like Gecko and Unicorn and Gemini, and I don't remember how they got from big to small. They're, they have two, I think they talked about having two different models. And one is just shrinking it down for d to run inference on smaller and smaller machines in small machines. Most people, when they say small machines, they're talking about like a gateway, which is still running like a computer chip. And I used to\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:00:45):\n\nHave a gateway computer,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:00:46):\n\nSorry, not that\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:00:48):\n\n<Laugh> with the, so\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:00:49):\n\nLike any machine with an application processor that runs Linux. When I talk about things like tiny ml, I'm talking about like running on a freaking sensor. So like TensorFlow,\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:01:01):\n\nOkay.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:01:03):\n\nYeah. Yeah. So I, and I'm trying to think of how small TensorFlow light can go. I don't think it's,\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:01:09):\n\nWell, it's in your phone, isn't\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:01:10):\n\nIt? Yeah. So, and your phone is actually, like, when people talk about like running machine learning at the edge, that's usually where they're talking about. And it's freaking impressive. What I am talking to people about is running machine learning on like a micro process of like a microcontroller, because\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:01:25):\n\nSee, I wouldn't've assumed a smartphone is a small computer. I mean, other than the physical forms. I know, right? But I, I would, I would've said it is the smartphone is, is a bigger computer because of how all of the process and power it has. Right?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:41):\n\nThe issue is, so what Bruce is talking about in this article and in general is because these models have been so big and requires so much horsepower mm-hmm. <Affirmative>, they, it's dominated by Google, Microsoft, Facebook, big companies with big capitalization that, and big data and\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:01:58):\n\nBig data machines.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:01:59):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative> mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. And what Bruce is saying is there is a movement and actually ironically it's Facebook's la l l a m a Lama, I guess you pronounce that, or Yama, that is, is opening the way to this. This was actually leaked out and now as being widely used by the open source community, because now the idea is to take the power away from, or not at least to keep them from owning it entirely. Google and Facebook and Apple and, and Microsoft and Amazon mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and let small developers work in this space. Because if you don't do that, then you just don't get innovation. You just get what Sam Altman clearly wants, which is to, you know, the big guy's owning it. Yeah.\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:02:40):\n\nAnd good luck trying to control that. If you want to try to stop ai, cuz he's gonna destroy everything. Well, he's gonna be a whole bunch of little factories law.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:47):\n\nWhy surprises me that Bruce signed that statement, to be honest with you, because I, I,\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:02:52):\n\nI\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:52):\n\nAgree. He's an advocate for, it's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:02:53):\n\nSuch a Nabi pamby statement though. It's like, yeah, this could be a problem.\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:02:57):\n\nThat's not quite Debbie ba\n\nLeo Laporte (01:02:59):\n\nHey, said, Bruce writes, this isn't the first time companies have ignored the power of the open source community. Sun never understood Linux. Netscape never understood the Apache web server. Opensource isn't very good at original innovations. But once an innovation is seen and picked up the community can be a pretty overwhelming thing. The large companies may respond by trying, and this is what they're doing to retrench and pulling their models back from the open source community. But it's too late. We have entered an era of large language model democratization by showing the smaller models could be highly effective, enabling easy experimentation, diversifying control, and providing incentives that are not profit motivated. Open source initiatives are moving us into a more dynamic and inclusive AI landscape. Maybe he should get Bruce on floss. Well, we can try. Yeah. That would be a really, well, Bruce has been on show Listen, <laugh>. Yeah. Bruce has been on our shows before, I'm sure. But doc knows Bruce. This article is from Slate by Bruce Schneider. Oh yeah. And Jim Waldo I bet you, I bet you Bruce would like to come on and talk about this, cuz that's really important. You don't want, I mean, honestly, that's the threat <laugh>. It's not to mass extinction of the human race, but it might be to extinction of small companies\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:04:10):\n\nAnd individuals or, or vice versa. This is where there's no moat. We talked about that two weeks ago, that there's no moat right around the big guys because the little guys can do it. And it also goes back to the stochastic parrots folks, once again, as much as many rivers do, where if you have a smaller models with smaller data sets, that's more manageable in terms of being able to audit what they're doing, where you get your stuff, what's happening there. And so a small version of AI may be a really more interesting way to look at all of this.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:04:38):\n\nNow, I wonder if you fast forward into the future, if you've got, like, cuz with open source, there's a liability issue, especially if you give these jobs that are more complicated. So there's, there's a quality assurance kind of aspect to this that you could then build. I, I'm just picturing my, like in the future world and I'm like, oh man, I need a chat bot to answer my phone while I'm, you know, reporting or editing or something. Right. And to evaluate if it's a good story. So who am I gonna hire? Like what company has the best chatbot for that? To mimic my voice to see if a story's interesting and worth taking a note on or interrupting\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:14):\n\nThe call. So, you know, you have Tesla doing full self-driving, but then a, a guy named George Hotz creating a, but no,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:05:20):\n\nThey're not,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:21):\n\nPardon me?\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:05:23):\n\nThey're not doing full self-driving.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:24):\n\nWell, they're attempting, but then there's a guy,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:05:26):\n\nOh, I thought you were saying that it was real. Sorry. I was like, no, it's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:29):\n\nNot <laugh>. Well, but this is the point, is the big company attempting to do this, and then there's this guy, George Hotz, who's created a little company that has an open what? Open source self-driving. You just put their phone in your window self-driving car system. Oh\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:05:44):\n\nGod, that scares me.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:45):\n\nWell, I think it's at least as good <laugh>.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:05:48):\n\nThat's, it's scary. But in it's innovation though. Oh\n\nLeo Laporte (01:05:52):\n\nYeah. And it's as least as good as, as full self-driving. George started ai, he has left since, but George Hot's iPhone hacker, an Elon Musk antagonist. <Laugh>\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:06:05):\n\nWow.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:05):\n\nThat we like. Yeah. That's what the Verge calls him. But yeah, he created this incre. Yeah, there he is. That's George or Geo Hot or Geo Hots. He did this. He, he, he unlocked the iPhone at the age of 17. He was a hacker. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> got in trouble with Sony for unlocking the PlayStation three a couple of years later. And Musk tried to hire him then he said, no, I'm not gonna work for you and I'm gonna make a better autopilot than Tesla <laugh>. Which I, as far as I could tell actually is true. I respect that. Yeah. So his new company will be called, I think the Tiny Corporation. He says under a thousand lines under three people, three times faster than Pie Torch, which is the Python library for machine learning for smaller models. There's so much left on the table. So that's why\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:06:56):\n\nHe's not just doing self-driving. He's doing the\n\nLeo Laporte (01:06:58):\n\nModels. He's doing the models. That's why you want this to be op you know mm-hmm. <Affirmative> shrunk down maybe. But in\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:07:03):\n\nEurope, the European regulation that's coming out is, there's some discussion that it's gonna ban open source\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:10):\n\nVersions. Yeah. That's a mistake of ai. And, and it's\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:07:13):\n\nGonna put liability on every model that's created. Every action that anybody then does with it is gonna go back to the source model maker. Did they give\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:07:21):\n\nA reason why they would want to ban the open source side\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:24):\n\nOf\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:07:24):\n\nIt? Because they don't, because they wanna be able to control,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:26):\n\nThey don't want an AI extinction event. But so to circle all the way around now think about what that statement really was, is this stuff's\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:07:35):\n\nScary. Boys do it. You\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:37):\n\nCan't let little guys do it cuz it's outta control. Yeah.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:07:40):\n\nLet us, let us take care, care\n\nLeo Laporte (01:07:41):\n\nOf it. Exactly. So now we know. I mean, I, I don't now I'm no longer thinking That's the cynical view. I think that's, oh no, it's the right view. I think that's the, that's the right view. Sad to say. All right. Ch can we change the subject a little bit? You guys can vote if you want to go. Hey boss.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:07:58):\n\nI wanted to ask Ms. Stacey. Oh, you\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:00):\n\nHad good article. Let, let's pull that up. Yeah.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:08:04):\n\nThe headline is The Spectrum X Ethernet switch offers lossless transmission via congest via new kind of congestion control, says Nvidia. And when I saw that, the first question came, well, two questions. Does this even matter? And number two, why does it matter if it, if it really does matter,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:26):\n\nBy the way, I love it that Nvidia names their chips after great female computer scientists of the ages. This is the Grace Hopper Grace. They call it copper. Yep.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:08:37):\n\nSo this is the ZD net article. Yes. The Spectrum X. Yes.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:40):\n\nJetson Wong showed off the first iteration of the Spectrum X the spectrum four with 100 billion. Wow. 100 billion transistors in a 90 millimeter square die. And this is, this is style like\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:08:54):\n\nRidiculous thing.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:08:55):\n\nOh, okay.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:08:55):\n\nThis is fabric, I think, I think this\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:08:56):\n\nIs, this is the fabric issue. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, this is a routing. This is basically, you gotta move that data real fast if you're talking about parallel processing that much stuff. And the video is\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:08):\n\nVery smart. Awesome. Which they, they have pivoted. And so they were the gaming company and then they saw the opportunity in, in self-driving vehicles. They do a lot of chips for cars. The\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:09:20):\n\nPart runs at 500 watts. Y'all, that's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:23):\n\nA lot high. It is so much power. It's for an a networking operation.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:09:27):\n\nThis isn't Yeah. This is inside a super computer. Basically this is a switch using ethernet, which is more capac. This is where photonics would actually help. Cuz if you had a photonic thing, you wouldn't have to move the It wouldn't, it wouldn't be So don't think it would run as hot. Yeah. And it would be faster and you wouldn't have to have such smarts in there. But that's cool.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:45):\n\nYeah. I think this is, you know, so thing's first in-person keynote in a long time, a couple of days ago mm-hmm. <Affirmative>. In fact, I wish we'd covered it. We just kind of jammed up with keynotes. Yeah. But they're really firing on all cylinders. It's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:09:57):\n\nAmazing. I was almost at Computex.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:09:59):\n\nReally? Oh\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:10:01):\n\nYeah. I decided not to go last minute though.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:03):\n\nWait. I get, you know, I get, I get an invitation every year from one company or another. I think so did\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:10:12):\n\nI get 'em\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:13):\n\nMic Micah got one too. And you\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:10:15):\n\nGot one Computex.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:16):\n\nI'm always about going cuz I don't, it's like, well, I don't know. I don't wanna take this free trip. It's like a junket. So I don't know.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:10:24):\n\nConky Tax was a sponsor on my show. I should mention that last month. Mm-Hmm. They were a sponsor.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:29):\n\nWell, that's a little different then. They're a sponsor. That's different, I think now.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:10:32):\n\nYeah. But I still would've had to pay for my own trip. I don't,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:10:35):\n\nWell, there are a lot of companies that want to give us free trips. I always turn it down\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:10:39):\n\nMiss Stacy.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:10:39):\n\nYeah. I never take a free trip. Yeah.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:10:41):\n\nHe, he just said that, you know, Nvidia was quote a gaming company, but now they're sort of pivoting into the AI side of things. And it made me think about a m d AMD has had its issues with its rise in performance here and there. But is there a way for them to get into the AI side of things at some point? And\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:11:02):\n\nThey do have, I mean, they do have chips that are used in ai. So a Jensen or Nvidia is not the only company. Like people do use AM MD chips for training and whatnot. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> it's, they're just, they don't have as great of a marketing department. They don't have a CEO as charismatic and a, and a black leather jacket. <Laugh>. But I wouldn't know She's the coolest\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:11:22):\n\nCEO though. I\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:11:24):\n\nThought She's Lisa Sue. Oh yeah. She's, she's not. But she's not. I've met both of them. You know, when you meet Jensen Right. And he has got, he comes on real strong. Right. And Lisa, Sue, you know that this is a really smart, sharp person Yeah. Who is gonna like, you don't wanna mess with, you don't wanna disappoint Lisa Sue, but they're not the same mm-hmm. <Affirmative> from a marketing or storytelling perspective. But real fast with this switch, I should note what Nvidia is doing is they're actually creating underlying hardware that is the full cloud product. Right. Okay. So when he's talking about two data centers and like creating an AI data center, NVIDIA's creating that AI data center. So if I'm Amazon, I'd be looking out at this and going,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:12):\n\nNo kidding. What about\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:12:14):\n\nLike aws? That's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:15):\n\nInteresting. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:12:17):\n\nSo I just thought I'd share that with y'all cuz y'all would think that's\n\nLeo Laporte (01:12:19):\n\nNice. Yeah. They unveiled a super computer platform basically. In fact, yeah. At the end of the keynote, Jensen Huang says, it's too much. I know. It's too much. <Laugh> <laugh>. That's crazy. Sales forecast for the current quarter, 4 billion above analyst estimates that put Nvidia into the trillion dollar company club, which is a very small club good for, you know, good for them. I've been saying for some time that Nvidia is very impressive because they are firing in all cylinders. It's gaming crypto for a long time. I mean, but, but they were lucky because as crypto fell off the map, AI came on mm-hmm. <Affirmative> and replaced that market for 'em. Yeah. I, they, and\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:13:02):\n\nThey also, way back in 2008 when I, I went out and visited them and they had, I, I called it a sexy processor. It was a mobile processor. They basically have been trying to push heroin. The Integra was in style processors. It was\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:13:16):\n\nDevices.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:13:17):\n\nYeah. I have Integra in my Invidia shield. Yeah. That thing is six, seven years old and it's, it's as fast as a modern, I forgot about Tera.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:13:25):\n\nYeah. But they've been pushing this style of computing since like 2006. They're like, yeah, what do we got? We got the world's best hammer. We're gonna put this hammer. We everything needs a hammer. Yeah. Right. But they were Right. And graphics you don't bet against graphics and on the phone. And then they want, they were like, we're gonna put it into like laptops. Because that was the available computing infrastructure they had. They were like, corporate presentations are gonna need better graphics processors. Look at slideshows, look at this, look at YouTube. And then heck just, they were\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:13:58):\n\nIn general at, at one point in time, just cause crypto died off, you still needed something that's gonna process red eight k footage, you know?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:14:06):\n\nYeah. They're smart because they have had these inroads into all these different markets. Then it doesn't matter if crypto goes away, you know, they're not leaving the gaming market either. The other thing Huang announced is a special AI for non-player characters. Oh boy. <Laugh>, they call Ace. Oh boy. They're gonna give it to a gaming companies fact. The first one is a Santa Clara California company called that will use it to create non-player characters in their games that hear what you say, uhoh Uhuh and respond by it. Oh, do, that's cute. Cute. I moral panic that's coming up Next. <Laugh> Envidia Ace will listen to what the gamer says to a com character converted into text. Then dump that into a generative AI program to create a more natural off the cuff response. So they, they're not giving up on gaming any either. That's awesome. Soon. And of course they have the best graphics cars right now on the market. Right. The 40 nineties. Yeah. Yeah. They're with Ray Tracing. And\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:03):\n\nThis is why Intel invented tried to like, do graphics with Larbi and failed. And then they, they made that did they,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:12):\n\nThey have a low end video card now. Intel does. It's not bad. Yeah.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:15):\n\nFinally. It's low cost. No, it's, it's better than\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:18):\n\nIt was at the Ace. I can't remember what they call it. No Intel. I can't remember. G P u I can't remember the new one.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:23):\n\nThat's if you were in the chip world. A you saw the need for this arc. Yeah. Way back in the day. And they, they were trying, they tried so hard.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:34):\n\nOh, remember they tried mobile and they were such a failure. They end up selling off the division. I don't And now\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:40):\n\nThey're going to factories.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:41):\n\nYeah. You know, well,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:43):\n\nThey started out and they kept their fabs the whole time. And they were really innovative until they got Brian, what's his name? Sich.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:52):\n\nCni. Yeah. His, now they get packed gel. He was\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:15:55):\n\nTerrible for Intel. Although, but Gelsinger,\n\nLeo Laporte (01:15:59):\n\nThere's like we were talking about this on windows Weekly. There's a little trouble at the top. Apparently <laugh> in Intel. Serious leadership in issues once. Here's the story from the Wall Street Journal again. You know, every time I read about tech in the Wall Street Journal, I always have to think, well, who's is being Gord here? Once mighty Intel struggles to escape Mudhole <laugh> like a, like a what, like a hippopotamus or a dinosaur is stuck in the LaBrea tar. Its rivals such as Nvidia have left the chip company far behind. C e opac, Gelsinger, Aimes to reverse firm's fortunes by, as you said, Stacey, vastly expanding its factories. Gelsinger said we had serious issues in term of leadership, people, methodology, et cetera. Yeah. That's\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:16:51):\n\nPretty. So he's, that's him throwing, no, that's him throwing\n\nLeo Laporte (01:16:54):\n\nUp Throw shade at\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:16:54):\n\nBrian under the buds. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz he was, he was terrible. Yeah. Like, he was, he had no sense of innovation. He was just, and then he was like, we need to get to like, I don't remember if it was three nanometers or what they were going for. And then they were like, well, we're having trouble. He's like, no, we're not. And then just carried on. So that is a problem when you're dealing with like actual physics.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:16):\n\nAnd then here's the problem speaking of physics with crashing this is the stock performance of Nvidia. Oh yeah. A m D into Intel <laugh>.\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:17:29):\n\nSo what happens to Intel? Does it, does it die? Is there a, a scenario where\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:17:32):\n\nIt No, no, no. There're\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:34):\n\nWell, eventually it could. I mean, Gelsinger says we're trying to turn into a service business. That's what the Foundry business is. We have no history of this. No, no. In expertise at this. So it's a\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:17:44):\n\nLook at ibm. That's all I have to say. That's what they did\n\nLeo Laporte (01:17:47):\n\nRight. At ibm. Yep. Yep. There's services business. Well,\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:17:50):\n\nNo, IBM's, IBM has N I'm so sorry, y'all. I love IBM's research division, but IBM has nothing going for it right now. No. But it's still limping along. And it will for quite some time.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:18:01):\n\nDevork always said that the only thing keeping IBM alive is it has a lot of patents. But I suspect those patents are expiring. They can't be that much use these days. So maybe that, that might be what ends up putting them under anyway. Yeah. Intel's getting eaten by T S M C and a lot of other companies. Nvidia interesting article. I like the, I like the tar pit analogy. <Laugh> <laugh> gel Singer's growth plan is rooted in the expectation that the chip demand will come roaring back. That's part of the problem too, isn't it? The demand is, is falling off the face of the earth. People aren't buying PCs, PC sales are down 20 don't to 30, 40% way down. Don't have to.\n\nStacey Higginbotham (01:18:48):\n\nIntel's issue is they threw everything at PCs and servers and now server, and they're still doing great in servers. But all of our new server monolithic jobs are ai. Like that is the big driver of compute demand, AI and crypto. And they don't have like their automotive stuff. They have stuff that runs in there, but the rest of the world is consuming chips that aren't Intel and will be consuming chips that aren't gonna be Intel chips forever. So they gotta make a Jesus the,\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:19:20):\n\nI just, I just was gonna make a P D P joke. A deck joke. The PDP 11 came out 53 years\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:27):\n\nAgo. Yeah, I have. Wow. A P D P I think it's a, I can't remember if it's an eight, nine or a 10, but it's really a raspberry pie <laugh>. It's actually a little faster. A little faster than the original running on my on my office. Wow. Coming up in just a bit. Is cyber security an unsolvable problem?\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:19:52):\n\nThat was quite an awesome invidious segment.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:19:55):\n\nYeah. Thank you. Quite Stacy.\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:19:56):\n\nEducation was a coordination. That was a very great chippy. It was very chippy show. I like Chip is Stacy.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:00):\n\nThank you, chippy. Now we're gonna talk the philosophy and cybersecurity. Scott Shapiro's new book, which by the way is Great. Fancy Bear Goes Fishing. I'll tell you a little story from that book. I've been reading it. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, but he also proposes that you'll never have a secure computer. And we'll talk about that when we come back in just a bit. First a plea an encouragement. Help me with this aunt, cuz you're the commu community manager. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> of our, of our great twit club. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>.\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:20:31):\n\nMm-Hmm. <affirmative> Club Twit. That is sir.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:20:34):\n\nThis was something Lisa came up with a couple of years ago, her thinking being, we would like to be supported by our audience. You know, we're an ad supported network. I like that. I like that We can give shows away for free. That even if you have not a penny to, to two pennies to rub together, you can listen to our shows and we want that to continue. Yep. But at the same time, advertising dollars are going way down. It's not just us, it's every, it's across the board. Across the board. And we think the Club is really our future. So I wanna invite you to join Club Twit. I think it's a very good deal. Lisa really wanted to make sure that you got value for a dollar. So primarily the first benefit, and we thought this would be the big one, is no more ads. Right? You get all the shows. We do completely add free no trackers in there, no ads. It's yours. And you get to listen to it. That's, I think a great benefit. Turned out that wasn't the only benefit. In fact, my mind may be not even the best benefit. We had this great discord, the\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:21:35):\n\nMagical Discord server.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:37):\n\nTwits always had this amazing\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:21:38):\n\nConversation. Always\n\nLeo Laporte (01:21:40):\n\nHad an amazing community. And this is really a place for the community to, to get together. You know, we have our forums, we have our masks on instance, but this is where club members get together. Not only to talk about the shows. You know, we have a club twit chat right now going on This Week in Google. But also about all of the subjects people are interested in. Geeks, particularly, there's a whole AI section, anime, OTOs, coding and comics, food and fitness movies and music. There's\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:22:07):\n\nEven sports in there. There's sports talk in our discord. Did you know that sir?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:11):\n\nSports and Sports Ball?\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:22:13):\n\nYes. Geeks talk and sports talk Sports.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:16):\n\nI bet there's a lot of pickleball going on there. There's been\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:22:18):\n\nNo, there's been nba there's been f1. I mean, they go added in this right\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:22:22):\n\nNow. Queso. Far more important.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:24):\n\nQueso. There's a queso chat. I don't think it has a dedicated queso channel. But anyway, we could get one <laugh> because s in charge. So that's the second benefit that free shows the Discord. Not everybody who joins Club Twit goes in the Discord. No, I didn't. I really encourage you to, I think sometimes it's a little intimidating to people. Yeah. You go, I don't get it. But you will be welcome. And it really is a great way to communicate. Can, can\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:22:48):\n\nI ask a question here, aunt? Sure. Will the whole drama around Leo's hair be the kind of thing that just club members will get to watch?\n\nAnt Pruitt (01:22:54):\n\nI guarantee it <laugh>.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:56):\n\nSo, okay. That's the other thing\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:22:57):\n\nWe have. We don't wanna miss that\n\nLeo Laporte (01:22:59):\n\nSpecial content only for club members. It's the, the TWIT plus feed that we offer to all club members. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. So yeah, it's stuff like the things that happened before the show and after the show. The bloopers. The, and would\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:23:11):\n\nWe, would we stop the show because there's noise next door? Yeah.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:14):\n\nBut it's part of the fun of it. If you're watching live, you get all of that. But not everybody can watch live. So we excerpt some of that stuff, but we also are able, because we have revenue from the club to you. I mean, a lot of what that club revenue goes toward is developing new shows. We don't wanna, we wanna bring you new content. So that's why there's Michael Sergeant's hands on Macintosh in there, Paul t's hands on Windows, the Untitled Linux show, the giz fizz Stacy's book club every other month because we can\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:23:39):\n\nSpace started there.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:23:40):\n\nWell, and we can launch shows out of there. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative> quite literally this week in Space started sound speed subsidized by the club. But as it built an audience, we were able to put it out in public right now in the club. Home Theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>, we'd love That was a show we we produced for a long time. Couldn't develop an audience for, or an advertising base for, but it had, I mean, had a good audience. It just wasn't as big as it needed to be. So we're, we're doing it in the club. And that's, that's the other benefit is that, that money. And I promise you that's where that money goes. It goes to keeping the lights on, keeping the staff employed, developing new programming. It's really important to us. We're now almost 8,000 strong. We're growing. It's\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:24:17):\n\nAwesome. It's awesome.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:18):\n\nWe're growing. But I have a vision. I have a dream <laugh>. Sorry,\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:24:22):\n\nWait a minute. <Laugh>. <laugh>. I've\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:25):\n\nBeen to the mountaintop. I have a vision, let's say that, of getting, I would like, we, right now, it's a little more than 1% of everybody who listens to our shows joins the club. Mm-Hmm. <affirmative>. I, I don't ever expect it to be half even. I'd like to see it be 5%. That would be, which is\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:24:41):\n\nPublic radio territory. Yeah. Six to 12%. Public radio. I don't\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:45):\n\nWanna have to beg as much public radio\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:24:47):\n\nAs, as generous as those tote bag toting.\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:52):\n\nWe don't give you tote\n\nJeff Jarvis (01:24:53):\n\nBags. Frout eating anymore lattes sipping public radio people, people. Aren't we?\n\nLeo Laporte (01:24:58):\n\nI think well see one of the things, we are very much more a specific narrowcas"
