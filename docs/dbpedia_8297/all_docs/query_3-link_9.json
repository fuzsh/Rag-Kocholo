These may be performed bilaterally during the same session for a total of up to six injections.\n\nA second diagnostic facet injection (intraarticular and medial branch block) is considered medically necessary to confirm the validity of the clinical response to the initial facet injection when it is administered at the same level as the initial facet injection, and where the initial facet injection produced a positive response (i.e., resulted in an 80% relief of facet mediated pain for at least the expected minimum duration of the effect of the local anesthetic). If the initial injection did not produce a positive response, a second diagnostic injection is considered not medically necessary.\n\nAdditional sets of facet injections or medial branch blocks at the same levels and side are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven because they have no proven value.\n\nAetna considers diagnostic facet joint injections not medically necessary where radiofrequency facet neurolysis is not being considered.\n\nDiagnostic facet joint injections are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for neck and back pain with untreated radiculopathy.\n\nFacet joint injections are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven as therapy for back and neck pain and for all other indications because their effectiveness for these indications has not been established. Note: Facet joint injections (intra-articular and medial branch blocks) containing corticosteroids are considered therapeutic injections.\n\nAetna considers ultrasound guidance of facet injections experimental, investigational, or unproven because of insufficient evidence of its effectiveness.\n\nTrigger point injections\n\nAetna considers trigger point injections of normal saline, corticosteroids and/or local anesthetics medically necessary for treating members with chronic neck or back pain or myofascial pain syndrome when all of the following selection criteria are met:\n\nConservative treatment such as bed rest, exercises, heating or cooling modalities, massage, and pharmacotherapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), muscle relaxants, non-narcotic analgesics, should have been tried and failed, and\n\nSymptoms have persisted for more than 3 months, and\n\nTrigger points have been identified by palpation; and\n\nTrigger point injections are not administered in isolation, but are provided as part of a comprehensive pain management program, including physical therapy, patient education, psychosocial support, and oral medication where appropriate.\n\nA trigger point is defined as a specific point or area where, if stimulated by touch or pressure, a painful response will be induced. A set of trigger point injections means injections in several trigger points in one sitting.\n\nUp to 4 sets of injections are considered medically necessary to diagnose the origin of a patient's pain and achieve a therapeutic effect; additional sets of trigger point injections are not considered medically necessary if no clinical response is achieved. It is not considered medically necessary to repeat injections for this indication more frequently than every 7 days.\n\nOnce a diagnosis is established and a therapeutic effect is achieved, it is rarely considered medically necessary to repeat trigger point injections more frequently than once every 2 months. Repeated injections extending beyond 12 months may be reviewed for continued medical necessity.\n\nTrigger point injections are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because their effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nAetna considers ultrasound or electromyography (EMG) guidance of trigger point injections experimental, investigational or unproven because of insufficient evidence of its effectiveness.\n\nFor acupuncture and dry needling, see CPB 0135 - Acupuncture and Dry Needling.\n\nSacroiliac joint injections\n\nAetna considers sacroiliac joint injections medically necessary to relieve pain associated with lower lumbosacral disturbances in members who meet all of the following criteria:\n\nMember has sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain for greater than 3 months; and\n\nMember has pain at or close to the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) with possible radiation into buttocks, posterior thigh, or groin and can point to the location of pain (Fortin Finger Test); and\n\nMember has at least 3 of 5 physical examination maneuvers specific for SI joint pain:\n\nCompression\n\nPosterior Pelvic Pain Provocation test - P4 (Thigh Thrust)\n\nPatrick's test (Fabere)\n\nSacroiliac distraction test\n\nGaenslen's test; and\n\nOther causes of low back pain have been ruled out, including lumbar disc degeneration, lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar facet degeneration, and lumbar vertebral body fracture; and\n\nMember has tried 6 weeks of adequate forms of conservative treatment with little or no response, including pharmacotherapy (e.g., NSAIDS), activity modification, and active therapy (including physical therapy where appropriate); and\n\nThe injections are not used in isolation, but are provided as part of a comprehensive pain management program, including physical therapy, education, psychosocial support, and oral medication where appropriate.\n\nUp to 2 therapeutic / diagnostic sacroiliac injections are considered medically necessary to diagnose the member's pain and achieve a therapeutic effect. It is not considered medically necessary to repeat these therapeutic / diagnostic injections more frequently than once every 7 days.\n\nAdditional therapeutic sacroiliac injections are considered medically necessary if the member has improvement in lower back pain numeric rating scale (NRS) of at least 70% of the pre-injection NRS score after fluoroscopic or CT controlled injection of local anesthetic with or without steroid into affected SI joint. If the member experiences less than a 70% reduction of pain for the expected duration of the anesthetic, additional sacroiliac joint injections are not considered medically necessary.\n\nOnce the diagnosis is established, up to four therapeutic sacroiliac injections, repeated no more frequently than once every 7 days, are considered medically necessary every 12 months.\n\nUltrasound guidance of sacroiliac joint injections is considered not medically necessary.\n\nSacroiliac joint injections are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because their effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nInterlaminar epidural injections\n\nAetna considers interlaminar epidural injections of corticosteroid preparations (e.g., Depo-Medrol), with or without added anesthetic agents, medically necessary for the following:\n\nIn the outpatient setting for management of members with radiculopathy or sciatica when all of the following are met:\n\nPain is radicular in nature (radicular signs may include, but are not limited to, a positive straight leg raise or a dermatomal pattern of sensory loss). Note: In low back pain, radicular means pain and/or numbness that radiates below the knee; in neck pain, it is pain, numbness or weakness in the shoulder, arm, wrist, or hand; and\n\nIntraspinal tumor or other space-occupying lesion, or non-spinal origin for pain, has been ruled out as the cause of pain:\n\nWhere indicated for evaluating lumbar, cervical or thoracic pain, advanced diagnostic imaging should be performed within 24 months prior to initiating intralaminar epidural injections; and\n\nMember has failed to improve after 4 or more weeks of conservative treatments (e.g., rest, systemic analgesics, physical therapy); and\n\nInterlaminar epidural injections are provided as part of a comprehensive pain management program, which includes physical therapy, patient education, psychosocial support, and oral medications, where appropriate.\n\nAdditional interlaminar epidural injections, if the initial injection resulted in at least two of the following for at least two weeks:\n\nA 50 % or greater relief in pain; and\n\nIncrease in the level of function/physical activity (e.g., return to work); and\n\nReduction in the use of pain medication and/or additional medical services such as physical therapy/chiropractic care; and\n\nThe interlaminar epidural injections are provided as part of a comprehensive pain management program, which includes physical therapy, patient education, psychosocial support, and oral medications.\n\nAdditional epidural injections are not considered medically necessary if these criteria are not met.\n\nNo more than one interlaminar epidural injection is considered medically necessary per session:\n\nMore than one interlaminar epidural injection in a single region per session is considered not medically necessary.\n\nInterlaminar epidural injection of more than one region per session is considered not medically necessary.\n\nRepeat epidural injections more frequently than every two weeks are not considered medically necessary.\n\nA total of up to 3 interlaminar epidural injections per region, per episode of pain are considered medically necessary in 6 months, and up to four interlaminar epidural steroid injections per region (ie, cervical, thoracic, lumbar) per rolling 12-month period are considered medically necessary, only upon return of pain and/or deterioration in function and only when responsiveness to prior injections has occurred (ie, the individual should have at least a 50% reduction in pain and/or symptoms for two weeks).\n\nAdditional interlaminar epidural injections per region per rolling 12-month period are considered not medically necessary; and experimental, investigational, or unproven because they have no proven value.\n\nAetna considers ultrasound guidance of epidural injections experimental, investigational, or unproven because of insufficient evidence of its effectiveness.\n\nInterlaminar epidural injections of corticosteroid preparations, with or without added anesthetic agents, are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications (e.g., non-specific low back pain [LBP] and failed back syndrome) because their effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nFor transforaminal epidural injections, see CPB 0722 - Transforaminal Epidural Injections.\n\nNon-pulsed radiofrequency facet denervation\n\nAetna considers non-pulsed radiofrequency facet denervation (also known as facet neurotomy, facet rhizotomy, or articular rhizolysis) medically necessary for treatment of members with intractable cervical or back pain with or without sciatica in the outpatient setting when all of the following are met:\n\nMember has experienced severe pain limiting activities of daily living for at least 6 months; and\n\nMember has had no prior spinal fusion surgery at the level to be treated; and\n\nNeuroradiologic studies are negative or fail to confirm disc herniation; and\n\nMember has no significant narrowing of the vertebral canal or spinal instability requiring surgery; and\n\nMember has tried and failed six or more weeks of conservative treatments such as bed rest, back supports, physiotherapy, correction of postural abnormality, as well as pharmacotherapies (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, analgesics, and muscle relaxants); and\n\nThe member has two positive diagnostic facet joint injections (intraarticular or medial branch blocks) at the level to be treated, as evidenced by at least 80% relief of facet mediated pain for at least the expected minimum duration of the effect of the local anesthetic used.\n\nWhen performing radiofrequency joint denervations/ablations, it may be necessary to perform the procedure at the same level(s) bilaterally; however, radiofrequency ablation of no more than three levels are considered medically necessary during the same session/procedure.\n\nProvided that greater than 50% pain relief is obtained for at least twelve weeks, further facet denervation procedures should be at intervals of at least six months per level per side, at a maximum of twice per rolling calendar year. Only 1 treatment procedure per level per side is considered medically necessary in a 6-month period.\n\nNon-pulsed radiofrequency facet denervation is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nSee also CPB 0735 - Pulsed Radiofrequency.\n\nSpinal Fixation\n\nAetna considers pedicle screws medically necessary for posterior spinal fusion (see CPB 0743 - Spinal Surgery: Laminectomy and Fusion).\n\nAetna considers the use of interspinous or interlaminar distraction or stabilization devices with or without lumbar laminectomy and/or fusion experimental, investigational, or unproven.\n\nAetna considers CoFix for interlaminar/interspinous stabilization experimental, investigational, or unproven.\n\nIntervertebral body fusion devices\n\nAetna considers intervertebral body fusion devices (synthetic spine cages/spacers) (see ) medically necessary for the following:\n\nUse with allograft or autogenous bone graft in members who meet criteria for lumbar spinal fusion as outlined in CPB 0743 - Spinal Surgery: Laminectomy and Fusion and for thoracic fusion;\n\nSynthetic spine cages/spacers for cervical fusion for members who meet criteria in CPB 0743 - Spinal Surgery: Laminectomy and Fusion with any the following indications for use of a synthetic cervical cage/spacer:\n\nCervical corpectomy (removal of half or more of vertebral body, not mere removal of osteophytes and minor decompression) in the treatment of one of the following:\n\nFor tumors involving one or more vertebrae, or\n\nGreater than 50% compression fracture of vertebrae, or\n\nRetropulsed bone fragments, or\n\nSymptomatic central canal stenosis caused by vertebral body pathology (such as due to fracture, tumor or congenital or acquired deformity of the vertebral body).\n\nCervical fusion for pseudarthrosis in persons with prior fusion; or\n\nFor adjacent level disease that has developed in persons with a prior cervical fusion involving a plate, in order to avoid dissection for plate removal when a stand-alone cage/spacer is being used.\n\nSpine cages are otherwise not considered medically necessary for cervical fusion because they have not been proven more effective than bone graft for this indication.\n\nSpine cages are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for indications other than fusion because their effectiveness for indications other than those listed above has not been established.\n\nExpandable cages are considered medically necessary for members who meet criteria for fusion in CPB 0743 - Spinal Surgery: Laminectomy and Fusion and who meet either of the following criteria:\n\nAt L2-S1; or\n\nFor members with osseous defects at the fusion site (i.e., voids or gaps in bone due to trauma, surgical resection, or congenital defects).\n\nExpandable cages are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications.\n\nPercutaneous polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty (PPV), kyphoplasty, or Spinejack System\n\nAetna considers percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate vertebroplasty (PPV), kyphoplasty, or SpineJack System medically necessary for members with persistent, debilitating pain in the thoracic or lumbar vertebral bodies resulting from any of the following:\n\nMultiple myeloma;

have not established a clinically significant benefit of use of a laser over a scalpel in spinal surgery. No additional benefit will be provided for the use of a laser in spinal surgery.\n\nMicroscope and endoscope:\n\nUse of a microscope or endoscope is considered an integral part of the spinal surgery and not separately reimbursable.\n\nRelated CMS Coverage Guidance\n\nThis Clinical Policy Bulletin (CPB) supplements but does not replace, modify, or supersede existing Medicare Regulations or applicable National Coverage Determinations (NCDs) or Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs). The supplemental medical necessity criteria in this CPB further define those indications for services that are proven safe and effective where those indications are not fully established in applicable NCDs and LCDs. These supplemental medical necessity criteria are based upon evidence-based guidelines and clinical studies in the peer-reviewed published medical literature. The background section of this CPB includes an explanation of the rationale that supports adoption of the medical necessity criteria and a summary of evidence that was considered during the development of the CPB; the reference section includes a list of the sources of such evidence. While there is a possible risk of reduced or delayed care with any coverage criteria, Aetna believes that the benefits of these criteria – ensuring patients receive services that are appropriate, safe, and effective – substantially outweigh any clinical harms.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations (CFR):\n\n42 CFR 417; 42 CFR 422; 42 CFR 423.\n\nInternet-Only Manual (IOM) Citations:\n\nCMS IOM Publication 100-02, Medicare Benefit Policy Manual; CMS IOM Publication 100-03 Medicare National Coverage Determination Manual.\n\nMedicare Coverage Determinations:\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Medicare Coverage Database [Internet].

An epidural steroid injection is used to help reduce radicular spinal pain that may be caused by pressure on a spinal nerve root as a result of a herniated disc, degenerative disc disease or spinal stenosis. This treatment is most frequently used for low back pain, though it may also be used for cervical (neck) or thoracic (midback) pain. A combination of an anesthetic and a steroid medication is injected into the epidural space near the affected spinal nerve root with the assistance of fluoroscopy which allows the physician to view the placement of the needle.\n\nApproaches to the epidural space for the injection include:\n\nCaudal -\n\nthe epidural needle is placed into the tailbone (coccyx) allowing the treatment of pain which radiates into the lower extremities. This approach is commonly used to treat lumbar radiculopathy after prior surgery in the low back (post-laminectomy pain syndrome).\n\nCervical -\n\nthe epidural needle is placed in the midline in the back of the neck to treat neck pain which is associated with radiation of pain into an upper extremity (cervical radiculopathy).\n\nInterlaminar -\n\nthe needle is placed between the lamina of two vertebrae directly from the middle of the back. Also called translaminar, this method accesses the large epidural space overlying the spinal cord, and is the most commonly used approach for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar epidural injections. Medication is delivered to the nerve roots on both the right and left sides of the inflamed area at the same time.\n\nLumbar -\n\nthe epidural needle is placed in the midline in the low back to treat back pain which is associated with radiation into a lower extremity (lumbar radiculopathy).\n\nThoracic -\n\nthe epidural needle is placed in the midline in the upper or middle back.\n\nTransforaminal -\n\nthe needle is placed to the side of the vertebra in the neural foramen, just above the opening for the nerve root and outside the epidural space; this method treats one side at a time.\n\nThe goal of this treatment is to reduce inflammation and block the spinal nerve roots to relieve radicular pain or sciatica. It can also provide sufficient pain relief to allow the individual to progress with their rehabilitation program.\n\nThe efficacy of epidurally administered steroids has been demonstrated without adverse consequence in a large number of patients with reproducible results. In a large number of studies, long-term relief of pain (greater than 3 months) can be achieved in at least 10 to 30% of patients, while short-term relief (less than 1 month) can be achieved in 60 to 100% of patients. Results for cervical pain are somewhat lower than those for lumbar pain. Such therapy is considered under accepted guidelines to be indicated in patients with low back and cervical pain that has not resolved after only a short period of more conservative measures since studies have shown a better response to therapy in patients whose pain is of shorter duration. Even if pain relief is temporary, it may have long-term benefit because it allows initiation of physical therapy or other rehabilitative measures at an earlier stage. Most authors indicate that a limit on number of injections is appropriate, and that most patients will respond with 3 or fewer injections.\n\nThe American Academy of Neurology's assessment on the use of epidural steroid injections in the treatment of radicular lumbosacral pain (Armond et al, 2007) concluded that:\n\nEpidural steroid injections may result in some improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain when determined between 2 and 6 weeks following the injection, compared to control treatment (Level C, Class I to III evidence). The average magnitude of effect is small, and the generalizability of the observation is limited by the small number of studies, limited to highly selected patient populations, the few techniques and doses studied, and variable comparison treatments.\n\nIn general, epidural steroid injections for radicular lumbosacral pain have shown no impact on average impairment of function, on need for surgery, or on long-term pain relief beyond 3 months. Their routine use for these indications is not recommended (Level B, Class I to III evidence).\n\nData on use of epidural steroid injections to treat cervical radicular pain are inadequate to make any recommendation (Level U).\n\nGuidelines from the American Pain Society (Chou et al, 2009) questioned the clinical value of epidural injection for long-term use or for use of non-radicular back pain. A recommendation for epidural steroid injection for patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis was not offered based on insufficient or poor evidence.\n\nLanger-Gould et al (2013) discussed the American Academy of Neurology (AAN)'s top five recommendations in the “Choosing Wisely” campaign promoting high-value neurologic medicine and physician-patient communication. They noted that 1 of the 11 finalist recommendations was “Don’t perform epidural steroid injections to treat non-radicular low back pain”.\n\nTrigger Point Injections\n\nTrigger point injections (TPI) are injections of saline or a local anesthetic, with or without a steroid medication, into a painful area of a muscle that contains the trigger point. The purpose of a TPI is to relax the area of intense muscle spasm, effectively inactivate the trigger point and provide prompt symptomatic pain relief. TPI is the most common interventional technique used in pain medicine.\n\nTrigger points have also been treated with dry needling. For information on dry needling, see the Background section in CPB 0135 - Acupuncture and Dry Needling.\n\nA myofascial trigger point is a discrete focal tenderness, 2-5 mm in diameter that is located in distinct tight bands or knots of skeletal muscle (AHFMR, 2002). When palpated, these hyper-irritable areas cause pain in distant areas, or referred pain zones, which are specific for each trigger point. Trigger point injection, or direct wet needling, involves injection of fluid directly into the trigger point located in the taut muscle band. The main objective of trigger point injection is fast pain relief and elimination of muscle spasm in order to break the pain cycle. This facilitates physical therapy aimed at reducing muscle contracture and increasing range of motion. Trigger point injection is rarely used in isolation but is generally part of a multi-disciplinary approach aimed at treating both the trigger points and reducing all contributing factors (Scott and Guo, 2005; AHFMR, 2002; Sanders et al, 1999). Thus, treatment may also include patient education, psychosocial support, oral medications, and physical therapy to improve the strength and flexibility of the affected musculoskeletal systems. An assessment conducted by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research (Scott and Guo, 2005) found that the evidence for the effectiveness of trigger point injections when used as the sole treatment for patients with chronic head, neck, and shoulder pain and whiplash syndrome was inconclusive, regardless of whether sterile water, saline, or botulinum toxin is injected. The assessment found that the combined use of dry needling and trigger point injection with procaine offers no obvious clinical benefit in the treatment of chronic craniofacial pain, while the effectiveness of trigger point injection for the treatment of cervicogenic headache is unknown. In contrast, the assessment found that trigger point injection with lidocaine may be useful in the treatment of joint pain caused by osteoarthritis (Scott and Guo, 2005). The assessment found no proof that triggers point injection is more effective than other less invasive treatments, such as physical therapy and ultrasound, in achieving pain relief, and there is some suggestion that the only advantage of injecting anesthetic into trigger points is that it reduces the pain of the needling process (Scott and Guo, 2005). Usually, approximately 3 treatments are necessary to abolish a trigger point completely (AHFMR, 2002). A number of trigger points may be injected in 1 session, but rarely more than 5. Repeated injections in a particular muscle are not recommended if 2 or 3 previous attempts have been unsuccessful (Alvarez and Rockwell, 2002; Sanders et al, 1999). The pain relief may last for the duration of the anesthetic to many months, depending on the chronicity and severity of the trigger points and the concomitant treatment of perpetuating factors. According to available guidelines, use of trigger point injections should be short-term and part of a comprehensive rehabilitation program. Available guidelines indicate that, while there are a number of uncontrolled case studies using trigger point injections in more acute pain presentations, there is virtually no consistent evidence for its application with chronic non-malignant pain syndrome patients to date (Sanders et al, 1999; AHFMR, 2002).\n\nBotwin and colleagues (2008) noted that myofascial pain is defined as pain that originates from myofascial trigger points in skeletal muscle. It is prevalent in regional musculoskeletal pain syndromes, either alone or in combination with other pain generators. The myofascial pain syndrome is one of the largest groups of under diagnosed and under treated medical problems encountered in clinical practice. Trigger points are commonly seen in patients with myofascial pain which is responsible for localized pain in the affected muscles as well as referred pain patterns. Correct needle placement in a myofascial trigger point is vital to prevent complications and improve efficacy of the trigger point injection to help reduce or relieve myofascial pain. In obese patients, these injections may not reach the target tissue. In the cervico-thoracic spine, a misguided or misplaced injection can result in a pneumothorax. These researchers described an ultrasound-guided trigger point injection technique to avoid this potential pitfall. Office based ultrasound-guided injection techniques for musculoskeletal disorders have been described in the literature with regard to tendon, bursa, cystic, and joint pathologies. For the interventionalist, utilizing ultrasound yiel"
