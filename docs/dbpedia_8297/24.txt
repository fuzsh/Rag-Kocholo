Things and Stuff Wiki - An organically evolving personal wiki knowledge base. An on-the-fly taxonomy containing a patchwork trail of topic outlines, descriptions, notes, stubs and breadcrumbs, with links to sites, systems, software, manuals, organisations, people, articles, guides, slides, papers, books, comments, videos, screencasts, webcasts, scratchpads and more. Content is orientated towards mostly free/libre/open, mostly Linux. Quality and age varies drastically. Sometimes old things are first, sometimes last. Use the Table of Contents menu to navigate long pages. Zoom in if text is too small. Dead link? Wayback Machine. I probably need to fix the theme CSS after an update. See also libreav.org. Chat to msg me (not checking tho atm). e
