        "text": "The Lawnmower Man - which is streaming now on Tubi - is a new erotic drama featuring a head-turning cast.\n\nThe new thriller from internet creator, musician, and Detroit native Murda Pain follows a suburban wife who gets a local landscaper to \"[cut] much more than just the grass\" (via the film's official synopsis) and her husband's realization that he is getting cheated on.\n\nEvery Main Character & Actor in The Lawnmower Man\n\nThomas L. Harris - Patrick\n\nThomas L. Harris plays Patrick, a typical suburban husband who finds out his wife is cheating on him with a newly hired lawnmower man in the neighborhood. When audiences meet Patrick, he is suffering from a mysterious heart condition and cannot satisfy his wife in the bedroom because of it, leading to her wandering eye at the center of the movie.\n\nHarris can also be seen in A Very Hood Christmas, McGraw Ave, and Buffed Up! The Movie.\n\nElizabeth Foxx - Veronica\n\nVeronica (brought to life by Elizabeth Foxx) has grown complacent in her marriage to her husband, Patrick, and seeks out sexual gratification by way of a local desirable landscaper. After sleeping with this gardener in question for several weeks, she is forced to deal with the consequences of her actions after Patrick discovers her infidelity.\n\nFoxx is best known for appearing in Serial Cheater, Diamond Girls, and One More Flip.\n\nChristopher Collins - Chase\n\nTaking on the role of the titular lawnmower man is Christopher Collins' Chase. This chiseled landscaper draws the gaze of Elizabeth Foxx's Veronica after he is seen upkeeping one of her neighbor's yards. Not long after that first glance, Chase is hired to cut Veronica and Patrick's grass, getting a little more than a cash tip for his work.\n\nCollins' previous credits include Outta Pocket, Neon Detroit Knights, and Tina and Lori.\n\nSino Harris - Jalen\n\nSino Harris plays Patrick's cousin and close compatriot Jalen. After discovering his wife is cheating on him, Patrick comes to Jalen with a proposition: they are going to need to 'take care' of the man responsible for Veronica's infidelity.\n\nHarris is also seen in McGraw Ave, The Mule, and A Very Hood Christmas.\n\nCiera Angelia - Chanel\n\nChanel (played by Ciera Angelia) is Patrick and Veronica's cheeky neighbor and close friend and the one responsible for bringing Veronica and Chase together. Known for sitting on Veronica's stooping sipping wine with her friend, Chanel is the one who spots Chase putting in a hard day's work and calls him over to get a closer look.\n\nAngelia's past roles include appearances in Empire, Sisters, and Black Strait Blues.\n\nKyle Clarington - Larry\n\nKyle Clarington plays Larry in The Lawnmower Man. Larry is Patrick's boss and is seen in one sequence firing the ailing businessman as their company suffers some setbacks.\n\nClarington is best known for roles in Arena Wars, Love Is Not Enough, and Bermuda Island.\n\nNadia Calhoun - Insurance Agent\n\nNadia Calhoun's Insurance Agent plays a small but significant part in The Lawnmower Man. Seen several times throughout the movie, what look to be fairly by-the-book meetings between her and Patrick turn out to have a much more sinister motive.\n\nCalhoun can also be seen in Dance With the Devil, Undying Love, and I Loved U More.\n\nTamia Genia - Doctor\n\nWhen Patrick suffers a sudden health scare about midway through the movie, it is Tamia Genia's doctor who is seen saving the day. Working with Patrick to nurse him back to health, Genia's medical profession reminds Thomas L. Harris lead character to take his medication.\n\nGenia's previous credits include Last Words, Beautifully Unlayered, and I Declare War.\n\nQue Hefner - Officer 1\n\nQue Hefner appears as Officer 1, one of the policemen called by Veronica and Patrick to hopefully find and arrest Chase. However, with little more to go on than his first name and a brick he threw through their window in revenge, Hefner's detective cannot help the couple.\n\nHefner is a Detroit-based rapper, and The Lawnmower Man marks his acting debut.\n\nJulius Simmons - Officer 2\n\nSeen alongside Que Hefner's Officer 1 is Jullius Simmons. Sadly, the pair of police officers can be no help to Veronica and Patrick after they are called to hopefully bring in Chase following his stalking of the couple.\n\nSimmons' only other acting credit is in the 2023 film Stree Code Broken 2."
