        "text": "Jeremy Slate, a craggy-faced actor who found steady work in film and television starting in 1959 and whose most recent appearance was an episode of My Name is Earl in 2006, has died of esophageal cancer at the age of 80 in Los Angeles, CA. In addition to his acting, Slate also cowrote the cult film Hell’s Angels ’69.\n\nSlate appeared in guest roles in dozens of action, drama and sitcom series from the 1960s through the early 1980s, as well as numerous TV-movies. He also appeared in several feature films, including such star vehicles as Elvis Presley's Girls! Girls! Girls! and John Wayne's True Grit. Some of his earliest TV notoriety came from starring in the 1960-61 series The Aquanauts, although he's probably best known for an 8-year run (1979-1987) as Chuck Wilson on the afternoon soap One Life to Live.\n\nJeremy Slate's IMDb page\n\nPost A Comment | Share | Flag | Link"
