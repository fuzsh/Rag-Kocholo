        "text": "Tom Laughlin, who came to fame as the half-Native American, half-white ex-Green Beret in the 1971 indie blockbuster “Billy Jack,” died Thursday at age 82.\n\nA lot of his films are on DVD and on streaming services. If you want to go back to his earliest films, check out “The Delinquents” (1957) -- which was directed by Robert Altman -- “South Pacific” (1958) and even “Gidget” (1959).\n\nAnd for those who want to revisit his best-known films, or perhaps see them for the first time, here are five:\n\nPHOTOS: Tom Laughlin, filmmaker who drew huge following for ‘Billy Jack,’ dies\n\n“The Born Losers”: Laughlin first introduced Billy Jack in this low-budget 1967 biker film, which American International Pictures released in 1968.\n\nYou can tell it’s an AIP film by its poster tag line: “Kitten on Wheels With Her Bike ... Her Boots and Bikini! Out for kicks ... in for trouble? She’s going to Join the Born Losers.”\n\nBesides Laughlin, Jeremy Slate and Jane Russell also starred. Laughlin’s wife, Delores Taylor, who was one of the producers, and two of their children were featured in cameos.\n\n“Billy Jack”: Laughlin’s website at billyjackrights.com called this 1971 movie the “most independent film ever made” since it went through three studios before it was released. The film sold 58 million tickets, the site said.\n\nLaughlin’s Billy Jack is living on a reservation in Arizona when he becomes interested in the local progressive Freedom School and an idealistic woman named Jean (Taylor), who runs it. But when small-town bigots threaten the students, karate master Billy Jack kicks into action. According to the Laughlin’s site, the film was among the first to “introduce martial arts, specifically hapkido karate, to American audiences.”\n\nPHOTOS: Notable deaths of 2013\n\nReviewers loved or hated the film. The Washington Post proclaimed it was “a horrendously self-righteous and devious action movie.” The Los Angeles Times described the film as “rude and sensational, yet urgent and pertinent [and] ... in its unique, awkward way one of the year’s more important pictures.”\n\nTaylor received a Golden Globe nomination as most promising newcomer; Laughlin won the grand prize at the 1971 Taormina film festival in Italy.\n\nThe film’s theme song, “One Tin Soldier (The Legend of Billy Jack),” performed by Coven, was a top 40 hit in 1971.\n\nAnd here’s a bit of trivia. Funnyman Howard Hesseman also appeared in the film\n\n“The Trial of Billy Jack”: The third in the series also brought in a lot of jack at the box office. According to the Laughlin site, the 1974 film broke a box-office record with $30 million in 30 days.\n\nClocking in at nearly three hours, the film finds Billy Jack being released from prison and going on a vision quest four years after he is sentenced for involuntary manslaughter. Meanwhile, Freedom School, run by Taylor, is expanding. But it isn’t long before the townspeople start to abuse the students and the local Native Americans, and once again Billy Jack must come to the rescue.\n\nTrivia: Kathy Cronkite, Walter Cronkite’s daughter, appeared in the film.\n\nPHOTOS: Tom Laughlin, filmmaker who drew huge following for ‘Billy Jack,’ dies\n\nBesides having a strong national advertising campaign, Laughlin and Taylor opened the film wide in more than 1,000 screens across the country -- unheard of at the time.\n\nCritics were less than kind. Leonard Maltin described it as an “awful, pretentious film.”\n\n“Billy Jack Goes to Washington”: This 1977 remake of “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” proved to be the death knell for the Billy Jack series. The film had only limited theatrical screenings, including a showing in L.A. in April 1977.\n\nBut fans can catch it on VHS and DVD. The film features such veterans as E.G. Marshall, Sam Wanamaker and Pat O’Brien, as well as Lucie Arnaz, William Wellman Jr. and even Suzanne Somers. The latter two actors’ scenes were edited out of the DVD.\n\nTV Guide described it as a “long, arduous and sometimes agitating rip-off” of “Mr. Smith.”\n\n“The Master Gunfighter”: After “The Trial of Billy Jack” and before “Billy Jack Goes to Washington,” Laughlin starred in, produced and wrote this 1975 western. His son, Frank Laughlin, directed.\n\nThe film finds Tom Laughlin playing the world’s fastest gun, who also could wield a mean samurai sword.\n\nRon O’Neal, Lincoln Kilpatrick and Barbara Carrera, who earned a Golden Globe nomination for best acting debut, also star.
