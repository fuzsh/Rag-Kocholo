He vows revenge against the gang after he is released. Meanwhile, attractive teenager Vicky Barrington is kidnaped by the hoodlums and taken to their hangout, where a wild orgy involving some of the town's teenagers is in progress. Vicky escapes, but the other girls do not, and a rape scandal ensues. While the district attorney attempts to build an airtight case, gang leader Danny Carmody initiates a fear campaign to prevent anyone from testifying. Vicky, who thinks she is safe, is viciously assaulted in an isolated field by Speechless, a mute member of the gang. All victims and witnesses are intimidated as gang rule grips the town and the sheriff's efforts to maintain law and order are stymied. After Vicky is released from the hospital, Billy hides her in his mountain hideout, but they are discovered and Vicky is kid",

AIP launched a special reissue of The Born Losers shortly before The Trial of Billy Jack’s release in 1974, at which point it received an official “PG” rating from the MPAA. Promotional efforts heavily referenced the popularity of Billy Jack, prompting Laughlin to sue AIP with allegations that the company did not make it clear that the engagement was in fact a re-release of a seven-year-old film. According to a 31 May 1974 DV article, AIP was granted permission to continue running the advertisements as long as posters included the word “re-release” in the same size typeface as above-the-line credits. The 29 Jun 1974 LAT suggested that the film fared better with audiences during its second run, with earnings of $984,449 after three weeks in Michigan theaters, and more dates to be added in Los Angeles two months later.\n\nLess\n\nA motorcycle gang is terrorizing a California mountain town.
