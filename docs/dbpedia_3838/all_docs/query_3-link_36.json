        "text": "David Ellison is Chief Executive Officer of Skydance Media, the diversified media company he founded in 2010 to create elevated, event-level entertainment for global audiences. As CEO, he sets and executes the strategic vision for the company across all its divisions: Feature Film, Television, Animation, Games and Sports.\n\nDavid oversees the entire Skydance film slate which includes 2022’s critically acclaimed Top Gun: Maverick which broke box office records and became the highest grossing film of the year and was nominated for six Academy Awards including “Best Picture” and a win for “Best Sound.” The studio’s recent releases include: The Family Plan, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Spy Kids: Armageddon, Heart of Stone, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and Ghosted. Skydance’s upcoming film slate incudes: The Gorge, Mayday, The Old Guard 2, Fountain of Youth as well as Mission: Impossible – 8. Under his leadership, Skydance has produced a number of blockbuster and critically acclaimed films, including The Adam Project, The Greatest Beer Run Ever, The Tomorrow War, The Old Guard, 6 Underground, Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Annihilation, Star Trek into Darkness and Star Trek Beyond, the Jack Reacher films and the Academy Award-nominated True Grit. In 2022, Skydance formed a multi-year deal with Apple to develop and produce an annual slate of live-action films for Apple TV+.\n\nIn 2013 David launched Skydance Television, which boasts a diverse slate of series across a range of platforms. The studio’s slate includes several Emmy-nominated series such as Grace and Frankie, Foundation, and Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, as well as Reacher, The Big Door Prize, FUBAR, and the upcoming series Cross, Neuromancer, The Runarounds, an untitled comedy starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and an action-adventure series starring Octavia Spencer and Hannah Waddingham.\n\nDavid launched an animation division at Skydance in 2017 with the purpose of producing a bold and original slate of high-end animated feature films and television series. In 2020, David formed Skydance Animation Madrid, which expanded the creative capability, scale, and leverage of the studio. The studio’s inaugural animated short film, Blush, debuted at the prestigious Tribeca Film Festival in 2021 and went on to receive a number of nominations and awards, and the studio’s first full-length animated feature, Luck, debuted in 2022. The animation studio will also debut its first series, WondLa, later this year on Apple TV+. Most recently, the studio formed a multi-year distribution deal with Netflix to release the studio’s upcoming films including Spellbound, Pookoo, and Ray Gunn.\n\nDavid launched Skydance Sports, a joint venture between Skydance and the NFL, to develop premium scripted and unscripted sports-related content, documentaries, and events. Initially launched in 2021, the studio’s first two projects include the Emmy-nominated docuseries Good Rivals and the critically acclaimed film, Air, which received two Golden Globe nominations including one for “Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.” In 2022, Skydance partnered with the NFL and NFL Films to form a joint venture to significantly expand multi-platform programming across sports in a broad range of formats for partners, fans, and viewers around the world. The partnership’s first projects include an upcoming docuseries chronicling the Dallas Cowboys' dynasty and franchise owner Jerry Jones for Netflix, Hard Knocks: Offseason with the New York Giants for HBO, Kelce for Prime Video which both broke records for Prime Video upon release, and season two of the Sports Emmy-nominated documentary NFL Draft: The Pick is In for The Roku Channel.\n\nIn 2024, Skydance partnered with Andy & Barbara Muschietti to launch a co-owned horror division, Nocturna. The focus of Nocturna is on high-quality, genre features for global audiences in both theatrical and streaming. The first project from the studio will be They Will Kill You.\n\nAlso in 2024, Skydance unveiled a new banner, Skydance Games. Encompassing each of the company’s two gaming studios—one led by Dan Prigg (Skydance’s BEHEMOTH, The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners) and the other led by Amy Hennig & Julian Beak (Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, Untitled Lucasfilm Game)—as well as its games publishing, interactive licensing and transmedia storytelling teams, Skydance Games brings to life one-of-a-kind worlds and crafts compelling stories that players want to revisit over and over again. The studio’s portfolio holds award-winning titles across console, VR, PC, and mobile, including Archangel and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, and the upcoming Skydance’s BEHEMOTH, Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra, and a collaboration with Lucasfilm Games set in the legendary Star Wars galaxy.\n\nDavid announced in 2018 that Skydance had entered into a partnership with Tencent Holdings Limited, a leading provider of internet value added services in China. In 2020, he announced the formation of strategic partnerships with Redbird Capital and CJ E&M, culminating in a $275 million equity capital expansion. In 2022, Skydance closed a $400 million strategic investment led by KKR and joined by The Ellison family. Existing investors RedBird Capital Partners and Tencent also participated in the fundraise, which values Skydance at over $4 billion.\n\nDavid is an accomplished pilot and a lifelong film enthusiast. He attended the School of Cinematic Arts at USC and is a member of the Producers Guild of America, as well as the Television Academy. He resides in Southern California with his wife, musician Sandra Lynn, and their two children.\n\nAs President, Chief Operating Officer and Board Member of Skydance Media, Jesse helps set and execute the overall strategy and growth plan for the company, while managing the business across all units, including film, television, animation and interactive.\n\nMost recently, Jesse architected Skydance’s newest venture, Skydance Sports, with the goal of building the first independent, sports content studio at scale. The NFL validated and accelerated the goal when it chose to partner with and rapidly expand Skydance Sports at the end of 2022. Jesse is the Chairman of Skydance Sports, and producer on all of its projects to date, including: the critically-acclaimed film, Air, around the creation of the Air Jordan with Ben Affleck directing and Affleck, Matt Damon and Viola Davis starring; the Emmy-nominated docuseries Good Rivals, around the unparalleled rivalry between U.S. and Mexico’s national soccer teams; documentary NFL Draft: The Pick Is In (#1 on Roku); and documentary Kelce (#1 on Prime Video).\n\nAlso in 2022, Jesse helped spearhead Skydance’s $400 million investment led by KKR, marking the company’s valuation over $4 billion. In 2020, he played a key role in the formation of Skydance Animation Madrid following the acquisition of Ilion Animation Studios, creating one studio across two continents with the expanded creative capability, scale and leverage to deliver on the studio’s goal of becoming an industry-leading producer of high-end animated films. That same year, Jesse was instrumental in raising $275 million of equity capital and forming strategic partnerships with Redbird Capital and CJ ENM in sports and television, respectively. In 2018, Jesse raised $100 million of equity capital and formed a broad strategic partnership with Tencent Holdings to bolster Skydance’s footprint in China for its film and interactive divisions. In 2017, he facilitated a multi-year renewal of Skydance’s first-look production and global distribution deal with Paramount. And in 2016, Jesse took a leadership role in Skydance’s first acquisition—of game developer The Workshop Entertainment—to form Skydance Interactive.\n\nBefore joining Skydance, Jesse served as the managing shareholder of his own boutique entertainment and venture capital law firm and launched the graphic novel and augmented reality company Anomaly Productions. He began his career at Heller Ehrman LLP.\n\nJesse is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, Paley Media Council, and LA Sports and Entertainment Commission. In 2023, he was named on Sports Business Journal’s inaugural “4SE in Sports Storytelling” list that honors the most prominent and compelling people in sports and entertainment, and was listed in Variety’s prestigious Dealmakers Impact Report for six years in a row, 2015-2020. Jesse is a minority owner of Angel City Football Club and of Team Liquid (multi-champion esports team). He serves as a board member of UCLA’s Institute of Environment, Conservation International’s Global Council, and Angels at Risk.\n\nJesse earned his J.D. with honors from the University of California, Hastings and his B.A. with honors from the University of California, San Diego."
