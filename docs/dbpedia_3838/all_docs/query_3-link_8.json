        "text": "There were musicians, kids running around, women dressed in their finest, a few dogs and lots and lots of photos and Hollywood stills.\n\nThe blend was Big Sur and the big screen Saturday, as family and friends of the late actor Jeremy Slate, a 20-year fixture of the Big Sur community and lifestyle, paid tribute with a “rock ”n” wake” party at the Monterey Fairgrounds Turf Club.\n\n“He was the first guy on the dance floor and the last guy to leave,” said son, Jason Slate, before joining his brother, Jeremy Slate Jr., and other veteran local musicians on the bandstand.\n\nJason Slate recalled how he and his two brothers — Slate”s third son, Jeff, died earlier — began playing music in their band Canyon after taking up residence in the 1970s in their father”s bohemian Big Sur digs.\n\n“He was our biggest fan. He”d always say his sons were the best musicians and his daughters are the best teachers in the world,” he said.\n\nSlate, who appeared in more than 80 movies and television programs over a five-decade career, shifted his scene from Southern California to Big Sur after falling in love with the area while shooting the 1967 biker movie “The Born Losers.”\n\n“He wanted to get away from the L.A. scene, and he just sort of dropped out,” said Reba Wilson, one of Slate”s two daughters.\n\nSlate, 80, died in Los Angeles in November of complications after surgery for throat cancer. He was living with actress Joan Benedict-Steiger, an old friend from their early acting days in New York, when he died.\n\nBenedict-Steiger, wearing a trim white leather coat, had a picture of the two of them taken shortly before Slate”s death. His skin was golden tan, and his trademark wide grin with perfect teeth never looked better. “Oh, that man was 50 years old,” she said.\n\nOne table was filled with still photos and posters from some of Slate”s movies. There he was on a speedboat next to Elvis in 1962”s “Girls, Girls, Girls.” Another black-and-white showed Slate, with his wavy, blond hair, and Diane McBain in 1968”s “The Mini-Skirt Mob.”\n\n“He was a handsome devil,” said Jan Braman, one of Slate”s neighbors from Palo Colorado Canyon, where he lived after an eight-year stint playing Chuck Wilson on the soap opera “One Life to Live.”\n\n“He was charming, and we”re going to miss him a lot,” she said.\n\nThere were many photos of Slate with family and friends on display. One small black-and-white from 1960 showed him as a young father with his oldest daughter, Jamie Perham, near their home in the San Fernando Valley.\n\n“It was just sticks and fields and orange groves then,” Perham said. “The farmers used to chase us out of their fields.”\n\nA week after Slate died, about 200 people — many of them friends from television and the movies — attended a memorial in Malibu. Saturday”s celebration featured less glitz, but no less love.\n\n“This is kind of for us, the kids. A sort of celebration,” Perham said.\n\nJason Slate said his father would have loved the venue. He loved coming to the fairgrounds to see shows and the Monterey Jazz Festival.\n\n“I think he would have been stoked by the whole thing,” Jason Slate said. He wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a poster from his father”s early TV series “The Aquanauts.” “My wife had it made for me,” he said.\n\nChris Sutton, a Big Sur motel operator and film buff, said he first met Slate about 20 years ago when Sutton was shooting a local television commercial at a Monterey store. Slate came up to him, talking excitedly about getting Sutton to work with him on a soap opera idea. Sutton didn”t recognize Slate and thought he was just a flake.\n\n“If I”d known who he was, I would have given him more credence,” he said.\n\nSutton got to know Slate later and enjoyed talking about old movies and television with him.\n\n“He was just a nice guy. A Big Sur guy, really friendly and generous,” he said. “I”m just here to pay my respects.”\n\nLarry Parsons can be reached at 646-4379 or lparsons@montereyherald.com."
