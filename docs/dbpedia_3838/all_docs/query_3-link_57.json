        "text": "National Geographic has released trailers and announced premiere dates for key upcoming programs, including “Incredible Animal Journeys” (narrated by Jeremy Renner), “A Real Bug’s Life” (narrated by Awkwafina) and “Arctic Ascent with Alex Honnold.”\n\nThe trailer for “Incredible Animal Journeys,” narrated by Jeremy Renner, features Renner giving a glimpse of his narration as zebras race over tall grasses and polar bears trudge across icy terrain. The series will follow the migrations of animals.\n\n“Every day, countless animals travel across the globe through danger and doubt, perils and perseverance, through hardships and homecomings,” states Renner in the trailer. “Some journeys will last a lifetime. But they all begin with a first step.”\n\n“Incredible Animal Journeys” will premiere Nov. 19 on National Geographic, to be followed by a Nov. 20 streaming debut on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n“A Real Bug’s Life” explores bug worlds, based on Disney and Pixar’s 1998 film “A Bug’s Life.” The trailer features bug-on-bug violence, a spider performing a “Mission Impossible”-like leap (or perhaps Spider-Man might be more fitting) and a bug delighting in a human’s leftover hot dog.\n\n“Bugs. Give me the scaly, the squishy, the ‘oh, she’s fluffy!,” Awkwafina says in the trailer. “These curious creatures crawl, creep and climb their way through life. I’m talking about epic tales on a miniature scale.”\n\nThis Disney+ original series premieres on Jan. 24.\n\n“Arctic Ascent with Alex Honnold” centers on the rock climber as he climbs Ingmikortilaq, a formidable sea cliff in Greenland that has no known climbers. In the trailer, Honnold pants heavily as he attempt to scale the rock face.\n\n“Ultimately, what’s at stake with climbing is always your life,” says Honnold. “The first picture I saw of Ingmikortilaq, it looked like death.”\n\nThe three-part series debuts Feb. 4 on National Geographic, followed by a Feb. 5 streaming debut on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nPlimsoll Productions is behind all three projects.\n\nAmong other Nat Geo programs, the previously announced “JFK: One Day in America” bows Nov. 5 on National Geographic, and Nov. 6 on Disney+ and Hulu. Also, the previously announced three-part “Science Fair: The Series,” based on the doc directed by Cristina Costantini and Darren Foster, premieres Dec. 10 on National Geographic and Dec. 11 on Disney+ and Hulu. And the previously announced “Photographer,” from Academy and Emmy Award-winning filmmakers E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, premieres March 18 on National Geographic, and March 19 on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\n“Queens,” from Wildstar Films and narrated by Angela Bassett, premieres March 4 on National Geographic and March 5 on Disney+ and Hulu. Returning series “Explorer: Lake of Fire,” from ABC News Studios, premieres Oct. 26 on National Geographic and Oct. 27 on Disney+ and Hulu. “Lost Cities Revealed with Albert Lin,” from Raw TV, is back Nov. 23 on National Geographic, followed by Nov. 29 on Disney+ and Hulu. “Trafficked with Mariana Van Zeller,” from Muck Media, returns Jan. 17 on National Geographic and Jan. 18 on Hulu. And “Cesar Millan: Better Human Better Dog,” from Leepson Bounds Entertainment, premieres Apr. 12 on National Geographic, and then is added Jun. 19 on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nWatch the trailers below."
