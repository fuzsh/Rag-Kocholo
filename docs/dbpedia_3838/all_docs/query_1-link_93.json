        "text": "Verity Crawford - Rosamund Pike\n\nVerity Crawford is the titular character of Verity and the wife of Jeremy Crawford, with whom she shares a son, Crew, and late twin daughters, Harper and Chasin. She’s a successful thriller author, who, due to a mysterious accident, is left in a semi-comatose state. She’s described, slender, blue-eyed and beautiful, as well as manipulative, clever, and self-serving. While fans have thrown around many actresses to play Verity—including Blake Lively, who stars as the lead in Colleen Hoover’s It Ends With Us movie adaptation—no one fits the role more than Rosamund Pike. Pike has played a cunning wife in a book adaptation before—2014’s Gone Girl, which she earned an Oscar nomination for—and she’s continued those eerie performances in films like 2023’s Saltburn, making her the perfect fit for Verity.\n\nLowen Ashleigh - Victoria Pedretti\n\nLowen Ashleigh is the protagonist of Verity. She’s a struggling author in her mid-thirties who is hired by Verity’s husband, Jeremy, to finish the remaining books in Verity’s successful thriller series now that Verity is paralyzed and can no longer complete them herself. Lowen, who decides to use the pen name Laura Chase for the project, moves into Verity and Jeremy’s Vermont estate where she learns that not everything is as it seems with the famous Verity Crawford. Popular fan casting choices for Lowen include Dakota Johnson and Alexandra Daddario, however, our pick for Verity’s protagonist is You and The Haunting of Bly Manor alum Victoria Pedretti.\n\nFor one Pedretti has already played a character who moves into a creepy house before in 2020’s The Haunting of Bly Manor, in which she plays an au pair to a little boy and girl who lose their parents. (Which is not much different to Lowen taking care of Jeremy and Verity’s son, Crew.) Pedretti also showed her “killer” instincts in Seasons 2 and 3 of You, so she has what it takes to investigate the truth behind Verity’s mysterious accident.\n\nJeremy Crawford - Jamie Dornan\n\nJeremy Crawford is Verity’s husband and Lowen’s love interest. He’s described as a compassion man, who’s devoted to Verity, even though their marriage is revealed to be unhappy. A lot of leading men have been thrown around by fans for Jeremy, including Henry Cavill, Chris Evans, and Theo James (more on him later), but our choice for Jeremy has to be Jamie Dornan. Dornan is used to romance book adaptations. He played Christian Grey in three Fifty Shades of Grey movies, so he has the experience to portray the sexy, romantic lead of a Colleen Hoover film adaptation. Dornan also showed off his investigation skills in the mystery series The Tourist, making him a great choice to play the husband of a thriller author who isn’t what she seems.\n\nMyrna - Olivia Coleman\n\nCompared to April, Myrna is a friendly nurse who works at Verity and Jeremy’s house on the weekends. She’s describdd as a “little older than April,” and “round and cheerful with two rosy spots on her cheeks that make her look like an old-fashioned Kewpie doll.” While it’s unclear if Olivia Coleman fits that description completely, she is an actress who exudes the cheeriness and welcomeness that makes Myrna the polar opposite of April."
