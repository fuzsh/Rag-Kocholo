        "text": "Jeremy Slate, co-writer and star of the cult biker film Hell's Angels '69 died yesterday of complications following cancer surgery. He was 80. The versatile actor was a guest star on nearly 100 TV shows from the early 1960s onwards and was most recently seen in the sitcom My Name is Earl. He also starred alongside Elvis Presley in Girls! Girls! Girls! Slate, often cast as a tough guy, featured in a string of biker films in the late 1960s, including The Born Losers and Hell's Angels '69, which he co-wrote.\n\nChildren's classic Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is to be adapted for the big screen, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The Fast and the Furious producer Neal Moritz has been hired by Columbia Pictures to write a screenplay based on Judith Viorst's 1972 story about a young boy who is experiencing his worst ever day. No director or cast details are yet available."
