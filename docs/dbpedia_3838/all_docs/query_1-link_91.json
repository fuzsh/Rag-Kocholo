        "text": "I would say that I much prefer John Wayne's later career westerns than his earlier ones, and The Sons of Katie Elder was an example of the main reason why this is.\n\nGenerally they always seem to be a lot more instantly enjoyable. Like Wayne is really enjoying himself and, crucially, not taking himself nearly as seriously as he tended to for a lot of his career. This isn't quite one of his knockabout comedy westerns but it's certainly set up to be one of his more playful ones for the most part, as he bickers his way through the film with his on-screen brothers, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson Jr.\n\nThere's nothing spectacular here and the ending was surprisingly rushed and abbreviated, making me wonder for a second if TCM had snipped a couple of minutes off the end of it by mistake. But there are a couple of outstanding shootouts and a wonderfully deep cast of old western character actors, many of whom are instantly recognisable if you've wasted as much time as I have in the last year or so watching every western on TV. The standouts are probably a splendidly nasty George Kennedy as the giggling gun-for-hire and Dennis Hopper in one of his early nervous support roles.\n\nThere are plentiful moments of humour here as well. The predictable brawl between all four brothers is just as funny as I was hoping it would be while I've spent all day giggling at Anderson being chastised by his brothers for saying that he \"clumb\" a mountain. Probably the strongest point of Hathaway's storytelling here though is how he crafts the myth around Katie Elder, vividly creating a character that we never even get to see.\n\nHathaway was a really fun director to watch and it's been a pleasure to see so many of his films recently. The Sons of Katie Elder was just another of them."
