        "text": "My first hit of William Grefe is this psychedelic swamp tale. I dug the likable trio of outlaw misfits and they had great handles: Daisey, Acid and Dum Dum. The pace drags some, but there's enough to please a slightly doped up or intoxicated drive-in audience. Some groovy chicks laced throughout and a sweet little striptease performed under duress. There's also a band called The Bangles listed in the credits, but don't get your hopes up.\n\nWhen William Grefe was tasked to make a drugsploitation film, he did it with complete commitment-- to the point of making anti-drug propaganda like Reefer Madness look tame in its portrayals of weeds effects. The Hooked Generation is perhaps the director's hardest film to watch yet-- but not for the same reasons as some of his earlier work.\n\nThis film doesn't have the same issues with writing and acting as the director's other work-- legitimately established actors, including a few Peckinpah and HGL regulars, deliver a surprisingly convincing performance. Instead, this film's difficulty comes in the form of its cruelty and depravity at the hands of its horrifically unlikable primary cast. The revolting acts on display-- especially at the hands…\n\n\"Get off into that swamp until you're alligator bait\"\n\nA drug deal gone south when a group of scummy degenerates knock off some coast guard and take a couple hostage as a result of not getting what they want from the Cubans.\n\nOpening up with a step by step in heroin prep and escalating into a drug fueled escape from the law, The Hooked Generation takes a darker turn when compared to the previous Grefé films I've seen. Seedy, vile and slightly disturbing with its subject matter while being a decent \"on the lam\" flick that knows what it is and doesn't hold back.\n\nUnlikable characters, shoot outs and the deep Florida everglades once again becoming the stomping ground for disaster. Grefé really dedicated himself to the location didn't he?\n\n\"You were great, Acid. Just great.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Daisey, I just panicked.\"\n\n\"Yeah... Why don't you tell that to Charlie? He's down at the bottom with the stuff.\"\n\n\"Well, I said I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"You're a sorry mess, that's what you are. If we wanted to shoot it out with those guys, why do you think we dumped the stuff overboard?\"\n\n\"But he took my needle.\"\n\n\"Oh, Acid...\"\n\nThe dumbest, luckiest, to a point anyway, hippies go from delivering drugs to being the dealers themselves when they get a huge supply from their Cuban suppliers, but one of them is hooked on heroin, one's a hothead, the other dies before we know much of anything about him and the boss has delusions of grandeur. You can see where this is headed right from the opening frame, but Grefé held my interest just as he has in the other two films that I've watched from this set.\n\nThe hooked generation is a much different film than the previous films in the set, but it does an excellent job with showing how Grefe was able to do a lot of different things. This is another one of those following scum-bags as they do bad things type movie, following a trio of dope fiends and mostly dealing with a kidnapping situation in this one.\n\nIt actually makes for a compelling film. You really root for the people that were kidnapped, and this movie while it follows the dope fiends through the film, never really justifies their actions or makes them seem cool. In fact the movie seemed to be a pretty big anti-drug statement, as the movie took every…"
