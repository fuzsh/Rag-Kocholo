        "text": "Amid the ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, the fall movie slate has been in a constant state of flux. The inability of striking actors, in particular, to promote their work (with some exceptions) has stoked studios’ concerns around getting audiences out to theaters. Some movies, like Zendaya starrers Dune: Part Two and Challengers, have been pushed into 2024. Others, like the next MCU installment The Marvels, remain on the fall calendar.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, there are still plenty of hotly anticipated films due this coming season, including Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon and a new take on The Exorcist. Others coming to big and small screens near you include film-festival critical darlings from Cassandro (starring Gael García Bernal and Bad Bunny) to Fair Play, a steamy Sundance thriller acquired by Netflix for $20 million out of Sundance.\n\nEven amid the chaos, there’s plenty of hope for great films in the coming season. Below, we’ve gathered our most anticipated movies slated to come out between Labor Day and Thanksgiving.\n\nAristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (Sept. 8)\n\nAristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is based on the heartwarming YA novel of the same name by Benjamin Alire Sáenz. Two Mexican American teenagers, Aristotle Mendoza (Max Pelayo) and Dante Quintana (Reese Gonzales), develop a friendship after meeting at a swimming pool in 1987 El Paso, Texas. The two grow closer and start to develop feelings for each other as they discover what it means to be in love and explore both their identities and, as the title suggests, some bigger questions, as well. Eva Longoria and Eugenio Derbez co-star.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 (Sept. 8)\n\nIf you’re looking for a cozy trip down nostalgia lane, My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 has got the goods. More than 20 years after they first met onscreen, Nia Vardalos and John Corbett (a.k.a. Aidan) reunite with the Portokalos family for a trip to Greece, filled with familiar faces from the earlier films.\n\nCassandro (In theaters Sept. 15, streaming on Prime Video Sept. 22)\n\nCassandro first made waves at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. Based on a true story, the film follows a gay luchador named Saúl Armendáriz (Gael García Bernal) who dreams of winning despite constantly losing his matches. His trainer suggests that he try developing a new wrestling persona: an exótico character, or a queer luchador, who wears loud, colorful outfits. But his newfound fame and attention brings changes to his relationships with his family and his lover, Gerardo (Raúl Castillo). Also: Bad Bunny.\n\nA Haunting in Venice (Sept. 15)\n\nThe film adaptation of Agatha Christie's novel Hallowe’en Party' and third movie in the franchise that includes Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile is just around the corner. A Haunting in Venice, with Kenneth Branagh back as mustachioed detective Hercule Poirot alongside Tina Fey and Michelle Yeoh, will be an action-packed romp investigating the murder of a guest at a haunted séance in Italy.\n\nDumb Money (Sept. 15)\n\nDirector Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) has turned the GameStop short squeeze phenomenon of 2021 into the comedy-drama Dumb Money, whose star-studded cast includes Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, America Ferrera, Anthony Ramos, Sebastian Stan, Shailene Woodley, Nick Offerman, and Seth Rogen. Dumb Money offers a crash course on the story of how a complicated web of Reddit investors, the financial services company Robinhood, and Wall Street hedge fund bailouts resulted in a historic retail trading battle.\n\nFlora and Son (In select theaters Sept. 22, streaming on Apple+ Sept. 29)\n\nA musical dramedy directed by John Carney (Once, Sing Street), Flora and Son follows what happens when single mother Flora (Eve Hewson) introduces her troubled son Max (Orén Kinlan) to the wonders of music, only to find that it has something in store for her too. Her musical journey is supported from across an ocean by a Zoom guitar instructor played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\n\nThe Creator (Sept. 29)\n\nGareth Edwards’ The Creator is a post-apocalyptic thriller about a war between humans and AI. John David Washington plays a bereaved ex-special forces agent seeking to track down the creator of a powerful AI. Gemma Chan and Ken Watanabe co-star.\n\nDicks: The Musical (Sept. 29)\n\nDicks: The Musical is a modern take on The Parent Trap, only instead of a young identical twin sisters conspiring to get their divorced parents back together, it centers around grown men. Two rival business owners (writers Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp) find out they are identical twins and decide to switch places so they can convince their parents (Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally) to get back together. SNL’s Bowen Yang and rap superstar Megan Thee Stallion also star in the comedic musical.\n\nFair Play (In select theaters on Sept. 29; streaming on Netflix Oct.13)\n\nFair Play, starring Bridgerton star Phoebe Dynevor and one-time young Han Solo Alden Ehrenreich, looks into the unraveling of a young couple’s engagement after they meet at a competitive hedge fund that forbids their relationship.

The sixth movie in the franchise, from Halloween franchise director David Gordon Green, revisits the 1973 movie about a young girl possessed by a demon who needs the help of priests to save her. This time, though, a new set of parents and possessed children are desperate to get help from the parents from the original film who went through the same experience.\n\nFoe (Oct. 6)\n\nSaoirse Ronan and Paul Mescal star in Garth Davis' psychological drama, based on a novel by Iain Reid, about a couple living on a secluded farm who are thrown off-kilter by a stranger who arrives out of nowhere.\n\nReptile (Streaming on Netflix Oct. 6)\n\nThe Netflix thriller is set to make its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September before hitting the streamer.

He plays a young man, caring for his sister and haunted by the unsolved disappearance of his younger brother years earlier, who picks up a job as a security guard in an abandoned arcade called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. He’s told all he needs to do is keep an eye on the monitors, but he soon learns that the arcade's animatronic robots are more than meets the eye.\n\nThe Holdovers (Oct. 27)\n\nWith shades of Good Will Hunting, Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers follows an uptight, unlikable boarding school teacher (Paul Giamatti) who gets stuck chaperoning the handful of kids who stay at the school during the holidays in 1970.
