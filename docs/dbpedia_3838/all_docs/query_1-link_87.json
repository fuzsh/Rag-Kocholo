        "text": "In todayâ€™s State of Slate (Sony, Paramount, WB, Universal were before)ðŸ‘‡:\n\nOrg chart of power\n\n20 movies on Netflixâ€™s 2023 slate\n\nFranchises flourishing (and failing)\n\nPaydays\n\nComedy and animation\n\nAwards contenders\n\nDiversity metrics\n\nNetflix, as we know, has been getting hammered by headlines for months. Some of the criticism is deserved. Some not. Some of it comes down to the simple fact that Netflix is the biggest streamer out there with its 220 million subscribers, and everyone takes shots at the king.\n\nBut who cares if the company has 221 million subs or 220 million? I understand that investors want continuous growth every quarter, and itâ€™s true that Netflix simply hasnâ€™t had the content of late outside of Stranger Things. But Netflix is still worth $106 billion and remains arguably the industryâ€™s single biggest producer and buyer.\n\nTo break it down: Netflixâ€™s global audience and staff are separated into four regions â€” U.S. and Canada; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; and Asia-Pacific, and, believe it or not, thereâ€™s still a staff that mails out DVDs and Blu-ray discs, which account for $200 million or so each year â€” in other words, 1 percent of Netflixâ€™s overall revenue of $30 billion.\n\nWhile I wonâ€™t discuss the companyâ€™s value in relation to Wall Street, I know the slate pretty damn well. And thereâ€™s an avalanche of stuff coming out over the next five months, way more than any studio puts out in an entire year.\n\nHereâ€™s the screenshot-and-save C-suite org chart currently managing it all:"
