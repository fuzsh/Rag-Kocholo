        "text": "Barn Burner\n\nWhen Joy's kids are denied enrollment into the camp for troubled youth at the Right Choice Ranch, Earl realizes his reputation for burning down the Ranch's barn when he was a youngster has had a lasting effect. Earl, Randy (Ethan Suplee), and Catalina (Nadine Velazquez) all travel to the Ranch to make amends for the barn burning by building a pen for the camp's new ostrich. When Earl adds Randy to his list for getting him kicked out of the Right Choice Ranch as a kid and consequently ruining his chances at succeeding in life, the truth comes out about how the barn really got destroyed. Earl then decides he and Randy should share responsibility for everything on his list that occurred after the barn incident and forces Randy to right a lot of his wrongs. Eddie Steeples also stars.\n\nLing Ling\n\nDarrin's agency is unable to find a model for the \"Jewel of the East\" campaign. Darrin hopes they'll be able to do so, if only to bolster the confidence of Wally Ames, who is sub-stituting for the company's top photographer. Samantha trans-forms the Stephens' cat into a beautiful Oriental girl named Ling Ling. Everyone flips over her and the campaign is wrapped up. Darrin invites Larry and Louise Tate and Wally to a victory celebration at his home. Wally, intrigued by Ling Ling's feline grace, brings her along. Samantha's efforts to make Ling Ling give up Wally fail. To avoid a catastrophe, Samantha is forced to tell Darrin and asks him to warn Wally off, but Wally only becomes angry with Darrin. Samantha spikes Ling Ling's drink with truth serum. Wally bows out when Ling Ling displays her true cat nature. Later, Gladys Kravitz calls her husband when she sees Ling Ling clad in a mink coat, lapping milk from a saucer. By the time Abner gets to the window, Samantha has returned Ling Ling to her original state, and Abner gives his wife a spoonful of her nerve medicine."
