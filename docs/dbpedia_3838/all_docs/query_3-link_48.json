        "text": "The moment every DC fan has been waiting for has finally arrived… DC Studios Co-Chairmen/Co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran have announced their first wave of projects that will officially break in their regime over the DCU franchise. This new era of DC storytelling on the big screen will succeed the reign of former DC Studios President Walter Hamada, which is about to come to an end with the release of the final four DCU films not associated with James Gunn and Peter Safran: Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Gunn has confirmed that The Flash is going to reset the franchise’s continuity with Blue Beetle and the Aquaman sequel being the first films in this new iteration of the DCU timeline.\n\nThe most recent DC film release Black Adam made headlines for its lacking box office numbers and behind-the-scenes commotion, like Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson going behind Walter Hamada’s back to organize a Superman post-credits cameo with Henry Cavill to all but ensure a “Black Adam vs. Superman” movie to the fans. In the months since Warner Bros. CEO/President David Zaslav anointed Gunn and Safran to take over DC films, both Cavill and Johnson announced that they would not be returning as their titular characters in the DCU after having personally met with the new ruling creative duo. Cavill’s statement seemed more final whereas Johnson teased that he could reprise the role later down the line in “DCU multiverse chapters.”\n\nAs far as this first DCU slate announcement goes, it’s definitely more of a soft reboot than a hard reset. However, not many familiar faces look to be appearing in this new DCU just yet. James Gunn and Peter Safran are taking a page from the Marvel Cinematic Universe by titling this first wave of projects, but instead of calling it a “phase” they are naming it DCU Chapter One: “Gods and Monsters.” The films in this chapter are Superman: Legacy, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, The Brave and the Bold, Swamp Thing, and The Authority. Director-writer Matt Reeves’ much-anticipated sequel to The Batman is also confirmed and simply titled The Batman Part II, but is now officially labeled under the “DC Elseworlds” banner. Joker: Folie à Deux, which is currently in production with lead stars Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, will fall under the Elseworlds category as well.\n\nJames Gunn and Peter Safran have also announced multiple HBO Max shows in their first DCU slate: Creature Commandos, Waller, Booster Gold, Paradise Lost, and Lanterns. The first, Creature Commandos, is a pulpy animated series that is teased to tie into the larger DCU franchise with its characters jumping into live-action. Waller will take take place between Peacemaker Seasons 1 and 2 as a spin-off show that will help segway into the future of the DCU. Both shows are said to release in the next two years before Superman: Legacy. Booster Gold will introduce the beloved time-traveling showboat to audiences. Paradise Lost is described as a Game of Thrones-esque fantasy series set primarily on the Amazons’ home of Themyscira long before Wonder Woman’s birth. And finally, Lanterns will be a mystery series featuring both Hal Jordan and John Stewart, something every DC fan should be excited about.\n\nAs reported by Variety, no directors are currently attached to any DCU projects – although some are “very close” to joining. The same goes for any actor, except Viola Davis who’s returning as Amanda Waller. Additionally, James Gunn and Peter Safran left the door open for Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Zachary Levi to reprise their respective leading roles in the DCU’s future. The only other notable name left out besides Henry Cavill is Ben Affleck as fresh faces will be cast as Superman and Batman. However, Gunn has stated that talks are currently underway for Affleck to possibly direct a movie in the DCU’s future – just don’t expect it to be The Brave and the Bold, Gunn and Safran’s new Batman and Robin movie. Furthermore, Gunn and Safran assured that actors will only be portraying one role moving forward even though the DCU will be multiversal.\n\nIn building an overarching story for the DCU, Gunn and Safran also assembled a writer’s room featuring Drew Goddard (The Cabin in the Woods), Jeremy Slater (Moon Knight), Christina Hodson (Birds of Prey), Christal Henry (Watchmen), and fan-favorite comic writer Tom King (Mister Miracle). Some of these writers are continuing to work in the DCU, like Henry who is co-showrunning Waller. Check out the full reveal from James Gunn and Peter Safran’s first DCU Slate announcement below along with individual release dates and bonus details. All of these 10 upcoming DCU projects are planned to run through 2027, which are you the most excited about? Sound off in the comments!\n\nDCU Chapter One: Gods and Monsters\n\nFilms\n\nSuperman: Legacy\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The start of the DCU but not an origin story for Superman. The film will follow the younger days of Clark Kent as he balances his “Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing.” James Gunn is writing the script for Superman: Legacy and Peter Safran hopes Gunn will direct too. That role is yet to be officially decided though. A separate Superman movie produced by J.J. Abrams and written by Ta-Nehsi Coates remains in development and will exist under the DC Elseworlds banner should it move forward. Superman: Legacy will lead into the next DCU film, The Authority.\n\nRelease Date: July 11, 2025\n\nThe Authority\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The second film in the DCU is the cinematic introduction of The Authority, a team of superheroes with a less-than-idealistic approach to saving the world. The team was first introduced under the Wildstorm imprint at DC Comics in 1999 by Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch and was later folded into the main DC Universe during the New 52 initiative in 2011. The team is mainly composed of characters from Ellis’ other team named Stormwatch. The Authority will explore the gray morality of crime-fighting when questionable heroes take matters into their own hands. The film is currently being written by a mystery writer.\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nThe Brave and the Bold\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The Brave and the Bold will introduce the Bat Family to the DCU. The film will focus on Batman’s relationship with Robin, who will be the fifth incarnation of the character Damien Wayne instead of Dick Grayson, Tim Drake, Stephanie Brown, or Jason Todd. This will feature a new iteration of Batman entirely separate from Robert Pattinson and Ben Affleck’s take on the character. James Gunn and Peter Safran say Damien Wayne is their favorite version of Robin, calling him an “assassin” and “a little son of a bitch.”The Brave and the Bold is said to be heavily inspired by Grant Morrison’s prolific comic run on the caped crusader as well as Tom King’s, focusing on Bruce and Damien’s father-son dynamics. The Brave and the Bold will lead into the next DCU film, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nSupergirl: Woman of Tomorrow\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The next solo film of Superman’s cousin Kara Zor-El aka Supergirl. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow will be based on Tom King’s comic run of the same name from 2021 and 2022. It’s currently unknown if this film will feature the same version of the character played by Sasha Calle in The Flash. James Gunn describes this version of Supergirl as “much more hardcore” and is supposed to contrast with the new version of Superman that will be introduced in the DCU.\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nSwamp Thing\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The next attempt to bring Alan Moore’s Swamp Thing to the big screen. Swamp Thing is said to dive deeper into horror than any other DCU project as fans explore the origins of the titular monster. The character is still planned to interact with the other regular heroes of the DCU since this “mashup quality” proved to work well for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nThe Batman Part II (Elseworlds)\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The much-anticipated sequel to The Batman. Matt Reeves will once again direct and is currently writing the script.\n\nRelease Date: October 3, 2025\n\nHBO Max Shows\n\nCreature Commandos\n\nGeneral Synopsis: A show based on the 1980s comic team of military superhumans, including a Vampire, Werewolf, and Frankenstein’s Monster, who fight nazis in World War II. The DCU adaptation will take a different approach though, as Weasel from The Suicide Squad, Nina Mazursky, Doctor Phosphorus, Eric Frankenstein, the Bride of Frankenstein, G.I. Robot, and Rick Flag’s father, Rick Flag Sr., now make up the titular team and it will take place in the current day. This will be the DCU’s first animated series and is already in production. Every episode is written by James Gunn and some major characters are teased to also appear in live-action later down the line in the DCU and will be portrayed by the same actors.\n\nRelease Date: Before Summer 2025\n\nWaller\n\nGeneral Synopsis: A spin-off series following the mysterious schemes of Amanda Waller set after the events of Peacemaker. Season 2 of Peacemaker has been put on hold due to James Gunn’s focus on Superman: Legacy and Waller setting the stage for the DCU. Viola Davis will return as Amanda Waller as well as other unnamed players of “team Peacemaker.” Both Creature Commandos and Waller are expected to debut before Superman: Legacy. Doom Patrol creator Jeremy Carver will executive produce Waller with Christal Henry (Watchmen) writing.\n\nRelease Date: Before Summer 2025\n\nParadise Lost\n\nGeneral Synopsis: A Game of Thrones-inspired fantasy series set on Themyscira long before the birth of Wonder Woman. The show will tell the origin of the Amazon’s all-female culture and society.\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nBooster Gold\n\nGeneral Synopsis: The small screen DCU introduction of the self-absorbed and time-traveling hero from the future Michael Jon Carter aka Booster Gold first introduced to DC Comics by writer Dan Jurgens in 1986. The series is described to be a comedy as Gunn calls Booster Gold “imposter syndrome as a superhero.”\n\nRelease Date: TBA\n\nLanterns\n\nGeneral Synopsis: A Green Lantern detective-like mystery series featuring both Hal Jordan and John Stweart. The two titular heroes will investigate a mystery that will tie into the larger DCU story seen in the films. The main inspiration for Lanterns is said to be True Detective with it aiming to be “a huge HBO-quality event.” This project has officially replaced the Green Lantern HBO Max show that was being developed by Greg Berlanti.\n\nRelease Date: TBA"
