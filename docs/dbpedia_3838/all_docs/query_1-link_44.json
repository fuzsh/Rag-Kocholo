But this gentle paradise has more than its share of secrets, and Karl will need to call upon all the skills that made him a world-class detective in solving the murders that, even in this seemingly idyllic setting, continue to wash up on his shore.

After serving with distinction in every warzone of the last three decades, he now finds himself in charge of a base with no guns, no weapons, and no tactical purpose. Instead, it has a Michelin-star-level commissary, top-notch bowling alley and the best (and only) fromagerie in the U.S. Army. Surrounded by a diverse group of underdogs, the colonel tries to reinstall military discipline and professionalism with the help of the base’s previous interim leader, who just happens to be his estranged daughter. Going Dutch is produced by FOX Entertainment Studios. Joel Church-Cooper serves as writer, showrunner and executive producer on the series. Denis Leary and Jack Leary also serve as executive producers.\n\nFrom creators Adam and Craig Malamut (Sports Friends, Game of Zones, The Champions), animated comedy Universal Basic Guys centers on two brothers, Mark and Hank Hoagies, who lose their jobs to automation and are given $3,000 a month in a new basic income program.

The event features Anthony Anderson, Taye Diggs, the NFL’s Chris Jones, Tyler Posey, Bruno Tonioli and James Van Der Beek. FOX’s all-new special is based on the international unscripted format with hit versions in the U.K., France and The Netherlands. The Real Full Monty will be co-produced by Spun Gold TV and FOX Alternative Entertainment. During the two-hour special, The Real Full Monty’s male celebrity talent will train and rehearse for the most revealing performance of their careers, culminating with a big strip-tease dance, choreographed by Emmy Award-winner Mandy Moore, in front of a live audience. Leading up the final disrobing, the men will push their limits of comfortability, modesty and brotherhood with a series of rehearsals and experiences, both private and public, designed to build confidence and remove them far from their comfort zone and strengthen their bond as a group. Along the way, each of the celebrities will share their personal stories of how cancer has impacted their lives. The first Real Full Monty special was broadcast on the U.K.’s ITV in 2017, garnering awards, massive viewership and critical praise. The special has since been broadcast in the U.K. annually, and the format has successfully expanded into Australia, France and the Netherlands.
