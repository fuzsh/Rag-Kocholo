        "text": "LOS ANGELES, Nov. 21 (AP) — Jeremy Slate, a writer and star of the cult film “Hell’s Angels ’69,” died here on Sunday. He was 80.\n\nThe cause was complications after surgery for cancer of the esophagus, said his agent, Bonnie Black.\n\nMr. Slate gained fame in the early 1960s on the television series “The Aquanauts,” and a few years later he appeared alongside Elvis Presley in “Girls! Girls! Girls!”\n\nOften cast as a tough guy, Mr. Slate appeared during the late 1960s in several biker films, including “The Born Losers” in addition to “Hell’s Angels ’69.”\n\nHe appeared in nearly 100 television shows, including “Gunsmoke,” “Mission: Impossible,” “Bewitched” and “Police Story.” Most recently, he was seen in the NBC sitcom “My Name Is Earl.”\n\nFrom 1979 to 1987, Mr. Slate was a regular on the ABC daytime drama “One Life to Live” as Chuck Wilson, his longest-running role.\n\nMr. Slate is survived by his partner, Joan Benedict-Steiger; his sons Jeremy and Jason; and daughters Jamie and Reba."
