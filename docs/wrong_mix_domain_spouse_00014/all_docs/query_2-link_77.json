        "text": "Awkward Needs Getting Lucky\n\nFor once, a group of socially awkward nerds were dating the most eligible girls on television and not getting rejected. During the 10 seasons of the sitcom, many relationships, both on the screen and off, developed. It was a really interesting paradox when you consider the types of characters these talented actors were playing.\n\nThe most famous on-screen relationship was between Leonard, an experimental physicist, and Penny, a stunning aspiring actress who lives next door. Penny, who previously only dated tall and muscular men, ends up falling for Leonard, and the two date on and off until getting married. A true turn of events.\n\nOff-Screen/On-Screen\n\nThe show has become such a part of fans’ lives, that they may forget at times that the relationships are only part of the show and that the stars have real-life relationships at home. We only really see this geeky gang together at that iconic apartment, so why would we assume that they actually have real lives when the cameras stop rolling?\n\nJokes aside, it is true - Bernadette and Howard are not actually married with an adorable baby and Sheldon and Amy aren’t going to get married. But, don’t be so disappointed- the stars also have real girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands and wives that are pretty darn cute, so let’s give them a chance here, what do you say?\n\nPopular Kids\n\nThe cast of The Big Bang Theory differs quite a lot from the geeky characters that they play on the show. As a matter of fact, this is a group of extremely bright and wealthy individuals who have become some of the most successful performers in the history of TV.\n\nSo of course, they have dated some pretty attractive people over the last decade or so. So it only stands to reason that we would compile a pretty comprehensive list to see which nerds on the show actually scored a beautiful girl in real life and which stars in the show actually dated in real life.\n\nMayim Bialik and Michael Stone\n\nMayim Bialik plays the part of Amy Farrah Fowler, who is a neurobiologist, and Sheldon Cooper’s love interest over the course of the show. The two meet on an online dating site after Raj Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz see her and think that she will be a good match for Sheldon.\n\nIn real life, Mayim Bialik was married to Michael Stone, with the latter converting to Judaism from Mormonism in the name of love. The couple had a Victorian-themed wedding, albeit with traditional Jewish customs. The pair had two children together before divorcing in 2013. The two boys still have two loving parents though.\n\nJim Parsons and Todd Spiewak\n\nJim Parsons, known for his role as Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, ended up marrying his longtime boyfriend Todd Spiewak. After 15 years together, Parsons decided to legalize their relationship, even though he initially didn't consider marriage significant. They tied the knot in May 2017 at New York City's Rainbow Room.\n\nParsons cherished their bond, comparing it to a divine connection. The wedding took place on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center and was attended by close friends, family, and fellow cast members from the show. It was a joyous celebration for the couple and their loved ones.\n\nJohnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert\n\nJohnny Galecki plays one of the main male protagonists, Leonard Hofstadter, who is an experimental physicist. While he is geeky, he also succeeds in winning over attractive women like his neighbor Penny. Of course, they end up going the distance and tying the knot on the show. In real life, Johnny also has a long history of dating.\n\nAfter working on the show Roseanne, he dated briefly one of his on-screen girlfriends, Sara Gilbert, who also showed up on Big Bang as Leslie Winkle. Eventually, Sara came out of the closet and even had a five-year-long relationship with Linda Perry. We hope Johnny got over her by then!\n\nSimon Helberg and Jocelyn Towne\n\nSimon Helberg plays the iconic Howard Wolowitz, a nerdy aerospace engineer and former astronaut who still lives with his overbearing mother. Eventually, though, he gets married to the sweet Bernadette. In real life, Simon married Jocelyn Towne in 2007. Jocelyn is also an actress and has acted in minor roles in movies and television since 2000.\n\nThe two even worked on a film together called We’ll Never Have Paris in which Simon starred as the lead and Jocelyn produced it. The happy couple have two children together, a daughter named Adeline who is five years old, and a son named Wilder who is three.\n\nJohnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco\n\nThe Big Bang Theory fans around the globe were super excited to find out that two of the main stars of the show, who happened to play a couple on the show, were also dating in real life. Leonard and Penny dated both in the show and as Johnny and Kaley from 2008 until 2010.\n\nThey tried very hard to keep their relationship as private as possible. Kaley Cuoco said about their relationship, “It was such a huge part of my life and no one knew about it,” she continued, “It was a wonderful relationship, but we never spoke a word about it and never went anywhere together.”\n\nKaley Cuoco and Henry Cavill\n\nYou could go as far as saying that the following relationship is Leonard Hofstadter's worst nightmare. At one point, Kaley Cuoco dated actor Henry Cavill, who is most famous for his portrayal of Superman. However, the romance only lasted for a whole 10 days - making it one of the shortest ones on this list.\n\nTheir brief fling was just before Kaley met her now ex-husband Ryan Sweeting (who she married after just three months of dating.) The paparazzi were all over this superhero “couple.” Kaley once remarked during an interview, “I had no one following me until I met Superman.” We find that hard to believe.\n\nJohnny Galecki and Kelsey Harper\n\nAs you know by now, Johnny Galecki plays one of the main protagonist geeks in the show, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. In the show, he dated blonde bombshell Penny, and eventually tied the knot with her in what many believe is one of the most wonderful romances in the history of television.\n\nGalecki has had several other roles including acting as David Healy in Roseanne.

However, Fillion and Allen went their separate ways in 2020.\n\nKaley Cuoco and Ryan Sweeting\n\nKaley Cuoco got a lot of media attention when she got engaged to former professional tennis player, Ryan Sweeting after only three months of dating. Apparently, Cuoco was very sure that she found the one. Kaley had said, “From day one I just knew immediately and it’s been magic.”\n\nHowever, it seems that she was a little off in her estimation. The two got married in 2013 but contrary to Kaley’s previous confidence about the relationship, the two divorced after just two years. There were rumors spreading of divorce three months before they broke up, but Cuoco denied such a thing.\n\nKaley Cuoco and Christopher French\n\nThere have been a string of famous faces that Kaley Cuoco has been linked with outside of marriage. For example, she dated Christopher French, a founder of the LA-based band Annie Automatic from 2011-2012.

The musical duo got married in 2014.\n\nStephen Root and Romy Rosemont\n\nFor a brief period, before he was tearing it up on incredible HBO shows such as Barry and Succession, seasoned actor Stephen Root had a role on The Big Bang Theory as Dan, a guy who interviews Penny for a sales representative position at Bernadette’s pharmaceutical company. Dan confesses that he is terrified of Bernadette.\n\nStephen has played multiple roles but is most recognized for his parts in films Office Space and Dodgeball.
