Per Sports Illustrated, the documentary focuses on the French NBA champ's entry into the sport, his rise to success, and his battle against a torn quad that threatened to end his time on the court. But what about his personal life?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you're wondering if Parker is single, the short answer is \"yes.\" The former point guard for the San Antonio Spurs, split with his (now ex) wife Axelle Francine in August. He posted on Twitter about the end of their relationship, saying, \"After nine years together, during which we shared a lot of happiness, and raised two wonderful children, Axelle and I have decided to end our union. This separation will be guided by complete mutual respect and the preservation of well-being of our two sons.\"\n\nPer the NY Post, Tony Parker met Axelle Francine in 2011, the same year his marriage to Eva Longoria officially ended. As of this writing, it is unclear whether Parker and Francine's divorce is finalized, but the union is certainly over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJournalist, image consultant, entrepreneur, and mother are just a few of the words that could describe Parisian native, Axelle Francince. Per Nail Buzz, Francine completed her master's in journalism in Paris with a special focus on health and science before moving to New York, and then San Antonio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2018, she founded La Petite Med Spa, which, according to its website, is the culmination of Francine's work as an image consultant, and encourages clients to embrace their full potential by looking their best. As an honorary member of Les Lumineuses, a French organization focused on the advancement of women, she advocates for women to improve their own self image as a means of improving how others perceive them as well.\n\nGenerally private about her personal life, it is known that Francine married Parker in 2014 in a ceremony in San Antonio, Texas. The ex-couple have two sons, Josh and Liam, ages six and four. Both boys posed with their mother for a charming Christmas Instagram post from her spa's account. Let's hope the new year is looking bright for them!\n\nAdvertisement"
