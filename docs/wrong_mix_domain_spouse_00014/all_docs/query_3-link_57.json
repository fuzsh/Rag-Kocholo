Luckily, from a purely parental standpoint, they do not have to endure the pain of separating some kid(s)'s lives in a divorce/custody decree.\n\nThe fact that its an athlete and a star is no big deal, are you really thinking that its any different from Bob Smith around the corner committing infidelity with a mom at the school or the spouse of a co-worker? I've seen it. Happens."
