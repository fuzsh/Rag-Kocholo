        "text": "Tony Parker “Mistress” Speaks Out\n\nWell, I just don’t know who or what to believe.\n\nErin Barry, the woman who alleged came between Eva and Tony Parker and soon-to-be ex-wife of Tony’s teammate Brent Barry has released a statement. Here’s what she had to say:\n\n“I DID NOT HAVE AN AFFAIR WITH TONY PARKER, nor did I ‘pursue’ Tony Parker,” the estranged wife of former Parker teammate Brent Barry spelled out on her website last week.\n\n“Unfortunately, because our divorces are occurring at the same time, great speculation has been cast on our friendship,” Erin wrote. “My friendship with Tony Parker had nothing to do with the end of my marriage (which is painful enough without this added drama), and to assume that we had an affair is naïve, ridiculous, and completely misguided.”\n\n“Every day I dedicate myself to being a good person and the best Mom that I can possibly be for my two beautiful children,” she continued. A first-year law student and a longtime advocate for abused and disadvantaged children, Erin added that “salacious rumors” are not what keep her up at night.\n\n“I have spent my adult life fighting for children who have been victimized,” she wrote, “so forgive me for not caring when someone tells me that my name is being dragged through the mud.”\n\nhmm. She ain’t playin’. Do you believe Erin?\n\nDecember 3, 2010 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: brent barry, erin barry, eva longoria, eva longoria and tony parker divorce, tony parker | Leave a comment\n\nTony Parker \"Mistress\" Speaks Out\n\nWell, I just don’t know who or what to believe.\n\nErin Barry, the woman who alleged came between Eva and Tony Parker and soon-to-be ex-wife of Tony’s teammate Brent Barry has released a statement.

Well now the ish is hitting the fan and the truth is coming all the way out. Apparently, Tony was cheating on Eva with his former teammate Brent Barry’s wife! The biggest scandal of it all is the mere fact that both couples were actually friends.\n\nDepicted here with Eva and Tony are Brent Barry and his soon to be ex-wife Erin Barry. The pic was taken on New Years Eve at a party at Eva’s restaurant.\n\nEva has said she’s found hundreds of text messages between the two. And this is what she took to twitter to say:\n\nCNN is even reporting:\n\nLongoria says that Parker cheated on her earlier in their marriage and that he kept in touch with the woman on Facebook, according to Lopez.\n\n“She is devastated, she wants us all to know that,” Lopez says. “But she’s strong.”\n\nI just don’t understand why people cheat, and on someone as beautiful as Eva Longoria! Tony may have his reasons and that was his decision but we wish Eva all the best.\n\nNovember 18, 2010 | Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: brent barry, erin barry, eva longoria, eva longoria and tony parker divorce, tony parker, tony parker cheats on eva longoria | Leave a comment\n\nTony Parker Cheats On Eva Longoria With Teammate's Wife!\n\nWe reported to you just the other day about Tony Parker and Eva Longoria getting a divorce.
