        "text": "The Bold and the Beautiful: Taylor's return may bring surprises\n\nKrista Allen recently stepped into the role of Taylor Hayes on The Bold and the Beautiful which was vacated by Hunter Tylo. Spoilers have been teasing that she might shake things up between Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) and Brooke Logan Forrester (Katherine Kelly Lang). Some fans have suggested she might end up with Dollar Bill Spencer (D0n Diamont) and others who watch the CBS soap are considering that she might have some type of specific agenda that brought her back to LA.\n\nOne of the first things that viewers noticed about the new Taylor since she came on board is that she is wearing a wig. There are several theories about why Allen is not simply having her own hair styled. I assumed the wig was provided by the powers that be in order to make her look more like her predecessor, which she does. At a glance, if you did not know you might mistake Krista for Hunter.\n\nKrista Allen: Rumors are flying\n\nOne fan stated of The Bold and the Beautiful said in a Facebook group that she believed the new Taylor may be getting cancer treatment and wearing the wig because she has lost her hair. A few other viewers say they believe that Allen is wearing the wig because of COVID and perhaps not desiring anyone else to work on her tresses. Last year it was announced that soap stars would be doing their own hair and makeup and some like Melody Thomas Scott on The Young and the Restless wore wigs.\n\nThings are going back to normal so it's safe to assume that professional hair and makeup personnel are back on the job. This would indicate that Allen chose to wear the wig or was asked to. During an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Allen detailed her transformation into the iconic role of Taylor. “The actress knew she had big shoes to fill as Tylo had the role off and on for 29 years. This is why she made the decision to wear a wig and look as much like their original Taylor as possible.\n\nKrista Allen: Sheds light on the situation\n\nDuring the interview, Allen said the following: \" I ordered a wig off of Amazon. It came the next day, and I cut it myself as best I could to make it look like Taylor. I went through YouTube tutorials learning how to cut curtain bangs, and I had the best time just trying to lock in the look of Taylor as best I could.”\n\nThe resemblance is uncanny and the wig may have been what got Allen the part. This may help B&B fans adjust to a new person in the role but in time the actress should make it her own. This is not to say that the writers won't capitalize on the wig and have Taylor dealing with an illness. Anything is possible on the soaps. As the storyline progresses viewers will find out if Taylor does have a secret agenda or is hiding health problems. In time Allen might don a shorter wig or begin wearing her own hair.\n\nRight now she is settling into the character and finding her way with the rest of the B&B cast. Fans are watching and waiting to find out how Allen will do in the role. Be on the lookout for spoilers, updates, and breaking news related to Taylor Hayes on The Bold and the Beautiful and what comes next for her now that she has returned to LA. There may be romance, drama, or both so stay tuned."
