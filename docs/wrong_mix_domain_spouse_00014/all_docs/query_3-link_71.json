        "text": "Although the item included a statement from Longoria’s rep that the pair were just “friends,” Longoria didn’t appreciate Page Six’s speculation. “First Jessica Simpson, now this,” she wrote on her WhoSay page — alluding to rampant chatter about Jessica Simpson’s possible pregnancy. “Once again, press gets it wrong, Matt barnes and I are not dating!”\n\nEven with their divorce settled for more than seven months, Tony Parker and his former wife Eva Longoria have again popped up in the tabloid blogs the last few days. (Hat tip to Ben Maller.com). Rumor Fix.com reports in what it claims is an exclusive story that Parker’s mother, Pamela Firestone, made a dramatic appearance at a recent book-signing event for Longoria at a Williams-Sonoma store in San Antonio. The website reports that Firestone was seen sobbing as she rushed to get counter space so she could deliver a handwritten note to her former daughter-in-law. She then handed it to the actress before walking out of the store. Longoria reportedly remained calm during the ordeal.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker celebrated Valentine’s Day, a win over the New Jersey Nets — and his divorce — by canoodling with a brunette at Tao on East 58th Street. Parker was dining and drinking champagne with friends while “kissing and hugging the girl at the table,” said a witness. The ex-husband of Eva Longoria and the beauty continued partying at Greenhouse, where onlookers saw more flirting and kissing. Parker and the mystery woman left separately near 4 a.m. Parker’s rep said, “He had a fun night out with friends.”\n\nSpurs guard Tony Parker’s divorce with actress Eva Longoria has been finalized. The web site TMZ.com and my colleague Jeanne Jakle are reporting that Longoria’s lawyer filed paperwork Friday in Texas to dismiss the divorce petition she filed in L.A. County Superior Court. Instead, it appears that both sides have agreed that Texas is the best place for the divorce because that’s where Parker and Longoria signed their prenuptual agreement. TMZ.com reports that there was ultimately no conflict in the divorce between the two sides.\n\nAnother sign that the divorce of Spurs guard Tony Parker from his estranged wife Eva Longoria appears imminent. During recent appearances, Longoria’s “7-7-07″ tattoo that commemorates her wedding day with Parker appears to have started to noticeably fade. The New York Daily News reported that the Roman numerals of that wedding date were no longer visible when Longoria attended actor Jeremy Renner’s star-studded birthday party in Los Angeles over the weekend.\n\nGiven that Eva Longoria and estranged husband and NBA star Tony Parker have been getting together — most recently for a San Antonio barbecue dinner captured by a TMZ paparazzo — there’s buzz the couple truly is attempting a reconciliation. The couple’s divorce is still pending, but a close Longoria pal at “Desperate Housewives” hints that Parker’s strong pitches to his wife to take him back “just may be working.”"
