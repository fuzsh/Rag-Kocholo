        "text": "Taylor Hayes was expendable\n\nFans of The Bold and the Beautiful are reeling after Krista Allen detailed how the CBS soap fired her from her role as Taylor Hayes. The powers that be decided not to renew her contract and wanted her to work part-time. Allen considered the fact that she already had not been on screen much in recent months so she declined.\n\nThe actress says she was stunned at how she was dismissed after achieving some notoriety. Initially, some B&B fans did not want her to take over the role that Hunter Tylo originated. Allen found her footing and made the role her own gaining fans along the way.\n\nShe also was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress so to be fired at the same time as this wonderful honor was a harsh blow. The Bold and the Beautiful seems to have only brought Taylor back as a voil for Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) and Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye).\n\nDid the Bridge reunion end Taylor?\n\nFans were divided over which woman Ridge should choose but most correctly figured out that he would reunite with Brooke. The only reason Bridge broke up was because of Thomas Forrester (Matthew Atkinson)manipulating them. Taylor knew she was a rebound and that Her ex-husband's heart belonged to his second wife but she tried her best to win him back anyway.\n\nTaylor did not have a specific place in Forrester Creations yet she hung out there talking to Ridge or Thomas or sparring with Brooke. Taylor expressed concern when she found out Thomas had begun a relationship with Hope Logan Spencer (Annika Noelle). Now she has vanished and no one has even mentioned her. Fans are saying that Thomas and Steffy Forrester (Jackie Wood) should have told their mother about Eric Forrester's medical condition yet they have gone through this situation without her by their side.\n\nThe handwriting was on the wall for Taylor once Bridge reunited which took away her purpose for returning to LA. Without the love triangle and fighting with Brooke there was not much else for her to do. For a while, the two women decided to be besties and leave Ridge behind but fans knew that would not last very long.\n\nB&B discards cast members as if they don't have value\n\nBefore bringing Taylor back the B&B writers had Shauna Fulton (Denise Richards) manipulating situations so she could have a chance with Ridge but that did not work out. Richards is another cast member who was written out along with Katrina Bowden (Flo Fuller). They never returned even though Brad Bell said in an interview he considered them a part of The Bold and the Beautifull family.\n\nWhen Taylor returned to LA she never put down roots the way she should have if she were going to stick around. She was not shown working with clients and did not have her own place to live. She was always hanging around Ridge and her adult children like part of the background scenery.\n\nThere were rumors at one point that Dr. Hayes and Deacon Sharp (Sean Kanan) might get together but that did not materialize. Krista Allen says she is moving to Atlanta and may write a book about someone who works on a soap with a lot of backstage drama.\n\nAllen has been hurt by the way she was treated\n\nThe actress is hurt because of the way she was treated but she is not the first cast member to be dismissed without a reason and she probably will not be the last. She is the only one to my knowledge who dared to speak out and tell fans what happened. Other actors who were dismissed by The Bold and the Beautiful have not opened up except Aaron D Spears who portrayed Justin Barber.\n\nHe was asked about how the soap would bring him back on contract, switch him to recurring then write his character out over and over again he replied with the following: \"It's their show.\""
