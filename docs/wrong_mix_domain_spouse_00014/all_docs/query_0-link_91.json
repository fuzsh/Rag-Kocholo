        "text": "Randy Crawford\n\nMany know Randy Crawford (Aspen) as the consummate tennis professional, wonderfully talented yet also incredibly humble. Randy grew up in Texas, won the state high school championship his senior year and went on to play No. 1 at Texas Christian University for four years. Randy became TCU’s first All-American tennis player, reached the quarterfinals of the NCAA tournament and was named Co-Athlete of the Decade ('70s) for the Horned Frogs.\n\nHe played on the pro circuit for two years and reached a high of No. 69 in the world before a stomach injury prompted his tour retirement.\n\nRandy was brought on to coach Martina Navratilova in 1987 and 1988 as she retained her No. 1 world ranking. He went on to coach Gigi Fernandez who also reached No. 1 in the world in doubles. The Aspen connection proved to be very powerful as he’s been the Director of Tennis at the Maroon Creek Club in Aspen since 1990.\n\nScott Davidoff\n\nAs one of the top ranked juniors in the country, Scott could have played college tennis nearly anywhere, but chose the University of Colorado out of the desire to help put the school on the Division I tennis map. He did just that, and during his junior season, the team won the 1993 Big 8 Championship, losing to Stanford in the second round at the NCAA National Championships.\n\nAfter competing on the ATP tour, Scott was hired as Head Men’s Tennis Coach by his alma mater, where he received regional coach of the year honors during his tenure. He began coaching on the ATP and WTA tour in 2002, leading players to more than ten grand slam tournament titles combined.\n\nScott served as Olympic coach in 2008 and 2012 (India), and 2016 (China). In 2014, Scott and former tour player, Mahesh Bhupathi, started the International Premier Tennis League throughout Asia, in which top players, including Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams have competed.\n\nNancy Rudd Popof\n\nIt was at Green Gables Country Club where a very young Nancy took her first swing at the tennis ball, but, on the courts at the Denver Tennis Club, where she really began to flourish as a player.\n\nDuring her junior tennis career, Nancy was among the top two players in the USTA Intermountain section in every age division, from 1966-1973. She held a USTA national ranking high of No. 25 in 1972 in the G16 division.\n\nNancy went on play collegiate tennis at Stanford University from 1975-78. She captained the team during her senior season, when it took home the 1978 AIAW (pre-NCAA) Team Championship title edging out USC 5-4, breaking the Trojans' 36-match winning streak that began in 1975. It was Stanford's first-ever national team championship title in women’s sports.\n\nSusan Mehmedbasich Wright\n\nWinner of nine national junior tennis titles, Susan reached a US ranking high of No. 3 in Girls' 18s. In 1974, at age 17, she joined the WTA tour, defeating former world No. 3 Wendy Turnbull. She left tennis but returned after moving to Grand Junction in 2000.\n\nFrom 2003-2015, Susan amassed 80 Gold Balls, 35 Silver Balls and 10 Bronze Balls in national championship play. While on the US International Team, she earned 9 gold medals. Susan won four ITF world doubles titles (2006, ‘09, ‘12 and ‘13) and has completed the US “Golden Slam” on four occasions (2007, '08, ’12 and ‘14).\n\nShe's been ranked No. 1 in US singles 8 times, 6 times in team doubles, 9 times individually in doubles and 3 times in ultra-senior father-daughter doubles. Susan held the No. 1 ITF world ranking in W50 singles (2008) and W55 doubles (2013), and in 2014 she was inducted to the USTA Northern California Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nAndy Potter\n\nA Colorado native, Andy won his first USTA Intermountain Summer Sectional Championships at age 10. He went on to win the tournament for three years in a row at age 16, 17 and 18.\n\nHe captured the 1986 Colorado High School State Championships title at the No. 1 singles spot for Regis High School. Andy reached a national ranking high of No. 29 in singles and No. 2 in doubles in the boys’18s division. He won boys’ 18s doubles titles at both the USTA National Clay Court Championship and USTA Indoor Championship in 1988.\n\nAndy captured 12 major Colorado open titles in all at the Denver City Open, Colorado State Open and Intermountain/Boulder Open combined – 3 singles, 8 doubles and 1 mixed doubles.\n\nReceiving NCAA All-American honors in 1992 at the University of Kentucky, Andy captained the team that won the school’s first SEC Championship in its 75 year history and reached a team ranking of No. 3 in the country.\n\nEsequiel \"Kelly\" Lovato\n\nFor 25 years, Esequiel \"Kelly\" Lovato was program director at La Alma Recreation Center in west Denver, starting one of Denver Parks’ first youth tennis programs. A community/anti-gang activist, Kelly knew the value of a strong recreation center where the community could use their energy in positive ways.\n\nRecognized in 1993 by the Rocky Mountain News as one of the Hispanic community’s unsung heroes, Kelly spent his life working with inner-city youth who were exposed daily to a host of dangers. He profoundly impacted an entire community and changed countless lives, teaching kids about responsibility, respect and how tennis could open doors to bigger opportunities.

Her father, a son of pioneers, was an administrator and controller at the University of Colorado. He had regular tennis matches with P.I. Folsom, for whom the current CU football stadium is named, and many other professors. This group comprised Willa's main set of practice partners.\n\nShe graduated from Boulder Prep High School in 1926 where she played on the tennis team. While still in high school, Willa began a dominance of Colorado women's tennis that lasted eight years.\n\nWilla won 19 major Colorado and regional singles championships. At ages 14 and 15, Willa reached the women's singles final of the Denver City Open. She went on to win the tournament five times between 1926-32. Her mastery continued with three women's singles titles in the Cheyenne Mountain Invitational in Colorado Springs between 1930-33, five Colorado State tennis championships between 1927-34 and four Intermountain singles titles from 1928-32. Willa also had success as a doubles player, winning five consecutive Colorado State doubles titles beginning in 1930. After graduating from the University of Colorado in 1930, Willa moved to San Francisco to attend Mills College. From there, she went on to work as a secretary at the Mayo Clinic. It was there that she met Bill Condon of Greeley, whom she married in 1940. They moved back to Denver in 1946 and had two daughters, Karen and Ann. Back in Denver, Willa continued to play tennis. Beginning in 1952, she started playing a weekly doubles match with a group of women that included Colorado Tennis Hall of Famer, Carolyn Byrne. That Friday morning tradition lasted 40 years. In her honor, the Colorado Tennis Association named its annual award for outstanding girls' high school tennis team the Willa Wolcott Condon Award.\n\nAt her memorial, the minister spoke of Willa's love for tennis and it's impact on her life when he said, “The style with which Willa played tennis is the style with which she lived her life. She placed her shots while the world ran ragged chasing them; and she placed her shots carefully, thoughtfully, skillfully and accurately so that what she did made a difference.”\n\nEdwin \"Ned\" Crow\n\nBorn on a dairy farm in Wisconsin, Ned was the youngest of six children. He earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin, and later settled in Boulder with his family.\n\nAlong with a group of tennis stalwarts, Ned helped create the Boulder Tennis Association in 1967. He was elected its first president, and served on the board in one capacity or another continually until 2000. Ned helped found the Austin Scott Memorial Tournament, the BTA’s first activity.\n\nNed was nationally ranked in his age division for more than 20 years, and has captured numerous Colorado State Open age division titles.\n\nIn 1985, the BTA named its fall tournament the Ned Crow/BTA Open, in honor of Ned’s commitment and service to tennis in Boulder. The Colorado Tennis Association recognized his contributions to tennis with the Bud Robineau Award in 1995."
