        "text": "December 31, 2015\n\n[music: “A Light in the Window” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nKRISTA TIPPETT, HOST: Today, a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer.\n\n[music: “A Light in the Window” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Indiana-born and based, Carrie Newcomer has been called a “prairie mystic.” She’s best known for her story-songs like “Betty’s Diner,” that get at raw and redemptive edges of human reality. She’s also an interesting collaborator in writing and performance with author and educator Parker Palmer, novelist Barbara Kingsolver, and neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor.\n\n[music: “A Light in the Window” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I’m Krista Tippett, and this is On Being. I welcomed Carrie Newcomer and her guitar to the On Being studios on Loring Park in Minneapolis in 2014, before a live audience.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: So, welcome to On Being on Loring Park. It’s so wonderful to have Carrie Newcomer here. You’re something of a celebrity in Quaker circles.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. CARRIE NEWCOMER: Well, I’ve never heard that before.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It’s OK. It’s kind of a phrase that you don’t usually see paired together.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Right. I know, but people often, I notice that journalists often refer to you as a Quaker singer. But, I wasn’t sure of this until I started to delve into this, that you weren’t raised Quaker. That wasn’t the religious background of your childhood. So would you talk about what that was and how you came to this tradition.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, I was raised in Northern Indiana. I’m a Hoosier, which impresses people everywhere.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: As much as being a Quaker celebrity?\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It’s right up there. But my mom was raised Catholic. She’s a first generation American from an Italian family. And my father was raised Methodist, but his family background was Mennonite, Amish. So I think I’m the only like Italian-Amish person on the planet, I think.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Except my sisters. But other than that it’s just me. But I was kind of raised, in a basic Protestant-Methodist church later on. Eventually I was doing a service semester for the college I was going to in Costa Rica, and I encountered the silent — unprogrammed Quakers there in Monteverde. But it felt like home. And people will ask me often is that “you’re a musician, you make your life in sound, and you go to a silent Quaker meeting. What’s with that?” But it makes all the sense in the world that my best language has always come out of the silence.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: So, here’s a sentence you wrote. “Music approaches the sacred through the wordless avenues of the heart.” And I wonder, how and when in your life did you discover music and discover that music does that.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I think I do sit with the silent Quakers, but I think my most consistent and deep spiritual practice has been songwriting. And when I became a teenager I fell in love with the singing poets. Those people who were …\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Like who?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Joni Mitchell.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: OK. Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Dylan, when I was feeling …\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Leonard Cohen, maybe.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Leonard Cohen. All these people who were combining beautiful poetry and music. And I fell in love with that. So I picked up the guitar. But that idea of music being a spiritual practice that kind of evolved. Because to be a songwriter I had to develop and practice some of the things that I think belong to the idea of spiritual practice. I had to really start to practice presence. You have to be present. You have to show up.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: To whatever you’re writing about?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: To whatever you’re writing, and to your whole life. Human story. We’re so amazing. People, we’re interesting, and we’re inspiring, and we’re bewildering, there’s something about that….\n\nMS. TIPPETT: So you know what’s coming to mind when you’re saying that is “Betty’s Diner.”\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Ah.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And it’s a very wordy song, too.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes, it is.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: It’s not a wordless space.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Lots of words.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: But it’s really wonderful, and I think it’s kind of classic Carrie Newcomer, and I’m sure a lot of people here love it, too. So, would you play “Betty’s Diner?”\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Oh, sure.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And here’s a question I have for you as a musician, especially because your lyrics are so important, and you’ve written lots of songs over the years. I mean, if I asked you to play something, will you remember all the words?\n\n[laughter]\n\nDo you remember all the words of every song you’ve ever played over the last…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well…\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …decades?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: …when you have a lot of songs trailing behind you, no.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Some songs I might have to dust them off a little bit.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, but not this one, probably.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: But, I think — yeah, I’ve got “Betty’s Diner.”\n\nMS. TIPPETT: [laughs]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: “Betty’s Diner” I think, came out of that love for people. I mean, I was traveling around and touring all over the country, and I think as a traveling folk singer, it’s not like you’re going from arena to arena.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: You see the world close up.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And you hear stories close up. And, so I ended up writing this little song about “Betty’s Diner” about where community happens. And where the spirit of goodness moves in the world.\n\n[singing] Miranda works the late night counter\n\nA little joint called Betty’s Diner\n\nChrome and checkered tablecloths\n\nAnd one steamy windowpane\n\nShe got the job that shaky fall\n\nAnd after hours she’ll write till dawn\n\nWith a nod and smile she serves them all\n\nHere we are all in one place\n\nThe wants and wounds of the human race\n\nDespair and hope sit face to face\n\nWhen you come in from the cold\n\nLet her fill your cup with something kind\n\nEggs and toast like bread and wine\n\nShe’s heard it all so she don’t mind\n\nArthur lets his Earl Grey steep\n\nSince April it’s been hard to sleep\n\nYou know they tried most everything\n\nBut it took her in the end\n\nAnd Kevin tests new saxophones\n\nBut he swears he’s leaving quality control\n\nFor the Chicago scene, or New Orleans\n\nWhere they still play righteous horns\n\nHere we are all in one place\n\nThe wants and wounds of the human race\n\nDespair and hope sit face to face\n\nWhen you come in from the cold\n\nLet her fill your cup with something kind\n\nEggs and toast like bread and wine\n\nShe’s heard it all so she don’t mind\n\nJack studies here after work\n\nTo get past high school he’s the first\n\nHis big hands look comfortable\n\nWith a hammer or a pen\n\nAnd Emma leaned and kissed his cheek\n\nWhen she did his knees got weak\n\nMiranda smiles at Em and winks\n\nHere we are all in one place\n\nThe wants and wounds of the human race\n\nDespair and hope sit face to face\n\nWhen you come in from the cold\n\nLet her fill your cup with something kind\n\nEggs and toast like bread and wine\n\nShe’s heard it all so she don’t mind\n\nYou never know who’ll be your witness\n\nYou never know who grants forgiveness\n\nLook to heaven or sit with us\n\nDeidra bites her lip and frowns\n\nShe works the Stop and Go downtown [laughs]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: [laughs] It happened?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It happened.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: It’s a lot of words.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: [singing] Deidra bites her lip and frowns\n\nShe works the Stop and Go downtown\n\nShe’s pretty good at the crossword page\n\nAnd she paints her eyes blue black\n\nAnd Tristan comes along sometimes\n\nSmall for his age and he’s barely five\n\nBut she loves him like a mamma lion\n\nAnd Veda used to drink a lot\n\nAlmost lost it all before she stopped\n\nComes in at night with her friend Mike\n\nWho runs the crisis line\n\nMichael toured Saigon and back\n\nHair the color of smoke and ash\n\nTheir heads are bowed, their hands are clasped\n\nOne more storm has passed\n\nHere we are all in one place\n\nThe wants and wounds of the human race\n\nDespair and hope sit face to face\n\nWhen you come in from the cold\n\nLet her fill your cup with something kind\n\nEggs and toast like bread and wine\n\nShe’s heard it all so she don’t mind\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Thank you.\n\n[applause]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I’m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: This phrase of yours that I love, the intimate link between creativity and spirituality, is beautiful, but it’s embodied spirituality, right? That’s what you do, right? It’s humanity with all its mess and its edges, and as you say, it’s bewilderment and beauty.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, and I think I write a lot about finding something extraordinary in an ordinary day. Maybe even something sacred in an ordinary day. And I think about that a lot. And I write about it a lot. And I think there’s a longing out there for that kind of acknowledgement.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: That our daily lives are — they’re wondrous. And they’re valuable. And they’re honorable. The smallest things. So, I write about that a lot.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Here’s something else you’ve said, that I’d love for you to tease out for us. The source of all things is the finest and first artist. I mean, there’s a piece of theology in there? You’re not using the word God, which is fine, but, I mean, when we talk about God anyway, in the most traditional contexts, we use metaphor. God is Father, God is Judge. I love God as Artist or the source of all things as Artist. And that really is, as I said, it’s a piece of theology.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, I’ve always had a spiritual current to my work. Some people come to spiritual music and creating spiritual music through the church and some of us come through the bars. It’s a different way of getting there, but that idea that there is something shining in the world, there’s something shimmering just below the surface of things, always. The light in the world as being an artist, as being creative, curious, ahh. But that idea of curiosity, of question, and asking questions again, and sensing that something just shimmering below the surface of things and going, wow, what is that?\n\nMS. TIPPETT: It seems to me this song that’s the first song on your new CD, “Every Little Bit of It.”\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: There’s a great line in it. I thought I knew the question, but I guess not. I really liked that, too, that finding better questions is a sacred act. Do you want to sing that one too?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Sure, I could sing that.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I mean, I think that song touches on a lot of the things we’re talking about. Does it touch on that?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I think so, yeah. I think it does.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: A lot of this song — there was a section of this song that came out of conversation I was having with a mutual friend, Parker Palmer. We…\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Another celebrity Quaker.\n\n[laughter]\n\nIn fact, you two may be it.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I’m going to tell him you said so.\n\n[laughter]\n\nNo, no, I really loved and enjoyed working with Parker. And some of our conversations have become songs. I’m turning on my guitar here. All right. I’m going to start again.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: OK. It’s just like your living room, too.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah.\n\n[singing] Just beyond my sight,\n\nSomething that I cannot see,\n\nI’ve been circling round a thought,\n\nThat’s been circling round me.\n\nLike the vapor of a song,\n\nThat is just out of earshot,\n\nI thought I knew the question,\n\nBut I guess not.\n\nThere it is just below the surface of things,\n\nIn a flash of blue, and the turning of wings.\n\nI drain the glass, drink it down, every moment\n\nof this,\n\nEvery little bit of it, every little bit.\n\nI swam against the tide,\n\nI tripped on my own pride,\n\nSo I’ll try again today,\n\nTo get out of my own way.\n\nThe face was always in the stone,\n\nSaid Michelangelo,\n\nYou just have to chip and clear,\n\nTo see what is already there.\n\nThere it is, just below, the surface of things,\n\nIn a flash of blue, and the turning of wings.\n\nI drain the glass, drink it down, every moment\n\nof this,\n\nEvery little bit of it, every little bit.\n\nThere it is in the apple of every new notion,\n\nThere it is in the scar healed over what was broken,\n\nIn the branches, in the whispering, in the\n\nsilence and the sighs,\n\nAnd the curious promise of limited time.\n\nIt’s true although it’s hard,\n\nA shadow glides over the ridge.\n\nAnd one fast beating heart,\n\nTries with all its might to live.\n\nAnd we sense but can’t describe,\n\nFrom the corner of our eyes\n\nSomething nameless and abiding,\n\nAnd so we keep transcribing.\n\nThere it is just below the surface of things,\n\nIn a flash of blue, and the turning of wings.\n\nI drain the glass, drink it down, every moment\n\nof this,\n\nEvery little bit of it, every little bit.\n\nEvery little bit of this\n\nEvery little bit\n\nEvery little bit of it\n\nEvery little bit of it.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Thank you.\n\n[applause]\n\nI’m curious if you remember the conversation you had with Parker that turned into that song.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, it was actually a series of conversations. We were talking about the thing that shines below the surface of everything. The curious promise of limited time.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yes. That’s a wonderful line.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Thank you. An idea that we’re here, we’re here right now in this moment, and when you know that time is limited, it makes everything a little more poignant. A little more powerful.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I wonder if — the word “light” is a word you use a lot. I wonder if you know that.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I mean, it’s not that…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I do.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …a lot of people use it. It’s a very important metaphor and image and it’s not that you’re the only one who uses it. But it really did jump out at me. The geography of light is…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …very evocative. You had an album which you named…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: The Geography of Light.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …Geography of Light. Well, I’m just wondering if you can put words around what it is about light that keeps calling you?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, I’ve always liked in the Quaker tradition that sometimes God is referred to, or whatever the larger is, is referred to as the light, And we all experience that — that which happens when you see a sunset and your heart becomes too big for your chest? Or the first time you see your baby in your arms and time expands out in all directions from that child? When you see that first red leaf of autumn and it’s bittersweet. And it’s so incredibly exciting at the same time. What is that? So I see it, and I sense it every day. I see it in people all the time. And maybe that’s why I keep writing about it. Because I’m not sure exactly what it is.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, well …\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I just know it’s there.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yes, and I think the autumn analogy also gets at something I sense behind it is also a presence to darkness, right? Being attentive to light because you’re attentive to the shadows.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, it’s all shadow and light. There’s a lot of sorrows in this world. And, maybe that’s part of how I negotiate that. I think when you’re sensitive to the sorrows of this world and you’ve experienced shadows in your own life that you can do different things with it. You can despair. You can shut down. Or you can lean into the light. Without denying or placing in a compartment or making small this idea of shadow, it’s just there. It’s life. It’s all of it. It’s all of the above.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, that is a very redemptive way of thinking about. The song that occurs to me is “Bare to the Bone.” And to me that’s about, yes, I mean, it’s struggling with something like depression, which I have gone through, or these really bad things that happen to us, but also I think that song is about how kind of day to day, week to week, month to month, year to year, struggle is also kind of woven into the things that are right.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Right? It just is. And, there’s something about leaning into that, too, which is hard.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, there’s some songs that land — there are songs that you hone on for a long time. “Betty’s Diner” was a project. It was notes taken on the road. It was a short story.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Right.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Now it’s a play, actually. I’ve written a play…\n\nMS. TIPPETT: It is?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: …with Richard Thomas and it’ll be produced at Purdue University in 2015. But, yeah, some things you hone on for a long time.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And then once in every great while, a song comes all — it’s already done. It’s completed. You just kind of get out of the way. And “Bare to the Bone” was like that. I sat down in my space where I like to write, and it came out in half an hour.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Really?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Would you sing that one?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Sure. I wish there were more of those.\n\n[laughter]\n\nBut it’s only once in a great while, but that idea of struggle being part of it. It’s a simple song, really.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It’s interesting.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …kind of.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Musically. I think something also good happened to my music when I stopped being afraid to do something — to present it simply, because I was afraid that people would think I couldn’t do it in a complex way. There’s a simplicity that happens when you just don’t know what else to do. And it can be a little raw. And it can be real honest. And then there’s the simplicity that happens because it’s the best way to say it. So…\n\n[singing] Here I am without a message\n\nHere I stand with empty hands\n\nJust a spirit tired of wandering\n\nLike a stranger in this land\n\nWalking wide eyed through this world\n\nIs the only way I’ve known\n\nWrapped in hope and good intentions\n\nBare to the bone\n\nThere is nothing I won’t show you\n\nNothing I can hide\n\nI’ve risked it all and dreamt it all\n\nAnd seldom questioned why\n\nYou took me in when I was hungry\n\nWhen my spirit ached and groaned\n\nLaid wide open and defenseless\n\nAnd bare to the bone\n\nSo, when I rise, I rise in glory\n\nIf I do, I do by grace\n\nTime will wash away these footprints\n\nAnd we’ll leave without a trace\n\nBetween here and now and forever\n\nIs such precious little time\n\nWhat we do in love and kindness\n\nIs all we ever leave behind.\n\nWhen the light is slowly fading\n\nAnd my eyes is softly waning\n\nAnd the evening sun is setting…\n\nMS. TIPPETT: You can listen again and share this conversation with Carrie Newcomer through our website, onbeing.org.\n\n[music: “Bare to the Bone” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: [singing]…and the world is barely breathing\n\nThen your voice can call me\n\nAnd your hands can lead me home\n\nLike a newborn awed and naked\n\nAnd bare to the bone.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I’m Krista Tippett. On Being continues in a moment.\n\n[music: “Bare to the Bone” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: [singing] So, when I rise, I rise in glory\n\nIf I do, I do by grace\n\nTime will wash away these footprints\n\nAnd we’ll leave without a trace\n\nBetween here and now and forever\n\nIs such precious little time\n\nWhat we do in love and kindness\n\nIs what we really leave behind\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I’m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today, a live musical conversation at On Being on Loring Park, with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer.\n\n[music: “Bare to the Bone” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: [singing] Here I am without a message\n\nHere I stand with empty hands\n\nJust a spirit tired of wandering\n\nLike a stranger in this land\n\nWalking wide eyed through this world\n\nIs the only way I’ve known\n\nWrapped in hope and good intentions\n\nBare to the bone\n\nWrapped in hope and good intentions\n\nBare to the bone\n\n[applause]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: So, some journalist from Boston [laughs] called you a prairie mystic.\n\n[laughter]\n\nI’ve been around a lot of people lately who have been using the word “prophet,” and I love the — not just the language of a mystic, but the idea. But you use the word “mystic” when you write about people. You know, somebody’s who’s a carpenter, a mystic, and a poet. And I wonder, if you’d say a little bit about how you think about mystics among us, or who the mystics are among us. What are the qualities of that?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: The piece, I think, that you were quoting from was about a fellow in my Quaker meeting, who has recently passed away in his ’90s. And he was just one of these incredible people that just could not get the world close enough. He just was this incredible character. And he would talk about the natural world in ways that really honored that shining something that was present in it. And I felt he was a mystic. He would never say that.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, that’s…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Of course not.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …that’s proof…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Part of the deal.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …that it might be true. There’s this — an analogy that somebody offered me, and it was the earliest days of the show, but I’ve never forgotten it. It was a scientist, a geneticist, who’s also an Anglican priest. He said that the spirituality of a scientist is like the spirituality of a mystic, which is to say, defining and asserting truth as best as you can articulate it in this moment, but always living in the expectation — always taking delight in what you do not yet, cannot yet, know, and living in the expectation of better discoveries to come.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, that idea of living in the expectation, to live in the question.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And, to be comfortable there, to live in the question.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And in the wonder of it, the wonder of the question.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I think, though, sometimes, living in the wonder can be a creative tension, but in a tension with the certainties. And I think that was his point, that that is actually a holy tension, a sacred tension.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I think it is. Though something happens — I have a song called “I Believe” that came about because I was asked to sing in a church service, and this particular church service at one point, the people stood and they recited a creed together as a community.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: They weren’t Quakers?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: They weren’t Quakers, because they kind of don’t say anything, so…\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: But I got to thinking about it, that there is something powerful, not when it’s said without thought, but when you do say something out loud that’s important to you, I love you, and you mean it. Or, if you need me I will be there. When you say it out loud, this I love, something shifts, something changes a little bit. So there is that thing of what is it, I believe? What is it that I think is true, at least now, as close as I can find and articulate?\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, I think there’s something…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And I wonder.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …deeply human and essential about that.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Even for the most deeply constantly questioning of us.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: The edges can get soft.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, there’s no place to put your feet.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: There’s something that you wrote — this is in your book, and I may just read a little bit of this, and maybe ask you to read the rest of it. Or then you read it yourself, but I want to read it just because I love these words. “Three Gratitudes.” Now, and it’s a wonderful poem, but I also just find this idea so useful. I want to start doing this myself. And here’s how it starts: “Every night before I go to sleep I say out loud three things that I am grateful for, all the significant, insignificant, extraordinary, ordinary stuff of my life. It’s a small practice and humble, and yet, I find I sleep better holding what lightens and softens my heart.”\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And it’s true. It was like this saying out loud three things. Sometimes they would be big things, and sometimes they would be little things. And then sometimes I’d get on a roll and I just couldn’t stop.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And you do it even on the days that were hard?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes, I would. And that would change something.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: There’s some really interesting science now about — and it’s not that different from this. I mean, it’s just about asking people and the — in a study to, once a week or once a day make a list of things they’re grateful for, very routine.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And it improves their health, and, yeah, they sleep better, they’re more at peace.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Kindness is another idea like that. I think we talk about love a lot, and I think love can get really big. Love gets like, you can’t almost get your arms around it, it’s such a big thing, but kindness. Kindness is like the country cousin to love.\n\n[laughter]\n\nIt just kind of does dishes, when no one asked it to.\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou know what I mean? And I try in some ways that the songs that I write would have a bit of that feeling to them that just, a sense of kindness about them, as to hope, anyways.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Hmm. You want to read that poem?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Sure.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: The whole thing, the “Three Gratitudes”.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: “Three Gratitudes”, this is related to a song called “Thank You and Good Night.”\n\nEvery night before I go to sleep\n\nI say out loud\n\nThree things that I’m grateful for,\n\nAll the significant, insignificant\n\nExtraordinary, ordinary stuff of my life.\n\nIt’s a small practice and humble,\n\nAnd yet, I find I sleep better\n\nHolding what lightens and softens my life\n\nEver so briefly at the end of the day.\n\nSunlight, and blueberries,\n\nGood dogs and wool socks,\n\nA fine rain,\n\nA good friend,\n\nFresh basil and wild phlox,\n\nMy father’s good health,\n\nMy daughter’s new job,\n\nThe song that always makes me cry,\n\nAlways at the same part,\n\nNo matter how many times I hear it.\n\nDecent coffee at the airport,\n\n[laughter]\n\nAnd your quiet breathing,\n\nThe stories you told me,\n\nThe frost patterns on the windows,\n\nEnglish horns and banjos,\n\nWood Thrush and June bugs,\n\nThe smooth glassy calm of the morning pond,\n\nAn old coat,\n\nA new poem,\n\nMy library card,\n\n[laughter]\n\nAnd that my car keeps running\n\nDespite all the miles.\n\nAnd after three things,\n\nMore often than not,\n\nI get on a roll and I just keep on going,\n\nI keep naming and listing,\n\nUntil I lie grinning,\n\nBlankets pulled up to my chin,\n\nAwash with wonder\n\nAt the sweetness of it all.\n\n[applause]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: You wrote — or said, “My best prayers are songs, always have been.”\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And I wondered if you might sing us a song that is a prayer.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, they’re all kind of.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: They’re all kind of like that.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, OK. Well, what feels more like the prayer you would pray today?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: So this is on the new one. And it’s kind of about hope in a way, and thresholds, and there’s a lot on this new album about thresholds. We’re always coming up to new thresholds.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: That’s such a great word, too. I love that word. Thresholds.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I do, too.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: And we keep arriving at them and, at a threshold there’s often a moment where what is old has passed away, but the new hasn’t quite arrived yet. So you stand there at the doorway. And all the more important that we remember to be kind.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: ‘Cause we’re all kind of figuring it out right now.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: But yeah, that idea — and I think you’re — I really sense that everywhere I go, too I think there is this longing out there — that longing. And sometimes, not even sure what exactly the longing’s about just yet.\n\n[singing] Looking out at the night\n\nBeyond the driver’s wheel,\n\nCurving hips made of snow\n\nIn the winter fields.\n\nThere’s a house set way back\n\nWhere the lamplight glows,\n\nLike a star out in the cold,\n\nFilled with people I’ll never know,\n\nWho left a light,\n\nLeft a light in the window.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: I’m Krista Tippett and this is On Being. Today a musical conversation with folk singer-songwriter Carrie Newcomer.\n\n[music: “A Light in the Window” by Carrie Newcomer]\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: [singing] What would I change if\n\nThe choice were mine?\n\nI was doing the best\n\nI knew at the time.\n\nAnd every door that was opened\n\nAnd door that closed,\n\nAll the things that made me grow,\n\nSent me off down another road,\n\nOff to look for a light,\n\nFor a light in the window.\n\nNow the old has already passed away\n\nBut the new is too new\n\nto be born today.\n\nSo I’m throwing out seeds\n\nOn the winter snow,\n\nAs a cold wind begins to blow,\n\nStanding here on a new threshold,\n\nI can see a light,\n\nThere’s a light in the window.\n\nAnd the world is made of stone,\n\nAnd the world is made of glass.\n\nAnd the world is made of light,\n\nAnd it’s moving very fast.\n\nWe pass from mystery to mystery\n\nSo I won’t lie\n\nI don’t know what happens\n\nWhen people die.\n\nBut I hope that I see you walking slow,\n\nSmiling wide as a sunrise grows,\n\nDrop my map with a thousand folds,\n\nIn the distance I see it glow,\n\nThere’s a light, there’s a light\n\nThere’s a light in the window\n\n[applause]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: There’s that light again.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: There it is again. It does fascinate me.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: So, this one, actually, I listened to this great interview that you did with Vincent Harding.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Oh, yeah, who just died this year.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yeah, and, what a beautiful interview that was.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I mean, just talking about people singing together.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yes.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: The importance of people singing together.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: How in the ’60s, how the Civil Rights Movement sang their way to freedom.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: I was very touched by it. And he kind of challenged, though, a little bit at the end. We need those — we need more. We need the new ones that people are writing today. And I thought, yeah, well, I’m a songwriter.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Yeah, no, and I want to ask you about that, I talked to the Indigo Girls last summer.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Mm-hmm.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: And Amy Ray in particular, she’s very oriented towards social justice. And I asked them, and this was on my list of questions we didn’t get to. She said, this is something I’m thinking about. And I think songwriters are thinking about — where’s the Pete Seeger? And music was so central…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …to all of that ferment a few decades ago.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes, and it’s an interesting, it’s really an art form. It’s a challenge to write a song, a song that people can sing immediately the first time they hear it.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Well, and the other thing that they got people doing, and the spirituals, of course, did this, right?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Which is what…\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: The call and response.\n\nMS. TIPPETT: …the Civil Rights — yeah.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Yes.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: But something happens, the room shifts when people sing together. And they sing out loud things, words and phrases, that touch something deep and human and hopeful. And I wanted to write a song that talked about hope, but not in a greeting card kind of way. There’s the kind of hope that’s like wishful thinking. And then there’s like a hope that’s kind of gritty. It’s like, the kind of hope that gets up every morning and chooses to try to make the world just a little kinder place in your own way. And the next morning gets up, and does it again. And the next morning, gets up, and you have been disappointed. And you do it again. I wanted to write about the kind of hope that’s faithful, that kind that Niebuhr talked about: “anything worth doing will probably not be achieved in one lifetime. So we are saved by hope.” That kind of hope. And that’s a harder kind of hope to live with, because it’s easier to be cynical. I mean, when you’re cynical, you’re never disappointed.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Right. That’s true.\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It’s like, well, I knew that.\n\n[laughter]\n\nMS. TIPPETT: It’s cowardly in that sense, isn’t it?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, it’s courageous to hope, because when you do choose to hope, eventually at some point your heart will be broken, and you will be disappointed. And then you get up and you do it again. But I think courage has nothing to do with being fearless. I think courage has everything to do with loving something or someone so much that you will brave it with solid feet or shaky knees because you love it that much. And music has always been like that for me, And, the things we hope for. The things we love. We hope, because we love it that much. It’s worth the risk.We do have an audience here, so, you could sing along.\n\n[laughter]\n\nYou’ve been hoping, right?\n\nMS. TIPPETT: Well, we just figure out when to sing along?\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Well, this is the part.\n\n[singing] If not now, tell me when\n\nTry that?\n\nAUDIENCE: If not now, tell me when\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: It goes like this:\n\n[singing] We may never see this moment\n\nAUDIENCE: We may never see this moment\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: Or place and time again\n\nAUDIENCE: Or place and time again\n\nMS. NEWCOMER: If not now, if not now, tell me when\n\nOK, here’s the whole thing.\n\n[singing] If not now, tell me when\n\nIf not now, tell me when\n\nMS.
