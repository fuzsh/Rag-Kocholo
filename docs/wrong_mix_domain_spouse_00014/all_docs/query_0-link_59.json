        "text": "American actress and producer (born 1988)\n\nEmily Jean \"Emma\" Stone (born November 6, 1988) is an American actress and producer. Her accolades include two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards. In 2017, she was the world's highest-paid actress and named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\n\nStone began acting as a child in a theater production of The Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles and made her television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she appeared in a series of well-received teen comedy films, such as Superbad (2007), Zombieland (2009), and Easy A (2010), which was Stone's first leading role. Following this breakthrough, she starred in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the period drama The Help (2011), and gained wider recognition as Gwen Stacy in the 2012 superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man and its 2014 sequel.\n\nStone received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a recovering drug addict in Birdman (2014) and portraying Abigail Masham in The Favourite (2018). The latter marked her first of many collaborations with director Yorgos Lanthimos. She won two Academy Awards for Best Actress, for her roles as an aspiring actress in the romantic musical La La Land (2016) and a resurrected suicide victim in Lanthimos' comic fantasy film Poor Things (2023). She also portrayed tennis player Billie Jean King in Battle of the Sexes (2017) and the title role in Cruella (2021). On television, she starred in the dark comedy miniseries Maniac (2018) and The Curse (2023).\n\nOn Broadway, Stone has starred as Sally Bowles in a revival of the musical Cabaret (2014–2015). She and her husband, Dave McCary, founded the production company Fruit Tree in 2020, under which they have produced the films When You Finish Saving the World (2022), Problemista (2023), and I Saw the TV Glow (2024).\n\nEarly life and education\n\nStone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company, and Krista Jean Stone (née Yeager), a homemaker.[1][2] She lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from ages 12 to 15.[3][4] She has a younger brother, Spencer.[5] Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to \"Stone\". She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[6]\n\nAs an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child.[7] She has said she was \"loud\" and \"bossy\" while growing up.[8] Stone was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has said that her controlling nature meant that \"I made sure I got all A's\". Stone suffered panic attacks and anxiety as a child,[10] which she says caused a decline in her social skills.[11] She underwent therapy but said it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks; she recalled:\n\nThe first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend's house, and I thought the house was burning down. I called my mom and she brought me home, and for the next three years it just would not stop. I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands. I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be, then ask again 30 seconds later. I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change.[10]\n\nStone wanted to act since age four;[4] she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus to musical theater, and took vocal lessons for several years.[12] Her acting debut, at age 11, came in a stage production of The Wind in the Willows, playing Otter.[13] Stone was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in 16 productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre—including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat[1]—and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe.[14] Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role on Nickelodeon's All That. Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.[2]\n\nStone attended Xavier College Preparatory—an all-girl Catholic high school—as a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress.[1] She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled \"Project Hollywood\" (featuring Madonna's 2003 song \"Hollywood\") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career.[12] In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalled, \"I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom\", adding, \"I ended up getting none.\"[4] Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.[2][10]\n\nCareer\n\nCareer beginnings (2004–2009)\n\nWhen Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, the name \"Emily Stone\" was already taken.[16] She initially chose to go by \"Riley Stone\" or \"Emily J. Stone\" (like Michael J. Fox) for her stage name, but after guest-starring in the televisions shows Medium and Malcolm in the Middle, she decided that she was more comfortable with \"Emma\",[17] a name she chose in honor of Emma Bunton of the Spice Girls.[18][19] In 2024, she revealed that she had asked her colleagues and close collaborators on set to call her Emily, adding that she prefers to be called by her birth name.[16][19] Stone made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004). The resulting show, retitled The New Partridge Family (2004), remained an unsold pilot.[20] She followed this with guest appearances in the aforementioned Medium (2005) and Malcolm in the Middle (2006), as well as Louis C.K.'s HBO series Lucky Louie (2006).[10][21] She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her \"rock bottom\" experience.[2] In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama Drive, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.[1]\n\nStone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola's comedy Superbad (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play Hill's romantic interest, she dyed her hair red.[22] A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her \"appealing\", but felt that her role was poorly written.[23] Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as \"amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I've had since then\".[24] The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.[25][26]\n\nThe next year, Stone starred in the comedy The Rocker (2008) as Amelia Stone, the \"straight face\" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role.[27] The actress, who has called herself \"a big smiler and laugher\", said she found it difficult to play a character whose personality was so different from her own. The film and her performance received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure.[28][29] Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box office, becoming a moderate commercial success.[30] The film saw her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song \"I Know What Boys Like\".[31] Reviews were generally negative,[32] but Stone was praised,[33] with TV Guide's Ken Fox writing that she \"is well on her way to becoming a star\".[34]\n\nStone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters's Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Loosely based on Charles Dickens's 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, but it was a modest commercial success.[35][36] Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer's $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film Zombieland,[37] in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine thought was \"somewhat underwritten.\"[38] In a more positive review, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph called \"the hugely promising Stone […] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years\".[39] Stone's third release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney's Paper Man, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.[40]\n\nRise to prominence (2010–2013)\n\nStone voiced an Australian Shepherd in Marmaduke (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey based on Brad Anderson's long-running comic strip of the same name.[41] Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in Easy A, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck.[42][43] Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script \"so different and unique from anything I'd read before\", calling it \"funny and sweet\".[44] When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition.[45] The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone's performance was considered its prime asset.[46] Anna Smith of Time Out wrote, \"Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth.\"[47] The film was a commercial success, grossing $75 million against its $8 million budget.[48] Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.[49]\n\nIn October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC's sketch comedy Saturday Night Live; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan.[50] Stone called it \"the greatest week of my life\".[4][51] She hosted again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015.[52] A brief appearance in the sex comedy Friends with Benefits (2011) reunited her with Gluck.[53] She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film featured her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling's character. Despite finding \"some inevitable collapses into convention\" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone \"ties the whole film together\".[54] At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress – Comedy award for her performance in the film.[55] Crazy, Stupid, Love was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide against a production budget of $50 million.[56]\n\nDismayed at being typecast as \"the sarcastic interest of the guy\", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found challenging.[57] The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work on the film. The director said, \"[Stone] was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter.\"[58] She was cast as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she learned to speak in a Southern accent and educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film.[59] With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a $25 million budget, The Help became Stone's highest-grossing film to that point.[60] The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought Stone was \"well-meaning and hugely likable\" despite finding flaws in the character.[61] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,[62] and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.[63][64]\n\nStone turned down a role in the action comedy 21 Jump Street after signing on to Marc Webb's 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series.[65][66] She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the titular superhero (played by Andrew Garfield).[67] Stone returned to her natural blonde hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously.[68][69] She admitted to having never read the comics, and therefore felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\",[70] adding that she was only familiar with Stacy's character as portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard in Spider-Man 3.[71][72] The Amazing Spider-Man was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of the year with global revenues of $757.9 million.[73] Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone to be \"irresistible\",[74] and Ian Freer of Empire was particularly impressed with Stone's and Garfield's performances.[75] At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress.[76] Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game Sleeping Dogs, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female.[77]\n\nStone began 2013 with a voice role in the DreamWorks Animation film The Croods, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[78] This followed with an appearance in Movie 43, an anthology film which consists of 16 short stories—she played the title role in the segment entitled \"Veronica\".[79] She next starred alongside Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s.[80] A. O. Scott of The New York Times dismissed the film as \"a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits\", but praised Stone's pairing with Gosling.[81] She expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.[82]\n\nEstablished actress (2014–2017)\n\nIn 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. She believed that her character did not depend on the film's protagonist, asserting: \"She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He's the muscle, she's the brains.\"[83] Her performance was well received by critics;[84] an Empire reviewer commended her for standing out in the film, writing, \"Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character.\"[85] The role won her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards.[86] Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen's romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, a modest commercial success.[87] A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as \"the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect\".[88]\n\nThe black comedy Birdman, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, was Stone's final film release of 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, it featured her as Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. Iñárritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter.[89] Birdman was critically acclaimed,[90] and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture.[91] The Movie Network deemed it one of Stone's best performances to date, and Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph found her to be \"superb\" and \"tremendous\" in her role, while also highlighting her monologue in the film which he believed to have been \"delivered like a knitting needle to the gut.\"[92][93] She received Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe, and SAG Award nominations.[94]\n\nFrom November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical Cabaret as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams.[95] Deeming it \"the most nerve-racking thing ever\", Stone listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role.[96][97] Marilyn Stasio of Variety was critical of her singing abilities and found her performance to be \"a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy.\"[98] Both of Stone's 2015 films—the romantic comedy Aloha, and the drama Irrational Man—were critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics.[87][99] In Cameron Crowe's Aloha, she played the role of an air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in Woody Allen's Irrational Man, she played the love interest of Joaquin Phoenix's character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast, as Stone's character was meant to be of Asian, Hawaiian, and Swedish descent. She later regretted taking part in the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood.[100] Despite the backlash, Stone was nominated for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.[101] She also appeared in the music video for Will Butler's single \"Anna\".[102]\n\nDuring her run on Cabaret, Stone met filmmaker Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama La La Land.[103] The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, starred Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles.[104] Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[105][106] For the film's soundtrack, she recorded six songs.[a] La La Land served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, where it generated critical acclaim and earned Stone the Volpi Cup for Best Actress.[108] It emerged as a commercial success, with a worldwide gross of over $440 million against a production budget of $30 million.[109] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote that \"Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears.\"[110] For her performance, Stone won the Academy, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA Award for Best Actress.[111]\n\nStone's sole release of 2017 was Battle of the Sexes, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell). In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, worked with a dialect coach to speak in King's accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg).[112][113] The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone's performance to be the finest of her career.[114] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian praised her for playing against type, and for being \"strong\" and \"convincing\" in the part.[115] Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget.[116] Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.[117]\n\nFilms with Yorgos Lanthimos and professional expansion (2018–present)\n\nIn 2018, Stone and Rachel Weisz played Abigail Masham and Sarah Churchill, two cousins fighting for the affection of Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), in Yorgos Lanthimos's historical comedy-drama The Favourite. She found it challenging to be an American among an all-British cast, and struggled with mastering her character's accent.[118] The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival to critical acclaim.[119] Michael Nordine of IndieWire praised Stone for taking on such a bold role following the success of La La Land, and termed the three lead actresses \"a majestic triumvirate in a period piece that's as tragic as it is hilarious.\"[120] Stone then executive-produced and starred in the Netflix dark comedy miniseries Maniac (2018), directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga. It featured Stone and Jonah Hill as two strangers whose lives are transformed due to a mysterious pharmaceutical trial.
