        "text": "trivia...yeah, it's off wiki, but close enough and i'm too lazy to look further\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor\n\nThe U.S. Army Medal of Honor was first authorized by a joint resolution of Congress on July 12, 1862. The specific authorizing statute was 10 U.S.C. § 3741, which states:\n\n“ The President may award, and present in the name of Congress, a medal of honor of appropriate design, with ribbons and appurtenances, to a person who while a member of the Army, distinguished himself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.[36]\n\n”\n\nLater authorizations created similar medals for other branches of the service.\n\nThe Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients. By law, recipients have several benefits:\n\n• Each Medal of Honor recipient may have his or her name entered on the Medal of Honor Roll (38 U.S.C. § 1560). Each person whose name is placed on the Medal of Honor Roll is certified to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as being entitled to receive the special pension of US$1,027 per month above and beyond any military pensions or other benefits for which they may be eligible. As of December 1, 2004, the pension is subject to cost-of-living increases.\n\n• Enlisted recipients of the Medal of Honor are entitled to a supplemental uniform allowance.\n\n• Recipients receive special entitlements to air transportation under the provisions of DOD Regulation 4515.13-R.\n\n• Special identification cards and commissary and exchange privileges are provided for Medal of Honor recipients and their eligible dependents.\n\n• Fully qualified children of recipients are eligible for admission to the United States military academies without regard to the nomination and quota requirements.\n\n• Recipients receive a 10% increase in retired pay under 10 U.S.C. § 3991.\n\n• Those awarded the medal after October 23, 2002, also receive a Medal of Honor Flag. The law also specifies that all 103 living prior recipients also receive the flag.(14 U.S.C. § 505).\n\n• As with all medals, retired personnel may wear the Medal of Honor on \"appropriate\" civilian clothing. Regulations also specify that recipients of the Medal of Honor are allowed to wear the uniform \"at their pleasure\" with standard restrictions on political, commercial, or extremist purposes; other former members of the armed forces may do so only at certain ceremonial occasions.[40][41]\n\nSaluting\n\n• In the United States Coast Guard it is customary for a Medal of Honor recipient to always be saluted, no matter what the rank.[42]\n\n• Recipients are always greeted and saluted before non-recipients are greeted or saluted.\n\nOther privileges and courtesies\n\n• Many states offer distinctive Medal of Honor vehicle license plates to recipients without additional charges or fees.\n\n• Living Medal of Honor recipients are often invited to Presidential Inaugurations and accompanying festivities.\n\nLegal protection\n\nUntil late 2006, the Medal of Honor was the only service decoration afforded special protection under federal law to prevent it from being imitated or privately sold. The Stolen Valor Act of 2005, enacted December 20, 2006, extended federal protection to include false verbal, written, or physical claims to other military decorations, service medals, or military badges to which a person is not entitled.[43][44]\n\nThe Medal of Honor on display\n\nAll Medals of Honor are issued in the original only, by the Department of Defense, to a recipient. Misuse of the medal, including unauthorized manufacture or wear, is punishable by a fine up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to one year pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 704(b). After the Army redesigned its medal in 1903, a patent was issued (United States Patent #D37,236) to legally prevent others from making the medal. When the patent expired, the Federal government enacted a law making it illegal to produce, wear, or distribute the Medal of Honor without proper authority. A number of veterans' organizations and private companies devote themselves to exposing those who falsely claim to have received the Medal of Honor.[45]\n\n[edit] Enforcement\n\nHLI Lordship Industries Inc., a former Medal of Honor contractor, was fined in 1996 for selling 300 fake medals for US$75 each.[46]\n\nAlso that year, Fort Lauderdale, Florida resident Jackie Stern was convicted of wearing a medal to which he was not entitled; instead of six months in jail, a federal judge sentenced him to serve one year's probation and to write a letter of apology to each of the then-living 171 actual recipients of the medal; the letter was also published in the local newspaper.[47]\n\nIn 2003, Edward Fedora and Gisela Fedora were charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 704(b), Unlawful Sale of a Medal of Honor, for selling medals awarded to U.S. Navy Seaman Robert Blume (for action in the Spanish-American War) and to U.S. Army First Sergeant George Washington Roosevelt (for action in the Civil War) to an FBI agent.[48] Edward Fedora, a Canadian businessman,[49] pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison;[50] Gisela Fedora's status is unknown.\n\n---\n\nthat one law about not making fakes is probably why we didn't see what sam gave him. and NCIS probably had to get special permission to have a character wear it"
