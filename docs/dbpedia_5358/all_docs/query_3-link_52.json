        "text": "On December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy led a surprise military strike against the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The following day, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared war against Japan, thus thrusting the United States fully into World War II.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, thousands of American men enlisted in the various branches of the armed forces to help their country in the fight against the Axis Powers. Many of these were established Hollywood stars, others became recognizable movie stars in the post-war period. Here are five male actors who served in World War II before they were famous.\n\n1. Paul Newman (1925-2008)\n\nAfter graduating from high school in June 1943, Newman volunteered for the U.S. Navy Air Corps and enrolled in the V-12 pilot training programme at Yale University. When his colourblindess was discovered, he was sent to a traditional boot camp in Newport, Rhode Island, and received training as a rear-seat radioman and gunner in torpedo bombers. Qualifying as an aviation radioman third class in 1944, Newman was shipped out to Barbers Point, Hawaii, and assigned to a series of torpedo squadrons based in the Pacific. He and his crewmates were responsible mainly for training replacement pilots and air crewmen in a variety of skills, including carrier landings. The various units in which he served were stationed at different locations throughout the war: Eniwetok, Guam, Okinawa, and finally Saipan, where he arrived in January 1945 and would remain until the Japanese surrender in September of that year.\n\nLEFT: Paul Newman in his Navy uniform. RIGHT: Aerial view of Ewa Field (near) and Barbers Point Naval Air Station (beyond) in Hawaii (January 20, 1943).\n\nShortly before the Battle of Okinawa in the spring of 1945, Newman was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Bunker Hill as a radioman-gunner in an Avenger torpedo bomber. The pilot of his aircraft developed an ear infection and was grounded, as were Newman and his other crewmates. The rest of their squadron flew to the Bunker Hill to carry out their mission. On May 11, the vessel was struck and severely damaged by two Japanese kamikaze planes, which resulted in the death of several hundred crewmen and airmen, including members of Newman's unit. When his squadron broke up, Newman was assigned to a Carrier Aircraft Service Unit operating out of Seattle, Washington, and was honorably discharged in January 1946.\n\nUSS Bunker Hill burning after being struck by kamikaze planes (May 11, 1945).\n\n2. Charles Durning (1923-2012)\n\nDurning enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1943 and received basic training at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, and later at Fort Polk, Louisiana. Promoted to Private First Class, he was shipped out to England in February 1944 to prepare for the Allied invasion of Normandy. Initially assigned to the 386th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, Durning was transferred to the 17th Replacement Depot and landed at Omaha Beach after D-Day. On June 15, 1944, he was hit by shrapnel from a land mine set off by long range German artillery and suffered a concussion, multiple lacerations to the face and wounds to his head, chest, legs, left foot, hands and fingers. In December, after six months of recovery, he was declared «physically fit for full field duty.»\n\nLEFT: Charles Durning in Europe during the war. RIGHT: Troops from the 1st Infantry Division landing on Omaha Beach during Operation Overlord (June 6, 1944).\n\nFollowing his release from the hospital, Durning was transferred to the 10th Replacement Control Depot and was later placed on temporary duty with the 159th Infantry Regiment, which was sent to the front lines to reinforce the regiments in the 106th Infantry Division that were decimated in the Battle of the Bulge. After V-E Day, he was reassigned to the 398th Infantry Regiment, 100th Infantry Division, and engaged in occupational duties until his discharge in January 1946.\n\nAmerican soldiers in the snow-covered Ardennes Forest during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\n3. Art Carney (1918-2003)\n\nCarney enlisted in the United States Army in December 1943 and was assigned as a Private to the 28th Infantry Division. He landed at Normandy in July 1944, seven weeks after D-Day, and took part in Operation Cobra, an Allied offensive launched by the U.S. First Army under Lieutenant General Omar Bradley to break through German defenses around Saint-Lô, France.\n\nIn August 1944, while manning a machine gun, Carney was hit by shrapnel from a German mortar shell, which severely wounded him in his right leg. After receiving field treatment, he was taken to an Army hospital in England and, nine months later, was shipped back to America. As a result of his injury, he walked with a limp for the rest of his life. He was honorably discharged in 1945.\n\nLEFT: Portrait of Art Carney in 1953.

Charlton Heston (1923-2008)\n\nHeston enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces in 1944 and received training as a radio operator and gunner abroad B-25 Mitchell bombers. Assigned to the 77th Bombardment Squadron of the Eleventh Air Force, he was sent to the Alaskan Aleutian Islands to join in the fight against the Japanese invaders. He flew several combat missions over the Kuril Islands of northern Japan, most of the time under extreme weather conditions.\n\nLEFT: Charlton Heston at his apartment in New York in 1950. RIGHT: A B-25 Mitchell bomber of the 77th Bombardment Squadron serving in the Aleutian Campaign.\n\nOne day in 1945, as the Americans were planning for a possible invasion of Japan from the Aleutians, an aircraft returning from a mission got caught in a crosswind and crashed onto the island where Heston was stationed. As he and others ran to help get the pilots out of their cockpits, he slipped on a patch of ice and was run over by an ambulance. He was then sent to Elmerdorf Field in nearby Anchorage, Alaska, and after he recovered, he was assigned to the base control tower. He was discharged as a Staff Sergeant in March 1946.\n\nLEFT: American troops unloading supplies for the Aleutian Islands Campaign (1943).

James Arness (1923-2011)\n\nArness was drafted into the U.S. Army in March 1943 and received basic training at Camp Butner, North Carolina. Assigned as a rifleman with the 2nd Platoon, E Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division, Arness was in the first wave of troops that landed at Anzio Beachead in January 1944 to take part in Operation Shingle, the Allied invasion of Italy. Due to his height (he was 6'7''/2.01 m), he was the first man to be ordered off his landing craft to determine the depth of the water; it came up to this waist.\n\nLEFT: James Arness in his U.S. Army uniform.

A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime.

Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway. Let me know how many from these you have seen. As always, films marked with a heart ( ❤ ) are my favorites.

Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958).

I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me. Yesterday I posted part one ; her\n\nChristmas has always been a source of inspiration to many artists and writers. Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra in Anchors Aweigh Being a contract player at the studio that boasted «more stars than there are in the heavens» gave Frank a sudden perspective regarding his own talents as a film performer.
