        "text": "\"There are many secrets in us, in the depths of our souls, that we don't want anyone to know about…There's terror and repulsion in us, the terrible spot that we don't talk about. That place that no one knows about — horrifying things we keep secret. A lot of that is released through acting.\"\n\n(\n\nCharles Durning\n\nin\n\nParade Magazine\n\n, 1993)\n\nCharles Durning drew from his secrets to perform superbly, with passion and compelling purpose, in roles that seem to have been made just for him, or, certainly, that he made his own. The secrets that he hid, and only in his later life, willingly disclosed, came from his horrific experiences in childhood and extended through his harrowing and heroic service in World War II, and in the years in between and beyond.\n\nHe could play \"gruff and combative or gentle and funny\" as Robert Berkvist, in his masterful obituary, \"Prolific Character Actor (From Nazi to Priest),\" recounts. Berkvist recalls that Times reviewer Frank Rich likened Durning's \"Big Daddy\" in \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" to \"a dying volcano, in final, sputtering eruption.\"\n\nThis uniquely talented, deeply wounded man came from unimaginable poverty, one of ten children, five of whom died of smallpox or scarlet fever in childhood, three of them within two weeks of each other. His father, a veteran of World War I, where he was sickened by mustard gas and lost a leg, died when Charles was 16.\n\nHe left home to spare his mother, a laundress, “the cost” of his presence, working in various menial jobs, and, over the course of his life, as a doorman, a dishwasher and a cabdriver. While he boxed professionally for a time, he also delivered telegrams and taught ballroom dancing.\n\nIt was as a substitute comedian in a burlesque house, though, that he found he was hooked on the theater; he commanded bit parts until receiving solid roles thanks to Joseph Papp, founder of the Public Theater and the New York Shakespeare Festival. (Durning had been rejected as a non-starter, by the way, by the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, which, in an ironic twist, later created a scholarship in his name.)\n\nBut before New York, came World War II. Durning enlisted in the Army. From Berkvist's moving account:\n\n\"His combat experiences were harrowing. He was in the first wave of troops to land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and his unit's lone survivor of a machine-gun ambush. In Belgium he was stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a German soldier, whom he bludgeoned to death with a rock. Fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, he and the rest of his company were captured and forced to march through a pine forest at Malmedy, the scene of an infamous massacre in which the Germans opened fire on almost 90 prisoners. Mr. Durning was among the few to escape.\n\n\"By the war's end he had been awarded a Silver Star for valor and three Purple Hearts, having suffered gunshot and shrapnel wounds as well. He spent months in hospitals and was treated for psychological trauma.\"\n\nIt took more than a decade following his military service for him to find his footing in the theater, and in movies. He is credited with 200 roles and he continued to act almost until his death. As Berkvist notes, \"Scavenger Killers,\" a crime thriller in which he stars with Eric Roberts and Robert Loggia, is scheduled to open next year.\n\nBut watch him and listen to him at this Memorial Day ceremony in Washington, D.C., in 2008. And, as Berkvist does, end your reading of this blog, with Durning's account of hand-to-hand combat (Parade interview in 1993):\n\n\"I was crossing a field somewhere in Belgium. A German soldier ran toward me carrying a bayonet. He couldn't have been more than 14 or 15. I didn't see a soldier. I saw a boy. Even though he was coming at me, I couldn't shoot.\"\n\n'They grappled,' Berkvist says that Durning recounted later — 'he was stabbed seven or eight times — until finally he grasped a rock and made it a weapon. After killing the youth, he said, he held him in his arms and wept.'\n\nWe weep, too, for the loss of this good man, even as we are grateful for the gift of his life. As troubled, as fraught, as emotionally shattered as it was, he drew from that life to render performances of uncommon depth and quality. He made the ordinary, noble.\n\nDurning, the actor--as the crooked cop, small town mayor, slippery governor, Nazi colonel, priest, fire-fighter, hostage-negotiator, good neighbor, mailman, prosecutor, suicidal industrialist, nursing home resident, police chief, kindly father, former president of the United States--received widespread acclaim and garnered many, many awards.\n\nWe know what it took to do all that, even though we can barely imagine it, but we can be profoundly grateful for his acting, for what it released for him, and for the privilege of being his witnesses."
