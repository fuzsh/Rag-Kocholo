        "text": "​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nUSAAF photograph of Clark Gable at his battle station on a B-17 Flying Flying Fortress\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMany would agree that America today is not what it was sixty years ago. Today, drugs and depraved behavior seems to be symbolic of Hollywood, which radiates to other media venues. At one time there was a Hollywood that minded their manners or were at least, discreet with their shenanigans.\n\nMy generation grew up watching, being entertained by and laughing with so many of these fine people, never really knowing what they contributed to the war effort. Like millions of Americans during that era, there was a job that needed doing they didn’t question, they went and did it, those that came home returned to their now new normal life and carried on, very few ever saying what they did or saw.\n\nThey took it as their “responsibility”, their “duty” to their country, to protect and preserve our freedoms and way of life, not just for themselves but for all future generations to come. Below are just some of well-known actors from yesteryear who stepped up to serve their country.\n\n​\n\nAs much of my audience know, I do meticulous research for my books. While researching for the book: The Other Side Of Courage, these interesting facts about the original Hollywood came to light.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThis list includes some actors who suspended their careers to serve in the United States Armed Forces after America was attacked on December 7, 1941 … Scroll through and see how many you recognize.\n\nBest viewed on a computer or laptop\n\n​\n\nJimmy Stewart, US Army Air Corps. He flew 20 missions as a B-24 pilot, in Europe and remained in uniform as a reservist, retiring a Brigadier General.\n\nDuring the Cold War, he was a pilot for a B-47 Stratofortress squadron in SAC. To the right is a frame from: It’s A Wonderful Life. Another notable film is Flight Of The Phoenix.\n\nIn 2012, Vertigo was ranked in critics poll for one of the greatest films ever made.\n\n​\n\nClark Gable from ‘Gone With The Wind,’ fame and coined the King of Hollywood joined the US Army Air Corps as a B-17 gunner over Europe. Gable spent most of 1943 with the 351st Bomb Group.\n\nHe flew on five combat missions - including one to Germany - between May 4 and September 23, 1943, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. Gable's aircraft was damaged by flak and attacked by fighters, which knocked out one of the engines and shot up the stabilizer.\n\nIn the raid on Germany, one crewman was killed while two others were wounded, and flak went through Gable's boot, injuring his foot while narrowly missing his head.\n\nWhen word of this reached MGM, studio executives began to badger the Army Air Forces to reassign its most valuable screen actor as a NON-combatant.\n\nHe was sent to USAAF OCS Class 42-E on August 17, 1942 and commissioned as a lieutenant. Clark Gable's new noncombatant assignment: to make films in \"combat.\"\n\nDeForrest Kelley film career actually began because he joined the U.S. Army Air Force. From March 10, 1943 to January 28, 1946, he was assigned to the 1st Motion Picture Unit.\n\nKelley was spotted by a Paramount Pictures scout while doing a Navy training film. After the war, he decided to pursue an acting career and relocated to southern California permanently, living for a time with his uncle Casey.\n\nKelley's mother encouraged her son in his pursuit, but his father disliked the idea. Of course, DeForrest Kelley is better known as\n\nDr. Leonard (Bones) McCoy of the original Star Trek series and following feature films.\n\nHenry Fonda, famous for films like: the 1940's film: The Grapes of Wrath, enlisted in the United States Navy to fight in World War II.\n\nFonda served for three years, initially as a Quartermaster 3rd Class on the destroyer USS Satterlee. He was later commissioned as a Lieutenant Junior Grade in Air Combat Intelligence in the Central Pacific and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.\n\nRight: Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart and Henry Fonda in The Petrified Forest.\n\nJames Arness was drafted into the US Army and reported to Fort Snelling, Minnesota in March 1943. As a rifleman, he landed on Anzio Beachhead on January 22, 1944, with the 3rd Infantry Division. Arness - due to his height: 6'7\" was the first man positioned off his landing craft to determine the depth of the water; it came up to his waist. Arness was seriously wounded in his right leg during the Battle of Anzio.\n\nArness was sent to the U.S Army 91st General Hospital in Clinton, Iowa, to be treated for his wounds. After undergoing several surgeries, he was honorably discharged on January 29, 1945. However, his wounds continued to bother him throughout the rest of his life; in later years he had to cope with chronic leg pain that often became acute, such as when he mounted horses during his performance on Gunsmoke.
