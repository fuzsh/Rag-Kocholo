        "text": "I was struck by this passage in today's New York Times obit for actor Charles Durning, 89, who died Christmas Eve:\n\n----\n\n...Then came World War II, and he enlisted in the Army [rifleman with the 398th Infantry Regiment, later with the 3rd Army Support troops and the 386th Anti-aircraft Artillery (AAA) Battalion]. His combat experiences were harrowing. He was in the first wave of troops to land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and his unit’s lone survivor of a machine-gun ambush.\n\nIn Belgium he was stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a German soldier, whom he bludgeoned to death with a rock. Fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, he and the rest of his company were captured and forced to march through a pine forest at Malmedy, the scene of an infamous massacre in which the Germans opened fire on almost 90 prisoners. Mr. Durning was among the few [only three, according to other sources] to escape.\n\nBy the war’s end he had been awarded a Silver Star for valor and three Purple Hearts, having suffered gunshot and shrapnel wounds as well. He spent months in hospitals and was treated for psychological trauma...\n\n...Mr. Durning was also remembered for his combat service, which he avoided discussing publicly until later in life. He spoke at memorial ceremonies in Washington, and in 2008 France awarded him the National Order of the Legion of Honor.\n\nIn the Parade interview, he recalled the hand-to-hand combat. “I was crossing a field somewhere in Belgium,” he said. “A German soldier ran toward me carrying a bayonet. He couldn’t have been more than 14 or 15. I didn’t see a soldier. I saw a boy. Even though he was coming at me, I couldn’t shoot.”\n\nThey grappled, he recounted later — he was stabbed seven or eight times — until finally he grasped a rock and made it a weapon. After killing the youth, he said, he held him in his arms and wept.\n\nMr. Durning said the memories never left him, even when performing, even when he became, however briefly, someone else.\n\n“There are many secrets in us, in the depths of our souls, that we don’t want anyone to know about,” he told Parade. “There’s terror and repulsion in us, the terrible spot that we don’t talk about. That place that no one knows about — horrifying things we keep secret. A lot of that is released through acting.”\n\n----\n\nCM is just a game, but part of me always tries to be mindful of what the characters and actions I'm seeing on the screen represent. I think one reason for my enduring fascination with WWII is sheer amazement at what some of these men went through, and wanting to better understand it.\n\nAlso, it amazes and fascinates me to that so many of these seemingly bland, conformist, everyday Dad types I saw and knew as a suburban American kid of the '60s were carrying incredible, unspeakable secrets around with them. Even if I had known, for example, about my high school principal's valor when he parachuted into predawn Sicily, I most likely wouldn't have properly appreciated it then (since he was angrily suspending students at the time for a Vietnam walkout protest).\n\nDurning was one of my favorite character actors in the 70s-90s. He should have won an Oscar for his turn as an NYPD Lieutenant in Dog Day Afternoon. Incandescent performance!\n\nThe article you're quoting got things a little skewed, though. He was in the 398th Infantry (100th Division) apparently after he returned to duty from his wound. (I don't think the 100th went into the line before or during the Bulge, but I could have that wrong). It's not clear from what I've read whether he was in the 1st Div at Omaha or in the Rangers, but I do recall that he or another announcer stated he hit the beach there in the Normady Special from about 10 years ago that he narrated.\n\nHe wasn't one of the 3 survivors at the Malmedy Massacre (not listed as one of the survivors nor called to testify at the war crimes trial--one of the most researched and documented German war crimes against Americans) but rather was most likely one of the many captured around there and in the Bulge generally.\n\nThis Internet story is like the one about Lee Marvin getting wounded at Iwo Jima and that his squad leader/platoon sergeant was Captain Kangaroo, Bob Keeshan, which is total BS. He was wounded at Saipan, and Keeshan wasn't his sergeant or in his outfit even. Why the Internets have to embellish someone's honorable, valorous WWII achievements is beyond me. The truth about Marvin, Durning and others is stellar as is.\n\nPeace be with all those now-fallen heroes!\n\nThere are two WW2 veterans (one commando, one sailor) who still appear at my local pub a couple of afternoons a week. They don't talk about the war - apart from once when the ex-commando got chatting about D-Day (cutting comms and then a lookout half a mile from Pegasus Bridge) and then told me about his first kill (of a German sentry in Norway) when aged 19 and on his first raid. He said the nightmares affected him for decades. He was in tears by the time he finished, and since that chat 2yrs ago he won't talk about any of it any more.\n\nMy granddad would never (ever) talk about the war - he lost too many close family and friends at the front or in the blitz, according to my mum.\n\nBut just a counter-note to some of the themes earlier in this thread:\n\n1) Monty was not too hesitant in Normandy - his plan was to take Paris by D+90, and he managed it a few days early. Caen on D+1 was an over-optimistic idea pushed by overall air and sea plans (Monty was the overall land-forces commander) and the initial Caen attack was poorly executed by junior commanders. And Eisenhower took direct command from Monty just as the outskirts of Paris was reached, and took all of Monty's glory. Monty's Normandy campaign was not without mistakes but today he is only mentioned with regard to not taking Caen on day one whilst Eisenhower took all the credit for Monty's overall success.\n\n2) Not that I doubt those returning GI's worked extremely hard and were all great guys, but the US economy in the 1950s-60s benefitted mainly from the way the US government had managed the war, being the only major power to make a profit during the war and the way they forced the British Empire over a barrel to give up all of its cash and gold reserves (1939-1942) to pay for all that \"aid\" (as US histories put it). Then from 1942-1945 the US forced Britian to permanently give up most of it's Empire's trade protections in return for Lend-Lease. Thus after the war, most returning British servicemen worked hard, but the British government was bankrupt, and times remained hard. Rationing in Britain didn't end until 1954. And Austerity lasted even longer. And recovery from the Blitz was slow - when I was kid in the late 1960s, there was still one local bomb site (it got redeveloped in the 1970s). And after the war (1946), while the US reaped all those profits from the cash and taking most of Britain's trade away, Britain had to go cap-in-hand to the US for a loan just to stop those poor British soldiers returning to their factories from revolting - a loan which Britain finally paid off (many times over, due to the fixed format and all the interest) in 2006.\n\nI could go on about late-war and post-war US policy in Sicily, eastern Europe, China, south Asia, and Central and South America, to either protect that American profit margin or later to preserve US hegemony. But the point is this: by all means remember and honour the fallen, but don't append any benefits or \"big up\" the US war generation with benefits that actually came via their government's machiavellianism and your own rose-tinted lenses."
