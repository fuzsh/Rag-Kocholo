        "text": "On June 6, 1944, Allied forces stormed Omaha Beach in the Normandy Invasion, known as D-Day.\n\nA few of those soldiers were established actors or later pursued a career in Hollywood. Here are a few of those men that served in D-Day:\n\nDavid Niven: The British actor was a Lt. Colonel of the British Commandos. He also worked in the intelligence branch and was later assigned to the U.S. First Infantry.\n\nNiven was one of the first officers to land at Normandy. He later was one of 25 British soldiers to be awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit Medal, according to a 1983 book by Don McCombs and Fred Worth.\n\nRichard Todd: Capt. Todd was one of the first British officers to land on D-Day. Todd was part of the British airborne invasion, that took place June 5 through June 7. During Operation Overlord, Todd’s battalion were the reinforcements parachuted in after the gliders landed and captured Pegasus Bridge to prevent German forces crossing the bridge and attacking.\n\nTodd’s battalion was led by Major John Howard, who Todd played in “The Longest Day”(1962). The beret that Todd wears in the film is the one he wore on D-Day. Producer of THE LONGEST DAY, Darryl F. Zanuck, wanted Todd to appear in the film since he actually took part in the D-Day invasion, further adding realism to the documentary-like film.\n\nRobert Montgomery: American actor Montgomery enlisted in World War II before the United States entered the war.\n\nMontgomery became a PT boat Lt. Commander and was part of the D-Day invasion on board the destroyer, USS Barton (DD-722).\n\nAfter serving five years of active duty, Montgomery was awarded a Bronze Star, the Good Conduct Medal, the American Defense Service Ribbon, the European Theater Ribbon with two Battle Stars, one Overseas Service Bar, and promoted to the rank of Lt. Commander. (1904-1981)\n\nCharles Durning: American actor Durning served in the United States Army. He was in one of the first waves to land on Omaha Beach during the D-Day invasion. Durning was the only soldier in his company to survive, according to KPBS broadcasting.\n\nDurning was wounded nine days after the landing and earned a Purple Heart. Durning was also awarded the Silver Star.\n\nJames Doohan: Canadian actor Doohan served in the Canadian Army. Doohan was in the Juno Beach invasion on D-Day. During the invasion, Doohan was shot in the leg, chest and lost his right middle finger.\n\nWriter’s note: This post was edited in June 2023 to remove Alec Guinness, as it was noted this was not accurate. In addition, there are several actors who are mentioned as being there during D-Day, but this is also inaccurate. For example, Henry Fonda is mentioned in several articles. While Fonda appeared in the film D-Day film, THE LONGEST DAY and also served during World War II, he did not take part in the Allied Invasion. In June 1944, Fonda was on the USS Curtiss, which was at the Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific. Art Linkletter also was not at D-Day."
