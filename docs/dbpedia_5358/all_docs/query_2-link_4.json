        "text": "There are many secrets in us, in the depths of our souls, that we don’t want anyone to know about…There’s terror and repulsion in us, the terrible spot that we don’t talk about. That place that no one knows about — horrifying things we keep secret. A lot of that is released through acting. — Charles Durning, Parade Magazine, 1993\n\nBy Linda Stamato\n\nAs Memorial Day approaches, we summon up memories about who died, who lived, and who returned with memories to haunt their lives.\n\nWith parades and ceremonies and visits to graves and monuments, we celebrate those who were on the front lines for the nation. I think a lot, now, about one particular soldier, Charles Durning.\n\nHe was an actor in service to his nation.\n\nDurning enlisted in the Army during World War II. In Robert Berkvist’s moving obituary for the New York Times, he recalls Durning’s harrowing combat experiences:\n\nHe was in the first wave of troops to land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and his unit’s lone survivor of a machine-gun ambush. In Belgium he was stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a German soldier, whom he bludgeoned to death with a rock. Fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, he and the rest of his company were captured and forced to march through a pine forest at Malmedy, the scene of an infamous massacre in which the Germans opened fire on almost 90 prisoners. Mr. Durning was among the few to escape.\n\nBy the war’s end he had been awarded a Silver Star for valor and three Purple Hearts, having suffered gunshot and shrapnel wounds as well. He spent months in hospitals and was treated for psychological trauma.\n\nIt took more than a decade following his military service for him to find his footing in the theater, and in movies. He is credited with 200 roles and he continued to act almost until his death on Christmas Eve 2012.\n\nIn this video clip, introduced by Tom Hanks at a Memorial Day ceremony in Washington in 2008, Durning remembers being a 21-year-old infantryman on Omaha Beach:\n\nDurning described hand-to-hand combat in his 1993 Parade interview.\n\n“I was crossing a field somewhere in Belgium. A German soldier ran toward me carrying a bayonet. He couldn’t have been more than 14 or 15. I didn’t see a soldier. I saw a boy. Even though he was coming at me, I couldn’t shoot.”\n\nDurning was stabbed seven or eight times, according to the Times obituary, “until finally he grasped a rock and made it a weapon. After killing the youth, he said, he held him in his arms and wept.”\n\nAs emotionally shattered as Durning’s life was, he drew from it to render performances of uncommon depth and quality. He made nobility of the ordinary.\n\nAs the crooked cop, small town mayor, slippery governor, Nazi colonel, priest, firefighter, hostage negotiator, good neighbor, mailman, prosecutor, suicidal industrialist, nursing home resident, police chief, kindly father, and former president of the United States, Durning received widespread acclaim and garnered many awards.\n\nWe now know what it took to do all that, even though we can barely imagine it.\n\nWhat a privilege to be Durning’s witness, and to acknowledge, with profound gratitude, his service, the service of all who never came home…and the service of those whose lives have been haunted by horrifying things they have kept secret."
