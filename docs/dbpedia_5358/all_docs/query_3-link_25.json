        "text": "IT WAS A BITTER COLD MORNING, and a fitful wind howled through already cacophonous Hell's Kitchen. Crumpled paper and shreds of plastic skittered up and down the street. Business was drowsy at the Market Diner over on 11th Avenue. Three cops, in a no-nonsense mood, slid into the booth behind him. Charles Durning gave a quick look and said nothing. A couple of guys in raggedy clothes were eyeing him from the stools. One wore a lupine smile and was fishing for something in his pocket. Mr. Durning rubbed his chin. What was he going to do?\n\nHe was going to order an omelet. Rye toast. Black coffee.\n\nInconceivable as it seems, not every scene in the actor Charles Durning's life is for the purpose of entertaining an audience. Sometimes he is simply eating. Sometimes he is simply being Charles Durning.\n\nIt is easy to believe that he never has time for that. Extolled as the king of character actors, Mr. Durning has by his tabulation performed in more than 200 plays, 60 movies and a preposterous number of television shows. Restless as an alley cat, he begrudges every idle moment. The only vacation he will consider is a part in ''National Lampoon's Summer Vacation III.''\n\nHe looks the way he always has, like the corner butcher, the gas man, the fellow who demonstrates vacuums. But he can play anybody. He has been a detective, an affectionate father, the mayor of a small town, a clown, a Mafia don, a plantation owner, a comic Nazi, a governor, a former pimp, a monsignor, a drug dealer, a cranky old man, the President, and Pope John XXIII.\n\n''There was never a picture built around me,'' he said of his character-actor lot. ''Every time I thought it was built around me, the leading lady had that part. Steve McQueen told me once, 'You're going to break through.' That was 20 years ago. I'm not saying that bitterly. I'm not bitter. I've had a great career. I have plenty of work.''\n\nHe won a Tony Award in 1990 for his performance as Big Daddy on Broadway in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' and his habit has been to do at least one play a year somewhere. Now he is in town to co-star with Julie Harris in the National Actors Theater revival of ''The Gin Game,'' directed by Charles Nelson Reilly and opening tonight at the Lyceum Theater on Broadway. The two-character play by D. L. Coburn, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1978, dwells on a pair of lonely yet combative inhabitants of a seedy retirement home and their collision of wills over lopsided hands of gin rummy.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
