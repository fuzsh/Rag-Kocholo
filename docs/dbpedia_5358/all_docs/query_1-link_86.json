        "text": "By Russell Smith\n\nrussellsrant.com\n\nI had the privilege of meeting Charles Durning several times. He was active in a charity, “The Friendly Sons of Saint Patrick.” I attended their annual dinner in Los Angeles at the Beverly Hilton Hotel a few times at the invitation of life member Ronald B. Flynn. Mr. Durning could be found surrounded by military personnel anxious to meet the legendary hero. The last time I spoke with him, in 2007, he said he enjoyed speaking with military personnel because “You guys want to know about my military time and you aren’t kissing my (expletive deleted) hoping I will read a script. It is a nice change.”\n\nHis good friend Burt Reynolds, declared that “The only actor more decorated than Charles was Audie Murphy.” We checked. Mr. Reynolds is correct.\n\nMr. Durning served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Drafted at age 21, he jumped in to the Normandy Invasion of France on D-Day, June 6, 1944, and was among the first troops to land at Omaha Beach. He was in a group of gliders who overshot their landing zone and had to fight alone back to the beach.\n\nMr. Durning was wounded by a German “S” Mine on June 15, 1944 at La Mare des Mares, Normandy. He was returned to duty on December 6, 1944 in time to take part in the Battle of the Bulge where he was captured by the Germans, narrowly escaped and was one of the few survivors of the infamous Malmedy Massacre. Later he was wounded again, this time in the chest and the Army returned him to the United States. He remained in Army hospitals until being discharged with the rank of Private First Class on January 30, 1946.\n\nHis ninth Emmy Award nomination came for his brilliant portrayal of a Marine veteran and Medal of Honor recipient in “Call of Silence,” an episode of the television series NCIS. Drawing on his personal experience with PTSD, Mr. Durning’s character turns himself in to authorities, insisting that he must be prosecuted for having murdered his buddy during ferocious combat on Iwo Jima six decades earlier. The real truth becomes known for certain when the veteran goes through a cathartic reliving of the battlefield events.\n\nMr. Durning also received two Oscar nominations, a Golden Globe Award, the screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, and he was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nDurning’s military awards and decorations include the Silver Star, Bronze Star, three Purple Heart Medals, Prisoner of War Medal with one Service Star, World War II Victory Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, American Campaign Medal, American Defense Service Medal, Parachutist Badge, Combat Infantry Badge, Ranger Tab and the French National Order of the Legion of Honor.\n\nHe was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors."
