        "text": "As Memorial Day approaches, we summon up our memories, many of them very different depending upon where we spent the years our nation was at war and where those we know and cherish were during those years and we think about who lived, who died, and about those who returned with obvious and less obvious injuries and memories to last, to haunt, for a lifetime.\n\nWe have parades and ceremonies and visits to graves and memorials, and we pause on this day to celebrate the lives of those who were, let me put it this way, on the front lines for the nation. I think a lot, now, about Charles Durning and what he experienced, what he stood for, why it mattered, and what he did with his life as a result. He was an actor in service to his nation.\n\nDurning enlisted in the Army during World War II. In Robert Berkvist's moving account in his obituary for the New York Times, he recalls that Durning's:\n\n\"...combat experiences were harrowing. He was in the first wave of troops to land on Omaha Beach on D-Day and his unit's lone survivor of a machine-gun ambush. In Belgium he was stabbed in hand-to-hand combat with a German soldier, whom he bludgeoned to death with a rock. Fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, he and the rest of his company were captured and forced to march through a pine forest at Malmedy, the scene of an infamous massacre in which the Germans opened fire on almost 90 prisoners. Mr. Durning was among the few to escape.\n\n\"By the war's end he had been awarded a Silver Star for valor and three Purple Hearts, having suffered gunshot and shrapnel wounds as well. He spent months in hospitals and was treated for psychological trauma.\"\n\nIt took more than a decade following his military service for him to find his footing in the theater, and in movies. He is credited with 200 roles and he continued to act almost until his death last year, in December.\n\nBut watch him and listen to him in this video clip introduced by Tom Hanks at a Memorial Day ceremony in Washington, D.C., in 2008. He recounts how he, a 21-year-old infantryman, was among the first wave of men to land on Omaha Beach. And, as Berkvist does, end your reading of this blog, with Durning's account of hand-to-hand combat (Parade interview in 1993):\n\n\"I was crossing a field somewhere in Belgium. A German soldier ran toward me carrying a bayonet. He couldn't have been more than 14 or 15. I didn't see a soldier. I saw a boy. Even though he was coming at me, I couldn't shoot.\"\n\n'They grappled,' Berkvist says that Durning recounted later — 'he was stabbed seven or eight times — until finally he grasped a rock and made it a weapon. After killing the youth, he said, he held him in his arms and wept.'\n\nAs troubled, as fraught, as emotionally shattered as Durning’s life was, he drew from it to render performances of uncommon depth and quality. He made the ordinary, noble.\n\nAs the crooked cop, small town mayor, slippery governor, Nazi colonel, priest, fire-fighter, hostage-negotiator, good neighbor, mailman, prosecutor, suicidal industrialist, nursing home resident, police chief, kindly father, and, former president of the United States, Durning received widespread acclaim and garnered many, many awards.\n\nWe know what it took to do all that, even though we can barely imagine it; we can be profoundly grateful for his acting, for what it released for him, and for the privilege of being Durning's witnesses and, in profound gratitude, acknowledge his service to the nation."
