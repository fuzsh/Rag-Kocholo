The show connects the historical dots between the Civil Rights Movement, the colonization of African countries and today’s often troubling political landscape. The Langston Hughes Project (LHP) has been performed in 40 states and Mexico City, on many college campuses (including our own), and in venues ranging from a 20-person capacity to Carnegie Hall.

What does Critical Race Theory have to do with Academic Medicine? A Primer

Moderator:

John Paul Sánchez MD, MPH (He, Him, El)

Executive Associate Vice Chancellor

Professor with Tenure & Vice Chair DEI, Emergency Medicine

University of New Mexico School of Medicine (UNM SOM)

Speaker(s):

Anita Fernander, PhD

Executive Diversity Officer/Professor

University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center School of Medicine

Learning Objectives:

Extinguish myths & misunderstandings about Critical Race Theory;

Distinguish between the historical underpinnings of “race” as a social/political/economic classification as opposed to “race as biology”;

Apply CRT to historical & contemporary racialized political & social determinants of health to contextualize health inequities among African Americans; and

Charge academic medicine with a duty to reckon with the “ugly side” of medicine.

Workshop Description:

Critical Race Theory (CRT) has recently become a target of national attention due to recent Presidential Executive Orders and state and local governmental bodies banning its use in public school settings. However, such attention has only led to critical race theory being misconstrued by the media and misunderstood by the common lay person. Critical Race Theory is a specific pedagogical and theoretical approach to understand how racialized historical contexts influence contemporary society. Clarifying and positioning CRT in a manner within which to understand health inequities experienced by racialized groups in the United States is paramount in order to address the social mission of health professions education, faculty development, and clinical practice. A critical examination of the historical and contemporary issues of race and racism in America provides the necessary context within which to understand the long-standing and persistent existence of health disparities experienced among racial/ethnic populations in the United States. The session will rely on the presenter’s two decades of teaching in academic medicine on the history of medicine among African Americans and provide a primer within which to understand the historical and contemporary political and social influences of race and racism on health. Health professions training institutions have a professional and ethical responsibility to educate its trainees and health professionals on the history of medicine – including its ugly side – and to critically examine how historical and contemporary political and social factors have created racial/ethnic health disparities. Until such reckoning occurs the field of medicine’s ability to achieve health equity for all will continue to be futile.

(Un)Natural Histories: How Medicine, Science, And Art Construct The Pathological Body

February 11

11:00 AM MST

Speaker:

Kirsten Pai Buick, Ph.D.

Professor of Art History, UNM

About Kirsten Pai Buick, Ph.D.

Kirsten Pai Buick is a professor of art history at the University of New Mexico since 2001. Her teaching and scholarship focus on the material and visual culture of the first British Empire, art of the U.S., African American art, landscape representation, histories of medicine and science as they impact visual culture, and pro- and anti-abolitionist images in the Atlantic world. She received the David C. Driskell Prize for Child of the Fire: Mary Edmonia Lewis and the Problem of Art History's Black and Indian Subject (Duke Univ. Press, 2010). Her second book, In Authenticity: "Kara Walker" and the Eidetics of Racism, is in progress.

Science and medicine aren't merely practices. Like art, they also represent the body and create standards and criteria that police the boundaries between the healthy and the sick; the sacred and profane; the beautiful and the ugly; the normal and abnormal, etc. This talk will explore what art historian Kirk Savage so eloquently noted: that there is a scientific dimension to aesthetics, and an aesthetic dimension to science [and medicine].

Are you getting the vaccine? A Community Discussion

February 11

7:00 – 8:30 PM MST

New Mexico is rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine to the public and there has been no coordinated effort to educate or engage the Black community around getting vaccinated. There is a history of distrust in the Black community around mass vaccinations and healthcare as a whole. In a recent Healthline article, Titled Why Some Black and Latinx People Are Reluctant to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine it was highlighted that “experts say we need to work directly with community leaders and amplify the voices of people of color to ease fears, build trust, and disseminate proper information about the vaccines.” We are doing just that. Join us on FB or YouTube as we have a REAL conversation about mass vaccinations and the Black community. Thank you to our sponsor NMDOH Equity Office for believing in our vision.

February 12

During this interactive presentation, we will celebrate the strength and resilience of this community and provide strategies to enhance wellness in the future.

Making “Practice”

February 19

3:00 PM – 4:00 PM MST

Hakim Bellamy

Deputy Director, Cultural Services Department - City of Albuquerque Inaugural Poet Laureate for the City of Albuquerque (2012-2014)

Creatives and medical professionals alike often call what they do “practice.” Sometimes that is a brick and mortar officespace...other times it is the everpresent but sometimes silent nature of the word “arts” that flanks the banner of our shared professions. Literary Arts. Medical Arts. Implied is the notion that what we do or create is unique to the circumstances of the moment. Unique to the patient. Unique to the diagnosis. Unique to the available medical science and pharmacology. However, when the social determinants of health create unfavorable odds for a patient like myself, born Black in America, poetry becomes practice for the things that ail us. I will spend time in this session sharing my reflections on poetry as interpretation (30 Americans Virtual Tour @ Albuquerque Museum) and instrument. We’ll also Q&A and I’ll share a new poem or two.

About Hakim Bellamy

Before being tapped by Mayor Keller to serve as the Deputy Director of the Cultural Services Department, Hakim Bellamy was the Inaugural Poet Laureate for the City of Albuquerque (2012-2014). Bellamy is a W. K. Kellogg Foundation Community Leadership Network Fellow, a Kennedy Center Citizen Artist Fellow, an Academy for the Love of Learning Leonard Bernstein Fellow, Western States Arts Alliance Launchpad Fellow, Santa Fe Arts Institute Food Justice Fellow, New Mexico Strategic Leadership Institute alum and soon to be Citizen University Civic Seminary Fellow (August 2020). In 2012 he published his first collection of poetry, SWEAR (West End Press/University of New Mexico Press), and it landed him the Working Class Studies Tillie Olsen Award forLiterature in 2012. With an M.A. in Communications from the University of New Mexico (UNM), Bellamy has held adjunctfaculty positions at UNM and the Institute of American Indian Arts. Bellamy has shared his work, in person, in atleast five countries and continues to use his art to change his communities. His latest book is We Are Neighbors (2019),a collaboration with photographer Justin Thor Simenson. www.beyondpoetryink.com
