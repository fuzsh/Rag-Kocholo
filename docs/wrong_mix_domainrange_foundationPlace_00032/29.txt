"My approach to all genres of singing is founded on the connection between vocal function and speech. My experience with voice and speech has informed how I assist in building technical ability and connecting my students to sounds and resonance they already possess. Singing is the organization and application of all sounds, and these modalities provide vocal access to singers and give them the confidence to explore a wide array of colors and tones. Developing a solid relationship with the speaking voice is essential in building a healthy singing voice."

"If you are my student, I want you to work with a solid functional foundation in your technique, artistic flexibility, and the tools needed to express your singular point of view. Your foundational understanding of your instrument comes firstâ€”we build tools and habits that will serve you long after our time together."

"When you understand the structure and function of your voice, you can demystify sound-making, and you have the foundation of knowledge to advocate for your instrument."
