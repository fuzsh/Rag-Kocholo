        "text": "Dustin & Mandy Woodward\n\nLead Pastors\n\nPastors Dustin and Mandy Woodward are the Lead Pastors of Citizen Church in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Growing up in the homes of Pastors, Dustin and Mandy got to experience first-hand what it takes to lead a church well. They are passionate about discipleship and seeing people come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ and their lives transformed. Prior to becoming Lead Pastor, Dustin established thriving Youth and Young Adult ministries at Citizen Church that are still flourishing today. Mandy has an extensive background in the worship and creative realms, overseeing the creative department for years while helping to create a growing Women’s Ministry.\n\nPastors Galen & Kay Woodward\n\nAPOSTOLIC OVERSIGHT PASTORS\n\nPastors Galen and Kay Woodward moved to Albuquerque in 1981 to become Youth Pastors at what was then First Family Church. After 12 years of leading in that capacity, they were named the new Lead Pastors, bringing with them a fresh vision that would serve not only the Church, but the surrounding communities and the world for the next 28 years. After more than four decades in ministry, Pastors Galen and Kay transitioned their role as Lead Pastors, of what is now Citizen Church, to their oldest son Dustin and his wife, Mandy."
