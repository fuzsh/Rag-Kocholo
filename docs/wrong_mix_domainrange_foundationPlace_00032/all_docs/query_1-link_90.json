The full list of 2024 Restaurant and Chef Awards semifinalists can be found below and on the James Beard Foundation website. Nominees will be announced on Wednesday, April 3, and winners will be celebrated at the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards ceremony on Monday, June 10 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\nThe James Beard Awards are among the nation’s most prestigious culinary honors. The James Beard Awards honor those who are creating exceptional food, food media content, and better food systems while demonstrating a commitment to racial and gender equity, community, sustainability, and a culture where all can thrive.\n\n\"We are thrilled for the return of the James Beard Awards—recognizing the outstandingly talented leaders making their mark on American food,” said Clare Reichenbach, CEO of the James Beard Foundation. “As we’ve heard time and again from honorees, receiving this recognition has the potential to be truly transformative—and so, the Awards remain a vital platform for supporting and elevating the independent restaurant industry as a whole. Congratulations to our 2024 semifinalists and best of luck this Awards cycle!\"\n\n“We are so excited to honor this year’s semifinalists who embody the spirit of excellence that defines the James Beard Awards,” said Dawn Padmore, Vice President of Awards. “I look forward to seeing what they accomplish in the years to come. Thank you to the committees, judges, our team, and our partners who help make the Awards happen. And a special thanks to the culinary community who continue to show up and push our industry forward.”\n\nThe James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards celebrate excellence across a range of experiences, from fine-dining establishments to casual gems and emerging talents to established luminaries. The Restaurant and Chef Awards—established in 1990 and first awarded in 1991—is one of five separate recognition programs of the James Beard Awards. The James Beard Awards policies and procedures can be viewed here, and an overview of the voting process can be viewed here.\n\n“On behalf of the Restaurant and Chef Awards Subcommittee, congratulations to all of the 2024 Restaurant and Chef Award semifinalists—each of whom represents a unique and inspiring contribution to our industry and food culture,” said Restaurant and Chef

Established in 1990, the James Beard Awards are among the nation’s most prestigious honors recognizing leaders in the culinary and food media industries and those in the broader food systems. The Awards are overseen by the Awards Committee. Each Awards program (Book, Broadcast Media, Journalism, Leadership, and Restaurant and Chef) has its own subcommittee with members who volunteer their time to oversee the policies, procedures, and selection of judges for their respective program. All James Beard Award winners receive a certificate and a medallion engraved with the James Beard Awards insignia.
