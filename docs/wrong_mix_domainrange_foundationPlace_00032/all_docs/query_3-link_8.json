        "text": "The UNM Department of Theatre and Dance is excited to present “Pippin,” a captivating and surprising musical that tells the story of a young Pippin, the son of King Charlemagne, as he embarks on a quest to find his true identity and purpose in life. Written by Roger O. Hirson, with music and lyrics by the acclaimed Stephen Schwartz, and directed by Associate Professor Kate Clarke, this show is a playful and exciting romp into life’s deeper meanings.\n\nFollowing the example of life’s own twists and turns, the play follows Pippin down potential career paths, new experiences and hobbies, exciting loves and betrayals as he finds his corner of the sky—the place where he feels he truly belongs. Tempted every which way by power and intrigue, and the alluring nature of the stage, he eventually comes to realize that the big finale is not always what you think it will be.\n\nKate Clarke, the director behind this production, shares her thoughts on the show:\n\n“I feel incredibly proud of the work we are making,” Clarke said. “As a director, I love to bring things to the stage that an audience can’t experience just as easily, or better on a screen, and with the live music, dance, circus techniques, and trapeze work in our show, we absolutely fit that description. Every song in Pippin is delightful; by turns, thrilling, joyful, heartfelt, and sexy. Characters are funny, touching, mysterious, innocent, or conniving. What a world to be immersed in, whether for a few hours of an evening, or a full season, as in my case. We hope you enjoy it.”\n\nIncluded in the creative credits is Nathan Dryden, a circus artist who came to UNM to guest teach the rigging and artistry of the trapeze. Under their direction, students of the UNM Theatre Program were able to learn improvisation and choreography for the trapeze, an exciting element to this already colorful and enlivening play. With the spirited dancing and exceptional singing, “Pippin” is a magical evening of entertainment.\n\nRodey Theatre\n\nNovember 3rd, 4th, 9th, 10th and 11th at 7:30pm\n\nNovember 5th at 2pm and 7:30pm\n\nNovember 12th at 2:00pm\n\nDouble-casted –and trust us, you’re going to want to see it twice!"
