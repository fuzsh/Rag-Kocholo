I’ve found the freedom of travel to be a good catalyst for the imagination. Being out of your normal routine and waking up in a new place every day is freeing, but it also can feel a little chaotic at times. Putting pen to paper has been a positive outlet for me as long as I can remember, and this song is a testament to that both in its conception as well as lyrically; finding inspiration in the constant variation of your surroundings, but also having a solid foundation to keep you grounded. \n\nAfter summer tour, Sticky and I got right back in the studio and started recording “Railroad Shelter.” We had the backbone of a song, lyrics, melodies and chord progressions, but we needed to take the time to make the song come to life. Lots of hours were spent trying to come up with the right tones, feel and structure that we were looking for. It’s always one of the most fun parts of the creative process. Our boy @patchdogg came in and laid down some crucial bass lines and @johnnycosmic added some extra guitar and vocal flare to further expand the overall sound, while Sticky handled the instruments and production. \n\n“Railroad Shelter” is the culmination of a lot of thought, time, and effort, but mostly it’s just something that we really enjoy doing; making music for others to listen to. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did making it. Much love.  \n—TJ O’Neill\".",
