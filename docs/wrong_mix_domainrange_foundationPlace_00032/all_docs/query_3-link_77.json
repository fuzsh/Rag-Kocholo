        "text": "Kardemimmit is a band of four awesome women playing the Finnish national instrument, kantele. The band members are Maija Pokela, Jutta Rahmel, Anna Wegelius and Leeni Wegelius. Kardemimmit is in charge of their own music—they compose, as well as arrange, write lyrics, and produce. Alongside 15- and 38-stringed kanteles, singing has a big part in Kardemimmit's musical universe where original pieces with a modern approach still have a strong foundation in Finnish, Eastern European and Scandinavian traditions. The Finnish reki-singing style, 19th century dancing music and Perhonjokilaakso kantele playing style, Eastern Finnish archaic improvisation and ancient runo singing are all present in Kardemimmit's music.\n\nThe band was founded already in 2000 in the musical institute Juvenalia in the band members' home town Espoo. The long mutual history can be heard in their unique sound. The silvery tones of kantele flow together with the mesmerising singing harmonies.\n\nYou might wonder what the band's name means. It's a play of words. Kardemumma is a spice that Finnish people use a lot in their sweet baking. Mimmit is a word for girls that have bold nature. That means Kardemimmit is actually the Finnish Ethno Spice Girls."
