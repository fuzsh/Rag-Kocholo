        "text": "Published May 1st, 2024 at 12:03 am\n\nLet’s face it: Mother’s Day — along with most familial relationships — can be complicated. Not everyone has a mom and not everyone has a relationship with theirs that’s worth celebrating. But another truth we have to face is many mothers out there are often our unspoken heroes. Mothers don’t have to be biological either. Sometimes it’s a close friend or relative who fills the role of confidant, therapist or cheerleader.\n\nWe figured the best way to highlight all those maternal figures out there was to solicit kind words from all of those who share office space with The Paper. so we asked the staff of our sister publications — the Sandoval Signpost, the Independent, the Corrales Comment and City Desk ABQ — to share their thoughts about their own mothers. Be prepared though, some of them are real tear-jerkers, so saddle up to a box of tissue and enjoy!\n\nSara Atencio-Gonzales, The Paper. reporter\n\nI was raised under three generations of strong women. It’s something rare that not everyone gets to experience and as an only child, it’s something I needed when growing up. My great-grandma, the matriarch of our family, made sure to raise all eight of her children to be well-rounded and respectful individuals. Her oldest child happens to be my grandma, who even after 10 years since her passing will always hold the title of my best friend. She also happened to give me the best gift imaginable, and that was the gift of my mom. My mom is by far the strongest, most caring and most thoughtful person out there (I am biased). I look at her every day as an example of who I want to be when I am older. I then look at the woman who raised her and think about how lucky I was to be raised under three generations of amazing women. Even though the four generations are no more since my grandma’s passing, I look at Mother’s Day with excitement as an opportunity to celebrate all three of them, and the person they raised me to be.\n\nCarolyn Carlson, City Desk ABQ co-editor\n\nMi Mamacita Theresa\n\nHopeful eyes, love lost\n\nTears, joys, her hands in prayer\n\nHer love lives on in our souls\n\nMe Mamacita Carolyn\n\nThree shiny love bugs\n\nHold my heart captive tight\n\nEarthly spirits entwined fly\n\nRodd Cayton, City Desk reporter\n\nMother’s Day is special to me, largely from a nostalgic perspective.\n\nThe lens of adulthood has given me a greater appreciation for my mom, Alberta Cayton.\n\nWhen I was 9, I got hit by a car and broke my femur. I was in the hospital for more than a month, and my mom came to visit me every day.\n\nThe older I got, the more obvious it became to me the amount of effort that took. Mom didn’t drive. That meant taking a bus, getting a ride from someone or walking 10 blocks one way. To this day, I don’t know exactly how she got there.\n\nShe also had two other children to care for, but she never made any of us feel neglected. I felt like I got all the attention I needed.\n\nThen, I became a teenager.\n\nI’m sure I fell short of her expectations many times and thinking back, I am embarrassed by a lot of my behavior. I was often sullen and difficult.\n\nBecoming a parent myself, with kids who are much easier to deal with, has made me understand the level of patience and love she put into raising us.\n\nThank you, Mom.\n\nMichael Hodock, Sandoval Signpost and Independent reporter\n\nMom,\n\nYou sang to me every day of my life. I started loving music before I could talk, and I still do. Thank you for singing to me.\n\nYou read to me until I could do it myself, and then read to me more. I started loving stories before I could walk, and I still do. Thank you for reading to me.\n\nAs we grew older your memory played tricks on you, but you never forgot the words to Elvis or Patsy. I see how important it is to remember the lyrics, and I learned that from you.\n\nNow, I hear you sing all of your sentences. I promise I will listen to you sing forever.\n\nYou might not remember why this day is important, but I do.\n\nEverything good about me, I got from you.\n\nHow about some Patsy, Mom? Because you’re crazy for loving me as much as you do.\n\nWell, I love you too.\n\nJesse Jones, Sandoval Signpost and Corrales Comment reporter\n\nIt might sound cliché, but my mom truly played a pivotal role in shaping who I am today. She showered me with love and care, giving me the knowledge and wisdom to tackle life’s challenges and make informed decisions as best I could.\n\nMy interest in news and politics came from my parents but my mom especially was outspoken. We would watch the news every evening and she got the newspaper every Sunday.\n\nPerhaps it was her background as a nurse that fueled her passion, but my mom never hesitated to express her strong opinions when she believed politicians were corrupt or when she saw people being treated unfairly.\n\nMother’s Day has always held a unique significance for me as my birthday occasionally coincides with this special holiday.\n\nIt used to be a bit challenging as a kid when my mom and I both received presents on Mother’s Day but now as an adult, I think it is pretty cool. This is especially true since I now get to share the day not only with my mom, but also with my wife.\n\nHappy Mother’s Day, Mom!\n\nI love you.\n\nAndy Lyman, The Paper. editor\n\nI’ve got a mental vault full of wisdom from my mom, but she admittedly doesn’t remember passing some of it on to me. My favorite piece of advice: Never keep change in your back pocket because people might get the wrong idea when they see you digging around back there for that errant coin. But most of her words were much more heartfelt.\n\nOnce, the night before I left for a summer-long trip to see family out of state, she pulled me aside to remind me that if I found myself missing her, I could look at the stars and remember they were the same stars she would be looking at back home.\n\nLater, when I was an adult, she once told me she always knows when I’m not doing well because she doesn’t hear from me as much. Well, mom, I know I haven’t called you as much lately, but I’m doing great — I’m just busy pestering people to write about their mothers.\n\nElizabeth McCall, Independent reporter\n\nI have realized that growing up, it wasn’t weekend mornings that were special, it was the smell of my mom’s French toast. It wasn’t my school lunch that was special, it was the note she wrote on my napkin. It wasn’t Christmas that was special, it was the magical atmosphere she created by decorating the entire house, wrapping each present with love and making it smell like pine trees.\n\nMom, these memories are special because you are special. You have made me understand that home is who you love, not where you live. Even though I feel there is no adequate way to thank you for all you do, thank you for continuing to work hard each day despite what life throws at you. Thank you for always supporting me, listening to me and believing in me. Thank you for being the Lorelai to my Rory.\n\nI know Grandma is watching over you because I see her in you and I know she is as proud of you as I am. I hope one day my daughter will look up to me the way I look up to you. Happy Mother’s Day, I love you.\n\nBethany Raja, City Desk ABQ reporter\n\nThroughout my life, I have had four moms. My first mom gave birth to me and nurtured a love of reading, writing, music and art into my life. My second mother was my first mother-in-law who taught me permaculture and how to raise chickens, ducks and turkeys for food. I will always love her for that. I currently have two mothers-in-law who were both born in Northern Pakistan. We may not speak the same language, but love is so much more than words. It’s the pat, pat, pat of fresh roti being made, the reminder to sleep when you’re tired, the long embraces and tears when saying goodbye and the daily phone calls that mean everything. Having more than one mom in your life is truly a blessing.\n\nDamon Scott, City Desk ABQ reporter\n\nMy mom is the main reason I recently moved back to Albuquerque after living for years in Fort Lauderdale. What can I say? She supports me and loves me unconditionally. I don’t ever feel obligated to spend time with her — it’s something I look forward to. We laugh and have a good time and she’s always up for an adventure. Whether she knows it or not, my mom has taught me the value of hard work and being optimistic, and the importance of nurturing friendships and contributing to your community. I hope everyone has the good luck and fortune to have someone like her in their lives — a true gem! Happy Mother’s Day!\n\nChiara Sullivan, account executive\n\nAs a child, my mom was once teased by her neighbor Roseanne for not knowing all the words to “He’s So Fine” by the Chiffons. From that day forward, she learned the words to all her favorite songs. She often wishes Roseanne teased her about not knowing all the words in the dictionary — it would have served her a lot more than the song lyrics did. That’s why I’m my mom’s daughter.\n\nThe lovely thing about having your parents remarry, is you get a bonus family. My bonus sister Hillary Charlene wrote this poem about Shelly, my step-mom, and I would like to dedicate this poem to her for Mother’s Day:\n\nMy mother is as wild as the earth. Running into a hailstorm to protect her tomato plants, wildflowers and cherry trees. Dropping blankets over already soaked gardens.\n\nStill, a mother’s love pours longer than the storm. She was there to help me weather mine, and because of her whenever the hail stopped, I was still standing. Still free, still rooted. That’s the gift she gave and continues to give, the courage to stay wild.\n\nTierna Unruh-Enos, City Desk ABQ co-editor\n\nI am a journalist today because of my mother. Those of you who have read The Paper. for the last four years, have seen my mom’s name in print. Gwynne Ann Unruh is a self-taught journalist, who literally fought her way into the newsroom by applying to be a general assignment reporter in Alamosa, Colorado in the 1980s. She had no formal training, nor had she professionally written anything before. She was determined and it paid off. She won multiple awards from the Colorado Press Association and I remember going to sleep at night listening to the clicky-clack of the typewriter, as she wrote through the night to make her morning deadline.\n\nTo say that my mother worked hard and was dedicated to literally anything she did is an understatement. My mother encouraged me and forged me into the woman I am, and for that I am grateful. It’s what makes me a better mother and what I hope to pass on to my own children.\n\nRachel Mills, art director\n\nMy two sisters and I practically grew up mermaids, thanks to my mom. Every year she would take us to the pool so frequently that, by the end of the summer, our hair was heavily bleached from the chlorine. She also made sure we were in swim lessons each year. She was proud of her mermaid children.\n\nI have many fond memories of us walking our mini herd of chihuahuas around the neighborhood, playing Nintendo games together and staying up late watching Alfred Hitchcock movies and The Twilight Zone.\n\nMy mom was, and always has been, a free spirit. She pushed for her girls to be strong, independent thinkers. I owe my artistic and musical side to her. She’s an amazing singer and a lover of music, which is a legacy I’ve tried to pass on in my own family, singing with my two kids and bonding over music.\n\nAfter all is said, I don’t think I was able to fully appreciate the difficulties my mother faced until I had kids of my own. Becoming a mother has definitely made me feel closer to my mom now, more than ever.\n\nHappy Mother’s Day, I love you Goon."
