        "text": "Dean Treadwell is the founder of LiFe Foundation and currently serves as the Executive Director. He retired from the Arizona Game and Fish Department in 2019 after nearly fifteen years, and before that he worked as a consultant in natural resource and wildlife management in developing countries for nearly twenty years. In addition to his technical expertise, he also served as the business manager for the American University of the Caribbean in Haiti, and the Research Branch of Game and Fish. In 2012, Dean was designated as a Certified Public Manager by the College of Public Program at Arizona State University.\n\nDean’s son, Luc, was born in West Africa and later played for SC del Sol for 10 years. He was lost to gun violence early in 2020. The support of SC del Sol coaches after Luc’s passing was a major factor behind Dean’s decision to start a foundation to help young athletes deal better with the complexities of life and decision-making in today’s world.\n\nAlthough not near to being an expert in non-profit corporations or the mental and emotional health of young players, Dean’s management style is to surround himself with knowledgeable and motivated people, encourage ideas and discuss all options, try to move to a consensus on actions needed to achieve a desired goal, and then implement and evaluate an ever-developing program.\n\nPete Leebrook is the current Boys Director of Coaching at SC del Sol. He has been with the club since 2005 and has held a USSF A License since 1998.\n\nPete played professional soccer in the UK for Burnley FC (1984-1988) and English XI semi-pro (1988-1994). He represented Great Britain in two World Student Games (1988 and 1994).\n\nFrom 1990 to 1993 he attended Newcastle University in the UK and received his BA in Sports Studies (with Honors) and then a Post Graduate Certification in Education from De Montford University (1993-1994). This allowed Pete to launch his post-playing career in coaching and education. Pete has been coaching youth soccer and teaching in the UK, Canada and the U.S. for nearly 30 years.\n\nAnother keen interest of Pete’s is special needs children. He heads up the Special Olympics program at SC del Sol and has worked with special needs children in schools. Pete has orchestrated many retreats for players not only for soccer skills and strategies but to help educate and bring awareness to the incredible power and significance of their everyday thoughts.\n\nPete coached both Luc and Freddie, the “L” and the “F” in LiFe.\n\nPete adds the following to his bio, “I am extremely excited to be part of this motivated group to help our youth with one of modern-day society’s biggest challenges – Mental Health.”\n\nDr. Paul Standley trained in Michigan as a medical physiologist. His NIH-funded research focused on biomechanical regulation of gene expression as it relates to repetitive motion injury and extracorporeal treatments. He has published over 100 peer reviewed papers and book chapters and currently serves as Associate Dean of Curriculum and Professor of Basic Sciences at The University of Arizona College of Medicine – Phoenix. He has taught medical students for over 30 years and has served as a founding faculty member at two new medical schools in Arizona. As a father of two adult children, including a son who played for S C Del Sol for 10 years, he is keenly aware of the opportunities and challenges today’s youth face while achieving great things. He strongly supports connecting youths and young adults with mentors to share ideas, solve problems, develop projects, and achieve their goals.\n\nMy name is Hastings Brislin, I am a junior at Brophy College Prep. I play MLS Next soccer for SC del Sol. I have a younger brother (Blake) and a dog (Okie). We live in central Phoenix with my parents. I strive every day to be a very kind and friendly person to my family and friends. I am always there for them if they need me. It’s important to me to be a very welcoming person to all I meet.\n\nI took this position on the LiFe Foundation Board of Directors because I know how important mental health is in today’s world. The loss of Luc and Freddie was devastating for our soccer club and for me. These two players were near my age and in high school or recently graduated. Life can be very stressful for people for all sorts of different reasons. I want to make sure that players just like me have the resources they need to help with their mental and emotional health. No one should feel alone when life is hard.\n\nAl Ledet, Psy.D. is a postdoctoral resident with Wooten & Associates completing the final training and supervision for licensure as a Clinical Psychologist.

Dr. Ledet plans to specialize in a range of performance-based interventions designed to support individuals’ pursuit of balance, well-being, growth, and development, while involved with rigorous competition.\n\nAdditionally, his experiences with adults and adolescents in general mental health and substance abuse settings, have given him a deep understanding of the importance of psychology in all life domains, and how these principles can be applied in various settings, from schools to workplaces. These experiences have taught him invaluable life lessons about self-awareness, mind-body connective work, discipline, teamwork, and resilience. From his unique perspective on performance psychology, he more clearly sees the critical role these principles play in helping individuals overcome challenges.\n\nHeather is currently in her PsyD, Doctorate in Clinical Psychology program with Northern Arizona University.
