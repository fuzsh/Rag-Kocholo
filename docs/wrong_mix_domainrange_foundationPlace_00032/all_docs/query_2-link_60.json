        "text": "Cheers to the 2024 James Beard Foundation Nominees\n\nby David Klemt\n\nIf there’s any question as to whether we’re in F&B and hospitality award season, we can safely say that the answer is an emphatic “yes.”\n\nOur look at the 2024 Bar & Restaurant Expo award winners is here. This year’s TAG Global Spirits Awards have been revealed. And, of course, we eagerly anticipate the 2024 North America’s 50 Best Bars ceremony (along with the rest of the World’s 50 Best announcements). There are also the 2024 Spirited Awards this July.\n\nOn June 10, winners of the 2024 James Beard Awards will be revealed. Below, you’ll find the nominees spanning 22 awards categories. Additionally, you’ll find the honorees of a number of awards, including Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian of the Year.\n\nInterestingly, the specific chefs awards are split into a dozen categories, by region: California, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Mountain, New York State, Northeast, Northwest and Pacific, Southeast, South, Southwest, and Texas.\n\nThis is how I learned that I in fact grew up in the Great Lakes area and not, apparently, the Midwest as I’ve believed for decades. Reality, shattered.\n\nAs far as the Outstanding Bar award goes, these are the nominees:\n\nBarr Hill Cocktail Bar, Montpelier, VT\n\nClavel Mezcaleria, Baltimore, MD\n\nJewel of the South, New Orleans, LA\n\nLas Ramblas, Brownsville, TX\n\nPacific Cocktail Haven, San Francisco, CA\n\nThe nominees for Best New Restaurant are:\n\nBar Bacetto, Waitsburg, WA\n\nBarbs-B-Q, Lockhart, TX\n\nChez Noir, Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA\n\nComfort Kitchen, Dorchester, MA\n\nDakar NOLA, New Orleans, LA\n\nHayward, McMinnville, OR\n\nKaya, Orlando, FL\n\nKisser, Nashville, TN\n\nOro by Nixta, Minneapolis, MN\n\nShan, Bozeman, MT\n\nCheers to this year’s honorees and nominees!\n\nJAMES BEARD FOUNDATION® ANNOUNCES THE 2024 RESTAURANT AND CHEF AWARDS NOMINEES AND LEADERSHIP AWARDS, HUMANITARIAN OF THE YEAR, AND LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD HONOREES\n\nNEW YORK (APRIL 3, 2024) – The James Beard Foundation® announced today its 2024 Lifetime Achievement, Humanitarian of the Year, and Leadership Awards honorees, and Restaurant and Chef Awards nominees in advance of the James Beard Awards® ceremonies presented by Capital One. The full list of honorees and nominees can be found below and on the James Beard Foundation website.\n\nThe honorees and nominees were announced today during a live ceremony at Waldorf Astoria Washington DC, co-hosted by Clare Reichenbach, Chief Executive Officer, James Beard Foundation; Rich Gamble, Interim President & CEO, Choose Chicago; Kris Moon, President and Chief Operating Officer, James Beard Foundation; Dawn Padmore, Vice President of Awards, James Beard Foundation; Nina Albert, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED); Adam Crocini, SVP and Global Head of Food & Beverage Brands, Hilton; and Monica Weaver, Head of Branded Card Partnerships and Experiences, Capital One. At the ceremony, Reichenbach made opening remarks highlighting how the Foundation is excited to celebrate outstanding achievement, while continuing to build on its mission of “Good Food for Good®” in support of the independent restaurant industry and broader food culture.\n\n“Congratulations to all of our esteemed honorees and nominees on this remarkable achievement,” said Clare Reichenbach, CEO, James Beard Foundation. “Your vision, and continued dedication to excellence—both on and beyond the plate—make you true leaders of American culinary. Thank you for all you are doing to set a better standard for our industry and broader food system.”\n\n“Despite so many ongoing challenges, this list is a positive reminder of the exceptional talent and dynamism of our industry—it gives me hope for the future of independent restaurants,” said Tanya\n\nHolland, Chair of the James Beard Awards Committee and member of the James Beard Foundation Board of Trustees. “As Awards Committee Chair, I am honored to congratulate each of you\n\nand look forward to celebrating together in Chicago this June.”\n\n“It’s been wonderful to hear how Awards recognition has already benefited restaurants and businesses around the country. We look forward to continuing to use the Awards platform to highlight their impressive accomplishments and work in our industry.” said Dawn Padmore, VP of Awards, James Beard Foundation. “Thank you to our committee members and judges for their work, and congratulations to all honorees and nominees.”\n\nThe James Beard Awards, among the nation’s most prestigious honors in the culinary and food media industries, recognize exceptional talent as well as a demonstrated commitment to racial and gender equity, community, sustainability, and a culture where all can thrive. James Beard Awards policies and procedures can be viewed at jamesbeard.org/awards/policies.\n\nAchievement Awards\n\nThe James Beard Awards comprise three Achievement Awards: Leadership Awards, which awards five candidates and has a dedicated subcommittee and voting body, as well as the Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian of the Year Awards, both of which are administered by the Awards Committee.\n\nLeadership Awards\n\nThe Leadership Awards program recognizes achievement by individuals and/or organizations who are actively working to set standards that create more equitable, just, sustainable, and economically viable food systems for producers, workers, and consumers alike.\n\nThe 2024 Leadership Awards categories were created by the James Beard Foundation, with input from the Leadership Subcommittee, as a reflection of the Foundation’s policy agenda and its impact priorities for 2023-2024.\n\nThe Leadership Awards honorees will be celebrated at an invite-only ceremony in Chicago on Sunday, June 9 and recognized on stage at the Restaurant and Chef Awards ceremony on Monday, June 10 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago.\n\n“In recognizing the myriad challenges of the independent restaurant industry and our broader food landscape, the James Beard Leadership Awards honorees stand as a beacon and inspiration for all of us who are committed to a more equitable and sustainable future,” said Lakisha May, Chair of the Leadership Awards Subcommittee. “We are proud to recognize the diligent efforts and dedication of this year’s honorees.”\n\nThe 2024 Leadership Awards honorees are:\n\nSustainability\n\nLeaders who are advancing environmental sustainability in support of a better supply chain for restaurants. Their efforts may focus on healthy soil, clean oceans, sustainable fisheries, reducing food\n\nwaste, or regenerative agriculture.\n\nMai Nguyen, Farmer, Farmer Mai: Mai Nguyen is a first-generation Vietnamese-American farmer who began their career as a research assistant studying the effects of carbon on the atmosphere and soil. Wanting to make more of an impact, they focused their efforts on disaster relief and water sanitation projects for refugee camps in Southeast Asia, which opened their eyes to the broader implications of food security and sustainability. The child of Vietnamese refugees, Nguyen returned to their roots in California to support the diaspora community and advocate for equitable ecological food systems through environmentally beneficial farming practices. Nguyen specializes in site-appropriate and soil-enriching approaches to growing organic heirloom grains and Southeast Asian crops in Upper Lake, California. Through their leadership as co-director of Minnow, which works to secure land tenure for California’s farmers of color and Indigenous communities, Nguyen helps facilitate democratic organization for land justice. In 2017, in response to systemic discrimination faced by farmers of color, Nguyen helped pass the Farmer Equity Act in California, which acknowledges socially disadvantaged producers within the agricultural system and has created policies to advance equity.\n\nPolicy Advocacy\n\nPolicymakers or advocates who are advancing a Farm Bill and/or federal legislation or regulations that prioritize climate change mitigation, racial and gender equity, or industry practices that foster a more sustainable and equitable restaurant industry.\n\nNiaz Dorry, Coordinating Director, North American Marine Alliance (NAMA): Niaz Dorry has played a pivotal role in steering federal legislation towards recognizing and supporting small-scale, traditional, and Indigenous fishing communities through her leadership in the North American Marine Alliance (NAMA) and collaboration with the National Family Farm Coalition. By advocating for policies that prioritize ecological sustainability and equity, she has helped to bridge the gap between land and sea food systems, emphasizing the importance of including seafood in comprehensive food system discussions. Her efforts to raise awareness about the critical role of small-scale, values-based fisheries in mitigating climate change and advancing gender and racial equity have inspired more sustainable practices within the restaurant industry. Dorry has been recognized as a “Hero for the Planet” by Time magazine.\n\nIndustry Culture and Practices\n\nLeaders who have made a significant impact and are acknowledged and recognized as setting industry standards, with a commitment to transforming the industry into one that is sustainable and equitable. These leaders have put in place systems and policies that prioritize the physical and mental health of employees and themselves and have proven to make for a sound financial model for staff and owners alike that foster longevity in the restaurant industry. They are modeling how to make independent restaurants more equitable both within and beyond one’s own businesses.\n\nMuhammad Abdul-Hadi, Founder/Owner, Down North Pizza and Down North Foundation: Muhammad Abdul-Hadi is the founder of Down North Pizza, a mission-driven restaurant that\n\nexclusively hires previously incarcerated employees. As an entrepreneur in property management, retail, and real estate development, Abdul-Hadi focuses on creating business models that offer both employment and housing to formerly incarcerated individuals. In 2015, Abdul-Hadi bought property in the Strawberry Mansion neighborhood—a predominantly Black and historically underserved area of Philadelphia marked by high recidivism rates. Abdul-Hadi’s aim was to use the property to offer subsidized housing to individuals negatively impacted by the criminal justice system but has expanded the building’s use with the opening of Down North Pizza. Abdul-Hadi’s philosophy of meeting people where they are—recognizing and valuing their\n\nexperiences and skills often overlooked in traditional hiring practices—has not only contributed to the success of Down North Pizza but has also set a precedent for future enterprises that seek to combine profit with purpose.\n\nFood Security and Access\n\nLeaders who have advanced nutrition security, an issue that has directly impacted many independent chefs and restaurants, most notably through SNAP and SNAP expansion, community engagement, and beyond.\n\nHelga Garcia-Garza, Executive Director, Agri-Cultura Network: Helga Garcia-Garza is the executive director of Agri-Cultura Network—a farmer-owned cooperative providing access to local and sustainably grown produce—and of their community supported agricultural program, La Cosecha CSA. For over 50 years, Garcia-Garza has been a driving force for food justice and a dedicated community organizer, working on both sides of the U.S./Mexico border. The daughter of an activist and a member of a marginalized Native Indigenous community, Garcia-Garza’s efforts are driven by her deep commitment to building an equitable and sustainable food system, empowering communities through education, and making healthy food accessible to low-income households. After spending 20 years as an organic farmer, Garcia-Garza now advocates for farmers’ rights on environmental contamination issues. Her work has enabled hundreds of families to access fresh, local produce using SNAP funds. Beyond SNAP expansion, her efforts in community engagement and education around sustainable agriculture practices have empowered both urban and rural farmers, contributing to a more resilient and nutrition-secure food system. Garcia-Garza is based in Albuquerque, New Mexico and is currently focused on building a multi-million dollar solar-powered “Eco-Wellness” clinic that aims to bridge the gap between sustainable agricultural practices and nutritional wellbeing.\n\nEmerging Leadership\n\nThe Leadership Committee may select an additional honoree to highlight a person or collective who is at the beginning of their career but already doing significant work.\n\nChrista Barfield, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, FarmerJawn: Christa Barfield is the founder and chief executive officer of FarmerJawn—a 128-acre working farm providing access to regenerative organic food production through a community supported agriculture (CSA) program, storefronts, and educational programs—and Viva Leaf Tea Co., a farm-to-cup tea brand. Barfield’s initiatives are designed not just to provide organic foods in areas of food apartheid, but also to educate on the importance of sustainable agriculture and healthy eating through on-farm and in-school programming. Her latest venture, CornerJawn, is a redefined corner store experience that makes fresh produce more accessible to underserved communities. With CornerJawn, Barfield is nurturing a movement towards sustainable living and conscious eating for all. Barfield’s work is making a significant impact on Philadelphia’s food system and offering a model for urban food justice and entrepreneurship. Barfield is a Generation Change fellow, Philadelphia’s Community Wellness Leader, and is recognized as a “Food is Medicine” and nutrition security champion by the USDA.\n\nLeadership Awards categories may vary annually. More information on the voting process for the Leadership Awards can be viewed here.\n\nLifetime Achievement Award\n\nThe Lifetime Achievement Award honors an individual whose life’s work has profoundly and enduringly influenced how America cooks, eats, and perceives food.\n\nThe 2024 Lifetime Achievement Award honoree is the inimitable writer, editor, novelist, and television personality Ruth Reichl. In 1971, at the age of 23, Reichl wrote her first cookbook, MMMMM: A Feastiary. This set her on a path to prominence as a “make or break” food critic for esteemed publications like the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. In 1999, she took over as editor-in-chief of Gourmet magazine, commissioning pieces from legendary writers like David Foster Wallace. Reichl’s captivating memoirs offer an intimate glimpse into five decades of her culinary adventures. Her first memoir, Tender at the Bone, helped readers to understand “that food could be a way of making sense of the world.” Reichl’s appearances as a judge on Bravo TV’s Top Chef and Top Chef Masters endeared her to a new generation of food enthusiasts, reinforcing her reputation as a culinary and food media icon. Reichl’s impact on the food industry has been recognized with seven James Beard Awards and the Who’s Who of Food & Beverage in America award, cementing her legacy in the food world as a leading voice and trailblazer for women.\n\n“I’m so thrilled by this honor,” said Reichl. “Looking back, I can’t help thinking how much the world has changed in my lifetime. When I started writing about food, Americans paid so little attention to what and how we eat that the very notion of honoring someone for a career like mine would have seemed absurd.” More information on the voting process for the Lifetime Achievement Award can be viewed here.\n\nHumanitarian of the Year Award\n\nThe Humanitarian of the Year Award honors an individual or organization within the food industry who has demonstrated exceptional selflessness and unwavering dedication to improving the lives of others and society as a whole.\n\nThe 2024 Humanitarian of the Year Award honoree is The LEE Initiative, an organization that promotes diversity, equity, and empowerment for employees within the restaurant industry. Founded in 2017 by chef Edward Lee and Lindsey Ofcacek, The LEE Initiative—an acronym for Let’s Empower Employment—is responsible for creating programs that advance women, amplify Black voices, and explore sustainable policies for restaurants. Known for its relief work, The LEE Initiative has raised over $5 million in direct aid and investments for small farms, Black-owned food businesses, COVID-19 support, and more. In 2021, Ofcacek and chef Lee were honored with the Muhammad Ali Humanitarian Award for their work through The LEE Initiative.\n\n“The Lee Initiative is honored to receive the JBF Humanitarian [of the Year] Award and we accept it on behalf of every single restaurant worker who has gone above and beyond to ensure that the best of our restaurant culture stays alive and relevant for the next generation,” said Ofcacek. “Our work is rooted in community, collaboration, and a common goal to create a kinder more equitable future for the hospitality industry. We are honored to work alongside you,” added Lee.\n\nThe Humanitarian of the Year and Lifetime Achievement Honorees will be recognized at the Restaurant and Chef Awards ceremony on Monday, June 10 at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. More information on the voting process for Lifetime Achievement and Humanitarian of the Year Awards can be viewed here.\n\nRestaurant and Chef Awards Nominees\n\nThe James Beard Foundation’s Restaurant and Chef Awards—established in 1990 and first awarded in 1991—is one of five separate recognition programs of the Awards.
