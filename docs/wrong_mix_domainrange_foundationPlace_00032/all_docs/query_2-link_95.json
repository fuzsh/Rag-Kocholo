        "text": "Phantogram’s most recent album Three was released two years ago in 2016; it followed the loss of Sarah Barthel’s sister and Josh Carter’s childhood friend Becky, who committed suicide earlier that year. Today, Phantogram has released two new songs, original track “Someday” and Sparklehorse cover “Saturday,” with proceeds from both tracks benefitting the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP).\n\n“Someday” is a cathartic song—one that delves into the pain of losing a loved one to suicide but moves toward an acknowledgment that survivors must reorient to the life they have to come. The emotional weight of the song seeps in through the lingering between lyrics at the beginning. The song slides from darkly cast lyrics like “Someday I’ll dig out my eyes,” to the gray ache of “I’m always gonna miss you,” to the light of “Someday I’ll be with you / oh, I love you so.”\n\nThe B-side “Saturday” is a Sparklehorse cover. Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, a band which was a significant source of musical inspiration early on for Carter, committed suicide in 2010. “Saturday” addresses words left unsaid: “I’d like to tell you / How I feel / I’ll probably keep it / till Saturday,” Linkous sings.\n\nPhantogram have worked with the AFSP in the past, and all proceeds from sales and streams of their two new tracks will be donated to the organization. The band was recognized this year at the non-profit’s Lifesaver’s Gala with AFSP’s Public Awareness Award: “We’ve learned that when you reach out, people reach back,” Barthel said during the band’s acceptance speech.\n\nThese songs, then, are another hand reaching out—to fans, to family and friends.\n\nIf you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.\n\nListen to Phantogram’s two songs below, plus Paste audio from their 2010 Daytrotter Session, and check out the band’s upcoming tour dates further down. You can revisit their recent reimagining of Three’s “Calling All” here.\n\nPhantogram Tour Dates:\n\nMay\n\n19 – Fresno, Calif. @ Grizzly Fest\n\n21 – Morrison, Colo. @ Red Rocks Amphitheatre*\n\n22 – Albuquerque, N.M. @ Villa Hispana*\n\n23 – Phoenix, Ariz. @ Van Buren (SOLD OUT)*\n\n24 – San Diego, Calif. @ Cal Coast Credit Union Amphitheatre*\n\n25 – Napa, Calif. @ BottleRock Festival\n\nJune\n\n24 – Heber City, Utah @ Bonanza Festival\n\nJuly\n\n06 – Des Moines, Iowa @ 80/35 Festival\n\n07 – Milwaukee, Wis. @ Summerfest\n\nAugust\n\n11 – Baltimore, Md. @ Moonrise Festival\n\n(* – w/ Tycho and Poolside)"
