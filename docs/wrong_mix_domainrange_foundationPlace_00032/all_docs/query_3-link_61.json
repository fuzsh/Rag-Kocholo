        "text": "Cowboys and East Indians by Nina McConigley and Matthew Spangler | DCPA Commission\n\nAdapted from Nina McConigley’s award-winning collection of short stories, Cowboys and East Indians follows the Sen family as they grapple with expectations and culture collisions moving from India to Wyoming.\n\nFor Lakshmi “Lucky” Sen, knowing what to do – or even herself – seems impossible. Her dad calls her a prairie dog, hesitant and scared on the side of the road, but what else could she be when she’s constantly pulled in different directions? Now as an adult, Lucky realizes she should have paid more attention to what her mom was trying to teach her, instead of obsessing over her idol, Dorothy Hamill. Desperate to fulfill her mom’s wish, a forgotten family secret resurfaces, and Lucky realizes there might be a lot more about her mom and being a “good Indian daughter” that she doesn’t know.\n\nA rare exploration of rural immigrant experiences in the American West, Cowboys and East Indians examines the question of how one understands their identity when they don’t see a reflection of it in their community.\n\nNina McConigley\n\n(she/her/hers) was born in Singapore and raised in Wyoming. Her short-story collection Cowboys and East Indians was the winner of the PEN Open Book Award and a High Plains Book Award. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Orion, High Country News, O, Oprah Magazine, Parents, Virginia Quarterly Review, American Short Fiction, and The Asian American Literary Review among others. In 2019-2020, she was a fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and a 2022 recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) Creative Writing Fellowship. She teaches at Colorado State University.\n\nMatthew Spangler\n\n(he/him/his) The Kite Runner from Khaled Hosseini’s novel (Broadway, West End, U.S. & U.K. tours); Tortilla Curtain from T.C. Boyle’s novel (San Diego Rep); The Beekeeper of Aleppo co-written with Nesrin Alrefaai, from Christy Lefteri’s novel (U.K. tour); Albatross co-written with Benjamin Evett (Off-Broadway); Striking Back co-written with Kellie Hughes, from Mary Manning and Sinead O’Brien’s memoir (Dublin Theatre Festival); Operation Ajax co-written with Farshad Farahat; Forgotten Empress co-written with Farah Yasmeen Shaikh (Z Space, San Francisco). Matthew is Professor of Performance Studies at San José State University, California; and Writer in Residence at the Hinterland Festival, Ireland.\n\nGhost Variations by Vauhini Vara\n\nVauhini is a writer. She’s used to being able to describe human experiences in ways that help readers make sense of their world. This is what she does. But she can’t write about her sister’s death – not in a way that captures what she’s really feeling anyway.\n\nSparked by a bit of guilty curiosity, she begins what feels like an illicit experiment with an artificial intelligence program to see what – if anything – she and the algorithm can learn about the very human experience of grief. Part false memory, part uncanny truth, what follows is a series of vignettes that feel at once poetic, bizarrely comical, and vulnerable, all held together by lots of rewrites and a quest for healing.\n\nAdapted from Vauhini Vara’s acclaimed essay Ghosts (The Believer, This American Life, and Best American Essays of 2022), Ghost Variations is a wholly unique, theatrical meditation on how we grieve in a technological world.\n\nVauhini Vara (she/her/hers). The author of the novel The Immortal King Rao (2022), a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize; the story collection This is Salvaged (2023); and the essay collection Searches (forthcoming, 2025), which includes “Ghosts,” an essay about grief written with the use of artificial intelligence, from which her play is adapted. She teaches at Colorado State University as a 2023-24 Visiting Assistant Professor of Creative Writing and at the Lighthouse Writers Workshop’s Book Project. She is also the secretary of Periplus, a mentorship collective serving writers of color.\n\nGodspeed by Terence Anthony\n\nIt’s 1865 and slavery has been abolished in Texas. Having escaped slavery by fleeing to Mexico a decade earlier, a woman named Godspeed returns to the Lone Star State with a six-shooter, one bullet, and vengeance on her mind. She’s ready to stare down danger and near-certain death as she sets out on a perilous journey across Texas with Peklai, the Mexican woman who taught her to shoot, and Nelson, the bedraggled drunk who used to be her master. But, when the time comes to satisfy her own personal vendetta, an unexpected discovery will make her question if the vengeance she desires can deliver the justice she’s been seeking.\n\nSteeped in the ethos of a classic Western, Godspeed casts light on an often-ignored chapter in the post-slavery history of the U.S., while taking the audience on an epic, escapist theatrical experience.\n\nTerence Anthony (he/him/his) is a playwright, TV writer and artist based in Los Angeles. Terence’s work has been seen at the Bay Area Playwrights Festival, the Playpenn Conference, the Chicago Dramatists, the RADAR LA Festival and the Great Plains Theater Conference. In 2023 he was Executive Story Editor on the Paramount+ show “Lawmen: Bass Reeves”. Theater credits include: The House of the Negro Insane (World Premiere, Contemporary American Theater Festival + National Black Theater Conference, 2022) Burners (2017 Ovation nominee), Euphrates (Max K. Lerner Playwrighting Fellowship), Tombolo (O’Neill Conference finalist). He is currently under commission at the Lortel Theater’s Alcove Program.\n\nOne-Shot by Andrew Rosendorf\n\nIt’s 1999. Ellen has already come out on her TV show. Jack’s about to do the same on Dawson’s Creek. And David and Martín — two film buffs and best friends — are waiting to hear about a film scholarship to NYU that could change the trajectory of their lives.\n\nFor the young employees, the small-town video store has become more than a workplace – it’s a sanctuary. It’s the only place where they can escape into their favorite films, dream about the future, and actually be themselves. But, when dangers looming outside the store threaten their safety, David and Martín realize just how fragile their world is.\n\nIn a nostalgia-infused love letter to cinema, One-Shot explores privilege, identity, fragility, and asks who gets the space to tell what stories.\n\nAndrew Rosendorf (he/him/his). Andrew’s developed work at La Jolla, MCC, KC Rep, Signature Theatre, Florida Stage, and Curious Theatre Company. He received an Edgerton Foundation New American Play Award, a Venturous Theater Fund Grant, a MAP Fund Grant, and a NNPN Rolling World Premiere for REFUGE (co-created with Satya Jnani Chávez). He’s an alum of the Goodman’s Playwrights Unit and been a fellow of SPACE on Ryder Farm, Tofte Lake Center, and MacDowell. He’s a previous Core Writer, McKnight Fellow, and Jerome Fellow at the Playwrights’ Center. He’s an associate artist with Local Theater Company and currently in development with Amblin.\n\nCebollas by Leonard Madrid\n\nThree Latinas are forced to take an unexpected road trip from Albuquerque to Denver. Making their way north on I-25, they don’t travel for business or for pleasure. They just need to transport a dead body across state lines. But, then again, what are sisters for?\n\nSpeeding past the familiar locales of Bernalillo, Santa Fe, Huerfano, Colorado Springs, and Castle Rock, they reflect on shared family history and muse about the lives their daughters might live. On this seemingly endless stretch of highway, their bickering, laughter, singing, and discoveries will fundamentally change – and strengthen – their relationship.\n\nMexican culture and the immutable bond of sisterhood take center stage in this outlandish comedy, which garnered stellar audience response at the 2022 Colorado New Play Summit.\n\nLeonard Madrid (he/him/his) is a New Mexican theatre artist. He has been the recipient of the Kennedy Center’s Latinx Playwriting Award three times. He participated in the Ignition Festival at Victory Gardens Theatre, the Ground Floor at Berkely Rep, and the Festival Internacional de Teatro Universitario in Mexico City. He currently works as an actor, designer, director, improviser, and educator in Albuquerque.\n\nRubicon by Kirsten Potter\n\nBased on a true story, Rubicon tracks the career of one of history’s most effective spies. Starting in the years leading up to World War II, the plot follows Elizabeth “Betty” Pack as she transitions from society wife and mother to steely, seductive agent for British and American Intelligence. As missions take her from Madrid to Warsaw to Washington, Betty uses her charm, beauty, and intellect as tools of espionage, leveraging her sexuality to influence global affairs.\n\nOverflowing with intrigue and wit, Rubicon is an engaging portrait of an unsung heroine and the sacrifices she makes to change the course of the war. It addresses the stigma attached to choosing professional determination and personal agency over traditional gender expectations. It’s a work that’s suspenseful, seductive, and surprising all at once.\n\nAn audience favorite at the 2022 Colorado New Play Summit, DCPA Theatre Company is proud to present the world premiere of Rubicon!\n\nKirsten Potter (she/her/hers) is an award-winning actress, narrator, and now playwright who has been telling stories and developing plays for nearly three decades. As an actress, she has premiered work with the Mark Taper Forum, South Coast Repertory, Arena Stage, Seattle Repertory Theater, ACT and Milwaukee Repertory Theater, among others. She has also been a proud member of the acting companies of Milwaukee Repertory, Anteaus Theater Company, and ACT. As a narrator, she has recorded hundreds of books ranging from the biographies of Sandra Day O’Connor and Warren Buffet to outer space vampire-alien adventure series, as well as numerous articles for the New York Times and Apple News. As a playwright her first play, Rubicon, was developed during the 2022 Colorado New Play Summit. Her latest work, Unraveling, received a workshop at ACT in Seattle."
