They are also available by phone through Hold My Ticket at 505-886-1251.\n\n$1 from each ticket sold will benefit Unlimited Resources Giving Enlightenment (U.R.G.E. Foundation).\n\nFREE PARKING at Expo for this concert!\n\nAn eight-time Grammy winner, Emmy winner, humanitarian, singer, songwriter and producer, Ziggy Marley has released twelve albums, to much critical acclaim. Now with his own label Tuff Gong Worldwide, and publishing company Ishti Music, Marley has complete control of his master recordings and publishing.\n\nHis early immersion in music came at age ten when he sat in on recording sessions with his father, Bob Marley. After eight records with The Melody Makers and three Grammy Awards, with such chart-topping hits as \"Look Who’s Dancing,\" \"Tomorrow People\" and \"Tumbling Down,\" he kicked off a legendary solo career in 2003 with Dragonfly. He impressively garnered the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2006 (Love Is My Religion), 2013 (In Concert), 2014 (Fly Rasta) and 2016 for the self-titled Ziggy Marley—which marked his fourth consecutive debut at #1 on the Billboard Top Reggae Album Chart.\n\nHis first children's album Family Time received the 2009 Grammy for Best Children’s Album, and he also took home a Daytime Emmy Award for \"I Love You Too,\" which shares its title with his 2012 debut children’s book, a multicultural picture collection based on the beloved song, which explores a child’s relationship with parents, nature and the unstoppable force of love. Tapping into his expansive creativity, he created the graphic novel Marijuanaman and launched Ziggy Marley Organics—an innovator in GMO-free coconut oils and hemp seed snacks. As an extension of his passion for health and sustainable living, Marley published the Ziggy Marley & Family Cookbook in 2016.\n\nMarley's seventh full-length solo studio album, Rebellion Rises, was fully written, recorded and produced by Marley. This passionate and indelible new collection of music encourages people to stand together in activism through love. \"The rebellion begins in the mind, the melody, and the music,\" assures Ziggy. \"We are a conduit of that. The rebellion is consciousness. Now the consciousness starts spreading, we become aware and we rise.\""
