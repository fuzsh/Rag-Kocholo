        "text": "Alex Alunday\n\nSAXOPHONE / PIANO\n\nSaxophonist Alex Alunday is a fourth-year Jazz Studies student at the University of New Mexico studying under Eric Lau, Ashley Kelly, John Funkhouser, James Balagurchik, and Doug Lawrence. Since he began his education at UNM, he has performed various genres of music professionally across the state of New Mexico, including jazz, funk, pop, soul/RnB, and hip-hop.\n\nThrough these experiences, he has developed a profound appreciation of music and a love for playing. Alex began teaching private lessons as a junior in high school and has taught not only saxophone but also clarinet and piano.\n\nJabez Ledres\n\nBASS / GUITAR\n\nJabez got his start in music at age 14, playing bass for his church in the Philippines. As a teenager, music was his second love next to basketball, but it quickly came to the forefront when he moved to the United States. Finding himself as an immigrant in rural North Carolina, music was his way into communicating and finding his place in a foreign setting, receiving a hands-on education from his high school bandmates on Gospel, Funk, RnB, Jazz, and Soul music.\n\nIn college, Jabez studied exercise science and psychology and opted for less formal music education, learning music through live performance settings in churches and in bands. With more than a decade of experience, Jabez has become a well-rounded musician capable of performing most genres of music at a professional level. He would eventually come to lead the successful local Albuquerque outfit, “The Mango Cakes.” He has also written and produced music for ESPN’s broadcast of the NBA Playoffs and the NBA Finals.\n\nBecause of his background, Jabez loves to teach music from the perspective of universal language, a philosophy inspired by the prolific bassist, Victor Wooten. Musical language can be learned by tapping into the fundamental musical building blocks of rhythm, melody, harmony, and dynamics, elements every human being can relate to. Ability in one’s instrument is one of the many means for harnessing these core principles to evoke the emotions people feel as they listen to and perform music. Jabez’s aim is for every student to learn and embrace their instrument’s role in a group and to perform with others at a level that can move everyone from the highest level musician to the casual listener in the room.\n\nTina Marquez\n\nDRUMS / PIANO\n\nTina Marquez's passion for music ignited at the age of 8, propelling her into an exciting musical career. Throughout her education, Tina's commitment to music remained unwavering. From middle school to college, she pursued musical studies alongside academic endeavors, culminating in her graduation from UNM in 2021 with dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in Psychology and Music.\n\nShe has toured with Drum Corps International, showcased her talent with esteemed ensembles such as the New Mexico Philharmonic and Albuquerque Jazz Orchestra and collaborated with numerous country, pop, Latin, and rock groups throughout the region. As the director of percussion at La Cueva High School and an instructor at Rock 101, Tina shares her expertise and passion with young aspiring musicians.\n\nTina believes that one's musical prowess should not be measured against others but against personal growth. She advocates for continuous self-improvement, emphasizing the importance of surpassing one's own previous achievements every day."
