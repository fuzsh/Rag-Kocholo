        "text": "“As we begin Women’s History Month, we want to celebrate everything that women have achieved in our game and in our industry, but it’s just as important to look to the future and support the next shift of female leaders in hockey and all throughout sports” - Valerie Camillo, President and CEO of Spectator Sports and Entertainment Today, the Philadelphia Flyers launched \"Next Shift: Mentoring the Next Generation of Female Leaders\". The new program will pair local young women with female leaders and executives from the hockey and business operations sides of the organization and provide them with a behind-the-scenes look at the different roles they play on gameday. Selected participants will receive four tickets to the game, receive an official working credential, and attend a welcome reception where they will meet with other members of the program and the full group of Flyers female leaders. Applicants must be ages 14-22. Applications will close on Monday, March 13 at 12 p.m. ET. Those selected for the program will be notified the week of March 13."
