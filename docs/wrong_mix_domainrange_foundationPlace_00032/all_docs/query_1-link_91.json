        "text": "Music City Center is proud to be part of Nashville’s eclectic art scene. More than 100 pieces of art are on display throughout the 2.1 million square foot facility.\n\nDuring the master planning process for the building, $2 million was budgeted for an art collection. The facility’s governing board, known as the Convention Center Authority, worked with an art committee consisting of art professionals, as well as Nashville citizens, to select the pieces for the new convention center. Over 225 artists submitted applications.\n\nThe selected artwork features a broad spectrum of artistic media including paintings, suspended pieces, new media, mosaics, and lightworks, among other forms. Of the 52 artists represented in the acquired collection, 32 are from Nashville-Davidson County. Another 16 are from other parts of Tennessee, and the remaining four are from Georgia and Kentucky.\n\nEight site-specific, commissioned art pieces are also part of the collection. Two of these pieces are from local artists, Jamaal Sheats and Alicia Henry.\n\nVIDEO: Take a tour of the Music City Center art collection. Narrated by art consultant Rich Boyd and produced by Metro Nashville Network (formerly Metro3), MCC ART was released in February 2014.\n\nUNCONVENTIONAL – In 2013, the Convention Center Authority published “UNCONVENTIONAL,” an artbook documenting the extraordinary artwork found throughout newly opened Music City Center. Striking photography and informative essays catalog the impressive collection of public art and how it complements the iconic architecture of the facility. The commemorative 12\" x 12\" book is available for purchase.

He has closely followed Nashville's dynamically changing urban landscape and produced a years-long series of architectural abstractions to visualize the city’s creative energy.\n\nMostly self-taught, his Art of Construction series won top honors as part of the Nashville Arts and Business Council's Periscope Class of 2017. He’s been awarded several grants for public art projects in the Nashville area including his 2019 “Little Kurdistan Community Mural,” which was featured on Nashville Public Radio. Since 2010, his work has been exhibited at multiple gallery and art shows in the region. He was named Best in Show at Nashville's prestigious American Artisan Festival in 2022. Sobota's public collections include pieces for Metro Nashville, the Nashville Soccer Club, Meta, and Graduate Hotels.\n\nIn November 2023, Sobota was commissioned to create a piece in celebration of Music City Center’s tenth anniversary. “The First Ten Years” was inspired by the unique design of the building itself. The composition also includes references to the surrounding urban neighborhood located south of Broadway, commonly referred to as “Sobro.” Multi-colored light rays seen at the center and center-right of the painting are a nod to the nearby public art installation, “Stix.” According to Sobota, they symbolize outside forces that could have potentially reigned down on the convention center but, ultimately, read as upward direction markers for its success. The finished piece proudly celebrates the initial ten-year period of the facility, while leaving room for its future. “This painting is a celebration of the dedicated teams of people who help that building and its many parts function at such a high level,” Sobota said upon its unveiling in March 2024.\n\nJerry Atnip has a 36-year career as a commercial and fine art photographer. He began as Partner and Creative Director of an ad agency in Nashville as well as Director of its photography department. His images have been published in 40 countries, and since 2003, he's held over 75 exhibitions and been presented with over 90 awards. He is also a teacher, workshop director, curator, juror and frequent lecturer. He is on the boards of several arts and photography organizations.\n\nHis work has been collected by museums, corporate and private collectors, and he is an Exhibiting Member of The National Arts Club in New York. Those who have curated his work include Carol McCusker, Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego, CA, Hossein Farmani, Founder of the Lucie Awards, Cig Harvey, Art Institute of Boston at Lesley University, Mac Holbert, co-founder of Nash Editions, Eli Reed, Magnum photographer, Julian Cox, Curator of deYoung Museum in San Francisco, Peter MacGill, President of Pace/MacGill Gallery in New York, Joyce Tenneson, photographer and Jane Jackson, Curator of the Sir Elton John Photography Collection.‚ÄÇ\n\nCorporate Collectors include Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Vanderbilt University, Hungarian Multicultural Center, Shepherd Center-Atlanta, Georgia, Avenue Bank, Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell & Berkowitz, PC, Vanderbilt Hospital, Tennessee Bank & Trust, DIGIfoto-Czech Republic and ABC's Nashville television series.\n\nSelected exhibitions include Art of Photography Show, San Diego, California, National Exhibition at Marin Museum of Contemporary Art, Novato, California, Emirates Photography Exhibition, Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture & Heritage, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Px3, Prix de la Photographie Paris, Paris, France, Basundhara Arts Festival, Basundhara, Kathmandu, Miniatures, Albuquerque Museum of Art, Spectra Triennial at Silvermine Guild Arts Center, New Canaan, Connecticut, DIGIfoto Exhibition, Brno and Prague, Czech Republic, International Exhibition at Hungarian Multicultural Center, Budapest, Hungary, The Fourth Annuale Exhibition at Light Factory Museum of Contemporary Photography, Charlotte, North Carolina and 2012 Juried Exhibition at Center for Photographic Art, Carmel, California.\n\nHis first book, Gone South was published in 2011. The Guitar: An American Love Story was published in 2012 in collaboration with the Tennessee State Museum.\n\nHis work has been featured in articles by Elizabeth Avedon, John Bennette, CNN Photo blog, La Journal de la Photographie, The Photo Review, pdn magazine, Silvershotz magazine, Photographers Forum magazine, PhotoLife magazine, South by Southeast magazine, Folly magazine, Lenscratch magazine, Nashville Arts Magazine, Photo-Eye, ArtNowNashville and John Wall's Southern Photography.\n\nVictoria Boone began inventing symbols at the age of 16. She used symbols to represent people and places. By the age of 20, these symbols represented secret places and lovers. Studying art history and studio art at the University of Alabama, her private semiology began incorporating hieroglyphics and pictographs in her paintings. Since then, she has developed her symbols to include Native American, Hindi in Devanagari script, and Chinese hieroglyphics. Boone currently has over 300 personal symbols representing artists, businesses, locations, family and friends. Boone's paintings are even more valued because of her personal symbols that document passionate love stories.\n\nIn addition, Boone adds \"My series of paintings is a reflection of the String Theory. This physics theory examines the idea that all matter is made from vibrating strands (called strings). This theory is a theory of UNIFICATION. It summaries my belief that all life is interconnected: a reason I use symbols from many cultures, including my own made up language.\"\n\nI paint intuitively, and afterwards - based on style, color and FEEL - the title emerges.\n\nArtemis looks strong, feminine, regal and complex. As the chaste goddess of the hunt, equipped with her quiver of golden arrows, she holds the central position in this triptych. Her twin brother Apollo is the oracular god of intellect and in time began to supplant Helios as the god of light. The geometry and brilliance of this painting looks almost like a literal, if abstract, representation of Apollo. Zeus, their father, is the king of the Greek gods. It just happened that this canvas - with the dark wash - looked like the older source material for this progeny.\n\nI love that the Music City Center chose these paintings, as Nashville is known as the Athens of the South. It is my honor and pleasure to make a small contribution to that legacy.\n\nBorn in 1946 in Richmond, Indiana, Jane Braddock currently lives in Nashville. Reflecting her interests in Eastern spirituality and metaphysics, Braddock's abstract paintings present both the visual expressions of physical experience and the artist's attempt to capture an inner reality beneath sensorial appearances. Bio from Facing South- Portraits of Southern Artists, by Jerry Siegel\n\nThe Attack on Her Majesty's Ship Beagle, 1860-2008 began as the confluence of a book I was reading about Charles Darwin and an image I had seen in a scientific catalog; the image was of the model of a cutaway of an earthworm, which just happened to be a later subject of study for Darwin. How the earthworm model came to be towed by Darwin's expeditionary ship H.M.S. Beagle, under attack by aircraft, naval vessels: including a submarine flying the Papal flag: numerous references to Darwin's experimental interests, and the presence of the Biblical Authenticator 2000 is a matter of conceptual improvisation during the process of painting. All I knew for sure when I began the painting was that the earthworm model was so danged beautiful it had to drive the painting; all else followed suit. Darwin's grandson, by the way, has seen, and apparently liked, images he was shown of the finished painting. What a nice conclusion to the process.\n\nThis piece is based on an image I took in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans about 4 years after Katrina. It was a structure that looked to have been an old warehouse or storage building, and it was collapsing slowly in the most fascinating way. My work on the paper bags always starts with a photo that I have taken myself, which I then have blown up at Kinko's. From the large photocopy I make a tracing on tracing paper, and at this stage much information is edited out and liberties are taken in adding line and form according to where I want the composition to go. It is a way of reducing the literal image of the photograph into a more abstract linear form. The tracing is then transferred onto the bag 'canvas' (large grocery sacks sewn together with silk thread) with carbon paper, thereby bringing the image yet another step further away from the original reality.\n\nThe palette, atmosphere and mood of this piece was inspired by one of my favorite paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, called 'The Sea of Ice' from 1824. I saw a parallel between his composition and the form of the building I found in the Ninth Ward, and wanted to draw a comparison not only between two disastrous events but also between two eras of artistic interpretation of the landscape.\n\nMaysey Craddock is a painter and sculptor currently living and working in Memphis, TN. Craddock received her BA in 1993 from Tulane University in New Orleans and her MFA in 2003 from Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine.\n\nSince the mid-nineties, Craddock's work has appeared in exhibitions across the United States and in Germany. Craddock has been an artist in residence at Oberpf√§lzer K√ºnstlerhaus in Schwandorf, Germany; Maine College of Art in Portland, Maine; and the Virginia Center for Creative Arts in Amherst, Virginia. She is also the recipient of two residency grants from the Vermont Studio Center and was awarded grants from the Louisiana Endowment for the Arts and the Tennessee Arts Commission. Her work can be seen in many public and private collections, including the Brooks Museum of Art in Memphis, Tennessee and the Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, Arkansas. Recent shows have included Forest for the Trees at David Lusk Gallery, Present Tense at the Dixon Museum of Art and A Different Kind of Landscape at Brooks Museum of Art.\n\nCraddock's watercolor and gouache paintings on sewn paper bags reflect the strength and promise that can be found in profound change and loss. Based on her own photographs of shifting landscapes, her paintings are intricate renderings of the intersection of man and nature, conjuring an atmosphere of absence and reclamation.\n\nShe is represented nationally by David Lusk Gallery, Memphis; Sears Peyton Gallery, New York and Los Angeles, CA; and Cris Worley Fine Arts, Dallas.\n\nI'm trying to tell a story whether it's through a lyric and melody or in a printed photograph. I tend to shoot and print full frame images because I crop as I shoot. I prefer to discover the image and move around it - to compose from the image rather than as an afterthought. I try to always have a camera with me so my photographs are not posed. Capturing photographs - sometimes it's simply capturing a moment. Sometimes that beauty is a vast landscape in Montana - sometimes it's my daughter jumping off a diving board. Both equally as gorgeous - both equally challenging to render. As for process, I shoot what I have in my hand at the time. Some images are made with a plastic toy camera and others digital, including 35mm, half-frame and medium format.\n\nMy most recent works have become an important vice for my personal artistic expression. These works exhibit a range of themes that have become increasingly important to me within the past decade of my life. Themes involving love, acceptance of life and death, my personal narrative of being a black male in our society and my role as a husband and father are prevalent in my most recent works. I am interested in how popular culture affects me in the context of these themes. In creating these works, I choose to depict images that are personal to me, whilst having the ability to translate them in such a way as to invite the viewer in without appearing voyeuristic.\n\nI am most comfortable working in a figurative manner in order to closely relate my subject matter to the human experience. Rendering the figures in a somewhat stylized fashion allows me to hold the right to step outside reality while maintaining believability. Storytelling is important in my process, but my works are intentionally becoming less narrative and more about the relation of form and function. I am pleased when my works pose more questions than answers. This allows the viewer to bring their own experiences into the work, as opposed to accepting mine. I feel that my artwork is most powerful when it speaks to the viewer in such a way that he or she leaves with something that they did not have before they came. My goal is for that something to be an appreciation of the artistic, creative and critical process.\n\nBorn: Dayton, OH 1970\n\nEducation: 2000 MFA, Savannah College of Art and Design (Graduated Outstanding Painting Student, 2000), 1992, BS in Studio Art, Tennessee State University.\n\nThe Arts have played a major role in Samuel Dunson's life since his youth. He was fortunate enough to be born into a household where exposure to the Arts was as important as academic study. His parents, although not raised in the arts themselves, saw fit to give their children the experience of theater, dance, music and the visual arts by making annual trips to major metropolitan cities to view the arts as well as visiting galleries and museums in the Dayton, Ohio area. Samuel was also a member of the Muse Machine which allowed its members to take field trips away from school in order to take part in artistic events.\n\nSamuel continued his formal education by enrolling in Tennessee State University. He first majored in Architectural Engineering, but soon changed his major to Studio Art. Early on in his academic and artistic pursuit he chose to work 3-dimensionally, but in the end, painting and drawing would peak his interest. He began to exhibit his works soon after college. From his exhibition record and portfolio, he gained admission into the Savannah College of Art and Design under a Presidential Fellowship award. After a successful two years, he received his MFA in painting.\n\nSamuel now exhibits his paintings in group and solo shows on a regular basis. His works have been reported and critiqued in art journals and newspapers alike. Samuel teaches painting, drawing and 2D design, as well as Art Appreciation at Tennessee State University. He has been employed by the University since 2000.\n\nMary Addison Hackett (b.1961, Atlanta, GA) is a painter with a background in video art and narrative. Solo and group exhibitions include About Face, curated by Daniel Weinberg at ACME (Los Angeles); To Live and Paint in LA at the Torrance Art Museum (Torrance, California); John Davis Gallery (Hudson, NY); Weekend (Los Angeles, CA); Kristi Engle Gallery (Los Angeles, CA); and the Arts in the Embassies Program in Montevideo, Uruguay, among others. Her work has been critically reviewed by Christopher Knight in the Los Angeles Times, and featured in New American Paintings and numerous other publications. Professional awards and recognition include project grants from The Ruth Chenven Foundation, The Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, The Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, and national and international residencies. Her work is included in permanent and private collections throughout the United States.\n\nBorn and raised in the South, Hackett lived and worked in Chicago and Los Angeles before returning to her family home in Nashville where she currently maintains a studio. She holds an MFA in Studio Art from the University of Illinois at Chicago and her BFA in Painting from the University of Tennessee.\n\nKristi has been teaching at the collegiate level for over 18 years. With an interest in philosophy and literature, Kristi's work considers the physical and psychological places of seepage: between language, bodies, and relationships. Kristi's studio practice is primarily drawing but includes investigations into other media (photography, sculpture, and installation) as the nature of the investigation dictates. She is a member of the artist collective Coop, a curatorial group made up of artists, curators, thinkers and professors who are committed to expanding Nashville's dialogue with contemporary art by presenting challenging new or under-represented artists/artworks in the community. Her work has been shown in numerous juried shows and invitational exhibitions across the country. Kristi has studied with Laurie Palmer (of HaHa), Jeanne Dunning and Faith Wilding in Chicago, Mira Schor in New York, and Steve Kurtz of Critical Art Assemble.\n\nKristi received her BA from Vanderbilt University and her MFA from Vermont College of Fine Art. She is currently the Chair of the Fine Art Department, as well as an Associate Professor of Fine Arts, at Watkins College of Art, Design and Film.\n\nBrady Haston is a native of Spencer, Tennessee and currently teaches printmaking at Watkins College of Art and Design. Brady earned a BFA from Middle Tennessee State University in 1992, and during 1991 he also attended the University of Georgia's Studies Abroad Program in Cortona, Italy. After his undergraduate studies he attended Montana State University (Bozeman) and was awarded a MFA in 1997. Following graduate school, Brady spent the next eight years in Chicago teaching at Columbia College before moving back to Nashville. His shows of note include Paintings and Sketchbooks at the Cheekwood Museum of Art, the Los Angeles Printmaking Society National Exhibition in 2003, The Portrait, An Investigation of the Self at Camberwell College of Art in London, England in 2003, Bacchanal at the Appalachian Center for Crafts in 2004, Art Chicago in 2006, Intersection at the Contemporary Artist Workshop in Chicago during 2006, Abstract Painting in Tennessee at the Cheekwood Museum of Art in Nashville in the summer of 2008, and Superstruct at PLUG Projects in Kansas City in 2012.\n\nBrady is represented by Zeitgeist Gallery of Nashville.\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nMr. Cash is one of my all-time favorite subjects. I love his music, but visually he has a very interesting and recognizable face. Johnny Cash rose from very humble beginnings in rural Arkansas to great fame and critical acclaim through his music. My painting of Johnny is about him as a young man and that moment in time where he is transformed from an ordinary guy into a superstar.\n\nMinnie Pearl\n\nAs Minnie Pearl, Mrs. Sarah Cannon had a long and successful career on the stage of the Grand Ole Opry. She is one of the most beloved people in the history of Nashville's music industry. She is much admired for her many charitable contributions, especially her dedication to the care of cancer patients. Part of Minnie's stage persona includes stories of her fictional hometown of \"Grinder Switch.\" My painting features \"cousin\" Minnie on the road ready to leave Grinder Switch and head up to the big city of Nashville.\n\nI grew up in Nashville, TN in the 70's and 80's - a typical middle-class kid who watched way too much TV. My first artistic endeavors were drawing on the walls of my closet with purple crayon, copying characters from the funny pages and rendering all four members of Kiss. In high school, some kid brough an R. Crumb comic book to school. Crumb's art had a huge impact on me and inspired me to become a cartoonist. I spent my twenties creating comics and trying to get them published (with little success). As I look back, drawing countless comic strips and teaching myself to draw, was the best training I could have had. Self-training enabled me to develop a unique style filled with peculiar relationships between scale and proportion, mixed with an odd sense of perspective. By the time I finally got around to going to college, I had a pretty clear vision of what I wanted my art to be. Fortunately for me, I found a printmaking professor who liked what I was doing (or didn't mind as much as the other professors) and allowed me to make the art that was floating around in my head.\n\nAfter college, a myriad of low-paying, dead-end jobs, and limited prospects in the cartooning business, I picked up a paint brush and began to paint in 1998.\n\nMy paintings are an extension of what I was doing as a cartoonist, though not quite the same linear narrative as comic strips. Again, through self-training, and trial and error, my paintings have evolved into distinctive artwork.\n\nDavy Crockett\n\nFew people are as important to the history of Tennessee as Davy Crockett. In many ways Crockett personifies the frontier spirit of Tennessee. He was very much a self-made man, rising out of the untamed wilderness to represent his state in the U.S. Congress\n\nWilliam Edmondson\n\nWilliam Edmondson was an uneducated man from Nashville who worked most of his adult life as a janitor in a hospital. Later in life he discovered an interest in sculpting limestone. He transformed chunks of rock into rabbits, squirrels, angels, and people of all sorts. Within a couple of years he became the first African-American to have a solo show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. My painting is about how I would imagine Mr. Edmondson's work space to look like. He is seated and surrounded by his creations.\n\nI grew up in Nashville, TN in the 70's and 80's - a typical middle-class kid who watched way too much TV.

They were accompanied by a suite of string quartets commissioned by Bill Killebrew and composed by Rachel Devore Fogarty. The music was premiered at the opening and is also available in CD format from the artist and can be downloaded from Amazon. The quartet is entitled \"At No Time was Any of This Untrue.\" There are four sections, one for each painting. The two paintings at the Center are the first and last of the series and the titles of the paintings are also the titles of the music compositions.\n\nAll of the paintings center around a particular Redbud tree and cover a range of seasons and times and weather conditions. They also serve as a metaphor for interior space and reflection. As the series progressed the paintings became more abstract. The first one completed was actually the third in the series and is the most representational. The music followed suit and the last pieces were actually written before the paintings were completed so the collaboration was twofold and horizontal.\n\nBill Killebrew is a native of Nashville but spent his early years as a child of a military serviceman with the result that he spent the first fourteen years of his life during the fifties and sixties moving around a lot, first to Munich for three years, then to Savannah, GA. The family really hoped to stay there but that was not to be. After the Cuban crisis subsided they were stationed in upstate New York for four years and later near Macon, GA. After his father's retirement from active duty they settled in Nashville in 1968.\n\nIt was always Bill's plan to have a career in the sciences but after a brief foray in that world culminating in a disastrous year in chemistry he turned to the arts, specifically painting. He was helped in this decision by a relationship with Arnold Nye, a painter, sailor and architect who married his grandmother in the fifties and who influenced him deeply. He was also supported by Edna Scales at Hillsboro High School and later by his painting professor, David Ledoux, in the Art Department at MTSU.\n\nAbout halfway through his undergraduate program Bill broke with prevailing trends in the department to start on the path he has been on ever since. Mr. Ledoux was supportive of Bill in this decision by allowing him to briefly separate himself from the department studio/critique format and work independently for awhile, enabling him to begin to form an aesthetic and a painting stance that has stayed with him for forty years.\n\nDuring his university years Bill met and married Rebecca Hollaway. They have been married 37 years and have raised two sons, one currently residing in New York City and one in Takoma Park, Maryland. They have three grandchildren.\n\nAfter graduation Bill supported himself and his family working in his father's distribution business. After a few years he formed a small company specializing in wood flooring and has remained in that business, working on projects large and small including the Governor's office and residence and Schermerhorn Symphony Center. After painting in various spaces including garages, rented attics, spare bedrooms and basements he saw his chance and built a large painting studio on the back of his current residence about ten years ago and has worked there ever since. He also has a lithography studio in Cummins Station.\n\nBill has always considered himself a full-time painter and works every day. He considers his decision to be bi-vocational as realistic in light of his desire to support his family and remain in the South, rooted where his family has been for several generations. He has never wished to teach and considers himself to be richly blessed with family, friends, church and work.\n\nAtlanta-based Pam Longobardi has had exhibitions in galleries and museums in the US, China, Italy, Spain, Finland, Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Japan, Greece and Monaco. Her artworks are in numerous collections, both public and private. A recipient of many awards, Longobardi is Professor of Art at GSU and created the Drifters Project in 2006, a conceptual artistic research project focusing on the global ocean marker of contemporary archeology, the drifting plastic object. She exhibited this work in Beijing at NY ARTS/Beijing (2008 Olympics) and at ARTLIFEfortheworld in (2009 Venice Biennale ARTE VISIVI collateral exhibitions). Edizione Charta (Milan, NY) published a book on the project titled Drifters: Plastics, Pollution and Personhood in 2010. Recent past exhibitions include Voyages on an Uncanny Sea at Gallery Diet in Miami, a commission of new work for Oceanomania at the Nouveau Mus√©e National de Monaco, and at Savvy Contemporary in Berlin. She is engaged in a long-term project in Greece in collaboration with the Ionion Center for Art and Culture, and in June 2013, will participate in the GYRE expedition, an art-science research project along Alaska's remote coasts that will culminate in a exhibition opening in Feb 2014 at the Anchorage Museum and will travel for four years by the Smithsonian. She has recently been named a finalist for the Hudgens Prize, and has summer 2013 shows as part of the Venice Biennale and works in Seescape at George Adams Gallery in New York.\n\nAtlanta-based Pam Longobardi has had exhibitions in galleries and museums in the US, China, Italy, Spain, Finland, Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Japan, Greece and Monaco.

When you don't face any dangers in your life nothing to worry about to be remembered. I do remember all these routes, because these where I passed through and is where I met difficulties and is where some friends remained, in the desert, under the trees and the resulted of the remainders there, was death. We usually walked at night and hide in the tall grass of Ajakgeer savanna during the day, and we were walked on bare feet were constantly infected from thorns and snakebites. Conditions which attracted by lions, leopards, and hyenas, wolves. Many who weren't killed by wild animals succumbed to dehydration, starvation and exhaustion. You know when you fled away in dangers, no time to take any food with you, because you wanna save life first. We got nothing to eat, in such situations what you gonna do, is better to think a lot, so by the same time, we cooked our minds not to die from hunger, we survived on leaves and berries. And drank water with mud from nearly dry pools. The older boys promised food and water in a few days to keep us going‚Ä¶\"\n\n- Excerpt from James Makuac's website\n\nMichael J. McBride, a native Tennessean, earned his undergraduate degree in art, from Tennessee State University and his graduate degree in painting from Illinois State University, where he credits Dr. Harold Gregor with providing a world class artistic mentorship. Currently, as an instructor of art at Tennessee State University and former Adjunct faculty at Watkins College of Art and Design and Film school, his commitment to the Nashville art world's future has always been at the forefront of his own career. McBride served as curator of the Hiram V. Gordon Gallery at Tennessee State University from 1995 - 2000 and has been the lead artist on many community-based projects in Nashville, Sister Cities Mural Projects as well as Nashville International Airport's Arts in the Airport program. Michael is currently a member of the Board of Trustees for the Frist Center for the Visual Arts in Nashville, TN, The Arts in the Airport Board, Tennessee Art League Board, and a member of The Nashville Artist Guild and South Arts southern artist registry.\n\nMcBride was featured in Visions of My People, sixty years of African American art in Tennessee, an exhibit organized by the Tennessee State Museum and one of his pieces was purchased for their permanent collection. He was one of twelve Nashville artists selected by the Tennessean newspaper for inclusion in the Millennium 2000 Collection, a signal honor. Another honor was the Side by Side sister cities exhibition in Belfast, Northern Ireland, featuring 17 artists from Nashville and 17 artists from Ireland. His most recent honor was the summer of 2005 - a ten weeks artist in residence in Bermuda with the MasterWorks Museum of Bermuda Art. His current body of work titled \"Too Black Too Fast\" is a traveling exhibition of art about African- American jockeys and trainers. McBride's work is included in both private and corporate collections in the US and abroad. His work has been featured on television sitcoms, such as Living Single, The Wayans Bros. Show, and The Jamie Foxx Show. Michael has also illustrated children's books and book covers for several publishing groups.\n\nThe energy that moved this painting is part of the constant rhythm and energy of Nashville. As I began to think about the scale of this work's surrounding space, several possibilities took shape. Being a \"process\" painter naturally led me to try large forms in sweeping spaces. What I finally explored, however, was more dense and varied.\n\nMy decisions were influenced by the way this painting fit closely with the specific positioning provided by the site - and its connection to the other works on the wall. The bold architectural vision provided by the Music City Center then led to a series of strong and unexpected relationships. This concept carried through to the work's final stages.\n\nLiving in Nashville has made me aware of tremendous possibilities, one of which appears over and over in my work - the need to push forward and to test one's limits. In Stretching the Limits, taking bold steps has been my motivation.\n\nCarol Mode was born in St. Louis, Missouri and received her BFA degree in Painting at Washington University. She began her painting career in Italy, where she and her husband, art historian Robert Mode, lived for a year in Venice on a Fulbright Fellowship. Her first invitation to exhibit was while living in Italy.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville, Mode worked for Cheekwood Museum of Art, then taught Painting in the Art Department at Belmont University. Over the years, Mode received important artist residencies from the Christoph Merian Foundation in Basel, Switzerland, the Wurlitzer Foundation in New Mexico, and the Ucross Foundation in Wyoming. In addition, she was a Visiting Artist at the American Academy in Rome, Italy.\n\nMode's work has been curated twice for publication in New American Paintings, an annual juried art periodical. She has been curated into hundreds of exhibitions throughout the U.S. and abroad and is represented by Sandler Hudson Gallery in Atlanta, Georgia. Mode has had over 20 solo exhibitions, and is currently preparing for an exhibition in 2014 at Tinney Contemporary in Nashville. Mode's paintings are in collections across the country and abroad. Recently, her work was purchased by FirstBank for their new corporate art collection.\n\nA native of Colombia, South America, Jairo Prado has lived and worked as a visual artist in Nashville for almost 30 years, creating commissioned works and exhibiting nationally and internationally. His work has been recently featured in solo exhibitions at the Leu Gallery at Belmont University and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, as well as part of the Biennial Best of Tennessee Craft Artists at the Hunter Museum of American Art. His work can be found in numerous public and private collections including the Tennessee State Museum, Belmont University, Watkins College of Art, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. His most significant public work, \"Migration,\" is a large-scale mosaic mural commissioned by Conexi√≥n Am√©ricas for the exterior fa√ßade of Nashville's new Casa Azafr√°n Community Center.\n\nPrado has also been an educator to the community, sharing his passion for art with youth and adults through local and national universities, community-based organizations, and arts institutes, including Watkins College of Art, the Frist Center for the Visual Arts, and Conexi√≥n Am√©ricas. His work with the community focuses on celebrating the history, culture, and creative expression of those who inhabit the city. As a result, many large-scale community-created murals and sculptural works are permanently displayed throughout Nashville and beyond.\n\nCircle of Days conveys a theme that runs through all of my work: how time moves through us as we move through time. Symbols of time in this painting include the spinning wheel, the clock-like gears, and circles.\n\nThis painting is part of a large body of work created after my return from a month-long visit to Bangladesh sponsored by a U.S. State Department Visual Arts Initiative. I wanted to make pieces that would contain the feeling and atmosphere of that lush and vibrant country. The overall color scheme relates to the brilliant hues and designs of clothing worn by both men and women. Ceramics, tiles, and ironwork inspired the intricate patterns in this painting, and the plant forms were derived from a beautiful printed sari, a woman's garment fashioned from six yards of fabric artfully wrapped around the body. The composition revolves around a clock part that I brought back from Bangladesh, a country where respect for tradition co-exists with the demands of the global economy.\n\nBooks are objects that we associate simultaneously with both 2D and 3D concepts of space. Paintings occupy that same mental arena. The subject matter of books seems very naturally suited toward a lot of the painterly subjects that interest me. Paintings and books are simultaneously objects and planar screens. Making shaped paintings always snaps attention back to the objectness of the painting and that is a strategy I employ with this work.\n\nI am also really drawn to libraries. I love the slower way time seems to pass inside of libraries. To me they are a lot like churches or museums. They are contemplative spaces that invite us to find meaning in our lives. Empty libraries are typically not such exceptional spaces. Libraries lose most of their power without the objects that they house. The books of every imaginable hue give the architecture more visual interest and also provide a more substantial and symbolic presence. The library is always a space of pure potential. It is also this lovely egalitarian playground where all ideas can compete and be heard. Very few ideas are excluded from libraries or impossible to come by with a little inquiry. This inclusiveness that libraries exude really made me want to paint these spine shaped paintings with a full spectrum of colors. No particular color is emphasized and no particular hue is left out. It is a palette of potential and not a limited ideal.\n\nI have been drawing and painting since my earliest childhood memories. After graduating from the Memphis Academy of Arts in 1969, I was fortunate enough to make a living doing what I love.\n\nIt is my belief that every artist creates his best work when inspired by the things that stir and provoke the inner self. For me, it has been a kindred spirit with nature, an eternal rebirth that unfolds every spring. One of those kindred moments happened when I met Melanie, my inspiration for my painting, Top of the Narrows. Melanie has been a professional picture framer for 30 years, and in the fall of 1994, contacted me in need of a few of my prints for a client. After our first meeting she was never far from my thoughts.\n\nOctober 16, 1995, Melanie invited me to see a picturesque area of Cheatam County, The Narrows of the Harpeth State Park. There she took me to the top of the narrows where the Harpeth River folds round the summit, to view the vista I eventually recreated for the Music City Center. As I worked on the painting it reminded me of how, on that day, I fell in love with her, and how she is a continual rebirth of inspiration for me. This painting is my tribute to Melanie - \"Thank you for being my best friend, my honest critic, and the love of my life.\"\n\nTerry Thacker has been an artist and educator for over twenty-five years, receiving the title of Distinguished Professor in 1985. He is currently Professor of Fine Art at Watkins College of Art and Design where he was department chair from 2006 to 2011. Prior academic positions have been, Professor of Art at Savannah College of Art and Design and Associate Professor of Art at Middle Tennessee State University. Also active as a lecturer and reviewer he has written for Art Papers, lectured at the Southeastern College Art Association, and spoken at the Frist Center for the Visual Arts.\n\nMr. Thacker received his BFA from Austin Peay State University and his MFA from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. He later studied at Long Island University. His most recent educational experience was as an associate at the Atlantic Center for the Arts with resident artist Alice Aycock.\n\nMr. Thacker has shown in numerous national and regional exhibitions including exhibitions at the Brooks Museum, Hunter Museum, Dulin Gallery, and Cheekwood as well as solo installations at Vanderbilt University, Western Kentucky University, Murray State University, Alexandria Museum, and the Memphis Center for Contemporary Art.\n\nHerb Williams was born in Montgomery, AL, in 1973. Every summer from the age of twelve to graduating from high school at eighteen, he worked in construction, which gave him a deep understanding of form and materials. Williams received a BFA in sculpture from Birmingham-Southern College, and there apprenticed under two professional sculptors off-campus. Upon graduation the artist immediately went to work at a bronze foundry in West Palm Beach, FL. There he cast hundreds of sculptures with the atelier Popliteo and the last work of art by photo realist Duane Hanson, \"Man on Riding Lawnmower.\" Williams then moved to Nashville, TN, where he has lived and created art since 1998. Mr. Williams received The Joan Mitchell Foundation Museum Purchase Grant in 2005, the Next Star Artist Award in 2008, and was sponsored by a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in 2011.\n\nAlthough the artist works with many different mediums and materials, Williams is one of the only individuals in the world with an account with Crayola. He creates original sculptures out of individual crayons that may require as many as hundreds of thousands. His artwork hold records with Ripley's and Guinness. Williams' sculptures have been placed in public arenas, such as children's hospitals, corporate lobbies, museum walls, and the White House.\n\nThe press and acclaim the crayon sculptures have garnered has reached as far as China, England, Canada, Belgium, Germany, Australia, Croatia, and Japan. His work was featured at an Inaugural art exhibit in Washington, DC, with Shepard Fairey, and recently he opened \"Plunderland\", a walk-in room installation consisting of almost 500,000 crayons at an art gallery in Chelsea. Williams just completed a large-scale outdoor installation at the National Ranching Heritage Center in Lubbock, Texas, which dealt with the wildfire devastation, and raising awareness for education, safety, and future planning. He is currently planning to create a new outdoor sculptural project in Texas and Colorado in 2013 that deal with water conservation, drought, and flooding. A two-year six-city tour of his artwork throughout China beginning in 2014 is being scheduled now. Williams is currently represented by The Rymer Gallery in Nashville, TN.\n\nJared Small grew up in Memphis. He's familiar with decaying homes and neighborhoods -- they fascinate him. He paints those structures (showing the rotting paint, sagging rooflines, and broken windows) in a heartily realistic manner that dissolves into abstraction as it eases toward the edges of his paintings on panel.\n\nIn an article in the Memphis Commercial Appeal, Andria Lisle describes Small's captivating approach as similar to the mysterious obsession with the vernacular of the South. She writes, \"Small's impetus to find beauty in the dilapidation is, likewise, a purely Southern sentiment that's most often manifested in photographs of kudzu-overtaken barns and rusted tractors.\"\n\nKeen observation is Small's greatest talent. His ability to believably detail what he sees is clearly evident in his portraiture. Whether a worldly octogenarian or a child on the cusp of adolescence, Small captures each individual's zeal. He expresses his practice as, \"‚Ä¶trying to accomplish a dream-like state‚Ä¶I'm imagining other people's memories - fading, but still there.\"\n\nGreene received his Bachelor of Arts from Freed–Hardeman University and Master of Fine Arts from Memphis College of Art. He began his career as a landscape artist but gradually moved toward abstracted landscape. He recently served as the chair of the art department at Lipscomb University.\n\n“Ultimately, I am really glad that people who have known me for my whole life, who have never been able to see what I do, can see it in person, and I think it is great that someone cares enough to go look at it and really look.”\n\n“When I paint, I try to paint how I feel and think about the land, so it’s not realistic visually, but it is realistic emotionally and intellectually,”\n\nFrom 1986 to 2001, my work largely reflected my passion for the human form, employed with an abstractionist's simplicity of vision. Wood was my preferred medium.\n\nIn my modular wall sculptures, I take inspiration from the outward appearance of landscapes and also contemporary architecture. Recognizing the internal geometry of nature in my work gives the viewer a sense of the familiar. Everyone relates to form, simplicity and order on some primal level. The incorporation of negative space as part of the sculpture only adds to this interplay between the art and the viewer. Some of these works elicit a kinetic effect in the mind of the viewer, thus they engage with the sculpture, and in this way, I communicate with the viewer.\n\nI want to continue this conversation in my newest works, the \"Antikythera Series.\" Here, the movement is choreographed through the use of robotics, and computers. This then, is the evolution of my work, and the realization of an idea that I've had for nearly a decade to bring actual movement into my sculptures.\n\nBruce Peebles lives in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife and two sons.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2001, my work largely reflected my passion for the human form, employed with an abstractionist's simplicity of vision.

It feels right to work it. It feels bigger than me. It humbles me with its soulful, timely patience, thriving and dying at the same time. The tree gives me a feeling of connection, gentle and real.

I try to design consistently with the flow of life, a repetitive design of nature bursting with cycles and revolutions. My process is hard and all consuming, like tending a crop.

As he shapes and reveals the visage of each piece, he views his role as capturing then releasing the voice of each tree. From this vantage point, he carves exotic and domestic woods into the sensual, tactile, and delicate forms showcased in this portfolio.\n\nSells works in his own Bark Studio in his hometown of Cookeville, Tennessee. Though located in a relatively rural area, Sells’ artistic reputation, strong work ethic, and recognition of his unique skills have led to invitations to travel and carve rare woods on distant continents. His work has been exhibited in museums and private collections throughout the world, including the Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C.\n\nA tree is a selfless mentor inspiring me to reveal its beauty, its truth.

I try to design consistently with the flow of life, a repetitive design of nature bursting with cycles and revolutions. My process is hard and all consuming, like tending a crop. The results reveal the tree's character and spirit. My work is an observation of science and nature disguised by soul philosophy. I work between these realms creating art and hoping to form a sense of connection that is necessary and lasting.\n\nCarrie McGhee has lived in many parts of the United States, having migrated from Cincinnati to Los Angeles, New York and finally, Nashville. She has worked in historic buildings as a conservation painter and as a scenic painter for a variety of films and sets. McGee received a Visual Arts Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts/Southern Arts Federation, as well as a residency fellowship from the Christoph Merian Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Her paintings and constructions have been exhibited regularly for over twenty years. McGee's mixed media constructions explore variation within repeated forms. Utilizing transparent plastics as a ground, she experiments with natural and chemical processes, such as rust and oxidation, to create luminous works that emanate a meditative pulse.\n\nMcGhee's investigations developed on the periphery of her work as an abstract painter. In the midst of a studio move she discovered a sheet of vinyl containing a multi-layered pattern of rust spheres, the result of a slow ceiling leak. The illuminated metal impressions were unexpectedly beautiful, and possessed a combination of organic and industrial qualities McGee sought in her paintings. Initially experienced as a playful experimentation, this work became the central focus of McGee's efforts, and soon evolved from ephemeral to lasting and architectural in scope.\n\nMark Bradley-Shoup earned his BFA from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in Painting and Drawing and his MFA from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Studio Art. Bradley-Shoup produces meticulously crafted paintings and works on paper based in part on his own manipulated photographs of both urban and rural environments. He employs extensive use of masking tape, rules and x-acto blades to generate precise areas of paint that emphasize the surface texture of his compositions in a way that undermines any elements of photorealist illusion. Prevalent themes in his work include \"consumption and growth,\" \"expansion and recession,\" and \"the elegance of brutality.\" He has worked with various non-profit agencies and educational institutions including the Hunter Museum of American Art, the Association for Visual Arts, Allied Arts of Greater Chattanooga, the Creative Discovery Museum, Chattanooga Parks, Recreation, Arts and Culture, and the Chattanooga School for Arts and Sciences. Currently, Bradley-Shoup is based in Chattanooga and is a Visiting Lecturer at the University of Tennessee Chattanooga."
