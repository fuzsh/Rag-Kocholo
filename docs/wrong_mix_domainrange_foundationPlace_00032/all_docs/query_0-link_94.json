        "meta_description": "This is the first interview in a two-part series with Daniel Ash and David J., lyricists and songwriters behind Love and Rockets, Bauhaus, and multiple other band and solo projects. I interviewed Daniel and David separately, with a similar set of questions. The success of their projects can be attributed, in part, to their distinctly different approaches to writing lyrics and crafting songs. This episode features Daniel Ash with David J.’s interview coming next. I spoke with Daniel and David while they were preparing for Love and Rocket’s first US tour in fifteen years.\nNamed after the underground comic by the Hernandez brothers, Love and Rockets announced themselves to the world with their radically unique take on the classic Temptations song “Ball Of Confusion.” This debut proved that they were going to be a force to contend with. It became a huge seller and a popular club hit in the US and Canada, where it also went gold.\nThe legacy of the band has only grown with more people realizing the extent of their influence and generations of new fans discovering them. The list of artists who cite their influence is impressive: The Flaming Lips, The Dandy Warhols, A Place To Bury Strangers, Jane's Addiction, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Beck, Maynard Keenan, Dubfire, the Pixies and many more.\nAs a bonus, Daniel agreed to share lyrics from an upcoming project, Ashes and Diamonds.",

I interviewed Daniel and David separately, with a similar set of questions.
