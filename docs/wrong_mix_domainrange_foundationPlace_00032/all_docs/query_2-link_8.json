A Primer\n\nThursday, February 23\n\n12:00 - 1:00 PM MST\n\nRegister Now\n\nModerator:\n\nJohn Paul Sánchez MD, MPH (He, Him, El)\n\nExecutive Associate Vice Chancellor\n\nHealth Sciences Center, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), UNM\n\nProfessor with Tenure & Vice Chair DEI, Emergency Medicine\n\nUniversity of New Mexico School of Medicine (UNM SOM)\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nAnita Fernander, PhD\n\nExecutive Diversity Officer/Professor\n\nUniversity of New Mexico Health Sciences Center School of Medicine\n\nLearning Objectives:\n\nExtinguish myths & misunderstandings about Critical Race Theory;\n\nDistinguish between the historical underpinnings of “race” as a social/political/economic classification as opposed to “race as biology”;\n\nApply CRT to historical & contemporary racialized political & social determinants of health to contextualize health inequities among African Americans; and\n\nCharge academic medicine with a duty to reckon with the “ugly side” of medicine.\n\nWorkshop Description:\n\nCritical Race Theory (CRT) has recently become a target of national attention due to recent Presidential Executive Orders and state and local governmental bodies banning its use in public school settings. However, such attention has only led to critical race theory being misconstrued by the media and misunderstood by the common lay person. Critical Race Theory is a specific pedagogical and theoretical approach to understand how racialized historical contexts influence contemporary society. Clarifying and positioning CRT in a manner within which to understand health inequities experienced by racialized groups in the United States is paramount in order to address the social mission of health professions education, faculty development, and clinical practice. A critical examination of the historical and contemporary issues of race and racism in America provides the necessary context within which to understand the long-standing and persistent existence of health disparities experienced among racial/ethnic populations in the United States. The session will rely on the presenter’s two decades of teaching in academic medicine on the history of medicine among African Americans and provide a primer within which to understand the historical and contemporary political and social influences of race and racism on health. Health professions training institutions have a professional and ethical responsibility to educate its trainees and health professionals on the history of medicine – including its ugly side – and to critically examine how historical and contemporary political and social factors have created racial/ethnic health disparities. Until such reckoning occurs the field of medicine’s ability to achieve health equity for all will continue to be futile.\n\nBiography\n\nBlack History Month 2022\n\nFlag Raising Ceremony\n\nFebruary 1\n\n12:00 PM MST\n\nThe Pan-African flag is a symbol of Black liberation and every year African American Student Services kicks off Black History Month at UNM with raising the flag at Scholes Hall.

A Community Discussion\n\nFebruary 11\n\n7:00 – 8:30 PM MST\n\nNew Mexico is rolling out the COVID-19 vaccine to the public and there has been no coordinated effort to educate or engage the Black community around getting vaccinated. There is a history of distrust in the Black community around mass vaccinations and healthcare as a whole. In a recent Healthline article, Titled Why Some Black and Latinx People Are Reluctant to Get the COVID-19 Vaccine it was highlighted that “experts say we need to work directly with community leaders and amplify the voices of people of color to ease fears, build trust, and disseminate proper information about the vaccines.” We are doing just that.

While resilience can be developed, we should consider how some may have no choice but to be resilient.

During this interactive presentation, we will celebrate the strength and resilience of this community and provide strategies to enhance wellness in the future.\n\nPresented by\n\nDr. Ryan C.

Literary Arts. Medical Arts. Implied is the notion that what we do or create is unique to the circumstances of the moment. Unique to the patient. Unique to the diagnosis. Unique to the available medical science and pharmacology. However, when the social determinants of health create unfavorable odds for a patient like myself, born Black in America, poetry becomes practice for the things that ail us. I will spend time in this session sharing my reflections on poetry as interpretation (30 Americans Virtual Tour @ Albuquerque Museum) and instrument. We’ll also Q&A and I’ll share a new poem or two.\n\nAbout Hakim Bellamy\n\nBefore being tapped by Mayor Keller to serve as the Deputy Director of the Cultural Services Department, Hakim Bellamy was the Inaugural Poet Laureate for the City of Albuquerque (2012-2014).

In 2012 he published his first collection of poetry, SWEAR (West End Press/University of New Mexico Press), and it landed him the Working Class Studies Tillie Olsen Award forLiterature in 2012.
