        "text": "As a native New Yorker, I came of age in the 1980s and divided my time between practicing various elements of Hip-hop culture and exploring cyberspace from my basement in Queens with a dial-up modem connected to a Commodore 128 computer. A fundamental affinity between Hip-hop culture and hacking would define the trajectory of my professional and creative life. Starting in middle school, my exposure to curricula that foregrounded engineering-oriented making led me to acquire knowledge, values, and skills at institutions of higher learning while Hip-hopâs âgolden eraâ informed my perspectives on popular culture and politics. The theoretical frameworks that support these two educational influences have been synthesized into my current creative endeavors.\n\nOver the past 20 years, as an artist who works with technology, I have been influenced by scientific work that pushes investigation to artistic limits and artistic work that pushes repetition towards scientific method. This productive tension between art and technology is fueled by my reverence for the scientific method as well as my irreverent tinkering with it.\n\nA result of my work sitting in the hybrid area between art, technology, social engagement, and interdisciplinary research, my practice investigates the role systems play in the generation of form and the role collaborative knowledge production plays in the resilience of communities.\n\nSelected Public Presentations\n\n2017\n\nMaximum Distance.
