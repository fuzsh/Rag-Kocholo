        "text": "Santa Fe, NM — The Santa Fe Opera is pleased to present the world premiere of This Little Light of Mine, a new opera about the life of voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer. The one-act opera is composed by Chandler Carter with libretto by Diana Solomon-Glover. Under development since 2017, the piece is commissioned by the Santa Fe Opera and its Opera for All Voices (OFAV) consortium partners.\n\nWrites composer Chandler Carter, “The music of This Little Light begins and ends with the voice of Fannie Lou herself. The sound of her singing civil rights anthems – “Woke Up This Morning,” “Go Tell it on the Mountain,” “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me ‘Round” and “This Little Light of Mine,” – anchors all of my vocal writing, especially for chorus. But just as important is the sound of Mrs. Hamer’s powerful speaking voice, excerpts of which I incorporate into the score, telling her harrowing story of humiliation, torture and ultimate triumph.”\n\nConducted by Jeri Lynne Johnson and directed by Beth Greenberg, the talented cast includes contralto Nicole Joy Mitchell in the role of Fannie Lou Hamer, soprano Kearstin Piper Brown as Dorothy Jean Hamer, and soprano Heather Hill in the roles of June Johnson and SNCC Worker. Scenic Designer Lawrence E. Moten III recreates the time and space of 1964’s “Freedom Summer” with costumes by Brooke Stanton, lighting by Jason Lynch, hair and wigs by Cookie Jordan, and immersive projections by Katherine Freer. An ensemble of singers from Albuquerque’s Gospel Choir Community serves as the chorus, led by Chorus Director Dr. Stevie DéJuan Springer.\n\nPerformances will be presented at The Lensic Performing Arts Center in downtown Santa Fe on October 28 and 29 at 7:00 pm and October 30 at 2:00 pm. Tickets are on sale now via The Lensic Box Office. The cost per person is $25 and seat assignments are first come, first served. More information can be found at This Little Light of Mine.\n\nTHIS LITTLE LIGHT OF MINE\n\nMusic Chandler Carter\n\nLibretto Diana Solomon-Glover\n\nCommissioned by the Santa Fe Opera and its Opera for All Voices consortium partners\n\nA World Premiere Produced and Presented by the Santa Fe Opera\n\nAt the Lensic Performing Arts Center, Santa Fe, New Mexico\n\n3 Performances — October 28, 29, 30 (M)\n\nSung in English with opera titles in English\n\nRun time of approximately 75 minutes\n\nThe commissioning, development and world premiere production of This Little Light of Mine are all made possible through the generous support of the Melville Hankins Family Foundation\n\nCreative Team\n\nMusic Director and Conductor Jeri Lynne Johnson\n\nStage Director Beth Greenberg\n\nScenic Designer Lawrence E.

Centered around Hamer’s appeal to the 1964 Democratic National Convention Credentials Committee to replace Mississippi’s all-white delegation of “Dixiecrats” with the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, an interracial delegation she helped found, Hamer, daughter Dorothy Jean and fellow freedom fighter, June Johnson, tell the story of Hamer’s courageous battle to raise the status of Mississippi’s Black inhabitants to “first-class citizens.” Hamer’s personal sacrifices leading up to that moment – the violent harassment she and her family face, starvation, medical terrorism, loss of livelihood and the horrific beating she suffers at the hands of local police – imbue her with an unassailable moral authority and provide an explosive testimony that sends shockwaves throughout the nation and alters the course of American history.\n\nAbout the Creative Team\n\nChandler Carter’s work focuses on historical stories that cross the boundaries of race and power. In addition to works for the stage, Carter has composed over 50 songs and numerous choral, chamber and orchestral pieces which have been performed internationally by distinguished recitalists, choirs and ensembles.\n\nDiana Solomon-Glover’s career and talents have been showcased on the operatic stage, in concert, oratorio, recital, musical theater, cabaret and on radio and television across the United States, Canada, Europe, the Caribbean and in Central America, and have long served humanitarian and social efforts. In 2001, Solomon-Glover created the role of Winnie Mandela in the premiere of Carter’s No Easy Walk to Freedom, an opera based upon the life of South African President, Nelson Mandela.\n\nBeth Greenberg has more than 25 years of experience producing, directing and managing live, large-scale concert and theatrical productions in both indoor and outdoor venues. Greenberg is renowned for her work with the New York City Opera and has staged world premieres and traditional works for Opera Colorado, Fort Worth Opera and the Phoenicia Voice Festival, among other U.S. companies.\n\nHeralded as one of today’s leading female conductors, Jeri Lynne Johnson first made history in 2005 as the first Black woman to win an international conducting prize when she was awarded the Taki Alsop Conducting Fellowship. She has broken barriers in Europe and the U.S. as the first African American woman on the podium for many orchestras and has conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra, Dallas Symphony Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra (U.K.) and Weimar Staatskapelle (Germany), among others.

There is additionally a commitment to social impact and the representation of diverse voices through the development of these new and important works. OFAV was guided by a consortium of opera companies led by the Santa Fe Opera including Lyric Opera of Kansas City, Minnesota Opera, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, San Francisco Opera, Sarasota Opera and Seattle Opera — resulting in the commission of four new works, flexible in both scope and scale, which can be performed in a variety of venues. The teams behind the commissioned works were selected through an invitational process and adjudicated by a jury of twelve distinguished individuals in the field of opera.\n\nProjects selected through the OFAV invitational are moving through the development process, each receiving workshops, the opportunity to premiere the opera at one of the partner companies, as well as the opportunity for subsequent performances at other partner companies. Commissions to date include Augusta Read Thomas and Leslie Dunton-Downer’s Sweet Potato Kicks the Sun (premiered October 2019), Laura Kaminsky and Kimberly Reed’s Hometown to the World (premiered December 2021) and David Hanlon and Stephanie Fleischmann’s The Pigeon Keeper. The Santa Fe Opera gratefully acknowledges the following development partners: Kentucky Opera, the American Spiritual Ensemble and Florida International University for This Little Light of Mine; and San Francisco Girls Chorus for The Pigeon Keeper."
