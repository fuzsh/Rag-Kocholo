        "text": "ASM Global’s corporate social responsibility platform, ASM Global Acts, is a commitment to social equity and global sustainability. The program was built upon our long-standing commitments to creating a better, more diverse workforce, serving the communities where we operate, and contributing to a healthier environment and planet.\n\nBy a establishing a more centralized and intentional corporate social responsibility platform, we have focused our efforts on meaningful actions and measurable results at both the corporate and community levels. To deliver on this, ASM Global Acts has outlined bold and data-driven goals to create lasting impact across our global communities.\n\nOur platform is structured around three pillars:\n\nProtect the Environment\n\nInvest in People\n\nStrengthen our Communities\n\nASM Global continues to rise above its competition as a leader in sustainable operations management, stewardship of the community, and socially and environmentally sustainable practices. As climate change and its impact on our world becomes more apparent each day, there is no better time for ASM Global to leverage its position as a world leader, influencing behavior and creating a culture of Environmental Stewardship within our venues and in the communities we operate.\n\nWe don’t just talk about environmental responsibility; we live it every day. Boasting the largest portfolio of 40+ certified green venues, ASM Global partners with Honeycomb Strategies to offer innovative approaches and sustainable solutions for our vast portfolio of the world’s most iconic venues.\n\nTo demonstrate our commitment, ASM Global has pledged to the following environmental goals:\n\nReduce energy consumption by 25% by 2030\n\n20% of all energy consumed through renewable energy sources in 2025\n\nCarbon Neutral by 2050 (milestone 25% carbon reduction by 2030, 50% carbon reduction by 2040)\n\nDivert 50% of waste overall by 2025\n\nEliminate single use plastic in front of house by 2027\n\nReduce Water Consumption by 25% by 2030\n\nAward 50% of our reportable spend to suppliers adhering to our Environmental Purchasing Policy by 2030\n\n35% of menu items to be plant-based by 2024 within Savor venues\n\nDecrease food waste by 75% by 2026 within Savor venues\n\nASM Global is creating an environment of inclusion and equality across our organization, growing the diversity of our business partners around the world, and enabling opportunities for our current and future workforce. The work we do creates connections that transcends languages and borders.\n\nASM Global brings this to life by giving back and investing in organizations that are making both the world and our local communities a better place to live, work, and play. ASM Global Acts provides opportunities for team members across the globe to dedicate their time and talent through volunteering, giving back and engaging in local community initiatives - creating a collective effort to demonstrate our commitment to the people and places where we operate and to make a difference in the lives of others.\n\nThrough the ASM Global Acts Foundation, we support philanthropic and community-based initiatives in the cities where we operate across the globe. With a strategic focus on supporting local communities, the ASM Global Stars Scholarship Program was established to provide students in diverse and under-resourced communities across the U.S. with educational and career development opportunities - creating accessible pathways to pursue their education and career goals."
