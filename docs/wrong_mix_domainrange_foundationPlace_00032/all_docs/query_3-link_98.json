        "text": "Welcome to the UNT College of Music grants, scholarships and fellowships database, maintained by the Graduate Studies Office, in collaboration with the UNT Office for Nationally Competitive Scholarships. This database contains graduate student funding opportunities in the arts & humanities, with sublistings for grants with the Andrew W. Mellon and William J. Fulbright Foundations, the later overseen at UNT by UNT-International (see drop down menu under Contents).\n\nWhereas “internal” awards are those offered by your Division, the College of Music, or the University, “external” awards are those national and international awards offered by private foundations, government agencies, and corporations. External funders can include the Department of Cultural Affairs, Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, Ford Foundation, American Association of University Women, Fulbright Foundation, American Musicological Society, and many, many more.\n\nGrants, Scholarships, and Fellowships\n\nThere are a few distinctions between grants, scholarships and fellowships. Grants are the most inclusive, representing any grant of money in exchange for a prescribed, defined purpose. Scholarships usually refer to grants in support of graduate education, and fellowships usually refer to grants in support of post-baccalaureate projects outside of the normal curriculum. Fellowships are monetary awards connected to a specific field of study and the grant-giving organization. All scholarships and fellowships are grants. Grants, scholarships, and fellowships do not need to be repaid and usually have clearly defined timelines.\n\nPrivate Foundation Grants\n\nA private foundation is a charitable organization that does not receive a major part of its support from the public. Foundations are nonprofit entities which are set up by an individual, family or group of individuals and managed by its own trustees or directors. Private foundations are allowed to give scholarships or fellowships to enable a student to pursue graduate study at an educational institution or fund a graduate student to achieve a specific objective.\n\nApplication Protocol\n\nWhen you have found the grant, scholarship, or fellowship you want to apply for, the following instructions can serve as guidelines for initial feedback about your application:\n\nDetermine the word or “character” limit for each entry;\n\nFill out the response in a Word document, adhering to the word or “character” limit;\n\nPlace the response beneath a cut-and-paste of the essay prompt (that is, the instructions for that essay), and have your major professor review it for thematic and stylistic feedback;\n\nIncorporate the feedback from your major professor into your Word document;\n\nCut and paste the revised Word document into an email and send it to the Director of the Office of Nationally Competitive Scholarships at jduban@unt.edu with the name of the grant in the subject line. He will provide additional feedback in the areas of style and tone.\n\nWhen you, your major professor, and Dr. Duban are satisfied with the Word document, you will undertake the same process for each subsequent entry or essay.\n\nAfter completing each entry this way, you will cut and paste those entries into the appropriate boxes or columns in the formal application. Never work on the Internet site of the application until you have completed the essay(s) in Word.\n\nStudents should complete the application at least three weeks prior to the deadline and show a copy of the completed application to any person from whom they expect a letter of recommendation. The completed application will give your recommenders more to say about you and will also allow them to place their recommendations in the context of the specific scholarship and its expectations. Professors will also interpret the three-week buffer as a welcome gesture of courtesy.\n\nWinning an external grant, scholarship or fellowship requires an investment of time. By matriculating at the UNT College of Music, you have joined the ranks of the nation’s most promising musicians, educators, and scholars and there is no grant or fellowship that is out of your reach. We invite you to browse this online resource and take advantage of this database of funding opportunities in the arts and humanities.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nA\n\nAmerican Academy in Berlin - Postdoctoral Fellowships Deadline: early September\n\nThe Academy welcomes emerging as well as established scholars, writers, and professionals who wish to engage in independent study in Berlin.
