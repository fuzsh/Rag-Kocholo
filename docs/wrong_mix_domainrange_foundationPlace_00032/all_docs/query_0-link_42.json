        "text": "What's Happening! A Board Survey\n\nBoard members, like so many facing stay-at-home COVID 19 constraints, have been able to move communications and meetings to Zoom and other applications to ensure all members are up to date and that the planning cycle moves forward. In the midst an onslaught of online quizzes and surveys (you know the ones… promoted through email threads, and Facebook), we hatched the idea to circulate our own completely non-scientific survey to be sent to the Board for comment. The responses were fun, sentimental, and heart-warming so we decided to share them. First the questions, then the results with more than a few ad libs. With Board member permissions, a few of the responses have been included below. We thought you’d probably be able to identify participants yourself, so no identifying names are shown. This is the message that was sent out:\n\nHow about a quick dose of pandemic wisdom/ witticism from the Board? Please answer some or all questions below for inclusion in the newsletter.\n\nWhat tune/song/poem/story/dance did you turn to during your stay-at-home pandemic? Discover any new talent?\n\nHow many Post It! note pads have you used up during the last year?\n\nWhat chores were you finally able to finish? How many trips did you make to Lowes or Home Depot to get it done?\n\nBest new “snack” you created during 2020… or yesterday?\n\nThere are some super chefs among the Board members. What’s your go-to pandemic, comfort, Folk, Soul Food?\n\nAnyone learn how to juggle? Knit? Other new, quiet time skill?\n\nAverage number of Zoom meetings per week? Most creative use of Zoom… be careful here…\n\nTime for a wee bit of inspiration, or a gag joke. What’s your best new/ old joke you’ve heard/ read?\n\nHow has your hair style changed? Who let their hair grow? Or who cut it off? Found a new favorite hat?\n\nResponse 1\n\nHaven’t received a haircut in a year plus 3 months…but I ordered a haircutting kit and started cutting my husband’s hair.\n\nLearned to make chocolate Depression cake with no butter, eggs, or milk. It’s appropriately named.\n\nAn hour of commuting each way was reduced to walking from the bedroom to the living room and back. Less gas.\n\nRearranged the chord bars on my Sparrowharp and worked up “Better Times Will Come“ by Janis Ian, “Higher Love” by Steve Winwood, and “Something So Right” by Paul Simon, for some good cheer.\n\nWrote a misguided song parody for some of my students (I’m a school based SLP): “There’s a Bathroom on the Right” to the tune of “There’s a Bad Moon on the Rise”. Straight ahead “Blue Bayou” went over a lot better, though.\n\nBut alas, no wisdom!\n\nResponse 2\n\nAs a Gifted and School-wide Enrichment teacher, I have been using a lot of music in my virtual/ remote classes with elementary level students, from songs like Skinamarink-a-dink-a-dink with preschoolers, to I Had a Little Overcoat with 3rd graders, and Sister Rosa with 4th and 5th graders.\n\nI’ve started appreciating Rap more after a training with Baba Bomani on using Rap to teach writing. The students and I are having a lot of fun with that.\n\nChildren say sweet and funny things that help keep me going during the pandemic, like a preschooler who I see once a week saying, “I know you!”.\n\nThe lines between work, organization committees, and home have become very blurred. I am in meetings during and after the school day almost every weekday and sometimes on the weekends.\n\nI have been getting my house ready to sell since last February but somehow instead of getting rid of things, I keep acquiring them. I do enjoy painting furniture and walls.\n\nResponse 3\n\nI’ve been studying Bach’s Violin Partita and Sonatas on Mandolin, that’s kept me quite busy.\n\nNone, but I think I’ve written about a novel’s worth of text document notes on my computer.\n\nNot really a chore, but I finished building my first guitar. No trips to Lowes, but more than a few orders from StewMac and Luthier’s Mercantile.\n\nSo many. I just learned how to make beef jerky the other day, and that’s life changing. So is learning how to make cheese.\n\nPasta Carbonara, made according to the master’s recipe: https://www.tavoleromane.it/la-ricetta-della-carbonara-risolutiva/\n\nLuthiery, I guess! Haven’t had much time for quiet; between teaching online and a new kitten, I’m always busy!\n\n14 zoom meetings per week, average. That is not an exaggeration. My most creative use of Zoom was using the green screen function to put myself on the bridge of the Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) for a parents’ night video.\n\nWhat is a child charged with when refusing to take a nap? Resisting a rest.\n\nMy hair just keeps growing, much to everyone’s consternation.\n\nResponse 4\n\nI think often of the song Coffee Blues from Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nI don't use post it notes, but my to do list on my phone has more groceries than anything else.\n\nI was able to put my late wife Cathy's banjo tabs up on our website.\n\nAsian style pancakes using sourdough discard and green onions.\n\nSmoking a tri-tip is great.\n\nMy new son-in-law got me started roasting coffee. Good morning, baby. I also made an outdoor grilling table for Erika, and it looks pretty good from a healthy distance.\n\nAt least three Zoom meetings a week. I have come to appreciate the connection. Erika and I got married and put our little ceremony up on Zoom. Initially it seemed odd, but it was a beautiful time and we're lucky to share it with lots of folks who couldn't or wouldn't be able to attend.\n\nI get my hair cut every two months whether I need it or not. Between here and Missouri I have been able to pull it off.\n\nYou should understand that the pandemic prevented me from doing four-week rotations on and off a riverboat last year and currently. Instead, I have spent the entire year with Erika and we have drawn ever closer to each other. It's one of the most important times in my life.\n\nResponse 5\n\nGot married.\n\nLearned a new waltz written by Dave Firestine for Dave and I called Giggles and Tears.\n\nThought I would have my garage cleaned by now...that was a funny thought.\n\nBest use of zoom: sing-alongs and song circles.\n\nLearned how to make a chicken Vietnamese noodle dish. Yum.\n\nResponse 6\n\nAt first could not think of anything but then thought of a service I did with Peter, Dan, and Skylar (Gretchen’s son in law). I was contacted by David Millstone, a caller from back east, who was the caller at the FolkMADS camp in May. He asked me to find a photographer that could take pictures of the Hall of Fame callers of squares, contra, and round dance leaders that are on the wall at Lloyd Shaw Dance Center (in Albuquerque).\n\nThat same day I thought of Peter Esherick who takes super pictures. I contacted Peter and he agreed to take photos of the paintings at no charge which blew me and David away. Then I decided to find two other folks to be involved in taking the paintings off the wall very carefully. That is where Dan and Skylar came in.\n\nThe photos came out beautiful and are now being put on a website for all to see with information about each one and with a recording of them calling a segment of a dance. It is now possible to view these paintings online thanks to the volunteers that made it possible.\n\nResponse 7\n\n“Everyone Gets Crazy Now and Then” the Highwaymen\n\nFor the New Year, the Youngblood’s “Get Together“, as in “Everyone get together, try and love one another right now,” desperately needed.\n\nPost Its! hardly any, doing nothing.\n\nChores? In town… feed and water our chickens and turkey… walk our doggie.\n\nSnack? beer! And lost 12-15 pounds.\n\nComfort food, my hubby’s cooking. Folk folks know Chuck’s cooking and are probably missing it.\n\nNew OLD skill, got back to my Enchanted Lens Photo Club photo portfolio of Florida shore birds, which I was able to photograph thanks to Gretchen and Steve’s place to stay just before the shutdown (Gretchen and Steve of used instrument sales and jamming at Folk Fest).\n\nZoom, only one or two, but thanks to Dan Matthews of AFF board and Sing Along fame, a guitar group of forty years has kept meeting WEEKLY! Spreading love and music. 40 YEARS!\n\nHair thinning, breaking, longer but shrinking, getting’ old just like me.\n\nSorry that it is hard to find jokes, the biggest one I find is NOT funny but ironic as all get out “Alone Together” an oxymoron.\n\nSo how can we break isolation in 2021 and bring people together, NOT alone."
