        "text": "Flamenco is the ancient form of artistic expression of Spanish Roma. As an enduring oral tradition, the art and spirit of flamenco is passed from generation to generation.\n\nEstablished in 1999 by Eva Encinias, the Student Companies of the Conservatory of Flamenco Arts exemplify the schoolâs comprehensive and musically-driven approach to instruction. NiÃ±os is a childrenâs performance group focused on teaching young dancers about character, self-esteem, and confidence building through the discipline of a performance company. TeeÃ±os is a performance group for high-school-aged students that is focused on training and performance experience.\n\nBaracutanga is a seven-piece band representing four different countries (Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, USA) that prides itself on arranging traditional South American rhythms in new and interesting ways, such as huayño and cumbia with Middle-Eastern darbuka or mixing Afro-Cuban bata and Afro-Peruvian festejo with Andean zampoñas, among several other rhythmic combinations. This kind of experimentation, coupled with blending ancestral traditions with a modern sensibility, has resulted in an exciting and distinct Latin flavor all its own that leaves dancing crowds always wanting more.\n\nLyrically and musically, Baracutanga proposes to build bridges between the south and the north, overcoming the barriers of discrimination. Aside from their affinity and respect for native rhythms from the lands of their ancestors, the group finds common ground in creating songs those cross-linguistic and cultural barriers, promoting intercultural experiences that empower Latinos with a positive message of self-affirmation. They fervently oppose all types of violence and conceive their music as a vessel to increase and acknowledge cultural pluralism.\n\nBaragutanga‘s live shows are joyous, intense and explosive with fronting duties split between powerful Peruvian songstress Jackie Zamora and the band’s exuberant beating heart, Bolivian multi-instrumentalist Kilko Paz (son of famed Bolivian activist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui). Added magic comes from extraordinary Ecuadorian multi- instrumentalist Carlos Noboa. The group is rounded out by an extremely talented and inventive cast performing on guitars, horns, flutes, accordions, vibes, an array of percussion and all manner of string instruments and is often joined on stage by Afro-Peruvian and Latin dancers.\n\nCome and learn the basic hand, foot, and body movements that gracefully entwine to tell stories of Hawaiiâs history, places, people and traditionsâ¦ all infused with the spirit of Aloha. Hawaiiâs beautiful, joyous cultural dance is suitable for everyone and every age. Native Hawaiian teacher.\n\nThe grace and beauty of the hula - Hawaii's art and soul, is alive and well in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Under the direction of Hawaiian native Cindi Kealaulaulaulaokawaoone Heffner, Haaheo O Hawai`i (which means Proud to Be Hawaiian) provides a wonderful taste of aloha through the hula (dance), oli (chant), and mele (song) of Hawaii. Come and experience the happiness and joy of hula.\n\nThe Here and Now are Chris Buckley and Niamh Fahy on fiddle, Rob Forkner on bodhran, and Joseph Carmichael on guitar. Based in Texas, this fine young band of Celtic musicians is comprised of musicians who have played with many well-known groups, such as Riverdance, John Williams, John Williams, Solas and Needfire, and all have studied with legendary Irish musicians in both the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nChris Buckley studied viola at the University of Minnesota and Irish fiddle from greats Liz Carroll, Brendan Mulvhill and James Kelly. He competed in three All-Ireland world competitions. Niamh Fahy, from Tara, County Meath, took lessons from the infamous Antoin McGabhann. She toured with Riverdance, Project West and John Williams, and did session work while living in London. While living in Alaska, bodhran player Rob Forkner discovered Irish music from a loaner cassette tape of the great Johnny âRingoâMcDonagh which inspired him to fashion a drum from birch bark and salmon skin. Joseph Carmichael is a seriously inventive guitarist who has worked with list of bands in a variety of directions, from his contemporary trio, Flashpoint, to the legendary Solas, to singer/songwriter Ashley Davis in Lawrence, to the nationally touring Celtic-rock band Needfire.â¨\n\nFrom the city where the sun shines through the mist, Temecula, California, comes the jazzy folk duo Nathan & Jessie. Born of the individuals, Nathan Rivera and Jessie Andra Smith, this duo is a unique blend of jazzy folk and blues on resonator guitars and accordion, along with interesting interplay between male and female vocals. Their performances not only include unique all original music, but stories of their travels and interaction with the audience that make for an unforgettable experience. Love of sharing music has taken Nathan & Jessie all over the world, frequenting places like Mexico, Canada, France, New Orleans, and the Pacific North West. The upbeat tunes they write reflect the cultural, emotional, and inspirational images of their life experience and are rooted in the spirit of jazz, improvisation, storytelling, language, and humor.\n\nMatt Watroba has been voice of folk music in Michigan for his work with WDET--Detroit Public Radio. As producer and host of the Folks Like Us program, and the nationally syndicated, Sing Out Radio Magazine and Folk Alley, Watroba has encountered many aspects of folk music and culture that have shaped a repertoire and presentation unique to stages across the country. He is committed to inspiring the world to sing-- one town at a time. With his life-long musical partner Robert Jones, he started the Detroit non-profit Common Chords in 2019, and that same year was inducted into the Folk DJ Hall of Fame at the Folk Alliance International conference in Montreal. He is a regular teacher and performer at the Swannanoa Gathering in North Carolina. He believes in the power and good vibrations of singing together, harmonizing and feeling each otherâs voices, and he preaches that gospel wherever he goes.\n\nDirk Powell plays fiddle, banjo and guitar; Cedric Watson plays fiddle and accordion. Both sing.\n\nDirk Powell has expanded on the deeply rooted sounds of his Appalachian heritage to become one of the preeminent traditional American musicians of his generation. In addition to acclaimed releases on Rounder Records, heâs recorded and performed with artists such as Loretta Lynn, Sting, Levon Helm, Jewel, T-Bone Burnett, Ralph Stanley, Linda Ronstadt and currently with Joan Baez. As a founding member of Balfa Toujours and long time Louisiana resident Dirk is equally at home playing Cajun music.\n\nSpearheading the emerging generation of Creole musicians, Cedric Watson is a fiddler, vocalist, accordionist and songwriter of enormous talent and potential. Injecting a healthy dose of his own personality and ingenuity, Cedric has been exciting an ever-broadening audience with his unique take on traditional Creole music, and with his new compositions that expand the genre while still respecting its roots. Moving with ease between fiddle and accordion, and adding his strong blues-inflected vocals, Cedricâs creative style and obvious joy in playing make him an engaging and exciting performer.\n\nBaltimore-based acoustic roots quartet Charm City Junction creates a fresh soundscape that keeps listeners on the edge of their seats wondering where they'll go next. They are four of the most talented young musicians in the country: Patrick McAvinue on fiddle, Brad Kolodner on clawhammer banjo, Sean McComiskey on button accordion and Alex Lacquement on upright bass, and are unafraid to take roots music to new places and with the energy to take the audience with them. The ensemble always keeps an eye on tradition as the common threads of Irish, bluegrass and old-time music take flight. Their second album, âDuckpin,â in 2018 charted high among bluegrass albums for the creative mix of instrumental texture and top-notch playing.\n\nBayou Seco, featuring Ken Keppeler and Jeanie McLerie, has been entertaining New Mexico and many parts of the world since 1980. Recipients of the 2017 NM Governorâs Award for Excellence in the Arts, Keppeler and McLerie have learned from a number of revered traditional musicians in New Mexico, Louisiana and Arizona (thus, Bayou Seco).\n\nBayou Seco's brand of Southwestern Chilegumbo - Cajun two-steps, waltzes, polkas and rancheras, chotis's, meringues and huapangos, and, perhaps a broom dance, is cross- cultural, multi-lingual and transcends labels and pigeon holes. Bayou Seco's roots are in the south and southwest, but their branches reach far across the world.\n\nIncorporating the sounds and rhythms of Jewish music from many parts of the world, THE REBBEâS ORKESTRA brings a unique style to Klezmer-the instrumental dance music rooted in the Jewish wedding ceremonies of Eastern Europe. The bandâs repertoire includes instrumental pieces from the Middle-East, and folk songs in several languages including Yiddish (a Germanic rooted language of East European Jews), Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Hebrew, Russian, Arabic, Hungarian, Romanian, and Romany (the language of the Roma/ Gypsies). The band also plays some Israeli folk dance tunes, traditional fiddle tunes and songs from New Mexico, as well as traditional music from the Mediterranean and the Balkans. Recording and performing professionally throughout the southwest since 1996, The Rebbeâs Orkestra has been exploring the ways in which Jewish musicians have interacted with surrounding musical traditions over the centuries. From Spain to Iraq, Poland to the Mediterranean: The Rebbe's Orkestra plays tunes and songs as widely divergent as the geography and yet with surprisingly similar themes.\n\nThe band released its first CD \"Klezmer y mas\" in 2010 to widespread acclaim. In addition to playing for hundreds (maybe thousands by now!!) of weddings and Bânai Mitzvahs, the group has performed at Globalquerque (2006), The Outpost Performance Space-Outpost Productions (1997 & 2004), KlezmerQuerque 2003-2019, The Crestone Music Festival âCrestfestâ 2011 (Crestone, Colorado), The ABQ Folk Festival (1998-2018), and at many other festivals and theaters throughout the southwest including the states of Texas & Arizona.\n\nPerforming for schools, universities, senior centers and community centers, The Rebbe's Orkestra also gives fun educational presentations. Band members give brief introductions to each song about its history, source(s), pertinence to Jewish culture and other cultures, its musical arrangement, as well as teaching simple lyrics and rhythms to sing and clap along. Adding to the participation level, the band can bring a dance leader to teach the simple line and circle dances that traditionally accompany the music.\n\nHigher Ground Bluegrass has established itself as a premier Bluegrass band in New Mexico and is venturing into their 25th year as a musical ensemble. Founder âDukeâ Weddington plays banjo, guitar and sings; Dave Devlin plays mandolin and resophonic guitar; Pat Mahoney sings and plays fiddle; bass player Laura Leach-Devlin and guitarist Ben Monroe also sing. The bandâs repertoire features their own original material but also plays traditional and contemporary selections influenced by folk, Celtic, country, and rock ân roll. They work at developing dynamic arrangements of their original material and adding their own take to standard bluegrass numbers and lesser-known songs. Four vocalists enable the band to trade lead and harmony lines to offer a dynamic program.\n\nThe band has recorded nine independent albums, and opened for Peter Rowan, Tim OâBrien, Frank Solivan and Dirty Kitchen, Jim Lauderdale, and The Infamous Stringdusters. The band served as host band for the Southwest Pickers Bluegrass and Traditional Music Festival from 2017 to 2021.\n\nOtilio Ruiz was born in Pacho Nuevo, Veracruz in Mexico. He started singing at the age of five and he picked up his first instrument at the age of 11. Later he learned and studied guitar, viola, violin and most other instruments with strings at the Music Conservatory in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico. In 1989, he was part of a folk group to tour Europe with the Achille Zavata Circus based in Paris and later performed with the international company Tlen-Huicani, at the University of Veracruz, and traveled with them through the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and South America. He began a career in education in 2004 at Bernalillo Public Schools and in 2009 transferred to Albuquerque Public Schools at Coronado School where he had the opportunity to form a children's group, Voces De Coronado. He is the recipient of a Creative Bravos Award.\n\nChuy Martinez is a skilled musician and natural storyteller. As a migrant farm worker, he grew up all over the United States. He joined the United Farm Workers Union, met Cesar Chavez and was inspired by the work he and Dolores Huerta were doing to represent the workers in the field. When he moved to Albuquerque he became a community organizer, taking what he learned from Chavez and the union to help bring about change. He remains active in the community and is a guest presenter with the New Mexico Humanities Council.\n\nOti moved from Veracruz to Albuquerque in 2001. He met Chuy few days after that. They started playing together and have ever since.\n\nThe Virginia Creepers play old-time music. Formed in New Mexico 30 years ago, the band is drawn to weird, old, crooked tunes from exotic places like West Virginia and Kentucky, lively dance tunes that they play for squares and contras, and songs about hard times, trains, and whiskey, all ranging in age from the Civil War era and earlier to newer pieces in the old-time style. The Creepers are: Rick Olcott on guitar, Laurie Phillips on mandola, Jane Phillips on fiddle, Marc Robert on bass and banjo, and Michel Robert on fiddle. All of them sing now and then. Based in Albuquerque, they play around NM and beyond for dances, parties, and festivals, and as soothing background music for the quiet and studious patrons of saloons and taverns. The Creepers hosted a weekly old-time jam at Tractor Brewing in Nob Hill for over 7 years, until the pandemic shutdowns. They have continued the tradition with virtual jam-along sessions on Facebook Live, racking up over 50 of them by the beginning of 2022.\n\nThe Here and Now are Chris Buckley and Niamh Fahy on fiddle, Rob Forkner on bodhran, and Joseph Carmichael on guitar. Based in Texas, this fine young band of Celtic musicians is comprised of musicians who have played with many well-known groups, such as Riverdance, John Williams, John Williams, Solas and Needfire, and all have studied with legendary Irish musicians in both the U.S. and Ireland.\n\nChris Buckley studied viola at the University of Minnesota and Irish fiddle from greats Liz Carroll, Brendan Mulvhill and James Kelly.

We are an Albuquerque-based musical group that has played together in different configurations for over 30 years. We perform U.S. and Latin American folk music with tight harmonies, spicy riffs, and upbeat rhythms on string, wind and percussion instruments. We often take favorites written by other composers and adapt our own words or make the songs bilingual. We also host peÃ±as (cultural coffeehouses) in Albuquerque and play at political and social events. Lasotras are Enrique Cardiel (bass, accordion and vocals), Teresa Guevara BeltrÃ¡n (cuatro, jarana, guitar, cajÃ³n, bombo, and vocals), Ricardo Magallanes GuillÃ©n (guitar, zampoÃ±as/panpipes, bombo, maracas and vocals), Dair Obenshain (fiddle, guitar, bongÃ³s, bones, bass and vocals) and Ruth Warner Carrillo (cuatro, jarana, charango, guitar, bongÃ³s and vocals).\n\nSnorty Horse is Mike Fraser, fiddle and mandolin, Tenley Fraser, guitar, piano and fiddle, Dave Para, banjo and guitar, and Erika Gerety, bass. They all sing. They first came together to play contra dances in Missouri, and featured Daveâs late wife, Cathy Barton, on hammered dulcimer and banjo. Later they did some stage performances that included harmony singing. They took their name from a saloon which they thought had closed down on Interstate 70 in Missouri. Kind of a joke, but no one came up with a better name. They were good friends with Erika and her late husband, Gary, from camping together at the festival in Winfield, Kansas. Erika joined the band after Cathyâs passing and Dave and Erika got married here in Albuquerque. Dave plays more banjo now in addition to his lively back-up guitar style, and Erika has added her solid bass playing and expressive singing voice. Mike and Tenley also play as the duo Shortleaf. They all share a love for traditional music and its cultural contexts and history, working out harmonies and the joy of making a big sound for an evening dance.\n\nBaltimore-based acoustic roots quartet Charm City Junction creates a fresh soundscape that keeps listeners on the edge of their seats wondering where they'll go next.

Their initial musical preference consisted of Old Timey fiddle music, Bluegrass, and folk music of North America, but has subsequently expanded to include Western Swing, Celtic, blues, Klezmer and whatever else might be fun to play. The Brothers refer to their music as âInternational Bluegrassâ and proclaim themselves the progenitors of this genre.\n\nTheir fundamental musical philosophy is âif itâs fun and sounds good, weâll play it.â Their song/tune list has over 200 titles in it and during a concert theyâll often draw from hundreds of other pieces that they forgot to add to the list.\n\nJanice Belflower is an expressive singer-songwriter who pours her heart into her lyrics and her melodies. She grew up singing in church with a background in classical piano music, but in college, she studied and performed jazz. She was drawn into folk music by singers like Norah Jones and Joy Williams whose voices invite you into their stories as they sing. Janiceâs sound reflects a combination of folk, pop, and jazz paired with intimate stories and warm vocals. Having traveled the world and lived in both smaller American towns and big international cities, her view of the world was expanded beyond the culture she grew up with. While Janiceâs music is deeply personal, it is informed through the beauty of learning many cultures and stories, and she hopes to invite whoever listens into the broader community that music creates.\n\nEileen & the In-Betweens is a celebrated social justice folk band based in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Edible Magazine (late summer 2017 issue) featured front-woman Eileen O'Shaughnessy as one of New Mexico's top talented songwriters and in the words of Albuquerque Magazine: \"[Eileen] sings with a warm and sunny confidence that makes you believe that however dark things may look, there is a path forward to the light.\" They have released four full-length albums of original music and have been invited to perform their uplifting and soulful music across the U.S., Canada, and Europe. Their energetic performances feature diverse instrumentation and leave audiences inspired and enthralled. The band is made up of Albuquerque's finest musicians: Lazarus Letcher on viola, Colin Baillio on upright bass & pedal steel, Stef Graner on keys and vocals, and Jackie ChacÃ³n on drums. Eileen's songwriting draws on the age-old tradition of mobilizing music as a tool for social change in line with the \"greats\" such as Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, while her enchanting voice draws comparisons to Natalie Merchant, Ani DiFranco, and Edie Brickell. Eileen draws sonic inspiration from her Irish-American & Celtic heritage, folk roots, Americana, pop, and world music.\n\nAlbuquerque's award-winning Indie Folk FranÃ§ais duo, BÃ©bÃ© La La features singer-songwriter, guitarist, violist Alicia Ultan and singer-songwriter, accordionist Maryse Lapierre, who hails from Quebec, Canada. The two formed the group in 2010, combining Lapierre's French influences with Ultan's original folk inspired \"art\" songs and over the years, they have developed a unique and engaging repertoire that highlights their signature \"stunning\" harmonies. Adding to their already richly textured music, are BÃ©bÃ© La La Band members, bassist Micky Patten, an in-demand bassist and guitarist, who also performs with the renowned trumpeter, Bobby Shew, among other ensembles, and drummer Joe Chellman, who plays everything from rock & roll to jazz, blues, country, folk, pop, Klezmer, Balkan, Irish and more. BÃ©bÃ© La La earned three nominations and two awards at the 2016 New Mexico Music Awards for their debut release, \"High Wire,\" described by music and art writer James Mahoney as: \"Wild-Alternative-Magic! Hearing this music is, strangely, like opening up a new set of Tarot cards--with very new images: wild re-structurings of the dramas in each of the cards, so that both vital mystery and authentic emotion--along with a symbol system--are all living together in an advanced beauty.\" This past November 2022, they released their sophomore release, \"A Curious Series of Unexpected Events,\" to a full house in a CD Release concert celebration at FUSION Theatre in Albuquerque, presented by AMP Concerts. The new album received seven nominations from the New Mexico Music Awards, including \"Rosie,\" which won the Singer-Songwriter award and \"Magic Hour\" which received the award for Best Vocal Performance. An overarching theme of \"time\" and the unexpectedness of life threads the eclectic collection of songs together on the new CD, which addresses some of the events of the past few years, personal struggles and more, Poet T.A. Niles writes, \"From where I sit, âA Curious Series of Unexpected Events is an album for our times, of times past, and it seeks to will us into a more magical future.â\n\nRio Grande Jazz Society is an Albuquerque organization dedicated to the preservation and promulgation of classic New Orleans style jazz first popularized a hundred years ago and still played at Preservation Hall in New Orleans today. For the past thirty years, our group has hosted monthly jazz jams, open to the public and welcoming all musicians, at the Edelweiss German-American Club on the third Sunday afternoon of every month. In addition, our monthly jams often feature a paid local group that plays in the jazz, big band, or swing style. The venue has a dance floor, and our jams are popular with local dancers interested in these styles of music. We also play around town at various events, giving our members a chance to play this classic lively music for the public.\n\nMembers include Jeff Johnston, Casey DenHollander, Tom Hunter, Rose Day, Orion Brady, Larry Claussen, and others.\n\nApple Mountain Strings & Things (AMS&T) is a not-for-profit organization formed in 1996 to promote folk music and fun! Bimonthly Club meetings provide a safe, casual environment in which beginning players can enjoy making music with others and hone their skills, and where players at all skill levels can enjoy well-loved folk tunes with new friends. Players of all ages on any acoustic instrument may join the Club and non-members are welcome to play along, too. Anyone who wants just to visit and listen is also welcome. Instruments have included mountain dulcimer, hammered dulcimer, folk harp, fiddle, cello, guitar, banjo, mandolin, bowed psaltery, bodhran, flute, recorder, and harmonica, plus the occasional spoons, kazoo, wash tub bass, bells and triangle! In addition to our regular Club meetings, we often perform at local nursing homes, community centers, schools and festivals. We meet on the first and third Saturday of each month, 3:00-4:30 PM, in the Adult Education Wing of the Heights Cumberland Presbyterian Church.\n\nThis group of folk singers formed 23 years ago with the intention of singing songs from Celtic lands. We share the history behind the songs, and sing phonetically in Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaidhlig, Welsh, Manx, Broad Scots, and English. Our repertoire holds 150 songs, many well-known here in America, as immigrants to North America brought their culture over the ocean. Our group is non-audition, at no cost to members, who are provided with free music and practice CD's. We perform at local festivals, retirement homes, and other events. We meet on the 2nd and 4th Sundays each month, at the ABQ Peace and Justice Center. For more information, contact Michele Buchanan at tmbuchs@gmail.com"
