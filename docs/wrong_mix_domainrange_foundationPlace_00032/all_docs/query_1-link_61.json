        "text": "FEAR\n\nWhat do you do in the moments after you have killed an unarmed Black man? Yvette Janine Jackson’s Fear Is Their Alibi emerged from an event experienced by poet Jarita Davis and is a meditation on the pervasive mindset held by those we may call neighbors, colleagues, family, or friends.\n\nMolly Joyce’s Out of a Thought is motivated by a fear of the unknown, particularly in 2020 and how the unknown body, place, object, and more has motivated mass movement, uncertainty, and challenge.\n\nJoel Thompson’s Clairvoyance is an exploration of fear, paralysis, wonder, and the liminal space between these three states of being. From the first note to the last, the piece proposes that love is the key to seeing our past, present, and future selves with clarity.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nJuhi Bansal’s lush music is inspired by teenage Muslim girls in the Bangladesh Girls Surf Club in Waves of Change. As they master their surfboards and the force of the ocean, we experience their soaring feelings of burgeoning independence and freedom.\n\nPaul Pinto’s first collaboration with video designer/director Kameron Neal, Whiteness: Blanc contemplates whiteness from the perspective of a brown American man. This compelling work utilizes micro pop songs and biting wit to skewer common racial assumptions.\n\nJojo Abot’s interdisciplinary vibrant work The Divine I Am invites us into a natural world, which we learn we must care for or face the consequences. Her work centers on offering of self as a gift of grace.\n\nAngélica Negrón’s engaging collaboration with singer Lido Pimienta and illustrator Mariela Pabon, Ostra Cosa (something else), explores their personal experiences of prejudice as Latinas using pulsating electronics, dark humor and samples from Latin pop hits.\n\nISOLATION\n\nIranian-American composer Sahba Aminikia explores isolation through a lens of being at home through his piece Ayene (mirror). Having grown up in post-revolutionary wartime in Iran, and seeing the restrictions placed on people on the streets of Tehran, Sahba sees being at home both as a place that allows for the fullest expression of individualism, as well as a refuge from violence outside the door.\n\nKorean-American experimental composer Bora Yoon created a sonic and visual collage that interprets and reflects upon isolation as inaction. Drawing on texts from environmental and racial protests from around the world, The Life of the World to Come weaves a thread of questioning inaction as the most dire form of isolation.\n\nComposer Jimmy Bellido López collaborated with librettist Mark Campbell and mezzosoprano Sasha Cooke to create Where Once We Sang, a prayer-like song that looks past this moment of isolation and to a brighter future when artists can flock back to theaters and concert halls to perform for live audiences. The video, directed by Kevin Newbury, drew together a number of artists as they waited at the stage door, hoping to be allowed back in very soon.\n\nDaniel Bernard Roumain has created a deeply personal piano/vocal work that examines the isolation of mental illness in I Have Nothing to Do Except Love. Drawing from being witness to someone close to him who suffers from a degenerative brain disease, and seeing how it affects both one’s internal and external life, Roumain collaborated with singer Minna Choi and director Dana Greenfield to evoke the sense of both elements through music, text and dance.\n\nDiné artist Raven Chacon created a work around the idea of an older Navajo woman speaking to her younger self with La Indita Cautiva. Created in collaboration with lyricist and performer Nacha Mendez, the sonic and visual worlds evoke a specific time and place, and the wistfulfeelings of loss, regret, and joy.\n\nJOJO ABOT is a nomadic interdisciplinary artist exploring evolving themes of spirituality, identity and community with self as the starting point to collective evolution. With an exciting, budding career, Abot has toured with Ms. Lauryn Hill, played stages like Afropunk, Roots Picnic, Radio City Music Hall, The Apollo, Kennedy Center, and more while being the first unsigned artist to perform live for NYC’s Times Square New Year’s Eve Concert to over a million people.An Alumni of the New Museum’s Incurbator Program, New Inc, and Former Resident at National Sawdust, Abot continues to develop and present her interdisciplinary practice through power to the God within and other curatorial projects.\n\nSAHBA AMINIKIA is an Iranian American composer currently based in San Francisco, California Aminikia, has received his early training in Piano from revered Iranian pianists such as Nikan Milani, Safa Shahidi, and started composing under his first composition teacher, Mehran Rouhani.
