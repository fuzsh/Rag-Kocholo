Carlos Cox was a ship's carpenter, born in England. He had a wife and 2 children, and chose to leave East Florida. The records don't say where he went. A Charles Cox, possibly the same one, got a 250-acre grant in 1774 on Turkey Creek of the Salkehatchie River (in the Barnwell end of Orangeburgh District). He was not listed in the military records on either side. There's an undated petition to the SC House of Representatives related to the question. If you search the SCDAH index site for <Jennings, Artimas> (spelled that way), it will be the only hit. The year was 1820, since the committee response to the petition is dated 13 Dec 1820. The online document was hard for me to read, but I could see that the title/description was misleading. The petition was submitted by John Cox, William Sumter, Artimas Jennings, James E. Bowdoin and Eliza [Jennings] his wife, Warren Jennings, Mary Jennings, Franklin Jennings and Derril Jennings. Their brother, Charles Cox, had recently died intestate. (He's the one buried in 1819 near Gideon and Ann Jennings.) Charles Cox was a natural child of Mrs. Ann Jennings, \"late of the District of Orangeburgh and now deceased\" The law said that property of an illegitimate child escheated to the state, and did not go to his siblings or half-siblings in the absence of a will. The petitioners asked that they be permitted to inherit the \"Small Real and Personal estate\" of their brother Charles Cox. The legislative response is indexed at SCDAH, but has no online image There is a fair chance that the maiden name of Ann (wife of Gideon Jennings) was Cox, rather than Bonsall or Brown. If the latter alternatives first appeared in the mid-20th century, it was a time when nobody would have wanted to look at documents filed under \"Bastardy; Escheats\". The family story about the Englishman who drowned near St. Augustine might possibly refer to Ann's father, rather than to a first husband.

Many people likely travelled from South Carolina to Mississippi via the \"Old Federal Road\". In Alabama the road (originally just a path) extended from western Georgia west-southwest across southern Alabama to old Fort Stoddert just west of the Alabama-Mobile-Tensaw Rivers system. Believe me, that river swamp is a major obstacle (I spent a couple of weeks in the middle of that mess as a young geologist \"sitting\" a deep oil exploration well back in the 70's). If you have a chance cross it someday on I-65. The road basically connected higher ground east of the river system around old Fort Mims in Baldwin County, AL to Fort Stoddert (current Mount Vernon, Alabama area) in Mobile County. It had to have been a perilous and exhausting journey. In Alabama, Auburn University is researching the route of the old road. From Fort Stoddert the road went approximately due west into Greene County, MS (some of that area I think later became part of Perry County, MS ?). There are some very generalized maps of the old road system in Alabama and Mississippi. I am unaware of what the extent of the roads were across Georgia and South Carolina. I don't know the exact dates of when the Jennings, Cox, Funchess, family members and others left Orangeburg, but I do know that my direct line ancestor, Franklin Henry Dana Jennings, was still a boy in the early 1820's, his father, Gideon Jennings having passed away in 1814 and his mother Ann the following year (she was only about 46 at her death, if memory serves). The Mississippi Territory (Alabama + Mississippi) was frontier land. Unfortunately, not enough people care about their family history (or any history for that matter) to hold on to accounts, Bibles, etc. I have personally found family Bibles to be treasure troves, sometimes contradicting misinformation that gets into census records and now considered \"fact\".

Thank you. Stephen P. Jennings.\n\nStarted by Steve Jennings @ · Most recent @\n\nModerated Isler, Izlar, Easler 5\n\nThe Jacob Isler who lived in Orangeburgh has been correctly identified, by Cary Allen, as the one baptized in parish Guttannen, Bern, on 10 Jan 1739, son of Barbara Horger. His father, Heinrich Isler, remained in parish Uster, Zürich, having tried to disclaim paternity. Barbara brought son Jacob with her to Orangeburgh in 1742, on Peter Huber's return trip. In the past, a number of different Isler/Easler family members developed a theory for their immigrant ancestor(s) involving a 1734 emigration, death of both parents on the ship St. Andrew, and other details about the family of a Jacob Isler, shoemaker of Wildberg in Zürich. (The Jacob Isler who left there in 1734 was a tailor.) Part of the story involved a second hypothetical son for Jacob Isler and Zibilla Wolf, a boy named Tobias. Their identified son, Jacob (Jr.), b. ~1767, left a large Izlar family in Orangeburg Co SC. Tobias Easler of Fairfield/Kershaw Co was attached as a son on the basis of no other likely Isler candidates in SC. However, the lack of candidates applied only for researchers who know how to spell. The documents of colonial South Carolina are not user-friendly for good spellers. Tobias Easler certainly appears to have been born in the Dutch Fork in ~1755 to a father named Hans/John. At the time of Tobias's birth, Jacob Isler (Sr.) was an unmarried teenager in Orangeburgh Township. *2 Jan 1753. John Ischelin arrived on the ship Upton, Capt. Alex'r Gardener, with his wife and a daughter Maria Barbara, aged about 3. He was indentured to Daniel Horry, but now discharged; he petitioned for 150 acres plus the Bounty of Provision. The next petition was from John Nagel, also from the ship Upton and indentured to Horry, who had a wife and a daughter Margaretha about 10. Petitions in the following month included future neighbors Jacob Haltiwanger (on the ship Elizabeth, with a wife and 2 children, including daughter Angelica age 8) and John Swygert (also on the ship Elizabeth, with a wife and 3 children, including son John George age 9). *17 Jun 1753. Deputy Surveyor John Pearson laid out the plat of 150 acres for John Ischolin (indexed as \"Ischolm\" at SCDAH). It was on the southwest bank of the Broad River, with the mouth of Wateree Creek at its northern corner. The land of John Nagel (shipmate and apparent friend) adjoined the tract on its southeast. The grant was issued on 4 Jul 1743 (indexed as \"Ischolm\"). The location was in Lexington Co SC at its formation, in a part later annexed by Richland Co. It is across the Broad River from Fairfield Co, not far above the mouth of the Little River. *25 Mar 1773. The ownership of the John Ischelin grant had changed by 1773, when a plat of 100 acres for \"Angell Waldawanger\" was laid out to its southwest. Angelica Halldenwanger (b. 26 Nov 1799 in Söhnstetten, Württemberg) had married Hans Georg Schweikart (b. 13 May 1742), but her maiden name was the one under which she qualified for a Bounty grant. The land between Angell and the Broad River was identified as \"Tobias Eisla's Land\". No sale had taken place, so Tobias Eisla/Eisler was apparently the oldest son and heir of John Ischelin. He was born after Ischelin arrived in America, but probably not long afterwards. In the 1830 census of Fairfield Co SC (also enumerated in Kershaw Co), he reported his age as 70<80; therefore, he was born between 1753 (year of father's land petition) and 1760 (latest birth year in which he could reach age 70 by 1830). A man had to be age 21 in order to purchase land, but could acquire the title via inheritance at a younger age. *25 Oct - 24 Dec 1781. Muster of company of Lt. Col. Alexander Innes, SC Royalists, at Quarter House SC. Private #7 is Tobias Ishley. Serjeant George Swigart (neighbor at Wateree Creek) of the same company, but a prisoner of the rebels.

Andrew Wirosdick (bp 10 Jun 1751) married Elizabeth Syfrett (daughter of Alexander) on 24 Mar 1771 at St. John's Lutheran in Charlestown. By the 1800 census, he was a widower with a small boy (John, b. 1794<1800). Between 1800 and 1810, he had 3 more sons by another wife. In 1810, her census age group was 26<45 (born 1765<85); in 1820, she was still in the 26<45 age group (born 1775<95). So Margaret Zimmerman, if the name is correctly reported, was born between 1775 and 1785. That's young enough to have the 3 Wirosdick boys. A woman born in 1757 would be extremely unlikely to have any children if she married in 1800 at age 43. Nearly all colonial women aged 40+ were postmenopausal. The Zimmermans of Orangeburg relocated there starting in 1764, having settled first in 1752 on a branch of Cannon's Creek of the Broad River, in what would become Newberry Co SC. The branch kept the name \"Zimmerman's Branch\" through the early 19th century--it was spelled \"Timmerman's\" on the 1825 Mills Atlas. The OGSGS First Families page covers some early members of this Zimmerman family, starting with immigrant brothers Martin and Michael. They lived in St. Matthew's Parish (current Calhoun Co, near the line with Orangeburg). The 1800 census entries for St. Matthew's were not preserved, so there's no way to see which Zimmerman household included a woman of the right age to marry Andrew Wirosdick a few years later. In 1790, there were 5 Zimmerman households listed for Orangeburg. Those were widow Margaret (possibly wife of Michael, b. 1725--he died between Jan 1783 and Feb 1786, per A.A. 8887), John (b. ~1742), Boston (Sebastian, b. 1749), Henry (b. 1755<65, oldest son of Michael), and Adam (b. 1765<75). Each of those households included an unmarried female who might possibly have married Andrew Wirosdick after 1800. A German-language genealogy forum, Ahnenforschung.Net Forum, recently added information about the origin of the Orangeburg Zimmermans--search on <Zimmermann auf Walldorf>. Ernst Jost Zimmermann and Anna Eva Bader had 10 children in the village of Reilingen, Heidelberg District, Baden. Those included Johann Martin (born 10 Sep 1706) and Johann Michael (born 17 Jul 1725). Joh. Martin Zimmermann married Anna Catharina MNU and moved to the adjacent village of Walldorf, parish Wiesloch (Lutheran). They had a daughter Eva Elisabetha (26 Feb 1732), another child (Dec 1734, not named), another Eva Elisabetha (24 Jan 1746 - 29 Jul 1748), and Sebastian (30 Jun 1749 - Jun 1799 in St. Matthew's SC). The baptism of son Johannes (b. ~1742) was not recorded in the extant Walldorf records. Martin Zimmermann of Walldorf and Michael Zimmermann of Reilingen both got permission to emigrate in 1752. The First Families history takes it from their arrival on the ship Cunliffe. The family may possibly have kept in touch with a cousin who became famous. Joh. Heinrich Zimmermann, b. 25 Dec 1741 in Walldorf to Joh. Heinrich and Anna Maria Zimmermann, left for England where he joined Captain Cook's third expedition and published its history. The account was very widely read. Tiny Walldorf had a second internationally-known resident: John Jacob Astor was born there on 17 Jul 1763. Walldorf and Reilingen are each ~20 km north of Bruchsal, also in the Heidelberg District. The Wirosdicks lived in Bruchsal, a day's walk from the Zimmermanns back in Baden. They probably didn't know one another, since the Zimmermanns were Lutheran and the Wirosdicks were Catholic. They'd\n\nStarted by B. Davine Roberts @ · Most recent @\n\nModerated How to spell Zimmermann 5\n\nThe Zimmermann spelling wasn't consistent throughout the province. We don't know how many people may have anglicized it to Carpenter on arrival (as Abraham Kauffman of Newberry became Chapman). The Zimmermanns who arrived in 1765 with other settlers of Hardlabour Creek in Edgefield used the sharper \"Tz\" pronunciation of the initial consonant, and became Timmermans, which they still are. Except for the occasional 18th-century spelling as \"Timberman\". This makes perfectly good sense, since timber is what wood becomes by the time it reaches the carpenter. The initial letter <T> also looked a great deal like an <L>, so there's the occasional reading as Limberman or Lumberman. Lumber, timber, carpenter, whatever... However, Johannes Lumberland of Lexington Co was not a Zimmermann--he was a Kommerlander/Comalander, etc. The spelling, transcription and indexing variants can get frustrating, but there's no reason not to enjoy them whenever we can. Did Michael Bedenbach ever find out that his land petition was written as \"Pitebog\"? Or Ulrich Brunner of Orangeburgh, hiding under a grant to Willrick Prun?

However Philip's death Certificate states he was born in 1841. Also next to Philip is Rachel U(rsula Fanning) Carson who is age 55 and she is the widow of James Peter Carson who died in VA in the civil war in 1863 according to some trees. Now if you look at the 1850 Slave Schedule for Orangeburg SC for J. Carson (indexed as I Carson), he has 2 enslaved persons, a female aged 27 and a male aged 9. This could be Satira and her son Philip. In 1860 James P. Carson is listed with a female aged 38 (could be Satira) and 2 females 15 and 13 (the male is no longer here), However, 3 listings away is a Wm G. W. Pou who has 16 enslaved persons.

His parents are listed as Isaac Sinne and Sotara Pou. The information was John Carson in Neese SC on the last one. With Phillip W. Carson being the informant on the first death certificate, he likely knew his mother's maiden name and was given her surname at birth. He was likely born out of wedlock so not given the Sinne surname. If you look at the 1870 census, Philip Carson is 27 years old and living next to James Pou and Satira and their children. If you look into the Freedmen's Bureau Records. There is an Isaac Senn who has a contract to work for William H. Dantzler in 1866 for one year. On a separate record there is a Satira listed as working for 1 year for Mr. E. S. Thomsen. There is no last name given for her. I would definitely look into Senn as another possibly spelling.

Margaret's book covers only 1735 immigrants from all over the Palatine Region and Switzerland and others, but your line was likely later so would not be included. I started researching genealogy in 1988-1989 period and it was not until 2015 that I found the origins of the Huttos in Europe. I went there several times in the years following to verify the information I had found then started writing my book. Perhaps you should start a new thread with your oldest documented ancestors. Tell everyone who they are, when and where they were born, who are their documented or suspected children, where did they own land, etc? That might help you find others who have a common line with you. Have you DNA tested and found any matches in the Orangeburgh DNA project with those common ancestors? Do you have any males that have Y-DNA tested? That would help find matching males with same or similar surnames. You should find males with Götz, Gatz, Gates, Kitts, etc. to definitely y-DNA test and see if they match. All My Best Joel On 8/29/2023 10:55 AM, B.

Does anybody on here descend from them? I am interested in what part of Baden Wurtenberg, Germany (close to the Swiss border) came from to Orangeburgh. I have an opportunity to go on a trip to this part of Germany next year, and I am trying my best to find the community in which they lived before I leave so I can visit the church which holds their records.

Davine Roberts @ · Most recent @\n\nModerated another genealogy resource - Loyds List 5\n\nHere is another good resource if you know the ship and year of your ancestor’s emigration. I learned of this from another post with this group an am repeating it because it was so helpful to me. The easiest way start your search on Loyds List is at https://www.maritimearchives.co.uk/lloyds-list.html Unfortunately the years start at 1741 but it worked for me. On the right of the page, clicking the year you want will link you to the proper year on https://babel.hathitrust.org You can then search in the document for the ship. It’s a lot of trouble but if this is the information you want, it’s well worth it. I had often wondered if there was any documents showing exactly when my ancestors, like thousands of others, began the journey from Germany then to Rotterdam and then from Cowes on the Isle of Wight to the colonies. In my case, the Schneider families were going to Philadelphia on the ship St. Andrew but through extenuating circumstances, landed at Charles Town. I found all the dates I wanted on the Lloyd’s List, Sailings of ships. Mine was the St. Andrew in 1744 . For example, Captain Brown Master of the St. Andrew sails from Cowes to Rotterdam to pick up his German emigrant cargo which included the Schneider brothers and their families. May 28, 1744 as listed on page #276 https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015028378951&view=1up&seq=276&q1=St.%20Andrew Hope this information helps someone, Dewey Snyder arrival Advertisement in ‘The South Carolina Gazette’ January 1745\n\nStarted by Dewey Snyder @ · Most recent @\n\nModerated genealogy resource 2\n\nI would like to share a genealogy resource I recently found on the Internet. https://ken-shelton.com/ There you will find among other things, early South Carolina tax lists, quit rent lists and early grant plats.\n\nStarted by Dewey Snyder @ · Most recent @\n\nModerated The Passing of Al Brodie of Perry, SC 2\n\nIt is with great sadness to share with this group that Al Brodie (90 years old) of Perry, SC, passed away on June 28, 2023. His obituary can be found at this site, https://www.blizzardfuneralhome.com/obituary/RevAlbertAl-BrodieJr. He was a great genealogist, historian and friend. I first connected with Al over 10 years ago tracking down a Seiger/Zeigler book written by Margaret Diacetis. He share some pages with me and from that time until his passing we have been friends. I would stop by and visit with him on some of my trips to Orangeburg over the years. He gave me a copy of each of 3 books he had written that mentioned Holmans and Tylers. His last great help to me was his locating in 2017 the current owner of the Busbee-Holman Family Bible that was an enormous help. He knew the brothers and got them to make photos and send to me. In just our short time of knowing each other, he was one of the nicest and friendliest person I have met. He was always willing to help. RIP Al Brodie.
