Still for Der Alte Fritz/The Old Fritz (1928, Gerhard Lamprecht) with Otto Gebuhr as Friedrich II.\n\nGerman actor Otto Gebuhr (1877 – 1954) appeared in 102 films between 1917 and 1962 (!). He is best known for his interpretation of Friedrich II (Frederick the Great), a role he played in 16 films and countless stage performances. He was one the most famous actors of the Weimar period, and thanks to his authoratitive roles the Nazis gave him the title Actor of the State.\n\nOtto Gebuhr was born in 1877, Kettwig (now Essen), Germany. He was the son of merchant Otto Gebuhr and his wife Fanny Mathilde, nee Moll. He grew up in Hulsenbusch, a part of Gummersbach, and after his father’s death in Koln (Cologne). After attending gymnasium he had a trade training at a wool firm. In 1896 he worked as a correspondent in foreign languages for a firm in Berlin, but he also had acting classes. For a while he then worked as a strolling actor till he got a contract at the Stadttheater Gorlitz. From 1898 till 1908 he worked at the Koniglichen Hoftheater in Dresden, and till 1914 at the Lessingtheater and the Theater in der Koniggratzer Stra?e, both in Berlin. During the First World War he was an army volunteer for the field artillery regiment and became a second lieutenant. After this he worked from 1917 till 1919 for famous director Max Reinhardt at the Deutschen Theater in Berlin. At the same time he began to appear in films. His film debut was Der Richter/The Judge (1917, Hans Land) for the Messter company. Gebuhr was a look-a-like of king Friedrich II (1712-1786), and ‘Friedrich dem Gro?en’ would become his role of a lifetime. Introduced by his colleague Paul Wegener, director Carl Boese cast him as the king of Prussia in the silent film Die Tanzerin Barberina (1920, Carl Boese). The role would become his breakthrough. He would play Friedrich several times, but initially in the very successful, four-part-film-series Fridericus Rex (1920-1923). To his other well-known silent films belong the crime film Whitechapel (1920, Ewald Andre Dupont), the worldwide success Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam/The Golem: How He Came Into the World (1920, Carl Boese, Paul Wegener), Wilhelm Tell (1923, Rudolf Dworsky, Rudolf Walther-Fein), Die Perucke/The Wig (1925, Berthold Viertel), Die Gesunkenen/The Sunken (1925, Rudolf Walther-Fein, Rudolf Dworsky) and Waterloo (1928, Karl Grune).\n\nAfter the introduction of the sound film, Otto Gebuhr again had a huge success as the king of Prussia in Flotenkonzert in Sanssouci/The Flute Concert of Sans-Souci (1930, Gustav Ucicky). He repeats his role in Die Tanzerin von Sanssouci/Barberina (1932, Friedrich Zelnik) at the side of Lil Dagover and Hans Stuwe. He was the cinematic incarnation of the heroic prussian. His type was popular during the Third Reich. Gebuhr was a voluntarily pawn in the propaganda machine of the Nazis and appeared in several films, including Fridericus (1937, Johannes Meyer) with Lil Dagover, as the ‘First National Socialist’, like propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had called him. In 1938 he gave Gebuhr the titel Staatsschauspieler (Actor of the State). He is then one of the four highest paid and most famous actors of Germany (the others were Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers and Heinrich George). Among his entertainment films were Der Choral von Leuthen/The Anthem of Leuthen (1933, Carl Froelich, Arzen von Cserepy) with Olga Tschechowa, Nanon (1938, Herbert Maisch) with Johannes Heesters, and Casanova heiratet/Casanova Marries (1939, Viktor de Kowa), big hits. Some of his roles, like Blucher in Waterloo (1928) and the king of Saxony in Bismarck (1940, Wolfgang Liebeneiner), had the same authoritative features as Friedrich II. He again appeared as Friedrich II in Veit Harlan’s epic Der gro?e Konig/The Great King (1942, Veit Harlan). Till the end of the Third Reich he appeared in more light entertainment films like Immensee (1943, Veit Harlan) starring Kristina Soderbaum and Carl Raddatz, Die goldene Spinne/The Golden Spider (1943, Erich Engels), and Der Erbforster/The Hereditary Forester (1945, Alois Johannes Lippl).\n\nFrom 1947 on Otto Gebuhr was permitted to work again in the theatre. His first post-war film was the drama …und uber uns der Himmel/ …and the Sky Above Us (1947, Josef von Baky) starring Hans Albers. Till his death he appeared in many entertainment films. He played the odd companion or the cheerful senile maverick in such Heimatfilms as Melodie des Schicksals/Melody of Destiny (1950, Hans Schweikart) with Brigitte Horney, and Grun ist die Heide/The Heath Is Green (1951, Hans Deppe) starring Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack. Again he also appeared under the direction of Veit Harlan in Unsterbliche Geliebte/Immortal Beloved (1951) with Kristina Soderbaum. His final film Die Blonde Frau des Maharadscha/The Blonde Wife of the Maharadja, (1962, Veit H\n\nGerman postcard by Ross Verlag, no. 676/1, 1919-1924. Photo: Decla-Ufa-Film. Publicity still for Die Nibelungen (1924, Fritz Lang).\n\nMargarete Schon (1895 – 1985) is best known for her role as Kriemhild, the beautiful but revengeful princess of Burgundy in Fritz Lang’s silent epic Die Nibelungen (1924). The career of this German stage and film actress spanned nearly fifty years.\n\nMargarete Schon was born as Margarete Schippang in Magdeburg, Germany in 1895. She received private acting lessons with the theatre actor Hans Calm in Dessau. In 1912 she made her stage debut in Bad Freienwalde. Shortly thereafter, she received a commitment at the municipal theatre of Bromberg (now, Bydgoszcz, Poland). From 1915 to 1918 she was part of the ensemble cast of the Deutsches Theater in Hannover, and from 1918 to 1945 she performed at the Staatstheater Berlin (Berlin State Theatre). According to Wikipedia and IMDb, Schon made her film debut in the silent Du meine Himmelskonigin/You are my queen of heaven (1919, Carl Wilhelm). Philippe Pelletier at Cine Artistes and Thomas Staedeli at Cyranos write that her first appearance was a year earlier, in Schirokko (1918, Edmund Heuberger) with Kurt Brenkendorf. She would spend the next years in small roles for directors Carl Froelich, Hanna Henning, and Walter Schmidthassler. She had bigger parts in Die Pflicht zu leben/The obligation to live (1919, Carl Wilhelm) with Reinhold Schunzel, and Die goldene Krone/The Golden Crown (1920, Alfred Halm) starring Henny Porten. She worked several times with the Danish director Robert Dinesen who was her husband at the time. Among their films were Frauen vom Gnadenstein/Women of Gnadenstein (1920, Joe May, Robert Dinesen), and Der Leidensweg der Inge Krafft/Inge Krafft’s Calvary (1921, Robert Dinesen) featuring Mia May. Schon had a leading role as Hannele’s (Margarete Schlegel) mother in the popular drama Hanneles Himmelfahrt/ Hannele’s Ascension (1922, Urban Gad), based on the Traumgedicht (dream poem) by Gerhart Hauptman. For Frederic Zelnik she appeared in Erniedrigte und beleidigte (1922) starring Lya Mara. Then she really became a star after the release of Fritz Lang’s two-part mythical fantasy Die Nibelungen (1924). Lang and his wife at the time, Thea von Harbou, had written a script based on the epic poem Nibelungenlied written around AD 1200. Schon had a starring role as the vengeful Kriemhild, opposite Paul Richter as the epic hero Siegfried. Its success would cement her popularity in Germany and she achieved international recognition as an actress. Strangely, there was not a real follow-up film. She appeared in several unremarkable films and in the more interesting films, like her husband’s Der Weg durch die Nacht/The Way Through the Night (1929, Robert Dinesen), she only had a supporting part.\n\nMargarete Schon made the transition to sound films with ease and through the 1930’s and 1940’s she was a popular character actress. She often portrayed parts as the wife or the mother. For the UFA she played princess Amalie in Das flotenkonzert von Sans-Souci/The Flute Concert of Sans-Souci (1930, Gustav Ucicky) starring Otto Gebuhr as King Frederick II of Prussia, Madame Mercier in the Chopin biography Abschiedswalzer/Farewell Waltz (1934, Geza von Bolvary), and the mother of Ilse Werner in Ihr erstes Erlebnis/Her First Experience (1939, Joseph von Baky). In 1931 she even co-directed a film herself, Schon ist die Manoverzeit/Manoeuver Time Is Fine (1931, Margarete Schon, Erich Schonfelder) with Ida Wust. It would stay her only direction. During the Second World War she appeared in approximately ten films, but generally avoided roles in Nazi propaganda films and stayed decidedly apolitical. One exception was an uncredited bit part in Veit Harlan’s nationalistic film Kolberg (1945, Veit Harlan) starring Heinrich George. One of her most popular roles of the era was the character Frau Knauer opposite Heinz Ruhmann in the classic comedy Die Feuerzangenbowle/The Punch Bowl (1944, Helmut Weiss) for Terra-Filmkunst studios. After the Second World War, Schon worked extensively for the radio and also worked as a voice actor for the synchronisation of foreign films. From 1948 to 1950 she played for the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft (DEFA), the state-owned film studio of East Germany. There she appeared in small roles in such films as Affaire Blum/The Blum Affair (1948, Erich Engel) about an anti-Semitic court case in Weimar Germany, Die blauen Schwerter/The Blue Swords (1949, Wolfgang Schleif) starring Hans Quest as the inventor of blue porcelain, and the biography Semmelweis – Retter der Mutter/Dr. Semmelweis (1950, Georg C. Klaren) with Kathe Braun. Back in West-Germany she had parts in such films as the thriller Rittmeister Wronski/Cavalry Captain Wronski (1954, Ulrich Erfurth) starring Willi Birgel, and Oberwachtmeister Borck/Sergeant Borck (1955, Gerhard Lamprecht). Her last screen appearance was in the TV film Ich r"
