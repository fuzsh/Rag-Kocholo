James Madison, one of America 's founding fathers, first considered the relationship between religion and government when he saw a group of Baptists in a local jail.

Either way a sacrifice can show someone what they truly hold dearly to themselves. Markus Zusak shows that there are many examples of characters sacrificing objects for their family in The Book Thief. A character whose sacrifices stood out to me was Hans Hubermann when he gave up his cigarettes to buy Liesel books for Christmas. Hans Hubermann makes many sacrifices for his family to provide to theme with happiness.\n\nNight Elie Wiesel Liesel Analysis\n\n466 Words | 2 Pages\n\n- Liesel, knowing the outcome of running through a stream of Jews, wanted to find Max and see him for the last time before he would disappear for years.

Hans Hubermann made a promise to Erik Vandenburg’s wife to help out in any way he could. He stuck to this promise and, consequently, agreed to house Max twenty years later. This shows how Hans kept to his promises and people could trust him. Housing a Jew in Nazi Germany could have lead to severe punishment, nevertheless, Hans decided to help Max in his time of need because he knew that he needed to stick to his commitment.\n\nFriendship In Zusak's The Book Thief\n\n712 Words | 3 Pages\n\nWhat is a friend?

True friendship often adds loyalty to ones character resulting in acts of courage.\n\nLiesel's Relationships In The Book Thief\n\n2175 Words | 9 Pages\n\nOne of the most important recurring themes throughout The Book Thief was Liesel’s relationships with all of the people in her life. She grows close with several different people, and trusts, loves, and cares for them all differently but equally. Three of those relationships will be explored more deeply; Liesel’s relationship with her foster father, Hans Hubermann, the Jewish man her family takes in, Max Vanderburg, and her best friend, Rudy Steiner. Liesel’s relationship with Hans is one of the most important, if not the most important, relationships in the novel. Hans is the first person Liesel trusts, and the person who stays with her and loves her until the end.\n\nThesis For The Book Thief Essay\n\n1144 Words | 5 Pages\n\nHans Hubermann, Liesel’s foster father, helped Jewish people in whatever way he could. When a Jewish shop named Kleinmann’s was vandalized, Hans asked the owner if he needed any help cleaning up, and promised to come back the next day and paint his door, which he did (Zusak 181-182). Hans delayed applying to the Nazi party because he didn’t agree with their beliefs, and by helping the owner he was put under more suspicion, however he felt that it was a proper action and didn’t allow danger to stop him. In addition to Hans act of kindness, the Hubermanns took a Jew named Max into their care, and allowed him to stay with them to be safe.

She has realized she officially has lost her home, that she is completely isolated from the community. “It was quite a sight seeing an eleven year old girl try not to cry on church steps, saluting fuhrer”(Zusak 115). After losing all of these emotionally wrecking things Liesel learns and understands she needs to keep going forward. She refuses to give up she although times are rough manages to think, it could be worse.\n\nIdentity In The Book Thief\n\n749 Words | 3 Pages\n\nA main reason Liesel develops into the character she is by the end of the novel is due to the individuals she meets and her relationships with them. When Hans Hubermann becomes\n\nThe Importance Of Friendship In The Book Thief\n\n1044 Words | 5 Pages\n\nHans is a warm-hearted and compassionate man who was the first that connected to Liesel. When Liesel first arrived at Himmel Street, she refused to leave the car and meet her new family. While it took them quite a bit of time to persuade her to leave, “It was the tall man who did it”(28). The first encounter between Liesel and Hans is a memorable and significant moment because it is the moment that shows how their friendship initiated. If Hans would not have sat by Liesel’s side and coaxed her to leave the car, then she would not have developed that initial trust that transpired through this."
