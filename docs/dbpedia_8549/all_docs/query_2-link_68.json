        "text": "In addition to its 36 passengers, Hindenburg carried 61 other persons on its last flight; the regular crew of 40, plus 21 additional individuals who were aboard as observers or in training for upcoming assignment to Hindenburg’s sister ship, LZ-130, which was nearing completion.\n\nCaptain Max Pruss was in command, with three other qualified captains as watch officers; Captain Albert Sammt (who would later command LZ-130 Graf Zeppelin), Captain Heinrich Bauer, and Captain Walter Ziegler. Two other airship captains were also on board as observers; Captain Ernst Lehmann, who had commanded Hindenburg on many flights and was director of the DZR, and Captain Anton Wittemann, who was the regular captain of LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin. (Wittemann would have been in command of Graf Zeppelin at the time of the Hindenburg disaster, but he had switched positions with Captain Hans von Schiller, who took Graf Zeppelin on a roundtrip to South America so he could attend a reunion in Germany.) In all, there were six qualified zeppelin captains in the control car when Hindenburg crashed at Lakehurst.\n\nThe following list of officers and crew appeared as part of the Accident Investigation report published by the the United States Department of Commerce in the Air Commerce Bulletin of August 15, 1937 (vol. 9, no. 2):\n\n* Indicates those who died as a result of the crash\n\nOFFICERS\n\nCaptain Max Pruss, Commanding\n\nCaptain Albert Sammt (watch officer)\n\nCaptain Heinrich Bauer (watch officer)\n\n[Captain] Walter Ziegler, Watch Officer\n\nCaptain Ernst Lehmann (observer)*\n\nCaptain Anton Wittemann (observer)\n\nNAVIGATORS\n\nMax Zabel, Navigator\n\nChristian Nielsen, Navigator\n\nFranz Herzog, Navigator\n\nKurt Bauer, Navigator\n\nRADIO OFFICERS\n\nWilly Speck, Chief Radio Officer*\n\nHerbert Dowe, Radio Officer\n\nFranz Eichelmann, Radio Officer*\n\nEgon Schweikart, Radio Officer\n\nENGINEERING OFFICERS\n\nRudolf Sauter, Chief Engineer\n\nEugen SchÃ¤ubel, Engineering Officer\n\nWilhelm Dimmler, Engineering Officer*\n\nELEVATORMEN\n\nLudwig Felber*\n\nErnst Huchel*\n\nEduard Boetius\n\nHELMSMEN\n\nAlfred Bernhard*\n\nHelmut Lau\n\nKurt Schönherr\n\nELECTRICIANS\n\nPhilip Lenz, Chief Electrician\n\nJoseph Leibrecht\n\nErnst Schlapp*\n\nENGINE MECHANICS\n\nWalter Bahnholzer*\n\nEugen Bentele\n\nAugust Deutschle\n\nRudy Bialas*\n\nJonny Doerflein\n\nAdolf Fischer\n\nAlbert Holderried*\n\nRichard Kollmer\n\nRobert Moser*\n\nAlois Reisacher*\n\nTheodor Ritter\n\nRaphael SchÃ¤dler\n\nWilly Scheef*\n\nJosef Schreibmuller*\n\nWilhelm Steeb\n\nAlfred Stöckle*\n\nGerman Zettel\n\nRIGGERS\n\nLudwig Knorr, Chief Rigger*\n\nHans Freund\n\nErich Spehl*\n\nSTEWARDS\n\nHeinrich Kubis, Chief Steward\n\nWilhelm Balla\n\nFritz Deeg\n\nMax Henneberg\n\nSeverin Klein\n\nEugen Nunnenmacher\n\nMax Schulze*\n\nEmilie Imhoff (Stewardess)*\n\nSHIP’S DOCTOR\n\nDr. Kurt Rudiger"
