        "text": "The theatrical producer and director August Everding, who has died aged 70, was at the heart of cultural life in Munich, and in Germany. With his characteristic mixture of exuberance, intellectualism and naivete, he became the embodiment of theatre in his chosen city.\n\nEverding actually discovered musical theatre relatively late in his working life, an experience which led him from Hochhut and Brecht to Wagner and Mozart. The middle period of his career was dominated by his love for opera, with productions in Beirut and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He also took the directorship of the Hamburg Staatsoper in 1973, a post which he left in 1977 to return to Munich.\n\nHis term at the helm of the Munich Opera House was overshadowed by a running feud with the musical director of the house, Wolfgang Sawallisch, who, Everding felt, had rather less respect for singers and directors than he did himself.\n\nIn 1980, Everding became Generalintendant of Munich, a post which was invented for him, in recognition of his outstanding ability.This promotion gave him sway over all of Munich's theatres.\n\nDespite the considerable demands of this position, Everding still found time for an endless list of other local projects, including membership of innumerable committees, funding, restoring and reopening the Munich Prinzregententheater, founding a theatre academy and a museum of theatre. He produced plays and opera all over the world, including Verdi's I Due Foscari in Covent Garden in 1995. While his critics tended to see him as the archetypal Figaro in Rossini's opera Barber of Seville, a Jack-of-all-trades seemingly everywhere at the same time, nobody could deny his immense energy and his effectiveness.\n\nA Westphalian by birth and educated at the universities of Bonn and Munich, he read philosophy, theology, German literature and theatre studies before becoming an assistant to Fritz Kortner and Hans Schweikart in Munich. That was the beginning of his own rapid rise, through the ranks of the Munich Kammerspiele, of which he became Intendant (general director) at 34.\n\nA typical day in the life of this untiring creature and creator could include a broadcast discussion, rehearsal, student party, session at the theatre academy, and attending an evening performance while dictating letters and giving interviews.\n\nHe drew much of his phenomenal energy from his devout Catholic faith, which he never chose to publicise, but which also helped him feel at home in Catholic Bavaria; this southern German state was an ideal environment for his baroque personality, which combined his passion for theatre with a good deal of vanity and shrewdness.\n\nAs a director, Everding always felt underestimated and unkindly dealt with by reviewers. His unique strength was, in fact, less in directing than in lending his electrifying personality to the theatre. As such, he proved a catalyst of numerous projects which would have been impossible without him.\n\nHe leaves a wife, Gustava, and four sons."
