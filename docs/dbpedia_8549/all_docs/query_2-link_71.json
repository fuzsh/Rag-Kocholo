        "text": "Iran Theater-Shiva Ebrahimi,Iranian well-known Actress is born in 1977. She has played in a variety of shows in recent years.\n\nWhen she was student in the university, She started acting .Her first professional role was in a T.V series called “Kohneh Savar” by Akbar Khajooi.\n\nIn an interview with Iran Theater on her new acting activities, Shiva Ebrahimi said: \"I'm going to play in The Marriage of Mr. Mississippi, directed by Ehsan Falahat pisheh, I will act as Anastasia. Rehearsals started from November 5, and the show is scheduled to take place on January in the main hall of the city Theater Complex. In this show, Mohammad Sadegh Malek, Mohammad Reza Maleki, Mehdi Nosrati and Arash Falahat Pisheh will act the main roles.”\n\nThe Marriage of Mr. Mississippi (German: Die Ehe des Herrn Mississippi) is a play by the Swiss writer Friedrich Dürrenmatt. The play was written in 1950, but Dürrenmatt continued to revise it until 1980. It premiered on 26 March 1952 at the Munich Kammerspiele, directed by Hans Schweikart.The play was adapted into a 1961 film with the same title.\n\nShiva Ebrahimi added:” Ehsan Falahat Pesheh has made a loyal adaptation. We are currently engaged in rehearsals to find the form .The play, one of the outstanding works of Durrenmatt, has four main characters. One of them believes in the capitalist system and thinks that human welfare is in follwoing this system. St. Claude thinks only the victory of the Communist Party brings real justice and he supports it. The third character is a sacrifice doctor who donates all his money to the poor and loves humanity with all his heart. Anastasia, the only woman of the play, is a person who does not believe in any principle. She has no morality, she constantly lied. The playwright indicates that none of the male characters succeed in their idealist path, but that the world is only for those who, like Anastasia, have no morality.”"
