        "text": "Romanian postcard by Casa Filmului Acin.\n\nWith his sleepy eyes, distinctive eyebrows and deep, gravelly voice, English actor David Hemmings (1941 – 2003) was one of the princes of the ‘swinging London’ of the 1960’s. His role as the fashion photographer in Michelangelo Antonioni’s classic thriller Blow Up (1966) made him an international cinema icon.\n\nDavid Edward Leslie Hemmings was born in Guildford, Great Britain in 1941 to a cookie merchant and his wife. He was educated at Alleyn’s School and the Glyn Grammar School (now the Glyn Technology School). This led the 9-year old to start a professional career performing as a boy soprano in several operatic works by the composer Benjamin Britten. Hemmings played the title role in Britten’s The Little Sweep (1952), which was part of Britten’s Let’s Make An Opera! children’s production. Most notably, Hemmings created the role of Miles in Britten’s chamber opera Turn of the Screw (1954) with the English Opera Group. He was renowned for his mature and intelligent vocal interpretations of these parts. His close friendship with Britten is described in John Bridcut’s book Britten’s Children (2006). Although many commentators identified Britten’s relationship with Hemmings as based on an infatuation, throughout his life the actor maintained categorically that Britten’s conduct with him was beyond reproach at all times. He briefly left the musical world when his voice changed. He studied painting at the Epsom School of Art and staged his first exhibition at 15. He returned to singing in his early 20’s, first in nightclubs, then on the musical stage. As a child actor he had made his film debut in the drama The Rainbow Jacket (1954, Basil Dearden) for Ealing Studios. He also had bit part in Saint Joan (1957, Otto Preminger) featuring Jean Seberg. When the youth culture hit Britain in the late 1950’s, Jon C Hopwood writes at IMDb: “Hemmings was in the right place at the right time to capitalize on his skills and looks. Boyish-looking, with large, protuberant blue eyes covered with heavy lids, his face was at once startling and decadent while simultaneously conveying an air of fragility”. He appeared as misunderstood youths and belligerent ‘Teddy Boys’, such as in the teen musicals Some People (1962, Clive Donner), Live It Up! (1964, Lance Comfort), and Be My Guest (1965, Lance Comfort). He also played opposite Oliver Reed in the drama The System/The Girl-Getters (1964, Michael Winner).\n\nThen, the 24 year old David Hemmings landed his career defining role. Italian film director Michelangelo Antonioni sought to find a fresh young face for the lead in his existential thriller Blow Up/Blowup (1966) co-starring Vanessa Redgrave, Sarah Miles, Jane Birkin and Veruschka. He found Hemmings acting in a small stage theatre in London. Hemmings character was a fashionable photographer reportedly based on David Bailey. In his obituary of Hemmings in The Guardian, Tim Pulleine describes how the character “is eventually brought face to face with the illusoriness not only of success but of reality itself. The film’s conclusion, in which the photographer is gradually torn into participation in an imaginary game of tennis, must surely rank as one of the most mesmerising in all cinema. Hemmings’s physical demeanour, combining down-to-earth chippiness with an almost ethereal air of fragility, admirably embodied the themes of a groundbreaking movie, which dissolved the barriers between art and popular cinema.” Blowup made Hemmings an international star and pin-up for a while, a darling of the pop culture filmmaking that was expected to revolutionize the English-speaking cinema in the 1960’s. Following Blow Up, Hemmings appeared in a string of major British films, including the musical Camelot (1967, Joshua Logan), the war film The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968, Tony Richardson) and in the title role in the epic film Alfred the Great (1969, Clive Donner) with Michael York. His short stature, sleepy eyes and undershot jaw made him an unconventional leading man, but unconventional was right for the times, and he became one of the icons of the ‘swinging London’ scene. In 1967, Hemmings recorded a pop single, Back Street Mirror and a studio album, David Hemmings Happens, in Los Angeles, California. The album featured instrumental backing by several members of The Byrds. Later, Hemmings provided the narration for Rick Wakeman’s progressive-rock album Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1974) – an adaptation of Jules Verne’s science-fiction novel A Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864). He also appeared as Dildano in the pop art fantasy Barbarella (1968, Roger Vadim) featuring Jane Fonda, convincingly portrayed a troubled schoolmaster in Unman, Wittering and Zigo, (1971, John MacKenzie) and appeared in the dud The Love Machine (1971, Jack Haley Jr.), starring John Phillip Law and based on Jacqueline Susann’s bestseller.\n\nDavid Hemmings’ career took a new turn when he founded t\n\nDutch postcard by M.

Still from Acht Madels im Boot/Eight Girls in a Boat (1932, Erich Waschneck).\n\nGerman actress Karin Hardt (1910-1992) made her cinema debut as a pure and disarmingly natural backfisch, looking for happiness. Her impressive career with many film, theatre and television appearances lasted for six decades.\n\nKarin Therese Meta Hardt was born in 1910 in Altona (now Hamburg), Germany. She was a daughter of a merchant. She had private acting lessons with Alex Otto and soon became theatre engagements in Monchengladbach, Rheydt and Altenburg. In 1931 she made her film debut in Vater geht auf Reisen/father Goes To Travel (1931, Carl Boese) with Lissy Arna.. She was then discovered by director Erich Waschneck, who cast her in Acht Madels im Boot/ Eight Girls in a Boat (1932, Erich Waschneck), which became her breakthrough. In the following years she became a beloved star. Karin Hardt and Erich Waschneck married in 1933, and he would go on to direct her in some of their best films, including An heiligen Wassern/Sacred Waters (1932) and Abel mit der Mundharmonika/Abel with the Mouth Organ (1933). She was the pure and disarmingly natural backfisch, who in a girly way angled for happiness. Among her best known films of the 1930’s belong Ein gewisser Herr Gran/A Certain Mr. Gran (1933, Gerhard Lamprecht) next to Hans Albers, Die blonde Christel/Blonde Christel (1933, Frans Seitz), Barcarole (1935, Gerhard Lamprecht), Die Umwege des schonen Karl/The Diversions of Handsome Karl (1938, Carl Froelich) with Heinz Ruhmann, and Menschen vom Variete/Vaudeville People (1939, Josef von Baky) as the naive, blonde competitor of La Jana. During the war years her engagements became less, but she appeared for example in Kameraden/Comrades (1941, Hans Schweikart) with Willy Birgel, Das Hochzeitshotel/The Marriage Hotel (1944, Carl Boese), and Via Mala (1944-1948, Josef von Baky) as the daughter of Carl Wery.\n\nAfter the war Karin Hardt was regularly seen in the cinema. Erich Waschneck directed her in the comedy Danke es geht mir gut/Thanks, I’m alright (1948). She appeared as the the queen in the fairytale film Dornroschen/Sleeping Beauty (1955, Fritz Genschow), next to Horst Buchholz in Endstation Liebe/Last Stop Love (1957, Georg Tressler), and with Kirk Douglas in Town Without Pity (1961, Gottfried Reinhardt). She mainly appeared in the theatre, in Berlin, Hamburg, Aachen and in Koln (Cologne). From the 1960’s on she was also often seen on television, in tv-series like Bei uns zu Haus/At Our Home (1963, ), Der Forellenhof (1965) and Die Unternehmungen des Herrn Hans/The Enterprises of Mr. Hans (1976, Charles Kerremans). She also appeared in the film Schoner Gigolo, armer Gigolo/Just a Gigolo (1979; David Hemmings) with David Bowie. In 1983 she was awarded with the Filmband in Gold for her continuing attributions to the German cinema. Then she had a great comeback in the popular serial Die Schwarzwaldklinik/The Black Forest Clinic (1985-1986). Karin Hardt died of cerebral hemorrhage in 1992 in Berlin. She was married twice. First to Erich Waschneck from 1933 till his death in 1970, and then to Rolf von Goth.\n\nSources: Wikipedia, Schwarzwald-TV-Klinik, Thomas Staedeli (Cyranos), and IMDb."
