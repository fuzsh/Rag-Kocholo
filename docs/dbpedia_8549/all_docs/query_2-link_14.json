        "text": "Bernard Minetti saw Hermine Körner and the productions of Hans Schweikart in Munich and decided he wanted to be an actor. He debuted in Gera in 1927 and until 1930 he was engaged at the theatres in Gera and Darmstadt. In 1931 he made his first movie, \"Der Mörder Dimitri Karamasoff\", soon followed by \"Berlin - Alexanderplatz\" (1931). From 1930 until the end of the war he was engaged at the Staatstheater in Berlin and in 1938 Goebbels made him Actor of State. During this period he was hardly interested in movies, but he was in Leni Riefenstahl's \"Tiefland\" and in the propaganda movie \"Die Rothschilds - Unglaublichkeiten\".\n\nAlthough he had collaborated with the nazis he was soon back on the stage after the war. After engagements in Kiel, Hamburg and Frankfurt am Main he returned to Berlin where he worked at the Schillertheater. The last part of his career he spent with the Berliner Ensemble. His children Hans-Peter (1926) and Jennifer (1940) also became actors.\n\nEvents"
