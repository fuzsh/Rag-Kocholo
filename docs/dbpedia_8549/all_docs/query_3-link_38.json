His daughter said. “He had been ill for some time\".\n\nFriedrich Alexander Kerst was born on 2/23/1924 in Kralupy u Chomutova, Czechoslovakia. The Bohemian actor as a TVPioneer: Since the 1950s, he appeared in numerous television productions. In 2005 he played in the ZDFMiniseries \"Die Patirarchin\" and a year later he was in the critically acclaimed for his appearance on ARDTV movie \"Silberhochzeit\".\n\nKerst’s film appearances include Alfred Weidemann's \"Stern von Afrika,\" Frank Wisbar Stalingrad-Film \"Hunde, wollte ihr ewig leben\" and \"Mein Schulfreund\" with Heinz Ruehmann. He appeared in numerous television thrillers such as \"Tatort\", \"Derrick\" and \"Der Alte\".
