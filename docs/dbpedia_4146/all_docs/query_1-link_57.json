Having been born 25 January of 1945, he was 76. Several days before he died, he was running errands and sensed that he was having a heart attack, so he drove himself to the Emergency Room. Once stabilized there, he was taken to the Intensive Care Unit because, with the crowded conditions, there were no beds available where he could receive the level of care he needed. By the time he could be accommodated, his condition had worsened and successful treatment was no longer possible. As a last resort, he was moved to hospice care for a very short time.\n\nPaul was trained as an Army Helicopter Pilot at the height of the Vietnam Conflict, with his assignments to Warrant Officer Flight Training Classes 68-27 at Ft Wolters, TX, and 68-515 at Hunter Army Airfield, in Savannah, GA. Upon graduation, he was immediately sent to the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) with many of his classmates. Initially, Paul was assigned to the 335th Assault Helicopter Company (AHC) at a crude tent camp near Phu Hiep, a small village adjacent to Tuy Hoa Air Base (II Corps). The 335th AHC soon moved to improved facilities at Bearcat, beside a small Air Force compound at Long Thanh North (III Corps). In early January of 1969, Paul was transferred, with several of his other unit members, to the 191st AHC at Dong Tam, adjacent to My Tho on the Mekong River (IV Corps). There, he served as a slick pilot with the 2nd Platoon (White Flight). He flew almost daily combat assaults, in support of the 9th Infantry Division for the remainder of his tour. Following a unit move to Can Tho he continued to fly combat assaults and he even flew some Nighthawk missions toward the end of his tour. He was an excellent pilot and an extraordinary person -- a favorite of all who knew him.\n\nOn 6 September 1969, Paul was the fourth ship on a combat assault near Vi Thanh, southwest of Can Tho, where his flight received unusually intense and sustained enemy fire upon landing with troops. His Gunner returned withering defensive fire allowing the troops to disembark. Not only did he force himself to remain cool while waiting on the ground with incoming rounds pouring into his helicopter, the tactical situation required multiple identical exposures, to bring reinforcing troops to the fight. For his conspicuous gallantry in action, Paul received a well-deserved Distinguished Flying Cross among his other awards. He returned from his RVN tour in late October of 1969.\n\nAfter he left active duty, Paul made his mark in multiple roles: He continued his flying with the Army Reserve. He also became an Army Tugboat Captain, a Registered Nurse, and a Deacon in his church. Among other positions, he was a Department of Defense employee at Aberdeen Proving Ground. He worked for the Veteran's Administration for several years, and served a stint at the U.S. Naval Academy. In his off-time, Paul was an avid sailor and for several years was a member of the Downtown Sailing Center on Baltimore's Inner Harbor.\n\nMembers of the 191st AHC Assn who attended the 2002 Reunion will remember Paul as the guy who nearly single-handedly organized the whole thing in record time, the instant he was given the green light by the 191st AHC Association Board of Directors. His amazing flair for organization quickly became apparent when months later he hosted that reunion with a dedicated crew of family and loyal supporters -- a major success.\n\nPaul leaves his wife, Connie of 51 years and his son Paul III. He will be sorely missed.\n\nPaul Arthur Bernier, 73, of Washburn, WI passed away at home on January 27, 2022. He was born on January 15, 1949, in Mendota, MN, the son of Thomas R. and Pearl (Shelton) Bernier. He attended Pilot Knob and St. PeterÂ’s grade schools, Sibley High School, and Normandale Junior college. He served 3 years in the Army, including in Viet Nam from 1968-1969 as part of the 191st Assault Helicopter Company in the Mekong Delta. He worked in the music industry until 1980 when he began working in Financial Industries, owning his own business, Bernier & Associates, and later Senior Financial Advisors until retiring in 2012.\n\nBruce Charles Bridge USA CW4 Retired; Flight Classes: 69-37/69- 35; RVN: 69-70 191 AHC; Callsign BountyHunter 48.

Falcon, on April 3, 2022. He was 78. Among the highlights of his distinguished Military career, John served as the Executive Officer of the 191st Assault Helicopter Company (191st AHC) from late 1968 until he left Vietnam at the end of his tour.\n\nJohn and his high school sweetheart, Irma Falcon, raised a son, Chris Falcon, and a daughter, Monica Bubb. He also ran a very successful insurance business for many years. Another of this huge life commitments was the writing of a book (The Freedom Shield -- When We Were Young, We Were There) detailing the activities of the 191st AHC in Vietnam, from initial arrival in-Country, until the unit stood down and returned home. John did his best to give appropriate credit, where due, to all who would share the stories of their experiences with the unit. And he diligently recognized the ultimate sacrifices of the forty-four unfortunate 191st AHC members who didn't make it home. The amount of his spare time that he devoted to this project was staggering and he deserves a mountain of credit for completing this humongous task as promised.\n\nA more complete obituary can be found at the web site of Baldwin Funeral Home Inc - Richland, GA ( Click Here )\n\nBill Dean passed away on March 17th, 2022 .
