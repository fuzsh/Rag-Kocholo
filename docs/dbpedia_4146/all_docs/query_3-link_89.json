        "text": "ST. JOSEPH, Mo. — The pads have been on for four training camp practices, and while there are still 10 workouts to go on the campus of Missouri Western State University, it’s an ideal time to a big-picture look at projecting the Chiefs’ 53-player roster.\n\nHeading into camp the biggest questions focused on the battle for the starting left tackle position, the starting cornerback position vacated by L’Jarius Sneed and the depth chart at wide receiver behind Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy.\n\nIt’s hard to argue that any of those questions have been answered definitively. Kingsley Suamataia and Wanya Morris remain in a pitched battle at left tackle, three different cornerbacks have lined up oppositive Trent McDuffie, and as many as 11 different receivers are getting reps with the first-team offense on a given day.\n\nThere’s the usual caveat that there’s 10 more workouts left in camp, three preseason games and another week of practice in Kansas City before general manager Brett Veach must make his final cuts on Aug. 27. Much can happen between now and then.\n\nQuarterback (2)\n\nStarter: Patrick Mahomes\n\nBackup: Carson Wentz\n\nPlayer to watch: Chris Oladokun\n\nIn the mix: Ian Book\n\nThere’s very little suspense in the quarterback room other than whether the Chiefs feel the need to keep a third quarterback on the roster. Oladokun remains a handy resource as a scout team quarterback and his improvement each season makes him a worthwhile development project. Book has shown greater comfort in the offense over the course of the last week and certainly has earned practice squad consideration. Barring injury, however, it’s Mahomes and the understudy Wentz.\n\nRunning back (3)\n\nStarters: Isiah Pacheco\n\nBackups: Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Deneric Prince\n\nPlayer to watch: Louis Rees-Zammit and Keontay Ingram\n\nIn the mix: Carson Steele and Emani Bailey\n\nWith the Chiefs managing the workload of both Pacheco and Edwards-Helaire, Prince has received more opportunities and taken advantage of them. A strong preseason performance from him should solidify his position on the roster. Ingram has also looked strong, especially as a potential third-down back who can catch the football and pass protect. Rees-Zammit is an absolutely tantalizing talent. He’s capable as a return specialist, particularly on kick returns, and could serve as a chess piece on offense in a limited, specific role. But making the leap from rugby to football will take time, especially picking up the finer points of setting up blocks, understanding zone blocking, and picking up the entire playbook. Don’t bet against him picking up these details sooner than later. But is he ready for the 53-player roster after four padded practices? Not yet.\n\nWide Receiver (7)\n\nStarters: Hollywood Brown, Rashee Rice and Justin Watson\n\nBackups: Xavier Worthy, Mecole Hardman, Skyy Moore and Nikko Remigio\n\nPlayers to watch: Kadarius Toney, Justyn Ross and Montrell Washington\n\nIn the mix: Cornell Powell, Phillip Brooks, Jaaron Hayek and Kyle Sheets\n\nAfter the top four receivers, not even Nostradamus could sort out how many receivers the Chiefs should keep during the cutdown to 53 players nor who would be the final receivers standing. Hardman seems a safe bet as the most well-suited to provide insurance behind the rookie Worthy. Based on snaps, Moore remains a favorite of the Chiefs’ coaching staff and appears on the right side of the cutline for now. Remigio looks to be the team’s best bet as a return specialist, and he could cement that role with a solid preseason. Toney’s role has become more clouded during camp as his reps with the first team and his play remain inconsistent. Ross continues making highlight-reel plays but sometimes struggles with easier catches. Washington is a special teams ace as well and has developed a strong chemistry with Wentz — as one of the team’s best deep-ball trackers along with Worthy and Brown, Washington deserves consideration.\n\nTight End (4)\n\nStarter: Travis Kelce\n\nBackups: Noah Gray, Jared Wiley and Irv Smith Jr.\n\nPlayers to watch: Baylor Cupp\n\nIn the mix: Izaiah Gathings\n\nThe Chiefs will certainly keep three tight ends, and barring injury that will be Kelce, Gray and Wiley. But no one on the roster is having a better camp than Smith, who has demonstrated great hands and appears very comfortable in the offense. He’s a capable backup behind Gray, just as Wiley is for Kelce, and his addition to the roster would give the Chiefs a reliable ability to play with multiple tight ends even in the event of an injury.\n\nOffensive Line (9)\n\nStarters: LT Kingsley Suamataia, LG Joe Thuney, C Creed Humphrey, RG Trey Smith and RT Juwaan Taylor\n\nBackups: Wanya Morris, Lucas Niang, Mike Caliendo and Hunter Nourzad\n\nPlayers to watch: C.J. Hanson and Chukwuebuka Godrick\n\nIn the mix: Ethan Driskell, Nick Torres, Griffin McDowell and McKade Mettauer\n\nThe camp battle between Suamataia and Morris still ranges but the Chiefs hope their second-round pick will win the starting battle and allow Morris to serve as a swing tackle — and perhaps as a replacement for Taylor on the right side down the road. Niang, Caliendo and Nourzad seem solid locks barring injury, but the tough decision will be whether to keep a 10th offensive lineman starting the season. If they do, seventh-round pick Hanson is the likely choice but don’t sleep on Godrick. The International Player Pathway Program alum from Nigeria has shown strong development since last season and has put himself amidst the competition for a roster spot.\n\nDefensive Line (10)\n\nStarters: DE George Karlaftis, DT Chris Jones, DT Tershawn Wharton and DE Mike Danna\n\nBackups: DE Felix Anudike-Uzomah, DT Mike Pennel, DT Neil Farrell, DE Malik Herring, DT Matt Dickerson and DE Truman Jones\n\nPlayers to watch: DT Fabien Lovett\n\nIn the mix: DT Alex Gubner and DE Owen Carney\n\nPhysically Unable to Perform List: DE Charles Omenihu and DT Derrick Nnadi\n\nNon-football Injury List: DE BJ Thompson\n\nWhen Nnadi will return to action remains an outstanding question, and it’s one of many about the team’s defensive line depth. Pennel’s return this offseason at first appeared targeted toward allowing the 33-year-old, 10-year veteran the prerogative of coming in midseason and providing depth for a postseason run but the club has managed Pennel’s workload during camp as a core contributor. Anudike-Uzoman looks much improved from a year ago but the depth on the edge suffers without Omenihu, whom the club targets for an October or November return from a torn ACL. Don’t rule out Lovett cracking the roster ahead of Dickerson or Jones, and don’t be surprised if KC brings in affordable, veteran depth at pass rusher.\n\nLinebacker (5)\n\nStarters: SLB Leo Chenal, MLB Nick Bolton and WLB Drue Tranquill\n\nBackups: OLB/MLB Cam Jones and MLB/OLB Jack Cochrane\n\nPlayers to watch: OLB Curtis Jacobs and OLB Cole Christiansen\n\nIn the mix: OLB Swayze Bozeman\n\nHow deep is the Kansas City linebacker group? All eight members could easily compete for a job on most NFL teams, even undrafted rookie free agents Jacobs and Bozeman. While the Chiefs prefer to carry 10 defensive linemen, circumstances could prompt them to keep six linebackers. Jones and Cochrane get the edge here with both offering high flexibility, Jones as an athletic playmaker and Cochrane as a physical inside player. Cochrane is a special-teams ace and the No. 3 Mike linebacker behind Bolton and Tranquill.\n\nCornerback (6)\n\nStarters: Trent McDuffie and Nazeeh Johnson\n\nBackups: Joshua Williams, Nic Jones, Jaylen Watson and Kelvin Joseph\n\nPlayers to watch: Kamal Hadden, Keith Taylor, Miles Battle and Ekow Boye-Doe\n\nWho will be the starter opposite Trent McDuffie in Week 1? Take a guess. Joseph is the latest to take a shot at the right cornerback role behind Johnson and Williams, and Watson only returned from the PUP list Wednesday. Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo is challenging this group to step up and earn the No. 2 spot opposite McDuffie but so far no one has separated themselves. The competition remains wide open. The sixth-round pick Hadden appears on the outside looking in for now but it’s still early in camp.\n\nSafety (4)\n\nStarters: Justin Reid and Bryan Cook\n\nBackups: Chamarri Conner and Jaden Hicks\n\nPlayers to watch: Deon Bush\n\nIn the mix: Tyree Gillespie, Chris Rolland-Wallace and D.J. Miller\n\nEven with Reid out due to a quad injury this looks like one of the club’s strongest position groups. Cook appears fully recovered from the ankle injury that ended his 2023 campaign early, and Conner thrives in not only the slot corner position but any role in which he’s plugged. Hicks hasn’t shown any rookie weaknesses thus far despite the challenge of filling in for Reid in nickel packages. Bush is a savvy veteran special teams player. Rolland-Wallace and Miller are making the transition from corner to safety and could find their way to the practice squad.\n\nSpecialist (3)\n\nStarters: K Harrison Butker, P Matt Araiza and LS James Winchester\n\nNo competition here, and the only question is how prepared is Araia to handle kick-holding duties for the fastidious Butker. So far, so good, although there have been a couple of shaky holds thus far in camp."
