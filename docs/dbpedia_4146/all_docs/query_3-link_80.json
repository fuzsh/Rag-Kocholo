        "text": "VMO's?\n\nPaul,\n\nI think they became HMA's and HML/A's.....\n\nCouldn't imagine I would recall such a number of these C.O.'s from personal experience. Some I served under while they were in Command, as we all did, but many were Lts and Capts in the early part of their journey to a command post. I see the pilot that was the first to let me \"drive\" a CH-46 and the one that signed my DD214 upon my RAD in addition to many really fine officers and pilots. Leaders of the best! WOW!\n\nGood info!:D\n\nVMO Skippers...\n\nLarry said:\n\nCould it be\n\nthat when they got transferred with the OV-10's they got taken out of helicopters and put in fixed wing????\n\nPaul makes a great point here...the Skippers should have been listed for those years....I didn't check the dates, and since Paul was there, it was obvious to him....\n\nWally, can you check on the VMO C.O.'s???\n\nI would imagine you would have to contact the admin for that site and ask them since it is not part of popasmoke. It would be nice to take their C.O. list and maintain it on our site. Wonder if they would be willing to let us have a copy of it...\n\nHelicopter CO's\n\nMissing HMR 161 CO's .I hope I didn't over look it. I can't remember them all but Lt Col R.R. Ayres signed my Cpl warrant in early 1954. I was in the squadron 53-55. Also missing was one of the best CO's I ever had Col R. Leu HMR 162 1962-63. I'm sure there are others.\n\nCO's VMO Squadrons\n\nWhen I returned from Vietnam in 1969, I was the ALO with 2nd Field Arty Group, ForTrps and flew with VMO at New River. The CO was LtCol \"Tank\" Meyers and Maj Brown was the XO. We had OV-10's and Hueys and as I was leaving in May 1971 we were obtaining the \"N\" model Huey and Cobras. I did not see LtCol Meyers name anywhere on that list either!\n\nSemper Fi - Duke Dearing\n\n\"Lead, Follow, or Get Out Of The Way\" - Semper Fi - Duke\n\nVMO Cos\n\nWeb page with VMO-2 CO List\n\n___________________________________\n\nVMO-6 CO List (since WW2)\n\n1st Lt Thomas G ALDERSON 20 Nov 1944 - 22 Nov 44\n\nCapt Donald R GARRETT 23 Nov 44 - 16 Sept 45\n\nCapt Joe W FITTS, Jr 17 Sept 45 - 14 Dec 45\n\n1st Lt Edward S JOHN 15 Dec 45 - 25 May 46\n\nCapt Richard B CROPLEY 26 May 46 - 21 Aug 46\n\nCapt James N CUPP 22 Aug 46 - 23 Oct 36\n\nCapt Richard B CROPLEY 24 Oct 46 - 12 Dec 46\n\nCapt Harold F BROWN 13 Dec 46 - 19 Apr 48\n\nCapt Richard B CROPLEY 20 Apr 48 - 20 Oct 48\n\nMaj Robert G HOWIE 21 Oct 48 - 1 Jul 50\n\nCapt William C PARKER, Jr 2 Jul 50 - 2 Jul 50\n\nMaj Vincent J GOTTSCHALK 3 Jul 50 - 31 Mar 51\n\nCapt Clarence W PARKINS 1 Apr 51 - 4 Apr 51\n\nMaj David W MCFARLAND 5 Apr 51 - 5 Oct 51\n\nMaj Allen H RINGBLOM 6 Oct 51 - 31 Oct 51\n\nMaj Kenneth C SMEDLEY 1 Nov 51 - 25 Nov 51\n\nMal Edward R POLGREAN 26 Nov 51 - 30 Jan 52\n\nMaj Kenneth C SMEDLEY 31 Jan 52 - 10 Feb 52\n\nMaj William C MCLEAN, Jr 11 Feb 52 - 26 Feb 52\n\nLtCol William T HERRING 27 Feb 52 - 9 May 52\n\nMaj Wallace J SLAPPEY, Jr 10 May 52 - 10 Sept 52\n\nLtCol Elkin S DEW 11 Sept 52 - 2 Feb 53\n\nLtCol William A CLOMAN, Jr 3 Feb 53 - 30 Jun 53\n\nLtCol Earl E ANDERSON 1 Jul 53 - 7 Dec 53\n\nLtCol John H KING, Jr 8 Dec 53 - 31 May 54\n\nLtCol Matt S OBER, Jr 1 Jun 54 - 20 Sept 54\n\nMaj Robert L RATHBUN 21 Sept 54 - 7 Dec 54\n\nMaj Leonard A MILLER 8 Dec 54 - 19 May 55\n\nMaj Mont L BEAMON 20 May 55 - 6 Oct 56\n\nMal Clifford W BUCKINGHAM 7 Oct 56 - 17 Sept 57\n\nLtCol Harold F BROWN 18 Sept 57 - 20 Sept 59\n\nLtCol Clyde S STEWART 21 Sept 59 - 1 Mar 61\n\nMaj Arnold W BARDEN 2 Mar 61 - 22 Jul 61\n\nLtCol Henry K BRUCE 23 Jul 61 - 23 Feb 63\n\nLtCol Joseph L FREITAS, Jr 24 Feb 63 - 23 Feb 64\n\nLtCol George F BAUMAN 24 Feb 64 - 21 Feb 65\n\nLtCol Robert J ZITNIK 22 Feb 65 - 22 Mar 66\n\nMaj Robert E PRESSON 23 Mar 66 - 10 Jun 66\n\nMaj William J GOODSELL 11 Jun 66 - 16 Jun 66\n\nMaj Rawley M GREGORY 17 Jun 66 - 22 Jul 66\n\nMaj William R MALONEY 23 Jul 66 - 26 Mar 67\n\nLtCol Joseph A NELSON 27 Mar 67 - 16 Sept 67\n\nLtCol William J WHITE 17 Sept 67 - 24 Mar 68\n\nMal Bertram A MAAS 25 Mar 68 - 20 Sept 68\n\nMaj Hans A ZANDER 21 Sept 68 - 1 Apr 69\n\nLtCol Billy D BOULDIN 2 Apr 69 - 17 Jun 69\n\nMaj Albert K CHARLTON 18 Jun 69 - 30 Nov 69\n\nMaj Jack A BRANDON 1 Dec 69 - 5 May 70\n\nLtCol Albert J KOHANOWICH 6 May 70 - 13 Jan 71\n\nLtCol Allan H BLOOM 14 Jan 71 - 14 May 71\n\nLtCol Jerome L NORTON 15 May 71 - 14 Mar 72\n\nMaj Garry HARLAN 15 Mar 72 - 29 Mar 72\n\nLtCol Donald E DILLEY 30 Mar 72 - 16 Mar 73\n\nMaj Jesse N KEATHLEY 17 Mar 73 - 12 Oct 73\n\nLtCol Robert C FINN 13 Oct 73 - 21 Jun 74\n\nMaj Jack R ZELLICH 22 Jun 74 - 9 Jul 74\n\nLtCol Barry F SKINNER 10 Jul 74 - 17 Jul 75\n\nMaj Robert G WHALEY 18 Jul 75 - 2 Aug 75\n\nLtCol Leland O WAYMIRE 3 Aug 75 - 12 Jul 76\n\nLtCol Larry E BYERS 13 Jul 76 - 31 Dec 76\n\n- deactivated"
