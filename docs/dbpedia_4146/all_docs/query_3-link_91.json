        "text": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WVIR) - Monday night, August 8, Charlottesville City Council had a packed agenda.\n\nIn what has been a whirlwind process for all groups involved, all five Councilors agreed on getting involved in the frantic effort to preserve the Carlton Mobile Home Park.\n\nThe Mobile Home Park is being sold, meaning around 200 people could be displaced.\n\n“It’s a fundamental human rights issue for the people in that neighborhood,” Councilor Brian Pinkston said.\n\nCouncil voted to put some money into the pot to save it, along with the Piedmont Housing Alliance and Habitat for Humanity.\n\nPHA and Habitat are offering a combined $7.25 million to redevelop the property. The city has agreed to pay the annual debt service.\n\nThe agreement states that current residents can stay where they are for three years.\n\n“It will become more housing for more people, which is obviously what we need,” Councilor Natalie Oschrin said.\n\nThe lingering question is if they will be given the property.\n\n“It’s in the hands of the current owners,” Councilor Michael Payne said.\n\nAnother piece of property considered at Monday night’s meeting was the Water Street Parking Garage.\n\nIn 1990, Charlottesville entered a 99-year deal to lease the land under the garage, a deal that many Councilors feel now is coming back to bite them.\n\n“67 years left. We’re talking hundreds of millions of dollars, couple 100 million dollars,” City Manager Sam Sanders said.\n\nWith rent on that land skyrocketing, Council voted to enter a new, 20-year deal with what feels like a somewhat better price tag.\n\n“I wanted to make sure that we look for a better ‘out’ opportunity,” City Manager Sam Sanders said.\n\nThe agreement allows Council to get out of the lease or buy the land in 2044.\n\nBefore the night was over, Council discussed giving a pay raise to anyone sitting where they are in two years from now.\n\n“We’re not voting necessarily on our own salaries. We’re voting on the salaries of the next incoming counselors,” Oschrin said.\n\nNot all were convinced these elected officials need such a higher salary.\n\n“Not just any pay raise, a pay raise of up to 89%,” Don Gathers, a resident of Charlottesville, said.\n\nCouncilors argued the $18,000 they receive now is a major deterrent of the job.\n\n“I have talked to people who thought about running for office and one of the factors was I’d have to cut back on my hours,” Councilor Michael Payne said.\n\nThe proposed raise would pay councilors up to $34,000.\n\nCouncil will vote on increasing salaries at the next meeting, scheduled for August 19.\n\nDo you have a story idea?
