        "text": "Before I continue with the advance of the Stalag Luft IV POWs marching on their path through Germany in early March 1945, I wanted to review what the families at home would have believed in regard to their loved ones held in Stalag Luft IV. The families’ main sources of news were (1) correspondence via postcards and letters between them and their POW family member, and (2) a Prisoners of War Bulletin published monthly and mailed to them by the Red Cross.\n\nFamily Correspondence\n\nIn my father’s, George Edwin Farrar’s, case, he had very little correspondence with family while interned first in the hospital, and later at the Stalag Luft IV prison camp from the time of his capture on 28 September 1944 up until he was marched from the camp on 6 February 1945.\n\nOn 5 October 1944, George Farrar’s eighth day of captivity, he was allowed to send a Kriegsgefangenenpost postcard notifying his family that he was a prisoner of war and in good health (although he was far from in good health). His family did not receive this card until sometime in January 1945.\n\nOn 24 October 1944, George wrote his first letter home as a POW. He was still hospitalized as of the date of the letter. The letter held a 15 December 1944 postmark stamp, but the location of the mark is illegible. The Farrar family apparently did not receive the letter until 18 January 1945. He wrote, in part,\n\nDearest Mother: I find it rather hard to write even a letter as small as this. Of course, we can’t say much, but are being treated O.K. We have plenty books and I spend most of my time reading. I hope you will have plenty chicken when I get there. I think I could eat a couple all alone. … I wish you would send me some candy. Be sure it is something that will keep until it gets here, because it is a long trip. I’ll make up for these letters when I get home. Love to all, George\n\nGeorge wrote home again on 9 November 1944 while still in the hospital, but he would be released into the population of Stalag Luft IV before Thanksgiving. The letter was postmarked 17 January 1945 and his mother noted she received it on 23 March 1945. He wrote,\n\nDearest Mother: In a few more months I should be hearing from you and it will sure be nice. I think this is the longest I have ever gone without hearing from you. I hope you and Dad, and the rest of the family are getting along fine. As for myself, I am feeling fine, but miss that good cooking of yours. I’ll really keep you busy when I get home. I guess I have more luck than anyone to still be here, and not a thing wrong with me. Your prayers came in good. I still can’t believe I am alive. They said I was the only one out of my ship that is alive. Write often. Love, George\n\nGeorge wrote home again on 25 December 1944, Christmas Day. He wrote,\n\nDearest Mother: Hope everyone had a nice Christmas. We had as good as can be expected here. I am sorry I can’t send you a birthday card but do hope that you have a nice one. If you get a chance I wish you would send me some cigars, as I still don’t smoke cigarettes. Love to all, George.\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year’s Eve 1944, the families of the airmen aboard Farrar’s B-17 received a list of names and addresses for next of kin of the entire crew that had been reported missing on 28 September. The families immediately began writing each other, sharing hope for good news of their loved ones, and relaying sad news when it came. The only family to receive good news was the Farrar family and that good news, that their son was a prisoner of war, came on New Year’s Eve 1944.\n\nGeorge’s mother, Raleigh Mae Farrar, wrote to her son on 19 January 1945, having just received his 24 October 1944 letter the previous day. She would not yet have seen George’s Christmas greetings asking for cigars instead of cigarettes. She wrote, in part,\n\nMy Dear Boy, We were so happy to get your letter yesterday. Do write as often as possible for its so good to hear from you.\n\nI mailed you a box and sent in order for cigaretts. If you need clothes let me know. I can send them. Things here at home are just about the same. Dad doesn’t improve. I will be on the look out for some good candy and as I know now what I can send, I will be ready when my next labels come. I do hope you get the box. We all love you and hope and pray you will get along good. I will try to send some books.\n\nBe good and write. Lots and Lots of Love, Mother\n\nA little over two weeks after Raleigh Farrar sent the letter to her son, George Farrar and the other remaining prisoners were marched from Stalag Luft IV. Her letter was marked “RETURNED TO SENDER By Direction of the War Department. Undeliverable as Addressed.” It was returned to her, but she saved the letter to give her son after he returned home from the war. I doubt this package and any others she sent made it back from Germany.\n\nOn 31 January 1945, John Buslee, the father of the pilot, John Oliver “Jay” Buslee, of George Farrar’s B-17, wrote to George’s mother to share his family’s sad news.\n\nDear Mrs. Farrar:\n\nOn January 28 we received a telegram from the Adjutant General at Washington, D.C. advising that our son John O. was killed in action on September 28 while over Germany.\n\nThis, you can realize, was shocking news, particularly as we felt the time was in our favor and that the delay in definite word reaching us was due to his being a prisoner of war.\n\nHaving promised to keep you advised of any news reaching us prompts writing this letter. Mrs. Buslee, my daughter and self just can’t realize that the word sent to us is correct. We are hopeful that some error has been made due to all of the confusion in war-torn Germany and that we will ultimately get different word from our son.\n\nWe trust that you have heard recently from your son, George, and that he is in good health.\n\nSincerely yours, John Buslee\n\nOn 8 February 1945, two days after George Farrar marched out of Stalag Luft IV with his column from Lager D of the camp, Mr. Buslee wrote a letter to George. He wrote, in part,\n\nDear George,\n\nA few days ago I received your new address from your Mother and was greatly pleased to know that she heard from you and I was more pleased to learn that you were in good health. That is sure splendid news.\n\nWe look forward to the day when you … can come to Chicago and we will try to make your visit interesting. There are many things of interest in this big city …\n\nMy wife and I so thoroughly enjoyed meeting you yes it hardly seems like almost a year ago as so many things have happened since then. She has asked me to greet you most sincerely and requests me to extend to you a most cordial welcome to visit us.\n\nWell George space is limited so I will close with the wish that all of the best is yours and hope you continue to feel fine.\n\nSincerely yours, John Buslee\n\nMr. Buslee’s letter was marked “RETURNED TO SENDER By Direction of the War Department. Undeliverable as Addressed.” It was returned to Mr. Buslee, who must have given it to George after the war.\n\nShortly after Mr. Buslee wrote to George Farrar, probably about 13 February 1945 (letter postmarked 16 February), his Aunt Will, his father’s sister Willie Brent Farrar Burnham, wrote to him from her home in Charleston, South Carolina. Her letter was also marked “RETURNED TO SENDER By Direction of the War Department. Undeliverable as Addressed.”\n\nThe correspondence from George Edwin Farrar’s mother, his aunt, and his pilot’s father show how unaware the families at home were of the POWs’ situation in Germany and how little and late news was received from overseas. At what point would they understand that the prisoners of war, the lucky airmen who had survived air war disasters, were not sitting safely behind barbed wire, but were instead being starved and force-marched across war-torn Pomerania and Germany?\n\nRed Cross Prisoners of War Bulletin – February 1945\n\nThe only other form of communication regarding the families’ loved ones held prisoner of war by the Germans (and Japanese) was the monthly mailed newsletter published by the Red Cross. While we know that all the prisoners of Stalag Luft IV were evacuated from that camp in late January and early February 1945, their families at home were not aware of this development.\n\nIn an article in the February 1945 issue of the Bulletin, we see that while families of POWs relied on this news of their loved ones for information, the Bulletin did not arrive in all of their hands in a timely fashion. I doubt any of the families received it any earlier than mid-month of the month of issue, but the mailing was delayed for many next of kin, with the length of wait for news unknown. A new system, which began in February 1945 would attempt to place the current month’s newsletter in the hands of the next of kin late in the month of issue. The article stated,\n\nDelayed Mailing\n\nFor reasons beyond the control of the American Red Cross, there was considerable delay in mailing to some next of kin of prisoners of war the November, December, and January issues of the Bulletin. Many relatives have written expressing anxiety about their prisoner kin because the Bulletin was late in reaching them, but nonreceipt, or delayed receipt, is no cause for apprehension.\n\nA new addressing system has now been put into effect, and it is hoped that, from February onward, all copies of the Bulletin will have been mailed to regular readers by the middle of the month of issue.\n\nWhile this issue of the Bulletin did not share any news that Stalag Luft IV had been evacuated and the prisoners disbursed to other camps or set off marching by foot across Pomerania and Germany, it did report that the camp was close to the combat zone in late January. The article in full, reported,\n\nCamp Movements\n\nThis issue of the Bulletin contains a revised map showing the location of German camps and hospitals where American prisoners of war are held. The map is based on information received here to December 31, 1944, but the Russian advances in January will have brought many changes.\n\nDuring December, word was received that Stalag 357, near Toruń [in Poland], had been moved [to Fallingbostel, where some Stalag Luft IV POWS would be interned in late March and April 1945]. Stalag XX A was also probably moved from Toruń. These camps contained mainly British prisoners. The men at Oflag 64, the principal camp for American ground force officers, at Szubin (Altburgund), which was in the general vicinity of Stalag XX A and Stalag 357, were presumably moved to the interior of Germany in January, although they were still at Szubin on January 5. Hammerstein, the town nearest to Stalag II B, one of the largest camps for Americans, appeared to be in Russian hands when this was written on January 27.\n\nIt must be expected that some, if not all, of the prisoners of war at Stalag VIII B, Stalag 344, B.A.B. 20, B.A.B. 21, Stalag Luft VII, and at other camps in and around Silesia, were moved. These, also, were largely British camps, but some of them contained Americans. There were other camps and work detachments scattered throughout eastern Europe containing Allied prisoners of various nationalities. Grosstychow, in Pomerania, where Stalag Luft IV with its large complement of British and American airmen was located, was close to the combat zone in late January.\n\nWhile under reasonably quiet conditions it is easy for the German authorities to move an Oflag or a Stalag Luft, where all the prisoners are behind barbed wire, the orderly transfer of scores of thousands of men from Stalags with far flung work detachments would need much advance preparation. A camp like 344 at Lamsdorf, for instance, had about 30,000 men (principally British) on work detachments over a large area. So, too, had Stalag II B. Before these men could be moved in anything like orderly fashion, they would first have to be assembled at the base camp.\n\nIt will probably be some weeks yet before a full report is received on camp changes which have taken place during January, but, as authoritative information comes through, it will be promptly released to the public. Every effort is being made by the American authorities and the Red Cross to obtain this information. Arrangements were made well ahead so that the needs of any Allied prisoners falling into Russian hands during the present advance would be met .\n\nUntil next of kin are advised by the Office of the Provost Marshal General of a change of address, they should continue sending mail to the old address.\n\nUp to late January, the German authorities had given no indication of the camps to which American prisoners captured on the western front in the second half of December had been assigned, but seriously wounded Americans who were repatriated by air in the latter part of January stated that several hundred officers had reached Oflag 64 early in the month, and that about 1,500 additional enlisted men had reached Stalag II B. Several thousand newly captured Americans also reached Stalag IV B at Miihlberg in January. Large shipments of Red Cross supplies were made last November and December to German camps and hospitals containing Americans, so that the needs of the men captured in the December action on the western front had been in large part anticipated. If some of these men now show up at camps not already serviced, the International Committee of the Red Cross at Geneva has standing instructions to forward supplies instantly word is received of new camps for Americans. There is also a pooling arrangement, which has worked admirably, between the American and British Commonwealth Red Cross societies whereby our prisoners receive British food and clothing when American supplies are not immediately available, and vice versa.\n\nNews did not travel quickly during World War II. Families receiving this newsletter would not be at all aware that their loved ones in Stalag Luft IV had been evacuated from the camp weeks before receiving the bulletin. And I hope that whoever wrote that it would be “easy” for the Germans to move the entire population of a prisoner of war camp had a chance later in life to read the diaries and logs of the prisoners of the camp for the opportunity to rethink that opinion.\n\nPOW Bulletin Map of POW Camps in Pomerania and Germany\n\nThe map of POW camps on which my grandmother, Raleigh Mae Farrar, circled the location of her son’s POW Camp. At the end of February 1945, she and the families of other Stalag Luft IV POWs, likely had no idea the prisoners were no longer held in this camp.\n\nAn accompanying article noted,\n\nNew Camps\n\nSince the material was collected for the map of German camps and hospitals published in this issue, it has become known that the following camps also contain American prisoners of war, and should therefore be added:\n\nStalag V G at Offenburg southeast of Strasbourg, Province of Bavaria (A 3)\n\nStalag VI G at Osnabriick, in the province of Hannover (A 2)\n\nStalag XIII B at Weiden, northeast of Niirnberg, in the province of Franconia (B 3)\n\nAnother interesting article in the February 1945 issue was,\n\nStalag VII A at Moosburg\n\nThe American strength at Stalag VII A increased during last October by about 1,300, and by nearly 2,000 in November, the number at the end of that month being over 5,500. This figure included officers, noncoms, and enlisted men captured in Italy. Sgt. B. M. Belman was the American spokesman. At the end of October, Stalag VII A also contained about 9,000 British prisoners of war, as well as prisoners of other nationalities. About one-half of the British and one-third of the American prisoners were assigned to work detachments, most of the Americans being employed on farms.\n\nThere have been frequent complaints of overcrowding and inadequate facilities in the Stalag, and it is likely that the strain on the base camp is being relieved by assigning more men to work detachments outside.\n\nThis information is of note as many Stalag Luft IV POWs had been sent by rail to Nuremberg in late January and early February 1945, and would later be marched to Moosburg, where they were eventually liberated in late April 1945.\n\nSummary\n\nWhile the POWs of Stalag Luft IV were evacuated from the camp in late January and early February 1945, the families of these airmen were not aware of their plight, either of those moved by rail to other camps or those forced to march through war-torn Pomerania and Germany.\n\nNext week, a return to the march of prisoners in early March 1945.\n\nNotes/Sources\n\nThe Online Books Page in their serial archive listings for Prisoners of War Bulletin\n\nPrevious posts\n\nKriegsgefangenenpost\n\nFirst Letter Home from Prison Camp\n\nSecond Letter Home from Prison Camp\n\nMerry Christmas…\n\nMy Dear Boy\n\nA Letter from Aunt Will\n\nThe Buslees Receive Bad News\n\nMr. Buslee Writes to George Edwin Farrar\n\nStalag Luft IV POWs Evacuated to Nuremberg and Moosburg, Part 1\n\nStalag Luft IV POWs Evacuated to Nuremberg and Moosburg, Part 2\n\n© Cindy Farrar Bryan and The Arrowhead Club, 2024\n\nStalag Luft IV Lager C prisoner William Lee “Bill” Cupp was born in Davenport, Scott County, Iowa on 23 September 1923 to Thesta Ruth Peters and Samuel Clayton Cupp. Bill grew up in DeWitt and on a farm near Tipton, Iowa. He graduated from Tipton High School in 1941, and attended Iowa State College in Ames before joining the Army Air Corps in 1942.\n\nWilliam Lee Cupp registered for the WWII draft on 30 June 1942 at the age of 18. He noted he resided in Davenport, Scott County, Iowa and worked for the Herman Nelson Company in Moline, Illinois. He recorded his height as 5’6″, his weight as 140 pounds, and had brown eyes, brown hair, and a light complexion. A physical characteristic that would aid in identification was an appendicitis scar.\n\nJust a few days later, on 2 July 1942, William L. Cupp, ASN 17097098, enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces reserves in Des Moines, Iowa. At the time, he listed his residence as Scott County, Iowa. He received a deferment at that time, likely to attend college, although his enlistment record noted his civilian occupation as draftsman.\n\nBill Cupp was called to active duty as an Aviation Cadet in January 1943. He attended Pre-flight School at the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center, and Primary Flight School at Uvalde, Texas. In July 1943, Bill’s flight training ended, and he was sent to Basic Training at Sheppard Field, Texas, followed by Aerial Gunnery Training at Tyndall Field, Florida.\n\nIn September 1943, Bill Cupp was assigned to pilot Floyd Addy’s B-24 bomber crew, on which Bill became the ball turret gunner. The crew trained at Biggs Field, Texas from October 1943 to January 1944. The Addy crew completed their crew training at McCook, Nebraska. In April 1944, the crew ferried a new B-24 Liberator bomber to England.\n\nThe crew was assigned to the 861st Bomb Squadron of the 493rd Bomb Group of the Mighty Eighth Air Force. On their first mission with the Group, Sgt. William L. Cupp and the Addy crew participated in the 6 June 1944 invasion of Normandy.\n\nAccording to the American Air Museum in Britain,\n\nThe 493rd Bomb Group was the last Eighth Air Force Group to become operational, flying their first combat mission from Debach, Suffolk, on D-Day, 6 June 1944. The Group was known as the “Fighting 493rd”, named by their Commanding Officer Colonel Elbert Helton, who held the post for over a year. The Group flew 157 bombing missions, their targets a range of strategic ones in Germany and tactical ones in northern France, Holland and along the Rhine.\n\nOn 14 June 1944, on the 493rd Bomb Group’s Mission #6, Bill Cupp and the Floyd Addy crew were assigned to fly B-24 #44-40460 Won Long Hop, a B-24 that had been scheduled to be scrapped on that same day, on a mission to bomb an enemy air base in the north of France at Laon-Athes. Pilot Addy told the crew that they were bombing that particular air base because, “Planes from that field have been harassing the invasion forces.”\n\nAccording to Cupp, Addy noted on this mission, “Command has issued orders that to increase speed and conserve fuel, ball turrets will remain retracted in flight. They’re to be lowered only when formations come under attack by enemy aircraft.” Bill Cupp, the crew’s ball turret gunner, was disappointed that although he would be along for the mission, he would not be manning his ball turret.\n\nThe 493rd Bomb Group’s Mission #6 was the Eighth Air Force’s Mission #412. Jack McKillop’s Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces notes for this mission,\n\nEUROPEAN THEATER OF OPERATIONS (ETO)\n\nSTRATEGIC OPERATIONS (Eighth Air Force): Mission 412: Bad weather again covers all strategic targets in Germany except one in the extreme N; a major effort is against tactical objectives, mainly in France; 1,357 of 1,525 bombers dispatched hit the targets listed below; 14 bombers are lost.\n\nThe 493rd Bomb Group’s B-24s were included in this group,\n\nOf 191 B-24s, 7 hit Ham-sur-Somme, 32 hit targets of opportunity, 52 hit Lille/Vendeville, 12 hit Calas Tres, 12 hit Denain Drousey, 39 hit Laon/Athies and 70 hit Chievres; 2 B-24s are lost, 2 damaged beyond repair and 56 damaged; 10 airmen are KIA, 2 WIA and 4 MIA.\n\nThe B-24 carrying Bill Cupp and the Addy crew was one of the B-24s noted as lost on this mission. Won Long Hop was damaged by flak, and the crew, except for the pilot, parachuted from the crippled B-24 over Belgium. All those who bailed out survived. Bill Cupp noted that Floyd Addy was killed while “averting destruction to the Belgian village of Wodecq.” Addy, whose wife was expecting their first child in a few weeks, was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his actions.\n\nBill Cupp was able to evade capture, being sheltered by the Belgian and French resistance from 14 June until 29 August 1944. On that date, he was captured by the Germans. After interrogation and transfer, he was held POW at Stalag Luft IV and on the march from that camp until his liberation on 26 April 1945. His POW record in the National Archives notes his last report date as 8 June 1945.\n\nFollowing the war, on 29 April 1946, Bill Cupp married his high school sweetheart Elizabeth Penningroth “Penny” Cupp. Bill and Penny had two children, son Alan and daughter Amy. Bill enrolled at the University of Iowa and there completed his B.A. degree in 1949, and M.A. degree in 1950. He went on to complete his Ph.D. in sociology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill in 1955.\n\nFor three years, Dr. William Lee Cupp taught human behavior and health at the Upstate Medical Center/School of the State University of New York at Syracuse, New York. From 1957 to 1964, he taught sociology and criminology at Butler University in Indianapolis, Indiana. From 1964 to 1975 he taught sociology at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota.\n\nIn 1977, Dr. Cupp finished an evaluation report on “Juvenile Probation in Ramsey County, Minnesota.” The last nine years of his teaching career, he taught sociology and criminology at Kearney State College, Kearney, Nebraska. Poor health forced him to retire and he and Penny returned to Northfield, Minnesota in 1987.\n\nAfter his retirement, William Cupp turned his thoughts back to his World War II experiences as an airman and prisoner of war. He wrote his book, A Wartime Journey: Bail-Out Over Belgium, and published it in 2002. It is a great source of information about the path of the march of prisoners evacuated from Germany’s Stalag Luft IV on 6 February 1945, a march on which my father, George Edwin Farrar, participated.\n\nI rely on William Cupp’s recorded story of the march in my current series of posts, especially to track the path taken by the Lager/Column C prisoners. Aside from this valuable information, I was touched by a passage Cupp recorded after describing a monastery he remembered passing while marching on 2 March 1945.\n\nAt times like this, I tried to maintain contact with the life I had formerly known. On Sundays, in particular, I would gauge the hour by the number of rest stops we had made. Then, at what I deemed to be 11 o’clock, I would imagine a church service in the little country church I had attended in my boyhood. My mind retraced the entire service from opening prayer to final benediction.\n\nIt would be disturbing a few weeks later to realize that a starving body would refuse to cling to such memories, and that I had become puzzled as to what part of the service followed another. I began to realize that the undernourished of the world simply could not be expected to devise remedies for their condition; they would need proper nutrition even before an attempt at a new life.\n\nA Wartime Journey: Bail-out Over Belgium World War II, page 353, by William L.

[World War II As I Remember It by Harold B. Farrar]\n\nPOW Herbert Gold seems to still be marching with the Lager/Column A “slow group” during Week 4.\n\nDay 22 (Tuesday, 27 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching.\n\nPOW Joseph Fioretti: Rest day. “Still here on this farm [location not identified, but on 22 February, Joe noted that his column was supposed to go to New Brandenburg [Neubrandenburg, Germany]. When we walk out of the barn we wade in mud and manure. Our shoes are always wet. I was about starved and was going to trade my watch for what food I could get. They won’t give me but couple loafs and some butter. We go to bed hungry and awake hungry. It sure is miserable but maybe it won’t last too long. I know I will remain hungry.

[The Shoe Leather Express, Book II, page 85, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nColumn A “Slow Group” POW Herbert Gold: Rest day at Bredenfelde [Bredenfelde, Germany], where he likely arrived on 23 February. “Same place, no move as yet, clear day at last. All we had was spud soup today.” [The Diary of T/Sgt. Herbert Gold, POW 3701, 27 February entry, by Herbert Gold]\n\nDay 23 (Wednesday, 28 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching.\n\nPOW Joseph Fioretti: Rest day. “Still here on same farm. I feel full now just drank about 3 cans of milk. I got out of the barn (almost got shot getting it). I traded some soap for 1/5 loaf of bread last night to a guard. Today is first day the sun has shone since on this trip. Rumors that Turkey has entered the war and that allies are moving on west front. Sure wish it hurries and ends.” The rumor was true. Turkey declared war on Germany in late February 1945. [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 13, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: No move today. Get spud soup.

We got a Red Cross parcel per man but still no bread. I’ll have to try to make it last at least three weeks because I think we will be on road that much longer. Rumors are that war should end soon and also that we are to walk some 200 km more before we are housed somewhere. We are now in a large horse barn. There are some 500 men here. The barn is divided in corrals and there are eight men per corral. We are packed like sardines in a can. The wind is tremendous, about three times as bad here as in Oklahoma. The wind almost blows you down as you leave the barn.” [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 13, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: No move today. Stew.

We got barley for dinner which was very good after so long a time just eating boiled spuds. I don’t know how long I will be here, but we are treated O.K. My feet are still bothering me and I had G.I. and fever.” [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 13, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: Sat in a barn.

[The Shoe Leather Express, Book I, page 35, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nPOW William Cupp: “… we were led through the barnyard of the big barn, where we joined the rest of our contingent.” “We arrived that evening at the village of Kargow [Kargow, 17192, Germany].” Bill described their quarters as “different from any other we had so far experienced … a low building, divided into a number of pens, that possibly had been used to house calves or pigs. But there was no odor of pigs, for which I was grateful.” Dinner was drinking water and potatoes. [A Wartime Journey: Bail-out Over Belgium World War II, pages 351 – 352, by William L. Cupp]\n\nDay 24 (Thursday, 1 March 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching, or distance not recorded.\n\nPOW Larry Moses: No entry.

[The Shoe Leather Express, Book I, page 35, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nPOW William Cupp: “Shortly after the beginning of our journey … our small road intersected with a highway leading to the city of Waren. The scenery changed, for we seemed to be in a district of lakes. As we entered Waren [Waren, 17192, Müritz, Germany] we were passing between two bodies of water. After leaving the city, the highway swung to the southeast, following a narrow spit between lakes. Then we left the highway, taking small roads to a place named Gohren-Lebbin [Göhren-Lebbin, Germany], made distinctive by its two huge barns.” [A Wartime Journey: Bail-out Over Belgium World War II, page 352, by William L. Cupp]\n\nDay 25 (Friday, 2 March 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: 20 km by Larry Moses. 28 km by Bob Richards.

[The Shoe Leather Express, Book I, page 35, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nPOW William Cupp: On this day’s march, Bill could see the spire of a monastery. Past the monastery, “the road followed a causeway into Malchow [Malchow, Germany], where the narrow end of a lake divided the small city.” “We walked up the hill past Malchow’s church and cemetery, and continued on this highway for several kilometers, where we piled into a large barn for the night.” Bill Cupp also mentions passing over a swing bridge. Laura Edge notes that this bridge was destroyed in WWII, but was rebuilt and in operation today. [A Wartime Journey: Bail-out Over Belgium World War II, page 353, by William L.

Cupp]\n\nDay 27 (Sunday, 4 March 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: 14 km by Larry Moses. 23 km by Bob Richards. 15 km by William Cupp.\n\nPOW Larry Moses: Karow. 14 km. Larry Moses noted the location of Kargow [Kargow, 17192, Germany] on Day 25, then Liebbin [Göhren-Lebbin, Germany] on Day 26, so I am not certain of the location of Karow that he mentions today, Day 27.

Cupp]\n\nLager/Column D\n\nI am following the logs of Lager D POWs Cecil Room, Percy Carruthers, Glenn Bordner, and John Bossley. Cecil Room was a POW in the same barracks, Barracks 4 of Lager D, as my father George Edwin Farrar, so I believe his records most closely indicate my father’s marching path (except when Cecil was at the barn hospital or marching in the slow group).\n\nPOW John Bossley recorded place names, but not dates. I am still uncertain if John Bossley is marching with Column C or D.\n\nDay 22 (Tuesday, 27 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: Cecil and Jack Paul remain at Briggow [Briggow, Germany]. “Barley again for lunch and at 5pm also. Very sleepless night and we’re very overcrowded, more blokes falling sick every day.” [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 27 February entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Percy’s column, consisting of Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7, remained at Herr Johan Sinnig’s farm at Schwandt, Germany [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany].

Cecil had been moved into a very draughty barn and was cold to the point of shivering. He notes a man died this day from an infection on his knee. Also, Red Cross parcels arrived from Lubeck and each man was issued his own parcel which was to last him until the end of the march. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 28 February entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Percy’s column, consisting of Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7, remained at Herr Johan Sinnig’s farm at Schwandt, Germany [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany].

Hands and feet frozen and unable to peel our few spuds so we eat them with the jackets on. Deadly business answering the call of nature in the open air. Half a bloody gale blows around your rear! Not at all funny. Stay under the blanket and overcoat most of the day, warmest place by far.” [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 2 March entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Percy’s column, consisting of Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7, remained at Herr Johan Sinnig’s farm at Schwandt, Germany [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany].

[Glen Bordner private diary, courtesy of Laura Edge]\n\nDay 26 (Saturday, 3 March 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching, except for Cecil Room who recorded 5 miles with the slow group.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: At 12.30 pm Cecil and Jack “leave the farm [the barn hospital at Briggow] after our long rest. Five miles to Luplow [Luplow, 17091 Rosenow, Germany – where POW Allen King reported being on 24 February and a few days following] along cart tracks and ploughed fields. At least we are a little warmer on the march. Good billet, eight of us in a small barn and Jack and I cook some stolen spuds over a wood fire outside and along with a stolen onion they taste delicious!” 5 miles. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 3 March entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Percy’s column, consisting of Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7, remained at Herr Johan Sinnig’s farm at Schwandt, Germany [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany].

We go so slowly, I even think a snail would pass us. Our blankets are soon wet and frozen stiff. Decide to rejoin the mob as soon as we can, this pace is killing us!” Along the road they see, “Many evacuees from Stettin area.” “Vossfeld [Voßfeld, 17091 Rosenow-Groß Flotow, Germany] 1pm, Marhin [unknown location] 1.45pm, Musselhagen [Möllenhagen, Germany] 2pm, Rockow [Rockow, 17219 Möllenhagen, Germany] then Muckelhei [unknown location] for the night.” 14 miles. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 4 March entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Percy’s column, consisting of Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7, left Herr Johan Sinnig’s farm at Schwandt, Germany [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany] on this date. Percy wrote, “The intense cold continued, and it snowed heavily on Sunday 4th March when we said goodbye to Herr Sinnig. I kept my promise on my return to England and put matters right at interrogation, that he be suitably recognised for his help. I have no doubt, he saved many airmen’s lives.” “We covered nearly 80 km in the next three days.” [Of Ploughs, Planes and Palliasses by Percy Wilson Carruthers, pages 210 – 211]\n\nPOW Glenn Bordner: Scharandorf. 33 km. [Glen Bordner private diary, courtesy of Laura Edge]\n\nDay 28 (Monday, 5 March 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: 17 1/2 miles by Cecil Room. 30 km by Glenn Bordner. 80 km over this and the previous and next day by Percy Carruthers.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: “Off at 8.30am with 1/6 loaf of bread and 1/5 parcel of Red Cross food issued on the roadside. … Air raid in progress, plenty of fighters and vapour trails at 20,000 feet! Wo ist der Luftwaffe? The USAAF are very much in evidence. Hear the bombs dropping. Lovely sound, but too near for my liking. Waren [Waren, 17192, Germany] at 11.30 am, long trek through the town and we all feel hungry at the sight of food in the shops, and civilians dining in the local restaurant. An old codger gives me a kick in the pants as I go past, apparently he hates us. I can’t do a thing, just swear like fury under my breath. Pass a Stalag on the other side of the town and wish to hell we could go in there. Roads improving now and we are off the cobblestones that are so prevalent in German towns but at the same time we’re just about on our knees. … Passed through the town of Klink [Klink, Germany] at 3pm then off into the woods and reach Warnhof [likely Wendhof, 17213 Göhren-Lebbin, Germany] at 4.30pm.” 17 1/2 miles.

Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 5 March entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers, leading Lager D Barracks 5, 6, and 7: Marching on this date, covering nearly 80 km between 4 – 6 March. “Dead horses were again to be seen on the roadsides, their flesh having been hacked off to the bones.”[Of Ploughs, Planes and Palliasses by Percy Wilson Carruthers, pages 210 – 211]\n\nPOW Glenn Bordner: Lexon. 30 km. [Glen Bordner private diary, courtesy of Laura Edge]\n\nPOW John Bossley: notes Zahren [Zahren, 19386 Gallin-Kuppentin, Germany] in an undated entry. No distance recorded. [John Bossley private log, courtesy of Laura Edge]. From his current log entries, I suspect John Bossley could be marching with Lager/Column C rather than Lager/Column D.\n\nRed Cross Report\n\nThree entries were made in an International Red Cross report regarding Stalag Luft IV during this fourth week of the march, all dated 28 February 1945.\n\nIntercross reports this camp to be split up as follows: 1500 going to Luft I, 1550 going to Luft 3, and 3600 divided between Stalag II B [correction: 11B or XI-B] and 357 at FALLINGBOSTEL 90° 45′ E 52° 50′ N. The designation Stalag Luft IV will be given to a new Air Camp now under construction at WOBLING beiLUDWIGSBURG.\n\nThe POW’s are in the neighborhood of Teterow and Demmin and are moving towards Boizenburg and Military Area X.\n\nThe remaining 3600 POW’s are en route to Stalags XI/B and 357 at Fallingbostel. The Headquarters at Stalagluft 4 will later administer the camp being formed at Wobblingen near Ludwigslust.\n\nWe know that the transfer of POWs by rail, 1500 to Luft I (1 – Barth), and 1550 to Luft III (3), happened in late January and early February 1945, before the three columns, A, C, and D, of marchers evacuated Stalag Luft IV on 6 February 1945. The numbers of these POWs are not verified.\n\nWe learn that in the eight days since 20 February, the location of the “unknown destination” in that day’s report to which prisoners would be transported by rail has been determined to be Fallingbostel.\n\nThe report notes that 3600 POWs will be divided between Stalags XI-B and 357 at Falllingbostel, but this number is not verified either.\n\nNo mention is made of the POWs that are to be sent to Stalag XI-A at Altengrabow on the same date POWs are sent to Fallingbostel.\n\nThe total number of POWs mentioned in these statements is 6650,\n\n1500 going to Luft I\n\n1550 going to Luft 3\n\n3600 to Fallingbostel, Stalags XI-B and 357\n\nA statement on the report dated 19 February noted 6,165 POWs marching near Usedom. If 3600 are going to Fallingbostel, where are the remaining 2565 going?\n\nAnd we learn that as late as 28 February 1945, a new [POW] Air Camp is under construction at Wobbelin Bei Ludwigslust and plans are for it to take the name of the evacuated camp, Stalag Luft IV. It’s possible the plan was for the POWs to be temporarily housed in other POWs camps like those at Fallingbostel until the new Air Camp was completed.\n\nThe Shoe Leather Express, Book IV, pages 127 – 128, by Joseph O’Donnell\n\nMaps of Week 4 of the March of Prisoners of Stalag Luft IV\n\nDuring Days 22 to 28 (Tuesday, 27 February through Monday, 5 March 1945), the columns of marchers were still rather spread out, but marching in the same general area and in the same direction, west. For this reason, I am providing maps from the separate columns.\n\nWeek 4 map for the Column A slow group. Unfortunately, the main Column A marchers did not provide location names in their logs. These locations were provided by the slow group of Column A marchers. The slow group marchers’ path went through these places [bolded names noted on map].\n\nStarting at Bredenfelde [Bredenfelde, Germany] (slow group)\n\nLehsten [Lehsten, 17219 Möllenhagen, Germany]\n\nMollendhagen [Möllenhagen, Germany]\n\nPethwisch [Rethwisch, 17219 Möllenhagen, Germany]\n\nWaren (Moritz) [Waren, 17192, Müritz, Germany]\n\nWeisin [Weisin, 19386 Passow, Germany]\n\nWeek 4 map for Column C. The marchers’ path went through these places [bolded names noted on map].\n\nStarting at Gross Helle [Groß Helle, 17091 Mölln, Germany]\n\nKargow [Kargow, 17192, Germany]\n\nWaren [Waren, 17192, Müritz, Germany]\n\nGohren-Lebbin [Göhren-Lebbin, Germany]\n\nMalchow [Malchow, Germany]\n\nZarchlin [Zarchlin, 19395 Barkhagen, Germany]\n\nZahren [Zahren, 19386 Gallin-Kuppentin, Germany]\n\nStralendorf [Stralendorf, Germany]\n\nWeek 4 map for Column D. The marchers’ path went through these places [bolded names noted on map].\n\nStarting at the farm of Herr Johan Sinnig, Schwandt [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany]\n\nKargow [Kargow, 17192, Germany] D or C column for John Bossley?\n\nGohren-Lebbin [Göhren-Lebbin, Germany]\n\nZahren [Zahren, 19386 Gallin-Kuppentin, Germany]\n\nNote: I have not mapped the locations noted by Glenn Bordner of Scharandorf and Lexon as I cannot determine where they might be on the map. However, looking ahead at further entries in his log, I believe he might be following a similar path as the Column A slow group. Note that Briggow, the point from which he departed on this portion of the march, is very close to the starting point of Column A of Bredenfelde.\n\nWeek 4 map for the Column D sick party. Column D POW Cecil Room was marching with the Column D sick party at this time in the march. Cecil notes this path taken by the sick party, with bolded names noted on map,\n\nStarting at the sick barn in Briggow [Briggow, Germany]\n\nLuplow [Luplow, 17091 Rosenow, Germany]\n\nVossfeld [Voßfeld, 17091 Rosenow-Groß Flotow, Germany]\n\nMusselhagen [Möllenhagen, Germany]\n\nRockow [Rockow, 17219 Möllenhagen, Germany]\n\nWaren [Waren, 17192, Germany]\n\nKlink [Klink, Germany]\n\nWarnhof [likely Wendhof, 17213 Göhren-Lebbin, Germany]\n\nNote: I have not mapped the locations noted by Cecil Room of Marhin and Muckelhei as I cannot determine where they might be on the map.\n\nOverall Route zoomed out for perspective…\n\nI believe that by the end of Week 4, most of the Stalag Luft IV POWs on the march were somewhere in the area between Zahren [Zahren, 19386 Gallin-Kuppentin, Germany] and Stralendorf [Stralendorf, Germany].\n\nTo be continued…\n\nNotes\n\nOf Ploughs, Planes and Palliasses by Percy Wilson Carruthers, available in the UK, and in the US through used book sources\n\nA Wartime Journey: Bail-out Over Belgium World War II by William L.

[World War II As I Remember It by Harold B. Farrar]\n\nI am also including Lager/Column A “slow group” POW Herbert Gold’s diary entries in this group for Week 3. The “slow group” may have caught up with or nearly caught up with Column A by this point. Herbert Gold’s overnight outdoors was on 14 February and his ferry ride and border crossing was on 15 February, like Column C, and I included his records with Column C in the previous post.\n\nDay 15 (Tuesday, 20 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching, or distance not recorded.\n\nPOW Joseph Fioretti: A rest day. “There are 800 of us crowded in a barn.” “We haven’t anywhere particular to go. They are just walking us in circles.” “They are slowly starving us and walking us to death.” “I don’t know how much longer we can last but there will be another day. They wait until we get in bed then serve us hot water. Just imagine 800 men in a barn running out to get hot water. You’re lucky to get some and if not careful you’ll get trampled to death. They served some kind of soup about 1/2 cup per man today but I wasn’t able to get any. My feet were too sore to fight my way through the crowd.” [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 11, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: No move today, get spuds.

[The Shoe Leather Express, Book II, page 85, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nColumn A “Slow Group” POW Herbert Gold: “Rode the sick wagon that day, received 1/3 Red Cross Parcel. Went through Wolde [Wolde, 17091, Germany]. Were split up from fellow who had parcel, so the two of us were without Red Cross for the day as it was day of rest. 18 km.” [The Diary of T/Sgt. Herbert Gold, POW 3701, 21 February entry, by Herbert Gold]\n\nDay 17 (Thursday, 22 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: 10 km by Joseph Fioretti. 15 miles by James McCloskey.\n\nPOW Joseph Fioretti: “We are in a barn close to an airport. Hope R.A.F. don’t bomb tonight.” “We are going to New Brandenburg about 70 km from here.” 10 km. [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 11, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: (15 miles). Walked till 8 p.m. through “DAMMEN” [possibly Dennin, 17392 Spantekow, Germany or possibly a reference to the Demmin administrative district in the northeastern German state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]. 15 miles. [The Shoe Leather Express, Book II, page 85, by Joseph O’Donnell]\n\nColumn A “Slow Group” POW Herbert Gold: “Day off, had only spuds, as no Red X, what a mess.

Joe made a general observation, not specifically noted for this date, that, “We walk all day on a slice of bread and about 5 boiled spuds for supper.” “There are about 500 of us here in a barn.” “We will be on the road a couple more days so they say. This is the 20th day and we were suppose to walk only about 125 km when we started.” [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 12, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: No move today.

We are all about half starved from nothing to eat.” “I don’t know how long we will be here. Maybe four or five days. The Germans don’t know what to do with us. I think they are waiting to build a place to put us in.” [The Diary of Joe Fioretti, Jr. 38473591, page 12, by Joseph Fioretti, Jr.]\n\nPOW James McCloskey: No move today.

At least for now, his log seems to match Column C marcher Larry Moses.\n\nDay 15 (Tuesday, 20 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest day by Moses and Richards. 15 km by William Cupp.\n\nPOW Larry Moses: No entry.

But as the day unfolded, our concerns surfaced once more, for our route circled back to the north, then west, and south, then straight toward the east once more. Speculation was rife among the walkers; were our captors unsure of our destination? Were they simply trying to keep us on the road?” Arrived at Gross Helle [Groß Helle, 17091 Mölln, Germany], where they would remain until leaving the morning of 28 February.

Cecil Room was a POW in the same barracks, Barracks 4 of Lager D, as my father George Edwin Farrar, so I believe his records most closely indicate my father’s marching path.\n\nPOW John Bossley recorded place names, but not dates.\n\nI am also including information from POW Allen King, who provided a narrative rather than a diary or log to Joseph O’Donnell for his Shoe Leather Express books.\n\nDay 15 (Tuesday, 20 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: Rest, no marching, or distance not recorded.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: Day of rest. After a fresh cup of milk straight from the cow plus seven potatoes for breakfast, Cecil became violently sick. He believed it was too much for him to eat at once since they have had so little food lately. He sold the blue pullover an aunt made him, which he was wearing when he was shot down, for 1/2 loaf of bread and some cooked beans. Cecil notes that they are to march five miles the next day, then sixteen miles the day after to Neubrandenburg where they are to stay in a Stalag. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 20 February entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: “We were now following very rough muddy roads in well-forested areas. Sickness, mostly dysentery, was taking a heavy toll, many of the boys being unable to continue. It became evident that in order to prevent total chaos we would have to remain stationary for a few days of recovery. We stayed at Schossow [Schossow, 17091 Tützpatz, Germany] for a couple of days.” POW Nick Green died of pneumonia. POW Ken Stanley also died at this time. “Even Vic Clark was looking quite ill and surely could not go on much longer.” [Of Ploughs, Planes and Palliasses by Percy Wilson Carruthers, pages 208 – 209]\n\nPOW Glenn Bordner: Rest day. [Glen Bordner private diary, courtesy of Laura Edge]\n\nDay 16 (Wednesday, 21 February 1945)\n\nDistance recorded: 7 miles by Cecil Room. 9 km by Glenn Bordner.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: There was not enough soup at breakfast to go around and Cecil did not get any. The German guards bought bread in the village, for themselves. Cecil remarks that, “They [the Germans] can’t even feed their own troops, let alone us poor prisoners.” Cecil is sick by the roadside later and his marching buddy Jack Paul is sick in the barn that night. Jack has been eating the beans Cecil traded for the previous day. At Gutzhow [Gützkow, 17091 Röckwitz, Germany], they were housed in a decent barn and received spuds for dinner. 7 miles. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 21 February entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: Likely remained at Schossow [Schossow, 17091 Tützpatz, Germany].

Rest day by Cecil Room and Glenn Bordner.\n\nPOW Cecil Room: Day of rest. Cecil’s rations for the day include one cup of lukewarm water (for which he waited in line for 1 1/2 hours) in the morning, and potatoes, a cup of soup, and hot water in the afternoon. The Germans also issue rations of 2/5 loaf of bread, 1/11 lb. meat (“stinking corned beef”), and 1/4 lb. of margerine. Cecil still had a weak stomach and was sick three times this day. His marching buddy Jack was still not feeling well and very weak. [POW Cecil A. Room’s (Lager/Column D) online diary, 22 February entry]\n\nPOW Percy Carruthers: “[Lager D] Barracks 5, 6, and 7 comprised our column, and we arrived in the village of Schwandt [Schwandt, 17091 Rosenow, Germany] early afternoon after only about 18 km. [Schwandt measures 18 km distance from Schossow. It is unclear if Percy’s arrival here in Schwandt is on Day 17 or 18. Percy’s column may have had another day of rest in Schossow on this date.] We had lost barracks 8, 9, and 10, but found they had barns some distance away.

Percy promised to put in a good word with the British for the farmer’s help and have him compensated and receive favorable treatment. The barracks 8, 9, and 10 marchers were not getting as much food from their farmer and found their way to Percy’s column for food. Percy’s column shared, but suggested they rejoin their own column.

Harold was a distant cousin of my father, George Edwin Farrar of Lager D of the camp. I doubt either Harold or my father knew of each other as POWs as they were held in different compounds of the camp.\n\nBoth Harold and George descended from the same Farrar immigrant ancestors, Captain William and Cecily Farrar of England. Cecily arrived in America first, as a ten-year-old child in 1610. William Farrar arrived on American soil in 1618. They married in 1625 on the James River in Henrico County, Virginia.\n\nBoth Harold and George descended from William and Cecily Farrar through their son William II, and then his son Major William Farrar III. From that point the lineage splits, with George descending from William III’s oldest son, William IV, and Harold descending from William III’s youngest son, George.\n\nIn May 1942, Harold Farrar graduated from Sayre (Oklahoma) High School, and soon after graduation, took a bus with a friend to San Diego, where he stayed with his father who earlier had gone to San Diego to look for a job.\n\nWhile in San Diego, Harold worked at Consolidated Aircraft (later called General Dynamics-Convair), but once he got his draft notice, he returned to Oklahoma. Still considered a resident of San Diego, Harold enlisted and was inducted into the Army Air Forces at Fort Sill, Oklahoma on 15 February 1943, USAAF SN 38399678.\n\nIn his first military assignment, Harold reported to Sheppard Field, Wichita Falls, Texas for Basic Training. After Basic, he attended Aircraft Armorer Training at Buckley Field and Lowry Field in Denver, Colorado, then Aerial Gunnery School at Las Vegas, Nevada. Harold graduated as an Aerial Gunner and received his wings on 26 September 1943.\n\nHarold was promoted to Sergeant and sent to Salt Lake City Air Base to await assignment to a bomber crew. On 6 November 1943, Harold left Salt Lake City for Davis Monthan Air Base in Tucson, Arizona. He was assigned to a Consolidated B24 Bomber Training Group and became the Armorer/Tail Gunner of the Dale Tipton air combat crew.\n\nThe Tipton Crew was assigned to the 15th Army Air Forces, 465th Bomb Group, 781st Bomb Squadron, stationed at Pantanella Airbase in southern Italy. The airfield was sixty miles east of Bari, Italy, just above the “heel” on the “boot” of Italy.\n\nThe B24 crews of the 465th Bomb Group were required to fly fifty missions to earn a ticket home. The Tipton crew flew their first mission on 13 May 1944, the Group’s Mission #5.\n\nOn the Tipton crew’s eleventh mission on 31 May 1944, Harold and the Tipton crew flew the Group’s Mission #18 to the Dacia Roma Oil Refinery at Ploești (now Ploiești), Romania. They were hit by flak and the crew bailed out over the mountains of Montenegro, Yugoslavia.\n\nThe crew was rescued by Marshal Tito’s Partisans, who were actively engaged in the war against the Germans and Italians. The Partisan leaders were then assisted by an underground British liaison unit who requested air support to fly the Tipton crew back to Italy. The Tipton crew made their way back to base via a C47 cargo plane ten days after being shot down, and returned to combat on 22 June 1944.\n\nOn the Group’s 16 July 1944 Mission #45 to the Wiener Nuedorf Engine Works at Vienna, Austria, the Tipton crew of ten was shot down again. This time their B24, 41-29415, was damaged by both enemy fighters over northern Hungary and flak. Harold bailed out of a disabled B24 for the second time in his life and this time when he pulled the D ring, his parachute did not open. He could not find a way to get the chute to open, but eventually, the small pilot chute came out, pulling his main chute open. Harold believes he fell about 5000 feet before his chute finally opened.\n\nThe USAAF Chronology notes for the 16 July 1944 mission for the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO),\n\nSTRATEGIC OPERATIONS (Fifteenth Air Force): In Austria, around 380 bombers attack oil and aircraft targets in the Vienna area, bombing Munchendorf Airfield, Winterhafen oil depot, Vienna marshalling yard, and Wiener Neudorf engine factory; P-51s and P-38s fly 150+ sorties in escort while 132 other P-51s sweep the Vienna area; 100+ fighters oppose the raids; 10 AAF aircraft are lost and several others are missing; AAF claims of fighters shot down total 30+.\n\nWhen Harold landed, armed civilians surrounded him and he “was captured even before I got my parachute harness off.” All of the crew survived the jump, landing near a small town 30 miles north of Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and were taken prisoner. They were turned over to the Luftwaffe the next day.\n\nAll ten airmen of the Tipton crew survived as POWs through the end of the war. The four officers of the crew were transferred to Stalag Luft III. After almost three weeks of captivity, Harold arrived at Stalag Luft IV with the other five enlisted men of his crew on 4 August 1944. Harold was placed in Barracks 9 of Lager A.\n\nDetails of Harold Farrar’s and the Tipton crew’s capture is reported in (Missing Air Crew Report) MACR7196. Harold’s National Archives POW record incorrectly lists Harold B. Farrar’s (SN 38399678) capture date as 6 September 1944 rather than the correct date of 16 July 1944. Pilot Dale Tipton’s NARA POW record notes the correct date of his capture and also notes that he was transferred to Stalag VIIA at Moosburg during his captivity. All of the Tipton crew officers likely were liberated from Stalag VIIA.\n\nHarold Benjamin Farrar began writing his story, World War II As I Remember It, on 6 February 1995, the fiftieth anniversary of the start of the march of prisoners from Stalag Luft IV.\n\nBoth George Farrar and Harold Farrar were marched out of Stalag Luft IV on 6 Feburary 1945, George with Column D and Harold with Column A. Both were temporarily held at Fallingbostel during the march. Both were marched back out of the camp at Fallingbostel about a week later. Both were liberated on 2 May 1945.\n\nThere were actually three airmen named Farrar held in Stalag Luft IV. In his memoir [page 47], Harold Farrar also mentions a Stalag Luft IV POW named William H. (Henry) Farrar of Paterson, Passaic County, New Jersey. William was likely also held in Lager A as Harold notes talking to him in the camp. William Henry Farrar, SN 12121880, was from the 457th Bomb Group, a B-17 Group based in Glatton, England.\n\nAccording to the American Air Museum in Britain website, Sgt. William H. Farrar was a tail gunner with the 751st Bomb Squadron of the 457th Bomb Group and was shot down 19 May 1944 in B-17 #42-97481. Clearly, even though NARA and the American Air Museum websites note that William H. Farrar was a POW at Stalag Luft III, that information is not correct. William Henry Farrar was a POW at Stalag Luft IV.\n\nStalag Luft IV POW Leonard Rose notes a William H. Farrar (deceased) of Murrayville, GA in his POW list. This William Farrar is the same man, having moved from New Jersey to Georgia later in life. William Henry Farrar may be related to Harold and/or George Farrar further back in their Farrar lineage in England, but after an Ancestry search, I do not see a common ancestor between them in their Captain William Farrar lineage in America.\n\nIn his story, Harold Farrar includes a map of the marchers from Stalag Luft IV and includes the path of both the marchers who were sent by rail to Fallingbostel and the marchers sent by rail to Altengrabow.\n\nI have been following Harold Farrar’s story, World War II As I Remember It, from the evacuation of Stalag Luft IV on 6 February until his most recent entry of 16 – 18 February 1945. Harold pauses his dated entries at this point and does not resume them until 21 March. At this point in his story he offers some interesting information on several subjects regarding what it was like to be on the 86-day 500+ mile march of prisoners from Stalag Luft IV. The following quoted information is the intellectual property of Harold B. Farrar.\n\nThe Next Six Weeks\n\nFor the next six weeks we continued on the march in a similar manner to our first two weeks except we were now getting weaker and weaker from the lack of an adequate diet and the stress on our mind and body from exposure to the weather and other war conditions. At least now we traveled at a slower pace with more rest days since the threat that the Russians might liberate us had lessened once we crossed the Oder River.\n\nMost of these days are a blur in my memory, but on certain days some things a little unusual happened and are still somewhat vivid in my mind. I will not bore you by trying to describe the details of each exasperating day on the march, but will next try to give you a feel for some of those more unusual days as we learned to cope with prison life on the road.\n\nPersonal Hygiene\n\nWhen you rested at a farm at times we had access to well water and could wash our face, but it was too cold to do more than that.\n\nSo far on the march there had been absolutely no way that we could bathe and we only got to wash our face or hands a few times when we laid over in a barn for a day of rest. Also if you were at a farm with a great many prisoners crammed into a small area there was just not enough access to the water pump or for that matter any place to dispose of that much waste water if we could have gotten it. By now the skin on our legs had taken on a scaly look and many prisoners had blisters on their feet that had become infected.\n\nOn today’s march we took a rest break on a country road near a large pond. A few prisoners sat near the pond and couple guys took off their shoes and started to wash their feet. The guards did not stop them and gradually more and more shoes came off and a lot of feet were getting washed. As others joined in I moved over to an open spot, took off one shoe and started to wash my foot. I hardly got my foot into the water when one of the guards finally became aware of what was happening and got real excited and started waving his gun all around and yelling sort of a “Rouse mit you all” type commands and needless to say our foot washing caper came to a sudden halt.\n\nAs I think about it now the guard was probably right in stopping us because if we had all finished washing our feet in that pond, we would certainly have violated Al Gores latest “Clean Water Act” and probably killed every endangered fish in that pond forever. Later one of the American doctors marching with us warned us all not to wash or soak our feet again while we were on the march as the calluses we had developed on our feet helped protect us from getting additional blisters.\n\nWe also had to sleep with our clothes on because of the cold. We had picked up lice from the barns and they gave you fits at night when you were covered up and sleeping on the hay, but all we could do was try to pick them off our body which was no easy task when the temperature was near freezing.\n\nThe Barns\n\nAt times we stopped in small barns that would only accommodate 50 or 60 prisoners, on other nights large barns with more than a 100 prisoners, and on a few occasions a large farm complex with multiple barns and probably more than 1000 prisoners.\n\nOn this night we stopped at a very large long barn in which they stored hay. In the center of this two story high barn were double doors about ten feet tall that opened into a space about thirty feet wide. There were inner walls about twelve feet high on each side of the door and both ends of the barn on each side of the doors were full of hay. Hay was pushed over the walls and it fell down to ground level onto the thirty foot area in front of the doors for the sick to sleep on and everyone else climbed up the ladders on the wall and then crawled out on the loosely stacked hay to sleep.\n\nWith most everyone up in the loft there was a lot of noise all night long as a constant stream of prisoners were going up and down the ladders trying to get outside to relieve themselves. It was nearly morning when I heard a very strange swishing sound followed by a big thump and several voices started screaming out in pain. I had no idea what had happened and it was so dark I could not see anything, so I did not find out what had happened until later that morning.\n\nI learned that the hay was piled higher than the walls and in the night the hay shifted and carried one of the prisoners sleeping near the wall over the edge and the prisoner as well as a lot of hay landed on the sick prisoners sleeping below. I heard that there were injuries, but none were considered major. We stayed at this barn for a rest day as the wind was blowing very hard.\n\nThere was another unusual accident at this same barn in which a prisoner was accidentally killed. I was told that when a prisoner was exiting the barn a sudden gust of wind caused the large barn doors to slam shut and the edge of the door struck him in the head and later he died from the injury.\n\nFood\n\nUsually when several prisoners were together for any length of time most conversations turned to food. Everyone had their own special gourmet dish and as you might expect most recipes involved the richest desserts you could ever imagine…\n\nAir Activity\n\nThe Allied fighters both American and British Fighters seemed to have complete control of the skies and just roamed around up there and hit any target they spotted moving on the roads or train tracks. As we walked along you would hear a train chugging along and then you would see a fighter diving down, hear the guns firing, and shortly thereafter there would be a big column of smoke rising high into the air followed by complete silence. I saw this happen several times.\n\nAlso the German trucks that forced us off the road as we were walking along had a soldier looking out the back of the truck and usually a soldier sitting on the front fender always looking skyward. If they spotted a fighter they let out a yell and the driver headed the truck for the woods. They all would hop out and run madly for the cover of the woods before the truck stopped rolling. You could not really blame them because we saw a lot of burned truck chassis that had exploded and the trees were all charred and burnt and you would see fragments of green uniforms and what looked like body parts scattered through the trees.\n\nDuring this time we had a lot of scares ourselves. The first time a fighter dived at the group I was with we had just stopped to rest and we were all sitting alongside the road and he came right at us at tree top level, but for reasons I will never know, he did not fire, but pulled up and did not return.\n\nThere was one strafing incident that directly helped us when one of the British fighters killed a horse pulling one of the wagons and one of our leaders somehow managed to get part of it and have it cooked for us to eat.\n\nLater if we were walking along and the fighters came anywhere near us the German guards would move over closer to us and stay there until they left. If we had broken ranks and ran, I am sure they would have strafed us.\n\nHarold Farrar resumes his dated recollections on March 21st with,\n\nWe had now been on the march for six weeks heading in a southwesterly direction and had walked more than 360 miles since we left Luft IV.\n\nWorld War II As I Remember It, pages 54 – 55, by Harold B. Farrar\n\nI will pick Harold Farrar’s story back up as I resume my timeline of the march on Marching Day 43, 20 March 1945.\n\nAfter World War II, Harold Benjamin Farrar married Barbara Jean West on 31 March 1950.\n\nIn his memoir, Harold wrote that,\n\nTo this day I do not know exactly how many missions I received official credit for and in fact I do not even know how or who officially kept track of our mission completions.\n\nWorld War II As I Remember It, page 34, by Harold B. Farrar\n\nI would like to be able to answer that question for Harold Farrar, even though he is no longer with us, but unfortunately, Harold Farrar’s record with the 465th Bomb Group does not include a list or total number of missions.\n\nHarold Benjamin Farrar died on 3 June 2007 in San Diego, California. He is buried at Greenwood Memorial Park, San Diego, San Diego County, California, in the Garden of Tribute Columbarium.\n\nNotes\n\nWorld War II As I Remember It by Harold B.
