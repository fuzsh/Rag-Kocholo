        "text": "Dennis Lee Cupp, 70, passed away April 18, 2021 at his daughter’s home, surrounded by his family. He was born February 28, 1951 in San Diego, CA, the oldest of four children to Kenneth Weldon and Leona Anna Burhke Cupp.\n\nHe was raised in Ramona, CA where he learned many of his life skills. In high school he was captain of the football team, received FFA awards for farm and AG mechanics, and was chapter farmer all four years. In addition to school, he held down two jobs and spent his mornings before school doing farm chores at his home. He met his high school sweetheart, Alana, their sophomore year and they married in the fall of 1970.\n\nHe opened up his foreign car repair shop near their home in Ramona and volunteered for the Ramona Fire Department where he became engineer. In 1974 with a 3 year old son and a daughter on the way, they moved to Venice, Utah. Dennis worked as a mechanic for several places over the years including the SUFCO mine. In 1979 they moved to Annabella where later Dennis built his mechanic shop at their home and provided vehicle repair services and soon after provided tow services throughout Sevier County. He was a hard worker and gave 110% to all tasks and challenges that came his way.\n\nDennis enjoyed hunting, trapping, black smithing, wood working and marksmanship shooting. He was a true mountain man. He, his wife and two children traveled to attend many mountain man rendezvous and was a member of the local RMM. He was also an active member of the Sevier Valley Amateur Radio Club and talked with many of the ham family daily, he also made several acquaintances throughout the world over his H.F. He loved learning new things and sharing his knowledge with anyone who was interested.\n\nDennis was always putting other’s needs before his own. His love for the Lord shined through in his service to others and time spent studying his bible, which he shared with his wife, children and grandchildren whom he adored.\n\nThe loss of our wonderful husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend has left a huge emptiness in our hearts.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 50 years, Alana; children: Matthew Cupp (Elizabeth Geer), Diana Cupp Jensen; grandchildren: Cyprus (Tasia) Geer, Kayla (Dallin) Poindexter, Tyler Rich, Logan Geer, Trinity Geer, Jayceelyn Geer, Hailey (Jaden) Greenalgh, Jamond Jensen, Rayce Jensen; great-grandson, Drew Greenalgh with one more on the way. Siblings: Janice (George) Mynar, Susan (George) Steiger, Daniel (Kerri) Cupp.\n\nPreceded in death by his mother and father.\n\nCremation services were held at the Magleby Mortuary Crematory. Memorial services will be held Wednesday, June 2, 2021 at 3:00 p.m. in the Magleby Mortuary Chapel, where friends may call after 1:30 p.m. for visitation and slide show.
