        "text": "THIS WAS A 3 PART SERIES PUBLISHED IN THE HERALD BY A MAN WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL CUSTER. IT RAN FROM AUGUST 8, 1899 THROUGH OCTOBER 31, 1899. IT IS A TRUE STORY OF INDIAN WARFARE. WRITTEN FOR AND GENEROUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO THIS PAPER IN TOWANDA, KANSAS BY ONE OF ITS READERS. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE PIECE OF AMERICAN HISTORY THAT WERE WERE SO VERY LUCKY TO STUMBLE UPON DURING OUR RESEARCH THROUGH THE OLD NEWSPAPERS. IT IS OUR PLEASURE TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC. DUE TO THE LENGTH AND UNCLEAR PRINT, WE HAD TO RETYPE THE WORDS ON THIS BLOG TO MAKE IT MORE LEGIBLE FOR YOU TO READ.\n\nAUGUST 8, 1889\n\nPUBLISHERS PREFACE\n\nAmong the many triumphs which has crowned the career of the \"Herald\", we can count the production by one of our subscribers to this paper, of a history of his five adventurous years on the plains fighting \"Injuns\" under General Custer. Written by himself from notes taken by him at the time and from memory, as among the greatest.\n\nWe give the narrative in the author's own language and style, and we feel pretty sure that a more graphic description of this western country and the modes of Indian life and warfare could not be produced; and that the reading will be of the intensest interest to both old and young; and what is better yet, is full of instruction from beginning to end.\n\nThe author, in the first place, evinces a desire for adventure on the plains, which is gratified by doing the rands going west to fight the Indians. He is drilled in the company of his own color, and after practicing sword and riding exercises they march west and meet their first adventure which proves no picnic.\n\nThe barbaric savagery of the \"noble red man\" is portrayed in their treatment of captives; and the renegades (white out-laws) are shown to be often the leading spirits in the Indian outbreaks.\n\nThe many hair breadth and almost miraculous escapes of the writer are told in the style peculiar to himself, and the reader will readily follow him from the exciting scene to another, as he leads him across the unsettles plains of the western Kansas and Colorado.\n\nAnother merit, and no mean one either is the exact truth of these accounts. He gives places, dates and names of parties.He is conversant with the geography of the country over which he has passed; and his comrades, into whose hands this piece of history may fall, will most likely recognize the writer and remember the events he so graphically describes.\n\nit is with the greatest pleasure, and with gratitude to the author that we present our readers with our friend's adventures; and we have every reason to hope that you all will be entertained, delighted, interested and instructed by their perusal.\n\nThe first chapter of this narrative will appear next week.\n\nAugust 15, 1889\n\nAs I sat meditating one bright July morning in 1867 the thought came to me that I would like to be a calvary soldier and I said to my partner: \"Come Jeff let us join the 10th cavalry that is going out west,\" and he said agreed; so off we went to the recruiting office then situated at Leavenworth, Kansas, and we enlisted for five years in Co. H 10th regiment of cavalry. We were drilled at the Fort for six weeks and then we had horses furnished to us, and then we drilled two weeks on horse-back and took up our live of march for the far west. Our first days march was a picnic, the second was a little mixed, and the third was, \"say Sergeant where are we going?\" The Sargeant's reply was, \"don't get discouraged boys you are in for it now,\" and so we were in for it, we made Fort Riley that day and went in to camp and drilled three weeks and then took up our line for march for Fort Harker and drilled there for three weeks and then marched for Denver, Colorado, but met with a band of Indians, they stampeded our horses and pulled the scalps of two white men, got fifteen of our horses. Got up on on a hill and bid us the time of day. Well you see the Captain said, \"boys we will take those rascals in,\" so off we started after them two or three miles over the hills when we came across an old buffalo and fires about 1,000 shots at him at the distance of a mile, we then went back and reported that we killed two of their horses; thus ended our first fight with the Indians. In October 1867 we went to Delver, Col. and stayed there until December. We then came back to Fort Riley and went into winter quarters, where we drilled and laid in guard house part of the time and carried ammunition boxes, knapsacks of sand and were a jolly lot of fellows.\n\nIn the spring of 1866 we went to Fort Wallace and business commenced in earnest. The Indians were more than Custer could manage so he took us to help him out. He sent us after old Saturday, Lone Wolf and Big Tree, of the Cheyenne Tribes, we packed our saddles and started for the Republicao River, Col. We struck the Indian's trail one hundred miles from Wallace. Gen. Custer was one who did not want more than 200 soldiers to whip 3000 Indians. So he started us out one hundred and twenty five strong with twelve teamsters. 137 all told. Well we were hungry for blood and we got it too 'on the reverse' so we were on their trail and we followed to the North Platte River Valley, there we camp up with them 1500 strong, and the jig was up, and we that danced had to pay the fiddler and dearly to a; my God, they whipped us out of our boots. \"Why the squaws could have whipped us.\" They shot down 30 horses and men for us quicker than it takes me to write this. They got off with two wagons of hard-tack which was a serious loss to us, we bought them from 9 o'clock in the morning til 3 o'clock in the evening, we then drew off and crossed the Platt River and pulled for better company, which we found 125 miles from there in the shape of a regiment of white cavalry which had just been whipped by 3,000 Indians of Sitting Bulls band; you bet they made us welcome to their hard tack and sow belly to which we did ample justice. I might say here that the Indians got all our rations, therefore we did not get anything to eat while traveling that 125 miles until we got to the 7th cavalry and you bet we were about starved though we did get a few prairie dogs on the way. But that was little among so many. This ended our second fight of April 1868.\n\nMay 1868 We were hungry for more Indian blood, but we shaped things a little better this time. We struck Beaver Creek, and roused old Captian Jack in the renegade, we done him up in good shape and took his three squaws and fifty others and 75 old men and boys, ponies, saddles, and wigwams, but the warriors got away, but I would rather fight 5 bucks than one squaw. For they will not give up the fight till they are dead. I will relate an incident that occurred after we had captured them one day. The Captain send out a detail to kill a Buffalo for the captive Indians, and sent the squaws along under guard to where the buffalo was and he went along to give orders, (well you know the officers of the regular army put on more style than the President of the United States) well he walked up to where an old squaw was gutting the buffalo and when she got the entrans out she ripped the paunch open and took it in both hands and made a dive for the captain and emptied the contents all over him, the soldiers did not dare to laugh, but we disobeyed orders that time, which cost us something. Well after we got recruited up and our horses and men replaced, that we had lost, we were in good shape again; as I said we came up with the 7th Cavalry a \"a white regiment,\" and we all went to Fort Wallace, about 800 strong white and colored and we began to prepare for the Grand Campaign back over the same ground. The North Platte Valley where we had been so badly defeated General Custer wanted to divide the soldiers, to cover more country, which was a bad mistake; Co. H and Co. I of the 10th Cavalry went north of Wallace to Beaver Creek and Short Knolls and the 7th Cavalry went north east to the Republican River and big tree country. We were strung out in the find shape for fighting Indians 15,000 strong, we went at it like veterans, September 1868 we landed in the famous Platte Valley, but we found the Indians gone; so we hundred up and found them comfortably encamped about 300 miles up the Republican River, in Colorado. Well as I said my two companies were the first to come up with the gents and we opened the ball with the loss of six men killed. We soon found that our party was too small to hold a candle tor them and General Carr ordered a retreat, which order was at once put in motion, we progressed without any interruption until three o'clock in the afternoon. All day we had seen Indians scattered away off on the hills following and watching us until we got where they wanted us, we had a regard about a mile behind the column, and about 3 o'clock in the afternoon the rear guard came in on the run. We got up on the rise and looked back and as far as we could see the world was alive with Indians. The captain chose his ground and we went for it on the run and made the place we wanted and made corral by placing the wagons in a circle with the tongues under each other and put the horses inside of the circle. The wagons were partly loaded with forage in the sacks, we tumbled them out and took our spades and there sand up against them and entrenched ourselves in behind them, by the time we had done this, and ti was done before I could tell it, the Indians had come up and the medicine man had made his first circle and the captain said boys do not lei him go round three times or we are got up. We began to shoot at this, but he made the second round and had got half way round the third time, we brought him down; let me say here that it is the custom of the Indians to send the medicine man around and if he can succeed in circling you three times no power on earth will save you then, as they think the medicine man has drawn the charm, as I said we shot him before he had completed the third round and broke the charm. Then we made a sally to get the medicine man and that brought on a hand to hand encounter which lasted 30 minutes and caused a good many poor fellows to bite the dust on our side as well as theirs. But we succeeded in driving them back and getting their medicine man, but he was not quite dead and one of our boys went running to him when he made about two moves and pinned his legs together with an arrow, but before he could shoot his bow again, one of the boys shot him. Well the Indians withdrew and left us: so we hurried our dead and taking our wooded with us we pulled out for a better situation, and thus ended one of the darkest day Is ever saw, for we were out numbered five to one; then a runner came to us from Teachers Island which was 75 miles above us; Let me relate here the after we left Fort Wallace there was not any cavalry left at the Fort and the Indians got so bold that the commander took steps to raise a small calvary force; Now there was t the Fort at that time 65 white men who in the employ of the Government and one them one that had been in the war of the rebellion, he had been a Lieutenant by the name of Beecher, well he told the Commander that he could pick out fifty men that would be as good as any cavalry company in the Army and could whip all the Indians that he could show him. Well the Post Commander commissioned him and told him to pick out his men, and the Lieutenant Beecher picked out fifty men and equipped them with horses and arms and pack mules they drew new carbines of the Spencer seven shot and got 5,000 rounds of ammunition, five pack mules well loaded and they started due north and struck an Indian trail of 900 strong and they followed it fifteen miles up the river fire miles below where the 7th cavalry had crossed one week before and the Indians had been watching them from the Tim they left the Fort and as they crossed the river they came down on them. In the middle of the river was an Island about fifty yards square and it was on that island that Beecher and his men made a stand. The first day they chose a man and dispatched him after us, and it took him five days to find us and we were seven more days before we could get to them: now I will just give you a description of the battle field as we found it, can you imagine a plot of ground fifty yards square with fifty dead men, horses and mules all laying in the sun. Some of them had been dead 10 or 12 days, and they were stolen beyond all human shape. The Indians had not left one man, horse or mule alive, all had been massacred: the man they had send to us was the only one left: it was the safest sight I ever saw, the man that came to us, when he got back and saw his comrades that he had left so gallant a few days before, preparing for the fight the next day, he cried out Oh! my friends! and wept like a child. Well they died like hers and the way they fought would have done honor to veterans. After we had buried the dead and rested one day at the island, we started after the Indians and followered their trail and we counted 400 fresh made Indian graves on the route besides 175 dead which we buried on the island. Let me state here that the Indians got all their pack mules first thing and so they had no rations and were nearly starved, they had cut pieces out of the dead horses and laid them in the sun to dry and they lived on that until they were all killed. Reader you may want to know why the Indians did not come and take all the plunder that Beecher had? Well they had suffered so severely that they were all dead and they thought it best to keep out of the way of those deadly Spencer carbines that they poor fellows used so effectively. The island is known as Beechers Island to this day.\n\nAugust 22, 1889\n\nI will give you a slight description of Beecher and his men; as I told you Beecher was a Lieutenant in the Army during the Civil War and his men were employed by the Government, they consisted of blacksmiths, carpenters, stone masons and mule drivers. Lieutenant Beecher was a clerk in the commissary. They had never been drilled and had no discipline, they were not even good riders and had no idea of fighting on horseback nevertheless they did well; as it appears the Indians had been watching them, and as soon as they got them on the island they knew they were not soldiers, and they piled right into them, the men jumped off their horses and went to fighting and the Indians crowded right down and shot all their horses; they said afterwards that knew that the white men would never get away. About 300 yards below the island there was a natural fort of deep hollows, where if Lieutenant B had kept his presence of mind and led his men to them, he could have whipped them if they had attacked h I'm, or, he could have held his own until night and then slipped out. Let me say here that if they had been drilled as company of cavalry they would have whipped those Indians out of their boots. In the first place, if he had been compelled to give battle on that ground, and to such superior numbers, he would have given the command to prepare to dismount and fight on foot that would have thrown the horses in a compact circle with no, 4 holding them they then never could run, for one horse holds the others and it is impossible to stampede them and the men would have formed a circle around the horses and that would have been a line of battle two men deep all around the horses and the Spencers being long range guns and the Indians really close on such line. But we will pass and leave Lieutenant B. and his brave boys to rest. Thus ends our third campaign, June 1868.\n\nWe now left the main Republican River and stared for the north fork of the Republican which was called afterwards, Custers Creek. We traveled west 150 miles and found five companies of the 7th and 8th cavalry which had left Wallace the same time we did, the Indians had eluded them to try us, to see what kind of timber we were made of, they knew what the 7th and 8th were, and after the Beecher massacre and the little lesson we gave them, they thought the whites and black were small potatoes and they did not care for us and them to be in the same hill. Well we joined the 7th and 8th and camped on Custer Creek and had 2 weeks drill which was rather interesting, one regiment in rivalry with another. Well now for a buffalo chase and some beef steak, Lieutenant L, myself and 9 others composed the hunting party, after breakfast Lieutenant L. ordered myself and 9 others to saddle our horse and 'they being the fasted company' and provide ourselves with one hundred rounds of cartridges a piece that he wanted us to go with him after some buffalo that he had seen through his spy glass 5 miles to the right of camp, horses were saddled and riders were up and off, we went like the wind for about 4 miles from camp. The brutes scented us and started out straight for us about 1,000 in the herd. Let me explain here, the supposed reason why they started towards us, \"for instance if a herd of buffalo are to the north of you and strong wind from the south, you go toward them, they get the scent of you and they will run toward you trying to get past the scent and the closer they get the faster they will run. This was the position were were in that caused them to run toward us, I tell this for the benefit of some that would suppose the buffalo would run from us in place of toward us, but after they get past and out of scent, they will of't times stop within fifty yards of the hunter, if he is well concealed: so Lieutenant L. said now hold your horses well in the hand and when they get within 300 yards, let them have it as fast as you can. Lieu't L. picked out a large old fellow and made for him, as for myself I began to look a little out for we were in danger of being run down and trampled to death; Lieu't L., now began to take in this fact, so he said boys take care of yourselves. We expected they would scatter when we fired into them, but it didn't happen so quick as we expected, so Lieu't L. said boys follow me. Obeyed orders and soon found that we were on a charge right in front of the buffalo's 1,000 strong, and there was no stopping either; we shot back at them to get them scattered, but with no success, we could not ride to the right or left as they were pressing us so hard: well they dove us three or four miles and we got them separated, but we now ten miles from camp, a small party in an Indian country; remember the Indians were watching us since we had got together and they were watching this hunting party. Lieu't L had orders not to go farther than five miles from camp and here we were ten: after looking for a while through his glass he said men we are in a bad fix, if we get back to camp alive we are hero's; now I want you men to be calm and dent get excited, there is a party of Indians about twenty-five of them between us and camp and we have got to fight to death, we must not be taken or they will burn us at the stake. Our horse had rested a little so we mounted and started for camp, we had travelled two miles when Lieu't L. said, \"boys, they are on us.\" Then putting away his glass he said, \"now for that buffalo wallow,\" which was 300 yards away, we made it in good shape bu by the time we got to it 75 of the powder faces young Bucks were at our heels. Well we dismounted and got down in the hollow and our racket commenced in earnest. Let me give you a description of a buffalo wallow. It is a place on the level prairie where the buffalo have met and fought and wallowed and by fighting, pawing and wallowing, some of those places get to be 5 or 6 feed deep and 75 or 100 yards square. I have seen them cover three acres, but this was a small one, but deep, and had steep banks to it except at one place where they had don in or out, this was our position. Well those young bucks stuck close to us for about 30 minutes, but our presence offend and the faithful Spencer carbines soon taught them that buffalo soldiers were, - as they afterwards said, - made of powder. Well they killed private C. poor boy and wounded B. and D. and shot one of our horses; our fire was so well directed that they drew off, but we knew that they would soon return, so we took our lariat ropes and threw the other horses down to conceal them below the banks of the wallow, which worked like a charm, this done we prepared to fight indeed.\n\nAbout one o'clock they began to put in an appearance, but seemed disconcerted at not seeing our horses and being very superstitious they stopped at about 600 yards from us and held a council, there were about 100 warriors; Lieutenant L. who was a dead shot saluted them with his Spencer rifle. Down went one of their horses, at the same time the rest of us that were able to saluted them in the life manner, they thought then that would not do, so they came straight for us whopping and yelling, as if that would do any good. So we let them get within 100 yards of us and then weave them a broadside which took deadly effect, still on they came, you bet we piled them in good style. The two boys that were hurt, fought like heroes in spike of their wounds. I must here state that we had taken our iron picket pins and dug hollows in the side of the bank where we could conceal ourselves and when they came close to try to see us, we would get out of sight. Then they would skip back out of sight, and that would draw us out to watch their movements and get a shot at them which we did and caused and Indian to bite the dust every time. Generally an dIndian will not fight an enemy that is hid from view, but our party was so small and theirs so large, and we had a white Lieutenant in command that they wanted so bad to burn, this is why they struck so close to us. Out of 1100 cartridges that we left camp with, we had 300 left. Fate had begun to settle down upon us. The Indians had increased to 200 and they had began to get bold, they were just fixing to make a rush and come over right into our fort, when all at once we heard the hum of a shower of bullets pass over our fort and then all at once we say the Indians scattering in eery direction: Lieutenant L. said those shots were from long range funds, and we raised up to look, and soon caught sight of our old Com. H of the 10 cavalry bringing the Indians right toward us. They had slipped upon them and surprised them and run them over us, we did our part as they passed us.\n\nIt will be remembered that when we left camp that were were to be back by noon and as we didn't to turn up, General Custer know that something was afloat and he had stared partied out in every direction to look for us. Out company happened to sight the Indians by the aid of the spy glass; they could see something's up and thought the Indians were having a war dance over our bodies, but Lieutenant L. had no such idea. Neither did his men, but if the company had been one hour later it would have been dark night with us. Well Captain C. was very mad when he came up to where were were and saw no dead horse and rider, but when he heard the facts in the case he cooled down and thought we had done well. we laid our comrade to rest and then took our Cours to camp, thanking heaven for our deliverance from the stake. Well the 4 or 5 buffalos that we had crippled, the company had found on their way to find us, and we now took them in on our way to camp, we had steak any how, tough it cost us dearly. The Indians had gone all except 5 and 3 dead horses which they compelled to leave in our possession.\n\nWell camp was reached and things quieted down once more. Then marching orders came and we prepared to go. We did not know where to, but when we had gone three days march we got to the foot of Thunderhead Mountain, 200 miles south of Denver, Col. And here we were separated Co's, H. and I. went together, and three white Co's went in one batch and two Co's in another. We were in fine shape for a little racket which we got to our hearts content. My Co's H. and I. went straight for the Colorado River and then traveled for Salt Lake City but before we got there we turned south and went to the famous Powder Mountain and Bid Horn River, which six years after proved to be Busters fatal and last battle ground. When we got to the Powder River or mountain we made ourselves acquainted with Captain Jack and his band of Modocs and Utes where are a brace set of chaps. Well then we saw the boys and in such numbers, we send out our scouts to find where Generals Pinro and Custer were , in order to keep up communication. But the Indians got our scouts and took their scalps and left us without any knowledge of where Gen. Custer was. We were 275 strong and with an enemy 1700 strong, we were in a bad fix. It will be remembered that one third of those Indians were renegade white men and they were most of them armed with Winchester rifles and had plenty of ammunition. We encamped at the foot of Powder Mountain about one hundred yards form the river and chose our battle ground. Taking care to keep out of range of the lava beds, the identical place to which General Custer allowed himself to be enticed afterwards when he and his whole party were so brutally massacred.\n\nWell the battle opened about sun rise: this was in October 1868. They came out and saluted us with their Winchesters at about 100 yards and halloo'd, \"Oh! you d---d niggers, we will roast your black hides over the fire before night!\". We answered back, \"Come on you Texas S. of B's!\" And they did come on to within 30 yards of our wagons, but we piled them up in such a way that 75 of them were not able to take part in the roasting us. They now went back about a mile and on eat hill stopped and held a council, and with the aid of the spy glass we could see them mustering their tomahawks and lances. Then we knew that we were in for a hand to hand encounter, so we piled our swords out of the wagon and reloaded our revolvers and preparer to see them when they came back. About noon we saw several bands of Indians joining them. Things began to look dark at that time. Where were our scouts? At that time we were in hopes that they had got to Custer and Pinro but we afterwards found that they never got there. I will here state that when these Indians first saluted us they shook some-thing at us but we had no idea that is was the scalps of our good scouts, but it was. And we began to realize that we could have to fight it alone. When we spared into three parties it was arranged that Custer and Pinto took three companies and to travel north, my two companies went north west and the other two Co's went south. Each band had two scouts and the way the scouts had to keep each army informed as to the other was by meeting on the route and each scout would carry the news to his command that he had seen scouts of such company, and they would be at Powder Mountain on such a day. This will show you what we had lost in losing our scouts. We were lost from the rest of the army and they had no means of knowing that we were being pressed by the renegades and Indians. The whole army was to have met at Powder Mountain in 25 days if nothing happened, but as I said, things were looking dark for us. Well at 2 o'clock they got ready and so were we. They separated and came for us in three bands at once. We prepared to receive them, we were buried in the ground and held our fire until they got within 40 yards of us and then we gave it to them. We covered the ground with them, but only made them more blood-thirsty. They came up close enough tot use the tomahawk and lance. We emptied our Spencers and then took our revolvers to them. We grappled with them but did not have to use our sabres. By the time our revolvers were empty the battle was won. I don't relive there was a more sever battle fought intuit space of time the that was. They lost 375 killed and wounded, we lost 13 killed and 26 wounded, also 51 horses and 30 mules. The Indians lost 200 horses, but there was a large number killed that we didn't to get. They went away, thinking that they had a costly roast, out of the number killed, 96 were white men renegades of the rebel army from Texas and bad ones at that.\n\nAugust 29, 1889\n\nNow let us see what Generals Custer, and Piro, have been doing: They went north and instead of meeting us at the time and place allotted, Old Sitting Bull and 1200 of his braves yanked on to him 55 miles from where he left us and gave\n\nhim plenty of employment, 'They kept him there 28 days, and we were left with the Mr. Modoos to make their acquaintance, which we did in pretty good shape.\n\nCuster joined us at last, and we were glad to see him, but sorry to say he was 25 men short. Now about Captain Cloud and his two companies that went south, they met with 600 Crowfeet Indians who stampeded their horses and that left them afoot for the Indians caught most of their horses and their progress was slow, however they came in all right. But some what sorefooted and a little ashamed. So we were all together again and Custer takes command of all the troops and now we prepared to fight five tribes which had consolidated to wind us up or burn us at the stake. Sitting Bull, Captain Jack, Storm cloud, Rain-in the-face, and Powder-face, were the Chiefs of the tribes that we now had to deal with. After we had whipped the Modoes and the renegades they went away and got all these tribes to help to take us, but by the time they could get them all together all the soldiers had got together again. They prepared to try us anyhow as their numbers were so strong they would not give it up. But if those renegade had not been at the head of it, the Indians would not have united their forces to fight as they did. For two of those tribes were at war with each other at the time and fought it out 2 weeks after their battle with us, that we will now record.\n\nAbout the last of December we received word through scouts that a mixed army of Indians and renegades were preparing to come down and take us and roast us before the cold weather set in. For we were too near their winter quarters.\n\nWell we fixed up for them, but before they got ready, we had a cold storm, and all had like to have been frozen to death. So they did not come; Indians do not fight in right cold weather if they can help it. Well it kept getting colder and so we had to make for winter quarters. Gen. Custer thought it best to go over in the valley and bid the gents goodbye before we started for Fort Wallace. Accordingly, one cold day we were put in motion and travelled 50 miles that day and went in-to camp at 10 o'clock that night. We were about frozen, we got supper and was ordered not to put up tents, which we thought strange. I believe some of the boys did curse Custer behind his back about the tent. At 12 o'clock the bugle sounded, boots and saddles! I don't believe I ever came so near freezing to death as I did that night, but we tumbled out and was on the road in 30 minutes. We went about 25 miles and dismounted with orders not to whisper, but to run around and keep warm. Which we had to do to keep ourselves from freezing to death. We remained quietly here until break of day then we looked down in the valley and it ever my heart sank within me it did at that moment. We were about 500 yards from the Indian village and it extended for five miles up and down the valley, and all the poor wretches sound asleep and thought us 75 miles away.\n\nWe will now leave the soldiers and go back to show whether we had provocation for the slaughter that is now to take place or not. You know I said that two companies were sent south and they got their horses stampeded by the Indians? And they had to come all the way on foot. Well their business was to meet a wagon train of supplies for us, that was sent from Fort Wallace to reach Powder Mountain. Well after our party had whipped the Indians they went away and met the train before the soldiers did and whipped the infantry that was escorting it and captured the whole thing 75 strong. And tied the men to the wagon wheel and cut out their tongues and burned them alive, then carried off all the mules, sugar, coffee and hard bread, 5,000obs of forage, 800 suits clothing, they destroyed $100,000 worth of property beside burning 75 men, now judge whether we had provocation or not for the slaughter that we to take place in a few moments.\n\nNow we will go back to the soldiers on the hill; at peep of day we were looking down on the Indian village, well now we prepare for bloody work. We were about 758 strong; so we mount for the fray Custer leads with three companies, Pinro with two Co', and Car with two Co's. We glided silently down the hill until we got within two hundred yards of them we then saluted the village with 800 rounds from our Spencers, then with revolver in hand we charged right in to the camp yelling like ten thousand demons. Then the awful carnage commenced squaws, children boys and girls, young and old running in every direction, we shot them down like birds. They came out naked with their tomahawks and fought bravely, but to no avail we charged one charge after another for six hours. I had thought we had been fighting before, but we were now putting on the cap sheaf little babies that seemed to have been born that night were trampled to death under the feet of our horses. My heart sank with pitty,and I thought -O! cruel Custer hold thy mighty band, those little babes know not why thou art in this land. Little boys and girls came out naked with their bow and tomahawksand fought like little tigers. By this time the warriors began to take in the situation and began to give us an introduction to their Winchesters and old smooth bores. Which turned the tide for a while and caused some of the soldiers to bite the dust, but it was so cold that they could not compete with us in their naked condition and began to try to get away. We surrounded that part of the village occupied by the renegades who were going to roast our black hides and we all shouted: \"Hey! you are playing the devil roasting our black hides. Why are you laying up here snoozing at this time of day? Trot out here and take your medicine'. All the time we were talking, we were pouring deadly vollies of leaden bail into their tents and by that time they had taken in the situation we had them foul. But I want you to know that they fought desperate, for they knew that no quarters are shown to renégaden. We cut, and we cut, and slashed until I suppose General Custer got tired of the bloody work, and we drew off on to the hill from whence we came and reckoned up our losses, which were very light, for the reason that it was so cold that the Indians could not fight and they had all their women and children in their way. Of the renegades, we killed all we could find in the camp.\n\nMuch has been said about Rain-in-the-face, I will give a description of him as I saw him: I think he was a half breed, large, portly, intelligent, and brave as a lion. He wore a hideous smile on his face and it was said that he wore the scalps of 300 white men about his war dress, which I believe was so. He was the worst Chief that we had to contend with. He and his family suffered severely in the above fight. He lost three sons and eight other children. Also five of his squaws' and for this loss he swore to cut Custer's heart out and drink his blood. Which it is said that he afterwards did. We went back to the village and burnt a few wigwams, which cost me a little more than had been bargained for. I5 miles up the valley was another Indian village that we did not know of, but they had been notified and had prepared a war party and was on us before we knew it. We turned our attention to them and shook them off. By this time, the weather had moderated a little which favored the Indians greatly, and you bet they took advantage of the opportunity. Now the tide had began to turn and we had to a assume the defensive and look out for ground to fight on. We found this too hot and had to get away. We had lost heavily by this time and a great many horses had been killed. Rain-in-the-face had taken command of all the warriors, and for three days we had to fight if ever men did, and if the weather had turned warm there would not have been one of us left to tell where the other one. But we got out of that scrape and shaped things up a little and pulled tor Fort Wallace 400 miles distance on half rations. Before we had got 100 miles, the weather turned warm like Spring and the Indian had fixed up, organized and was on to us 8 to 1 there was nothing for it but fight or burn, and we fought on the run when we could and when we had to stop we gave them the best we could. We had to travel after night to save our scalps. You see General Custer made a mistake by going over it the valley to bid them good-bye. For it cost us dearly in the end; we just got away and back to Fort Wallace with 60% men out of 768. Well no were at Fort Wallace now. Looking back over our journey and telling how each other acted: we were in good warm quarters and plenty to eat and plenty of clothes, drawing new horses, drilling, boxing and dancing. We were having a good time. Captain Onol came down to the quarters to join in the fun. We say to him,\"Say B.. heard nothing about marching again?\" He said \"I don't know, heard Captain say a'while\n\nago that we would freeze to death. bin weather, my God!\" Then he said;\n\n\"well I think that we will bare to go in two or three days.\" You may guess, how our feathers drooped. We had been in only one week, the bugle had sounded for dinner call and we were all seated when the Great sargent came to dining room door and shouted, \"After dinner I want every man to form in line, to draw over shoes, gloves, cape of fur, doable suits of under clothing. We are under marching orders, hurry up, est and get out.\" Dinner eaten, we formed in line the Captain then made a speech something like the following, \"Now men we have been out all through the cold weather and have suffered a great deal. We are going to draw clothing and I want every man to have plenty of clothes for we are to start in the morning for a 60 day campaign up in the Yellowstone mountains. The Indians surprised and massacred two companies of the 8th cavalry and are pressing the corps hard up. These and we will join them for the winter.\"\n\nWe have now come to January 1869 when we started on the Yellowstone\n\ncampaign. We made good time until we got to where the massacre had taken place and joined the troops operating in that district and made it warm for Mr. Redmun. While he made it hot for us. We stayed with them through January and marched for Fort Wallace to rest a month, which we needed very much. At Fort Wallace we scouted until July and then began to prepare for more work with our red brother. Well this is two years of my experience as a Soldier on the plains, if the printer accepts I will give the other three years.\n\nSeptember 5, 1899\n\n​PART 2ND\n\nWe had by this time got pretty well rested, both mend and horse, and the paymaster came along and paid the boys which gladened our hearts. We had a good time which terminated in a bad job. There were two or three white Cos of infantry stationed at Fort Wallace. An infantry and cavalry cannot live in peace together (that is in the regular army) and they got too much whiskey in and raised a mutiny between the white and colored soldiers, which caused six white and three colored men to bite the dust and 50 to be put in the guard-house and they threw cloud over our character as soldiers, and caused some on both sides to go to the pen; for five years. This was H. and I. cos. of 10 cavalry, and A. and K. and M. was at Fort Zero, and 3 cos. of white cavalry were at the same place. And the paymaster went here and paid the men off, and they all got too much whiskey and mutinied; and had a pitched battle. I. co. got their stable burnt with 181 horses in it. There were twenty men killed and several wounded. (and a lot more prison birds! Well those fellows were bad!) but if it had not been for whiskey this would never have been.They lost $15,000, in a few minutes.\n\nWell we will start for the state plains again, and see what our red brothers are doing. About the 30th of July we left Fort Wallace for the last time. We bid goodbye to our old stamp ground and go to White Mountain. Here we meet up with the great Chief Doghead, \"and bulldog he was \"we hung in with him and 1200 of his dog warriors, and had a little racket about sundown, and gave them a flogging which however only lasted them one night, the next morning they were on to us by peep of day and we had it hot, nearly all day when about four o'clock they were reinforced by two bali tribes of Modes and Utes which turned the tide against us. We traveled all night and tried to give them the slip. We travelled 55 miles that night, but by morning they were on us in good style and we began to think we would all be \"massacred; but it happened that we had chosen a good battle ground, and had a small piece of artillery with us, and that was all that saved us. They stuck to us until we got breast-works up, then they drew off out of range of our guns and went into amp, saying they were going to starve us out for water but Lieutenant L. was a good engineer and he picked out his old Buffalo party and slipped out after night and went within 300 yards of their camp and gave them about fifteen grape and canister which taught them a lesson that they will remember to this day if any of them were alive. The next morning we got ourselves in fighting trim, but they failed to show up, so we thought we would rattle them out and so we started after them and came up with them but they did not want any fight (because they said we had a smoke wagon that would kill all Indians at one shot) and so they got away. But we thought they were up to some of their tricks, so we kept a strict watch on the chaps, and in about a week they tried some more of their smart tricks on us.\n\nWe had gone into camp at Yellowstone Mountain to rest horses and men and drill a while there. There was a part of the boys out fishing and swimming and the first thing they knew about fifty Utes was on them and killed three of the boys. But before they could do any more harm we had our rifles in hand and gave them a round, we dropped four of them on the spot and got four horses, by that time the soldiers at camp were in arm and mounted and ready for the chase, which was some fun, but they got away. We now avowed vengence, and began to fix up to take them at night. Their main camp was 90 miles away, over in Utah, so we waited about two weeks and then we started for their village, we made the 90 miles in two days and one night, we travelled at night and the last day in\n\n​ -Cutting and shouting like terrors, and tore their camp up and routed all the Indians; but we had to get away before daylight. We went all night and camped 45 miles from their camp and entrenched, and I then awaited their arrival; which was not very long, for they came ten to one. But we had by this time met with some of the 6th cavalry and we together made a pretty good army, and we were in good fighting trim, but they attacked us any way, and we fought two days, and had a hot time. We lost several men and horses but we routed them at last and then had to go on the run, for they were receiving bands of warriors every day and had by this ttme 1100 warriors and we were only 400 strong, and so we went into the mountains and fixed up for a general fight. The Indians had an object in view. It will be remembered that when we went back to Fort Wallace from the Yellow Stone massacre, General Custer went over the mountains into Utah and was operating there. And the object that the Indians had was to keep us from joining him. All the time they were fighting us they were concentrating over on the other side of the mountain in order to over-power and massacre him and all his soldiers. As soon as we got into the mountains the Indians all left us, and went to join the main band that was gathering around Custer, but as we did not catch on to their racket at first we made ourselves content, but kept a strict watch for them, for we knew their tricks too well. All went well with us, but Custers position was dangerous for he had only seven Co's, and he had seven tribes of Indians to compete with beside a band of renegades. Well we did not know this, neither did Custer, so we were waiting for orders from Custer to know what to do next.\n\nWell now for a buffalo hunt for we were sadly in want of meat, and the buffalo were passing our camp every day in great herds. We were afraid to venture out after them, but now the temptation was too strong and the need so great, that at last Lieu't. L. persuaded the Captain that he could take his old hunting party and take one in within half a mile of camp. So the captain consented that he should try his hand, so he myself and four others to saddle horses and go with him. So we mounted and off in quick time. Lieu't LB. horse was very high spirited and when excited was unmanageable; we came up with the buffalo one half mile from camp. Lieu't I. made for one old fellow and gave him a shot six inches from a vital spot which dropped him. But quick as thought he got up and was off. Lieu't I, was so anxious that he should not get too far from camp. He was charging on him and I was fifty yards behind him to see it well. All at once I saw his horse throw up his head then I knew that he had broken his curb and was running away. He made a straight line for the brute. I urged my steed too within fifty feet of the horse, for I knew the brute would turn on his horse and as quick as thought, the buffalo did turn and caught the horse just behind the fore shoulder. The horse was going with such speed that the buffalo ripped\n\nhim from one end to the other and strung his entrails for 50 yards. The horse ran\n\n75 yards before he fell dead; the fall knocked Lien't L. senseless. After the buffalo hooked the horse he kept straight after him and was fixing to make a charge at Lieu't L., who was by this time trying to get up, but was right in front of the buffalo as I was the nearest to him. I took it all in at a glance and made a shot at the brute and found the vital spot. He dropped within 20 feet of Lieu't L. One minute later his doom would have been sealed. I had in previous buffalo hunts learned the vital spot. I have often shot down six or seven in their tracks and only given each but one shot. I said: \"Lieutenant, are you hurt?\" He said he was \"not much hurt, but you have saved my life. You are a faithful soldier and shall be rewarded.\" He afterward presented me with a badge of honor which was of silver and about the size of a silver quarter,-a star and half-moon. Well we got our meat and started for camp, which we reached without further mishaps and had our tenderloin stake for dinner and supper.\n\nWe stayed in that camp for one week, and we began to think that all was not right, as the Indians were no where to be seen. So we struck camp and started for the line of Utah which was 125 miles from general Custer. We began to see that something was wrong, so without further waiting for orders, the captain started for Custor's camp which was situated at the Little Big Horn. We traveled day and night til within forty miles of his camp. There we met a band of renegades who ordered us to go no farther, but we got them to understand that they were not running that part of the army. They then yoked onto us, we shook them off and undertook to go ahead, but we soon found they meant what they said, for they came out as in double force. They were determined that we shouldn't join Custer at all hazzards. They said that they could take care of him and his band without our help. But we knew they would not do it to suit us, so we wanted a hand in it. We had to go into camp and fix for fighting in earnest. We had been in camp two days, one of Custer's scouts came to us with orders for us to get to him that night, if we had to ride every horse to death. Then we realized what the Indians had been up to all the time.\n\nWe had to ride sixty miles to get to Custer, forty miles away. And we had a bad job on our hands but had to make the trial, so we pulled ont by 8 o'clock that night and by daybreak we were fifty miles from where we started and about fourteen from Custer; and we could get no closer for five days.\n\nThe Indians had us just where they wanted us and they made good use of us.\n\nWe fought five days as hard as men ever did, considering the number engaged. We lost heavily, but the Indians did not lose so much as we did. You see the only way that we could travel at all to join Custer was to put out sharp-shooters ahead, and these would keep the Indians at bay till we could get past and take another stand, and so we worked that way till we got half a mile of Custer, and could see his awefull condition. He was hemmed in on all sides and fighting for\n\ndear life.\n\nAs soon as the Indians saw that their renegades could not keep us from joining Custer, they sent a lot more. Hailed us within eighty rods of his position and there we were between two bands of Indians. When we came around the\n\nmountain, we completely surprised the Indians. For they they thought the rene-\n\ngades were giving us all we wanted. When we got around and came in sight we were coming between two large villages, and had to come that way since we had got in, and we were now in front of Custer's position instead of behind him as we wanted to. We were in a position to receive all Custer's fire, and he in danger of ours, which could not be helped. For we had to do all the shooting we could even if we shot some of our own men. If we had known Custer's position we could have gone in behind and joined him in good shape. But as it was now, we were exposed to all the Indian forces which Custer was contending with. We had only 390 men left after our losses, and you can see that we had to join Custer at all hazzards and quick too.\n\nWe were now within 100 yards of each other and fighting for dear life. Let me here give you a description of our position. The valley was surrounded by huge mountains, and about two miles square and was badly broken by lava beds and ravines. The valley extended east and west; half way from the west end of the valley were two large valleys, one south of the other eighty rods, and Custer was at the east pass. We had to get around to the west side and pass between the two villages to join our forces. We could not get to them any other way, for they were hemmed in on all sides by mountains and we would have had to travel over a hundred mile to get to them any other way. Then between the villages, all that we could do was to cut our way through; and we went at it like heroes. All that Custer could do, was to sit and look at us poor fellows shot down.\n\nWell, he could not help us any, for he would only have killed more of us than the Indians did, had he attempted it. He was entrenched and did not dare to show his head above ground, for the Indians were hovering around him like bees; and the balls from our rifles bid him lie still and bide his time.\n\nOur first move was to unlimber our brass piece, (Lion Gun, we called it.) and sweep their villages one by one, which did not harm the Indians badly for they were all out in the ravines and lava beds scattering death in our suffering ranks, Now comes the deadly rush to pass the village. The Indians raise up all around us as it by magic. We are enveloped in a cloud of smoke. On we go fighting for life; we pass the villages and get beyond but ten out of thirty wagons are left behind, were instantly surrounded by the Indians and in a few minutes were in flames. And the Indians were getting rich booty till we turned loose on them with our General Lion gun, which swept down mule and horses and even killed of some of our wounded who had got left and had fallen into the hands of the Indians; but were thereby saved from the powerful tortures always inflicted on captives by these Indians.\n\nWell, we were altogether at last, but at a fearful loss. We began to make preparation to save our worded. We said we were all going back to the burning wagons to save our wounded if we all died in the act. So four hundred of us started on foot on a dead run for the bloody spot, but when we got there, the men were all scalped and their tongues cut out and some of the party disected joint by joint. Some of them had life in them and they cried to us to shoot them. Some of them had been thrown in the fire of the wagons and were scorched all over. It was dreadful. But we could not help them.\n\nBefore now it will be noticed that it was bad management on the part of the head officers in separating the soldiers into such small parties. But we will pass back to Custer's entranced position.\n\nSeptember 12, 1889\n\nAs I said, we got to him at a fearful loss; we found him in a good place of defense and old Rain-in-the-face might peg away at him till dooms-day for all the good it would do him. We mustered in all about 900 men fit for duty, when if all things had been properly managed we would have been 1100 men besides 75 wagon driver and 30 scouts. All we had to do was to prepare to fight the great chiefs, Dog-chief, Black-bear, Captain Jack and others. They were all on to us and we had all our work before us. You may want to know why we made such efforts to get to Custer. The reason was this, after we had got round the mountain we were exposed to overpowering forces of Indians, and we could not get a position for defense until we got to him. The Indians did all they could to keep us from joining him as he was well entrenched and they could not do much with him, they made as suffer. You may also wonder why the soldiers from his command did not rally out and help us through the villages. They had been fighting the Indians for about 20 days and the Indians whipped them out of their boots, and drove them into the ground and had stationed sharpshooters all around in such a way that they could kill every man that put bis head above ground, and as we had to go straight toward his fort, we were shooting that way as the main line of battle was between us and them. So they could not render us any service until the Indians had been driven from between us and our fire drawn from their direction. All the good they could do us was after the deadly rush and we were all in, then they could tell as what they would have done if there had not been danger of shooting us.\n\nA tent deal has been said about Gen Custer's fighting Indians, but he had one fault. He was too brave and did not rightly estimate the power of the Indians. He would venture into the greatest danger with as few men as any General in the U.S. army, and that eventually caused his death. He was good to his men, but woe to the soldier that did not come up to the military point after the third warning. I never saw a man fail that was acquainted with him. After we had been in camp three days and fighting like fury, we had lost heavily in men, horse, mules and wagons. We saw that we would have to change our position and began to prepare for a little move which cost us mere in the way of horses and a few men. So General Custer had a pretty good army be concluded to give them some more fight and at them we went, but they had the advantage of us for they were in the Lava beds and we could not get them out, and so we wrestled about for four or five days and gave up at present and waited awhile to see what the Indians would do next. Well, some of them pulled out and went. They hooked on to some cavalry from Fort Union and got their jackets tanned badly. Then came back to see what we were doing, they found us always ready and awaiting. Well this campaigning did not suit the authorities of the Army, so we were to be broken up, and assigned other fields for operation. All the colored soldiers were called away from that district to perform on the line of New Mexico, Colorado and Kansas.\n\nThese orders came in September 1869 And so we break of all connection with our white brothers and go to new fields of operations. Well I then saw what I had never seen before; that was my whole regiment together. 12 companies of black cavalry show up pretty nice. I once heard General Sherman say \"ebonies made the finest soldiers; as they were more submissive than the whites, and would take drilling better.\" I will say here that the whites could beat us at stealing. I remember that on one cold night in 1848, we all camped together the white soldiers stole all of our blankets and used them that night and the next morning returned them and thanked us for them, we thought that was cheeky stealing, but aside of a little cursing they got off with it for that time. They told us we had no need of getting up so high about it, but to be thankful that we got them back and some graybacks to boot, so it passed off. But we waited until an opportunity occurred to get it back on to them which took about a week. Then one night, four of our boys made a raid on their cook wagon and got 40 pounds of sugar from them which left them mighty short for breakfast. Then they wrote on the wagon \"When you beat our times you drive the d-1 out of h-I.\" And so they found it before they had done with that joke. Well we will pass on to our new field of operation, where we had to make the acquaintances of a new kind of Indians, such as the Arapahoes, Apaches, Southern Cheyennes, Kechies, Tonkaways and others whose names I have forgotten. We all settled down in our new places and waited to see what would turn up. We had two or three weeks drill, and a good time in general. There was one regiment going from Texas to take our place with Custer up in Utah, the sixth cavalry. They arrived at our station on their way, and stopped six or seven days to get repairs. As we were drilling and playing baseball, they took a hand in the drill and we made them ashamed of themselves. We beat them at drilling and then we played base ball with them and beat them out of their boots and told them to go up to Utah and take lessons of the Utes, Modocs and the renegades. They took up their march, and we were left at Fort Kearney. We had began to got tired of such a peacefull life and wanted to fight. Our whole regiment was together at this time, but before long three companies was ordered away, and four more companies were under marching orders. Inside of four weeks all the soldiers were gone\n\nTime came and we were off. We went and took a peep at Santa-Fe, New Mexico, and come back. We were fixing to have a good time when the news came that the Modocs had come onto the 6th cavalry and thrashed the life out of them before they got to Fort Custer. We had began to anticipate a trip back to Utah (whicb would have gladened our hearts) for things were too peacefull where we were. So we waited four or five days to see what would turn up. At the end of four days, the 6th cavalry scout came in and said the Modocs and Utes had surprised the 6th cavalry and got about all their horses. So the jig was up and we now pulled out after them and found them minus 400 horses out of 1200. Oh! But didn't we have some fun with them fellows? Joking them about fighting Indians. Well they repair up and start back in haste, but we are left behind again, which did not suit us at all. The Chians were all on the war path, but were not made of the same fighting blood that our other pets were up in Utah and we had but little fear of them. They would sneak around and capture a small party and scalp and burn them. They are the most cruel rascals on the plains, and the greatest cowards of any Indians I ever saw. 25 of them will not face 7 of our soldiers to fight them if they can help it; so we did not want any truck with them.\n\nWe now come to the year 1870 which opened to us new fields of operation. We\n\nwent from our quiet quarter to Fort Deadwood to see what was there for us. As we were on the road looking out for Mr. Chian (for he don't like buffalo soldiers as they called us) and they wanted to get one of us to see what kind of scalps\n\nwe would make. We met with a band of them one day and fixed to give them a\n\nshaking up, but they were not like our old pets the Utes and Modocs. They got a way off about three miles and took a good look, at us and then went off. While we were on the road to Fort Deadwood, orders came for us to go back out where Custer was. And you bet we were a glad set of boys, for we were all getting tired of fooling around. And in a few days, we were on the road a happy set of chaps. We had got 100 miles of our distance when a band of Sioux and Sorapees wanted to know where we were going? And we introduced ourselves to them. They accepted our challenge and waltzed out and took hold of us, but we flogged them before dinner was ready. They left us and went into Mamon Mountain and prepared to deal us a heavy blow. Well, we were rested up and had been well fed and we wanted all of the fighting we could get. We only had to wait two weeks for the racket. Keep in mind that while on the road to Fort Deadwood, we received orders to join Custer from that Fort, and meanwhile we were to see after this band of Indians. We were 300 strong, but it would have made no difference if we had been 300 or 400, we had to go there. They attacked us and we gave them another flogging (they attacked us on Deadman Mountain, that is what the Indians called it). This racket cost as 18 horses and 12 or 17 men killed and wounded. Then they skipped out and went to their village, which was 50 miles from there. So we began to prepare for another night ride. We went to Deadwood and did what we were sent to do, and then started for our big village to gee if there was any business there. We got within five miles of their village and thought we were slipping up on them in good shape. We went into camp to wait for night. About ten o'clock we rigged up and started. When we got within one mile of the village we made a rush, but we found the village deserted. We bad to accept one of the greatest suprises that we had ever heard of. And that was the Indians attacking at night. While we were slipping up on their village, they were slipping up on our wagons. One mile in our rear, when we understood what was going on at the wagon train. we marched back double quick to find teamsters fighting like veterans. There were some sick soldiers left at the wagons and that was all that saved the train from being burned. We soon routed the Indians when we got there. We then went into camp, wondering what was up that the Indians attacked after night, but it was accounted for. There were 50 renegades at the head of it. The next day we overtook them and they had their families with them and could not get out of our way. Well we took them in or tried to. I tell you, They fought like heroes. They stood us man to man, and at the hotest of the fight, 250 Sioux joined them and turned the tide against us, and we had all we could do to save our scalps. We had a running fight all day until about 2 or 3 o clock in the afternoon when they thought they had us. And they made a charge on us. Well if ever you have shot in a flock of black birds, you can form an idea how the poor fellows were slaughtered. For we held our re until they were within fifty yards of us and then let them have a double broadside. For my part, I felt sorry for them, but we could not help it. If they had got us, they would have burned us at the stake, and we were soldiers and had to obey orders and not a few of the boys liked that kind of order. Well, they came at us two or three times but we repulsed them each time, too severely to suit them, and they drew off at last. We saw them no more that day. We did not lose much that time in the fight.\n\nSeptember 19, 1889\n\nLet me know relate the circumstance of the devotion and the courage of a young Sioux Squaw. \"It is the custom of the Sioux, when they go to battle to take their wives along with them, and the women will get up on a hill and dance, sing and clap their hands. They call it pleasing the great spirit, so that he will help the warriors in gaining a victory.\" This young squaw that I am telling about was the wife of a young chief, and when the ball opened, he came within 300 yards of our lines and emptied his 16 shot Henry rifle right into our lines. Of course he was shot down at once with 50 belle in his body. His wife saw when he fell and she came on the run and got to where he laid and gathered him up in her arms, and started away. But before the poor thing had got 20 steps she fell wounded. We were all amazed to see her. We went to where she was and she said \"O! you mean soggers!\" Well, I tell you it touched a tender spot in our hearts. We tried to save her, but she was shot in seven places. She was young and pretty and could talk very plain, I have seen lots of Indians shot but I never saw anything to make a fellow think of mothers and sisters at home as that did.\n\nThat battle ended. We were called back to Texas to witness as heart-rending an affair as I ever saw or heard tell of. We went back to Texas in all haste. In Texas the people were trying to settle up the Territory, for there was some fine land in Texas, the Cheyennes and Arapahoes were raiding the settlers, that is why we were called there. There was a Colony of people settling south west of Fort Worth 100 miles, and the Indians had swooped down upon them and killed and scalped about 30 of them. We were right on their heels on one occasion when they were about exterminating a whole settlement. They had killed eight men and had taken three young girls and ravished them to death. Among the women that were scalped was, Mrs. Jon Friend, now living east of El Dorado. Several years ago I was helping to run a threshing machine and we went to their house and the men were talking of her having been scalped by the Indians, and I recognized her by the description of the time and place that the incident occurred. I asked her if she remembered that on the morning that she was scalped by the Indians, how the colored soldiers swooped down on them and saved her life? I told her that I was one of those soldiers, and we made it hot for those Indias. She looked at me in astonishment. I have never seen her since. That was one of my adventures that she can witness to if you ask her. Well a short time afterward they made a raid in Texas and took four more young girls and ravished them to death and cut their breasts off close to the bone, and took one man and chopped him up alive. Now let us follow them and see where they went, and what becomes of them. They went from Texas to Colorado and then back to Fort Sill. Why did they come back to Fort Sill? They were on a treaty at the time they committed these depredations. We were at their heels. We followed them on all the round that they went, and when they brought up at Fort Sill, we were on their track and knew just what they had done. 'They did not know what we were up to but they found out in a few days. We had full details of the tradgedy's. Let us see what had happened after the lndians had left the place of crime in Texas and we were on their trail. General Sherman was on his way to visit the Army at Fort Sill and as it happened he came up through Texas by way of Fort Worth, and heard what the Indians had been doing. He went to the spot and saw with his own eyes, and he hastened to Sill and got there two days before we did and was waiting for us to come so he could find out what lndians we had followed from Texas, and we told him those were the gents that had just got in a day before us, and he was satisfied that he had the coon up the tree. So he ordered boots and saddles sounded and had all the cavalry in arm, and mounted\n\nin 15 minutes and General Sherman took command himself. He marched us down to the Indian village and demanded old Satanta, Bigtree, Lonewolf, Stumbling bear, and 75 warrior; which the Indians refused to give up. Then Sheman asked to have a talk with those four chiefs, all the time, the village was surrounded by 1200 soldiers and 8 pieces of artillery. Well they consented that the chiefs hold council with the great Chief Sherman. So the council sat and Sherman put this question, \"Satanta why did you break your treaty and going into Texas and massacre those helpless people?\" Satanta was silent and refused to answer. \"Why did you go into Texas and and capture three young girls and ravish\n\nthem to death? Satanta refused to answer. General Sherman then made a speech to the tribe about as follows, \"To all the Indians present. Your four great Chief have broken their treaty of peace acceded to them by the great Chief at Washington and have gone into Texas and massacred a settlement of white people. And taken three young girls and brutally murdered them, ravished them\n\nto death, and cut their breast off! And now they are here asking privileges of the treaty. I appeal to you Indians of the tribes that these four Chiefs and 75\n\nwarriors be given up to be taken back to Texas, to be tried.\" \"Old Satanta speaks and confesses to all the crimes, \"I and my 75 young men did go to Texas and kill heap of white people, and did capture three white squaws and ravished them, but I did not mean that my young men should do that. But when I found out what they were doing I did not stop them it was too late, white squaw was\n\nalmost dead. Then, we did not break our treaty, you did not give us (chuckaway) rations as you promised you would do. Your soldiers in Texas killed all my family two years ago, and burned up my village. And you promised to pay me for them and your great Chief at Washington lied and you are heap big dog (at the same time drawing a revolver) and I and my 75 warriors will not go to Texas to be tried. (at the same time Sherman gives command \"read arms,\") \"what I did in Texas I did it to train my young men for I will fight the white men till I die. I am on the war-path now and never will I treat again.\" Sherman speaks: \"I will not talk any longer; will you surrender, Santanta?\"Santanta: \"I will not (he drew big revolver, but a soldier, Sherman's orderly, fired at the chief, and he jumped his poney and started away, but he was surrounded and bound. All the men began to shoot at the soldiers and the whole band of soldiers cut loose at them and killed 30 on 40 of them on the spot.\n\nWell, we had it hot, for all day and many of the Indians were killed. They all broke out on the war-path and made it hot for the white man wherever they fought him, which was pretty often. The soldiers shot these fellows awfully. We\n\nput chains on the chiefs and sent to the authorities for them to come and fetch\n\nthem, and they came in a hurry after the gents. And started back with them and\n\nthey rebelled at the Fort before they got them away, and displayed concealed weapons, and all four of them got shot dead. All the rest of the tribe struck the warpath and took to the mountains.\n\nWe now leave Fort Sill and go back to Colorado, and spend a short time. We\n\nwent to Fort Kiuney on the Colorado River, and the Six, Utes and three other tribes that I do not remember the names of, offered us some business, which we gladly accepted and got done up in bad shape, for the scamps surrounded us with prairie fire and came near burning us all up, taking advantage of the occasion. And if they didn't warm our jackets. I don't know anything.\n\nNow, let me tell you how I came near passing in my checques. This was in 1870 as my time came to go on Videt Post, one half mile from camp, after a\n\nhard days travel in the rain and I was much worn out, after sunset I was put\n\non Videt Post, to stand until dark. I was standing there and all at once my\n\nfaithtul horse gave a sudden jump and in an instant I looked behind me and saw four Sioux Indians, within 75 feet of me, trying to lip up on me and capture\n\nme. Well you may bet I showed them different from that. I had two Smith & Wesson 45 calibre revolvers with me and before they could spring on to me I fired and emptied one saddle or thought I did. I know the pony ran into camp and was captured by the soldiers. The instant I fired 5 or 6 rushed right up to me and\n\nthrew several lances at me, all of which went wide of the mark. Well I just stayed\n\nwith them chaps until they got too hot for me, then I started for camp. And as\n\nI started, one of them threw his lariat rope at me and missing me, caught my\n\nhorse around the neck. At the same time, five of the guard from camp joined me and turned the game. I got the rope the Indian had it tied to his saddle and\n\nwhen be caught my horse he out it. They fired as much as twenty shots at me and I did not get a scratch other than e fearful blow over the head with à lance as it was thrown at me.\n\nMy horse got a fearful out with a lanos as it was thrown at me; one of the Indians rode up to my side and snapped his pistol at my bead, but it refused to go. And as I brought down on him he sang out \"waugh towoth!\" (me dead!). Well, with the guard, We soon ended that affair. You will ask why a good soldier will let the enemy slip up on him. You see it was in the fall. We had a heavy fog and mist of rain, and at sun set it was almost dark. As the fog settled around me I could not see more than seventy five or eighty steps, I had just looked in the direction from which they had come and turned around in another direction, when my horse got a scent of them. If it had been clear I would seen them them three hundred yards off. What a miracle that I got away.\n\nWell I went to guard at the Post and close to camp. We put out a heavy guard that night, for we knew that the Indians were close to us. Before day the next morning we were up in arms and making ready for fight, for we knew that they would be on us.\n\nSure enough, all day break we put on another videt on the Post where I was the evening before. He had not been there twenty-five minutes before he reported the Indians by the hundreds. So, we rolled out, for we were not in a good\n\nplace to accept battle. We had gone 3 miles when they pressed us so hard we had to stop and give battle. They charged on us, and we piled the poor fellows up in heaps. Still they were determined to capture our whole force. We made one charge on them which was a bad mistake. When a company charges, they always get scattered at the end of charge, and if they have no supporting columns behind, they are in a bad fix if they do not rout the foe. We were not supported and the Indians took advantage of this move on our port and shot our men down like birds for a few moments. We got straight at last and turned the tide.\n\nIn this charge, I had liked to have passed in my checks again.\n\nMy old faithful horse fell, and threw me in the midst of the savages and all that saved me was my trusty Spencer rifle and my nimble legs. When my horse got up he kept on with the column and got in his place (a well drilled cavalry horse will keep his place in ranks without a rider. I have often seen my horse do it ) as I was about the middle of the column when my horse fell, by running my best I kept up, as we did not have far to go before we stopped to form again and I came out with the last of the column. But that was a a narrow escape. When we got righted again we left charges out, got down to fine work and that was all that saved our scalps. We whipped them on the run and followed them ten miles. I went by the place where I encountered the Indians while on videt Post and two or three yards from there laid two dead Indians. I told the boys that I had done that piece of work on videt Post the evening before. They hardly believed that I did, but one of them had a lance with blood and black hair on it. As my horse had been cut with a lance, I was certain that this was the same one that had given him the cut the evening before.\n\nThis ends one of the closest rubs we ever got into. I do not know how many got killed, but a lot of the boys went down to rise no more.\n\nWe now are called to Camp Supply for winter quarters. Custer, Miles, Pinro\n\nand Reno were rounding the Indians up in good shape and sending them to Camp\n\nSupply; and we were sent there to watch them and never saw General Custer again, for he stayed in the mountains and sent us to Camp Supply-that is, all the colored troops.\n\nSeptember 26, 1889\n\nThis is 1870: Now we were all at Camp Supply, and the Indians were coming in by the thousand. We were not\n\nto fight any more for some time, but had to watch the Indians. We bad 80,000 Indians at Camp Supply, and we went to work building quarters for winter\n\nand having fun with the Indians.\n\nAt Supply, there is lots of timber and we had to cut logs and build houses. Well, we went to work chopping logs, fishing, and hunting turkeys. And still the Indians come in from Custer's battle field. These were parts of the tribes of the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Apaches, Sioux,\n\nSerapees, Dogheads, Utes, Crowfeet, and many others that I have forgotten. Well we got winter quarters done and moved into them and lived at home for the first time since we had been in the army. The Indians were coming in by hundreds every day and rations were being moved from Fort Dodge Kansas, for the Indians and we had some pleasant trips guarding the wagon trains from Dodge to Supply. The most fun we had was driving cattle from Texas to Supply, for the Indians beef. We had all the time at the post from 1000 to 3000 head of Texas cattle and we had to herd them and we had a great time with them long horns. They often stampeded us and we could not dismount from our horses while on the prairie herding and it was an interesting night to see the Indians on ration drawing days. We would cut out 100 head of cattle for them to make beef of. They would then mount their ponies and stampede the cattle and they would all start for them. It was a sight to see them shoot the cattle. They would go at it like they did when they were fighting us. They would be half a day killing 100 head of cattle, some of the cattle would run 5 or 6 miles before they would get them killed.\n\nThe Indians at Supply numbered about 3,000 and drawing rations every day,\n\ncattlé, bacon, sugar, coffee, flour, meal, beans and rice. Well this went on for a\n\nmonth or so and we were awakened to the fact that the Indians were dissatisfied\n\nabout something, and so the Officers go about to find out where the trouble is and when found out, it turned out that the Indians had got provisions enough\n\nlaid up to last them to fight on all winter and they want to start on the war path.\n\nIt must be remembered that all the rations the Government had given them\n\nthey had carried out in the mountains and stowed away for future use. We found this out but too late. The interpreters are sent among the Indians to try to get them to resist from going to war, but in vain, they are ordered out of the village with threats of scalping them. They come back and say, \"it is no use the Indians are bound to go to war.\"\n\nWell we were in a close place, 30,000 Indians around us and we were only 1200 strong, and no chance of getting reinforcements in time to check the on-coming tide. Col. Nelson, then in command of the Fort causes a mighty stir in the\n\nFort. He ordered all the guns man'd, 5 in number, and called in all the Fort labor-\n\ners and got ready to fight.\n\nWe had at this time some small stations, such as stage station and scouting\n\nstation and they were all exposed to sudden destruction and we could not\n\nhelp them, for we had not the men to send. But the stage stations, these were\n\nof importance, so we had to make an effort to save it at all hazzards. So my company was sent out at night to get to the stage Station and entrench. The Station was forty miles from Supply and we started on forced march, at 12 o'clock that night and got to the Station at daybreak, but found all the soldiers\n\ndead and all the horses gone and the stage that was due at Supply had been\n\ncaptured and all the passengers massacred and scalped. The stage burned and\n\nthe mail gone. 45 lives were destroyed at the Station and stage, 32 soldiers were\n\nkilled at the start, without firing a shot. You will want to know why the soldiers did not fight the Indians? Well at the station, the Indians were in the habit of drawing rations, and they were known by the soldiers to be at peace. Nothing was suspected until all were struck down as at one blow. The Indians showed no sign of war and each Indian picked out his men and at a given signal from their Chief, each killed his man. And so the 32 soldiers were killed at one stroke. Well\n\nit was a sad sight, but could not be helped. If the soldiers had known what had\n\nbeen going on at the Fort, they would have been ready, but you see, the whole\n\nthing was done in one day. We buried the dead and gave chase to some of the\n\nIndians, but to no purpose.\n\nLet us now go back to the Fort and see what went on there after we left. The Indians broke out at the Fort and tried to take it, but they used the cannon on them and saved the Fort, but they had a hard fight. Well, the Indians said they would take us in, so they came for us, but we had seen too many Indians for them to take us in.\n\nFor some reason we did not stop at the stage Station and entrench ourselves as we intended to do. But we went on to Fort Dodge, Kansas, and got some Infantry that was there, and started back to Camp Supply. Well, when we got back to the stage Station, Mr. Indian was waiting for us on the road, and they\n\njumped onto us, but we beat them bad and followed them and overtook them\n\nand recaptured one whole herd of stage horses that they had stolen from the station. We killed 31 of their band and got five of them alive, and here was the first time that I had ever seen an Indian scalped. But our boys had began to get mad now and they scalped all five of them to revenge the victims at the stage Station. I did not think it was right, not with standing the cruel slaughter at the Station, perpetrated by them.\n\nWe hastened on to Camp Supply and joined our forces for the 'fray. All the\n\nIndians had left when we got back and were out on the Chippewa Mountains and so we had a long ride ahead of us. We go to pay them a visit. Well we went up there to see them, we sent them word that no quarters would be shown until the Station massacre was paid off. And they fixed up for the same (and don't you forget it.) 1200 Infantry came down to Camp Supply and took possession of good quarters, that we had built. And we were deprived of them, and had to go\n\nand get Custer half whipped Indians. We saw some of Custer's soldiers, and\n\ntold them for heavens sake, to whip them well before they sent them down to me. For we had to go back and do their work all over again. We told them when\n\nwe were with them; we taught them to do a good job. But they were getting care less now. Well, we brought up at Chippewa Mountain, there we found the Indians concealed in the great hill and hard to get out, but we were bound to make the effort and so we picked out 100 good sharp-shooters and stationed them in the hills with Lieutenant L. in command. While all the rest of the troops went round\n\nto punch them out on the side where the sharp-shouters were stationed. And the\n\nracket commenced. We have got them now, but we are too few in number. Major\n\nK. is none too gritty, but my Captain and Lieutenant saved the day, (Let me tell you here, what kind of timber our Major was made of) He had never been in any Indian fights with us, although he was then in command of our Regiment. Well we find him to be a baby in fighting Indians, and if it had not been for our Captain and Lieutenant, the Indians would have taken us all in that day. I will describe the ground that we fought over. Chipewa Mountain is not unlike the northern mountains, but are very much the same. I say northern because this is 100 miles south of the mountains of Utah and Dakota, where we used to have so much fun with Custer. There are two large mountains, one the south of the other, and one mile between the two is a nice green valley of about 600 acres. And broken at the foot of the mountains by lava beds and ravines, and the pass or inlet to the valley was 76 yards wide. And only one way for the soldiers to go in at. But the Indians have many ways of getting into it. Well, Major K drove the Indians in at the pass and followed right into the valley. Our Captain told him that he would never get out, but he said \"He was in command and knew his business:\" Well, Captain O. said he was not going to take his men in there to save them massacred, and so he disobeyed order and kept us out and chose a place to fight. He drew us back about 500 yards from the pass, and waited to see what Major K. was going to do. Captain C. had been fighting Indians about 3 years and knew just how to take them, and so did his men. But Major K. had his orderly black his boots that morning as if going on dress parade and had on a white shirt. Something I never saw Custer wear.\n\nWell, the Major went into the pass about ten companies strong and all had got well in, when the Indians with a fearful \"yell\" raised up out of the Lava beds within 460 yards of him, and poured in a deadly volley from their Winchester rifles into his ranks and that spread confusion among his men that he lost all control over them. They made a rush for the gap only to meet death at the door. Well, where were the old companies H and I? The old Custer-Indian fighters, who had disobeyed orders, and would not go in? A soon as the fight began we made a rush for the pass, but not to go in. We dismounted and climbed up the mountains on each side of the pass, and acted as sharpshooters. The Indians followed the soldiers close up to the pass and by this time we had got 75 or 80 rods back from the pass up in the mountain and that left the Indians between us. As they got close to the pass driving the soldiers out, they sallied out in a close\n\nspace. At that moment, Captain C. gave the command to charge.\n\nWe swooped down behind them and had them in open field, and, if ever I\n\nheard Spencers crack. I did that day. There was no way to get out but behind the soldiers. They had just drove out, and you will remember that we had deployed\n\nsharp-shooters at the commencement on the right and left of us. When the Indians attempted to go to ether side of the pass to go up in the hills, they would cover the ground with them. Well, H and I companies captured and killed two hundred Indians on the spot, while Major K was running from them with ten companies.\n\nYou will want to know what we had done with our horses? While we slipped\n\nup in the hills, we left number 1's and 3's to hold horses heads and tails fashion.\n\nWhen Major K cleared the pass, he came near taking our horses for Indians and\n\nfiring into them. The flag is all that saved them.\n\nWell, we had to do those Indians up, and get out of there, as quick as we could. We had so completely surprised the Indians, that they did not know what to make of it. They thought all the soldiers were in the valley and supposed they had stampeded the whole army, but when we were brought to bear on them, they were scared and superstitious and said the \"Great Spirit had sent us.\" And he did; for Captain C. had a great spirit when he got some of Custer's tricks in his head. We had thrashed the rascals out of their boots, or mocassins rather, before they knew what we were about.\n\nWe had it hot the next day. Some bands came and joined them and made preparations to come and pay us back. So, we fix for them and the third day after we defeated them, they came to see us again. We met them on the half-way ground, and had a flying fight all day until 4 or 5 o'clock in the evening, when they made a mad circle and came on us in full force.\n\n​ We had a little hand to hand scramble for about twenty-five minutes which cost us a good many horses. This is one of their tricks, first to kill all the horses and they think we cannot get away. But we had not come to that part, they had to whip us before we would try to get away. We whipped them and drove them off for the present but they came back with other fresh bands. We could hear the renegades say, \"Look out for them soldiers that was with Custer! For they are h- to fight.\" They were some of the same renegades we had to deal with while we\n\nwere with our old friend Custer.\n\nMost of our men were new except H. and I. companies. We had been in over\n\nthree years and had been through the flint mills. I remember on one occasion I was sent out on a hill to look out for Indians. They got between me and camp and they thought they had me. Four of them made a dive for me and we had a running fight. My old faithful horse always a little wiser than I was, always knew when I was in a close place and he did not appreciate it any better than I\n\ndid. Well the Indians run on to me and shot at me with arrows, one of which went through my canteen and the next struck my saddle. One of the scamps came too close to me and I let him have the contents of my Smith & Wesson revolver, which knocked him out of his saddle. An soon as he fell I stopped and tried to give him a sure shot but at that moment, two others closed on me and we had it for awhile. As it happened, they had nothing but arrows to fight with and I soon taught them that arrows would not compete with Spencer rifles which I used to perfection on that occasion.\n\nOctober 3, 1889\n\nPART 3RD\n\nWell I suppose they would have got me then if the rest of the lookout had not arrived on the spot at that moment. I always made it a point not to run\n\nuntil I was compelled to. I always had an idea\n\nthat I could whip three or four Indians and I wanted the opportunity that I just had. When I got back to camp, the Captain wanted to know why I did not\n\nhasten back when I was attacked? I told him that I did not like to run before I had fought any. I told him I could take care of 4 of them any time. I heard that\n\nbe said afterwards that, that was more than he would have done. He would not risk himself with 4 Indians. But I saw him on one occasion encounter 7 Indians. They had him completely surrounded. But we got there in time to save him from the stake. I say stake, because when ever they caught an officer they burned him and they generally took one whole day over it. We will now go back to the battle. We wallowed about with them two or three days more and drove them all back up into the mountains.\n\nWe then ran down to Fort Hayes to rest a while; and found the pay-master there, and he paid us all off. Then we had a racket with Wild Bill and his band of outlaws.\n\nAt Fort Hays, there in a settlers town called Hayes City, and Wild Bill was running the whole thing. When we were paid off, all were allowed to go to Hayes City to trade, as it was only one half mile from the Fort. So we all went over there one day, and Wild Bill was there, and he said that he built that town and he did not want any negros in it. We told him that we would give him until night to take that back. He said, \"There in not negro soldiers enough in the 10th Caralry to make him take back any thing.\"\n\nSo we all started back to tho Fort and told him we would be back that night.\n\nWe had not been gone more than thirty minutes when he shot one o\" his own\n\ncowardly men. Well fifty of the boys slipped out, that night and went down there and demanded Wild Bill and his crew, which wan about 75 or 80 me. And they sent the boys word to leave the town in 20 minutes or they would hang the last one of them. So the ball opened with a shower of bullets into the building in which the outlaws were, which killed 4 or 5 of them. They made a rush for the door, and were shot down as fast as they came out. Let me my here that they shot one soldier and hung another before the this was done. Well, that town was\n\nall torn to pieces, and that band of Wild Bill's was broken up for good. And it did\n\nthe citizens good favor to have such a set of fellows cleared out. For they always\n\ndid things to smit themselves. And would shoot down helpless men that got in their way. But the soldiers cleared them out without orders.\n\nI will give you a short history or the Wild Bills that were on the Plains. First,\n\nwere a dirty lot of cowards that would not shoot a man unless his back was toward them. They would not come out and face a man fairly, and they got their\n\nnames by shooting down helpless men that were not prepared for encounter. I remember on one occasion when with five others, I was sent to Sheridan City, near Fort Wallace. There were five Wild Bills there, that had a grudge against one of our scouts. (our scouts were all white men) and was going to kill him on first sight. We had the same scout with us. They saw us coming and recognized their man that they were going to kill. He said to us boys, stand by me, and we told him if he showed the coward we would give him up to them, and told him that we would be at his heels.\n\nAs we got into the town, they got their winchester rifles, and demanded Johnie\n\n(that was the scouts name) and we told them, If they want him, and would go at him one at a time, they could take him, but we would not have two against one. We know that Johnie would whip any one of them. We told them if they attempted to double on him, we would riddle them with bullets. Well they were too cowardly to attack him one at a time and we had Johnie to dare them to fight him, and could not get them too cheap. This shows what kind of timber the Wild Bills were made of.\n\nWe will now go back and finish with Hayes City, the town was burned that night. That is all the disroputable houses that were run by the outlaws. One soldier was killed and ten of the outlaws and one found hanging dead by the neck. The next morning the boys had to do some tall talking to get out of that scrape. For it was done by soldiers that had slipped out of camp without order. And by the time the Post was, alarmed by the shooting and the guard had got down there, the soldiers had all got back to camp and ready to answer to roll call.\n\nWhich was always the case when any racket was raised after tape.\n\nWe only stayed at Fort Hayes two weeks, and was then off to the mountains\n\nagain. We go now to the Rocky Mountains, and then south to Mexico, and then\n\nback to Fort Keeny. Here we met with a band of Sioux and had a fight. And got\n\nwhipped out of our Jackets. We were divided up and scouting the country when one of our parties came up with the Indians, and had a set to, the Indians\n\noutnumbered us five to one. But we never would run, without a fight, so we\n\naccepted, fought and got flogged; but we laid it up to get buck on them.\n\nWe now left Fort Keeny and went to Nevada and got on to them and had one\n\nof the hardest fights I ever witnessed. We had the Utes, Arapahoes and Elk\n\nMountain Utos, all on us at once. We were now on Grand River, and in the\n\nCanyon we took our stand, where the Big Man Creek empties into Grand River. We had a good battle ground, but the Indians had better. They came out to try us on fair ground. When they appeared out of view, we gave them galling fire,\n\nbut they came on. When they got within 200 yards of us, we started out to meet\n\nthem. Two of our officers fell in that charge, but we locked with them and had an interesting time for 30 minutes. We finally got the advantage on them and gave them a flank movement and got them separated and moved them down like grass. Well, we slaughtered them fellows unmercifully, but we lost fearfully in horses and wounded. But not any killed; when we got them on the ran we kept up with them until they got to the Canyons and when they got in we were right at their heels and saw where they hid. But before they could prepare to give us a galling fire, we were in their holes, dealing death on every side. We stayed with them two days, and allowed them no chance to rest or rally together. Well it was awful, I never saw such wholesome slaughter and we shared a good part of it.\n\nI saw one of our men get separated from his company in this fight, and the Indians cut him off, then one Indian rode hard at him with a lance, at the same time, the Indian threw his lance. A the same time the Indian threw his lance, the soldier shot the Indian and they both fell dead at the same time. And I saw another hand to hand combat between a soldier and an Indian. They had both emptied their rifles and were attempting to reload. But the Indian was getting there first. We yell'd out, \"give him the cold steel Dick!\", and Dick drew his sabre and made the Indian draw his knife, and for a while those chaps did fly around. Dick broke the arm of the Indian, at the same moment, someone stuck in a good shot that caught the Indian between the eyes and parted his skull.\n\nWe just whippod those fellows as bad as I ever saw a band of Indians whipped.\n\nWe were 975 strong and they were 1500 strong. We pulled out of that bloody\n\nscrape only to find another in a few days afterwards.\n\nWe travelled 17 miles south and they jumped us again and got four of our wagons and burned four teamsters and six soldiers, and tried to get us all to\n\nburn. We got 30 squaws and children, and 100 head of ponies, but they made a\n\ncharge on us and killed most all the ponies. Our fire was so galling that they\n\nlost ten to one of men killed. We had to shoot some of our captives, for when\n\nthe Indians made a charge, or when they got a chance, they would pounce upon\n\na soldier and clip him to pieces with their knives. But we soon put a stop to\n\nthat, by the time we had shot two or three, they learned a lesson. But we\n\nstuck to that crowd. We killed old White Cloud, and many more great Chiefs\n\nwhose names I have forgotten just now\n\nThis battle lasted four days, and we had our hands more than full. We were\n\nby this time greatly reduced in numbers and the enemy had increased. But there\n\nwas no way out of it. But fight to the bitter end, which we did, like heroes.\n\nThe Indians had laid on ambush with-in 100 yards of our main line of battle,\n\nwhich was doing deadly execution, and we had to get them out of their position Lieutenant L, called for fifty veterans which was quickly responded to. I was\n\nOctober 10, 1889\n\n​Part 3rd\n\nNow before we talk about the slaughter that took place, I will give you a description of our journey that night. We had to hug close to the fool of the mountains and the great boulders lay thick and as large as a covered wagon.\n\nSome places we could walk under them and some we had to climb over them, and some places we would have to wade a pool of water up to our belts and some places we would climb up on a big boulder and down under us would be a pool of water four feet deep and we would have to slide down under the boulder into the water in order to get over. We had no way to get round, it was strict orders for a man not to speak or even to grunt. I remember one fellow that was in front that night. He had got up on one of the great rocks and looked down and said, \"Captain, I can't go down there,\" at the same time he slipped and fell about 90 feet and struck in a large pool of water and be cried out, \"Great God! Boys, I am a goner.\" Well he struggled for dear life, and we made sure our trick was made known, but the Indians did not hear him. But the Captain gave orders\n\nthat the next man that spoke, he would split his head open with his sword and\n\nwe took him at his word. For me knew him too well to disobey, so we toiled on\n\nuntil two o'clock and settled down to wait the dreaded morning. We were now in the Indians hiding place and they did not have men enough on the Plains to get us out, we had 400 men in charge of the wagons, and one piece of artillery"
