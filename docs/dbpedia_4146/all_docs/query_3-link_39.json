Many of the photographs and all of the negatives were taken by Cupp, though some images of the Scripps campus and personnel were taken by Harry Erickson (the \"Flying Photographer\") and Eugene LaFond, and have been credited where appropriate. A selection of photographs from the collection have been digitized, and can be viewed through links in the container list.\n\nArranged in five subseries: A) Animal and Objects, B) People, C) Places, D) Ships and E) Research."
