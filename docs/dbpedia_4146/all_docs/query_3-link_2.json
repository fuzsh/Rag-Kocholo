He entered the Naval V-5 program in 1941 and was commissioned in the United States Marine Corps the following year. Cupp served with Marine Fighting Squadron 213 (VMF-213) in the South Pacific until September 1943, when he was shot-down over the Solomon Islands. After an extended hospital stay for severe burns, he returned to active duty in February 1945 as a naval flight instructor.
