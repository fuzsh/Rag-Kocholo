By J. SCOTT KELT IE, Librarian to the Royal Geographical Society, London. IN the space which can be allotted to this Introduction, only the most important geographical discoveries can be briefly indicated, and only the greater territorial changes to which States have been subjected EUR In Europe during the century all the great States have insti- tuted or improved their surveys, so that the greater part of the Continent is now officially mapped. The various Alpine clubs have done much for a knowledge of the mountainous regions of Europe, while many private explorers have worked out the physical geography of special districts. The following are the leading territorial changes which have occurred during the century. It is unnecessary to notice the many fluctuations that took place under the Napoleonic regime, before 1815. In 1809 the whole of Finland and the Aland Islands were handed over to Russia by Sweden. In 1814 Norway was transferred to Sweden by Denmark. By the Peace of Akerman, 1817, ratified by Treaty of Adrianople, 1829, the freedom of Servia, subject to the pay- ment of tribute and to the presence of Turkish garrisons in certain towns, was decreed. The independence of Greece was by the Treaty of Adrian- ople (1829) acknowledged by the Porte. A Kingdom of Greece was formed, taking in Peleponnesus, Eubcea, the Cyclades, and a small part of Central Greece, south of a line drawn from the Gulf of Arta to the Gulf of Volo. Poland was made an integral part of the Russian Empire in 1832. By the Treaty of London (November 15, 1831). Belgium, till then a part of the Netherlands, was constituted an inde- pendent and neutral State. The Grand Duchy of Luxemburg was divided, the fortress of Luxemburg remaining in the hands of the King of Holland as Grand Duke, who also, in com- pensation for the part of Luxemburg ceded to Belgium, received a portion of Limburg. Cracow, for thirty years a Republic, was in 1846 incorpo- rated with Austria. By the Paris Conference, 19th August 1858, the Danubian Principalities, Moldavia and Wallachia, were made practi- cally independent. In 1859 Lombardy was added to the Sardinian Kingdom, with the exception of the fortresses of Mantua and Peschiera, and Italy was formed into a Confederation under the presi- dency of the Pope. In 1860 Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Romagna voted their own annexation to Piedmont. The Two Sicilies were won by Garibaldi, and the kingly title of Sardinia was merged in that of the restored Kingdom of Italy, a OPE. In I860 Savoy and Nice were annexed to France. In December 1861 the definitive union of Moldavia and Wallachia, under the name of Rumania, was proclaimed and acknowledged by the Porte. The Kingdom of Greece was in 1864 enlarged by the addition of the Ionian Islands. In terms of the Peace of Vienna, October 1864, Christian IX. of Denmark renounced all claim to Lauenburg, Holstein, and Schleswig. In terms of a Provisional Convention, signed at Gastein, I860, Austria was to have the temporary government of Holstein and Prussia that of Schleswig, while Lauenburg was absolutely ceded to Prussia. The formal cession of Lauenburg to Prussia was made on the 14th August 1865. This Convention of Gastein was abrogated, 1866. By the Treaty of Prague, 23rd August 1866, the old Germanic Confederation (formed 8th June 1815) was dis- solved, and a new Confederation, from which Austria was excluded (Norddeutsciier Bund), was formed under the presi- dency of Prussia, with a common constitution and assembly, the river Main to divide the Northern Confederation from the Southern Confederacy ; Prussia took full possession of Holstein and also of Schleswig, under promise to restore the Northern or Danish part of Schleswig to Denmark if its inhabitants voted for this result — an engagement, however, never seriously intended, and formally abrogated by secret treaty between Austria and Germany on the 11th October 1878. Further, in terms of the Prague Treaty, Prussia annexed Hanover, Hesse-Cassel, Nassau, and the City of Frankfurt. By the Treaty of Vienna, signed 3rd October 1866, Austria surrendered the Quadrilateral (i.e,, the four fortresses of Peschiera on an island in the Mincio; Mantua on the Mincio; Verona and Legnago, both on the Adige) and Venetia to France, who transferred them to Italy. In 1867 the Turkish garrisons in Servia were withdrawn. The same year Luxemburg was, by the Treaty of London, declared neutral territory. Rome was completely evacuated by the French on the 21st August 1870. By royal decree Rome and its provinces were incorporated with the Kingdom of Italy, 9th October 1870. Pius IX. was allowed to retain the Vatican with its dependencies, the churches of Sta. Maria Maggiore, and Castel Gandolfo. As a result of the Franco-German War a treaty was signed 0 INTRODUCTION. between France ruul Germany at Frankfurt, on the 10th May 1871. By this treaty France surrendered to Germany the province of Alsace — with the exception of Belfort Castle, which was restored to France — and the larger part of Lorraine. Thereby was the French frontier, which first reached the Rhine in 1648, pushed hack from it; under the name of Elsass-Lotiiringen, these territories now form part of the German Empire, but not part of the Kingdom of Prussia or any other German State. 'Hie German Empire, dissolved in 1806, was, as a result of flic Franco-German War, reconstituted in 1871, with the King of Prussia as German Emperor. In formulation of the results of the llusso-Turkish War, was signed by the European Powers the Treaty of Berlin, 1 3th duly 1878, to supersede and annul the Treaty of San Stefano. In terms of the Berlin Treaty, Bulgaria north of the Balkans was constituted an autonomous principality, tributary to the Sultan ; Bulgaria south of the Balkans was made into a province, with the title of Eastern Rumelia, subject to the authority of the Sultan, but with a Christian governor and an autonomous administration ; Montenegro was declared inde- pendent of Turkey, with new boundaries and Antivari for seaport; Servia, under a native dynasty, was constituted a free State, released from all tribute or vassalage. A slight increase of territory was also allowed Servia, but the boundary line is so drawn as to leave part of the old Servian land to the Turk, and to carefully keep apart the frontiers of the Servian and Montenegrin Principalities. Rumania, moreover, was declared independent, losing, however, to Russia the part of Bessarabia acquired in 1856 in exchange for the Dourudsciia. The Berlin Treaty further advised the Porte to make some cession of territory to Greece, and the line of frontier subsequently recommended gave to Greece Janjna as well as Thessaly. It was also provided that Austria should occupy and administer Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the Berlin Conference Dulcigno was assigned to Monte- negro. On the 26 -27th November 1880 the surrender of Dulcigno to Montenegro was finally made. In 1881 Rumania was created into a Kingdom. By convention between Turkey and Greece, signed 2nd July, and carried into effect 6th July 1881, Thessaly was ceded to Greece. By an Anglo-German Agreement, signed July 1, 1890, Heli- goland was transferred to Germany. AS In the early part of the century Asia was visited by many travellers, not all of whom can be strictly regarded as explorers. In 1800-2 Leake visited Asia Minor, Palestine, and Cyprus, mainly as an arcluEologist. Seetzen, also as a scholar and archaeologist, spent several years (1802-6) in Asia Minor and Syria, and in 1807 et seq. visited Northern Arabia. Burck- hardt (1808-12) spent four years in Syria and the Sinai Peninsula. Still more important was his journey (1814-16) to Mecca and Medina and other parts of Arabia. Pottinger’s mission from India to Baluchistan in 1810 was a noteworthy land march. Fraser’s travels in Persia in 1821 are still important, and in the same year Csoma visited Bokhara and Balkh. Wellsted, in 1829-35, besides exploring the Sinai Peninsula and surveying the Arabian and Nubian coasts of the Red Sea, made an extensive journey through Oman. The Euphrates Expedition (1835-37) under Chesney (who had previously done much travelling in these regions) was fruitful in results in many directions. Its object was the establish- ment of steam communication with India, and its route lay through almost unexplored countries. Tobler’s journeys in the East, especially on foot over most of Palestine (1835-36, 1848, 1858, 1865), resulted in rich additions to the topography of the Holy Land. Of equal importance in many respects were the travels in Palestine of Robinson (1838 and 1852), still regarded as an authority on that country. Ainsworth and Rassam’s expedition through Asia Minor, 1839-40, was noteworthy. Beke and Moore in 1837 established the low level of the Dead Sea. Beke’s visit to the Sinai Peninsula in 1873-74 resulted in one of the most important works on that sacred spot. The work of the Palestine Exploration Fund (founded 1865) throws all else into the shade, the results being a perfect map of the country and a whole library of information on all aspects of the Holy Land. One of the most important contributions to a knowledge of Persia during these early years were the travels of Morier (1808 and 1816). In 1879 and following years Sir Charles Wilson did much for the geography of Asia Minor, while the journeys of Tchi- hatchef (1850-59) deserve mention. Noteworthy also are Burton’s visits to the Land of Midian (1877-8), the Blunts’ journeys through Syria and North Arabia (1877-79), and Laurence Oliphant’s travels east of the Jordan. In Arabia the most noteworthy explorations since 1840 have been those of Wrede in Hadramaut and neighbouring regions (1843) ; Burton’s daring visit to Mecca and Medina in 1853; Palgrave’s journey across Arabia, 1862-3, leading- through Nejd and the Wahabite country ; Pelly’s visit to I A. the latter in 1865; Manzoni’s journeys through Yemen to Sana, 1877-78 and 1880 ; Doughty’s extensive travels from Syria south by the pilgrim route to Mecca in 1876 et seq., with excursions into the interior; Glaser’s extensive journeys in Yemen, 1883-85. Farther north, in 1840, Trummer discovered the remains of ancient Nineveh, on which and on the other remains of this region so much work was subsequently done by Layard, Rawlinson, Ainsworth, George Smith, and others. The region as far as Caucasia has been visited by various travellers and expeditions. Ararat was ascended by James Bryce, while quite recently much good work has been done in explor- ing the Caucasus by Freshfield, Grove, Telfer, and Dent. For much of our knowledge of Afghanistan and Baluchistan we are indebted to British political missions and military expeditions. In 1840-41 Stoddart and Connolly passed through Afghanistan on their famous expedition to Bokhara. Bellew travelled in Afghanistan in 1857-8. In 1861 and following years took place Vambery’s journey through Persia to Bokhara and back by Herat. Of great importance was the work of the British Boundary Commissioners (Goldsmid, St. John, and others) in 1870-72 in Eastern Persia and Beluchistan, resulting in St. John’s six-sheet map of Persia. In 1871-2 Bellew accomplished his journey from the Indus to the Tigris. Noteworthy also are V. Baker’s journeys in N. Persia, 1873, Napier’s and Macgregor’s travels through Kiiorassan, 1874 and 1875 ; Tietze’s visits to Elburz and Demavend, 1874 ; and Floyer’s journeys through Baluchistan and Persia, 1875. Since 1875 Houtum-Schindler has con- tributed largely to a knowledge of Persian geography. Mac- gregor explored Northern Baluchistan in 1877, while the Afghan campaign of 1878 added greatly to our knowledge of that country. A number of survey officers accompanied or followed the expedition, and their surveys, combined with the operations of Grodekof and other Russian officers who visited Herat and neighbouring regions, have done much to contri- bute to an accurate knowledge of what is known as the Iranian Plateau. The Afghan Boundary Commission, under Redway and Lumsden, accompanied as it was by specialists, rendered still further service to Iranian geography. Selby’s ascent in 1842 of the Karun and Dizful rivers is classical. Recently his work has been supplemented by the observations of Curzon, Lynch, and Mrs Bishop ; Curzon having also made an extensive journey through Persia, which has had important geographical results. For our knowledge of Central Asia during the present INTRODUCTION. 3 century we are largely indebted to the military expeditions of Russia, while Siberia has been the object of numerous expedi- tions. Only a very few of the numerous expeditions to Siberia can be mentioned. In 1803-6 Krusenstern surveyed the Kuriles, Sagiialien, and the East Siberia coast ; 1805, Sanni- kof discovered the New Siberian and other islands ; 1820-25, Wrangell explored the north coast of Asia and Kamchatka ; 1821 -23, Amjou, N.W. Siberia and especially the lower Lena ; 1826 et seq., Ledebur, the Kirghiz Steppes, the Altai, and Dzungaria. In 1828-30 Hansteen and Erman travelled through nearly the whole of Siberia. In 1813-45 Midden- dorf explored the lower Yenisei and the Amur. Siberia was traversed by Castren in 1845-9 ; and Dittmar explored Kamchatka in 1851-4. The Lake Baikal region has been explored since 1854 by Radde, Meglitsky, and others. In 1868-70 Mardell and Neumann explored the Tchukciii country. In 1877 the great preliminary survey of Siberia as far as Lake Baikal was concluded, and has since been supplemented by more detailed surveys in 1873-76 and following years. In 1877 Finsch and Brehm led an expedition from the Chinese border across Siberia to the Kara Sea. The various geo- graphical societies in Siberia have done much for the explora- tion of the country, while the expedition of Nordenskjold along the north coast of Europe and Asia made numerous additions to existing knowledge, especially during its year’s stay off the Tchukciii Peninsula. A recent expedition under Bunge and Toll, stationed at the mouth of the Lena for several years, made valuable contributions to the geography of the coast, and especially the New Siberian Islands. Among other important names connected with Siberian exploration are those of Radde, Radlof, and Yadrintsef. In other parts of Russian Asia the expeditions have been bewilderingly numerous. One of the most fruitful among the earlier ones was that of Humboldt ill 1829 to the Urals, the Altai, and the Caspian region, resulting in the elaboration of a great system of Central Asian geography. He was accom- panied by Helmersen, who with Baer compiled a vast work, not yet complete, on the Russian Empire and neighbouring lands. Abich’s researches in the Caucasus and Armenia are classical, while Radde has through many years carried out his researches in the Caucasus as well as in other parts of Russian Asia. In 1857 Semenof explored Lake Balkasii, Alatau, the Thian-Shan, and Lake Issik-Kul, and in 1857-8 Severtsoff the whole of the Aralo-Caspian basin. In 1868 and following years Fetchenko made his way through Tur- kestan to the Pamir plateau, and Kaulbars, in 1869, through Kiiokan to Issik-Kul. In 1860-62 the Caucasian region was carefully surveyed to Ararat. In the seventh decade of this century a vast amount of work was done for the exploration of Central Asia, mainly in connec- tion with Russian military advances. Of these we can only mention Fetchenko’s in Russian Turkestan and Khokan (1868-71) ; Skobelef’s strategically important journeys in the Transcaspian region (1871); Kostenko’s exploration of the Lower Amu and Lake Aral; the great Amu-Daria expedition of 1874 under Stolzetof; 1874-6, Musketofs explorations in the Thian-Shan ; Skobelef’s great expedition of 1876, during which Kostenko penetrated to the great Lake Karakul on the Pamir plateau; 1877-78, Severtsof’s great expedition (accompanied by many specialists) over the Pamir to Rankul and the Alichur Pamir. Other Pamir districts were explored in 1878 by Oschanin, and later still by Ney Elias, Bon- valot, and Capus and others, resulting in a very complete knowledge of a highly interesting region. Important were Regel’s travels in the Kuldja region in 1877 and following- years. The surveys in connection with the Central Asian Railway were begun twelve years ago, and added greatly to our knowledge of Asia as far as Bokhara, while the completion of the railway has afforded facilities to travellers and explorers of all grades. The best known of recent Russian explorers in Asia is Pre- jevalsky. His great journeys were outside Asiatic Russia. In 1870 lie passed through Mongolia to the country around Koko Nor in North Tibet. In 1876 he led an expedition by Kuldja and the Ili Valley to the Tarim river, and thence to Lake Lob Nor, trying in vain to penetrate to Lassa by the Altyn Tag. In 1879 he led another expedition across the Chinese border at Zaisan, pushed through Saidan into Tibet, but was stopped 160 miles from Lassa. He visited the Koko Nor and explored the source of the Hoang-ho. In 1880 he once more traversed the Gobi desert to the source of the Hoang-ho, and again tried in vain to enter Tibet. On his return journey he made many important contributions to a knowledge of the Kuenlun Mountains and their offshoots. More recent expeditions to Central Asia have been those of the brothers Gruni-Grjmailo (1889) to the Eastern Thian- siian; Peftsof (Prejevalsky’s successor), to the Mustag region, with journeys by members of his staff through the sand desert; Jadrinstef in Northern Mongolia; Bonvalot and Prince Henry of Orleans, south-east across Tibet to Burma and Tong King; they reached to within 100 miles of Lassa. Among important English expeditions to Central Asia should be mentioned that of Sliaw in 1868 across the Karakorum to Yarkand; that under Sir Douglas Forsyth in 1873 to Kashgar and Yarkand, when the southern part of the Pamir table-land was explored ; Trotter’s journeys from Kashgar to the Artysh district, and over the Pamir to Wakhan. In 1885 Carey journeyed through Chinese Turkestan, and along the northern frontier of Tibet, and in the following year Colonel Bell, and after him Youngkusband, made journeys across Central Asia to Kashmir. The English and the native explorers attached to the Indian Survey have pushed (the latter especially) right into the heart of Tibet, as well as into other dangerous regions beyond the Himalayas. Turning to Eastern Asia, we find Siebold pursuing his researches in Japan, 1823 and 1829. In 1844-46 Hue and Gobet pushed through China and Mongolia as far as Lassa. Both Roman Catholic and Moravian missions have done service to geography on the Tibetan frontier as well as in Ladak. Probably the most important contribution to the geography of China during the century has been the work of Baron von Richthofen, who (1867-72) traversed a large extent of the country. In 1862 Blakiston surveyed the Yang-tse-Kiang. In 1868 Ney Elias surveyed the now course of the Yellow River, and in 1872 made a journey through Western Mongolia. In 1877 Gill made his way overland from Hankow- to Batang on the border of Tibet. Still more important were the journeys of Baber, who, besides traversing the provinces of Yunnan and Se-chuen, made many corrections on the old Jesuit maps. A multitude of books of travel have been written about CniNA, but much remains to be done before w-e have an accurate knowledge of its geography. The opening up of Japan has also led to the visits of many travellers, one of the most instructive being Mrs Bishop (Miss Bird), and one of the most thorough and scientific being Professor Rein. But the very careful survey made by the Japanese themselves within the past few years has afforded the materials for an accurate topography. The most important contribution to the geography of India during the century has undoubtedly been the work of the Survey begun at the end of the previous century. The whole country is now accurately mapped, and a vast amount of information made available by the observations of the surveyors and of the explorers sent out to the border regions. Burma is being surveyed after a similar fashion, and has, like Siam and the neighbouring region of the peninsula, been visited by many travellers during the century The French in Tong King are opening up the country, while Siam is being surveyed. Wallace’s residence in the Malay Archipelago for many years formed a chief contribution to a knowledge of that region, while the Dutch have done much for the territories under their jurisdiction. Of travellers in New- Guinea there 4 INTRODUCTION. have been many during the latter part of the period especially. Among the more important are Miclucho Maclay, Beccari, Moresby, D’Albertis, Macfarlane, Lawes, Forbes, and Macgregor, the last having in 1890 ascended the Owen Stanley Range. The British and Germans are actively exploring their part of the island, but the great bulk of the interior is quite unknown. The leading territorial changes in Asia during the century have been as follows : — First as to India — The Carnatic was conquered by the British in 1800. Lord Lake’s campaigns, 1803-05, brought the North- western Provinces under British rule. The new Districts were amalgamated with those previously acquired from the Nawab Wazir of Oudii into the “ceded and conquered provinces.” This partition of Northern India remained till the Sikh wars of 1845 and 1848-49 gave us the Punjab. In South-eastern India Lord Wellesley’s (1798-1803) conquests constituted the Madras Presidency almost as at this date. In South- western India the Peshwa was reduced to a vassal of the Company. At the close of the last Maratha war in 1818, the dominions of the Peshwa were annexed to the Bombay Presidency, and the nucleus of the present Central Provinces was formed out of the territory rescued from the Pindaris. In 1834 Coorg (Kurg) was annexed. As a result of the first Sikh war of 1845, the Jalandar Doab, between the Sutlej and Ravi was annexed. Tranquebar and Serampur were purchased from Denmark in 1845. The eight years’ rule of Lord Dalhousie, 1848-56, was distinguished by the acquisition of the Punjab as a British Province, 29th March 1849, and by the annexation, 20th December 1852, of Pegu (British Burma) to the provinces of Arakan and Tenasserim acquired in 1826. In 1849 the State of Satara and in 1853 that of Jhansi both lapsed to the British Government. Under Lord Dalhousie the annexation of Oudh was also effected. 1858 dates the downfall of the East India Co. and the trans- ference of the administration of India from the Company to the Crown. Under Lord Lawrence’s rule the Bhutan Dwars was annexed in 1864. Under Lord Dufferin, who succeeded to the Viceroyalty in 1884, the authority of the Viceroy of India was by proclama- tion on the 1st January 1886 substituted for that of King Thebaw throughout Upper Burma. The only Portuguese possessions still remaining in India are Goa, Damau and Diu, all on the west coast. In the great French wars from 1793 to 1811 England wrested from Holland every one of her Colonies and at present the Dutch flags flies nowhere on the mainland of India. The only French possessions are now Pondicherry and 200 square miles round it. By the definitive treaty signed at Amiens, 27th March 1802, A F R At the beginning of the century Central Africa was virtually a blank from the Sahara to the confines of the Cape. During the first half of the century exploration was mostly devoted to the northern and broader section of the Continent. The African Association (founded 1788) was most active in this work ; in 1830 it merged into the Royal Geographical Society. In 1805 Mungo Park was murdered after traversing the Niger down to Bussa. In 1819 Oudney, Clapperton, and Denham crossed from Tripoli by Murzuk, and discovered Lake Tchad. In 1816-21 De Grey and Dochard reached Say, on the Niger, which in 1830 was traced from Bussa down Ceylon was ceded to Great Britain, and in 1815 England assumed the complete sovereignty of the island. In 1839 Great Britain annexed Aden, which has since been extended towards the interior. Perim was added soon after. The Bahrein Islands in the Persian Gulf were taken under British protection in 1875. Hong Kong was ceded by China to Great Britain in 1841. The Kuria Muria Islands were ceded by the Sultan of Muscat in 1854. Of the Straits Settlements, Malacca was ceded by the Dutch to Great Britain in 1824, and in 1826 incorporated with Penang and Singapore. Protectorates were declared over Perak and Selangor in 1874; Sungei Ujono, 1885; the Negri Sembilan, 1889; Pahang, 1887; Johore, 1887. Cyprus was occupied by Great Britain in 1878. Other important annexations have been made by France in Asia during the century. Cambodia was taken under French protection in 1862; Cochin-China annexed 1861, Tong King 1884 ; Annam declared a protectorate in the same year. The advances of Russia in Asia during the present century have been of an extensive character. By the incorporation of Georgia in 1802 Russia obtained an outlying territory south of the Caucasus on the upper course of the Kur. Next, 1813, Russia acquired the land of Daghestan and Shirwan on the Caspian Coast from the mouth of the Terek to the mouth of the Kur. The Persian and Turkish wars gave Russia, 1 828 — 29, the Armenian land of Erivan as far as the Araxes, Mingrelia and Imeritia. By treaty of Adrian ople, 14th September 1829, Turkey surrendered Circassia to Russia; the Berlin Treaty, 1878, has since added to Transcaucasian Russia, Ardahan, Batum and Kars, Batum being declared a free port. To the east of the Caspian a new province, Turkestan, was created, 14th February 1805. To the south-east followed the subdual of Khokand which was formally annexed to Russia as Ferghana, February 1876. Samarkand was taken by Kaufmann and secured by Treat}', November 1868. On the pretext that the Khivans had aided the rebellious Kirghiz, a Russian expedition advancing to Khiva compelled the Khan to sign a treaty putting the Khanate under Russian control. In 1873 the state of Bokhara was by treaty made practically a Russian dependency. The Turkoman tribes east of the Caspian have been annexed. In 1881 Russia captured Gok Tepe; in 1884 Merv surrendered to Russia and the same year she concluded a con- vention with Persia for the cession of Sarakhs. In 1885 Komaroff attacked the Afghans at Aktapa near Panj deii, after which the present Afghan boundary was settled between the British and Russian Governments. A Russian Transcaspian railway now runs through Bokhara from Chargui on the Oxus to a station within a few miles of the capital and thence to Samarkand ; the distance from Chargui to the Russian frontier station of Kata Kurghan being about 186 miles. Samarkand is also connected by a telegraph line with Bokhara. Kuldja, a revolted province of China, was seized by Russia in 1871 but restored by treaty in 1879. I C A. to its mouths by R. Lander. In 1825-26 Laing reached Timbuktoo from Tripoli. Richardson, who had already explored the Northern Sahara, led a great expedition (1849) lasting 5|- years, which, crossing the Sahara, explored the whole of the Lake Tchad region, the neighbouring Soudan States and the Niger. Richardson died, and the command devolved on Barth, his great work being the most important contribution to a knowdedge of this region. This was supple- mented by the explorations of Rohlfs (1864-6) by Ghadames, Murzuk, Wadai to the Niger, and on to the Guinea Coast. More important was the expedition of Nachtigal (1869 et INTRODUCTION. seq.) by Tibesti by Kuka round Lake Tchad, and into the Central Soudan States. All this work was supplemented by expeditions from the south. In 1832 Laird and Oldfield explored the Niger and Benue. In 1854 and following years Baikie did a vast deal for the exploration of the lower and middle Niger and the Benue and for the establishment of British influence from Lokoja as a centre. In 1879 Ashcroft ascended the Benue beyond Yola; in 1885 Joseph Thomson ascended the Niger to Sokoto, Flegel having done much for a knowledge of the river in the preceding years; in 1889 Major MacDonald ascended the Kibbe, a remote tributary of the Benue, while the officials of the ltoyal Niger Company have done much for t he geography of the region. From the Senegal side the French have been actively pushing their way inland since the beginning of the century, their expeditions ranging from the Senegal on the North to the Guinea Coast on the South, and as far as the Upper Niger on the East. In 1827-8, Rene Caillie journeyed from Ivakandy to Timbuktoo and thence to Marocco; while in 1880 Lenz repeated the journey in the opposite direction. Mage and St. Quintin in 1863-66 explored the Niger from Sansandig to Segu ; in 1878 Soleillet reached Segu on the Niger and has been followed by Gallieni, Desbordes, and others. The sources of the Niger were discovered in 1879 by Moustier and Zweifel. Ill 1887 Caron navigated the river in a gunboat from Bammako to the port of Timbuktoo. In 1887-89 Binger traversed a large part of the region between the coast and the great bend of the Niger. From the Guinea Coast much has been done for the interior countries by British explorers, two prominent names being those of Burton and Winwood Reade. On the other side, in Marocco we have Jackson in the early part of the century, Hooker and Ball, 1871, Colville, Foucauld, 1883-7, Joseph Thomson, 1889. The occupation of Algeria and Tunis by France lias led to a thorough exploration of those countries and the Northern Sahara by many French expeditions. Of the multitude of expeditions in the great Nile region we can only refer to a few. In the early years of this century travellers reached as far south as Darfur and even Wadai, while in 1805-9 Salt visited Abyssinia. The efforts to extend Egyptian domination southwards led to many important expeditions. Khartoum was founded in 1823 and became a centre for further enterprise. In 1853-58 Petherick penetrated to the Niam-Niam country on the west and Gondokoro on the south. The expeditions which in the fifties and sixties explored the Blue and White Niles and the Bahr- Ghazal are too numerous to detail ; when Sir S. Baker went out in 1863-4 exploration had been pushed to within measur- able distance of the Nile sources. Baker completed his work by discovering the Albert Nyanza. From the east coast it was only when the missionaries Krapf, Rebmann, and Erhardt, entered on their travels in 1846, that serious exploration began. In 1848 Rebmann discovered Kilima Njaro and saw Kenia afar off. Rumours of great lakes and mountains in Central Africa had been coming out for some years. Burton and Speke had already been together in Somali Land (1854) when the former succeeded in visiting Harar. In 1857-8 Burton and Speke forced their way into the heart of Africa, and discovered the first of the rumoured great lakes, Tanganyika. On the return journey Speke discovered Victoria Nyanza, the great reservoir of the Nile. In 1860 Speke and Grant pushed northward from Zanzibar to Victoria Nyanza, and discovered the outlet of the Nile, following the river to Khartoum and meeting Baker by the way. Thus the Nile problem was solved in its main features. Since then the filling- in of details has been vigorously prosecuted. In 1868 Schweinfurth made his way through the Djur country on the Upper Nile into the Niam-Niam and Monbuttu countries, coming upon the mysterious Wellis in 3° 35' N. lat., since proved by Junker, Grenfell, Van Gele, and others to be the Mobangi tributary of the Congo. Once more in 1869 Baker penetrated to the Lake regions; while Gordon and his successors, men like Gessi, Marno, Chaille Long, Mason, Emin Pasha, Casati, Prout, and others have completely explored the Upper Nile region and the Albert Nyanza. Junker during his many years’ stay in that country added largely to the information collected by Schweinfurth. In Abyssinia Salt was followed by Ruppell (1833), the D’Abbadies (1837 et seq.), Beke (1841-3), Von Heuglin (1852), the English expedition of 1867-8; Antinori and Beccari (1870 et seq.), Piaggia (1871), Bianchi (1879), and many other Italians, who have penetrated into Abyssinia and accumulated a mass of valuable information concerning an interesting country. In the region south of Abyssinia and north of Kilima Njaro, many expeditions have been busy. Von der Decken in 1861-2 explored the Kilima Njaro region and ascended the Juba river ; in 1865 Wakefield opened up much new country, ascending Kilima Njaro to the snowline ; Stanley in his great expedition across the Continent (1874-77) traced the southern feeders of the Victoria Nyanza, circumnavigated the lake, explored Uganda, and discovered the southern lake Albert, which he further explored during the Emin Pasha Relief expedition (1887-89), when he discovered Mount Ruwenzori. Since Stanley’s visit to Uganda a host of missionaries have invaded the country, making it still further known. In 1883-4, Joseph Thomson explored Masai Land, as did Fischer about the same time ; H. H. Johnston visited Kilima Njaro in 1884, and Meyer ascended to the summit, 1890. The expeditions of the British East Africa Company have greatly increased our knowledge of the country. Farther north James penetrated from Berbera 500 miles south into the Somali country and De Besme still farther in 1890. Paulitschke visited Harar, 1888 ; Teleki penetrated from the south to Lake Samburu (Rudolf) 300 miles N.E. of Victoria Nyanza; 1885-8 Borelli from Obok passed by Ankober, Antotto, and Harar through Galla Land, following the river Omo which feeds Lake Samburu. The only serious attempt on the part of the Portuguese to penetrate the Continent in the early part of the century was the expedition of Monteiro and GamittO from Tete on the Zambesi north-west as far as Lunda to the capital of the Kazembe on Lake Moero. On the other side Tuckey explored the Congo as far as the Yellala Falls in 1816. Bowdich in 1817 contributed to a know-ledge of the Gabun and the Ogowe. After the French settlement on the Gabun, activity in this region increased. Du Chaillu in 1850 and 1863 made his famous discoveries in the region watered by the Ogowe, followed by Winwood Reade and Burton in 1861-3. In 1860-2 Burton explored the Cameroons. Under Compiegne and Marche (1873-4) but above all De Brazza (1876 to the present time) the whole of the Ogow-e and Gabun region down to the Middle and Lower Congo, has been very com- pletely explored. In the present year an expedition under Crampel pushing from the Congo to Lake Tchad, has been massacred. Since the German occupation of the Cameroons in 1881, several expeditions have made their way into the interior filling up to some extent the great blank which existed there. Farther south Graca in 1843-4, from Loanda reached the Muata Yamvo’s Kingdom and Lake Moero, while between 1848 and 1855 Ladislaus Magyar traversed the region between the Lower Congo and Upper Zambesi, exploring the extensive country watered by the Kwanza. Since then the route to Bihe, Lunda, and Lake Moero has been frequently traversed among others by the Germans Bastian, Pogge, and others, Capello and Ivens, 1877-80, Serpa Pinto at the same date, when he crossed the Continent by the Zambesi, and the Transvaal to Natal, a Portuguese expedition in 1883-8, not to mention many missionaries and traders. Farther south must be noted Galton’s expedition to Damaraland, 1850-51 ; Andersson in Damaraland, Nama- quai.and, and on to Lake Ngami, 1853-54, follov-ed in the G INTRODUCTION. same region in 1854-66 by Costa Real, Smut, Green, and others. Coates Palgrave traversed Damaraland and Namaqualand in 1877, an ' since the Germans took possession, their missionaries and trailers have added somewhat to our knowledge. In 1840 Livingstone landed at the Cape. Before that date various explorers, missionaries, and traders had pushed the limits of the known beyond the Orange River to Southern Bechuanaland and the borders of the Matabele Country — such as Barrow, 1810-14; the missionaries, Campbell, Steedman, Andrew Smith, Moffat; the hunters, Harris (1835) and Gordon Gumming (1845). In 1849 Living- stone discovered Lake Ngami. A year later he reached the Zambesi. In 1852 he set out on his great journey ; reached Linyanti in May 1853, Loanda May 1854; returned across the Continent, following the Zambesi to the Victoria Falls (November 1855), reaching Quilimane in May 1856. Two years later Livingstone returned to Africa in command of the great Zambesi expedition, during which he explored the Lower Zambesi, the River Snmri, re discovered and laid down with accuracy Lake Nyassa, explored the Rovuma, and added much to our knowledge of the region around. He returned to England in 1864. All this work of Livingstone has had important results. On the south of the Zambesi his footsteps were followed by explorers, missionaries, and traders too nume- rous to refer to individually. Baines’s explorations in Matabele Land in 1869, and Mohr’s at the same time, led ultimately to the gold-rush to that country, and to the hunting expeditions of Selous, who during the last twenty years has done so much for the Zambesi region. Erskine explored the Limpopo in 1 868, and the work of Paiva d’Andrade in the Manica territory during the past fifteen years must be acknow- ledged. The officials of the British South Africa Company have during the two years they have been at work added largely to our knowledge of the country, as did Sir Charles Warren’s expedition in 1885 of Bechuanaland. On the north of the Zambesi Livingstone was followed by missionaries and traders, who opened up the country round Lake Nyassa and between that lake and Tanganyika. Livingstone once more left for Africa in 1865. Landing at the Rovuma, he crossed to Lake Nitassa and thence to Tan- ganyika. During these his last journeys he explored the Lualaba, Lakes Bangweolo and Moero, which form the upper waters of the Congo ; saw the Lualaba again two miles wide at Nyangwe, extended our knowledge to Tanganyika, visited Manyuema, and reached the solution of some of the most important problems in African hydrography before his death in 1873. Meantime Central Africa was crowded with a host of explorers. In 1871 Livingstone was succoured by H. M. Stanley, and together they explored the north of Tangan- yika. Among the other relief expeditions sent out the most important was that under Cameron, who (1873-5) crossed the continent from Zanzibar to Benguela, adding greatly to our knowledge of the country to the west and south-west of Tanganyika. Meantime (1874-77) Stanley was once more in Africa on the great expedition already referred to. From the Albert Ny^anza he came south to Ujiji on Lake Tangan- yika, which he circumnavigated. Crossing from Ujiji to Nyangwe on the Lualaba, he left that place on November 5, 1876, traced the river through its whole course and identified it with the Congo, at the mouth of which he arrived in August 1877. Stanley’s discoveries may be said to have led to the partition of Africa. Shortly after he arrived in Europe he returned to Africa to found the Congo Free State. Since then the river itself has been further explored, its enor- mous tributaries north and south have been navigated, and the blank of fifteen years ago largely wiped out. The German African Association, founded 1873, helped in this work, as several of its explorers did good work to the south of the Congo, as well as on the coast region to the north. Stanley supplemented his own work by penetrating, in pursuit of Emin Pasha (1887-89), the forests on the Aruwimi-Ituri to Lake Albert Nyanza, and making the discoveries already referred to. Joseph Thomson’s expedition (1879-80) did much for our knowledge of the mountainous region on the north shore of Lake Nyassa, as well as for the country between that and Tanganyika, and Urua and other countries on the west of that lake. A few years later Reichard explored the Upper Lualaba, and Wissmann crossed the continent twice from the west coast, passing many of the southern tributaries of the Congo before reaching Nyangwe. Since Germany began her annexations in 1884, she has shown increased activity in exploration in East and West Africa. In Usambara and other districts lying to the south of the British spheres, much care- ful work has been done; while under Kund, Tappenbeck, Wolf, and others, exploration has been pushed far into the Cameroons interior It has only been possible to refer to some of the more important expeditions; the result has been to fill up the great blank which existed at the beginning of the century from the confines of the Cape to the Sahara. But it has been covered merely by a network of routes ; much remains to be done to fill up the meshes, and one great blank still exists between the Congo and Lake Tchad, which no doubt will be to some extent obliterated within a few years. But the great features of the continent are now well known. As to the political partition of the continent, that may be very briefly told. At the beginning of the century Turkey was dominant over Egypt, Tripoli, and Tunis ; Algeria was practically independent, and Marocco much as it is now. The Imams of Muscat were lords of Zanzibar and much of the coast north and south. Portugal had her possessions on the west, and a precarious footing on the east, her actual power being confined to her towns on the coast. She had also the Cape Verds, a patch on the Guinea coast, Prince’s and St. Thomas’ Islands. In Senegambia the dominion of France did not stretch much beyond the coast, except along the Senegal. Spain held Fernando Po and one or two patches on the opposite coast. British South Africa was confined to Cape Colony, which did not extend beyond the Orange River on the west and the great Fish River on the east. The Colonies of Gambia, Sierra Leone, and the Gold Coast were the only other British possessions. Early in the century Egypt began to push southwards. Nubia and part of the Soudan were anuexed in 1820. Shortly after, Khartoum was founded and further annexations carried out. Under Baker and Gordon, the Egyptian domain was extended to the Albert Nyanza, and included Kordofan and Darfur. The whole country south of Wady Halfa was prac- tically abandoned in 1885 as a result of the revolt of tlm Malidi. Algeria was annexed by France in 1830 and Tunis in 1881. In Senegal France continued to push her conquests into the interior as well as north and south. This resulted in the creation in 1890 of a new province, Rivieres du Sud, to the south of Senegal proper. By the Anglo-French arrangement of August 5, 1890, Great Britain recognises as within the French sphere the whole region to the south of Tunis and Algeria up to a line from Say on the Niger to Barruwa on Lake Tchad. Out of this Spain claims a region extending from Cape Blanco to the confines of Marocco, of about 250.000 square miles. France took possession of the Gabun in 1843. By the Berlin Agreement of 1884, French territory now extends along the right bank of the Congo from Brazza- ville to the mouth of the Mobangi ; north to 4 degrees N. latitude ; and an almost straight line to the coast along the 2nd degree N. embraces the Gabun — total area, 250,000 square miles. Since 1884 France has had possession of territory on the west and east of the British Gold Coast Colony — Grand Bassam and Assinie, Grand Popo and Agoue, Porto Novo and Kotonou — 25.000 square miles in all, with protectorates, divided into two colonies, the Gold Coast group and Bight of Benin group. In INTRODUCTION. 1891 she declared the stretch of coast (100 miles) lying between Grand Bassam and Liberia within her protection. On the other side the island of Nossi-Bk was annexed in 1841, Mayotte 1843 ; the Comoro Islands declared a protectorate 1886, Madagascar 1887. Obock, at the month of the Red Sea, was annexed in 1864, but has since been extended, and covers an area of 2500 square miles. The total possessions and protecto- rates of France in Africa cover 2,750,000 square miles. Except a few administrative changes the principal event in British West African Colonies has been the acquisition of Lagos in 1861, and its gradual extension so as to include the Yoruba country ; it extends from the Benin River to Kotonou. The Gold Coast protectorate has been extended so as to embrace 46,000 square miles. The Royal Niger Company obtained its charter in 1886, and the Oil Rivers were formed into a commis- sionership in 1891 ; the total British territory along the Niger and Benue embraces 500,000 square miles, including Sokoto and its dependencies. The precise limits on the south are not yet defined. Between 1803 and 1806 the Cape Colony reverted to Holland, but became British again in the latter year, and was finally conferred on England by the Peace of 1815. Ivaffraria was formally incorporated in 1865. Basutoland became British in 1868, and was annexed to the Cape in 1871, but has since come under direct imperial rule. The Transkeian territories were annexed in 1877 and 1885; Walfiscii Bay in 1877 ; and Griqu aland West in 1880. Natal was formally annexed to the British Crown in 1843 and declared a separate colony in 1856. The territory known as Bechuanaland lying between Cape Colony on the south and 22° S. lat. on the north was declared a British protectorate in March 1885 ; on September 30, the portion to the south of the Molopo river was made a Crown colony (43,000 square miles). An order in Council of July 4, 1890, places the parts of South Africa north of British Bechuanaland, west of the Transvaal and Mata- beleland, east of the German protectorate, and south of the Zambesi, under the government of British Bechuanaland. Matabeleland was declared to be within the British sphere in 1888 and in 1889 a charter was granted to the British South Africa Company. On the east the sphere is limited by the Manica plateau, on the south by the Limpopo, on the north by the Zambesi and a line running E.S.E. from Zumbo to the Mazoe ; area about 100,000 square miles. By the Anglo- Portuguese arrangement of June 11, 1891, on the north of the Zambesi, England has a patch on the east of the Shire, north of the Ruo. With the exception of a patch between the Shire, the Loangwa and the Zambesi, British territory extends from Lake Nyassa to the boundary of the Congo Free State and the western limit of the Barotse country on the west, the Zambesi on the south, and the line between Lakes Tanganyika and Nyassa on the north. In 1888 a charter was granted to the British East Africa Company. By the Anglo-German agreement of 1884 and 1890 the British sphere is bordered on the south by a line from the mouth of the Umba north-west to the cast shore of Victoria Nyanza. It extends north to the Juba river and along that to the limits of the Italian sphere in Galla Land ; westward to the borders of the Congo Free State and the watershed of the upper Nile. In 1890 Great Britain acquired the pro- tectorate of the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. In 1887 England proclaimed a protectorate over the Somali coast from Tajurah Bay to 49° E. long. Since 1883 Egypt has practically been under English control. The total area of British Africa amounts to about 2^ million square miles. In 1884 Germany acquired a footing on the Gold Coast, on the coast of Namaqualand, and the Cameroons. Togoland now extends to 16,000 square miles. The Cameroons extends from the Niger territories on the north to the French Gabun on the south, and inland to 15° E. ; area about 130,000 square miles. By arrangement between Germany and England (1884— 90) German S.W. Africa extends from the Cunene to the Orange River and inland to 20° E. as far as 22° S. ; thence to 21° E. as far as the Chobe and Zambesi; area 342,000 square miles. In 1885 Germany obtained a footing in East Af’rica and by arrangements of 1886 and 1890, her sphere extends between the British sphere on the north, the Rovuma and the line between Lake Nyassa and Tanganyika on the south, Lake Tanganyika and the Congo Free State on the west and the Indian Ocean on the east ; area 345,000 square miles. Total German Africa, 830,000 square miles. Italy took possession of Assab Bay at the mouth of the Red Sea in 1880. Since then her claims have extended along the coast from 18° 2' N. to 12° 30' N., including Massowah and its territory. In 1889 territory was acquired on the east Somali coast, north of the Juba and south of Ras Hafun. By conven- tions of 1889-90, Italy claims the protectorate of Abyssinia and Shoa, and by an Anglo-Italian arrangement of 1891 her African sphere extends along the north bank of the Juba and thence round by the southern boundary of Shoa and the boundary between Abyssinia and the former Egyptian Soudan. Total area 315,000 square miles. The Congo Free State was constituted as a result of the Berlin Congress of 1884-5, under Leopold King of the Belgians as Sovereign. Its area is about 900,000 square miles. The republic of Liberia was founded in 1847 and ten years later was joined by the neighbouring Negro republic of Mary- land (founded in 1854). The Portuguese possessions in East and West Africa have been restricted by the various agreements referred to. Such are the leading territorial changes, so far as European powers are concerned, in Africa, during the present century. AMERICA. In North America the admirably organised Government Surveys of the United States and Canada have done so much during the century for an accurate knowledge of the Continent that the work of early exploring expeditions has been to a large extent superseded. A large area of the Canadian Dominion has in this way been surveyed and mapped, and the work is being rapidly completed. In the neighbouring republic there is not only a great Federal Survey as well as a Coast Survey, but most of the States carry out Surveys of their own. The work of the Federal Survey has been mainly west of the Mississippi, and concerning that extensive region a vast amount of information has been accumulated. It may be of interest however, briefly to refer to some of the leading expeditions that have added to our knowledge of North and Central America. The first great expedition of the century was that of Alexander von Humboldt who in 1803 on 'his return from South America traversed Mexico from west to east. In recent times the government geographer Garcia Cubas has produced excellent maps of the country accompanied by memoirs dealing with its geography. In 1804-6 Lewis and Clarke explored the Upper Missouri basin and the Columbia River. In 1819— 20 Long undertook the first scientific exploration of the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi valley, and in 1825 the region south of the great lakes and round Lake Winnipeg. In 1819 Franklin explored the Coppermine River, with Richardson and Back and in 1825 descended the Mackenzie and explored the north coast east and west. In 1820 Schoolcraft and in 1823 Beltrame explored the northern United States and the sources of the Mississippi. Between 1830 and 1840 Catlin visited nearly all the Indian tribes. In 1833-35 Back explored the plains of the Great Fish River, and about the same time Dease and Simpson surveyed an unknown part of the Northern Coast. Rae (1846 i and following years) explored the N.E. coast as also the 8 INTRODUCTION. Mackenzie and Coppermine Rivers. In 1857-8 Palliser explored large tracts of British North America, and determined the existence of practicable passes across the Rocky Mountains within British territory, a discovery of great importance in connection with the Trans-Canadian railway. The Surveys for tho railway, as also for those which cross the United States have added very largely to our knowledge of the geography of those countries. I n 1 8G2 Lord Milton and Cheadle opened up extensive new regions on the Red River. Petitot (a missionary) in 1862-71 traversed and mapped the whole of the Mackenzie region. In 1865 Dali explored the Alaska coast and has been followed by various expeditions (three in 1890-91) which have traced the Yukon, surveyed the shores and islands and attempted to ascend Mount St. Elias, which was ascended by Topham for 11,000 feet and (1891) Russell to 1-1,000 feet. Among travellers in Central America may be mentioned Moritz Wagner and Scherzer (1853-55), Brenchley and Remy (1855 et seq.), Kohl (1856-58), Dolfiis (1861-66), See- bach (1863), Seemann (1864), Gabb (Costa Rica 1873-76), Stoll (Guatemala 1878-83). The surveys for the Panama and Nicaragua Canals have contributed to the geography of Central America, large areas of which arc however still unexplored. In Soura America the Argentine Government has been laudably active in exploring and roughly surveying its extensive territory ; though this survey-work is of a preliminary character, and not to be compared to that of the United States, still on the whole the country is fairly mapped. Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Peru, which have considerable railway systems, have in connection with them carried out a certain extent of survey work, but a very considerable area of South America still remains unexplored. In the early part of the century Humboldt and Bonpland travelled over and investigated the geography and natural history of a large area of equatorial South America, Venezuela, the Orinoco, Grenada, Ecuador. In 1810 et seq. Eschwege crossed Brazil several times, and in 1815-17 Prince Max von Neuwied explored the coast regions. Immediately after, Spix and Martius, with several other specialists carried out extensive explorations in the region of the Amazons and Rio Negro. In 1816-20 St. Hilaire explored South Brazil, and in 1826-33 D’Orbigny and Poppig’s extensive travels did much for a knowledge of the geography and natural history of Brazil, Paraguay, North Patagonia, Chile, and Peru — Poppig, as also Pentland (1826), exploring a considerable section of the Andes. Pent- land also spent some time in Bolivia, while about the same time King and Fitzroy were surveying Patagonia and the west coast of Chile. Between 1830 and 1850 much exploring work was done in S. America. In 1833 Darwin was wandering in Patagonia and the Rio Negro; in 1834-36 Smith and Lowe were in the Andes and followed the Ucayli, Maranon, and Amazon down to the ocean. In 1838-43 Tscudi explored Peru, and again in 1857-9 Brazil, the La Plata States, Chile, Bolivia, and Peru; Seemann, in 1848, Peru and Ecuador; in 1849 Von Bibra, Chile and Brazil, the latter having been traversed in various directions in 1842 et seq. by Prince Adalbert of Prussia. In 1843-7 the great French expedition under Castelnau made extensive explorations in Brazil and Paraguay, crossed the Andes to Peru and Bolivia, and followed the Amazon down from near its sources to the Pacific. In 1835 and following years Schomburgk made a very thorough exploration of Guiana; followed between 1849 and 1868 by Appun, and later in British Guiana by Brown, Im Thurn, and others, and in French Guiana by Crevaux and Coudreau. In 1850 and following years Burmeister travelled in the central provinces of Brazil and also the Argentine Republic. In 1853-6 Page explored the La Plata and Paraguay. In 1852-54 and 1861 Markham did good work in Peru, and we are indebted for much of our knowledge of Chile to Filippi whose activity extended from 1853 down to quite recent years. From 1848 to 1859 Bates was busy in the Amazon region. In 1862-69 Chandless actively explored the northern tributaries of the Amazon, and in 1865 Agassiz visited a large area of Brazil, his work being continued by Hart. Raimondi did much for the geography of Peru and Bolivia between 1850 and 1866. Excellent work was done by Reiss and Stlibel ill 1868-76 in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. They ascended Cotopaxi. Various other travellers explored the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador in the seventies and eighties. Those of Ecuador were explored by Whymper ill 1879-80; he ascended Chimborazo twice, and also scaled some of the other high Andean peaks. In 1869 Musters explored Patagonia. In the last ten years the Argentine and Chile have been active in exploring both Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Im Thurn ascended Roraima in British Guiana in 1884. Simons resided for several years in Colombia in the eighties, made several careful surveys, as did R. B. White. Before this Simson crossed the Andes from Guayaquil, exploring some unknown regions on their eastern slopes. Wells spent most of the years 1868-84 in Brazil surveying and exploring from Rio Janeiro in the south to Maranham in the north. More recently (1886 et seq.) the brothers Von Steinen have explored the Xingu and its tributaries. The Challenger ir 1876 and the Alert in 1878-82, as also the French Expedition of 1883-84 did much for Tierra del Fuego and the Straits ol Magellan. The following are the principal territorial changes in Canada during the century. In the beginning of the century the Dominion consisted of Upper and Lower Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. They were united by Act of Parliament in 1867, which made provision for the admission of British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, the North-west Territories and Newfoundland. Newfoundland has still kept aloof. In 1869 the North-west Territories were purchased from the Hudson’s Bay Company; out of this the province of Manitoba was formed and admitted into the Dominion 1870; followed in 1871 by British Columbia and in 1873 by Prince Edward Island. A portion of the Northavest Territories was in 1882 divided into four districts, — Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Athabasca. In the United States, — Ohio, extensively settled in 1788, was admitted into the Union in 1802. Louisiana, restored to France in 1801, was purchased from Napoleon in 1803. Indiana, included in Ohio till 1801, was constituted a territory in 1809 and admitted into the Union in 1816. Mississippi, settled in 1716, was incorporated as a State in 1817. Illinois, acquired by the British 1763, was constituted a territory in 1809 and admitted as a State 1818. Alabama, originally part of Georgia, was organised into a State in 1819. Maine became a State of the Union in 1820. The boundary line between the British and the United States territories was settled by the Ashburton treaty, 9th August, 1842. On the 31st October 1803 tho U.S. Congress by an Act authorised the President to take possession of Louisiana which included the present territory of Missouri. In 1804 Congress divided the territory into two portions. The northern part, Upper Louisiana, was taken possession of in March 1804. In June 1812 Missouri was organised as a territory and admitted to the Union 1820. Arkansas, purchased from France in 1803, was established as a separate non-Indian territory in 1819 and received into the LTnion 1836. Government surveyors appointed to inspect the lands of Michigan with a view to their settlement by the soldiers of the war of 1812 reported unfavour- ably, and largely for this reason Michigan was left behind and not admitted into the Union till 1837. Florida, ceded by Spain to the United States in 1820, was admitted as a State in 1845. Texas revolted from Mexico 1835, was acknowledged an independent State 1840, admitted into the Union 1846, seceded 1861, submitted 1865, and re-admitted to State rights 1870. Iowa, organised as a territory 1838, was admitted into the Union 1846. Wisconsin, organised as a territory in 1836, was admitted into the Union 1848. California, which came under the power of Mexico in 1823, became virtually inde- INTRODUCTION. 0 pendent 1836, was occupied by the (J.S. army 1846, ceded to the United States 1848 and made a Sovereign State 1850. Minnesota, first largely explored 1817 and 1823 by Major S. H. Long1, was organised as a territory 1849 and admitted into the Union 1857. New Mexico was taken from Mexico in 1846 and organised as a territory in 1850. In 1863 Arizona was detached and made a separate territory. Part of New Mexico was added to Colorado in 1867. A dispute arising in 1845 between Britain and the United States respecting the mutual boundary of Oregon was settled by treaty in 1846, and Oregon was admitted as a State in 1859. Kansas, included in the immense tract of land purchased by the United States from Napoleon ill 1803, was in the hands of various Indian tribes down to 1854 when it was organised as a territory. It was admitted into the Union 1861, when Eastern Virginia seceded from the Union 1861, Western Virginia declared for the Union, and was admitted as a separate State 1861. The first settlement in Nevada was made in 1850. In 1861 it was organised as a territory and in 1864 admitted as a State. The first settlement by whites in Nebraska was made in 1847. It constituted a portion of the immense “ Louisiana ” territory purchased from France in 1803. It was organised as a terri- tory in 1854 and admitted a State 1867. Colorado was organised as a territory in 1861 and proclaimed a State 1876. Dakota was divided into North and South Dakota and created into two States in 1890, when Washington territory was also admitted as a State; Idaho, Wyoming and Montana AUSTRALIA AND The exploration of the coast of Australia was completed by King in 1817-24, and by the Beagle in 1837-43; since then special surveys of part of the coast have been carried out by Her Majesty’s ships. The exploration of the interior was begun immediately after the founding of Botany Bay in 1788. The officers of the colony pushed their way inwards, so that by 1840 the Murray, the Darling, the Murumbidgee, and other rivers had been traced and the country explored far beyond the Blue Mountains. Eyre discovered Lake Torrens in 1839. West Australia was founded in 1829, and during the next 15 years the coast regions were explored north and south and efforts made to push into the interior. In 1841 Eyre made his famous journey from Adelaide to King George’s Sound. In 1844 Sturt attempted to cross the continent from Ade- laide to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and penetrated to within 200 miles of the centre of the continent. In 1856 Gregory explored the Victoria river in the north, and the east side of the Gulf of Carpentaria. In 1860 M'Bouall Stuart crossed to within 245 miles of the northern shore. The ill-fated Burke and Wills did succeed in crossing, but perished on the return journey. In 1862 M'Douall Stuart also suc- ceeded in crossing along the line on which the telegraph was laid down in 1872. M'Kinlay afterwards crossed the conti- nent twice. In 1873 Warburton crossed from the telegraph line to the west coast. The brothers Forrest made several expeditions from Perth, discovering much new country in West Australia; and in 1874 John Forrest crossed from Perth to the telegraph line and Adelaide. In 1872 and subsequent years Giles, Gosse, and others starting from the telegraph line and Adelaide penetrated westwards to the south of the routes of Forrest and Warburton, while other expe- ditions explored north Queensland and the York Peninsula. having been admitted as States in 1889. The district of Okla- homa was made a territory in 1890. When the century began Mexico, and Central America, and the whole of South America except Brazil, was under the domination of Spain ; Brazil being subject to Portugal. Paraguay declared independence 1811. Brazil became an independent kingdom 1815, an empire 1822, a republic 1889. Chile became independent 1818; Mexico 1821; Guatemala, which included the other Central American States, 1823 ; Bolivia declared its independence of Peru 1824, assumed the name of Bolivia in 1825; lost her coast territory to Chile, 1880. The Spaniards were expelled from Peru in 1826 ; in 1880 she lost the provinces of Tarapaca and Tacna to Chile. The Argentine Republic became independent in 1816, and Uruguay' seceded as an independent State from the La Plata Confederation in 1826. By treaty between the Argentine Republic and Chile in 1881 the latter recognised the right of the former to all Patagonia east of the crest of the Andes, including the eastern part of Tierra del Fuego. In 1839 the various Central American republics declared their independence of each other. The Republic of Colombia (formed of Venezuela, Ecuador and New Granada) declared its independence in 1819, separating in 1831 into the three seats just named, New Granada in 1863 assuming the name of Colombia. In 1814 England obtained possession from the Dutch of Essequibo, Berbice, and Demerara, now known as British Guiana. NEW ZEALAND. Between 1864 and 1878 several expeditions under Forrest and others explored the north-west of Australia, discovering extensive grass lands and gold fields. During the past ten years several expeditions have been out every year, so that about one-third of the continent is well known, while a fair idea has been obtained of the general features of the remainder. A great expedition has been sent out by Sir Thomas Elder this year which will fill up many gaps. The exploration of New Zealand has been mainly carried out by the well organised survey under Sir James Hector and the late Sir Julius von Haast. Through the efforts of the survey the country has been to a large extent mapped. The coasts of New Zealand and the surrounding regions were fully surveyed by Captains Stokes and Byrn-Drury between 1848 and 1858. In 1825 Moreton Bay was settled as a part of New South Wales, and in 1859 became the Colony of Queensland. The Colony of Western Australia xvas founded in 1829. Port Philip xvas colonised in 1835, and in 1851 was constituted the Colony of Victoria. The colonisation of South Australia xvas begun in 1836. In 1840 New Zealand was formally ceded to the British Crown, and remained attached to New South Wales till the following year. The colony was originally divided into eight provinces, but by an Act of 1876, the county system was adopted. In 1848 the Dutch proclaimed their sovereignty over the western half of New Guinea. In 1884 the eastern half xvas divided between Great Britain and Gerxiany, the sovereignty of the Queen being proclaimed over the British section in 1888. THE OCEANS. Many great expeditions sent out by England, France, Ger- many, and America, have explored the islands of the Pacific during the century, xvhile numerous private explorers have done good xvork. We can only give a list of the leading expe- ditions. In 1804 Krusenstern explored the Marquesas ; and B in 1814 and following years Kotzebue visited the Marshall group. In 1818 Freycinet visited New Guinea, the La- drones and the Hawaiian Islands; in 1819 et seq. Bellings- hausen surveyed the Paumotu group; in 1823 Duperrey xvas among the Society' Islands, the Marshall and Gilbert 10 INTRODUCTION. Islands, and visited New Guinea. In 1825 Dumont D’Urville was in New Britain, New Guinea, Manikoro, and the Ladrones, and in 1838 several other island groups. Beechey in 1826 discovered the Bonin Islands, and in 1828 et seq. Lutke visited the Carolines. In 1835 et seq. Fitzroy (with Darwin) visited the Society Islands. The great American expedition under Wilkes in 1839 and follow- ing years explored most of the Pacific Ocean. Other expe- ditions which contributed to a knowledge of the various groups were those of Belcher 1840, Blackwood 1845, Brenchley and Kemp 1850, Erskine 1849 et seq. Denham 1853 et scq., the Austrian expedition under Wulierstorf-Urbair in 1858 and following years. The Fiji Islands were visited by Seemann 1860, Graffe 1865-8, Goodenough 1874-5, 1876- 77 by Parkinson. Since then Her Majesty’s ships have been surveying in the Pacific at frequent intervals, and since the annexations by France and Germany much good work has been done in Caledonia, Tahiti, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Marshall Islands, and elsewhere by the officers of these governments. Both for the exploration of the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans, and for a knowledge of their island groups, POLAR There was great activity in Arctic exploration during the first half of the century. In 1818 Sir John Ross explored Baffin Bay, and Buchan endeavoured to penetrate to the north of Spitzbergen. In 1819-25 Parry explored Lancaster Sound and the islands to which it gives access, including Melville. Peninsula, and also tried to pass through Hudson’s Bay. In 1823 Clavering reached the east coast of Green- land in 76° N. lat. In 1827 Parry reached 82° 43' N. lat. to the north of Spitzbergen. In 1829-32 James Ross was on the Boothia Peninsula, and discovered the Magnetic Pole. On the mainland in 1819-23 Franklin, Richardson, and Back were exploring the coast from the Coppermine River. Back supplemented this in 1833, and in 1837-39 Dease and Simpson, and ten years later Rae, contributed much to a knowledge of this coast and of the opposite islands, the latter also doing much for the geography of the region round Repulse Bay. In 1845 Franklin’s ill-fated expedition in the Erebus and Terror sailed to make out the North-West Passage, and was lost on the south of King William’s Island. For ten years expedition after expedition was sent out to discover traces of Franklin, the result being not only the discovery of the fate of Franklin and his men, but of many new coasts and new islands to the north of America. One of these expedi- tions under M‘01ure actually completed the North-West Passage. In 1853-55 and 1860-61 Kane and Hayes pushed northward in the Smith Sound direction, and in 1871 Hall succeeded in reaching 82° 16'. In 1857 the Swedes began to send scientific expeditions to Spitzbergen; these were continued for years, latterly under the direction of Baron Nordenskjold, and have added greatly to our knowledge of Spitzbergen and of the seas and islands around. In 1875-6 Nordenskjold penetrated through the Kara Sea to the Yeni- sei, and in 1878-79 he succeeded in sailing along the north coast of Asia and Europe, and so accomplishing the North- a vast amount of good work was done by the Challenger expe- dition in J 872 and following years, while the United States Government has done much for the exploration of the North Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1881 and following years Guppy in the Lark added greatly to our knowledge of the Salo- mon Islands, which was supplemented by Woodford in 1886-9. The various deep-sea expeditions have given rise to a new department of physical geography, Oceanography or Thalasso- graphy, which investigates the nature and contour of the ocean bed, the ocean currents both on and below the surface, the chemical constitution of the sea water, and the forms of life which prevail therein. The Marquesas Islands were annexed by France in 1841 ; New Caledonia in 1854; Tahiti and Morea, 1880; Tubua, Taumotu and the Gambier Islands in 1881 ; Wallis Islands, 1887 ; Raratoa, 1888. Fiji was annexed by Great Britain in 1874. In 1884 Germany annexed New Britain (Neu Pommern) and neighbouring groups (Bismarck Archipelago) and the Salomon Islands; and in 1885 the Marshall Islands. East Passage, adding largely by the way to a knowledge of this part of the Arctic regions. In 1869-70 Koldewey wintered on the east coast of Greenland, and reached 77° N. lat. In 1872-4 Payer and Weyprecht, sailing to the north- east of Novaia Zemlia, discovered Franz Josef Land, since further explored by Leigh Smith. Under Nares the Alert and Discovery were sent out by Smith Sound by the British Government in 1875. It wintered in Lady Franklin Bay 82° 27' N., exploi-ed the north coasts of Greenland and Grinnell Land, while Captain Markham succeeded in pushing as far north as 83° 20' 26\". Since then Greely (1881-5), in command of a United States expedition, wintered in Lady Franklin Bay, explored the interior of Grinnell Land and the north coast of Greenland, one party succeeding in reach- ing a mile or two beyond Markham’s furthest. In Greenland itself Nordenskjold ill 1883 succeeded in penetrating about 150 miles across the inland ice to the south of Disco ; a year or two later Peary inland for about 100 miles, while in 1888 Nansen crossed from the east to the west coast in the southern part of Greenland. Early in the century Lutke explored Novaia Zemlia, and in more recent years both English and Russian expeditions have added to our knowledge of these islands. Other expeditions to the north of Asia are referred to under Asia. In the Antarctic regions, Biscoe in 1830-32 discovered Enderby Land and Graham Land in 67° S. ; in 1837-40 Dumont D’Urville reached 66° 30' S. lat.., discovering AdIclie Land the Glarie coast. In 1839 Balleny discovered the Balleny Islands, 66° 44' S., and Sabrina Island, 65° 10' S. The great Antarctic expedition, 1839-43, under Sir James Ross, reached 78° 4' S. and 187° E. ; discovered Victoria Land, with its lofty volcanoes Erebus and Terror, and the great ice wall which barred all access to the interior of the land. Since then little has been done for Antarctic explora- tion, the Challenger only venturing to touch the circle. REGIONS. NORTH POLAR CHART. \\ a> crape extent 13 shem-n in white \\ W. X? A.K.
