Discussions with its initiator and intellectual godfather Günther Lottes and his team fostered my interest in early modern chorographies. Thomas Fuchs, Ernst Riegg, Joachim Eibach, Marcus Sandl and Stephanie Dzeja have been good friends and colleagues at JLU. The University of the West of England, Bristol granted me sabbatical leave in 2004–2005 and also in 2007 to work on the project. Research fellowships at the Herzog-August-Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel and the University of Antwerp have provided both additional research time and also a stimulating atmosphere in which to study and to discuss concepts of memory and historiography. Special thanks go to Guido Marnef, who facilitated my stay at Antwerp and who introduced me to the University’s Urban History Centre. Its convivial, but deeply scholarly atmosphere helped me to understand further and to appreciate those Burgundian traditions whose revival played such an important role in the historiography of the Habsburg Netherlands. I am grateful also to Eddy Verbaan and Erik Swart who discussed with me important aspects of my work and also shared their research. Trevor Johnson drew my attention initially to the wider world of Counter-Reformation historiography. I should like to thank Sina Rauschenbach, Harald Bollbuck, Heiko Droste, Brecht Deseure and Steven Ellis who have read chapters of the manuscript and have given insightful advice. The Netzwerk Historiographiegeschichte der Frühen Neuzeit provided me with the opportunity to contextualize my study within the wider framework of the history of historiography, and I should like to thank its organizers, Susanne Rau and Birgit Studt, for facilitating three years of lively discussions about the writing of history in early modern Europe. My thanks also go to Judith Pollmann and her research team in Leiden for stimulating debates on “Tales of the Revolt”. Nicolas Regan, Jayne Gifford and Lex van Tilborg all helped with the editing of the manuscript in its various forms. Finally, I owe much to the continuous encouragement and thoughtful advice of Alastair Duke, who has borne with this project through its many phases. I dedicate this book to him.\n\nGLOSSARY ambtman regional official whose function can be compared to that of a burgomaster Alteratie of 1578 The change of power that occurred in Amsterdam on May 26th 1578, when the Catholic government was replaced by a Protestant one. beleg siege beroerten troubles beschryvinghe description beurs/bourse exchange burgemeester (dutch), burgomaster one of the chief magistrates in a town; in Holland towns usually had four burgomasters. burgher citizen burcht stronghold/castle chronyck chronicle directeur (executive) director Doopsgezinden Mennonites geschiedenis history Geuzen beggars; name adopted by the party of the Revolt. gracht canal grachtengordel the Amsterdam canal district griffier secretary or court clerk Heer Lord Hof superior court of a particular province, e.g. Hof van Holland, Hof van Gelre. leengreffier liefhebbers sympathizers of the Calvinist church who had no official links with the church raad, or rade council\n\nx\n\nglossary\n\nRaad van Beroerten “Council of Troubles”, a special tribunal that was instituted by the Duke of Alva in 1567 to deal with the crimes that had been committed during the past political and religious “troubles” in the Netherlands.

Nor was he the only publisher in the city to exploit local history. Marcus Willemsz. Doornik, one of van Meurs’ competitors, launched no fewer than three volumes on Amsterdam in the short period between 1662 and 1665.2 The genre of ‘Historical Descriptions’ was clearly booming in Holland’s metropolis in the mid-seventeenth century. Dapper’s and von Zesen’s books, and other works from Doornik’s press were neither the first nor the last in a series of publications on Amsterdam’s past and present which incorporated surveys of the city’s topography and were often very profusely illustrated. Neither was the genre restricted to the Dutch Republic’s financial and mercantile capital. Throughout the United Provinces civic authorities and members of the urban and provincial elites sponsored works in praise of their 1 Olfert Dapper, Historische Beschryving der Stadt Amsterdam: waerin de voornaemste geschiedenissen (na een kort verhael van gansch Holland en d’omleggende Dorpen, als Ambachts-heerlijkheeden, onder deze stadt gelegen) die ten tijde der Herdoopers, Nederlandtsche beroerten, en onder Prins Willems, de tweede, Stadt-houderlijke Regeering, hier te stede voor-gevallen zijn, verhandelt, en Al de Stads gemeene, zoo Geestelijke als Wereltlijke, Gebouwen, in meer als tzeventijg kopere Platen, met haer nevenstaende Beschryving, vertoont worden, Amsterdam (Meurs) 1663. 2 Doornik published Melchior Fokkens, Beschryvinge der wijdt-vermaarde KoopStadt Amstelredam, enz.

In the Spanish Netherlands, the Habsburg court commissioned similar enterprises for Antwerp, Brussels, Mechelen and other urban centres and also for regions and provinces in the South. Such works were often published at key moments in the histories of the cities or provinces whose political elite promoted and bought chorographies. The production of topographical-historical descriptions was prompted by the renewed interest in the works of the ancient geographer Strabo of Amasia (64/63 B.C.–c. 23), whose Geography provided the basis for the detailed geographical surveys of a region or a city, its people, its flora and fauna and reference to its history.3 In his contribution to geographical knowledge Strabo focused on specific areas and not on the whole earth or the cosmos like his successor Claudius Ptolemy, who laid the foundation for the great cosmographies of the early modern period.4 While Ptolemy relied on mathematical-astronomical calculations, Strabo preferred a historical-descriptive approach to geography. Strabo’s concept was first tested in Italy by the humanist scholar and papal secretary Flavio Biondo, whose Italia Illustrata (1453) reintroduced the chorographical genre to European scholarship. Although not the first to follow in Biondo’s footsteps, the Italian merchant-scholar Ludovico Guicciardini popularized chorographies in the Low Countries in the sixteenth century.5 His Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi, first published in 1567, began with a glowing review of Guicciardini’s adopted city, Antwerp, and subsequently covered the provinces of the Low Countries using the seventeen titles of Philip II as a framework for his survey. Although initially written in Italian for his compatriots in the Netherlands, the Descrittione was received with great interest in the Low Countries, and saw numerous editions in various languages and from different, often competing publishing houses in Antwerp and in Amsterdam.6 Despite its popularity, the work also met with some criticism, notably from learned circles. The Haarlem physician and 3 Strabo, The Geography, transl. by Horace L. Jones, Cambridge/Mass. (Harvard University Press) 1917–1932. 4 On Strabo see Daniela Dueck, Strabo of Amasia: A Greek Man of Letters in Augustan Rome, London (Routledge) 2000; Edward Ch.L. van der Vliet, Strabo over landen, volken en steden, Assen (van Gorcum) 1977. 5 Matthaeus Herbenus’ Libellus in Traiecto instaurato, a topographical-historical description of the author’s hometown, Maastricht, of 1485 closely followed as the title suggests Flavio Biondo’s Romae Instauratae (1471), but it was never published. 6 On the publication history of Guicciardini’s work see Herman de la Fontaine Verwey, ‘The history of Guicciardini’s description of the Low Countries’, Quaerendo 12, 1, 1982, pp. 22–51. See also Henk van der Heijden and Kees Oomen, De ‘beschrijving van\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n3\n\nhumanist scholar Hadrianus Junius, for instance, criticized the Italian for his lack of research and his concentration on the present at the expense of the historical roots of the provinces and their inhabitants. Junius prepared his own contribution to chorographical scholarship, a historical-chorographical survey of Holland, the Batavia, which, however, was only published posthumously, and then only incompletely, in 1588.7 While both the approaches of Guicciardini and Junius were adopted by chorographers in the seventeenth century, Junius’ emphasis on archival research, the incorporation of authentic sources and the discussion of etymological and archaeological evidence became more prominent in the Northern Netherlands both among learned authors and ‘amateur historians’.8 It might be argued that the search for a new, alternative, past, which could be used to provide the new Dutch Republic with a new genealogy and history independent from its old ties to the Habsburg Empire and the Catholic Church, would be more fruitful when utilizing Junius’ chorographical approach rather than Guicciardini’s. As we shall see, Southern chorographies, whose authors (and readers) were more interested in emphasizing continuity rather than change, cited Guicciardini more frequently than did their Northern counterparts. This, however, does not mean that Southern chorographies simply updated Guicciardini’s text. They utilized chorographical surveys for their own purposes and took the genre in particular directions. The production of chorographies in the Low Countries during the seventeenth century went through several cycles which often responded to key events in urban, regional and national history. Interest in Amsterdam, as could be seen from the publication dates from van Meurs’ and Doornik’s presses coincided with the last phase of the massive urban extension programme of the city’s town planners. Other peak times of chorographical productions coincided, perhaps not surprisingly, with the Twelve Years’ Truce and with the Treaties of Westphalia, when the de Nederlanden’ door Lodovico Guicciardini in het kader van zijn tijd, Cartographica Historica 2, Alphen (Canaletto/Repro-Holland) 2001. 7 Hadrianus Junius, Batavia, Leiden (Raphelengius) 1588. On Junius see, for instance, E.O.G. Haitsma Mulier, ‘De eerste Hollandse Stadsbeschrijvingen uit de Zeventiende Eeuw’, De Zeventiende Eeuw 9, 1993, pp. 97–116, here especially pp. 101–102. 8 I am grateful to Eddy Verbaan for this information. Verbaan will further develop the distinction between the Guicciardinian and the Junian approach to chorographies in his PhD dissertation.\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\npolitical boundaries of the two states of the Low Countries were finally settled. In total more than fifty urban and regional chorographies were published in the United Provinces alone in the roughly eighty years, starting in 1611 with Johannes Isacius Pontanus’ Latin Rerum et Urbis Amstelodamensium Historia and culminating in Caspar Commelin’s massive Beschryvinge van Amsterdam in 1693.9 In the Spanish Netherlands the Archdukes Albert and Isabella specifically sponsored and supported a chorographical programme, which was delivered through a range of topographical-historical surveys mainly written by their court historian Jean Baptiste Gramaye in the first decades of the seventeenth century. In tandem with urban chorographies, provinces and regions in the Low Countries were also described in chorographical works. These were frequently commissioned by the provincial estates and in the South, again, by the Habsburg court, and were often the work of authors who already had written urban chorographies, and who shifted easily between the two areas. Olfert Dapper was a prolific author with a keen eye for geography and history well beyond Amsterdam’s city walls and canal systems. He was particularly fascinated by the Arab and African world and indeed wrote more about Syria and Palestine than about his home town.10 This physician, who had studied medicine in Utrecht, explained the nature of his book on Amsterdam, his aims and intentions and the role of chorographical studies as a form of historical writing, in the dedication to his patron, Amsterdam’s regent and oud-burgomaster Kornelis Witsen. In the preface to the Historische Beschryving, he described his work as a patriotic enterprise, written to remind his fellow citizens of the valiant deeds of their fathers and forefathers, who, like their ancient\n\n9 Both authors and their studies on Amsterdam will be discussed in Chapter I. The number of urban chorographies is based on my research. For the Northern Nether­ lands see also E.O.G. Haitsma Mulier, G.A.C., van der Lem (eds.), Repertorium van geschiedschrijvers in Nederland, 1500–1800, The Hague (Nederlands Historisch Genootschap) 1990. 10 See for instance, his Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche Gewesten van Egypten, Barbaryen, Libyen, Biledulgerid, Amsterdam (Meurs) 1668; ibid., Naukeurige beschryving van gantsch Syrie en Palestyn, of Heilige Lant, Amsterdam (Meurs) 1677; ibid., Naukeurige beschrijvinge der Afrikaensche eylanden: als Madagaskar, of Sant Laurens, Sant Thomee, d’eilanden van Kanarien, Kaep de Verd, Malta, en andere, Amsterdam (Meurs) 1668; ibid., Naukeurige beschryving van Syrië, behelsende Mesopotamië, Babylonië, Assyrië, Anatolië of Klein Asië, Arabië, Amsterdam (Meurs) 1680. All of these books were published by Jacob van Meurs, who clearly regarded Dapper as an eminently marketable author.\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n5\n\nrole models Leonidas, Scipio and Hannibal, had given their lives in the defence of their city and their country.11 Retelling the old heroic tales and mixing them with new stories to educate the community and to strengthen communal ties was, he pointed out, one important part of the task that he had set himself with this study. It was combined with a survey of the architectural manifestations of Amsterdam’s greatness, which now included the “eighth wonder of the world”, the city’s magnificent new Town Hall. It also offered a discussion of Amsterdam’s origins, an overview of its government and a description of the surrounding countryside. All this was supported by a series of spectacular engravings showing the architectural ‘highlights’ and landmarks of the city. Dapper then proved his credentials as a serious researcher by referring to the municipal documents he had consulted with the help of Witsen’s son to convince sceptical readers that a physician was just as capable of writing a professional chorographical study of Amsterdam as any academic historian. Dapper bowed to the canon of ancient authors and cited, in good humanist tradition, Cicero and Seneca, but saw his own contribution to scholarship not so much in the display of his rhetorical abilities acquired through the reception of classical examples, but in the presentation of the “simple and naked truth” written in his vernacular Dutch, which he found much more stimulating than any learned expression of eloquent oration. Moreover, he referred to an already existing, indigenous tradition of Amsterdam chorographies, to which he aimed to contribute with his study. Dapper’s methodological statement was certainly not simply the plea of an educated amateur in search of scholarly recognition for his work.12 His reflections on chorographical style and content were very poised, and responded to the continuing intellectual discussions not just in the Low Countries, but also in the wider European Republic of Letters about the conventions and requirements of historical writing and the role of antiquarianism within or outside this process. These debates were not static, but, while initially still acknowledging 11 These and the following references are taken from Dapper, Historische Beschry­ ving, Introduction. This study is based on the copy of Dapper’s book preserved in the Herzog-August-Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel. 12 Dapper stood at the cross roads of the professional separation of humanities and sciences, which only became common in the eighteenth century. On the fluidity and cross-fertilization of historical and medical studies see most recently: Gianna Pomata, Nancy G. Siraisi, ‘Introduction’, in: ibid. (eds.), Historia. Empiricism and Erudition in Early Modern Europe, Cambridge/Mass. (MIT Press) 2005, pp. 1–38.\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nthe Strabonian origins of the genre, changed focus and developed a new and different agenda in the course of the seventeenth century, in which Dapper’s work was only one milestone among others in the search for a theory and practice of the writing of (urban) history. Earlier writers, such as the above-mentioned Johannes Isacius Pontanus, and later chorographers such as Marcus Zuerius Boxhorn and Arend van Slichtenhorst expressed their own views on the genre in their contributions to urban, local and national scholarship.13 The present study charts this process. It analyzes the development of chorographies in the Low Countries and the role of chorographical writings in the debates on history and antiquarianism as two interrelated approaches to an understanding and a learned presentation of the past. Any such analysis starts inevitably with a comment on Arnaldo Momigliano’s seminal article Ancient History and the Antiquarian, where he proposed the still widely accepted distinction between historical writing as narrative and antiquarian research as description.14 In his view, historians wrote exemplary stories of great men, antiquarians researched institutions and collected artefacts; historians were concerned with elegance and eloquence; antiquarians focused on original documents and citations. Historians took classical history as their template to move and to educate their readers with examples of moral conduct; antiquarians were concerned with the ‘jetsam of history’.15 These rather sweeping generalizations, which oversimplify Momigliano’s argument, have been challenged in recent years. Scholars interested in the history of historiography now recognize that the two modes of writing about the past were far more hybrid and less disparate than had been suggested by Momigliano, who saw antiquarians as would-be historians who had simply got too entangled with detail.16\n\n13 On Boxhorn and van Slichtenhorst and their works see Chapter VII of the present study. 14 Arnaldo Momigliano, ‘Ancient History and the Antiquarian’, in: ibid., Studies in Historiography, London (Weidenfeld and Nicholson) 1966, pp. 1–39. 15 For this image see, for instance, Arnoldus Buchelius’ letter to Franciscus Sweertius, 30 November 1615, cited in Sandra Langereis, Geschiedenis als Ambacht, Oudheidkunde in de Gouden Eeuw, Arnoldus Buchelius en Petrus Scriverius, Hilversum (Verloren) 2001, p. 27. 16 For a critique on Momigliano see, for instance, Mark Salber Phillips, ‘Reconsiderations on History and Antiquarianism: Arnaldo Momigliano and the Historiography of Eighteenth-Century Britain’, Journal of the History of Ideas 58, 1996, pp. 297–316. See also the essays in Martin Myrone and Lucy Peltz (eds.), Producing the Past: Aspects of Antiquarian Culture and Practice, 1700–1850, Aldershot (Ashgate) 1999.\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n7\n\nFritz Levy has recently pointed out that, for contemporaries, these distinctions were far less clear-cut in the seventeenth century than in the eighteenth century, when amateur antiquarians became a source of ridicule for their alleged obsession with detail and with ancient and medieval ‘clutter’.17 He calls for a reassessment of the relationship of the two approaches to the past in seventeenth-century writings. Levy cites William Camden’s own comments on the two genres as evidence that contemporary scholars could distinguish very well between the two, but had no difficulties in transgressing the boundaries of method and approach associated with the writing of histories or antiquarian studies when it suited their purpose. Similar observations have been made about the works of Hugo Grotius, who also moved between antiquarian and ‘historical’ modes of writing.18 The present study will respond to the suggestions of Levy (and others) by highlighting the similarities rather than the distinctions between the works of historians and antiquarians. It will be argued that the chorographical genre was used by scholars and amateur historians to combine both forms of historiography and that authors found their own approach to chorographies while incorporating both narrative and descriptive elements into their writings.19 This combination was not introduced as a way of blurring the boundaries between history and antiquarianism, nor 17 Fritz L.

This interpretation thus challenges Henk van Nierop’s earlier assessment of chorographies as “thoroughly antiquarian in approach”.\n\n8\n\nintroduction\n\nwas it simply a very practical response to the newly drawn boundaries between the two countries, that emerged from the Eighty Years’ War, and which required detailed descriptions often visualized in maps of what was within and what was outside a city’s or region’s border. In many cases, this combination of the traditionally distinct genres was accompanied by thoughtful theoretical and methodological considerations, which were based on the Strabonian model of chorographical writings, but also responded to an ongoing debate on the ‘artes historicae’ among scholars across Europe.20 Much of Camden’s research and writing was the result of his discussions and exchanges with other European scholars. It has been pointed out that seventeenth-century chorography in England was influenced by leading examples from the Continent and, most notably, by intellectuals from the Low Countries such as Emmanuel van Meteren and Abraham Ortelius, who both lived and worked in London, but who also maintained an extensive network of epistolary exchanges which crossed national (and sometimes confessional) lines. While much has been written on the English chorographical (and antiquarian) tradition in recent years, their Netherlandish role models have so far not received the scholarly attention that they deserve.21 Apart from a few pioneering studies by E.O.G. Haitsma Mulier, historians working on identity and memory in the early modern Low Countries have, until recently, largely ignored chorographies and their authors as important sources for an understanding of the writing of history in the seventeenth century and as an arena for the creation of memories and identities.22 Only in the last years have case studies such as Sandra Langereis’ analysis of two seventeenth-century Dutch See Henk van Nierop, ‘How to honour one’s city: Samuel Ampzing’s vision of the history of Haarlem’, Theoretische Geschiedenis 20, 1993, pp. 268–282, here p. 273. 20 Recent studies that have analyzed some of these international intellectual networks include Karen Skovgaard-Petersen, Historiography at the Court of Christian IV (1588–1648).

This is all the more surprising since scholars have long recognized the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years’ War as ‘seismic events’, where long-established cultural landmarks crumbled and traditional structures of authority and belief came under stress, and where new modes of thinking about the past and the present influenced and were influenced by new modes of writing about them. Revolutionary acts such as the Act of Abjuration of 1581, by which the signatories declared the sovereignty of Philip II over the Netherlands null and void, needed to be explained, not least by a reinterpretation of history. At a time when tradition and precedent still provided the most powerful arguments for the affirmation of rights and regulations and for the settlements of disputes, the past offered a quarry of interpretations of the origins of present crises and a justification for future action. The politics of memory, the appropriation of a version of the past which could accommodate and support present politics and attitudes in the North and in the South played a key role in the public debates about war and peace and about forms of government and religion.27 They also left a lasting legacy of difference between the cultures of the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Netherlands. How this legacy was formed by the different groups in Netherlandish society employing a multitude of commemorative media, to which chorographies contributed, has yet to be properly examined.28 The following study thus has two aims. Firstly, it analyzes historiographical conventions, approaches and methodologies in choro27 For public debates in the early seventeenth century see Judith Pollmann, ‘No man’s land. Reinventing Netherlandish Identities, 1585–1621’, in: Robert Stein & Judith Pollmann (eds.), Networks, Regions and Nations, pp. 241–261. 28 New and important insights into the interplay between the public and the private memory of the Dutch Revolt from a comparative perspective can be expected from the Vici Project “Tales of the Revolt: Memory. Oblivion and Identity in the Low Countries, 1566–1700”, which started under the guidance of Judith Pollmann at Leiden University in September 2008. It needs to be pointed out, that groups outside Netherlandish society also contributed to the formation of a distinct Dutch and Netherlandish identity. Research, for instance, into the Spanish view of war and partition in the Netherlands would be very interesting. See here Yolanda Rodríguez Pérez, De Tachtigjarige Oorlog in Spaanse ogen. De Nederlanden in Spaanse historische en literaire teksten (circa 1548–1673), Nijmegen (Vantilt) 2003. See also her ‘The Pelican and its Ungrateful Children.

The town and regional histories in the Northern and Southern Netherlands eventually pursued distinctly different historiographical courses, which had major implications both for the style of the works and for their contents. The following chapters will discuss whether and how new elements and deviations from tradition, influenced by contemporary developments in the Low Countries, were gradually integrated into the writings of a town’s or region’s past and the descriptions of its topography. These developments are contextualized within a wider analysis of changes in historical scholarship in the seventeenth century recently summarized by Daniel Woolf under five main headings, which, although specifically produced for the historiography of early modern England, can also be applied to the role of Netherlandish chorographies.29 Woolf sees in this period, firstly, a widening participation of greater sections of society in the construction of a historical mental map, in other words in a periodization of the past. This is, secondly, accompanied by the development of a visual sense of the past, which, as can certainly be demonstrated for the Low Countries, found its expression in a growing interest in artefacts and material remains such as coins, historical inscriptions and architecture and their interpretation as evidence of the past in chorographical texts and other historical writings. These changes were, thirdly, discussed within learned circles who acknowledged the differences between genres and their particular methods and approaches, which were still very much in flux. In this process scholars were able and willing, as has already been pointed out with the examples of Camden and Grotius, to transgress the boundaries between the different modes of writing about the past. Fourthly, Woolf points out that due to the political upheavals of the time—in Britain the Civil Wars of the 1640s, in the Low Countries the Dutch Revolt and the Eighty Years’ War and in France the Wars of Religion—historiography now shifted from its emphasis on exemplary stories to “the primacy of causal relationships between diachronically contiguous and proximate events”.30 The humanist-Ciceronian claim of Historia as the presentation of timeless, exemplary stories came under threat. Fifthly, at the same time, writers conceded that there were gaps Daniel Woolf, ‘From Hystories to the Historical: Five Transitions in Thinking about the Past, 1500–1700’, in: Paulina Kewes (ed.), The Uses of History in Early Modern England, pp. 31–67, here p. 36. 30 Daniel Woolf, ‘From Hystories to the Historical’, p. 36. 29\n\n12\n\nintroduction\n\nin their knowledge which were now no longer filled with speculative stories or improbable chronologies and mixtures of fable and folklore. The present study puts these criteria to the test for chorographical writing in the seventeenth-century Netherlands. It thus contributes to the growing interest in the history of historiography which is, in a way, a response to the challenges to the discipline by contemporary society, and discussions around ‘Academic’ and ‘Public’ History (topics which, as will be shown, were certainly also relevant for the agents of a ‘political memory’ in the seventeenth-century Low Countries). The second aim of this study is to contribute to the current interest in ‘cultures of memory’ and ‘memory studies’, which has moved from research focused on the modern world on the one hand, and on the other, the seminal works undertaken by the German Egyptologist Jan Assmann on the pre-classical period to an inquiry into memory practices in the early modern period.31 In this context the study will utilize Aleida Assmann’s concept of ‘political memory’ for its assessment of the role of chorography as a popular genre used by civic and provincial elites to construct a canon of traditions and a usable image of the past, which might serve to stabilize a desired memory of key events that shaped the identities of the Low Countries in the seventeenth century.32 Based on the different strands of memory studies presented by scholars from such different disciplines as politics, sociology, history, 31 The first comprehensive and influential study on modern cultures of memory is undoubtedly Pierre Nora’s massive project on Les lieux de mémoire, Paris (Edition Gallimard) 1984, which has inaugurated a wealth of similar studies on places of memory in different national historiographies.

I do not share Assmann’s assumption that a critical historiography only appeared from the nineteenth century onwards.\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n13\n\nanthropology and psychology over the last thirty years—which have in many cases been inspired by earlier research, notably by Maurice Halbwachs’ considerations on the interplay between individual memory and society—Assmann proposes four categories of memory. She distinguishes between individual, social, cultural and political memory, all of which are presented as ways in which both societies and individuals can make sense of their pasts and, therefore, their present.33 In this ‘memory-quartet’, the development of a ‘political memory’ is seen as a top-down process, facilitated and determined by those members of society who had access to archives and expertise in historical and other literature and the ability, time and money to combine knowledge and power to produce a compelling, consensual narrative of the past in textual or non-textual form to support and confirm existing power structures within an urban, provincial or national society. The construction of a ‘political memory’ thus offers one—usually elite— interpretation and commemoration of past events, which is particularly important in early modern society, with its use of tradition and precedent as a marker of legitimacy.34 However, this offer of a version of the past, which manifested itself frequently, but by no means exclusively, in written texts, thus in early modern historiography, is just one among many modes of remembering in which an interpretation of current policy and a construction of belonging was harnessed to history. Manifestations of a constructed common past could assume different expressions both in the public sphere of plays, processions and popular songs in the more private space of diaries and memoires. It is difficult to assess the success of chorographies as a particular form of memory practice within the wider ‘market’ of commemorative media on offer to the different social groups in the United Provinces and in the Spanish Netherlands. It is equally difficult to assess the reception of these texts by men and women in search of a ‘usable past’ designed to make sense of their present. A sense of belonging could be attached to different, sometimes overlapping, sometimes competing loyalties to 33 Maurice Halbwachs, Les Cadres sociaux de la mémoire, Paris (Albin Michel) 1994, first published 1925. 34 Insightful theoretical considerations on the role of historical texts produced to establish the political memory of an elite are offered in: Thomas Fuchs, Geschichtsbewusstsein und Geschichtsschreibung zwischen Reformation und Aufklärung, Städtechroniken, Kirchenbücher und historische Befragungen in Hessen, 1500–1800, Marburg (Verein für hessische Geschichte und Landeskunde) 2006.

This is certainly as much the case for urban identity as it is for national identity.35 In the absence of quantitative evidence about print runs, sales figures and reviews, this study will not try to rank the importance of chorographies in comparison with other versions of national, regional and urban history. It can, however, be demonstrated that chorographies were not written in a literary vacuum. They responded to and incorporated other contemporary writings, such as biographies, funeral literature, dramas and poems, thus offering a rich tapestry of commemorative texts which can be analyzed in search of an urban or provincial identity, by highlighting common features referenced and cross-referenced in other media which might be identified as markers of this identity. “National” histories such as Pieter Christiaenszoon Bor’s Oorspronck, begin ende vervolgh der Nederlantsche Oorlogen were, for example, frequently cited and often copied verbatim in regional and urban chorographies of the North.36 These chorographies also included transcripts of and references to popular songs and personal narratives of ordinary men and women, public processions and commemorative festivals thus combining elements of what Aleida Assmann defines as “social” or “interactive memory” of orally and personally transmitted histories with an elite version of the past fixed in historiography.37 Chorographies also responded to urban architecture by including engravings of key buildings and places of civic importance, and with detailed descriptions of their iconographic programmes. Olfert Dapper, for instance, dedicated no less than fifty pages of his book to a meticulous survey of Amsterdam’s new Town Hall and the sculptures and images on display there, thus using one form of commemorative media to describe another.38 These memory practices were, therefore, more closely interrelated than Assmann assumes for the early modern period. It will be argued\n\n35 The literature on national identity, and also on regional and urban identity, is vast.

Most of the texts were sponsored by the political elite, such as burgomasters and regents, and, in Amsterdam, the East India Company, and by provincial estates. Authors were recruited from wider segments of the urban and provincial elite, including the Protestant and Catholic clergy, town clerks and academics. With an emphasis on the use of the vernacular, which became a trade mark of these texts in the Northern Netherlands, they addressed a wider readership than scholarly circles of academics and policy makers. This is not the case in the Southern Netherlands, where the majority of the publications were written in Latin and often aimed at international, educated readership.39 In most cases a Dutch translation was not issued. Where it appeared, for instance for Antonius Sanderus’ Flandria Illustrata, there was a considerable gap between the publication of the original and its translation.40 Very few authors in the South produced chorographies in Dutch.41 Chorographical descriptions of cities, provinces and regions established or confirmed both spatial and cultural identities and the boundaries between the two states of the Low Countries and also between towns, cities and provinces in the United Provinces and the Habs­ burg Netherlands, whose political elites were jockeying for position in newly created political arenas. This book thus not only presents a new, cross-border analysis of early modern identity formation in the Netherlands, but also broadens an often still very hollandocentric view of Dutch identity with the inclusion of texts written from the eastern ‘peripheries’ of the United Provinces such as Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland. In trying to draft a wider geographical picture of the landscapes of memory, it challenges the still prevalent interpretation of Dutch historiography in its ‘Golden Age’ as the unfolding of a unilateral success story. War and partition left a very different legacy in the different parts of the United Provinces, which is evident in the topographical-historical constructions of towns such as Nijmegen or Coevorden, as compared with the narratives of the urban centres of the North Sea provinces. Economic and political winners and losers See Stefan Benz, Zwischen Tradition und Kritik. For Antonius Sanderus’ chorographies and their translations see Chapter VII. 41 See, for instance, Laurens van Haecht Goidtsenhoven’s Chroniike van den Hertoghen van Brabant, Antwerp (Vriendt) 1606, which will be discussed in Chapter VIII. 39 40\n\n16\n\nintroduction\n\nof the war employed chorographers to present urban or regional space in the best possible light by highlighting (or eradicating) landmarks of their topography and key events in their pasts. The management of memory (in its various manifestations) also included the process of oblivion. While some events were emphasized, others had to be firmly written out of the desired narrative. Moreover, the experience of time was (and is) dependent upon what Aleida Assmann, in analogy to Halbwachs’ concept of social frames, has called ‘cultural time frames’ which determine its interpretation and action.42 The perception of time in terms of ‘decline’ or ‘renewal’, ‘standstill’ or ‘change’, ‘continuity’ or ‘discontinuity’ underlined the presentation of these pasts in different ways corresponding with the general feeling of gain or loss in the cities and regions involved in the Eighty Years’ War. It gave winners and loser of the war a frame in which to establish a vision of themselves, both in their own right and vis-à-vis their competitors.43 In some respects the study thus provides a continuation of the abovementioned Leiden project studying the tensions between regional, urban and the emerging supra-regional identities in the Low Countries under the Habsburgs. While the Leiden team focused on changing identities through the unification of the Habsburg territories, the present study addresses the impact of the partial collapse of Habsburg power in the Low Countries and the establishment of new political entities on traditions and interpretations of the past. It analyzes the way in which regional and urban identities, presented through chorographical texts responded to the two new states established on the territory of the Low Countries. In this context, it is important to study not only what German historiography has called Zeitgeschichte (the remarkable events of the present time), but, perhaps more importantly, Vergangenheitsgeschichte (the history of a distant past). Origin and other myths, genealogies 42 Maurice Halbwachs, Das Gedächtnis und seine sozialen Bedingungen, transl. and repr. Frankfurt (Fischer) 1985, p. 21. 43 For the concept of time frames see again Aleida Assmann, ‘Four Formats of Memory’. Interpretations of the competitive nature of these texts vary. For E.O.G. Haitsma Mulier, whose studies mainly focus on Holland’s early urban chorographies competition was not a motor for the production of these texts. Casting wider the net of a chorographical survey, I will argue that both urban and regional chorographies constantly employed comparisons with Holland in general and with Amsterdam in particular, and drew much of their post-war identity formation from these comparisons. For Haitsma Mulier’s assessment see his ‘Descriptions of Towns in the Seventeenth-century Province of Holland’.\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n17\n\nand lineage, heroes and villains of medieval or earlier times, together with the accounts of the more recent past, supplied narratives that were used to construct community and identity and to connect early modern societies with a desired history. It remains to be seen whether and where older traditions persisted in these interpretations or were replaced by a new version of the events of the past accommodating a new understanding of the present. Besides these meta-interpretations of change over time (or the lack of it), chorographers employed frameworks taken from the different intellectual discourses prevalent in the seventeenth century. These included the confessional discourse of Calvinist and CounterReformation arguments, the humanist discourse in its various manifestations, focusing not least on the dichotomy of civility and barbarism, and its responses, the legal discourse of rights, focusing, not surprisingly, on the right of resistance and on the defence of their traditional liberties. It will be demonstrated how these discourses, and the events described in the various political and cultural languages of the time changed over the period of roughly eighty years. Sometimes these changed in very subtle ways which still paid homage to an established canonicity, but which interpreted events in a different light, sometimes, as will be seen, ‘playing’ with once-venerable role models, and shifting the boundaries of what had been traditional interpretations to the brink of ridicule without, however, completely abandoning an established set of markers of identity. These changes often corresponded with generational change. Members of a younger generation often ‘shifted the goalposts’ of an interpretation of the past, which, however, was more concerned with nuance than with a radical overhaul of what needed to be remembered and what became obsolete in a memory-package that provided a compass for the present. It has been pointed out that the period witnessed the return of a unified authorial voice, replacing the often anonymous medieval chroniclers.44 Authors now presented themselves as researchers, as eyewitnesses of what was described: in short, they claimed authority for their texts, and they gradually exchanged rhetorical for empirical evidence as the most convincing argument for the ‘truth’ of their version of the past, leading eventually to the antiquarian’s claim that\n\nDaniel Woolf, ‘From Hystories to the Historical’, p. 46.\n\n44\n\n18\n\nintroduction\n\nartefacts provide “evidence that will not lie”.45 This greater emphasis on individual approaches in Dutch chorographies, which has already been pointed out by E.O.G. Haitsma Mulier, had repercussions on the approach and focus of the studies in question here. Reformed ministers with an amateur interest in local and regional chorographies chose a distinctly different style from authors writing to prove their academic credentials in the world of learning. Scholars at the centre of the Republic of Letters with good access to recent literature chose a different approach to their topic than those on the geographical and social margins of the intellectual world who had only a limited knowledge of current academic trends and debates. The study describes a world of chorographical writings, which fluctuated between the poles of ‘professional’ and ‘amateur’ history, and examines their significance for the writing of urban and regional identities. Over time these poles drifted further apart, leading to the situation where by the eighteenth century regional and urban descriptions had become the preoccupation of the erudite amateur antiquarians. The writings in the Southern Netherlands present a similar pattern with both amateurs, who were very often members of the Catholic clergy, and academics contributing to the development of the genre. Here, however, interest in the production of such texts surged during the reign of the Archdukes, but was less widespread in the later decades of the seventeenth century. As has been frequently pointed out by historians of the Southern Netherlands, those concerned to promote a distinct version of history and identity in the Southern provinces under Habsburg rule often used other means of than texts to convey their unifying message, exploiting processions and spectacles and the visual arts.46 Moreover, chorographers in neither Flanders nor Brabant could draw on a distinct medieval tradition of urban chronicles.47 The chorographical texts, however, which were available, responded to the same intellectual demands on 45 Markus Völkel, ‘Hugo Grotius’ Grollae obsidio cum annexis von 1629: Ein frühneuzeitlicher Historiker zwischen rhetorischer (Text) und empirischer Evidenz (Kartographie)’. The quote is taken from Woolf, ‘From Hystories to the Historical’, p. 46. 46 See, for instance, Margit Thǿfner, A Common Art: Urban Ceremonial in Antwerp and Brussels during and after the Dutch Revolt, Zwolle (Waanders) 2007.

Here, too, changes over time are clearly detectable. With an intensity equal to that in the North, Southern chorographers sought to convey a distinct picture of identity which often highlighted similarities between town, cities and regions of the Habsburg Netherlands more than differences. This did not, however, exclude competition and rivalry between cities and provinces from these images. At the end of the seventeenth century, the chorographical genre went into decline. This was, perhaps, partly due to the fact that by then the identity of the two Netherlandish states, and of the cities and provinces within these states, was well established and the eruptions of the Eighty Years’ War had abated. Although the Low Countries remained the contested battlefield of the all too frequent European wars of the eighteenth century, identity in the North and in the South became more or less fixed. Border conflicts were just that: conflicts between two distinctly different states. In terms of genre interest now focused on a national narrative history, which in the Dutch Republic was championed by authors such as Jan Wagenaar, whose multivolume Vaderlandsche Historie set the agenda for prominent national texts in the United Provinces.48 While the production of chorographies still continued to some extent, it was replaced by national histories on the one hand, presented in the North increasingly through the prism of the province of Holland, and on the other, by a more pronounced use of antiquarianism to present artefacts, coins, heraldry and genealogy, separate from historical accounts as was done for example by Gerard van Loon and Frans van Mieris.49 In the Southern Netherlands Lecuppre-Desjardin (eds.), Villes des Flandres et d’Italie (XIIIe–XVIe Siècle), Turnhout (Brepols) 2008, pp. 149–164. 48 Jan Wagenaar, Vaderlandsche Historie, vervattende de geschiedenissen der nu Vereenigte Nederlanden, 21 volumes, Amsterdam (Isaak Tirion) 1749–1759. It is telling, however, that Wagenaar started his career in history as city historian of Amsterdam. He also wrote a study on the city commissioned by Amsterdam’s regents: Amsterdam in zyne opkomst, aanwas, geschiedenissen . . . beschreeven, Amsterdam 1760–1767. A Southern equivalent to Wagenaar’s study was not produced at the time.

Earlier studies still fell within the domain of monastic and ecclesiastical history and were written by members of the Jesuit and other orders, who utilized older historiographical traditions such as hagiography and episcopal calendars in search of a complete survey of the areas under review.50 This strategy of combining hagiography and church history in its Counter-Reformation form with chorography was characteristic of the writings produced by the members of orders who were actively engaged in historiography, notably the Jesuits and the Benedictines, in the seventeenth century. Their historiographical strategies have, so far, not been adequately researched for the Habsburg Netherlands.51 Simon Ditchfield has offered valuable insights into the development and interplay of both genres in Italy; Stefan Benz has extensively covered Catholic historiography in the Holy Roman Empire (with a limited interest in its western fringes).52 An assessment of these genres and their influence on the literature produced for and in the Habsburg Netherlands in the seventeenth century is therefore still needed. The presentation of the material in this study is necessarily selective. The analysis will focus on particular chorographies written in praise of cities and of some provinces in both parts of the Low Countries.53 Selection criteria are based on a grid of synchronic and diachronic categories. The lowest common denominator chosen was publication:\n\nThe Hague (Christiaan van Lom) 1723–1731; Frans van Mieris, Beschrijving der Bisschoppelijke munten en zegelen van Utrecht, Leiden (Luchtman, Haak, Langerak) 1726. 50 See for instance Jean Bertholet, ‘Histoire de l’église et de la Principauté de Liége.

This excludes texts from distinct groups within urban society such as patrician families, who left substantial, usually handwritten Hausbücher, which were handed down and continued from generation to generation and which have been the focus of much scholarly research in Germany in recent years.54 The present approach, however, guarantees that the books in question were actually written to be circulated, displayed and read (or viewed) by citizens and visitors, and can therefore be seen as a conscientious effort by the urban and provincial elite to influence memories and, by extension, the creation of an identity of their own city or province. In terms of choice, both quantity of output and the variety of different cities and provinces covered have been important. In the first chapter, a sample of three Amsterdam chorographies from the beginning, the peak period and the decline of the chorographical production in the city discusses both the establishment of a thematic canon of key events in Amsterdam’s past and changes to this canon over the period of eighty years. In many ways Amsterdam’s early chorographers set the agenda for a recurring repertoire of themes, not just related to the history of the city, but to the Dutch Republic as a whole, and which was adapted or challenged by the topographical-historical descriptions written elsewhere in the United Provinces. While the Dutch Revolt (and notably its early years) lay at the heart of this interpretation, earlier events and key figures in Netherlandish (and, indeed, in European) Roman and medieval history such as Charlemagne or Saint Willibrord became permanent members of the established group of heroes (or villains) of the Dutch cause. The Amsterdam sample will also bring to light changing patterns of the inclusion and exclusion of other commemorative\n\n54 See, for instance, Heiko Droste, Schreiben über Lüneburg.

Moreover, the study of the three books written by Johannes Isacius Pontanus, Olfert Dapper and Caspar Commelin offers insights into the changing conventions of the genre over the same period and into the way in which these authors responded to and to some extent even shaped, these changes. As has been pointed out, chorographies were not produced in a vacuum. Works written in praise of a city were often constructed in competition with similar texts by their neighbours, who, in spite of the considerable rhetoric of unity employed in public texts printed particularly in the early years of the Eighty Years’ War, were often seen as economic and political rivals. For neighbouring Haarlem, Amsterdam posed a genuine threat to its economic position within Holland and the wider Dutch Republic. Haarlem’s chorographers, therefore, attempted to compete with Amsterdam’s economic power through reference to the city’s heroic role in the early phase of the Dutch Revolt and to its wider international role in the Middle Ages thus constructing an alternative model of commemoration which showed Haarlem in the best possible light. Here, again, the wealth of material written in praise of the city offers the opportunity for a diachronic analysis which complements the synchronic comparison with Amsterdam’s chorographical scene, and which charts change over time in the form and content of the city’s historical-topographical surveys. The chorographical output of Haarlem under review here also includes a range of authors from different backgrounds, namely the works of a minister, Samuel Ampzing, a rector of Haarlem’s Latin School, Theodor Schrevelius, and a most unlikely candidate, the water engineer and dike builder Jan Adriaenszoon Leeghwater. In order to move beyond a hollandocentric perspective and so achieve the desired wider survey the chorographical coverage of Nijmegen, a city outside the western centres of power in the Dutch Republic in the province of Gelderland, has been chosen to add another piece to the chorographical jigsaw in the Northern Netherlands. Nijmegen was one of the political and economic losers of the Eighty Years’ War. We shall see how that city’s historians, notably father and son Johannes Smetius, both ministers at Nijmegen, came to terms, in their writings about the city, with challenges of decline. This chapter also adds an important dimension to the study of the genre, which is not restricted\n\npartition, continuity and change\n\n23\n\nto this case study in Gelderland: the Smetius family was prominently involved in the publication and dissemination of Nijmegen’s Roman archaeological discoveries. Smetius senior was particularly concerned with new ways in which to read and to display the material remains found in his city, which also informed his writings about Nijmegen. The second part of the present study then offers a Southern complement to the Dutch cases. It looks first at Antwerp’s chorographies. In many ways Amsterdam could be constructed as Antwerp’s economic and cultural successor.55 Yet, while the prevailing view among recent scholars is that Antwerp’s loss was Amsterdam’s gain, the actual decline of Antwerp was still relative. Under the Archdukes, the city undoubtedly blossomed culturally. The analysis will show how Antwerp’s chorographers responded to the changing role of a city, ideologically fortified by its Habsburg rulers as a Marian bastion of the CounterReformation.56 Here, again, three studies from the second decade of the seventeenth century and from the 1660s offer a cross section of the strategies employed by Antwerp’s chorographers. While Antwerp’s historians had to defend the city’s position in the seventeenth-century Low Countries against the shadow of decline, neighbouring Leuven was confronted with a similar dilemma, one which was tackled by arguably the most erudite intellectual of the time, in spite of his being at first sight an unlikely candidate for texts written in chorographical style: Justus Lipsius. Together with the following chapter on the Flemish town of Geraardsbergen, the study of Lovanium offers an insight into the changing conventions in the 55 See, for instance, Oscar Gelderblom, Zuid-Nederlandse kooplieden en de opkomst van de Amsterdamse stapelmarkt (1578–1630), Hilversum (Verloren) 2000; Patrick O’Brien et al. (eds.), Urban Achievement in Early Modern Europe. Golden Ages in Antwerp, Amsterdam and London, Cambridge (Cambridge University Press) 2001. 56 In her subtle analysis of the roles that the city and the court ascribed to themselves and to each other for public ceremonies, Margit Thøfner has recently reminded us that the civic authorities were not the passive victims of Habsburg initiatives, but had room for manoeuvre in which they could draft an urban image that responded to current policies and politics: see Margit Thǿfner, A Common Art: Urban Ceremonial in Antwerp and Brussels during and after the Dutch Revolt, Zwolle (Waanders) 2007.

In the case of Geraardsbergen a diachronic approach can again be taken by comparing the three texts covering the town’s history and topography. Jean Baptiste Gramaye, Antonius Sanderus and the lesser known Joannes van Waesberghe offered three different versions of the town’s past and present. Supported and informed by the Counter-Reformation programme chorographies in the South increasingly focused on religious houses, institutions and their clerical personnel thus elevating urban and regional space to sacred space sanctified through the presence of the Habsburg’s special patroness, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and defended by their pious overlords. In its third part, the book will move from the urban to the provincial scenario of chorographical writings in the Low Countries. The focus here is on the way maps and descriptions of landscapes, their borders and their inhabitants were presented in these works. Given the origins of the genre which combined history and geography, it can be argued that chorographical productions owed much of their success to the rise of cartography and map making at the time, fields in which the Low Countries and particularly some of the prominent publishing houses in Amsterdam, excelled. The strategy of combining text and image, and of promoting this as the selling point of the books, as in the frontispieces of the works often advertised, certainly occurred here earlier than in England, where illustrations only appeared in books in considerable numbers from 1655 onwards and even then remained the exception rather than the rule.57 Dutch map makers such as Hendrik Hondius and Johannes Willemsz Blaeu cooperated closely with chorographers such as Marcus Zuerius Boxhorn in Leiden and Antonius Sanderus in Flanders, and provided numerous ‘bird’s-eye’ views of cityscapes and area maps, which made the books eminently marketable to a wider readership.58 Graham Parry, The Trophies of Time, p. 361. The literature on map making in the Netherlands has traditionally been produced by geographers and cartographers. An in-depth analysis of maps and images in chorographical studies is still missing.

It was here, and notably in Northern Brabant, where the war was fought in the seventeenth century. More precisely, it was here that it ground to a halt and degenerated into a series of sieges and counter-sieges, with little gain on either side and with no clear narrative of success or failure. The fortified border town of ’s-Hertogenbosch, for instance, suffered two epic sieges: in 1602, when it became part of the Spanish Netherlands, and in 1629, when it was captured by Frederick Henry. Chorographers on both sides of the border found it equally difficult to incorporate the chequered history of the region into one narrative. Here, more than anywhere else, they relied on oblivion, and blanked out large parts of a story, which did not fit easily into a Northern or Southern context. Joan Blaeu produced two different versions of his atlas project, Novum ac magnum theatrum Belgicae, for the two Netherlandish constituencies. In the case of Breda the Dutch cartographer simply issued different accounts of the two sieges of the city which suffered a fate similar to ’s-Hertogenbosch, in the two cartographies of the Low Countries.59 In the atlas covering the Northern Netherlands (including the Generality Lands), he showed an engraving of the siege of the city by the Dutch army in 1637 and accompanied the image with a republication of Marcus Boxhorn’s account of the siege, which ended in a Dutch victory.60 But for the Southern readers, he incorporated Hugo Herman’s account of the siege of Breda by Spanish forces under General Spinola which led to the surrender of the city in 1625.61 Here, the text was accompanied by an image of the Spanish siege of the city. In this way Blaeu flattered each of his potential readerships by giving them their desired version of history, while drawing a veil over painful memories of failure and loss. Chorographers applied the same techniques to their surveys.\n\nannexis von 1629: Ein frühneuzeitlicher Historiker zwischen rhetorischer (Text) und empirischer Evidenz (Kartographie)’.

At the same time, however, the study will demonstrate that these identities did not express themselves in two monolithic versions of self and Other, but that memories, and therefore identities varied considerably among the different participants of each warring party. Centre and periphery, winners and losers, each offered their interpretations of past events and their own role within them. The study thus cautions against simplistic labels of what might constitute a common identity. If this is achieved, it might help to create a better understanding not just of the management of memories in early modern societies, but also in the contested spaces of our own contemporary world.\n\nPart I\n\nThe North\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nTHE JEWEL IN THE CROWN: AMSTERDAM AND ITS HISTORIANS Any discussion of Dutch town histories in the seventeenth century will inevitably begin with the ‘jewel in the [urban] crown’ of the United Provinces. Amsterdam was undoubtedly the most dynamic urban centre in the Netherlands (and probably in the whole of Western Europe) in this period.1 The meteoric rise of the city to become one of the few truly cosmopolitan metropolises in early modern Europe had been by no means foreseeable. In the sixteenth century Amsterdam was not the most prominent city in the Netherlands, or even in Holland. Traditionally, Dordrecht was seen as the country’s first city, both in terms of seniority and as the most important port of the North Sea trade in the Middle Ages. Since the mid-fifteenth century Amsterdam had ranked second in the province as a major port with a deep, navigable harbour and good waterways to and from the regional centres further inland. In terms of industry, neighbouring Haarlem and Leiden were stronger and more prominent than Amsterdam. From 1575 Leiden also gained a new prominence as the United Provinces’ centre of learning, with the newly established university. Moreover, Amsterdam had remained loyal to the Habsburg authorities until the Alteratie of 1578 and could, therefore, not claim a leading role in the Dutch Revolt. On the contrary, the city had to struggle to shed the image of a reluctant rebel who had preferred the profits gained from supporting Spanish forces under the Duke of Alva to the sacrifices for religious freedom and independence that other Dutch towns and cities had been prepared to make. It will be shown in the following pages how town historians managed to play down Amsterdam’s unheroic role in the early phase of the uprising and to re-write the city’s past in accordance with the leadership position that it achieved in the Golden Age. Since the Middle Ages Amsterdam had enjoyed considerable autonomy in political and legal matters. The four burgomasters, the governing body of the city, were not elected by the city council, but chosen by 1 For a detailed history of Amsterdam see Marijke Carasso-Kok et al. (eds.), Geschiedenis van Amsterdam, vols. 1–4, Amsterdam (SUN) 2004–2007.\n\n30\n\nchapter one\n\ntheir peers and predecessors. Politics were thus made by a small elite which exercised supreme power in the city. Similarly, the 36 members of the city council were elected by co-option. With the establishment and rise of trading companies such as the East and West India Companies (the former founded in 1602, the latter in 1621), the North Company (specialized in whaling) and others, close links and overlaps between civic office holders and merchants became a distinct feature of Amsterdam’s political and economic life. These companies also left prominent landmarks in the city’s architecture such as the East and West India Houses in the eastern areas of Amsterdam and the VOC (United East India Company) wharves and warehouses on Oostenburg Island. The economic rise of Amsterdam was undoubtedly stimulated by its role as an international market with links to the rest of the known world. At the same time, Amsterdam profited from a strong and highly developed regional economy both in Holland and elsewhere in the Dutch Republic, which allowed a degree of specialization unsurpassed elsewhere in the western world and which was praised by contemporary observers.2 The city’s reliance on the highly commercialized agriculture in its hinterland allowed Amsterdam to specialize as a banking and trading centre which could import food and other essential commodities from elsewhere and concentrate on luxury production and overseas enterprises.3 This economic rise, based on a money economy, but also on shipbuilding and adjacent trades for the various overseas trading companies, led to an unprecedented influx of immigrants to the city from the later sixteenth and throughout the seventeenth century. During this period Amsterdam witnessed a dramatic demographic growth, beginning in 1585 with the fall of Antwerp into the hands of Spanish troops, and followed by a wave of emigration of merchants, entrepreneurs and skilled artisans to the North.4 This high 2 See, for instance, William Temple, Observations upon the United Provinces of the Netherlands, London 1673, reprinted Oxford (Oxford University Press) 1972, p. 116. 3 Clé Lesger, ‘Clusters of achievement: the economy of Amsterdam in its golden age’, in: Patrick O’Brien et al.

See also his The Rise of the Amsterdam market and information exchange: merchants, commercial expansion and change in the spatial economy of the Low Countries, c.1550–1630, Aldershot (Ashgate) 2006. 4 Older studies such as J.G. van Dillen’s analysis of Amsterdam’s VOC membership and Wilfried Brulez’ work on Antwerp’s merchant exodus after 1585 have painted a picture of an already successful, rich merchant elite which transferred their money, networks and expertise to Amsterdam and thus facilitated the economic rise of the\n\nthe jewel in the crown: amsterdam and its historians 31\n\nlevel of immigration from the South continued throughout the 1590s and early decades of the seventeenth century and certainly in its later stages cannot be attributed simply to the religious persecutions of Calvinists (and other Protestants) and the war in the Spanish Habsburg possessions. The major motive for migration after 1590 was economic: better employment opportunities in Amsterdam (and other cities, particularly in Holland and Zeeland), higher wages and some easing of guild restrictions.5 From the 1620s onwards, the rapid demographic growth of the city was predominantly fed by economic migrants from the eastern provinces, Scandinavia and the German territories on the Dutch borders, who found employment as sailors on the growing number of ships of the expanding Dutch East and West India Companies, as day labourers and skilled artisans in the city’s dockyards and warehouses, in the hospitality trade or as maid-servants, tavern-maids and prostitutes.6 After the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, substantial immigration from German Lutheran and Calvinist territories began. In just over one hundred years, Amsterdam’s population grew from 13,500 inhabitants in 1514 to 104,900 in 1622 and an estimated 140,000 (and rising) in 1647.7 Initially Amsterdam reacted to this influx with a rather unregulated building boom around the old city walls and canals. Soon, however, the city authorities had to respond to growth in population and took decisive steps towards a more regulated urban city. These studies, however, do not correspond with more recent findings. The majority of the southern exiles were young men at the beginning of their careers rather than wealthy merchants with a broad experience in international trade.

In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, the far-sighted burgomaster Willem Baerdesen8 took a particular interest in the city’s dockland areas, the Lastage, just outside the city’s St. Anthonispoort, which saw a regeneration along the geometrical lines already applied by the town planner Gilbert van Schoonbeke in Antwerp’s urban developments in 1549–52.9 This area was particularly attractive for newcomers working in the shipbuilding trade also established there. Similarly, the area around the Haarlemmerpoort saw the establishment of a new urban quarter. Other initiatives for more regulated building programmes were based on military considerations. Extensions to the city walls and further fortifications were planned and undertaken in 1586 between today’s Heerengracht and Keizersgracht in the west of the city. The building and development boom peaked in the time of the Twelve Years’ Truce, was then halted by the resumption of the war with Spain and the Dutch involvement in the Thirty Years’ War, but gathered new momentum after 1648. There were several milestones in Amsterdam’s urban expansion and public building programmes: the completion of the new East India House in 1606 and the Bourse, the Exchange, in 1611 (both built and designed by Amsterdam’s civic architect and sculptor Hendrick de Keyser); the completion of six new Calvinist churches around the Nieuwe and Oude Kerk in the 1620s and early 1630s, one of which, the Westerkerk, was for several decades the largest purpose-built Protestant church in Europe,10 and, most famously, the new Town Hall, designed by Holland’s leading classicist architect of the mid-seventeenth century, Jacob van Campen, and officially inaugurated with much pomp and ceremony in 1655 (although more painting and decorating work was carried out during the late 1650s and 1660s). These architectural developments were complemented by an extension to the grachten gordel, the canal system, with the establishment of the Heerengracht (for Amsterdam’s prosperous elite) in 1613, the Jordaan (for the city’s less prosperous inhabitants, but also for indigenous and immigrant artisans and their 8 The popular and influential Baerdesen was burgomaster in 1578–1579, 1581– 1582, 1584, 1586, 1589, 1592, 1594, 1597 and 1601. 9 For a recent summary of Amsterdam’s city planning and development in the seventeenth century see Marjolein ’t Hart, ‘The glorious city: monumentalism and public space in seventeenth-century Amsterdam’, in: Patrick O’Brien et al.

By the 1650s the recently developed new areas were again at bursting point. A new civic initiative in 1658 organized a further extension of the city which was completed in 1660. Earlier projects, especially after the first AngloDutch War (1652–1654), had particularly focused on a refurbishment of fortifications, but decisive steps were eventually taken in the light of continuing demographic growth. Extensions now focused on the eastern side of the city with the development of Kattenburg, Wittenburg and Oostenburg, designed specifically to house the workers of the ever-expanding shipbuilding industry. (Kattenburg was the domain of the Admiralty, while Oostenburg was in the hands of the VOC.) The unprecedented influx of immigrants and the new building projects in the city led to distinct changes in the social appropriation of urban space in Amsterdam. Before the 1600s the city was more or less indistinguishable from most other early modern western European urban centres, with a distinct central square around which key institutions—the Nieuwe Kerk, the Waag, the Stadhuis and the Bourse—were located, and whose main streets housed the most prominent members of the civic community. In Amsterdam, this area had the additional advantage of its closeness to the harbour, which gave merchants the opportunity to keep in close contact with the international mercantile world. A stroll along the Damrak would satisfy their curiosity as to the latest ships and their cargoes coming and going. The 1660s and early 1670s witnessed a building boom in the upper segments of the real estate market which took advantage of the new extensions to the city. Many of the spacious and richly decorated ‘merchant palaces’ on Amsterdam’s Heerengracht, Rapenburgergracht and other canals were built in these times of prosperity. In the second part of the seventeenth century the city’s elite—including some prosperous Jewish merchants11—made a clear move towards the hitherto open spaces further away from the centre, giving themselves the opportunity to show off their wealth with ambitious and expensive architectural projects. Amongst the immigrant population of Amsterdam, Portuguese Jews played a prominent part in the mercantile sector. Their number grew from approximately 300 Sephardims in 1610 to 900 in 1630, 1,400\n\n11 Uniquely in early modern Europe, Jews in Amsterdam had the right to own real estate.\n\n34\n\nchapter one\n\nin 1650 and 2,230 in 1675, by then also including Eastern European Ashkenazim and German Jews.12 While the Sephardim settled in the Vlooyenburg area between the Town Hall and the Lastage, the poorer Ashkenazim were housed in Uilenburg, on the outer margins of the Vlooyenburg quarter. As members of an international mercantile elite who brought their connections with Portugal, Spain and their overseas colonies to the city, the prosperous Jews enjoyed considerable recognition and tolerance in the city. A first Sephardim Synagogue, which used Portuguese and Castilian as the languages of worship, was established in 1612. After protests by the Calvinist church consistory, its services were officially forbidden, but tolerated nevertheless. The Portuguese Synagogue built by city architect Elias Boumans between 1671 and 1675 was the largest in the world at the time, and became a tourist attraction. In 1642, the Ashkenazim opened their own Synagogue, which held services in High German, in houses in the Vlooyenburg area. A much larger Ashkenazim house of worship, the Great Synagogue, was subsequently opened in 1672. Amsterdam was a late-comer to the Dutch Revolt. The city stood firm behind its Spanish overlords until 1578 and only then joined the Orangist forces after what can be described as a coup by the city’s militias.13 In a non-violent act, the Catholic establishment and its clerics were expelled from the city, whose new regents declared Calvinism the main confession in Amsterdam.14 Two years later, in 1580, Catholic masses were official declared unlawful. However, Amsterdam’s confessional policy was based on toleration, which was extended not just to Catholics, but to other Christian sects and denominations, and also to Jews. All but the Catholics were allowed public spaces for worship. Careers in the city, however, were reserved for members, or at least liefhebbers (sympathisers without official links), of the Calvinist church. By the end of the seventeenth century Amsterdam was a city of striking modernity.

The 2,500 lanterns could be lit within 15 minutes. From the 1670s onwards, an improved drainage system advanced by burgomaster Hudde helped to reduce the stench of the canals during the summer. It was these dramatic changes in Amsterdam’s cityscape—as much as the town’s meteoric rise to become Europe’s leading entrepôt for world trade and one of its most important banking centres—that stimulated municipal authorities and the powerful East India Company to promote the composition and publication of chorographical works in praise of their city.
