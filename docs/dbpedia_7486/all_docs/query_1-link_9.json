        "text": "In the Low Countries the Reformation and the Revolt caused significant changes to the existing urban memory landscape. Their religious, social and political implications had had a devastating impact on the physical surroundings in cities. Buildings, statues and paintings were demolished, destroyed, and removed. Processions were curtailed and abolished, but also rerouted out of fear for the safety of relics. Depending on who controlled a city or region, these changes were either temporary or permanent. Both Calvinists and Catholics wished to eliminate each other’s symbols, and were eager to (re)build their own. The physical alterations to the urban landscape, from town halls to churches and from gates to statues could therefore represent an act of forgetting or commemoration. The aim of this paper is to consider these physical changes to a city’s appearance in order to understand what the destruction, demolition or removal meant for different groups in the urban community. In the Dutch Republic Catholics, for instance, continued to visit the sites of demolished chapels and churches to celebrate mass or to commemorate the past. In this case the Dutch Revolt only added another layer of commemoration, while the intention had been to remove Catholic memories from the site. Even with no visible traces of the past left standing, many places thus still reminded people of the Revolt.\n\nEdited by Erika Kuijpers, Judith Pollmann, Johannes Müller, and Jasper van der Steen Many students of memory assume that the practice of memory changed dramatically around 1800; this volume shows that there was much continuity as well as change. Premodern ways of negotiating memories of pain and loss, for instance, were indeed quite different to those in the modern West. Yet by examining memory practices and drawing on evidence from early modern England, France, Germany, Ireland, Hungary, the Low Countries and Ukraine, the case studies in this volume highlight the extent to which early modern memory was already a multimedia affair, with many political uses, and affecting stakeholders at all levels of society.

But whereas historians often focus on the precursors of modern banking institutions, little is known of any alternatives that may have served similar purposes prior to their rise. This study focuses on the institutional framework of markets for 'renten', a type of long-term debt that enabled economic development in much of Northwest Europe in the late Middle Ages. In the county of Holland, these markets allowed large segments of the public and private sectors to reallocate capital. This study thus uncovers the medieval capital markets in the region that was to become the core of the Dutch Republic.\n\nOver a period of two hundred years, between c. 1450 and c. 1650, the Catholic religious literature of Delft in the Netherlands underwent consecutive stages of growth, crisis and (to a certain extent) rebirth. All this occurred in the face of relentless social, political and cultural change, and amidst alternating periods of stability and turmoil. Yet despite a number of setbacks, Delft's Catholic religious literature displayed a surprising continuity, not only surviving, but even attaining a small 'Golden Age' of its own in the first decades of the 17th century. This study documents that 'struggle for survival' by presenting a broad synthesis of the production and reception of Catholic religious literature in Delft within a range of literary-historical and cultural contexts. Sleutelwoorden: Delft, kerkgeschiedenis, religie en literatuur, middeleeuwen, vroegmoderne periode.\n\nThis article asks why until the mid-twentieth century both Catholic and Protestant interpretations of the iconoclasm converged on the anonymising of the iconoclasts of 1566. It argues that, while a greater availability of sources, better source criticism and international debates helped eventually to give the iconoclasts a face, the main reason why it has took so long for the image-breakers to lose their anonymity was that it was in no one’s interest to identify the culprits. For centuries, Protestants considered the iconoclasm an embarrassment, and preferred to dismiss its perpetrators as ‘rabble’, while Catholics in the Southern Netherlands tended to dismiss them as foreigers, manipulated by the nobility. Their anonymity was lifted through the intervention of German historian Erich Kuttner, whose main thesis was proven wrong, but at last triggered serious research into the identity of the iconoclasts, as well as alternative explanations of their motives."
