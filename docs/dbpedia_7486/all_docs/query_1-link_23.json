        "text": "Neo-Babylonian policy in the late 7th- 6th c. BCE central coastal Levant is often reduced to generalizations based on Josephus’ accounts, and biblical representations of Phoenician cities are still brought to bear on the topic as historical truths. In particular, discussions of Phoenicia in this period tend to focus on the diminishing commercial significance of Tyre in the wake of Nebuchadnezzar II’s purported 13-year siege of that city, thought to have ended in the late 570s BCE. While Assyriologists have long been dubious about the plausibility of this siege (not directly mentioned in any Mesopotamian source), little has been done to reevaluate the likelihood of this military event using local Levantine evidence. In this paper, I collect all explicit textual references to a Neo-Babylonian siege of Tyre, alongside all texts thought to indirectly reflect the impact of the siege (e.g. references to Nebuchadnezzar’s building projects in Tyre itself), and evaluate them in light of the contemporary, extant archaeological and mortuary evidence from Tyre and its Levantine dependents. This reanalysis shows that a land blockade of the island of Tyre is more likely than the 13-year military siege described in later literary texts, while highlighting the difficulties of separating legend from historical reality in this period in the Levant. When this revised understanding is examined alongside the Hoftkalender Prism and Nebuchadnezzar II’s inscriptions at Wadi esh-Sharbin (along with three others at the Nahr el-Khalb and in the Beqaa), our picture of Neo-Babylonian “policy” in Phoenician territory can be considerably refined.\n\nThis paper reconstructs the transmission of the letter from the “obedient Borsippans” to the Assyrian king Assurbanipal (r. 669-631 BC), which - unusually for a letter to an Assyrian king - is attested on a clay tablet dating to the first century BC. Drawing on the text of the letter itself and on information contained in the tablet's scribal notes, it focuses on three moments in the letter’s “life”: the senders’ original intentions in writing the letter; the context in which the surviving manuscript, the tablet BM 45642, was produced; and the inscription of the letter onto a stone monument at some point prior to the production of BM 45642. It is argued that the object onto which the letter was inscribed was a stele rather than a stone tablet, and that it could have been displayed in the main courtyard of the E-zida temple in Borsippa on the occasion of Antiochus III’s visit to Borsippa in 187 BC."
