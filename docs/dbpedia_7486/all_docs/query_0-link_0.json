He was born on 13 November 1991 in Alphen aan den Rijn, Netherlands.\n\nLeon’s career took off in Houten, where the footballer performed at all youth levels and played for various junior squads. De Kogel netted 25 goals in his last youth season, which drew the attention of different top-flight teams.\n\nAt the beginning of 2010, the striker penned a three-and-a-half-year contract with Utrecht, where he continues to perform up till now. Leon’s senior début came on 12 September 2010 in the away 1-0 loss to Groningen. Five months later, on 6 February 2011, the footballer fired his first goal in the 1-1 draw with Twente.\n\nDe Kogel took part in 17 fixtures and found the net three times for Utrecht as of November 2012.\n\nIn 2010, the striker received a call-up to the Netherlands national U-19 squad for the match against Germany.
