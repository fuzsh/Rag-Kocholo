        "text": "Sustainability of human activities is one of the most important concerns of the European Union. Consequently, the need to assess the level of sustainability achieved both at local and at government level is increasing. This process involves all economic sectors, including agriculture and, in particular, livestock. Until several years ago livestock production systems were mainly focused on production efficiency and qualitative characteristics of meat. However, nowadays rules regarding animal welfare and environmental impact are becoming more and more compulsory and require attention by all the poultry chain. European subsidies are in many cases linked to an environmentally sound behaviour of farms. However, there is still an ongoing discussion regarding the definition of sustainable-agriculture strategic objectives, the criteria to take into account, the actions to develop, and the methodological tools to use for the evaluation. This chapter provides suggestions for improving the environmental evaluation part of a process of sustainability assessment specific for intensive poultry production. The environmental sustainability of an intensive poultry-rearing system is evaluated through the use of three different methods: Emergy Evaluation, Ecological Footprint Analysis and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). For each of the three methods a review of its application in agriculture, and specifically in poultry breeding, is presented. Through Emergy Evaluation we found that diet is the most important impact factor for the analysed system, accounting for more than 82% of the total emergy flow. Our results obtained from Ecological Footprint Analysis point out that cropland, which is connected with chicken diet, is the main land component in the indicator, accounting for 73% of the total. Particularly, the high quantity of maize and soya needed for feed requires much cropland. Finally, using LCA, we found that feed production is the element which contributes the most to the environmental impacts of the system, influencing the impact category ‘land use’. As Ecological Footprint, LCA regards the cultivation and the transformation of maize and soya as the processes with the strongest impact. Therefore, although the three methods use specific indicators and methodology, they come to the same conclusions for the system investigated. After applying each method to the poultry system, we propose a comparative analysis between the three methods, based on four different criteria: representativeness, verifiability, reproducibility, comprehensibility. By comparing the methods according to these criteria, we found that each of them shows both positive and negative aspects, strengths and weaknesses, but all of them are effective in representing the environmental features of a given activity, and the results can be used as input in the sustainability assessment process. The choice to use Emergy Evaluation, Ecological Footprint Analysis, or LCA can depend upon the main objective of the assessment process. However, in many cases it is not necessary a choice because the three methods can be used together, and the results can be integrated to build combined indicators, capable to ensure a wide and complete analysis.\n\nSalinity has been an important historical factor which has influenced the life span of agricultural systems. Around 10% of the total cropped land surface is covered with different types of salt-affected soils and the Asian continent accounts for the largest area affected by the salinity of various intensities. Cyanobacteria are capable of not only surviving, but thriving in conditions which are considered to be inhabitable, tolerating desiccation, high temperature, extreme pH and high salinity, illustrating their capacity to acclimatise to extreme environments. Until recently, the responses of cyanobacteria to salinity stresses were poorly documented as compared to heterotrophic bacteria and phototrophic eukaryotic algae. Cyanobacteria can be used to reclaim alkaline soils and fertility can be improved for subsequent cultivation of cereal crops, sugarcane and horticultural crops. Therefore we present here a review on cyanobacterial reclamation of salt-affected soil. Substantial progress has been made towards better understanding of the physiological mechanisms responsible for salinity tolerance and osmotic adjustment in cyanobacteria. Many researchers throughout the world have worked on probable mechanisms of salt tolerance studies in cyanobacteria. These organisms evolved about 3,000 million years ago and are considered to be the primary colonisers of the inhospitable ecosystems. The physiological aspects for the adaptation of cyanobacteria to high salinities include (a) synthesis and accumulation of osmoprotective compounds, (b) maintenance of low internal concentrations of inorganic ions and (c) expression of a set of salt-stress proteins. Exposure of cyanobacterial cells to different abiotic stresses resulted in rapid expression of several stress-regulated proteins and modifications in protein synthesis programme. The synthesis of organic solutes like disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose and glucosyl glycerol), quaternary amines (glycine betaine) and free amino acids (glutamine) are well-documented. The protection against alkaline environment is provided by the synthesis of specific fatty acids, sucrose- and osmotic-stress-induced proteins. In cyanobacteria, accumulation of internal osmoticum in the form of inorganic ions and prevention of intracellular Na+ accumulation by the curtailment of Na influx and by efficient active efflux mechanisms or metabolic adjustments have been investigated in depth. The Na+ extrusion in cyanobacteria is driven by a Na+/H+ antiporter, which is energised by enhanced activity of cytochrome oxidase. The inhibition of sodium ion influx appears to be a major mechanism for the survival of cyanobacteria against salt stress and synthesis of salt-stress proteins have been found in cyanobacteria. These organisms have been recognised as an important agent in the stabilisation of soil surfaces primarily through the production of extracellular polysaccharides which are prominent agents in the process of aggregate formation and increase in soil fertility. Cyanobacterial application results in the enrichment of soil with fixed nitrogen, soil structure improvement and declining trend of pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and Na+. The extracellular polysaccharides excreted by cyanobacteria have been reported to be responsible for binding of soil particles, thus, leading to the formation of a tough and entangled superficial structure that improves the stability of soil surface and protects it from erosion. The potential impact of these organisms on agriculture through their use as soil conditioners, plant growth regulators and soil health ameliorators has been well-recognised. Besides bringing about an improvement in the yield of rice, cyanobacteria produce direct and indirect beneficial changes in the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil and soil–water interface in the rice fields, which are of agronomic importance. Certain cyanobacteria have been found not only to grow in saline ecosystems but also improve the physico-chemical properties of the soil by enriching them with carbon, nitrogen and available phosphorus. Flushing of field may not be effective for the reclamation of saline soils and the addition of cyanobacterium inoculum along with the addition of gypsum is required before irrigation to ameliorate saline soils. Nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can be used as biological input to improve soil texture, conserve moisture, scavenge the toxic sodium cation from the soil complex and improve the properties of soils. Virtually negligible information exists on the genetics of cyanobacterial halotolerance. The presence of combined nitrogen which effectively curtails sodium accumulation and supports extra nitrogen demand for osmoregulation during slat stress confers considerable salt tolerance on cyanobacteria."
