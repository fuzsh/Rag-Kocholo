That her Prologue is reminiscent of both the Office and the Little Office of the Virgin is generally accepted. It is not so commonly recognized that The Prioress' Tale and Prologue, taken together, either quote or refer to all the chief portions of the Mass for 28 December, Childermas or the Feast of the Holy Innocents. The connexion, to be sure, has not been entirely overlooked. For Prioress' Tale 627, where the weeping mother of the dying child is called a new Rachel, Professor Robinson cites Matthew li, 18 and adds: Mr Joseph Dwight has pointed out to the editor that this passage, along with the Psalm Domme Dommus noster , occurs among the portions of Scripture read at the Mass on the Feast of the Holy Innocents. This might account for their association in Chaucer’s mmd, though the comparison of the bereaved mother to Rachel would be natural m itself. 1 In view of all the parallels, however, it seems clear that Chaucer had the Mass of the Innocents in mind when he wrote the tale of the Prioress, that for him and his contemporary readers the story was enriched by association with one of the most appealing feasts of the Church. The purpose of this paper is (1) to illustrate that point, and (2) to suggest that Chaucer’s original source for the legend was a sermon on Innocents’ Day and, in that event, probably a sermon preached by a boy bishop, a little clergeon. In the first place, the hero of The Prioress' Tale is not merely a little child, but rather the representative of childhood itself on the threshold of accountability. To his own generation, nurtured in the melancholy lore of the climacteric ages, 2 Chaucer suggested as much when he changed the age of the boy from ten years or more, as it appears in the other extant versions of the story, to seven years. Modern readers must turn 1 Students’ Cambridge Edition of Chaucer's Complete Works , p. 841. 2 4 The ancient sages by curious notes have found out, that certain yeeres m mans life be very perilous.

The custom flourished in every country of Western Europe, and especially in England and France . 5 In England, according to ecclesiastical records from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries , 6 the boys usurped the places of the deacons and priests for the whole twenty-four hours from Vespers on the eve of the feast to Vespers on Innocents 5 Day. The custom prevailed, with variations, not only in cathedrals and in collegiate and parish churches, but also in schools and religious houses . 7 The fact that the feast to which Chaucer seems to have related his story was conducted partly by children gives heightened significance to the initial stanza of the Prioress 5 Prologue: ‘ 0 Lord, oure Lord, thy name how merveillous Is in this large world ysprad, 5 quod she; 4 For noght oonly thy laude precious Parfourned is by men of digmtee, But by the mouth of children thy bountee Parfourned is, for on the brest soukynge Somtyme she wen they thyn heriynge.’ 1 In Hymns to the Virgin and Christ, The Parliament of Devils , and Other Religious Poems , ed. by Furnivall, EETS, 0 S., 24, 1867, pp. 58-78. a Lines 65-66. 3 Lines 81-85. 4 Leach's phrase. His essay ‘The Schoolboy’s Feast’, in The Fortnightly Review (January 1896), pp. 128-41, still is one of the best short accounts of the boy bishop in England. Chambers gives an ampler account in The Mediaeval Stage, vol. i, chap. 15. See also Young, The Drama of the Mediaeval Church , i, 104-11, and Gayley, Plays of Our Fore- fathers, pp. 54-61.

The Boy Bishop at Salisbury and Elsewhere, 1921. 5 Young, Drama of the Mediaeval Church , I, 106. 6 Some of these are reproduced by Chambers, op. cit vol. n, appendix M. ^ Among institutions where the boy bishop held sway, Chambers (i, 354r-9) mentions Salisbury, Exeter, Lincoln, York, St Paul’s, Lichfield, Gloucester, and Norwich cathedrals; such collegiate churches as Beverley Minster, St Peter’s, Canterbury, and Ottery St Mary; the college chapels of Magdalen and All Souls, Oxford; the private chapels of the King and the Earl of Northumberland, and many parish churches in England and Scotland. MARIE PADGETT HAMILTON 3 This is a rendering of Psalm viii, 2-3, as the caption of the Chaucerian manuscripts, Demine dominus nosier , would indicate; but, as Mr Joseph Dwight realized, it is also a translation of the Introit of the Mass for the Holy Innocents : Ex ore mfantmm, Deus, et laetentmm perfeeisti laudem propter immicos tuos Domine, Dommus noster, quam admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra. 1 By thus changing the order of the verses m the Psalm the liturgy at once strikes the keynote of the feast and places emphasis on the phrase ‘ Out of the mouth of babes 5 , as Chaucer also does by mentioning it again in the story proper, lines 607-8: 0 grete God, that parfournest thy laude By mouth of innocentz, lo, heere thy myght ' The Prioress more than once calls the little clergeon \"this innocent 5 , 2 as in lines 565-6 : Pro thennes forth the dues han conspired This innocent out of this world to chace. Her narrative loses nothing in pathos and sublimity through the analogy here to Herod’s attempt to kill the infant Jesus, an analogy made un- mistakable by the further comment, ‘ 0 cursed folk of Herodes al newe 5 . 3 As might be expected, the Gospel for the Innocents 5 Mass is Matthew ii, 13-18, the account of the flight of the Holy Family into Egypt and of Herod’s slaying the male children in Bethlehem ‘of two years old and under 5 . Chaucer’s reason for laying his scene in Asia, a departure from all extant analogues, may have been to suggest once more the similarity between his story and the account of those earlier Asiatic martyrs. A further connexion between the two was noted by Mr Dwight, this reference of the Prioress to the dying boy’s mother: Unnethe myghte the peple that was theere This newe Rachel brynge fro his beere. 4 The Innocents’ Gospel ends with the prophecy of Jeremiah, now fulfilled in the grief of the bereaved mothers, who are typified by Rachel: tf In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and great mourning: Rachel bewailing her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.’ The Church had decreed that the Feast of the Innocents be kept with purple, and that the Mass be stripped of the Te Deum , the Alleluia , and the Gloria , c out of compassion, as it were, for the sorrowing mothers 1 Since the Mass for Innocents’ Day is essentially the same today as m Chaucer’s time (Catholic Encyclopaedia , under 4 Least of the Holy Innocents’), my quotations are from the Roman Missal m present use. 2 The boys who took part in the Childermas ceremonies quite naturally were known as Innocents (Chambers, i, 347). s Line 573. 4 Lines 626-7. 1-2 4 Echoes of 'Childermas in the Tale of the Prioress of Bethlehem 5 ; 1 and the Communion of the Mass again commemorated their grief by repetition of the verses about Rachel: Vox m Rama audita est , etc. Like the ranting of Herod, played £ on a scaffold hye 5 , the beautiful passage from Jeremiah laid hold on the mediaeval imagination, and the figure of the symbolical Rachel, refusing to be comforted, had a central place in the liturgical dramas dealing with the Slaughter of the Innocents. 2 As the Gospel for Innocents 5 Day tells of the murder of the babes, so the Epistle for the Mass records their triumph over death. It is Apoca- lypse xiv, 1-5, the description of the Celestial Lamb and his followers, the 144,000 virgins. Because St John called these 'the first fruits to God and to the Lamb 5 , they were identified with the victims of Herod, and consequently in the Middle Ages it was commonly held that Herod had killed 144,000 male children in little Bethlehem. 3 4 * 6 The immaculate procession of the Lamb was central m the Canonical Office for Childermas, and the liturgical plays usually opened the scene of the Slaughter of the Innocents with the doomed children carrying or following a lamb and singing the Ecce Agnus Dei or the Emitte Agnum No student of Chaucer need be reminded that Apocalypse xiv, 1-5 was also the inspiration for one of the most affecting stanzas of The Prioress' Tale . There the little boy is said to have joined the Holy Innocents, 5 where without fear of persecution he may sing a new song: 1 Catholic Encyclopaedia , under ‘Feast of the Holy Innocents’. 2 See especially Karl Young, Ordo Rachehs , University of Wisconsin Studies m Lan- guage and Literature, rv, and his Drama of the Mediaeval Church, vol. u, chap. 20. 3 Catholic Encyclopaedia, ‘Feast of the Holy Innocents’. 4 Young, Drama of the Mediaeval Church , i, 102-7, 110-14. Hereafter m this article all footnote references to Young will be citations of this book. 6 According to the description of the seven heavens m the Middle English poem Ipohs , the fourth heaven, which alone is adorned with precious jewels, is reserved for innocents The iiije heven is godeliche, ffull of precious stones & riche; ffor Innocentes pat place is dight, per ever is day & never nyght. ( Ipotis , Trinity Coll Camb. MS B. 2-18, fol. 956, lines 71-4, as printed in PMLA xxiv, 120). Hence there is peculiar appropriateness m Chaucer’s comparison of his innocent to precious stones (11. 609-10) : This gemme of chastite, this emeraude. And eek of martirdom the ruby bright. Compare the child in Pearl. One of the 144,000 brides of the Lamb, Pearl is explicitly identified also with the Holy Innocents, who were ‘of two years old and under’, by em- phasis on the circumstance that she had died before she was two years old {Pearl, sec. 9, st. 41). There is also the legend from Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum Histonale, 6, Col. 99, of the child who shared his bread with an image of the weeping Christ Child, and was rewarded by membership in the company of the Lamb : ‘ The child was seized at once with a fever and died on the third day; wherefore he doth now most undoubtedly feast among the Innocents of Bethlehem’ (translation by Coulton, Life in the Middle Ages, i, 52).

Some details of the liturgy for the mediaeval service conducted by the children on the eve of Innocents’ Day also may be pertinent. The one at Salisbury Cathedral 2 began with a procession during which the boys, as at all other observances of the Canonical Office for Childer- mas, sang the Centum Quadraginta, an arrangement of those verses from the Innocents’ Epistle which Chaucer adapted for describing the celestial triumph of his little schoolboy. The remainder of the liturgy for that service was chiefly in praise of ‘Cristes mooder deere’, comprising pas- sages from the Mass of the Blessed Virgin for the season from Christmas Day to Candlemas . 3 The fact that schoolboys took part in Childermas ceremonies, where Mary was especially honoured in the observances of the Canonical Hours, would help to explain why the older schoolmates of Chaucer’s little clergeon ‘ lerned hire antiphoner 5 at the approach of Christmas, with particular attention to Marian anthems like the Alma Redemptoris Mater . 4 Naturally the little seven-year-old would wish to imitate the older boys who, we may suppose, were preparing to sing at the Innocents’ services; and hence his anxiety to learn the Alma Redemp- toris ‘er Cristemasse be went’. The little fellow’s readiness bo learn is compared to the precocity of St Nicholas : Thus hath this wydwe hir litel sone ytaught Oure blisful Lady, Cristes mooder deere, To worshipe ay, and he forgat it naught, For sely child wol alday soone here. 1 Lines 579-85. 2 The Sarum Office in use there is reproduced by Chambers, vol. n, appendix M, and is the basis of my summary. 3 The Offertory, Felix namque est , sacra Virgo , etc., and the Gradual, Speciosus forma prae filns hommum, etc. 4 The Alma Bedemptoris is the Marian anthem now sung during Christmas week. According to Skeat, the Roman Breviary for 1583 designated it for use at that time — i.e. from Advent to Candlemas. Since the Mass for the Innocents was essentially the same in Chaucer’s time as now, and since the mediaeval ritual for the other Innocents’ services at Salisbury Cathedral was composed of passages of liturgy still m use by the Roman Church during the Christmas season, the presumption is that the Alma Bedemptoris , which was very popular m the Middle Ages, was sung from Advent to Candlemas, then as now. But see Carleton Brown, ‘Chaucer’s Litel Clergeon’, in Modern Philology , m (April 1906), 9-13. 6 Echoes of Childermas in the Tale of the Prioress But ay, whan I remembre on this mateere, Semt Nicholas stant evere m my presence, Bor he so yong to Crist dide reverence. 1 Sfeeat and Robinson give no explanation of this reference beyond the fact, recorded in the Roman Breviary and elsewhere, that Nicholas as an infant at the breast fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays. Hence we may digress to note that Chaucer evidently was thinking also of such passages about him as this from the Vita Sancti Nicholai in the South English Legendary : 1>g he was sethpe of grettore elder to scole he was i-set; So wel he leornede: pat man nuste , no child leorni bet. Sethpe po he more coupe: al his studie he tok to guodespelles ant to holi writes : and alle opere bokes for-sok. 3 Allusions to St Nicholas, although their appropriateness to Chaucer’s narrative needs no justification, are especially germane to the echoes of Childermas in The Prioress' Tale; for the Feast of St Nicholas, 6 Decem- ber, was closely related to Childermas. The boy bishop usually was elected on Nicholas 5 Day, 3 sometimes officiated at the Feast of Nicholas as well as at the Feast of the Holy Innocents, and hence sometimes was called the Nicholas Bishop or Bishop Nicholas. 4 Plays about St Nicholas were regular features of the less solemn festivities of Childermas, 5 and on the eve of the feast the child bishop and his companions marched first to the altar of Nicholas where one was available. 6 Granted that Chaucer related his story to the Feast of the Innocents ‘of ful avysement 5 , why did he do so? The delicate art of the result would be reason enough. Over and above its appeal to all ages, the legend of the little martyr had for the mediaeval mind rich overtones, through association with an ancient ceremonial that honoured the charm and innocence of all childhood and symbolized the grief of all bereaved motherhood, the universal Rachel: Whan seyd was al this miracle, every man As sobre was that wonder was to se. 7 Yet I suspect that the connexion between the feast and the ‘miracle 5 antedates Chaucer’s handling of the theme. The story of the little schoolboy, with its allusions to the slaughtered Innocents and the pre- cocious sanctity of Nicholas, would make an ideal exemplum for a Childermas sermon. As in The Pardoner's Tale , the narrative might have been used as the framework for the whole homily, and the more likely if it had been designed for delivery by a boy bishop. 1 Lines, 509-15.

MARIE PADGETT HAMILTON 7 That the theme of The Prioress’ Tale was employed in sermons is certain. It appears m the Promptuarium (or storehouse of exempla) which Johannes Herolt appended to his Sermones de Tempore et de Sanctis, a collection much in demand during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. 1 Professor Woodburn Ross, in Modern Language Notes for May 1935, 2 gives the text of a hitherto neglected analogue to Chaucer’s story from Bromyard’s popular manual for preachers, the Summa PredicanUum, composed m England, apparently shortly after 1370. On the evidence of that version, of another from the Speculum Exemplorum , and of still another from a book containing sermons, Professor Ross concludes that the story of the chorister or schoolboy murdered by Jews was 'very likely in fairly frequent use as a pulpit exemplum’. This circumstance alone would explain the wide diffusion and popu- larity of the legend, and also, perhaps, Chaucer’s associating it with Childermas. Very likely he first heard the story in a sermon on Innocents’ Day, and thereafter always connected the two. The final invocation of the Prioress to c Yonge Hugh of Lyncoln’ 3 suggests that the scene of the sermon may have been Lincoln Cathedral, where an analogue to the murder of Little St Hugh would have been particularly appropriate for a Childermas exemplum. This is the more probable since Chaucer 'had various reasons for interest m Lincolnshire’. 4 His sister-in-law, Kath- erine Swynford, had a manor there ; and Philippa Chaucer m February 1386 was admitted to the society of patrons of the cathedral. 5 Finally, if Chaucer did hear the story of the Prioress in an Innocents’ sermon, it not improbably was from the lips of a boy bishop. 6 ' In various places in England,’ says Professor Young, 'the Boy Bishop, as part of his assumption of mature responsibility, preached a sermon at Mass.’ 7 Chambers speaks in particular of the custom at St Paul’s, where, not unnaturally, the boy did not write his own sermon. 8 William de Tolle- shunte, almoner of Paul’s, bequeathed to the almonry copies of 'all the quires of sermons for the Feast of the Holy Innocents’ 9 preached by boy bishops in his time, the early part of the fourteenth century.

Indeed, it is not unreasonable to suggest on a cursory reading that Glap- thorne has substituted the ending of one play for that of another and entirely different play. Wit in a Constable was entered in the Stationers' Register on 27 April 1640, strangely enough for a ‘Master Constable 5 , and was printed the same year with the following titlepage : WIT IN / A Constable. / A Comedy written 1639. / The Author / HENRY GLAPTHORNE. / And now printed as it was lately Acted / at the Cock-pit in Drury Lane, by / their Majesties Servants, / with good allowance. / LONDON: / Printed by Io. Okes, for F. C. and / are to be sold at his shops in Kings- / street at the Signe of the Goat, and / in Westminster Hall, 1640. / The name Wit in a Constable may have been devised in deference to the fashion for using the word ‘wit 5 in play titles about 1638, or perhaps from one of these plays, Davenant 5 s The Wits ( acted 1634, printed 1636) to which Glapthorne is indebted for ideas. That its title attracted atten- tion is attested by the jeer of a royalist pamphleteer in Mercurius Auhcus at Thomas Audley, the puritan pamphleteer: ‘What wit in a Puritan? As monstrous as the title of the play “Wit in a Constable 5 . 1 It may have been a popular play, for it was revived at Lincoln’s Inn Fields by the Duke’s Players on 23 May 1662, 2 and five years later Davenant repaid Glapthorne’s borrowings by incorporating ideas from it in his enlarged production of The Wits? Fleay 4 was the first to call attention to certain inconsistencies m the character names, which inconsistencies he attributed to the refurbishing of an older version of the play, suggesting that the older version was written about 1636. Unfortunately, he did not give his reasons for attributing the earlier part to 1636. Further, his statement, Thorough- 1 Quoted without leference by Williams, Hist, of English Journalism , p. 53. 2 Nieoll, Restoration Drama , p. 168. 3 Davenant’s additions were printed m the folio of 1673. 4 Biog. Chron. I, 245. 10 4 Wit in a Constable* : Censorship and Revision good and Tristram in i, n, in become Freewit and Grimes in iv, v ; and the occasional retention of the earlier names in iv, v shows that this was the part of the play rewritten 9 , is only a partial truth. Granted that Acts iv and v have been altered (and so for that matter has Act in), yet it may surely be assumed that a playwright, rewriting the final acts of one of his older plays, does not wantonly add to his labours and con- fuse the actors by introducing at this stage new character names for old. Even supposing that Glapthorne did rewrite Acts iv and v, and did in- tend the names Freewit and Grimes to be used throughout, it is reason- able to expect that he would have inserted some emphatic indication of this in the first three acts. Such indication does not exist in the text as it stands; that it may have existed in the printer’s copy is not impos- sible, but not very likely. There is, however, much more evidence than Fleay noted, evidence that points to a more comprehensive reconstruc- tion of the play than the mere rewriting of certain parts. The names Freewit, Grimes and Luce are omitted from the quarto list of characters, and Nell is described as ‘daughters’ (sic) to Busie, a description obviously intended to include Maudlin. In reality Luce was Busie’s second daughter, and she takes the place of Maudlin, who dis- appears entirely after Act in. These two names obviously refer to the same character. The omission of names from the prefatory list of characters is not always reliable evidence of reconstruction since there are other possible reasons for such omissions. Here the omission is important as it is of a sort with the subsequent textual inconsistencies. It is significant that, apart from this, no trace of any revision or alteration appears before Act in. In the first seventy lines of Act hi Knowell derides Thorowgood and Valentine on being outwitted by Clare and Grace, but offers to help them obtain their revenge. Valentine departs in response to a message from Grace, and Thorowgood instructs Knowell: Pray be you Sir Timothy , know his entrance ; Tis such another mad-cap my Scene is. Enter Holdfast . Hold . Nay, come forward Land lord Spoild else. Trist. Bus. Tis my Cosens lodgings, pray be bold in’t (in, i, p. 199) 1 ‘Spoild else’ is obviously out of place, and its restoration to the end of the preceding line is clearly demanded by the context; but even so the first two lines are corrupt and obscure. They may be taken to mean that 1 The references are to vol. i of the Pearson Eeprint of Glapthorne 5 s Plays and Poems , 2 vote., London, 1874. J. II. WALTER li Knowell is to play the part of Sir Timothy, which, in fact, he makes not the slightest attempt to do. Alternatively, since the two lines are patently corrupt, ‘ be you Sir Timothy ’ may be all that remains of an expression like, ‘be you Sir Timothy’s guide 5 . If so, Knowell 5 s only attempt to carry out Thorowgood's instructions is revealed by his single-line speech, Or [Nor shall] this knight have Valentines reversions, (in, 1 , p. 209) Knowell does not appear in the play after this, unless the speech attri- buted to Thorowgood (v, i, p. 236) should be attributed to him. If not, he appears only twice, on both occasions in Act hi, and this implies that his part has been curtailed. The alignment of the entry notices for Tristram and Busie is peculiar, and suggests either that they were deliberately placed to indicate that Tristram and Busie lag behind Holdfast, which is unlikely, or that the printer was closely following his copy m which Tristram and Busie were later marginal additions to the original entry notice for Young Holdfast. This introduction of Busie to Valentine and Knowell occupies fifty-three lines, which is approximately the number of lines on an average folio manuscript page. It is strange, though not without parallel in other plays of the period, that Constable Busie, so important a figure that the play's title commemorates his quality, should make such a belated entry ; and stranger still that not the slightest mention of him has been made before this. The ensuing conversation between Knowell, Holdfast and Busie is, from the point of view of the plot, practically pointless. It is largely a summary of Busie's character. Such peculiarities and weaknesses by themselves would imply nothing more than faulty construction — though Glapthorne is not usually so careless of his plots — but when they occur in company with textual faults, the most likely explanation is a cut followed by the insertion of fresh matter. hi, i, p. 207 may contain the broken thread of a subplot. Valentine, disguised as Sir Timothy's niece, is escorted in by Grace, and Sir Timothy introduces her to Covet and Clare. Covet remarks aside, A very handsome woman, I conld love her, Did I but know her portion. Mistris welcome. It may not be over-fanciful to see in this an intention at the back of the dramatist's mind to make Covet the victim of a mock marriage (a device he used in The Hollander ), but if so, either he did not develop it, or he was forced to cut it out to make room for other matter. hi, i, p. 208 contains a startlingly abrupt denouement to Valentine and Freewit's revenge plot. Valentine’s part, in fact, has been propounded, developed and concluded within the space of one act. This abruptness 12 ‘ Wit in a Constable Censorship and Revision is not perhaps in itself sufficient warrant for postulating cuts or com- pression, but the following time-analysis of Valentine’s movements, when disguised as Sir Timothy’s niece, reveals that cuts must have taken place. In in, i, p. 206 Sir Timothy explains to Covet that he sent a niece Hither, to view my Mistns m a Coach An houre agoe at least. A few lines farther on (p. 207) Maudlin reports the presence of this niece. Finally, Knowell, after discovering Valentine’s disguise, adds, He has beene here all night too. (p. 209) All this takes place within the same scene; it is not possible to assign these lines to separate scenes. Knowell’s statement passes unchallenged by Clare and Grace, so presumably it is true. Sir Timothy’s ‘ an houre agoe at least’ is vague, but even his addled pate could hardly mistake the day. The inconsistencies can only be reconciled by placing the arrival of the disguised Valentine (m, i, p. 206) on the day before his discovery at the end of the act (p. 209). In this case, some definite scene division between these occasions would be expected, but of such a division there is no trace. Thorowgood’s scholar plot ends at the same time as the revenge plot, and it is remarkable that from this point in the play Thorowgood and Valentine diverge from Young Holdfast and Sir Timothy; they do not again appear on the stage together until the final scene of Act v. Covet’s prose speech which ends Act m (p. 209) is possibly an addition, for he has spoken in verse previously in this scene. Furthermore, the c Exeunt’ which immediately precedes this speech has the appearance of marking the end of a scene, for the characters who go off are not specified, although elsewhere all departing characters are mentioned by name unless all are to go, and the stage is to be left empty for the end of a scene or act. Covet’s ‘Formall send post for Sir Geffrey ’ (p. 209) is a duplication of his earlier statement, lie dispatch A messenger straight to him [i.e. Sir Geffrey], (n, i, p. 186) If Covet’s prose speech is an addition, then this duplication may be taken as a sign that Sir Geffrey’s arrival in Act iv was placed earlier in the original version. In Act iv signs of disturbed text are even more frequent. Luce is now the name of the woman attendant on Grace and Clare. She is obviously the Maudlin of the preceding acts ; the latter name is not used again. Likewise, Grimes is now the name of Young Holdfast’s servant, J. H. WALTER 13 who was previously named Tristram. His character too suffers a change. In Acts i and u as Tristram, he is the witty, satirical servant so frequent in comedies of the period, but after this he does not speak at all though he enters the stage on four more occasions (pp. 217, 228 and 238) as Grimes, and once (p. 208) as Tristram. The first seventy lines of this act are disordered (pp. 210-12). For forty-nine lines Clare, Grace and Busie plan to outwit Valentine and Freewit. Then Sir Geffrey, Covet, Sir Timothy and Young Holdfast enter and discourse for thirteen lines, and apparently each group is totally unaware of the presence of the other. After this Busie continues as if nothing had happened. The last twenty-four lines of this passage are as follows : Glare . . .some ingenious poet that shall keepe Thy fame alive in a brave Epitaph Grav’d on thy marble. Enter Covet , Sir Geffrey Holdfast , Sir Timothy , young Holdfast. Geff. What varlet should that be trow? Gov. Truth I know not. Nor can conjecture, yet I did believe Him to be truely yours, because attird Ith’ habit and the phrase of a right Scholler, And for your sonne, pardon me master Holdfast , I tooke you for some lewd audacious varlet, That had usurpt that title. Hold. I imagine It was some bastard of my fathers, gotten In youth upon his Taylors wife or Landresse, He has good store of them, but master Alderman You now conceive Ime son and heire apparent Unto the Holdfasts , whosoever got me.

Farewell good Ladies, you’l be sure to come Luce. Ex. Busie. Then Sir Geffrey notices Clare and Grace for the first time in this scene. Busie’s speech must be a continuation of his talk with Clare and Grace, and should be placed before the entry of Covet, Sir Geffrey and the others. Now the thirteen lines of dialogue between Covet and his companions contain a hurried clearing up of the repercussions of Thorowgood’s scholar plot, it is brief to the point of inadequacy, and seems to be the mere abstract of a cut scene, which dealt m full with the arrival of Sir 14 4 Wit in a Constable Censorship and Revision Geffrey, and which cleared up Covet’s confusion over Young Holdfast. It is probable that they were written on a separate slip for insertion, and that the printer erroneously placed them one speech too soon. Before this conversation Clare and Grace have not shown that they know anything of Busie, and the connexion here revealed — that he is the father of Luce, their attendant — is unusually belated even in a sur- prise motive play. Further, both Busie and Clare refer to the character hitherto named Thorowgood as Freewit (iv, i, pp. 211, 219, etc.), and throughout this act he appears under the latter name. There are further inconsistencies in iv, i, p. 212. Sir Timothy and Young Holdfast previously rejected Clare and Grace after the discovery of Valentine (hi, i, p. 209), yet here and to p. 217 they talk with the two ladies and arrange to marry them as if the events of the foregoing act had not occurred. Covet’s explanation of the c stain those idle gallants put upon them 5 is strangely inadequate and strangely placed. It would have been better placed before p. 212, or, on the other hand, iv, i, pp. 212-17 may have been placed much earlier in the original play, in fact, before the conclusion of the revenge plot. This would imply, however, that Covet’s explanation and Sir Timothy’s acceptance of it (p. 213) are later additions. Busie’ s request to Young Holdfast and Sir Timothy, . . .give me your mony. And ile take out the licence, (iv, l, p. 218) comes curiously after Young Holdfast’s order to Grimes, . . .goe you to th’ office; There’s mony, fetch a Licence, (rv, i, p. 217) There is no exit notice for Grimes until he goes out with Young Holdfast and Sir Timothy at the end of the episode (p. 218) ; but the order to buy the licence is not countermanded, and it would be natural to assume that Grimes carries it out immediately it is given. Actually Busie buys the licence (v, i, p. 226). The order to Grimes is almost certainly a trace of an earlier version. Act v continues the tale of inconsistencies. In v, i, p. 236 the names Freewit and Thorowgood appear together in an entry notice. Only one speech is attributed to Thorowgood (p. 236), but from the nature of this speech and of Clare’s reply to it, whoever speaks these lines is not Thorowgood-Freewit. Thor. Come, your rage Is uselesse now: he [i.e. Busie] has done better for you. Than I by th 5 circumstance perceive you had Intended for your selves : what would you’ve done J. H.

Ours? then may we dye Virgins, And these same trusty youths, now cald our husbands, Be suddamly transform’d to Eunuchs; we Had thought young Holdfast , and Sir Timothy Had bm the Squires had usher’d us, and them We had resolv’d to couple with. (pp. 236-7) The only person in whose mouth the words would be appropriate is Knowell, but there is no indication that he is present. The most plausible explanation is, that for some reason or other connected with the state of the copy, the printer made a wrong ascription, for the Freewit- Thorowgood identification is too well established elsewhere to be put in question by this speech heading. Busie’s arrangements for the marriages of Freewit and Valentine with Clare and Grace are puzzling. Busie tells the two men that Clare and Grace Wished me to assure you, that if you would speedily Take out Licences this very night, Twixt nme and ten, at my house they would meet you, And joyne with you m Matrimony. In spite of this Freewit and Valentine act the parts of Young Holdfast and Sir Timothy (p. 237), and Clare and Grace marry them under the belief that they actually are Holdfast and Timothy (p. 236). This seems to contain vestiges of two distinct plots. Susie’s movements in this act are confusing. Early on (p. 226) he tells the priest, when I have Dispos’d my Watch, I will be there my selfe. Yet he makes no attempt to join the priest at all. He spends his time drinking with Mendwell in the St John’s Head, and is there when Covet bursts upon him (p. 234). He must have changed over the brides and grooms, rushed ahead of the brides’ sedans, given the priest his instruc- tions and the Watch their lengthy charge (pp. 226-7) before the sedans arrive (p. 228). All this is not impossible, but it is unnecessarily complex. The passage of the sedans through the Watch seems to be wrongly ordered. On p. 223 Freewit and Valentine are told to meet Clare and Grace at Busie s house twixt nine and ten ’, and they leave it with Clare and Grace before Sir Timothy and Young Holdfast, for the latter are ‘held in discourse’ (p. 237) by Luce and Nell. Yet Sir Timothy and Young Holdfast pass through the Watch earlier (p. 228) than Freewit and Valentine (p. 229). 16 4 Wit in <t Constable \\* Censorship and Revision From this welter of evidence some important facts emerge. The first two acts may fairly be claimed as belonging to the original play; the last three acts have been altered considerably, and while they doubtless contain some of the original play rehashed, they also contain much that is new. Busie is clearly a later addition, though his intrigues seem to incorporate portions of the original play, and hence it may be inferred that the Watch scenes are additions likewise. This purely textual evidence of a revision is supported by the dates of certain events mentioned within the play itself. The titlepage claims that the play was £ written 1639 % but this does not seem to be accurate. The original portions of the play, Acts I and ii, were certainly written earlier than 1639. In the opening scene of Act x Holdfast, declaring that he has been idle since leaving Cambridge, bids Tristram goe to my stationer And bid him send me Swarez Metaphysickes, Tolet de anima is new forth, So are Granadas commentaries on P? imum secundae Thomae Aquinatis, lohn Taylo? , get me his nonsense. Trist. Yon meane all his workes sir. Hold. And a hundred of Bookers new Almanacks, (p 170) There is a definite statement that two of these books were newly pub- lished, and it is reasonable to suppose that the other books mentioned in the same context were issued but few years earlier. Such, indeed, is the case. Franeiseus Toletus, Archbishop of Toledo, had issued his commentaries on Aristotle’s De Anima separately, but forty years after his death they were published together as In tres libros Anstotelis de Anima Commentani . . . Lugduni , 1636. 1 The Commentaries of Franeiseus Suarez, or Granada — not the other and perhaps more famous Granada — were published posthumously a year earlier: Commentariorum ao Dis~ putationum in Primam Partem Divi Thomae . . , Auctore R . P . Francisco Svarez Granatensi. . . Partis Secvndae De Deo Creatore . . .Lugduni 1635. 1 2 The same writer’s Metaphysics was originally published in two volumes in 1605 and again at Geneva in 1636. 3 A collected edition of John Taylor’s works appeared in 1630 under the title All the Workes of John Taylor the Water-Poet. Tristram’s phrase c all his workes’ may allude to this title. Bowker’s New Almanacks were issued for 1631-4. So far it is clear that this part of the play cannot have been written earlier than 1636, but was probably written soon after. 1 Backer, Bibl. Compagme de Jims. 2 Ibid. a Ibid. J. H. WALTER 17 There is more evidence in the same scene. Thorowgood, greeting Valentine and Sir Timothy, asks what business has brought them up to London: .... may I inquire the affaire Which happily has brought you up to th’ City ? May I know it? ls’t not to purchase a Monopoly Of Salt and Herrings ? for state busmesse, Unlesse it be to see the great new ship, Or Lincolns Inne fields built, I’m sure you’ve none here. (p. 177) The reference to the c Monopoly for Salt and Herrings 5 is a satirical gibe at the group of men who were granted a monopoly of the salt trade by a charter of incorporation from the Privy Council in January 1636. 1 These men, like foolish Sir Timothy Shallowit, knew nothing of the salt business, but were ready to share their profits with the king. The keel of the 4 great new ship or Sovereign of the Seas, was laid m 1636, and the ship was launched on 13 October 1637. All this time she was one of the sights of London, but particularly so when at Erith and Greenhithe she was being rigged and armed during the first six months of 1638. She joined the fleet m August, 1638, and was away for the whole of 1639 at least. 2 The reference in the text would have no point if it were written after August, 1638. The original play then was most probably written j^btween 1636 and August 1638. One of the conclusions drawn from the evidence of the text was that the Watch scenes were most probably additions. Act v opens with a Watch scene m which occur the following lines- Marry, that twixt Deale And Dover , one fishing for flounders, drew A Spaniards body up, slaine ith’ late sea-fight, (p. 225) The fight mentioned can only be that which occurred on 11 October 1639, between the Spanish and the Dutch in the Downs. 3 Later in the same act the fiddler’s boy begs permission to sing to those members of the Watch who have accompanied Busie into the tavern £ A very new song’. Busie scornfully replies: I doubt it is some lamentable stuffe, Oth’ Swine-fac’d gentlewoman, . . . her story’s stale boy, ’T has beene already m two playes.

It is doubtful, however, whether this can be regarded as reliable evidence, for the ballad may have been popular among ballad singers before it was entered for printing. The previous piece of evidence, however, proves conclusively that the part of the play containing the Watch scenes, and presumably the scenes m which Busie appears, received their present form not earlier than October, 1639. It now remains to find an answer to the questions of how and why these alterations and additions were made. It is not easy to suggest a story that will account for the facts economically and with probability, but as such the following is offered. Sometime in the years 1637-8 Glapthorne wrote a play in which the chief themes were the plots and counter -plots of Thorowgood, Valentine, Clare and Grace, and the gulling of Young Holdfast, Sir Timothy and Alderman Covet. The first of these plots was Thorowgood’s impersona- tion of Young Holdfast, the scholar. This impersonation was discovered by the arrival of Sir Geffrey Holdfast, probably during Act in, certainly not as late as iv, i, p. 211 as in the present version. The discovery ren- dered it impossible for Thorowgood to gain access to Clare as Thorowgood, but he did so disguised as Freewit. Valentine’s disguise as Sir Timothy’s niece, ostensibly to woo Grace on behalf of Sir Timothy, was more elaborate and ended sooner than the scholar plot of Thorowgood. Alderman Covet was tricked into a mock marriage with Sir Timothy, who assumed Valentine’s female disguise for the purpose of wooing Grace. Young Holdfast was tricked into marrying Maudlin, in reality Luce, the daughter of Grimes, also called Tristram. 2 Grimes, and not Busie, was the contriver of the later intrigues. That Tnstram-Grimes was the original intriguer receives some support from Glapthorne’s practice of using the same names in different plays for characters of the same type. Thus Grimes as a cunning servant appears in The Lady Mother , as do Thorowgood, a gallant, and Maudlin, a maid-servant (cf. also Freewit and Tristram in The Hollander ). What share Knowell and Sir Geffrey took in these plots, it is impossible to say with any degree of probability. The marriages of Thorowgood with Clare and Valentine with Grace were brought about by Grimes in much the same way as Busie contrived them. Late in 1639 the play was sent to the Master of the Revels or his 1 See JRoxburghe Ballads , vni, 28. 2 Cf. the similar way in which Tristram-Urinal the witty servant of The Hollander tricks Sconce into marriage with Martha, Urinal’s sister. J. H. WALTER 19 deputy 1 to be licensed for acting. Unfortunately, owing to the storm that had arisen over the satirical portraits of aldermen and other civic dignitaries m The Whore New Vampt, 29 September 1639, 2 the Master of the Revels took exception to the latter parts of the play, which re- vealed Alderman Covet in an unflattering and ludicrous light. Glap- thorne, therefore, was obliged to cut out the original gulling of Covet. Now The Whore New Vampt had awakened the anger of the city authorities more particularly because it belittled their dignity and authority. The topical value of reproducing m this play some allusion to the matter was too good to be missed, if it could be done with safety. Glapthorne, accordingly, hit upon the ingenious idea of playing off two civic digni- taries against each other, a constable against an alderman, which idea, incidentally, provided him with a new title, Wit m a Constable . Never- theless, he trod warily. The Song of the Constable (p. 233), probably a parody of Gyff on’s Song of a Constable , 3 after increasingly ribald stanzas, ends in an anti-climax with a refrainless stanza highly complimentary to constables. Further, Covet was detained in comfort at Busie’s house rather than imprisoned; and Sir Geffrey praised London’s excellent 6 night-rule ’ (p. 230), and that he and Covet fall victims to its stringency is not without irony. The problem of the name changes is difficult. When the offending matter had been cut, it was necessary to alter the disguise plots, to rearrange the revenge and scholar plots, and to introduce Busie as soon as possible. To do this most of Act v was rewritten, except perhaps the concluding scene or two where names and speech-headings were altered; a fair amount of Act iv was rewritten, and one scene introducing Busie was added to Act hi. If in the original play Thorowgood was disguised as Freewit through most of Acts iv and v, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the playwright, to avoid confusion in the parts that he was adapting and rewriting, * kept the name Freewit. In the last scenes where he retained some of the original lines, and where Freewit had cast off his disguise and revealed himself as Thorowgood, he altered Thorowgood to Freewit. But the printer, seeing an indistinct speech- heading or that one was required (p. 236), preserved the deleted Thorow- good in the preceding entry notice, and assigned the speech to him. Later he preserved a deleted Thorowgood in the final entry notice. In like manner, to avoid confusion the names Grimes and Luce were 1 Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, was away m the north with the King’s army during much of this year. 2 Gal.

The changes m the plot made it necessary to find another bride for one of the two gulls, and so Nell is mentioned by Busie (iv, i, p. 218) though she does not appear until v, i, p. 239, after she is married to Sir Timothy. This hypothesis is, of course, largely conjectural, but as far as it explains the discrepancies coherently, so far has it a claim to considera- tion. London. J. H. Waltee. LA FONTAINE AND BIDPAI In the short preface which La Fontaine prefixed to the second collection of his Fables, 1 2 he says that £ he owes the greater part to Pilpay, an Indian sage 5 . This is an exaggeration, for out of the eighty-nine fables of which this second collection (Books vii-xi) is composed, there are not more than twenty which can be referred to Oriental sources. The Fables of Pilpay or Bidpai , known also as The Booh of Ealilah and Dimnah , has a long and distinguished ancestry. It may be traced back to a Sanscrit work, the Panchatantm , now lost, which a Kashmir Brahman composed at some date between 300 b.c. and a.d. 570, probably at least as early as a.d. 300. It was in substance a manual of instruction in worldly and political wisdom — it may almost be called a manual of statecraft — for young princes, and m form a collection of stories in most of which animals with many of the attributes of human beings play a leading part. It is now recognized that the text which comes nearest to the lost original is the Tantrdhhydyihaf of which its discoverer, Dr Johannes Hertel, has published a German translation, with a long and important introduction, 3 and a critical edition. 4 The Panchatantra is also represented by numerous texts which are more divergent from the original, for the transcribers have added or omitted stories at their pleasure, often in the interests of their religion, whether Brahmin, or Buddhist, or Jain. Blending several of these texts in an uncritical fashion, Rosengarten produced in 1848 the first modern edition, and upon this Theodor Benfey based his well-known and epoch-making work. 5 Many of the conclusions to which he was led by the faulty character of his text have been disputed in the light of later research, but he must always be honoured as an \"immortal pioneer 5 , who laid the foundations of the comparative treatment, not only of the fable, 1 Four volumes, 1678-9. i and n are a reprint of his first collected fables in consists of books vh and vni; iv (1679) of books ix, x and xi.

In recent years Dr Hertel lias published a critical edition of a late recension (a.d. 1199) made by a Jain monk. 1 From an early text of the Panehatantra a translation into Pahlavi, the literary dialect of Persia, was made by one Burzoe, physician to King Khosru (Chosroes) Nushirvan, a.d. 531-579. His defective knowledge of Sanscrit and of Indian religion, laws, and customs led him, in spite of the assistance of an Indian pundit, into various mistranslations and other mistakes, 2 but it must not be forgotten that it is to his cleverness and enterprise — for the Indian texts were far from easy of access — that we owe the extraordinary diffusion and vogue of these tales among readers, high and low, of all nations. Like the original Sanscrit work this Pahlavi version no longer exists, but it is represented by two translations, one Syriac and the other Arabic. The Syriac version, which was discovered in 1870, is the older of the two, being made about a.d. 570 by one Bud, who was entrusted with the oversight of the Christians in India and Persia. 3 Though here and there it interpolates biblical reminiscences, it is regarded as on the whole the more faithful of the two. But the Arabic version concerns us much more nearly, for while the Syriac has no progeny, the Arabic has numerous descendants, through which the Fables have penetrated into all quarters of the globe. It was made about a.d. 750 by Ibn-aLMuqaffa, a native of the province of Persia, who, though brought up in the Zoroastrian religion, made as a young man profession of Islam. 4 He had much literary ability and was a master of both Pahlavi and Arabic. It was therefore natural that at a time when Persian influence was on the increase among the Arabs he should translate a Persian work into Arabic. His version, which is said to be £ a model of elegant style 5 , 5 was entitled Kalllah and Dimnah , the names of two jackals who play a leading part in the first chapter of the Panehatantra ( The Ox and the Lion), but who appear in that chapter only. 6 It is therefore probable that in the Sanscrit text used by the Pahlavi translator this title was transferred from the first chapter to the whole 1 The Panehatantra, with a preface in English, by C.

The Arabic version was edited in 1816 by the great Oriental scholar Silvestre de Sacy. His edition was based upon several manuscripts, but without a critical examination of them, and the manuscript upon which he chiefly relied was an inferior one. 1 Nearly a century later (1905) the Jesuit Father, L. Oheikho, published at Beyrut an edition with a proper critical apparatus, which is based on the oldest Arabic text, that which agrees most closely with the Syriac version. The immediate descendants of the Arabic version (omitting a Hebrew one of the thirteenth century, which is of little value, and a Latin poetical imitation of the same century entitled Alter Aesopus) are five in number — Syriac, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, and Persian. The Syriac version, of the tenth or eleventh century, was edited by William Wright, Professor of Arabic in the University of Cambridge, one of the great Orientalists of the last generation, 2 and translated by his pupil, Ion Keith Falconer. 3 The Syrian translator was clearly a Christian priest, as is seen by the large number of Scriptural quotations and allusions. Moreover, when a story is about immoral conduct, he introduces words of condemnation. 4 Thus in the story of The Merchant' s Wife and the Painter , we read that c her inward form was hideous 5 , and that her lover was 'an enemy of his creator 5 , and finally that he 'turned back from his evil way 5 . Keith Falconer further points out that the translator did not always under- stand the text; his knowledge of natural history was also limited. 5 The old Spanish and the Hebrew versions are of very much the same date and were evidently, as Derenbourg first pointed out, made from the same text. The Hebrew version was made by an Italian J ew called Rabbi Joel in the first half of the thirteenth century. It now only exists in a single much mutilated manuscript, from which the first six chapters, with the exception of the last two stories, are missing. 6 But between 1263 and 1279 one John of Capua, a converted Jew, who practised as a physician at the Papal court, made a translation of it from a completed text. He was a faithful, not to say a slavish translator; his Latinity was poor and his Hebrew scholarship moderate. But his work became 1 It was translated into English by Silvestre de Sacy ’s pupil the Rev. Wyndham Knatch- bull (Oxford, 1819), and into German by Ph. Wolff, 2 vols., Stuttgart, 1837, 1839. 2 Oxford, 1884 The edition reproduces a unique MS. of Trinity College, Dublin, full of errors and in places very difficult to decipher. 3 In the days of the high bicycle he was the champion bicyclist of England. In 188b he was appointed Lord Almoner’s Reader of Arabic at Cambridge, but died at Aden m the following year. His book is entitled Kctlilah and Dimnah or The F ables of Bidpai (Cambridge, 1885).

It was printed four times in the fifteenth century under the title of Directorium humane vite , alias parabile antiquorum sapientium — the title given to it by its first editor 1 — and found many translators — German, 2 Spanish and Italian at first-hand and Danish, Dutch, English and Italian again at second-hand. Of these, I need only mention Doni’s Filosophia morale (Yenice, 1552) and its translation by Sir Thomas North, the well-known translator of Plutarch. But it is a long way from the Tantrdkhydyika to North, and the latter only reproduces about fifteen stories of the Sanscrit text. The old Spanish version was made by command of Alfonso the Wise, when he was Infante, and probably in 1251. 3 Though, as I have said, it follows the same text as the Hebrew, c it is a far truer representative says Keith Falconer, 'of the Arabic'. 4 It often preserves the Arabic names both of persons and animals. 5 The only two versions from the Arabic that are connected by direct descent with La Fontaine are the Greek and the Persian. The Greek was made by a physician named Simeon Seth — by order, it is said, of Alexius I (1081-1118), the founder of the Comnenian dynasty — who substituted for the title KalUah wa-Dimnah the fantastic one of Hre^avtrrjs Kal *lxv7}\\aTr}$. A text of this translation having come into the hands of the learned Jesuit, Pierre Poussines (1609-86), he appended a Latin version of it to his edition of Pachymeres 5 Life of Michael Palaeologus, calling it Specimen Sapientise Indorum veterum? Thirty years later a German scholar, S. G. Starcke, edited the Greek text, and thinking the Latin translation of Pere Poussines too free — which, as a matter of fact, it is — made a new one. 7 Unfortunately the Hamburg text which he used is very incomplete and faulty. Accordingly, an Italian scholar, Vittorio Prentoni, set to work to prepare a critical edition. It appeared m 1809 8 1 c. 1480 fo. a 6 -m 6 n 10 , with woodcuts (there is a copy in the Library of Trm.

TILLEY 25 and includes a recension of four typical manuscripts, the best being a Vatican one which came from the Laurentian library (Vat. 704). The oldest extant Persian version of the Arabic KaUlah wa-Dimnah was composed about a.d. 1120 by one Nasrullah, and on this was based the well-known Anwar-i-Suhaili (. Lights of Canopus) by Husain Wafiz. 1 Its date is between 1470 and 1505. The reason for making it, says the author, was that the obscure and hyperbolical language of Nasrullah’ s version had caused it to be almost neglected. To the English reader, how- ever, as he reads it in Wollaston’s translation, the language of Husain Wa c iz seems as far as possible removed from simplicity. Here is an example from the first story, the well-known one of The Two Pigeons : Two pigeons lived together in one nest and were confidants in the same abode. No dust of rivals settled on their minds, nor were their hearts vexed with the adversities of the world. Content with grain and water like dervishes, secluded, they intrusted themselves to the road of confidence in God. But he is often much more flowing than this, so that it is no wonder that Noldeke says that Husain is e far more bombastic’ than Nasrullah. His version contains a large number of stories 2 which are not in the Tantrakhydyika . Some come from other recensions of the Panchatantra , but the provenance of others is unknown. A long and stilted preface is followed by a new introduction, which relates the remote origin of the book, including the story of King Devasarman and his pundit Vidyapati (Bidpai). This is not found m any Sanscrit text and is probably an inven- tion either of the Court pundit who helped Burzoe with his Pahlavi version or of the Arabic translator. In its older form it appears in the Arabic version edited by Saey, 3 but not in any of those made from it, except presumably that of Nasrullah. Nor does it appear in the old Syriac version. 4 In spite of its bombastic style Husain’s book had an enormous success, which is attested by numerous manuscripts and editions and by transla- tions into some twenty European and Asiatic languages. The only one, however, that concerns us is the French one, which, stripped of the Persian bombast, appeared in 1644 under the title of Livre des lumieres ou la conduite des Roys compose par le sage Pilpay , Indien; traduit enfrangais par David Sahid d’ Ispahan, mile capitate de Perse. 5 The introduction was 1 Translated by E. B. Eastwick (Hertford, 1854) and A. N. Wollaston (London, 1877, 1894). For Husam Wahz and bis translation see E. G. Browne, A literary History of Persia , H (1908), 350-3. 2 There are over a hundred.

He was a man of great learning, and knew many languages, particularly Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. He died in 1665. A new edition of the Livre des Lumieres was published in 1698, four years after La Fontaine’s death, with the title of Les Fables de Pilpay philosophe indien; ou La conduite des ms. 1 It is 6 very defective ’, as Chauvin says, and its only interest is that it adopts for the first time in the long history of these fables the title of Les Fables de Pilpay . 2 Le L%vre des Lumieres was La Fontaine’s source for the great majority of his fables of Indian origin. But as it reproduces only the first four chapters of the Anwar-i-Suhaili , 3 we must look elsewhere for the source of those which are not included in these chapters, namely, Les deux Perroqusts , le Roi et son fils (x, xii), La Lionne et VOurse (x, xiii), Le Mar - chand, le Gentilhomme , le Pdtre , et le fils de Roi (x, xv), and Le Chat et le Rat (vra, xxii). It was pointed out by Loiseleur-Deslongchamps in his Essai sur les Fables Indiennes 4 that this second source was Pere Poussmes’ Specimen Sapientise Indorum veterum, and that La Fontaine probably had it brought to his notice by his friend Pierre-Daniel Huet, the Bishop of Avranches, who in his Lettre sur Vorigine des romans mentions Simeon Seth’s Greek version of the Kalilah wa-Dimnah and Poussines’ trans- lation. 5 It has also been pointed out that another friend of La Fontaine’ who might have given him information about Oriental literature was the distinguished traveller, Francois Bernier, who published in 1670-1 two volumes on the Mogul Empire. He was a well-known figure in Parisian society and frequented the salon of Mme de la Sabliere, in whose house La Fontaine lived from 1672. 6 1 There was another edition of this year with the subtitle of La conduite des grands et des petits . 2 Le Livre des Lumieres was translated into English by Joseph Harris for the Duke of Gloucester, the son of Queen Anne (1689-1700), The instructive and entertaining Fables of Pilpay an Ancient Indian Phylosopher made English and addressed to His Highness the Duke of Gloucester, 12 mo , 1699 (Chauvin, following Lowndes, gives the wrong date of 1679), 1743, 1747 (corrected, improved and enlarged), 1754, 1775, 1789, remodelled by J. Mitford, Weybndge, 1810, Whittingham, 1818 (reproduced m the Chandos Classics), 1852 (with numerous illustrations by T. D. Scott). 3 These four chapters correspond to chapters v-vm of the Arabic version of which v, vu and vni represent three tantras or series of the Tantrdkhydyika . Thus The Lion and the Ox (Arabic v)—The Loss of Friends {T antra i), The Ring-dove (Arabic vii) = The Winning of Friends (T antra ix), The Ravens and the Owls (Arabic vni) = T antra in, which has the same title, while Dimnah's Trial (Arabic vi) has no corresponding chapter in the Tantrdkhydyika or any Sanscrit text. It is regarded as an interpolation for moral purposes of the Arabic translator. Le Livre des Lumibres and its English translation have five chapters, the first chapter consisting of Husain Wa c iz’s introduction with five fables taken by him from some unknown sources, and’ the other four corresponding to his chapters i-iv. 4 Pans, 1838, p. 66. 5 Printed at the head of Mme de la Payette’s Zayde , 1670. 6 Michaut, op. cit ., ii, 134 ff.; R. Bray, op. cit., p. 103. A. TILLEY 27 A comparison of La Fontaine with Pere Poussmes puts the matter beyond a doubt. For instance, m Les deux Perroquets Simeon Seth is the only writer who says that the bird was a parrot , 1 and in La Lionne et VOurse he is the only one who calls the second animal a she-bear . 2 But there is much more than this. In Les deux Perroquets Seth alone says that the reason for the young prince killing the young parrot was that the latter had hurt his pet sparrow. Nearly all the other versions give different reasons, but not one of them says anything about a sparrow. A less obvious resemblance is the familiar tone which the she-bear adopts towards the lioness, c Ma commere, un mot sans plus 5 , which may possibly have been suggested by Pere Poussines’ remark, that the two were friends. On the other hand, there is nothing in Le Marehand , le Gentil- homme , le Pdtre , et le fils de Roi (x, xv) which definitely points to the Jesuit father as the source. The fable is clearly of Indian origin, but Dr HertePs pronouncement that the four friends who are reduced to begging (au sort de Belisaire) stand for the four castes, can hardly be sustained . 3 The nobleman is not a Brahman, nor does the herdsman appear to be a Sudra. Besides, would members of the higher caste be travelling with one of the lowest caste ? The earliest version that has come down to us is the Arabic . 4 It gives us a story which is fuller and more interesting than the one told by La Fontaine, who does not carry us beyond the first adventure, that of the herdsman, which is the least interesting of the four. Je conclus de cette avanture, Qu’il ne faut pas tant d’art pour conserver les jours; Grace aux dons de la nature, La main est le plus sur et le plus prompt secours. But the original moral is different. It is that work, beauty, intelligence, and birth, all have their proper function in this world, and that by the help of providence all may lead to success. La Lionne et VOurse, one of the shortest fables, also ends half-way through the story, for in the original the lioness repents of her sins and becomes a vegetarian — an ending which La Fontaine naturally omits as having no interest for his readers. 1 Nearly all the versions designate the bird by a personal name, without saying what sort of bird it is. In the later Syriac and the Spanish it is c a bird that could talk’. Seth’s ‘parrot’ is of course an inference from its remarkable loquacity. 2 In the Arabic the second animal is a jackal; m John of Capua a fox The Spanish trans- lation has anxdbar , which is more or less the Arabic word 3 Hertel, Das Pancatantra , pp. 371-85; Pdtre corresponds to Agricola m Pere Poussines. Professor Rapson suggested that the King’s son and the Nobleman’s son are Kshatriyas (the second caste) and the other two Vaigyas (the third caste) 4 There is a somewhat similar story m other texts of the Panckatantm , but the differences are strongly marked (Benfey, op. c%t. } i, 603). 28 La Fontaine and Bidpai The fourth fable that he owes to the Specimen Sapientim, namely, Le Chat et le Rat (vm, xxii), opens in his best vein. In five lines he puts the whole situation before us - Quatre animaux divers, le Chat grippe-fromage, Triste-oiseau le Hibou, Ronge-maille le Rat, Dame Belette au long corsage, 1 Toutes gens d’esprit scelerat Hantoient le tronc pourry d’un pin vieux et sauvage. But the owl and the weasel keep in the background, and only the cat and the rat have speaking parts. In the Arabic version and those which follow it, there is a long and prosy argument between the hypocritical cat, who 'like any devout cat says his prayers every morning 5 , and the rat who keeps at a safe distance and firmly declines an alliance with one who by nature is his mortal enemy. La Fontaine skilfully condenses this into ten lines, but he cannot make an interesting story. The real merit of the fable lies in his superb handling of the metre. He portrays the cat, and another Tartuffe, more vigorously m Le Chat , la Belette et le petit Lapin (vn, svi), which is one of his great artistic triumphs. What a delightful picture of Jean Lapin who, having paid his court to Aurora parmi le thym et la rosee and having broute , trotte , fait tons ses tours , returns to find his paternal home occupied by Dame Weasel with her pointed nose in possession. 0 la ! Madame la Belette Que Ton deloge sans trompette. Later comes the inimitable description of Raminagrobis, to whom the dispute is referred for arbitration: C’estoit nn chat vivant comme un devot ermite, IJn Chat faisant la chattemite Un saint homme de chat, bien fourre, gros et gras. La Fontaine is of course thinking here of Grippeminaud the 'archiduc des chats fourres 5 of Rabelais's Fifth Book, for towards the end of the fable he calls the cat by this name. All the versions from the T antra- khyayika downwards represent the cat as praying fervently, and in Le Lime des Lumieres 2, he wears a furred gown. In his choice of animals for the cat's victims La Fontaine has abandoned his source. In all the ver- sions till we come to Lights of Canopus one of the victims is a hare. But 1 In the Katha Barit Sdgara or Ocean of the Streams of Story (a collection of stories in 18 hooks and 124 chapters from various Sanscrit sources translated by C. H. Tawney, 2 vols,, Calcutta, 1884, i, 296 ff.) an ichneumon takes the place of the weasel. 2 In the Sanscrit texts he is represented as praying with his face to the sun — a form of penance. A. TILLEY 29 Wollaston gives 'quail 5 , and Le Livre des Lumieres 'bird 5 . The other victim in the Tantmhhydyika is a bird named Kapinjala which is usually rendered 'partridge 5 , but which Dr Hertel translates by Haselhuhn (Bonasa sylvestris ), a bird not found in India. 1 Benfey thinks that 'par- tridge 5 was in the original Arabic text, 2 and both the Anwar-i-SuhaiU and Le Livre des Lumieres have 'partridge 5 . But Knatchbull has 'night- ingale 5 , Keith Falconer 'sparrow 5 , and John of Capua 'bird 5 . The Greek version has 'squirrel 5 , and the Spanish jmeta or genet. La Fontaine was not a Gilbert White, but he was a sympathetic observer of animal life, and he no doubt felt that a partridge, or indeed any bird, was out of place here. He therefore substituted for the two birds of Le Livre des Lumieres two animals with whose habits he was well acquainted — 'Dame Belette au long corsage 5 , 'au corps long et fiuet 5 ^ and a little rabbit whose gambols in the heather and thyme of the hill-side he must often have watched : Des Lapins, qm sur la Bruyere L’ceil eveille, T oreille sur le guet, S’egayoient, et de thim parfumoient leur banquet. 3 The differences in the names of the animals are not surprising when one considers through how many languages the fables passed, how some of the translators were imperfectly acquainted with the language from which they were translating, and how probably none of them had more than the average man’s knowledge of natural history. Thus it happened that when a translator was faced with the name of an animal unknown to him and perhaps unknown in his country, he either substituted for it the name of some animal familiar to him, or as the Spanish translator from the Arabic sometimes does, wrote it down as he found it, or, as the Hebrew trans- lator followed by the faithful John of Capua did, put down simply 'a bird 5 , or 'an animal 5 or 'a fish 5 as the case might be. One of the best examples of how the names of the animals became changed during the migration of the fables from one country to another is The Camel , the Lion , the Panther , the Crow , and the Jackal , as it is entitled in the Tantmhhydyika . Though it is not one of La Fontaine’s sources, it bears a close analogy, so far as the moral goes, with his Les Animaux malades de la peste (vn, i), which inaugurates his second collection and which many regard as his masterpiece. In this fable, for which his source was Haudent’s Apologues (Rouen, 1547) and Guesoult’s Emblemes 1 So Schulthess in his translation of the old Syriac version. 3 Benfey, op. cit ., pp. 350 ff. Cp. Katha Sant Sdgara , pp. 67 f. 3 Discours a Monsieur le Due de la JRochefoucault (x, xiv). 30 La Fontaine and Bidpai (Lyons, 1550), the part of the camel is played by the ass, but whereas the ass is an honest simpleton, the camel is a hypocrite who pays the penalty of his hypocrisy. In the Tantrdkhydyika the fable begins as follows : In a wooded district there lived a lion, who had three flesh-eaters as followers, a panther, a crow and a jackal. One day, as they were hunting m the forest, they beheld a camel, which had strayed from a caravan. Whereupon the lion, seeing an animal of a comic and unfamiliar shape, said: ‘Ask him who he is.’ Note that the lion and his followers are represented as never having seen a camel, but that the writer knows of their use for caravans. This is regarded by Dr Hertel as lending support to his view that the work was written in Kashmir, where the camel, he says, was unknown, but which borders on lands where it was used for transport. 1 The panther or leopard (. Felis pardus), for which the Sanscrit word is dvipin (with islands on its skin), is generally distributed throughout India, but as it is bolder and more active than a lion, the part that is assigned to it in this fable, that of scouting for the lion and being largely dependent on it for food, is in- appropriate. 2 It seems probable that some smaller feline 4 with islands on its skm’ is meant. The Syriac and Arabic versions have c jackal’, which they probably found m the Pahlavi version. All the other non-Indian versions of the fable have c wolf’. The crow may be either the jungle-crow ( Corvus macrorhynchus) or the house-crow (Corvus splendens), both of which are common all over India, the former being rather the larger of the two. They closely resemble one another in habits and habitat. 3 The third of the lion’s followers is in the Sanscrit text and all the Oriental versions a jackal, and in the Spanish version Arabic abrure , which represents the Arabic ibn awa. Seth, the Greek translator, has 6d> s*, a word which occurs twice in the Iliad and is generally translated by 'jackal’. But Aristotle’s description of its changing its coat in winter clearly points to a lynx. 4 John of Capua gives the Latin form, thos , which is described by Pliny in terms borrowed from Aristotle. 5 The substitution of a lynx for a jackal is interesting, because lobos cervales or lynxes, is the name given by the Spanish translator to the two jackals, Karataka and Damanaka, who have been transformed into the Arabic "
