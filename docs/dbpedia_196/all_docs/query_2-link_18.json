Mihalko\n\nClass\n\n1969\n\nInduction\n\n2014\n\nSport(s)\n\nFootball, Track and Field, Tennis\n\nStephen C. Mihalko, native son of Western Pennsylvania, you came to Wabash in the fall of 1965 and brought with you a free spirit and blue collar work ethic. You majored in economics and pledged Phi Delta Theta while participating in four sports — football, swimming, track and field, and even wrestling in your freshman year. You focused on football, swimming, and track, and established yourself as one of the greatest — and certainly feistiest — athletes of your era.\n\nAt the time of your graduation, you held five school records in three sports. You were a three-year letterman in football, and set records for most career receptions (72) and receiving yards (1,107), while scoring seven touchdowns. You were also a part of the Wabash football team that upset a vaunted DePauw team in the 1967 Mud Bowl when the Little Giants came away from Greencastle with a 7-0 victory. As a diver, you established Wabash College records on the one- and three-meter diving boards during the program’s rebirth in 1969. In track and field, you were a two-year letterman and ran on the record-setting 440-yard relay.\n\nDespite your diminutive frame, you were the ultimate big man on campus — six varsity letters and a Sphinx Club pot — made even more impressive because you were married and had a child in your senior year. Upon graduation, you played semi-professional football while waiting on the draft, and later served as a pilot in the United States Air Force.\n\nAnyone who has ever known you — or even met you briefly — knows that you have a voracious appetite for living and loving. And because you so voraciously devoured every opportunity to excel that was offered to you by this College, the National Association of Wabash Men is proud to induct you, Stephen C. Mihalko, in the Wabash College Athletics Hall of Fame."
