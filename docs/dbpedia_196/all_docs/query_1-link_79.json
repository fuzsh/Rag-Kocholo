        "text": "In this episode of the Football History Headlines, we discuss the naming of the Raiders and some pretty good Hall of Fame players on their birthday are remembered as well as many more Hall of Fame Legendary stories.\n\nGridiron fans, gear up for another exciting day of football history! Dive into the archives and relive the moments that shaped the game we love. Today's headlines take us back in time, exploring everything from legendary quarterback duels that captivated a nation to groundbreaking rule changes that redefined the sport. So, whether you're a die-hard traditionalist or a stats guru, we have something for everyone. Let's lace up our virtual cleats and take a trip down memory lane!\n\nApril 14, 1876 - Libby, Minnesota - The standout end of Carlisle Indian Industrial School from 1896 to 1898 and with Minnesota from 1900 to 1903, Eddie Rogers was born. Eddie Rogers received the great honor of being selected for inclusion into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968. There is more of Rogers by clicking his name.\n\nApril 14, 1900 - Stockton, Kansas - The starting quarterback of Washburn from 1919 to 1921 and later a halfback in 1921 with Yale, Mal Stevens recounted as his date of birth. The National Football Foundationâ€™s website reports that legendary sports journalist Grantland Rice gave him his greatest football tribute, saying Stevens was \"in 1923 one of the greatest running backs I ever saw.\" The 1923 Yale team went 8-0 and out-scored its opponents 230-38. The stars were Stevens at halfback, Bill Mallory at fullback, and Century Milstead who was a transfer from Wabash at tackle. All three were elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. Stevens served Yale as assistant coach 1924-27 and head coach 1928-32, freshman coach in 1933. He was head coach at New York University 1938-41 and head coach of a pro team, the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Conference or AAFC in 1946. He obtained his medical degree at Yale. During the years he coached at Yale and New York University, he taught orthopedic surgery at the same schools. He was 28 when he became Yale head coach in 1928, making him the youngest head coach in the nation at a major school. He was president of the American Football Coaches Association in 1931 and, at age 31, the youngest president in association history. The National Football Foundation selected the collegiate stats and stories of Mal Stevens for entrance into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1974."
