De Jager, Jason J. Rohweder, James T. Rogala – U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Science Center\n\nABSTRACT: Flooding is a dominant physical process that drives the form and function of the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). Despite its importance, inundation patterns have not been systemically characterized in spatially-explicit ways that would advance understanding of ecological processes or inform management actions in the UMRS. We developed a geospatial model of floodplain inundation using topo-bathymetric terrains and 40 years of daily water surface elevations. We applied the model across 2.8 million acres of the UMRS and summarized long-term patterns of surface water dynamics in terrestrial areas including inundation frequency, duration, depth, and timing. We found that distributions of these flooding attributes varied within and among multiple levels of river organization, including navigational pools and geomorphic reaches. Non-linear relationships among inundation attributes and their geospatial distributions likely reflect complex interactions among topographic, hydrologic, and anthropogenic constraints on flooding dynamics. We discuss current and future applications of the inundation model to advance process-based knowledge of ecological phenomena and to inform management decisions in the UMRS floodplain.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:45am - 11:00am CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n10:45am CDT\n\nLAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE: The Gradient Concept of Landscape Structure for Wildlife Habitat in Rangelands\n\nAUTHORS: Humberto L. Perotto-Baldivieso*, Jose M. Mata, Janel L. Ortiz, John T. Edwards, April A. Torres Conkey, Fidel Hernández, Leonard A. Brennan, Eric D. Grahmann, Sandra Rideout-Hanzak, David B. Wester – Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute, Texas A&M University-Kingsville\n\nABSTRACT: The gradient concept of landscape structure is a relatively new conceptual paradigm in landscape ecology that provides an additional framework to pattern-process relationships occurring in the landscape. This model, takes into consideration the inherent environmental variability that exists in a landscape. This variability results in a gradient influencing organisms and ecological processes and their corresponding responses to changes along this gradient. This inherent continuous nature of ecological attributes was not previously well represented with the patch mosaic model, which has been used by landscape ecologists to describe landscape spatial heterogeneity. The aim of our research is to assess the value of the gradient concept of landscape structure based on remote sensing data to quantify suitable areas of northern bobwhite habitat (example 1) and hotspots of guild richness (example 2) in ground foraging avian species in South Texas. The first example uses existing data from northern bobwhite to assess suitability in habitats affected by tanglehead. The second example uses surface metrics to quantify potential hotspots for ground foraging birds. We applied the gradient concept of landscape structure by quantifying landscape metrics to develop surface metrics. We used moving window analyses to develop surface layers that describe landscape structure for northern bobwhites and ground foraging birds in South Texas. The selected metrics for these analyses included percent woody cover, mean patch area, edge density, aggregation index, interspersion and juxtaposition index, and cohesion index for woody cover and herbaceous cover (including tanglehead for northern bobwhites). These surface metrics were then used to develop spatial models that can quantify habitat suitability for avian populations in rangelands. Our results show that these models can be very useful to identify suitable areas for northern bobwhite habitat as well as predicting guild richness for ground foraging avian species.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:45am - 11:00am CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n10:45am CDT\n\nTERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS: Predicted Ecosystem State Changes Due to Sea-level Rise on Fire Island, New York: Implications for People and Plovers\n\nAUTHORS: Sara L. Zeigler*, Erika E. Lentz, Benjamin T. Gutierrez – U.S. Geological Survey Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center; Nathaniel G. Plant, U.S. Geological Survey St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center; Emily J. Sturdivant, E. Robert Thieler – U.S. Geological Survey Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center\n\nABSTRACT: Barrier islands and other coastal landforms are highly dynamic systems, changing in response to wind, wave action, water levels, currents, and vegetation. Several forces are responsible for dynamic ecomorphological changes in these systems, including pulse-type, short-term perturbations (e.g., storms) and press-type, persistent forcing (e.g., sea-level rise). As a result of these disturbances and on-going changes, multiple stable ecomorphological states exist for barrier islands. In this study, we used a probabilistic Bayesian network approach to investigate the likelihood of shifts in alternative equilibrium states on Fire Island, New York under several sea-level rise (SLR) scenarios. Specifically, we highlight areas that are most likely (i) to become inundated, (ii) to shift from one non-inundated state (or landcover type) to another (e.g., a forest becomes beach), or (iii) to remain in the current landcover state. We further explore potential correlates with each of these response types—including surrounding landcover diversity, distance from human development, and elevation—while also determining SLR thresholds at which point inundation is more likely than other response types. We conclude by discussing the implications of these likely ecomorphological changes for people and the federally protected piping plover (Charadrius melodus) – namely how potential losses in above-water land may affect human development and shorebird habitats.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:45am - 11:00am CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n10:45am CDT\n\nPEOPLE AND LANDSCAPES: Can Urban Birds Have a Positive Effect on Neighborhoods Well-Being?\n\nAUTHORS: Abel Ayon*; Doctoral student, Urban Landscape Ecology Laboratory, University of North Carolina Charlotte; Sara A. Gagne, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of North Carolina Charlotte\n\nABSTRACT: Our natural environment is negatively affected by urbanization. Studies demonstrate that contact with nature have direct and indirect positive effects on psychological well-being. Therefore, urban dwellers may suffer from reduced psychological well-being due to, among other factors, a lack of exposure to nature. Our objective was to understand the effect of bird diversity on human psychological well-being in low- and high-income neighborhoods in Charlotte, NC. We predicted two possible outcomes. First, bird diversity could have a larger effect on well-being in low-income neighborhoods. This is because the people in this category are starting out at very low well-being, so biodiversity can make a large difference in their well-being. Second, bird diversity could have a smaller impact in low-income neighborhoods. This is because well-being in these neighborhoods may be much more strongly determined by socio-economic factors, which swamp the effect of bird diversity. We selected nine neighborhoods according to their income and vegetation cover. We interviewed 700 residents of the chosen neighborhoods from February to June 2016. We assessed psychological well-being using the Attentional Function Index (AFI) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). For the case of AFI, the variables “managed land” and “abundance of birds” appeared as significant factors influencing on common daily activities. On the other hand, the VAS is influenced by the variable income. From May to July of 2015, we performed point counts to identify bird diversity. From our results, abundance is much higher on low-income neighborhoods with 3420 over 2790 in high-income neighborhoods. Overall, from the community of birds among neighborhoods, around 85% are equitably distributed. We conclude that nature can have a significant positive effect on the attention of common daily activities of dwellers in Charlotte and also this discovery can be very valuable for their well-being and incur into strategies of urban planning.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:45am - 11:00am CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Using Bird Abundance Models and Ecosystem Services Valuations to Inform Grassland Bird Conservation in an Urban Context\n\nAUTHORS: Nat Miller, Audubon Great Lakes; Chad B. Wilsey. National Audubon Society, Caitlin M. Jensen. National Audubon Society\n\nABSTRACT: Grassland habitats are threatened by both urbanization and conversion to agriculture. However, grasslands provision a variety of ecosystem services of significant value, which is of particular interest of local and county land managers. These include: flood control, groundwater recharge, water purification, and carbon sequestration as well as biodiversity protection. The National Audubon Society is working in partnership with researchers, citizen scientists and land managers across the greater Chicago metropolitan area, a seven-county region, to develop a landscape conservation plan for grasslands based on both biodiversity information and valuations of ecosystem services. Biodiversity information is quantified using models of abundance for five grassland obligate species, Eastern Meadowlark, Bobolink, Grasshopper Sparrow, Sedge Wren, and Henslow’s Sparrow. Models were built using abundance data from point count data collected by volunteer scientists. Ecosystem services were extracted from the Chicago Wilderness Green Infrastructure Vision dataset. In a GIS workflow, we identified patches of suitable habitat with an appropriate minimum abundance target for each of the five focal species, calculated the estimated abundance of birds and valuations for each ecosystem service, identified the proportion of each patch which is currently protected, and recommended future conservation focus on the largest tracts of unprotected potential habitat. Outputs provide spatially explicit recommendations for grassland bird conservation informed by both biodiversity data as well as quantitative metrics for the provisioning of ecosystem services.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Applicability and Implications of Telecoupling Framework on Rangeland Ecosystem Services\n\nAUTHORS: Sohyun Park*, Texas Tech University\n\nABSTRACT: Most ecosystem services research has been disciplinary, site-based, and provincial to delimited single system boundaries. Although this stream of research still holds value to advance the understanding of numerous benefits of ecosystems and their dynamics, it is becoming more essential to understand the full range of flows moving across systems, time and spaces as the world gets more connected in multiple fronts. The notion of telecoupling supports this knowledge base as an integrative way to study coupled human and natural systems that are linked over long distances, and has been proved convincing in framing problems in many studies. This study examines the applicability of telecoupling framework in ecosystem services research with a case example of Texas rangeland ecosystem services. Rangeland ecosystem services are unique and pivotal in the context of land preservation and watershed health. They influence, and are influenced by, land management practices in a direct manner and play a key role in sustaining the livelihoods of the largest share of society. Along with the known benefits and services that rangeland ecosystems provide (e.g., cattle grazing, food production, open viewscape, clean water, carbon sequestration), the interaction between the ecological and associated human systems and invisible trajectories of ecosystem service flows across distant systems will be investigated using the lens of the telecoupling conceptual framework. By exploring the defining components of the telecoupling framework (e.g., systems, agents, flows, causes, and effects) in the larger system context, this study attempts to seek the potential to better address the issue of how ecosystem services are connected and transferred in the production-benefit cycle, and to rightly answer how to identify, prioritize, and respond to the opportunities and threats to the sustainable management of rangeland ecosystems in arid regions.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: Measuring Geodiversity to Explain Biodiversity: What Is the Effect of Spatial Grain and Spatial 'Consciousness?'\n\nAUTHORS: Quentin D.

Malone, Florida International University; Keith Gaddis, National Aeronautics and Space Administration; John M. Grady, Bryn Mawr College; Jennifer Costanza, North Carolina State University; Martina L. Hobi, Swiss Federal Research Institute; Andrew Latimer, University of California-Davis; Stephanie Pau, Florida State University; Adam M. Wilson, University at Buffalo; Andrew Finley, Michigan State University; Scott Ollinger, University of New Hampshire\n\nABSTRACT: Goals: Biodiversity, the variety and distribution of species and their functions, is intimately related to geodiversity, the variety and distribution of nonliving features and processes. Novel remote sensing data products generated by NASA and other agencies show promise for increasing our understanding of this relationship. How we conceive of geodiversity and how we measure it are both critical for understanding and predicting biodiversity. We need to establish ways to conceptualize and measure landscape diversity to better conserve the living and nonliving diversity of the physical world.Approach: Here, we investigate several ways of measuring geodiversity of continuous variables, using topography as an example. We compare how well simple \"spatially naive\" metrics like standard deviation that ignore spatial arrangement of pixels predict variation in biodiversity compared to with more complex \"spatially conscious\" metrics that incorporate spatial arrangement of pixel values. Next, we compare different kernel sizes (spatial grains) ranging from 5 km to 100 km. We present relationships between these geodiversity metrics and the alpha-diversity (average species richness) and beta-diversity (variation in species across sites) of trees and birds in the continental USA.Results/Discussion: We found that spatially naive metrics of geodiversity predict biodiversity roughly as well as the spatially conscious metrics. In addition, increasing the radius over which the metrics are calculated provides different information. Interestingly, geodiversity explains little variation in alpha-diversity, but is strongly positively related to beta-diversity and gamma-diversity. This effect is especially pronounced in trees relative to birds, which may be due to their relatively poor mobility.The data processing pipeline we have developed to calculate many different geodiversity metrics at different kernel sizes is available on GitHub; we welcome collaboration and feedback.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: From Animal Movement to Management: Predator-Prey Interactions\n\nAUTHORS: Evelyn Merrill, University of Alberta; Mark Lewis, University of Alberta, Jacqui Frair, SUNY, Hannah McKenzie, Alberta Parks and Environment\n\nABSTRACT: Over the past 2 decades, new technologies in remote sensing of animal locations including GPS technology have opened the door to studying animal movement behaviors over large spatial and short temporal scales. The detailed information on animal movement can inform models that managers use to address wildlife conservation problems. We present how we have developed 2 movement models to the understanding the effect of linear features on wolf-human-elk interactions under different management scenarios.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-05: Simulating the Effects of Flood Inundation on Forest Succession in the Upper Mississippi River Floodplain Using the LANDIS-II Modelling Platform\n\nAUTHORS: Nathan R. De Jager, Molly Van Appledorn, Jason J. Rohweder, Yao Yin, Timothy J. Fox – USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center; Lyle J. Guyon, Andrew R. Meir, Robert J. Cosgriff, Benjamin J. Vandermyde – U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\n\nABSTRACT: Patterns of forest succession in floodplains are difficult to predict given the stochastic nature of flooding and its importance in shaping different aspects of plant community dynamics (e.g., germination, recruitment, competition, and survival). Observational and greenhouse studies have focused on developing a quantitative understanding of how different plant species perform during flooded conditions (i.e., flood tolerance). Meanwhile, increasingly sophisticated hydraulic and geospatial modelling approaches have been developed to simulate water movement across complex landscapes. However, it remains unclear how spatial and temporal variability in patterns of inundation alter long-term and broad-scale patterns of forest succession in floodplains, because there are no simulation models that link forest successional processes with inundation dynamics. We adapted the LANDIS-II forest succession model for use in floodplains by developing a flood disturbance extension to simulate the effects of annual spatial patterns of flood inundation on the survival of tree species-age-cohorts. A case study was conducted along 1335 km (95,321 ha) of the Upper Mississippi River floodplain, USA to illustrate the functionality of the extension and evaluate potential future successional trajectories in a system with a modified hydrological regime. Results suggest that the modelling approach may be broadly applicable for efforts aimed at: 1) disentangling effects of internal stand dynamics from effects of inundation, 2) Identifying locations within complex landscapes expected to be suitable for certain species and to display certain succession trajectories, 3) evaluating whether current species distributional patterns are at equilibrium with the hydrological regime of river-floodplains, and 4) simulating effects of alternative hydrological regimes on forest succession, and in the context of other disturbances.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nLAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE: Mapping Dynamic Processes in Arid Rangelands\n\nAUTHORS: Ginger R.H. Allington*, George Washington University; Daniel G. Brown, University of Washington\n\nABSTRACT: Recent initiatives to assess changes in forest cover regionally and globally are clearly important, however they necessarily overlook significant portions of the global land area; regions dominated by non-forest vegetation. Rangelands, despite their importance for livelihoods of millions of people worldwide, have not received the same methodological or thematic attention. Here, we present a new ontology for grassland classification that characterizes spatio-temporal patterns to incorporate land-cover dynamics, land-use history, and grassland condition, based on known state-and-transition (STM) vegetation dynamics. Compared to traditional discrete classification schemes, our approach draws from research on state changes to classify and interpret temporal signals of a simple vegetation index (NDVI) derived from moderate-resolution (30m) remote sensing data from Landsat sensors. We present a revised classification system based on five categories of linear and non-linear change in productivity over time, which represent distinct vegetation trajectories. We found that, while traditional land cover datasets primarily classified our case study regions as having stable classes over the timeseries, we identified many areas that experienced significant negative and non-linear trends in productivity. We also explored how our proposed classes manifest in detectable landscape patterns within our case study regions. We found that the positive trend classes tend to exhibit more regular shapes (likely due to the influence of the regular shapes of agricultural fields), while the negative trends exhibit more irregular shapes but are more aggregated at the landscape scale.Future work to quantify the global status of rangeland resources and degradation hinges on innovation in strategies for classification that encompass the dynamic nature of these systems. Our work builds on previous work on detecting trends in greenness by identifying timeseries signatures & linking them to known vegetation transitions, even in areas without change in dominant cover type.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nTERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS: Forecasting Sea-level Rise Impacts on Coastal Landscapes\n\nAUTHORS: Erika E. Lentz*, Sara L. Zeigler, E. Robert Thieler – U.S. Geological Coastal and Marine Science Center, Woods Hole, MA; Nathaniel Plant, U.S. Geological Coastal and Marine Science Center, St. Petersburg, FL\n\nABSTRACT: Sea-level rise (SLR) will result in widespread, variable, and possibly irreversible changes to built and natural coastal environments. Consequently, determining how the landscape will respond to varying amounts or rates of SLR can identify where coastal land is more likely to 1) be lost due to erosion or inundation; or 2) remain stable, and even adapt to future SLR. Through a probabilistic modeling approach, Lentz et al. [Nature Climate Change, doi: 10.1038/NCLIMATE2957,(2016)] developed a capability to forecast the likelihood that the Northeastern U.S. coast will either inundate or dynamically adapt to SLR under varying scenarios. The approach allowed us to couple known parameters (land cover, relative sea level rise scenarios, and elevation) with less well constrained components (future SLR rates and magnitudes, data uncertainties, tipping points for the response of different land cover types) to generate probabilistic estimates of future regional response at 30x30 m horizontal resolution.Using the predictions of Lentz et al. (2016), we apply uncertainty terminology to define and quantify potential changes in regional land cover state and at 26 sites representing varying levels of land cover diversity through the 2080s. Our results show that by as early as the 2020s, we cannot rule out inundation as a possible outcome for the majority of low-lying, habitable coastal land in the region– 56% of the land area comprised of marshes, beaches, forests, developed areas and rocky coast is as likely as not (P = 0.33 to 0.66) to inundate in response to SLR, increasing to 64% by the 2080s. We also find the near-term SLR resiliency and the rate at which state shifts are likely to occur are correlated with land cover heterogeneity, and alternatively, catastrophic state shifts may be more likely, sooner, in areas with lower diversity, such as heavily developed or urban locations.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n11:00am CDT\n\nPEOPLE AND LANDSCAPES: Understanding Change and Willingness to Change in Stakeholders’ Forest Management in the Northeast Humid Rainforest of Madagascar\n\nAUTHORS: Mamitiana Andriamanjato, BNC-REDD+ Madagascar; Deny Christian Zafindramiadana, Zo Hasina Rabemananjara, Patrick Ranjatson, Harifidy Rakoto Ratsimba* – Department of Water and Forest, School of Agronomy\n\nABSTRACT: The challenge between continuous increases of demand on natural resources and the need of balancing the interests on ecosystem services to support rural livelihoods becomes today more and more critical in developing countries. In Madagascar, despite its worldwide known richness in biodiversity, policies and strategies have failed until now to develop a sustainable management of natural resources. Our study is focused on a socio-ecological analysis of the landscape in the North East of Madagascar based on institutional analysis integrating all stakeholders (resource users and decision-makers) to observe the behavior change (logical process of decision) based on landscape changes (land use and land use change perception). The observation from quantitative analysis has been added to a natural resources management role playing game to understand the weight of each actor in the arena. Thus, the process has shown that the interest of stakeholders is not only based on economic factor (especially for cash crop investment), but also, on social interaction of all stakeholders with a specific power management which is created inside the arena itself (land tenure issue). These findings have shown the complexity of driving changes inside the arena without having any driving vision based on the stakeholder’s perception themselves. In this way, to be more effective, the policy making process has to be more participative and based on the perception of local communities.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:00am - 11:15am CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n11:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Analyzing Land Management Regimes to Inform Grassland Bird Conservation in the Chicago Wilderness Region\n\nAUTHORS: Daniel Suarez*, Audubon Great Lakes; Stephanie Beilke, Audubon Great Lakes,\n\nABSTRACT: Prairies once dominated Illinois landscapes, but are now on the brink of extinction in the state largely because of agricultural conversion. Nevertheless, scattered grassland habitat patches and corresponding bird populations have persisted throughout Illinois, including within the highly urbanized Chicago region. However, as these grassland patches are often isolated and have varied land ownership, land management activities also tend to occur in relative isolation. Audubon Great Lakes convened the Chicago Wilderness Grassland Bird Task Force to engage Chicago region partners and strategize grassland bird conservation at a regional level. The Task Force identified a need to synthesize grassland bird data and habitat management data across the seven-county region to begin to assess the state of Chicago Wilderness grasslands and inform best management practices and future monitoring. Task Force members, including Audubon Great Lakes, Illinois Audubon Society and the Bird Conservation Network, initiated data gathering in coordination with county land managers for the purpose of associating grassland bird presence/absence with specific habitat management activities. The results of our analysis were then documented in our annual collaborative “State of the Grasslands” report, which we shared broadly with landowners and stakeholders, thus introducing managers to the practices and results of neighboring counties. Annual reports and meetings will continue to provide opportunities for Task Force members to provide and receive feedback regarding land management and monitoring practices, while reinforcing our ultimate shared goal of improving grassland habitats and bird populations in the Chicago Wilderness.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:15am - 11:30am CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n11:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Telecoupled Fisheries: Insights and Applications for Sustainability\n\nAUTHORS: Andrew K. Carlson*, William W. Taylor, Jianguo Liu, Ivan Orlic – Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University\n\nABSTRACT: Fisheries are coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) across distant places, yet fisheries research has generally focused on better understanding either fisheries ecology or human dimensions in a specific place, rather than their interactions over distances. As economic and ideational globalization accelerate, fisheries are becoming more globally connected via movements of fish products and fisheries finances, information, and stakeholders throughout the world. As such, there is a pressing need for systematic approaches to assess these linkages among global fisheries, their effects on ecosystems and food security, and their implications for fisheries science and sustainability. Use of the telecoupling framework is a novel and insightful method to systematically evaluate socioeconomic and environmental interactions among CHANS. Here, we apply the telecoupling framework to the Peruvian anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) fishery, the world’s largest single-species commercial fishery and a complex CHANS. The anchoveta fishery has diverse and significant telecouplings – socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances – with the rest of the world, including fishmeal and fish oil trade, monetary flow, knowledge transfer, and movement of people. The use of the telecoupling framework reveals complex fishery dynamics such as feedbacks (e.g., profit maximization causing fishery overcapitalization) and surprises (e.g., stock collapse) resulting from local and long-distance ecological and socioeconomic interactions. The Peruvian anchoveta fishery illustrates how the telecoupling framework can be used to systematically assess the magnitude and diversity of local and distant fisheries interactions and thereby advance knowledge derived from traditional monothematic research approaches. Insights from the telecoupling framework provide a foundation from which to develop sustainable fisheries policy and management strategies across local, national, and international levels in a globalized world.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:15am - 11:30am CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n11:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: USGS Gap Analysis Project Habitat Maps: Prospects for Multi-species, Multi-scale Assessments of Habitat Fragmentation\n\nAUTHORS: Nathan Tarr*, Matthew Rubino – North Carolina Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit\n\nABSTRACT: We are exploring landscape fragmentation metrics suitable for large numbers of habitat maps at multiple scales to determine whether and how sufficient connectivity for species with dissimilar dispersal abilities and habitat preferences can co-occur in a landscape. The USGS Gap Analysis Project (GAP) will soon release seasonal habitat maps with 30m x 30m spatial resolution for over 1,500 species within the conterminous United States. Those maps can be processed into maps of habitat networks at multiple resolutions that can then be used for habitat assessments at broad extents, as well as theoretical studies of fragmentation and connectivity. The challenge is to find a set of biologically relevant metrics of landscape pattern along with computational methods that can be used to calculate those metrics for such a large dataset. We are leveraging data from GAP and other biological databases to identify areas of fragmented habitat for individual species, assessing the configuration of habitat in fragmented networks, and assessing network similarity among multiple species that co-occur in heterogeneous landscapes. We will report on efforts to determine the biological relevance and computational challenges of calculating and aggregating landscape metrics from multiple species and discuss the challenges and opportunities for using GAP habitat maps in assessments of fragmentation given gaps in biological knowledge and limitations in GAP data. Our talk will aim to spark discussion and elicit feedback on the prospects of developing multi-species, multi-scale methods for landscape assessment that could provide new insights and hypotheses for Landscape Ecology and contextualize landscape conservation plans and tools, such as the use of surrogate species and large, forested corridors.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:15am - 11:30am CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n11:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Uniting Behavior and Demography to Predict Connectivity in Space and Time\n\nAUTHORS: Robert Fletcher, University of Florida; Caroline Poli*, University of Florida; Miguel Acevedo, University of Puerto Rico; Jorge Sefair, Arizona State University; Divya Vasudev, Wildlife Conservation Society; Varun Goswami, Wildlife Conservation Society\n\nABSTRACT: Connectivity is fundamental to ecology, evolution, and conservation. Despite the increasing emphasis on connectivity across fields, accurately predicting and mapping connectivity in space and time has been challenging. Here we derive connectivity models from first principles regarding individual movement behavior and mortality risk across landscapes. We develop these models based on the framework of Absorbing Markov chains. These models isolate the role of the matrix on movement behavior and mortality risk, allow for straightforward integration of propagule pressure (e.g., occupancy and abundance), and provide analytical solutions for connectivity parameters of interest (e.g., probabilities of dispersal success) that explicitly acknowledge temporal variation in connectivity. We illustrate the modeling framework with both data from an experimental model system undergoing habitat loss and fragmentation as well as for human-wildlife conflict issues for elephant conservation across a broad region of India. Results from the experimental model system illustrate that this framework better predicts observed movement than existing frameworks for connectivity. Application to elephant conservation highlights how this framework can identify key areas for promoting connectivity while minimizing human-wildlife conflict. Importantly, the incorporation of mortality risk fundamentally alters predictions for connectivity. We provide guidance for the application of this framework for connectivity conservation.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 11:15am - 11:30am CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n12:00pm CDT\n\n12:00pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n3:00pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-07: Immersive Experiences for Grounding Environmental Decision Making\n\nAUTHORS: Alexander Klippel, The Pennsylvania State University; Jiawei Huang, The Pennsylvania State University; Melissa Lucash, Portland State University; Robert Scheller, North Carolina State University; Erica Smithwick, The Pennsylvania State University\n\nABSTRACT: Decision makers in environmental sciences around the world face the dilemma that planning for the future often requires abstract data as the primary basis for selecting a certain solution. The problem of abstract information is even more pronounced when the general public or lay people are part of the process as for them putting an environment they are used to interact with naturally into numeric (and at best graph-like) form is challenging. What does it actually mean that the biomass of tree species X is 16K cbm according to, for example, using climate change data from X to run a model on LANDIS II? We are in the position to offer decision-makers access to such an empirical experience based on recent development in 3D and immersive technologies. We modeled the composition of species in Wisconsin. The climate models used as input were made available through ## and taken as input for ecological modeling using LANDIS – II. Landings output was amended by ecological rules that allowed for deriving procedural rules necessary to guide, for example, the transformation of biomass into a distribution of trees in a specific area including assumptions about age distribution and spatial contagion. Using CityEngine as a bases for this modeling the resulting information and 3D models can be accessed through game engines such as Unity or rendered further using tools such as Lumion to increase the realism of the 3D model. We will discuss the overall approach, will offer insights into challenges such as how to address uncertainty in a 3D representation of the future of a natural environment, will showcase access modalities such as mobile phone based applications for head-mounted immersive experiences, and will discuss evaluation plans for assessing the value of immersive, embodied experiences for environmental decision making.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 3:45pm - 4:00pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-08: Designing Restorations to Inform Conservation Practice and Ecological Theory: Lessons from Long-term Studies in Tallgrass Prairie\n\nAUTHORS: Sara G. Baer, Department of Plant Biology, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale\n\nABSTRACT: A major limitation to advancing ecological theory and its application to ecological restoration is the existence of landscape-scale experimental frameworks designed to capture community and ecosystem responses to manipulated, natural, and anthropogenic changes in ecological drivers. The power to predict ecological responses to restoration and plan conservation strategies for the future ultimately depends on developing restoration designs with adequate statistical rigor to generate a degree of certainty about responses and ability to forecast change. To build such understanding, ecological drivers can be manipulated simultaneously in time and space. Long-term studies in native and restored prairie demonstrate dynamic and unexpected community responses to field-scale management (i.e., fire and grazing) and small-scale variation in soil resources. When manipulating ecological drivers, sampling needs to be scaled to account for functionally different species. Assessing community response to variation in regional ecological drivers can be addressed by restoring vegetation at the same time in different places. These studies offer insights into ecological-evolutionary relationships, but are complicated by uncontrolled variation in multiple environmental conditions. Community responses to environmental variation can also be tested by using comparable restoration methods in the same place at different times. This approach is being used to reveal the role of interannual variation in climate and other stochastic factors on the development of grassland states. A drawback to this approach is reliance on nature to provide temporal variability in environmental conditions. Lastly, restorations conducted using comparable methods at different times and different places with similar conditions enables space-for-time substitutions that can be used to model and predict long-term changes from a one-time sampling. In sum, for restorations to inform practice and advance ecological knowledge, they need to be designed for short- and long-term hypothesis testing.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 3:45pm - 4:00pm CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\nURBAN/EXURBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY: Small Mites, Big City: Using Large-scale Wildlife Camera Monitoring to Examine the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Sarcoptic Mange in Chicago’s Urban Coyotes\n\nAUTHORS: Maureen H. Murray*, Urban Wildlife Institute and Davee Center for Endocrinology and Epidemiology, Lincoln Park Zoo; Mason Fidino, Travis Gallo, Liza Lehrer, Seth Magle – Urban Wildlife Institute, Lincoln Park Zoo.\n\nABSTRACT: Landscape composition and configuration can influence the prevalence of wildlife disease through their effects on host movement and abundance. For example, urbanization can influence host abundance and community structure by fragmenting habitat patches, which could simultaneously limit host movement and impact habitat quality. The coyote (Canis latrans) is abundant in cities across North America and a host for the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, a common parasite of canids that causes lesions and hair loss known as sarcoptic mange. Because S. scabiei causes visible signs, wildlife cameras can be used to monitor its occurrence non-invasively across large spatial and temporal scales. We used seven years of camera trapping data from the Chicago urban wildlife biodiversity monitoring program to test whether the occurrence of sarcoptic mange increases 1) along an urban gradient, 2) during the fall when young disperse, and 3) in patches where the occurrence of canid hosts (i.e. coyotes, foxes, and domestic dogs) is higher. We deployed camera traps (n = 120) along three 50 km transects radiating out from Chicago’s urban center and cameras were active seasonally. From photographs, we recorded whether a canid was present and whether hair loss or lesions consistent with sarcoptic mange were visible. We then used a mixed modeling framework to quantify the influence of urban cover, season, canid occurrences, and year on the proportion of coyote occurrences with signs of mange and included site as a random effect. We found high variation in the occurrence of mange across sites and higher occurrence in the fall and winter. Our results will help clarify the role of landscape factors that influence parasite prevalence in urban wildlife populations. These advances can help mitigate health risks for urban wildlife and the transmission of parasites between wildlife, pets, and people.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 3:45pm - 4:00pm CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\nLANDSCAPE PATTERN & PROCESS: Early Warning Signal of Landscape Connectivity and Resilience Towards Natural Climate Solutions\n\nAUTHORS: Yi Li, Bingchao Yin, Yangfan Li* – Xiamen University\n\nABSTRACT: The ever-increasing and unprecedented impacts of human activities on natural landscape are dramatically altering heterogeneous of habitats and biodiversity globally. In this study, we modeled the climate connectivity in China’s coastal provinces referring to three aspects of human influence (HI). The climate-gradient oriented landscape connectivity offers the first map capable of informing landscape connectivity in China’s coastal area. We demonstrate that more than 50% of coastal areas was challenged by vast influences above the average value of HI, especially in the coastal metropolitan cities. Only 24% of natural lands retained enough connectivity in 2010 to allow animals to move through temperature gradient corridors as the climate warms. Moreover, the critical junctions of pinch points and early warning points, as the stepping stones to landscape connectivity, were mainly detected in semi-natural lands (forest and grassland). Our research found that these points constrained climate connectivity; however, facilitating connections in the semi-natural lands initiates the permeability of landscape connectivity to track suitable climates. By connecting fragmented patches into a landscape network as the natural climate solution, the transition zones highlight priority locations for ecologists and conservation managers to configure the most effective areas for enhancing landscape connectivity.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 3:45pm - 4:00pm CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\nINSECT ECOLOGY: Local and Landscape Factors Influence Bumble Bee Foraging Dynamics in a Resource Pulse Landscape\n\nAUTHORS: Vera Pfeiffer*, Janet Silbernagel, Christelle Guedot, Juan Zalapa – University of Wisconsin- Madison\n\nABSTRACT: Native pollinators provide an important ecosystem service for many pollination-dependent fruit crops and wild bees require nesting and foraging resources in proximity to target crop plants. Consequently, landscape resources influence the distribution of pollination services, which may fluctuate temporally through the season due to pollinators’ foraging preferences. This study investigates how floral resources and landscape context influence bumble bee colony density and fluctuation between the growing season and the target crop pulse. We sampled bumble bees at fourteen cranberry marshes before, during, and after the cranberry bloom in central Wisconsin. Two sites supplemented wild bumble bees with commercial colonies, which were separately analyzed. Floral richness and surrounding land cover were quantified and their effects on individual and colony density were assessed using linear regression models and variance partitioning. The percentage of forest or cultivated land best predicted individual and colony density during almost all temporal extents. The interspersion of meadow through the surrounding landscape and the total bog edge were also useful in top regression models. Floral richness was the primary factor influencing individual density during bloom, as well as the change in colony density between the growing season and the bloom when change accounts for detection. Landscapes with large agricultural field sizes and very clumpy forest experienced a decrease in colony detection probability, and likely colony dependence during bloom. We suggest that maintaining forested land and interspersed meadow around cultivated fruit crops is important for colony abundance, and bolstering floral richness locally will draw in more bees when floral resources are abundant.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 3:45pm - 4:00pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: The Effect of Global Food Trade on Biodiversity in an Importing Country\n\nAUTHORS: Ciara Hovis*, Jianguo (Jack) Liu – Michigan State University\n\nABSTRACT: Global food trade drives land use/cover change, which has consequences for species that utilize agroecosystems. The majority of studies on land use changes driven by global food trade focus on countries that produce and export food because of the dramatic change from natural to agricultural landscapes. However, little attention has been paid to the effects of global trade on biodiversity in importing countries, which undergo more subtle land cover/use changes in the form of crop switching and abandonment as imports have substantial effects on domestic crop prices, and thereby land use decision-making. Here, we investigated bird diversity across Heilongjiang Province in China, the world’s largest soybean importer (39% of the world’s total soy imports in 2013 went to China). In 2017, we surveyed bird diversity across agricultural and natural landscapes to analyze how landscape change impacts the region’s bird diversity. Thirty-six bird species were identified in this survey. Preliminary results show that soybean imports have increased landscape diversity (both compositional and configurational), which in turn supports higher bird species diversity. The results of this research can be used to inform landscape planning in agricultural areas, and also predict how farmer decision making will ultimately impact biodiversity in a telecoupled world.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Space Use and Habitat Use of a Nomadic Wading Bird Varies by Season and Degree of Urbanization\n\nAUTHORS: Anjelika D.

Murray, Sonia M. Hernandez – Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, University of Georgia, Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia\n\nABSTRACT: When animals adapt to urbanized landscapes, they often exhibit altered behaviors, such as reduced home range sizes, increased site fidelity, and resource switching from natural to urban resources. The American White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) is a nomadic wading bird that typically moves unpredictably between wetlands of the Everglades and throughout the Southeastern U.S. searching for ephemeral wetland foraging conditions. Within the last two decades, ibis in south Florida are increasingly found foraging in urban areas and relying on artificial wetland-like habitats (e.g., urban ponds, water reclamation sites). As part of a larger effort investigating avian health and ecology in wildland versus urban habitats, we characterize movement behaviors of ibis across an urbanization gradient to understand the relationship between anthropogenic resource availability and changes in ibis ecology. Ibises (n = 48) were captured in urban parks and wetlands in south Florida and outfitted with GPS transmitters recording up to 12 locations per day. We based ibis degree of urbanization on non-breeding habitat use, when their resource selection is least constrained. Ibis range sizes, site fidelity, and use of urban and other habitats were compared to urbanization scores for non-breeding, breeding, and transitional seasons. As ibis degree of urbanization increased, range size decreased and site fidelity increased. During the breeding season, range size and location changed for both urban and wildland ibis, likely to accommodate nesting requirements. Ibises were more likely to use urban areas during the non-breeding season than while breeding, presumably because urban habitats are associated with lower quality resources such as inadequate rookery sites and human-provided food. In contrast to previous VHF-telemetry studies, GPS data provides a fine-scale picture of movements along an urbanization gradient and into remote areas; information instrumental in understanding how species change their movement ecology when adapting to urbanized landscapes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-06: Social Demand and Cross-Scale Interactions in a Riverine Social-Ecological System\n\nAUTHORS: Jason P. Julian*, Russell Weaver, Graham Daly – Texas State University\n\nABSTRACT: Central Texas is the fastest growing region in the USA. Caught in the middle of this emerging mega-region is the San Marcos River watershed, which provides a suite of ecosystem services to one of the fastest growing cities in the USA, a rapidly growing University student population, and millions of tourists each year. In order to assess the supply and demand of ecosystem services provided by the San Marcos River and its watershed, we conducted 3,193 surveys among these stakeholder groups. Answers from our 49-question survey revealed that there were five distinct stakeholder groups: Non-student Residents, Student Residents, Regional Students, Regional Tourists, and Non-regional Tourists. One key variable emerged that significantly differentiated these groups with respect to their use, preference, and value of ecosystem services: mobility, particularly in terms of the individual’s origin and how often they visit the river. This mobility and its effect on social demand creates cross-scale interactions that can lead to negative and positive feedbacks in this social-ecological system. In our system, a positive feedback occurred where as individual use of the river increased, so did their value and preference of particular ecosystem services. We also found that as temporal use of the river increased at the global scale, a negative feedback occurred where people at the regional scale avoided the river, even more so than at the local scale. Overall, our findings demonstrate that within this social-ecological system, actors at the individual, stakeholder, regional, and global scales interact to define the supply and demand of ecosystem services.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-07: Using a Digital Natural Resource Atlas to Enhance Communication and Effective Decision Making\n\nAUTHORS: Lucinda B.

We are developing a comprehensive web-based Natural Resource Atlas for NE Minnesota comprising geospatial data and analysis tools designed to inform resource management decisions. The goal is promote objective decision-making processes that are anchored in more complete and integrative information sources, resulting in decisions and actions that are more transparent and effective. Potential uses include prioritizing restoration or conservation sites; identifying sometimes controversial mineral, forestry, water and tourism opportunities; and providing unbiased, trustworthy data to communities, industry, businesses, and agencies for shared decision making. The system will integrate data from multiple disciplines and cover topics associated with infrastructure, socioeconomics, climate, geology, forestry, biology, water, and landscapes. Interdependencies among different data will be highlighted using map visualizations, graphical and tabular summaries, and descriptive statistics. Natural resource decision makers, managers, and stakeholders from a number of sectors of the community have been consulted throughout the planning and will help pilot test the Atlas to ensure usability and relevance. Their input will drive the design of the user interface along with the types of data analysis and visualization tools embedded. Case studies are demonstrating use of the tool and are being developed through an elicitation process with science experts. Throughout the system’s development over the past year it has become apparent that this set of tools will also be used by scientists and communicators within and outside the organization. Involving end users early in the design phase has highlighted important data gaps, and has driven the development of novel data layers, including e.g., a statewide map of mineral potential.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-08: Succession in a Human-dominated Landscape: Lessons Learned for Land Management\n\nAUTHORS: Scott J. Meiners, Eastern Illinois University\n\nABSTRACT: The restoration of any habitat is really the management of successional processes. In succession, site qualities, species availability and the differential performance of species generate temporal dynamics. In restoration, site qualities are often manipulated as well as species availability, through direct seedling or planting. This is done with the hopes that the performance of species will respond to the manipulations and generate a community similar to the desired target. Data from a 60 year study of succession, the Buell-Small Succession Study (BSS), in suburbanized New Jersey will be used to illustrate successional processes and relate them to the Cook County Forest Preserve restoration project. Invasive plant species have been the primary conservation concern in the BSS, though most have been transitory in their dominance of the system. Invaders which inhibit key successional transitions or that are likely to persist at the successional endpoint represent strong candidates for control to optimize resource utilization. High densities of deer have also begun to limit forest recruitment and understory development of the BSS and will also likely be an issue for the Forest Preserve restoration. Initial survey data may yield suggestions for management, but temporal trajectories revealed through continued monitoring will be the strongest indicators of both success and developing issues. Above all, succession is context dependent, something that restoration has yet to grapple with sufficiently. The wide range of sites, conditions and contexts encompassed by the Cook County Forest Preserve restoration will allow unparalleled assessment of restoration approaches employed across a heterogeneous landscape. Continual analysis of vegetation monitoring data will also yield much information on a wide variety of ecological issues and plans should be made to regularly exploit this region-specific data set.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nURBAN/EXURBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY: Continental Scale Variation in the Cooling Effect of Urban Vegetation\n\nAUTHORS: Peter Ibsen *, University of California Riverside; Mary Santelmann, Oregon State University; Michelle Talal, Oregon State University; Chris Swan, University of Maryland Baltimore Campus; Dorothy Borowy, University of Maryland Baltimore Campus; David Hondula, Arizona State University; Mary Wright, Arizona State University; Darrel Jenerette,University of California Riverside\n\nABSTRACT: The combination of increasing urbanization and global warming make cities a hot-spot for climate research. A major research focus is on mitigation of increasing urban warming through vegetation-derived microscale cooling. While vegetation has a documented cooling effect on land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature (Tair), uncertainty exists over the mechanism behind that effect and scale of the drivers. Here we ask how does shading or transpiration drive vegetation cooling, and how cooling effect strength varies from regional to continental scales? To resolve these issues, we placed ~400 Tair and ~100 relative humidity (RH) sensors in four large cities representing varying regional climates (Los Angeles, Portland, Phoenix, Baltimore) during the summer of 2017. To capture a broad range of urban vegetation density, we stratified sensor placement to binned categories of vegetation density. Vegetation density was quantified via satellite measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Sensors recorded microclimate variables of Tair and RH hourly for ~84 days in each city. Microclimate variables in each city were regressed against local NDVI to assess how vegetation affects regional climate. We then regressed mean city-specific effect size (slopes of NDVI~Tair) with regional classifications of citywide vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Initial results show a pronounced difference of cooling effectiveness among cities, with strongest effects in cities with lower average VPD. All cities experienced changes in in cooling effect size during local heat waves, however, the slope direction differed depending on regional climate, with a negative nighttime effect in humid cities, and an positive effect in arid cities. These results show that vegetation-derived cooling cannot be explained through shading alone, as vegetation density does not explain the changes in effect size within different cities. Resolving mechanism and driver strength of cooling provides better resources for urban climate modeling and warming mitigation.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nLANDSCAPE PATTERN & PROCESS: Relationships Between the Ecological Strategies of Persistent Plant Communities and Spatial Configuration of Sites Within a Landscape\n\nAUTHORS: Kristopher Bonefont*, Northwestern University; Jeremie Fant, Chicago Botanic Garden\n\nABSTRACT: The environmental consequences of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity have been studied both in natural and controlled experiments, resulting in a broad range of outcomes that are understood to contribute to the detriment of ecosystems. However, recent findings suggest that when experiments control for habitat amount, the spatial arrangement may mitigate the impacts of habitat loss. These factors may play a part in the maintenance of naturally discontinuous communities, despite having amounts thought to be insufficient for their long-term persistence. In this study, we aimed to determine the dominant plant traits that characterize community-wide responses to the spatial configuration of habitats across a naturally-fragmented landscape. We selected 38 dry prairies sites with plant community data. We extracted spatial configuration metrics at landscape extents that had moderate amounts of suitable habitat. Ten plant traits related to the persistence, dispersal, and establishment were selected to characterize the ecological response to habitat configuration. Double-inertia analysis and linear modeling were used to explore the links between the configuration and plant attributes. Results obtained by performing the analysis on a subset of species have already provided relationships between trait attributes and the configurational gradients that we believe influence them. Patch complexity and edge contrast were negatively associated with plant height and degree of habitat specialization, while habitat aggregation and patch cohesion negatively associated with clonality, pollination syndrome, and seed dormancy. Preliminary results suggest that at an intermediate level of fragmentation, the configuration of habitats acts as a filter on species attributes. Understanding how configuration structures the functional dominance of communities improves our ability to predict which species persist, while also offering us the possibility of manipulating the configurational attributes of fragmented sites for conservation purposes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\nINSECT ECOLOGY: Local and Landscape Determinants of the Rare Cranberry Blue Butterfly (Plebejus optilete): What Matters, and How Much Does the Landscape Matter?\n\nAUTHORS: Federico Riva*, University of Alberta and Land Reclamation International Graduate School; John H. Acorn, University of Alberta; Scott E. Nielsen, University of Alberta and Land Reclamation International Graduate School\n\nABSTRACT: Understanding the interplay between ecological processes and spatial patterns across multiple scales is an important focus of landscape ecology. Because this relationship determines species’ occurrence, it is also fundamental in conservation planning, especially when the aim is to protect a rare species. One native species of conservation interest in North America is the cranberry blue butterfly (Plebejus optilete). In Alberta, Canada, the cranberry blue is considered imperiled with few occurrences known (< 15), generally in treed peatlands. There is concern that this species will be negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbances associated with seismic assessments of underground oil sands reserves. These disturbances are narrow (< 10 m), but dense (up to 40 km/km2), early seral corridors cleared across thousands of km2 of boreal forests, including where cranberry blues are found. Here, we investigated how variation in patterns in natural and anthropogenic forest characteristics affect the occurrence of cranberry blue butterflies. Forests in the region naturally transition from wetland to upland environments, and are characterized by periodic wildfires. To examine responses of cranberry blues to wildfires and anthropogenic sources of disturbance, we sampled butterflies along 250-m transects at five point-counts across 40 sites, and modeled the species occurrence based on fire severity, forest structure, forest fragmentation, and soil wetness, each measured directly at the site and at the landscape with a GIS.In total, we discovered 14 new populations across a 2,500-km2 region of northeast Alberta. Cranberry blues preferred open treed peatlands, and were sensitive to local variation in habitat. While we found no evidence of negative effects from the anthropogenic forest corridors, recent wildfires decreased species occurrence. Although local characteristics are the primary determinant of species occurrence, amount of surrounding treed peatland conditioned the local presence of cranberry blues, confirming that the landscape can fulfill important roles in moderating ecological processes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:00pm - 4:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Migratory Wildlife Link People and Ecosystems over Distances\n\nAUTHORS: Ta-Ken Huang*, School of Natural Resources and the Environment, The University of Arizona; Darius Semmens, Geosciences & Environmental Change Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey ; Laura López-Hoffman, School of Natural Resources and the Environment, The University of Arizona; Jay E. Diffendorfer, Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey; Wayne E. Thogmartin, Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nABSTRACT: Migratory species link ecosystems and people around the world. Their management and conservation requires an approach integrating both ecological and socioeconomic dimensions to reveal these linkages across space. We demonstrate a framework built around the concept that migratory species act as carriers or agents, delivering ecosystem services to people throughout their annual cycle. The resulting benefit flows can be viewed as spatial economic subsidies from ecologically important habitat to socioeconomically important areas where migratory wildlife interact with people. Quantifying these benefit flows between source and delivery areas permits a more comprehensive understanding of the spatial distribution of benefits and costs associated with the conservation of migratory species across international borders. To illustrate our framework, we present case studies quantifying the spatial subsidies provided by migratory species. Management and policy scenarios are used to consider feedbacks within these linked socioeconomic and environmental systems over time. We discuss data needs, methods, and lessons learned from these case studies, as well as implications for trans-border management and conservation of coupled human-natural systems involving migratory species.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:15pm - 4:30pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Response of Lesser Prairie-Chickens to Anthropogenic Structures During Long-Distance Movements\n\nAUTHORS: Jacob Peterson, Oklahoma State University; Julia Earl, Louisiana Tech University; Sam Fuhlendorf, Oklahoma State University; Dwayne Elmore, Oklahoma State University; Ashley M. Tanner, Oklahoma State University; David Haukos, U.S. Geological Survey, Kansas Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, Kansas State University; Scott Carleton, U.S. Geological Survey, New Mexico Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, New Mexico State University\n\nABSTRACT: In increasingly fragmented landscapes, connectivity among populations is an important concern. Long distance movements, including dispersal, exploratory loops, and movements between home ranges, can contribute to fitness and population persistence through increased resource availability and genetic dispersal. As the spatial separation of a populations increases, questions concerning how species utilize and interact with their environment during long-distance movement are inherent to their conservation. Lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) are a grassland obligate species that have been impacted by land use change and fragmentation of contiguous native prairie. Densities of different anthropogenic structures (i.e., towers, oil wells, roads, powerlines, and fences) vary across regions and movement types. Movements of 344 birds were obtained using satellite GPS transmitters across their distribution in western Kansas, Oklahoma panhandle, eastern Colorado, and southeast New Mexico between 2013 and 2016. In preliminary analysis, 85 individuals made 184 long-distance movements. Effects of anthropogenic structures were assessed along long-distance movement tracts and areas surrounding the home ranges of individuals. Cumulative distribution functions were used to test for selection or avoidance of the different features across multiple scales and subcategories (i.e., study region and movement type). Analyses suggest lesser prairie-chickens respond to high voltage power lines (> 69 kV) and oil wells in a consistent negative pattern up to an inflection point that varies by region (5000–10000 m and 500–2500 m respectively). Other features showed variation in selection or avoidance by region. Comparing the CDF results for multiple scales reveals that the inflection point generally decreases as the available area around movement tracts increases. Further analyses will examine the drivers of this trend and whether feature density has an impact on avoidance in regions. These results are important to understand possible barriers or obstacles to long-distance movements and ensure connectivity among populations for the conservation of this species.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:15pm - 4:30pm CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-06: Sharing the Savanna: Patterns of Hardwood Resource Utilization by Humans and Elephants in Northern Botswana\n\nAUTHORS: Erin Buchholtz*, Texas A&M University, Ecoexist Project; Lauren Redmore, Texas A&M University, Ecoexist Project; Susanne Vogel, University of Oxford, Ecoexist Project; Lee Fitzgerald, Texas A&M University; Amanda Stronza, Ecoexist Project, Texas A&M University; Anna Songhurst, Ecoexist Project, University of Oxford, Texas A&M University; Graham McCulloch, Ecoexist Project, University of Oxford, Texas A&M University\n\nABSTRACT: When humans and wildlife both rely on the same natural resources, it becomes important to understand their interactions ecologically as well as for issues of conservation, conflict, and coexistence. Our research focuses on hardwood trees in the Eastern Okavango Panhandle of Botswana as a way to study the demands for natural resources in a social-ecological system. Hardwoods are a staple of elephant diet and are heavily relied on for firewood by people in the region, however, spatial and temporal proximity to each other can be risky for both species. Our research will calculate an index of selection for elephants, based on proportional frequency of browsing and availability of hardwood species encountered. Data on human hardwood collection will be analyzed for use preference and availability as well, and this selection index compared with that of the elephants. Our anticipated results will be that there will be overlap in hardwood species selection among humans and elephants and that variation in preference will be related to nutritional content (for elephants) and burning characteristics (for humans). We will also analyze spatial overlap of human firewood collection pathways and elephant movement based on participatory mapping and elephant GPS collar data. Although risky, we anticipate high spatial overlap between the two because elephant browsing damages trees and creates dry wood that is harvested by humans. These analyses of hardwood use may reveal important risk-reward dynamic interactions that have not been evident in previous human-elephant conflict work focused on agricultural crop-raiding. Overall, this will result in a better understanding of the linked social-ecological system revolving around resource use where humans and elephants share the landscape.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 4:15pm - 4:30pm CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n5:00pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Local and Landscape-Scale Predictors of Egg-Mass Abundance in Wood Frogs and Spotted Salamanders in Southeastern Massachusetts\n\nAUTHORS: Amanda Deguire*, Thilina Surasinghe, Emily Donahue, Jackie Toomey, Sarah Jones – Bridgewater State University\n\nABSTRACT: Given their ephemeral nature and small size, vernal pools are unique habitats that are critical for temperate amphibians with a biphasic life cycle. Both local and landscape-scale predictors of amphibian occupancy at vernal pools have been extensively studied, and these species responses can vary significantly across geographies. In this study, we explored effects of land-cover change at variable spatial scales on the egg-mass abundance of two widespread North American amphibians— wood frogs and spotted salamanders. We surveyed egg masses at eight vernal pools located in southeastern Massachusetts in March-April period (2016-2017), and estimated several local (canopy cover, pool width, and upland basal area) and landscape scale (percent forested and built-up land-cover types around 100m, 500m and 1km radius around the vernal pool) environmental variables. Although egg-mass abundance of both focal species was greater in vernal pools located in rural landscapes than those of urban landscapes (wood frogs: urban=15.17, rural=30.27; spotted salamanders: urban=8.17, rural=43.81), those differences were statistically insignificant for wood frogs whereas a significantly greater number of spotted-salamander egg masses were found in rural vernal pools. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that the percent forest cover around a 500m-buffer is a significant predictor of species composition of egg masses. A multiple stepwise generalized linear model indicated that canopy cover, pool width, forest cover at all spatial scales, and built-up land-cover at 1km radius being important predictors for egg-mass abundance of spotted salamanders. The same modeling approach showed that canopy cover, pool width, and both built-up and forest land-cover at all spatial scales being important predictors for egg-mass abundance of wood frogs. Our study shows the importance of both urban and forested vernal pools for amphibian breeding. Regional municipalities should retool their biodiversity conservation efforts where vernal pools are protected at landscape-scale as interconnected wetland-woodland habitat complexes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Looking Beyond the Mean: Drivers of Variability in Postfire Stand Development of Rocky Mountain Conifers\n\nAUTHORS: Kristin H. Braziunas*, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Winslow D. Hansen, University of Wisconsin-Madison; Rupert Seidl, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) Vienna; Werner Rammer, University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences (BOKU) Vienna; Monica G. Turner, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nABSTRACT: High-severity, infrequent fires in subalpine forests shape landscape mosaics of stand age and structure for decades to centuries, and forest structure can vary substantially even among same-aged stands. We used a individual-based forest process model (iLand) to ask: (1) How do early postfire regeneration density, climate, and soil characteristics influence among-stand variation in structure (stand density, basal area) of same-aged forest stands over stand development, and (2) How does the relative influence of these drivers vary among species? We parameterized iLand for lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca), Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii), and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa). Simulations were initialized with field data on regeneration following stand-replacing fires in Greater Yellowstone, and stand development was simulated for 300 years under current climate without further disturbance. We expected variation in regeneration density to drive structural variability among young stands and variation in climate and soils to become increasingly important as stands aged. We expected regeneration to influence stand structural variability of lodgepole pine more than other conifers, due to its wider range of initial stem densities. Simulated stand structures fell within observed ranges, and among-stand variation persisted over time. For over 75 years postfire, variation in stand densities was due primarily to initial differences in regeneration density. Climate or soils were more important drivers of variation in Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and subalpine fir stand densities by 170 years postfire, but early regeneration densities had the greatest influence on among-stand variation in lodgepole pine densities for nearly 300 years. Among-stand basal areas converged faster than densities, and by 50 years postfire, climate was a more important driver of variation in lodgepole pine basal area than early regeneration density. Understanding dynamics of postfire stand development is increasingly important for anticipating future landscape patterns as fire activity increases.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Mapping Floristic Gradients of Forest Composition Using Ordination and Landsat OLI Imagery in Southern Ohio’s Central Hardwoods\n\nAUTHORS: Bryce T. Adams*, Stephen N. Matthews – School of Environment and Natural Resources, The Ohio State University; Matthew P. Peters, Louis R. Iverson – Northern Research Station, U.S. Forest Service\n\nABSTRACT: Forests of eastern North America are incurring rapid species turnover as a result of recent changes to natural and anthropogenic disturbance processes and climate change. We employed an ordination-regression approach to mapping the current species composition of forest assemblages as floristic gradients in a 5,000-km2 area in southern Ohio’s Central Hardwoods Forest Region. Forest plot data (n = 699 plots; 99 species/genera) that comprehensively sampled the composition of both overstory and understory woody species across structurally- (open to closed canopy) and topographically-variable forest conditions were projected onto a 3D ordination solution using non-metric multidimensional scaling. Floristic gradients, via their ordination scores, were related to spectral reflectance provided by a multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI image using the regression-type Random Forest model. Approximately 53%, 42%, and 18% of the variation in the first, second, and third axes were captured by the Landsat spectra, respectively. The three predicted axes were merged to a RGB color composite for the final floristic gradient map, displaying the 3D compositional complexity across the landscape in terms of variation in color. The color of each pixel subsequently references to its unique position within the original 3D ordination space and, thus, a statistical approximation of its specific species composition. Our case study determined that this approach is a highly effective means to mapping forest cover types, and remains an attractive alternative to traditional classifications, utilizing discrete classes or clusters, because it is time-efficient, more realistic in that compositional turnover is represented in continuous fields rather than arbitrary breaks, and it overcomes the generalization problem inherent in categorizing groups a priori. Moving forward, our model will be a valuable tool in developing suitable management options on individual forest stands for restoration of desired species, adapting to a changing climate, and improving wildlife habitat quality in southern Ohio’s forest lands.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Network Theory and Post-fire Landscapes: Linking Connectivity to Forest Reorganization in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem\n\nAUTHORS: Jamie L Peeler*; Erica Smithwick – The Pennsylvania State University\n\nABSTRACT: Forests in the western United States are projected to experience more frequent and larger fires in coming decades due to increased temperatures, earlier spring snowmelt, and longer fire seasons associated with global warming. Due to this anticipated increase in fire activity, recent research has identified factors that influence post-fire forest resilience: distance to unburned area, soils, and post-fire climate. However, few studies have explored how the arrangement and interactions of these factors contribute to forest resilience, especially at the landscape level. Spatial resilience is an important framework for understanding the spatial links that support forest resilience in an increasingly fire-prone world. In particular, spatial resilience leverages a useful theoretical lens for tackling the challenge: network theory. Here we propose a framework for using network theory to predict how mixed conifer forests will reorganize following fire in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Links to re-establish nodes are determined by interactions between dispersal and local site conditions, as re-establishment is dependent on material legacies (e.g. seeds and resprouts) reaching nodes with suitable post-fire climate, soils, and topography. However, networks may differ based on post-fire regeneration traits: resprouting, having an aerial seedbank that releases seeds when cued by fire (serotiny), and re-seeding via wind or animal. In post-fire landscapes, such insight is critical because fire may interact with dissimilar networks differently, causing some to become brittle more rapidly. This causes nodes to become less connected or less suitable for certain material legacies, while other material legacies maintain their connectivity. If mismatches in connectivity reach a threshold, then a node may re-establish differently. Accordingly, we ask: Do the structures of seeding, sprouting, and serotinous networks differ and how does fire alter these networks? Can connectivity metrics be used to predict how forests will reorganize post-fire?\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: North American and Asian Cities Show Contrasting Trends in Urban Greenspace Over Recent Decades\n\nAUTHORS: Jiali Jin*, Research Institute of Forestry & Laboratory of Tree Breeding and Cultivation, State Forestry Administration & Urban Forest Research Centre, State Forestry Administration, Chinese Academy of Forestry; Sarah E.

Coops, Integrated Remote Sensing Studio, Department of Forest Resources Management, Faculty of Forestry, University of British Columbia; Cheng Wang, Research Institute of Forestry & Laboratory of Tree Breeding and Cultivation, State Forestry Administration & Urban Forest Research Centre, State Forestry Administration, Chinese Academy of Forestry\n\nABSTRACT: Urbanization is responsible for vegetation loss and landscape fragmentation impacting ecological processes, ecosystem services and human health. As such, urban greenspace which provides significant environmental benefits, is critical for both residents and wildlife in urban areas. Pan-Pacific cities are the fastest urbanizing centres in the world and home to nearly 55% of the global urban population. However, a lack of cross-site comparison limits our understanding of changing greenspace in such cities. To investigate changes in greenspace heterogeneity, we built annual Landsat composites from 1984 to 2012 for 16 cities across seven countries in the pan-Pacific region to answer two primary questions: 1) Do trends in greenspace heterogeneity change over time?; 2) How does greenspace heterogeneity vary along urban gradients? Normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) were used to distinguish four classes of greenspace using a thresholding technique. Landscape metrics including Edge Density (ED) and Percentage of Landscape (PLAND) were used to characterize the greenspace attributes. Temporal dynamics of greenspace were assessed using the Mann-Kendall test. Applied generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) helped describe the change trajectory of ED and PLAND and evaluate differences among “greening” and “browning” cities. Gradient analysis of spatial patterns along all radial directions from city centres was used to detect directional changes in greenspace. We also used Principle components analysis (PCA) to find the metrics most useful in comparing the differences between Asian and North American cities. Our results suggest that more than half of pan-Pacific cities became greener as they became wealthier. In contrast to browning cities, most greening cities showed increases in dense vegetation along the urban gradient. Compared to North American cities, dense vegetation in Asian cities increased and became less fragmented. These comparisons can be used to guide future planning for green infrastructure at regional scales.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Ophiocordyceps Sinensis Availability and Range in Western Himalaya - Tragedy of Commons and Climate Variability Impacts on Alpine Ecosystem\n\nAUTHORS: Regina B Thomas*, University of Kansas; Xingong Li*, University of Kansas; Gautam Talukdar, Wildlife Institute of India\n\nABSTRACT: Micro-climate of high altitude regions is influenced by global climate variations and indirectly the local livelihoods of mountain communities. Between 3000m - 4500m altitude in the western Himalayas in India a mountain community is irrevocably dependent economically on a medicinal fungus beginning late 1990s. This medicinal fungus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, is sensitive to climate variability, human-interactions and has a limited evolutionary capacity. This study delineates the potential geographic distribution region and conducts a spatio-temporal comparison for clear visualization for any range variations. Maxent model is used to predict the geographic distribution area and range variations between 2010 -2017; only field validated occurrence points are used in combination with abiotic factors viz. product of NDVI, snow cover frequency from MODIS data along with topographical variables. The range variations are distributed into two short periods of three years each In addition, participatory research practice helps us argue that the current harvest practice discourages recuperation of the medicinal fungus and there is visible climatic variability and consequences on the landscape in last two decades. Although, this study does not intend to delve into value assessment of the ecosystem instead it focuses on the climate variability effects on the species as a surrogate to draw chain of effects on the alpine ecosystem and human communities. The results from a preliminary analysis have indicated variations in potential suitable range, as its inability to rapidly adapt to a new zone is uncertain it will have a major negative impact on the local livelihood.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Optimal Predictor Variables of Urban Hawk Breeding Success\n\nAUTHORS: Justin White, University of Wisconsin-Parkside\n\nABSTRACT: Urban habitats in North America can be both resource islands and ecological traps for raptors, but various characteristics of the urban landscape impact individual species differently. The complexity of urban environments make it difficult to identify which variables most impact reproductive efforts. To identify the optimal predictor of Red-tailed Hawk nesting success, I examined eight characteristics of the urban landscape (nightlight, noise level, building height, building footprint, employee density, residential density, an index of overall urban density, and land cover type (agriculture, riparian, impervious, trees, desert shrub)) at four spatial scales for 110 nests in Reno, NV during the 2015-16 breeding seasons. Nests were considered successful if they produced at least one fledgling. Success was calculated using a logistic exposure model with a binomial response and a logistic exposure link function. Models were created with all variable combinations, excluding those that were collinearly related. The final models were chosen based on their Akaike’s Information Criterion scores. The optimal predictor of nesting success was land cover type when measured within a 670-m radius (the nearest-nest midpoint distance) around the nest. Nesting success declined with riparian cover, and increased with desert shrub and agriculture (P<0.05). With large ranges and high dietary generalism these hawks are able to successfully nest atop the complex urban mosaic except when riparian cover dominates their range. Other elements of the urban landscape such as intra- and interspecific competition or localized human actions were not included in this study but may be of critical importance to individual nest success.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Optimizing a UAV survey approach: implications for monitoring ecosystem services provided by floral resources\n\nAUTHORS: Shereen Xavier, Alisa Coffin, Dawn Olson and Jason Schmidt\n\nABSTRACT: Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) equipped with multispectral sensors are increasingly being tested and deployed for collecting high resolution spatio-temporal data of agriculture and the environmental. Agricultural land is currently under review for finding ways to improve sustainability and long-term health. Studies show that habitat management to provide non-cropping areas and specifically, wildflowers to provide floral resources, such as pollen and nectar to support healthy beneficial arthropods and the ecosystem services they provide. In a previous small plot study, we counted blooms over the season, and found that plots with greater numbers of flowers supported significantly higher pollinator populations. Here we examined the potential of deploying an inexpensive UAV system as a tool to remotely estimate floral resources and corresponding pollinator populations. UAV data were collected from previously established native wildflower plots in 19 locations on University of Georgia experimental farms in Tifton, Georgia. A UAV (Solo 3Dr) equipped with a standard panchromatic camera was deployed to capture images of the wildflower plots during the months of June and September 2017, months where we observed high and low pollinator populations and high and low flower counts. Pollinator population estimates and vegetation quadrat sampling was carried out simultaneously. Images were analyzed using supervised image classification to determine the floral area within ArcGIS software. The floral area obtained from the images positively correlated with the floral counts gathered from the quadrat samples. Furthermore, UAV-derived floral area significantly predicted pollinator populations, with a positive correlation indicating that plots with greater area of blooming flowers contained higher numbers of pollinators. Our results suggest analysis of images derived from low-cost UAV systems can provide indirect estimates of pollinator populations.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Patterns in Hybridization Between Native and Invasive Species\n\nAUTHORS: Julia Needham*, Amanda Chunco – Elon University\n\nABSTRACT: Human activity is causing the rapid movement of species around the globe, both directly through human facilitated movement and indirectly as a consequence of climate change. In addition to direct harm to native species through predation and competitive exclusion, introduced species can also impact native species through hybridization. Here, we have examined hybridization events between native and invasive species to determine taxonomic, temporal, and geographic patterns in hybrid zone formation. Using Web of Science, we identified 54 cases of hybridization between native and invasive species published between 2011 and 2016. Preliminary results have identified clear taxonomic patterns, with the largest numbers of studies focusing on fishes, and geographic clustering of hybrid zones in the United States, Europe, and Japan. This work also reveals significant gaps in knowledge of invasive species and the natives that they affect. Specifically, updated spatial data are unavailable for many of the species included in our study and, alarmingly, 40% of those species, including two of the most studied invasives – the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss – were unassessed by the IUCN Red List. This work has clear implications for global impacts of invasive species through the risk of genetic introgression. This paper also uncovers gaps in hybridization research that, due to our quickly-changing landscape, must be addressed soon to ensure the success of current conservation efforts.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Predicting Invasive Species Richness with Boosted Regression Trees\n\nAUTHORS: Namaluba Malawo*, Gabriela Nunez, Songlin Fei – Purdue University\n\nABSTRACT: Invasive species have become a major problem in the US, but our understanding of invasion patterns and key drivers are still limited. Using a powerful tool in predictive biogeography, Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs), we created models which can predict exotic species distribution for the Eastern United States at a high resolution. BRTs build on binary decision trees and combine them to create a linear combination of many trees. This leads to a more accurate model of invasion prediction and allows us to better identify key underlying variables that drive the observed patterns. Ultimately, our goal was to create a model with many trees and low deviance that could accurately predict invasive plant species richness patterns for the Eastern United States. The data measures 38 different variables, including soil characteristics, biotic variables, and anthropogenic drivers. The results of our work will help us better understand drivers of invasion by quantifying the relative contribution of each variable. Additionally, the results from our studies can then be used by policy makers and practitioners to manage invasions of species with more proactive measures and preventative actions. These uses will alleviate areas in the Eastern United States from significant ecological and economic damages.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Predicting Time Since Fire from Landscape Level Variables Within the Boreal Forest of Alaska: A Spatial Tobit Modeling Approach\n\nAUTHORS: Brian D. Young*, Department of Natural Science, Landmark College, Putney, VT; Falk Hüttmann, Institute of Arctic Biology, University of Alaska Fairbanks, Fairbanks, AK\n\nABSTRACT: Wildfire is both a naturally and anthropogenically produced disturbance which plays an important role in the development of the boreal forest. The boreal forest currently experiences frequent, stand-replacing fires which typically result in stands dominated by a single cohort of a limited number of tree species which establish simultaneously after fire but, differ in their growth rates. Substantial modeling and empirical evidence suggests that wildfire within the boreal forest of western North America is likely to increase in extent and severity with climate change. Therefore, a clear understanding of the present state of the entire forested area is crucial so that future change may be assessed. The environmental factors controlling the spatial heterogeneity of time since fire are numerous and vary from one ecosystem to another and between spatial scales. Large areas of Alaska are very difficult to access therefore; there is a need for advanced approaches to mapping. Here we investigate a predictive modeling approach that uses publicly available data and environmental variables to predict the time since fire for the interior forest of Alaska.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Residential Landscape Ecology: Understanding Ecological Patterns and Processes of the Fastest Growing Land Cover Type in the U.S.\n\nAUTHORS: Basil V. Iannone III, Gisele Nighswander, Kayla Hess – School of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida\n\nABSTRACT: Residential landscapes and their associated institutional and economic land uses are the fastest growing land cover type in the United States. These anthropogenic ecosystems alter spatial patterns of biodiversity and species movement through a number of mechanisms, including habitat fragmentation and the creation of designer and engineered ecosystems, such as ornamental gardens and stormwater ponds. Furthermore, while urban and urbanizing areas tend to be ecologically homogeneous relative to one another across large spatial scales, ecological processes, particularly those occurring at smaller spatial scales, within a given urban or residential landscape can be very heterogeneous. This poster will highlight multiple investigations being conducted by the Residential Landscape Ecology Lab at the University of Florida that contribute to the long-term goal of quantifying spatial patterns and drivers of ecological processes within and surrounding residential landscapes. The aims of these projects are: (1) to mitigate the negative impacts of expanding residential landscapes and (2) to inform the design of future residential landscapes so that they exhibit greater levels of ecological functionality. Ongoing projects include quantifying how landscaping practices aimed at reducing irrigation and fertilizer needs impact hydrological connectivity, water quality, and plant communities in adjacent wetlands; determining the degree to which ornamental plantings in stormwater pond networks benefit downstream water quality; and the effects of alpha and beta diversity, structural complexity, and landscape context of ornamental gardens on top-down and bottom-up regulation of herbivorous arthropod pests. In addition, we are pursuing research aimed at quantifying the impacts of landscaping plant choices and stormwater ponds on patterns of plant invasion across multiple spatial scales and quantifying spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem services that benefit homeowners (e.g., cooling, soil fertility, and arthropod pest control) and the spatial thresholds at which these services become homogeneous.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Retaining Fire Resilience: Twenty Years of Forest Succession in Old Growth Ponderosa Pine Forest\n\nAUTHORS: Natalie C Pawlikowski*, The Pennsylvania State University, Alan H Taylor, The Pennsylvania State University, Michelle Coppoletta, U.S. Forest Service, Eric E Knapp, USFS Pacific Southwest Research Station\n\nABSTRACT: Historically, forest structure and species composition in ponderosa pine forests was maintained by frequent, low to moderate intensity, wildfire.
