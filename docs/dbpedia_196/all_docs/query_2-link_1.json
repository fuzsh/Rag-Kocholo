        "text": "American football player (1901–1963)\n\nCentury Allen \"Wally\" Milstead (January 1, 1901 – June 2, 1963) was an American professional football player in the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). He played college football at Wabash College and at Yale University, where his play earned him All-American recognition. On his way from Wabash to Yale in early 1922, he attended Syracuse University where he was the heavyweight starter for the Orangemen wrestling team.[1] Milstead went on to play with the professional Philadelphia Quakers of the AFL and the New York Giants of the NFL. He got his name for being born on the first day of the twentieth century, January 1, 1901. Milstead was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1977.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiography portal"
