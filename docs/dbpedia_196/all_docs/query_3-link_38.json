A three-sport athlete who excelled in all sports, Haklin kept up his classroom studies and graduated Summa Cum Laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. A Rhodes Scholar Finalist, Haklin earned a total of 11 letters as a Little Giant athlete. Named to the Academic All­American football team in 1972 and the Academic All-American basketball team in 1973, Haklin won virtually every athletic award possible at Wabash. He captained the football team in 1972 from his defensive back position. He still owns Wabash's single game record with four interceptions in a 13-7 win over Hanover in 1971. A steady infielder, Haklin captained the baseball team in both 1972 and 1973 and was named to the all­-conference team. In his senior season, Haklin was named MVP after Wabash had an outstanding 15-12-f record against the likes of Indiana, Butler, Ball State, and Purdue. In basketball, Haklin was not flashy, but helped teammate Jack Roudebush race to the top of the scoring records. Haklin captured the Frank Sparks Award and the Indianapolis Alumni Award for his academic and athletic exploits. He was also named the outstanding athlete for the Indiana Collegiate Conference, winning the Tony Hinkle Outstanding Athlete Award. Haklin continues to be involved in intercollegiate athletics at Kalamazoo College. As Assistant Professor of Physical Education, Haklin has single-handedly rebuilt K's basketball team. He is also the school's head golf coach. Haklin and his wife, Marilyn, have a six-year old daughter, Kathryn.\n\nBack To Hall of Fame"
