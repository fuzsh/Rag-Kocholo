However, the majority of oak ecosystems in the region have been lost to development, and the few that remain are often small and fragmented, and their health is frequently imperiled by mesophycation, invasive species, pests, and diseases. In response, several Chicago organizations drafted an oak ecosystem recovery plan that outlined strategies to restore these ecosystems across the urban landscape: from managing remnant natural areas to incorporating oaks into residential and commercial properties. This talk will briefly describe the development of the oak ecosystem recovery plan, and then outline how GIS is being used to create a landscape-scale model to inform the restoration, expansion, and re-connection of these important natural communities. A component of the recovery plan was to identify and map every remnant oak ecosystem in the Chicago Region. Now, this map layer is being used to develop a shared, regional vision for a network of publicly and privately owned lands consisting of large, high quality remnant oak ecosystems (cores), that are buffered and connected by a combination of smaller, lower quality natural areas, reclaimed ecosystems, and urban/residential plantings (buffers and corridors). This is being done with the input and cooperation of a wide variety of stake holders. Natural areas managers, county and regional planners, municipal foresters, and community outreach specialists worked together to identify which remnant ecosystems were the most important, and we then used a cost connectivity mapping tool to connect these core ecosystems. This mapping project is now being used by regional planning organizations to focus where and how they work, and to identify audiences that may otherwise not be in the conservation conversation.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: The Global Sand Crisis Through the Lens of the Telecoupling Framework\n\nAUTHORS: Aurora Torres*, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv), Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg; Jodi S. Brandt, Boise State University; Kristen Lear, University of Georgia; Jianguo Liu, Michigan State University\n\nABSTRACT: Overexploitation of global supplies of sand is damaging the environment, endangering communities, and promoting violent conflict. Although previous studies have explored human-nature interactions and generated useful insights in the context of sand mining, they are largely disintegrated. Here we apply the telecoupling framework to begin disentangling this complex and understudied issue. We combine a global perspective of the collateral effects and feedbacks of sand mining and trade across diverse systems with two study cases to better understand cross-scale dynamics and how an effective global sand governance system can be crafted. We chose two study cases of coupled human and natural systems in Asia: (1) Singapore and sand suppliers; and (2) Poyang Lake and Chinese mega-cities. Singapore is the leader of global sand imports, which has triggered geopolitical tensions and environmental degradation in the region. On the other hand, the Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and has become its largest source of sand, as a result of a sand mining ban along the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The application of the telecoupling framework suggests that the approach has the potential to help holistically understand and integrate human-nature interactions emerging from sand exploitation in fast-growing regions. Finally, we offer suggestions for operationalizing the telecoupling framework for sand supply and demand and discuss the need for an effective governance of our planet’s resources.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: History and Trends of Describing and Analyzing Landscape Patterns: Where Are We Now?\n\nAUTHORS: Amy E. Frazier*, Peter Kedron – Department of Geography, Oklahoma State University\n\nABSTRACT: Researchers have been developing metrics to quantify the characteristic patterns of land cover patches long before the discipline of landscape ecology officially coalesced as a field of study. Citing Aldo Leopold’s law of interspersion, George Patton introduced what is widely recognized to be one of the first landscape metrics to quantify edge in 1975. Since then, hundreds of metrics have been developed, providing researchers with tools to describe and analyze landscape patterns in a computationally efficient manner. As further evidence of the importance of these measures in landscape ecology, the 1988 paper by O’Neill and colleagues in which three new metrics were developed remains the top-cited article in the journal Landscape Ecology. However, despite the widespread use and importance of spatial pattern metrics, there remains a lack of agreement on the meaning of pattern and how best to measure landscape patterns from an ecological perspective. Despite the plethora of metrics available, new and ‘improved’ indices are introduced each year, and development shows few signs of abating. Complicating matters further, the ecological relevance of many landscape pattern indices has been questioned, and there is growing recognition that spatial pattern metrics may not provide any real causal understanding of underlying ecological mechanisms. This study reviews the history of landscape pattern analysis over the last three decades. We first provide a brief history of the trends and development of spatial pattern indices alongside a discussion of some of the limitations of these conventional landscape metrics for making pattern-process linkages. We then discuss some of the alternative approaches for linking spatial patterns with ecological processes to situate the current state of where we are now in terms of describing and analyzing landscape patterns and support further discussions that seek to understand where we are headed in the future.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Behavioral Landscape Ecology: A Review and Framework\n\nAUTHORS: Jayme A. Prevedello, Rio de Janeiro State University; Victoria J. Bennett, Texas Christian University; Patrick A. Zollner*, Purdue University; Marcus V. Vieira, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro\n\nABSTRACT: Over two decades ago, Behavioral Landscape Ecology (BLE) emerged as a coalition between Behavioral Ecology and Landscape Ecology, especially after the publication of Lima & Zollner’s (1996; Trends Ecol. Evol. 11: 131-135) perspective paper. Based on 549 studies citing this paper, we review how Behavioral Landscape Ecology (BLE) has developed over this time, and propose a unifying framework to guide further development. The majority of papers were empirical (58%), although simulation (or modelling; 28%) and reviews (14%) were also common. About half (52%) of the papers were published in Ecology journals, with many of the remaining papers published in Zoology (14%), Conservation (11%) and Behavior (9%) journals. Mammals (36%), birds (29%) and invertebrates (20%) were the most studied taxonomic groups. Finally, behavioral studies predominantly focused on movement (42%), habitat selection (22%) and foraging (16%), whereas landscape issues addressed focused upon connectivity (23%), landscape composition (10%) and configuration (9%). Based on this review, we propose a conceptual framework portraying BLE as a distinct discipline, emerging from the combination of landscape and behavioral approaches to study ecological phenomena. The landscape approach comprises two main themes, landscape composition (including habitat quantity, matrix quality and edge permeability) and landscape configuration (including habitat fragmentation and presence of corridors). The behavioral approach also comprises two themes: movement (including dispersal and routine movements) and habitat selection (including foraging, conspecific attraction and anti-predatory behavior). When combined, these approaches lead to two emergent themes, inter-patch movement (including perceptual range, gap crossing and corridors use) and landscape-level habitat selection (including habitat patch, matrix , and edge use), which form the core of BLE. Over only two decades, BLE has brought essential insights to ecology and conservation, and we hope our review and framework stimulate continued advances.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-05: Recent History of South Platte River Riparian Ecosystem and Channel Change\n\nAUTHORS: Jessica Salo*, University of Northern Colorado; Gabrielle Katz, Metropolitan State University of Denver\n\nABSTRACT: Water management has substantially altered the hydrology of the South Platte River in Colorado over the past 150 years. Although the river experiences substantial natural inter-annual flow variability, the altered annual flow regime is characterized by enhanced seasonal consistency of surface and ground water levels. Today, the river supports a broad cottonwood-willow riparian forest that established from 1900-1930, in a pulse of channel narrowing that accompanied historic flow alterations. The status of this forest in not well understood and little is known about its historic spatio-temporal pattern. We investigated recent changes to by developing and testing methods to assess riparian land cover change and channel movement on the South Platte River downstream of Greeley, Colorado. We digitized floodplain land cover on orthophotos taken at roughly 10 year intervals for three 30 km river segments in Weld, Morgan and Logan Counties, Colorado. Preliminary results indicate there is variability in land cover between the three reaches and major changes have occurred between 2006 and 2015. In all three segments, the major land cover types for both time periods included agricultural land use, riparian forests, and riparian herbaceous vegetation. Notable changes are present from 2006 to 2015. Specifically, active channel area increased 10-110% between 2006 and 2015, a period that included high flows and major flooding in 2013. In the two upstream segments, this change was accompanied by loss of dense forest and increase in open forest area. In the downstream segment, open forest area decreased while riparian herbaceous cover increased during this interval. This project is the first step to understanding historic rates and patterns of South Platte River riparian land cover dynamics to provide important context for informing management of this critical natural resource.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nLAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE: Identifying Drivers Behind Deforestation in Guarayos Indigenous Territory, Eastern Bolivia from 1997 to 2017\n\nAUTHORS: Yifan He*, School of Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan; Juan Pablo Baldiviezo, The Bolivian Forestry Research Institute (Instituto Boliviano de Investigación Forestal); Arun Agrawal, Ivette Perfecto – School of Environment and Sustainability, University of Michigan\n\nABSTRACT: While maintaining a socialist, pro-indigenous, and pro-nature image, the government of Evo Morales of Bolivia finds itself embracing export-oriented agriculture and extractivism as the country integrates into the global economy. This dual political discourse has profound impacts on Guarayos, an indigenous community located in eastern Bolivia that relies on their tropical dry forests as the main source of livelihood. In this study, I explore how the economic and social policies of Bolivia, prompted by the global demand for agricultural commodities, shape the forest and agriculture landscapes and the livelihood of the indigenous community in Guarayos. Spatial analysis of forest cover changes over the past 20 years based on remote sensing data shows how land tenure change, and the expansion of mechanized agriculture and cattle ranch contribute to forest loss in Guarayos. Semi-structured interviews with 25 community, business, and government stakeholders indicate that not only is there a lack of support for the forest sector, the central government is actively weakening the structure and governance capacity of indigenous institutions, which further hurt their forest management.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n10:00am CDT\n\nTERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS: Croplands Are Nibbling Away at Prairie Pothole Wetlands\n\nAUTHORS: Carol A. Johnston*, South Dakota State University; Nancy E. McIntyre, Texas Tech University\n\nABSTRACT: Agricultural expansion is a documented source of wetland area loss in the Dakota Prairie Pothole Region (DPPR), which could potentially affect the distribution of wetlands in the landscape and their accessibility to fauna with limited mobility. Using an existing map of DPPR wetland losses derived from the 2001 USGS National Land Cover Dataset and the 2011 USDA Cropland Data Layer, we analyzed the number, size, and connectivity among prairie pothole wetlands, comparing sampled quadrangles having a priori-defined high and low wetland loss rates. Connectivity was assessed using a suite of graph theoretic metrics. We expected that wetland density (i.e., the number of wetland patches per unit land area) would decrease with wetland areal loss and that the network’s coalescence distance would increase as wetlands became more sparse and separated from each other, which would be reflected in changes in metrics that quantify degree of linkages among wetlands and overall network connectedness. We found that average area per wetland decreased in quadrangles with high areal losses of wetlands (12 to 38% loss of wetland area between 2001 and 2011), but that wetland density and wetland connectivity did not change significantly in high or low loss quadrangles. Areal losses rarely resulted in total wetland elimination, instead subdividing and “nibbling away” at the edges of wetlands. This spatial pattern of wetland loss may reduce the impacts to organisms that must traverse the landscape from patch to patch, but may be more difficult to detect because it is so diffuse.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:00am - 10:15am CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Twenty Years of Changes in Floral Resources Across Urban and Rural Midwestern North America\n\nAUTHORS: Greg Spyreas*, David N. Zaya – Illinois Natural History Survey\n\nABSTRACT: Multiple lines of evidence suggest a rapid decline in populations of several pollinator taxa. Their declines have increasingly become a focus for conservation research. One of the largest gaps in knowledge is how floral resources for pollinators have changed through time, and how trends in those resources vary in different landscapes or habitat types. We compared long-term plant community data from the Chicago region, to the rest of Illinois, to measure differences in their floral resources. Data were drawn from 20 years of the Critical Trends Assessment Program (CTAP), which surveys randomly selected sites across Illinois. We considered both quantity and diversity of floral resources available. We found that changes in overall floral resources were largely driven by two factors, habitat loss/conversion, and within-site changes in the abundance of key plant species. The relative role of those two factors differed between the Chicago area and more rural regions. Our dataset is a unique, large-scale estimate of floral resources, which we use to quantify important patterns and trends in them across regions. Understanding these resource trends and spatial patterns will aid conservation of the pollinators that depend on them.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Balancing Built and Natural Infrastructure for Sustainable Freshwater Supply to the World’s Cities\n\nAUTHORS: Min Gon Chung*, Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University; Kenneth A. Frank, Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Michigan State University; Jianguo Liu, Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University\n\nABSTRACT: Across the world, humans are increasingly moving from the countryside to cities. This resultant rapid urbanization concentrates the demand of freshwater ecosystem services. In particular, the increased urban population demands more services from not only surrounding watersheds but also distant watersheds through the construction of infrastructure (e.g., dams). However, maintaining benefits to humans with built infrastructure while conserving healthy freshwater ecosystems is a complex challenge. A new strategy is needed to combine built infrastructure with natural infrastructure (e.g., wetland restoration). This study examines the roles of built and natural infrastructure in source watersheds for freshwater supply to urban areas using the ego-centric network analysis. Our results indicate that natural infrastructure plays an important role in sustaining freshwater supply to urban areas while built infrastructure focuses on freshwater supply in source watersheds. The results will have important implications for global urban sustainability in the telecoupled Anthropocene.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: Satellite-based Accounting of Forest Area and Fragmentation\n\nAUTHORS: Peter Vogt, European Commission, Joint Research Centre\n\nABSTRACT: National reporting on forest land cover is often derived from forest inventory plot data and summarized in statistical indices and tabular figures. Yet, this kind of reporting scheme is subject to the intrinsic limitations of any summary index, which is the lack of spatial information on the arrangement and configuration of forest cover. As a direct consequence, these indices may be of limited use for landscape planning or risk assessment studies, where the detection of hotspots and the information of spatial heterogeneity is an essential prerequisite. The solution to this problem is to provide map products with comprehensive measures of the spatial patterns of forest cover and the degree of forest fragmentation. This study illustrates a methodology for a satellite-based accounting scheme providing information on forest area, forest spatial patterns and the degree of forest fragmentation. Geographic maps showing the location and area coverage of forest patches and their degree of fragmentation (intact, interior, dominant, transitional, patchy and rare forest) provide a concise spatial summary on the state of forest. The proposed analysis scheme is based on geometric principles only and can be applied to any kind of forest raster maps, independent of the spatial resolution or the definition of forest. The methodology is available in the free software GuidosToolbox (http://forest.jrc.ec.europa.eu/download/software/guidos) and illustrated for European Union Member States using the most recent 20m-resolution Copernicus 2015 forest map.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Insights from Estimating Home Ranges Using Different Currencies and Incorporating How Animals Perceive Their Environments\n\nAUTHORS: Roger A. Powell, North Carolina State University; Aaron N. Facka, Oregon State University; Lynn L. Rogers, Wildlife Research Institute; Susan A. Mansfield, Wildlife Research Institute\n\nABSTRACT: Most researchers estimate home ranges using telemetry location estimates. With an appropriate estimator, this approach produces a utilization distribution that can be considered to approximate a probability distribution of where an animal spends its time. Essentially all home ranges estimated today use time as their currency. Estimating home ranges using other currencies, such as energy expenditure and importance of resources, provides insights into why animals use space as they do. Weighting each telemetry location by rate of energy expenditure at that time, estimated from travel speed using an equation in the literature, produces a new utilization distribution. For some animals, energy expenditure in their home range cores is higher, and in the home range peripheries lower, than time spent in those areas. Home range estimators have parameters that must be chosen to be appropriate to the biology of study animals and research technology. Choosing those parameters based on perceptual distances for sight, sound, smell and memory produce different utilization distribution yet, explaining different aspects of why animals use space as they do. I present data for fishers (Pekania pennanti) and black bears (Ursus americanus) to illustrate and to compare how using different currencies and perceptual distances affect utilization distributions, home range overlap, and home range cores. Techniques appropriate to the questions or specific hypotheses are needed to understand animal behavior and the potential for successful management.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-05: Spatial Patterns of Riparian and Geomorphic Disturbance Following Catastrophic Record Flooding on the Blanco River, Texas, USA\n\nAUTHORS: Kimberly M. Meitzen*, John Phillips, Aspen Manning – Texas State University; Thais Perkins, TreeFolks\n\nABSTRACT: The Blanco River, which flows through the limestone Balcones Canyonlands of central Texas (USA), experienced catastrophic flooding in May 2015 that resulted in significant bio-geomorphic disturbance to its riparian corridor. High-resolution aerial and satellite imagery from pre- and post-flooding for a 55 km reach of river were used to map and categorize patterns of disturbance by degree of severity ranging from complete floodplain stripping to no disturbance. A two-part schema was used to classify disturbance relative to both riparian and geomorphic factors. Total disturbance are was quantified for FEMA floodplain boundary areas including the floodway, 100-, and 500-year floodplains. The most severe disturbance occurred within the floodway near the channel and decreased with lateral distance into the 100-year and 500-year floodplains, and beyond the 500-year floodplain. Disturbance patterns previously identified in the literature including meander scour, parallel chute scour, convex bank erosion, and macro-turbulent scour were all present following this event, as well as substantial disturbance proximal to tributary confluences. In the aftermath of this event, TreeFolks, a local non-profit organization, engaged with the community to actively replant and restore the riparian corridor of the Blanco River on both public and private lands. These reforestation efforts supplement the natural passive recovery of the riparian corridor, enabling the system to recover more quickly and be resilient to future flood events.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nLAND USE/LAND COVER CHANGE: Land use and cover change within a typical Midwest watershed in relation to socio-ecological factors\n\nAUTHORS: Connor Crank, Jiquan Chen, Ranjeet John - Michigan State University, Department of Geography\n\nABSTRACT: Land use and cover change (LUCC) are caused by joint forces of physical changes and human activities, and have consequent roles in ecosystem and societal functions. Using a typical landscape of the Midwest region, the Kalamazoo Watershed in southern Michigan (2,200 km2), we quantified LUCC from 1976 to 2015 and examined the causes and consequences from socio-ecological perspectives, including variables of population, climate, and ecosystem function. We quantified the spatiotemporal changes in seven major cover types (i.e., barren, built-up, cropland, forest, grassland, water, and wetland) at five-year intervals based on classified images of Landsat MMS and Landsat TM using an object-oriented classification system (86.4% accuracy). Using historical records of temperature, precipitation, and net primary production, we aim to further explore the connections between LUCC and long-term changes in social and physical properties.\n\nUrban/built-up area increased from 3.5% in 1976 to 14% in 2015. While cropland dominated the landscape during the 40-year study period, it showed the greatest degree of overall change, declining from 60% to 48%. Amount of forest cover decreased by 5%, while the water and wetland increased by 1% and 5%, respectively. During this period, population increased by ~73%. The built-up and wetland cover types showed strong positive correlations with population growth (R=0.95 and 0.86, respectively), while cropland and forest land were negatively correlated with population growth (R=-0.94, -0.87, respectively). Temperature and precipitation showed no significant relationships with the growth or decline of land use/cover types. Using a novel MODIS-to-LANDSAT downscaling method, we will quantify net primary production of each cover type for every 5-year period to examine how long-term changes in LUCC affected ecosystem function within the watershed.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nTERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS: Mallard Distribution and Wetland Network Modularity in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR)\n\nAUTHORS: Jessica Gorzo*, Chris Wright – Natural Resources Research Institute\n\nABSTRACT: Distance thresholds define habitat connectivity for waterfowl, which vary during the stages of their annual cycle. During the breeding season, many species of waterfowl in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of the U.S. require a complex of wetlands within their home range for nesting, foraging and brood rearing. Ideal spatial configuration and requisite distances between wetlands within the breeding site are largely unknown, yet likely drive larger-scale patterns of waterfowl distribution. Mallard (Anas platyrhyncos), the most common species in the PPR, are driven to settle breeding sites by conspecific attraction. Suitable habitat changes inter-annually with the spatially dynamic wetland conditions in the PPR. We aimed to test if annual mallard “hot spots” correlated with modularity of wetland networks at various spatial scales, and if correlations between hotspots and wetland network metrics varied according to inter-annual weather conditions. We used the Global Surface Water Layer (GSWL) to identify and map wetlands in the PPR, generated by the European Union via remote sensing imagery of 30-m resolution. The raster dataset spans 1984-2015, which includes high variability from severe drought through wet years in the PPR. We built upon the work of Janke (et al. 2017), who performed a hot-spot analysis annually during the study period from the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS). We investigated the relationship between mallard hot/cold spots (measured via a Z-Score from the Gi* test, spdep package in R) and characteristics of wetland network modules at 1km, 5km and 10km scales using regression trees and random forests. We found that network characteristics better predicted mallard Z-Scores than raw measures of wetland number or density within the vicinity of the survey segment. The most influential scale of wetland network modules varied with weather conditions, and thus characteristics of the networks local to each segment in a given year.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n10:15am CDT\n\nPEOPLE AND LANDSCAPES: Place-based Characteristics Defining Trajectories of Rural Forest-based Communities\n\nAUTHORS: Anita T. Morzillo*, University of Connecticut; Mindy S. Crandall, University of Maine; Kathleen P. Bell, University of Maine; Darla K. Munroe, Ohio State University; Chris R. Colocousis, James Madison University\n\nABSTRACT: The decline of traditional natural resource-based industries introduces challenges and opportunities for rural communities. Collectively, the future trajectories of these communities have enormous consequences for forested landscapes and the myriad ecosystem services they provide. We examined recent community trajectories in terms of reliance on new manufacturing or new amenity-based industries or continued reliance on traditional industries to glean insights about similarities and differences across communities, document patterns in community responses to landscape shocks, and assess linkages between local- and regional-scale landscape shocks. We focused on 8,650 communities positioned within forested regions that are neither within unpopulated wilderness nor suburban or urban areas. In 2010, these areas included 27% of the continental US, less than 5% of the US population, and an average of 60% forest cover. Using diverse data describing the place-based characteristics of these communities and their surrounding landscapes, we established groupings of communities using cluster analysis and tested these groupings against established potential trajectories, including: production-shock-economic decline; production-shock-amenity based; or production-shock- reinvented production. Our results show strong patterns across communities, and that place-based characteristics influence how communities adapt to changes like decline in natural resources employment. These findings improve understanding of community and landscape change, and reveal challenges and opportunities for maintaining forested landscapes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 10:15am - 10:30am CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n11:45am CDT\n\n12:00pm CDT\n\n12:00pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:30pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-07: Hands-on Methods for Teaching Landscape Form and Processes\n\nAUTHORS: Garrett C.

Meentemeyer – Center for Geospatial Analytics, North Carolina State University\n\nABSTRACT: Education curricula are more frequently incorporating spatial thinking techniques to improve students’ problem-solving skills. However, students may still struggle to visualize complex landscape processes, such as object shapes, surface gradients, relative locations, and their changes through time. To help students better explore, model, visualize, and think about complex landscape processes, we developed an interactive, open-source method for teaching landscape form and processes using Tangible Landscape, a tangible interface for geospatial modeling. We will demo multiple hands-on tangible teaching lessons focused on concepts of waterflow, landform development, and grading. Participants will engage in learning how tangible interaction methods for teaching are developed and how they can be implemented and assessed. Results from previous experimental implementation will also be shared, highlighting student ratings of their user experience, including acquisition of spatial thinking skills such as reading and interpreting topography. The presentation will conclude with audience discussion of tangible interfaces’ ability to teach spatial constructs, psychometric properties of examining tangible (3D) teaching methods, and educational opportunities for the field of Landscape Ecology.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 1:45pm - 2:00pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\nINSECT & DISEASE OUTBREAKS: Temporal Variation in Spatial Genetic Structure During Population Outbreaks: Distinguishing Among Different Potential Drivers of Spatial Synchrony\n\nAUTHORS: Jeremy Larroque, Département de Sciences Biologiques, Université de Montréal; Simon Legault, Département de Sciences Biologiques, Université de Montréal; Rob Johns, Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada; Lisa Lumley, Royal Alberta Museum; Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada; Michel Cusson, Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Forest Service, Laurentian Forestry Centre; Patrick M. A. James, Département de Sciences Biologiques, Université de Montréal\n\nABSTRACT: High periodic variations in population size are common across natural populations. In some cases, preventive management strategies could reduce economic losses associated with population outbreaks, requiring a clear understanding of the spatial population dynamics of irruptive species. However, factors governing their spatial dynamics are still not fully understood. It is generally considered that dispersal (“epicenter hypothesis”) and spatial correlation in environmental stochasticity (“oscillatory hypothesis” or Moran effect) can synchronize populations over wide areas. Our objective was to identify the relative support of these two mechanisms in the outbreaks of an economically important irruptive forest insect, the spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) in the province of Quebec (Canada). AMOVA, cluster analysis, isolation by distance and sPCA were used to characterize spatial and temporal genomic variation using 1370 SBW larvae sampled over four years (2012-2015) and genotyped at more than 190,000 SNP loci. We found evidence of weak spatial genetic structure at the scale of Quebec. The little structure that did exist decreased between 2012 and 2015. We also found genetic evidence of a long-distance dispersal event over > 140 km. Results thus suggest that dispersal is the key mechanism involved in driving population synchrony at this stage of the outbreak. Early intervention management strategies that aim to control source populations have the potential to be effective through limiting dispersal. However, the timing of such interventions relative to the outbreak cycles and local dynamics will greatly influence their probability of success.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 1:45pm - 2:00pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n1:45pm CDT\n\nURBAN/EXURBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY: Parcelization in the Exurbs: A Case Study in Butler County (OH) from 2004 to 2014\n\nAUTHORS: Christine Daley*, Amelie Davis – Miami University\n\nABSTRACT: Urban growth at the urban-rural fringe, i.e. exurbanization, has become a dominant residential land use in the last several decades. This type of growth is thought to have deleterious environmental implications especially in terms of landscape fragmentation and loss of farmland. In order to better understand these effects, we examine the process of parcelization in Butler County, OH which sits between two regions undergoing rural sprawl (Dayton, OH and Cincinnati, OH). Using Butler County, Ohio parcel data from 2004 and 2014, we examine which parcels have been subdivided in the past decade, i.e. the process of parcelization. We then look at a) the size distribution of the new parcels, and b) their spatial distribution relative to their size and distance from urban centers. Next, we evaluate the land cover changes associated with this changing land use, using a 6 class, 1-meter spatial resolution land cover data. All these data are then input into a clustering algorithm to assess patterns in parcelization, size, and land cover change.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 1:45pm - 2:00pm CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Processes Controlling the Pattern of Presettlement Vegetation in the Landscape of the Southern Tip of Lake Michigan\n\nAUTHORS: Noel Pavlovic*, U.S. Geological Survey; Marlin Bowles, The Morton Arboretum; Samniqueka J. Halsey, University of Illinois; Jennifer McBride, The Morton Arboretum\n\nABSTRACT: Understanding how landscape processes shaped North American vegetation prior to European settlement is critical for restoring biological diversity and understanding how shifting climate will alter biome transitions. Climate, soil characteristics, and fire are thought to have shaped local and regional vegetation pattern and oak dominance in the Prairie Peninsula. Quantitative geographical analysis of 1830’s Government Land Office (GLO) Public Land Survey data along the south coast of Lake Michigan, from southeast Wisconsin to southwest Michigan, has been limited due to the lack of analytical datasets.GLO vegetation pattern and structure was compared against a fire model, in which we expected a non-random vegetation pattern, with regional oak dominance and a greater abundance of shade-tolerant fire-intolerant woody vegetation associated with landscape fire breaks. Tree cover and composition were compared among physiographic regions and in relation to gradients in soil types, precipitation, evapo-transpiration, fire proxies, and soil moisture.The landscape was dominated by prairie in the southwest, with increasing tree cover to the north and east. Greater extent of tree cover, as well as forest tree density (> 100 trees/ha), occurred on the lee side of major water courses. Savanna (< 50 trees/ha) tended to be less restricted and became dominant along the northern and eastern Prairie Peninsula border. Oaks dominated all woody vegetation, with greater sub-dominance of maple-basswood-ash vegetation at higher tree densities. Correlates of individual tree distribution included distance from water courses, slope and elevation. High abundance of barrens in the eastern portions of Indiana are notable. These results support regional models of fire-caused and soil moisture-controlled local vegetation patterns, and the need for incorporating fire into management planning as well as recognizing fire as a factor in climate change modeling. We will discuss these transitions in relation to fire breaks, climatic gradients, and conservation.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Understanding Local Land Use Changes in the Context of Global Trade Telecoupling\n\nAUTHORS: Yue Dou *, Anna Herzberger, Ciara Hovis – Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University; Wenbin Wu, Key Laboratory of Agri-Informatics, Ministry of Agriculture/Institute of Agricultural Resources and Regional Planning, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Jianguo Liu, Center for Systems Integration and Sustainability, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Michigan State University\n\nABSTRACT: Agriculture is one of the main forces driving land use changes that result in profound global environmental and socio-economic consequences. There is a growing understanding of the complex drivers and mechanisms affecting farmers’ land use behaviors, which is important for efficient implementation of policies promoting environmental regulations, climate adaptation, and poverty alleviation. However, these studies are often conducted in a local context, overlooking an important driver of farmers’ land use decisions, namely global agricultural trade. With the growing magnitude, frequency, and intensity of agricultural trade, its impact on farmers’ local activities must be understood. This research investigates how farmers’ behaviors (e.g., crop choice, farm consolidation, and agrichemical utilization) in the receiving system (i.e., Heilongjiang province, China) are affected by the telecoupled soybean trade. Flows of information (e.g., the price of soybean in the receiving system and farmers’ perception and knowledge of international trade) are used in this analysis. Preliminary results from our survey in 2016 show that despite the drastic soybean price change in the past decade, less than half of the households (out of 942) were aware of the soybean import, among which less than 10% knew of Brazil (the top soybean importer to China) exporting soybeans to China. Generally, fewer farmers tended to cultivate soybeans and more farmers cultivate corn and rice recently than before. However, farmers who were aware of the telecoupling had a higher probability of converting soybean land to other crops. The findings from this research may be used to inform policymakers and other relevant stakeholders, to achieve sustainable land use locally in a global context.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: Imaging of Habitats in Cancer: Life at the Edge\n\nAUTHORS: Robert Gillies, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute\n\nABSTRACT: Cells in solid tumors are heterogeneous in mutational load, gene expression, and phenotype. This heterogeneity is a key driver in the emergence of resistance to therapy. Evolutionary dynamical models predict that microenvironment differences in acid-base balance and oxygen levels drive somatic evolution and genetic heterogeneity. Importantly, tools exist that can quantitatively image solid tumors and map the extent and types of microenvironments (“habitats”). An emerging analytical tool uses multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to identify and classify physiologically distinct habitats in solid tumors. In general, these approaches require the co-registration of images acquired from different pulse sequences that interrogate different physiological parameters, such as blood flow, cell packing density, infrastructural organization, etc.. Overlaying these data sets creates “hyper-voxels” that contain specific combinations of normalized data from multiple inputs. Clustering algorithms identify hyper-voxels with similar features, and these are used to generate spatial maps of similar clusters. Notably, this procedure yields clusters that are spatially distinct, leading us to see them as “habitats”. An example is the combination of Apparent Diffusion coefficient (ADC), related to tissue density, with post-pre contrast T1 images, related to tumor blood flow. By combining these, four different habitats are observable with high or low cellularity and/or flow, respectively. In animal models of cancers, these imaged habitats can be co-registered with microscopic analyses to identify the underling physiologic properties of the individual cancer cells and their environment. The cores of tumors and their invasive edges differ in cell composition and protein expression patterns. The magnitude of these differences are prognostic. Larger differences portend poorer outcomes. One protein of interest is carbonic anhydrase 9, CA-IX. It may acidify the local extracellular microenvironment and promote invasion into the surrounding stroma. Therapies to reduce tumor acidity reduce this invasion, and can lead to improved tumor control.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Forecasting the Effects of Human Disturbance on Golden Eagles: Tolerance Cannot Mitigate Negative Effects of Increased Recreation on Wild Lands\n\nAUTHORS: Benjamin P. Pauli, Saint Mary's University of Minnesota; Robert J. Spaul, Boise State University; Julie A. Heath, Boise State University\n\nABSTRACT: There is widespread evidence that human disturbance affects wildlife behavior, but long-term population effects can be difficult to quantify. Individual-based models (IBMs) offer a way to assess population-level, aggregate effects of disturbance on wildlife. We created Tolerance in Raptors and the Associated Impacts of Leisure Sports (TRAILS), an IBM that simulates interactions between recreationists and nesting raptors, to assess the effect of human disturbance on raptor populations and test if changes in tolerance to disturbance could mitigate negative consequences. We used behavioral and demographic data from golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and recreation activity data to parameterize TRAILS and simulate the effects of pedestrian and off-highway vehicle (OHV) recreation on the likelihood of territory occupancy, egg-laying and nest survival of eagles over 100 years. We modeled eagle populations in the absence of recreation, with stationary 2014 levels of recreation, and with annual increases in recreation. Furthermore, we simulated eagles that developed tolerance to disturbance randomly, through natural selection, natal-habitat imprinting, or habituation. In the presence of recreation, simulated eagle populations had significantly lower and more variable growth rates, population sizes and territory occupancy. Annual increases in recreation of 1–2% greatly exacerbated population declines. Though both habituation and natural selection lead to more tolerant eagle populations, neither buffered eagle populations from detrimental effects of recreation. These results suggest that long-lived species that experience encroachment from human activities may not adapt to human disturbance at a rate that compensates for changes in disturbance. This project illustrates the usefulness of IBMs for evaluating non-lethal threats, forecasting population changes and testing theoretical feedbacks in system processes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-06: Area Accumulation Curves Can Improve Participatory Mapping\n\nAUTHORS: Jennifer C. Selgrath, Sarah Gergel – University of British Columbia\n\nABSTRACT: Participatory mapping provides a unique opportunity to document the influence of humans on species and ecosystems, and the variability of human activities over space and time. This method is particularly valuable in data-poor systems. Methods for participatory mapping can involve individual interviews or group interviews, with distinct benefits for both methods. For example, individual interviews have greater potential to identify sensitive information such as illegal practices. For individual interviews however, there has not been a systematic method for identifying the number of respondents that are necessary to accurately map the extent of human activities. Here we discuss the importance of random sampling and present a technique for identifying sufficient sample sizes. We introduce area accumulation curves – adapted from species accumulation curves – to identify sufficient number of respondents. Using an example from a heavily fished ecosystem in the central Philippines, we identified that 125 fishers were necessary to map the spatial extent of fishing practices. Such maps of resource use patterns can provide context for current ecosystem conditions and can be used to develop informed guidelines for management and conservation.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-07: Interactive Videos Enhance Learning About Socio-Ecological Systems\n\nAUTHORS: Erica Smithwick *, Stephanie Edel-Malizia, Alex Klippel – The Pennsylvania State University\n\nABSTRACT: We assessed two forms of interactive video in an online course focused on landscape conservation. We hypothesized that interactive video enhances student perceptions about learning and improves mental models of socio-ecological systems. Results showed that students reported greater learning and attitudes toward the subject following interactive video. Moreover, metrics of network complexity applied to students’ concept maps of socio-ecological systems increased longitudinally through the course highlighting greater awareness of socio-ecological linkages. We conclude that interactive video can increase awareness of interdisciplinary connections in socio-ecological systems. Using a live demonstration of interactive video as part of an online course in global sustainability, we explore how immersive experience can aid pedagogy around environmental systems thinking and discuss challenges with its integration in an educational setting.The content of the course, global parks and sustainability, allows for further advancements of its pedagogy to include immersive learning approaches that facilitate place-based, experiential learning. Ultimately these approach will allow for a discovery-based approach that stresses the local immediacy of socio-ecological systems and engages students in discovery and decision making. The technological basis for such an approach exist in both online and residential settings and will transform education in ecology/earth sciences within this decade.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nINSECT & DISEASE OUTBREAKS: Integrating Moth Flight Biophysics with Independent Validation Data to Model Atmospheric Dispersal of the Eastern Spruce Budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana)\n\nAUTHORS: Brian R.

Achtemeier – USDA Forest Service; Johanne Delisle, Marc Rhainds, Rémi Saint-Amant – Natural Resources Canada\n\nABSTRACT: The spatiotemporal dynamics of eastern spruce budworm outbreaks in North American boreal and sub-boreal forests may be sensitive to long-distance dispersal patterns that are assisted by meteorological processes. We provide an overview of temperature-constrained functional relationships between insect mass, wing area, and wingbeat frequencies, and employ these relationships to simulate realistic flight altitude distributions. An agent-based model of budworm flight, conditioned on mesoscale numerical weather simulations of temperature and wind fields, produces vertical flight density distributions that arise in combination with atmospheric boundary layer thermal profiles. We confronted our simulated moth density distributions with observed vertical profiles of moth density inferred from weather surveillance radar during budworm 2013 and 2017 outbreak events across the Gulf of St. Lawrence River in southeastern Canada. These data were used to iteratively refine the most uncertain flight parameters. Consequent dispersal patterns from broader-scaled budworm flight simulations were consistent with observations of long-distance migration events at sites in southern Quebec and New Brunswick (Canada) and in northern Maine (USA). We were able to validate outbreak source populations using a distinct indicator in differential loadings of parasitic mites. The biologically-based and meteorologically-conditioned budworm flight model holds promise as an operational tool for assessing budworm outbreak events, with the potential to inform both land management agencies and a concerned public as the eastern North American outbreak shifts into more human-dominated regions of the southeastern boreal and Acadian forests.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n2:00pm CDT\n\nURBAN/EXURBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY: Quantifying the Influences of Various Ecological Factors on Land Surface Temperature of Urban Forests\n\nAUTHORS: Yin Ren*, Key Laboratory of Urban Environment and Health, Key Laboratory of Urban Metabolism of Xiamen, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nABSTRACT: Identifying factors that influence the land surface temperature (LST) of urban forests can help improve simulations and predictions of spatial patterns of urban cool islands. This requires a quantitative analytical method that combines spatial statistical analysis with multi-source observational data. The purpose of this study was to reveal how human activities and ecological factors jointly influence LST in clustering regions (hot or cool spots) of urban forests. Using Xiamen City, China from 1996 to 2006 as a case study, we explored the interactions between human activities and ecological factors, as well as their influences on urban forest LST. Population density was selected as a proxy for human activity. We integrated multi-source data (forest inventory, digital elevation models (DEM), population, and remote sensing imagery) to develop a database on a unified urban scale. The driving mechanism of urban forest LST was revealed through a combination of multi-source spatial data and spatial statistical analysis of clustering regions. The results showed that the main factors contributing to urban forest LST were dominant tree species and elevation. The interactions between human activity and specific ecological factors linearly or nonlinearly increased LST in urban forests. Strong interactions between elevation and dominant species were generally observed and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots areas in different years. In conclusion, quantitative studies based on spatial statistics and GeogDetector models should be conducted in urban areas to reveal interactions between human activities, ecological factors, and LST.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:00pm - 2:15pm CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Historical Extirpations in Chicago Area Wetlands and Water Bodies\n\nAUTHORS: Roy Plotnick, Anthony Bellagamba, Stephanie Chancellor, Alister Cunje, Emily Dodd, Kerri Gefeke, Shannon Hsieh, M. Joseph Pasterski, Alec Schassburger, Alexis Smith, Wesley Tucker – University of Illinois at Chicago\n\nABSTRACT: Prior to European settlement, wetlands, lakes, and streams were the major topographic feature of the Chicago region. Much of this have been altered or lost in the past one-hundred-and-fifty years. In 1848 a canal was dug across the portage between the Great Lakes and Mississippi basins and in 1900 the Chicago River was reversed to connect it to the Mississippi drainage. We have examined the changes in wetland, riparian, and lacustrine environments and fauna in Cook County since the time of the river reversal, using 1890-1910 and 1997-2017 as our focus intervals. Historical topographic maps were imported into a GIS database and locations and extents of lakes, ponds, swamps, marshes and river features were digitized. These were compared with the modern USGS National Hydrography Dataset. Overall, the total area of wetlands and water bodies has decreased by about a third, while swamps and marshes have been drained or converted into lakes or rivers. Historical and modern spatial data on animals considered obligate on wetlands, lakes, and rivers were collected from digitized museum collections, in particular that of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, and various natural history surveys of the region. Target groups included mammals, birds, mollusks, fish, amphibians, and reptiles. We included invasive and reintroduced species. Beavers have been reintroduced after extirpation in the 1850’s. Of 55 fish species in the historic data, 24 are no longer present; about 50% of the remaining species have undergone range reductions. Fifty-three of 78 historic molluscan species are not recently recorded, however there are 26 current species not recorded in the historical data, including 6 considered invasive. Three out of 10 species of reptiles have disappeared. Among the birds, of 122 species detected in the 1890-1910 period, 13 were extirpated from Cook County or are extinct.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-02: Regional Impacts of Wet Periods in a Telecoupling Framework\n\nAUTHORS: MD Petrie, Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University; DPC Peters, ND Burruss – USDA Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces NM; W Ji, NP Hanan – Department of Plant & Environmental Sciences, New Mexico State University; H Savoy, USDA- Agricultural Research Service, Jornada Experimental Range, Las Cruces NM\n\nABSTRACT: Telecoupling in aridlands is influenced by environmental and ecological conditions associated with the Land Surface Template (LST) and precipitation patterns, such that variation in telecoupling may be shaped by multiple factors. For example, extreme drought events in the American southwest influences vegetation over large regions, and overwhelms the effects of many LST factors. Multi-year wet periods that can restore services provided by managed rangelands have received less attention. In the northern Chihuahuan Desert, rainfall events are stochastic and single high rainfall years are localized, suggesting that widespread positive telecoupling is improbable. Yet, multi-year wet periods may homogenize stochastic rainfall patterns through time and across space, interact with favorable local LST conditions, and in this way promote positive telecoupling that is not possible in single years.Using remote sensing data from 1983-present and a suite of harmonized LST datasets, we sought to quantify telecoupling during multi-year wet periods in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, and to discern how landscape coupling was influenced by patterns in LST and regional forcing events. We hypothesized that high precipitation would aggregate through time, and that the magnitude and duration of the forcing event would dictate its regional extent. We also hypothesized that the pattern and persistence of telecoupling would be best predicted by specific LST factors including soil type and prior-year vegetation NDVI. That is, telecoupling in this region is instigated by the aggregation of high precipitation, but its pattern within the rainfall area is contingent on local factors. Wet periods are changing, and it is clear that they will play an important role in shaping the future quality of managed rangelands. By identifying and quantifying telecoupling during wet periods, we develop new insight on how climate and landscapes interact, and define the specific conditions that support the sustainability of ecosystem services in aridlands.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 5 (7th Floor)\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-03: Assessing the Performance of Different Sampling Schedules in Capturing the Temporal Complexity of Soundscapes\n\nAUTHORS: Jonathan Eiseman*, Western Michigan University; Maarten Vonhof, Western Michigan University; Sharon Gill, Western Michigan University\n\nABSTRACT: Soundscapes vary over time and space reflecting dynamic inputs from biological, geophysical and anthropogenic activity. For example, the early morning peak of singing by birds or the rush hour traffic of humans change the composition of soundscapes from those experienced at other times of day. To characterize temporal complexity of soundscapes, researchers may record them over the course of a 24-hour cycle, and when they do so over a season will end up with large datasets that demand considerable storage capacity as well as processing time for analysis. Given these constraints, we investigated how to sample soundscapes, asking two questions: with what frequency should researchers record soundscapes to capture their overall variation? And does an optimal sampling schedule exist for different habitats across different locations? We conducted two tests in forest and grassland habitats at nature preserves in southwest Michigan by recording soundscapes continuously over two 24-hour periods in the spring and summer of 2015. From these recordings, we calculated three acoustic indices for every minute of the 24-hour period to document the actual pattern of soundscape variation over space and time. We then simulated different recording schedules by subsampling the complete dataset (e.g. 1 min every 5, 1 min every 10, up to 1 min every 60). We compared hourly means from continuous sampling versus simulated schemes to assess which recording schedules best reflected overall soundscape variation. Preliminary analyses showed that hourly means from infrequent sampling (1 min every 30, 1 min every 60) were weakly correlated when compared to hourly means from more frequent sampling schemes (1 min every 5) in forests and grasslands. However, subsampled forest recordings generated substantially lower correlations with continuous data than did the subsampled grassland recordings. Expanding analysis to other preserves will inform strategies for capturing temporal complexity of grassland and forest soundscapes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nSpire Parlor\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Dominant Coyotes Impact Gray Fox Occupancy Across the Eastern U.S.\n\nAUTHORS: Michael Egan*, Purdue University; Casey Day, Purdue University; Todd Katzner, U.S. Geological Survey; Patrick Zollner, Purdue University\n\nABSTRACT: Gray fox populations have experienced declines in parts of the eastern United States that differ from the typical pattern of mesopredator release. One hypothesis to explain these population trends is that they have had a negative response to urbanization relative to other mesocarnivores. Alternatively, gray fox declines may be the result of interspecific interactions, particularly competition with abundant coyotes throughout their range. Evidence for both these alternatives have been documented at some spatial scales, however landscape scale studies have only occasionally been used to study how these two factors affect gray fox distributions. To test these hypotheses throughout the gray fox’s range, we used single and two species occupancy models across multiple landscapes to evaluate the effects of habitat covariates and interspecific interactions on gray fox occupancy. Model results indicate that both coyote and gray fox occupancy was positively related to the amount of forest present but these same models provided no evidence that gray foxes were impacted by urban cover. Additionally, model results indicate that, while coyote presence did not impact gray fox occupancy, gray fox occupancy was negatively related to coyote abundance. Based on these results, we concluded that coyote abundance is a stronger driver of low gray fox occupancy in the eastern U.S. than urbanization.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-06: A Tale of Two Forests: Mapping Cultural Ecosystem Services in Central Oregon Using Public Participation GIS\n\nAUTHORS: Rebecca McLain*, Portland State University; Lee Cerveny, US Forest Service PNW Research Station; David Banis, Portland State University\n\nABSTRACT: The 2012 Forest Planning Rule that governs the development of national forest plans in the US specifies the use of ecosystem services as a guiding framework and calls for greater integration of human values and uses into forest planning. Public participation GIS (PPGIS), which facilitates the collection of socio-spatial data from the public, has the potential to address these mandates by enabling the collection of cultural services data about forested landscapes while expanding public engagement opportunities. Our presentation reports the findings from a pilot project conducted during 2016-2017 in which an interactive web-mapping application was used to collect cultural services data from users of the Deschutes and Ochoco National Forests in Oregon. We use spatial analysis techniques, including density and diversity analyses, to describe how the two forests differ in terms of the cultural services mapped by forest users and the range of cultural services each forest provides. Disaggregating the data along socio-demographic dimensions enables us to identify distinct differences in the cultural services associated with each forest according to the age, length of residency, income, and gender of forest users. We examine cultural services “hotspots” in greater detail to determine whether specific types of services are associated with particular ecological contexts. Our analyses indicate that the cultural services associated with the two forests differ significantly despite their close proximity to each other. The Deschutes National Forest PPGIS data reflect a landscape dominated by recreationists whereas the Ochoco National Forest data reflect a landscape in the midst of transitioning from a production-oriented landscape toward one that is increasingly recreation-oriented. Our study offers insights on the usefulness of PPGIS as a tool for integrating spatialized cultural services data into environmental planning processes; however, it also identifies some of the limitations of web-based applications for collecting such data.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-07: Managing Forest Disease Spread with Tangible Landscape Technology\n\nAUTHORS: Devon Gaydos*, Anna Petrasova, Vaclav Petras – Center for Geospatial Analytics, North Carolina State University; Richard Cobb, California Polytechnic University; Ross Meentemeyer, Center for Geospatial Analytics, North Carolina State University\n\nABSTRACT: Geospatial models allow users to explore the dynamics of complex socio-ecological processes occurring over large spatial and temporal scales, making them uniquely suited for ecological management applications. In many cases, however, models are developed without consideration of local stakeholder motivations or compelling user-friendly interfaces, fueling a knowledge-practice gap where better science has not necessarily lead to better management. Tangible Landscape, an open-source participatory modeling tool, has been designed to address this challenge by coupling a physical model of the landscape with a geographic information system. Tangible Landscape allows stakeholders to alter the landscape and instantly visualize the resulting ecological effects. As a team of interdisciplinary researchers, we are leveraging this novel modeling platform to engage stakeholders involved in sudden oak death management in southwest Oregon. Sudden oak death (SOD) is an extremely destructive plant disease which has killed millions of oaks and tanoaks along the Pacific coast. This area of Oregon faces an additional management challenge from a newly introduced strain of the pathogen. This new strain has been shown to be more aggressive, and further disease spread will put significant cultural, environmental and economic resources at risk. To address this issue, we are holding a series of participatory modeling workshops with Oregon stakeholders to evaluate potential management scenarios. We will be discussing results from the first of these workshops, and demonstrating the Tangible Landscape model in action.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 1 (7th Floor)\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nINSECT & DISEASE OUTBREAKS: Insectivorous Birds as Indicators of Future Defoliation by the Spruce Budworm\n\nAUTHORS: Marion Germain*, University of Quebec in Montreal; Marc-André Villard, University of Quebec in Rimouski; Louis de Grandpré, Service Canadien des Forêts; Patrick James, University of Montreal; Dan Kneeshaw, University of Quebec in Montreal; Udaya Vepakomma, FPInnovations; Jean-François Poulin, WSP\n\nABSTRACT: Spruce budworm outbreaks are the most significant disturbance in North American boreal forests. Large-scale, spatially synchronous outbreaks occur periodically, causing significant mortality or growth reduction in spruce and fir over large areas. The current outbreak was first detected in 2006 on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence River and has affected >7 million ha so far. Efficient forest protection against defoliation requires early intervention, but early detection of outbreaks remains challenging. Ground-based surveys cannot be applied over large areas and aerial surveys of current defoliation cannot be used to guide early intervention. In this context, we investigated whether bird population densities can be used as indicators of future defoliation to guide early intervention. Specifically, we modelled the relationships between the occurrence of Tennessee Warbler, Cape May Warbler, and Bay-breasted Warbler and cumulative spruce budworm defoliation at different temporal lags. Using data from a large-scale (>174 000 km²) bird survey conducted between 2006 and 2016 (>1500 point counts) and annual defoliation data in Québec’s North Shore region, we explored the numerical response of each focal bird species to defoliation from 3 years before the count to 6 years after while accounting for spatial variation. Preliminary results confirm the numerical increase of each “budworm warbler” species with increasing defoliation. We also expect species-specific patterns in numerical response, with Cape May Warbler increasing earlier than Bay-breasted and Tennessee Warblers due to the different ways that each of these species use different levels of the tree crown. We expect that our landscape-level models of how warblers respond to defoliation will serve as an effective tool for forest protection by helping to identify outbreaks and to guide early intervention strategies.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n2:15pm CDT\n\nURBAN/EXURBAN LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY: Bicycle-based Measurement of the Intra-Urban Heat Island: Effects of Landscape Context on Fine-Scale Summer Air Temperature in Madison, WI\n\nAUTHORS: Carly Ziter*, Christopher J. Kucharik, Monica G. Turner – University of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nABSTRACT: Mitigation of the urban heat island (hotter temperatures in cities) is an important ecosystem service provided by urban greenspace. Yet while broad-scale causes, magnitude, and spatial extent of urban heat islands are frequently studied, little is known about drivers of temperature variation within cities. Improving climate adaptation strategies in cities is increasingly important as climate warms, and understanding how spatial variation in temperature aligns with residents’ lived experience, especially during the hottest portions of the day, is required. We asked how impervious surfaces and canopy cover interact to influence urban air temperature at fine scales (e.g. 10s to 100s of meters) in Madison, Wisconsin. A custom-developed mobile temperature sensor mounted on a bicycle was used to complement a fixed in situ network of 150 temperature sensors. Throughout summer 2016, we conducted repeated sampling along 10 urban transects (mean length 7 km) that spanned a wide range of impervious and canopy cover – collecting observations of air temperature approximately every 5 meters. Maximum daily temperature for Madison averaged 29°C on sampling days (range: 22 – 34°C). Intra-urban air temperature varied significantly with fine-scale variation in land cover and was coolest where canopy cover was high. Air temperature increased with impervious cover, but canopy cover moderated this effect. Mean daytime air temperature differed by 3.5°C between the hottest and coolest parts of the city (range: 1.1 - 5.7°C), whereas temperature differed by only 0.3°C on fixed sensors during the same measurement periods. The temperature difference within the city was comparable to the broad-scale temperature difference between Madison and its surrounding rural areas, suggesting that urban forestry can enhance temperature regulation services within cities. Our results offer guidance for using land cover within urban landscapes to reduce energy use impacts, and enhance the health and wellbeing of urban residents.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:15pm - 2:30pm CDT\n\nWater Tower Parlor\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\nINSECT & DISEASE OUTBREAKS: Fragmentation of Forest Host Disrupts Cycling Behavior of Defoliator Outbreaks: Evidence from Spruce Budworm and Forest Tent Caterpillar in a Heterogeneous Mixedwood Landscape\n\nAUTHORS: Barry J. Cooke*, Canadian Forestry Service; Brian R. Sturtevant, USDA Forest Service; Louis-Etienne Robert, University of Montreal; Daniel Kneeshaw, University of Quebec at Montreal\n\nABSTRACT: The spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) and forest tent caterpillar (Malacosoma disstria Hbn.) are early-season defoliators of spruce/fir trees and aspen/maple trees, respectively. Both exhibit periodic outbreaks – albeit at different time scales – so they are often perceived as stereotypical “cyclic” forest defoliator species. We contrasted the outbreak dynamics of these two defoliators as they related to forest landscape structure via tree-ring studies within a common landscape. The Border Lakes landscape is a large (20,000 km2) ecoregion containing contrasting land management zones with clear differences in forest landscape structure (i.e., concentration and spatial configuration of host species for each defoliator) while minimizing the confounding influence of climate. We found that outbreaks spruce budworm were more strongly periodic, more synchronous, and more severe in regions with higher concentrations of its host trees, with analogous results for forest tent caterpillar related more strongly to forest fragmentation metrics. However, we were surprised to find each species exhibited complex patterns of spatio-temporal autocovariance that led to a significant departure from purely cyclic, synchronous behaviour. Temporally, cycle peaks were distributed tri-modally, not uni-modally, as predator-prey theory would predict. Spatially, successive outbreak cycles tended to occur in disparate parts of the study area, which is not consistent with Moran’s theorem of cycle synchronization. The net emergent effect was a breakdown in cycle synchrony in those parts of the landscape where host trees were sparse. Spruce budworm tended cycle synchronously where forest tent caterpillar did not, and vice versa. Taken together, this suggests that forest landscape structure modulates cycle amplitude and synchrony, regardless of the herbivore-plant species association. It further suggests a homeostatic mechanism whereby severe outbreaks associated with high abundances of host-tree species tend to be followed by less severe outbreaks occurring in more diverse residual forests.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:30pm - 2:45pm CDT\n\nLaSalle 2 (7th Floor)\n\n2:30pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-01: Is Community Diversity Maximization a Suitable Goal for Landscape Composition?\n\nAUTHORS: Ralph Grundel, Noel B. Pavlovic – U.S. Geological Survey\n\nABSTRACT: How do we set habitat composition goals for landscapes of multiple habitats, especially when some habitats might be of great concern? Should maximizing diversity be the primary goal in prioritizing landscape compositions for conservation? We examined biodiversity patterns for a variety of taxa across part of the Greater Chicago area to understand whether similar landscapes promoted maximization of species richness across taxa. Birds, bees, butterflies, amphibians, reptiles, and plants were assessed. Although there is often an assumption that animal diversity will follow plant diversity, this was not the case. Neither was it true that species diversity was positively correlated among taxa across sites. In part this lack of concordance of species richness among taxa across sites was due to differences in how the taxa responded to their physical environment. Different taxa also expressed varying levels of habitat specialization, contributing to the differences in response to the landscape gradients we examined. We ask to what degree a single landscape can satisfy the needs of multiple taxa and what landscape preference differences might mean for conservation goal setting.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:45pm - 3:00pm CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-04: Changes in the Landscape-Level Habitat Selection of Forest Bats Within Human-Modified Landscapes\n\nAUTHORS: Laura E. D’Acunto, Karly A. Rushmore*, Patrick A. Zollner – Purdue University; Benjamin Pauli, St. Mary’s University of Minnesota\n\nABSTRACT: Species-specific responses to landscape modification are dependent on where a species falls on the habitat specialist-generalist continuum. Some species are designated as specialists or generalists without sufficient evidence, which can then provide faulty predictions of a species’ response to fragmentation. In North America, population declines of bats have triggered a need to understand the habitat associations of species of concern. We compared an established landscape-scale hierarchical occupancy model built within a contiguous forest landscape for three bat species (the northern long-eared bat, Myotis septentrionalis, the Indiana bat, Myotis sodalis, and the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus). These species fell along the specialist-generalist continuum (in regards to forest needs) in a previous model constructed with data from a human-modified landscapes. We hypothesized that species considered contiguous forest specialists would show more plasticity in habitats selected for than more generalist species. We used single-species hierarchical Bayesian occupancy modeling with and without informative priors, and multi-species occupancy models, to test this hypothesis. Our study provided several important insights for bat research and occupancy modeling in general. We found that multi-species models may perform better than single-species models in the case of declining species and that the use of informative priors for a declining species can reduce model fit and influence the outcome of model predictions. We demonstrated that forest-specialist northern long-eared bat and the slightly less forest-specialized Indiana bat exhibited plasticity of habitat selection in human-modified landscapes compared to a contiguous forest landscape. This plasticity could be due to an inherent ability of these species to utilize modified landscapes or a competitive release phenomenon from severe population declines due to disease.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:45pm - 3:00pm CDT\n\nAdams Room\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-06: Social-Ecological Systems Dynamics and Social Perceptions Toward Ecosystem Services\n\nAUTHORS: Cristina Quintas-Soriano*, Idaho State University & Boise State University; Jodi Brandt, Boise State University; Antonio J. Castro, Idaho State University\n\nABSTRACT: Despite widespread recognition that stakeholders’ social values should guide environmental decision-making, it too often remains absent from ecosystem service (ES) assessments. Spatially explicit information that incorporates the perceptions of different stakeholders would provide a rich basis for the development of sustainable and equitable land management strategies. In this study, we engage the general public to identify and map a range of ES, and we spatially explore social perceptions towards those services. Based on over 1,000 face-to-face surveys, we analyze the spatial distribution of ES social values and determine the relationship between social values and stakeholder groups. Our study includes two watersheds in Idaho (US), which have similar biophysical characteristics but whose social-ecological dynamics have diverged over the past 100 years. To achieve our goal, we (1) explore social perceptions for ES, (2) identify spatial patterns in the perceptions of ES for stakeholder groups with different socio-demographic backgrounds, and (3) compare how stakeholders from two divergent social-ecological systems perceive ES. The results reveal overlapping hotspots for the ES valuation, as well as particular patterns in the perceptions of these ES depending of the social-ecological characteristics. Finally, we argue that exploring social values of ES can complement more traditional ES mapping approaches, and helps to incorporate public participatory process in decision-making.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 2:45pm - 3:00pm CDT\n\nGrant Park Parlor\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n2:45pm CDT\n\n3:00pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:30pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n3:45pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:00pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:15pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:30pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n4:45pm CDT\n\n5:00pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Living with Giants: Mitigating Human-Elephant Conflict in Myanmar\n\nAUTHORS: Christie Sampson*, Clemson University & Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; Peter Leimgruber, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; John McEvoy, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; Aung Nyein Chan, Colorado State University & Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute & WWF–Myanmar; George Wittemyer, Colorado State University; Jenny Glikman, San Diego Zoo Global; David O’Connor, San Diego Zoo Global; David Tonkyn, Clemson University & University of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nABSTRACT: Our research has detected an extreme rate of poaching occurring in Myanmar. This was initially identified when seven of the 19 elephants collared for a telemetry study were found dead or disappeared within six days to one year of being fitted with a satellite-GPS collar. Subsequent follow up of ground teams confirmed the human caused loss of at least 19 elephants, including the seven collared individuals, within a 35 square kilometer area in less than two years. 40 additional elephant carcasses were found across Myanmar once systematic surveys began. In addition, we are conducting an interview survey to assess the perception of poaching among communities. The responses from this survey will be used to inform conservation policy and anti-poaching programs. Myanmar represents one of the last remaining countries with substantial wildlands suitable for elephants. Increasing rates of human-elephant conflict and poaching events in this country pose a dire threat to the global population.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Local and Landscape-Scale Predictors of Egg-Mass Abundance in Wood Frogs and Spotted Salamanders in Southeastern Massachusetts\n\nAUTHORS: Amanda Deguire*, Thilina Surasinghe, Emily Donahue, Jackie Toomey, Sarah Jones – Bridgewater State University\n\nABSTRACT: Given their ephemeral nature and small size, vernal pools are unique habitats that are critical for temperate amphibians with a biphasic life cycle. Both local and landscape-scale predictors of amphibian occupancy at vernal pools have been extensively studied, and these species responses can vary significantly across geographies. In this study, we explored effects of land-cover change at variable spatial scales on the egg-mass abundance of two widespread North American amphibians— wood frogs and spotted salamanders. We surveyed egg masses at eight vernal pools located in southeastern Massachusetts in March-April period (2016-2017), and estimated several local (canopy cover, pool width, and upland basal area) and landscape scale (percent forested and built-up land-cover types around 100m, 500m and 1km radius around the vernal pool) environmental variables. Although egg-mass abundance of both focal species was greater in vernal pools located in rural landscapes than those of urban landscapes (wood frogs: urban=15.17, rural=30.27; spotted salamanders: urban=8.17, rural=43.81), those differences were statistically insignificant for wood frogs whereas a significantly greater number of spotted-salamander egg masses were found in rural vernal pools. Multivariate statistical analyses indicated that the percent forest cover around a 500m-buffer is a significant predictor of species composition of egg masses. A multiple stepwise generalized linear model indicated that canopy cover, pool width, forest cover at all spatial scales, and built-up land-cover at 1km radius being important predictors for egg-mass abundance of spotted salamanders. The same modeling approach showed that canopy cover, pool width, and both built-up and forest land-cover at all spatial scales being important predictors for egg-mass abundance of wood frogs. Our study shows the importance of both urban and forested vernal pools for amphibian breeding. Regional municipalities should retool their biodiversity conservation efforts where vernal pools are protected at landscape-scale as interconnected wetland-woodland habitat complexes.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Ophiocordyceps Sinensis Availability and Range in Western Himalaya - Tragedy of Commons and Climate Variability Impacts on Alpine Ecosystem\n\nAUTHORS: Regina B Thomas*, University of Kansas; Xingong Li*, University of Kansas; Gautam Talukdar, Wildlife Institute of India\n\nABSTRACT: Micro-climate of high altitude regions is influenced by global climate variations and indirectly the local livelihoods of mountain communities. Between 3000m - 4500m altitude in the western Himalayas in India a mountain community is irrevocably dependent economically on a medicinal fungus beginning late 1990s. This medicinal fungus, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, is sensitive to climate variability, human-interactions and has a limited evolutionary capacity. This study delineates the potential geographic distribution region and conducts a spatio-temporal comparison for clear visualization for any range variations. Maxent model is used to predict the geographic distribution area and range variations between 2010 -2017; only field validated occurrence points are used in combination with abiotic factors viz. product of NDVI, snow cover frequency from MODIS data along with topographical variables. The range variations are distributed into two short periods of three years each In addition, participatory research practice helps us argue that the current harvest practice discourages recuperation of the medicinal fungus and there is visible climatic variability and consequences on the landscape in last two decades. Although, this study does not intend to delve into value assessment of the ecosystem instead it focuses on the climate variability effects on the species as a surrogate to draw chain of effects on the alpine ecosystem and human communities. The results from a preliminary analysis have indicated variations in potential suitable range, as its inability to rapidly adapt to a new zone is uncertain it will have a major negative impact on the local livelihood.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Optimal Predictor Variables of Urban Hawk Breeding Success\n\nAUTHORS: Justin White, University of Wisconsin-Parkside\n\nABSTRACT: Urban habitats in North America can be both resource islands and ecological traps for raptors, but various characteristics of the urban landscape impact individual species differently. The complexity of urban environments make it difficult to identify which variables most impact reproductive efforts. To identify the optimal predictor of Red-tailed Hawk nesting success, I examined eight characteristics of the urban landscape (nightlight, noise level, building height, building footprint, employee density, residential density, an index of overall urban density, and land cover type (agriculture, riparian, impervious, trees, desert shrub)) at four spatial scales for 110 nests in Reno, NV during the 2015-16 breeding seasons. Nests were considered successful if they produced at least one fledgling. Success was calculated using a logistic exposure model with a binomial response and a logistic exposure link function. Models were created with all variable combinations, excluding those that were collinearly related. The final models were chosen based on their Akaike’s Information Criterion scores. The optimal predictor of nesting success was land cover type when measured within a 670-m radius (the nearest-nest midpoint distance) around the nest. Nesting success declined with riparian cover, and increased with desert shrub and agriculture (P<0.05). With large ranges and high dietary generalism these hawks are able to successfully nest atop the complex urban mosaic except when riparian cover dominates their range. Other elements of the urban landscape such as intra- and interspecific competition or localized human actions were not included in this study but may be of critical importance to individual nest success.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Patterns in Hybridization Between Native and Invasive Species\n\nAUTHORS: Julia Needham*, Amanda Chunco – Elon University\n\nABSTRACT: Human activity is causing the rapid movement of species around the globe, both directly through human facilitated movement and indirectly as a consequence of climate change. In addition to direct harm to native species through predation and competitive exclusion, introduced species can also impact native species through hybridization. Here, we have examined hybridization events between native and invasive species to determine taxonomic, temporal, and geographic patterns in hybrid zone formation. Using Web of Science, we identified 54 cases of hybridization between native and invasive species published between 2011 and 2016. Preliminary results have identified clear taxonomic patterns, with the largest numbers of studies focusing on fishes, and geographic clustering of hybrid zones in the United States, Europe, and Japan. This work also reveals significant gaps in knowledge of invasive species and the natives that they affect. Specifically, updated spatial data are unavailable for many of the species included in our study and, alarmingly, 40% of those species, including two of the most studied invasives – the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss – were unassessed by the IUCN Red List. This work has clear implications for global impacts of invasive species through the risk of genetic introgression. This paper also uncovers gaps in hybridization research that, due to our quickly-changing landscape, must be addressed soon to ensure the success of current conservation efforts.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Predicting Invasive Species Richness with Boosted Regression Trees\n\nAUTHORS: Namaluba Malawo*, Gabriela Nunez, Songlin Fei – Purdue University\n\nABSTRACT: Invasive species have become a major problem in the US, but our understanding of invasion patterns and key drivers are still limited. Using a powerful tool in predictive biogeography, Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs), we created models which can predict exotic species distribution for the Eastern United States at a high resolution. BRTs build on binary decision trees and combine them to create a linear combination of many trees. This leads to a more accurate model of invasion prediction and allows us to better identify key underlying variables that drive the observed patterns. Ultimately, our goal was to create a model with many trees and low deviance that could accurately predict invasive plant species richness patterns for the Eastern United States. The data measures 38 different variables, including soil characteristics, biotic variables, and anthropogenic drivers. The results of our work will help us better understand drivers of invasion by quantifying the relative contribution of each variable. Additionally, the results from our studies can then be used by policy makers and practitioners to manage invasions of species with more proactive measures and preventative actions. These uses will alleviate areas in the Eastern United States from significant ecological and economic damages.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\nPOSTER: Residential Landscape Ecology: Understanding Ecological Patterns and Processes of the Fastest Growing Land Cover Type in the U.S.\n\nAUTHORS: Basil V. Iannone III, Gisele Nighswander, Kayla Hess – School of Forest Resources and Conservation, University of Florida\n\nABSTRACT: Residential landscapes and their associated institutional and economic land uses are the fastest growing land cover type in the United States. These anthropogenic ecosystems alter spatial patterns of biodiversity and species movement through a number of mechanisms, including habitat fragmentation and the creation of designer and engineered ecosystems, such as ornamental gardens and stormwater ponds. Furthermore, while urban and urbanizing areas tend to be ecologically homogeneous relative to one another across large spatial scales, ecological processes, particularly those occurring at smaller spatial scales, within a given urban or residential landscape can be very heterogeneous. This poster will highlight multiple investigations being conducted by the Residential Landscape Ecology Lab at the University of Florida that contribute to the long-term goal of quantifying spatial patterns and drivers of ecological processes within and surrounding residential landscapes. The aims of these projects are: (1) to mitigate the negative impacts of expanding residential landscapes and (2) to inform the design of future residential landscapes so that they exhibit greater levels of ecological functionality. Ongoing projects include quantifying how landscaping practices aimed at reducing irrigation and fertilizer needs impact hydrological connectivity, water quality, and plant communities in adjacent wetlands; determining the degree to which ornamental plantings in stormwater pond networks benefit downstream water quality; and the effects of alpha and beta diversity, structural complexity, and landscape context of ornamental gardens on top-down and bottom-up regulation of herbivorous arthropod pests. In addition, we are pursuing research aimed at quantifying the impacts of landscaping plant choices and stormwater ponds on patterns of plant invasion across multiple spatial scales and quantifying spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem services that benefit homeowners (e.g., cooling, soil fertility, and arthropod pest control) and the spatial thresholds at which these services become homogeneous.\n\nMonday April 9, 2018 5:30pm - 7:00pm CDT\n\nMonroe Room\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n5:30pm CDT\n\n7:00pm CDT\n\n9:00pm CDT\n\n7:00am CDT\n\n7:00am CDT\n\n7:30am CDT\n\n8:15am CDT\n\n9:30am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:00am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:15am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:30am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n10:45am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:00am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:15am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\n11:30am CDT\n\nSYMPOSIA-10: Clean and Green: Vacant Lot Stewardship and the Creation of New Natures in Chicago\n\nAUTHORS: Paul H.

Williams, Alessandro Rigolon – University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nABSTRACT: A growing academic and planning literature has identified vacant lot restoration as an important area of opportunity to increase biodiversity and other ecosystem services. While ecological goals should be part of an overall strategy for urban revitalization, they must be integrated with the personal goals of residents who live in neighborhoods with high vacancy rates. We studied the perceptions and stewardship activities of residents who purchased city-owned vacant lots for $1 under the inaugural offering of the City of Chicago’s Large Lot Program using a mixed-methods approach that included systematic observation of environmental conditions via aerial and street-level photography, coupled with a mail survey and focus groups of lot owners. We found considerable evidence that greening was a primary component of vacant lot stewardship but little support for intentional activities to achieve ecological goals. Results point to an overall reduction in tree canopy with residents often removing trees off lots because they were seen as hazardous, overgrown, or in the wrong place. The few times lot owners mentioned wildlife was in negative contexts associated with overgrown vegetation that attracts unwanted rodents, raccoons and opossums. On the positive side, gardening was observed and reported as a desirable activity, and overall yard and turf management aimed for an aesthetic that emphasized vegetation that was neat, clean, beautiful and functional. Our findings suggest that biodiversity and ecological goals must be compatible with social preferences in order to be considered part of vacant lot stewardship. Vacant lot programs that integrate social and ecological factors could help create mutually beneficial new natures that depart from traditional, single-track solutions. Two mutually compatible strategies are suggested: (1) develop ecological goals for revitalization that embrace a range of residential preferences, and (2) develop educational outreach programs related to ecological goals and provide resources for their implementation.\n\nTuesday April 10, 2018 11:30am - 11:45am CDT\n\nHancock Parlor\n\n11:30am CDT\n\nURBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING: Towards Better Understanding of Urban Thermal Environment from a Multiscale Perspective\n\nAUTHORS: Jia Wang *, Weiqi Zhou – State Key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology, Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nABSTRACT: Rapid urbanization leads to the Urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon which affects ecological processes and human health. Previous studies largely investigate the dynamics of temperature in the urban areas, and focus on single city level based on the thermal remote sensing data or the long time series of meteorological data. However, few studies have revealed the real dynamics of land surface temperature (LST) due to its spatial heterogeneity from multiscale levels (city level, urban-rural gradient and hot spot zone). In this study, we presented a general framework for analysing the dynamics of urban thermal environment from a multiscale perspective in Beijing, using the annual average summer LST from 2000-2015 based on MODIS global LST 8-day data. We found that: 1) The average LST and UHII were increasing significantly from 2000-2015 in urban areas, but varied greatly in urban areas with different development degree. The increase rates of average LST and UHII in the new urban areas were higher than those in the old urban areas; 2) The rates of LST increased with the increase of distance from urban core; 3) Overall 3.41% of the study area had a significantly positive trend of LST with the rate of 0.19?/a, mainly distributed in Dax"
