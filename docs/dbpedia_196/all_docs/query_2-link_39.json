        "text": "Wabash College Athletics Hall of Fame\n\nBack To Hall of Fame Back To Hall of Fame\n\nChoose a Hall Of Fame Member:\n\nJim Pursel\n\nClass\n\n1973\n\nInduction\n\n2020\n\nSport(s)\n\nFootball, Track and Field\n\nJim, it is worth noting that you set an all-time Wabash record as the most-nominated student-athlete in the history of this Athletics Hall of Fame. Understand this: you were nominated for induction by two Trustees, two former NAWM Board Members, and at least six current Hall of Fame members. And they were right to do so, for you really were THE big man on campus in the early 1970s as a four-year letterman in football and track and field, team captain, and Sphinx Club President.\n\nAs a defensive lineman, you more than held your own playing in the rugged ICC against scholarship programs like Valpo, Butler, St. Joseph’s, and Indiana Central. As a senior, you were named the Outstanding Defensive Lineman and Wabash MVP, while making Second Team All-ICC honors – an enormous accomplishment given the size of the schools against which you competed.\n\nIn track and field, you were a consistent point scorer in discus and javelin, but you were by far the College’s most outstanding shot-putter. A Little State Champion, you broke the College’s shot-put record that had been held by Stan Huntsman for 16 years, and you would go on to break that record twice more. Remarkably, that school record throw of 50-feet, 4-inches stood until 2011.\n\nUnder your leadership, Wabash won the GLCA Track and Field Championship in 1970, 1971, and 1972, the ICC Championship in 1971 and 1972, and was undefeated in dual meets in 1970 and 1971.\n\nThe National Association of Wabash Men says that it is high time that you are lifted up for recognition through induction into the Wabash Athletics Hall of Fame. Congratulations, Jim, you are Some Little Giant.\n\nBack To Hall of Fame"
