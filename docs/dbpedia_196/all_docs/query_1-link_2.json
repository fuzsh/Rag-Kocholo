        "text": "Bio\n\nLinemen are supposed to be the unseen heroes of gridiron, who work to provide their backfield teammates with open space to run. But it was difficult to miss Century Allen Milstead's tackle play, first at Wabash, and later at Yale. Powerfully strong, agile on his feet, fast and limber, Milstead worked wonders with his 6-4, 205-pound frame. His incredible performances at Wabash in 1921 helped the Little Giants beat such teams as Purdue (9-0), Georgetown (41-0), DePauw (22-0) and Butler (14-0). Milstead transferred to Yale in 1922 and, according to eligibility rules, sat out that season. Then, in 1923, Milstead played a key role in a perfect Eli campaign which brought him All-America recognition. After graduation, he coached at Yale, played pro ball for the New York Giants, became a sales executive, served as president of the Touchdown Club of New York as well as on the Lambert Trophy board, became an adviser to the Boy Scouts of America and the New York Waterfront Commissioner. He was also a Field Artillery Major in World War II. His unusual name came from being born on the first day of the Twentieth Century."
