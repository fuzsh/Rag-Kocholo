Football, Track and Field

Virtually every Little Giant coach was excited to learn that you would leave Indian Creek High School to attend Wabash. After all, you had played four sports in high school, excelled in each, and even did a stint as a cheerleader. At Wabash, though, you focused your athletic ability on football and track, earning four letters in each sport. Your experiences in track made you a better football player, and dodging would-be tacklers made you a step quicker as a track man. The honors you won in each sport share a common theme—leadership and commitment. You were captain, most valuable offensive back, most valuable player, and the mental attitude award winner in football for Coach Greg Carlson.

Twice you were captain of Coach Rob Johnson’s track team, where you were an all-conference hurdler and won the Little Giant Award. To this day, you remain the only player in Wabash football history to rush for over 2,000 yards, catch over 100 passes, and take those passes for more than 1,000 yards—a strange combination of statistics which reveal your versatility. You might well have become Wabash’s all-time leading rusher, but you bounced outside to catch passes for a season, then moved back to running back when you were needed. You rank sixth all-time with 2,341 rushing yards, highlighted by a stunning 208-yard performance in your rookie season.

The College Football Hall of Fame recognized your excellence—as economics major and athlete—with a Postgraduate Fellowship. Today you pursue a career in banking with the same zeal with which you took on linebackers. For leadership, excellence, and for being the consummate team player, the National Association of Wabash Men is proud to induct you, Timothy W. Oliver, in the Wabash College Athletics Hall of Fame.
