        "text": "United States Agency for International Development\n\nBureau for Humanitarian Response\n\nOffice of Transition Initiatives\n\nCountry Situation\n\nThe IMF has continued to delay loans to Indonesia, demanding reforms that the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has agreed to but not yet implemented. This has unnerved the currency markets, with the rupiah falling to six month lows against the US dollar. President Wahid has sacked two key economic cabinet ministers, and publicly dedicated himself to improving the economy. Economic recovery and progress are widely recognized to hold the key to alleviating rising social tensions in Indonesia.\n\nViolence in Aceh has continued, and perhaps increased, despite a cease-fire deal being negotiated in Geneva between the GOI and the GAM (Free Aceh Movement). The cease-fire should be signed on May 12, with plans for joint monitoring centers to be established throughout the area. This agreement is being touted as the first step to a comprehensive resolution to the Aceh conflict. Over three hundred people have been killed in Aceh this year, and Mobil Oil operations have been coming under attack by both gunfire and grenade.\n\nThe Aceh based trials of 24 Indonesian military soldiers accused of a mass killing in Aceh began in mid-April amid much turmoil. Many clashes have erupted between the security forces and civilians because of doubts about the objectiveness of the process. The Acehnese have little faith in the ability of a mixed civilian/military court to do justice in this case. Should the case reach a successful conclusion it will offer hope that Indonesia can begin to grapple with other high profile human rights cases in the country.\n\nAmbon erupted in renewed violence immediately following the visit of Vice-President Megawati. Throughout the Molluccas, religious conflict is simmering and continues to claim lives. The communities have been largely divided at this stage, and over 80,000 internally displaced people are housed in refugee centers in Ambon alone. Over three thousand people have been killed in the past year, and solutions remain distant. The fighting spread rapidly through the islands, and has unfortunate resonance nationally because of the religious labels being applied. Fringe elements of the Muslim community have formed several \"Jihad\" forces, whose purported aim is to travel to the Moluccas and join the battle. In the mainland, the GOI has been successful in averting the arrival of these outside forces.\n\nThe West Papuan Peoples' Presidium held a midnight march and peaceful dawn rally to mark the anniversary ending Dutch colonial rule in the province. Authorities had feared that the group would attempt to raise the outlawed West Papuan flag, but an earlier agreement between the Presidium and the security forces ensured that this action would not take place. The gathering dispersed quietly shortly before noon and shops in the downtown retail districts resumed their trade later in the day.\n\nOTI Highlights\n\nA. Narrative Summary\n\nDecentralization\n\nIn a joint effort with USAID's Office of Economic Growth, OTI supported the efforts of the Indonesia Forum to conduct a study of the impact of financial decentralization upon the management of revenue and expenditure earned locally and from central government disbursements in seven provinces. Results of this workshop will be presented at a national level conference to be attended by senior central and regional government officials, universities, and civil society organizations.\n\nCivilian-Military Programming\n\nSix proposals for civilian-military activities valued at more than $343,000 were reviewed and approved. The focus of the approved grants will be research on TNI's Territorial Commands in Jakarta (KODAM Jaya), East Java (KODAM Brawijaya), West Java (KODAM Siliwangi), South Sulawesi (KODAM VII Wirabuane), and the Territorial Command that includes the Provinces of Bali, NTB & NTT (KODAM Udayana). SANDIKOTA (Urban Studies Foundation) chaired a planning workshop where grantees presented their individual projects and developed core questions common to all the projects. The results of the research projects will be reported to both civilian and military leadership at the national and local levels and to the general public. These projects have the potential of directly impacting how TNI realigns itself as it claims to refocus to legitimate security issues. It is significant to note that these activities would not have been possible in previous governments.\n\nWorking with Gajah Mada University of Yogyakarta, OTI/Indonesia is addressing one of the less traditional impacts TNI has on Indonesian society - 'militarism' of civil society. The university will collect data, conduct workshops and talk shows and publish articles, reports and findings in various electronic and print media. Diminishing the impact of military values and practices on civil society is the focus of this six-month project. One of the initial interest areas - security organizations of political parties - has resonated throughout Indonesia and has resulted in several stories appearing in national and local news media, including the largest Indonesian daily -- Kompas. Respondents were from the Indonesian elite and included President Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), Lt. Gen. Agus Wirahadikusumah and Cornelis Lay. Research revealed that many of the security organizations of the political parties are organized like the military with a structure similar to TNI's. These security organizations have military style uniforms and often perform security functions normally expected of the police. If the initial activities are any indications of future activities, the project will spark a lively debate on the impact of militarism on Indonesian society.\n\nImproving Local Governance\n\nPARLIAMENT WATCH ACTION PLANNING WORKSHOPS. OTI Medan has received proposals from throughout Sumatra for activities to monitor local parliaments, but felt that in general the proposals lacked focus, broad based support and sustainable mechanisms. To enable the organizations to \"go back to the drawing board\" with input from a wider variety of interest groups, OTI Medan supported a series of workshops in South Sumatra, Lampung, Jambi and Bengkulu provinces. The objective was to develop sustainable collaborative action plans designed as much as possible to satisfy common interests.\n\nVILLAGE LEADER TRAINING. OTI/Medan completed a project in North Sumatra and began another in Bengkulu (through the Development Administration Laboratory of the University of Bengkulu). Each brought together between 50 and 125 local leaders at a time to explore how the general principles of democracy and now Indonesian legislation are applicable to their role as heads of village.\n\nB. Grants Activity Summary\n\nOTI Indonesia grant numbers break down as follows, FY00:\n\nC. Coordination\n\nOTI staff organized and chaired a donors coordination meeting on human rights. OTI also attended a Jakarta-based coordination meeting with UNESCO and other donors doing media work in West Timor. OTI staff participated heavily in the USAID strategy re-write for Indonesia.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nIn Washington, Jim Lehman at (202) 712-0113, or jlehman@usaid.gov\n\nIn Indonesia, Michael Stievater at 62 21 348 30917, or mstievater@usaid.gov"
