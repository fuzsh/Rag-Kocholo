Kostrad is a Corps level command which has up to 35,000 troops. It also supervises operational readiness among all commands and conducts defense and security operations at the strategic level in accordance with policies of the TNI commander.\n\nAs a corps, Kostrad is commanded by a Panglima (Commander-in-Chief), usually a lieutenant general. Kostrad falls under the army chief of staff for training, personnel, and administration.[2] However, it comes under the Commander-in-Chief of the Indonesian National Armed Forces for operational command and deployment.\n\nStarting 1984 the Panglima of Kostrad (Pangkostrad) has been charged to lead the conduct of combat operations, called defense and security operations.\n\nHistory[]\n\nKostrad came into being during military action for Indonesia's take over of Western New Guinea in 1960, and was formally constituted on 6 March 1961.[3] Initially designated the Army General Reserve Corps, its name was changed to Kostrad in 1963.\n\nGeneral Suharto, was appointed as the first head of Kostrad in 1961, and it was in this role that he was able assert the army's control in the days following the abortive coup attempt on the evening of 30 September 1965, which ultimately led to Suharto replacing Sukarno as Indonesian president.\n\nThe command's troops have fought in most Indonesian military operations since their formation, such as G-30-S/PKI (30 September Movement/Indonesian Communist Party), Trisula, the PGRS (Sarawak People's Guerrilla Force) in Sarawak, the PARAKU (North Kalimantan People's Force) in North Kalimantan, and Operation Seroja in East Timor.\n\nKostrad troops have also been used beyond Indonesia's borders, as was the case with Garuda Contingent in Egypt (1973–78) and Vietnam (1973–75) and with those in the United Nations Iran–Iraq Military Observer Group in the midst of the Iran–Iraq War of 1989 and 1990.\n\nStrength[]\n\nKostrad had a strength of 27,000 in 1998[1] and its primary components consist of two infantry divisions.\n\nThere were as of early 1998 a total of 33 airborne and infantry battalions within Kostrad. Each division contained three infantry and/or airborne brigades; an armoured battalion; cavalry reconnaissance company; field artillery regiment of three battalions; air defence artillery battalion; combat engineer battalion; supply and transportation battalion; medical battalion; signal company; military police company; field maintenance company; and a personnel and administrative detachment.[4]\n\nInfantry Division 1 Kostrad, headquartered at Cilodong, West Java\n\nInfantry Division 2 Kostrad, headquartered at Malang, East Java\n\n3rd Airborne Infantry Brigade (Ujung Pandang)(Former Kopassus 3 Group)[5]\n\nThere have been several reports that a third division was to be formed for KOSTRAD, for example in an announcement by then KOSTRAD commander Lieutenant General Hadi Waluyo on 16 March 2005.[6] Waluyo's announcement indicated that the new division was to be formed around the 3rd Airborne Infantry Brigade, which would be shifted to a new site in Papua once the expansion programme had advanced further. However, despite this and other announcements, no third division has yet been established.\n\nList of Kostrad Commanders[]\n\nMany Kostrad commanders have gone on to very senior Indonesian posts. Suharto became President; General Rudini became Minister of Home Affairs; General Wismoyo is married to the sister of Suharto's late wife; and Lieutenant General Tarub became the armed forces' Chief of the General Staff.[7]\n\nSuharto (March 1961 – December 1965)\n\nUmar Wirahadikusumah (December 1965 – May 1967)\n\nKemal Idris May 1967 – March 1969\n\nWahono (March 1969 – February 1970)\n\nMakmun Murod (February 1970 – December 1971)\n\nWahono (December 1971 – March 1973)\n\nPoniman (March 1973 – May 1974)\n\nHimawan Susanto (May 1974 – January 1975)\n\nLeo Lopulisa (January 1975 – January 1978)\n\nWiyogo Atmodarminto (January 1978 – March 1980)\n\nIsmail (March 1980 – January 1981)\n\nRudini (January 1981 – May 1983)\n\nSuweno (May 1983 – January 1986)\n\nSuripto (January 1986 – August 1987)\n\nAdolf Sagala Rajagukguk (August 1987 – March 1988)\n\nSugito (March 1988 – August 1990)\n\nWismoyo Arismunandar (August 1990 – July 1992) (Becoming KSAD, TNI Army Chief of Staff)\n\nKuntara (July 1992 – September 1994)\n\nTarub (September 1994 – April 1996)\n\nWiranto (April 1996 – June 1997) (Becoming KSAD, TNI Army Chief of Staff)\n\nSugiyono (June 1997 – March 1998)\n\nPrabowo Subianto (March 1998 – May 1998)\n\nJohnny J.
