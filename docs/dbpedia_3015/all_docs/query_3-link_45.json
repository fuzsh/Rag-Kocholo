        "text": "Heryanto Arbi turned on the class when it mattered yesterday to help Indonesia sweep into the Thomas Cup semi-finals with a crushing 4-1 victory over South Korea.\n\nFormer world champion Arbi looked to be on the brink of dropping the opening game of his clash with Hwang Sun-ho, when the pumped up Korean raced into a commanding 14-10 lead. But with the vocal Indonesian supporters roaring him on at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium, Arbi produced a string of bewildering shots to surge back to 14-14, before eventually winning 17-14.\n\nThe fightback knocked the stuffing out of the brave Hwang, whose game collapsed under some ferocious pressure from his classy opponent. Arbi never allowed Hwang any room to work in during the second game, which he won 15-0.\n\nArbi's opening rubber was followed by the doubles, where Indonesian duo Ricky A. Subagja and Rexy Mainaky proved too strong for Korean counterparts Lee Dong-soo and Yoo Yong-sung, winning 15-9, 15-4.\n\nMarleve Mainkay made light work of his tie on his way to a 15-2, 15-1 victory over Jang Chun-woong, and although Ha Tae-kwon and Kang Kyung-jin restored some pride with victory in their doubles match, Joko Suprianto wrapped things up with a 15-2, 15-1 drubbing of Jun Jong-bae.\n\n'We are happy with the way we are playing,' said Indonesian manager Agus Wirahadikusumah. 'Even to win 4-1 we are happy.' The Indonesians are now looking ahead to tomorrow's group decider against Malaysia, who also booked their semi-finals place yesterday with a 5-0 rout of the Netherlands.\n\n'I think it will be a pretty tough match,' said Wirahadikusumah. The Indonesian army general said China were the strongest side in the tournament but warned his team were 'ready to fight' to defend their title.\n\nIn last night's late Group A matches, China gave Hong Kong's inexperienced youngsters a hard lesson, ruthlessly inflicting a 5-0 defeat on the SAR's men.\n\nNg Wei got the biggest cheer of the match when he raced into a 9-3 lead in the opening game of his match with Dong Jiong.\n\nBut Dong was too good for Wei, recovering to win 15-9, 15-8. China's victory ensured their place in the semi-finals with one group match left to play.\n\nThey will not find out who their semi-final opponents will be until the completion of the first round tomorrow.\n\nDenmark also qualified for the semi-finals from Group A despite their Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen suffering a shock defeat against world number 18 Thomas Johansson. Larsen looked set for a comfortable victory after taking the first game 15-5.\n\nBut an amazing fightback from Johansson saw the Swede save a match point before winning the second game 17-16 and then clinching the decider 15-8.\n\nJim Laugesen and Thomas Stavngaard saw the Danes through in the crucial rubber when they beat their Swedish rivals 15-8, 15-7."
