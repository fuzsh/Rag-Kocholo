It is, however, also designed as a work in its own right, because the difference with the subject matter of the preceding volumes is so great that it can be seen as an independent work. The whole trilogy reports the journey of Catholicism in Indonesia from its modest return to the country in the early nineteenth century, through a quite strong process of mass conversions in the first forty years of the twentieth century, towards a consolidation in independent Indonesia, after 1945. In the period 1808–1945 two major historical development steered the unpretentious, but later quite spectacular expansion of Catholicism in some regions of the Dutch East Indies. From 1850 on, there was a strong Catholic emancipation in the Netherlands that enabled the sending of some 3000 missionaries, priests, religious brothers and sisters to the Indies (figures of the late 1930s). They were supported by the educational efforts of the late colonial rule (beginning in the early twentieth century) and its sympathy for Christian missionary institutions. This had created a structure that facilitated in the Northern and Eastern Outer Islands a massive conversion to either Protestantism or Catholicism. This third volume starts in various chapters with a short description of the period 1942–1945 when the Japanese took over the administration from the Dutch, because the first two volumes only discussed the period 1808–1942. Its major goal is to describe how Catholicism survived in the independent Republic of Indonesia during the Sukarno regime (1945–1965), and then could regain a new dynamic during the religious revival that was part of the New Order of Soeharto after 1965. There were differences of viewpoint between Dutch and Indonesian clergy, between clergy and some lay people, between pro-Dutch groups in East Indonesia versus hardcore nationalist priests in Java, but in great contrast to what happened among Protestant Christians, the Catholics could retain their organisational unity. The same happened when a more individual style of religion grew since the 1970s with Charismatic Catholics who did not differ so much from Protestants in spirituality. There were minor conflicts and even a small schism, but on the whole the clergy was very successful in keeping their flock together and obedient to the bishops. The strong emphasis on education of the colonial period was reduced, but in urban regions the Catholics could continue to attract pupils from the elite, including many Muslims, for their schools and universities. Development aid\n\nviii\n\nPreface Preface\n\nprogrammes in the Western countries coincided with the Soeharto emphasis on development. The Catholics also participated, started projects and ngos, but this was not as important as the educational efforts that were the backbone of the expansion and organisation of the Catholic group in the colonial period. Although smaller in numbers than the Protestants (slightly less than 3% against nearly 6% Protestants), the Catholics showed modest but steady growth and continuing recognition as a well organised community with a modern image. The unified nation state was very much centralised until the beginning of some de-centralisation in the period of Reformasi after the fall of Soeharto in 1998. Regional differences, however, remained very significant. These also may be labelled as ethnic differences. Besides a distinction according to sex, an individual Indonesian identity is determined by religion and ethnicity. This book has a second part that is fully devoted to the regional developments, because a majority of Catholics live in the so-called Outer Islands, outside the major island of Java. I am not the first to write this history, although there is no full work available in English on this topic. Most major works have been published only in Dutch or in Indonesian. In 1969 Martinus Muskens had already given his overview of the developments within Indonesian Catholicism between 1945–1967. Muskens underlined that while the new Catholic mission began during the colonial period Catholics had become truly integrated Indonesians. He paid much more attention to the national political development than to the internal dynamics of the Catholic community. The 1979 English and German editions of his dissertation of 1969 had the subtitle: ‘Partners in Nation Building’. This work of Muskens was further elaborated in the five volumes of the great history of the Catholic Church, published in Indonesian in 1973–74. Huub Boelaars (Dutch dissertation 1991; Indonesian translation 2005) has taken Indonesianisasi as a major theme for this period. He understands this mostly as a process of change from foreign to indigenous leadership, in fact from mostly Dutch clergy to Indonesian priests, nuns, and brothers. Boelaars has much statistic material, collected by the research department of the Catholic Atma Jaya University of Jakarta, and shows a special ability of using his data. Some arguments can be given against his emphasis on this process as a central theme. It puts the clergy on the first row in this view of history. It gives a central place to the presence of the foreign clergy, especially in the period 1955–1965 when it was nearly impossible to arrange entrance visas and working permits for new Dutch personnel of the Catholic Church. Moreover, many regions of Indonesia have a long tradition of what has been labelled as\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\n‘stranger-kings’ by anthropologists.1 Being directed, instructed and even ruled by foreigners is not so uncommon in Indonesian societies. From the Catholic community itself there were very seldom protests against the dominant position of the foreign clergy, until the mid-1970s. There is a third book that covers the topic of this book. In 2001 the Jesuit priest and historian Hasto Rosariyanto published his survey of the Indonesian Catholics by presenting portraits of most of the (then 34) dioceses: Bercermin pada Wajah-wajah Keuskupan Gereja Katolik Indonesia (A Mirror of the Catholic Dioceses of Indonesia). Rosariyanto uses the methodology of selfsurvey, involving leaders from the various dioceses. This resulted sometimes in nice historical overviews, but very often also more in wishes for the future as ‘vision and mission’ than in a sketch of past development and critical interpretation. We must also mention the two editions of Adolf Heuken, Ensiklopedi Gereja, an Encyclopaedia of the Catholic Church in five volumes published in the mid 1990s and in an enlarged nine volumes of the 2004–05 edition. In 2000 this author started a parallel project, together with Jan Aritonang of the Theological School of Jakarta, in order to publish an encyclopaedic overall history of Christianity in Indonesia. It resulted in 2008 in a 1004 page volume where, in line with their larger number, most of the space was devoted to Protestant developments. The project proved to be a good exercise for the writing of this much more detailed and more broadly documented history of the Catholic communities. This present book has taken much material from these books as well as from many other sources. For the early period until 1980 it was most often Dutch mission magazines, archives of the Dutch orders and the large collection with interviews with missionaries in Nijmegen. For the later period there were mostly Indonesian sources: materials collected during several trips from 1997–2007, and the many pages of the weekly Hidup. There was not only a lapse of time since the major publications by Muskens and Boelaars, but a different perspective was also provided by the position of its author and of the public that he had in mind while writing this book. I have spent most of my active academic career since 1970 as a researcher and lecturer in the Muslim communities of Indonesia, first as a researcher in the world of pesantren, the traditional religious schools, 1970–74. Then from 1978–1988 I was working in a project of cooperation between Dutch universities and the State Academy of Islamic Studies. For this project I lived and taught in Jakarta and Yogyakarta between 1981 and 1988 as a foreign expert in what is now uin, Universitas Islam Negeri. During this period I had only marginal 1 Henley 2004; Lewis 2010.\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\ncontact with Catholics in the country. It was not until the mid-1990s that I started the preparation of this work from a position at iimo, the ecumenical and missiological institute of Utrecht University.2 The first intended public for this series of publications were international specialists in Indonesia who had little knowledge of the Catholic Church as a whole, and were not familiar with the condition and history of Indonesian Catholics. It is not written from the circle of people who define the ‘mission and vision’ of the Catholic Church in Indonesia, but by an outside observer who spent most of his active career in Indonesia as a lecturer in Islamic institutions. Therefore, I feel obliged to explain quite a few aspects of the organisation and practice of the Catholic Church as an international organisation. From my own background I had enough knowledge, sympathy, and empathy with the Catholic community to undertake this work. Another group that I hope to serve with this publication is people interested in Catholic history, but who have little knowledge of Indonesian geography, history, and politics, as well as the immense variety of its cultures. Therefore the regional chapters have much explanation about these geographical differences. This is, however, also a methodological principle: a community always has to adapt to its socio-cultural position. This focus on international interest for Indonesian Catholicism has also influenced the composition of the series of documents, published as an appendix to his book. Different from the first two volumes, in this volume there was in the selection a preference for sources written in English. Still, after some hesitation, I followed the procedure of the two previous volumes to publish the documents in their original language, although for a good number English translations were already prepared.3 The reader will notice that quite a few sections of this book are written from quite concrete anecdotes, often descriptions of conflicts among the Catholics, clergy, and lay people. It is not a dogmatic philosophical viewpoint that conflict or war is the beginning of everything, polemos panton pater, but it is still my conviction that change often involves differences of opinion. After all, writing history is often a description of developments and therefore we have to look in a realistic way to the conflicts that often accompany these developments. Besides, history should not only concentrate on overall national or provincial development, but switch between micro, meso and macro levels. Some small anecdotes from my personal experience are inserted in various places, and sometimes quite far-reaching conclusions are connected to little incidents: this is done in order to make the book more a living experience, and also to avoid it becoming an institutional history. While doing research for this 2 For a description of this background Bakker 2006.\n\nPreface\n\nxi\n\nvolume it struck me how many aspects of modern Indonesian life are visible here. Catholic life is much more than the content of the catechism or the doctrinal teachings of the church. While writing this volume I saw a sequence in images of Catholicism that best can be described through three quotations, representing three periods. First there is the uncertain period after the collapse of Dutch colonialism and of the Japanese interregnum, even continuing until the end of the Sukarno regime. In 1947 the Central Mission Office in Jakarta thought or hoped that it would have some influence in the formulation of the new constitution for Indonesia. It wanted a guarantee for freedom of religion in the broadest sense of the word, including freedom for missionary work and explicitly for conversion to a new religion. It also wanted a continuation of the freedom of denominational education and full government subsidies for this education. Watching the Muslim institutions in the field of marriage, it even requested that the Catholic clergy should receive the same rights and recognition as the Muslim officials. If officials of one specific religion, like in the case of Islam, continue to enjoy the authority of officiating marriages, this should also be given to officials of another religion, like Christians. … It is good to take the request into consideration that in general all marriages that are celebrated according to religious prescripts should be acknowledged by law at the same level as civil marriages.4 Second, in contrast to the rather faint-hearted ‘Minimal Requests’ by the Dutch missionaries in 1947, there is the self-confident and even quite aggressive participation of Catholic students under Cosmas Batubara in the demonstrations of October 1965 that toppled the first President, Sukarno. Together with Muslim youth leader Firdous Wadjidi, Cosmas Batubara was a decisive leader of kami, the ‘Unity for Action’ of the Indonesian Students, which started on 3 October 1965 at Jalan Ratulangi 8, the centre for Catholic students in the Menteng district of Jakarta.5 The Jesuit priest Joop Beek, who as a student moderator had trained and stimulated the Catholic students to fight Communism with good 3 These are the documents 1954, 1969, 1974, 1979, 1983, and 1993. These will placed in English translation on the weblog http://relindonesia.blogspot.com. 4 Centraal Missie Bureau 1947:140–141. Cf also the outspoken proposal for the permit for missionary work and conversion in the draft of the Constitution of the State of East Indonesia, also discussed in Chr. de Jong 1994. More on this issue in Chapter 1. 5 Giebels 2001:451.\n\nxii\n\nPreface Preface\n\ninformation, a strong and effective strategy and, above all, with a great sentiment of unity, later was quoted by an admirer: The most important quality of an activist is the mental preparation and ability. We must be careful that we do not behave like careless people who just follow others, seeking only safety, an easy life or giving in to incompetence. Such people are very dangerous, especially in complicated situations, because they have no solid principles from which they can handle matters other than just their own safety.6 This is a witness of the generation of 1965 and the following years: proud, even angry, responsive and keen Catholics who wanted to play a role in the construction of a new Indonesia. They were sure that they were in the position to do this. This was said at the start of a new period of massive conversions. In the 1920s and 1930s it was the schools that attracted many converts in the Catholic areas like Flores, Central Timor, and Papua. Also in regions like Minahasa and Central Java there was in these decades a modest growth of the Catholic community thanks to the attractive Catholic schools. Now, between 1965 and 1975 it was the general political situation that urged the choice for a world religion. Because of its lenient position towards individual ex-Communists, the Catholics were often chosen. The choices made in this period in general were continued in the next decades. Third, in the 1990s there was a revival of the public presence of Islam. There were fewer opportunities for Christians in public positions. After the fall of Soeharto in 1998 there was even a growing call for the implementation of shariʾa rules in society. Starting in the 1970s the large number of primary and secondary Catholic schools was reduced, because the government had started a great programme for public schools and the Catholic community was not able to finance all their schools. Since then the Catholics more and more put the own parish and liturgical celebrations at the heart of their life as Catholics. Dr Kees de Jong wrote an observation of his presence at Easter 2011 in Yogyakarta: Last night we went to the Easter Vigils of 8.30 pm. In Saint Anthony’s in Yogyakarta the vigils are celebrated three times, because of the vast number of attendants. On common Sundays they have eight Masses with a total of 10,000 faithful. The street next to the church has been turned into an extension of the church through tents and chairs, just like the public square in front of the church. We attended a very moving celebration, 6 Quoted in Soedarmanta 2008:199.\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nstarting with the well known readings about the creation, the exodus from Egypt. There was the blessing of the new fire and the Paschal candle was lit. After the Paschal candle was put on the altar, a Javanese dance was performed, encircling the new light, the risen Christ who disperses darkness. Thereafter was a reading from Ezekiel, followed by another dance when the water was brought to be blessed. After the renewal of the baptismal vows (with the concrete Indonesian condition of a renunciation of gambling and drinking alcohol) water was sprinkled over us and the resurrection story was read from Luke. After a short sermon the gifts (candles, bread and wine, the money of the collection) were brought to the altar with another Javanese dance. During the service there were many hymns, sung by the community and by a choir of the Catholic Sanata Dharma University. Saint Anthony’s is a kind of a city church where many students come to Mass. Their choir sung the famous Hallelujah by Handel as the conclusion of a service of 2.5 hours that was never boring and very inspiring.7 This individual description has been included here to describe the vibrant Catholic community, not inspired by the political activism of the mid 1960s per se, but more concentrated on the inner life of a small minority, living in a diaspora within a majority Muslim society. This selection of three symbolic events is taken from the island of Java. There is a good reason to do so: Indonesian politics and culture were defined in the capital, and in the island of Java. There were independent developments in the Outer Islands, but the guiding society was the Javanese. As to the debate about the constitution, we could have referred also to the East Indonesian State, where in 1949 the draft for a constitution was formed. We will discuss this in Chapters 1 and 8 and there it will become clear that the Javanese development was the decisive one. The Catholic students protesting in 1965–1966 against Sukarno in Jakarta were instrumental in his fall. Also in other places we saw this vigorous anti-Communist spirit, in a co-operation between Christians and Muslims. A turning point here was the 1 October 1967 Affair of Makassar, which caused a split between the Christian and the Muslim students. As to the third symbolic description, the Easter Vigil, the reader is referred to the more traditional Good Friday procession and ceremony of Larantuka, as described in Chapter 8. We have not tried to present a complete, more or less encyclopaedic overview of the Indonesian Catholics. The various regions are too different; 7 Dr Kees de Jong, letter Yogyakarta 24 April 2011.\n\nxiv\n\nPreface Preface\n\nthe number of special and exceptional people involved are too many. When possible we opted for a beginning or a conflict rather than a continuation of existing developments and strategies. Exceptional local developments received more attention than changes that are general for the Catholic Church as a whole. Many people were helpful in completing this task. Rini Hogewoning, Josephine Schrama, and other staff at kitlv in Leiden were generous in their help for the use of this incredibly complete library. Staff of kdc in Nijmegen, Ellen Brok and Lennie van Orsouw, were helpful in facilitating my listening to the kmm interviews. Joop Vernooij and Jan Willemsen in Nijmegen also helped to use the facilities here. Brother Peter van de Wiel helped with the svd Archives in Teteringen. With his usual frankness the late Bishop Martinus Muskens gave confidential information and practical help. Mrs Ingrid van der Heide proved to be a kind successor to Father Ambrosius in the Den Bosch, Capuchin Archives. For the living Capuchin mission Dr Huub Boelaars gave good advice. Frans Turkenburg fic (Brothers of Maastricht) and the founder, Cor Rademaker sscc, kindly gave permission to use their archives in Sint Agatha. Most helpful in that historical building with the rich collection from the various religious orders was Mrs Olga Minkema. Father Piet Derckx smm was liberal with information about the delicate history of the Montfortan Congregation in Indonesia. The Utrecht Archief was very generous in accessing the archives for the Franciscans in Java and Papua. Thom van den End kept my mind open for the Protestants in Indonesia. I thank here Dr Georg Kirchberger svd in Ledalero for publishing the Indonesian translation of the first two volumes. Bona Beding in Jakarta was helpful in organising the 2006 trip for advertising these volumes. Jan Aritonang remained keen on following the writing of this more Catholic book than on the ecumenical one we published together. In Yogyakarta I thank Kees de Jong for sending books, dvds, and other material. Further colleagues in Yogyakarta were the Jesuits Budi Subanar and Bernard Kieser. John Prior svd, travelling all around the world, always kept contact, mostly from Ledalero. I am indebted to Brigitte Renyaan and Francesco Moens, both pbhk sisters in Ambon, also to Adolf Heuken sj, Yong Ohoitimur msc, Neles Tebay, Rai Sudiarsa svd, Greg Soetomo sj. In their own style it was Alef Theria Wasim, Burhanuddin Daya, and Abdurrahman in Yogyakarta, Husni Rahiem, Aziz Dahlan, and Salman Harun in Jakarta who always reminded me of the perspectives of Muslims in Indonesia. My wife, Paule Maas travelled all the way with me, held me back from unsubstantiated or reckless theories and always remembered lost names and publications. My best and most accurate reader was Simon Rae in Dunedin, New Zealand (for some time again in Yogyakarta), who corrected not only the\n\nxv\n\nPreface\n\nEnglish, but reminded me of things forgotten. To all, and also to all readers, I am very indebted. I am sure that several of those mentioned above will disagree with some of my conclusions or with my selection and presentation of facts. They will want to join the debate about these differences of opinion and agree with me that the Catholic community of Indonesia is a vivid and varied local group of believers.

Despite an official policy of separation of government administration and religion, the two became more and more intertwined, mostly because of the involvement of religion in the last phase of the colonial project, officially considered as a programme of development and emancipation. Christian mission contributed more and more to education and health care, and Muslim activism was quite important at the beginning of nationalism. Against the spirit of colonial strategies of separation of state and religion, there was an increase in the social relevance of religion. We will see that for very different reasons, a religious adherence became quite a strong identity marker in independent Indonesia as well. Besides age, gender and ethnic origin, religious adherence is not only a personal but also a public affair in modern Indonesia. This is seen in many practices of the public administration: without opting for a religion Indonesian citizens cannot obtain an identity card, passport or driver’s licence, because a religion has to be entered since the beginning of Soeharto’s New Order. This has consequences for many other public acts, and makes religion not only a private but also a public affair. In this first chapter we present a panorama of this public face of the Indonesian religions, especially looking through the spectacles of Catholic participants and observers. On the eve of the Pacific War, Christianity in Indonesia had consolidated its second period of expansion. The first period was between 1520–1670 in East Indonesia (especially the Moluccas and East Flores). The second period began in the 1830s when not only coffee but also Christianity was introduced in the Minahasa. In the 1930s the largest Protestant missionary communities were formally established as independent churches. This was the case with the Batak, Minahasan, East Javanese and Moluccan Protestant churches. Although all these churches already had fully ordained native ministers, the leadership of the synods was still entrusted to German or Dutch missionaries. The Catholics had their first indigenous bishop in 1940, Albertus Soegijopranoto of Semarang. The clergy, however was still for the larger part a European community and this would remain so until the early 1970s. There were in 1941 only 16 native Catholic priests (12 in Java) compared with 549 European priests. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2015 | doi 10.1163/9789004285422_002\n\n4\n\nchapter 1\n\nCatholics during the Japanese Occupation, 1942–1945\n\nThe Japanese administration of Indonesia took religion as an important issue in order to win the sympathy of the population. It gave ample facilities to Islamic institutions. Christianity was seen as the religion introduced and most often directed by the Dutch oppressor. Moreover, Islam was the religion of more than 80% of the population, while in 1942 Christianity reached only about 2.5%. Therefore the Japanese attitude was ambiguous towards Christianity. Dutch missionary personnel were in most cases interned, and initially buildings and other properties of the churches were confiscated, the schools closed or taken over by the new authority. The same was the case with the medical care organised by the Christian churches. In the second year of the Japanese rule there was a milder policy: the Japanese sent several Protestant ministers, some Catholics priests and even two Japanese Catholic bishops to Indonesia (especially to Minahasa and Flores). There were many local variations in this pattern. On the whole it has to be acknowledged that Christianity not only survived the Pacific War but indigenous leadership was given an opportunity to grow because of the absence of foreign missionaries. In education and medical care the Christian churches never regained the broad facilities and close cooperation with the state they had enjoyed before 1942.1 For the whole of Indonesia the Japanese period was seldom seen as a move towards independence and greater freedom. With the exception of Batakland, the indigenous Indonesians only reluctantly took over the positions of the foreign missionaries. The churches lost much of their solid foundation in society: their schools and sometimes also the hospitals. In 1943 the administration required that during church service the leader should read a message about the Greater Asia War, its causes and aims. Emperor worship also entered the church buildings, because in many places a Japanese flag was put inside the church building, on the wall facing Tokyo. Before the beginning of the service the assembled congregation were to face that wall and bow. Although it was officially stated that this was an act of respect and not of veneration or adoration, the Christian community had an uneasy feeling about it. Some people wanted to evade this ritual and decided not to go to church anymore. Another reason for a decrease in church attendance was the fact that many people had no decent clothes anymore. In regions like the Moluccas, festive black clothes were preserved for going to church on Sundays. Children could go to school naked, as happened in Sangir (the archipelago north of Sulawesi) towards the end of the war, but their parents did not wish them to 1 For this section see Steenbrink 2010a.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n5\n\nparticipate in the church service in such a condition. In the regional chapters (VIII until XV, part two) we will give some more details about the local developments of the Catholic communities under Japanese administration.\n\nThe Clash between Revolution and Restoration, 1945–1949\n\nTowards the end of the Pacific War, the Japanese administration started to give promises about independence of Indonesia. On 1 March 1945 they instituted a Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (Body for the Study of Activities leading towards Indonesian Independence), with middle-aged Javanese as members.2 There were several Protestant Christians, at least Alex Andries Maramis and J. Latuharhary, but no Catholics in this Body of 62 (later 68) members.3 This body held its first plenary session between 28 May and 1 June. The session was held in the former building of the Volksraad, since 1918 more or less functioning as a beginning of an Indonesian Parliament. There were fifteen members of Muslim organisations present and they asked for the institution of Indonesia as an Islamic State. On the last day of this first session Sukarno gave a moving speech in which he proposed that the new Indonesia should hold a position between a secular state and a state funded upon one religion alone. He formulated a doctrine of Five Pillars, Pancasila after a Sanskrit formula, where besides belief in the One Supreme Deity, other basic ideas would be those of nationalism, humanitarianism, democracy, and social justice. In its first formulation of 1 June 1945 the belief in the One Supreme Deity was the fifth and last pillar, but in the preamble to the constitution as presented on 18 August 1945 it was placed first.4 Sukarno’s speech was later published as Lahirnya Pancasila or ‘The Birth of Pancasila’. He stressed that he did not construct or invent the doctrine himself, but found it by looking into the soul of the Indonesian people. In various places Sukarno stressed that Pancasila should give freedom to the various religious communities. In his presentation of the pillar of democracy he elaborated:\n\n2 Ricklefs 1993:208; Benda 1958:184 and 284. 3 During the second Dutch military intervention the buildings of the Republic in Yogyakarta were set afire and all reports of these meetings were lost. Reconstructions of these developments were made after interviews and later information. 4 See among many others references to this ‘Birth of the Pancasila’, Boland 1971:21–22; Kahin 1952:122–127.\n\n6\n\nchapter 1\n\nIf we really are an Islamic people, let us work hard so that most of the seats in the people’s representative body we will create are occupied by Islamic delegates. …Within the people’s representative body, Muslims and Christians should work as if inspired. If, for instance, Christians wish every letter within the regulations of the state of Indonesia to accord with the Bible then let them work together to death in order that most of the delegates who enter the Indonesian representative body may be Christians. That is just – fair play! There is no state that can be called a living state if there is no internal struggle.5 On the theme of the belief in the One Supreme Deity also the religious variety of the country was stressed: Not only should the people of Indonesia have belief in God, but every Indonesian should believe in his own particular God. The Christian should worship God according to the teachings of Jesus Christ; Muslims according to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad; Buddhists should discharge their religious rites according to their own books. But let us all have believe in God. The Indonesian state shall be a state where every person can worship God in freedom…without ‘religious egoism’. And the State of Indonesia should be a State incorporating the belief in God. Let us observe, let us practice religion, whether Islam or Christianity, in a civilised way…the way of mutual respect.6 A committee of nine members was selected to formulate a further solution for the basis of the Indonesian state. In their meeting of 22 June 1945 they formulated a compromise, the so-called Piagam Jakarta or Jakarta Charter, to be used as a preamble to the future constitution (later the Arab word Muqaddimah was also used). It repeated the five pillars of Pancasila, but now with the belief in the One Supreme Deity in the first place. Most controversial was its addition of the seven words after Belief in the Deity: ‘with the obligation for adherents of Islam to practice Islamic law’ (dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluk-pemeluknya). It was a minimum result for some Muslims who asked for designation as an Islamic State or at least a Muslim President.7 5 After the translation of the Ministry of Information of the Indonesian Republic of 1950, as quoted in Kahin 1952:124. There are many publications of the Indonesian text, in special booklets and as part of other books on Pancasila. 6 Kahin 1952:125. 7 Boland 1971:23–26; Aritonang 2004:241–243.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n7\n\nOn 6 August 1945 a new body with more and broader representation was instituted, Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (Preparatory Committee for the Independence of Indonesia). This body had 25 members and held its first (and only) meeting on 18–22 August 1945. Muhammad Hatta relates that on the 17th August he had received a telephone call from the Japanese navy (in control of East Indonesia) that an officer wanted to see him immediately. This officer warned Hatta That the Protestants and Catholics in the regions that were under control of the Japanese navy had serious objections against the formula about ‘the obligation for adherents of Islam to practice Islamic law’. They recognised that this formula was not binding for them, but only for Muslims. But to include such a formula in a basic text as part of the Constitution would seriously discriminate them as a minority group. If this ‘discrimination’ would be prolonged, they would prefer to stay outside the Indonesian Republic.8 Hatta replied that on 22 June the only Christian in the small committee of nine, Maramis, had no problem with this formula. Nevertheless, on 18 August Hatta called the four most outspoken Muslims for a private meeting that lasted only some 15 minutes and they agreed to the removal of these seven words. This was later confirmed by the plenary session. Hatta adds here that this legal difference was mostly relevant for family law, because in other fields there were no specific rules to be applied.9 The Preparatory Committee voted on 19 August against the erection of the Ministry of Religion (15 against with only 6 members in favour after fierce opposition by Protestant member Latuharhary). With this decision the three basic ideological debates had found their direction: about Pancasila (versus an ‘Islamic State’), the Jakarta Charter (versus implementation of shariʾa rules) and about the Ministry of Religion. About these issues the debates would continue and also within the Catholic community positions would vary over the period. As to the Ministry of Religion, a further development took place on 3rd January 1946 when a decision of the still very powerful President Sukarno decided that it should be erected with Haji Muhammad Rasjidi as its first functionary. On the last day of their meeting, 22 August, the Preparatory Committee considered its duty as fulfilled. It installed a third council knip, Komite Nasional Indonesia Pusat, a provisional kind of parliament that counted some 8 Hatta 1982:58. 9 Hatta 1982:60–61.\n\n8\n\nchapter 1\n\n135 members. Ignacius Kasimo, the most prominent Catholic politician of the colonial period, was nominated a member of knip on 27 August.10 On 3 November Protestant nationalists came together in Jakarta to start a Christian Political Party. Two Catholics were present, Suradi and Hadi. They wanted to consult their bishops before taking a decision about the possibility of joining forces with the Protestants.11 On 11 November the (Protestant) National Christian Party (pkn, Partai Kristen Nasional) was established, while on 8 December 1945 the Partai Katholik Republik Indonesia was started with Kasimo as elected chairman.12 The pkri was from the beginning not only in its name but also in its political goal a firm supporter of the independent republic. As in the pre-independence period, the ‘white’ and Eurasian Catholics of the former colony had a very different political agenda. The former chairman of the late 1930s, Piet Kerstens, no longer was its leader, but his rival, G. Pastor (1892–1948) revived in a modest way the Indische Katholieke Volkspartij, that was re-erected on 15 September 1946.13 The ikvp rejected any compromise with the nationalist fraction and even did not agree with the Dutch Catholic Party about the Linggajati agreement of 15 November 1946 that promised a future Federal State of Indonesia under the Dutch Queen and under supervision of Dutch leadership. At a third conference about the possibility of the creation of a (semi)independent State of West Java (Pasundan), Pastor was invited to represent the European Catholics.14 This initiative, however, had no basis in the local population of this region. Not only in Java were there initiatives to start Catholic political parties. Similar small parties were started in Makassar (Partai Katolik Rakjat Indonesia), Larantuka (Perpokaf, Persatuan Politik Katolik Flores) and Manado (Pendirian Masjarakat Katolik).15 The most significant of these local political initiatives was the contribution given by the Catholics of Flores towards the establishment of the State of East Indonesia. While the Dutch never could return to their former power in Java and Sumatra and in fact only able to execute control over several major cities, already in December 1945 the nica forces (Netherlands Indies Civil Administration, mostly British and Australian) could take control 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nBank 1983:119, based upon an interview with Kasimo.

Among the representatives who attended the constitutional meeting for the new state in November 1946, three Catholics represented Flores: besides indigenous svd Priest Adrianus Conterius there was a Dutch svd Priest, Dr Jan Raats, a specialist in canon law, who drafted the constitution for nit together with the Balinese chairman of the provisional nit parliament, Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung. The third representative of Flores was Louis E. Monteiro, alumnus of the teacher training school. Timor was represented by two Protestants (a teacher and a minister) and by the first priest from the island ordained in 1942, Gabriel Manek svd, from 1951 bishop of Larantuka and after 1961 archbishop of Ende.16 There was quite a pragmatic anti-Javanese feeling mixed with their support for the partial autonomy of an Eastern Indonesian State. This did not diminish the sympathy of the people of Flores towards Sukarno who stayed in exile in Ende between 1935 and 1938 and had developed a good relationship with the Catholic missionaries and the community. However, when the State of East Indonesia dissolved itself and became a full member of the new Indonesian Republic in early 1950, Father Raats had to leave the country as someone too strongly promoting the division of Indonesia. Since that time he worked in the Philippines and could never again return to Indonesian.17 In 1949 the parliament of the State of East Indonesia (nit, Negara Indonesia Timur) designed its draft of a Constitution, as already mentioned above. Its status is not really clear, because there was a vision that nit would become part of a federal state of Indonesia soon. The text is much longer than the short Constitution for Indonesia as prepared by the Body for the Study of Activities leading towards Indonesian Independence at the central level. It was drafted in Dutch with quite a few Dutch officials working on the text besides a number of Indonesians. In its preamble and the 148 articles of the full text, Pancasila never was mentioned as the basis of the Indonesian state. However, in the preamble it is mentioned with clear words that God and religion are important aspects of this state: ‘The State recognises and honours the fact that in the State of East Indonesia the concept of God and religion are very special pillars for society and for the individual lives of the citizens’.18 Chapter VII of this 16 17 18\n\nFor these representations Gde Agung 1985:801.

Staatsregeling 1949: Preamble.\n\n10\n\nchapter 1\n\nConstitution has six articles about religion (articles 133–139). In article 134 freedom of religion is defined in a very broad sense as the freedom to practice one’s religion, to educate children in the faith of their parents, freedom to change one’s religion, to preach and disseminate one’s religion, the freedom to start religious organisations, to acquire possessions for these purposes and to act according to religious ideals.19 Articles 142–144 of this constitution contain under the chapter on education outspoken rules about the position of religious education that must be given according to the religion of the parents. Private schools can be subsidised by the government and in this case the freedom in religious orientation should be guaranteed also in the choice of teaching material and the appointment of teaching staff. On the national level the difference between bishops Soegijapranata of Semarang and Willekens of Jakarta was quite significant. Semarang remained part of the Republic until mid-1946, because the Dutch and their allies gave priority to bigger cities like Surabaya, Jakarta and Bandung. From the very beginning of the Indonesian revolution, Soegijapranata without any doubt showed that he accepted the independent Republic as a political fact, although realising that there should be separation between religion and politics. In some respect he took over the role of the Apostolic Vicar of Batavia as the main spokesman between church and this new government. Later he formulated in a letter to a fellow Jesuit two motives for this attitude. First, he wanted to provide also some spiritual direction to a young nation that was still looking for its ideological orientation. Second, he wanted to eliminate the reproach that the Catholic community was a creation of colonialism and continued to protect its promoter.20 When Semarang began to be occupied by the Dutch forces in early 1947, Soegijapranata moved to Yogyakarta, the centre of the Republican administration. There he stayed until early August 1949. Willekens from his side took a formal attitude of neutrality, but he did not speak Javanese and his command of Malay was quite poor. He had few 19\n\n20\n\n‘Het recht op vrijheid van godsdienst wordt begrepen als vrijheid voor een ieder tot het verrichten van eredienst overeenkomstig zijn geweten en tot het opvoeden van de kinderen in het geloof van hun ouders; als vrijheid voor een ieder om van godsdienstige belijdenis te veranderen; als vrijheid om te prediken, te onderrichten te publicer­en en missionaire werkzaamheden te verrichten; als vrijheid om organisaties te stichten en naar eigen inzicht in te richten en bezittingen te verwerven en te hebben voor de vervulling van deze doeleinden; alsmede als vrijheid tot het verrichten van al die handelingen, welke aan zijn godsdienst inhaerent zijn.’ Staatsregeling 1949:article 134.

In contact with advisors in the Netherlands he proposed a series of ‘minimal requests’ in a document that was discussed since early 1947 among Dutch and Indonesian clergy and finally published in Dutch on 23 April 1948. It was in fact not more than a sometimes quite unrealistic shopping list for the wrong mall! Moreover, Willekens (1881–1971) was in poor health and had to take European leave between July 1947 and August 1948. The Central Mission Office in Jakarta formulated in 1948 the Minimum Program with articles on freedom of religion, education and some basic requirements for social institutions and health care.22 Like the later formulations of the Constitution of the nit, here also freedom of religion is expressly seen as freedom to propagate a religion and to change one’s religion. Financial support by the state for all religions should be on the basis of mutual equality. The list of requirements has a quite long passage about the public recognition of marriage by religious officials. In the colonial time all Muslim marriages were per se recognised by the public administration, but Christians should celebrate a civil marriage before a religious ceremony could be held. Now it was suggested that it must be considered that also Christian marriages could be recognised by the state. In this case appointed leaders of the Christian churches should receive the same privileges as their Muslim ‘colleagues’. This wish was implemented with the 1974 Marriage Law of the Indonesian Republic.23 The Independence of Indonesia did not come without heavy fighting and much blood. From September 1945 onwards the Australian and British allied forces took over authority from the Japanese and they hesitated to take the new Indonesian Republic seriously, but were also not fully in favour of a return of Dutch colonialism. The Dutch started to send many troops from the end of 21 22\n\n23\n\nA well documented and balanced contrast between Soegijapranata and Willekens in Van Klinken 2003:175–187. The Central Mission Office in Jakarta was then already established at the place where now the national office of the Indonesian Bishops has its place. At that time it was the street named after Van Heutz, the general who was successful in subduing Aceh. After 1950 it was renamed Jalan Cut Mutia in honour of an Acehnese freedom fighter who led the revolt in her region after the death of her husband. In 1910 she was killed in action and since then has been seen of one of a series of female fighters against colonialism. Centraal Missie Bureau 1947:141–142.

They were quite successful in East Indonesia, but less so in Java and Sumatra. There was also international pressure suggesting that the heyday of colonialism was over and this resulted in the Linggajati Agreement between the Dutch administration and the revolutionary Republicans of November 1946. Reluctance from the side of the Dutch to accept this agreement as a major step towards Indonesian independence resulted in ‘police actions’ or politionele acties, (in fact aggressive colonial warfare) in July 1947 and December 1948, both times halted because of international protests. The independent Indonesian Republic was much more successful at the negotiation tables of the United Nations in New York than on the battle fields. There was an Islamic sentiment in the struggle for independence too. Several nationalist militia used Islamic names, like the Barisan Hizbullah, set up under Japanese supervision and support in late 1944 as an armed youth wing of the Islamic Masyumi organisation. Another was the Barisan Sabilillah, a loose group of Islamic forces under the leadership of local religious teachers, mostly in East Java.24 On 1 November 1945 hard-line nationalists attacked the church and parish of Magelan and killed deliberately eight Jesuits, among them two Javanese Jesuits, while the others were Dutch. On 19 December 1948 a Javanese diocesan priest of Muntilan, Richardus Kardis Sandjaja, and a Jesuit student of theology, Herman Bouwens, were lured to a meeting in the local mosque, but were shot to death by Hizbullah members.25 These tragedies were exceptions. Especially the position of Christians in the guerrilla army, as well as the high position of Kasimo in the government of the Republic (since early 1947 in various ministerial positions, and in December 1948 as one of the five ministers who was not taken prisoner by the Dutch army, but coordinating the guerrilla war), was of good help to secure the social position of the Catholics in Java. On 17 August 1947, celebrating two years of declaration of independence, Kasimo published a pamphlet ‘The Foundations of our Struggle’ where he stated that the Republic of Indonesia de facto and de jure was accepted by its own population as well as in many sections of the international diplomatic world.26 There were few open conflicts among Catholics who were pro or contra independence. The contacts between European, Eurasian, and native Indonesians were not frequent enough for such conflict, while Catholics of Chinese offspring mostly kept out of politics. There is one quite curious story of the Javanese Jesuit priest Soetapanitra who in May 1947 went to Medan and 24 25 26\n\nVan Dijk 1981:76. Muskens (ed) 1973–74:IIIB, 891–892.

He had quite strenuous relations with the only other priests in the region: Dutch army chaplains serving the returning Dutch power. They disliked the outspoken pro-independence attitudes of their Javanese colleague. In July 1948 another Javanese priest arrived in Medan, A.N. Poedjahandaja. Finally the region of Medan was returned to the Dutch Capuchin Friars in late 1949.27\n\nUnder the Umbrella of Pancasila Nationalism, 1950–1965\n\nThe loosely organised Federal Indonesia that was the result of the negotiations with the Dutch in December 1949, turned into a unified state in the first months of 1950, but there were several serious revolts, due to religious and ethnic differences. In West Java and South Sulawesi Islamic revolts fought against the unified Republic until 1962. The West Sumatra revolt known as prri and the North Sulawesi Permesta movements (1950–57) basically were protests against the Javanese/Jakarta domination of the republic in the so-called Outer Islands (with more plantations and mining activities) and were religiously neutral as Muslims and Christians alike joined these movements. The Ambonese attempt to erect a small independent Republic of the South Moluccas (rms, Republik Maluku Selatan) was also meant as a religiously neutral rebellion, but by its opponents it was nicknamed Republik Maluku Serani, or the Christian Moluccan Republic. Its founders were more than 90% Protestants. They certainly had, among other motives, a fear of Muslim domination of their region along with some messianic dreams. There were no specific revolts where outspoken Catholics were involved. In Flores and associated islands, the nine traditional leaders (six Catholic and three Muslim raja) joined the attempt to start a State of East Indonesia, by erecting a council (Flores Federasi) with the Catholic Don J. Thomas Ximenes da Silva of Sikka (1895–1954) as their chairman. But they consented in the termination of the State of East Indonesia.28 On the national level the Pancasila ideology remained intact as the basis for the position of religion in the Indonesian Republic. However, religion was never the single, major issue in the political debate of the period until 1965. Until 1955 the knip functioned as a provisional parliament.

The three great blocks were Nationalists (22.3%), two Muslim parties (39.3%) and Communists (16.4%). Protestants received 2.6% of the votes and 8 seats, the Catholics 2.0% and 6 seats for this first elected parliament. No agreement about the basis of the state was reached between Muslim parties supporting Islam and other parties which were in favour of Pancasila. On 5 July 1959 Sukarno dissolved the first Constituent Assembly and replaced it with a parliament where members of political parties had a position besides members of ‘functional groups’ like fishermen, religious people, medical doctors. In this period Sukarno coined a large number of new ideological formulas. The most important was the combination of Nationalism, Religion, and Com­ munism in Nasakom (with Nasionalisme, Agama or religion and Komunisme as basic pillars to be united). In 1959 he also published a Political Manifest, Manipol, with five new elements, 1. the constitution of 1945; 2. Indonesian socialism; 3. Guided Democracy; 4. Guided Economy; 5. Indonesian identity. In the period 1959–1965 Sukarno switched several times in his main accent as to ideologies. A formidable orator, he could deliver very long speeches that were broadcasted on the national radio and received much attention. In schools these ideological elements were taught as civics. In this period the ideological element in the national politics paid much attention to a possible harmony between nationalism and socialism/communism and the religious content of Pancasila was not further developed.30 Among Catholics, however, Pancasila remained a very important idea. It remained the sole rock in this quite uncertain period, when the Catholic community, still very much under Dutch leadership, had to experience the ban on the Dutch language in education and later even in public conversation, the ban on the arrival of more mission personnel from the Netherlands. The verbal (1953–58) and physical war for the integration of West Papua into Indonesian territory (1960–61) was also a clash with the Dutch, the former coloniser. In general there were only a few personal attacks on Dutch missionaries, priests, lay brothers and sisters. However, in this period Catholics were already glad when they could defend their position in the new nation. There was little, if any, increase in the numbers of believers, or in the traditional manifestations of the Catholics, churches, schools, and hospitals. The Indonesian Catholics were conscious of the power of Communism in East Asia, especially in China 29 30\n\nBank 1983:347. Steenbrink 1990:125–126.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n15\n\nand Vietnam, with strong support also in Cambodia and Malaysia. They decided in the early 1960s to reject firmly Communist doctrine, but at the same time to seek practical solutions to continue their work in Indonesia. At a Catholic Social Conference in Hongkong Bishop Nicolas Geise of Bogor had said that the Catholics of Indonesia ‘should try to cooperate with the Communists in an Indonesian way’.31 Quite many Catholic clergy found this position too lenient, although they could not openly criticise Sukarno for his coalition with Communists. During the period 1920–1940 a quite tight network of Catholic organisations had been established among the European and Eurasian Catholics in the major towns of Java. For youth, young adults, women, workers, political and social activists all kind of Catholic organisations had started. This was much less developed among the Chinese and Javanese believers.32 This system also was not applied or effective among the Indonesian Catholics after independence. However, a group of Catholic lay people in Semarang started on 19 June 1954 a union for farmers and another organisation for factory workers. This was not seen as an exclusive Catholic union, but rather a religiously neutral union to strengthen the economy of poor farmers and factory workers. Pancasila became the umbrella and the official name for these unions. Only Communists were excluded from membership. Later similar organisations for fishermen and other occupations were started. The goal of the Pancasila Unions was seen in the similarities between Pancasila ideology and the social doctrine of the Catholic Church as formulated in the encyclicals of the popes, especially Rerum Novarum (1891) and Quadragesimo Anno (1931). This Catholic doctrine opposed the Communist division of society into capitalist versus proletariat and promoted a harmony of social groups cooperating in society, as was later the ideology of golkar (the political motor of the New Order of Soeharto between 1965–98) or the division of society in functional groups. During the second Congress of the Catholic Community of the Whole of Indonesia (kuksi, Semarang, 27–30 December 1954), the diocese of Semarang strongly promoted the idea of the Pancasila Unions to people from other regions. They were quite a success: in the early 1960s they claimed even some two million members, most of them non-Catholics. Different from the Protestant Churches that were mostly regional communities, restricted to one ethnic group, the Catholics had a solid nationwide network and could therefore lead a broader group of trade unions. The practical realisation of activities, however, was often restricted to the quite autonomous dioceses. The Pancasila 31 Muskens, Diary, IIIb:15v, 9 November 1967. 32 Steenbrink 2007:27–75.\n\n16\n\nchapter 1\n\nUnions never could reach the popularity of the sobsi, the Communist trade union with probably tens of millions of members. In the early years of the New Order of Soeharto (1973) all trade unions were dissolved and social activities were started as temporary projects and initiatives in the way of ngos.33 The most impressive formulation of Catholic thinking about Pancasila was without doubt the speech given in 1959 by Jesuit priest and philosopher Nicolaus Drijarkara (1913–1967). Drijarkara had been among the second generation of students in Muntilan, arriving shortly after the death of its founder Father Van Lith in 1926. Drijarkara studied later at the major seminary of Yogyakarta and at the Jesuit Gregoriana University in Rome, where he obtained a doctoral degree in philosophy with a dissertation on the French priest-philosopher Malebranche. Drijarkara is best known in Yogyakarta where he was the founder and first rector of the Teacher Training College Sanata Dharma (now a Catholic University). Although his dissertation was about the character of the divinity and so on the boundary between theology and philosophy, he refrained from writings about religion. He concentrated more on philosophy of culture, also labelled contextual theology.34 In February 1959 a society for the promotion of Pancasila held a five-day seminar in Yogyakarta on the subject, where also President Sukarno was present. Drijarkara delivered a major speech, that later also was published in English translation by the Ministry of Information. Its beginning sounds more or less like a confession of faith about the basis of the Indonesia Republic, or rather something like fides quaerens intellectum, a belief that seeks rational arguments: Here in this seminar, we are meditating in common about Pancasila. To ponder over Pancasila does not mean at all that we hold doubts about the position of Pancasila in the way of life of the Indonesia Nation. We are convinced that in Pancasila we have the best possible basis for our State. But if we are already convinced that these Principles of ours are correct, why do we hold a seminar about them? Does this not jeopardise them? To this objection we reply firmly that it is precisely this deep conviction of ours which causes us to think more deeply about those Principles, as we are doing now. Whoever possesses the truth will never fear that his truth will be shaken because he thinks about it; through thinking over the grounds, position and justification for that truth, and through more deeply understanding it, we will in future be the more 33 34\n\nSubanar 2001:215–216; Muskens 1969: 412–418.

This is the case with all fundamental truths. It is the case also with our Pancasila.35 Drijarkara started the discussion of the subject matter of Pancasila with a quite philosophical question, formulated in German: Was ist der Mensch and was ist seine Stellung im Sein? (What is man and what is his/her position in Being?) Here, Drijarkara develops a description of human beings as socially active and part of society with an ultimate goal of (again in German) das liebende Mit-sein (togetherness in love).36 In this way Drijarkara praises Sukarno where he summarised the Pancasila doctrine as gotong-royong or the mutual help in a traditional society. For the transcendental aspect of human being, Drijarkara extensively quoted from an analysis of Javanese Islamic poetry as published by his fellow Jesuit Piet Zoetmulder. Religion is a gift from God, but man is an ‘impulse towards religion’ (this in contrast to Orthodox Protestantism that stated that man is a sinner without the possibility of reaching and longing towards God). He puts the theoretical problem about ‘someone with the Pancasila attitude but living outside Religion: is this not in conflict?’ Drijarkara here answers that this is never a reality because we do never live in a social vacuum. And all Indonesians live in a religious society or group. Religion, however, should develop without control from the state and enjoy full freedom in its own field.37 At the end of this conference Sukarno announced that he would dissolve the Congress that was called to discuss the basis of the Indonesia State and execute full power as a President, but on the basis of Pancasila. Drijarkara’s elaboration of the meaning of Pancasila in this way received special attention, although it is in fact just one among hundreds, probably even thousands of books, pamphlets, and articles written by Catholic intellectuals about the idea of Pancasila.\n\nUnder the Umbrella of Pancasila as Anti-Communism, 1965–1985\n\nOn 30 September 1965 a military coup, inspired by leftist troops in the air force, directed at a Communist take-over of the country, failed.

In his first period Pancasila was more and more developed as a political ideology. It was not nationalism or democracy, or the other pillars, but very much the belief in One High Deity, understood as membership of a monotheist religion, that became one of the cornerstones of the anti-Communist ideology of Soeharto’s New Order. Communists were in the first place reduced to the simple label of ‘atheists’. In the 1980s 1 October was instituted as a national commemoration under the name Hari Kesaktian Pancasila or ‘Day of the Invulnerability of Pancasila’. In the aftermath of the coup that had failed, a cooperation between Muslim and Catholic students was quite important, although the cooperation did not last more than one year. On 1 October 1965 Nahdlatul Ulama youth leader Subchan ze addressed the Jakarta Army Commander Umar Wirahadikusuma to propose a Muslim Action Command against the Communists. The army commander proposed inclusion of Catholic activists and this lead to kami, Kesatuan Aksi Mahasiswa Indonesia (United Action of Indonesian Students), with the mixed Chinese-Indonesian Harry Tjan Silalahi and the Catholic Batak activist Cosmas Batubara as prominent leaders. The majority of the leadership was with young Nahdlatul Ulama and most of all Muslim students that were member of hmi, Himpunan Mahasiswa Islam. kami demonstrated in Jakarta until the Communist party and all its mass organisations were banned on 12 March 1966. Catholic influence was most visible in the kami actions. There was a parallel endeavour among teachers, kagi (Kesatuan Aksi Guru Indonesia, Joint Action of Indonesian Teachers), but it was in fact dominated by Muslims and Catholics, while Protestants had not much influence. The Catholics had already started their own union, pgk (Persatuan Guru Katolik, Union of Catholic Teachers), in 1952, but it was more or less neglected by the union that was started within the Ministry of Education pgri, Persatuan Guru Republik Indonesia. Only on a local level could the pgk do some of its lobby work with local officials. In the first years after 1965 they tried in vain also to have some influence in kagi, which was not so powerful in the political arena as kami.38 Among the advisors to the kami students was the Jesuit Priest Joop Beek (1917–1983) who had been one of the founders of the student hostel Realino in Yogyakarta, 1955–59, as a place where quite a few prominent Muslim leaders of the 1960s and 1970s had intense contact with Catholic students and clergy. Among these was Ahmad Wahib who wrote a diary that gives a lively picture of 38 Muskens, Diary 139v (14 August 1967).\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n19\n\nthe intellectual debates among Catholic and Muslim students of the period.39 In 1959 Beek moved to Jakarta to become national leader of the Mary’s Sodality, directed towards youth and young adults. He developed this quite pious and apolitical movement into a pastoral and political training circuit, called Khasebul, Khalwat Satu Bulan, a retreat of one month. Until 1975 the name Kasebul was used, after kaderisasi sebulan. Beek used for this purpose the Catholic Training Centre in Klender, Jakarta, with some 72 rooms for 144 participants. It was ready for use in 1967.40 Initially Beek’s initiative was against Communism as the greatest enemy of Catholics in Indonesia, but gradually he moved more and more to identify Islam as the other dangerous party.41 The graduates of Kasebul/Khasebul would form militant cells that were trained to identify the special character and the danger of the enemies and to counteract their strategies, even apply methods to sabotage a meeting, how to slander the enemy and to spread lies. There were elements taken from the Jesuit retreat of 30 days, also from the cell doctrine of Belgian Cardinal Jozef Cardijn and his Young Christian Workers, since 1924. The candidates of Khasebul received a harsh physical and mental training, but the result was often a very personal dedication to Father Beek and it resulted in a cadre completely faithful to Beek personally. They became Beek’s men for life, who would do anything for him. Besides training in Klender, the participants also did field work in villages. Their main goal was the mapping of opponents: making lists of Communist and later mostly Muslim and Nationalist leaders and their network.42 Between 1971 and 1973 the work of Beek was halted by order of the Jesuit General Superior, because of complaints by fellow Jesuits.43 Khasebul was continued until the first decade of the twenty-first century, but more or less as a secret organisation, or rather a dynamic and spirited, very confident outspoken Catholic network.44 There were and are still quite a few rumours and strong stories about Father Beek. Dutch anthropologist Saskia Wieringa made him the inventor of the sexual play of (Communist) women at the murder of the generals on 39 40 41\n\nSoedarmanta 2008:98–117; Wahib 1981.

Besides retreats and conferences, its main purpose was to become an ‘indoctrination centre for Catholics, to use the current terminology of the country’.

She introduces Beek under the name of Bron (which means source, while Beek means rivulet in Dutch). She turns him with Z.E. Subchan into the real figures behind the rise of General Soeharto. ‘Father Bron/Beek and Subchan played the role of God himself. They were convinced that the Supreme Being had made a mistake by allowing the Communists in their playground. But one cannot send the devil to finish God’s job. No!’45 In 1990 Jusuf Wanandi regretted that Khasebul (after 1978 continued by another Jesuit, Lukas Alamsyah) had concentrated on a short political training for small selected groups that were not truly part of the broad Catholic students’ movement pmkri. He hoped for a continuation of Khasebul but in a less elitist way with more impact on the broader Catholic organisations.46 A quite peculiar development among ‘Beek’s men’ was that two of them became very close to the most important advisors of the new president Soeharto. Beek and his students had made contacts with Ali Moertopo. This was institutionalised when Liem Bian Kie, known as Jusuf Wanandi after Chinese names were forbidden from the late 1960s, became personal assistant to Ali Murtopo, head of the intelligence and special (secret) operations from 1968 until 1973. His brother Liem Bian Khoen, known as Sofjan Wanandi became the personal assistant to General Soedjono Hoemardani. This created the image of a Catholic-military cooperation that resulted in the establishment of csis, Centre for Strategic and International Studies (quite probably formulated after a similar institute or think tank at the Jesuit Georgetown University in Washington). csis started as a discussion group in 1964 and in 1971 it became formally a research institute after the model of the rand Corporation, to give advice, information and suggestions to the Soeharto government. Not all Catholics were happy with the radical confrontation strategy of Beek. Student activist Louis Wangge and student, later renowned social scientist, George Aditjondro appreciated his anti-Communism but did not follow his choice for one green party (the army) against the other green one (Muslims). There were also several fellow Jesuits who rejected the aggressive tactics of Beek. At the national meeting of bishops in November 1970 there was a fierce debate about the strategies of Father Beek. Some criticism stated that Beek behaved more or less like a ‘private intelligence service or cia’. A special assistant of the Jesuit General Superior, H. Dargan, came to Indonesia in 1971 and ordered the temporary suppression of the Kasebul courses and Beek took leave to the Netherlands until 1973 and only resumed his work but in a more modest 45 46\n\nWieringa 2007.

But he also had supporters until the first decade of the twenty-first century.47 In October 1965 already the first killings of people suspected of Communism started, mostly in Java and Bali, under supervision and with logistic support of army personnel, but often by Muslim youth gangs. The killings lasted until about April 1966. Also outside Java and Bali there was the tragedy of violence and massacres. Catholics were involved in the island of Flores where the older elite were members of the Partai Katolik, but critical youth in various regions had joined the nationalist party or were not members of any political party. The komop, Operational Command for the Restoration of Peace and Security, took in Flores the side of traditional Catholic leaders against any opponents during the last decades. Catholic clergy had no strategy and no social power to prevent a massive killing in the Maumere region where between 800–2000 people lost their lives. One young diocesan priest had the courage to protest the imminent killing of 45 villagers, but was then sent away from the region to far away Ende. Two other priests only had the courage to administer the last sacraments to those condemned to death, before they were also called to Ende.48 The first two decades after the start of Soeharto’s New Order were a period of strong revitalisation of all religions in Indonesia. The ban on the Communist Party and the new meaning given to Pancasila as the great defender of religion meant that formal membership of a religion became more and more urgent. Many Chinese who had some affinity with traditional Confucianism decided to embrace Christianity in its Protestant or Catholic garb as a safe and modern alternative for the danger being considered as Communists and also to guarantee good education for their children. Quite a few nominal Muslims in Java (abangan) converted to Christianity, although Christians were as strong anti-Communist as most Muslims, but they showed more sympathy towards converts. In the more isolated regions in the outer islands where the world religions only had arrived in the beginning of the twentieth century many tribal people now had to decide between Islam or Christianity. Only a few small communities of traditional religions could label their past as a local tradition of Hinduism. This happened in South Kalimantan (Kaharingan) and Batak Land in Sumatra (Parmalim).49 47 48 49\n\nSome critical notes in Heuken 2009:157 and 188; a very harsh criticism by fellow Jesuit Harry Stolk in Ismawan 1991:140–149.

The government convoked an inter-religious consultation in Jakarta, 30 November 1967, and proposed that the religions should declare that they would not take the believers of other universal religions as the object of their missionary activities. Christian missionary activities or Muslim daʾwah should only be directed at deepening the faith of adherents of one’s own religion. The Muslim party was willing to formally enunciate such a statement. A common declaration was prepared by the Muslim Minister of Religion, K.H.M. Dachlan, but Catholics and Protestants reconfirmed the missionary character of their faith and rejected the declaration against proselytising. The chairman of the Protestant Council of Churches, retired general T.B. Simatupang, ‘fought like a lion to defend his Christian position’, while the Catholic representative, Ben Mang Reng Say firmly joined his Protestant colleague, but remained mostly silent.51 The failure of the 1967 Jakarta meeting demonstrates constraint as the basic goal of the government policy in establishing inter-religious harmony. One of the causes of the 1967 riots in Makassar was the complaint about the construction of a great church building in front of the central mosque. Therefore 13 September 1969 a common instruction by the Minister of Religion and the Minister of Internal Affairs decided that new religious buildings would be 50\n\n51\n\nBoland 1971:230–231; Aritonang 2004:382–397. Muskens arrived in Makassar on 1 November 1967 and wrote about the situation in various presbyteries: Bishop Nico Schneiders continued playing bridge amidst riots and demonstrations in the streets, while in another parish the church was quickly closed during evening Mass and this prevented further damage. Muskens relates a story that a 70 years old Protestant minister had given an interview to Muslim students in which he spoke very negatively about Islam. He had confirmed the interview by a written letter that was published in a newspaper and thus initiated the riots. Another cause could have been the preparation for the General Assembly of the Indonesian Council of Churches which was held in Makassar 29 October until 8 November 1967. Muskens attended also part of this meeting: Muskens, Diary, IIIB, 13–15. In September 1967 a meeting of representatives all Protestant students had taken place in Makale, Torajaland. In Makassar many posters were placed with the Indonesian wording of the theme of the World Council of Churches Assembly of Uppsala (1968): Christ will renew the world. This also caused angry feelings with Muslims. A lively description of this dramatic event by Haryono 1985:153–166; the Protestant professor Ihromi, who published also a contribution in this Festschrift for Rasjidi does not mention this event, although he speaks about inter-religious relations, ibid. 167–171. Cf. Boland 1971:234.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n23\n\nsubject to strict rules. For any new construction the permit of the governor of a province should be obtained and any problem should be reported to the national ministry in Jakarta. One of the most striking rules is that a religious building should serve the local community, living in the neighbourhood of the (new) building. No new places of worship should be built amongst a community of another faith. In later specifications it was added that no private houses should be used as places of worship, or transformed into such buildings. For diaspora communities like many Christians in major cities, it has since then become more and more difficult to built new places of worship.52 The revival of religion was not visible in the political system. After the deadlock about the new constitution in 1956–59, Soeharto did not want a new debate about a stronger position of religion in politics. The 1971 elections brought spectacular results. The new ‘party’ supported by the new government, formally called golkar or Movement of Functional Groups, received 63% of the votes and 236 out of 360 seats. Muslim parties gained 27%, nationalist only 7%, while the Protestant Party still had 1.34% (7 seats) and the Catholic Party 1.1% and three seats only. In 1973 Soeharto ordered a fusion of parties. Besides golkar only one Muslim and one Nationalist party was allowed to exist. The Christian parties therefore merged with the Nationalists and it was the end of a specific Catholic identity in politics. However, the government remained sensible about regional and religious sentiments. There were always quite a few Protestants (finally about 6% of the whole population) and somewhat less Catholics (in the 1980s 3.5% of the population) in the national cabinet. Most prominent was Frans Seda, an economist from Flores, who had served in the Sumarno government and became minister of transport and later of finance in the early New Order governments. Next was Cosmas Batubara from Batakland, a student activist in the late 1960s against Communism. From 1978 he was a cabinet member. Johannes Baptista Sumarlin (b. 1932), a Javanese technocrat from the national planning office was one of the ‘Berkeley Mafia’, people who had studied economics in Berkeley and designed the economic development in the 1970 and 1980s. Sumarlin was a prominent minister between 1973–1988. There were always rumours that the highest man in the army, the Commander in Chief, should not be a Muslim: a Christian would not try to carry out a successful coup against a Muslim President. True or not, under Soeharto between 1973 and 1978 it was the Protestant Batak Maraden Panggabean and from 1983 until 1988 it was the Javanese Catholic Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani who held the highest office in the army. Moerdani was already renowned as one of the planners of 52\n\nFor this and other decisions Sudjangi 1996.\n\n24\n\nchapter 1\n\nthe conquest of East Timor in 1975, as a staunch fighter against Muslim extremism, and close to Soeharto. Between 1988 and 1993 he was Defence Minister. However, according to strong rumours, he fell into disgrace in 1993 because he had rebuked Soeharto for the unlimited corruption of his children. The minor role of religion in politics was more or less balanced by three developments in the 1970s. First was the debate about a new Marriage Law in 1973–74. The first draft for the bill resulted from the secular lawyers of the Justice Department. It was a bill that should give equal rights to men and women, with many difficulties for any style of polygamy. The Muslims in parliament, as a group a minority, threatened a walk-out, a clear opposition to an interpretation of Pancasila’s democracy and nationalism where unanimous decisions were hailed as the true ideal. Because of the strong position of marriage in Islamic legal history finally the new law of 1974 gave much more power to the Muslim officials of the Department of Religion by the formulation that all Indonesians should marry ‘according to their religion’. In fact it also resulted in more respect for Catholic rulings on marriage, although we will see in the chapter on the South-eastern Islands that in many places the Catholic and Protestants Churches were not successful in imposing their marriage rules on the first generations of converts. A second sign of the continuing role of religion in society and politics were two decisions of the Minister of Religion (known as decisions 70 and 77, respectively, issued on 1 and 15 August 1978). Decision 70/1978 stipulated restrictions for religious propaganda: only people who had no religion could be addressed but promotion of one’s belief to an adherent of recognised religions is forbidden. Further it was stressed that marketing of religion is not allowed when it is accompanied by gifts like food, money, medicines. Decision 77/1978 declared that foreign help for religious institutes and persons would need a special permit from the government. Religions who make use of foreign personnel should make concrete schedules to secure that within a limited period no more foreign personnel would be needed. There were some reports in Islamic magazines that related these decrees to the fight against international Islamic terrorism, but the majority saw it as a support for Muslims who feared that a slow but certain process of Kristenisasi, Christianisation of Indonesia, was the strategy of Christian missionary circles and that Muslims should defend their religion against these efforts. Most Protestant Churches as well as the Catholics were financially still dependent on foreign help and especially the Catholic Church which still had a majority of non-Indonesian priests. This would change quickly in the 1980s and 1990s. The actual implementation of this law was less draconian than the wording of the decrees: financial help in fact was not severally controlled and the visa procedures remained difficult.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n25\n\nIn a book of 1978 Willem Frederik Wertheim pictures Indonesian Muslims as a ‘majority with a minority complex’. Since independence they had remained backward in the field of economy (dominated by Chinese citizens), education and medical care (where Christian schools and hospitals were better than Muslim schools and hospitals), in politics (where they could not gain enough seats in parliament to express their majority), in cultural expressions (where the Christians had much better newspapers and publishing houses).53 This would change in the next decades and the decrees of 1978 are a sign for this. The third proof of an ongoing debate between Pancasila and the more outspoken influence of religion was the programme for inter-religious harmony that was initiated by Mukti Ali, minister of religion, 1970–78, but brought to full maturity by his successor Alamsyah Ratu Perwiranegara (1978–82). After a long domination of the Ministry of Religion by traditional scholars, originating from the Islamic boarding schools of the countryside (pesantren), in 1970 Dr Abdul Mukti Ali, a graduate from McGill University and pupil of Wilfred Cantwell Smith, was nominated Minister of Religion. His great ambition was to modernise Indonesian Islam in a somehow Weberian sense: Islam should become a motor for social and economic development. He wanted to introduce more secular studies in the traditional Islamic schools. He also wanted more openness to the religious aspects of the western world. The State Academy of Islamic Studies (iain, Institut Agama Islam Negeri) should seek contact with western academic institutes and introduce a modern style of comparative religion. Inter-Religious contacts and dialogue were an important tool for this strategy. This policy was continued by his successor Alamsyah Ratu Perwiranegara, an army general and close assistant to Soeharto in the 1970s. He had served in the Indonesian military contribution to United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, and stressed that religious pluralism could be a dangerous and negative factor. He started a threefold programme of a) internal harmony within religions; b) harmony between the various religions; c) harmony between the various religions and the government. Alamsyah made much money available for numerous meetings between representatives of the major religions. It was quite common that for these top-down dialogues not only representatives of religions were invited but also government officials and military advisors, talking to urge inter-religious harmony. Christians often had double feelings towards these initiatives: they were happy with official recognition, but were also afraid that their freedom to preach their religion to outsiders would be restrained by these activities. 53 Wertheim 1978:206–230, Chapter 11, Indonesische moslims: meerderheid met een minderheidsmentaliteit.\n\n26\n\nchapter 1\n\nAlso, quite a few Muslims were not always happy with this religious policy of the Indonesian government. In 1975 at the initiative of the Ministry of Religion a National Council of Muslim Scholars (Majelis Ulama Indonesia, mui) was established with office space in the most prestigious mosque of the country, the Jakarta Istiqlal Mosque. In 1981 its chairman, respected Muslim leader Prof Dr Hamka (acronym of Haji Abdulmalik ibn Abdulkarim Amrullah) issued a fatwa concerning Muslim participation in Christmas celebrations. It had become a quite common practice that Muslims in mixed neighbourhoods would visit their Christian neighbours to say Merry Christmas, and have some food. In Christian schools Muslim pupils were invited to play in a Christmas Musical, to sing in choirs. mui called it haram or forbidden for Muslims to participate in Christian festivities. Hamka was called by the Minister of Religion and as a result of this pressure the fatwa was withdrawn from circulation, although it was not formally revoked.54 In the 1970s Pancasila had slowly developed to become some kind of a civil religion of Indonesia, with its own rituals, ethics and even some kind of dogmatic foundation. In 1978 the Congress (an extended Parliament that formulated Five-Year-Plans) had ordered P4 courses. P4 stands for Pedoman Penghayatan dan Pengamalan Pancasila, Guidelines for the Education and Practice of Pancasila. It became an obligatory course for all government officials, mosque leaders, students, and many others. Pancasila became also an obligatory subject in all schools from kindergarten to university. Flag hoisting became common practice on the seventeenth of every month in schools, government offices and other public buildings, commemorating the independence of 17 August 1945. Television would daily broadcast anthems celebrating Pancasila as the ‘Basis of our Nation, the source of all our laws, our philosophy of life and help for practical life, the soul and identity of the Indonesian people, the conscience of the Indonesian people’. At the flag hosting these anthems were sung, people would wear shirts with images of the banyan tree, representing the village democracy and unity of the people. Some scholars have compared this Pancasila civil religion with Japanese Shintoism or with American Civil Religion.55 This culminated in the proposal of the Congress of 1983 to formulate Pancasila as the asas tunggal or sole basis for social movements in the country. There were also protests against this trend. Several orthodox Muslims as well as Christians protested against this formula that was sometimes seen as an attempt to replace the world religions by Pancasila as a pseudo religion. Although the Congress formulated that Pancasila was not a 54 55\n\nSteenbrink 1993:233–237. Steenbrink 1990.\n\nReligion in Indonesian Politics\n\n27\n\nreligion, the formula of asas tunggal caused a division in the most prominent Muslim Student Organisation, hmi Himpunan Mahasiswa Islam, that split into a faction that accepted and one the rejected Pancasila. The assembly of the Council of Indonesian (Protestant) Churches in Ambon, October 1984, adopted as article 3 of its constitution the formula: ‘The Communion of Indonesian Churches has its foundation in Jesus Christ, the Lord and Saviour, in agreement with God’s Word in the Bible’.
