        "text": "He may have begun as a frail and seemingly bumbling compromise choice in a politically divided country. But behind Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid's outwardly erratic actions a subtle, decisive strategy is gradually taking shape. His latest move in the taming of the once-powerful military puts his own supporters in key positions, and moves some remaining hardline generals to the sidelines.\n\nDistancing the army from politics will become much easier with reformist Major-General Agus Wirahadikusumah as head of the country's strategic command. His belief that the army should confine itself to defence matters is well known.\n\nThe general will receive backing from like-minded commanders who also have been promoted. And with General Wiranto suspended from the cabinet, President Wahid looks well set to consolidate his position and steer Indonesia toward stability.\n\nBut he is still tiptoeing across a political minefield. Radical Islamic groups are on the watch for any false step. If they ally themselves with disaffected military officers, they could challenge the President when he delivers his accountability report to parliament in August. Much depends on whether Mr Wahid can win the hearts and minds of a demoralised army.\n\nThere is some concern that the new chief's outspokenness might widen rifts in the army just when the President needs it to keep the provinces under control. But handled correctly, this move could give the military fresh direction, as well as strengthening Mr Wahid's hand."
