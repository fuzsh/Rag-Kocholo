        "text": "32 The finding that the overall decrease in command tenure is best explained by the changing size of the officer corps suggests two related hypotheses. First, if command tenure is a function of the size of the officer corps, it would seem likely that variation in tenure would be observable between classes of different sizes, with officers from large classes enjoying short tours of duty while officers from small classes receiving comparatively longer tours of duty. Surprisingly, however, there is no direct correspondence between class size and tenure per class in a given position. Officers from large academy classes do not necessarily serve for shorter lengths of time than do officers from smaller classes; the data in Table 1 suggest that tenure is inversely related to the size offive-yearcohorts. Classes 1–4, who commanded the various Kodam during the second half of the 1980s, had an average tenure of 650–850 days. The larger Class 5 1965 that followed these small and highly successful classes suffered in terms of both total number of officers appointed as well as mean tenure.\n\nThe second cohort of graduates, Classes 6–9, had nearly identical tenures—at roughly 525 days per officer—despite considerable differences in class size. The third cohort, Classes 10–14, is larger still, and here we see a further decline in overall tenure as well as in rough parity between classes, with mean tenure 250–450 days. It is important to note that there are officers from Classes 10, 11, and 12 currently serving as Kodam commanders who have not been included in these calculations, and that Classes 13 and 14 are likely to receive additional appointments. The second corollary hypothesis is that there is a correlation between class size and the relative success of each class in terms of the total number of appointments received. In other words, with no change in the total number of available billets, the percentage of officers appointed to command a particular type of unit should be higher for small classes and lower for large classes. Once again, however, there is no direct correspondence between class size and the relative success of a particular academy class. Rather than showing an even distribution of command billets by class, Table 1 shows three “peaks.\"The first peak represents the combination of Classes 1,2 and 3, which received 10,13, and 12 Kodam commands, respectively, and which saw over 10 percent of their officers appointed to these posts. The success of these three classes served to block the promotion of officers from Classes 4 and 5, accounting for the sharp decrease in the total number of Korem (for Class 5) and Kodam (for both classes) commands received. The second peak represents Class 6 1965, which received an extraordinary fifty-nine Korem commands (13.6 percent of all officers) and fourteen Kodam commands (for a more modest 3.2 percent of all officers). Again, the exceptional success of Class 6 1965 prevented the collective promotion of officers from the next three graduating classes. The third peak occurs for Kodam appointments for Classes 10 1970 and 11 1971, and for Korem appointments for Classes 13 1973 and 14 1974."
