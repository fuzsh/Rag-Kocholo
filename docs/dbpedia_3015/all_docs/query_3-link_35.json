        "text": "Malaysia shocked Denmark 3-2 in the other semi-final but Indonesia must be favourites to lift their 12th title, judging by their dynamic performance before a stunned crowd of about 3,000.\n\nThe Indonesian camp erupted with joy after their world number four pairing of Candra Wijaya and Budiarto Sigit handed Yang Ming and Yu Jinhao a lesson in their 15-3, 15-6 tie-clinching victory.\n\nSigit, who showed his prowess during the game, smacked the shuttle down the middle for the winning shot and reacted by falling to one knee in a silent prayer.\n\nIndonesia team manager Agus Wirahadikusumah said tomorrow night's final would be close although he was quietly confident of victory.\n\n'It's going to be a 50-50 game, although we have shown our strengths in all departments. I'm sure Malaysia will also be feeling confident after beating Denmark. The Malaysians have their strengths too,' he said.\n\n'It's a good win but there is still work to do. Our target is to retain the Thomas Cup.' China team manager and coach Li Yongbo said his team could not match Indonesia in both singles and doubles and that the team would need to improve on their game.\n\n'We will need to return to the court and improve on all areas. Our net play was not good. Indonesia showed their strength in the singles and doubles. We must work harder,' he said.\n\nThe Indonesians must have been worried after reigning All-England champion Sun Jun won the first rubber for China against 1995 world champion Heryanto Arbi, who aggravated a calf injury in the first game and struggled for the rest of the match.\n\nWorld number two Sun recovered from a first-game lapse to prevail 17-18, 15-4, 15-1, but it only made Indonesia more determined to put the match back into proper prospective.\n\nIndonesia, egged on by a small but noisy Indonesian contingent, really hit their straps to win the next three rubbers to complete a comprehensive victory over the Chinese, who have now failed to reach the final for the third straight tournament.\n\nIndonesia levelled matters when Ricky Subagja and Rexy Mainaky swept aside Liu Yong and Zhang Wei, 15-6, 15-2.\n\nHendrawan then ran out a comfortable 15-9, 15-4 victor over Luo Yigang to give Indonesia a crucial 2-1 lead in rubbers.\n\nWijaya and Sigit then showed phenomenal form to beat their opponents and give the Indonesian the tie before Dong Jiong, last year's All-England champion, gave China small consolation by winning the dead rubber, 15-10, 17-15 over Indra Wijaya.\n\nMeanwhile, a Malaysian juggernaut guided by a Danish master tactician overcame the stutters before steaming into the Thomas Cup final with a thrilling 3-2 upset win against highly fancied Denmark.\n\nFormer Danish great Morten Frost, who switched allegiance by joining the Malaysian team as their head coach, was the architect behind the electrifying semi-final victory."
