        "text": "After 5 fulfilling years, I will be moving on from AWS to pursue the calling I have felt in my heart for the last several years: to provide equal access to good Healthcare service for all Indonesian. My last day will be May 30th, and until then I look forward to catching up with my fellow Amazonian Indonesians, and our esteemed customers & partners. I would like to thank all of AWS ID Family and AWS ASEAN for the support, also guidance from Conor McNamara, you have been our tallest supporter. My heart is full ❤️. Together, we have created many important milestones. We championed internally to get our Indonesia Region (CGK), and we announced a US$5B investment in Apr 2019 which was not only good for us in the business, but more importantly, boosted our Indonesian economy, giving our customers an access to the Best Cloud services they can get. The year after, we built a case to invest in skills development for Indonesia (to meet our commitment to train 100k Indonesians) and seeded a few programs including Laptop for Builders, BackEnd Developer with Dicoding, and funded thousands of professionals from our customers. Year to date, we have trained over 300k Indonesians. I am fulfilled every time I remember our conversations with the kids from Gunung Kidul and PWD students from Bali. We are not only providing a skill, but more importantly a “hope” that reminds me of my own story (I came from a humble family). So many milestones that I can’t share in just one post, amongst those was our first Indonesia Cloud Day (a record of ~3000 people), Jakarta PopUp Loft, and many more. Beyond those key milestones, I believe what brought us this far was how we went through our toughest time as a family. We lost our dearest brothers, Hengky and Avez, but we endured. Despite all the challenges, we successfully launched CGK Region and got Indonesia’s largest organizations migrating to AWS. We are now in the best position to accelerate further and become the Cloud of choice for all Indonesian companies. I sincerely believe, the future is bright for AWS Indonesia. Especially because the company has all of you as the backbone and key value differentiator for our customers. With the leadership of our dearest friend, Anthony Amni, I believe this company will do much more than we have done so far. He is a passionate leader, always giving 1000% for customers, for the company, and for the team. I am so glad to hand over this responsibility to the person who describes himself as “100% Amazonian, 100% Indonesian”. My best wishes to you all. Last but not least, allow me to end my farewell with the following quote: Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true: That even as we grieved, we grew, Even as we hurt, we hoped, That even as we tired, we tried, That we’ll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. We are ONE AWS INDONESIA. #AWSSelaluAdaUntukIndonesia"
