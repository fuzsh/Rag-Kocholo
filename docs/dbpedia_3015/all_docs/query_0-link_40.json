The thesis demonstrates how Polri has become intimately involved in illicit practices and criminal economies, including accepting bribes from Chinese business networks and profiting from illegal gambling. Rather than improving governance, democratization has caused a restructuring of security forces' involvement in illicit financing, configuring new corrupt relationships between the state and criminal activities. The thesis is based on extensive field",
