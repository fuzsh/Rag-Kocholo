        "text": "The study investigated the relevance of Environmental Adult Education in the prevention of habitat loss in selected local Government Areas in Ogoni of Rivers State. The fact of deforestation, agricultural practice, industrialization and oil spill leading to habitat loss in Rivers State has raise questions of great concern to stakeholders, particularly communities who have suffered species extinction. The purpose of this study is to find out the human activities that lead to habitat loss, examine the adverse effects of habitat loss on the environment and man; and determine ways through which environmental adult education can minimize the occurrence of habitat loss. Hence, three objectives and one null hypothesis were used for this study. Survey research design was adopted, questionnaires were used for data collection. Responses to the questionnaire were analyzed using mean and grand mean for all the research questions and Z-test for the hypothesis. The result of this study revealed that the Ogoni people are instrumental to the destruction of their God-given environment and the people that are involved in the act of deforestation, bush burning, oil spills, carrying out bunkering business, and practicing artisanal refining of crude oil which degrades the environment are mostly adults. It was recommended that there should massive environmental adult education to curb habitat loss and further environmental degradation.\n\nIt is our great pleasure to announce that the very first issue of the Indonesian Journal of Applied Environmental Studies (InJAST) is now be available in both print and online. This journal has evolved from the Journal of Environmental Education which started in 2015, and was managed by the Study Programme of Population and Environmental Education, Graduate Programme of Pakuan University. Because this study programme has now become the Study Programme of Environmental Management, we have decided to establish this new journal to publish scientific articles covering broader environmental issues that are written by the Indonesian students of graduate programmes either in Pakuan and other universities or researchers. Meanwhile, the publication and management of the Journal of Environmental Education will be transferred to another relevant faculty or study programme within Pakuan University.We intend the new InJAST to be published in English (with abstracts both in Engli...\n\nArticle Info The purpose of this study was to determine the population of dominance plant species (%), and as information for the conservation of land areas to increase the availability of animal feed in Kemiri village, Jember district, East Java. The number of plant species as animal feed was 22, consist of 12 types of grass, six types of legumes, and four types of weeds. The population of grass species more than 75% consisted of Axonopus compessus (85.71%), Para grass (82.14%), Bracharia decumben (75.00%), Kyllinga brevifolia (75.00%), and clover was Centrosema Molle (78.57%). The comparison between plant species consists of grass 57.77%, legumes 22.31%, and weeds 19.92%. The frequent observation of plant height is 19.08 cm, plant cover power is 66%. The findings of this study suggest that Axonopus compessus, Para grass, Bracharia decumben, Kyllinga brevifolia, and Centrosema molle are dominance of plant species could increase production, and in these case could used for developme..."
