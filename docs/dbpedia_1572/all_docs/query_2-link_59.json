        "text": "Air Combat Element Branch\n\nThe Air Combat Element (ACE) Branch identifies, analyzes and introduces new technology into the Marine Corps aviation community enhancing the warfighting capability for the air/ground team.\n\nA current Air Combat Element project is Tier II Unmanned Aircraft System Concept Demonstrator. This platform technology effort is not intended to satisfy a material solution for the Marine Corps’ Tier II UAS requirement, but rather is intended to:\n\nServe as a test platform for emerging UAS technologies\n\nFacilitate the development of Tier II UAS tactics, techniques, and procedures\n\nInvestigate future Tier II UAS concepts of employment\n\nInform Tier II UAS program of record requirements\n\nThe Tier II UAS Concept Demonstrator will be employed during an extended user evaluation in support of current operations. All data collected will be used to inform Marine Corps Tier II UAS program of record requirements. Among others, the Warfighting Laboratory intends to employ the Concept Demonstrator to investigate the following technologies:\n\nAdvanced electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensors\n\nLaser designators\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors\n\nMulti and Hyper-spectral imaging sensors\n\nCommunications and data relay payloads\n\nSignals Intelligence (SIGINT) payloads\n\nHeavy Fuel Engines (HFEs)\n\nElectric Engines\n\nCommand, Control, Communication, and Computers\n\nThe Command, Control, Communication, and Computers (C4) Branch identifies, experiments with, and analyzes new communication and information system technologies for the warfighter. C4 Branch supports numerous Marine Corps network developmental tasks and interoperability demonstrations to assess the potential impact of advanced C4 technologies on future expeditionary operations. Current C4 Projects:\n\nNext Generation Command & Control (NGC2) is a developmental effort to produce a surrogate C2 architecture to support Enhanced Company Operations (ECO) and Enhanced MAGTF Operations (EMO). It is focused on increasing command and control capabilities from the squad to the MAGTF-level. This project focuses on the emerging Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (MANET) concept which will ultimately allow for greater flexibility and reliability of tactical networks. Another focus area within NGC2 is Digital Tactical Communication System (DTCS). DTCS is a tactical communications system that uses Netted IRIDIUM to provide On-The-Move (OTM), Over-The-Horizon (OTH), and Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) voice and data capabilities at ranges greater than 200 miles.\n\nMobile Expeditionary Tactical Network-CLOC Enabler (METN-CE) is a mobile CLOC (Company Level Operations Cell) C4 concept demonstrator that seeks to provide a mobile company-level Combat Operations Center (COC) with enhanced C2 capabilities that are currently only available with fixed infrastructure organic to higher echelon organizations. The effort will provide OTM and OTH voice and data connectivity via a broadband data network path enabling secure internet access at the tactical level. It also provides MANET and DTCS OTM and OTH voice and data-over-radio connectivity. A CLOC enabling package provides support for intelligence efforts, combat operations, and in enhancing a commander’s battlefield situational awareness.\n\nNetwork Management System- Tactical MANET (NMS-TM) is a project that aids the decision-making processes and administration of a tactical MANET in both simulation-based and real-time operational environments. NMS-TM enables users to predict, monitor, and control network behavior; this specifically includes viewing and remotely managing variables such as node status, node location, attached equipment, channel selection, frequencies, error rates, and network utilization.\n\nLogistics Combat Element\n\nThe Logistics Combat Element (LCE) Branch identifies, analyzes and introduces new technologies into the Marine Corps logistics community that will provide an enhanced warfighting capability for the operational air/ground team.\n\nForce Protection\n\nThe Force Protection (FP) section tracks, examines and conducts rigorous experimental reviews of new or emerging technologies with potential to protect individual Marines and Marine Corps units from life-threatening situations caused by improvised explosive devices, snipers and small arms fire.\n\nExperimental Forward Operating Base\n\nThe Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) held the Marine Corps’ first annual energy summit in the summer of 2009. During the summit, General Conway identified the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED’s) as the greatest threat to Marines and our Coalition partners. Support Convoys carrying fuel and bottled water are more exposed to this threat as they travel tenuous lines of communication throughout Afghanistan. The Commandant challenged industry and other government agencies to explore ways of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and bottled water in order to get Marines off the road.\n\nThe Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB) is chartered to find materiel and non-materiel solutions that improve the efficiency of the operating forces. The team focused on three areas: efficient power generation, efficient shelters and water purification. These three areas are seen as key to reducing the amount of bulk liquids being transported across the battlefield. By improving the way Marines currently employ tactical generator sets while incorporating renewable energy sources a significant reduction in the use of fuel can be realized. The current generation of tactical shelters is inefficient. If we can increase the insulation properties of the tent and reduce the solar load on the structure the run time for environmental control units can be reduced. Finally, bottled water takes up the greatest percentage of bulk liquids transported in Afghanistan. A small unit water purification capability will reduce the requirement to transport bottled water down to the tactical level.\n\nAn Extended User Evaluation (EUE) with materiel and non-materiel solutions found at ExFOB will be deployed to Afghanistan in the fall of 2010. An operating force unit will use the Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTP’s) and equipment suite from ExFOB for an operational evaluation to test the military utility of the concept.\n\nThe Marine Corps has a problem and Additive Manufacturing has the potential to solve it.\n\nOur equipment inventories are continuing to age, critical components are encountering early and unpredictable failures and obsolescence challenges are getting worse as more domestic manufactures shut down fabrication lines or close their doors all together. As a service, we need to be smaller, lighter, more lethal, more distributed, and more naval.\n\nEach of the goals is jeopardized by arduous supply chains, massive distribution stores, obsolete equipment, and an obstructive acquisition cycle. The solution is to increase MAGTF combat effectiveness through expeditionary capabilities and evolutionary advances in logistics chain flexibility, equipment readiness, and platform sustainability. Additive Manufacturing has the potential to enable enhanced capabilities wherever the next fight arises to include distributed operations scenarios."
