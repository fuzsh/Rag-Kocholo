        "text": "The Council of EUROCAE is responsible for approving the establishment of new Working Groups (WG) and for the definition of their work programmes, taking account of submissions made by any aviation stakeholder and in particular EUROCAE members. The Council reviews and approves all documents prior to their publication. The General Secretariat monitors the WG activities, and has initiated the Chairperson's Club to provide the Chairpersons and Secretaries with an opportunity to learn more about EUROCAE's procedures. This event is also an excellent opportunity to meet fellow Chairpersons and Secretaries, as well as the Secretariat staff.\n\nThe Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) develops the EUROCAE Technical Work Programme (TWP). The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of the ongoing technical standardization activities currently undertaken by EUROCAE together with a strategic outlook on the anticipated technical standardization activities to be potentially undertaken by EUROCAE, in order to illustrate the extent of the current and future EUROCAE work. The public version of the latest TWP is available here."
