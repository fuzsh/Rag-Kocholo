        "text": "Executive Summary\n\nUncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) have become essential elements of modern warfare and their role will expand in the future, raising the urgency of NATO and individual allies to rapidly adapt starting now.\n\nIndividual allied nations own a wide variety of UAS capabilities, and the alliance collectively owns and operates NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS). Despite NATO efforts to encourage procurement and capability development and to promote common standards and enabling capabilities, NATO has too few drones for a high-intensity fight against a peer adversary. It would be severely challenged to effectively integrate those it has in a contested environment.\n\nSeveral challenges hinder the development of robust and effective UAS capabilities across the alliance. These include limited interoperability, critical capability gaps, inadequate platform survivability, deficiencies in personnel and training, limits to intelligence processing, and more.\n\nFor NATO and allies to leverage and prepare for the full potential of future drone warfare, this report recommends the following:\n\nFirst, the alliance must clearly assess UAS and counter-UAS (C-UAS) capability requirements based on lessons learned from recent conflicts, technological developments underway, and expected future threats and challenges.\n\nSecond, UAS and C-UAS capability development and policy development must be guided by the need for scale and interoperability and the imperatives of multidomain operations.\n\nThird, enabling capabilities such as AI tools, data architecture, communications networks, and cyber and space capabilities and services must be enhanced.\n\nFourth, NATO and individual allies should leverage the significant innovation efforts underway while improving operational experimentation and procurement processes.\n\nFifth, NATO should refine or establish joint allied doctrine, operational concepts, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to cover new and expanded roles of UAS and the growing importance of C-UAS.\n\nSixth, both UAS and C-UAS capability integration into NATO and national forces will require a special focus on human resource development.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine marks not only the return of conventional war in Europe but also technological innovation on the battlefield. The conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems.\n\nUkraine has pioneered the use of both military and commercial off-the-shelf UAS – also known as “drones” – to perform tactical reconnaissance and surveillance, collect real-time intelligence, adjust artillery fire, provide communication relay, conduct short to long range strike and battle damage assessment (BDA), and drop repurposed munitions against enemy equipment and personnel. The net effect is that Ukrainian forces have employed drones as enablers and force multipliers, shortening and simplifying the “kill chain” and enabling better and faster military decision-making.\n\nThis is the latest example in a growing list of conflicts featuring UAS, including the civil wars in Libya, Syria, and Yemen, as well as the region of Nagorno-Karabakh. UAS proliferation has empowered both state and non-state actors with new and, at times, substantial capabilities, ending the West’s monopoly on UAS and threatening to erode its technological edge.\n\nBigger changes loom. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), data-related technologies and applications, quantum sensing, next-generation communications, swarming technology, and human-machine teaming capabilities promise to enhance the ubiquity, versatility, lethality, and effectiveness of UAS. This changing character of the UAS threat may potentially reshape the offense-defense balance, making counter-UAS systems equally important. At the same time, increasingly contested battlespaces (air, land, and sea) pose doctrinal and operational challenges to NATO’s use of medium and large UAS.\n\nPreliminary indications in Ukraine and elsewhere already suggest that the ubiquitous presence of sensor-packed UAS on the battlefield may frustrate achieving the element of surprise and render offensive maneuver operations ever more difficult and costly.\n\nThe pervasiveness of UAS also raises serious questions about force protection and the vulnerability of forces and infrastructure to attack, including at considerable distances from the frontline. As a British Army General put it, “the use of unmanned aerial systems has created a transparent battlefield where there is no sanctuary.”\n\nIndeed, UAS employment has reintroduced the threat of near-constant aerial observation and strike for conventional forces at a level not experienced since the Cold War. Cover, concealment, and protection from above are now concerns throughout the battlefield, not just on the front line. This ubiquitous vulnerability will have important implications for the future of land warfare and the ways in which ground forces are employed, protected, and defended in a sensor-rich environment.\n\nHowever, as many experts contend, drones require a variety of complex (and expensive) systems to support their use, as well as refined TTPs, enabling capabilities, and organizational structures to achieve tangible effects. This complex set of prerequisites is called the “military ecosystem,” and in robust form it can leverage UAS capabilities for decisive advantage.\n\nThis study aims to fill the gap in existing literature on NATO’s uncrewed aircraft systems, adopting a four-step approach. First, it identifies the main operational requirements and developments regarding the use of UAS in present and near-future high-intensity environments. To that end, the paper draws upon relevant lessons emerging from the war in Ukraine and other recent conflicts.\n\nSecond, it assesses NATO’s capabilities in the field of UAS, looking at the three traditional operational domains of air, land, and sea as well as the enabling domains of space and cyber. This includes the analysis of current policies and upcoming policy initiatives to boost alliance UAS capabilities at the national and multinational levels.\n\nThird, the report looks at the challenges affecting NATO’s use of UAS and key enabling functions as well as C-UAS capabilities. Finally, the report concludes with considerations and recommendations for changes needed to prepare the 31 (soon 32) allies to effectively operate together and leverage the maximum potential of UAS and C-UAS capabilities for decisive advantage in an increasingly complex security environment.\n\nThe History of Drones\n\nThe history of uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) – and technology in general – is one of continuous evolution. During the early Cold War, when the first UAS prototypes were introduced, their most common use was for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and limited strike missions.\n\nFast forward to 2023, UAS’ capabilities have expanded considerably, although their fundamental technologies have existed for decades, including propeller-powered aircraft, electro-optical sensors, precision munitions, and multiband data transmission. These are, in many respects, the same found in crewed aircraft. Today, UAS are a primary means of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) but they can also conduct air power missions similar to crewed aircraft – close air support, armed reconnaissance, interdiction, electronic warfare (EW) attacks, suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD), communications relay, and resupply and refueling.\n\nThe integration at scale of both automated (deterministic) instruments as well as nondeterministic AI and machine learning tools along with, advanced onboard computing, next-generation communications and data technologies (e.g., cloud and edge computing) promise to push UAS capabilities to unprecedented levels and reshape their evolutionary trajectory.\n\nPart I – UAS in Ukraine and Other Recent Conflicts: What lessons for NATO?\n\nUncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) have become essential elements of modern warfare and their role will expand in the future, raising the urgency of NATO and individual allies to rapidly adapt starting now.\n\nLessons Learned from UAS in the Ukraine War\n\nUkraine’s extensive use of multiple types of UAS, from high-end Turkish-made medium altitude long endurance (MALE) TB2 combat drones to small and cheap commercial Chinese-made DJI quadcopters, has helped Kyiv to repel and stop its much stronger opponent. The number of videos showing modified DJI quadcopters that chase and strike Russian personnel and equipment by dropping fin-stabilized grenades is a telling example. The cumulative kinetic and psychological effects of weaponized commercial drones deployed en-masse deserve further attention.\n\nDrones achieve their full potential when used in synergy with other combined arms capabilities, ranging from direct-fire maneuver, artillery and long-range fires, air defense (including counter-UAS), mobility and counter-mobility, as well as electronic warfare (EW) and air power. UAS will never be able to seize and hold terrain, but they can provide fire and logistical support, as well as eyes and ears to any command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) architecture, the “central nervous system” of any modern military.\n\nImportance of Counter-UAS Capabilities Revealed via the Ukraine War\n\nSecond, the war in Ukraine has highlighted the critical importance of having the capacity to counter or defend against the threat from UAS – whether in the form of observation, strike, electronic warfare attack, disruption, etc. – and the urgent need to do so with more cost-effective solutions. While high-end air and missile defense systems and expensive munitions are reasonable for protecting high value assets (e.g., population areas, ships, critical military, or civilian infrastructure), intercepting a weaponized DJI quadcopter (worth a few hundred dollars) or even a ~$40,000 Iranian Shahed slow-flying munition with a million-dollar missile is not efficient or sustainable. Overall, the costs of damaging a target versus the value of that target and the benefit of adverse effects avoided comprise the metric that should be used to determine the cost-to-benefit index for counter-UAS.\n\nThe challenge for future counter-UAS (C-UAS) capabilities, therefore, is twofold: 1) to turn the cost-of-intercept curve in favor of the defenders while 2) retaining a high success rate in defeating different types and large numbers of UAS attacking simultaneously. Russia, for example, has employed volleys of Shaheds for deep strikes against Ukraine’s civil infrastructure, and used Lancet-3 loitering munitions in large quantities to blunt the Ukrainian counteroffensive.\n\nAs NATO approaches a future where AI-enabled drone swarms are likely to play a significant role, NATO may have reached a critical point at which current air defense (AD) systems, including the most sophisticated ones, cannot neutralize large drone swarms or even volleys of uncoordinated loitering munitions. For these reasons, C-UAS requires a multi-spectrum and layered combination of different tools, both kinetic and non-kinetic, to be effective. This protection must be ensured from the forward tactical edge to the rear support area to air bases and strategic C2 nodes even further in depth.\n\nAnalysis by Capability Category\n\nSome lessons are novel while others reinforce those learned from other recent conflicts. This study begins with an analysis of the role played by UAS, C-UAS, and supporting capabilities in Ukraine and elsewhere, as well as key takeaways for the alliance.\n\nMedium and large-size UAS\n\nThese offer an unmatched combination of state-of-the-art sensors, strike capabilities, endurance, range, and payload. The gradual integration of more capable and sophisticated sensors alongside long-range precision munitions is paving the way for new roles and mission sets for these platforms.\n\nPopular models like the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 and Chinese Wing Loong II armed UAS are now in service in several countries and have played important roles in wars across the Middle East and Africa, including in Libya, Syria, Yemen, and Ethiopia. The TB2 was also a key enabler of Azerbaijan’s swift victory over Armenia in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In Ukraine, both sides have deployed MALE UAS for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) and strike missions, although Kyiv has made use of its systems more extensively and proficiently than its Russian aggressor.\n\nUkraine’s use of TB2\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, Ukrainian forces had some two dozen Turkish TB2 drones, which carry four smart laser-guided munitions and have an endurance of 27 hours. The TB2 also sports a capable multi-spectral sensor payload for information collection and targeting that includes a day-night electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR) camera. Other payloads include multi-function laser targeting capabilities and a multi-purpose active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar.\n\nThanks to its relatively small radar signature, the TB2 can be harder to detect with ground-based radars, although its vulnerability increases significantly vis-à-vis multilayered integrated air defense systems that combine a variety of ground-based and airborne radars. Given its versatile characteristics, the TB2 has typically been used to:\n\nspot and illuminate targets for artillery;\n\nprovide long-range ISR into the Black Sea;\n\nattack logistic units and time-critical targets;\n\nconduct battle damage assessment (BDA).\n\nUkrainian TB2s were also instrumental in the destruction of enemy air defenses (DEAD) in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion. According to open-source data based on visually confirmed losses in Ukraine during the first weeks of the war, the TB2 destroyed 15 air-defense systems – including Russia’s advanced Pantsir–S1 (SA-22 Greyhound) and Buk-M2 (SA-17 Grizzly) – along with several artillery pieces and logistics equipment.\n\nThe TB2s’ success partly stems from Russia’s slow deployment of mobile short and medium-range air defenses in the initial phase of the invasion. However, Russia’s capacity to counter Ukraine’s use of drones is improving. Just a few weeks after Russia’s initial attack, Russian forces started to commit their full air defense and electronic warfare (EW) capabilities, allowing Russia to shoot down Ukrainian TB2s in large numbers, with at least 18 visually confirmed losses at the time of writing.\n\nRussia’s use of medium and large-size UAS\n\nRussia’s use of MALE UAS has so far had less impact. First, Russia has a limited number of platforms. Indeed, the operational MALE UAS fleet at the onset of the 2022 offensive consisted of a handful of indigenous Korsar and Inokhodets systems, and a few more Forpost-R drones – a licensed copy of the Israeli IAI Searcher Mk II. The first Inokhodets UAS was delivered by the Kronshtadt Group in April 2020 after extensive trials in Syria. As of mid-2021, at least three Inokhodets operated from an airbase near Kirovskoe in occupied eastern Crimea. In the second half of 2022, Russia also received an unspecified number of Mohajer-6 multirole UAS from Iran, but their operational impact remains difficult to quantify.\n\nSimilar to the TB2, these Russian and Iranian platforms have a range of 200-300 km with supporting ground relay equipment. They can also carry an array of both guided and unguided ordnance, including Kab-20 and Qaem-5 light precision-guided munitions (PGM), respectively, an air-launched derivative of the Kornet 9M113FM-3 anti-aircraft missile known as the Kh-BPLA, and the heavier Kab-50 guided/unguided bomb. Based on open-source data, at least three Inokhodets, one Mohajer-6, and four Forposts have been shot down in Ukraine as of the writing of this report.\n\nThe second factor impeding Russia’s successful use of MALE is the lack of operational experience in using medium and large UAS in high-intensity environments, which is partly a byproduct of their limited number. In fact, despite having invested substantially in drone technology since at least 2008, Russia’s at-scale MALE UAS production has never materialized. The resulting limited inventory of MALE UAS has meant minimal integration of these systems with the Russian military, few opportunities for troops to train and familiarize with them, and neither development of an organic doctrine nor a mature concept of operations.\n\nThird, the skepticism over UAS among the senior ranks of the Russian military has likely hindered the integration of these strike-capable drones until very recently. The cause of this skepticism arises largely from institutional neglect rather than technological gaps. As maintained by Russian military analyst Konstantin Makienko, “programs for the development of [combat] unmanned aircraft were not considered a priority in the research and development work of the Ministry of Defense.” As a result, the Russian military has both overemphasized ISR systems at the expense of armed UAS and more slowly adapted in light of lessons emerging from recent conflicts on the value of UAS for fires.\n\nTurkish medium-size UAS\n\nAmong countries that have used or are using UAS in non-permissive combat environments, Turkey, which develops these systems indigenously, unsurprisingly seems to have the most mature and effective concept of operations, employing a “network-centric approach.” For this approach, drones are deployed in conjunction with electronic warfare, long-range fires, and rapid command-and-control (C2) systems enabled by distributed sensor-fusion capabilities.\n\nThis architecture, which Turkish analyst Can Kasapoğlu defines as “drone-augmented battle networks,” exploits UAS’ force-multiplying role and proved particularly effective in Syria, suppressing and destroying the regime’s Russian-made air defenses and other targets during Turkey’s Spring Shield operation in March 2020.\n\nSupported by electronic and signals intelligence (ELINT/SIGINT) CN-235 special mission aircraft, Turkish land-based Koral EW systems and the EW suite on board the TAI Anka-I, UAS located and blinded the Syrian air-defense radars and paved the way for a strike campaign by TB2s, Anka-S drones, and long-range guided artillery. At the same time, armed UAS identified targets for Turkish artillery and provided close air support (CAS) to Turkish ground forces.\n\nAzerbaijan’s quick success against Armenia later in 2020 also relied on a similar concept of operations. Baku’s forces employed a mix of repurposed unmanned decoys and EW systems to deceive, saturate, and locate Armenia’s Soviet-legacy air defenses, which were subsequently destroyed by long-range Israeli-made Harop loitering munitions and TB2s acquired from Turkey. According to military expert and author John Antal, “the war waged in Nagorno-Karabakh was a watershed, [marking] the first conflict in history won primarily by robotic systems.”\n\nNevertheless, some of this success was due to Armenia’s poor operational planning and air defense limitations—an attribute that is difficult to measure and frequently omitted from assessments. As noted by some analysts, Armenia’s air defense infrastructure mostly relied on Soviet-legacy systems, including the 9K33 Osa and 9K35 Strela short range air defense systems (SHORAD) – incapable of targeting high-flying drones like the TB2 – and long-range modernized S-300PS, which are not optimized for C-UAS missions. The latter S-300PS were destroyed early in the war by Harop anti-radiation loitering munitions.\n\nFurthermore, Armenia lacked enough EW capabilities to complement its air defense network and effectively disrupt Azerbaijan’s drone operations. Baku’s combined use of loitering munitions and small and medium UAS succeeded mostly because Armenia’s anti-access/air denial (A2/AD) systems were not prepared to counter the more sophisticated Azerbaijani employment of UAS.\n\nSurvivability of medium and large-size UAS\n\nThe employment of MALE UAS was less successful in other recent conflicts. The TB2 and Chinese-made Wing Loong I and II suffered high attrition in Syria and Libya, even in operational contexts characterized by modest air defenses. Overall, at least 10 Wing Loong family UAS and many more TB2s used by the forces loyal to Libyan General Khalifa Haftar and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), respectively, were shot down in Libya between April 2019 and July 2020.\n\nThe success of the GNA’s TB2 against modern Russian-made Pantsir air defense systems (ADS) – which on paper can track and engage the drone before it comes close enough to launch its 14 km-range smart munitions – is likely due to the lack of supporting EW capabilities among Haftar’s forces and the inadequate proficiency and readiness of air defense operating crews. Some of the destroyed Pantsir, for example, had their radar switched on when hit.\n\nThe issue of UAS survivability, including in semi-permissive scenarios, also affects high-end MALE UAS such as the US-made MQ-9 “Reaper.” For example, one Italian and at least two US MQ-9 UAS were downed over Libya between 2019 and 2022, likely by Pantsir ADS operated by the Russian private military company Wagner Group. Back in 2013, then-commander of the US Air Force’s Air Combat Command, General Mike Hostage, candidly described MALE UAS such as the MQ-9 as being “useless in a contested environment” and vulnerable even against “countries with the most minimal air force.” Although MQ-9’s vulnerability may be exaggerated, the survivability of medium and large UAS in non-permissive scenarios remains a key challenge and poses major doctrinal and tactical questions for their use against peer and near-peer competitors.\n\nb) Small military and commercial UAS\n\nCheap, small commercial UAS have become staples for both Ukraine and Russia in the ongoing conflict. The military use of these smaller systems is not new. Terrorist organizations and non-state armed actors such as the Islamic State and the PKK Kurdish separatist group have repeatedly used commercial rotary-wing drones to conduct tactical ISR and drop small munitions against military targets in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey. Drug cartels and other organized armed militias around the world haven taken inspiration and developed similar low-tech, cheap “air capabilities.”\n\nBoth sides in Ukraine have deployed small commercial rotary-wing drones such as Chinese-made DJI’s Mavic and Matrice series, most of which have been sourced from crowdfunding. These UAS have become ubiquitous along the forward line of troops (FLOT) and provide crucial real-time ISR, battle damage assessment, and fire correction for artillery units thanks to full-motion video feed and thermal vision capabilities for night operations.\n\nEmploying many small, less expensive UAS often compensates for their limited endurance and vulnerability to EW and small-arms fire. Both Russia and Ukraine have also weaponized these systems, utilizing them to drop a variety of fin-stabilized munitions or flying them as improvised first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones to strike both equipment and personnel with remarkable effect.\n\nFPV drones, which are piloted with hand controllers and a headset that shows a live video feed from the drone’s nose camera, are cheaper, faster, and more maneuverable than other commercial quadcopters and allow for attacks beyond line of sight (e.g., behind cover and concealment, in trenches, in buildings).\n\nThe Ukraine-made Wild Hornet FPV UAS, for example, costs a fraction of the price of a DJI Mavic 3 ($400 vs $2,000), has a larger payload, and can be customized to function at different ranges and signal frequencies. This means the UAS is more resilient against EW and can be equipped with more explosives, including rocket-propelled grenades for specific anti-tank missions. By way of their cost-effectiveness and long-range, they have rapidly become key weapons to take out even the most modern main battle tanks like the Russian T90, at the cost of a few hundred dollars.\n\nRecent months have seen a surge in attacks by Ukrainian FPV UAS against Russian units and key systems (e.g., armor, fighting vehicles, artillery), with significant results. Furthermore, Ukraine is now introducing a new AI-powered FPV attack drone – called Saker Scout – that reportedly autonomously detects and pinpoints the coordinates of enemy equipment, day or night, even when concealed, and can also operate in swarms. If confirmed, this development would mark a major milestone in the deployment of autonomous systems in the conflict.\n\nRussian forces are mimicking their adversary and increasing the use and production of FPV UAS, often through crowdfunding and private donations. In April, the Kremlin announced a plan to order $1 billion worth of drones by 2026, and more than double that figure ($2.2 billion) by 2030. In recent months, Russia has been able to deploy more drones along the FLOT, improving situational awareness and the accuracy and speed of its artillery fire.\n\nOverall, in Ukraine, commercial drones have complemented and often replaced the work of other small military-grade UAS such as the Russian Orlan-10 and the Ukrainian Shark and Leleka-100, despite lacking key targeting capabilities like laser-marking and range-finding. Their vulnerability in heavily denied and EW-saturated environments means that the average life span of commercial drones, however, rarely exceeds a few days.\n\nThe panoply of UAS used by both Ukrainian and Russian forces has created widespread capability inconsistencies among units and has complicated management of training and standardization. To address this problem, both Ukraine and Russia are focusing on the production of a few, specific military UAS that can guarantee better performance at reasonable costs.\n\nUkraine has recently pushed into service the domestically produced Shark UAS, which offers high-quality ISR – including a ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) – at a low-entry price. The Punisher produced by UA Dynamics is another domestically made, privately funded small UAS which carries a small 3 kg payload, can fly up to 30 minutes, is GPS guided, and has a reportedly high success rate against a variety of Russian targets.\n\nIn a similar vein, Russia has expanded the production of the Orlan-10 multirole UAS, the workhorse of its drone fleet. The Orlan-10 can be equipped with a variety of different payloads, including EO/IR, laser imaging, detection and ranging (LIDAR) sensors, and electronic warfare capabilities depending on the mission assigned. Kyiv’s forces also employ military UAS provided by Western partners, including US-made ScanEagle and Puma ISR drones and Vector UAS produced by the German company Quantum Systems.\n\nUkrainian whole-of-society support\n\nOverall, Ukraine has harnessed drone technology more than its opponent. One reason for this advantage lies in Ukraine’s comprehensive approach to technological innovation, whereby the private sector, civil society, academia, and the government have joined forces to exploit a fertile domestic technological ecosystem to deliver quick solutions to the military.\n\nA prominent example of Ukraine’s innovation ecosystem is the “Army of Drones” initiative lead by the young Deputy Prime Minister for Innovation, Education, Science and Technology, Mykhailo Federov. The initiative includes rapid battlefield feedback loops between drone operators and developers, leveraging public and growing private funding, and most importantly scaling production and training.\n\nThis combination of bottom-up and top-down contributions fits into a broader approach that Ukrainian expert Hanna Shelest defines as Ukraine’s “third way” between the “total defense” model of Sweden, Finland, Singapore, and Switzerland, and the strongly hierarchical model of the United States, Russia, and China.\n\nAnother telling example of the Ukraine model is the Iziviz startup, which before the war was making drones used for inspections in the construction sector and is now providing UAS solutions to the Ukrainian military. Another case is the famous “Aerorozvidka” team, which began as a group of volunteer drone and IT enthusiasts in 2014 and is now a structured nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides drones and dedicated training to the Ukrainian armed forces. Many more private drone schools and NGOs are training thousands of UAS pilots for the army.\n\nThrough constant experimentation, rapid refinement, and exploitation of civilian quadcopters as well as other small military drones, the Ukrainian military has developed robust concepts of operations and TTPs that have been further refined against Russian troops since February 2022.\n\nThanks to the availability of small commercial UAS, Ukrainian forces down to the platoon level have access to persistent, tactical ISR. This means better situational awareness, improved coordination with nearby units, and more accurate artillery support, among other advantages. Better situational awareness can be leveraged to seize opportunities, while organic ISR capabilities allow small units to retain a fair degree of operational flexibility even when communications are disrupted.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the outsized role played by small drones has prompted unprecedented reforms in Ukrainian military force structure, including:\n\nthe creation of a full-fledged “drone army” comprising 60 new attack-drone squadrons – at least one in every brigade – led by separate staff and commanders;\n\nclassified updates to the country’s military doctrine to fully harness drones’ military potential;\n\nthe creation of new institutional bodies such as a new board within the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense that will coordinate the acquisition and supply of UAS, with a budget of $540 million in 2023.\n\nRussian experience with commercial UAS\n\nRussia’s approach to commercial drone technology by comparison seems more reactive and hampered by the same slow adaptation that has delayed the development of its UAS sector vis-à-vis its competitors. Despite the common use of small commercial quadcopters by Russian forces and measures taken to address the chronic shortage of tactical military-grade UAS among Russian units, there has been limited enthusiasm and action to integrate new drones, especially among senior military ranks.\n\nExperimentation among Russian forces in combat of commercial UAS has often been hindered and considered of secondary importance. A notable exception is the Sparta Battalion, a unit of the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR), which has embraced commercial drone technology and extensively used drones in its operations. While Russia has significantly scaled up UAS production over the past few months, soldiers have often resorted to buying their own drones rather than relying on military supplies.\n\nOverall, due to their low price, user-friendliness, and large availability, commercial drones will continue to play a role in Ukraine and other future conflicts alongside military-grade systems. However, commercial UAS typically have inferior capabilities in terms of range, payload, sensor quality, etc. and entail risks in terms of encryption and vulnerability to EW.\n\nc) Ukraine is leveraging other private sector technologies and support\n\nThe Ukrainian battlespace features a converging pattern of global big-tech companies, volunteer enthusiasts, NGOs, and the private sector playing a major role in developing solutions to military challenges and thus shaping military outcomes against an aggressor which enjoyed a tenfold larger defense budget on the eve of the invasion. Examples abound. Kyiv’s forces have exploited commercial satellite imagery provided by private firms like Maxar Technologies and Capella Space to monitor Russia’s buildup and improve operational planning. Google maps traffic updates have helped the Ukrainian military to track Russian movements and logistics.\n\nThousands of Starlink low-orbit satellite-based communication terminals have enabled Ukrainian units, civil authorities, and households to communicate despite Russia’s intense cyber and EW offensive. Starlink has also served as a key enabler for the use of UAS in heavily GPS-denied environments. Despite limitations imposed by the holding company, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Ukrainians have been able to find workarounds.\n\nAdditionally, drones have been integrated into a cloud-based comprehensive situational awareness digital map, called “Delta.” Developed by the Ukrainian military with seed money from a NATO trust fund, this tool delivers a detailed picture of the front line, providing the real-time position and information of both Ukrainian and Russian units, and tracking changes based on user inputs. Delta is accessible to strategic headquarters and tactical units alike and fuses information from multiple sources and distributed sensors behind and beyond the FLOT, including ISR from UAS, smartphones, radars, satellite imagery, and open-source intelligence (OSINT).\n\nThis innovative situational awareness tool, in turn, can feed specific software that assists intelligence gathering, observation, and targeting for artillery fires, tracking of enemy movements, and coordination among Ukrainian forces. Tools like GIS Arta for Artillery and the Android-based Kropyva “Nettle” App, for example, allow soldiers to quickly share the coordinates of enemy units, which are immediately engaged by the nearest artillery battery.\n\nThese software applications have dramatically expedited Ukraine’s targeting process, improving timeliness and effectiveness, and closing the gap in one of Russia’s expected military advantages. Kropyva, which was developed by Ukraine’s Army SOS NGO with US support in 2014, features a user-friendly interface that runs on Android tablets and can also be used by air defense and armored units at the tactical level. Logically, drones represent a core component of these applications.\n\nMore recently Ukraine drone developers have been focused on mitigating another Russian advantage, numerous powerful EW jammers. Supported with government-shared battlefield technical data, manufacturers and programmers are working on AI solutions to allow small drones to strike their identified targets even after loss of communications. Other enhancements include whisper quiet motors and designs to reduce visible and electronic signatures.\n\nThese examples confirm that the effectiveness of UAS depends on their integration into a complex battle management architecture that leverages the synergy between different capabilities and technologies, such as:\n\nfused, multi-source intelligence;\n\nartificial intelligence tools;\n\nelectronic warfare;\n\nresilient communications networks;\n\ntactical command and control;\n\nintegrated fires nets.\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, the creation of this battle management architecture is the result of years of unique, field-tested lessons learned, the creation of a specialized workforce capable of guiding such developments, and a whole-of-society response to Russian aggression.\n\nd) Loitering munitions\n\nLoitering munitions (LM) are another prominent air capability that has emerged in Ukraine and other recent conflicts. These systems generally combine the expendability of missiles with drones’ advanced targeting and sensor capabilities as well as longer endurance.\n\nLoitering munitions can be considered smart missiles which, rather than homing in on a preselected target via a preplanned route as traditional land-attack missiles do, orbit over a wide area in search of targets leveraging their multi-spectral sensors and energy-efficient propulsion.\n\nA key aspect of loitering munitions is their ability to condense and simplify the sensor-to-shooter cycle by incorporating sensing and striking capabilities on a single platform. This ensures the shortest time loop between target acquisition and engagement, thus making these platforms ideal assets to strike time-critical targets and targets of opportunity while providing persistent ISR.\n\nThe variety of available warheads and loitering munitions’ low electromagnetic and acoustic signatures allow for broad mission sets, including the suppression and destruction of enemy air defense (SEAD and DEAD, respectively). So far, available evidence suggests that these systems have been used via human-in-the-loop control, although several platforms include autonomous features like AI-enabled target selection and navigation. Autonomy – including swarming capabilities – is poised to become a more prominent characteristic of these weapons in the near future.\n\nRussian use of loitering munitions in Ukraine\n\nRussia has so far demonstrated superior LM capabilities, employing its own Kub and Lancet-3, along with the Iranian-made Shahed 136 and 131 variants. While available evidence shows mixed results for the short-range and lightly-armed Kub, the Lancet-3 – which has a range of 40 km and an endurance of 40 minutes – has become a thorn in Ukraine’s side, particularly for Ukrainian artillery units. Russia deploys the Lancet for counter-battery fire missions and against time-critical targets along the FLOT and at tactical depth.\n\nRussian forces usually employ the Lancet-3 along with Orlan-10 and Zala ISR drones, despite the former’s EO guidance and loitering nature, likely to maximize spotting opportunities and to have an independent, accurate battle damage assessment after the Lancet’s strike. According to the producer, the Lancet-3 can operate as a fully autonomous system, with AI-enabled navigation and autonomous target acquisition and engagement. This reduces the need for data and navigation links with the operator and renders the Lancet-3 more resilient against certain EW techniques (e.g., jamming, spoofing), explaining the remarkable success of this weapon.\n\nRussia has also deployed large numbers of the Iranian delta-wing Shahed-136 and lighter Shahed-131 (rebranded Geran 2 and Geran 1, respectively) systems. These platforms are more akin to slow propeller-powered missiles than loitering munitions, given their lack of EO sensors and their reliance on a combined global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial navigation system (INS) guidance suite to strike preselected stationary objectives. Russian forces have used the Shaheds to target power infrastructure and military installations with good results. The Shahed’s small radar cross section (RCS) and slow speed make it harder to detect at long range, especially for ground-based radars. Meanwhile its affordability and the integration of anti-jamming and anti-spoofing GNSS controlled reception pattern antennas allow its use in GNSS-denied environments.\n\nAs for other Russian precision weapons, both Lancet-3 and Shahed-131/136s loitering munitions recovered by Ukraine have been found to contain several commercial and dual-use electronic components produced by Western countries, with 82% of them manufactured by companies based in the United States. These include US-made Nvidia Jetson TX2 AI modules, contained in Lancet-3s and specifically designed for autonomous computing.\n\nUkraine is closing the loitering munitions gap\n\nUkraine is rapidly closing the gap with Russia in loitering munitions. So far Kyiv’s forces have mostly relied on foreign systems, including US-made Phoenix Ghost, Altius-600, Switchblade-300s and 600s, and the Warmate from Polish company WB Group. However, Ukrainian units are now receiving additional indigenous platforms like the RAM II, produced by the Ukraine company CDET, which is based on the Leleka-100 UAS, has a 30km range, and uses a 3kg multitype warhead. (9“RAM II UAV,” CDET LLC, https://ramuav.com/.)) The RAM II, which is roughly comparable to the Lancet-3, has already scored several successes against Russian mobile air-defense systems and other military equipment.\n\nUse of loitering munitions in other recent conflicts\n\nBesides Ukraine, loitering munitions were instrumental in securing Azerbaijan’s victory in Nagorno-Karabakh. Israeli-made IAI Harops were deployed en masse against helpless Armenian air-defense systems. One-way slow-flying munitions have also proven to be a formidable asymmetric weapon in the hands of non-state armed groups such as the Houthis in Yemen, which used Shahed-136s to repeatedly strike oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, defying interception from US-made Patriot air defense systems. However, context-specific factors such as terrain, crew proficiency, and the specific radar frequency settings of the air defense systems also play a major role in the success or failure of drone operations.\n\nFilling a niche between cruise missiles and armed UAS, loitering munitions provide great flexibility to accurately engage both line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight targets at operational depth and reduced costs compared to more expensive missiles. Furthermore, mass-deployed loitering munitions can saturate and overwhelm even the most modern air defense networks, proving ideal for SEAD and DEAD missions.\n\ne) Counter-UAS\n\nChallenges in defending against the UAS threat\n\nBoth Ukraine and Russia still experience significant challenges in defending their forces from UAS attacks. At present, there seems to be an overall lag between the UAS threat and available C-UAS solutions, especially when it comes to defeating large barrages of drones (or in the future drone swarms) simultaneously converging on single or multiple objectives. Furthermore, the proliferation of cheap weaponized commercial drones as well as long-range loitering munitions and their ubiquity across the battlespace question the sustainability of traditional air defense alone and underscore the need for more cost-effective, diversified, and distributed C-UAS solutions.\n\nWhile in Ukraine there is no available evidence (yet) of attack by swarming drones (i.e., large numbers of partially or fully autonomous interconnected and synchronized UAS), Russia has launched several mass-scale salvos of Iranian-made Shahed-136s munitions and different types of missiles against Ukrainian critical infrastructure, causing significant damage but failing to break Ukraine’s fighting spirit and cripple its overall energy resilience.\n\nAccording to a NATO C-UAS expert familiar with this issue, “the biggest challenge for Ukrainian air defenses is the detection and tracking of slow-flying and relatively small objects like the Shaheds.” The small radar signature and slow speed of these systems make them difficult to identify for Ukrainian air defenses, which at the beginning of the invasion included upgraded Soviet-legacy platforms like S-300PT/PS, and a variety of short-range air defense systems not optimized against UAS and similar threats.\n\nAt the tactical level, loitering munitions and weaponized rotary-wing commercial UAS are also producing a significant cumulative impact in terms of casualties, which add to those caused by drone-corrected artillery fire.\n\nUkrainian air defense\n\nThe provision to Kyiv of highly capable Western platforms like the US-Norwegian-made NASAMS and German-made Iris-T short-to-medium range air defense system has significantly improved Ukraine’s defense capabilities against the Shaheds, although at a high cost-per-interception ratio.\n\nBesides EW systems, compact C-UAS guns using high-power microwave and radio signals can be effective against rotary-wing commercial UAS at short range, although their irregular distribution along the FLOT and among units on both sides has limited their effects.\n\nTraditional anti-aircraft artillery such as Soviet-era ZU-23-2 and the German-made Gepard self-propelled radar-enabled anti-aircraft gun have offered a cheap and effective capability against slow-flying objects, including Shaheds. The downside is the limited number of such systems to defend critical infrastructure, population areas, and forces over an immense territory.\n\nThe recourse to simpler, improvised methods has proven a useful C-UAS alternative to anti-aircraft artillery. Besides camouflage techniques, Ukrainian forces, for instance, have discovered the effectiveness of simple metallic nettings for protecting artillery pieces and equipment against Lancet-3 loitering munitions, which get entangled and fail to properly detonate. The use of inflatable and improvised decoys, especially by Ukrainian forces, may also mitigate the threat from UAS and loitering munitions, underscoring the timeless importance of deception even on a sensor-saturated battlefield.\n\nRussian air defense\n\nRussia, for its part, has deployed an effective A2/AD envelope that has degraded Ukraine’s ability to deploy TB2 combat drones close to the forward line of troops. Ukraine’s initial success in the first weeks of the invasion is likely due to the fact that Russian A2/AD capabilities over occupied Ukraine were not sufficiently concentrated nor fully established.\n\nMoscow’s forces have had more difficulties denying the use of airspace over the Black Sea and the nearby Ukrainian southern coast, where TB2s have continued to provide uninhibited long-range ISTAR. A combination of geographical limitations, limited A2/AD assets, and the consequences of the loss of the naval command-and-control platform Moskva in April 2022 in which the TB2 played an important role can explain Russia’s less successful C-UAS efforts in the maritime domain.\n\nCapitalizing on its stronger EW capabilities, Russia has also hindered the use of smaller UAS, including commercial platforms, by dazzling their sensors and jamming their mostly unencrypted satellite navigation systems and communications links. The complementary use of different kinetic and non-kinetic interceptors like Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and man-portable C-UAS guns from both sides has created a situation where, according to some estimates, 90% of drones employed are lost and their average operational life is limited to three to six sorties depending on the system in question. A recent RUSI report, for instance, assesses that Ukraine may be losing up to 10,000 UAS per month, mostly to enemy EW.\n\nNevertheless, Ukraine has repeatedly managed to fly medium-size commercial and military-grade UAS deep into Russian-occupied territory or Russia proper, striking military bases in Crimea and an oil refinery in the Rostov region. A combination of gaps in Russia’s EW coverage, good route planning, and optimization of Ukrainian UAS against ground-based radars may offer a plausible explanation.\n\nMore generally, these examples underscore the threat posed by slow and low-flying UAS and the inherent challenge in guaranteeing a layered C-UAS and air defense coverage over large areas. In this respect, it is worth noting that factors such as personnel experience, systems readiness, and terrain represent other important variables of the C-UAS equation.\n\nAs the next section will explore, the introduction of directed-energy weapons (DEW) (i.e., laser and high-power microwave) promises to revolutionize and make C-UAS much more cost-effective.\n\nf) Lessons for NATO\n\nRecent examples of UAS employment in armed conflict offer valuable lessons for NATO regarding the likely trajectory of UAS technology and the role UAS will play in future military operations.\n\nThere are challenges to survivability and the element of surprise on a transparent battlefield. The pervasive surveillance of the battlefield provided by UAS and their connection to precision fires significantly constrain the use of surprise and introduce unprecedented challenges for the survivability of personnel at all operational levels, from the FLOT to rear areas. This aspect has huge implications for maneuver operations, force survivability and design, and the overall conduct of land warfare against peer adversaries.\n\nThe dawn of a new UAS-enabled targeting network is now. The fusion of UAS and precision fires (short to long-range, surface-based, or aerial) into a fully digitalized C4ISR architecture combines real-time situational awareness with precision-fire capabilities and drastically accelerates the targeting cycle, allowing for quick and accurate engagement of targets with devastating effects. As previously described, in Ukraine small commercial and military-grade UAS feeding into user-friendly situational awareness software such as GIS Arta and Kropyva (“Nettle”) have reduced the time between target identification and engagement by the nearest artillery units to a few minutes. A distributed, resilient, and scalable C4ISR architecture that fuses multiple ISR sources with C2 and fires platforms is essential for preserving information dominance and expediting the kill chain.\n\nUbiquitous small military and commercial UAS pose a serious threat. UAS employment extends beyond the traditional ISTAR mission set and includes strikes with smaller munitions, loitering munitions, battle damage assessment, and kamikaze missions at tactical range. The pervasive threat small UAS pose increases the stress for frontline units (requiring an unprecedented degree of vigilance and protection from the threat above or from any exposed flank) and degrades combat effectiveness of the less prepared units over time. As the conflict in Ukraine shows, the cumulative and extremely cost-effective impact of weaponized COTS drones in terms of casualties and destroyed equipment can be substantial and should not be underestimated.\n\nQuantity has a quality of its own. The high attrition rate suffered by UAS of all classes in contested environments underscores the need to incorporate large numbers of UAS (cheap and expendable when possible) for tactical and operational ISR at all echelons, and to have the industrial capacity and resources to replace them at scale. Self-protection capabilities for UAS to mitigate kinetic and non-kinetic threats are a recent development and will be likely introduced to enable survivability for more expensive and capable UAS. Investing in a balanced mix of expendable small and medium UAS and high-end MALE and HALE UAS will be important to account for their vulnerability to modern, layered air defenses.\n\nThe private sector has become an essential player and a key stakeholder in matters of defense and national security, with an increasing spillover of civilian technology and innovation in the military realm. The ability to harness innovation and quickly acquire, integrate, and proficiently employ novel technologies at scale are keys to success in modern warfare. Besides adequate resources, this ability and agility will depend on flexible institutional and bureaucratic arrangements to experiment and rapidly adapt, acquire, and integrate new technologies.\n\nDrones are not game changers by themselves. Despite the hype surrounding UAS, their effectiveness depends on their integration into a wider military ecosystem centered on mutually supporting and enabling capabilities, including combined arms formations; EW, cyber, and space capabilities; C4ISR (including multidisciplinary intelligence); and naval and air power capabilities (depending on type of UAS in question).\n\nAs the role of UAS in defense capabilities increases, other considerations for their successful integration include the recruitment and training of qualified human resources, ranging from operators to analysts and support personnel to leaders of UAS formations and other supported forces. Additionally, doctrine and concept development; material, digital, and operational standards; organizational structures; and dynamic civil-military cooperation will be needed. Establishing such a military ecosystem will not be easy, especially in a multinational environment like NATO, and will require investments, political leadership, and joint defense planning involving all military branches.\n\nUAS pose a greater threat when deployed in groups, including with other types of UAS and crewed systems. By employing sheer mass, collaborative, or swarm tactics, UAS can overwhelm and quickly change the cost-benefit ratio of traditional air defense systems, reveal their positions, and pave the way for the use of additional weapons and assets. Defense against drone groups and swarms requires not only cost-effective countermeasures but also the computational and processing capacity to rapidly detect, track, and intercept myriads of threats simultaneously.\n\nWhile employing UAS with crewed systems has not yet been tested in combat, militaries are widely experimenting with human-machine teams in concept and capability development. Human-machine teams promise to significantly enhance both offensive and defensive capabilities of the forces that employ them, but will also require data and network architectures, training, and leader development to exploit the human-machine potential.\n\nC-UAS is essential across all domains and at all echelons. As drones (including loitering munitions) become cheaper, expendable, more capable, and more numerous on the battlefield, the use of traditional air defenses to counter them becomes technically less viable and less and less cost-effective. As such, a combination of passive (concealment, electromagnetic discipline, dispersion, nets) and active countermeasures becomes essential against UAS and other smart munitions. Active countermeasures must ideally include a layered combination of traditional kinetic effectors, including anti-aircraft guns, and non-kinetic means like EW, directed-energy weapons, and other drones.\n\nThe roles and missions of drones are expanding. Combat UAS have expanded options for SEAD/DEAD missions, close air support, air-to-air engagement, and even air combat besides their traditional ISR, targeting, and strike functions. Stealthier next-generation UAS equipped with long-range air-to-air and air-to-surface munitions will be able to penetrate hostile airspace and conduct counter-air missions, electronic warfare support, escort, and in-depth interdiction, alone and in close cooperation with crewed aircraft. Furthermore, UAS will perform resupplying and air refueling missions, provide advanced tactical data link relay, improve anti-submarine warfare, and release other drones and loitering munitions. Finally, other technological improvements, such as in sensing, computing (onboard and cloud), AI, lasers, and next-generation networks, will further expand the roles of drones in C4ISR, air and missile defense, and targeting in general.\n\nPart II – Assessing NATO’s Current UAS Capabilities\n\nIndividual allies own a wide variety of UAS capabilities, and the alliance collectively owns and operates NATO’s Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS). Despite NATO efforts to encourage procurement and capability development and to promote common standards and enabling capabilities, NATO has too few drones for a high-intensity fight against a peer adversary. It would be severely challenged to effectively integrate those it has in a contested environment.\n\nNATO’s drone capabilities are diverse and vary among allies. Many countries possess advanced drone systems ranging from small rotary-wing UAS to large fixed-wing platforms that can be used for a variety of military operations. While the quantity and quality of UAS contributions from member states to meet NATO’s intelligence collection needs are increasing, allied efforts to transfer capabilities under NATO control or to promote multinational capability development are often constrained by national concerns including limited availability, loss of control, or intellectual property rights and fear of market share loss\n\nEqually important, NATO does not have an allied joint doctrine covering the employment of UAS in contested scenarios, although allies are working to develop one. The lack of NATO doctrine has inevitable implications for the definition of capability requirements, concept of operations (CONOPs), common TTPs across the alliance, and ultimately achieving interoperability.\n\nIndeed, a shared doctrinal document is necessary to steer the alliance’s development of its drone capabilities, at a time when new operational requirements call for a shift from remotely operated, single-mission platforms to more complex, autonomous, multi-mission systems, and crewed-uncrewed platform integration.\n\nAir and land domains\n\nThis section delves into the major UAS capabilities of NATO nations in the air and land domains, which have substantial overlap in terms of platforms, sensors, and mission sets. While large UAS tend to be operated by national air forces for traditional air power tasks, small and medium UAS may be operated by air, land, or special forces for a variety of air and land power tasks.\n\nThus, for this report’s purpose, examining UAS capabilities by size is more useful than attempting to do so by an artificial division between their employment in air and land domains. More specifically, the section examines UAS capabilities in each of the three NATO UAS classes – from larger Class III UAS down to mini and micro systems in Class I. The NATO UAS classification is illustrated in the table below.\n\nAlliance Ground Surveillance\n\nProgram overview\n\nThe Alliance Ground Surveillance program represents the sole UAS capability directly owned and operated by NATO which provides critical and long duration Joint ISR (JISR) platforms to the alliance. The AGS fleet, which comprises five RQ-4D “Phoenix” UAS, fixed and mobile ground and support segments, and advanced sensors, is stationed at the Sigonella Main Operating Base in eastern Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe AGS fleet is operated by the NATO AGS Force (NAGSF), which is under the operational command of NATO’s Air Command stationed in Ramstein, Germany. From Italy the UAS deploy along the alliance’s borders to perform all-weather, long duration, wide-area terrestrial and maritime surveillance, collecting vast amounts of data and providing in-theatre, near real-time situational awareness to allied commanders.\n\nAGS’ origins date back to 2009 when the program memorandum of understanding was signed by fifteen participating member states and the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance Management Agency (NAGSMA) was established. In 2012, the North Atlantic Council decided to collectively cover the costs for operating AGS for the benefit of the alliance, paving the way for the AGS acquisition contract with the RQ-4D’s manufacturer Northrop Grumman. In 2021 the AGS achieved initial operational capability (IOC).\n\nThe alliance needed the AGS capability “to fill a critical intelligence gap” that had been previously addressed by the contributions of single countries, resulting in inevitable lags and dissemination issues. The RQ-4D Block 40 platform was selected because of its state-of-the-art sensor package, particularly the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and ground moving target indicator (GMTI) functionalities provided by a multifrequency active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, which allow NATO to monitor vast areas and track potential threats in near real-time.\n\nThe AGS’s sensor suite derives from the advanced multi-platform radar technology insertion program (MP-RTIP) on board the US RQ-4 Global Hawk UAS, but has been modified to meet the specific requirements of the alliance.\n\nThe “Phoenix” UAS, which according to NATO has a maximum ceiling of 18.2 km and a range of more than 16,113 km, provides near-instantaneous data transfer to NATO’s commanders through an extensive suite of line-of-sight and beyond-line-of-sight, long-range, wideband data links. Its impressive ceiling and standoff ISR capabilities allow the AGS system to collect critical intelligence while remaining outside the engagement zone of most air defenses, although this advantage significantly drops against peer adversaries such as Russia and China. However, as the force commander US Air Force Brigadier General Andrew Clark, NATO AGS Force Commander, has pointed out, “the NAGSF is much more than a flying unit” and comprises a critical ground and support infrastructure, with a multinational team of analysts that conducts the processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) of the raw data and information received from the UAS.\n\nNAGSF provides an “organic collection capability for ground radar imagery and moving target patterns,” in-depth analysis, and dissemination of intelligence products across the NATO enterprise, relying on mobile ground control stations and tactical C2 workstations for deployed forces.\n\nAGS’ operating system is “platform agnostic” and thus designed to be interoperable with other NATO assets and platforms, allowing for seamless integration with other intelligence-gathering capabilities. For example, NAGSF analysts “can combine the [high-resolution 2D] radar imagery provided by the RQ-4D Phoenix with other types of imagery intelligence (IMINT) like full-motion video (FMV) and ELINT/SIGINT products received from other high-altitude platforms such as the US U2 aircraft,” to obtain a comprehensive picture of the operational environment.\n\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has given new impetus to the cultivation of this capability as Russia’s attack “accelerated the need for persistent ISR for the alliance,” prompting NAGSF “to fly twice the amount envisioned upon reaching initial operational capability and delivering over 11 thousand intelligence products since February 24, 2022.” This intelligence output includes the integration of other intelligence-gathering capabilities, with only 25% of intelligence products originating from NAGSF organic collection and the remaining 75% deriving from external sources, including allied nations’ platforms and open-source intelligence.\n\nNATO AGS Force should reach full operational capability (FOC) in 2024. With a total authorized force of around 600 personnel NAGSF is set to become the “clearinghouse of NATO’s ISR.” However, this NATO capability also faces several challenges to achieving its full potential.\n\nChallenges for NATO’s AGS\n\nThe first problem lies in a lack of institutional knowledge concerning the organization’s role and the system’s capabilities, which could result in inappropriate or insufficient tasking.” This indicates the need for more effective coordination among NAGSF, Allied Command Operations, and other NATO bodies, including NATO Headquarters and the Joint Force Commands, in defining the intelligence requirements which shape the tasking of NAGSF’s assets.\n\nThe need to better define taskings overlaps with the constraints in the federated PED process caused by the lack of human resources and the exponentially increasing amount of data to be analyzed and disseminated. AI-based analytical tools, along with more contributing analysts, can help reduce the burden on personnel and expedite the entire PED cycle. At present, specific AI tools provide automatic target identification during NAGSF PED process, but on a limited scale.\n\nThe second challenge concerns NAGSF’s future and its relevance in the medium to long-term. The RQ-4 is an aging platform without an active industrial production line. This raises the issue of diminishing manufacturing sources (DMS), with inevitable implications in terms of spare parts and life-cycle sustainment. In September 2022, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $13 million contract for sustainment of the AGS’s radar and mission management computer, to be completed by September 2023.\n\nAt the same time, reengineering options appear unfeasible. While the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), which works to facilitate and harmonize the procurement of UAS across NATO, has encouraged industry partners to provide an assessment of the RQ-4 product line’s future, discussions within the alliance on medium to long-term sustainability through substitution or replacement have not yet started.\n\nFurther delays to decision-making stand to increase the likelihood of an ISR capability gap in the long term. Apart from addressing an aging platform, NAGSF’s future relevance could also be enhanced by leveraging NAGSF’s potential to command and control additional national contributions of JISR systems and units, or by leveraging its training cadre and analytic capacity to train analysts from across the alliance on a rotational or temporary basis. Sensor gaps exacerbate this limitation. According to the NAGSF commander, the NATO AGS Force would greatly benefit from SIGINT and long-range EO/IR payloads, which are currently missing and whose contribution must be provided by other platforms with inevitable implications for the TCPED process.\n\nThe third challenge involves the RQ-4D’s survivability, which many US military sources have acknowledged as being limited against modern air defenses. For instance, in 2019, a US RQ-4A Global Hawk was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile (SAM) when it was flying at a relatively high-altitude (~6.7 km) in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. According to US Air Force Chief of Staff, General Charles Q. Brown, the RQ-4 operates very well “in uncontested and low-threat [contexts] where the United States and its allies enjoy superiority across all domains of warfare [but] cannot compete in a contested environment.”\n\nIndeed, the RQ-4D does not have self-protection capabilities. As the AGS remains NATO’s primary organic JISR asset, the alliance may soon need to assess possible solutions to increase its survivability and medium to long-term viability. Near-term upgrades may be possible, but eventually substitution or replacement will be necessary.\n\nClass III UAS\n\nA limited, but growing allied inventory\n\nExcluding the AGS program, NATO’s UAS capabilities are based on the systems allies possess and make available to the alliance. While the war in Ukraine has accelerated the development and acquisition of UAS among NATO nations, the speed and level of commitment varies across member states. MALE UAS represent one of the categories where such disparities are most tangible. Only ten countries currently operate these large UASs. Of these ten, seven – including the US – employ the MQ-9. Germany and Greece (and soon the Czech Republic) use the Israeli-built IAI Heron TP.\n\nTurkey operates several domestically manufactured MALE drones like the TB2, the Anka, and the more advanced Akinci. Turkey recently introduced a maritime version of the TB2, the TB3, which is capable of take-off and landing aboard Turkey’s recently commissioned amphibious ship the TCG Anadolu (more on this will be in the maritime domain section that follows). At the same time, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Greece, Norway, and prospective NATO member Sweden may have reached preliminary agreements or started discussions to purchase the MQ-9’s upgraded version.\n\nOther member states such as Albania, Poland (already operating MQ-9As), and Romania have inked deals with the Turkish company Baykar for the acquisition of Bayraktar TB2 UAS. The TB2 has also been the focus of discussions between Baykar and NATO members Hungary, Portugal, and Slovakia.\n\nFrance, which already operates the MQ-9A, will soon receive fourteen new Patroller MALE UAS produced by the French multinational Safran. The NSPA is increasing its focus on the MALE category and will soon provide sustainment support for the TB2 to one ally. The Agency does not currently deal with multinational UAS procurement but is trying to incentivize this option among allies. At the moment, though, most countries continue to favor national acquisitions.\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Spain, and their respective industries are collaborating on the “Eurodrone program,” an ambitious EU-funded initiative that should deliver an initial batch of 20 MALE multi-mission UAS systems to the four countries starting in 2028.\n\nThis mixed but fluid picture of Class III UAS operated by allies derives from a combination of factors, including fluctuating and diverse defense budgets, capabilities duplication and industrial competition, and different priorities vis-à-vis drone technology across the alliance. As a result, bringing consistent MALE UAS capabilities to bear will most likely require years, considering the various systems’ production and delivery times and their later integration into national militaries and NATO force structures.\n\nMore and higher quality assets needed\n\nWhile better-equipped allies can provisionally compensate for NATO’s collective UAS capability gaps – as already done with other capabilities – the increasingly complex threat scenarios the alliance will face require a much larger number of interoperable UAS capable of integration in NATO command or force structure than currently available. In the words of NATO’s Assistant Secretary-General for Intelligence and Security David Cattler, the war in Ukraine shows that “if you haven’t invested in sufficient UAS capabilities, you’re likely to have serious deficiencies against someone who has made the investment.”\n\nTo meet this need, it is vital that NATO countries increase their respective defense budgets to meet at least the 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) target. For those NATO countries unable to allocate additional resources and purchase more expensive UAS, stopgap options, including leasing, can fill capability gaps in the short term. Leasing is often disregarded but is a valid solution because it also comes with training and maintenance, thus laying the groundwork for a smoother integration of disparate systems.\n\nAs an example, General Atomics Aeronautical Systems has leased MQ-9As to Poland pending the arrival of the system’s upgraded version purchase by Warsaw. Furthermore, the same company offers a lower-cost service, contractor-owned, contractor operated (CO-CO), whereby General Atomics owns and operates the UAS while the ISR data is controlled by the customer. Hence, a joint, multinational CO-CO scheme may represent an advantageous option for smaller member states with budget constraints to deploy key high-end UAS capabilities.\n\nMALE drones provide not only persistent, high-quality standoff ISR but also EW and strike options, enhancing the warfighting utility and flexibility of allied UAS. Over the past few years, the US has deployed a limited number of MQ-9 UAS along NATO’s eastern flank on a rotational basis, including in Estonia, Poland, and Romania. In the case of a full-fledged confrontation with Russia, however, a handful of MQ-9 would hardly be sufficient, considering the likely high attrition from hostile surface-to-air missiles and intense offensive EW and cyber operations.\n\nRussian threat capabilities underscore the importance of robust and homogeneous MALE UAS capabilities across the alliance. The threat also highlights the need for a combination of high-end yet cheaper, more expendable systems (i.e., TB2, TB3) and next-generation autonomous “wingman” platforms able to conduct collaborative operations with crewed aircraft. The mission set for this class of drones will vary to include deep strike and reconnaissance into enemy territory, air combat and close air support, and interdiction in support of ground or maritime operations, among others.\n\nEqually important, the possibility of equipping MALE UAS such as the MQ-9 and the Turkish-made Akinci with air-to-air missiles and AI capabilities for advanced onboard computing and rapid target processing and engagement also expands their mission sets. MALE UAS so equipped could be used in counter-air, combat air patrol (CAP), and air combat roles in the future. At the same time, the integration of next-generation EW suites and standoff precision-guided munitions can pave the way for a more prominent use of these UAS in SEAD and/or DEAD missions.\n\nClass II and Class I UAS\n\nWhile MALE class UAS primarily support missions at the strategic and operational levels, medium and small drones, which have both comparatively limited duration and range, have become the most common tools for situational awareness and ISTAR at the tactical level. Capabilities in these classes of UAS are consistent across the alliance and revolve around multiple platforms. Examples range from the ubiquitous US-made RQ-11B Raven, RQ-20 Puma, and ScanEagle tactical UAS to the hand-launched Israeli-built Skylark to a variety of other national or foreign systems.\n\nThe “Support Partnership” initiative, a legal framework coordinated by the NSPA, offers cooperative support arrangements for ten countries for the acquisition and sustainment of military off-the-shelf UAS from nano/micro to tactical types and more. According to Doug Heintz of NSPA, the Agency’s portfolio mainly covers platforms from the US and Israel, and a few from Europe, but it will soon include Turkish systems as well.\n\nClass I and II UAS usually have an endurance of approximately 60 minutes and a range of roughly 30-40 km, and trade payload for portability. As such, they are used for ISTAR purposes up to brigade-level units. Medium-size UAS such as Portugal’s Ogassa OGS 42 and Norway’s FX-450 provide greater capabilities, with ranges varying between 100 km and 250 km, an endurance of several hours, and the ability to fulfill the ISTAR needs of brigade-size units.\n\nSeveral NATO countries have also expanded their UAS fleets with mini and micro UAS such as the 100 Black Hornet personal reconnaissance system (PRS), which provides squad-level immediate and covert situational awareness and has an endurance of 25 minutes. Mini and micro UAS are typically employed by special operations forces (SOF) and specialist units for very short-range ISR purposes.\n\nCertain member states are also investing in small bomber drones and loitering munitions. France, for example, has recently launched several projects to equip its armed forces with different remotely controlled munitions and attack drones, including a multi-rotor UAS capable of dropping up to twenty 40mm grenades.\n\nItalian special forces will soon receive Hero-30 loitering munitions, which are produced by the Israeli firm UVision and have a range of 15 km, to meet an “urgent mission requirement.” Other countries like Poland are betting on domestically designed loitering munitions such as the Warmate, while Estonia and Lithuania have placed orders for US-built Switchblade-300 and 600 loitering munitions.\n\nAs a means for target acquisition, medium and small UAS have become essential tools for improving artillery accuracy and shortening the sensor-to-shooter cycle. At the same time, the battle damage assessment role of UAS tends to be underestimated, despite its critical importance for evaluating operational effects and avoiding wasted time and additional resources to obtain the desired effects on a target.\n\nIn light of the extremely high attrition rate these systems suffer in Ukraine and the open-source data regarding their availability among member states, the alliance has nowhere near the minimum number that would be required in near-peer or peer adversary scenarios. This means that allies should stockpile hundreds of medium UAS and several thousand small UAS – at the very least – along with the capacity to rapidly replace them if necessary. The war in Ukraine should be a wake-up call for NATO allies to significantly expand their medium and small UAS inventories and corresponding manufacturing capacity, with a balance between expendable and reusable systems.\n\nMaritime domain\n\nIncreasingly, the alliance is focusing on the role and use of UAS in the maritime domain. Maritime unmanned systems (MUS) include UAS, along with uncrewed surface and underwater vehicles (USV/UUV), and represent ideal assets which can operate in challenging sea conditions while offering several advantages.\n\nFirst, they allow allies to conduct persistent, long-range maritime ISR and engagement over larger areas and with lower electromagnetic signature assets.\n\nSecond, they diminish the need to deploy sailors or marines into harm’s way, thus reducing the risk of casualties.\n\nThird, they tend to be cheaper to field than crewed platforms and are less logistically intensive, integrating seamlessly with other systems with less personnel.\n\nFurthermore, they allow for greater modularity and scalability in terms of payload integration compared to crewed aircraft.\n\nImproving communications and interoperability\n\nWhile large UAS have been a regular component of NATO Unified Vision exercises, these events have focused on the interoperability of JISR tools and systems in general. For the maritime domain, allies have embarked on a multinational effort focused on MUS specifically, including capabilities, concepts, and interoperability.\n\nThe Maritime Unmanned Systems Initiative, a multinational framework launched in 2018, now includes sixteen member countries and supports the introduction of flexible and more interoperable maritime unmanned vehicles into allied navies. This initiative revolves around seven main areas of cooperation, including integration of MUS into NATO policies, technical standardization to enhance interoperability, doctrine development, joint training and support, and engagement with industry.\n\nInteroperability and doctrine development deserve special attention at a time when technology is evolving fast and the threats to the alliance are multiplying. To consolidate these two areas, the MUS Initiative (MUSI) countries participate annually in operational experimentation conducted by NATO and NATO nations like the Robotic Experimentation and Prototyping augmented by Maritime Uncrewed Systems (REPMUS). In September 2022, MUSI nations participated in NATO’s Dynamic Messenger operational experimentation (OPEX) exercise series. The REPMUS experimentation, hosted by Portugal, focuses on capability development and technical interoperability with MUS in military maritime operations.\n\nThe Dynamic Messenger (OPEX) co-hosted by NATO’s Maritime Command (MARCOM) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT), expanded REPMUS achievements in MUS integration in NATO naval operations, and added the enhancement of TTPs in detecting and clearing mines, conducting anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and monitoring sea lines of communication, among other tasks.\n\nThe Dynamic Messenger exercise was the first NATO exercise solely focused on MUS and their integration with crewed platforms. The exercise allowed for unhindered experimentation with MUS by NATO maritime commanders and operators (including Standing NATO Maritime Group 1) and the integration of dual use emerging and disruptive technologies in cooperation with academic and industry partners.\n\nBeyond the trials of more than 120 different multi-domain uncrewed assets, these exercises provided a unique opportunity to test sensor and communication fusion between different systems within C2 architectures whereby drones can “speak the same language,” autonomously cooperate, and interact with the headquarters.\n\nThe value of the Portuguese Navy’s innovation in MUS development and experimentation was recently confirmed by NATO. “The Portuguese Navy’s Maritime Operational Experimentation Centre – located at Troia, the facility that hosts ‘REPMUS’ and ‘Dynamic Messenger’ – has been assigned as a Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) test center, including being tasked with developing AI, autonomy, data, and new materials technologies.”\n\nThe NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) collaborated with partners in the NATO Science and Technology Organization research project aimed at standardizing communications among different C2 systems and uncrewed systems operating in communications limited environments. This team developed the Collaborative Autonomy Tasking Layer (CATL), a set of languages for enabling multi-domain autonomous tasking and data sharing. The CATL developments help inform the ongoing STANAG 4817 effort, which aims to standardize multi-domain command and control.\n\nAccording to the CMRE’s Director Catherine Warner, these federated, multi-domain C2 architectures “will allow human command and machine control.” This has enormous implications for interoperability and the role of autonomy in improving both human-machine interaction during operations and the utilization of uncrewed systems – including UAS – in communications-denied environments.\n\nMaritime tasks for UAS\n\nAmongst the UAS that were tested during Dynamic Messenger, the Austrian S-100 Camcopter was employed in an anti-submarine role, using a dedicated data relay payload to transmit information from various sonobuoys to the command center ashore and then facilitate the detection and classification of possible enemy submarines. In recent years the anti-submarine task has regained prominence in the alliance’s military agenda due to Russia’s increased submarine capabilities and activities in both the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Seas.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, specialized long-endurance UAS with tailored ASW sensors and autonomous features can carry out some of the traditional ASW tasks of crewed maritime patrol aircraft such as protracted submarine detection and tracking missions, expanding NATO’s ASW options and capabilities.\n\nMore generally, UAS can leverage their endurance and long-range multi-type sensors to provide unmatched maritime ISR and engagement over vast areas at cheaper costs compared to crewed aircraft. Other tasks may also include extended-range early warning and detection of incoming anti-ship missiles, including maneuvering sea-skimming missiles that are more difficult to counter.\n\nFor maritime forces to employ UAS in maritime air defense tasks, they require a rapid TCPED process as well as autonomous capabilities. According to naval warfare expert Steven Horrell, the alliance will not be able to capitalize on the advantages offered by drones in the maritime domain “without the creation of a dedicated joint fusion architecture – to be organized in regional fusion nodes – that improves intelligence sharing and makes critical information available to all allies in the shortest possible time.”\n\nAnother area of experimentation is the use of UAS for maritime resupply and refueling purposes (including ship-to-shore). For example, both the Royal Navy and the US Navy have recently tested UAS systems in heavy lifting and transport missions over medium and long distances.\n\nThe US Navy is also at the advanced trial phase of the Boeing MQ-25 Stingray, an air-to-air refueling (AAR) UAS that will significantly extend the operational range of US carriers’ crewed aircraft fleet, including F/A-18 Super Hornet and F-35C fighter jets. Once in service, the MQ-25 will also provide key support for the air wings of allied navies.\n\nNational maritime UAS capabilities\n\nAt the national level, the US remains the major actor in terms of maritime UAS capabilities, though several NATO countries are expanding their UAS fleet in this domain, including France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. The French Navy has started the integration of the fixed-wing Aliaca UAS aboard its future offshore patrol vessels and surveillance frigates. The Aliaca drone has a three-hour endurance and provides high-quality, all-weather ISR up to a range of 50 km thanks to its gyro stabilized EO/IR payload.\n\nThe French Marine Nationale is also in the final testing phase of its “Système de Drone Aérien pour la Marine” (SDAM) program, which is based on the Airbus VSR-700 Naval vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS. This program aims to deliver a VTOL UAS capability for future frigates of the French Navy. The VRS-700 has an impressive range of 150 km and is outfitted with a maritime surveillance radar, an Automated Identification System (AIS) receiver (transponder-based ship location system), and an optronic payload optimized for use in the marine environment.\n\nTurkey is one of the NATO countries investing most in UAS capabilities, including in the maritime domain. The Turkish Navy commissioned the amphibious assault ship TCG Anadolu – the country’s largest military ship and the first of its kind to provide a Class III maritime UAS unit afloat. The TCG Anadolu should become fully operational in 2025 and will host an improved and folding-wing version of the combat-proven TB2 UAS, called TB3. The TB3 will give Ankara a BLOS offensive drone capability thanks to a satellite communication link and a heavier payload (280 kg) compared to its land-based brethren.\n\nThe TCG Anadolu is also set to carry the Bayraktar Kizilelma uncrewed fighter jet, a highly maneuverable stealth UAS capable of conducting offensive offshore and onshore missions, including SEAD and DEAD. The landing-helicopter-deck (LHD) class Anadolu will pave the way for new concepts and operational uses of UAS in maritime operations, making Turkey the first country and NATO ally to deploy a full-fledged drone strike group along with an amphibious assault force.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Italy are also currently improving their maritime UAS capabilities. Earlier this year, a contract was signed with the Austrian company Schiebel for the acquisition of S-100 Camcopter rotary-wing UAS that will operate from the Royal Navy’s Type 23 frigates and provide long-range high-performance ISTAR along with a capable multi-sensor fusion software. The Royal Navy will also trial General Atomics’ “Project Mojave” short takeoff and landing (STOL) UAS onboard its aircraft carriers, which could pave the way for the future integration of a STOL version of the MQ-9B UAS developed by the same US company.\n\nItaly, a NATO member strategically located in the Mediterranean and itself an operator of the S-100 UAS, will bolster its naval UAS capabilities with new acquisitions over the next few years, according to its 2022-2024 Defense Planning Document, although the specifics of these capabilities remain unclear. The Italian Navy has also commissioned a feasibility study for a drone carrier ship, following in the footsteps of its Turkish counterpart.\n\nOverall, however, there continues to be a tangible imbalance in the distribution of UAS maritime capabilities across the alliance, with repercussions for ISR coverage in key areas such as the Black Sea. While the rotational deployment of US MQ-9s and NATO RQ-4D AGS is partially filling the maritime ISR gap in the region, coastal countries such as Romania and Bulgaria lack long-range UAS assets to conduct persistent maritime ISR and engagement in their territorial waters and beyond.\n\nAs a result of this maritime capability gap, NATO may have difficulties in detecting and tracking the movements and activities of the Russian Black Sea fleet in case of confrontation. Despite the loss of the Slava-class Cruiser Moskva in April 2022, Russia remains the dominating naval power in the Black Sea region and continues to pose a credible threat to NATO along its southeastern flank.\n\nCyber and space domains\n\nCyber and space represent both enabling domains for UAS as well as avenues for attack. Cyberspace (along with the electromagnetic spectrum) enables connectivity between UAS and command modules (ground, afloat, or airborne), operators, analysts, and other C2 nodes, sensors, and effectors, including other UAS (for coordinated or collaborative operations). Space provides data and multiple services such as positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT), information (e.g., meteorological, environmental) and satellite-based communications and guidance.\n\nThe fast-paced integration of UAS into military operations into the physical domains of land, air, and sea requires support from the cyber and space domains. UAS are interdependent with space and cyber, including from a security perspective as they rely on satellite navigation, the use of wireless communication, onboard sensing technology, and remote control. These conditions make them vulnerable to cyber and electronic warfare attack.\n\nCyber Domain\n\nUAS systems are extremely vulnerable to cyberattack. In the cyber domain, attacks can target all components of the UAS, including supporting satellites, the ground control station (GCS), and the communication signal between the GCS and the drone itself. Attacks can include the interception of downlink data and information from the UAS to the operator in order to obtain intelligence, the disruption of the drone through malicious code to impair its functions or capabilities, the intrusion in or disablement of the GCS operating system, and the jamming or spoofing of the navigation and communication signals. These are the most frequent types of attacks, though others are possible.\n\nAn example is the hacking of a stealthy US RQ-170 Sentinel UAS by Iran in December 2011 while it was conducting an ISR mission deep in Iranian airspace. Although it remains unclear what method Iranian forces used, they managed to disrupt the communication and navigation signals between the operator and the UAS, bringing down the system largely intact onto Iranian territory.\n\nNavigational spoofing — which falls between cyber and EW techniques — could have been a plausible cause. In another case from 2009, Iranian-backed Shiite insurgents in Iraq were able to breach the operating system of a US MQ-1 “Predator” UAS and view its live feeds using a mass-market software program.\n\nHowever, the cyber domain is also essential for enabling drone operations. For example, well-prepared cyberattacks can be launched ahead of SEAD and DEAD missions, disrupting the opponent’s C2 network and degrading the functionality and readiness of its air defenses, paving the way for UAS kinetic strikes or close air support missions in hostile territory.\n\nRobust cybersecurity protocols ensure the resilience and protection of C2 and navigation links between the UAS, the operator, and the broader military ecosystem into which drones are integrated. As NATO’s reliance on UAS grows, the alliance’s cyber capabilities must keep pace with evolving and increasingly advanced hacking techniques to effectively safeguard allied C4 networks while providing the necessary support to military operations.\n\nSpace Domain\n\nAs with cyberspace, space is a critical operational domain for the alliance’s security and military operations, playing a key role in the following areas:\n\npositioning, navigation, and timing, which enables precision strikes, tracking of forces, and search and rescue missions;\n\nearly warning, which helps to ensure force protection and provides vital information on missile launches;\n\nenvironmental monitoring, which enables meteorological forecasting and mission planning;\n\nsecure satellite communications, which are essential for consultation, and command and control;\n\nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, which are crucial for situational awareness, planning, and decision-making.\n\nAs UAS across the alliance become more and more integrated into a complex military ecosystem, they inevitably need space support and services, not least in terms of resilient navigation, secure communication, and accurate intelligence for better operational planning and execution.\n\nIn denied environments, onboard autonomy can effectively obviate the jamming of satellite navigation by exploiting sensor fusion capabilities. However, the disruption of satellite communication links by enemy EW, for example, hampers the operator’s control of the drone and risks compromising the mission. While a communication and data link are not required in fully autonomous systems, its interruption represents a major challenge as long as UAS are employed with a human-in-the-loop or human-on-the-loop approach (more on that later).\n\nAs noted by NATO’s Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence David Cattler, space assets also provide critical ELINT, IMINT, and SIGINT resources for the effective use of UAS. Exploiting space-based intelligence can enhance and better focus drone employment with positive implications for the overall military effort.\n\nLeveraging allies’ space capabilities\n\nAt present, NATO countries operate an estimated total of 1,809 satellites, inclusive of civilian (national or multinational), commercial, military, or intelligence assets. In February 2023, NATO announced plans to establish the alliance Persistent Surveillance from Space (APSS) initiative, a multi-year, multi-domain, and multinational effort to boost space-based surveillance and intelligence for the alliance, thus improving its situational awareness and collective decision-making.\n\nTwo characteristics of the APSS initiative stand out:\n\nIts multinational and cooperative nature leverages existing and future space assets in allied countries and connects them in a NATO virtual constellation called “Aquila.”\n\nIts data-centric approach will allow the APSS to integrate data from both government-owned assets and commercial space contributions.\n\nThis multinational and collaborative approach will allow NATO allies lacking space capabilities – 15 countries – to access space-based intelligence and communications, while improving and expanding information sharing across the alliance. Moreover, this approach will enhance interoperability by pushing allies toward the use of common platforms (i.e., sensors, software, etc.) and standardized TTPs.\n\nThe growing importance of LEO satellites to UAS operations\n\nAt the same time, the direct involvement of private space companies with Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites enhances the resilience and effectiveness of the alliance’s activities and operations, especially in terms of services and signal availability. Compared to geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-earth orbit (MEO) satellites, LEO satellites are smaller, operate at lower altitudes (500-2,000 km), and provide signals with increased bandwidth and at low latency rates thanks to their shorter distance from the earth’s surface and constant non-stationary orbit.\n\nThese features make LEO satellites ideal for communications applications, including military ones. While LEO satellite-based communications (SATCOM) are vulnerable to jamming and other EW methods, the use of vast networks of satellites — also known as constellations — ensures greater resiliency against EW compared to fewer GEO satellites.\n\nAs discussed in the first part of this study, Starlink’s LEO SATCOM have allowed Ukrainian drone operators to elude the bulk of Russian jamming attacks and continue drone operations, although Russia forces have adapted and had some successes in limiting the use of Starlink terminals by Ukrainian units. The increasing military role of LEO satellites will also impact complex BLOS drone operations. In December 2022, the US company General Atomics flight-tested an MQ-9A equipped with a LEO satellite communications C2 system, which will enable high-latitude pole-to-pole operations — otherwise constrained via GEO SATCOM — and provide resilient connectivity to and from the aircraft.”\n\nAccording to the same company, LEO SATCOM should “decrease operational costs” and allow for cheaper payload integration in the future thanks to a smaller and more modular hardware footprint. This development is especially important for the alliance considering the increasing role the MQ-9 will play in the UAS fleets of NATO allies in the medium term.\n\nAdditional advantages of LEO SATCOM include:\n\nthe provision of a backup data and C2 link — set on a different frequency — in case the main satellite connection is jammed or lost, ensuring robust redundancy during BLOS operations;\n\nfaster and larger data transmission by virtue of high-throughput, low-latency communications.\n\nA higher order of data transmission would facilitate the use of UAS in a multi-domain sensor-C2-shooter architecture, shortening the kill-chain cycle during BLOS missions, and possibly enabling cross-cueing detection as well as the sharing of tracking information between space-based and airborne sensors to improve long-range ISR and strike.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the NATO APSS or a future similar NATO initiative could eventually include a component modeled after the US Space Force’s Transport Layer, a novel LEO constellation that “will provide assured, resilient, low-latency military data and connectivity worldwide,” exploiting the unprecedented connection performances provided by Optical Inter-Satellite Links (OISLs).\n\nHowever, the reliance on LEO SATCOM is not without risks. Various EW techniques like jamming and spoofing against the signal transmission, and cyberattacks against both the ground infrastructure and the satellite add to challenges emanating from the complex logistics and network infrastructure required by LEO constellations. These issues underscore the need for more robust and resilient protection standards for space assets that are used for military purposes, both in terms of hardware and software with built-in security protocols.\n\nBased on the above considerations, space is now more than a mere enabling domain for UAS operations in contested environments, and NATO countries that seek exquisite UAS capabilities should consider the critical role played by space in UAS development and employment.\n\nEnabling efforts\n\nEnabling policies and standardization\n\nNATO has agreed to an impressive number of policies covering UAS development and employment. These policies include:\n\nNATO’s Total System Approach to Aviation (addresses both crewed and uncrewed systems);\n\nNATO policy for unmanned aircraft systems;\n\nNATO policy for civil/military aircraft operating in support of NATO or NATO-led missions and operations;\n\nNATO Remote Piloted Aircraft Readiness Initiative (R2i). NATO R2i includes a strategy and implementation plan and focuses on UAS piloted by remote control.\n\nIn addition to NATO policies, NATO nations have agreed to an array of standardization agreements (STANAGs) regarding UAS (more on this later). Yet, in spite of NATO policy and standardization efforts to harmonize NATO UAS development and operations, diverse national approaches to capability development and acquisition, along with a multitude of proprietary UAS, associated payloads, and data-exchange protocols in use by NATO nations, significantly complicate interoperability. NATO STANAGs and policies represent a foundation for alliance interoperability, but implementation and follow through by individual allies is often lacking. Exacerbating a lack of implementation is the absence of a verification process to assure NATO military authorities of overall UAS interoperability, readiness, and responsiveness.\n\nDigital transformation\n\nDigital transformation is a broad endeavor launched by the alliance that focuses on the enabling technologies, technical infrastructure, and people needed to “increase the speed, security, and effectiveness of NATO critical processes, from C2 and communications to data and intelligence analysis and dissemination, in order to enhance interoperability and decision-making.”\n\nDigital transformation will shape the over-arching C4ISR architecture as well as sensor-C2-shooter networks in which UAS will operate in the future. Digital transformation will be the enabling foundation for future alliance Multi-Domain Operations. Security and interoperability standards will enable rapid integration of various national and NATO UAS systems into forces, networks (i.e., an internet of military things) and operations, as well as dynamic tasking and synchronization of cross-domain or multi-domain effects.\n\nWhile this critical endeavor aims to prepare NATO for future demands, including multi-domain operations against a peer adversary, its ambitious and comprehensive nature may be a challenge for NATO to fund, implement, and sustain.\n\nAchieving digital transformation’s goals will be essential for the use of UAS in collaborative roles and human-machine teaming, but also a challenge, considering the latency associated with increased encryption in data links, among other issues. More generally, NATO must be able to protect and transmit information in a coalition environment, such as multi-domain operations, where data is stored in a cloud architecture, leveraged at the "
