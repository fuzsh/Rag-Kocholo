        "text": "The abbreviation SIGINT - Signals Intelligence - stands for collecting and analyzing of information from radar- and radio-signals.\n\nThese “monitored” signals come from radar and radio sources that belong to other nations and are carried out from ground stations, ships, satellites and aircraft.\n\nThe core purpose of signals intelligence is to learn about threats, actions, capabilities, and intentions of a nation's adversaries. SIGINT serves as a window into what military and other threats a nation may need to defend against and, thus, can also become a roadmap for the most effective courses of action to explore or implement to assure readiness.\n\nModern Signals Intelligence operations take advantage of advanced technology modalities such as algorithms because signal detection from massive amounts of stored data is like searching for a needle in a haystack. An operator controlled autonomous agent finds incoming signals, automatically determine signal type, and provides an analyst with reasons why a determination was made.\n\nAlgorithms help SIGINT systems automates the low-level detection and classification tasks. This frees up military personnel to focus on higher level tactical decision making. This way, the system becomes another team member, with a supervising human in the loop to authorize the appropriate military response.\n\nIn addition, through SIGINT automation, a commander can gain an “EM signature picture” of his forces as they are arrayed in the battlespace. This way, he can glean valuable information on his own EM signature and use that information to improve or implement additional passive and active actions to increase survivability.\n\nThe origins of SIGINT can be traced back to the first world war when British forces began intercepting German radio communications to gain intelligence about their plans. This led to the use of cryptography to conceal the content of radio transmissions, and as such, cryptanalysis became an integral part of SIGINT as well.\n\nBut as electronic warfare and wireless technology has evolved, so have approaches to signals intelligence. Automation and artificial intelligence (AI), for example, have greatly improved communications planning and SIGINT capabilities. An automated algorithm detects and identifies signals in sensor data much faster than a highly trained operator.\n\nWant to learn more?
