        "text": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Research: Air to Ground Channel Modeling\n\nThe air-ground (AG) channel has classically assumed a continuous line of sight signal from an elevated antenna in an open clear area, along with very narrowband signaling. Future AG communication systems may not have the luxury of all these conditions, and so new models are required for the dynamic AG channel. Our work with NASA has gathered the largest number of AG channel responses in history, in seven different ground site settings, and from this data we have created multiple models which will be used by academics, industry, and standards groups."
