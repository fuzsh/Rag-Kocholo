        "text": "TReX™ is a software and COTS hardware-based signal emulator. It is an easy to setup hardware and software suite that enables users to conduct true testing and evaluation of EW systems and techniques as well as enable effective training of warfighters and systems with representative signals of interest (SOIs).\n\nTReX™ hardware can be easily set up in a lab, outdoor range, or deployed environment. TReX™ systems enable users to transmit and receive high-fidelity representations of many commercial and non-commercial representative emitters, and test new SIGINT and EW techniques against their waveforms. Users may observe and validate the effects of applied SIGINT and EW systems and techniques on the system via TReX™’s command and control (C2) module.\n\nTrainers can create simulated SIGINT and EW engagements within the TReX™ software and measure the effects on enemy devices by monitoring bit-error-rate (BER), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and throughput. Simulated threat waveforms can be quickly modified and/or saved as new signals to equip operators with everchanging threat signals.\n\nTReX™ can be used to practice CONOPs in a network simulated environment. Multiple TReX™ devices can be remotely controlled and communicate with a single, C2 software application. Real-time and post-session data can be used to plot threat effectiveness and improve planning for future strategies by mission command. Users can create long duration and/or repeatable scenarios for quantified testing in the lab or field. TReX™ has the capability to mimic specific SOIs including but not limited to:\n\nFast, frequency hopping tactical radios\n\nFixed-frequency tactical radios\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) and Remote-Controlled Model Aircrafts (RCMA)\n\nGNSS, DVB-S, DVB-S2, and DVB-T signals\n\nTDMA/CDMA bulk transmitters\n\nNon-commercial representative modems\n\nComms modulations: FSK, BPSK, BPSK-DSSS, OFDM, and QAM\n\nPulse emitters and radar signals\n\nWe are made up of a diverse team of experts in engineering design and trainers with operational SME experience in EW/SIGINT. Our engineering team will work with you to scale all hardware and software components to fit your specific needs. Our radio frequency training can be tailored for multiple audiences, including operators and decision-makers. Explore our training resources below."
