        "text": "The significance of a comprehensive architecture\n\nWhether it is the armed forces or law enforcement, fixed-wing and rotary aircraft are routinely used to assist in intelligence gathering for operations as well as provide situational awareness to units deployed on the ground or at sea. These airborne platforms can also provide early detection of numerous threats using onboard sensors, whether that is potential terrorist activity near a patrol base, a build-up of military forces at a border, or a boat illegally smuggling people or narcotics.\n\nBecause of their strategic importance, it is vital that an aircraft tasked with ISR has a comprehensive architecture that allows it to collect, process and transmit intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) data in real-time to support operational decision-making. This means advanced sensors that can gather detailed intelligence data – be it cameras, radar or signals intelligence tools (or a combination) - as well as mission systems that can process and fuse the large amounts of data collected using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms.\n\nFinally, once that data has been collected and processed, it needs to be disseminated across the intelligence chain to be actioned by the appropriate force. This dissemination requires target-oriented analysis as well as advanced encrypted communication and data link systems.\n\nThe challenge of system integration and how to overcome it\n\nBringing together all these advanced systems onto an aircraft is not simple; in fact, it is an extremely complex engineering task that requires highly specialist engineering teams with immense knowledge of system integration. If the systems are from different manufacturers all over the world, then it makes the job even more complex.\n\nSystem integration is one of the most challenging aspects of aerospace and defence programmes, often introducing higher risk and complexity for projects that often lead to delays or cost overruns. These challenges could eventually lead to a suboptimal platform that does not meet requirements, especially if subsystems are incompatible with each other or additional equipment is needed.\n\nHENSOLDT is overcoming these challenges by creating bespoke suites for manned and unmanned aircraft, which fully integrate systems into an architecture that enables the platform to perform whatever mission the customer requires and to match the concept of operations (CONOPS) they have developed. This could be for maritime surveillance, border patrols, or combat ISR missions using converted commercial aircraft.\n\nHart compares this to the consumer smart device market, from which customers are more likely to use multiple smart devices from the same company that share the same operating system and interfaces, rather than buy outside the “ecosystem”. If a consumer stays within the company ecosystem, the experience is likely to be far more seamless and the devices will provide additional capabilities when they interconnect.\n\n“Our objective is to do the same, so the radar passes parameters to the electro-optic system, to the computer and to the datalink, so you don’t have any incompatibility or integration issues,” said Hart.\n\nFrom equipment provider to solutions provider\n\nTo mature its airborne architecture solutions, HENSOLDT is pioneering a new airborne systems integration lab that can simulate the entire aircraft from a systems perspective.\n\nBy migrating the embedded software that runs on real-life sensors onto a server, the HENSOLDT team is able to simulate sensor feeds such as radar or electro-optics virtually in the lab. This is then coupled with a flight simulator that accurately recreates terrain all over the world along with a range of weather conditions.\n\nThe integration lab can be used to demonstrate capabilities or to train operators, but it can also be used as a development environment to test and iterate new capabilities, particularly in emerging areas such as artificial intelligence and the development of algorithms for data fusion. In addition to the lab, HENSOLDT has developed several integrated airborne architectures that are optimally suited for key missions, which are now being offered to customers for a range of manned and unmanned aircraft.\n\nThese can bring together a range of HENSOLDT sensor technologies – including the PrecISR AESA radar, ARGOS-II electro-optics, and Kalætron signals intelligence suites – as well as mission computers featuring advanced processing, and wideband data links such as the HENSOLDT Lygarion solution or standard military-grade Link 16.\n\nThe HENSOLDT sensor suite can be further enhanced with Artificial Intelligence capabilities in two specific areas. Firstly, Object Detection, Classification and Tracking (ODCT) is a machine learning algorithm that processes ground and airborne video imagery in order to differentiate different objects. This has multiple applications such as detecting drones against background clutter such as buildings, foliage as well as moving objects such as vehicles, birds in flight and other aircraft. Other applications include identifying abnormal aircraft and surface vessel traffic patterns in a congested radar environment where criminal activity may be taking place.\n\nSecondly, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is an AI capability that analyses in real time as well as scheduled recording multilingual variety of traditional and social media and communications activity in order to recognise emerging patterns such as insurgency activity or civil unrest and street riots. The AI based training algorithms allow processing unstructured and raw data into structured information. This provides an ultra long-range sensor capability whereby such hotspots can be geo-located and communicated to law enforcement agencies, military operators and ISR aircraft.\n\nFor military aircraft, system integration will also include self-protection suites that protect against missile and ballistic threats that are present in today’s combat zones."
