        "text": "1.3. Previous Survey Works\n\nAlong with the growing number of novel solutions for wireless networks during the last years, several recent surveys focusing on the interplay of AI/ML and wireless communications have been provided. Various studies have proposed the application of ML for improving the performance of wireless networks. The authors in Reference [22] provide a brief description on the use of DL in an architecture based on the aerostack framework, which is an aerial robotics architecture consistent with the common components related to perception, guidance, navigation, and control of unmanned rotorcraft systems, with different robotic agents consisting of different abstraction levels of unmanned aerial robotic systems, like social, reflective, and deliberative layer, among others. The DL algorithms are employed in three directions: feature extraction, planning and situational awareness, and motion control. The classification is limited to the learning type of the algorithm and the field of application for aerial robot systems which use specific sensors. Next, the survey in Reference [23] studied the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for several network and communication aspects, such as network access and rate control, cashing and offloading, security and connectivity preservation, routing, resources, and data collection. In some cases, the UAV is considered as an agent for the cellular network, like a base station, a sensor, a mobile, a user, a network controller, or a scheduler. Deep Q-network (DQN), deep Q-learning (DQL), and liquid state machine (LSM) are some of the learning algorithms used for the aforementioned issues for the UAV scenarios. A rather comprehensive survey from the exclusive angle of DL applications in mobile and wireless network is depicted in Reference [24]. The authors provide classifications for different attributes, such as mobile big data, data and mobility analysis, user localization, network control, and security. However, the use of UAV networks is not taken into consideration. At the same time, several of the DL techniques that are discussed can be of importance to UAV networks. Then, the survey in Reference [25] provides a brief overview of ML techniques for wireless big data analytics. One of the described applications is related to UAVs, still without discussing AI/ML aspects. Another work discusses, among others, that the AI/ML algorithms on edge devices in 5G and beyond 5G networks are necessary for the development of 6G networks [26]. The critical applications of self-sustaining networks (SSNs) in 6G requires low-latency, high-reliability, and scalable AI, along with a reliable infrastructure, relying on the integration of UAVs and ground network nodes.\n\nIn networks consisting of ground-based and aerial vehicles, there have been various surveys presenting possible applications of AI/ML. First, the exploitation of AI for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) application is given in Reference [27], including comparisons of the AI algorithms. Moreover, in autonomous driving, the survey categorizes the most widely used AI techniques in swarm intelligence, ML, DL, expert systems and planning, scheduling, and optimization, where one may find similarities to the prominent UAV classification. Some of the suggested open source or proprietary software tools can also be used in UAV communications, but most of them consider applications like safety, network congestion, navigation, security, content delivery, and edge computing. Furthermore, the paper in Reference [28] gives an overview of 5G communication aspects for V2X, UAVs, and healthcare use-cases. More specifically, UAV-based wireless networks aspects are mostly discussed for disaster management purposes without considering ML enhancements, while ML is mainly considered for healthcare applications in the area of anomaly detection for patients. Next, the authors in Reference [4] present the integration of UAV networks for 5G and beyond communications. Several newly founded techniques are considered (e.g., non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave band (mmWave) transmissions), while a classification of different techniques is performed in terms of physical layer; network layer; and joint communication, computing, and caching, taking into consideration the BS type and the number of UAVs. However, only a limited number of works on the application of ML in UAV networks is included. Then, the survey in Reference [6] offers a thorough overview on using UAVs for cellular communications in view of experimental and simulation channel studies that have been performed in such networks, along with prototyping. In the latter, only two platforms are presented making use of ML algorithms for trajectory and placement. The rest of the paper is dedicated to standardization, regulation, and security aspects, while ML is only included as a possible future research direction for UAV networks.\n\nFrom the cyber-security point of view, one may find a limited number of survey papers, studying AI/ML. The article in Reference [29] provides a well-structured review of UAV networks from a cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective. The three CPS components in the UAV networks that the survey analyzes are communication, computation, and control. Regarding AI/ML techniques, the authors classify open-source software projects and libraries, mainly focusing on the machine vision area. The authors briefly mention the use of ML and RL at the physical layer and routing, correspondingly, at the computation and communication components. Regarding the computation and control components, intelligent algorithms are discussed for computation-enhanced flight and formation control. The survey in Reference [30] does not focus on communication issues, while the authors provide a mapping of UAV network connectivity, QoS, security, design challenges, and requirements for cyber-physical (CP) security applications. The application of ML is presented for object detection and image recognition, as well as for interesting future research areas, such as collision avoidance, spectrum sensing, channel estimation, and energy management. The main goal of Reference [31] is to outline the wireless and security challenges that arise in the context of UAV-based delivery systems, real-time multimedia streaming, and intelligent transportation systems. To address such challenges, artificial neural network (ANN)-based solution schemes are introduced. The authors consider the security at higher communication layers. Regarding the wireless challenges and relevant AI/ML solutions, each use case follows a different approach and ANN-based solution. Also, the authors provide a discussion on physical layer communication issues, such as interference management. Finally, the work in Reference [5] provides a comprehensive study on the use of UAVs in wireless communications and networks from the CP security perspective. Two main use cases of UAVs are investigated: aerial wireless BSs for 5G and beyond applications that complement emerging wireless communication systems and cellular-connected users that use existing wireless infrastructure. For each use case, key challenges, applications, and fundamental open problems are noted, along with the mathematical tools and techniques needed for addressing the challenges. Regarding the latter, the tutorial provides only a small section discussing the emerging field of ML, primarily for trajectory and path planning.\n\nThe majority of surveys either focus on ML for different wireless network environments or foresee the integration in UAV-based networks, discussing its future potential. Nonetheless, three recent works can been identified as more similar to this study. First, the survey in Reference [32] focuses on AI for robotic applications, comprising both ground-based nodes and UAVs. In such scenarios, UAVs can improve the connectivity and security of multi-robot teams towards efficiently performing their tasks. AI/ML techniques for aerospace robotics include (i) ANN for delay, connectivity and security improvement, as well as channel prediction; (ii) particle swarm optimization for determining UAV trajectory; (iii) DL for improved UAV connectivity; and iv) ML for user content request prediction from the UAVs. Then, the article in Reference [33] focuses on a multi-layered communication system comprising space (satellite), air (UAV), and ground segments, namely space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). It is found that DL, mainly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with different DL architectures and training methods can improve the network performance. Next, the tutorial in Reference [34] provides a classification of ANNs for wireless communications. Among several applications (e.g., caching, multiple radio access technologies (RATs), and IoT), the authors refer to UAVs and discuss RL for coverage, connectivity, trajectory, resource, and path planning optimization. A cellular use case for applying AI is considered, where UAVs are part of cache-enabled BSs. Finally, recurrent neural network (RNN) and especially echo state network (ESN) algorithms at the conceptor are studied for mobility prediction.\n\nDeparting from these works, in this survey, we focus on the application of a broad set of AI/ML techniques for UAV-based communications without focusing on particular AI/ML categories or UAV applications. More specifically, the following contributions are given:\n\nAn exhaustive overview of AI/ML solutions from all possible categories and their application in UAV-based networks is presented.\n\nA wide range of UAV-enhanced wireless communication issues, ranging from physical layer and resource management aspects up to trajectory design and caching is studied, while wireless security and public safety applications are comprehensively discussed.\n\nOpen issues are identified for both networking and security areas, stimulating further research for the application of AI/ML techniques in UAVs-based networks.\n\nprovides brief descriptions of the relevant surveys and the research areas and scope in the context of AI/ML that they discuss.\n\nTable 1\n\nReferenceShort DescriptionScope of AI/ML on UAVLi et al.

Generally, the importance of distilling intelligence in wireless communication networks has been outlined in numerous works. In Reference [24], the authors have observed that the ever increasing heterogeneity and complexity of mobile networks has made monitoring and management of network elements intractable. Moreover, ML allows systematic mining of valuable information from mobile data and automatically identifies correlations that are too complex to be derived by human experts. Likewise, the work in Reference [33] has noted that, in wireless networks, ML enables the wireless devices to actively and intelligently monitor their environment, exploiting mobile data for training purposes in order to learn, predict, and adapt to the evolution of environmental features, including wireless channel dynamics, traffic and mobility patterns, as well as network composition, among others. In this way, they can proactively act towards maximizing the probability of satisfying different performance metrics. It can be seen that ML takes as input data from different sources and through the application of various learning techniques, i.e., supervised/unsupervised, deep or reinforcement learning, allows the network to adapt to the wireless environment in a dynamic and autonomous manner. Thus, especially in networks consisting of a large number of nodes, such as those consisting of swarms of UAVs [35], centralized coordination and excessive overheads that must be acquired and exchanged among the network nodes are avoided, paving the way for distributed network optimization where intelligence plays a key role.\n\nMoreover, provides a classification of UAV-based communication network aspects, where the adoption of ML techniques can enhance their performance compared to conventional optimization techniques. Stemming from this taxonomy, the rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we survey communication aspects related to the physical layer, such as channel modeling and interference management. In Section 3, we survey security and safety issues, while in Section 4, we present ML-based researches related to resource managements and, in Section 5, we survey applications related to UAVs positions. Finally, Section 6 presents open issues and research challenges in the context of ML applications in UAV-enabled communications and Section 7 concludes this article.\n\n2.1. Channel Modeling\n\nThe accurate prediction of channel behaviour in wireless networks is of utmost importance, especially in highly mobile environments. The selection of appropriate channel models is necessary for performance evaluation, network planning, and UAV trajectory design among others. Towards this end, various ML solutions have been proposed for predicting the channel behaviour and UAV received signal strength (RSS). ML techniques are capable of assessing the wireless conditions without requiring a vast amount of data sets, as it is the case in channel modeling from extensive measurement campaigns. Motivated by the scarcity of UAV measurements in real environments, the authors of References [36,37] use ANNs and ensemble methods for predicting the RSS at the UAVs. First, in Reference [36], a multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) NN is used and trained by measurement data. Novel training methods are developed based on the combination of self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) algorithms with the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) method. The sequential application of DE and then LM method offers better initial starting weights compared to the case of random weight generation, resulting in better solutions and faster convergence. Therefore, various new algorithms for ANN training can be devised employing DE in the exploration phase and LM in the exploitation phase. The authors propose to use the success-history-based adaptive DE with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE) algorithm for ANN training. L-SHADE self-adapts the control parameters and performs linear population size reduction. Performance comparisons with four DE algorithms showed that L-SHADE provides the best performance due to its unique features, being a promising solution to extract channel model characteristics without relying on large amounts of measurement data. The study in Reference [37] focused on ensemble methods for UAV RSS prediction. The operation of ensemble methods was based on training combinations of supervised learning base learners, i.e., methods such as decision trees or NNs, among others. This work extended the NN-based algorithm of Reference [36], developing a new ensemble method relying on five base learners, namely support vector machines (SVMs), GP, ANNs, least squares boosting method (LSBoost), and bagging prediction. At the same time, the ML-based solution adopts the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) evolutionary algorithm, inspired by the swarm movement and foraging of salps in the oceans. In greater detail, the behavior of salps is modeled by dividing them in two groups, consisting of leaders and followers. The first group includes salps with higher objective function values, while the second group contains salps with lower objective function values. The proposed models are validated by appropriate performance indicators, i.e., the mean absolute error (MAE), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE). It was shown that, by using the ensemble method, the accuracy of channel modeling can be improved when compared to NN-based approaches, proving that ensemble learning can be a valuable tool to solve problems in the field of electromagnetics.\n\nIn another line of research, the study in Reference [38] examines real-time three-dimensional (3-D) wireless channel modeling of the air-to-ground channel among UAVs and ground nodes, using unsupervised learning. In greater detail, a clustering technique is employed to analyze the 3-D wireless channel LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) channel states based on RSS measurements by the UAV. Additionally, PL and shadowing parameters are derived, formulating an appropriate temporary 3-D channel model. As an online learning approach is followed, changes in the communication environment are integrated in the temporary 3-D channel, increasing its accuracy. As shown in the performance evaluation, employing an online learning method allows temporary 3-D channel modeling to be derived according to dynamic changes of the wireless environment. As a result, channel modeling accuracy can be significantly increased in UAV communication scenarios. Nonetheless, the impact of shadowing is not considered in this work, limiting the accuracy of the 3-D channel modeling.\n\nIn Reference [39], a method that optimizes the positioning of UAVs acting as aerial relays in air-to-ground wireless networks was presented. This method enables the autonomous path planning of UAVs by exploiting a finely structured radio map. Since this map cannot be easily obtained in practice due to the complex terrain in common urban propagation areas, a joint clustering and regression problem using a maximum likelihood approach was formulated based on the K-segment ray tracing model. In particular, an ML-based iterative algorithm was employed, acting as a channel predictor in an effort to reconstruct the radio map from a limited number of training samples via a kernel-based method. The results pointed out that the proposed method requires almost as few as one-tenth of training samples to achieve the reconstruction performance of the K nearest neighbor (KNN) baseline method, while it can recognize the propagation segments and, hence, optimizes the placement of the UAVs.\n\nFurthermore, the accurate modeling of PL prior to the installation and operation of a wireless network is a complex process requiring data from a detailed link budget analysis. Currently, radio engineers mainly adopt deterministic and stochastic methods for estimating signal attenuation due to PL. It must be noted that, in irregular terrains characterized by vegetation, hills, and buildings, PL models provide limited accuracy of signal attenuation. In order to separate the impact of these factors on the PL, the work in Reference [40] relied on geo-referenced satellite imaging and 3-D point cloud in order to extract the environmental characteristics through 3-D image classification and to feed them in ML-based PL modeling for improved wireless network deployments. Therefore, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and ANNs are employed, resulting in a simulation environment identifying features from the environment, such as tree foliage. Then, these features are used to adjust the RSS calculation through the PL model. Performance evaluation was based on MAPE, revealing that the proposed PL prediction method significantly outperformed existing empirical PL models, such as COST 231-Hata and log-normal, due to the consideration of environmental irregularities. In greater detail, empirical PL models exhibited RSS estimation errors within 6.29–16.9% from the actual RSS measurements while the proposed ML-based solution significantly reduced the estimation error to 4.26%. Still, the effect of buildings was not considered, limiting the applicability of this method in urban settings.\n\nAiming to study the application of ML on PL prediction for the air-to-air channels, the authors of Reference [41] proposed various ML-based PL models for urban environments. The considered ML algorithms consisted of the random forest (RandF) and KNN. RandF is an ensemble method stemming from decision trees. In order to perform classification, it collects classifications from all the decision trees and selects the most popular prediction as its output, forming a strong classifier from a large number of weak or weakly correlated classifiers. KNN performs supervised learning based on a similarity measure, calculating the distance between points on a graph in order to solve classification or regression problems. Then, using ray-tracing to generate training and testing data, the prediction accuracy of the ML-based PL models was compared with the empirical Stanford University Interim (SUI) and the COST231–Walfisch–Ikegami models. It was shown that the ML-based models achieved better air-to-air PL prediction by relying on training data related to propagation distance, UAV altitude, elevation angle, and LoS conditions. Moreover, among the ML-based approaches, RandF offered the best prediction results while the most important data was that of path visibility with propagation distance and elevation angle, also having significant influence. Another study focused on PL prediction for UAV networks communicating with ground nodes in Reference [42]. However, departing from radio-frequency (RF) PL prediction, the authors examined instead, PL and delay spread prediction in mmWave channels, employing the RandF and KNN ML algorithms. Moreover, the problem of requiring massive data sets for training of the ML algorithms is mitigated through transfer learning based on limited data sets and training results that were acquired from previous training phases. From the results, it is concluded that the proposed methods offer reduced mean square errors when compared to Okumura–Hata and COST 231–Hata models.\n\n3.2. Public Safety Applications\n\nDue to the flexible deployment of UAV networks, several public safety applications rely on flying nodes, acting as BSs for establishing communication after a disaster or as monitoring stations for assessing the condition of critical infrastructures and environmental attributes. In Reference [56], a defense system for tackling malicious UAVs was proposed. The defense system employed various UAV detection techniques, such as jamming, GPS spoofing, transmission of hacking signals, and laser shooting. Then, its interaction with malicious UAVs was cast as a dynamic defense game, where the appropriate defense policy was chosen, considering the attack mode of the UAV and the significance of the protected area. Towards this end, the author adopted the Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model the defense policy selection. Also, Q-learning is used to determine the optimal defense policy without requiring any prior knowledge of the current attack mode of the UAV in the dynamic game. The simulations that were conducted indicated that the proposed RL-based malicious UAV interception scheme reduced the risk rate of the protected area and improved the defense system’s utility when compared to a random defense policy.\n\nThen, in disaster mitigation and management scenarios, where rapid changes in the environment usually occur, UAV swarms can be employed for effective and real-time mapping of complex and large-scale zones. In this regard, ML-based modeling and simulation techniques for an UAV swarm system with autonomous capabilities were presented in Reference [35] and the decision-making procedures were distributed among all the swarm members. In particular, an efficient mapping procedure based on genetic algorithms searching on a population of potential solutions was proposed to optimize the information gathering and to minimize the percentage of unmapped sites in the area of interest.\n\nNext, the work in Reference [57] focused on the issue of UAV hijacking and compared various ML approaches to analyze and classify the behavior of different UAV pilots. To generate data, twenty UAV pilots were employed to fly the same UAVs in three specific trajectories. Pilot identification relied on the way that each pilot controlled the UAV and not on their specific actions, i.e., the structure, cadence, and timing of command patterns. By assuming that the pilots had to carry out identical maneuvers and lossless recording of their behavior, fast identification was possible using five ML classifiers, i.e., linear discriminant (LD), quadratic discriminant (QD), SVM, KNN, or RandF. From the comparisons, it was concluded that the RandF classifier provided the best accuracy at around 90%, exploiting simple time-domain features. More importantly, the classification exhibited low complexity, and thus, it was suggested that it can be performed on-board the UAV for achieving real-time interception and prevention of hijacking. However, the accuracy is strongly related with the pilot and the flight trajectory, as well as the pitch, roll, and yaw effects. Moreover, thrust control signals exhibit varying levels of significance for pilot identification.\n\nIn addition, the authors of Reference [58] aimed at integrating UAV surveillance capabilities with a cloud-computing environment and an appropriate user interface (UI) for efficient emergency response. More specifically, the authors assumed limited computing and energy capabilities at the UAV and, so, computation offloading of the acquired data was performed at the cloud. Security issues in this scenario are related to the interception by malicious nodes of the UAV data, threatening their privacy, confidentiality, and integrity. In order to overcome such concerns, the end-to-end solution is based on on-site video data collection by the UAV, which employs a keyframe selection algorithm for video compression and latency reduction. Moreover, secure wireless communication is established using a secure component at the UAV, enabling the cryptographic protocols of the compressed video stream. Then, initial real-time evaluation of the collected data is performed at the cloud and CNN-based detection is developed for achieving an improved trade-off amongst detection accuracy and latency. The performance of proposed solutions is evaluated on a hardware platform based on an Infineon Larix drone and a Raspberry Pi connected to a physical secure element (SE) responsible for the cryptographic protocols, a camera, and a graphics processing unit (GPU) server. Performance evaluation showed that secure communication, fast detection, and a user-friendly UI can facilitate the emergency response in civilian applications. Moreover, a trade-off between an accuracy above 65% of the mean average precision and a processing time below 150 ms can be achieved when data processing relies on the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence metric instead of root mean square distance (RMSD).\n\nAnother critical application was examined in Reference [59], aiming to overcome privacy and public safety concerns arising from the use of UAVs by amateurs over sensitive areas. Towards this end, a distributed system was proposed for identifying and locating dangerous UAVs based on wireless acoustic sensors and SVM-based ML algorithms. Then, the plethora of RF characteristics and telemetry data of amateur UAVs was analyzed using a software-defined radio (SDR) platform adopting a SVM-based ML approach, deriving classifiers to specify if a transmitted packet came from an UAV. After the telemetry protocol was decoded, the system transmitted control commands to the UAVs and, if they insisted on their malicious behavior, aggressive surveillance UAVs were deployed. From the simulations, it was suggested that the proposed ML-enhanced SDR platform enables efficient and proactive protection of the sensitive area against trespassing UAVs. More specifically, the acoustic detection performance of UAVs adopting the SVM-based solution is satisfactory but demands relatively high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Also, the acoustic location performance is severely affected by Gaussian noise and erroneous signal latency measurements. Finally, the identification of a telemetry data packet presents significant fluctuations, depending on the bit error rate.\n\nFinally, the study in Reference [60] proposed the deployment of low-cost surveillance UAVs equipped with smartphones for small boat detection, which is of high importance in search and rescue as well as border patrol operations. More specifically, the UAVs transmitted images using the cellular infrastructure to a distant cloud server. In the cloud, a CNN was trained and detected various classes of small boats as well as people in order to trigger security alerts. Moreover, the proposed system included an automatic identification system (AIS) for comparing images of the detected boats and for comparing its GPS position with a marine traffic database, classifying it either as a registered or unregistered boat. For enhanced security of the signal transmission, various encryption mechanisms were integrated in the system, guaranteeing data integrity while jamming attacks were mitigated through Gaussian noise overlapping. More importantly, the proposed light NN offers up to 99% accuracy of object detection, greatly facilitating the tasks of search and rescue as well as border patrol operations.\n\nsummarizes UAV security issues that were investigated in the literature and the corresponding ML solutions that were adopted to address them.\n\nTable 3\n\nReferenceSecurity TargetML SolutionLi et al.

[60]Small boat detectionDL-based CNN\n\n5.1. Detection and Localization\n\nThe detection of UAVs can be achieved either by direct self-reporting or indirect discovery performed by ground BSs. Conventional detection techniques, including radar, LiDaR sensors, acoustic recognition, electro-optical sensors, and computer vision seem inappropriate in challenging overcrowded dense-urban environments with numerous physical obstacles, ambient noise and light variation, and NLoS propagation conditions. To overcome these issues, intelligent detection and identification techniques have emerged based on data driven algorithms. Among them, ML classifier models have been previously proposed as an accurate classification method. Moreover, DL methods have also been used for the UAV detection problem.\n\nIn Reference [88], a complementary ML-based identification method was applied using large training data sets consisting of UAV and non-UAV data flows from real-world encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. In general, exploiting Wi-Fi traffic is not straightforward due to possible data encryption whereas applying ML methods for real-time UAV identification may not always be beneficial due to time constraints and possible processing delays. Thus, a delay-aware ML-based UAV identification framework was proposed that achieves permissible accuracy while minimizes the delay. This framework handles the encrypted data flow as a time series, exploiting information of packet size and inter-arrival time for statistical feature extraction and estimating the packet inter-arrival time using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method. The prediction time is significantly reduced due to l1-norm regularization and the integration of the feature selection and accuracy optimization in one objective function. Based on the results, the delay-aware ML solution achieves an accuracy of about 85–95% being capable of identifying UAVs within 0.15 to 0.35 s in four scenarios where, in each one, a data set from a different traffic class was used.\n\nIn Reference [89], an air-to-ground LTE cellular network was considered, under strong LoS propagation conditions and harsh interference. The existence of the aerial users (AUs) was accurately and timely detected using ML and measured RF data from UEs as input in a rural area. More specifically, for the AUs detection, a relatively small number of training samples and a weighted distribution for the training set were used along with three ML techniques: (i) the rather simple and insensitive to the distribution or size of the training set Bayesian estimator [90]; (ii) the SVM with high computational complexity and high sensibility but adequate performance [90]; and (iii) the MLP [91], which supports real-time on-the-fly training and avoids storage costs. It is noted that the decision time and the performance of the classification algorithms are a function of the number of features. Using the proposed ML classification methods and an significant number of features, the reliability was approximately 99% whereas the accuracy approached 100%. Moreover, it was observed that, depending on the available data set, each ML solution can lead to different results, as it is the case with unevenly balanced data among aerial and ground users. More specifically, Bayesian and SVM estimators exhibit better generalization capabilities for different performance metrics, while MLP can offer improved performance if a specific metric is targeted.\n\nAn ANN-based detection algorithm was proposed in Reference [92] using three features: the slope, the kurtosis, and the skewness of the signal received from an UAV. Both outdoor and indoor experimental measured data from RF signals were used to train the algorithm and to obtain feature extraction and classification of UAV or non-UAV signals. The results in terms of the error rate revealed that the recognition rate can exceed 82% within a distance of 3 km, a score that is better than other scores provided by conventional non-ML detection methods. The detection and classification of UAVs using Markov-based naive Bayes ML techniques was also realized in Reference [93] for multiple RF raw signal fingerprints from several UAV controllers and different SNR levels. In particular, the classification was based on the energy transient signal and statistical processing in order to avoid noise sensitivity and to adapt to modulation techniques. This method is characterized by low computational complexity, does not exploit the time-domain, and hence averts possible delays for the detection of the transient of the signal, especially in low SNR scenarios. The feature sets were used to train different ML algorithms, including the KNN classification [90], the discriminant analysis (DA), the SVM, and the NN. The results showed that the KNN classifier has the best performance, obtaining an accuracy of above 80% for 15 dB SNR and 14 controllers, whereas the NN has the the worst performance when SNR is low. Further, increasing the number of controllers leads to an average accuracy of 96.3%. Overall, RF fingerprinting is a promising technique, but it requires specific equipment, e.g., expensive SDRs at high frequencies.\n\nIn Reference [94], an acoustic ML-based UAV detection approach with multiple listening nodes, i.e., computing units capable of detecting the UAV sounds, and a control center was presented, relying on features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) [95] and short-time Fourier transform (STFT) for training. STFT provides more signal information but contains more noise compared to MFCC, and recently, it has been considered promising for training using acoustic signals, as DNNs and DL are capable of processing more complicated data. SVM and CNNs were considered in order to estimate in real-time the flying path of an UAV in noisy environments. Overall, the STFT-SVM model succeeded in achieving the best performance, as SVM shows improved classification performance in binary tasks with reduced training resources compared to CNN. The current flying status (i.e., whether it is flying or it is static on the ground) of a powered-on UAV that is remotely controlled by a malicious operator was detected in real-time in Reference [96] by eavesdropping the communication traffic exchanged between the UAV and its controller and by applying classification algorithms. In particular, the Weka platform [97] was adopted that contains various standard ML algorithms for data mining tasks. Among them, the Trees-J48 (J48) [98], RandF [99], and NN were used. This cost-effective passive method does not require special equipment or signal transmission and intends to statistically analyze features, such as packet size and inter-arrival time analysis. The results showed that the delay is less than 4 s with 93% detection accuracy.\n\nIn Reference [100], a system that autonomously, instantaneously, and accurately locates the controllers of UAVs from the transmitted RF control signals was described. This system uses an RF sensor array to monitor the signal spectrum, whereas a CNN is trained in order to predict the bearing of the drone controller relative to the sensor and, then, estimates the position of the controllers. Using the proposed configuration, an operator can be apprehended at distances of up to 500 m with a mean absolute error of 3.67∘ in bearing calculation, which in turns corresponds to a fair positional error of 40 m. Then, in Reference [101], ML tools have been used for estimating the locations of drone-UEs based on sparse information. In particular, employing the kernel density estimation, the UAV spatial distribution has been estimated and then used for obtaining the optimal cell association. Moreover, tools from the optimal transport theory have been also adopted. The presented results confirm that the proposed approach significantly reduces the UAVs-UEs latency as compared to conventional UE-cell association based on SINR while also improves the spectral efficiency. Finally, three deep neural networks (DNN) are trained and tested in Reference [102] using an open source RF database in order to detect the presence of UAVs, to identify their type, and to determine their flight mode. This database includes raw RF signals, which were collected for a variety of flight modes. The performance of these DNNs was verified via a tenfold cross-validation process. According to the classification results, the number of classes dramatically affects the accuracy, since some UAVs were manufactured by the same company. In particular, the mean accuracy decreased from 99.7% for the first DNN (2-classes) to 84.5% for the second DNN (4-classes) and to 46.8% for the third DNN (10-classes).\n\nIn UAV swarm mission-critical scenarios, each UAV should detect and track the other swarm members in order to acquire information regarding the relative distance and bearing. In this direction, a DL- and visual-based detection/tracking algorithmic framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection system [103] was proposed in Reference [104]. In this framework, the tracker, i.e., UAVs equipped with a low-cost and lightweight visual camera, aims at reliably predicting the location of target UAVs on the image plane of their camera. To experimentally evaluate the performance of this approach and to collect multiple data sets of images to train the learning algorithms, a flight test campaign comprising different UAVs and cameras with varying resolution was accomplished. The results underlined the accuracy of the proposed method, which obtained 90% of correct detection instances, in a timely manner. These results also demonstrated that this method offers robustness against challenging conditions, such as sun illumination, as well as background and target-range variability.\n\nsummarizes papers tackling detection and localization issues through ML-based techniques in UAV networks.\n\nTable 5\n\nReferenceDetection and Localization TargetML SolutionAlipour et al.

Placement and Trajectory Design\n\nThis challenge is also directly related with the nontechnical but equally important legal and regulatory issues of constructing an international legislation framework for UAV operation [105]. These regulations do not permit UAVs to fly over all areas and introduce altitude limitations as well. Note that there exist some common rules across different countries: (i) the UAVs should fly only in visual line-of-sight (VLoS), usually limited to 500 m from the pilot; (ii) the UAVs should fly only under 120 m relative to the ground. For other operations, such as flying over people, cities, beyond VLoS (BVLoS), etc., special permissions can be granted depending on the country, while testing of new systems and applications must be usually done in segregated airspace areas. Moreover, flying over people not involved in the operation is not allowed in most countries or it is allowed only under a specific authorization of the aviation authorities. Several studies on the optimized placement and trajectory of UAVs as BSs or relays have been previously conducted (e.g., References [106,107]). These studies have focused on providing efficient connectivity to a group of distributed ground users.\n\nThe joint optimization of trajectory and power control in multiple UAVs scenarios was obtained in Reference [108] aiming at maximizing the users’ throughput and satisfying the users’ rate requirement. The optimization problem relied on ML techniques and included three steps in order to determine the trajectory design of UAVs acting as agents: (i) a multi-agent Q-learning-based placement algorithm was proposed for estimating the 3-D optimal placement of the UAVs with respect of the initial positioning of the ground users, and (ii) the mobility and the upcoming positioning of the ground users were predicted using an ESN-based prediction algorithm [109] and a real-world geographical data set. The latter one was collected from an online social network, i.e., Twitter, as input and included GPS coordinates of anonymous users and recorded time stamps. The third step of the optimization problem included a multi-agent Q-learning-based algorithm that was used to determine the optimal position and to transmit power of the UAVs in each time slot according to the users’ mobility. The results underlined that the proposed algorithm can converge to an optimal state while comparisons with two benchmark schemes, i.e., the historical average (HA) model and the LSTM depicted the superiority of ESN in terms of MSE over both HA and LSTM models at a lower complexity. These results also illustrated that the proposed approach can increase the throughput by approximately 17%, while accuracy improves, as the size of the reservoir increases.\n\nThe authors of Reference [110] follow a Gaussian Process (GP) approach to derive the air-to-ground communication channel, providing an additional link to a group of ground nodes, thus improving their communication quality. For this purpose, GP is employed for predicting the communication channel strength at random UAV positions in an urban environment. Then, the channel model can be used to perform optimal UAV trajectory planning, either with offline pre-scanning based on GP, followed by a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) planner or NMPC planner with online GP. More specifically, in the offline method, the UAV performs data measurements from ground nodes via a prespecified scanning pattern flight. After, these data are fed to the GP to build the channel strength between the different UAV positions and ground nodes. On the contrary, in the online method, the UAV trajectory is designed according to the current knowledge of the air-to-ground channel and through periodic measurements by the UAV incomplete map using GP. It was shown that the offline creation of the communication channel strength map, with GP prior to the start of the mission, outperforms the online creation of the map during the mission without scanning.\n\nIn Reference [111], the trajectory of an UAV BS employed to provide communication services to multiple users was optimized targeting sum-rate improvement using Q-learning. To model the air-to-ground channel between the UAV BS and the ground users, the log-distance path loss model was used. The simulation scenario included an UAV BS flying at a constant altitude and acting as an autonomous agent, two static ground users, and a cuboid obstacle. To obtain Q-function approximators, a standard table-based approach and an NN were utilized. Based on the simulation results, the UAV BS was capable of learning the network topology without preexisting knowledge of the environment. Also, the UAV BS could autonomously obtain its landing position in a timely manner. These results also underlined that NN is more efficient and scalable and requires significantly less training data than table-based Q-learning.\n\nIn topologies where mobile ground nodes require UAV relaying, the paper in Reference [112] proposed to combine ML-based measurement with a probabilistic LAP channel model to facilitate UAV trajectory planning. More specifically, the authors assumed four distinct types of urban environments with unknown building position and shape and a wireless channel including the effects of path-loss, multi-path fading, and shadowing with empirically-known distributions. Also, the ground nodes’ current positions are available to the UAVs but their mobility patterns are not known. Thus, in order to select the appropriate probabilistic LAP model, UAVs collect a pair of signal strength and elevation angle measurements among the UAV and ground nodes. This data allows a neural network (NN) predictor to determine the current urban environment type. The NN’s output can be used for UAV trajectory design using a a Cross Entropy Optimiser (CEO) to generate a set of possible trajectories. Then, a convergence criterion is imposed and, when it is fulfilled, the optimal trajectory is fed to the UAVs. By periodically performing this process, channel prediction for trajectory design in scenarios with mobile ground nodes can be efficiently achieved. Therefore, the NN-based trajectory planning exhibits promising performance in settings where little information on the mission area is available while considering the mobility of the network nodes.\n\nThe non-convex nondeterministic polynomial-time hardness (NP-hard) problem of jointly handling in real-time the 3-D deployment and the dynamic movement of multiple UAVs was studied in Reference [113], where the goal was to maximize the sum mean opinion score (MOS) of ground mobile users while attaining an adequate QoE. A three-step solution was proposed, which comprised (i) the use of a genetic algorithm based k-means algorithm [114] to determine the initial cell partition of the users; (ii) the development of a Q-learning based deployment algorithm, which considers each UAV as an agent, trying offline to self-train and find its optimal 3-D placement assuming static ground users (at the first time slot); and (iii) the development of a Q-learning based movement algorithm for scenarios where the users are moving. The results demonstrated that these algorithms rapidly converge to a desired solution after a significantly small number of iterations. Furthermore, Q-learning based-deployment offers improved performance and reduced complexity when compared to k-means and Iterative-GAKmean alternatives.\n\nIn Reference [115], an unsupervised online self-tuning learning algorithm for joint mobility prediction and object profiling of the individual UAVs was proposed. Apart from predicting the flying objects’ future locations without requiring prior knowledge of the mobility profiles or trajectories of the UAVs, the proposed method also enables the classification of the UAVs into particular groups based on their motion properties, e.g., rotatory and fixed-wing UAVs, via an hierarchical generative model. From the results, a success rate of 90% in profiling mobile objects was yielded for a reasonable noise level and a relative small training data set (over time) compared to conventional data-driven methods. Overall, this method can be practically applied to FANETs with dynamic network topologies and autonomous UAVs and to predict future topologies.\n\nA UAV-based IoT data harvesting scenario in an urban area was also presented in Reference [116], where a resource-constrained aerial base station was employed to serve multiple static ground nodes, e.g., IoT sensors. Contrary to most works in the field, the propagation parameters are considered to be unknown. Based on this uplink scenario, a joint flight trajectory and node scheduling design problem was formulated to minimize the estimation error of the channel model parameters and to maximize the data traffic between the UAV and each node. The trajectory learning phase included the collection of measured data from the ground users that resulted in adequate knowledge of the propagation parameters from the UAV side. Then, an iterative path planning algorithm was proposed along with dynamic programming [117] techniques and the exploitation of a 3-D city map compression method in order to efficiently handle the aforementioned non-convex problem. The results demonstrated the benefits of the proposed learning method, whereas it was proved that the algorithm can converge to at least a locally optimal solution. Moreover, even though the ML-based solution leverages the rich map data, a map compression method is employed, making the trajectory design problem less complex compared to standard optimization tools.\n\nThen, in Reference [118], a UAV BS flying at an altitude well above the building height was adopted for the provision of video streaming services to several UEs clustered in a circular area. In an effort to optimize the flight planning and, thus, to enhance the QoE of UEs with regard to the video segment delay during streaming applications, a Q-learning approach was formulated. This approach was denoted as Q-SQUARE and modeled the UAV BS’s path as a sequence of states, which were related to the UAV BS’s position, the elapsed flight time, and the residual energy. Also, Q-SQUARE considered multiple recharging stations, where the UAV BSs were recharged after a flight period. The numerical results demonstrated that Q-SQUARE can substantially improve the system performance in terms of the QoE by optimizing the flight path of multiple UAV BSs serving the area of interest.\n\nThe joint optimization of the placement and power allocation of multiple UAVs with respect to the ground users in an unknown region was also accomplished in Reference [119]. Since initially, the UAVs have imperfect CSI; the optimization problem was formulated by exploiting game theory. Then, a robust and distributed learning algorithm was proposed to guide multiple UAV flight plans in order to maximize the sum-rate with fairness for all ground users under specific flight region and power constraints. This algorithm converged to a stable state of maximizing the aforementioned optimization objective, resulting in a guide that facilitated the flight path of the UAVs. A flight path planning model for a dynamic and auto-configurable FANET was presented in Reference [120]. This model took advantage of a metaheuristic optimization-based approach that intends to optimize in real time the position of a flying relay device, i.e., an UAV, in order to obtain the best throughput while having knowledge of the position of the other UAVs. Thus, an ANN was trained using mobility data of UAVs including the position and traffic information that was supplied through the Network Simulator 2 (NS-2). According to the results, the average throughput of the optimized FANET was significantly higher, i.e., 135%, in comparison with the non-optimized FANET in an area of 200 × 200 m.\n\nIn Reference [121], a Q-learning positioning approach was proposed in an effort to find the best 3-D placement of drones in multiple drone small cells considering propagation areas, where the conventional terrestrial communication infrastructure is not operational or accessible due to a large-scale natural disaster. In these temporary intelligent small cells, the drones have limited resources and the ground users could have distinct requirements in terms of the data throughput and the mobility characteristics. The goal of this approach was to facilitate the construction of an efficient emergency communication network by maximizing the total network radio coverage while attaining robustness against dynamic network conditions, mobility issues, and interference. The simulation results included performance comparison between the proposed Q-learning method and random fixed positioning and circular positioning strategies and depicted that the former outperforms the others, in terms of coverage, QoS, and backhaul throughput.\n\nThe performance of a downlink air-to-ground communication system was optimized in Reference [122], where an aerial platform acted as a BS and the ground users were not static. In particular, a low-complexity Q-learning algorithm was used to find, in relatively short processing time compared to heuristic algorithms, the 3-D optimal position of the aerial BS in such a dynamic environment, where the network topology continuously changes, satisfying the QoS requirements. Thus, the benefits of RL-based positioning is evident, as the need for reinitialization in the heuristic-based approaches is avoided and gradual changes due to UEs mobility are efficiently monitored, leading to positioning with lower complexity. In Reference [101], a 3-D cellular network was also proposed that utilizes drones as BSs and drones as UEs. The former use ML tools to determine the spatial probability distribution of the latter for a certain time period, considering the mobility properties and aiming at minimizing the latency. In particular, a kernel density estimation method was developed, for which the training is attained using the sparse (owing to the excessive overhead costs) available prior information of the location of drone-UEs. Additionally, the problem of the proper placement of an aerial platform as a BS was investigated in Reference [123], taking into account the users’ requirements and specific scenarios. Specifically, a DQN algorithm was proposed that maximizes the spectral efficiency by exploiting a large-scale pre-learning experience of different user layouts. The DQN combines the DL CNN and reinforcement learning Q-learning advances, but it has the advantage of being more time efficient. The superior performance of this algorithm was demonstrated in the simulation results, where the spectral efficiency of the system achieved 91.3% maximum spectral efficiency, with lower complexity than conventional genetic algorithms, such as hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms.\n\nIn Reference [124], the self-optimization of multiple UAVs’ trajectory in real-time sensing applications was tackled using a Q-learning learning method in a decentralized manner. A single-cell UAV orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) network was considered, where the UAVs transmit the sensory data to a terrestrial BS over orthogonal subchannels to avoid mutual interference and the location of the terrestrial base station and the UAV was specified by 3-D cartesian coordinates. It was also considered that the UAVs perform the sensing tasks in a synchronized iterative manner and send the measured data to the base station, whereas the sensing quality of the UAVs was evaluated using the probabilistic sensing model [125]. In addition, a sense-and-send protocol was proposed that facilitates the coordination of the UAVs handling different tasks, and then, the probability for successful valid data transmission using nested Markov chains was investigated. A frame-level simulation of this protocol was built in MATLAB®, and the results underlined the rapid convergence of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional single- and multi-agent Q-leaning algorithms.\n\nA distributed DRL algorithm for the navigation of a group of UAVs acting as BSs flying in a target region was developed in Reference [126]. The optimization problem was formulated as a partially observable MDP (POMDP), where the UAVs were capable of only observing the areas in their vicinity. Since each UAV has connectivity constraints and limited battery lifetime, the optimization problem aimed at improving the temporal average radio coverage and geographical fairness while minimizing the total energy consumption of the UAVs. In this algorithm, an agent, i.e., the UAV, and the environment interact at each of a sequence of discrete timeslots. The training of the algorithm was obtained using the observations of each UAV regarding the propagation environment. According to the simulation results, the proposed optimization method outperfoms the state-of-the-art DRL-EC3 approach based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) [127] in terms of energy efficiency. A double Q-learning algorithm that handles the problem of trajectory design of UAVs was presented in Reference [128]. Although standard Q-learning algorithms use the same Q-table for selection and evaluation processes and usually tend to overestimation and suboptimal results, this algorithm uses two Q-tables to decouple the selection from the evaluation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated via extensive simulations, and the gain was up to 19.4% and 6.7% regarding the number of satisfied users compared to the random algorithm and Q-learning algorithm, respectively.\n\nFurther advancements on UAV navigation were given in Reference [129]. In greater detail, a UAV navigation scheme based on DRL that can select the best UAV-to-ground links in real-time was presented for a massive MIMO system which included one ground station with a large number of antennas and multiple UAVs with single antennas. First, a DQN was constructed to extract the environment information and to obtain useful features of the massive MIMO channel, and then, the DQN was trained in order to facilitate the decision-making procedure based on the received signal strengths. Using the DQN, a Q-learning policy was also exploited for successfully optimizing UAV navigation while achieving increased coverage and rapid convergence. The high performance of the proposed DQN navigation scheme was confirmed through extensive simulation results, where the channel was Rician with a Rician factor of 6 dB and a ground station with 128 transmit antennas and 32 single-antennan UAVs flying at different velocities were considered.\n\nFinally, the optimization problem of proper dynamic placement of UAVs as BSs in downlink scenarios was studied in Reference [130]. It was considered that the UAVs should make decisions about their placement in each time-slot, depending on the unknown density of ground users in an ML manner. Moreover, a constraint regarding the minimum UAV-recall-frequency or otherwise the maximum life-time, indicating the energy efficiency of mobile UAVs networks, should be also satisfied. In each time-slot, the UAV-recall-frequency was considered static and the results showed that the optimal UAV placement is achieved when the transmit power becomes equal to the onboard circuit power. In addition, the optimal hovering altitude that minimizes transmit power is proportional to the coverage radius, whereas the slope depends on the propagation environment and tends to increase in areas with high-rise buildings. These results also underlined that limiting on-board circuit power prolongs the life-time of mobile UAV networks. Next, the multiple time-slot scenario was studied, where unstable and non-ergodic time-varying density of ground users served with fixed data rate exists. For this scenario, the optimization problem was more complex and required a multi-stage decision process leading to an integer nonlinear programming coupled with an inherent integer linear programming. Since this problem was NP-hard, a sequential-Markov-greedy-decision (SMGD) method was proposed in order to achieve near-minimal UAV-recall-frequency in polynomial time. According to the results, a large number of sample sets are indispensable for effective pattern formation and reduction of UAV-recall-frequency in large areas with high-rise buildings and low ground user density whereas the SMGD becomes more complex as the number of UAVs increases.\n\nincludes the relevant works on ML-based resource allocation and network planning techniques for UAV-enabled communication networks.\n\nTable 6\n\nReferencePlacement and Trajectory TargetML SolutionLiu et al.
