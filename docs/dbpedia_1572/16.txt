Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Training Bootcamp by Tonex

Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) is more important than ever as it helps in comprehending what military and other intimidations a country might need to protect against rivals.

More specifically, the primary focus of Signals Intelligence is to know about terrorizations, activities, capabilities, and intentions of a country’s rivals. Signals Intelligence functions as a key tool in comprehending what military and other intimidations a country might need to protect against rivals.

Additionally, Signals Intelligence can also turn out to be a roadmap for the most effective courses of activities to understand or implement for assuring vigilance.

SIGINT is most often used by military or intelligence agency professionals, who have to deal with messages and data of one or more parties that are gathered using any type of electronic, communications, or foreign instrumentation signals intelligence, irrespective of how the information was conveyed. This could be in the form of written messages, verbal communications, data from weapons systems or radar, etc.

Today’s high-performance SIGINT systems require massive processing power to detect, identify, and classify an enormous number of highly complex signals.

SIGINT systems typically consist of a variety of functional elements – signal processors (themselves often consisting of multiple processing elements), snapshot memory buffers, high-speed data recorders, and bulk storage – all residing in multiple physical units, connected through high-speed data pipes.

In many application data flows, the processing elements within and between the distinct units need to be interconnected using switched fabrics.

In recent years, one very important tool for SIGINT gathering has been unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as the Global Hawk and Reaper drones, which are fortified with potent Light and Imaging Detection (LIDAR) and infrared sensors & cameras, as well as synthetic aperture RADAR to collect and send back worthy raw intelligence from the operative environment for exploration and analysis.

While the detailed ins and outs of SIGINT are somewhat secretive (for obvious reasons), here’s a few examples of how it’s used:

Use of iPhone malware to overlook the communications and actions of users

Portable continuous wave generators used for monitoring the keyboard activities of offline computers by means of a keyboard vibration attack.

Placement of USB sticks into radio transmitters.

“LAMPSTAND” devices that can interfere with wireless networks at distances up to 8 miles.

Algorithms help SIGNET systems automates the low-level detection and classification tasks. This frees up military personnel to focus on higher level tactical decision making. This way, the system becomes another team member, with a supervising human in the loop to authorize the appropriate military response.

In addition, through SIGNET automation, a commander can gain an “EM signature picture” of his forces as they are arrayed in the battlespace. Consequently, he can glean valuable information on his own EM signature and use that information to improve or implement additional passive and active actions to increase survivability.

SIGINT software tools are used individually to help with specific segments of the intelligence production and reprogramming cycle, or they can be used collectively to assist with the entire process. This plug-and-play functionality makes this software flexible and expandable to address emerging needs

Analysts believe SIGINT will be even more important in the future as a national protection mechanism. A report by Research Dive states that growing terrorism across the globe is likely to trigger the growth of the global signal intelligence sector with CAGR of 4.0% from 2020 to 2027.

Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Training Bootcamp by Tonex

Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Training Bootcamp is a 3-day training course covering all aspects of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) including Communications Intelligence (COMINT), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) and Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence (FISINT).

Advanced Network Characterization (ANC), Digital Land Mobile Communication (DLMC), 4G/5G, WiFi, IoT, SATCOM, Radar, UHV/VHF/H, microwave, mmWave and optical signals utilizing the latest technologies and methodologies in the SIGINT field are discussed.

SIGINT involves collecting intelligence from communications and information systems to help protect troops and military operations, national security, fight terrorism, combat international crime and narcotics, support diplomatic negotiations, support allies, and advance many other important national objectives.

Participants will learn about SIGINT and tools to collect SIGINT from various sources, including foreign communications, satellite/space, commercial communication systems, mobile networks, radar and other electronic and communication systems. The instructors will show you what to collect, and how to process, analyze, produce, and disseminate Signals Intelligence information and data for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.

Participants will also learn about advanced techniques and algorithms for collection, network characterization, and analysis across the Radio Frequency Spectrum for the purpose of supporting Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze and Disseminate (F3EAD).

Communication is an important part of everyday life — especially when it comes to leading a country. World leaders communicate with their people in a variety of ways. All of these forms of communication emit a signal that can be collected. The information gathered from these intercepted signals is of vital importance to national security.
