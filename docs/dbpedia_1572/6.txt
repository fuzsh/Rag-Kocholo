We provide our customers the full spectrum of ISR operations: pilots and mission systems operators; maintenance for the aircraft, sensors, and mission equipment; logistics and support; and site and program management. Multi-intelligence data collection and processing, exploitation, dissemination services include electro-optical infra-red (EO/IR) full motion video (FMV), LIDAR, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), hyperspectral imagery (HSI), signals intelligence (SIGINT), and maritime patrol surface search radar. ISR Technologies are not static, which necessitates a company to be able to adapt quickly, grow and keep up with the rapidly changing times, which MAG has mastered since its inception. MAG continues to integrate, operate, and train on the ever-evolving technology landscape to improve operations.
