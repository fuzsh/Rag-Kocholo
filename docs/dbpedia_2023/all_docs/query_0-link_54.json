During her lifetime her main patron was a New York lawyer, John Quinn. Although a small cir-cle of admirers knew her work, she was aloof from engaging with “the art world,” becoming increas-ingly isolated from colleagues, friends, relatives, choosing instead to retreat to Catholic piety and her pet cats.\n\nHer paintings and drawings are modest in scale, and like her younger contemporary, Giorgio Moran-di, she focused on simple subjects: her room, por-traits of friends and the nuns in a local convent, table-top still lives, often painting variants on a theme. Her close-toned, exquisitely brushed sub-jects reverberate with tenderness, offering a unique personality.\n\nRobert Bunkin is a painter, curator, art historian and educator, with a BS from CUNY and an MFA from Ma-son Gross School of the Arts, Rutgers University. He has taught art history and studio art in several NYC art schools, universities, colleges and museums.\n\n*Space is limited. Walkups will be permitted as space accommodates. Face mask required.\n\nGwen John, Self-Portrait, 1902. Oil on canvas. Tate Britain\n\nFeb 12, 2022 – March 12, 2022\n\nPlatform Project Space\n\n20 Jay Street #314\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nplatformprojectspace.com\n\nPlatform Project Space is pleased to present Impinging Environments, a two person show of paintings and animations by Olive Ayhens and Ezra Johnson. This is the first show to pair the work of the artists, who are mother and son. Both are interested in the collision of man and nature and in capturing the often toxic beauty that results.\n\nOlive Ayhens transforms environments in her own quirky ways. She works from memory and uses exaggerated imagination to catch the deep essence of a place. She researches, sketches, and dreams to spontaneously amplify and add nuance to her vision. She remains inventive all along. Color is her first language and she is especially drawn to spatial incongruities and surprises. Represented in the show is older work from different times and places, yet it is all connected. Olive is very excited to show with her\n\nson, Ezra Johnson.\n\nEzra Johnson is known for expanding his painting practice into animation and sculpture. Interested in experimentation with color, form and surface, his work takes a playful and energetic approach to serious subject matter. For Impinging Environments, Johnson will exhibit three still life paintings depicting objects found along the banks of the Hillsborough River in Tampa, Florida. The show also includes Johnson’s stop-frame animation, Stranded in a House, made with oil painting on top of interior design\n\nadvertisements gathered from found catalogues.\n\nOlive Ayhens has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Joan Mitchell Grant, a Pollack-Krasner Grant (twice,) and the Adolph & Easter Gottlieb Individual Support Grant.She has been in residence at Ucross,MacDowell, Yaddo, VCCA, Blue Mountain, Djerassi, LMCC among others and she will be attending the Joan Mitchell residency in New Orleans this coming spring.\n\nEzra Ayhens Johnson was born in 1975 in Wenatchee, Washington. He received an MFA from Hunter College in New York in 2006 and a BFA from California College of the Arts in San Francisco in 2000. Johnson’s work has been exhibited widely at museums and galleries such as the Nerman Museum of Art in Kansas, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, the Site Santa Fe Biennial, among others. Johnson is currently residing in Tampa and teaches painting at The University of South Florida.\n\nSaturday March 7, 2022\n\n1 PM – 7PM Schedule an appointment.\n\nWestbeth Community room\n\n155 Bank Street\n\nThrough Courtyard\n\nNew York, NY\n\nNew York Blood Center relies upon 1500 volunteer blood donors per day.\n\nThere has been a chronic gap in blood donations since the start of the pandemic. Remote and blended learning has resulted in a 75% reduction in youth donations from high schools and colleges and remote work has also resulted in hundreds of organizations no longer able to host blood drives. At the same time, the need for blood from patients in our local hospitals has increased by 10-15% from pre-pandemic levels, from pent up demand for treatment and surgeries postponed during the pandemic.\n\nWe’re encouraging folks to give blood and/or help amplify the message on the need for blood in our community. Saving a life takes just an hour of your time. You can click on this link to schedule an appointment\n\nhttps://donate.nybc.org/donor/schedules/drive_schedule/301825\n\nFood Banks\n\nAs you will see on the flyer, we are working with local food banks throughout the month of March. Donors must register for their donations to qualify by going to:\n\nhttps://www.nybc.org/donate-blood/save-1-feed-1/\n\nThe Miriam Chaikin Endowment Fund\n\nThe Fund for the writing award was established in 2016 in memory of Miriam Chaikin, a longtime Westbeth resident, former Westbeth Artists Residents Council Literary Arts Chair, and prolific writer.\n\nFor Miriam, the written word and the book were essential to her life and well-being. It is in her memory that we seek to honor a member of the writing community, especially those writers who live in Westbeth.\n\nCassandra Long, poetry\n\nCassandra Long is a writer, painter, and illustrator based in Brooklyn, New York. Many of her stories are inspired by working with kids as a schoolteacher in both Boston and New York City. She is currently at work on a children’s book about her time as a teacher, as well as a book of illustrated stories titled Me Imagining Holding a Baby While Imagining Dropping the Imaginary Baby While Still Holding It.\n\nJeffrey Solomon, prose\n\nJeffrey Solomon’s coming out and coming of age memoir, The Tourist, is his first work of long-form prose. He is currently finishing up his MFA in creative writing at Goddard College. He is the founder of Houses on the Moon Theater Company (HOTM); the playwright and director of Houses’ productions of Building Houses on the Moon and De Novo (59E59 Theaters and Next Door at NYTW); and the playwright of Tara’s Crossing (Tenement Theatre).\n\nHe has taught HOTM’s storytelling workshops with underserved communities, co-curating and directing the story-based theater projects. His one-man show The Santa Closet (originally titled Santa Clause Is Coming Out) won the Best of the Columbus National Gay and Lesbian Theatre Festival (2002), had its off-Broadway debut at the Kirk Theatre on Theatre Row (2009), and was revived in 2019 by Houses on the Moon at Teatro Circulo. His other solo play, MotherSON, has had acclaimed runs at HERE (New York City), the Oval House (UK), and Theatre Works (Melbourne, Australia), and has been presented as an educational and support tool around LGBTQ+ and human rights issues in India, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines. Solomon wrote the pilot episode for Jim Henson/ABC-TV program CityKids, which was Emmy-nominated for Best Children’s Special.\n\nMore Information About the Fund\n\nMiriam Chaikin Writing Award\n\nShow Dates: Feb. 17 to Mar. 17, 2022\n\nOpening, Thursday, Feb. 17, 6 to 8 PM\n\nCarter Burden Gallery\n\n548 West 28th Street, Suite 543\n\nRegular gallery hours are 11 to 5, Tues-Fri; 11 to 6, Sat.\n\nCarter Burden Gallery presents Go Figure! a group exhibition featuring the figurative work of ten artists. The pieces consist of installation, painting, drawing, and sculpture.\n\nFeatured Artists:\n\nEarlene Hardie Cox, Barbara Herzfeld, Bernice Kramer, Lindsay, Isaac Paris, Sheila Schwid, Regina Silvers, Susan Sinek, Syma, and Danny Turitz.\n\nMagic Lady, an interactive installation by Syma has had many iterations over the last forty years; Revisited again now, this fortune teller self-portrait, reflecting and originating in the artist’s past, might offer a glimpse into the future. Using the park as her muse, Lindsay, who considers herself a folk expressionist, presents paintings of the people she observes there. She visits the park and draws the people who sit, sleep, eat lunch, discuss, contemplate, and read, then returns to the studio to paint them. In an effort to be more environmentally aware and having a desire to do something creative and useful with discarded materials, Isaac Paris has combined his love for collecting African masks with creating masks mainly from plastic containers and other recycled materials. Most recently specializing in creating masks that resemble familiar animal forms, and possible extinct ones, Paris presents two pieces entitled Long Ears. In her first exhibition with the gallery, Susan Sinik present two large drawings from her The Leg series. She says, “The essence of my work is creating expression with the use of line and black passages. I work on paper using charcoal, Chinese ink, graphite and acrylic to create beautiful sensitive lines with bold solid passages.”\n\nWhat is Lost? And What is Found? In 2021, The New York Artists Circle presented an online exhibition of 117 selected artists who explored and revealed what is truly important in our lives, as they coped with waves of serial losses and change during this pandemic time. Carter Burden Gallery has invited the New York Artists Circle to put together an in-person gallery version of the online exhibition. The (re)grouping of selected work led to two consecutive shows of 50 works distilled from the original 117; presenting an new opportunity for (re)reflection, (re)entering and (re)viewing up close and personal, aiming for a (re)bound through the (re)found. This important exhibition includes statements from each artist accompanying their work. The show offers the opportunity to (re)visit your own experience and (re)flect on these significant events.\n\nFeatured Artists:\n\nAudrey Anastasi, Marianne Barcellona, Fran Beallor, Walter Brown, Kathleen Casey, Pamela Casper, Colleen Deery, Norma Greenwood, Valerie Huhn, Sandra Indig, Diana Jensen, Arthur Kvarnstrom, Yvonne Lamar-Rogers, Donna Levinstone, Christina Maile, Douglas Newton, Ellen Pliskin, Siena Gillann Porta, Amy Regalia, Gale Rothstein, Charles Seplowin, Regina Silvers, Geoffrey Stein, Joanne Steinhardt, and Alice Zinnes.\n\nwww.carterburdengallery.org\n\nwww.carterburdennetwork.org\n\nRed Hook Star Review\n\nWalter recorded what was happening in real time (many of the essays were originally published in the Manhattan newspaper The Village Sun) so they have a fantastic immediacy. She writes in a clear way with an eye for interesting details. Her observations poke awake our own dormant memories and make us realize things we’d noticed, but had forgotten, busy as we were absorbing so much change.\n\nWalter lives alone in a 600-square-foot apartment in Westbeth Artists Housing, a naturally occurring retirement community in the West Village. Finding herself alone after a decades-long relationship goes belly up, she never gives up hope for a chance to have one more great romance.\n\n-Michael Quinn\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nRead entire article here: Red Hook Star Review\n\nKate Walter’s Book Behind the Mask was chosen by Pretty Progressive.com as one of the ’16 Most Powerful Books on Courage for Adults”\n\nhttps://prettyprogressive.com/16-powerful-books-about-courage-for-adults/\n\nKate Walter loved her life as a single gay woman living in New York City’s famous Westbeth Artists Housing in Greenwich Village. She was in that sweet spot—recently retired from a long teaching career, but hardly retired, she was living the dream. Finally, her time was her own, a chance to expand and explore.\n\nShe was embedded in a vibrant artistic community. She was a published writer, met friends for lunch, went to museums, and concerts, and readings. She took yoga classes and belonged to a writing workshop, a singing group, a church. She celebrated all the holidays with her family in New Jersey.\n\nIn early 2020, the lively community of Westbeth Artists Housing was gearing up to celebrate its 50th anniversary. But when New York City went into Covid 19 pandemic lockdown, Westbeth turned into a ghost town. Kate’s carefully constructed social life crashed. Suddenly, she was trapped at home, living in the pandemic epicenter. The brief conversations with masked neighbors in the hallway or on the sidewalk became her lifeline. Her life moved onto Zoom and she took comfort watching worship services streamed every Sunday. Then the unimaginable happened. Her church burned down in a six-alarm fire. Now there literally would be no sanctuary left to return to after the pandemic – whenever that would be.\n\nKate was lonely and scared. The isolation was hard on everyone. For cultural creators, perhaps an extra degree of hard. She melted down in lockdown. She dreamed the city was on fire. She hit the wall. But she picked herself up and called upon her resilience and spiritual practices to stay safe and get through the isolation. In a welcome break from the pandemic, she celebrated in front of the Stonewall Inn when Biden won the election. And she started penning columns for The Village Sun, a local community publication.
