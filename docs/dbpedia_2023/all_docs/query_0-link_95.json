        "text": "Learn about a dynamic leadership opportunity to expand your docent experience beyond the symposium.\n\nIf you are planning to attend the Atlanta symposium this November, you are invited to apply to be a National Docent Symposium Council director. The NDSC's mission is to support an ongoing forum for docent education and exchange of ideas through the biennial symposium as well as other programs and resources. The Council is volunteer-led by docents from regions throughout the U.S. and Canada. Regional Directors and Directors-at-Large begin their four-year terms following the symposium, held November 14-17, and candidates must be registered in order to apply.\n\nOnline applications are accepted now through September 30. For more information, please click this LINK\n\nSpeed Art Museum and Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art team up for learning opportunity\n\nby Janet DenUyl, Docent, Speed Art Museum\n\nThe docents of the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, KY are grateful to Craig Anderson and Karen Skillett of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art for the excellent video training session Beyond Art History: Creating Great Tour Experiences. At our recent monthly training session, we showed 45 minutes of the recording in which Craig and Karen provided an overview and demonstration of how they use visual thinking strategies, asking open ended questions to engage visitors in close looking and conversation about several aspects of an artwork.\n\nDocent programs that evolve with the times will continue to serve their museums and communities well.\n\nThis article was published in the March-April 2024 issue of the American Alliance of Museum's Magazine.\n\nClick here for article pdf.\n\nBy Michelle Carpenter, Docent, Phoenix Art Museum\n\nTwenty-three years ago, I sat in the second row of a docent training class unsure of what I had signed up for. As a new docent recruit at Phoenix Art Museum in Arizona, I had embarked on a rigorous two-year program that would prepare me to offer museum tours and give community and school talks.\n\nby Claire Laramée, Montréal Museum of Fine Arts (MMFA) Guide\n\nCoordinating Touring Guides can be fulfilling, engaging and rewarding! Team work is the main ingredient, especially working with the booking personel, mostly in the Education/Mediation Department.\n\nAt the MMFA, technology is on our side with an Interactive Master Sheet used by the booking Department as well as the Coordinator. This Master Sheet details tour reservations, client name/objective, date/time of visit - all required to coordinate a Unit. A Unit is how the MMFA refers to the standard two month period that guides must register for. At the MMFA, volunteer guides must be available for two Units per year.\n\nI am pleased to profile Joyce Weaver, who was Director of Library and Archives for most of the time I’ve been a docent at the Mint Museum in Charlotte, NC. Joyce retired from the Mint in December of 2021 after 17 years of service. Mint Docents celebrated Joyce by awarding her Honorary Docent status at our 65th Anniversary observance in the fall of 2022.\n\nHer accomplishments during her tenure are wide ranging. Joyce secured a grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services to digitize the card catalogs, modernizing the system for the Art, Craft + Design and Delhom Ceramic libraries.\n\nDocents, staff and the local community relied on the books, files and online resources Joyce made available at our request. She instituted the museum’s mintwiki, putting resources at our fingertips and the keyboards of art researchers from around the world.\n\nRealizing the need to formally preserve the papers, images and objects from the early history of the Mint, Joyce obtained the federal grant to create the Mint Museum Archives and hire an archivist.\n\nProfessor Joyce Weaver continues to teach an online graduate level course in Information, Library and Research Sciences at UNC Greensboro and a Special Library course online for NC Central University School of Library and Information Sciences students. In addition, she serves on a regional library board.\n\nIn 2019, Joyce received the Meritorious Achievement Award from the Carolinas Chapter of the Special Library Association. An apt recognition of her contributions to the library profession.\n\nRenee Reese\n\nMint Museum Docent\n\nThe National Docent Symposium Council is soliciting applications for Education Grants for attendees to the Atlanta 2024 symposium. Applicants must be volunteer, unpaid, docents or guides, must be attending a symposium for the first time, and must not be receiving funding for the registration fee from their institution, docent organization or other grant source.\n\nThe intent of the grants is to increase participation within traditionally underserved communities and institutions serving indigenous and immigrant communities and those focused on accessibility for all; to broaden the number of museums, galleries, and cultural institutions that will send docents/guides to future symposia; and to promote symposium attendance by docents/guides who might not otherwise be able to attend.\n\nby Jeanne Heise and Anne Minteer, Western Region Directors\n\nIn June 2023, the Western Region hosted a popular virtual roundtable titled, “Reimagining Docent Training.” Over 50 docents/guides attended representing 21 museums from six out of seven states within the region.\n\nThe post pandemic landscape has resulted in shrinking docent populations at many institutions. Increased focus on DEIA and social justice issues has required changes in recruitment of docents, in structure and timing of classes, and in the content and duration of training. Museums, and their docent organizations, across the region are trying to adapt and replenish their docent corps. Our topic struck a chord.\n\nArt In Bloom 2023 and The Associates of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston\n\nIn April, Boston saw Art in Bloom (AIB) return in full force to the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (MFA). This joyful, three-day salute to spring showcases selections from the MFA’s collection paired with custom-made floral arrangements. In collaboration with museum staff, the Associates produced the first AIB event in 1976. The Associates, who are volunteer docents and floral designers, have carried on this tradition for more than 40 years. They worked closely with museum staff to organize this event and all volunteers were encouraged to participate in the implementation.\n\nThe Future. Participating in the National Docent Symposium Council’s (NDSC) symposia, webinars, and website offers a unique and incomparable network for docents/guides to prepare for our future. As our cultural institutions change and strive to be more relevant to all, so too must docent practice evolve to strengthen those endeavors. The NDSC has been a touchstone for me for most of my 21 year “career” as a docent and I find them more relevant and important than ever.\n\nMina Shea\n\nDocent, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco\n\nwww.famsf.org\n\nAt the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), like many other museums and cultural facilities, closures due to covid forced a rethinking of how our institutions connect to our surrounding communities. Video and Zoom links became a huge part of adapting “to bring art to the classroom” instead of the classrooms to the art. Lectures and curator presentation given to the AGO membership continued to keep us linked to the outside and entertained while we were confined to our homes. It also meant, a large number of our staff had their talents redeployed supporting these activities and allowing for and justifying continued employment. Volunteers supported this strategy while remaining on hold waiting for a time when the AGO staff could focus on us and we could reengage with the public.\n\nWhile waiting for our time, Gallery Guides stayed active through self organized zoom meetings. During Volunteer Week, we organized a zoom tour of some of our favourite AGO works of art for all the volunteers. Staff made time to keep us informed of current AGO activities and timing of reopening strategies. Gallery Guides continued to stay active and took advantage of generous offers from other North America galleries who offered tours of their exhibitions. We made new connections."
