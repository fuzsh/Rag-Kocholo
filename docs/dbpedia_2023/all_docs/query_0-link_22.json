        "text": "On the Outdoor Screen: Navigating the Pilot School\n\n10 AM, 2 PM, and 6 PM daily. 6 PM only on 4/24\n\nIn conjunction with the film series Tell No Lies: Decolonizing Cinema, we present Filipa César and Sónia Vaz Borges’s Navigating the Pilot School on BAMPFA’s outdoor screen. The film uses a performance with children’s building blocks to describe a militant school, together with archival footage, the recollections of a student, and an excerpt from a political publication.\n\nView\n\nDuane Linklater: mymothersside\n\nFor over a decade, Duane Linklater has been making art that interrogates the construct of museums, their conventions, and their historical exclusion of Indigenous people and content. Working across a range of media—including painting, sculpture, and video—he addresses the contradictions of contemporary Indigenous life within settler systems of knowledge, representation, and value. Duane Linklater: mymothersside is the artist’s first major survey exhibition.\n\nView\n\nArt Wall: Xylor Jane\n\nFor BAMPFA’s Art Wall, Xylor Jane presents a pyramidal calendar organized by the fifth palindromic triangular number, 666—a number with myriad positive and negative connotations. A black grid outlines the color-coded days of the week, while hand-drawn notations mark full moons, equinoxes, and solstices to queer and cross-reference the relationship of natural cycles with European constructions of time.\n\nView\n\nOn the Hour: Three short films by William Kentridge\n\nThis trio of short animated films by William Kentridge demonstrate his interest in patterns associated with stream of consciousness thought, transformation, language, abstraction, and time. He uses the formal principles and building blocks of cinema, i.e. the illusion of movement that is created when the eye sees 24 frames per second, and manipulates the single film frame to make these magical works.\n\nView\n\nAmalia Mesa-Bains: Archaeology of Memory\n\nAmalia Mesa-Bains: Archaeology of Memory is the first retrospective exhibition of the work of longtime Bay Area artist Mesa-Bains. Presenting work from the entirety of her career for the first time, this exhibition, which features nearly 60 works in a range of media, including fourteen major installations, celebrates Mesa-Bains’s important contributions to the field of contemporary art locally and globally.\n\nView\n\nFrank Moore / MATRIX 280: Theater of Human Melting\n\nThis exhibition represents a small portion of the vast body of creative work by the late Berkeley-based artist and teacher Frank Moore (1946–2013). Over the course of more than five decades, Moore, who was born with a physical disability, used painting, performance, public access television, and an extensive writing practice to explore the unlimited capacity for humans to connect.\n\nView\n\nEndless Knot: Struggle and Healing in the Buddhist World\n\nEndless Knot: Struggle and Healing in the Buddhist World explores how artists and practitioners across two millennia have understood and utilized one of the core tenets of Buddhism—dependent arising, which posits that cycles of existence (saṃsāra) arise from past actions and that everything in the world can impact everything else.\n\nView\n\nUndoing Time: Art and Histories of Incarceration\n\nUndoing Time: Art and Histories of Incarceration considers the foundational roots of confinement from philosophical, sociological, theological, and art historical perspectives to better understand the fact that today’s mass incarceration crisis has been centuries in the making. This exhibition traces images from history that contribute to the entrenched cultural beliefs associated with today’s carceral system.\n\nView\n\nFluxus Reverb: Events, Scores, Boxes & More\n\nAn international movement of the 1960s and 1970s of artists working across disciplines and in a decidedly anti-commercial manner, this exhibition offers an opportunity to see Fluxus materials and many artworks in the form of a box, including numerous Fluxkits by a wide variety of artists.\n\nView\n\nWhen All That Is Solid Melts into Air\n\nExploring the Intersection of the Folk and the Modern in Postcolonial India\n\nFeaturing Indian folk art as well as less traditional forms, this exhibition tells the story of the momentous social and artistic transformations that unfolded in the relationship between the “modern” and the “folk” in India after 1947.\n\nView\n\nJoseph Holtzman / MATRIX 256\n\nJoseph Holtzman's paintings on marble achieve remarkable chromatic and tonal effects by exploiting the transparency of oil paint and the unusual capacity of the stone surface to absorb and reflect light. The themes and motifs of these highly personal paintings are drawn from Holtzman's interest in historical painting and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century decorative arts, and often depict family and friends, cultural personalities, historical figures, and literary characters.\n\nView\n\nAmerican Wonder: Folk Art from the Collection\n\nDiscover the early years of our nation through portraits, landscapes, commemorative mourning pictures, weather vanes, and decorative sculptures that reflect the daily lives and aspirations of Americans between the years 1776 and 1865. American Wonder begins in Colonial New England, evoking the world of early settlers, and ends in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the pitched optimism of the Gold Rush met with dreams of a post-Civil War American Eden.\n\nView\n\nHofmann by Hofmann\n\nIn 1963 Hans Hofmann donated nearly fifty paintings in support of the burgeoning University Art Museum (now BAMPFA). As we prepare to move to our new building in downtown Berkeley, it seems fitting to revisit the enduring vitality and generosity of Hofmann's extraordinary gift with a selection of the works selected personally by the artist for BAMPFA.\n\nView\n\nWill Rogan / MATRIX 253\n\nFor MATRIX 253, Will Rogan has created a new body of work that explores various time scales-past, present, and future-as evinced in a reversed order or a backward motion. Primarily taking the form of photography, collage, sculpture, or video, Rogan's work possesses a subtlety and quietude that inspire thoughtful consideration of the material effects of time and space.\n\nView\n\nThe Possible\n\nCombining studio, school, library, gallery, and stage, The Possible is an open platform for exploring diverse creative techniques. This experimental exhibition transforms our galleries into workshops-a ceramics studio, dye lab, print shop, and recording studio-to foster collaboration among artists and between artists and visitors. Come and be a part of the process.\n\nView\n\nYang Fudong: Estranged Paradise, Works 1993–2013\n\nThis first midcareer survey of the work of Yang Fudong presents photographs, films, and video installations by a leading figure in China's contemporary art world and independent cinema movement. Yang reflects the ideals and anxieties of the generation that came of age after the Cultural Revolution and is struggling to find its place in the rapidly changing society of the new China.\n\nView\n\nZarouhie Abdalian / MATRIX 249\n\nMATRIX 249 showcases the work of Oakland-based artist Zarouhie Abdalian, whose work often responds to the specific attributes of a given location, architectural setting, or social landscape. For this exhibition, the artist has created new sculptures for Gallery A that explore the interrelated, yet distinct, states of noise, silence, and the absence of sound.\n\nView\n\nRebar: Kaleidoscape\n\nWe invite you to experience Kaleidoscape, an interactive seating sculpture designed by the San Francisco–based firm Rebar. Come rearrange the modular pieces to create a customized environment for study, relaxation, or socializing, or use the sections to create a crystalline landscape. Take a picture of your Kaleidoscape composition and share it on our photostream!\n\nView\n\nNicole Eisenman / MATRIX 248\n\nMATRIX 248 showcases the work of New York–based artist Nicole Eisenman, who has been steadfastly expanding dialogues surrounding painting and drawing since the 1990s. Intermixing styles associated with American Regionalism and the Italian Renaissance with German Expressionism, Eisenman brings history to bear in her canvases and drawings, yet twists the imagery to infuse these familiar forms with her own incisive social commentary and aesthetic voice.\n\nView\n\nRudolf de Crignis / MATRIX 245\n\nMATRIX 245, Rudolf de Crignis's first solo museum exhibition in the United States, brings together fourteen paintings and a series of graphite works on paper from 1991 to 2006. De Crignis (1948–2006) is best known for radiant abstract works, layered hues of blue that he called \"catalysts to create the space and the light.\"\n\nView\n\nArt for Human Rights\n\nAs part of the new BAMPFA program Art for Human Rights, we feature several works from Fernando Botero's provocative Abu Ghraib series, as well as a sculpture by the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei and newly acquired photographs by Ruth-Marion Baruch and Pirkle Jones that focus on aspects of the Black Panther movement.\n\nView\n\nBarry McGee\n\nThis first midcareer survey of the globally influential San Francisco–based artist showcases the broad range of Barry McGee's compassionate and vivacious work. Taking over the entire lower level of the museum, the exhibition includes rarely seen early etchings, letterpress printing trays and liquor bottles painted with his trademark cast of down-and-out urban characters, constellations of vibrant op-art painted panels, animatronic taggers, and an elaborate re-creation of a cacophonous street-corner bodega, along with many new projects.\n\nView\n\nLutz Bacher / MATRIX 242\n\nMATRIX 242 presents Bien Hoa (2006–07), an important but rarely seen series that sheds light on the elusive practice of Berkeley-based artist Lutz Bacher. The series juxtaposes enlargements of photographs taken by a soldier in Vietnam, unearthed by the artist at a local salvage store, with the versos of the originals, which reveal the soldier/photographer's handwritten annotations. As in much of her work, in this series Bacher uses found objects to prompt questions without offering clear answers.\n\nView\n\nAt the Edge: Recent Acquisitions\n\nAt the Edge features works that have entered the BAMPFA collection over the past two years that convey a sense of reaching-and sometimes crossing-limits of perception and experience. Among the works on view are dreamlike, mystical, and otherworldly visions, as well as images of life at its dramatic extremes.\n\nView\n\nHimalayan Pilgrimage: Liberation Through Sight\n\nThe journey of Himalayan Pilgrimage continues with Liberation Through Sight, which focuses on artwork created as vehicles to enlightenment. Works on view include an exceptionally rare set of seven paintings depicting the lineage of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama (c. 1815), as well as images of compassionate and wrathful deities of the Tibetan pantheon.\n\nView\n\nTables of Content: Ray Johnson and Robert Warner Bob Box Archive / MATRIX 241\n\nThe collagist Robert Warner has arranged the contents of thirteen boxes given to him by reclusive artist Ray Johnson (the \"Bob Boxes\") on tables and on the gallery walls. The collages, letters, drawings, beach trash and other found objects reveal Johnson's stream-of-consciousness flow through the matter and memory of everyday life. “Once you get into Johnson art, it's very hard to leave . . . take that immersive trip with a highly knowledgeable and profoundly committed guide” (Holland Cotter, New York Times).\n\nView\n\nAndy Warhol: Polaroids / MATRIX 240\n\nMeet celebrities and other fabulous people in this diverse selection of portraits taken by Warhol in the 1970s and 1980s with his favorite camera, the Polaroid Big Shot. A generous gift from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, these images reveal a little-known but seminal aspect of Warhol's practice.\n\nView\n\nSun Works\n\nThe sun's power to illuminate, yet also to scar, makes itself known in the works of Sarah Charlesworth and Chris McCaw on view in Sun Works. Part of a larger series that explores how current events are represented photographically in the media, Charlesworth's Arc of Total Eclipse (1979) tracks a solar eclipse across the front pages of multiple newspapers. Like Charlesworth, McCaw is also interested in questioning the role of the photograph as a simple representation of reality. For Sunburned GSP #488 (2011), he used a handmade view-camera to capture the path of the sun on a paper negative, creating an ambiguous, ethereal image.\n\nView\n\n1991: The Oakland-Berkeley Fire Aftermath Photographs by Richard Misrach\n\nIn October 1991, immediately following a catastrophic firestorm that struck the Oakland and Berkeley hills, renowned Bay Area photographer Richard Misrach ventured into the fire zone armed with his eight-by-ten-inch view camera, recording both stark vistas and intimate details of destroyed homes. To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the fire, BAMPFA and the Oakland Museum of California each present forty photographs from the series, including fourteen large-format images whose immense scale invites the viewer to enter into Misrach's quiet elegies.\n\nView\n\nSilke Otto-Knapp: A light in the moon / MATRIX 239\n\nWith layered washes of similarly hued watercolors, the canvases of London-based German artist Silke Otto-Knapp seem at first monochromatic, but slight changes in light or a viewer's position reveal figures or landscapes. Conflating the mediums of painting and performance, Otto-Knapp draws from the vocabulary of abstraction to renew our engagement in the act of seeing.\n\nView\n\nKurt Schwitters: Color and Collage\n\nThe first major museum presentation of Schwitters's work to appear in the United States in more than twenty-five years, Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage examines one of the most daring and innovative figures of the international avant-garde. Including assemblages, collages, sculpture, and a reconstruction of his room-size sculptural installation Merzbau, the exhibition places particular emphasis on the significance of color and light in the artist's work and explores the relationship between his collage and painting.\n\nView\n\nRome, Naples, Venice: Italian Masterworks from the BAMPFA Collection\n\nIn celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Italian unification, we present Rome, Naples, Venice: Italian Masterworks from the BAMPFA Collection. This exhibition brings together striking works by Mannerist and Baroque artists, including Caravaggio, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione, Giambattista Tiepolo, and Il Cavaliere d'Arpino, that reflect a vibrant range of artistic innovation from three of Italy's great cities.\n\nView\n\nThomson & Craighead: Flipped Clock\n\nOnline only\n\nFlipped Clock, by the British artist duo Jon Thomson and Alison Craighead, is an online digital clock display that is inverted vertically. Flipped Clock takes an image created to be a display (a clock face) and puts it on display. Inverting the numbers underscores this quotation and asks us to consider the artifice behind this taskmaster of modern life.\n\nView\n\nInarguably Uncertain: The 41st Annual University of California, Berkeley Master of Fine Arts Graduate Exhibition\n\nCome see the newest talents to arrive on the art-world stage in the Forty-First Annual M.F.A. exhibition. The M.F.A. exhibition at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive offers UC Berkeley M.F.A. graduates in art practice the opportunity to present their work in the museum galleries and, in the process, gain valuable experience working in a professional museum setting. This year's artists include Corinna Nicole Brewer, Chun-Shan (Sandie) Yi, Narangkar Glover, Plinio Alberto Hernandez, Merav Tzur, Chris E. Vargas, and David Gregory Wallace.\n\nView\n\nCreate\n\nCreate is a major survey exhibition that brings together work made at three pioneering centers for artists with developmental disabilities: Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, San Francisco's Creativity Explored, and NIAD Art Center in Richmond. Showcasing twenty artists, who work in a variety of media and styles, Create celebrates the thirty years of phenomenal achievement that has been nourished in these small but influential artistic communities.\n\nView\n\nJill Magid: Closet Drama / MATRIX 237\n\nJill Magid's recent work explores the intersection of governmental power and current events. For MATRIX, Magid considers a shooting at the Texas State Capitol by Fausto Cardenas in relation to Goethe's Faust, finding in the obvious but ultimately fruitful association similar tragic themes. By turning the gallery into a stage for the reading of Faust, a “closet drama,” the piece engages the larger themes of truth and fiction, language and translation, history and legend, gesture and performance, revelation and redaction, individual and institution.\n\nView\n\nShelley Jackson: Skin\n\nShelley Jackson's Skin-equal parts conceptual art, performance art, literature, and Internet art-literalizes many of the tropes of Web-based art, such as decentralized authorship and the networked (common) body. In 2003, Jackson posted a 2,095-word short story on the Internet and invited readers to tattoo one word from the story on their bodies. The participants, known as “words,” gradually publish the story in the world, blurring the boundaries between online and offline.\n\nView\n\nAbstract Now and Then\n\nThis exhibition in two parts draws on BAMPFA's rich permanent collection to present an overview of abstraction from the 1940s to 2010, including Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and Conceptualism, as well as works that exemplify how a new generation of artists is extending, reinterpreting, and challenging the legacy of these pivotal movements.\n\nView\n\nFuturefarmers: A Variation on the Powers of Ten / MATRIX 236\n\nSan Francisco-based collective Futurefarmers is spending the academic year in residency at the University exploring the production and the limits of knowledge. As a framework for this research, Futurefarmers is drawing on the iconic 1977 film Powers of Ten by Charles and Ray Eames and its central image of a picnic on a blanket. Research events will be documented and made available through the project website and related publication, and will also serve as fodder for a series of public programs at BAMPFA.\n\nView\n\nEmily Roysdon: If I Don't Move Can You Hear Me? / MATRIX 235\n\nArtist and writer Emily Roysdon's work explores the intersection of social, political, and aesthetic space. Roysdon's MATRIX project, produced largely on-site in Berkeley, consists of photographic work that engages with the limits, framing, and representation of movement(s), both bodily movement and social/political movements. As part of her collaborative practice, Roysdon has invited other writers to consider the project's vocabulary of use, regulation, structure, and frame in a publication that accompanies the exhibition.\n\nView\n\nVuk Ćosić: ASCII History of Moving Images\n\nVuk Ćosić created the ASCII History of Moving Images in 1998, just five years after the World Wide Web was introduced to the general public. Rendered online in the visual lingo of early computers, a black screen with green letters and numbers (ASCII characters), the piece presents clips that recall points when film, television, and video were finding their voices as the new media of their day. Online only: netart.bampfa.berkeley.edu.\n\nView\n\nRadical Light: Alternative Film and Video in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1945–2000 The Timeline\n\nWith the publication of Radical Light: Alternative Film and Video in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1945–2000, BAMPFA presents the first comprehensive overview of Bay Area avant-garde film and video.

For Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, an ongoing photographic project initiated in 2005, Dijkman has archived and organized over 9,000 images in order to rethink existing representations of the world. The project includes an accompanying website and a freely distributed newspaper.\n\nView\n\nJeff Crouse: Unlogo\n\nWith an iPhone app and a website, this online exhibition enables individuals to use a phone to identify logos occurring in cellular photographs and to replace them with images drawn from an online databank. Anyone can view and contribute to the databank, suggesting and uploading images that may be substituted for a particular logo, hence undoing the original logo-Unlogo.Online only: netart.bampfa.berkeley.edu.\n\nView\n\nFlowers of the Four Seasons: Ten Centuries of Art from the Clark Center for Japanese Art and Culture\n\nA dazzling array of Japan's greatest artistic traditions from ancient to modern will be presented in BAMPFA's major fall exhibition, which will feature a selection of more than 100 works of art from one of the most significant collections of Japanese art in America.\n\nView\n\nHauntology\n\nDrawn primarily from the museum's recent acquisitions of contemporary art, this exhibition explores a wide range of art through the lens of the concept of “hauntology,” a term coined by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida in 1993 to refer to the study of social, psychological, and cultural conditions in the post-Communist period.\n\nView\n\nAri Marcopoulos: Within Arm's Reach\n\nRecording New York's downtown art world or the emerging hip-hop scene, shooting snowboarders hurtling down a vertical mountain face or chronicling the vicissitudes of his own family life, photographer Ari Marcopoulos unerringly captures the zeitgeist. This midcareer retrospective surveys the intimate and compelling work of a key documentarian of contemporary culture.\n\nView\n\nMario García Torres: Je ne sais si c'en est la cause, What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger, and Some Reference Materials / MATRIX 227\n\nBy investigating and reconstructing ephemeral histories of conceptual art, Mario García Torres considers the functions of time and distance in our constructions of the past. The works in this exhibition excavate two such histories: Martin Kippenberger's attempt to establish a modern art museum on a Greek island, and Daniel Buren's murals at a now-derelict resort hotel.\n\nView\n\nThe Graphic Arts Loan Collection at UC Berkeley: 50 Years\n\nFor half a century, the Morrison Library's unique graphic arts loan program has been bringing original art to students. We celebrate the program's anniversary with prints by masters from Rembrandt to Matisse, once in the loan collection and now held by BAMPFA.\n\nView\n\nBruce Conner: Mabuhay Gardens\n\nBruce Conner's photographs from a legendary San Francisco nightclub document the demimonde of three-chord chaos that was the seventies punk scene, when acts like the Avengers, Negative Trend, and the Mutants were in their anarchic heyday. In his images, Conner captured both the outcry and the surrounding silence.\n\nView\n\nTrevor Paglen: The Other Night Sky / MATRIX 225\n\nTrained as both an artist and a geographer, Trevor Paglen uses an array of tactics to map the “black world” of U.S. military and intelligence activities. His MATRIX project scans the heavens for signs of covert activity, visualizing “the other night sky.”\n\nView\n\nHans Hofmann\n\nA cornerstone of the Berkeley Art Museum collection is an extraordinary group of paintings by Hans Hofmann (1880–1966), the world's most extensive museum collection of this German-born artist's work. The exhibition on view draws on this collection to span nearly thirty years of Hofmann's practice, from the figurative works of the 1930s to the explosive abstraction of the postwar period.\n\nView\n\nProtest in Paris 1968: Photographs by Serge Hambourg\n\nIn May 1968 in Paris, student and worker strikes against the conservative government of General Charles de Gaulle brought the country to a standstill. Images by French photographer Serge Hambourg provide a striking eyewitness account of this pivotal moment in political and cultural history.\n\nView\n\nMATRIX/REDUX\n\nOver the past thirty years, BAMPFA's acclaimed MATRIX Program has charted a unique course through the landscape of contemporary art. This anniversary exhibition samples from the program's history with special loans and works from the museum collection, including new acquisitions such as Kiki Smith's Crèche.\n\nView\n\nJames Lee Byars: The Perfect Audience\n\nThe art of James Lee Byars could be as grand as a global gesture or as intimate and fleeting as a kiss. A new exhibition brings together the delicate and monumental sides of the artist's work with artist's books, mail art, performance documentation, and other ephemera from BAMFA's Conceptual Art Study Center.\n\nView\n\nEnrique Chagoya: Borderlandia\n\nMickey Mouse meets Aztec gods and Francisco Goya meets Jerry Falwell in the first major museum retrospective of the work of Mexico-born, San Francisco–based artist Enrique Chagoya. Chagoya draws on the European canon, Mexican folk arts, and U.S. pop icons to create paintings, drawings, and prints that are politically charged, formally sophisticated, and often scathingly funny.\n\nView\n\nTomás Saraceno: Microscale, Macroscale, and Beyond: Large-Scale Implications of Small-Scale Experiments / MATRIX 224\n\nTomás Saraceno looks to the sky and sees possibilities for rethinking how we live in relation to one another. His artworks express at small scale his large-scale vision of a future in which cities take to the air, creating environments in a state of continuous physical and social transformation.\n\nView\n\nRIP.MIX.BURN.BAM.PFA\n\nCelebrating the cultural and artistic practice of the remix, digital artworks by Ken Goldberg and Valéry Grancher from the BAMPFA collection become open-source ingredients for new creations by Michael Joaquin Grey, The Studio for Urban Projects, Jonathon Keats, and Nathaniel Wojtalik and Iris Piers.\n\nView\n\nJoan Jonas: The Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things\n\nIn this recent installation, pioneering video artist Joan Jonas mines the cultural terrain of the American Southwest, as well as more personal territories. Jonas's work is “at once mysterious and transparent, strange yet familiar in an almost universal sense. She is like a magician who dazzles us while revealing the secret to every trick.”-N.Y. Times\n\nView\n\nOne Way or Another: Asian American Art Now\n\nBringing together a multiplicity of media and methods and representing widely divergent points of view, this major exhibition presents works by seventeen young artists who challenge and extend the category of “Asian American art.” “The works in (the exhibition) are pleasantly uncategorizable. . . . And by virtue of being so conceptually diverse, so defiantly without formula, they reveal a maturation, or at least an evolution, in the way that these creators view the very ideas of Asianness, Americanness, and art itself.”-S.F. Chronicle\n\nView\n\nRosalind Nashashibi: Bachelor Machines Part I / MATRIX 223\n\nBritish artist Rosalind Nashashibi makes quiet, deliberate films that luxuriate in incidental details of the everyday. Bachelor Machines Part I, her film installation in the MATRIX Gallery, chronicles the voyage of a cargo vessel from Italy to Sweden. In observing life on board, the film obliquely reveals neglected aspects of global commerce.\n\nView\n\nDavid Goldblatt: Intersections\n\nAcclaimed South African photographer David Goldblatt has spent the past five decades documenting his native country and its people. For his Intersections project, Goldblatt traversed the country observing the crosscurrents of \"ideas, values, ethics, postures, people, and things\" since the end of apartheid. The resulting photographs sharply capture the political and physical geographies of South Africa in the twenty-first century.\n\nView\n\nAbbas Kiarostami: Image Maker\n\nCelebrated as one of the world's great contemporary filmmakers, Abbas Kiarostami is also an accomplished still photographer. In conjunction with a retrospective of this Iranian master's films at the PFA Theater, a selection of his poetic photographs, including the new series Rain and Trees and Crows, is on view in the BAMPFA galleries.\n\nView\n\nAndrea Zittel: A-Z Travel Trailer Unit\n\nThe exhibition of Andrea Zittel's A-Z Travel Trailer Unit has been delayed while it undergoes extensive conservation treatment. We apologize for any inconvenience.Andrea Zittel creates personalized designs for living, useful artworks that make no distinction between the conceptual and the utilitarian. Her faintly retro travel habitat brings a touch of the trailer park to the museum's sculpture garden.\n\nView\n\nAllison Smith: Notion Nanny / MATRIX 222\n\nAllison Smith has some interesting notions about the meanings of history and craft in contemporary life. In her latest project, inspired by nineteenth-century peddler dolls called “notion nannies,” she casts herself as an itinerant apprentice, working with other craftspeople to exchange ideas, skills, objects, and experiences along the way.\n\nView\n\nScott Burton: Table and Tableau\n\nIn the late 1970s and '80s, Scott Burton made a series of works exploring subtle behavioral cues and social relations through tableaux vivants, enacted \"living pictures.\" A suite of these works, including a recorded performance and related sculptures, extends Measure of Time's consideration of time-based art.\n\nView\n\nKunstkammer\n\nAn eccentric array of prints, drawings, and photographs from the BAMPFAcollections fills the Theater Gallery, with works by Dürer, Whistler, Gauguin, Basquiat, and many others hung together in the style of a sixteenth-century Kunstkammer-an \"art chamber\" offering objects of scholarship and wonder.\n\nView\n\nHonoring a Tradition, Honoring a Teacher: A Tribute to James Cahill\n\nProfessor Emeritus James Cahill made many contributions to the UC community during his 30-year tenure, none more lasting than the stellar collection of Chinese and Japanese paintings that are the core of the Asian art collection at BAMPFA. This exhibition presents highlights from that collection and pays tribute to a scholar whose passion for Chinese art is inspiring and infectious.\n\nView\n\nA Rose Has No Teeth: Bruce Nauman in the 1960s\n\n“Bruce Nauman is a national treasure, the most American of American artists, and one of the most celebrated, both at home and abroad.”-Vanity Fair. A Rose Has No Teeth is the first exhibition to explore in depth Nauman's relationship to the place where he created his earliest and often most strikingly innovative works.\n\nView\n\nGrapefruit\n\nIn the spirit of imagination, BAMPFA presents a selection of \"instruction paintings\" from Yoko Ono's groundbreaking publication Grapefruit, which John Lennon cited as a powerful influence in the writing of his song \"Imagine.\" Gracefully expressive, enchanting, and original, Ono's instructions allow you to take the art home in the form of a do-it-yourself idea-along with a free IMAGINE PEACE button, a gift from Ono to museum visitors.\n\nView\n\nMeasure of Time\n\nTime is of the essence in American art of the past century. Measure of Time showcases the museum's important 20th-century collection along with some significant loans to explore, over time, how artists have worked with temporality and duration. In two galleries of paintings, sculptures, and media (both analog and digital), time and motion are compressed, fragmented, mechanized, sped up, and slowed down to an almost imperceptible pace.\n\nView\n\nIn a Different Light\n\nIn a Different Light,co-curated by Nayland Blake and Lawrence Rinder, explores the resonance of gay and lesbian experience in twentieth-century American art. Remarkably, these artists, living in a generally hostile social climate-amidst the constant threat of \"gay-bashings,\" proscriptive legislative initiatives, and surrounded by the tragedy of AIDS-not only persist in making art, but do so in a spirit of humor, generosity, and flamboyance.\n\nView"
