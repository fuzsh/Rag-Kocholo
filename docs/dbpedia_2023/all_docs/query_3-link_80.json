        "text": "Artlyst – Judy Chicago Revelations Book ReviewThe manuscript, a long-held secret by Chicago, presents a revolutionary retelling of human history, resurrecting the narratives of women that have been systematically erased. Born alongside her iconic installation “The Dinner Party” in the mid-1970s, “Revelations” is a cornerstone in comprehending Chicago’s artistic vision. The work is deeply rooted in her extensive research into goddess worship and women’s history, offering a vivid and lavishly illustrated narrative that spans fifty years of dedicated practice. Click here for details\n\nThe Standard – Judy Chicago’s work is proof that paradigms are there to be shatteredAmerican artist, author, feminist, ecofeminist, historian, humanist, and educator Judy Chicago is back in London. At the age of 84 and with an art career spanning over six decades, she gives us hope that paradigms and stereotypes can be shifted and that it is never too late to rewrite history, highlighting the achievements of women from prehistory to now: Herstory. An advocate for women’s cultural history, Chicago’s path to success was far from easy, as she worked on a totally alternative art historical paradigm, challenging the male dominated art world in the late 1960s. Click here for details\n\nThe Times – Judy Chicago hates men and left me feeling slapped around — it felt goodThe feminist artist Judy Chicago hates men. Wandering through her angry and tumultuous show at the Serpentine Gallery, I felt like a trespassing schoolboy who was getting his face smacked. “This is for picking your nose!” Smack. ”This is for destroying the planet!” Smack. “This is for making God a man!” Smack. By the time I slunk out of this weird but impactful event, I was rubbing my cheek, gingerly. I’m exaggerating. You have to with Chicago. Click here for details\n\nThe Observer – Judy Chicago: Revelations review – six decades of table-turning body politicsBest known for her 70s Dinner Table homage to heroic women, the American artist moves centre stage at last in a show of variously blazing, bold, crude, generous work inspired by female subjugation and power. Fierce but gentle, blatant yet often graceful: Judy Chicago’s six-decade survey at the Serpentine North Gallery is not at all as expected. This is partly because of everything that this show omits. There are no death masks, bloody menstrual pads or caustic needlework. There are no gathered-lace vulvas standing in for the mind and art of Emily Dickinson. Click here for details\n\nThe Week in Art podcast – The Mona Lisa’s endless, and problematic, allure; Judy Chicago; and New ObjectivityIn London, remarkably, Judy Chicago has just opened her first major multidisciplinary survey in a British public gallery, at the Serpentine North. We talk to her about the show. Click here for details\n\niNews – ‘I tried to be a guy. I got tired of it’: Judy Chicago’s life in feminist artOne day in 1982, Judy Chicago visited the Sistine Chapel in Rome and looked up at the 60-foot ceiling to the towering image of Michelangelo’s The Creation of Adam.\n\n“It really aggravated me,” the American artist says, all these years later, with a heavy Midwestern drawl. What bothered her was a patriarchal vision of the creation story that was so contrary to the reality she knew. “No, a male god does not reach out his finger and create man,” she laughs with a deep and generous cackle. “Women give birth. So I wanted to correct this pernicious myth.” Click here for details\n\nThe Evening Standard – Feminist firebrand Judy Chicago on her new London art retrospective: ‘It’s so overwhelming’On the eve of her retrospective at London’s Serpentine North Gallery, artist Judy Chicago is visibly moved. “It’s so overwhelming for me, because there’s a lot of work in this show I never thought would be shown.” Even at the age of 84, Chicago looks like a rock star with bleached blonde hair and gold nails. Dressed in a red smock and boot-cut jeans, she carries a glittery cane. She knows how to make her presence felt. Click here for details\n\nWomen’s Wear Daily – Judy Chicago Reveals All in New Show at the Serpentine Galleries in LondonIt was a little over a year ago, and Judy Chicago was getting fed up with the relentless pestering from Hans Ulrich Obrist, the curator and artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries. Obrist had wanted to do a retrospective of Chicago’s work through the lens of her drawings, and was looking for unseen work. But it was a difficult ask for Chicago, who’s used to working on a grand scale and whose many projects have been realized and displayed around the world.\n\nClick here for details\n\nTime Out – Judy Chicago: ‘Revelations’Erased, forgotten, overlooked, subjugated and dominated; Judy Chicago saw what history, what society, had done to women, and she did something about it. The pioneering American feminist has spent decades using her art to call out injustice at the hands of the patriarchy. She’s most well known for smoke-based desert performances and ‘The Dinner Party’, a hugely influential installation celebrating thousands of overlooked women. Both are represented here in slightly disappointing documentary form, but this show focuses instead on her drawings and paintings. Click here for details\n\nTelegraph – Judy Chicago: Revelations – No longer the priestess of ‘pornography’Intense: that’s the vibe inside the Serpentine’s new retrospective for the 84-year-old American feminist artist Judy Chicago, which includes, among 200 or so works, various trippy, incandescent visions of women giving birth. Click here for details\n\nObserver – ‘My time has come!’: feminist artist Judy Chicago on a tidal wave of recognition at 84On the eve of her UK retrospective Revelations, the veteran US feminist artist known for her large collaborative art installation pieces such as The Dinner Party – and for dividing the critics – is in celebratory mood. Click here for details\n\nArt Basel – Is this the end of the art world’s taboo around parenthood?Forty years ago, Judy Chicago set about countering biblical origin stories that pictured man as humanity’s central creative force: think Michelangelo’s bearded elder bestowing Adam with the touch of life. Her idea was to celebrate mothers giving birth, but her research uncovered an almost total art historical void. She had to go straight to the source, to actual mothers, to ‘build a form language almost from scratch’ she wrote in 1985. Chicago discovered then that ‘not only birth’ but ‘the very nature of this subject…was shrouded in myth, mystery, and stereotype.’ Click here for details\n\nFAD Magazine – Judy Chicago ‘Revelations’ will be the artist’s largest solo presentation in a London institutionSerpentine will present the first major interdisciplinary, immersive institutional exhibition in London of Judy Chicago. Focused on drawing, it will bring together new and little-seen works, preparatory studies alongside audio, visual and new technology materials. Click here for details\n\nWallpaper – Politics, protest and potential: the Barbican explores the power of textiles in artTextiles have often been saddled with restrictive definitions around craft and gender stereotypes, when in fact, they have formed some of the most radical and progressive works of the last century. Many artists have played with these definitions, creating subversive feminist works and expansive sculptural forms. ‘Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art’, a show of 50 intergenerational artists at the Barbican Centre in London, explores quite how far the medium has evolved in the last sixty years. Click here for details\n\nLA Book Review – The Secret Growing: On the New Spiritual Art CanonCarrington, Pelton, Varo, and other artist-mystics have also been fêted in the last five years, their names spoken in such reverent tones that we might momentarily forget their historical exclusion from the museum’s hallowed halls. But as these artists come up for “reevaluation” among modern art critics and gatekeepers, the inquiries feel too narrow. Within the expansive, magical contexts of their work, a question such as who invented abstraction—a popular debate with af Klint currently at its center—loses meaning. Why contort-someone into a preexisting framework when it is their unbounded vision we most need to receive? Judy Chicago’s The City of Ladies, part of the feminist icon’s \"Herstory\" retrospective at New York City’s New Museum, is among the exhibitions and texts that are presenting alternative ways to define a canon. Click here for details\n\nL’OFFICIEL Paris – A New Exhibition at the New Museum Celebrates Legendary Art Pioneer Judy ChicagoLegendary American Artist Judy Chicago is celebrated in an exhibition at the New Museum. The exhibition, curated by Massimiliano Gioni, Gary Carrion-Murayari, Margot Norton, and Madeline Weisburg, extends over four museum floors. With a career spanning sixty years, Judy Chicago has created numerous masterful pieces through several mediums. The exhibition explores the many facets of the iconic artist through painting, sculpture, installation, drawing, textiles, photography, stained glass, embroidery, and engraving.

The man is holding a kiddush cup; the woman is blessing a pair of candles. Around the table sit men, women and children representing the world’s ethnicities and religions: a Christian clergyman wearing a cross, a Muslim man wearing a white keffiyeh, a Black woman in a red robe. Each of the guests has a hand draped over seatmate’s shoulder. Click here for details\n\nThe Guardian – Life’s rich tapestry: the unsung wonders of textile artFibre art has long been a subversive medium. A new show at the Barbican unravels its power to reflect on everything from giving birth to racial oppression. A survey exploring the movement’s inter-generational cross-currents, it encompasses everything from hand-embroidered hankies to big sculptural installations. “Textiles as a term is so capacious and expansive,” says Lotte Johnson, one of Unravel’s three curators. “We’re looking at how cultural dialogues as well as poetic and personal associations speak across geographies and time.” Click here for details\n\nNext Avenue – Feminist Artist Judy Chicago Whose History is HerstoryThe \"herstory\" of groundbreaking, feminist, multi-hyphenated artist Judy Chicago spans six decades of boundary-pushing creative activity in a kaleidoscope of media — painting, printmaking, ceramics, quilting, tapestry, embroidery, stained glass, even pigmented smoke and auto body spray-painting. Click here for details\n\nDazed – UNRAVEL: The Power and Politics of Textiles in ArtOn the heels of \"(Re)sisters,\" London’s Barbican will open \"Unravel: The Power and Politics of Textiles in Art,\" which looks at how artists have challenged power structures and reimagined the world through textiles, fibre, and thread. The exhibition will pay homage to the seemingly unsuspecting medium of textiles, and 50 international, intergenerational artists and their works will be explored throughout, focussing on how textiles can communicate ideas of power, resistance, and survival through narratives of violence, imperialism and exclusion, as well as stories of resilience, love, and hope. The stellar list of artists involved includes Sanford Biggers, Yinka Shonibare CBE RA, Judy Chicago, Diedrick Brackens, Faith Ringgold, Tschalabala Self, and many more.\n\nUnravel will also travel to Amsterdam’s Stedelijk Museum in September 2024 Click here for details\n\nHyperallergic – When Feminism Ruled CalArtsJudy Chicago’s most famous work, the elaborate place setting known as “The Dinner Party,” literally created a place for women at the proverbial table. But Chicago’s goal to reformulate the canon went far beyond individual artworks. For four years, she spearheaded an experimental, performance-based studio at California Institute of the Arts, an incubator that would produce some of the most well-known second-wave feminist artists and history and, as the exhibition The Feminist Art Program (1970–1975): Cycles of Collectivity argues, a diverse third-wave movement, too. Click here for details\n\nLondonist – Art Exhibitions To See In LondonThese days, textiles are being used to address ideas of gender and sexuality, the movement and displacement of people, and histories of extraction and violence — as well as understanding the world through connecting with ancestral practices and communing with nature. Bringing together 100 works by over 50 international artists, Barbican brings together the artists taking textile art in new and exciting directions. Click here for details\n\nThe Guardian – Observer critics’ culture highlights for 2024American art star Judy Chicago gets a solo show in her 80s\n\nat the Serpentine Gallery, London (22 May to 1 September), her first major exhibition in a London gallery. Most famous for her 1970s installation \"The Dinner Party,\" which is pretty much Exhibit A of any feminist history of art, with its famous 39 settings for historic heroines, Chicago has spent her life fighting male domination of art and culture.\n\nClick here for details\n\nThe Evening Standard – The best exhibitions to see in London in 2024There's no city better than London for art, and this is a hill we are prepared to die on. This year is looking particularly rich, especially for\n\nwomen artists , with a bumper crop of solo and duo exhibitions across public institutions, for both contemporary and historical figures, raising their profile higher than it's ever been. Click here for details\n\nArt Forum – Jan Avigikos on Judy ChicagoREVISIONIST HISTORY 2.0, fully dialed up over the past few decades, is once again on a mission to rediscover the many significant artists who were marginalized and never given their due. Patriarchal bias led the charge in discounting certain artists because of their gender, skin color, sexuality, or cultural identity, as straight white men ruled the canon and owned virtually every piece of modernist art real estate in the twentieth century. Clearing away the muck of misinformation, waking up to forms of serial discrimination perpetrated by all our reputable institutions, retrofitting the historical record to reflect the diversity that flourished beneath the story of art’s “official” veneer—indeed, the amount of excavation and correction required is exhausting and seemingly endless. Click here for details\n\nHero Magazine – “Rage can eat you alive or rage can fuel creativity” – Judy Chicago in conversation with Hans Ulrich ObristAcross six decades, artist, activist, curator and feminist icon Judy Chicago has been crafting an audacious and uncompromising body of work underpinned by the question: ‘What if women ruled the world?’ Fuelled by a desire to end the erasure of female artists, Chicago has dismantled and redefined the canon for herself and her contemporaries whilst paving the way for a future generation of changemakers. Click here for details\n\nThe New York Times – How Artists Are Breaking the Taboos Around Depicting BirthNot long after completing “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), her monumental installation dedicated to historical women, the artist Judy Chicago began researching depictions of birth in Western art — only to discover there were almost none. “If men had babies, there would be thousands of images of the crowning,” she said. In an effort to fill this void, she went straight to the source. She witnessed a live birth — the San Francisco-based designer Karin Hibma agreed to let Chicago sketch in the delivery room — and sent detailed questionnaires to more than 100 mothers. (Sample questions: Why did you want to have a baby? What physical changes have become permanent?) Part of her resulting work, “The Birth Project” series (1980-85), made up of painted, woven and embroidered images of women in labor, is currently on view at Chicago’s retrospective at the New Museum in New York. Many of the images are epic in tone and size: Breasts become mountains and rivers flow from between open legs. Chicago was, as she later wrote, “building a form language almost ‘from scratch,’” one that linked the act of birth to divine creation. But to this day, according to Massimiliano Gioni, one of the show’s curators, the series has never been shown in full.

Juliet once humorously referred to them all as 'Dinner Party Leftovers', but now they've reached the point where they are 'Dinner Party Dessert'. In addition to the people who attended in person, over 470 tuned in live on Judy Chicago's Instagram.

The words are emblazoned on a colossal, medieval-esque tapestry in Herstory, her exhibition at the New Museum in New York. The tapestry is set up like an altarpiece and forms the backdrop to an almost 1,000-year-old illuminated manuscript by the composer, artist, mystic and visionary Hildegard of Bingen. A woman with a wild amount of freedom for her time, Hildegard was able to speak publicly and correspond with the p Click here for details\n\nFinancial Times – Judy Chicago, New Museum review — feminist artist finally takes her deserved place in the modern canonIf looking at Judy Chicago’s art makes you uncomfortable, well, good. The essential 60-year retrospective at New York’s New Museum contains such an abundant supply of provocations, bloodied menstrual pads, gaping sexes, sarcastic needlework and other feminist flexes that it would make anyone break into a sweat. And yet the show is an exhilarating corrective, airlifting Chicago out of footnote status and dropping her squarely in the American canon where she has always belonged. It’s taken her decades to win respect from the establishment she spent a lifetime battering. Click here for details\n\nArt & Object – Judy Chicago’s “Herstory” Makes Space for Women Artists, Before and AfterAfter six decades in the art world, Judy Chicago is finally getting her due. Her exhibition “Herstory,” currently on view at the New Museum, is the artist’s first comprehensive survey exhibition in New York.\n\nOrganized by the New Museum's ambitious curatorial team including Artistic Director Massimiliano Gioni, Gary Carrion-Murayari, Margot Norton (who is also Chief Curator at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Archive in California), and Assistant Curator Madeline Weisburg, the show is a survey of Chicago’s work throughout various stages of her career. Ranging from the 1960s to a present day ongoing conversational project, the show looks at the role of feminism through the eyes of female and gender non-conforming artists who have largely gone under-recognized throughout the years. Intimately exploring Chicago’s oeuvre, the New Museum also houses an exhibition within an exhibition titled, “The City of Ladies” and features eighty artists ranging from the late Renaissance’s Artemisia Gentileschi, to Sojourner Truth, Dora Maar, and Leonora Carrington. Click here for details\n\nThe Art Newspaper – Judy Chicago: the veteran artist backing great forgotten women and creating beauty from painJudy Chicago, the godmother of feminist art, knows all about making in the margins. When her installation The Dinner Party was first revealed to the public in 1979, its theatrical staging and meticulously researched conceit—a figurative “seat at the table” for more than 1,000 important female historical figures—drew derision from male critics and saw its initial tour cancelled. While the mainstream art world turned its nose up at Chicago’s endeavour, a dedicated audience was forming. After a bumpy start, The Dinner Party went on to enjoy an international, 16-venue tour in the early 1980s, buoyed by a wave of private donations and bedrock enthusiasm. In 2007, The Dinner Party went on permanent display at New York’s Brooklyn Museum, a monument against women’s erasure from the canon.

It was, the artist explained, “a paean to masculinity” and explored the idea that if women were the ones largely in charge of designing buildings, perhaps they’d be a lot less phallic. Click here for details\n\nVogue – Feminist Icon Judy Chicago on Aging, Makeup, and “Gratuitous Beauty”Artist Judy Chicago sees the world through colored lenses. Literally—sometimes lilac, sometimes pink, many shades of blue—but never the standard clear. “Actually, the world doesn’t look different with these on,” the artist shares over Zoom from her New Mexico studio (today’s shades are deep hue of purpley-navy). “I've worn glasses my entire life and since color is the hallmark of my work, this just made sense.” Click here for details\n\nNew York Times – Judy Chicago Makes ‘Herstory’: Beyond the Ladies of the Dinner PartyJudy Chicago was anxious, unusually so. For most of her six-decade career as a feminist multimedia-ist, she was out of step with the art establishment — occasionally crossing paths with the institutions that canonize cultural weight but mostly zigging off course: a 5-foot-1 dynamo in platform sneakers, doggedly pursuing her own goals.

A Sweeping Survey at the New Museum Proves How Ahead-of-the-Curve the Feminist Icon Really IsIn a clever curatorial twist, there is a knockout show-within-a-show in “Herstory,” the compelling six-decade survey of the feminist icon Judy Chicago which opened at the New Museum in New York today. Amid floors devoted solely to Chicago’s work, one section, entitled “The City of Ladies,” places her works in dialogue with those of other women artists from across the centuries, from Hilma af Klint to Frida Kahlo.

Later, in the early 1980s, she launched The Birth Project, where she studied creation myths and canvassed women about their birthing experiences. Always dedicated to feminist questions, Chicago has been present on the art scene for six decades, delivering provocative and deeply engaging work that explores the pressing issues of our time.

Seasoned hosts know that a party is a success when those who weren’t invited talk about it—whether out of admiration or envy. Nobody knows this better than Judy Chicago, the artist who forged The Dinner Party, an anatomically inspired installation featuring 39 place settings laid out on a triangular table for historical (and some mythical) women, from Eleanor of Aquitaine to Georgia O’Keeffe. Following the debut of the piece at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 1979, the art world was swift to label Chicago a feminist and political firebrand. “People only considered it political because it challenged the prevailing paradigm,” Chicago says now. And she’s been challenging it ever since.

The 84-year-old artist took the social construction and implications of gender as the starting point for a ractice that evolved into a universe of systemic interrogations—from the experience of birth, to the abyss of the Holocaust, to the urgency of environmental collapse. That career, along with its interdisciplinary and crosscultural prescience, was honored last night as the worlds of art and fashion united to celebrate Judy Chicago's largest survey to date, \"Herstory.\" Click here for details\n\nArt News – Women’s History Foregrounds Judy Chicago’s New Museum RetrospectiveFeminist art icon Judy Chicago examines the role of women and history in her paintings and collaborative art installations showcasing images of birth, creation, and power. Spread across four floors of the New Museum, Chicago’s latest retrospective is a two-part exhibition. “Herstory” presents more than six decades of Chicago’s work in various mediums, including studies for her famed installation, The Dinner Party (1974–79), which is permanently on view at the Brooklyn Museum, alongside early experimental work to her most recent pieces. “The City of Ladies” is a showcase of women artists and thinkers whose work is essential to the progression of women’s history and art, such as Hilma af Klint, Hildegard of Bingen, Simone de Beauvoir, Artemisia Gentileschi, Frida Kahlo, Virginia Woolf, and more.

So far, he New York City Ballet has thrown the event to top, inviting A-listers from every industry to celebrate 75 years of their famed fashion gala. But the Lincoln Center party is hardly all to expect this fall. There’s still the Academy Museum’s 3rd annual gala, LACMA’s celebration of art and film with Gucci, and so much more.

In 1968, a year when police officers were busy tear-gassing peaceful protesters, she covered a Pasadena, California, street in benign whitesmoke. Similar performance pieces followed, and there’s a strong argument to be made thatsmoke is the medium in which she has done her finest work. In 1969, she briefly engulfedthe façade of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in a yellowish-orange haze (pictured). “Iwanted to see if I could make it look like it was burning down,” she explained. “Museumswere very inhospitable to women artists’ work.” Click here for details\n\nFlash Art- “Inside Other Spaces: Environments by Women Artists1956–1976” Haus der Kunst / MunichOne of the most notable strengths of the exhibition is its curatorial vision, which foregrounds the works of artists who have often been marginalized or overlooked in art-historical discourse. By focusing exclusively on women artists from 1956 to 1976, the exhibition provides a concentrated exploration of their contributions to the development of environmental and relational art. Curators Andrea Lissoni and Marina Pugliese explained that they specifically wanted to show only actual environments that the public could enter and physically explore. This embodied approach allows viewers to better understand the specific challenges faced by women artists during this period and the innovative ways they tackled them through formal exploration. Judy Chicago, speaking about her\n\nFeather Room\n\n(1966), said that her biggest desire was to make a soft, feminine, cocooned environment. Thousands of chicken feathers are heaped on the floor, which visitors can walk upon or immerse themselves within. Tania Mouraud explained that her work\n\nWe Used To Know (1970–2023) was initially closed to the public when she first conceived it. This time she opened it up, making it even more provocative to whomever might enter. Inside, a perimeter of spotlights brightly illuminate a room’s interior, where the spectator is forced to confront a mysterious metal column.

The show follows her 60-year, multidisciplinary career, from her 1960s sculptural experiments in Minimalism to The Female Divine (2022), a series of 11 monumental banners that pose questions such as, “What if Women Ruled the World?” (A few years ago, they adorned the runway of Dior’s spring/summer 2020 haute couture show.) The museum approached this exhibition as a retrospective-meets-introspective, for after exploring Chicago’s singular impact producing art that confronts social inequality, environmentalism, and genocide, among numerous global issues, the show features an exhibition-within-an-exhibition celebrating other women. “The City of Ladies” features more than 80 female artists, writers, and cultural figures, including Hilma af Klint, Artemisia Gentileschi, Frida Kahlo, and Virginia Woolf, who have shaped both Chicago’s practice and art history at large.

A related “exhibition-within-the-exhibition” will accompany the show, featuring materials from more than 80 artists, writers, and thinkers, including the likes of Artemisia Gentileschi, Hilma af Klint, Zora Neale Hurston, Frida Kahlo, and Virginia Woolf.\n\nOct. 12–Jan. 14 Click here for details\n\nV Magazine – Heroes: Judy ChciagoAt the entrance of Judy Chicago’s 1970 Cal State Fullerton exhibition hung a sign that read, “Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and freely chooses her own name Judy Chicago.” That declaration, made almost 40 years ago, still sums up the artist’s work and mission today. Chicago and her practice have come to define contemporary art, a field that was denied to women for many centuries. Since then, she’s shown at the Brooklyn Museum, collaborated with renowned Dior Creative Director Maria Grazia Chiuri, and been named one of TIME 100’s Most Influential People. Now looking back at her over 50-year career, the artist is ready to tell her journey–on her own terms. And much like the artist herself, her autobiography doesn’t hold anything back.

How Will I Die? is a series of eight paintings of Chicago in different death scenes – in the arms of her husband, hooked up to a machine, screaming in pain. In this, the artist is naked and curled up in the foetal position with “Will I leave as I arrived?” written above her. It is vulnerable and harrowing, but there is power in Chicago’s use of portraiture to test out scenarios and therefore maintain agency before a terrifying inevitability.

So, it’s fitting that the great feminist artist’s first New York survey, “Judy Chicago: Herstory,” opening at the New Museum in October, will pay homage to women throughout history.\n\nIn an exhibition-within-the-exhibition title “City of Ladies,” features work by more than 80 women artists, writers, and cultural figures. Some are art history’s most famous women, such as Frida Kahlo, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Artemisia Gentileschi, as well as the likes of Paula Modersohn-Becker, Elizabeth Catlett, and Käthe Kollwitz.

The concept of a mentorship, though, as seen in the examples below, is widely variable. Some mentors are also friends, though a close connection is not always necessary. Sometimes, all it takes is a word of encouragement at the right time to alter the course of cultural history.

In every region, specific movements and discourses about gender emerge, entangled with local political struggles and cultural histories. Ideas shift and move between geographies, gaining new allegiances, oppositions, and transformations. Individuals invent their own everyday methods of pushing on gender norms, with or without any affinity to the word “feminist.” These countless feminisms produce both methods of resistance—for critiquing and countering oppressive power structures—as well as alternative projections—for imagining and enacting more equitable, supportive, and sustainable worlds. A vast landscape of feminist spatial practices around the world, stretching back in time and forwards into the future, resists power and imagines new futures through experimental storytelling, community-building, educating, material testing, and fabricating new architectures.

When luxury brands collaborate with female artists and talk about empowerment, what they usually mean is dressing actors for the red carpet or making jumpsuits for a pop star’s stadium tour. Dior is no slouch on that front – Olivia Colman, Natalie Portman and Anya Taylor-Joy were gowned-up for the last Oscars – but Chiuri goes much further. In January 2020, Dior’s haute couture collection was shown inside The Female Divine, a kind of vast blow-up birth canal designed by American feminist artist Judy Chicago and installed in the garden of the Musée Rodin in Paris. It was decorated with embroidered slogans including “If women ruled the world would buildings resemble wombs?” which Chicago said was a rallying call against the phallicism of urban architecture. Two years earlier, Chiuri enlisted the escaramuzas, daredevil female Mexican rodeo riders whose costumes are drawn from the uniforms of women who fought in the Mexican revolution, to star in a show; that same year she collaborated with Israeli feminist choreographer Sharon Eyal to have sinewy, bodysuited dancers weave around the models on the catwalk, a representation of women’s right to control their bodies and the space around them.

The installations are both massive tables extravagantly set in a way that feels reverent and over the top. Chicago’s table forms a large open triangle, with each uniquely designed place setting dedicated to an important historical woman. By contrast, Anaya’s table is a filled-in rectangle with bench seating and place settings that, though individually unique because of their organic shapes, are all in the same style. Though Chicago’s piece is more solemn and Anaya’s more absurd, the use of the dinner party vernacular in both works alludes to traditional female roles of cooking, hosting, decorating, and craft.

They took out the walls, replaced the windows and reconstructed it entirely into a feminist, site-specific art exhibition - a first of its kind. Under the guidance of American artist Judy Chicago and co-educator, Canadian artist Miriam Shapiro, this group of students created an immersive experience, combined with art performances and interactive sessions. The showcase, titled Womanhouse, was received with acclaim and saw over 10,000 people pass through its doors. The art exhibition served not only as a space to view art, but also to come together as a community to discuss issues that were urgent - to open up socio-political dialogue.

Instead, Wo/Manhouse 2022 took up residence in a rambling, dated house in Belen, New Mexico. Each of the nineteen artists—all based in New Mexico—took over different rooms with installations developed collaboratively with Chicago, artist Nancy Youdelman, and each other: bathrooms, the kitchen, dining room, pantry, and so on. Growing from the roots of its 1972 predecessor, Wo/Manhouse reconsiders and expands on the conception of gender within the sphere of the home.

The exhibition’s title quotes theorist Judith Butler’s response to a question about why ‘language is hurtful’, excerpted in Claudia Rankine’s Citizen: An American Lyric (2014). For Butler, language is one distressing result of sharing a world with other people. We are exposed to each other and create categories (race, sexuality, gender) that constrain unique subjectivities. These categories, for guest curators Marcelle Joseph and Legacy Russell, appear in the strange, violent collisions of language and visual life, uniting 25 international, intergenerational artists in this exploration of identity, visibility and power.

Titled “What Water Knows, the Land Remembers,” the exhibition was framed as a “move inland” from the shoreline, which served as an organizing idea for the inaugural biennial (“The Shoreline Dilemma”) that Hopkins and Bastien curated in 2019. The works on view were meant to suggest how land, like water, is an archive, and to ask questions about what current inhabitants have inherited.

The change would mean women and girls no longer having the same rights their mothers and grandmothers fought for if Republican-controlled states move quickly to end abortion access and Republicans in Congress attempt to enact a nationwide abortion ban. Leading US women’s rights activists and scholars tell us how they feel about the news.

The men reserved special scorn for The Dinner Party, Ms. Chicago’s 1979 sculptural installation whose place settings, inspired by illustrious women, incorporate china painting and embroidery. “The womanly arts?” she said in mock outrage during a recent video call.

Colour is a doorway to many aspects of the human condition—from the terrifying to the sublime.” Chromatic play is especially evident in her Smoke Sculptures™, as she calls them, which are large-scale, site-specific installations composed of non-toxic multicoloured smoke and other pyrotechnics. Right now, she’s preparing for A Tribute to Toronto, a smoke sculpture that will debut at Sugar Beach overlooking Lake Ontario as part of the Toronto Biennial of Art this June.

Whether bold and bright like Chicago’s Hitch Your Wagon to Star (2000) – which combines painting, appliqué, embroidery and quilting – or wantonly whimsical, as is the case with Catunda’s Recheada (Stuffed, 2019) – a crimson acrylic painting on fabric, whose shape resembles a flaccid tongue – the two artists’ textile pieces expand painterly gesture by blending brushwork with needlework.

Indeed, the sculptures in Judy Chicago in Glass, the artist’s latest series of large glass heads and hands on view at Miami’s Nina Johnson Gallery, could be the long-lost limbs of The Dinner Party’s phantom guests.

This exhibition focuses on two series from this lesser-known facet of Chicago’s career, called Head’s Up and Hands, some of which incorporate cast glass with bronze, evoking both the fragile and strong physicality of their subjects. In addition to a series of earlier drawings that correspond with the glass works, the show includes a new large-scale abstract sculpture titled Zig Zag (1965/2021), a steel version of an earlier piece made when Chicago produced her signature Minimalist sculptures and paintings that demonstrate her earliest investigations of the colour palette and rhythmic, conjoining geometric shapes.

A preschool teacher praised her as gifted and at the age of five, the future artist started riding a bus across town on her own to take lessons at the Chicago Art Institute.\n\nOne of the key forces behind the 1970s feminist art movement, the colorful and often controversial Chicago, a self-styled “troublemaker,” was thrust into the spotlight with her landmark 1979 installation The Dinner Party, a tribute to women’s contributions to history using vulval and butterfly imagery as its motif. Though lambasted by critics and marginalized for years by the male-dominated art establishment, Chicago persisted.

These days, such an initiative hardly seems revolutionary—many books have since been published about pioneers by historians like Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock, Mary Garrard, and more. But at the time, art history as it existed in the U.S. was almost exclusively focused on the achievement of white males based in Europe and New York. Chicago sought to change that.

As a white, cis, middle-class, Jewish-American woman coming of age in the mid-twentieth century, Chicago was not content to allow society to dictate the trajectory of her life. She learned from an early age that the only way forward was to craft her own identity and path – a lesson that served her throughout her trailblazing career.

If you ask an artist today the same question, chances are good they will say that their art is about gender and identity. Artistic permission to explore these subjects was a result of a wave of feminist artistic theory 50 years ago, and The Flowering, Judy Chicago’s memoir, is an intimate account of this period by one of its biggest names.

It’s hard to overstate the exhibition’s significance.

That statement has been a long time coming – Judy is now in her eighties. When one reads the narrative of her life, one sees how tough a struggle she has had to reach the situation of respect she now enjoys. As a late chapter in the new book makes generously clear, I played a small part in achieving this; however, she was already long famous thanks both to her exhibitions and to her autobiography Through the Flower, my book Judy Chicago: An American Artist was the first comprehensive book-length study devoted to her art. I met her on a visit to New Mexico in 1996. Then, as Judy relates: “En route back to the airport, he shocked me by asking what I thought about the idea of him writing what would be my first major monograph.” The book was not published until the year 2000, just over two decades ago.
