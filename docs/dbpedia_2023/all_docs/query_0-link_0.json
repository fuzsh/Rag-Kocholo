It has been a great honor to work with such a talented and loyal group of editors, designers, production managers and sales representatives at this distinguished magazine.\n\nI am also grateful for the hundreds of writers and artists who have collaborated with us over the years. Their generosity of spirit was genuinely inspiring, while the ongoing respect and support of our readers made my role rewarding each and every day."
