        "text": "In today’s Partner Spotlight, we talked with Swedish contemporary artist Marisol Evora about her artistic process and influences. Currently based in the south of Spain, her bold abstractions have been showcased in several international exhibitions and art fairs throughout the United States, Europe, and Japan. She combines multiple media and materials with colors, layers, scratches and marks to create pieces that reflect her joyful energy as an artist. She works with Lumaprints by making her art available for sale.\n\nWhat media do you use for your art style? Is there a specific reason why you chose this media?\n\nThanks for asking about my art style and the media that I use. When it comes to the media that I use for my artwork, I love to experiment with different techniques and materials to create something unique and visually interesting. Some of the media that I enjoy working with include acrylics, oil, pastel, chalk and diverse markers. I find that each medium has its own unique qualities and characteristics, which can help me to achieve different effects and textures in my artwork. For example, acrylics are great for creating bold and vibrant colors, while oil paints can produce a more luscious texture and depth. One of the reasons why I enjoy using mixed media is that it allows me to combine different materials and techniques in a way that creates something truly unique. I like to layer my artwork with different materials, textures, and colors to create a sense of depth and complexity. I’m like a mad scientist in my art studio, trying out all sorts of wacky ideas to see what works and what doesn’t. Sometimes, I use my fingers to smear paint around, because why not? My goal as an artist is to create artwork that is both visually interesting and emotionally engaging. I want my art to bring energy and colors to ordinary life, and to inspire others to see the world in new and exciting ways. Whether I’m working on canvas or paper, my artwork is usually colorful and textured, with multiple layers, scratches, and marks. I love to get lost in the process of creating art, and I hope that my artwork will bring joy and inspiration to those who view it.\n\nCan you describe your art and your art style?\n\nMy artwork is like a big, joyful hug in visual form. It reflects a broad range of styles, from abstract expressionism to modern figurative. I am a contemporary artist. When I paint, I like to explore the depths of my creativity and let my imagination run wild. I love to experiment with different techniques and materials, adding multiple layers, scratches, and marks to my artwork. My use of color is bold and unapologetic, celebrating the imperfections that make my artwork unique and balanced. For me, painting is a form of spirituality. It’s a way for me to connect with something greater than myself, to explore the mysteries of the universe and to find meaning in the chaos of everyday life. I believe that the imperfections in my artwork make it perfect, just like the imperfections in our lives make us who we are. My goal as an artist is to create artwork that’s interesting to look at and brings happiness to people’s lives. I want my artwork to be a source of joy and inspiration, to lift people’s spirits and remind them of the beauty and wonder of the world around us.\n\nWho or what is your inspiration in doing your art?\n\nIt’s a great question, and one that I’m always happy to answer. As someone who has an insatiable curiosity and love for other cultures, I find that my experiences living in various European countries really fuel my creative fire. And now that I’m based in sunny Andalusia, Spain, I feel like a kid in a candy store – the colors, the music, the sea, the people, everything is so vibrant and full of life! But when it comes to the actual style and technique of my art, I have a few artists who really light me up. For starters, there’s Frida Kahlo – her inner strength and brave attitude are so inspiring, and I love the way she incorporated her Mexican heritage into her work. And then there’s Jackson Pollock – his drip paintings are like nothing else I’ve ever seen, and I admire the way he was able to break the rules and forge a new path for himself in the art world. Of course, I’m also inspired by many other artists in the abstract expressionism style. Helene Frankenthaler’s use of color and gesture is absolutely mesmerizing, and Perle Fine’s use of texture and form is truly captivating. And then there’s Grace Hartigan – her one-of-a-kind color palette and brushstrokes make my heart sing, and I love how she used her work to question the traditional role of women. When I’m creating my own art, I try to channel all of these inspirations into something that is uniquely mine. It’s like a treasure hunt, always searching for something new and exciting to add to my work. And when I’m done, I hope that my art brings a little bit of joy and inspiration to someone else’s day. Because at the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about – sharing the beauty and magic of life with others.\n\nWhat drives you to create your art and share it to the world?\n\nI am so excited to answer your question about what drives me to create my art and share it with the world. First of all, I have to say that I absolutely love what I do. There’s something about the process of creating something beautiful that just fills me up inside. And when I see the joy that my art brings to others, it’s like a little burst of sunshine in my heart. But it’s not just about the act of creating. For me, it’s about connecting with people and cultures from all over the world. I’ve always been fascinated by the diversity of human experience, and my art allows me to explore that in a really unique way. Drawing inspiration from the places I’ve lived and visited, I strive to create art that captures the essence of different cultures and experiences. Whether it’s the vibrant colors of Andalusia or the tranquil beauty of a French countryside, I want my art to transport people to a different time and place. And when I share my art with the world, I’m really sharing a little piece of myself. It’s a way for me to connect with others and to share the beauty that I see in the world around me. It’s a way to spread a little bit of joy and positivity in a world that can sometimes feel overwhelming. So, what drives me to create my art and share it with the world? It’s a combination of my insatiable curiosity, my love for different cultures, and my desire to connect with others. And if my art can bring a little bit of happiness to someone’s day, then I know I’m doing something right.\n\nCan you share a favorite quote or saying that you live by?\n\nAbsolutely! “Color is a manifestation of the soul” is a quote that resonates deeply with me. As an artist, I believe that color is more than just a visual experience – it is an emotional and spiritual one. Color has the power to evoke feelings of joy, sadness, passion, and tranquility. It is a language all its own, and one that speaks directly to the soul. This quote by Wassily Kandinsky reminds me that art is not just about what we see, but what we feel. It inspires me to use color to express my innermost thoughts and emotions, and to create works of art that speak to the soul. When I am painting, I feel a deep connection to the colors I use, and I strive to create harmony and balance that resonates with the viewer. Ultimately, this quote reminds me that art is a reflection of the soul, and that the colors we choose to express ourselves are a manifestation of who we truly are.\n\nThis month, we’ll be commemorating Women’s History. Can you tell us about a female artist from history who has influenced your work?\n\nThe female artist who has influenced me the most – Helen Frankenthaler. Her paintings, her unique style and bold colors just take my breath away. But what I really admire about her is the way she fearlessly pushed boundaries and broke through the glass ceiling of the male-dominated art world. She was a true trailblazer who paved the way for so many female artists to follow in her footsteps. And let me tell you, it’s not always easy being a woman in the art world. But when I look at her work, I feel like I can take on the world and make my own mark. This Women’s History Month, I’m feeling extra grateful for all the amazing women who have come before me and made it possible for me to pursue my passion. So here’s to Helen and to all the amazing female artists out there making history every day! Let’s keep creating and pushing boundaries.\n\nCan you discuss a piece of art that you’ve created that is inspired by women’s history, and what message you hope to convey through it?\n\n“A New State of Mind” is a piece of art that holds a message that is very important to me, “Say It Right, Say It ALL.” Through this painting, I wanted to convey the importance of speaking up for what you believe in and expressing your true feelings without hesitation or fear. In the context of women’s history, this message is especially relevant, as so many incredible women have fought for their rights and the rights of others by speaking out and using their voices to make a difference. The layers of color and texture in the painting represent the complexity of expressing oneself, and the struggles we all face in finding the right words to convey our thoughts and feelings. But despite this complexity, the painting is still cohesive and visually compelling, showing that when we speak from the heart and say what we truly mean, the result can be truly beautiful. When people see this painting, I hope they are inspired to find the courage to speak up for themselves and others, and to use their voices to create positive change in the world. Together, we can all find a new state of mind and a new way of looking at things, and create a world where everyone’s voices are heard and valued.\n\nHow do you balance being a woman in the art world with other identities, such as race or sexuality?\n\nAs an artist and a mother of seven, I have definitely faced my fair share of challenges when it comes to balancing different identities. But for me, it’s all about embracing the diversity of my experiences and using them to create art that truly resonates with people. Being a woman in the art world can be tough, especially when you add in factors like race and sexuality. But I believe that every experience that I’ve had has made me a stronger and more empathetic artist. As a mother, I’ve learned so much about understanding and appreciating people’s differences, and that has definitely influenced my work in a powerful way. Ultimately, I believe that art has the power to transcend all of these different identities and bring people together in a way that nothing else can. That’s why I’m so passionate about what I do – I truly believe that my art can help to create a more diverse, inclusive, and accepting world for all of us.\n\nLastly, what advice would you give to young women who are aspiring to become artists?\n\nTo all the young women out there who are aspiring to become artists, my advice to you is to never give up on your dreams. You have a unique perspective and voice that deserves to be heard and seen. It’s not always easy to balance your passion for art with other responsibilities, whether it’s family, work, or other identities you hold. But know that your experiences and challenges can inform and inspire your art in powerful ways. Be bold and unapologetic in your creative expression, and don’t be afraid to take risks and try new things. Seek out opportunities to learn, grow, and connect with other artists and mentors who can support and guide you along the way. Remember that success as an artist doesn’t always come overnight. It takes time, dedication, and hard work. But with perseverance and a strong belief in yourself and your art, anything is possible. So keep creating, keep learning, and never let anyone dim the light of your creative spirit. The world needs your art, and I can’t wait to see all the amazing things you will create."
