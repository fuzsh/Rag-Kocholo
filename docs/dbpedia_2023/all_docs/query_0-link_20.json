Solo shows have ranged from New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, Japan and New Delhi, India. In India, she exhibited at Nature Morte Gallery and was U.S. representative artist at the Khoj International Workshop. Her work has been featured in group shows including “The Digital Body”, ZKM Center for Art & Media in Karlsruhe, Germany and “Excess in the Technomediacratic Society”, Musee Dole, France.\n\nShe has interpreted her paintings into the medium of glass tile mosaic. Recent large-scale mosaics have been created for the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Capital One Headquarters, McLean, VA and Neiman Marcus, Beverly Hills. Americans for the Arts cited “Electromagnetic Fall”, her permanent Public Art Project for Queens College, as one of the best public art projects for 2010.\n\nMost recently she created an installation of animations for the NYC MTA. Entitled “Infinite Orbits”, 15 animations run on 50 screens at the Fulton Center in Lower Manhattan.\n\nAwards include the Adolph & Esther Gottlieb Foundation (2012, 2005), the Pollock Krasner Foundation (2002) and the New York Foundation for the Arts (2009, 2002, 1989). Nominations include Anonymous Was a Woman and the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation.\n\nArticles and reviews of her work have appeared in such publications as Artforum, Art in America, Flash Art, Artbyte and The New Yorker. Her work is included in Art+Science Now, a visual survey of artists working at the frontiers of science and technology published by Thames & Hudson.\n\nHer work appears in public and private collections including the Stanford University Art Collection, the ZKM Center for Art & Media, the Zimmerli Art Museum, the Basil Alkazzi Foundation, the U.S. Art in Embassies Program and the Library of Congress.\n\nMs. Hodgkin holds a B.F.A. in Painting & Printmaking from Virginia Commonwealth University and lives in New York."
