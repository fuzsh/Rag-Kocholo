In uniform in the corner of galleries, guards are responsible for the difficult task of keeping priceless artworks safe from hoards of curious onlookers. In his celebrated 2023 memoir All the Beauty in the World, author Patrick Bringley shares insights about art and life from the perspective of a museum guard. The result is a text that makes readers reconsider the art workers who safeguard cultural treasures and provides a new appreciation for how to look closely at works of art.\n\nA former guard at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Bringley came to a profession in security after working in the events department at The New Yorker. The career change was triggered by the passing of his brother from cancer at a young age. In the ensuing years of guarding and looking closely at centuries of human creativity on view at The Met, Bringley found solace and learned about the power of beauty to uplift the human spirit. In his book he movingly explores what he learned and how it changed his life. There are lessons in his story for those who have experienced grief and who might in turn find meaning from encountering art in the aftermath.\n\nBringley’s descriptions of some of his favorite artworks from The Met are both precise and extravagant. He is able to weave stories about art and artists with experience and aesthetic impact in a book that becomes its own tour through the museum and through his decade of working at one of the world’s largest art institutions. In between the author’s entrancing ekphrases, evocative illustrations contributed by Maya McMahon bring artworks to life visually.\n\nSome of Bringley’s anecdotes include details one might expect. For instance, he shares that keeping watch over boisterous crowds during blockbuster shows is challenging work and that standing all day is hard on the body. Other details from his years of observing people and art are more nuanced and share poignant aspects of what it means to look at, and engage with, art. These episodes tend to come from human encounters with visitors, students, art enthusiasts, and co-workers, among others.\n\nMany of the writer’s insights go beyond the galleries of The Met and reveal the inner workings of the museum’s guard corps. Bringley shares personal stories about many of his co-workers, illustrating the rich and vibrant diversity of those with whom he worked at the museum. The book becomes something of an accidental portrait of New York in the process, depicting the city and the institution as the nexus of a beautifully interconnected world with many profound stories to share.\n\nAll the Beauty in the World is a pleasurable jaunt and one that encourages its readers to take their time on their next museum visit, whether it be at The Met or elsewhere. Certainly, Bringley had an advantage of being alone in galleries for hours on end as part of his job, but he also brings to the endeavor a keen sensitivity for looking at art and for incisive commentary on how it touched and uplifted his life. In doing so he inspires readers to look closer, see better, and experience more deeply.\n\nAll the Beauty in the World was published by Simon and Schuster and is available at popular book sellers as well as through the publisher. For readers in the Providence area interested in supporting local bookstores, Books on the Square is also a great venue for book purchases.

So, when I began to focus on realism, plants and insects were natural subjects for me. Later during my work selling fertilizer I saw many different farms and I was inspired to paint the few that were environmentally friendly.\n\nHow do you get started on these paintings? Are you working from nature, from photographs, or a combination thereof?\n\nI compose my scenes from a combination of drawings done in the field and photographs of individual plants and insects. Starting with a black canvas and then the sky, the ground, and then the farthest subjects. The insects are the final layer after all the larger subjects are arranged.\n\nDo you consider your paintings to fall into the genre of scientific illustrations, or are they more expressive than that?\n\nI do strive for accuracy in the anatomy of my paintings, but I wouldn’t say they are scientific illustrations. Sometimes I adjust color, scale and relative perspective as needed. I am more concerned with capturing the spirit of the plant than I am with capturing it’s exact physiology.\n\nWhy is the nocturnal element of the landscape important to you?\n\nWhen I began the Nocturnal Landscapes series, I was living in the middle of a giant, toxic, potato field. The field was sprayed heavily with pesticides, and it was done at night so fewer people were exposed to the clouds of chemicals. So, I began to imagine what the farm might look like at night if it were a healthy ecosystem instead.\n\nHow do these paintings interact with other elements of your practice as an artist, or do they?\n\nIn addition to working as a carpenter, I enjoy practicing a few different art forms and hobbies, including metal sculpture, writing, gardening, wine making etc. However, I’ve always focused on acrylic canvas painting with a special, crazy obsession. I allow it vastly more time and effort than any other medium. I think it is important to specialize if you want to really master something.\n\nWhat do you hope viewers experience when looking at this work?\n\nI want my audience to empathize with the natural world; to feel how complex it is, to feel how delicate it is, and to feel how inextricably connected we are to it.\n\nWhat is next for you in this series, and how do you expect to build on the ideas you're exploring?\n\nThere is infinite inspiration to be found in nature. I’m working on portraying flight, plants swaying in the breeze, atmosphere, and dew among other things. Nature is never static. I’m always looking for new ways to capture motion and growth.\n\nLearn more about Chris and his work at www.nocturnallandscapes.com and follow his studio on Instagram via @nocturnallandscapes.

The average artist will never see their work acquired by a museum, will not receive an institutional retrospective, and likely will struggle to find robust gallery representation. At the same time, the demands on retail gallery owners in smaller cities are constantly increasing. Rents, and the other myriad expenses associated with small business, are ever on the rise, while the pool of individuals interested in buying art remains relatively static. Looking towards the future for artists with regional scopes, one bright spot might be artist-run cooperatives that bring together makers around the idea of shared benefits.\n\nMany communities around the country are home to long standing cooperative galleries. In the northeast, a number of these organizations count their longevity by the decade. The ways in which artists’ cooperative galleries operate can vary wildly, but the core tenants usually fall somewhere along the lines of a group of artists joining together to pay rent on a storefront where they all can show their work. Often, each participating artist is granted a section of the space where they can continually share a rotating body of artworks. Sometimes, the exhibition opportunities cycle between active members. Typically, each member of a cooperative is expected or obligated to donate several hours a month to monitor the gallery and greet guests, while in return the gallery takes a smaller than usual commission when works sell. There are some trade offs involved.\n\nWhereas a traditional commercial gallery is (at least ideally) managed by a fine art professional who has both curatorial acumen as well as sales and networking ability, a cooperative might be run collectively by dozens of artists, each with their own goals and objectives. While gallerists will take a 50% commission on average though, the typical commission in a cooperative is something like 25%. Artists in a cooperative gallery can expect to also pay membership dues that can range from a few hundred dollars a year to hundreds of dollars a month, with some cooperatives instituting sliding scales or varying membership tiers to make dues more equitable and accessible.\n\nThe demands on small galleries, whether cooperative or owner-run, are huge. Each month a gallery needs to sell enough art to pay rent, utilities, insurance, marketing fees, and other incidentals like paint, labels, collateral materials, and reception expenses. For a retail gallery, the added expense of staff salaries and health insurance can prove insurmountable. In a cooperative, the necessity for profit is spread broadly across the artists involved and there is often no gallery manager to pay. While the panache and expertise of a career gallerist can provide a high level of value to artists represented by them, the freedom and flexibility of a cooperative has a value of its own, particularly for artists who feel overlooked by the gallery system.\n\nArtists are constantly seeking new venues to show and sell their work. The pressures on small owner-run galleries are fierce and the need for gallerists to show works that are highly salable is very real. So for many artists, the alternative of being in community with fellow makers while having a more equitable stake in a gallery operation might be an appealing alternative to the grind of seeking gallery representation and answering to the whims of the marketplace. As the field for regional galleries continues to change, cooperative galleries have enormous potential to create dynamic spaces for artists of all backgrounds to exhibit their work within and beyond their communities.\n\nModernity has not ebbed the love for small art. The extraordinary story of collectors Herb and Dorothy Vogel is evidence of this. Throughout the mid and late twentieth century the Vogels became important collectors of some of the most significant artists of their time. Although both had blue collar jobs, they were able to amass an important collection by focusing on small works by big names including the likes of Lynda Benglis, Lois Dodd, Sol Lewitt, Robert Mangold, and Elizabeth Murray. Their sizable holdings eventually took over their modest apartment in New York and they became the subject of a PBS documentary. Much of their remarkable collection was then distributed to museums in all fifty states, making for an enormous impact in small doses.\n\nWhether it be a devotional ivory, a tiny portrait, a nineteenth century painting, or a work of breathtaking modernism, smaller works of art have always appealed to collectors. Today, in an age of the big, the bold, and the expensive, small works exhibitions provide an outlet for artists to create work they are passionate about in a format that is often more accessible to collectors in terms of both the wall space and money required to add such a work to their holdings.\n\nAs the season of small works sales gets underway, individuals hoping to support artists in their communities might consider the proud history of collecting modest works as inspiration to buy wonderful little artworks for their own collections.\n\nI have spent the majority of my professional life in gallery work. Managing gallery spaces, organizing exhibitions, and guiding artists through the process of sharing their work are core elements of what I do. So, when the opportunity arose to take on a space to mount my own personal curatorial projects outside the context of my day job, I jumped at the chance. Through this new venture, I hope to expand my own practice as an independent curator and advisor and give emerging artists novel opportunities to share their work while testing and improving gallery practices.\n\nMy new Project Space is located at 1 Meeting Street in Providence on the second floor. This is just around the corner from RISD and Brown, and is less than a five minute walk to the Providence Amtrak Station. Domestic in scale, this space lends itself to small and medium sized artworks that could easily find their way into home environments. I plan to host my first exhibition, a group show titled Housewarming, in the coming month or so.\n\nWhen considering how I would like to utilize this exhibition venue, my first thought is to make it a laboratory. We often get bogged down in the status quo of gallery practices, so trying out new ideas and seeing where they lead sounds like an opportunity to learn and grow. Agility is an important quality and one that seems easier to grasp in a project-based format.\n\nI am interested in pursuing a variety of curatorial goals with this space but at this early stage I think two are most worth noting. The first is that I plan to use this physical venue to continue and expand upon my series of online juried shows begun during the pandemic. These virtual exhibitions allowed me to connect with artists throughout the United States and beyond, and by adding a physical component to the digital I can continue to offer artists opportunities to exhibit in themed group exhibitions with improved depth and reach.\n\nSecond, but no less important, I plan to center much of my work in this space around emerging artists. That term can mean a lot of things but to me it primarily means artists in the early part of their career. Mentorship is important and I have benefited greatly from the support of numerous colleagues. I would like to use this space to cultivate new generations of artists and to continue to build on my network to form connections between artists and those who are interested in art.\n\nAlongside featuring new artists, engaging with new collectors is an equally critical task. Creating a welcoming and accessible environment for individuals new to support artists is something I will strive to do in this venue as well.\n\nAs with my online exhibitions, there will be some restrictions in the way I use my Project Space. To avoid conflicts of interest, I will not be featuring the work of current members of the Providence Art Club, where I’ve served as gallery manager since 2014. I also do not anticipate maintaining a stable of artists or acting as a representative for individual creatives, but rather will focus on curated group exhibitions with occasional smaller format or solo shows thrown into the mix.\n\nI hope this brings some clarity at the outset of this exciting initiative. I am looking forward to what I can create in this space. Thanks are due to the many individuals who have supported and encouraged my varied projects thus far and I hope to have your support in this special endeavor too. As things develop, I will share news here on my blog as well as on my social media channels.\n\nFor questions about my Project Space, please feel free to email me at michael@michaelrosefineart.com.\n\nTo share your interest in participating in future group shows in the Project Space, please fill out my quick and simple Google form.\n\nDeDee Shattuck Gallery, which is playing host to the SCA Spring Invitational, is one of the region’s premiere exhibition venues. Housed in a spare and barn-like building within a pastoral setting, the gallery is a place where any artist would be delighted to see their work. The main exhibition space is soaring and light, and windows and the four corners of the structure look out onto the bucolic landscape of Westport. The quality of the gallery elevates this exhibition of artists connected with and dedicated to their locale.\n\nIn a show packed with local inflection, perhaps those most celebratory of the South Coast are submissions by Josie Richmond. Employing intaglio printmaking combined with velvety encaustic, Richmond layers imagery of nearby flora and fauna on maps detailing the intricate contours of the many coves and inlets that define the South Coast. Inventive and enjoyable, they are full of community pride.\n\nThe South Coast Artists Spring Invitational Exhibition is a celebration of local art made in and around a series of charming towns nestled by the sea. The show at DeDee Shattuck Gallery invites visitors to travel to Westport to experience a fine array of artworks as well as the environment that inspired their authors. With its walls piled high with art of the region, the exhibition is an ideal opportunity to discover art made on the South Coast.\n\nThe South Coast Artists Spring Invitational Exhibition is on view at DeDee Shattuck Gallery at 1 Partners Lane in Westport, Massachusetts, through May 29, 2022. Gallery hours are are Wednesday - Saturday from 10am - 5pm each day and Sunday from 12 - 5pm.

A sought-after art professional, Michael has a strong audience in the Northeast, as well as throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nLooking back at American art in the twentieth century, some of the most valuable visual resources are those produced by printmakers. From the urban explorations of John Sloan or Edward Hopper to the more nuanced and human-focused prints of artists like Elizabeth Catlett or Sister Corita Kent, printmaking experienced something of a long golden age. Mabel Dwight is a seminal figure of the American printmaking scene, and an artist whose works are full of trenchant observations of American life. In looking at just four examples of her work, one can find insights into Dwight’s perceptive views of her time and place through the eyes of an artist.\n\nIn a 1936 lithograph, titled Ninth Avenue Church, Dwight’s wry sense of humor is on display. A white church stands in the middle of the frame, with the rising city behind and a park in the foreground. What might be a bucolic scene of a New England town common is disrupted by an elevated rail line that brings a train car rattling across the center of the image, obliterating the view of the church’s charming steeple. One imagines what the scene looked like before progress brought train tracks. The image has an auditory quality too. The church bells chiming, the murmurous chatter of park goers, and the clatter that fills any urban space. Other works throughout Dwight’s production lean heavier into the funny. Quotidien images of nuns in libraries or fish in aquariums or audiences in movie theatres are transformed into delightful narrative forays.\n\nNineteenth century France was a time and place full of excitement around new modes of art making. Of the avant garde schools that took shape in this moment, the Impressionists are the best known and most widely revered. Defined by Monet’s sensuous treatment of subjects ranging from cathedrals to haystacks, the appeal of the Impressionists is hard to escape. Other contemporary movements, such as the Pointillists, sought to broker new ways of seeing as well, and with dazzling effects. Georges Seurat’s Circus Sideshow is a signature product of the thrilling nineteenth century and shows off the spectacle inherent in the Pointillist mode.\n\nThe Pointillists, led in large part by Seurat, aimed to dissolve the picture plane into innumerable inflections of paint. The eyes of viewers would reassemble these dots, completing the intended image in the heads of onlookers. Based on a novel and sophisticated understanding of optics, the works produced by the Pointillists have a scintillating quality that is unlike the works produced by their earlier counterparts. While Monet’s paintings might make one marvel at light or atmosphere, Seurat’s hinge on something more complex. They make the viewer consider how a picture is constructed, diffused, received, and absorbed.\n\nSeurat’s Circus Sideshow, now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum, leverages the stylistic flourishes of Pointillism to underscore the showmanship of its subject. Musicians are seen playing under gaslight and over the heads of a crowd eagerly hoping to gain admittance to a circus proper. The hum of the gathered group seems implicit in the daubs of paint spread across the surface of Seurat’s canvas. It is a painting about the buzz of a public event, and that exciting atmosphere is perfectly attuned to Seurat’s technique. Each dot of paint can be read as a warbling note of sound, or as the glint of twilight, or as a dash of the vibration of the rowdy mob.\n\nThe image was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in 1888. In displaying this vivid nocturne, Seurat was playing a bit of a game with his audience. Like a circus, French salons of all types were about showmanship. Paintings were designed to stop the crowd, to draw them in, to rile them up. Seurat’s image is no different. Its stylistic treatment, novel when it was painted, is still surprising and exciting today. Looking at the painting, one gains a sense of atmospheric dramatism that surpasses many comparable works of the Impressionists. Seurat’s Pointillists sought to build upon the groundbreaking works of the likes of Monet, whose famed Impression Sunrise was completed sixteen years prior to Seurat’s engaging Sideshow.\n\nThe event at the heart of Seurat’s grand painting was a proceeding designed to entice passersby to become customers. Through showmanship, this tertiary scene was supposed to turn viewers into ticket-buyers and bring them under the big tent. It was about allure. In this way, the sideshow and Pointillism overlap. They are both full of eye-catching spectacle.\n\nPointillism was designed to catch, and hold, and entrance the eye. The effect remains and even today Pointillist works bring the viewer back again and again.\n\nSeurat’s interest in circus imagery was deep and the motif appears a number of times throughout his oeuvre. The Met’s Circus Sideshow is one of his largest and most stunning artworks and one that easily defines the movement. It, like the evening it depicts, is a grandiose and exciting extravaganza.\n\nBy looking at Circus Sideshow, viewers become both onlookers of art and participants in a public spectacle. They might be dazzled by Seurat’s composition, or by his palette, or by the Pointillist technique. They also become the crowd, like the one the artist captured, waiting in line for a chance to get a closer look at the show.\n\nCall for Art\n\nForm and Shape: The Figure in Contemporary Art\n\nAn International Virtual Exhibition\n\nThe figure has provided inspiration for artists for centuries.

The show, titled 8 Visions, features photographic collages by Monica DeSalvo, drawings by Craig Elliott, ceramics by Lindsey Epstein, textile-based work by Virginia Mahoney, paintings by Kat Masella and Alexander Morris, photographs by Lisa Redburn and jewelry by Chuck Tramontana. The process for selecting these eight artists began with sixty applications, first juried down to twenty finalists by Jennifer Jean Okumura, with exhibitors selected by Anne Corso and Lauren Riviello. The result is an impressive group that speaks to the richness of style and technique that can be found in the New England art community.\n\nThe show is wonderfully varied and viewers will find captivating details around every corner of the museum’s generous gallery located in the heart of downtown Attleboro. Across a spectrum of media, the exhibition brings out the individuality of the featured artists. The connecting thread is often a distinct interest in texture and surface, be it real or illusion. Particular standouts in the exhibition include the highly tactile drawings and paintings of Craig Elliott and Alexander Morris, the poignant mixed media works of Monica DeSalvo, and quiet photographic triptychs executed by Lisa Redburn.\n\nCraig Elliott, an artist who trained as an architect, exhibits a series of charcoal drawings undergirded with thoughtful design. Included in the exhibition, one finds a collection of diminutive preparatory sketches for Totemic, one of Elliott’s large scale drawings. This gives a deep sense of the artist’s knack for craftsmanship and informs a better appreciation for the completed works on view. The little drawings, though preliminary, are actually quite exquisite and hold their own against the more “finished” works on offer.\n\nAlbert Pinkham Ryder (1847 - 1917), may not be a household name but his contributions to American art are significant. An exhibition on view through October in the artist’s birthplace of New Bedford, Massachusetts, explores his art in its own right as well as within the context of modernist movements that came in his wake. Mounted by the New Bedford Whaling Museum, the show is a rare and wonderful opportunity to see many of Ryder’s paintings in one place. A Wild Note of Longing: Albert Pinkham Ryder and a Century of American Art is a must-see exhibition which will reshape perceptions of American art history.\n\nOne of the most exciting elements of the show is that it gathers together many of the artist’s paintings in one exhibition. This is the first significant display of Ryder’s work since a 1990 retrospective at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art. Some of the paintings on view are indeed on loan from the same institution and give viewers the opportunity to explore works that they might otherwise have to travel to Washington, D.C. to experience. Other artworks come from major institutions like the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Phillips Collection, making this a mini-blockbuster exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition does not feature Ryder alone, though. The show pairs a wonderful range of the title artist’s paintings with works by later makers who similarly broke boundaries and reconsidered the potential of expression. Works by artists such as Jackson Pollock, Marsden Hartley, Wolf Kahn, and Richard Pousette-Dart form a fascinating pendant to the excellent selection of paintings on view by Ryder.\n\nWhile Ryder was born in New Bedford, he spent a good portion of his adult life in New York before returning to his hometown at the time of his death. He was an unusual and often lone individual who cuts something of a melancholic figure. While his painterly contributions may not be fully appreciated by a broad audience, this exhibition is an important step in bringing viewers a more complete picture of American art. Ryder’s paintings are beautiful and mournful and provoke emotional reactions as well as appreciation for his remarkable handling of paint. He is, in short, one of the great American artists of any generation and this exhibition is a fantastic chance to learn more about him and his incredible impact.\n\nA Wild Note of Longing: Albert Pinkham Ryder and a Century of American Art is on view at the New Bedford Whaling Museum through October 31, 2021.
