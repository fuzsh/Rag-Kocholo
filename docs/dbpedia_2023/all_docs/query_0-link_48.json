        "text": "Mosaic 54.1 is a general issue, but in each of the essays published here, vision takes a hit. This, of course, is nothing new for critical work, little less than the main lines of twentieth-century art and poetry, yet this convergence on the problem of visibility in an un-curated issue featuring the writing of scholars from a range of disciplines and working from vastly different theoretical perspectives is both surprising and surely exacerbated by the increasingly troubled times in which we live. Today more than ever colonialism, the inequalities of race and gender, climate change, capitalism have risen up at the horizon of things to become an increasingly urgent and overlapping set of discourses that buttress and support the very possibility of the visible. For the art historian in me, these pressures placed on the visual are acutely felt. Painting as a long time object of study and the paradigmatic form of visual art withers. With its fabled autonomy nearly bled dry, horrors that were once fenced off correspond more and more closely with the inside. For photography in the age of Instagram this is magnified tenfold, for the cruel logic of the world drives our fascination with it more and more literally from the side in the name of psychographics, consumption, spectacle. By extension, and given that this symptomatology is pervasive (with contradictions piling on top of contradictions daily), we must all ask ourselves how to continue doing the work we do even as our chosen fields of study look [End Page v] increasingly unsustainable, exhausted, ripe for total overhaul. The practice of close reading that is a cornerstone of the scholarship we publish at Mosaic is especially fragile under these circumstances. Though its approach to the text is variable, and always keyed to the object, its unique version of seeing through a hyper magnified lens and a special proximity hinging on attachment tends towards peripheral blindness.\n\nThe issues are not new. These are longstanding problems. In \"The 'Flesh's Vision': Dylan Thomas's Poetics of Sensation,\" Sophie Laniel-Musitelli guides us through the poet's consistent evasions of the despotism of sight towards what she describes as a deeply embodied notion of \"poetic process\" and a \"poetic sensorium.\" In Lindsey Richter's \"Reimagining Vision in the Surrealist Cinepoem L'Etoile de mer,\" the author unpacks a sensory epistemology hinging on the primacy of the haptic over the spectacular seductions of vision. In \"The Mother as Social Activist in Muriel Rukeyser's 'The Book of the Dead' and Maxo Vanka's Murals,\" Aaron Rovan works against the dominant visual framework of the New Deal to uncover the unforeseen role for women in combatting capitalist exploitation. In a complex and probing essay titled \"The Sense of the Visible: Relational Poetics in Harmonium,\" Ian Tan sheds a phenomenological light on a \"much enlarged\" notion of vision bound by projection and imaginative relation.\n\nIn the essay \"Cannibalism in Joyce and Mo Yan: Famine Memory in Ulysses, The Republic of Wine , and Frog,\" Hye Ryoung Kil reads the works of Joyce and Mo Yan off of one another and the respective histories of famine in Ireland and China to bring into focus trauma of a very literal kind. James Martell's \"Malabouian Plasticity Beyond Surfaces\" interrogates Catherine Malabou's interest in plasticity as a neurological process existing beyond surface capture. The world as text is re-anchored to a notion of the sculptural that exists without support. In \"The Trouble: Family, Genre, and Hybridity in Octavia Butler's Kindred,\" Kimber L. Wiggs introduces us to the complexities of interpreting the writing of Octavia Butler in and as the problem of hybridity. Finally, in \"Animal, Subject, Constitution,\" Jacques de Ville carefully outlines the contradictions and compensatory logic implicit to the establishment of human sovereignty above the non-human. Just how laced through with Kantian anthropology our own most basic assumptions about the animal, the subject, and civil society are is shocking.\n\nIt is in this general spirit of antagonism towards the visual in the field of the visual—an aestheteic problem if there ever was one and what Jacques Rancière has called \"the distribution of the..."
