        "text": "I first met Taliesin Thomas at one of my side projects, ARTS BAR, a pop up cocktail bar at the Arts Center in Troy. She was rolling with Ali Herrmann, a Troy based mixed media artist that night. TT is larger than life and unforgettable. Since that fateful meet we have spent many late nights discussing esoteric philosophies of arts and culture, and the value proposition of Upstate NY. You may recognize her as an occasional guest writer here at ACE! When she recently scored a gig with Hyperallergic to cover the Hudson Valley art scene, I knew it was time to give her a formal introduction.\n\nPlease state your name, title, what you do for a living in the creative world.\n\nMy name is Taliesin Thomas and my current professional roles are both local-focused and global-centric. Since 2007, I am the Founding Director of AW Asia and the Collections Manager for Art Issue Editions—two private art collections based in New York. The AW Asia collection is comprised of contemporary Chinese art and photography, including rare artworks by many of China’s leading figures such as Ai Weiwei, Zhang Xiaogang, and Zeng Fanzhi (among others). The Art Issue Editions collection is composed of primarily Western contemporary artists, including Keith Haring, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, KAWS, and Daniel Arsham among other celebrated figures. We work behind the scenes to loan the artworks in these collections to major museums worldwide in addition to doing special curatorial projects, collaborations, and publications with Princeton University Press and other prominent publishers. One of our most important recent projects, for example, is a partnership with the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC to present a comprehensive retrospective of contemporary Chinese photography that is also a promised gift. Since moving upstate, I have become immersed in the dynamic creative scene in the region, and I now oversee Artist Initiatives at The Arts Center of the Capital Region in Troy in addition to teaching and regular arts writing.\n\nHow did you end up moving into this career? Were you always interested in art?\n\nI have been involved in the pursuit of art since the earliest time of my life. During my nearly 30-year career I have worked in various professional capacities including the artist studio, museum, commercial gallery, artist residency, and art foundation setting. I studied advanced art in high school and that inspired me to do my undergraduate degree in fine arts at Bennington College. Over time, my practice and inclinations shifted, and I became more interested in the theoretical and philosophical dimensions of art. The vast literature on aesthetics is a great source of stimulation, and I call myself an artist-maker turned artist-philosopher. This path propelled me to do my graduate work at Columbia University which led to a Ph.D. in Art Theory and Philosophy with the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts.\n\nWhat’s a typical day look like for you work wise?\n\nI often refer to my work life as a ‘grab-bag’ experience—every day brings something exciting across my desk! On any given day I interface with a range of colleagues in various sectors of the international art industry, including ongoing dialogues with artists, curators, museums, galleries, organizations, auction houses, art storage facilities, and shipping companies as well as special areas of research and writing as it relates to our projects. From my desk in Troy, I oversee the movement of artworks from our collection to get them around the globe to be enjoyed by others while simultaneously engaging with the local and regional arts scene in the most meaningful ways—I feel constant gratitude for this professional connectivity.\n\nWhat caused you to decide to move to the Capital Region, it seems like you were in a pretty amazing scene down in the city…\n\nI appreciate this question—the existential intensity of the pandemic revealed an irreversible perspective on the ‘quality of life’ concept, and that propelled me out of the urban hustle. I lived in Brooklyn for 19 years and built up my professional standing before relocating to the Hudson Valley. Working for a passionate globe-trotting art collector is a unique position, and that is how I was able to bring our independent office to Troy. I embrace the whole of New York—the city, Upstate, and the entire Empire region—as a magnificently inter-connected arts eco-system. I big-red-heart New York!\n\nYou mentioned that you started working more locally as well, specifically that Arts Center of the Capital Region. Can you tell us more about your program there?\n\nThe Arts Center in Troy is home to a robust arts program of year-round classes and exhibitions. As the Director of Artist Initiatives, I oversee two distinct programs: Artist Training and Critical Forum. The Artist Training program hosts the ‘Secret Sauce‘ series and we are organizing another terrific line-up of speakers for this coming fall. The ‘Critical Forum‘ program is an intensive professional development opportunity for emerging and mid-career artists. A maximum of twelve participants are chosen for this program through an open-call application process. The application cycle for this year’s Critical Forum cohort will be open from March 1 to April 1—heads-up artists: Apply! The cohort meets monthly over a six-month period at The Arts Center for group critiques that also include invited arts professionals from the region.\n\nFinally, you recently picked up a great gig, tell us about Hyperallergic! Also, any other things up your sleeve we should know about?\n\nSince moving to the Hudson Valley, I have been a regular arts reviewer for Chronogram. This has allowed me to network with many incredible colleagues and organizations and is my continued aim to promote artists and exhibitions in our region. My interview with artist Jeffrey Gibson (based in Hudson) for Chronogram was very meaningful as a few months ago it was announced that he will represent the United States at the 60th Venice Biennale this year. I was recently approached by Hyperallergic to establish a Hudson Valley arts preview column, and that has been an outstanding fit thus far! It is a continued joy to align the flourishing creative scene in upstate New York and to be an active contributor in the Troy arts community and beyond.\n\nI first heard of Bryan Hamill at a meeting with Michelle Toch Dinsmore at Overit Media. We were planning the kick off of the rebranded First Friday in Albany last year. Part of the initial rollout was a FF show at her space including Abe Farraro and this “cool guy super connected guy doing amazing print stuff in the skateboard scene…” I came to find out, Bryan is all that and so much more, bringing a passion for craft and creative community to the Arbor Hill neighborhood in Albany. After a successful grand opening last year, he was notified that the space he occupied was no longer going to be available. So what is now to come of this community driven arts / maker space and its specialized equipment? We have an idea…\n\nPlease state your name, what you do and your educational / experiential background.\n\nMy name is Bryan Hamill. I am currently an Accounting Administrator at Audio Video Corporation in Albany New York and Founder and Shop Manager at Circus (Power Through Paper), a community based printing and events space in Albany’s Arbor Hill Neighborhood.\n\nI grew up down by New York City but moved up here to go to college and absolutely fell in love with the city. I studied music and video production at St. Rose College in Albany and did odd jobs in both upon graduation; recording various albums for local musicians such as Steve Gaylord, commercials for small businesses, weddings, and music videos for bands such as Rockets and Blue Lights. I used to play in a band that was pretty popular in Albany called The Amazing Plaid among others. I’ve played shows around the country traveling in a beat up old prison bus, and even played a week’s worth of shows in Germany. I started and helped run a non-profit arts organization in Albany called the Capital District Federation of Ideas, where we had a performance space on Madison Ave called Point Five. I convinced myself that I needed to secure a grown up job, so I’ve been working full time at local company Audio-Video Corporation since 2011.\n\nAfter work, needing to keep doing something creative, I fell back on something that was a full-blown necessity when playing in a DIY band – screen printing – learning everything I could from books and online videos. I started releasing prints under the banner of Pepper Spray Press, where I’ve been fortunate to work with legends such as Daniel Johnston, Dave Navarro, Laura Albert (the author behind JT LeRoy), Al Diaz (former artistic partner to Jean Michael Basquiat), and many others. The more I fell in love with printmaking, the more I wanted to share the amazing skill with others. The idea of a community print shop and art space formed.\n\nIt sounds like you were on a strong path to full time freelance, self directed work and then…you ended up getting a full time gig. Can you talk about the decision to go that direction?\n\nAfter graduating from St. Rose, I had what I thought at the time was the perfect job: I was the Assistant Manager for a local bookstore for many years. It allowed me to have a steady income while also taking off any time I needed for shows or tours. After work, I would record bands in my home studio, or work on various video projects. It was also at this time that the non-profit formed Capital District Federation of Ideas that had a performance space on Madison Ave called Point Five. Unfortunately, the people running it, myself included, really didn’t know what we were doing. We were young and passionate, but that’s about all we had going. After about two years worth of amazing events and programming, we decided to close shop. We had ended up spending so much time and energy on keeping the lights on that it felt like we weren’t making any progress towards our stated mission. After it ended, I was so burnt out and disillusioned that I decided I needed to try something more stable, which is when I entered corporate America.\n\nYour passionate about your current side project. Printing, music and deep community integration. Can you tell use more about what drives you in this area and what you have been up to? I believe you are currently in the old Stage 1 space of the Albany Barn…\n\nWhenever I’m passionate about something, I want to share it with the world, and teaching someone how to print is about the most satisfying thing I’ve ever done. I’ve also always been acutely aware of access and privilege and how it shapes opportunity. If I wasn’t fortunate enough to go to college and get a stable job, I would never have been able to afford the equipment to print, and a house to print in. Printmaking is such an amazing tool, both for artistic expression AND commercial possibilities, and I want to give more people access because as it stands now, if you don’t go to college for printmaking or don’t have the resources to do it yourself, you’ll likely never have the opportunity.\n\nA couple of years ago, when this idea first began marinating in my head, I began purchasing the needed equipment. During that time, I was contacted by the family of local artist Steve Hazzard. He was a lifelong print maker, but he learned his trade back when dangerous chemicals were necessary to print, and those chemicals had made him sick to the point where he could no longer print. “Would you have any use for his old press?” he asked. The press was gorgeous and expensive, and if I could move it, it could be mine. I was so blown away by his generosity, and I had to share their gift with others. This was the big spark that set me off on this journey.\n\nWhat is your long term vision for this project and why do you think its important?\n\nI envision this space as something for everyone. A place for young students to dip their toes into printmaking BEFORE having to decide if it’s something they want to study in college. A place where studied print makers can apply their craft. (surprisingly, or maybe unsurprisingly, many who go to college for printmaking can’t afford the equipment or space to print). It’s a place where kids from a tough neighborhood can come in and print their own shirts, start their own fashion labels. It’s a place where film photography is still preferred over jpegs. It’s a place where hip-hop open mics and poetry readings can coexist. It’s a place for after-school programs. It’s a place where someone can learn to print without worrying about the judgement of others. It’s a place where I can print pizza boxes for local ghost kitchens to give them a leg up on their competition. I really envision the space as THE hub for local DIY-ers.\n\nRecently, you were notified that you would need to find a new space for the print facilities. Can you share with us what you current situation is and what it is that you are ideally looking for as you transition out of this space and neighborhood?\n\nOriginally, the Albany Barn heard about my idea and wanted to help. They provided me with their old gallery space in Arbor Hill, formerly called Stage One. In exchange, I would pay the utilities and teach printmaking at their Schenectady location a couple of times a month. I really felt like it was the perfect space. Perfect size, perfect neighborhood for what I want to accomplish. Unfortunately, the Barn doesn’t own the space – the Albany Housing Authority does, and about a month after we had our grand opening, we were told that the AHA wanted the space back. I am not quite sure of the details or what happened. So…we are without a space. All of the equipment is still there, but I’m unable to use it, and they want it moved out by end of month (Thursday, 02.29).\n\nI’ve spent the past couple of months meeting with community leaders, artists, and local businesses, trying to figure out our next step. Everyone I’ve spoken to has been sympathetic, and some have even offered space, but for one reason or another, they wouldn’t work. A couple of examples – the Albany Community Investment Trust really liked our proposal, and their space in the south end (The Coliseum) is both promising and ideal, but they’re about to start new construction that would put us out at least a year. The Social Justice Center in Albany seems like a good match on paper, and they would be more than happy to have us occupy their second floor, but because of ADA restrictions, our ability to hold public events would be very limited. So as it stands now, we are still in need of a space.\n\nEDITORS CHALLENGE: Have any location ideas or collaboration opportunities for Bryan? This feels like a great fit as a satellite location for an existing mission oriented / Not for Profit looking to expand it’s footprint outside city center. Hit him at the Circus website.\n\nPoet, artist, performer, curator and activist D. Colin wears many hats. Over the last year she has donned a newer one to add to her collection as Curator and Program Director at the Fish Market Project in North Central Troy, a satellite of the Arts Center of the Capital Region. As she wraps up the 2023 season, we thought it would be informative to get an inside track of what it’s like moving the boundaries of art and creativity outside of the city center and spreading it to areas that otherwise would not have that hyper local opportunity to participate.\n\nPlease state your name and role in the organization. How long have you been in this role?\n\nMy name is D. Colin and I am the Curator and Program Director for The Fish Market Project. Although my time at The Fish Market started in January 2022 as an artist in residence, I’ve been in this current role since March of 2023.\n\nCan you tell us more about what the FISHMARKET is and what type of programming you are running there? How long has it been in existence?\n\nThe Fish Market is literally a former fish market turned into a community arts engagement project by the Arts Center of the Capital Region. In 2021, ACCR offered two six-month artist residencies to launch the space. The second year an NEA (National Endowment for the Arts) grant made it possible for Meg Jala and myself, to offer a variety of arts programming in the space with Jade Warrick joining the team. Though they both moved on to pursue other opportunities, I’ve worked to continue the vision of community-centered arts programming. The Fish Market is a neighborhood arts hub for creatives and community members to gather, connect, and make art. Over the past year, there have been art exhibits, poetry open mics, and free workshops for a variety of art forms including acting, dance, drumming, and drawing. Every week, artists and community members have the opportunity to use the space to explore their own creative work during open hours which I like to call co-create time. I have also been able to have collaborative arts programming and special events in the space with a variety of partners including the Social Justice Artists Collective and Black Dimensions in Art, Inc. Now that The Fish Market is entering its third year and we have a better idea of what works most meaningfully there. I am excited to see how the community continues to grow.\n\nAs a satellite location for the Arts Center of the Capital Region, you have strong backing and institutional support. That said, this is a newer endeavor that will be carving out its own path in the neighborhood. What is the overall goal of the programming and what do you envision it becoming to the neighborhood?\n\nThe overall goal of programming is to provide a safe space for artists and community members to gather, to foster relationships between artists and the community, and to create together. I believe that it’s important for the arts to be accessible. A space like The Fish Market gives folks an opportunity to learn more about the arts and their own creative process while also impacting the neighborhood in a positive way. Personally, I see The Fish Market as a gathering space with the arts at its core, someplace where people can heal and grow together with creativity leading the way. When I was a young artist, I didn’t have spaces like this to help in demystifying the process of being an artist or even just in learning a variety of ways to express myself. I had to look for those outlets in other ways. My hope for The Fish Market is that it continues to be that space for others, especially those who live in North Central Troy.\n\nAs you try different events and initiatives, what are some best practice principles or suggestions you could share with other folks looking to replicate this model?\n\nI’m often asking for feedback. Some of the ideas for workshops and events have come from folks who’ve walked in during open hours or who’ve attended other events. Keeping ideas community-centered whether through direct conversations or having a suggestion box helps not only with ideas but also with relationships. At the same time, I try to weave in programming that nobody suggested or thought about by asking what might be missing and how can I connect with the community. If people don’t know what to ask for, sometimes it’s useful to introduce experiences to see how it goes. Consistency is also a driving force in helping programming grow. When folks have an expectation of how an event will go and when programming will happen, it’s easier to promote and likely attendance will steadily grow. I think with any new project, it also takes time. The Fish Market is two years old, but I think that amount of time is necessary to get a more solid understanding of what makes the most sense in the space.\n\nAny programming or events you have coming up that you would like to share?\n\nWe just had our Fish Market Festival, a 3-day end of season celebration. The Hudson Valley Writers Guild will be at The Fish Market in November. There will be an opening reception for their art exhibit on Friday, November 3rd starting at 5 pm. There will also be collage workshops, a poetry reading, and open gallery hours for folks to attend and see the art. I encourage folks to follow @fishmarketproject on Instagram or Facebook for schedule details. People can also stay updated by getting on the Arts Center of the Capital Region’s email list.\n\nThe first memory I have of meeting Leigh Wen was at an Albany Center Gallery gala held in the amazing Union Station building in downtown Albany. She had a live auction piece that went for I believe a couple thousand dollars. (I picked up an Averill Greene painting that same night and regretfully, missed out on a Nadia Trinkala painting…) Over the years I have had brief moments with her, once in her studio in Albany and a few years later I believe in Beacon, NY for a Friendsgiving event. Now a sought after international artist who’s work and commissions can surpass $100K, she once again is participating in the area with a fundraising collaboration with Tony Iadicicco‘s team at the Albany Center Gallery. A very busy woman, she was kind enough to share some insight into her work and process.\n\nPlease state your name, occupation and background.\n\nLeigh Wen, Artist, I was born in Taipei, Taiwan and currently reside in New York City, I received my BFA from Washington State University and MFA from the State University of New York at Albany. I’ve exhibited nationally and internationally since the 1980’s.\n\nWhat would you say is the motivation or inspirational seed for your creative direction?\n\nNature is the motivation for my creative direction, I paint what I see and apply color intuitively depending on how I feel in the moment. A lot of my work relates to natural elements and themes of nature.\n\nFrom the words of Independent Curator and Arts Writer Sarah Tanguy:\n\n“Lines, in Leigh Wen’s art, are the defining agent. They form the hidden pulse and layered score of all the paintings, sculptures, and mixed media works…Etched deep into the surface, they spring and scamper across lush passages of graduated colors, distilling nature’s underlying forces into energized patterns of concentrated beauty.“\n\nI find that while working I go into a deep state of concentration and meditation. Color is used to expand the work’s emotional range; my palette is drawn not from appearances but from the lyric and psychic necessities of my art. The uniformity of line, from edge to edge and painting to painting, implies suppression of the artists hand in favor of objectivity learned from nature.\n\nYou have been involved with ACG for many years now…what keeps you connected with the gallery?\n\nACG held my first show after finishing graduate school and it was very well supported and received. I received a lot of recognition after showing there, including being awarded with the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, NYFA, and Helena Rubinstein grants all in the same year. I still have a lot of friends in the Capital district, and still consider it my home.\n\nAnything coming up that you would like to share?\n\nI will be having a solo show in Chelsea, NYC at Fremin Gallery opening on November 16. I will also be participating in the Art Taipei and Art Miami Art Fair. Locally, I am participating in a sweepstakes with ACG as well to help raise funds for the gallery.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: For those interested in a deep dive on Leigh’s amazing story I have included her official bio here below.\n\nIn 1979, she won the First Prize in Painting in the Ten Outstanding Young Talents Competition in Taiwan. In 1980, she was awarded Outstanding Merit in the Young Artists in Asia Now competition in Hong Kong. In 1995 and 1996, her work was selected in many national and international jury shows including the ninth and tenth Parkside National Small Print Exhibition, Large Small Work ’95 International, Small Works International and the First Annual National Juried Small Work Exhibition in New York, NY. These shows are highly competitive and are chosen from thousands of submissions.\n\nLeigh won the SUNY Albany Purchase Award in 1995 the University of Wisconsin Purchase Award in the 1995 Parkside National Small Print Exhibition. She was also awarded an Artist Grant by the National Taiwan Art and Humanity Foundation in support of her solo exhibitions in the Taipei Fine Arts Museum. A catalog entitled The Harbour and the Open Sea was published by the Taipei Fine Arts Museum. Leigh was awarded a 1997 New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship. In 1997 she was honored with “The Artist Award of 1997” by the New York State Assembly.\n\nIn 1998, Leigh’s work was selected by juror Linda Weintraub to be included in The New York State Biennale Exhibition at The New York State Museum. Also, Juror Lela Hersh, Director of Exhibitions and Collections at the Chicago Contemporary Museum of Art, selected Leigh’s work for inclusion in the annual Mohawk Hudson Region Juried Exhibition. Leigh received First Prize. Her painting, Untitled #6, was purchased by the Albany Institute of History & Art for the permanent collection.\n\nIn 1999 and 2005 she was awarded Artist Grants by the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Since 1999, her paintings have been selected to be part of the Art in Embassies Program of the United States Department of State and have been exhibited in the U.S. Embassies in Jordan, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Botswana, Barbados, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Namibia, Denmark, and Poland. Over 15 American Embassies around the world. In mid-2019 her works were inquired by US Embassy in Botswana for exhibition and a cultural exchange program with Botswana Culture Bureau is scheduled. In 2019 summer a solo exhibition is invited by Farglory Museum, Taipei, Taiwan. It opens on July 13, 2019. Additional international exhibitions include – America University Art Museum, Washington D.C. in 2021, and the Bangkok Art And Culture Centre, Bangkok, Thailand in 2022.\n\nHundreds of her works were included in both private and public collections. Her paintings had been featured in many major magazines including Art in America, New American Paintings, Art in Asia, Sotheby’s Auction Magazine, Christy’s Auction Magazine, Better Home and Gardens, Harper’s Bazaar, Architecture, Water Front Home and Design, San Diego Home and Garden and Interior, Art Trade Journal and Marie Claire, Taiwan.\n\nI found myself on the streets of Albany, literally. After going through some intense personal life changing events, I was struggling to craft a new identity. One that was less corporate, less structured. More creative, rebellious. I was attracted to Arts and Culture and had begun volunteering my time consulting for the Albany Center Gallery and soon joined the Ellen Sinopoli Dance Company board. At around this time (circa 2010), I discovered 1st Night in Albany or ART NIGHT as I used to think of it. My life would never be the same. The scene…it was decadent, divine. So creative, smart and unexpected. The who’s who of the regional arts and culture scene where there, on the streets. Hundreds even thousands converging on Albany – for Arts Sake. You could find excellent family friendly events early at places like the Albany Institute of History and Art, Grand Street Community Arts or ACG. Then as the night got later, renegade pop up events got hotter in vacant buildings like St. Joseph’s Church, 259 Lark Street, 4 Central Ave or at the Upstate Artist Guild. Finally, the grand finale for me was always at Samson Contompasis’ Marketplace Gallery in the East Greenbush Tape and Label Factory (40B!) where you could dance till dawn with the DJ’s, street artists, fashion junkies, art freaks and hangers on that I aspired to become more like.\n\n“First Friday was such a wonderful community event. Going out, connecting with friends, meeting new people. Wandering from place to place, never quite knowing what you might encounter. I hope to see it come back!” Jo Agropovich (Artist and Bass Player with Va Va Voodoos / Retrobilleze)\n\nA few years in, the scene cooled down. It felt diluted. My friends and I slowly stopped considering it a must go on the calendar, scattering to the wind or for me…the Troy scene. Now, post COVID a group wants to bring that creative energy back to Albany, to reclaim the crown…the question is, can it be done?\n\nTo understand the genesis of the movement, I went back and talked to some of the folks who were there at the beginning. As frequently is the case, there are slight variations on the ‘AHA!’ moment and not to mention some key voices missing. That said, I decided to reprint the words of some those who were there verbatim. This is by no means a complete history. Also, there are lots of overlaps and differences that seem to me to be the telling from different perspectives. Remember, the best scenes are not planned, they may have a little structure in the beginning but usually they are based on creative alliances that overlap and importantly in the words of Tommy Watkins “…collaborations of friends, forming new relationships, coming together from the heart with love. People who are obsessed with doing the thing.” From what I can tell, the spark of the idea was born from a show called the MANSION SHOW and its timing in conjunction with a variety of other events hitting critical mass over the following year. This group show was organized by Tommy Watkins circa 2005. It’s also clear to me that Chip Faschiana (Artist) was at all the action points mentioned by founding participants.\n\n“The love of art was the common ground in which we all started. But as time went by we saw an even greater value that came out of creating these events. We saw how bringing every one together on the first Friday became uniquely special. It got people talking, got people sharing. It created a family, a community, a place where everyone was accepted and appreciated no matter who they were or where they came from.” Tommy Watkins (Artist / Founding Member of Upstate Artist Guild)\n\n“Born out of the successful one-night shows of Chip Faschiana and Tommy Watkins, I, as a board member of Upstate Artist Guild and the new Director of the Romaine Brooks Gallery at the Pride Center, decided to align RBG’s shows to UAG’s. I then approached Elizabeth Dubben who had just opened Ambrose + Sable Gallery to see if she wanted to also align her schedule to the first Friday and she agreed. So on Friday September 1, 2006, with 3 galleries in Center Square, 1st Friday Albany was born. A few months later, Sarah Martinez at Albany Center Gallery got on board and we started to grow. I engaged the businesses on Lark and Downtown to show art, to get on the map. We got funding to rent the trolley to do loops between Lark and Downtown. Eventually we added the Opalka Gallery, St Rose, and the University at Albany, which facilitated getting a 2nd trolley, one for uptown and one for downtown. At its peak, 1st Friday had over 50 participating venues, every major art gallery/museum in Albany, and thousands of people a month. For anniversary months, we’d do a 2 page spread in the centerfold of Metroland.” Michael Weidrich (UAG Board Member | Director at Romaine Brooks Gallery at the Pride Center)\n\n(EDITORS NOTE: Think of those peak metrics. This does NOT even include all the overlapping economy that happened due to the influx of traffic to participating neighborhoods that benefited restaurants, bars, coffee shops etc)\n\n“I remember around 2006-13 there was a really vibrant, thriving Art scene that was taking over abandoned spaces and churches with Pop Up shows…independent galleries that were giving a voice to all kinds of artists…IT was exciting and was really moving the conversation forward for what was possible in this region and beyond…an Art Hub! I was happy to be contributing performance / Installation based works that were pretty outlandish…Art that could have easily been dismissed as too dangerous for insurance purposes or eccentric for public scrutiny…yet I was given the opportunity to inspire and be inspired…and live in this area!” Abe Ferraro (Artist | Sculptor and Performance Artist)\n\n“I have fond memories when 1st Friday was just an idea sparked by a conversation between Jeff Mirel, Founder of Albany Barn, Chip Fasciana, co-producer of Albany Underground Artists, and me. We all had shows and events opening the same night, and we wanted to come together to build a crowd rather than promote our events in silos. We wanted to bring the art scene to bring us together rather than pull us apart. Albany Center Gallery was relocating to downtown Albany from the second floor of the Albany Public Library, and had a vision to bring new life to the legacy institution so I was personally invested in making 1st Friday successful…“\n\n“Thankfully, Michael Weidrich, a board member at Upstate Artists Guild at the time took initiative and joined our conversation. Through Weidrich’s dedication and commitment towards the initiative, and teamwork from a host of organizations such as Grand Street Community Arts, Albany Institute of History & Art, Albany Center Gallery, Upstate Artists Guild and a slew of other groups, the monthly event definitely elevated the art scene in Albany and other galleries gained notoriety like the Marketplace Gallery. One-night shows at St. Joseph’s Church and Grand Street Community Arts drew hundreds of people. I am grateful to have been part of this team effort to build up the arts community and it is remarkable to see Albany thrive and grow and reinvent this event.” Sarah Martinez (Director at Albany Center Gallery)\n\nCOVID really put a crimp in the final strands of what was First Night. But, there is now a new initiative to bring it all back. This is being spearheaded by Michelle Toch Dinsmore Partner at Overit Media and Jim Gilbert Owner and Publisher of Nippertown. Overit through participation in the event in the past had seen major traffic generated to support artists they had lined up pre-covid. Michelle indicated that for some shows they would track hundreds of attendees going through the door of their office / venue. Michelle and her team want to build “…upon the foundation of the great First Friday Albany organizers who came before us.” And of course, we all know Jim and his commitment to supporting all things music, art and culture through Nippertown’s online portal. This will be critical for success as in the past the METROLAND played a major part in creating a there there for the event with promotional information, ads and a detailed monthly event map.\n\n“This is the start of something big,” said Jim Gilbert of Nippertown, “and we hope it will develop into something huge. We really hope that the city’s talented creatives will see this as an opportunity to highlight what makes artists so imperative to the overall success of a creative economy, and we encourage everyone to get involved.”\n\nTo this I would personally add, it’s NOT a Creative Economy without the artists and hope that we can remember to center them firmly in the process. After all…the Creative comes first followed by the Economy. Let’s find ways to sustain and provide resources for our value creators and enable them to help in the development of a truly sustaining and sustainable event to the benefit of the overall community.\n\nThe initial relaunch event will be held with a kickoff show at Overit Media at 435 New Scotland Avenue, Albany including 5 artists called The Power of Paper. (Mimi Castiglione-Santiago, Ruby Silvious, Abe Ferraro, Ashton Guy and Lindsay McKeough partner up with collaborative partners The Circus Family and Mohawk Paper) on May 5th from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. This will also serve as the official kick off to the city’s Tulip Week leading up to the 75th Anniversary of the Tulip Festival. Additional events are listed on the Nippertown Event Page and include the arts locations, shows, and food / beverage promotions.\n\nWant to get involved? To connect with participating locations as an artist you can head over to Nippertown’s First Friday Application Page.\n\nPhotos for this article were significantly mined from the collections of my favorite go to photographer at the time Robin Alexandria Kettner-Zebrowski who created a catalog of many who were on the streets in the deep scene and who without I would have been lost. Special mention to Ken Jacobie as well, who had an sharp eye on the art…and seemed to be everywhere all the time.\n\nThere is so much to plumb in this rich history. I may end up doing another article. So many voices to reach out to, images to search and best practice tips to secure!"
