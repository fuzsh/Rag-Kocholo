        "text": "Steve Gayler and Oliver Watkiss first met each other in 2004 while working together in England, where Steve joined International Fine Art Conservation Studios in Bristol UK after graduating from the Courtauld. Steve’s ambitions and desire to work on modern and contemporary artworks soon led him to the USA and eventually to New York, where he worked closely with Suzanne Siano, helping Suzanne establish Modern Art Conservation in NYC. During these years, Steve established himself as a leading paintings conservator, treating important modern and contemporary artworks.\n\nIn 2016, Steve left NYC and moved out West to Los Angeles. In LA, he began working for ArtCare, using his charisma and experience to establish a new studio. It was a realized dream for Steve and Oliver to work together again, albeit from different cities within the USA. It was sadly cut short in 2018 with Steve becoming increasingly ill. Steve sadly succumbed to his illness on September 25th, 2020.\n\nSteve left an impression on everyone he met. He will be remembered for his playfully infectious charm, his love for everything Bond, especially Roger Moore, Cheese O’Clock, and his sublime use of language – with ‘anon’, ‘ciao,’ and closing emails with ‘Breast of duck!’ or ‘Bon Chance’ among the best. He was a great friend and colleague. Steve is greatly missed.\n\nOliver is our CEO and a Partner at ArtCare Conservation. His ArtCare journey began in 2013 following a move to the USA from Wiltshire, England. Born into a family of artists and conservation professionals, Oliver’s exposure to art began as a boy in his Father’s – one of the UK’s most respected structural conservators – studio.\n\nAs an adult, he went on to undertake formal training with NVQ from Strode College in conjunction with an apprenticeship with Richard Pelter at International Fine Art Conservation Studios in Bristol (IFACS), England. His research dissertation, titled “A Study of Contemporary Lining Adhesives and Their Comparable Properties and Suitability under Different Climatic Circumstances,” was widely praised.\n\nOliver went on to spend ten years with IFACS working on many large and high-profile projects, including a four-year conservation project of Oxford University’s Sheldonian Theatre’s ceiling paintings.\n\nIn 2008, Oliver became director of Richard Watkiss’s studio Lydeway Conservation in the United Kingdom, specializing in the structural conservation of old masters on canvas and panel. It was at Lydeway Conservation that Oliver was regularly called upon to work with the Royal Art Collection, Government Art Collection, National Trust, and English Heritage, as well as leading fine art dealers and private collectors.\n\nOliver has led numerous projects since joining ArtCare Conservation, including treatments on Albert Bierstadt’s Domes of Yosemite (1867), and Sandro Botticelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio’s Coronation of the Virgin and the Saints (1492). In 2019, as part of the Getty Institute’s Conserving Canvas Initiative, Oliver carried out the planning and implemented the conservation treatment of the Ringling Museum’s Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, Emperor Justinian (1886). This project included training of eight mid-level painting conservators from worldwide institutions. The project closed with a structural treatment conservation workshop, which included four professors from painting conservation programs in the USA and Canada.\n\nVeronica is our Director of Conservation and a Partner at ArtCare Conservation. She holds an enviable portfolio of academic achievements and professional credentials, including a BFA from the University of The Arts, Pennsylvania, conservation training from Lorenzo d’Medici in Florence, Italy, and the title of Professional Associate with the American Institute of Conservation.\n\nFollowing her return from Italy to the USA in 2004, Veronica started work with our founder Rustin Levenson, where she was at the forefront of the company during its transition to ArtCare Conservation.\n\nVeronica has a special expertise and extensive experience in treating Contemporary, Latin American, and European paintings.\n\nIn 2010, she was a volunteer participant for The Smithsonian Haiti Cultural Recovery Project to rescue, recover, and help restore Haitian artwork damaged and endangered by the earthquake and its aftermath.\n\nShe has given several presentations at meetings for the American Institute for Conservation. In 2008, Veronica spoke to the Paintings Conservation Group at the American Institute for Conservation on methods for flattening textured contemporary paintings. At the AIC meeting in 2009, she was co-presenter of a paper on the treatment of smoke-damaged paintings.\n\nKelly has been part of the ArtCare family since 2013. As Director of the New York Studio and a Partner in the business, she brings to the role a strong academic background with a BA in Art History and an MA in Museum Studies from the University of Florida, Gainesville; and Master of Art Conservation in Paintings from Queen’s University, Kingston, Canada.\n\nPrevious internships include the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Atlanta Art Conservation Center, and the National Gallery of Canada. Kelly’s extensive research on William Aiken Walker is part of the archives of the Florida History Museum in Tallahassee and the University of Florida. After completing Miami Heritage Responders training in 2017 through the Foundation for the Advancement in Conservation, her focus has been on disaster recovery and managing the treatment of large, private collections. Kelly is a Professional Associate of the American Institute of Conservation..\n\nJavier Hernandez is our Managing Director and is a Partner in the business. Joining the ArtCare family in 2012, he is now a lynchpin in our leadership team – and oversees Business Development and National Accounts. He has played an active role in establishing relationships with organizations such as the Center for Contemporary Arts Santa Fe, Perez Art Museum, BFI Gallery, and his own artist run gallery, Placeholder.\n\nFollowing his graduation from Cooper Union with a BFA in 2001, he managed a post-production studio in NYC. Javier’s commercial skills and strategic vision are coupled with his early-developed relationship with the art industry. This rare combination of skills has enabled him to support the company’s growth and future strategy.\n\nMaster of Art Conservation in Paintings from Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario, and a BA in Art Conservation from the University of Delaware. After earning her graduate degree, Blanka held positions at a private Washington, DC-based firm, specializing in easel paintings and murals, and at the University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, where she taught an undergraduate course in painting conservation and co-directed a UD study abroad program in Peru aimed to provide students with hands-on experience in the documentation and treatment of wall paintings.\n\nBlanka has contributed to many large-scale projects in the U.S. and internationally, including the treatment of murals in the U.S Capitol Building, decorative paintings in the Mission San Miguel, CA, and Andean Baroque wall paintings in southern Peru.\n\nPrior to joining ArtCare, Blanka worked at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) on the conservation of the Watts Towers of Simon Rodia, one of LA’s most iconic art landmarks, and on the Damascus Room, a painted and gilded wood interior from the late Ottoman period. She served a key role in project planning and management of the Watts Towers Conservation Project, and worked with conservation scientists and engineers in developing materials testing, treatment, and monitoring protocols, research which culminated in presentations at the 41st and 42nd AIC Annual Meetings and a paper in the AIC Objects Specialty Group Post prints.\n\nBlair is one of our team’s talented Paintings Conservators.
