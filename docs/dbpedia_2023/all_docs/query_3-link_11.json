        "text": "The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art partners with Charlotte Street to host the 2024 Fellows Exhibition\n\nKANSAS CITY, MO, SEPTEMBER 18, 2023: Charlotte Street is pleased to announce the call for 2024 Visual Artist Awards and Generative Performing Artist Awards. Applications will be accepted now through Monday, November 13, 2023 at 11:59 PM on Submittable.Artists can also find these calls on Charlotte Street’s website here. Annually, three visual artists and two generative performing artists are selected to receive $10,000 unrestricted grants. For the first time, in 2024 The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art will partner with Charlotte Street to host the Visual Artist Awards Exhibition.\n\n“It is an exciting privilege to collaborate with Charlotte Street on the presentation of the 2024 Visual Artist Awards exhibition and with the jury panel charged with selecting the Fellows Awards,” said Stephanie Fox Knappe, Sanders Sosland Senior Curator, Global Modern and Contemporary Art, Head American Art. “There is something incredible around every corner in Kansas City’s art scene and I look forward to being part of such a prestigious grant that both recognizes and fosters those creative individuals in our community.”\n\nAlso known as the Charlotte Street Fellow Awards, this series of five unrestricted cash grants to artists is Charlotte Street’s longest running program. Since 1997, Charlotte Street has acknowledged outstanding artistic accomplishment and promise while providing Kansas City artists with essential, career-advancing financial support and critical attention. Since the inception of this program, 29 performing artists and 106 visual artists in the Kansas City region have received this highly regarded award.\n\nAwardees will receive recognition by Charlotte Street throughout 2024—including announcements to media, web-based marketing and promotional efforts, and special events. Visual Artist Fellows are further recognized with a professionally curated exhibition of their work at a high profile, non-profit local art venue. For the majority of the fellows, this is their first opportunity to exhibit work in a prominent museum setting. Charlotte Street’s current institutional partners include the Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, H&R Block Artspace, the Spencer Museum of Art, and starting in 2024, The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.\n\n“The Nelson-Atkins is delighted to partner with the Charlotte Street Foundation in recognizing and supporting Kansas City-based artists,” said Julián Zugazagoitia, Director and CEO of the Nelson-Atkins. “Critical recognition and public exposure are vital to the success of an emerging artist, and these awards provide the financial support needed for the continuation of a vital artistic and professional development.”\n\nFellows are selected through competitive processes beginning with the open call for applications. Artist selections are made by a panel of jurors consisting of renowned and qualified arts professionals. The 2024 Visual Artist and Generative Performing Artist Awardees will be announced on Tuesday, February 13, 2023.\n\nABOUT THE CHARLOTTE STREET VISUAL ARTIST AWARDS\n\nSince 1997, Charlotte Street’s Visual Artist Award has supported 106 outstanding artists living in Kansas City through annual, unrestricted cash awards, with a total of $811,500 now distributed directly to visual artists. These competitive awards recognize locally based artists who are creating outstanding artwork and show great accomplishment and promise. These awards provide financial support, critical attention, and increased exposure for these artists with the aim of fostering their continued artistic and professional development.\n\nABOUT THE CHARLOTTE STREET GENERATIVE PERFORMING ARTIST AWARDS\n\nCharlotte Street launched its Generative Performing Artist Awards in 2008 as a parallel program to the Visual Artist Awards. Charlotte Street continues to act as a catalyst for discovering and supporting contemporary performing art, and has now distributed $250,000 to 29 performing artists creating original new work in the fields of dance, theater, music, performance, spoken word, and hybrid/interdisciplinary performance-based forms. These awards aim to recognize and meaningfully support artists producing exceptional performance-based work that is original, innovative, and progressive.\n\nABOUT CHARLOTTE STREET\n\nCharlotte Street centers Kansas City’s most forward-thinking visual artists, writers, and performers—acting as the primary incubator, provocateur, and connector for the region’s contemporary arts community, and its leading advocate on the national stage. Since 1997, Charlotte Street has distributed over $2 million in awards and grants to artists and their innovative projects, and connected individual artists to each other and to the greater Kansas City community.
