        "text": "Miguel Braceli\n\nMiguel Braceli is an artist, architect, and educator. His practice is focused on participatory art projects in public space; working at the intersection of art, architecture, and social practices; and exploring geopolitical and local conflicts. Most of these projects have been large-scale works developed in Latin America, Europe, and the United States; exhibited in galleries and institutions through photography, sculpture and film. He has led educational projects with institutions such as Documenta Fifteen, The Bronx Museum of Arts, Matadero Madrid, among others. His most recent participations and recognitions include Skowhegan School of Painting (2022), Art Omi (2021), AIM Bronx Museum Fellow (2022), Fulbright Scholar (2020-2019), and Young Artist Award of the Principality of Asturias (2018).

Using repurposed and incorporeal materials, she creates alternative spaces that invite viewers to contemplate the role of the individual—especially marginalized individuals—in society and the built environment. Placemaking can be a poetic act and a tool to build community. These are the core ideals of her art practice. El Sadek has received numerous honors including a 2023 Pollock–Krasner Grant, the 2022 Project Row Houses Southern Survey Biennial Prize, a 2021 Gottlieb Foundation Individual Grant, a 2021 Sustainable Arts Foundation Grant, a 2019 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant, and a Sharjah Biennial Installation Prize, 1999. She also held a one–year appointment as the City of Austin’s first Artist–in–Residence, 2017, embedded in the City’s Watershed Protection Department investigating social and environmental issues. In 2009, El Sadek was one of 88 female artists included in REBELLE: Art and Feminism 1969-2009 – an extensive forty–year survey of feminist artwork at Museum voor Moderne Kunst, Arnhem, Netherlands. Selected residencies include MacDowell Fellowship, 2020; Bemis Center For Contemporary Arts, 2022; MacColl Center, 2021; Vermont–Studio Center; Gasworks Studios–London; and Art Omi.\n\nJeff Gibbons\n\nJeff Gibbons (b. Detroit, 1982) is an intermedia artist. His work has been shown internationally in México, Japan, and across Europe.

In 2018, he spoke about ice at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.\n\nMicha Patiniott\n\nMicha Patiniott creates minimalistic and atmospheric paintings of everyday objects and processes in flux, blurring the boundaries of the mundane and the cosmic. Familiar and intimate subjects, such as the blinking of a butterfly’s wings, the throbbing of private body parts, the curving of a mathematical object, and the turning of an ambiguous portrait, transform into sensuous otherness through painterly modifications. Bodies and objects gently float and are in the midst of changing form—they may vanish entirely, or exist in indeterminate stages of becoming. Some parts remain enigmatically blurred and abstracted, while others emerge with sharp clarity. A play of nebulous light and skewed colors alludes to a contemporary take on historical painting techniques like impressionism and sfumato. Patiniott embraces impermanence as a crucial element in experiencing the transcendent and sublime, reflecting the metamodernism concept of exploring ever-shifting perspectives of the self. He lives and works in Amsterdam, and holds an MA from the HKU University of the Arts Utrecht. He was a resident artist at the Rijksakademie Amsterdam (2006-07) and the Fine Arts Work Center Provincetown (2008-09). Solo and group exhibitions include the Stedelijk Museum Schiedam; Anna Zorina Gallery, New York; PuntWG, Amsterdam; Cinnamon, Rotterdam; Heden, Den Haag; WHATSPACE, Tilburg; MKgalerie, Rotterdam; Galerie Sturm, Nuremberg; Dordrechts Museum; Whitechapel Gallery, London; Arti et Amicitiae, Amsterdam; and Museum Hilversum. Patiniott is a returning Fellow from 2008-2009.\n\nLaRissa Rogers\n\nLaRissa Rogers (b. 1996) is a Black and Korean visual artist raised in Ruckersville, VA.

She is interested in choosing charged objects, images, and gestures that obey some mysterious order—and cultivating rather than eradicating that sense of mystery. Through her careful investigation of everyday phenomena, it emerges that these stand as metaphors for wider questions about how and why we live together. With tenderness and humor, she seeks in her work to question a forward trajectory. This often involves an invitation to others to coauthor and collaborate. Ruusuvuori holds an MLitt in Fine Art Practice from the Glasgow School of Art and a BA in documentary film directing from Aalto University, Helsinki. She has participated in residencies at the Cité International des Arts Paris and at the Fine Arts Work Center, while her work has been shown at international film festivals, including Visions du Réel, Toronto Hot Docs, Camden International Film Festival, and London Short Film Festival.

Anders is a returning Fellow.\n\nGrace Chao\n\nGrace Chao was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area. Her writing is preoccupied with how time and memory distort perceptions of crucial relationships; with loss of faith; and with what happens when a family’s dreams, whether grand or ordinary, are broken.
