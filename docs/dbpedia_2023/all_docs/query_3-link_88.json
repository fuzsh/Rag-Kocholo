        "text": "Joe Sacco\n\nJoe Sacco is a Maltese-American comic book artist and journalist whose work is a compelling combination of eyewitness reportage and graphic art storytelling techniques.\n\nHe won the prestigious American Book Award in 1996 for graphic novel, Palestine. Since then he has covered complex topics ranging from the Bosnian conflict in the late nineties (Safe Area Gorazde) to his depiction of the Battle of the Somme in the first world war.\n\nHis highly acclaimed work has appeared many times in the Guardian and Observer. His most recent piece was a response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris, and the limits of satire, in January this year.\n\nComics have a rich history and many great cartoonists have done outstanding work in the past without the sort of recognition that cartoonists today are enjoying. That said, the doors that cartoonists of past generations opened up have now been entered by their very worthy heirs. I can’t think of a better time in the history of comic books. There are many great creators working today, pushing the boundaries of the form.\n\nBianca Jagger\n\nBianca Jagger is founder, president and chief executive of the Bianca Jagger Human Rights Foundation, a Council of Europe goodwill ambassador, IUCN Bonn Challenge ambassador, a member of the Executive Director’s Leadership Council of Amnesty International USA, patron of the Circle of Conscience, Amnesty International, a member of the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, and a member of the Women and Girls Lead Leadership Council.\n\nFor more than three decades she has been a voice for the most vulnerable members of society, campaigning for human rights, civil liberties, peace, social justice and environmental protection throughout the world.\n\nComics are a unique and powerful medium of expression. They transcend the boundaries of the written word – of language, cultures and borders.\n\nComics are often social and political commentaries that can influence people’s views. They can refer to fiction or real events, can use humour or satire, caricatures and symbolism, to help people understand issues of social justice, human rights and the environment.\n\nThe internet has revived cartoons and to a certain extent comics. Traditional newspaper sales may be declining, but cartoonists and comics can use the internet to reach greater audiences than they ever did before. Online publishing is not dependent on media barons, big conglomerates and editorial control or the politics of their owners. This has allowed for an explosion of creativity. The internet provides a wider audience – cartoons and short comics strips can be tweeted and instantly be read by millions of followers.\n\nPaul Gravett\n\nAcknowledged by The Times as “the greatest historian of the comics and graphic novel form in this country,” Paul Gravett is a London-based writer, lecturer, broadcaster, curator and comics activist specialising in international comics art. In 1983, he co-founded Escape Magazine with Peter Stanbury, to promote a new generation of British talents including Eddie Campbell, Jamie Hewlett, Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean.\n\nHe has curated numerous exhibitions in the UK and abroad, including God Save The Comics!, Strip Search, Hypercomics: The Shapes of Comics to Come, and retrospectives of the works of Tove Jansson, Jack Kirby and Posy Simmonds. In 2014, with John Harris Dunning, he co-curated the British Library exhibition, Comics Unmasked: Art and Anarchy in the UK, and co-authored the accompanying book.\n\nHe is the author of Manga: Sixty Years of Japanese Comics, Graphic Novels: Stories to Change Your Life, and Comics Art, co-author of Great British Comics and The Leather Nun & Other Incredibly Strange Comics, and editor of The Mammoth Book of Best Crime Comics and 1,001 Comics You Must Read Before You Die. Since 2003 he has been co-director of Comica, the London International Comics Festival.\n\nHis writings and reviews appear in, among others, the Guardian, the Independent, the Times Literary Supplement, ArtReview, ArtReview Asia and on his website: paulgravett.com.\n\nPaul also helped found, research, plan and launch the #opencomics project.\n\nComics is a medium at the crossroads of all the other arts. When you think how much humankind has done with words, and how much we’ve done with pictures, there’s still so much more for us to do when we put words and pictures together. For me you can tell the best comics, in whatever genre or style, by whether they come across as truly alive, driven by a commitment to communication and self-expression, for making the reader understand, feel and empathise.\n\nWhat I most admire are comics that allow me to see the world through fresh eyes. For example, Sharad Sharma’s inspirational World Comics India workshops empower people whose voices rarely get heard to create their own comics and share them as wall posters. This method was used recently for residents of the Aylesbury Estate in London, most of whom did not identify themselves as skilled artists, to communicate their points of view powerfully through the comic form.\n\nAmruta Patil\n\nAmruta Patil is a writer and painter who currently divides her time between India and France. She is the author of graphic novels Kari and Adi Parva.\n\nRecurring themes in her work include mythology, memento mori, sexuality, sustainable living and the unbroken thread of stories passed down from storyteller to storyteller through the ages. You can find out more about Amruta’s work on her website: http://amrutapatil.blogspot.com\n\nThe potential to move between outer and inner worlds draws me most to graphic storytelling; the ability to go where cameras can’t. What one hopes to meet are alternative ethnographies. Non-urban experiences and migrant experiences recounted inside-out rather than outside-in. Lateral-thinking specialists making important-but-dense stories accessible. Reportage about ecology that is unsentimental but compelling. Over and above all, one hopes to meet authentic form and content: stories that are often unwritten for the singular ‘folly’ of being unusual or unmarketeable.\n\nJohn Harris Dunning\n\nJohn Harris Dunning is a writer and curator. He is the author of graphic novel, Salem Brownstone: All Along the Watchtowers (2009). Dunning instigated and co-curated the exhibition Comics Unmasked: Art & Anarchy in the UK at the British Library, and co-authored the accompanying coffee table book with Paul Gravett. He also helped set up the ongoing UK-based Comica Festival with Gravett.\n\nHe has written for the Guardian and Metro newspapers, and has contributed to Esquire, GQ, Arena, iD and Dazed & Confused, to name a few. He was also features editor at Port magazine.\n\nHis comics work appeared at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts as a part of Comica Festival in 2003, and his series Salem Brownstone featured in award-winning UK anthology Sturgeon White Moss and in the book Pictures and Words. He has lectured at Roehampton University and appeared as a guest at the Hay Festival, the Cheltenham Literature Festival and at the Ashmolean Museum.\n\nJohn also helped found, research, plan and launch the #opencomics project.\n\nComics have never been more diverse or had broader appeal. This is due to a number of factors. One is that digital media has meant that a whole new audience has sprung up that has never read print comics. As a medium, comics are particularly well-suited to being consumed on phones, tablets and screens – arguably more so then plain print or moving image.\n\nThe recent critical acclaim of comics in the literary world, the reassessment of their impact on fine art, and their adaptation into award-winning films mean their cultural cachet has never been higher. Their entertainment value has never been in question, but the acknowledgment of their importance as a form of political commentary, autobiographical tool and way of communicating history and scientific ideas have opened up their appeal immensely, particularly as a mode of dissension and education. For that reason, comics creators have an unprecedented freedom, in terms of form and content.\n\nBenjamin Dix\n\nBenjamin Dix founded PositiveNegatives, an agency producing literary comics about social and human rights issues in 2012. PositiveNegatives combines ethnographic research with illustration and photography, adapting personal testimonies into art, education and advocacy materials.\n\nHe has worked as a communications manager for the UN and NGOs across Asia and Africa for the past 12 years and is a professional photographer. He was based in Vanni, Sri Lanka with the UN from 2004 until the UN evacuation in 2008.\n\nDix is currently writing his Doctorate in Anthropology: Artistic Representation of Violence (Sussex).\n\nJoe Sacco’s Palestine was the first graphic novel I read. I read it in a bunker through the conflict in north Sri Lanka while working for the UN. I found that the medium of the comic to convey complex stories really engaging and felt I wanted to tell stories in that form."
