        "text": "Milton Avery: Paintings from the Neuberger Museum Collection\n\nCurated by Karl Willers\n\nJanuary 28 â€“ May 30, 2004\n\nMorgan Anderson Gallery, Howard Greenberg Family Gallery, Sara Bedrick Gallery\n\nRemaining faithful to his own artistic vision, and defying the popular art movements of his day, Milton Avery forged his own aesthetic path through modernity. This exceptional exhibition highlights 29 works of art, rarely exhibited in the region, documenting Avery's artistic development from 1929 to 1961.\n\nRoy R. Neuberger was one of this country's most recognized patrons of American Art. Encountering the work of Milton Avery around 1940, he quickly acquired a large personal collection of the artist's works and has gifted many to museums across the United States.\n\nCard Players (1944), the major canvas by Milton Avery in the Permanent Collection of the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art, was given by Mr. And Mrs. Roy Neuberger in 1954 and will also be on view during the exhibition.\n\nAbout Avery and his work: In recent years, appreciation of Avery's work has experienced a renaissance and his paintings have taken their rightfully prominent place in the history of modern American Art. An unassuming man who shied away from publicity, Avery was not allied with the avant-garde, regionalist, or social realist movement of the 1930s, and even less a part of the gesture abstractionists of the 1940s and 1950s. Considered too radical for the critics, Avery remained out of favor for years, and lived modestly for most of his life.\n\nMilton Avery: Paintings from the Collection of the Neuberger Museum of Art embodies Avery's classic motifs-intimate groupings of friends, portraits, still lifes, seascapes, and landscapes-with his characteristic flattened, color harmonies and respect for his chosen subjects. While Avery's interest in representing everyday life in his work did not change with time, he did increasingly experiment in saturated color and simplified forms beginning in the 1930s.\n\nIn the 1940s, the prolific Avery replaced his brushy paint application and graphic detailing with more daring areas of flattened color. His intense concentration on color and ever more simplified form became evident, as shape and color now shared equal importance in his works.\n\nIn the late 1940's and into the 1950's Avery began concentrating on larger fields of flat color and capturing relationships between more generalized elements in his compositions. Even as Abstract Expressionism dominated the post-war art world, Avery continued his explorations in color harmonies, shapes and everyday experiences. Avery has often been called the American Matisse for his use of vibrant colors and fluid outlines simple in his later work.\n\nAround 1957 Avery's work shifted again, this time working on a larger scale resulting in a greater impact of composition and color. This style gained him extraordinary critical acclaim and a retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 1960.\n\nIn 1962, Avery suffered a second heart attack, and his health continued to deteriorate steadily until his death in 1965. Throughout his life, Avery demonstrated perseverance as a solitary artist pushing representation to the border of abstraction with a lyrical elegance. During his career, he has been credited with influencing other notable painters including Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko. Rothko, at Avery's memorial, gave the following tribute:\n\nThere have been several others in our generation who have celebrated the world around them, but none with that inevitability where the poetry penetrated every pore of the canvas to the very last touch of the brush. For Avery was a great poet-inventor who had invented sonorities never seen or heard before. From these we have learned much and will learn more for a long time to come.\n\nThis exhibition is dedicated to the memory of Adeline Dorsky. Support for this exhibition is provided by The Dorsky Foundation, Inc.\n\nThis exhibition is part of the SDMA's continuing Hudson Valley Masters Series, which highlights work created by artists who have lived and worked in the Hudson Valley and Catskill regions. Milton Avery summered in Woodstock, New York and was a member of the Woodstock Art Association.\n\nAbout the Neuberger Museum collection: Roy R. Neuberger, one of this country's most respected collectors and patrons of American art was attracted to Avery's nuances of color as well as the simplified forms of his work. Convinced of Avery's significance, Neuberger acquired over one hundred of the artist's paintings within a short period of time, making his the largest private collection of Avery's work. In 1974, the gift of a considerable portion of Roy R. Neuberger's collection created the Neuberger Museum of Art of the State University of New York at Purchase.\n\nA fully illustrated catalogue, featuring an essay by Barbara Haskell, accompanies the exhibition."
