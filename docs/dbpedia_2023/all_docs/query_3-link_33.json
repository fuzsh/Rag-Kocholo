Microscopes, magnifying glasses, and virtual imaging techniques reveal a world of great beauty and complexity. That world contains the smallest particles, tiniest organisms, smallest landscape, or natural details and provides us with an abundance of artistic inspiration. The art quilts in the exhibit explore a corner of the world at high magnification, capturing tiny wonders at the microscopic level, or by zooming in on a larger object to show its smallest details.

Wagner, LLC, David J. Wagner Ph.D., Curator/Tour Director (October 5, 2023 - February 14, 2024)Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, cars and motorcycles have not only been ubiquitous on the nation s streets and highways, but also in film, top forty hits, and in painting. With the emergence of photo-realism in the 1960 s, motor vehicles assumed a special place of distinction as subject matter in the iconography of American art.

Gallery Verde, 417 S. Oakes St., San Angelo, TX The Peacemakers: Works by Felice House and Dana Younger (July 20   October 8, 2023) The San Angelo Museum of Fine Arts presents College Station-based husband and wife duo, sculptor Dana Younger and painter Felice House, celebrating the Western landscape and reimagining the Western narrative in their thought-provoking artwork.  For more than a century the West has occupied a special place in the imagination of Americans, with perhaps only one foot in reality,  the artists write.  By subverting expectations, House and Younger are questioning a genre, not only in its historical context, but as a contemporary fantasy with roots so deep in American culture that they are quite possibly inexorable.  Felice House is a figurative painter who strives, through her portrayals of women, to provide a counterpoint to the passive female representations found in art historical tradition. She projects contemporary women into iconic roles formerly played by western movie icons such as John Wayne, James Dean and Gary Cooper. By placing women in these roles, she points a finger at the limited access of women to power in culture. House is an Associate Professor in the School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts at Texas A&M. Dana Younger uses a wide variety of sculptural mediums to call attention to cultural heritage that warrants reexamination. His work juxtaposes romanticized Western conventions with real people and damage associated with westward expansion. Humor, beauty, and biting commentary combine in his work and invite the viewer to take another look. Celebrating San Angelo's Own Plein Air Artists (June 10 - July 9, 2023)  Celebrating San Angelo s Own Plein Air Artists  will be on display in the Coop Gallery.

Some of the works were created by academically trained masters schooled in European traditions, and others by humble self-taught artisans. Some of the objects adorned magnificent monasteries and churches, and others were created for devotional use in private homes. All of the art in SAMFA s Spanish Colonial and Latin American collection represents the unique character and importance of the Catholic faith in Latin America, and the deep devotion of its followers. These works have made their home here in San Angelo thanks to the generosity of six major donors: Fred Pottinger, The Art and Eva Camu�ez Tucker Foundation, Hamp and Bonnie Beesley, Richard Parkman, Thomas Duckworth, and Charlotte and Stephanie March, in memory of their mother, Laura Derby.

Charles Umlauf taught at the University of Texas, Austin, from 1941 to 1981. During his long career, he inspired countless students, some of whom, such as Farrah Fawcett, went on to other careers, and others who became world-famous sculptors, such as Luis Jim�nez and Bob  Daddy-O  Wade.

They can be found all over the world, are familiar to us and are nonetheless alien, since they appear in a wide variety of forms in the most remote regions, off the beaten track and wonderful: Bus Stops often unexpected and unprepossessing, or imposing, quirky. Michael Kruscha photographed bus stops while traveling over several years, in many countries, on many continents, around the world. His series comprises images from Eastern Europe, Kazakhstan and Armenia, the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East, northern and southern Africa, South America, and Asia. Where Do You Go Dancing?

Microscopes, magnifying glasses, and virtual imaging techniques reveal a world of great beauty and complexity. That world contains the smallest particles, tiniest organisms, smallest landscape, or natural details and provides us with an abundance of artistic inspiration. The art quilts in the exhibit explore a corner of the world at high magnification, capturing tiny wonders at the microscopic level, or by zooming in on a larger object to show its smallest details.\n\nN.C. Wyeth and the Golden Age of American Illustration (January 19 – March 31, 2024)\n\nThis intimate selection of works from the collection of Joel and Suzanne Sugg features seldom-seen paintings by N.C. Wyeth (1882 - 1945), the patriarch of the Wyeth dynasty of painters. The exhibit also includes works by his contemporary, Frank Schoonover (1877 – 1972), and their teacher, Howard Pyle (1853 – 1911). The art in the exhibit is accompanied by the published works their paintings were created to illustrate. Best known for their iconic illustrations of adventure novels, Wyeth and Schoonover (and Pyle before them) helped to define the familiar imagery associated with pirates, Robin Hood, and other characters of popular literature.\n\nThis exhibit also includes a loan from the Diamond M Collection at the Museum of Texas Tech University.\n\n2023 Exhibits\n\nLuster: Realism and Hyperrealism in Contemporary Automobile and Motorcycle PaintingProduced by David J.

Oakes St., San Angelo, TX\n\nThe Peacemakers: Works by Felice House and Dana Younger (July 20 – October 8, 2023) The San Angelo Museum of Fine Arts presents College Station-based husband and wife duo, sculptor Dana Younger and painter Felice House, celebrating the Western landscape and reimagining the Western narrative in their thought-provoking artwork.\n\n“For more than a century the West has occupied a special place in the imagination of Americans, with perhaps only one foot in reality,” the artists write. “By subverting expectations, House and Younger are questioning a genre, not only in its historical context, but as a contemporary fantasy with roots so deep in American culture that they are quite possibly inexorable.”\n\nFelice House is a figurative painter who strives, through her portrayals of women, to provide a counterpoint to the passive female representations found in art historical tradition. She projects contemporary women into iconic roles formerly played by western movie icons such as John Wayne, James Dean and Gary Cooper. By placing women in these roles, she points a finger at the limited access of women to power in culture. House is an Associate Professor in the School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts at Texas A&M.\n\nDana Younger uses a wide variety of sculptural mediums to call attention to cultural heritage that warrants reexamination. His work juxtaposes romanticized Western conventions with real people and damage associated with westward expansion. Humor, beauty, and biting commentary combine in his work and invite the viewer to take another look.\n\nCelebrating San Angelo's Own Plein Air Artists (June 10 - July 9, 2023)\n\n“Celebrating San Angelo’s Own Plein Air Artists” will be on display in the Coop Gallery.

These works were created between 1600 and 1900, from the time of Spanish rule to after Mexican independence. Some of the works were created by academically trained masters schooled in European traditions, and others by humble self-taught artisans. Some of the objects adorned magnificent monasteries and churches, and others were created for devotional use in private homes. All of the art in SAMFA’s Spanish Colonial and Latin American collection represents the unique character and importance of the Catholic faith in Latin America, and the deep devotion of its followers. These works have made their home here in San Angelo thanks to the generosity of six major donors: Fred Pottinger, The Art and Eva Camuñez Tucker Foundation, Hamp and Bonnie Beesley, Richard Parkman, Thomas Duckworth, and Charlotte and Stephanie March, in memory of their mother, Laura Derby.\n\nA Passion for Teaching: Umlauf and His Influence\n\n(December 9, 2022 - February 5, 2023) Works by legendary Texas artist Charles Umlauf (1911 – 1994) from the Dale Huggins-Jonathon Todd Collection, side-by-side with works by two of his most brilliant University of Texas students, Maurice Schmidt (b. 1936) and Margaret Stites (1910 – 2003). Charles Umlauf taught at the University of Texas, Austin, from 1941 to 1981. During his long career, he inspired countless students, some of whom, such as Farrah Fawcett, went on to other careers, and others who became world-famous sculptors, such as Luis Jiménez and Bob “Daddy-O” Wade. Alongside the exceptional Huggins-Todd collection of Umlauf’s works, this exhibit highlights two of Umlauf’s students who aren’t internationally known, because they chose to focus their careers on inspiring students in the way Umlauf inspired them. Margaret Stites and Maurice Schmidt helped establish the art programs at small rural colleges in Texas, Stites at Angelo State University and Schmidt at Texas A&M, Kingsville. Their extraordinary art has not often been seen outside of their communities.\n\nTrue Texas II: Folk & Traditional Arts from the Concho Valley to the Rio Grande\n\n(September 22 – November 27, 2022) This exhibit is the culmination of the second part of the museum’s True Texas project, designed to identify and showcase local folk and craft traditions.
