She originally from Northern Michigan, where she learned to be curious and aware of the space around her. She grew her artistic confidence in forests of towering hardwoods and pine trees that span miles of rolling hills. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in Art History and German and a minor in Museum Studies from the University of Michigan in 2018 and recently completed a Master of Arts in Teaching at Maryland Institute College of Art in May 2023. She began teaching in 2019, inspired by students’ strength in outdoor education, and wanted to incorporate those dispositions into her own classroom. She wants students to know their ideas have value, problem solve how to express these ideas, and understand the impact their creations have on others.Outside of teaching, she loves experimenting with her own art and baking delicious treats.\n\nLearn More\n\nDavid Antonio Cruz\n\nDavid Antonio Cruz uses painting and performance to explore the visibility and intersectionality of brown, black, and queer bodies.

While serving a six-year prison sentence he produced and smuggled out numerous bodies of work, established prison art programs, and formed artist collectives. After his release, he co-founded Right of Return USA, the first national fellowship dedicated to supporting formerly incarcerated artists.

Lovell began his career as an artist after dropping out of the graphic design program at the University of West Georgia as an undergraduate, realizing his need to embrace a new creative path. This epiphany Lovell had in 2014 was his point of departure from a more formal to informal and unorthodox mode of artistic production. He later emerged as a self-taught artist, showing his work on the Atlanta art scene and beyond. Lovell has since developed a unique style and approach to painting, as he poses a dialogue between interspersed impasto and flat surrealist styles on canvas, to create imaginative portraits—using heavy paint application to highlight the human form. His development as a portrait painter has led to works of a very quotidian and common nature—while reifying the lived experiences of his peers.\n\nLearn More\n\nMary Mattingly\n\nMary Mattingly is an interdisciplinary artist who is driven to explore imagined socio-ecological futures. She builds sculptural ecosystems that prioritize access to food and clean water, resulting in large-scale participatory platforms around the world she calls “proposals”. These proposals rely on absurdity and chance encounters to shift perceptions. In 2016, she led Swale, a floating sculpture and edible landscape on a barge in New York that depended upon water common law and inspired NYC Parks to establish their first public “Foodway.” In a city where foraging is otherwise prohibited, the Foodway provides a place where people can legally gather food from public land. Mattingly is also known for bundling personal objects into large sculptures about consumption and for large-scale artworks like Limnal Lacrimosa (of Lakes, Tears) in Montana; Vanishing Point in the UK; and the Waterpod in New York. Mattingly’s work has also been exhibited at institutions such as Storm King Art Center, the International Center of Photography, Seoul Art Center, the Brooklyn Museum, Palais de Tokyo, Barbican Art Gallery, and Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes in Havana. Notable grants include the James L. Knight Foundation, the Harpo Foundation, New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Jerome Foundation.\n\nLearn More\n\nAlan Michelson\n\nAlan Michelson is an internationally recognized New York-based artist, curator, writer, lecturer and Mohawk member of the Six Nations of the Grand River.

Traveling to Japan in 1976 through 1982, he studied sumi brush painting with Koh Ito Sensei and Japanese woodblock printmaking, Mokuhanga with Takashi Okubo Sensei. Hiroki and Setsuko Morinoue established Studio 7 Fine Arts Gallery in November 1979, as the first and now longest standing contemporary art gallery in Hawaii. A humble space in a small village with a charmed history, the gallery holds an open-ended mission: to create and promote Contemporary Art. For Hiroki the landscape of Hawaii, its light, rocks, skies, and water has deeply influenced his work alongside the aesthetic of Japanese arts, crafts and landscaped gardens, which is prevalent in his work. In all of Morinoue’s work there is a compelling sense of place, curiosity and dialogue between the art and its viewer. He is a patient observer of nature, the rhythms of the ocean shoreline, the fluidity of lava flows, patterns of light on water, using symbols as suggestive messages and patterns from nature. He transcends these observations in various mediums, including watercolor, oil, acrylic and mix media paintings, monotypes, sculptures, photography, ceramics and Mokuhanga (Japanese woodblock prints). Hiroki Morinoue has shown widely in the United States and Japan. He has completed several major public art commissions, including projects at the Honolulu Public Library, and for the Hawaii Convention Center in 1996-97 where he executed a 90 foot mural titled Mauka, Makai. His work can also be viewed at Pahoa High School Library and First Hawaiian Bank. Morinoue’s work is represented in the collections of The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, The Honolulu Academy of Arts, The Hawaii State Foundation for Culture and the Arts, Neiman-Marcus in Honolulu & Chicago, Verizon Hawaii, Achenbach Foundation of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, The National Parks, Maryland, Ueno No Mori Museum, Tokyo, the Davis Museum at Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA. and many private commissions and collections.\n\nLearn More\n\nVanessa Porras\n\nVanessa Porras is a printmaking artist and an art educator.

My art captures the themes, colors and rich symbolism of my native home of Mexico. In 2010, I shifted the focus of my work from commercial art to art activism, after witnessing the repeated injustices and dysfunction of our immigration system. My work is featured in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Anacostia Museum has been exhibited in venues including the McColl Center for Arts and Innovation, Levine Museum of the New South, Elder Gallery of Contemporary Art, the Leyland Gallery at Georgia College, UNCC’s Projective Eye Gallery, the City of Raleigh Museum, the Latin American Center for Arts Gallery, the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute, and the Mexican Cultural Institute at the Mexican Embassy in Washington D.C. My public murals celebrate the rich history as well as the changing demographics of the South. I also use my art to document social conditions, and to raise awareness about issues that are affecting immigrant communities such as family separation, access to public education, racism and moving beyond common stereotypes. My story, The Magic Kite, was adapted by The Children’s Theatre of Charlotte, and is also performed as part of my Suitcase Stories one-woman show, which was featured at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. I have been a featured speaker for the North Carolina ASC, Creative Mornings, Johnson & Wales University, George Washington University, the National Association of Latino Arts and Culture, and the Southern Foodways Alliance. I combine my creative process with community engagement and action in a practice I call “Artivism.” I have a strong track record of successful collaboration with the ASC in community arts programming. I have worked with The Community School of the Arts, LaCa Projects, UNCC and Johnson and Wales University. I operate the Red Calaca Mobile Art Studio, a 24’ “Art Truck” that is a mobile creative space that I use to take art into communities that are underserved by cultural institutions. I have conducted dozens of artmaking workshops, impacting hundreds of participants with my art truck & the ASC’s Culture Blocks Program. My art promotes dialogue around social justice issues and community concerns, and brings together a diverse citizenry through community-based, grassroots collaboration. The murals that I am most proud of were collaborative works with the community. I love to take the history, vision and character of a community and represent it with my art. I strongly believe in the transformational power of public art and in the use of art as a connector of communities and a method of enriching societies.\n\nLearn More"
