        "text": "The daughter of artists, Claire Nivola drew incessantly as a child and developed exceptional skill without the academic regimen of art school. Fresh out of college, Nivola inherited a book project from her father who deflected a publishing offer from the esteemed editor Fabio Coen at Pantheon. Tasked with creating illustrations for Disobedient Eels and Other Italian Tales (1970), its resulting publication encouraged Nivola to pursue this career path. Her drawings comprised an energetic, nervous draftsmanship overlaid with delicate washes of color suggestive of the French artist Raoul Dufy and—perhaps closer to home—Ludwig Bemelmans, the creator of Madeline. Subsequently, Nivola was stymied by rejection, receiving only two more commissions during the decade—one of which was a collaboration with her mother Ruth titled The Messy Rabbit (1978), a cautionary tale about personal responsibility. For her third book—the ecologically concerned Save the Earth (1978)—Nivola worked with editor Frances Foster. This collaboration would resuscitate Nivola’s career in the profession almost 20 years later, as Foster became legendary in the field of children’s literature.\n\nNivola pursued painting, graphic design, and mural painting. She married and had her first child in 1983. In 1992, after an extended hiatus to raise her family, she made a rare exception and accepted a commission to create 53 bas-relief panels recounting the shifting human relationship to the Tennessee River for the Chattanooga Aquarium. She worked on the panels after her children went to bed, and they often commented on the works before being shipped out. Two years later, serendipity re-connected Nivola with Foster when an illustrator withdrew from a project: Betty Jean Lifton’s Tell Me a Real Adoption Story (1994). This opportunity led to a collaboration of eight books over the next two decades.\n\nNivola’s subjects range from the intensely personal—her parents and family—to illustrating the lives of such prominent women as poet Emily Dickinson (albeit in charmingly fictional form), author Emma Lazarus, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, and activist Wangari Maathai. Her books have played an important role in articulating the achievements of women. A rare consideration of men appears in The Secret Kingdom: Nek Chand, a Changing India, and a Hidden World of Art (2018), by Barbara Rosenstock. Nivola’s own longtime admiration of India’s vibrant colors and tradition of miniature painting and her husband’s interest in the culture and religions of India inspired her to accept the project. She appreciated the connection to the planned city of Chandigarh, the joint capital of the northern Indian states of Punjab and Haryana. The prominent French 20th-century architect Le Corbusier, who was a friend of and powerful influence on Nivola’s father, Costantino, had designed this ambitious undertaking. The ensuing essay considers Nivola’s career through the lens of three books with a personal connection, two based in fiction, and five that are biographical.\n\nIn the wake of her reunion with Foster, Nivola wrote her about an idea for a book based on the story of her mother’s escape from Nazi Germany,1 which developed into the 1997 picture book Elisabeth. In an undated six-page letter, (written at Nivola’s request, which then became the basis for the book) her mother Ruth recounts her escape from Berlin, forced to leave everything behind, including her beloved doll, Elisabeth.2 In 1953, when she was turning six, Claire asked her mother for a doll. Ruth, like her husband, maintained very high standards and eschewed any mass-market mediocrity; consequently, she scoured the antique shops in East Hampton, Long Island where they lived, and were, coincidentally, neighbors and friends of the de Koonings (Willem and Elaine) and Pollocks (Jackson and Lee Krasner). In one of the shops, a familiar “vintage” doll caught Ruth’s eye, and, upon inspection, she noticed the right forearm had two puncture marks in the very same spot where her dog Fifi had bitten Elisabeth years ago. She purchased the doll and gave it to her daughter, who subsequently handed it down to her daughter, and it remains in the family to this day. While the odds are extraordinary, the evidence is persuasive that this doll is one and the same. This personal narrative anticipated by two years Tomi Ungerer’s equally implausible account of poignant serendipity, Otto: The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear (1999). Through the eyes of a beloved teddy bear, Ungerer provides a heart-wrenching account of the devastation of the Holocaust tempered by the reunion in America of two childhood friends, one Jewish and one Christian, through the equally improbable re-connection with Otto at center stage.\n\nArtistically, Nivola combines a subtle, seemingly untutored clarity with a sophisticated, delicately dappled touch. Intricacy supports an overarching commitment to visual intelligibility where clean, spare lines coexist with luxuriant patterning. She also relishes in insinuating visual references of her varied artistic heroes, ranging from Early Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca, Impressionist Edgar Degas, and modernist Henri “Douanier” Rousseau, in the guise of “paintings-within-paintings.” Nivola observes that she selects postcards from her collection to complement the palette and design of the spread in question. On the back cover of Elisabeth, the triple hang of works adjacent to a tall clock comprise two references to Piero della Francesca and a historical photograph of Ruth taken in Berlin when she was a girl. The uppermost image echoes Piero’s Dream of Constantine, part of the Legend of the True Cross, 1464 (Basilica, San Francesco, Arezzo). The middle image is a painterly depiction of the photograph Ruth provided her daughter, in what must have been a more halcyon time in Berlin.3 The final image in the trio constitutes of a detail from Piero’s Discovery and Proof of the True Cross, ca. 1460, also part of the fresco program for the Basilica of San Francesco, Arezzo.\n\n1 Claire Nivola to Frances Foster, dated November 12, 1995; photocopy retained by the author.\n\n2 Ruth Nivola to Claire Nivola, undated hand-written letter; in the possession of the artist.\n\n3 Photocopy of undated original photograph in the possession of the artist.\n\n4 See Thomas Friedrich, Berlin Between The Wars [New York: the Vendome Press, 1991], pp. 70 et passim.\n\n5 Anon., Elisabeth, Kirkus Reviews, https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/claire-a-nivola/elisabeth/ retrieved 11/04/2022 and Susan Bloom, Elisabeth, The Horn Book Magazine, May/June, 1997, pp. 310-311.\n\n6 Jennifer M.
