        "text": "“Creative art is for all time, and is therefore independent of time. It is of all ages, of every land, and if by this we mean that the creative spirit in man which produces a picture or a statue is common to the whole civilized world, independent of age, race and nationality, the statement may stand unchallenged.”[i]\n\nKnown for her large-scale abstract paintings comprised of rhythmic marks of exuberant color, Alma Thomas (1891-1978) was born in Columbus, Georgia in 1891. Her parents, John Harris and Amelia Cantey Thomas, were both teachers, and Alma Thomas and her three younger sisters grew up around the educated adults their parents often entertained, including Booker T. Washington. In 1907, the family moved north to escape the rise of violence against Black Americans in Georgia and settled in Washington, DC. Thomas attended the Armstrong Manual Training High School and, from 1911 to 1913, the Miner Normal School for teacher training. She finished with a certificate to teach kindergarten and took a job in Delaware. In 1921, Thomas returned to DC and enrolled in courses at Howard University, studying home economics with the intent of becoming a costume designer. When James Herring founded the art department at Howard in 1922, Thomas became its first major; two years later, she was also the first to graduate with a BS in fine arts. From 1930 to 1934, Thomas took summer classes ­­at Columbia University Teachers College, earning her master’s in art education. Throughout the 1930s, she continued to work in education and organize community art programs such as the Marionette Club, the School Arts League, and the Junior High School Arts Club. In 1943, Herring and Alonzo Aden founded the Barnett Aden Gallery, and Thomas became its vice president. Dedicated to avant-garde art, Barnett Aden was the first gallery in the nation’s segregated capital to exhibit work by both Black and white artists. In the late 1940s, Thomas became one of the Washington-area artists and art teachers affiliated with the “Little Paris Studio,” a collective started by Loïs Mailou Jones and Céline Tabary that met weekly and organized annual exhibitions. The group became an important venue for African American artists at the time.[ii]\n\nIn the 1950s, Thomas started to develop the method and style that has earned her a place among the most innovative American painters of the twentieth century. She embarked on a decade-long formal study of art at American University and worked with painter Jacob Kainen. Departing from realism, Thomas loosened up her brushwork and began to focus more intently on fields of color. By the late 1950s, she found her voice in abstraction, patterning geometric shapes in rich colors against solid backgrounds. In 1960, at the age of sixty-nine, Thomas retired from teaching to devote her time exclusively to art. That same year, she had her first solo exhibition, at the Dupont Theatre Art Gallery. In 1963, her work was shown in New York City for the first time, at the Artists for CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) exhibition, mounted by the prestigious Martha Jackson Gallery. In 1972, Thomas was given two major solo exhibitions—Alma Thomas at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and Alma W. Thomas: A Retrospective at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC. With Alma Thomas, she became the first African American woman given a one-person show at the Whitney. That same year, the mayor of DC, Walter Washington, declared September 8 to be Alma Thomas Day, and in celebration, local TV and radio stations aired programs about her life and work. She continued to exhibit in group and solo shows throughout the remainder of the decade, and in 1977, her work was included in the Corcoran’s 35th Biennial Exhibition of Contemporary American Painting.\n\n[i] Alma Thomas, as quoted in HE Mahal, “Interviews: Four Afro-American Artists—Approaches to Inhumanity,’ Art Gallery vol. 13, no. 7, April 1970, 36; quoted in Jonathan Binstock, “Apolitical Art in a Political World: Alma Thomas in the Late 1960s and Early 1970s,” Alma W. Thomas: A Retrospective of the Paintings exh. cat. (Fort Wayne, Indiana: Fort Wayne Museum of Art, with Pomegranate Communications, 1998), 63.\n\n[ii] Tritobia Benjamin, The Life and Art of Lois Mailou Jones (New York: Pomegranate Press, 1994), 49 as cited in Catherine Bernard, “Patterns of Change: The Work of Lois Mailou Jones,” 2002, Anyone Can Fly Foundation website. http://www.anyonecanflyfoundation.org/library/Bernard_on_Mailou_Jones\n\n_essay.html#22, accessed October 2012.\n\nThe monumental canvases Thomas created in the 1960s and 1970s were informed by the local abstract movement in DC known as the Washington Color School, which included Morris Louis, Sam Gilliam, and Kenneth Noland. However, her interest in color experimentation aligned her more closely to Josef Albers, Johannes Itten, and Wassily Kandinsky. Inspired by nature, recent discoveries in the sciences, and her own observations of earthly and celestial phenomena, Thomas’s work was devoid of overt political content. Her dedication to abstraction reflected her belief that modern art at its best could transcend political and historical concerns. But her preference for abstract, joyously expressionistic, gestural strokes of vibrant color was not accompanied by a retreat from historical and social realities. The level of Thomas’ success in the 1960s and 1970s meant that she could devote herself exclusively to painting, but she continued to be a passionate advocate of arts education for underserved communities. In addition to her involvement with Artists for CORE, Thomas organized art programs and taught art classes to local youth. In 1975, Howard University honored her with its Alumni of Achievement Award, a recognition of her importance to both the history of art and the local African American communities touched by her considerable talent and dedication as an artist and a teacher.\n\nFor over twenty-five years, Michael Rosenfeld Gallery has championed the work of Alma Thomas, mounting two solo exhibitions: Alma Thomas: Phantasmagoria, Major Paintings from the 1970s (2001) and Alma Thomas: Moving Heaven & Earth, Paintings and Works on Paper, 1958-1978 (2015). The artist was most recently included in the gallery’s group exhibitions Paper Power (2020), Distinctive/Instinctive: Postwar Abstract Painting (2021), and Alternative Worlds (2021).\n\nIn 1998 the Fort Wayne Museum of Art mounted the artist’s first traveling retrospective; eighteen years later, in 2016, The Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College and The Studio Museum in Harlem revisited Thomas’ life work, co-organizing a major survey exhibition and an award-winning monograph that featured new scholarship on her important work and influential legacy. In July 2021, the solo exhibition Alma W. Thomas: Everything Is Beautiful, co-organized by the Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk, VA and The Columbus Museum, Columbus, GA will open at the Chrysler Museum. The show will travel to The Phillips Collection, Washington, DC and The Frist Art Museum, Nashville, TN, before closing at The Columbus Museum in summer 2022. A full-color illustrated catalogue with new scholarship will accompany the exhibition.\n\nThomas’ work has regularly been featured in important historical group exhibitions, most recently appearing in Histórias Afro-Atlânticas, Museu de Arte de São Paulo (MASP) and Instituto Tomie Ohtake, São Paulo, Brazil (2018); Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, NY (2018); Peindre la nuit, Centre Pompidou-Metz, Metz, France (2018); Generations: A History of Black Abstract Art at The Baltimore Museum of Art (2019); Afrocosmologies: American Reflections at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, CT (2019); The Fullness of Color: 1960s Painting at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (2019); Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power organized by the Brooklyn Museum (2018-19); Black Refractions: Highlights from The Studio Museum in Harlem (2021); and African American Art in the 20th Century: Harlem Renaissance, Civil Rights Era, and Beyond, organized by the Smithsonian American Art Museum (2019-21). This year her work may be seen at Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, as part of The Dirty South: Contemporary Art, Material Culture, and the Sonic Impulse (May-September 2021) as well as the Toledo Museum of Art, OH, as part of Supernatural America: The Paranormal in American Art (June-September 2021), organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Art.\n\nWorks by Thomas may be found in the permanent collections of several prominent American institutions, including the Art Institute of Chicago (IL); Baltimore Museum of Art (MD); Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art (Bentonville, AR); Detroit Institute of Arts (MI); Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution (Washington, DC); National Gallery of Art (Washington, DC); The Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, NY); Philadelphia Museum of Art (PA); The Phillips Collection (Washington, DC); Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington, DC); The White House Historical Association; and Whitney Museum of American Art (New York, NY).\n\n1951\n\n1st Annual Exhibition of the Lois Jones & Céline Tabary Studio Group, Inspiration House, Washington, DC\n\n1952\n\n8th Annual Exhibition of Paintings, Sculptures and Prints by Negro Artists, Trevor Arnett Library,\n\nAtlanta University, Atlanta, GA; 1954, 64, 70\n\n1953\n\nDupont Theatre Art Gallery, Washington, DC; 1960\n\n1954\n\nSix Washington Painters, Barnett-Arden Gallery, Washington, DC; 1956, 57, 59, 60\n\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; 1955, 60\n\n1955\n\nCorcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; 1956, 59, 77\n\n1958\n\nContemporary American Paintings, College Arts Traveling Service, Washington, DC\n\nHoward University Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; 1959, 60, 63, 66\n\n1959\n\nHilda Shapiro: Paintings, Sculpture; Alma Thomas: Paintings, Watkins Gallery (now American University Museum, Katzen Arts Center), American University, Washington, DC\n\nSurvey Number One: Visual Metamorphosis in Painting, Howard University Gallery of Art, Howard University, Washington, DC\n\n1960\n\nAmerican Federation of the Arts, Washington, DC\n\n1961\n\nU.S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; 1962, 63\n\nNew Vistas in American Art, Howard University Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\n\n1963\n\nCORE, Martha Jackson Gallery, New York, NY\n\nMargaret Dickey Gallery of Art, Washington, DC\n\n1967\n\nHampton University Institute, Hampton, VA\n\nAmerican Austrian Cultural Society, Washington, DC\n\n1968\n\nEncounters: An Exhibit in Celebration of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bi-Centennial, James B.
