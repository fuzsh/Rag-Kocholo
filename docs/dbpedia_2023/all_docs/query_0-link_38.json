Since 2014, Michael has served as the Gallery Manager at the historic Providence Art Club in Providence, Rhode Island, where he oversees a rigorous exhibition schedule spread across three unique gallery spaces. Under his leadership, the Art Club’s galleries have been recognized as Best Art Gallery in Providence in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In addition to his work at the Club, Michael began an online exhibition program at his website www.michaelrosefineart.com in 2020.\n\nHe also provides advisory services, teaches, and regularly juries and judges exhibitions and competitions. He has spoken at organizations as varied as the RISD Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Bristol Art Museum, and has taught courses in RISD’s Continuing Education Department. A passionate writer, Michael has published essays and reviews in Big Red & Shiny, Art New England, and his own blog, Fine Art Insights. In 2021, he joined the staff of news website GoLocalProv as their art columnist, producing a weekly feature on visual art throughout the State of Rhode Island.\n\nMichael earned his BA in Art History at Providence College, and his Certificate in Art Appraisal at New York University. A sought-after art professional, Michael has a strong audience in the Northeast, as well as throughout the United States and abroad.\n\nThrough August 28, an exhibition at the Attleboro Arts Museum explores the remarkable variety one can find within the work of just eight artists. The show, titled 8 Visions, features photographic collages by Monica DeSalvo, drawings by Craig Elliott, ceramics by Lindsey Epstein, textile-based work by Virginia Mahoney, paintings by Kat Masella and Alexander Morris, photographs by Lisa Redburn and jewelry by Chuck Tramontana. The process for selecting these eight artists began with sixty applications, first juried down to twenty finalists by Jennifer Jean Okumura, with exhibitors selected by Anne Corso and Lauren Riviello. The result is an impressive group that speaks to the richness of style and technique that can be found in the New England art community.\n\nThe show is wonderfully varied and viewers will find captivating details around every corner of the museum’s generous gallery located in the heart of downtown Attleboro. Across a spectrum of media, the exhibition brings out the individuality of the featured artists. The connecting thread is often a distinct interest in texture and surface, be it real or illusion. Particular standouts in the exhibition include the highly tactile drawings and paintings of Craig Elliott and Alexander Morris, the poignant mixed media works of Monica DeSalvo, and quiet photographic triptychs executed by Lisa Redburn.\n\nCraig Elliott, an artist who trained as an architect, exhibits a series of charcoal drawings undergirded with thoughtful design. Included in the exhibition, one finds a collection of diminutive preparatory sketches for Totemic, one of Elliott’s large scale drawings. This gives a deep sense of the artist’s knack for craftsmanship and informs a better appreciation for the completed works on view. The little drawings, though preliminary, are actually quite exquisite and hold their own against the more “finished” works on offer.\n\nWhen telling the story of the local art community in any state, region, or locality, it is important to share a broad scope of what contemporary visual artists are making. Over the last year, here on my website, I have begun developing a program of virtual juried exhibitions to highlight artists from all over the country. When I jury them, I work to pick artworks that are of high quality and that are reflective of what was submitted by applicants. I don’t try to reframe the submissions to suit my own perspective, but rather select a body of work that is both representative and also exciting. On view now through May 7, 2021 at the Providence Art Club, a physical exhibition I helped to organize has the same aims. Namely, that goal is to share a broad view of the community of artists who are at work in the State of Rhode Island today.\n\nThe Rhode Island Community Invitational Exhibition is the first such exhibition held at the Club in recent years. The Galleries of the Providence Art Club have been exhibiting artworks by members as well as non-member artists for over 130 years. Since 1885, the Club’s main gallery has been housed at 11 Thomas Street on picturesque College Hill. In the ensuing decades, it has played host to exhibitions that included the work of artists ranging from Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot to Ellsworth Kelly. Although the Club mounts a popular annual National Open Juried Exhibition and often partners with other organizations to exhibit the work of non-member artists, most of the exhibitions remain member-focused. In recent years we hosted a reciprocal exhibition with a peer arts organization in Boston and displayed a juried scholarship exhibition for Rhode Island college students. The current show was born out of an idea for an exhibition that would allow us to share recent artworks by more of our neighbors from across the State of Rhode Island.\n\nSometime before 2020, I pitched the idea of a Community Invitational Exhibition, in which the Club’s gallery staff could select artists and invite them to exhibit in a diverse group show. Although the pandemic disrupted our plans and our schedules, we were finally able to make this show a reality and it is on view through May 7. I think that the resulting collection of work provides a fun and engaging view into what artists across the state are creating. I thought it might be of interest to artists to know how such a show comes together.\n\nTogether with my gallery colleagues Abba Cudney and Brianna Turner, we assembled a list of well over 100 non-member artists based in Rhode Island with whom we thought we might like to work. In putting together this roster we aimed to list artists who worked in a breadth of media, in a range of styles, who focused on varying themes and who came from all over the small state. As we determined which of the Club’s three galleries we would use for the show, we edited down our list but still invited over 50 artists to be featured in the exhibition. Due to scheduling conflicts and other commitments, a number of invited artists were not able to take part this time so the completed show includes about forty talented artists.\n\nIn the exhibition, viewers can see a cross section of Rhode Island artists are making today. There is realism and abstraction. There are paintings, drawings, prints, and photographs. There is sculpture, glass, and works in ceramic. The featured artists live in towns and cities dotted across the state and come to the exhibition with a wide variety of expertise, education, and unique contributions to the art community. Because artists tend to wear so many hats, the exhibitors on view also have other credentials outside their respective practices. Some are gallery owners or directors, several are teachers or professors, and some are small business owners. Longstanding and mid-career artists are showing alongside younger and emerging art-makers. The exhibition even includes artists who are still studying in undergraduate programs at schools like Rhode Island College and The Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nOne of the benefits of working in a small place like Rhode Island is that everyone knows everyone. As we considered an artist, that individual’s work might lead us to the work of another. There is also the digital happenstance of finding a new artist by accident online while searching for something or someone unrelated. The process of making our list was lively. The tools we used to create our list included both traditional avenues like gallery rosters and past exhibitions we had seen, as well as more novel means like social media. A number of the artists in the show became known to us solely through Instagram.\n\nWith our list of prospective artists assembled, we invited each participant to pick one artwork they were most excited to exhibit. Some artists asked for our feedback or gave us a choice between three or four equally lovely paintings. Others decisively sent us their submission within hours of being invited. All of the works submitted are of high quality and the entire collection works together very well. There are points of visual comparison and overlap as well as of difference and opposition. It has the feeling of a competitive national exhibition, even though every artist is based in Rhode Island.\n\nWhen installing this Community Invitational, we thought carefully about sizes, media, and the potential aesthetic connections between seemingly divergent objects. We anchored walls with large works and then built collections of more intimately scaled items around them. In the corners of the historic gallery, we highlighted some of the fantastic three-dimensional pieces that were submitted. Across the exhibition, we worked to pair items in order to help viewers gain a better appreciation for each individual piece. The result is a cohesive show in which viewers can spend a long time looking at a plethora of great items.\n\nI am pleased with the outcome for our first Rhode Island Community Invitational and feel that it captures a snapshot of some of the exciting things being made in Rhode Island now by a wide range of artists. I am personally very grateful to all the exhibitors who, on very short notice, pulled from their inventories to provide us with a stunning array of visual art.\n\nSo far, the feedback I’ve received has been quite positive, with participating artists and gallery guests marveling at the multifaceted exhibition. In viewing this show I hope that visitors will chart their own visual connections across the works presented. Hopefully, too, viewers will discover the work of local artists who they might not otherwise know.\n\nI enjoyed working on this special exhibition and hope that those who come to see it gain a deeper appreciation for the fine works of art being made in their community by their friends, acquaintances, and by those neighbors who they have not yet met.\n\nThe Rhode Island Community Invitational Exhibition is on view in the Maxwell Mays Gallery at the Providence Art Club through May 7. The show is open to the public Sundays - Fridays 12-4pm each day and admission is always free. For information on this show, you can contact me at the Art Club via email at michael@providenceartclub.org, or by phone at 401-331-1114 x 5.\n\nRohm, a longtime professor at The University of Rhode Island, was an maker steeped in craft, an educator with a giving character, and an artist unparalleled in his capacity to examine structure through unassuming materials. Whereas predecessors like Bernini sculpted in marble, Rohm preferred rope, lead, encaustic, wood, and rebar. These components are used and reused, resulting in cohesive ties binding the far flung aesthetics of differing bodies of work.\n\nThe earliest objects in the exhibition were produced in the heady days of 1960’s conceptualism. The show opens with a rough hewn kinetic work in wood and moves into Rohm’s notable rope sculptures. The enormous rope work, Untitled May 16th, 1969, engages an entire wall but is constructed of simple Manila rope. Exhibited at The Whitney Museum alongside the likes of Carl Andre and Eva Hesse, the piece consists of a sixteen foot tall by twenty-two foot wide grid of two foot squares. Nailed to the wall, the work is based on the interplay between construction and disruption. When Rohm released several of the identical knots from their nails on the wall, the overwhelming grid began to give way and to dive into the viewer’s space. In Down to Earth, viewers see a reconstruction of this work executed to the exacting standards of the artist. This activation of the artist’s original intent is an essential element of conceptual art.\n\nIn later works, Rohm explored familiar figurative forms made up of materials like rebar and encaustic. This series is spookily fleshy and corporeal. In one piece, Untitled (Large Cascade), from 1996, a massive hand balances on a lone finger as its iridescent blue surface disintegrates into the sketchy contours of digits shaped in metal mesh. Hands and fingers are a reappearing motif in this group, as are shapely torsos and mantle-like forms empty of bodies. Limbs flexed and tense, or still and resolute shoulders, or a cupped palm, are all fashioned out of elements which could be procured from the hardware store. Rohm was able to play with material, with form, with the tensions between subject and object, in ways that reward the viewer who takes the time to look closely.\n\nA grouping of tables, described in exhibition text as “Platonic work benches”, shows off Rohm’s taste for material as well as his wry sense of humor. Leaden wheels and sleigh runners serve as feet on two such tables, while another is ankle deep in metal buckets. Overhead, shop lights dangle to illuminate mysterious objects. The whole series is a sampler of sketches in the type of craftsmanship Rohm enjoyed. These benches are strangely personified, totemic, and even altarlike. In one table, the viewer is invited to look through a glass surface into a void below which is shaped in the outline of a basilica or cathedral. Architectural forms undergird crafted objects. The hard lines of this series counterbalance the soft and amorphous edges of other sculptures on view.\n\nAlmost a quarter of the space is dedicated to a series of columns, all using rebar in one form or another. In this group, objects within cages seem to defy gravity, with the hand-formed metal canopies being the only thing to stop encaustic balloons from floating away into the cavernous space above them. These works are all about verticality, but also are almost leaden in their weighty footings. They are also largely transparent, with voids between rebar acting as windows onto still other sculptures beyond. Both solid and punctured, they are firmly clung to the ground but aspire to be aloft. The sense of the totemic object found in Rohm’s tables might be noticed here as well, as might a sense of the ceremonial.\n\nRohm’s production was singular, but while early works correlate to those of co-exhibitors like Andre and Hesse, some later objects reflect the sensitivity for materials more common in a different contemporary like Martin Puryear. Rohm and Puryear overlapped for a period and the warmly tactile quality found in Rohm’s work can also be seen in Puryear’s. Finding such stylistic connections between divergent artists is one of the delights of this exhibition.\n\nRohm was in command of an array of sculptural techniques, but also made enviable drawings. Throughout the exhibition, there is a smattering of works on paper by the artist which are nearly as obsessively textured as the surfaces of his encaustic-covered forms. Recurring objects like pianos, lightbulbs, or the jagged map of Rhode Island appear in these two dimensional pieces. They are lively and colorful. In two-dimensions, they express the same knack for specificity and exactitude that one sees in the artist’s three-dimensional work.\n\nTo close out the exhibition, a separate gallery features stage sets the artist created as well as intricate and beautiful maquettes. Rohm used these as the basis for many of his projects, some of which are on view in the exhibition. These tiny alter egos are so fantastically detailed that they could be mistaken for their full size counterparts. Here, macabre subject matter works itself out. Little gibbeted and dismembered figures that recall Goya are examples of such imagery. In another maquette, a window looks onto a winch, where a coiled rope appears on the verge of snapping. Another small sculpture features an electric chair. The tension in these small works is as intense as that in the full scale objects nearby.\n\nIf Rhode Island named a Sculptor Laureate, it is almost certain that Howard Ben Tré would have held the mantle. The artist, who passed away in June of 2020 at the age of 71, was one of the most significant contemporary artists to call the state home. Sure, many notables have passed through the doors of institutions like RISD only to disappear into New York or Los Angeles, with their local connections appearing merely as a footnote on their resume. For Ben Tré, however, many of his most productive years were had in the Ocean State and his final studio was housed in a modest industrial building in Pawtucket. On view through March 7, 2021 at The WaterFire Arts Center, an engaging exhibition captures Howard Ben Tré’s important legacy, a fitting tribute to an international artist who made his home in Rhode Island.\n\nBen Tré was born in Brooklyn and his dedication to the craft of making objects can be traced back to his carpenter father. The artist’s dad studied at Cooper Hewitt before serving in the Second World War, but was denied the dream of being an artist out of a necessity to provide for his family. Ben Tré gained experience in the way many young people do, tinkering in his father’s shop and receiving a first hand apprenticeship in a more or less industrial setting. This dual beginning, which included a dedication to craft and an admiration for industriousness, has been noted as an influence that remained throughout his career. After spending formative years focused on political activism, he earned his undergraduate degree at Portland State University in Oregon before traveling back east with his family to pursue an MFA at RISD under the auspices of Dale Chihuly.\n\nFor many graduates, Providence is a way post, but Ben Tré made it his base. The apex of his storied vocation as an artist coincided with the ambitious 1990’s renaissance of Rhode Island’s capitol city, which saw rail lines rerouted and rivers uncovered, transforming a mostly derelict downtown into a markedly more vibrant place. In those days, city leaders threw their lot behind the arts as a key engine driving urban rebirth, with the installation work WaterFire coming to the fore as an essential element of the city’s new identity as a creative hub. For this reason, it seems appropriate that The WaterFire Arts Center is hosting Private Visions, Public Ideals – The Legacy of Howard Ben Tré, a truly stunning exhibition charting the significance of Ben Tré’s output.\n\nRhode Islanders are spoiled to have a number of Ben Tré works accessible in important public places. In 1996, he installed his Bearing Figure at the gateway to the Rhode Island Convention Center, one of the key landmarks in the overhaul of Providence. His BankBoston Plaza design, from 1998, offers a soothing oasis at the city’s densest crossroads. At the RISD Museum, Mantled Figure, completed in 1993, greets visitors who arrive through the Benefit Street entrance. Other projects were sited at Brown University, Wheeler School, and Hasbro Children’s Hospital. In November 2020, the Newport Art Museum unveiled a new installation of Ben Tré’s 2010 sculpture Two Capped as part of their campus renovation project. In short, examples of his work are ample here, but this exhibition puts a fine point on the best characteristics of his production, while helping local viewers to assemble a more cohesive understanding of an artist whose innovative techniques and global reach they may not fully appreciate.\n\nPrivate Visions, Public Ideals captures the artist’s contributions to the realm of sculpture, to the technique of casting glass, and to the idea of public art itself. Shown off in the cavernous central hall of The WaterFire Arts Center, one will find an array of pieces that exhibit both creative process and artistic product. Maquettes of unrealized projects are paired with models for public plazas that were completed and are still being enjoyed by neighborhoods some twenty years on. Videos give visitors insights into Ben Tré’s background, his technical acumen, and his way of seeing. It is an engaging show, and one that poses a rare and excellent opportunity for guests to view a broad collection of work all in one place. As a bonus, the end of the exhibition space hosts an imposing array of monolithic moving crates, testifying to the complex art-handling necessary for works like these. This is an aspect of the art trade few gallery goers get to see, but one that is the specialty of the late artist’s wife, Wendy MacGaw, who worked with WaterFire staff to organize the exhibition alongside longtime Ben Tré patron Dr. Joseph Chazan.\n\nBen Tré had a magpie-like ability to collect ideas from wide-ranging sources, from the ancient world to contemporary spirituality. The creative innovations he found in glass casting made his ideas, which occasionally verged on the utopic, a reality for all to enjoy. Part figurative, part totemic, and seemingly able to speak across time, his forms are minimal and essential, but also thrillingly alive. Repeating patterns can occasionally be found but perhaps the most direct is that of the glass form seemingly belted with metal, creating cinctures that underscore their medium-bending enormity and curvaceousness. Other exquisite details include bubbles frozen in the interior of the solid glass, cracks and striations that enliven their surfaces, and the incandescent quality they acquire in the bright sunlight. They reward close looking. And in the magnificent space of The WaterFire Arts Center, the next best thing to being outside, Ben Tré’s sculptures sing.\n\nThere is a sensuous quality to the works on display, something that invites the viewer to engage with them. It takes restraint to not run a hand along their cool surfaces. While Ben Tré’s work has a timeless beauty, it is also couched in the buoyant Postmodernism of the 1980’s and 90’s, one that imagined a kind of public art that could be transformational for the good. In his commissions for public spaces, the artist sought to make this dream a reality. One section of the exhibition is dedicated to the conceptualization and unveiling of BankBoston Plaza in downtown Providence, a case study in how the artist labored to improve common areas of city living.\n\nThis large-scale installation, completed in 1998, includes, as many of Ben Tré’s projects did, several independent vignettes within a cohesive whole. First, a tall urn-like fountain encircled with high-backed benches, then undulating sets of seating that double as planters for a miniature grove of trees, and finally a wall-based installation and water feature. This work activated the urban core and gave a place of respite to the workers toiling in the surrounding high-rises. It brought the quintessential quietness and introspection of Ben Tré’s work to the center of the hustle and bustle. In doing so, it became a stage set against which the drama of urban life could be muted and tamed. After seeing the exhibition on Valley Street, visitors should travel downtown to see this site-specific work in order to feel, first hand, how objects like those on view in a contemporary art exhibition can translate to real life usefulness.\n\nComing away from Private Visions, Public Ideals, it is difficult not to appreciate the wide-ranging qualities of an artist like Howard Ben Tré. To create the oeuvre attributed to him, he recognized the need to build a team of dedicated collaborators in a variety of fields. He was equal parts creator, innovator, engineer, partner, diplomat, translator, and the list must go on. These are skills that go beyond those of a single-minded artist and towards ones associated with a creative visionary. Through his art he brought together talented craftspeople and industry professionals to make work that often served their counterparts in the more rarified environments of offices, apartments, and cities. Not to mention works that are appreciated in museum collections around the globe. These interconnected linkages between the artist, his extended studio, and the world, are important ones and they are as much on display in this exhibition as Ben Tré’s elegant glass and metal sculptures.\n\nIt is indisputable that Howard Ben Tré will be remembered for his remarkable legacy, both in Rhode Island and far beyond its little borders. And in the years to come, this exhibition too will rightly be seen as a key work itself, thoughtfully and beautifully documenting the life and the creations of a uniquely visionary man.\n\nPrivate Visions, Public Ideals is on view at The WaterFire Arts Center at 475 Valley Street in Providence through March 7. The exhibition is free and open to the public Wednesday - Sunday 10:00am - 5:00pm. Masks are required and guest temperatures are taken upon arrival.

And it lead some to speculate that partisan officials were plotting to push the selection of an artist who would exhibit work that represented Trump at the expense of artistic quality. Thankfully, that was not the case and a few days ago it was announced that Martin Puryear would create new pieces for the United States Pavilion at one of the most important events in the international art world. Puryear is in many ways the perfect choice to represent the United States in 2019, with a decades-long body of work that is an effective foil to the Trumpian zeitgeist.\n\nThe 77-year-old Puryear, a native of Washington DC, earned his undergraduate degree in Fine Art from the Catholic University of America in 1963 and holds an MFA from Yale. He served in the Peace Corps in Sierra Leone and studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts as well. He has been featured in the Whitney Biennial three times. MoMA, SFMoMA, MoMA Fort Worth, and the National Gallery collaborated on a traveling retrospective of his work. The recipient of both a MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" and a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, Puryear received the Gold Medal in Sculpture from the National Academy of Arts in 2007. He was awarded the country's highest honor for artists, the National Medal of Arts, in 2011 by President Obama. In short, Martin Puryear has the pedigree of an artist who should be featured at the Venice Biennale.\n\nPuryear is also multi-talented. He is primarily a sculptor, but has also created furniture, tools, and other non-art objects. His work is often large scale and regularly commissioned for the public sphere. In 2014 he unveiled his Slavery Memorial on the campus of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The work takes the form of a half-buried ball and chain. The ball emerges from the ground as a bronze dome with a chain jutting towards the sky where it terminates in a broken link. At the breakage, the chain is polished to a mirror finish, reflecting the sky and trees above. On a granite plinth nearby, a plaque displays a text remarking on the ways in which Brown University profited from the international slave trade and the unpaid labor of Africans and African-Americans. It is an incisive and moving piece that calls to account for historic wrongs committed by the University that commissioned it.\n\nBooker T. Washington was one of the most prominent thinkers of his generation. An advisor to Presidents Roosevelt and Taft, Washington advocated for African-Americans in a variety of ways but suggested that through industrious pursuits they could improve their own opportunities in the United States. This idea made him the intellectual counterbalance to other intellectuals like W.E.B. Dubois, who sought political routes and protested to broaden civil rights for African-Americans. Puryear's Ladder for Booker T. Washington suggests the winding road of progress that comes with proposed self-improvement. It also reflects the idea of the sometimes-apocryphal \"American Dream\" in which raising one's own status through labor and entrepreneurship would allow for a rise up the societal ladder.\n\nIn this piece, Puryear punctures Washington's arguments by suggesting the fraught nature of self-improvement for groups of people who are systematically disadvantaged by the political structures of their society. Puryear ironically utilizes his own skills and industriousness to undermine the idea that these qualities alone can change the course of an individual life. The work is quintessentially American and plays on many preconceptions about American life. It is a great expression, not only of an idea about African-American history, but also of the experience of a broad swath of the American public. It successfully combines craft and concept to educate and inform viewers.\n\nIn another large scultpure, Big Phrygian (2010 - 2014), exhibited at Matthew Marks Gallery in 2015, Puryear uses painted red cedar to created a monolithic version of the Phrygian Cap which was worn historically to denote liberation. During the French Revolution les sans-culottes often donned le bonnet rouge as an additional sartorial statement of their ardor for liberté. The use of such headgear to mark free men in the eighteenth century is likely a bastardization of the pileus, another type of hat, which in antiquity was the sign of a manumitted slave. Re-contextualized for the American scene, Puryear's Phrygian suggests the incomplete work towards emancipation, justice, and a liberal society. Through this comparison between American democracy, Revolutionary France, and their ancient antecedents, Puryear comments on the veracity of claims about American exceptionalism. His cap is impractically enormous, not meant to don a head, but to demarcate space.\n\nFor both his exceptional skill and his exquisite use of sculptural craft to evoke American historical and political realities, Puryear is not only a justly respected American artist, he is a fantastic choice to represent his fellow Americans in Venice. He will also be the second consecutive African-American artist to be featured in the Biennale's United States Pavilion. It is fitting, too, that his work in Venice will be commissioned by the Madison Square Park Conservancy, which recently collaborated with Puryear on his Big Bling installation. The Park's Deputy Director and Senior Curator Brooke Kamin Rapaport will spearhead the project, representing New York's cosmopolitan tastes on a global stage.\n\nMadison Square Park was notably the site of the installation of the Statue of Liberty's flame bearing arm from 1876 - 1882 as fundraisers sought to publicize the donation of the sculpture from the French in order to pay for its base. It is appropriate that in our current political climate, a craftsman, an African-American, an artist who has commented on the American experience through his work, should show the world what Americans are thinking and making now. And it is interesting that the patron of this work will be New York City, one of our nation's most open, most liberal, most international metropolises.\n\nWhatever Puryear creates for the 2019 Venice Biennale will bear the mark of his singular sculptural acumen, and it will also certainly share the very best of American culture with our neighbors around the world.\n\nAdditional Resources to Learn about Martin Puryear:\n\nPuryear's Interview with Art21 Regarding Ladder for Booker T. Washinton (2003)\n\nNational Endowment for the Humanities Essay on Ladder for Booker T. Washington\n\nMatthew Marks Gallery Martin Puryear Exhibition (2015) Online Catalogue\n\nAnnouncement on Puryear's Biennale work via the Madison Square Park Conservancy\n\nHyperalleric's Overview of Puryear's Career\n\nJustine Hill (b. 1985) is a Brooklyn-based painter who, in her own words, \"collages different ways of making marks to accomplish a desired texture, color, or opacity for each form. Most marks are made from paint, crayon, pencil or pastel. The final painting is simply a composite of these varied marks and based on their formation can behave as animated creature or moving environments.\"\n\nHill's current solo exhibition, Freestanding, on view at Denny Gallery on New York's Lower East Side, shows off the range of her considerable technical capabilities and the breadth of her vision. Her lively and vibrant paintings are made up of shaped, canvas-covered panels. Layers of texture and color are built up within each shaped form, which are assembled together to create complete objects. The formal elements of each unit in Hill's paintings bounce off one another, resulting in a rich and varied interplay within, without, and between her cutout panels. The work is also full of energy; producing the occasional hallucinatory vibration. Hill's paintings are, in short, exciting.\n\nTo paraphrase Denny Gallery's description of the show, the objective of Hill's exhibition is to explore how her paintings can reassert themselves in space, reacquire their background, and become “freestanding”. The show succeeds in every regard. Through her considerate use of line, color, layer, and texture, Hill transforms the viewer's understanding of her shaped supports. In some instances, the painted surface underscores a preconceived notion about the form below. In others, the surface seemingly rebels against its own panel. Hill's work keeps the audience guessing, and the details of her paintings are transfixing.\n\nThe strengths of Hill's work are in the rigorous thinking that underpins them. She explores and re-explores the potentials and drawbacks of shape, of line, of content. Her marks are at once practiced and improvisational, but always very purposeful. By utilizing traditional formal elements of construction in novel ways and by undermining or second-guessing their usefulness, the artist engages with the history of the artform. In her work Hill interrogates the very medium of painting to dazzling effect.\n\nThe works on view are full of lively interactions between God and his holy courtiers. These are underscored by Angelico's eye for the humanity of his subjects, which gives them a vitality remarkable for the time. Each reliquary is also imbued with a sense of humor. Looking closely one can find a waiting angel with hands on hips, or St. Peter looking over his shoulder at the viewer. There are a few moments in which saintly observers of heavenly sights turn to the on-looker and invite them closer into the scene, fulfilling their traditional intercessory role.\n\nIn 1899, when Isabella Stewart Gardner purchased Angelico's Assumption and Dormition of The Virgin (1424-1434) it was the first piece by the artist to come to the United States. Gardner and her contemporaries were no doubt drawn to Angelico's work due to his technical virtuosity and the timeless beauty of his paintings. In bringing this stunning object to Boston, Gardner added to her own esteem as a collector with a refined eye. She also set the stage for viewers to encounter Fra Angelico's vision of the divine.\n\nThis exhibition is a rare and wonderful opportunity not only to see the Gardner's Angelico reunited with its peer reliquaries from Florence, but also to see these works in relation to the Gardner Museum's extensive and eclectic holdings. By viewing Gardner's collection in her original \"Fenway Court\" and carefully looking at the works in Heaven on Earth, visitors will not only gain an understanding of the connoisseurship that compelled Isabella to buy her Fra Angelico. They will come away with a sense of the deep faith and spirituality that drove the artist to create it in the first place."
