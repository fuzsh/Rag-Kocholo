        "text": "BEIRUT, LEBANON - For a generation of Arabs, Moustapha Akkad’s historical epics became cultural icons the same way Star Wars did in the West.\n\nMr. Akkad was best known in the United States as the executive producer and driving force behind the Halloween horror movie series. But in the Arab world, he was known as the director of two much-admired films: a history of Islam and the story of a Libyan nationalist leader.\n\nMr. Akkad, 72, died Friday from injuries he sustained in one of the suicide bombings that struck western hotels Wednesday in Amman, the Jordanian capital. The filmmaker and his daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, 34, were attending a wedding reception at the Radisson SAS Hotel. She died Wednesday night, leaving behind a husband and two small children. Mr. Akkad, who was divorced, also had three sons.\n\nHours after his death was announced, one Arab satellite channel broadcast his most famous movie, The Message, a sweeping history of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad. Released in 1976, the three-hour film gained a wide audience in the Arab world because of its sophisticated production and cinematography. The movie cost $17 million – a huge investment for a film at that time.\n\nBorn in Syria, Mr. Akkad moved to Los Angeles at age 18 to study filmmaking.\n\nHe worked as a producer at various studios before starting his own production company in the early 1970s. After he spent years raising funds to make The Message, he turned to horror films to help finance his other interests."
