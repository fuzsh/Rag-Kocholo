        "text": "King David Hotel: the day Zionist terrorism struck the British Government. 22nd July 1946, 350 kilograms of explosives were detonated at the bottom of the King David Hotel. this was the headquarters of the British administration for what was at the time, mandatory Palestine. World War 2 had officially ended but a Zionist terrorist group known as the Irgun had placed the explosives in the basement of the hotel. The Irgun's targets were not just Palestinians but also the British government, who they saw as illegal occupiers of their Zionist land. Without warning, the group detonated a smaller bomb further up the street which caused a passing coach to roll over and people to flee the scene and the nearest part of the hotel to the explosion, towards the South-West corner of the hotel. Including the coach passengers who had entered the hotel to seek safety and treatment after the first blast. In an attack reminiscent of the Omagh bombing by the IRA, at 12:37pm they detonated the hotel bomb, which collapsed the whole South West Corner of the King David Hotel (see first comment for picture). Killing 91 people: * 41 Arabs * 28 British citizens (including government officials) * 17 Jews * 2 Armenians * 1 Russian * 1 Greek * 1 Egyptian The Irgun was an offshoot of the Zionist paramilitary group Hagana, in much the same way as ISIS grew out of Al-Qaida in Iraq. ISIS considers themselves the most moral army in the world. That's no typo. Because after the establishment of the stage of Israel in 1948, the Irgun were not disbanded. The constitutional agreement first defined the Israeli Defence Force. Subsuming all military and paramilitary organisations into one. Bringing all Zionist terrorist arms together under one umbrella. So when people talk \"the terrorist, Zionist settler colonial state\" the definition of \"terrorist\" includes that history. in essence, the IDF is identical to the Muslim Brotherhood and the government of Israel is fundamentally like the Taliban in Afghanistan. Highlighting the hypocrisy of identical contexts in British and American foreign policy. The West just pays money to the terrorist organisation it prefers most. While helping further their cause and remove the others.\n\n\"We created ISIS. We created the Terrorists\" Good morning everyone. Thank you so much, Manoj, for posting the Paul Williams video. William was the main antiterror Consultant and Ex FBI official. Listen to the Video. Then, I know that what I’m going to say might be crazy for lots of people or they would think that this is insane, but as the video of the US FBI expert is saying that most of the radical extremist fundamental Muslim armed groups, including ISIS that have said committed the attack on Moscow, well most of these groups are made in the US, financed by the US, commanded by the US, and directed by the US. Why? Because the US government wants to appear clean and respectful for human rights, so they create those groups to create wars and conflict in the regions. The US do not like or want to invade and destroy. So they create a substitute from inside the countries. Why creating Muslim groups? Because the target is to show that Islam is a violent religion and Muslims are barbarians. Why? Because Muslims are fighting the Americans and the Israelis to free their lands in Palestine, in Syria, in Iraq, in Egypt, and in Somalia. So there’s nothing smarter and more interesting, and convincing more than to show that those Muslims are barbarians, and that the US have the right to kill them. And like that, the world will not sympathize or support the Muslim countries or the Muslim societies. I know that lots of people might not be convinced by what I am writing, but maybe they have to look at the American official speech in the video. Another thing that I’m proposing to my readers and want to let them think about it. Do you think that a nation or people like the Muslims, people like them have in their religion and their belief A welcome that says: As-Salamu Alaikum, means \"Peace be on you from God with his mercy and attention\". This is the belief of the Muslims, and that is mentioned in the Quran. Also, tell me, do you think that people that say \"Hello\" by saying \"peace on you and mercy and attention\", do you think that those peoples can be murders and terrorists? Second idea to my readers, is that the first verse of the Quran that the Americans and the Israelis and some Europeans are saying that it is a violent book, the first verses of the Quran says: “In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful”. Do you think that such a book that begins by the words of \"Grace\" and \"Mercy\" from God, do you think that this book will be violent? I urge normal people not to believe the American propaganda, and the media that is brainwashing our minds. And finally, I’m wishing you all peace, love, affection, mercy, and all the grace that you can find in the beauty of this world. Live always with serenity and be happy. As-Salamu Alaikum, peace, and mercy accompany you."
