        "text": "This year the BBC celebrates a century at the forefront of British broadcasting and media. Beginning with radio and then inaugurating the “world’s first regular high-definition public TV service” in 1936, the BBC has been a pioneer from its beginnings to today.\n\nAs the original British public service broadcaster, the BBC has strived to adhere to the core principles stated by its first director general, John Reith, to “inform, educate, entertain”, while also making (and breaking) its own rules. In celebration of this, we at the BFI have been considering those televisual turning points from the BBC that have helped to shape social attitudes, remake genres and transform television itself. In short, those programmes that were truly ‘gamechanging’.\n\nSo what constitutes a gamechanger?\n\nThese are the shows that revolutionised the broadcasting landscape by defining and developing entire genres; here is the creative talent that broke ground to represent diverse communities across the UK in new and meaningful ways; these are the programmes whose impact changed social attitudes by challenging the status quo; and the technological landmarks that shaped how we watch television today.\n\nWe considered TV that had a transformative impact, like the BBC’s natural history programming, which has enhanced our understanding of our world, and drama strands like The Wednesday Play whose Cathy Come Home influenced social attitudes to homelessness. We included technological landmarks like the outside broadcast of the Queen’s coronation in 1953, which heralded the arrival of television as the nation’s chosen medium. And we looked at the history of how underrepresented communities have been depicted on BBC TV through programmes like Empire Road, The Buddha of Suburbia and The Chinese Detective.\n\nGuiding all of our thinking was the need to represent the remarkable range of the BBC’s programming. So, while landmark dramas such as I May Destroy You and Z Cars are included, so too are lifestyle programmes such as Gardeners’ World, entertainment such as Strictly Come Dancing, arts programmes like Monitor, music shows like Top of the Pops, pioneering current affairs programmes such as Panorama, and, of course, the BBC’s essential programming for children, from Sooty to Something Special.\n\nThis list has been shaped by contributors from across the BFI, who nominated titles for consideration to a core team of BFI curators and programmers, who then honed the list to the 100 programmes below. Contributors include curators, programmers, archivists, technical experts and many others – thanks to all of them for their passion and love of telly. We fiercely debated the importance of each title and, inevitably, had to lose some beloved favourites along the way.\n\nBut everything on this list has earned its place as a true television gamechanger and is a testament to the BBC’s vital output. Most of all, we’re excited to see how these gamechangers of the BBC’s first 100 years will influence and shape the programmes that come next.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n1. Television Comes to London (1936)\n\nThe first British television documentary, showing the birth of television broadcasting at Alexandra Palace.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nHere it is, the beginning of television in Britain! Though not strictly a programme, Television Comes to London is a newsreel which was made to document the construction of BBC television studios at Alexandra Palace and the opening night of BBC television in November 1936. It shows the rival Baird and Marconi-EMI broadcasting systems being trialled at the time, and a range of BBC staff installing equipment, testing cameras and preparing for transmission.\n\nFew glimpses of early television survive, because programmes were broadcast live and there was no way of recording them. This newsreel, which was shot on film and later shown on television, provided a means of capturing the day for posterity as well as celebrating the opening of the television service. When the moment of live broadcast arrives in the documentary, actor Adele Dixon sings a song composed for the occasion extolling the “magic rays of light that bring television to you”. Television Comes to London reminds us that the ‘magic’ of TV was then, as it is now, a result of hard work behind the scenes.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n2. Ballet Negres (1946)\n\nExcerpts from the repertoire of Europe’s first Black dance company, the Ballet Negres, presented with live music.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIn between news reports and sports programmes, the mid-1940s BBC broadcast music and dance performances, some of which formed the emerging cutting-edge of British postwar art. This programme, broadcast before the Windrush period of migration from the Caribbean, features Europe’s first Black dance company.\n\nThe broadcast was gamechanging in more than one way: the BBC were giving a platform to new dance and also to young creatives. The pioneering dance company was founded by two young Jamaican dancers (Berto Pasuka and Richie Riley); the programme presenter was the performer, filmmaker and broadcaster, Trinidadian Edric Connor.\n\nBehind the camera the programme gives us a window into the creative collaborations happening in postwar London. Composer Leonard Salzedo was known for working across the young UK dance scene. He was later principal conductor for the Scottish Ballet and even scored Hammer films. For him to score multiple Ballet Negres works, which portrayed scenes of African Caribbean folklore and traditions, demonstrates the cross-cultural possibilities for artists of the time. The musicians, the West African Rhythm Brothers, were in high demand in London’s nightclubs with their song in the Yoruba language, ‘Egbe Mi’.\n\nFor audiences, British ballet was still taking its early steps – from the first British ballet performances (Frederick Ashton’s ‘A Tragedy of Fashion’) in 1926 to becoming popular as a homefront entertainment in wartime – and there was still creative space for new types of movement in the homegrown ballet form. Ballet Negres’ repertory included scenes that feel modern. What we might now identify as contemporary movement, Pasuko, Riley and the BBC were comfortable badging as ballet.\n\n– Arike Oke\n\n3. BBC Proms (1947-)\n\nA carnival of music made possible by BBC ingenuity.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nHenry Wood, the father of the Proms, wanted to “bring the greatest classical music to the widest possible audience” – a sentiment that chimed beautifully with Reithian values. The Henry Wood Promenade Concerts predate BBC broadcasting and made concert recitals popular by offering low-price tickets and allowing food and drink (and cigarettes) in to the Queen’s Hall where they took place. The Proms first joined forces with the BBC in the late 1920s; in 1941 they moved to the Royal Albert Hall after the blitz, and in 1947 the television broadcasts began. The BBC has always maintained the founding principles of the Proms (standing tickets for ‘Promenaders’ are still cheap), and their broadcasts have broadened the popularity of classical music in Britain.\n\nThe annual festival of classical music has provided the perfect test bed for innovations in broadcast technology. Stereo transmissions, HDTV, the digital terrestrial Red Button and binaural sound have all been tested at the Proms. But more than anything else, the television broadcasts have given the nation the chance to see world-class musicians, singers and conductors performing live in their living room, a feat that paved the way for everything from Live Aid to the BBC’s coverage of Glastonbury.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n4. The Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (1953)\n\nEpic and ambitious live coverage of the Queen’s coronation.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nA defining moment in the history of broadcasting. By far the most ambitious television outside-broadcast attempted up to this point, the coronation coverage marked a turning point in the attitude of people towards the medium of television, as it proved TV could relay a massive state occasion as competently as radio. The 1937 coronation had also been televised, but in less grand fashion and with no access to Westminster Abbey. This time, tellingly, cameras were allowed inside the abbey to capture the actual ancient ritual of the crowning itself.\n\nAlthough only 2.3 million home sets were in operation at the time, it was estimated that 20 million people in the UK alone watched the broadcast, crowded around home sets or in public places. It was thought to be the first time the TV audience outnumbered the radio audience for any event. The near seven-hour broadcast was also relayed live to France, Holland and West Germany, and a copy was flown across the Atlantic the same day and broadcast immediately. The success of the technologically dazzling broadcast accelerated the sales of television sets across the nation. Almost overnight, television had come of age.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n5. The Quatermass Experiment (1953)\n\nProfessor Quatermass’s experimental space rocket returns to Earth with two of its crew missing and the third infected by an alien organism.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThere had been science fiction on British television before Quatermass – various stagings of Karel Capek’s robot comedy R.U.R. had been aired since the late 1930s, for example. But Nigel Kneale’s The Quatermass Experiment was the first to really hit the mark with viewers. Tales of streets emptying when it was broadcast have inevitably been oversold (there weren’t that many television sets around at the time, and the viewing figures were good but represented only a fraction of the population), but there was no denying the considerable impact the serial had on those who did see it.\n\nThis was grown-up sci-fi of a kind that had been seen in the early examples of the American sci-fi film boom of the 1950s, but which was rare on the small screen at the time. Intelligent, clever and popular enough to warrant a pair of sequels, it was the start of a whole new strain of British television drama, the effects of which would be felt in shows like Doctor Who, Out of the Unknown, Survivors and many more. And the big-screen adaptation in 1955 effectively launched Hammer Films down the road that would lead to their much-loved gothic horrors.\n\n– Kevin Lyons\n\nWhat’s left of The Quatermass Experiment (just two episodes of the live broadcast were recorded) are included with follow-ups Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958) in a box set issued by 2Entertain in 2005.\n\nFind out more\n\nWhere to begin with Nigel Kneale\n\nA beginner’s path through the hauntological horrors of screenwriter Nigel Kneale.\n\nBy Adam Scovell\n\nWhere to begin with Nigel Kneale\n\n6. Panorama (1953-)\n\nBritish television’s longest-running current affairs programme.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nPanorama started life as a magazine-style programme featuring different sections relating to news and current affairs, but over its first decade developed into a home for harder-edged investigative journalism. With the formidable Richard Dimbleby at the helm between 1955 and 1965, it became a trusted source for in-depth reporting.\n\nIts thoughtful, even-handed approach sometimes attracted criticisms that it was staid and ‘worthy’ – especially when compared to the lively fast-paced new ITV current affairs programmes This Week and World in Action. But it transcended such criticisms and has become a rock in the schedules, delivering long-form documentary programmes week after week for nearly 70 years.\n\nControversy surrounded a 1995 edition featuring an interview with Princess Diana when – on the 25th anniversary of its broadcast – evidence of dubious practices surrounding the interview came to light. An independent review found that the interview was secured by deception and breached BBC rules. The series continued to break headline-making stories, with editions covering sex crimes at the Vatican, abuse in care homes, illegal dealings at FIFA and the Omagh bombings. We should also mention that, with its famous 1957 spoof report on the ‘spaghetti harvest’ failure in Italy, Panorama began the long tradition of TV April Fool jokes.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n7. Zoo Quest (1954 to 1963)\n\nA BBC team accompany experts from London Zoo as they travel in search of live specimens for the zoo.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nLondon Zoo’s suggestion of getting a BBC crew to record their trip in search of (initially) snakes inadvertently started a whole new genre of television. Equally importantly, the series introduced David Attenborough as a wildlife reporter. Up until that time, wild animals featured on television were brought into the studio from captivity – the idea of filming exotic species on location was considered impractical by the BBC because of the bulky nature of the 35mm cameras. Attenborough and his team asked their paymasters to let them use lightweight 16mm cameras, and despite misgivings that they produced inferior pictures, they eventually agreed.\n\nThe films they brought back proved hugely popular with the audience, neatly combining fascination with education. Over the ensuing years the team travelled to relatively lesser-seen locations such as Madagascar, New Guinea, Guiana and Borneo. By 1963, attitudes towards collecting animals for zoos had changed (there was a movement to only collect creatures in danger of extinction or with threatened habitats) and the series ended. But the genre it started continued to flourish, with subsequent David Attenborough-fronted BBC ventures – such as Life on Earth and The Blue Planet – globally acknowledged as the leaders in their field.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n8. The Sooty Show (1955 to 1992)\n\nA softly-spoken puppet bear wreaks naughty mischief on his master.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIn silly slapstick enjoyed by children and adults, glove puppet chums Sooty and Sweep provided a hilariously down-to-earth, near-subversive north-country antidote to the goody-two-shoes politeness of taut-stringed puppet programmes like Muffin the Mule. Bradford-born engineer Harry Corbett little knew how he’d change children’s television forever when he bought a puppet known as ‘Teddy’ on Blackpool Pier in rainy July 1948, to use in the magic act he did at kids’ parties around Leeds. Having got him a little box to wield his wand out of, he blacked in Teddy’s ears and copyrighted him ‘Sooty’.\n\nThe naughty little bear caused a sensation on television, debuting on Talent Night (1952). Sooty delighted less in magic than in wreaking mute havoc upon long-suffering Mr Corbett; perhaps squirting him charmingly with a water pistol, or, more endearingly still, smacking him lovingly on the head with a hammer.\n\nHarry’s brother Leslie operated silly Sweep, the squeaky, sad-eyed dog who arrived in 1957; Harry’s wife Marjorie handled breathy-voiced Soo, the girl-bear who appeared in 1964. By the time he reluctantly handed Sooty over to son Matthew, business-savvy Harry had developed a supremely successful British TV puppet franchise, still functioning today; and while Sooty’s violence diminished, the idiosyncratic cottage-industry eccentricity remained. The Queen was a fan: introduced in the 1950s to Harry and Sooty, she asked “has he bonked you on the head with his hammer this morning?”\n\n– Vic Pratt\n\n9. A Man from the Sun (1956)\n\nAn early example of a largely Black cast reflecting the Windrush generation’s experience of arriving in Britain.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTo see a single play on British television in 1956 that told a story of immigration from the point of view of the Windrush arrivals themselves was a truly gamechanging moment in broadcasting.\n\nWritten by the highly-respected BBC producer and writer John Elliot, A Man from the Sun undoubtedly betrays some values that now seem patronising and undramatic, with a strong emphasis on the importance of education and integration into society. Nevertheless, actor Earl Cameron’s dignity and authority was put to good use as the moral centre of the piece, providing calm and trusted advice to his fellow immigrants. In calling for communities to be unsegregated and afforded dignity and respect in their own right, the play was remarkably progressive for the period. It didn’t shy away from painting a picture of a largely hostile white society that would test the resolve of Black communities.\n\nThe play’s themes of respect for one another, of mutual tolerance and of the importance of education are all things to learn from even today.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\nWatch a clip\n\nThe full programme is available to view in the BFI Mediatheque\n\n10. ​​​​ Hancock’s Half Hour / Hancock (1956 to 1960)\n\nA lauded radio show moves to television and defines the British sitcom.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTony Hancock was the man who distinguished British scripted comedy from both the music hall variety act and the relatively toothless American-style sitcoms of the time. In Hancock’s Half Hour he starred as the pompous, underachieving comedian Anthony Aloysius Hancock, who lived alongside slippery chancer Sid (Sid James). The series charted their thwarted attempts to gain money and success. Hancock’s Half Hour also marked the growing prominence of television in British homes; it was a hit on BBC radio before transferring to screen as the ITV network began. The TV series took the stories from the radio and added visual gags and expressive eyebrows. There are few recordings that survive, but those that do feature razor-sharp writing and performances, and embody the chaotic energy of live comedy with improvised lines and corpsing from the cast.\n\nThe show’s writers, Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, perfected their piercing observations of class in Steptoe and Son (also rightfully on this list), but this was the pinnacle of Tony Hancock’s career. Hancock himself was ill at ease with his fame, growing depressed and antagonistic toward his co-stars (James was gone by the final series). Yet the mix of pathos and simmering frustration of Hancock’s Half Hour endures and echoes in almost every British sitcom since.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n11. The Eurovision Song Contest (1956-)\n\nEurope comes melodiously together in a good-natured multinational music contest – or does it?\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTechnologically ambitious and massively influential in style, staging and global reach, the Eurovision Song Contest ushered in a new era of co-operative international television. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union, this multi-lingual music contest is still held annually and invites each member state to submit an original song, to be performed live as part of a lengthy stage show, simulcast all over the world. The songs were subsequently awarded points, from ‘nul’ to ‘douze’, as decided by international juries and, latterly, televoters, with the winning nation to host the following year’s show.\n\nIn theory, the event was to be a simple celebration of the power of song for a gracious global community that knows no borders; in practice, international politics and national temperament have inevitably played their part. The contest has often been perceived as a fix, wherein chummy nations unfairly award each other the coveted ‘douze points’, and can be construed as a forum for the oblique airing of international grievances (the UK, for example, has, in recent years, received barely more than ‘nul points’ from all and sundry).\n\nIt didn’t help, perhaps, that for donkeys’ years, dry-chuckling national-treasure and mickey-taker Terry Wogan hosted the programme on UK television, archly encouraging British viewers to take the contest less seriously than the EBU demanded. Often infuriating but also fun, sometimes cloying and frequently kitsch, of late it has also proved itself to be proudly provocative and diverse. Eurovision enjoys an enthusiastic, devoted following – especially among the LGBTQ+ community. It remains a sparkling, spectacular, thoroughly unstoppable annual treat.\n\n– Vic Pratt\n\n12. The Sky at Night (1957-)\n\nAll the mysteries of the cosmos are brought to Earth in this pioneering astronomy lovefest.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIt’s astonishing how The Sky at Night took the most expansive subject and created the cosiest mainstay of BBC television schedules. For 65 years (and counting) viewers have been given a monthly glimpse into space, sharing the thrills of comets, meteor showers, satellites and manned space missions. When it launched, presenter Patrick Moore pitched himself not as a professional astronomer but an amateur enthusiast like the viewers at home, learning the science behind cosmic phenomena from his guests and friends, such as Professor Brian May. From the 2000s onwards, Pete Lawrence’s segment on practical stargazing has added a proactive DIY element that empowers all wannabe astronomers.\n\nSince Moore’s death in 2012 the show has been fronted by a team of bonafide astrophysicists: Dr Lucie Green, Professor Chris Lintott and Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock. While they have academic credentials, this trio have maintained the atmosphere of geeky glee so crucial to The Sky at Night’s appeal. That warm, empathetic approach is what makes The Sky at Night so enduringly accessible and loved, expressing the enthusiasm and wonder of the space age far beyond any other science programme.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n13. Monitor (1958 to 1965)\n\nLandmark, innovative arts magazine programme edited and presented by Huw Wheldon.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nDriven with impassioned energy by Huw Wheldon, Monitor demonstrated that broadcasting about the arts could be both erudite and engaging for a wide audience. Formerly a producer in the BBC’s ‘Talks’ department, Wheldon became presenter then editor of Monitor upon its launch. He embraced the role with enormous zeal, presenting and narrating, as well as interviewing its subjects, who ranged from Henry Moore and Alfred Hitchcock to Spike Milligan and Robert Graves.\n\nBut though Wheldon was Monitor’s figurehead, he was also a visionary, if demanding, patron of new talent, and encouraged the likes of John Schlesinger, Ken Russell, Melvyn Bragg and producer Nancy Thomas to make segments that were often radical in their form. Pop Goes the Easel, Russell’s 1962 programme about four young British Pop artists, for instance, included a nightmarish dream sequence featuring artist Pauline Boty. Elgar, Russell’s film from the same year, mixed dramatic re-enactments and a dazzling interplay of image and music, and helped restore the reputation of the British composer. Wheldon stepped down as presenter in 1964, handing the reins to Jonathan Miller, and would subsequently go on to be director of BBC Television from 1968 to 1975. But Monitor remains one of his greatest achievements, setting the bar for later arts programmes such as Omnibus (1967 to 2003), Arena (1975-), The South Bank Show (ITV, 1978-) and Imagine (2003-).\n\n– James Bell\n\n14. Grandstand (1958 to 2007)\n\nA five-hour marathon of sport, broadcast live every week for just shy of half a century.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nGrandstand was the all-encompassing behemoth of sport on television, making all major national and international sporting tournaments comprehensible and entertaining to viewers at home. It took the BBC’s coverage of sporting events and packaged it with authoritative and characterful commentary, most famously from the personable David Coleman. Remembered by some for his gaffes – or ‘Colemanballs’ – the truth is Coleman managed to navigate a bewildering amount of fast-changing sport (not to mention the reams of paper from the teleprinter live-faxing results on air) with ease and expertise.\n\nGrandstand was the brainchild of producer Bryan Cowgill, who thought to link many disparate sporting events into the studio and augment them with commentary, analysis and novel technology. The format made sport fun and appealing to a much wider viewership. A few years later he would do the same for football with Match of the Day, cementing and broadening the love of the national sport.\n\nWhile Grandstand did have competitors, nothing matched the comprehensive reach of the BBC’s flagship. By the time it ended in 2007 it had indelibly shaped sporting fandom, and left behind the segments Football Focus and Final Score that continue today.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n15. Blue Peter (1958-)\n\nThe world’s longest running children’s TV programme is now part of our cultural DNA.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThe Blue Peter of the popular imagination is one of incontinent elephants, Brownie bonfire conflagrations and the over-zealous use of sticky-backed plastic. The reality is rather more potent. The programme helped to change the relationship television had with its audiences and, through its campaigning, showed that children can help to change lives, too.\n\nThe famous and covetable Blue Peter badge made its first appearance in 1963. As a recognition of achievement, it was one of a number of innovations introduced by legendary producer/editor Biddy Baxter that enabled greater interaction between the programme and the children that watched it. The green badge, introduced in 1988, even encouraged children to champion green causes. Long before Children in Need, Baxter also implemented the programme’s annual charity appeal. From a ‘Stampede’ (to which children donated postage stamps to support famine relief in Ethiopia) to the world’s biggest bring-and-buy sale in 2009, Blue Peter appeals have raised money for important causes in the UK and abroad. Importantly, they enabled children across the country to come together to contribute, while raising their awareness of underprivileged lives and empowering them to see that they can make a difference.\n\n– Robin Baker\n\n16. Morning in the Streets (1959)\n\nBBC documentary finds its poetic voice.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTV documentary not as journalism – but as poetry. By 1959, the BBC had proven that small-screen documentary could report current affairs. Now came a horse of a different colour: a work of observational impressionism, evoking a morning in an unnamed northern English city without presenter or narrator but with lyricism, melancholy, wit and grace (The film was shot mostly in Liverpool but partly in areas of Greater Manchester).\n\nWorking at the BBC’s Northern Film Unit, co-directors Denis Mitchell (a radio veteran on his way to becoming a legend of TV doc) and the more obscure Roy Harris pictorially alternate spontaneity with poise, pausing for evocative visual details. Meanwhile, aurally, Mitchell drew on his radio experience to imaginatively counterpoint their footage with separate audio recordings of interview material. Nothing quite like this had been done before.\n\n– Patrick Russell\n\n17. Face to Face (1959 to 1962)\n\nStarkly filmed interview series in which John Freeman questions notable public figures about their lives.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIn a stylistic break from previous interview series, the simple format of Face to Face, with its unflinching focus and a tone that veered from confrontational to confessional, showed the power and intimacy of the close-up on television. Sketches of the interviewee by Polish artist Feliks Topolski were shown in each title sequence, before a figure in an armchair appeared, his or her face illuminated by a spotlight. John Freeman, who had previously been an MP and a Panorama reporter, issued probing questions from the dark while the camera remained closely focused on the subject.\n\nAnd what fascinating subjects. Face to Face included figures from the worlds of art, politics, psychology, literature and entertainment – from Martin Luther King to Carl Jung.\n\nFreeman asked deeply personal questions, ranging from the interviewees’ childhoods to their religious beliefs, and the ‘as live’ nature of the interviews led to revealing results. It was occasionally felt that he pushed his guests too far, particularly in the emotional edition featuring TV presenter Gilbert Harding and the difficult questions posed to comedy star Tony Hancock. But, as Michael Parkinson put it, the series excelled because it “captured the flicker of expression that tells more than a thousand words”.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n18. An Age of Kings (1960)\n\nUniquely ambitious serialisation of eight of Shakespeare’s history plays in 15 parts.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nShakespeare plays were regularly produced for television in the late 1950s, but with An Age of Kings producer Peter Dews had the innovative vision of presenting Shakespeare’s history plays – from Richard II through Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI and Richard III – as a series, performed by a repertory cast and broadcast over several months. In presenting the plays chronologically, the series was able to show the development of different characters across the different plays, making An Age of Kings a project that truly realised the potential of adapting Shakespeare for a television audience.\n\nMillions tuned in every fortnight from April to November 1960 to see the plays in hour long or 75-minute episodes, with a cast that included future stars such as Eileen Atkins, Judi Dench and Sean Connery. Robert Hardy’s performance as Prince Hal/Henry V was particularly well received. The episodes were performed live, initially from Riverside Studios and then from studios at the newly opened Television Centre. Tony Garnett, who was part of the cast, described the undertaking of staging the live drama as “utterly insane”. The BBC would go further in 1978 with the BBC Television Shakespeare, a project to produce all of Shakespeare’s plays for television, while The Hollow Crown (2012) would bring another vivid version of the Henriad to the BBC.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n19. That Was the Week That Was (1962 to 1963)\n\nBiting satirical sketch show hosted by David Frost and featuring a new generation of comedians and commentators.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTelevision had previously steered clear of the controversy of satire, but this sharp and ‘live’ attack on those with power and influence brought the new wave of irreverent talents to the small screen. Part of a larger ‘satire boom’ that encompassed film, literature, revue and theatre, TW3 (as it became known) was not only revolutionary in its subject matter but also in its presentation style, which did away with artifice to feature the paraphernalia of the television studio in shot, including cameras, boom mikes, stagehands and scenery.\n\nThe series attracted many plaudits but also much criticism, especially from those in positions of authority, who were often the victims of the comic observations. It proved hugely popular with the viewing public, especially when the Profumo scandal provided the show with some of its most fertile ammunition. That Was the Week That Was ended abruptly at the end of 1963, as it was considered too incendiary to run during the election year of 1964, but its influence would continue through a slew of similar British programmes throughout the 1960s. It even reached the United States, with the launch of an American version on NBC (1964 to 1965), again hosted by Frost.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n20. Steptoe and Son (1962 to 1965, 1970 to 1974)\n\nDialogue-driven sitcom following a widower father and son who live a hand-to-mouth existence running a rag-and-bone business.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nWriters Galton and Simpson had created one of the UK’s first successful television sitcoms when they transferred their radio hit Hancock’s Half-Hour to the small screen. After Hancock moved on to pursue new challenges, the BBC offered the writers the chance to create a series of unrelated half-hour projects, and one of these, The Offer, gave birth to Steptoe and Son.\n\nPreviously, most successful sitcoms centred around established comedy talents playing characters (who often shared their names) engaged in gently amusing scenarios or wildly farcical situations. Steptoe and Son was different. For a start it featured ‘straight’ actors, not comedy stars, who were regularly antagonistic to each other, and engaged in heated arguments delivered with an intensity (and with fruity language) usually heard only in serious drama. Despite this, the dialogue was often painfully funny.\n\nThis unusual combination proved immediately popular with the public, and the series quickly attracted huge viewing figures and no little controversy. Crucially, it heralded the birth of a more adult-oriented comedy genre that would go on to spawn such shows as Till Death Us Do Part and The Likely Lads. Equally importantly, it was the first UK sitcom to be format sold to the US (in 1965). Although that pilot failed, it paved the way for the successful transfer of Till Death Do Us Part (as All in the Family) and many other UK shows, including – eventually – a successful US version of Steptoe and Son (retitled in the US as Sandford and Son)\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n21. Z Cars (1962 to 1978)\n\nSocial realism meets police procedural in this pivotal and disruptive northern drama series.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nZ Cars tore on to TV schedules in 1962, disrupting the BBC’s previously deferential and London-centric depiction of police work in Dixon of Dock Green. Set in Merseyside, it followed uniformed police officers on patrol in the fictional postwar town of Newtown (modelled on Kirkby), and found drama in the social issues of regional life. Z Cars struck a chord with its legions of viewers who appreciated the unflinching approach to police relations. The coppers weren’t all bent, but they were flawed; the iconic image of the troubled British detective was arguably originated by characters like Charlie Barlow (Stratford Johns), who fronted a sequence of spin-offs.\n\nCreated by Troy Kennedy Martin, Z Cars was hugely influential in establishing the police drama as TV’s most hard-hitting and addictive genre, not least to Martin’s younger brother Ian who later created The Sweeney for the other channel. Series producer David Rose continued cultivating talent outside London as head of English Regional Drama in the 1970s, contributing striking productions for Play for Today and other programmes. While its legacy looms large, Z Cars stands on its own merit as a fast-paced, emotionally charged and ferociously entertaining police drama.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n22. Doctor Who (1963 to 1989, 2005-)\n\nThe adventures of a human-like alien who travels through time and space.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nBeginning modestly in 1963 as a family-friendly tea-time adventure series, Doctor Who developed into the longest running TV sci-fi series in the world. The arrival of the Daleks – demonic deformed creatures encased in a mobile metal shell – heralded the future change of the production away from a history-based, semi-educational series, towards being a hard sci-fi creature-of-the-week show that combined fantasy adventure with philosophical ideas filtered through a peculiarly British lens.\n\nThe massive success of that first Dalek adventure elevated the show to a new level, and provided a blueprint for the series for 40 years. But arguably the biggest gamechanging element of Doctor Who lies in how it inspired a generation of talents that followed, including Bill Bailey (who cites it as the reason he got interested in TV), Joseph Michael Straczynski (the US show-runner who names Terry Nation – creator of the Daleks – as one of his greatest inspirations), Grant Morrison (whose first writing job was for Doctor Who magazine) and writers Russell T Davies and Steven Moffat, who both became show runners on the show’s rebooted, 21st-century incarnation.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n23. The Colony (1964)\n\nDocumentary showing the experiences of Caribbean immigrants living and working in Birmingham.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nBilled as a portrayal of “a railwayman from St Kitts, a bus conductor from Jamaica, a family of singers from Trinidad and a nurse from Barbados”, The Colony stands apart as a documentary devoted to the voices and thoughts of recent Caribbean immigrants to Birmingham. Like Denis Mitchell (Morning in the Streets), director Philip Donnellan had a background in radio which led him to foreground the voices of his documentary subjects in favour of any kind of authoritative voiceover.\n\nCrafting the documentary in this way meant that participants could speak at length about their experiences, their expectations and their disappointments. While current affairs programmes at this time regularly portrayed immigration as problematic in ways that could be sensationalist, Donnellan’s goal was simply to let people speak for themselves. The Colony is beautifully shot around Handsworth, and features songs from the Stewart family, who also appear in the documentary. Extracts from the programme would later be used by John Akomfrah in Handsworth Songs (1986).\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n24. The Great War (1964)\n\nTV history becomes an art form.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nHistory programmes have been a staple for so long, it’s easy to forget how they got there. The Great War was not the first TV history show, but it was a landmark for the genre in putting so much filmmaking prowess, historical scholarship and sheer resource into the telling.\n\nThe BBC broadcast this First World War history 50 years after the beginning of that cataclysmic conflict, and the series would influence how it would thereafter be remembered. Highly debatable historiographically, it’s undeniably great telly. The scale astonishes: 26 episodes! So does the epic-yet-intricate filmic feel, which is missing from many modern presenter-led TV histories.\n\nA dense mosaic – woven of footage, stills, maps, interviews, narration and Wilfred Josephs’ inventive score – embroiders what is in essence an 11-hour prose-poem crafted for visceral impact. Often the editing echoes the ruthless rapidity of a machine gun.\n\n– Patrick Russell\n\n25. The Wednesday Play (1964 to 1970)\n\nWeekly drama strand that took the temperature of the nation and built a whole generation of talent.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThey’ve long since faded into history, but drama anthologies – offering a different ‘play’ every week (or month) – were once at the heart of Britain’s national conversation. TV plays drew massive audiences, hit the headlines and led political and social debates.\n\nThe Wednesday Play defiantly eschewed the familiar menu of classic drama and literary adaptations, with early producer James MacTaggart embracing his brief from BBC drama head Sydney Newman to produce plays rooted in the here and now.\n\nThe strand nurtured a wealth of emerging talent: producers Tony Garnett and Kenith Trodd, directors Ken Loach and Alan Clarke, writers Jim Allen and Dennis Potter. Many (though far from all) were working class, left wing and determined to open audiences’ eyes to urgent social problems.\n\nFormally innovative as well as politically radical, their provocative use of documentary techniques and exploration of themes like sexuality, religion, the death penalty and backstreet abortion infuriated the rightwing press and moral campaigners. Anxious BBC bosses deemed Peter Watkins’ nuclear war drama The War Game (1966) “too horrifying for the medium of broadcasting” and pulled it before transmission. Most memorable of all was Ken Loach’s Cathy Come Home (1966), whose grim saga of a young couple driven to homelessness shocked the nation, and gave an early boost to the charity Shelter.\n\nIn 1970, a fading Wednesday Play morphed into Play for Today, which carried the torch for groundbreaking, challenging drama for another 14 years.\n\n– Mark Duguid\n\n26. Vision On (1964 to 1976)\n\nProgramme for deaf and hearing children with striking visual elements.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTo my eight-year-old eyes, the Vision On studio in the early 1970s appeared like a kind of friendly hippie commune, with the gentle, fatherly Tony Hart and his bearded and bell-bottomed friends spending all their time on creative pursuits. Each programme was themed around a shape or visual concept that was explored in innovative ways, showing how everyday household objects could be reimagined or repurposed as art. The programme was a lively mix of studio segments (often using sign language), mime, animation and filmed inserts, many set to a catchy modern soundtrack, the best-known being the jazzy ‘Gallery theme’, which has become an iconic piece of TV music.\n\nSegments ranged from simple stop-frame animation to state-of-the-art computer graphics and included some mesmerising, almost psychedelic visual experiments. Editing too was innovative, with contributors given freedom to produce captivating visuals. Obviously, the emphasis on the visual was implicit in its aim to engage a diverse audience, and kids TV has continued this visual, non-verbal approach in series such as Something Special and many others, making it inclusive not only of deaf children but of those for whom English is not their first language.\n\n– Josephine Botting\n\n27. Play School (1964 to 1988)\n\nHugely influential children’s programme aimed at pre-schoolers.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nCreated by Joy Whitby, a producer whose long career at the BBC was devoted to children’s programming, and whose work also included the 1950s radio show Listen with Mother and Jackanory (1965), Play School was immediately recognised as being different to earlier BBC children’s programmes. Here were presenters who spoke directly to their (young) audience, with the aim of providing a nurturing, nursery-like space for children. Whitby consulted closely with teachers, writers and illustrators while devising the programme, and its daily Monday to Friday broadcast quickly became an integral part of the daily lives of millions of children (and parents). Owing to the blackout on BBC Two’s opening night, Play School also had the distinction of being the first full programme broadcast on the channel.\n\nPlay School’s format remained largely the same throughout its 24-year run. Learning-through-play was a key principle for the show, and its presenters encouraged participation with songs, games, poems and stories, as well as regular painting and craft activities. A section of each episode was a short film taking the young audiences on an excursion into the outside world through one of three windows – a key feature that went on to influence other pre-school children’s television programmes. From 1971 to 1984, Play School also had a sister programme called Play Away, which was aimed at slightly older children, while from 1988 Play School was replaced with Playbus, which eventually became Playdays.\n\nThe show also broke ground by featuring the first Black children’s presenter in Paul Danquah, and has had innumerable notable hosts over the decades, including Floella Benjamin, Brian Cant, actor Julie Stevens and TV personality Johnny Ball. The best children’s programming today, whether on CBeebies or similar spaces such as Channel 5’s Milkshake, owes Whitby’s pioneering work on Play School an immeasurable debt.\n\n– Chantelle Lavel Boyea\n\nBBC Two at 50: how the Beeb’s second channel survived its disastrous opening night\n\nAfter a first night – in April 1964 – plagued by a power cut, BBC Two took a few years to find its feet before going on to golden years of innovative programming.\n\nBy Gosta Johansson\n\nBBC Two at 50: how the Beeb’s second channel survived its disastrous opening night\n\n28. Top of the Pops (1964 to 2006)\n\nTOTP is the world’s longest-running music television show, featuring iconic performances from weekly best-selling recording music artists across many genres.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nCreated in an era when it wasn’t easy to see your favourite music artists, TOTP revolutionised how the nation experienced music, with weekly transmissions featuring era-defining live performances and (later) music videos from the top singles-charting artists.\n\nOver the decades, TOTP primarily kept to its original format: only including artists in the top 20 (although in some years this was relaxed to include artists in the top 30 to 40 as “new entries”) and always ending with the number one record (the only record that could appear in consecutive weeks). The show’s producer Johnnie Stewart described it as “the simplest show in the world”.\n\nTOTP was an instant success from its first broadcast, fast becoming a significant part of pop culture. It attracted high numbers of viewers every week, who were eager to catch A-listers in extravagant costume, party-themed sets, fabulous dancers or even themselves in the studio crowd next to the presenter. Alongside formats sold across the globe, there are notable spin-offs, such as the Christmas and New Year specials and TOTP2 , which have plied nostalgia to become hits in their own right.\n\n– Chantelle Lavel Boyea\n\n29. Horizon (1964-)\n\nLong-running and wide-ranging documentary series looking at the world of science.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nScience on TV stretches back to the pre-war Experiments in Science, and many series featured in the 1940s and 50s, including Science Review, Frontiers of Science and A Question of Science. When it debuted in 1964 though, Horizon quickly became the BBC’s flagship of the genre thanks to its policy of spotlighting vastly different branches of science, and its highly original mix of hard science with more general themes.\n\nHorizon started life with a magazine format, intentionally mirroring the style of the successful arts strand Monitor, but it developed into a series of single-themed episodes and added a distinctive storytelling element to its style. It also moved from having a reverent view of science and scientists to sometimes taking a more antagonistic view of its subject, resulting in some controversial programming.\n\nMany of its editions were award-winning and some had a greater impact on the outside world. Following the 1972 programme ‘Whales, Dolphins and Men’, UK pet food companies stopped using whale meat in their products and the government introduced a blanket ban on whale meat imports. 1983’s ‘Killer in the Village’ reported on the spread of Aids in the US and widely increased the public’s awareness of the disease.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n30. Apna hi ghar samajhiye (Make Yourself at Home) (1965 to 1968)\n\nThe first television programme aimed at South Asian audiences.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nInviting Indian and Pakistani viewers to make themselves at home in the UK, this landmark programme took important first steps in representing South Asian communities on British television. Apna hi ghar samajhiye, or Make Yourself at Home, was specifically created for the growing population of immigrant communities in 1960s Britain, with the aim of assisting integration into British life. Produced in Birmingham and broadcast on Sunday mornings and Wednesday afternoons, the show offered its viewers a balance of entertainment and useful information. Presenters Mahendra Kaul and Saleem Shahed spoke a mixture of Hindi and Urdu to directly address viewers. Guidance was given on the practical matters of living in the UK; health, news, debate and musical performances all featured regularly. A segment called ‘Look, Listen and Speak’ taught viewers basic English phrases.\n\nMake Yourself at Home recognised a need to give a voice to South Asian people living in the UK. It started a dialogue with communities that might otherwise have only been viewed from afar in news programmes or dissected as subject matter in documentaries. Apna hi ghar samajhiye led the way for programmes including Nai zindagi naya jeevan (New Life, 1968 to 1982) and later the BBC Asian Network.\n\n– Mandeep Kaur-Lakhan\n\n31. Man Alive (1965 to 1982)\n\nVital documentary series exploring contemporary issues and young lives.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIn the mid-60s, producers Bill Morton and Desmond Wilcox left ITV’s cutting-edge current affairs series This Week to start a documentary series on what was then the newest TV channel, BBC Two. Their ambition for Man Alive was to the capture the everyday struggles of contemporary life in Britain, and they did so through incorporating what to contemporaries felt like unprecedentedly intimate and revealing interviews with ordinary people. Some of the interviews featured in the series were seen as being unsettlingly candid by critics, but now appear to be harbingers of the intimate style used by Louis Theroux or BBC Three reporters Reggie Yates and Stacey Dooley.\n\nStandout editions of Man Alive included two documentaries devoted to lesbians and gay men just before the introduction of the Sexual Offences Act in 1967. The programmes Consenting Adults: The Men and The Women shone a light on lives lived in the shadows under the threat of the law.\n\nProducer Jenny Barraclough made several programmes for the series, the most celebrated being Gale Is Dead – a tragic portrait of how a girl who grew up in care and institutions became a drug addict. Critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote that the series “consistently brightens the mind, and shakes the heart”.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n32. Camberwick Green (1966)\n\nTimeless stop-motion series that introduced Britain to Trumptonshire and helped cut the strings on the marionette era of pre-school television.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThe small village community of Camberwick Green didn’t kill off Andy Pandy and the Flowerpot Men, but they certainly pushed them closer to retirement. Marionettes were a feature of pre-school television programming in its early years, particularly in the BBC’s iconic ‘Watch with Mother’ slot. Gordon Murray was no stranger to strings, having led the BBC Television Puppet Theatre until it was wound up in 1964. He gambled on a new direction and produced the pilot for a new puppet series, filmed in colour and using the more time-intensive technique of stop-motion animation.\n\nDebuting on 3 January 1966, and repeated for decades to come, the 13 episodes of Camberwick Green presented a curious community built around a windmill, the soldiers of Pippin Fort and a village green where a top-hatted doctor could cross paths with a salesman in a helicopter. Stop-motion animation enabled each episode to play out with clockwork precision, from the music-box opening to the effortless manner in which Windy Miller evaded the blades of his mill. Freddie Phillips’ music and the voice of Play School favourite Brian Cant helped build a world that was bursting at the seams, leading to the follow-up series of Trumpton (1967) and Chigley (1969), and a wealth of merchandising that was a sign of things to come.\n\n– Jez Stewart\n\n33. Theatre 625: Talking to a Stranger (1966)\n\nAnnouncing the arrival of Judi Dench as a major screen talent, Talking to a Stranger elevated the suburban family drama to the intensity of Greek tragedy.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nTalking to a Stranger was produced as part of the Theatre 625 strand (whose name refers to the then-new high-definition service available only on the new channel BBC Two; up to that point UK television had been transmitted only at 405 lines). Aside from its technical prowess, the new anthology strand (1964 to 1968) under producer Cedric Messina created some of the finest drama of the period. Many recognise Talking to a Stranger as its finest production and the masterpiece of writer John Hopkins.\n\nIt was a gamechanger on many levels. It exploited a newfound confidence in the ability of television drama to use completely original narrative forms, to examine how one terrible family tragedy came into being. Over the course of four plays – each seen from a different family member’s perspective, and shifting across the present, the past and the deeper past – Hopkins brilliantly constructed the plays so that each one comments on the other and illuminates our understanding of the events we’re witnessing.\n\nNothing so breathtakingly audacious and clever had been attempted before, and certainly not on this scale. Combine this revolutionary structure with Christopher Morahan’s impeccable direction and the cast’s incredibly powerful performances, and the drama’s status is deservedly assured. As George Melly commented: “on the evidence of this work alone, the medium [of television] can be considered to have come of age”.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\n34. The Forsyte Saga (1967)\n\nA period drama based on the novels of John Galsworthy that achieved staggering viewing figures in excess of 18 million.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nCannily used by the BBC to drive people to switch to the newly created BBC Two, The Forsyte Saga followed the fortunes of the aristocratic Forsyte family from 1879 to 1926, over the course of what was then an epic 26 episodes. The Downton Abbey of its day, the show achieved a popularity and viewing figures with its repeat on BBC One not experienced for a period drama before.\n\nBoasting a cast that included Eric Porter, Nyree Dawn Porter and Kenneth More, it made a star of the young Susan Hampshire, whose character Fleur rapidly achieved an iconic status. It also courted some notoriety and controversy when one episode concluded with the rape of Irene (Nyree Dawn Porter) by Soames (Eric Porter). This shocking episode stands as one of television’s greatest ever ‘water cooler’ moments, and newspapers were full of outrage and speculation the morning after it was broadcast.\n\nUnder the experienced BBC producer Donald B. Wilson, The Forsyte Saga’s scripts were perfectly honed to portray the interplay of the characters’ business and romantic trysts, elevating what could have been a soapy drama into something more nuanced, dark and complex. Costing the BBC a massive £10,000 per episode (a huge drama budget for the period), The Forsyte Saga sold around the world and did much to consolidate the BBC’s reputation as a producer of fine drama.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\n35. The Morecambe and Wise Show (1968 to 1977)\n\nLively variety show combining comedy sketches with A-list guest stars.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nMorecambe and Wise made their television debut on the BBC, but they became household names with their 1960s ITV show. When they returned to the BBC in the late 1960s, they not only confirmed their progress but elevated themselves to an even higher status, becoming national treasures and television royalty. Now working with scriptwriter Eddie Braben and producer John Ammonds, they developed a winning formula that made the show a favourite with the nation.\n\nUnder the new team, the relationship between the double-act matured; their interplay now reflecting the real-life affection between them. The kudos of working with them attracted big-name guest-stars, who were happy to play comic foils to the hosts. These were not solely from the field of entertainment, with newsreaders, presenters, sports people and others all willing to leave their comfort zones to join in the fun. The show wasn’t the the first example of such crossovers, but it’s certainly the most notable, and the approach continues to the present, especially with comedic panel shows. The series also pioneered the idea of the blockbuster Christmas special, with the pair’s seasonal shows attracting some of the biggest audiences ever seen in the UK.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n36. Gardeners’ World (1968-)\n\nIconic horticultural hobbyist haven.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nGenteel and affable, Gardeners’ World has gifted television viewers a sanctuary from the inside world since the 1960s. It offers a mix of practical gardening advice and inspiration, delivered by gardeners and for gardeners – no matter your level of skill or the size of your garden. The first gardening programme broadcast in full colour, Gardeners’ World brought sumptuous visuals. However, what made it truly innovative was the inspired decision to shoot the programme in the lead presenter’s own garden, beginning with the venerable Percy Thrower in 1969. Thrower was already known to viewers of Gardening Club (1955 to 1967), broadcast from the roof of the BBC studios in Lime Grove, but Gardeners’ World allowed a more personal relationship between presenter and viewer.\n\nThat friendly, encouraging tone continues today in the voice of Monty Don, who has been the figurehead of Gardeners’ World for nearly two decades (he’s had two stints as lead presenter). Don gives more than just gardening tips – opening up about his depression and demonstrating the healing powers of horticulture. When Don’s faithful canine co-presenter Nigel died at the beginning of lockdown in 2020 there was an outpouring of appreciation for Gardeners’ World and its presenter – a testament to the show’s impact on the wellbeing of its audience.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n37. Civilisation (1969)\n\nKenneth Clark brilliantly exploited the new medium of colour television to bring an uncompromising, highly personal history of art to a mass audience.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nArt and culture had always been somewhat compromised on television by picture quality and black and white. BBC Two’s then-controller David Attenborough was quick to seize the opportunity that higher-definition colour television created, releasing the resources to make Civilisation on glorious 35mm colour film. Most significantly, in entrusting this epic history of the development of art and western culture to the renowned art historian Kenneth Clark, Attenborough ensured that it would be told with an incredible intellectual rigour and bravura. There is no dumbing down on display here – the audience was expected to keep up with Clark’s at times quite egocentric view of 2000 years of art and culture. But they were rewarded with an incredible richness and depth of knowledge, and gloriously shot visuals to match.\n\nThree years in the making, this was the show that set the benchmark for arts broadcasting for many years. In 2018, a new series called Civilisations – inspired by Clark’s original but with a stated aim to look beyond what many had criticised as Clark’s overly western-centric view of art history – was presented by Simon Schama, Mary Beard and David Olusoga.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\n38. Monty Python’s Flying Circus (1969 to 1974)\n\nSurreal, scatological sketch show created and written by the cast.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThe first truly successful post-satire boom sketch show was created by five British Oxbridge graduates – plus an American, Terry Gilliam, whose grotesque animations helped give the show a unique identity. Monty Python’s Flying Circus was distinguished by smart writing that combined esoteric ideas with unexpected silliness, and by sketches that swung from brilliant verbal sparring to surreal slapstick. Gilliam’s animations not only linked disparate material but also freed up the writers from the burden of coming up with punchlines (often the weakest parts of a sketch) as each sketch linked into another.\n\nThe Pythons took to extremes the subverting of TV conventions that had been pioneered by absurdist comedian Spike Milligan (cited as a major influence on the troupe). Despite its overt ‘British-ness’, Python eventually become a global phenomenon and a big influence on US comedy – especially Saturday Night Live! The individual members of the gang all thrived in other areas of the media, and as a team toured successful stage shows and launched major film successes. Further proof of their enduring influence came in 2002 when the word Pythonesque was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\nAn error occured when trying to fetch data for this part of the page.\n\n39. Nationwide (1969 to 1983)\n\nAn early-evening weekday live magazine format on BBC One, anchored in London but incorporating roundups and features from right across the UK.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nThe sheer editorial ambition of Nationwide, which encompassed the whole gamut of UK life every weekday evening from the late 60s through to the early 80s, made for compelling viewing. Hot on the heels of the main early evening news bulletin, Nationwide packed in something for everyone through confident and always pacy delivery. Fronted by familiar and respected BBC heavyweights, counterbalanced by characterful journalists in guises ranging from the most seasoned of hacks through to up-and-coming stars, Nationwide spoke for and was watched by millions.\n\nIn a time of strictly analogue broadcasting, one way or another the dots got joined up; threading last-minute filmed leitmotifs (invariably still wet from the processing baths), musical interludes, consumer issues and live contributions from studios large and small across the entire BBC network. It’s testament to the craft and innovation at play half a century ago that all this was achieved without an iota of digital technology. It feels like a nod of respect is still paid each weekday evening on BBC One’s The One Show, where echoes of Nationwide’s fanfare-inspired signature tune herald the familiarities and assurances of public service broadcasting we have come to expect.\n\n– Charles Fairall\n\n40. The Liver Birds (1969 to 1979, 1996)\n\nGroundbreaking female authorship by Carla Lane captured the spirit of emancipation of the 1960s and early 70s in a cheeky and highly entertaining way.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nAs British cinema had in the swinging 60s, with features like Darling (1965) and Smashing Time (1967), television of the era also began to realise that girls wanted to have fun. While the drama Take Three Girls (1969 to 1971) took a serious look at women’s independence, it proved an ideal subject for a sitcom, and the fact that Liverpool-set The Liver Birds ran for more than 10 years testifies to its huge popularity. Through series two to four, Sandra (Nerys Hughes) and Beryl (Polly James) became a much-loved television pairing. They were best of friends despite being chalk and cheese: Sandra a Protestant only-child brought up by a mother with pretensions; Beryl from a large Irish Catholic family on the poor side of the city.\n\nThe programme’s distinctive theme tune, penned by Liverpool band The Scaffold, heralded a half-hour of quirky, down-to-earth humour. Yet the jaunty opening belied the programme’s navigation of issues such as class, religion, parental separation and sex before marriage, as the flatmates supported each other through life’s ups and downs. Polly James was replaced in series five by Elizabeth Estensen, but was reunited with Hughes in 1996 for a one-off series that brought Sandra and Beryl back together in middle age.\n\n– Josephine Botting\n\n41. The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970)\n\nA series of six 90-minute plays, each featuring a different wife and seen through the eyes of a different writer.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nWriter Maurice Cowan’s internationally acclaimed series, shot in colour and produced by Mark Shivas and Ronald Travers, heightened the reputation of the BBC as the leading creator of period drama.\n\nKeith Michell’s portrayal of Henry is remarkable in its complexity. His monarch transforms from a golden-haired renaissance youth, filled with romantic idealism, to an obese, paranoid tyrant raging at his lost sexual potency and convinced the getting of a legitimate male heir is justification for all his acts of cruelty and betrayal. But in spite of all the toxic masculinity and political intrigue at court, it’s the women and their stories that are in focus here. The wives are not just historical figures remembered by their fates alone (divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived), but fully formed characters. Each episode is a fascinating portrait of a marriage doomed to failure.\n\nThe production design by Peter Seddon is elegantly simple, giving a stage-like intimacy to the scenes. John Bloomfield’s costumes are opulent and authentic, despite being ingeniously crafted from inexpensive fabrics and embellishments. The acting from some of the cast might be considered ‘theatrical’ to modern television audiences, but Annette Crosbie (Catherine of Aragon) and Dorothy Tutin (Anne Boleyn) give skilful and nuanced performances in this intriguing drama.\n\n– Carolyne Bevan\n\n42. Play for Today (1970 to 1984)\n\nInfluential and arresting drama strand, which seeded a generation of talent.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nFollowing on from the innovations of The Wednesday Play, Play for Today took up the challenge of carving out a space for unpredictable and challenging drama that dealt with contemporary issues and often grappled with social problems. But within this – and with the independence that the strand’s producers afforded writers and directors – there was ample room for experimentation; plays ranged from comedy to fantasy, and even horror had a place. The strand was a vital nurturing space for writers as varied as Trevor Griffiths, Dennis Potter, Jim Allen, Paula Milne and Peter McDougall, and directors including Alan Clarke, Mike Leigh, Horace Ové, Stephen Frears and Ken Loach. Even for the talent that went through it alone, Play for Today looms large in the history of British television.\n\nIt’s also often overlooked how much Play for Today did to represent life from across the UK. For instance, amid the social and political dramas of the strand came a strong current of plays exploring facets of life in Northern Ireland that had rarely been seen on television. Graham Reid’s Billy plays from the early 1980s exemplified this, with Kenneth Branagh playing the eponymous Billy in three plays that detailed the antagonistic relationships in a Belfast family. This depiction of daily life beyond the headlines around the Troubles had a huge impact in Northern Ireland, and was revelatory for audiences elsewhere. Almost four decades on, the Billy plays remain a touchstone of Northern Irish drama.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\nAn error occured when trying to fetch data for this part of the page.\n\n43. The Generation Game (1971 to 1982, 1990 to 2002)\n\nUniting the generations to tackle a variety of absurdly funny tasks, and helmed by experienced television host Bruce Forsyth, this gameshow became a national Saturday night institution.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nFew television quiz shows can be said to have had the impact and intergenerational reach of The Generation Game. Pitting family against family across the generations, from grandma to grandson, in a variety of incredibly silly tasks, it was turned into comedic gold by Bruce Forsyth’s acerbic wit, wry comments and great warmth.\n\nAlthough he was an enormously talented variety entertainer, Forsyth’s success as a game show host on The Generation Game was so great that his role as a host largely became his public persona, and locked his career into a sequence of ratings-busting quiz shows. The strength of the show’s format, with its perfect opportunities for interaction between the family contestants and the show’s host, was further demonstrated when Larry Grayson took over in 1978 and again made a huge success of it through his own brand of arch camp humour.\n\nLargely remembered now for the cheapness of the BBC prizes on offer on the legendary conveyor belt (not to mention its absurdly patronising attitude towards its many glamorous female assistants), it’s perhaps hard in a multi-channel and streaming-media ecology to recall or imagine the power this show once had to unite the nation in sheer joy on a Saturday night.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\n44. Parkinson (1971 to 2004)\n\nLong-running chat show that defined its era and its genre.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIt’s no exaggeration to say that Michael Parkinson invented the television chat show in Britain. Originally commissioned for an eight-week run in a late-night slot in 1971, Parkinson became an institution, enduring for an astonishing 36 years.\n\nHe made it look easy, and clearly enjoyed the company of anyone with a story to tell: politicians or comedians, scientists or sportspeople, theatre knights or movie stars. A Yorkshire-born miner’s son, he brought a warm, relaxed charm and a rare gift for listening that put his guests at their ease. But he was far from shallow, and his gentle but smart questioning frequently yielded surprising revelations.\n\nParkinson arrived in a sweet spot when celebrities, even ‘A-listers’, were free and keen to talk, without an army of agents and publicists vetting every word. He interviewed everyone who was anyone: Hollywood legends Ingrid Bergman, Bette Davis and Orson Welles; pop stars David Bowie and Madonna; sports stars Muhammad Ali, George Best and David Beckham. Some became regulars: Ali appeared four times, Peter Ustinov eight, Billy Connolly 15. Parkinson estimated he’d hosted over 2,000 guests, naming only Frank Sinatra as “the one that got away. Otherwise I’ve met everyone I ever wanted to meet.” And thanks to him, so did millions of viewers at home.\n\n– Mark Duguid\n\n45. Open University (1971 to 2006)\n\nA distanced-learning strand that used the democratic power of television to teach and award degrees to people all across the country.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nOpen University, or OU, operated around the hinterlands of the BBC’s schedules, appearing like some alternative universe of broadcast media in the early hours of the day. The audience was substantial and included mature and part-time students, as well as those in prison, the services and more. The Open University took over the original BBC offices at Alexander Palace in 1969 and in the first few years of broadcast had awarded 10,000 degrees, and had over 50,000 students in study.\n\nEncompassing a huge range of specially made programmes on a wide variety of subjects, including space flight, electronic music, as well as traditional topics, it was a powerful contributor to the Reithian ideas of access, information and learning on which the BBC was founded. There were summer schools and a frequent focus on interesting, high-profile speakers, with on-camera visits to unusual places. Paving the way for other forms of distance learning (notably through the internet) and identifying different audiences when there were only a very limited number of channels, it showed how television and other forms of broadcast media could be literally life-changing, particularly when centred on access and education. The Open University continues to this day, now outside the remit of the BBC but still in partnership with it.\n\n– William Fowler\n\n46. Ways of Seeing (1972)\n\nIconoclastic series that questioned the links between classical painting and ideology, and the ways in which we experience art.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nMoving drastically away from the model of the illustrated lecture, Ways of Seeing adopted a far more dynamic, subversive and genuinely exploratory approach to the arts documentary than had ever been seen on British television before. The first episode opened with the provocative, agenda-setting sequence of John Berger apparently taking a Stanley knife to the Botticelli painting Venus and Mars. Not so much a series about storytelling and art history, instead it was about the interrelationships between art and ideology, and how context impacts on meaning. It even dared to shine a light on the processes by which television itself was made and received at the time.\n\nFifty years on, the book derived from the series remains a staple of art and cultural studies courses. Those who only read this important, popular book, however, miss out on John Berger as he speaks directly to camera and emphatically dissects the ways in which how we experience classic painting changed with the advent of photography; or as he listens with great attention to children or a women’s feminist group as they debate their own personal views and perspectives on art and interpretation.\n\nThe four-part series identified the persisting presence of the male gaze across both painting and advertising; and it also illustrated how classical European art reflects and reinforces dominant class ideology. Made with long-term Berger collaborator producer and director Mike Dibb, who came up with the title and devised many of its creative interventions, it’s widely considered one of the most groundbreaking series about art ever made, partly because, even with its moments of appealing, playful iconoclasm, it dared to treat its audience as seriously as it took itself.\n\n– William Fowler\n\nImage lib: John Berger’s Ways of Seeing\n\nForty years ago John Berger’s BBC2 series challenged us to be wiser consumers of fine art. As BFI Southbank marks the anniversary, Jonathan Conlin asks if the series speaks to us today.\n\nBy Jonathan Conlin\n\nImage lib: John Berger’s Ways of Seeing\n\n47. Mastermind (1972-)\n\nLong-running interrogation style television quiz show where contestants answer questions on general knowledge and their chosen specialist subject.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\n“I’ve started so I’ll finish”, goes the catchphrase first coined by long-serving presenter Magnus Magnusson. This iconic intellectual quiz programme still remains a thrilling format today with Clive Myrie as the show’s latest presenter. From the heartbeat-thudding ‘Approaching Menace’ theme tune to the imposing black leather chair lit by spotlight, tension winds its way through each episode’s 30-minute running time. Contestants take a solitary walk to the chair, isolated from the silent audience in the dark. They are alone, facing a barrage of relentless questioning from which they have no escape. With seconds ticking by, the camera traps them in a series of unflinching closeups to capture every word and gesture. Programme creator Bill Wright reportedly wanted Mastermind to emulate his experiences of interrogations during the Second World War.\n\nWhile the format remains largely unchanged since 1972, the varied choice of specialist subjects gives a revealing insight into the changing interests and knowledge of the British public. Subjects have ranged from the English civil war and Shakespeare to Thunderbirds and beekeeping. The programme has inspired spinoffs and been subject to countless parodies, solidifying its place in British popular culture. Mastermind is an unapologetic celebration of specialist knowledge, an antidote to the flashy, dramatic pause-laden game shows that have gained popularity in recent years.\n\n– Mandeep Kaur-Lakhan\n\nWatch it\n\nMastermind is also available to view at the BFI Southbank Mediatheque.\n\nFind out more\n\n48. Newsround (1972-)\n\nA vital BBC service, bringing news for young people that never patronises its audience.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nBefore John Craven’s Newsround launched in 1972 children were largely protected from news and current affairs on television. Commissioned by BBC Children’s, but made possible by the cooperation of BBC News, Newsround was part of creator Edward Barnes’ vision that children should have all the same services the BBC provided for adults. John Craven had only joined the BBC a few years beforehand but became one of the most recognisable faces on television. He anchored the programme for 17 years (after which time his name was removed from the title) with a style that was approachable and authoritative: sitting close to camera rather than behind the desk, announcing the headlines in his Leeds accent with warmth and care.\n\nAlthough a BBC institution, Newsround has never been stuffy or dour; on the contrary it was and is vibrant in its reporting of issues most affecting children and young people. Its alumni of staff is an impressive list of reporters and newsreaders, who often cut their journalistic teeth on Newsround, including Helen Rollason, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Lizo Mzimba and Matthew Price. But Newsround is no easy gig; news stories need to be comprehensively but succinctly contextualised for children without sacrificing editorial balance or – most of all – truth.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n49. The Family (1974)\n\nThe roots of reality TV? Maybe…\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nWhen and how does observational documentary-making morph first into docu-soap and then reality TV? The Family is exhibit A for anyone approaching these knotty questions historically. Over three months a BBC crew embedded themselves in the Reading home of the “ordinary working class” Wilkins family. Their 16mm shooting ratio, high for the time, is paltry compared to the output of today’s fixed-rig cameras, but recorded private lives on unprecedented scale, serving them up for broadcast to a rapt public.\n\nProduced by Paul Watson, co-directing with Franc Roddam, the series became a national talking point, as did the family on which it visited 15 minutes’ fame. Some of those talking points were around issues of social change highlighted by the programme. Unmarried sex and parenting, and mixed-race relationships were, in 1974, enough to make the Wilkins family morally controversial. Some other discussion points involved media ethics, in ways still familiar. Is reality being observed or changed? How will the subjects be affected? Is this sociology or gimmickry?\n\nRevisiting The Family now, it’s striking how much conscious artistry Watson and Roddam apply, announced by a beautifully crafted credits sequence. So is the extent to which issues of class, which have dogged British documentary since even before TV existed, rear their head. Questions asked of family members, on-mic but off screen, come from voices so much posher than those that answer them.\n\n– Patrick Russell\n\n50. Shoulder to Shoulder (1974)\n\nA dramatisation of the fight for women’s suffrage in Britain and the role played by the Pankhurst family.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nIt’s not unusual now for actresses and female directors to produce their own stories for television, but that was certainly not the case in the 1970s, when filmmaker Midge Mackenzie and actress and singer Georgia Brown set out to make a series about the suffragette movement in England in the early 20th century. Mackenzie discovered that there was little public awareness of the history of the movement when she filmed the golden jubilee celebration of women’s suffrage in 1968, and felt she had to bring the story to a wider audience. Georgia Brown was a successful actress struggling to find interesting roles when she teamed up with Mackenzie to plan the series, with the key addition of legendary producer Verity Lambert.\n\nA stellar team of writers was assembled to craft the personal stories of some of the leaders of the Women’s Social and Political Union, and an impressive cast including Siân Phillips as Emmeline Pankhurst, Patricia Quinn as Christabel Pankhurst and Georgia Brown as Annie Kenney brought them to life. Directors Moira Armstrong and Waris Hussein deftly balanced the mix of studio drama and exterior action scenes, and the series didn’t shy away from the brutality of the force-feeding endured by women while imprisoned. Critical reaction was mixed, but audiences adored it, and it was a revelation for many girls watching at home.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n51. Pobol y Cwm (1974-)\n\nThe longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC, the groundbreaking Welsh-language drama remains vital to Welsh culture and emerging talent.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nEvery entry in this list has made a significant contribution to British TV, but how many are as inextricably linked to the vitality of a language as Pobol y Cwm? The launch of Pobol y Cwm on BBC Wales in 1974 was a gamechanging event in itself. Created by Gwenlyn Parry, one of the most creative drama writers in the Welsh language, and John Hefin, an influential figure in film and television, this was the first committed attempt at a Welsh-language soap opera, and arrived at a time when direct action was being taken by pressure groups such as Cymdeithas yr Iaith to establish a strong and representative Welsh-language media.\n\nSianel Pedwar Cymru, or S4C, began broadcasting in 1982, with Pobol y Cwm’s success on the BBC a key factor in the backing for the new station. Pobol y Cwm immediately took pride of place in the schedule, a position it has held for 40 years, making it the longest-running television soap opera produced by the BBC. With its charm and humour, the show remains popular with viewers, and has launched the careers of a number of leading actors, including Ioan Gruffudd, Alexandra Roach and Iwan Rheon. Not bad for a series that was originally intended to run for 10 episodes.\n\n– Mike Williams\n\n52. Arena (1975-)\n\nInfluential arts documentary strand that has explored idiosyncratic subjects in equally idiosyncratic ways.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nA glass bottle bobs in moonlit water, the word ‘Arena’ illuminated in pink neon inside it, as the unmistakeable thrum of Brian Eno’s ‘Another Green World’ plays in the background. From its opening titles onwards, everything about the BBC’s arts documentary strand Arena has been distinctively left of the mainstream. Founded in 1975 as a ‘magazine’ arts show in the mould of forerunners like Monitor, in 1979 it was relaunched under the editorship of Alan Yentob, working closely with directors Anthony Wall and Nigel Finch (who took over as series editors in 1985), and broke away from such norms to focus on single-subject films that eschewed the conventional.\n\nThe subjects themselves have been wonderfully idiosyncratic: take Finch and Wall’s brilliantly original exploration of a single song, My Way (1979), or Finch’s floor-by-floor look at the bohemian denizens of New York’s storied Chelsea Hotel (1981); or the witty, Alexei Sayle-fronted The Private Life of the Ford Contina (1982, also by Finch), about the eponymous car and those who drive it; or James Marsh’s grimly fascinating The Burger and the King: The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley (1996), to pick just a handful.\n\nPost-2000, the series has continued to produce high-profile documentaries – often as co-productions, such as Martin Scorsese’s Dylan film No Direction Home (2005) – while not losing its offbeat edge. The real measure of Arena’s gamechanging impact, though, is to be found in any number of contemporary arts documentaries, the best of which all betray its influence.\n\n– James Bell\n\n53. I, Claudius (1976)\n\nSerialised adaptation of Robert Graves’ acclaimed historical novels, depicting the vile machinations and sordid family drama behind the highest seat of power in the Roman Empire.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\n“They say a snake bit her once… and died.” It’s testament to Siân Phillips’ memorably wicked performance that this early evaluation of her brazenly duplicitous character Livia – by her own on-screen son no less – does not seem entirely far-fetched. Director Herbert Wise encouraged her to “just be evil”, and her unapologetically malevolent presence looms over this epic tale of sex, death and insanity spanning almost 80 years. The performances elsewhere are similarly bold, with Brian Blessed, George Baker, John Hurt, Derek Jacobi and Christopher Biggins, often acting through ageing latex effects and makeup, forming an increasingly unhinged, grotesque parade of emperors.\n\nIt’s more family drama than historical re-enactment, and the focus here is intrigue over action, so the studio-bound nature of the series was to become a great asset, with the beautifully opulent sets winning a BAFTA and an Emmy. Phillips and Jacobi also received BAFTAs and the series was an international success. It was a partial inspiration for the 1980s US soap Dynasty, which substituted emperors for oil tycoons and became known for its calculating, powerful women. Some of I, Claudius’s diabolical DNA can also be found in House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Succession.\n\n– Peter Stanley\n\n54. Multi-Coloured Swap Shop (1976 to 1982)\n\nNearly three hours straight of live kids’ television.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nNo more would 1970s Saturday mornings be spent with repeats of Mr Benn or ancient Laurel and Hardy comedies. Here instead was three spanking-new hours of studio-centric live kids’ programming (although re-runs did still pad out the live bits), with the immediacy of viewer phone-ins – for the first time in UK kids’ television – outweighing the time-delay of letters. Hugely successful over a six-year run, Swap Shop was drily hosted from behind an immense cream-coloured multimedia desk by carefully-coiffed DJ Noel Edmonds – bestowing many a sly wink to studio staff behind the cameras. Edmonds was flanked by stuffed-toy dinosaur co-host Posh Paws, with the supposedly more serious assistance of Newsround host John Craven and, later, Maggie Philbin.\n\nStartlingly, celebrity guests in attendance would receive interview questions from kids ‘direct’ by telephone, live in the studio. Meanwhile, the Outside Broadcast Unit, fronted by ‘Roving Swapman’ chirpy Keith Chegwin, would check in periodically from a muddy field somewhere, to report on the swarms of over-excited kids attempting to organise ‘swaps’: perhaps an unwanted Etch-A-Sketch for a desperately-desired Spirograph, or an awful Emu for a wonderful Womble. Nothing as edgy, exciting and unexpected as all this had been done on national television before (raucous Tiswas, on ITV, had pioneered the Saturday-morning-live format in 1974, but only regionally). Swap Shop’s influence can be sensed, if not always seen, in every slightly uncertain live-and-dangerous Saturday morning kids’ series that has come since.\n\n– Vic Pratt\n\n55. Pennies from Heaven (1978)\n\nIn the 1930s, a travelling sheet-music salesman escapes his stagnant marriage via the romantic whimsy of the songs he sells.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nBy the time he unleashed Pennies from Heaven, Dennis Potter had already established himself as one of a handful of TV writers (Harold Pinter, Alan Bennett, Jack Rosenthal) who were star names recognisable to the home audience. But Pennies would elevate his reputation still further. Back in 1966, John Hopkins’ Talking to a Stranger had proved the potential of long-form dramas written especially for television, and Potter had already experimented with the format with his Casanova (1971), but Pennies was a quantum leap forward. Potter had explored the “rich potency of cheap music” with Moonlight on the Highway (for ITV’s Saturday Night Theatre series in 1969), but this 6 x 75-minute series provided the space for him to perfect the mix of a gritty and grim storyline juxtaposed with the flighty optimism of original 1930s songs.\n\nThe protagonist Arthur Parker (Bob Hoskins) desperately tries to make a living in depression-era Britain, and manages to escape from the misery of his situation by entering a fantasy scenario where he appears to mime to the original 1930s song recordings. The songs were meticulously chosen to reflect aspects of the plot, and served to bring drops of joy into Arthur’s sad life, falling like ‘pennies from heaven’. This was a true television original, and created a subgenre to which Potter himself returned (The Singing Detective, Lipstick on Your Collar) and others explored (Peter Bowker’s 2004 series Blackpool, Steven Bochco’s 1990 series Cop Rock) .\n\n– Dick Fiddy\n\n56. Empire Road (1978 to 1979)\n\nBritain’s first serious attempt at a ‘Black’ soap centred on the lives of the West Indian, East Indian and South Asian community living in the heart of multi-cultural Birmingham.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nEmpire Road was the first British television series to be written, acted and directed predominantly by Black artists, and gave an insight into the day-to-day life of a racially diverse community. Writer Michael Abbensetts combined comedy, drama and tragedy to explore social concerns of the time: race issues, family issues and interracial relationships. The series was made at BBC Pebble Mill, with location work in the Handsworth area of Birmingham. It advanced the careers of some of the leading Black actors of the time: Corinne Skinner-Carter, Norman Beaton, Rudolph Walker, Joseph Marcell and Wayne Laryea. The acclaimed Horace Ové directed four episodes.\n\nEmpire Road went on to influence many other television programmes that have explored Britain’s expanding post-Second World War multicultural population. Exploiting the familiar tropes of the television soap and applying it to underrepresented groups in society, Empire Road did much to normalise the representation of the Black community on UK television.\n\n– Chantelle Lavel Boyea\n\n6 Black writers who blazed a trail in British TV drama\n\nIn the early years of British television, it wasn’t easy for Black writers to find work, but there were some outstanding exceptions...\n\nBy Stephen Bourne\n\n6 Black writers who blazed a trail in British TV drama\n\n57. Grange Hill (1978 to 2008)\n\nPioneering children’s drama series set in a fictional comprehensive school, Grange Hill, reflecting the emotional lives of its young and diverse audience.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nBy showing that children have “the same emotions and fears, aspirations and phobias as everybody else”, Grange Hill was revolutionary. It was the first and most enduring creation of Brookside and Hollyoaks producer Phil Redmond. During the show’s 30-year tenure, stories were shot and told from young people’s viewpoints, voicing their concerns and mirroring viewers’ experiences across the country. Generations consumed its hearty diet of serious issue-led drama and mischievous playground banter.\n\nHeadline-grabbing storylines like Zammo’s heroin addiction had a transformative effect on society, increasing empathy and understanding. Scripted by future film director Anthony Minghella, the Zammo story resonated nationally – with the hit single ‘Just Say No’ – and globally, with cast members being invited to the White House. It won four BAFTAs, including one jointly awarded to its original commissioner, Anna Home, and director Colin Cant. The show’s naturalism is part of its abiding appeal, and Cant was instrumental in increasing diverse and working-class representation, casting talented young actors who spoke in their own accents.\n\nDid this groundbreaking programme have an influence on the likes of Skins and Sex Education? Its legacy continues, regularly referenced in popular culture, despite being cancelled over a decade ago.\n\n– Rebecca Vick\n\n58. Life on Earth (1979)\n\nEpic 13-part series tracing the origins of life on earth\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nAs controller of BBC Two in the 1960s and 1970s, David Attenborough commissioned landmark series such as Civilisation (1969) and Ascent of Man (1973) on the evolution of art and science respectively. It was a natural step, perhaps, to make a similar 13-part series on his area of interest, natural history. The result, Life on Earth, is universally acknowledged as setting the highest of bars for the ‘blue chip’ quality of British wildlife series to come.\n\nThe hugely ambitious series was structured along broadly evolutionary lines, focusing on categories of animals – from the earliest single-celled creatures found in fossils, to marine invertebrates, insects and flowering plants, to fish, reptiles and birds, and on ‘up’ to primates and man. It looked at habitat, behaviours such as hunting and reproduction, and how evolving animal groups adapted to specific environments, whether sea, land, forest or air, with a segue from one episode to the next – so demonstrating the interconnectedness of life on the planet.\n\nThe instructions to the individual filmmakers in the field were to capture footage never seen before, and the results were stunning – most famously, perhaps, the short sequence of Attenborough being groomed by a female mountain gorilla with her young, which, according to Channel 4’s 1999 100 Greatest TV Moments list, ranked ahead of the wedding of Charles and Diana.\n\n– Bryony Dixon\n\n59. A Change of Sex (1979 to 1999)\n\nGroundbreaking series following a transgender woman’s journey to reclaim her true identity.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nRe-emerging at a time when transgender rights are under renewed attack, this landmark series was British television’s first attempt to follow the process of one woman’s transition. Assigned male at birth, the formidable Julia Grant placed extraordinary trust in producer-director David Pearson over a period of two decades: original Inside Story documentary George was seized upon by muck-raking tabloids even before its broadcast in 1979, yet public reaction was overwhelmingly supportive. Interest in Julia’s life was such that the original film was repeated with two follow-ups in 1980 under the series title A Change of Sex; further updates in 1994 and 1999 saw Julia reflecting on the earlier films’ impact, her uneasy role as a spokesperson for the trans community, and her rollercoaster personal life.\n\nMost astonishing is Julia’s dogged determination and resilience in the face of societal ignorance and violent transphobia, and her appalling treatment by a contemptuous NHS psychiatrist. But we also glimpse moments of compassion from friends, family and strangers, and much-needed solidarity from the gay community. Like other early landmarks in on-screen LGBTQ+ representation, A Change of Sex has its critics, with some trans viewers objecting to its focus on a medicalised transition and the binaries of male and female. Understanding of gender identity has evolved greatly since the late 1970s, but this was nonetheless a watershed moment for trans visibility. After Julia’s death in 2019, her story was given a new lease of life by Adam Curtis in his 2021 series Can’t Get You out of My Head.\n\n– Simon McCallum\n\nAn error occured when trying to fetch data for this part of the page.\n\n60. The Chinese Detective (1981 to 1982)\n\nRiveting detective series that tackled race and identity in 1980s Britain.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nCreated by Ian Kennedy Martin (famed for The Sweeney), The Chinese Detective is notable for having the first British East Asian lead in a British television drama. It’s just a shame it took so long, and that British East and South East Asian representation on TV remains so scant 40 years later. David Yip’s central performance as Detective Sergeant John Ho, a man dedicated to his career despite racist abuse and sabotage from his corrupt colleagues, is pensive and affecting. Like Martin’s other work, The Chinese Detective is a mood piece, steeped in the brooding atmosphere and lingo of its East End locations. And when the violence strikes, it’s sharp and piercing.\n\nReading the reviews from the time, it is clear that 1980s Britain was a cruel place to be: even while praising the series for its thrills and pace, critics fell over themselves to make racist jokes about Chinese people. What is striking, then, is that The Chinese Detective itself largely avoids the tropes while addressing racial injustice squarely. The prejudice Ho encounters is all directed at his character rather than embodied in the characterisation, as was more typical with Chinese roles at the time.\n\n– Elinor Groom\n\n61. 40 Minutes (1981 to 1994)\n\nEntertaining and hard-hitting documentary series telling stories about ‘the way we live now’.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nFrom heart transplants to prize-winning leeks, this series covered a varied range of topics. It gave leading documentarian Molly Dineen her first television airing, when her NFTS graduation film Home from the Hill (1987) was broadcast, having been rigorously edited down from just under an hour to fit into the 40 Minutes slot. It tells the striking story of the retired – and debonair and witty – Colonel Hilary Hook, and his struggles on his return to Britain after his privileged life as an ex-pat in Kenya. Hook became a celebrity as a result of the warmth and humour of the programme – distinctive qualities of Dineen’s work throughout her career. She went on to further programmes in the series, including the much-loved Heart of the Angel (1989).\n\nRoger Mills, the series’ first editor, and Will Wyatt, head of documentary features, both believed that most documentaries were too long, and cut the running time from the then-traditional 50 minutes to 40, as well as removing on-screen reporters and most commentaries. Edward Mirzoeff picked up the editor’s mantle in 1985 and reinstated commentaries, which remain an often-divisive feature of documentaries. The series ran for 324 episodes.\n\n– Ros Cranston\n\n62. Boys from the Blackstuff (1982)\n\nA drama that captures perfectly the anger, frustration and waste felt by working-class men unable to find the dignity of work in Thatcher’s Britain.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nEvery so often a television drama comes along that captures the mood of a nation and accurately reflects it back to itself. Such was the case with writer Alan Bleasdale’s brilliant series.\n\nDeveloped out of a single Play for Today drama (broadcast in 1980), the longer-form series allowed Bleasdale to return to his characters and detail the pain and lack of dignity they experienced in trying to lift themselves out of poverty in a Liverpool decimated by recession and unemployment. As factories deemed uncompetitive were closed across the north, Bleasdale showed us the human cost of such policies through a deep and sincere understanding of working-class culture and the effects on individuals and their families. His natural ear for dialogue allowed for some incredible performances, notably from Bernard Hill’s character Yosser Hughes – a desperate man teetering on the edge psychologically.\n\nThe series was also gamechanging in the way it was produced, being one of the first drama series to be shot entirely on video tape on location. Under Philip Saville’s remarkable direction, this achieved the fluidity of film and left the viewer with some truly unforgettable images.\n\nLike Our Friends in the North some 14 years later, Boys from the Blackstuff rates as one of the most important ‘state of the nation’ dramas the BBC has ever produced.\n\n– Marcus Prince\n\n63. Madhur Jaffrey’s Indian Cookery (1982)\n\nEight-part series designed to introduce viewers to a variety of Indian food and encourage them to cook the dishes at home.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nAcclaimed actor Madhur Jaffrey had starred in films prior to fronting this series, but she had also written a celebrated cookbook, An Invitation to Indian Cooking. Meanwhile, producer Jenny Stevens, after working on the successful series Delia Smith’s Cookery Course (1978), was looking to make a new cookery series devoted to Indian cooking, and Jaffrey was the ideal choice.\n\nCookery on television is as old as the medium itself, and has influenced tastes and trends for decades, but this series marked a new chapter in engaging audiences with international cuisine. The series was not the first appearance of Indian cookery on the BBC – most notably Lalita Ahmed had presented Indian cookery as part of Pebble Mill at One, and produced an accompanying book. But Madhur Jaffrey’s Indian Cookery marked a move to the early evening slot, making a new frontier of flavour accessible to a much wider audience. Introducing viewers to ingredients that are now commonplace, Jaffrey describes ginger as looking like “a potato that went a bit haywire” and advises on what to do with coriander. For many viewers this encouragement led them to expand the range of their home cooking; it changed tastes for a generation. As producer Jenny Stevens put it, “through its stomach, Britain became a little more multi-cultural”.\n\n– Lisa Kerrigan\n\n64. Police (1982)\n\nThe documentary that changed British policing.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nPolice was a groundbreaking exercise in documenting the inner workings of UK policing, but its third episode, ‘A Complaint of Rape’, was yet more than that, a cause célèbre that changed policing itself. Series head Roger Graef, who died this year, was an American-born criminologist who became Britain’s pre-eminent exponent of ‘Direct Cinema’ – but on this side of the Atlantic, this observational documentary form flourished not in cinema but on TV.\n\nAcross the 1970s, Graef pioneered bringing 16mm cameras and sound equipment inside multiple institutions. Now he and director-cameraman Charles Stewart rocked up at Thames Valley Police. This edition showed a woman reporting her rape and being interrogated by three male cops – callously and dismissively. Going viral, 1982-style, it was cited in parliament, gained extensive media coverage, and prompted police forces to introduce more thoughtful processes, including greater involvement by female officers.\n\n– Patrick Russell\n\n65. The Young Ones (1982 to 1984)\n\nModern comedy starts here.\n\nHow it changed TV\n\nSpanning just 12 half-hour episodes, this anarchic sitcom came as close as anything to being Gen-X’s rock-n-roll: a cultural product that was theirs and that mystified their elders. Co-written by Ben Elton, Lise Mayer and Rik Mayall, and starring Mayall, Adrian Edmon"
