        "text": "Since they first emerged, all monotheist religions have imposed a break with the anthropomorphism of contemporary polytheistic religions. Thus, unlike the gods of Mesopotamia and Egypt, the God of Moses required obedience to a social and ethical code, and demanded that he not be represented or worshiped in statues.\n\nAfter the birth of Islam in the seventh century, the Quranic prescriptions, which were actually rare, were inspired by the abomination of pagan idols and the danger of witchcraft, which was very popular among the neighboring Nabatean and Chaldean people. The triumphant Islam of the first two centuries after the hegira encountered the cultures of those it conquered, which had a rich repertoire of images, particularly the imperial Byzantine and Sassanian cultures. In Jerusalem, distancing itself from figurative representation, the decoration of the first great Islamic monuments [see module 2, page 7] asserted/established the pure monotheism of Islam against Christian belief and iconography. However, the Omayyads, the first imperial dynasty, were rather iconophiles and in favour of using images. The first civil Islamic art (eighth century) was full of images: in Syria, where they were accepted, they were known under the romantic name of \"desert castles\" and decorated with mosaics, frescoes and reliefs in encrusted enamel depicting animals and people.\n\nThe opinions of Islamic theologians, who actually have never included the issue of images at the heart of their analyses, refer to the founding texts expressing a real \"hostility\" to the images of those who have received the divine breath, human beings and animals. Their \"aniconism\" was based on the Quran and the tradition of the Prophet. Despite the absence of any forceful Quranic censure, the explicit rejection of images by Muslim scholars appeared in the end of the seventh century. The development of negative interpretations of images was based on the hadiths. Images do not consist of a categorical prohibition in Muslim jurisprudence, but rather of a disdainful, reprehensible, and despicable act. The main points of their reservations and disapprobation concern:\n\nThe impurity of a place tainted by images: “Angels do not go in a room which contains a dog or figurative statue” (al-Bukhari, 77, 87). This saying is attributed to the Prophet when in 630 he went inside the purified Ka'ba to go pray [see module Islam I, page 1].\n\nThe risk of idolizing statues and images of entities that are alive and have a soul.\n\nThe crime of arrogant artists who try to create images of living beings. They are accused of wanting to assume the power of God, the sole creator. The makers of images are to be damned on the day of the last judgment because they will be unable to overcome the ordeal that will be imposed on them: they will not be able to give life because only God alone is musawwir (\"creator\" and “creator of forms\") and can breathe life.\n\nImages are tolerated in degraded spaces, bathrooms, streets and hallways, or on a carpet that people walk on."
