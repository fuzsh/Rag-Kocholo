It is the oldest internationally accredited cultural feature film festival in the Arab World, Africa and the Middle East.[6]\n\nThe history of CIFF goes back to 1975, after a visit to the Berlin Film Festival the late writer-critic Kamal El Mallakh and a group of like-minded cinema critics wondered why such a world-class festival could not take place in Egypt. The country was still in Egyptian cinema's \"Golden Age\" and contained a formidable film industry, still the biggest in the Arab world. The Cairo International Film Festival was launched in 1976.[7][8] The 1976 festival featured around 100 films from 33 countries, with 14 films from 14 different countries in competition.\n\nThe Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics headed the festival for the first seven years until 1983. In the following year, the Union of Artist's Syndicates supervised the festival, and after that point, several associations mustered their resources to run the festival. The Egyptian Association of Film Writers and Critics joined with the Ministry of Culture and the Union of Artist's Syndicates to form a joint committee in 1985 to improve the quality and financial state of the festival.[9]\n\nIn 2023, The Cairo International Film Festival’s 45th edition was canceled due to the Israel–Hamas war.[10][11]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nThe highest award given at CIFF is the Golden Pyramid Award awarded for Best Picture.[12]\n\nSilver Pyramid and Bronze Pyramid Awards go to the Best Director and Best New Director respectively.\n\nThe Best Screenplay award is named after the Nobel Prize winner Naguib Mahfouz.\n\nThe festival also offers career achievement awards named after Egyptian actress Faten Hamama.\n\nThe International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) Awards are announced at the closing ceremony of the festival.\n\nThe festival offers awards in specialized categories as well:\n\nThe Horizons of Arab Cinema Competition, presented by the Egyptian Filmmakers Syndicate (EFMS), offers the Saad Eldin Wahba Award for Best Arabic Film and the Salah Abu Seif Award for Best Arab Artistic Contribution.\n\nThe International Critics Week Competition for Feature and Documentary Films, presented by the Egyptian Film Critics Association (EFCA), offers the Shadi Abdel Salam Award for Best Film, awarded to the Director, and the Fathy Farag Award for Best Artistic Contribution, both awards.\n\nCinema of Tomorrow, International Competition (CTIC) for Short Films offers the Youssef Chahine Award for Best Short Film, and The Special Jury Award.\n\nThe Special Jury Award.\n\nCIFF cash awards\n\n[edit]\n\nYoussef Cherif Rizkallah Award (Audience Award): 20,000$ (shared between the producer of the film and the Egyptian company distributing the film in Egypt). The Award will be granted to one of films selected in the International Competition\n\nBest Arab Film Award: 15,000$ presented to the producer of the film. The Award will be granted by a special jury to the best Arab film selected in either the International Competition.\n\nThe International Federation of Film Critics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe FIPRESCI Award is decided by a jury composed of a president and two members, and is awarded to a film in the international competition. The Award is announced during the CIFF closing ceremony.\n\nCairo Film Connection\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Cairo Film Connection is the latest co-production platform aiming at maximizing networking to induce coproductions for films originating from the Arab world. The first year, around 10 projects will be selected by a team of experts. Directors and producers will be invited to the Cairo Film Connection to pitch their projects over a period of 3 days to key industry professionals whether international or from the region. Circulation of the selected project in Arabic and English as well as, individualized meetings scheduled in advance should maximize exposure of the projects and optimize all the participants' experiences. Guests will be carefully selected to cover all stages of development of film production, funding, distribution, marketing, broadcasting, sales, festivals. In addition to the exposure offered to filmmakers during the Cairo Film Connection, the Egyptian Ministry of Culture is offering a special award amounting to $10,000.[13]\n\nOther festival
