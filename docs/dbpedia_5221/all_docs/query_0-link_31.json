        "text": "The Jordanian film “Daughters of Abdul-Rahman” will be screening tonight at The Cinema Hall in JACC. The filmmaker Zaid Abu Hamdan will also be in attendance and a live discussion will take place after the screening.\n\nStoryline: Years after escaping a dictated life, four estranged and offbeat sisters are forced to come together to find their suddenly-missing father. In their secret searching journey, secrets are revealed and more question marks are raised.\n\nThe film has won various awards and currently has a rating of 8.4 on IMDB. It’s in Arabic but has English subtitles. If you’re interested in attending the screening at JACC tonight, the film starts at 9PM and tickets are for 5KD. You can book your tickets by visiting jacc-kw.com/whats-on/\n\nFor those of you who’ve been reading the blog for a few years, you might remember the Cinemagic Rooftop Movie Nights that used to take place in old Salmiya. That closed down years ago and since then no other venue really took over the role of focusing on indie films. But now JACC have launched something similar called “The Cinema”.\n\nEvery Saturday and Tuesday night JACC will be holding movie nights at their cinema where they will be playing mostly indie films or cinema classics. Last night I watched the 2021 film “Costa Brava, Lebanon” at the theater, and this coming Saturday I’ll be heading back to watch “Casablanca” in 4K as part of the 80th-anniversary showing. The other movie I’m interested in seeing is the original 1960 “Psycho” which also got remastered in 4K and will be showing at the end of the month.\n\nThe JACC cinema is actually fairly large for a small cinema and if I remember correctly can hold over 400 people. The screen isn’t the largest and the sound was a bit of an issue last night, but both didn’t stop me from enjoying the movie. The only major negatives were the stale popcorn and the freezing theater. MAKE SURE YOU BRING A JACKET OR HOODIE. THIS IS IMPORTANT. But other than that the seats were pretty comfy and if you get there early you can chill outside the building which is really beautiful at night.\n\nThe whole movie schedule for this month is on the JACC Instagram account @jacc_kw and you can purchase tickets (5KD) from the JACC website jacc-kw.com. To get to the cinema, you need to enter JACC from the very last parking entrance which I’ve highlighted in the photo above. Let me know if you have any questions and before you ask, yes movies do get censored.\n\nUpdate: They’re calling “Cinema Hall”\n\nLessons of Darkness is a film about the Kuwaiti oil fields in flames directed by Werner Herzog and released in 1992. I posted about the movie 8 years ago but it wasn’t available to stream online back then, and now it is.\n\nThe style is similar to movies Baraka and Samsara where footage is combined with beautiful music except, in this case, the beautiful footage is mostly of horror and destruction. The first few minutes look like a scene out of a sci-fi film and it’s really an epic-looking film overall.\n\nThe film is available on YouTube and in HD. I have no idea how long it will be up there until it gets pulled for copyright reasons so if you haven’t watched the film this is your chance to do so. Here is the link.\n\nFor those of you who were looking forward to watching the latest installment of the movie Thor at the cinemas here, you’re going to have to find another place.\n\nAccording to Alqabas, the Ministry of Information has banned the screening of ‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ in Kuwait due to scenes that include gay characters. This shouldn’t come as a surprise anymore, and similar to previous movies that included gay characters, it’s mostly likely going to get banned in other neighboring countries as well.\n\nA few days ago Saudi Arabia banned the movie “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” for including an LGBTQ character called America Chavez. Some news sites published that Kuwait had also banned the movie but according to Cinescape, that still hasn’t happened. When I asked them for confirmation on the ban for my post they responded with the following message:\n\nWe have no knowledge of the mentioned\n\nKuwait’s Ministry of Information censors all movies / set age ratings / cut scenes / ban movies\n\nNot Cinescape, we’re waiting for the ministry’s official decision regarding the movie during their working hours, from Sunday to Thursday\n\nThank you for contacting us\n\nSo although Kuwait will most likely follow the footsteps of Saudi and ban the movie, as of right now it isn’t official yet and the movie is still listed on the Cinescape coming soon page.\n\nThe movies below are now showing at Cinescape, Grand Cinemas and VOX:\n\nNew This Weekend:\n\nMorbius (5.0)\n\nThe Ledge (5.1)\n\nOther Movies Showing Now:\n\nAmbulance (7.6)\n\nBlacklight (5.0)\n\nEncanto (7.8)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (9.2)\n\nThe Bad Guys (N/A)\n\nThe Batman (9.0)\n\nThe Lost City (7.2)\n\nThe Requin (2.6)\n\nThe Tiger Rising (4.6)\n\nThe Wolf and The Lion (6.0)\n\nUncharted (7.2)\n\nThe films below are also now showing at the Scientific Center IMAX theater:\n\nIMAX Movies Showing Now:\n\nAntarctica (N/A)\n\nAsteroid Hunters 3D\n\nBackyard Wilderness 3D (7.7)\n\nTurtle Odyssey (7.2)\n\nNumbers in brackets refer to the IMDB rating at time of publishing.\n\nThe movies below are now showing at Cinescape, Grand Cinemas and VOX:\n\nNew This Weekend:\n\nThe Batman (9.0)\n\nOther Movies Showing Now:\n\nAmerican Siege (3.5)\n\nBlacklight (5.0)\n\nDog (6.8)\n\nEncanto (7.8)\n\nKimi (6.3)\n\nMoonfall (5.6)\n\nMy Sweet Monster (5.8)\n\nScream (7.9)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (9.2)\n\nThe Godfather (9.2)\n\nUncharted (7.2)\n\nClassic Movies Showing Now:\n\nMulan (5.7)\n\nThe films below are also now showing at the Scientific Center IMAX theater:\n\nIMAX Movies Showing Now:\n\nAntarctica (N/A)\n\nAsteroid Hunters 3D\n\nBackyard Wilderness 3D (7.7)\n\nTurtle Odyssey (7.2)\n\nNumbers in brackets refer to the IMDB rating at time of publishing.\n\nThe 1976 movie “The Message” is one of the classics currently playing at Cinescape’s 1954 movie theater. What not a lot of people know is that the star of the film, Anthony Quinn came to Kuwait back then because of the movie. Kuwait, Libya and Morocco had originally promised to support the making of the film financially, but when it was rejected by the Muslim World League in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait still kept its financial support which is why I think the press conference was held here.\n\nAbove is a short clip from the conference which starts with Anthony Quinn and then is followed by the director Moustapha Akkad. If someone knows where I can find the full video, let me know.\n\nSitting two seats down to the left of Anthony Quinn is also Farouq Abdul-Aziz, the creator and host of the Kuwait Television cultural show “Cine Club” which aired from 1977 to 1992. According to a recent interview I found with Farouq, turns out he was later hired to document the making of Anthony Quinn’s movie “Lion of the Desert“. You can watch a short clip from that interview above.\n\nAnd completely random but related, I just found out while researching the info above that Farouq was also responsible for the Kuwait scenes in Ron Fricke’s award-winning movie documentary “Baraka”. He had researched and produced those scenes which you can view above. If you haven’t watched “Baraka” or the follow up film “Samsara“, then you’re missing out.\n\nIt’s been a while since a movie has been banned in Kuwait but according to Al Jarida newspaper, the Marvel Studios’ film ‘Eternals’ has been banned in Kuwait. The newspaper didn’t give any reason for the ban but it’s most likely because of the character ‘Phastos‘ who is the first openly gay hero.\n\nI really wasn’t interested in watching the film but after hearing of the ban I watched the trailer for it and now kinda want to watch it. I guess I’ll have to stream it when it eventually comes out on Disney+.\n\nLast week the pioneer Kuwaiti filmmaker Khalid Al Siddiq passed away at the age of 76. Khalid was behind the first feature film to be made in Kuwait (and the GCC) which was released in 1972 called “The Cruel Sea” (Bas ya Bahar).\n\nThe film caught the attention of the international film community after it was released including film critic Roger Ebert who wrote the article below (source):\n\nPromising first from Kuwait\n\nBy Roger Ebert\n\nIn term of film production, the Middle East remains a largely undiscovered territory. There are a handful of nations with healthy movie industries – Israel, Iran and Egypt come to mind – but their product has been mostly for home consumption. That’s started to change in the last few years and Wednesday’s session of the Chicago International Film Festival presents excellent new films from Kuwait and Iran.\n\n“THE CRUEL SEA” (8:45 p.m. Wednesday) takes place before the discovery of oil in Kuwait; the people are desperately poor and scrape by with subsistence farming and fishing. And of course, there is always the long shot: The possibility that an oyster-diver will discover a pearl.\n\nThe movie is the first feature, not only for its maker but for its country. Director Khaled el Seddik, who did graduate study at the University of Southern California, returned home to make Kuwait’s first feature. He has resisted any temptations to make a flashy or trendy film, and is true to the rhythm and values of Kuwait’s peasant life of many years ago. And so the picture has a strange emotional undertow; the characters behave toward each other in conservative, almost ritualistic ways, yet their emotions come across all the more strongly.\n\nThe story involves a young man (Mohamad Monsour) who is shamed by his family’s poverty and by his inability to impress the family of the girl he loves. He vows to become a pearl diver, to return to the sea that crippled and half-blinded his father. The director gives us measured and perceptive portraits of the dignity with which the men face the sea, and his conclusion is not simply tragic but very bitter.\n\nThe film won the FIPRESCI award at the 1972 Venice Film Festival and since then has been playing in film festivals around the world (source). If you haven’t watched the movie, it’s available with English subtitles on YouTube and I’ve embedded it into the post above."
