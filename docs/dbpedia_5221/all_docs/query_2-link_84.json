        "text": "You are in for a very special treat. A full film about the history of the earliest days of Islam, so good that it was nominated for an Oscar.\n\nAs a child, I remembered the one most important thing that this film did not do: It did not depict the image of the Prophet PBUH at all. Neither do we hear his voice.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nI knew as a kid that Islam frowned upon making images, and we have all learned to accommodate a degree of quiet guilt when we watch films or similar things; however, we have also come to learn that when it comes to promoting our understanding of Islam, powerful stories and useful educational media are incredibly good value for the impact they have.\n\nIn this time when so many of us are locked down due to the importance of restricting contact, I am only too pleased to remember how much I loved this film, and that it can be found online. A few hours were happily spent watching it a again.\n\nTo those of you who have never seen it, I envy you. It stirs the mind into understanding, and inspires one to reflect further on how our religion edged and inched forward, from the first moments that Jibaa’eel (Gabriel) appeared to our prophet PBUH as he meditated in the cave of Hira.\n\nIt really is a very good film indeed, nominated for at least one Oscar, so it came to be respected as a film in its own right, let alone a religious one.\n\nThe rest of this information is ruthlessly cribbed from the wikipedia article.:\n\nThe Message (Arabic: الرسالة‎ Ar-Risālah; originally known as Mohammad, Messenger of God) is a 1976 epic historical drama film directed and produced by Moustapha Akkad, chronicling the life and times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through the perspective of his uncle Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib and adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah.\n\nReleased in both separately-filmed Arabic and English-language versions, The Message serves as an introduction to early Islamic history. The international ensemble cast includes Anthony Quinn, Irene Papas, Michael Ansara, Johnny Sekka, Michael Forest, André Morell, Garrick Hagon, Damien Thomas, and Martin Benson. It was an international co-production between Lebanon, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe film was nominated for Best Original Score in the 50th Academy Awards, composed by Maurice Jarre, but lost the award to Star Wars (composed by John Williams).\n\nMuhammad is visited by the angel Gabriel, which shocks him deeply. The angel asks him to start and spread Islam. Gradually, almost the entire city of Mecca begins to convert. As a result, more enemies will come and hunt Muhammad and his companions from Mecca and confiscate their possessions. Some of these followers fled to Abyssinia to seek refuge with the protection given by the king there.\n\nThey head north, where they receive a warm welcome in the city of Medina and build the first Islamic mosque. They are told that their possessions are being sold in Mecca on the market. Muhammad chooses peace for a moment, but still gets permission to attack. They are attacked but win the Battle of Badr. The Meccans want revenge and beat back with three thousand men in the Battle of Uhud, killing Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib. The Muslims run after the Meccans and leave the camp unprotected. Because of this, they are surprised by riders from behind, so they lose the battle. The Meccans and the Muslims close a 10-year truce.\n\nA few years later, Khalid ibn Walid, a Meccan general who has killed many Muslims, converts to Islam. Meanwhile, Muslim camps in the desert are attacked in the night. The Muslims believe that the Meccans are responsible. Abu Sufyan comes to Medina fearing retribution and claiming that it was not the Meccans, but robbers who had broken the truce. None of the Muslims give him an audience, claiming he “observes no treaty and keeps no pledge.” The Muslims respond with an attack on Mecca with very many troops and “men from every tribe”.\n\nAbu Sufyan seeks an audience with Muhammad on the eve of the attack. The Meccans become very scared but are reassured that no one will be abused in their houses, by the Kaaba, or in Abu Sufyan’s house will be safe. They surrender and Mecca falls into the hands of the Muslims. The pagan images of the gods in the Kaaba are destroyed, and the very first azan in Mecca is called on the Kaaba by Bilaal Ibn Rabaah. The Farewell Sermon is also delivered.\n\nCast\n\nEnglish version\n\nAnthony Quinn as Hamza\n\nIrene Papas as Hind bint Utbah\n\nMichael Ansara as Abu Sufyan ibn Harb\n\nJohnny Sekka as Bilal ibn Rabah\n\nMichael Forest as Khalid ibn al-Walid\n\nAndré Morell as Abu Talib\n\nProduction\n\nWhile creating The Message, director Akkad, who was Muslim, consulted Islamic clerics in a thorough attempt to be respectful towards Islam and its views on portraying Muhammad. He received approval from Al-Azhar in Egypt but was rejected by the Muslim World League in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.[citation needed] Akkad had to go outside the United States in order to raise the production money needed for the film. Lack of financing nearly shut down the film because its initial backers pulled out.[citation needed]\n\nFinancing for the project finally came from the governments of Kuwait, Libya and Morocco, but when it was rejected by the Muslim World League, Emir Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait withdrew financial support.[citation needed] King Hassan II of Morocco gave Akkad full support for the production, while King Khalid bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia and then-Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi provided financial support too.[4]\n\nThe film was shot in Morocco and Libya, with production taking four and a half months to build the cities of Mecca and Medina as they looked in Muhammad’s time. Production took one year; Akkad filmed for six months in Morocco, but had to stop when the Saudi government exerted great pressure on the Moroccan government to stop the project. Akkad went to al-Gaddafi for support in order to complete the project, and the Libyan leader allowed him to move the filming to Libya for the remaining six months.[citation needed]\n\nAkkad saw the film as a way to bridge the gap between the Western and Islamic worlds, stating in a 1976 interview:\n\nI did the film because it is a personal thing for me. Besides its production values as a film, it has its story, its intrigue, its drama. Besides all this I think there was something personal, being a Muslim myself who lived in the west I felt that it was my obligation my duty to tell the truth about Islam. It is a religion that has a 700 million following, yet it’s so little known about which surprised me. I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge, this gap to the west.[citation needed]\n\nAkkad also filmed an Arabic version of the film (in which Muna Wassef played Hind) simultaneously with an Arab cast, for Arabic-speaking audiences. He felt that dubbing the English version into Arabic would not be enough, because the Arabic acting style differs significantly from that of Hollywood and the Arab world. The actors took turns doing the English and Arabic versions in each scene, and both are now sold together on some DVDs.[citation needed]\n\nDepiction of Muhammad\n\nIn accordance with the beliefs of some Muslims regarding depictions of Muhammad, his face is not depicted on-screen nor is his voice heard. Because Islamic tradition generally forbids any direct representation of religious figures, the following disclaimer is displayed at the beginning of the film:\n\nThe makers of this film honour the Islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the Prophet offends against the spirituality of his message. Therefore, the person of Mohammad will not be shown (or heard).\n\nThe rule above was also extended to his wives, his daughters including Fatimah, his sons-in-law, and the first caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, and Ali ibn Talib his paternal cousin). This left Muhammad’s uncle Hamza (Anthony Quinn) and his adopted son Zayd (Damien Thomas) as the central characters. During the battles of Badr and Uhud depicted in the movie, Hamza was in nominal command, even though the actual fighting was led by Muhammad.\n\nWhenever Muhammad was present or very close by, his presence was indicated by light organ music. His words, as he spoke them, were repeated by someone else such as Hamza, Zayd or Bilal. When a scene called for him to be present, the action was filmed from his point of view. Others in the scene nodded to the unheard dialogue or moved with the camera as though moving with Muhammad.\n\nThe closest the film comes to a depiction of Muhammad or his immediate family are the view of Ali’s famous two-pronged sword Zulfiqar during the battle scenes, a glimpse of a staff in the scenes at the Kaaba or in Medina, and Muhammad’s camel, Qaswa.\n\nReception\n\nIn July 1976, five days before the film opened in London’s West End, threatening phone calls to a cinema prompted Akkad to change the title from Mohammed, Messenger of God to The Message, at a cost of £50,000.[5]\n\nSunday Times film critic Dilys Powell described the film as a “Western … crossed with Early Christian”. She noted a similar avoidance of direct depictions of Jesus in early biblical films, and suggested that “from an artistic as well as a religious point of view the film is absolutely right”.[6] Richard Eder of The New York Times described the effect of not showing Muhammad as “awkward” and likened it to “one of those Music Minus One records,” adding that the acting was “on the level of crudity of an early Cecil B. DeMille Bible epic, but the direction and pace is far more languid.”[7] Variety praised the “stunning” photography, “superbly rendered” battle scenes and the “strong and convincing” cast, though the second half of the film was called “facile stuff and anticlimactic.”[8] Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times thought the battle scenes were “spectacularly done” and that Anthony Quinn’s “dignity and stature” were right for his role.[9] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave it two stars out of four, calling it “a decent, big-budget religious movie. No more, no less.”[10] John Pym of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: “The unalleviated tedium of this ten-million dollar enterprise (billed as the first ‘petrodollar’ movie) is largely due to the tawdry staginess of all the sets and the apparent inability of Moustapha Akkad … to muster larger groups of people on any but two-dimensional planes.”[11]\n\nIn 1977, as the film was scheduled to premiere in the United States, a splinter group of the black nationalist Nation of Islam calling itself the Hanafi Movement staged a siege of the Washington, D.C. chapter of the B’nai B’rith.[12] Under the mistaken belief that Anthony Quinn played Muhammad in the film,[13] the group threatened to blow up the building and its inhabitants unless the film’s opening was cancelled.[12][13] The standoff was resolved after the deaths of a journalist and a policeman,[citation needed] but “the film’s American box office prospects never recovered from the unfortunate controversy.”[13]\n\nMuna Wassef’s role as Hind in the Arabic-language version won her international recognition.[14]\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nThe film was nominated for an Oscar in 1977 for Best Original Score for the music by Maurice Jarre.[15]\n\nReferences\n\n1 Siskel, Gene (March 29, 1977). “Protests aside, ‘Mohammad’ is a faithful, big-budget epic”.
