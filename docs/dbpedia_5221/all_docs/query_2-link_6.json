        "text": "TEHRAN- The Arabic version of Moustapha Akkad’s 1976 epic film “The Message” will be screened in Iran for the first time, with Persian dubbing.\n\nOn the occasions of Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Ghadir, the Arabic version of the film, which has never been screened in Iran before, will be shown for the first time at Tehran’s Art Garden on June 16.\n\nThe Arabic version, also known as \"Ar-Risalah\", is a unique blend of Arabic and Western actors, which has resulted in a more believable and realistic portrayal of the life of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). The film's director, Moustapha Akkad, is well-known for his international version of the film, \"Mohammad, Messenger of God\", which has been widely acclaimed.\n\nThe Arabic version of the film features more detailed descriptions of the revelation of Quranic verses compared to the international version. However, due to lack of dubbing, it has not been screened before.\n\nThe film's Persian dubbing will be performed by renowned Iranian actors such as Akbar Zanjanpour, Mohammad Reza Alimardani, Keramat Rudsaz, Mahbod Qana'atpisheh, Yeganeh Ramezani, and others.\n\nThe translator of the film is Hossein Shaygan, who has also translated the Hollywood version of \"Mohammad, the Messenger of God\". Shaygan has acknowledged that the Arabic version is better translated than its international counterpart. He is a well-known dubbing artist who has translated many famous films and cartoons over the years.\n\n“The Message” tells the story of the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) from his early days to his migration to Medina. The film is a biographical drama that explores the challenges faced by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as he spread his message of Islam, and the struggles he faced from his opponents, including the Meccan pagans.\n\nThe film's script was written in consultation with Islamic scholars and experts, ensuring that the film remained true to Islamic tradition and history.\n\n“The Message” has had a significant impact on Islamic culture and cinema. The film's portrayal of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and Islamic history has helped to raise awareness and understanding of Islam among Western audiences. The film's success also paved the way for future Islamic films and television productions.\n\nHowever, the film has also faced controversy and criticism over the years. Some critics have accused the film of promoting a Westernized view of Islam, while others have criticized its portrayal of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as too Westernized.\n\nDespite these criticisms, “The Message” remains an important cultural artifact that has helped to shape the understanding of Islam.\n\nSAB/"
