        "text": "After a countless films about Jesus Christ, the prophet in the christian faith, we have to ask ourselves, has there ever been a film about the prophet of the Islamic faith, Muhammad? Yes, there is, it's titled \"The Message\". But since Mohammad is such a holy figure, he was not to be shown on the screen. The story is told through his uncle, Hamza (Anthony Quinn) and his other followers. But there's some scenes where people speaks directly to the screen. We know that they are talking to Mohammad, and the camera is his point of view. The camera evens nods and moves around like a human being walking around.\n\nThe Message is a very good epic, which gives us…\n\nSo, how does one tell the story of Muhammad and the beginnings of Islam while respecting the teachings of the Quran, thus keeping the prophet offscreen entirely? By placing your focus on the people who surrounded him and on the struggle Islam faced to be recognized as a religion. The Message handles this challenge very well, with the direct stares into the camera from characters when they speak to Muhammad break the fourth wall of this historical epic in a really fascinating way. It practically demands the viewer to engage with the film in a different manner than other films of its genre. There's also some gorgeous camerawork, and it captures the vistas of the Libyan and Moroccan deserts quite…\n\nEvery Muslim youngster has seen this movie—or at least parts of it—with their parents during Ramadan, that much I am certain of. This has evolved into a sort of Ramadan tradition, particularly in Turkey. I occasionally caught bits of it on TV, sometimes dubbed in Turkish as my parents would watch, but this year on the first day of Ramadan, I saw the entire movie in its original language (English) for the first time. It is a widely-acknowledged truth among movie enthusiasts that this production—one of the most successful ever created—explains the Islamic faith and the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in three hours and does it justice. Several themes that are important in the history of Islam are covered in 3…\n\n\"The makers of this film honour the Islamic tradition which holds that the impersonation of the prophet offends against the spirituality of his message. Therefore, the person of Muhammad will not be shown.\"\n\nThis is an ambitious project. The 50's, 60's, and 70's saw a bunch of Christian epics and Moustapha Akkad said, \"Hey why can't I do that except about the birth of Islam?\" So he did, putting out two versions of the same film, one in Arabic and one in English. This version is the English version (chosen because that's what I speak), and it stars Anthony Quinn. I want to reiterate that this is not simply an english dub, it's a completely different film from the Arabic…\n\nBilal: There is no compulsion in religion. A man may take many years, or only need minutes. It is God who decides the time.\n\nWith every Christian epics/films that exist in Hollywood, director Moustapha Akkad delivers the story of Islam in its development, and most of all, the life of prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah from age 40 to his death.\n\nIt's an ambitious epic. First, in its production, because it wouldn't be a surprise to say that a project about the birth of Islam could be easily accepted in Hollywood (and many things had to be changed, like the title for instance). It's interesting that Akkad was motivated to make two versions of The Message: this one, which is in…\n\nDO NOT OPPRESS AND DO NOT BE OPPRESSED.\n\nIn 1976, Moustapha Akkad completed two different films titled The Message that were filmed simultaneously, demonstrating his commitment for his project to reach the largest audience possible. The considerably longer cut was filmed in Arabic with Arab actors, while this version was filmed in English with some actors who are somewhat more recognizable to Western audiences including Anthony Quinn.\n\nThe films depict the history of Islam and the spreading of the titular message by the prophet Muhammad six hundred some years after Jesus. What makes this no-nonsense biographical epic especially unique is that it does not visually depict its protagonist, Muhammad. Some critics at the time called this choice awkward, but I…"
