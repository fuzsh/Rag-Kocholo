Khutbat al-jum'ah or Friday sermon is delivered in the mosque weekly on Friday. The Friday prayer is one of the symbols of Islam, one of the most important aspects of the worship performed on Jumu'ah day is the deliverance of the Friday sermon (Khutbah). The Khutbah originates from the practice of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, who used to deliver words of exhortation, instruction, or command at gatherings for worship in the mosque. By serving as a means to unite, educate, and build the Muslim community, the Friday sermon has been transformed beyond a religious ritual into an important social institution. The content of the khuṭbah can be viewed as a social commentary on the conditions that confront that particular Muslim community. This paper tries to analyze Friday sermon linguistically on how directive speech acts are performed by preacher. According to Searle directive speech act occurs when the speaker expects the listener to do something. Moreover, Huang (2007) states that directive speech acts can be performed to several types, they are advice, commands, orders, questions and requests. The data of this research are taken from Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura (Islamic Religious Council of Singapore) as written Friday sermons at http://www.officeofthemufti.sg/khutbah.html. This study uses qualitative method; the descriptive interpretative technique is used for analyzing data. The writer will read the written Friday sermon, find the utterance using directive speech acts and explain the phenomena using pragmatic theories.\n\nSpeech act is a functional unit in the form of an act which helps humans understand or accomplish things with words in communication. This research was aimed to find out and analyse the types of speech acts which were performed by teachers and students in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classrooms. The researcher employed the speech act theory from Cruse (2000) to analyse and interpret the research results. Qualitative research was applied in this research due to the data source was from the teaching and learning activities in naturalistic environments in English classrooms. The subjects of this research were teachers and students in REAL Equivalent English classrooms. The results showed that there were three types of speech acts found in the interactions between the teachers and students, namely locutionary act, illocutionary act, and perlocutionary act. Locutionary act was performed when teachers and students uttered expressions with no certain intentions. Illocutionary act, on the other hand, was performed when the expressions contained certain intentions to listeners. Perlocutionary act was performed when the listeners showed responses and acted as feedback to the speakers' utterances. By conducting this research, the researcher hopes that it can give more insights to readers regarding to the study of speech act theory in pragmatics field.\n\nThis research deals with the types of illocutionary acts in Donald Trump's Inaugural Speech.
