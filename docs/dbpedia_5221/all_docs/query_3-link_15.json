        "text": "Director Moustapha Akkad’s masterpiece “The Message” will be screened in Saudi Arabia for the first time after being passed by the country’s censors.\n\nThe cinema epic, which chronicles the life of Prophet Muhammad and the birth of Islam, has undergone extensive restoration and will be screened in 4K at Vox Cinemas Riyadh Park during Eid-Al-Fitr.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated film was passed by the General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) at a screening on Thursday.\n\nThe film caused controversy when it was released in 1976 and was banned across much of the Arab world.\n\nNow it will be given a widespread release across the region. Only Kuwait has continued its ban on the film.\n\nAkkad’s son, Malek, has lobbied extensively for “The Message” to be screened across the region.\n\nThe director’s son has worked tirelessly on the film’s restoration and to reacquaint himself with his father’s work.\n\n“Ironically, even though it’s over 40 years later, probably the biggest challenge has been, once again, all the censorship boards and trying to get them to come around and see this film in a new light,” Akkad said.\n\n“Over the years it has become a favorite, a classic in the region that they play on satellite stations, so a huge portion of the population are familiar with this film. But there is still an old guard on the censorship boards. However, I’m happy to say we have been pretty much successful in a large number of countries and I’m very happy about that.”\n\nThe re-release has been made possible by a collaboration between Akkad’s Trancas International and Dubai-based distribution company Front Row Filmed Entertainment.\n\nMoustapha Akkad was born in Aleppo, Syria, had began work on the film in 1974, shooting two versions simultaneously — one in Arabic and one in English. The Arabic version featured some of the biggest stars of Arab cinema, including Abdullah Gaith in the lead role of Hamza. In the English version, the role of Hamza was played by Anthony Quinn.\n\nIn accordance with Islamic beliefs, Prophet Muhammad was not be depicted on screen nor was his voice heard.\n\nLONDON: Oil prices rose on Thursday, supported by optimism that potential US interest rate cuts will boost economic activity and fuel consumption though concerns over slower global demand curbed gains, according to Reuters.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 19 cents, or 0.24 percent, to $79.95 a barrel by 08:25 a.m. Saudi time, recovering some of the previous day’s losses. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures increased by 23 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $77.21 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks fell more than 1 percent on Wednesday after US crude inventories rose unexpectedly on easing worries about a wider Middle East conflict.\n\nUS consumer prices rose moderately in July and the annual increase in inflation slowed to below 3 percent for the first time in nearly 3-1/2 years, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month.\n\n“We saw a correction in Asia trade as the oil market was oversold on Wednesday,” said Yuki Takashima, economist at Nomura Securities, adding that investors are betting the Fed could start cutting rates next month.\n\nInvestor worries over Iran’s potential response to the killing of the leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas last month supported prices. Three senior Iranian officials have said that only a ceasefire deal in Gaza would hold Iran back from direct retaliation against Israel for the assassination.\n\n“Geopolitical risk continues to hang over the oil market. It is still unclear how and if Iran will retaliate against Israel ... This uncertainty has led to increased options trading activity with market participants wanting to protect themselves from significant upside,” ING analysts said in a client note.\n\nHowever, oil inventory gains raised concerns of weaker demand, analysts at ANZ said in a client note. US crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 9, compared with estimates for a 2.2 million barrel draw, building for the first time since late June.\n\nChina’s factory output growth slowed in July while refinery output fell for a fourth month, underscoring the country’s spotty economic recovery, also limiting the market’s upside.\n\nThe market’s focus will be on July’s US retail sales growth after the mixed data from China, said OANDA senior market analyst Kelvin Wong in an email, adding that a disappointing figure may trigger a short-term bearish price move.\n\nOverall, analysts have mixed views on the market’s forward price trajectory.\n\nNomura’s Takashima sees oil prices remaining under pressure as concerns persist that global demand, especially in China, will be sluggish, and predicts WTI will head toward the $72 mark hit in August.\n\nHowever, independent market analyst Tina Teng said prices may go higher in the third quarter, despite China’s slowdown, due to conflict in the Middle East, rate cuts by central banks and a softening US dollar. She sees Brent prices rising to $90 per barrel.\n\nABHA: Cristiano Ronaldo finally broke his Diriyah Saudi Super Cup duck as Al-Nassr secured a spot in this year’s final.\n\nLuis Castro’s team beat Al-Taawoun 2-0 in Abha on Wednesday and will meet Saudi Pro League champions and Riyadh rivals Al-Hilal in Saturday’s final.\n\nAyman Yahya gave Al-Nassr an eighth minute lead by scoring from just inside the six-yard box after a fine run and cross from the left by Sadie Mane.\n\nRonaldo, who had previously failed to hit the mark in the Saudi Super Cup, scored after 57 minutes with a firm low shot after receiving the ball from right-back Sultan Al-Ghannam. The Portuguese star celebrated in his traditional manner, delighting inside the stadium.\n\nAl-Nassr’s Croatian midfielder, Marcelo Brozovic, was sent off in stoppage time but by then it was too late for Al-Taawoun to take advantage.\n\nAl-Nassr lost their 2022 and 2023 semifinals against Al-Ittihad and Al-Hilal respectively.\n\nRonaldo and Al-Nassr now have the chance to claim the club’s third Super Cup since the competition’s inception in 2013, and the first since it pivoted to a four-team tournament two years ago.\n\nRIYADH: The seventh week of elite competition at the Esports World Cup started on Wednesday, with StarCraft II beginning the countdown to the closing of the world’s biggest gaming and esports festival.\n\nThe penultimate week of action at Boulevard Riyadh City saw Korean star Maru and Chinese ace Oliveira reach the semifinals of the Group A Upper Bracket in StarCraft II. The winner will face the victor of American player Astrea and Korean competitor Dark in the final.\n\nThe Group B Upper Bracket semifinals placed Finnish fighter Seral up against Korean player herO, while Italian national Reynor awaited the winner of Korean performer Classic and French competitor Clem in the other semifinal.\n\nStarCraft II has a $1m prize pool, with the champions claiming $400,000 and 1,000 Esports World Cup Club Championship points.\n\nWeek seven continues on Thursday with the much-anticipated Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III and EA Sports FC 24 tournaments. Each of this week's three competitions — which have their grand finals on Sunday — will play a key part in the dramatic finale of the EWC which concludes on Aug. 25. The closing ceremony will also feature the crowning of the EWC Club Champion.\n\nMANCHESTER, United Kingdom: Manchester United kick-off the 2024/25 Premier League season at home to Fulham on Friday before Manchester City begin the defense of their title at free-spending Chelsea on Sunday.\n\nNew Liverpool manager Arne Slot will be under the spotlight on Saturday with a trip to newly-promoted Ipswich for his first competitive game since succeeding Jurgen Klopp.\n\nAFP Sports looks at what to expect from the opening weekend of the new season:\n\nManchester United’s shock FA Cup final win over Manchester City back in May went a long way to keeping Erik ten Hag in charge at Old Trafford.\n\nThe Dutchman has been backed by United’s new football operations hierarchy, led by British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, and was handed a contract extension to 2026.\n\nLeny Yoro, Joshua Zirkzee, Matthijs De Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui have arrived to strengthen Ten Hag’s squad for around £150 million ($192 million).\n\nBut after finishing eighth last season — United’s worst ever Premier League finish — Ten Hag needs a fast start to the new campaign to dispell doubts he is the man to lead the club forward.\n\nFulham won at Old Trafford for the first time in 20 years in February.\n\nAny repeat on Friday will have United fans fearing another season to forget.\n\nArne Slot faces a tricky start to his Premier League career when Liverpool travel to an Ipswich side back in the top-flight after a 22-year absence and buoyant after successive promotions.\n\nLiverpool are yet to make a single signing in the transfer window but have been rampant in pre-season with eye-catching wins over Arsenal, United and Sevilla.\n\nVictory at Portman Road would bring some relief to Liverpool fans still coming to terms with the end of Klopp’s iconic reign.\n\nThe Reds could then build some momentum with a comfortable run of fixtures to come before the October international break.\n\nBut Ipswich defender Axel Tuanzebe is confident of maintaining Ipswich’s proud home record over the past two seasons.\n\n“We’re going to empty the tank and give everything we’ve got,” Tuanzebe told the BBC.\n\n“They’re just humans” he added. “It is just 11 v 11 on the pitch. Not many teams win at Portman Road and we intend to keep it that way.”\n\nNew Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has a baptism of fire against his former club.\n\nMaresca was part of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at City before leading Leicester to promotion from the Championship last season.\n\nThe Italian inherits a chaotic situation at Stamford Bridge with a first team squad now boasting over 50 players and question marks over the future of most of them.\n\nChelsea’s issues were exposed in a torrid pre-season, that included a 4-2 defeat to City in the USA.\n\nBy contrast, there have been few changes for Guardiola’s champions.\n\nBrazilian winger Savinho is the only new arrival, while Argentine forward Julian Alvarez departed this week for Atletico Madrid.\n\nCity’s England trio of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Phil Foden, plus Spanish midfielder Rodri, only returned to training this week after competing in the Euro 2024 final and are unlikely to start against Chelsea.\n\nFixtures:\n\nFriday (all times GMT)\n\nManchester United vs. Fulham (1900)\n\nSaturday\n\nIpswich vs. Liverpool (1130), Arsenal vs. Wolves, Everton vs. Brighton, Newcastle vs. Southampton, Nottingham Forest vs. Bournemouth (all 1400), West Ham vs. Aston Villa (1630)\n\nSunday\n\nBrentford vs Crystal Palace (1300), Chelsea vs. Manchester City (1530)\n\nMonday\n\nLeicester vs. Tottenham (1900)\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s annual inflation rate climbed to 1.5 percent in July compared to the same period last year, driven largely by a surge in housing costs, official data showed.\n\nAccording to data from the General Authority for Statistics, the 9.3 percent increase in the prices of housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels was the primary contributor to the inflation rate.\n\nThis category, which represents a significant portion of the consumer price index, played a crucial role in maintaining the overall inflation level.\n\nThe authority further noted that food and beverage prices also saw a modest rise of 0.4 percent year on year in July, while transportation costs declined by 3.5 percent during the same period.\n\nThis comes against the backdrop of Saudi Arabia’s resilient economy, which maintained an average annual inflation rate of 1.6 percent despite global economic challenges, as noted during a May meeting of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs.\n\nThe Kingdom’s inflation rate continues to be one of the lowest in the region, reflecting the government’s proactive efforts to stabilize the economy and mitigate the impact of global price fluctuations.\n\nThe GASTAT report further noted that housing costs, particularly actual rents, surged by 11.1 percent year on year in July, driven by a 12 percent increase in apartment rental prices.\n\n“The increase in this (housing) category had a significant impact on maintaining the annual inflation rate for July 2024, given the weight this group represents at 21 percent,” said GASTAT in the report.\n\nAdditionally, the cost of dining out and hotel stays rose by 2.3 percent year on year, fueled by a 7 percent increase in accommodation service prices, the authority said."
