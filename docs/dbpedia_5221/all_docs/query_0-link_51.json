        "text": "Tell us about your background and when did you decide to become a filmmaker?\n\nI come from Lebanon and theatre was part of my curriculum in school since I was 3 years old from religious plays to stories of the 1001 Arabian nights. (I even played baby Jesus which was my biggest role yet!) I came to Canada in 2006 to visit my grand mother, but due to the dangerous situation in Lebanon at the time, my family decided to stay in Canada. It has been 14 years that I’m in my home away from home and in that time frame, I saw plays in primary school, I acted and hosted shows in high school. The first play that I’ve seen in Canada that changed me was Romeo and Juliette at La Salle Odyssée in Gatineau, Québec. The charisma of the actors/actresses on stage inspired me to change the way I act on stage; to have fun on stage and to not be afraid to elevate myself. My drama professor saw that and he encouraged me to pursue this as a career! When I want to College, I studied cinema to see what goes behind the camera and the front of it and I went on to study in theatre at the University of Ottawa. Seeing other people making theatre or cinema projects, having the courage to release them into the world and receiving all kinds of encouragement pushed me to have a bit of perspective on myself: I want to tell cool stories too. That’s why I started writing, I started to collaborate with other local filmmakers in their projects as an actor and finally decided to do something for myself as a director with SCREECH.\n\nFilms that inspired you to become a filmmaker?\n\nIt’s a tough one, because the play Romeo and Juliette inspired me to become a better actor, but if I have to pick a movie it would be either Serpico (1973) or Scarface (1983), because Al Pacino’s performance in both of these movies were gold and influenced me as an actor. I say that “James Bond: The Man with the golden gun (1974)” is a movie that inspired me to become a filmmaker, because of how it is filmed and the theatricality of its set is so amazing! Capernaum (2018) by Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaké is so good and heartbreaking from the first frame you see from the movie. The way that it’s filmed with the hand held camera makes you feel like you are not watching a movie and the subject matter of it is so real it’s sad; there is a reason why it was nominated at the Oscars!\n\nWho is your biggest influence?\n\nMy parents, because they worked so hard to give me the comfortable life that I have and to let me do what I love. My father liked and still listens to plays from Ziad Al Rahbani that he grew up with and his love for this art grew on me.\n\nWhat were some of the challenges you had to face in making your films?\n\nThe biggest challenges that I had to face in making films was to work with people. My first short film was very simple, it was just a karate man and a ninja fighting off gangsters…it took me a YEAR to finish it, because my actors were dropping left and right, I had to change the story, there was problems with the editing and in the end, I just gave demo reel footage to my one and only co-actor. They say your first short film is always the hardest and its true! My second one wasn’t too bad, it was a music video done professionally for a relative who sings in a Lebanese choir in Toronto, it was just promoting it on TV or online that was a challenge I struggle with to this day. I was glad that with SCREECH, we shot everything within 4 hours, we had lots of fun, the editing was great and we got recognized for it! I am grateful that all went so well!\n\nDo you have a favorite genre to work in? Why is it your favorite?\n\nTechnically my favorite genre is comedy, but I haven’t really done anything with it yet. I like comedy, because you can experience different things with it. You can laugh at a situation that could be very dramatic and it shows you how human the situation can be. Vice-versa, a funny situation can become very dramatic. You see it in the case of SCREECH where the couple is having intercourse and all of a sudden after the tv screech, you see the same act, that is supposed to generate happiness and pleasure, seen as a tool to give pain to someone else.\n\nWhat’s your all-time favorite movie and why?\n\nThere is a lot of movies that I love, but one that has a special place in my heart would be Zorro (2003), because the action and the fight scenes were so cool and plus I remember watching it when I was a kid in the big cinema of Beirut in Lebanon’s capital. Ever since that day, I couldn’t help but love fighting in films. It got to the point, I would find a quiet space in my house to let my brain imagine fight scenes between fictional characters and acting them as if they were real…My family still thinks I’m crazy when they catch me in the act! In conclusion, this is how my love for writing fight scenes and coordinating them came about.\n\nTell us about your background and when did you decide to become a screenwriter?\n\nMy parents were the ones who opened the doors to Filmmaking for me at an early age. They showed me all kinds of movies from Disney’s Pinocchio to Predator. My mom would show me the classics while my dad focused on sci-fi, horror and action films.\n\nI remember watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day with my dad and brother and crying when Arnold’s character (The T-800) sacrificed himself at the end of the film. Afterwards, I remember my dad telling me someone wrote that movie because it was their job. That was the moment I knew I wanted to be a screenwriter. When I found out people could this for a living I knew there was no turning back.\n\nFilms that inspired you to become a screenwriter?\n\nThe first films that made the initial impact were the original Alien (I first saw the original Alien when I was four years old) and Star Wars. Those films showed me there was no limit to what kind of stories someone could tell. You could write anything about anything.\n\nFilms like The Dark Crystal and Batman: Mask of the Phantasm allowed me to see the emotional depths stories could take but still be so beautiful and inspiring at the same time.\n\nAs I got older, films like Casablanca, Midnight in Paris, The Shawshank Redemption, The King’s Speech and Wolfgang Petersen’s Das Boot confirmed my inspiration and drove me to actually begin writing full length feature screenplays and short stories.\n\nWho is your biggest influence?\n\nI have a long list and it varies with whatever project I’m working on or moment in my life.\n\nThat being said, Stanley Kubrick will always be up there for me. Kubrick changed the definition of Film. He opened doors we never knew existed. He’s one of those rare filmmakers when you sit down and watch one of his movies you’re actually transported into another world. Very few have that ability when it comes to storytelling. Everything he made is genuinely perfect.\n\nI keep the lessons he taught us regarding storytelling with every project I work on. He knew what film really was and we need to be grateful for that.\n\nWhat are some of the challenges you face in writing your own scripts?\n\nConstantly questioning or critiquing myself. Always asking if this story is worth telling or why am I interested in making this into a script. It’s beneficial when I’m going through a rewrite but it’s more harmful if I have that mindset before I even begin writing.\n\nDo you have a favorite genre to work in? Why is it your favorite?\n\nDrama. There’s something about taking real life experiences and creating characters to react to those situations. It’s always a learning experience because each character is going to do something even I can’t expect. I do enjoy dabbling with science fiction or fantasy but there’s something about drama right now that I can jump into and do something different with.\n\nWhat’s your all-time favorite movie and why?\n\nI have a top ten list that changes a lot but Alien will always remain on that list. It’s a film I revisit every year and still find something new to be fascinated with. I think it’s the world and sense of isolation along with the cast and crew who brought Dan O'Bannon’s original vision to life.\n\nI’ll never stop arguing how Alien has some of the best acting of all time. The chemistry between the performers is so natural.\n\nThe film has some of the most incredible practical effects ever produced that sadly aren’t used in a lot of media in this day and age.\n\nIf you could work with anyone in the world, who would that person be?\n\nI have that dream list of Directors, Producers and Actors and Actresses every filmmaker has the goal to work with at some point in their career. I would say at this point it would be incredible to work with Eva Green.\n\nShe’s been in some incredible films and television shows and each piece she’s in is so different from the last. I’m excited to see her new film, Proxima.\n\nI think she could bring some amazing ideas to the table that would only strengthen a script’s goals with story and character.\n\nTell us something most people don't know about you.\n\nI try to practice American Sign Language daily.\n\nThe one person who has truly believed in you throughout your career.\n\nThere’s two people actually, my mom and dad. There were points where I wanted to give up and stop and they were the only ones who believed in me when I couldn’t even believe in myself. They pushed me forward during some tough spots. I wouldn’t be who I am today if it wasn’t for them.\n\nWhat was the most important lesson you had to learn as screenwriter?\n\nThe most important lesson I just recently learned was to believe in myself as a writer in order to tell a great story. I use to be very hard on myself which reflected on the quality of my work. It was a constant struggle of always underestimating my abilities and what I could do.\n\nOnce I overcame that barrier, my writing drastically improved and what I wanted to say came out the right way on the page. Now I write pieces I’m proud of and can see that they resonate and connect with an audience from the recognition I’ve been receiving.\n\nIs it harder to get started or to keep going? What was the particular thing that you had to conquer to do either?\n\nI would say keep going. When you go down certain roads in life, obstacles get in the way or you make excuses to stop what you’re doing because it isn’t “logical”. I think those moments are great for reflection.\n\nWhat keeps you motivated?\n\nI’m always reading books, writing scripts or stories, watching films and spending time with friends and family. I think everyone needs a healthy balance of input and output. One can’t dominate over the other.\n\nHow has your style evolved?\n\nEarly on I was too focused on world building as well as hitting story beats at the right moments. Now, I focus on the characters and their journeys as well as their emotional struggles.\n\nA writer needs to create characters readers can relate to and connect with naturally. If you don’t have that or you try forcing themes, ideas or agendas on to the reader or viewer, no one will care about your story.\n\nThe project(s) you’re most proud of:\n\nI’m currently excited with the recognition and nominations The Lost Track is currently getting. It’s a good small step forward in my career.\n\nThis was a tough project to land but thanks to classes and my professors from Boston University, specifically Professor Marc Weinberg, I was able to tell the story right.\n\nThe most challenging project you worked on. And why?\n\nThere’s a recent feature script I just finished that was one of the most painful scripts to write. Strangely enough, it was one of the fastest scripts I’ve written as well. I can’t talk about the plot but it sadly reflects what a growing number of people in society are facing each year.\n\nWhat’s keeping me going with the story is the overall message. Yes, these characters are put through Hell and back but in the end the overall journey makes them stronger as well as helping others in similar situations.\n\nWhat are your short term and long term career goals?\n\nShort term, I would like to have my short script, The Lost Track, produced into a short film. It would be a nice step forward if I can find the right Director and production team to bring the story to life.\n\nThere are certain features I’ve written that I would love to be picked up and produced. If I can have one of my scripts made into a feature film I would truly be grateful.\n\nI also wish to publish a book of short stories in the future. It’s been a little project I’ve worked on over the years and hopefully one day something can come out of it.\n\nYour next projects?\n\nThere’s a script I’m working on with my co-writer from Boston University, Bayleigh Von Schneider. She’s out in LA while I’m in Chicago. It started out as an idea she had that grew into a full outline after a three hour meeting of us talking and laying out the story. I’m excited to see where it goes.\n\nI have a TV Pilot Script I’ve been getting assistance with from attorneys to make sure it’s accurate as well as compelling for readers and viewers.\n\nLastly, I just finished feature script but as any writer knows, there’s always rewrites. The writing never stops.\n\nFind Brandon on social media to keep track of his career:\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-stark-37691664/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/bstark92/\n\nTell us about your background and when did you decide to become a filmmaker/actor/screenwriter?\n\nI’m not sure when I knew that I wanted to be a filmmaker, but I know when I wanted to make action pieces. Before I ever produced a narrative film, I produced commercials, and later political ads and video commentary of a Libertarian nature. I directed the documentary, “Dark Planet: Visions of America,” as well as some short docs about the Southern border and the proposed 9/11 Mosque for WND-TV. Years of that kind of work gave me the chops I needed to produce bigger creative projects. That’s my background. And my inspirations? Gosh. I guess the first time I saw “Seven Samurai” is a big moment. That’s when I knew that I just had to tell stories like that. Because there’s such a purity to hand-to-hand combat, you know? It’s both literal and symbolic. It embodies the conflict we all face in living versus dying, success versus failure, day in and day out. Now, this was many years before I started producing films or even knew Krav Maga, real “badassery,” right? But (the director) Kurosawa’s swordplay storytelling really resonated with me. I loved the hard edge of truth I saw in the plight of seven men standing up for the oppressed villagers. Back then, I was a punk rocker; I romanticized resistance. And vocationally, I still do. I turned 40 this year, so even though I’m what could pass for an old fart these days, I still love fighting. I own a combat training center in North Carolina called Triangle Krav Maga. Every day, we fight because that’s how you stay sharp. That’s the resistance I love, the art of staying dangerous. For me, that’s part of being an American.\n\nFilms that inspired you to become a filmmaker/actor/screenwriter?\n\n“Oldboy,” the older Korean film, has this insane one-shot, continuous action scene where the protagonist fights off, like, an entire hallway full of thugs with just his fists, his feet and a hammer. It’s shocking because it’s so realistic and utterly savage. Oh Dae-Su (the hero) gets knocked down, he gets kicked, beaten to shit, at one point even plays dead! But then he pops up swinging! Flailing, really. He just won’t give up. And this is really ugly fighting but it’s still got geometry to it, like Krav Maga does. It’s nothing like the buttery-smooth ballet of run-of-the-mill martial arts films where the hero stays pretty. That hammer fight was a mosh pit, man. Just like real life. The guy (Oh Dae-Su) gets knocked around, but keeps hammering through feet, knees, arms and anything else that gets near him, ‘til he’s the last man standing. In the late nineties, I lived on the street for a year to study the homeless, and as you might imagine, I saw some violence. I’ve been in group fights before and it’s just like what you see in “Oldboy.” Total chaos. You’ve gotta kick, bite, and rip anything you can to stay on your feet, or you’ll end up on your back, and that’s the last place to be in a fight with multiple attackers. Another film that inspired me was “Hanna.” There were several moments in the film that were pretty real, like when the big skinhead is fighting Eric (the actor Eric Bana, who played Hanna’s father in the film), and he does a defensive front kick from Krav Maga. Just boots him. Then he winds up for a finisher, a real haymaker, and Eric does this beautiful 360 simultaneous counter with a heel strike. That’s when you block the wide attack with one hand and strike directly to the face with other. Perfect execution. And totally real! The exact same thing I’ve taught civilians, police and Spec Ops units for the past ten years. But it was the first time I’d ever seen Krav Maga used in a motion picture like that. Since then, elements of Krav have popped up in films like “The Debt,” “Alex Cross” and at least one of the “Bourne Identity” films, among others. But until we came along, movies didn’t really showcase authentic, gritty Krav Maga techniques. Oh! It has been done in one video game, however, if any readers would like to see Krav in that genre. The game is “Splinter Cell: Conviction.” I know we’re supposed to be talking film, but let me geek out for just one minute? Every single one of Sam Fisher’s (the game’s protagonist) moves are legit Krav Maga takedowns and finishers. Its so amazing. We even did a workshop weekend where we did nothing but train those takedowns. Epic! Okay, I’m ready to move on. So! Where were we? Inspiration, yes. So after I'd seen Krav ignored in films, I decided to to do something about it. In 2014, we released the world’s first film that only utilized Krav Maga techniques throughout it, and that was “Krav Maga Compendium.” That went viral, but we never put it to the festival circuit. It was meant to be a visual textbook to Krav moves; people can see it at thisiskravmaga.com, by the way. Each technique’s title flies on and offscreen in Hebrew and English, each time it’s used, so it wasn’t as wild or creative as a narrative piece. So this year, we set out to do just that. “WASTERS” is the first film to feature Krav Maga in an artistically, stylistically wild universe while retaining the true movements and principles of our fighting system.\n\nWho is your biggest influence?\n\nGeorge Miller and Robert Rodriguez are probably my two greatest influences for “WASTERS.” But in the broader sense, I really look up to Akira Kurosawa and Michael Mann for “Seven Samurai” and “Heat,” respectively. Decades later, those films are still extremely powerful.\n\nWhat were some of the challenges you had to face in making your films?\n\nAs with every indie, financing was always a bear (laughs). It’s been a tremendous hurdle up until “WASTERS,” but not this time around. With this film, the greatest challenge was making sure that our actors could execute the fighting techniques, flawlessly. Many, many hours of practice, weekends of training and numerous takes really took a toll on the cast, especially my wife (Greer Mitchell, who plays Molotov’s co-lead “Sawyer”). With Fight Dub (Triangle Krav Maga’s fight team), we do our own stunts, so what you see in the film is what you get. Or what we got, actually. We got beaten up, kicked around and thrown out of windows nine feet high, for real. Nobody got injured, but we may have hurt somebody’s feelings once or twice (laughs). It was demanding, but we kept working, bleeding and even crying at times, until the final shot was right. And I’m very proud of the cast for it. Fight Dub is world class, and the final result really reflects that.\n\nDo you have a favorite genre to work in? Why is it your favorite?\n\nAt this point, I’m more inclined toward action than anything else. I know it, I can do it. One of the accolades I treasure most is my Best Stuntman Award, from the Oniros Film Awards in Italy. That was a great honor to receive, given my line of work. And though I’m a huge fan of intangible things like classical literature or political science, the grounded, corporeal nature of physical conflict inspires me on many levels. I think that’s why Hemingway loved his pugilism and other physical challenges, despite being known as America’s most brilliant author. These days, there’s way more emphasis on feelings than on facts. I mean, that’s how people still push socialism, for example. Any nation that identifies as a socialist state restricts basic human rights and is extremely poor. We all know that. Even though millions starve in China, they have a lot of debtors around the world and use sweatshops to pump out car parts and electronics so their economy’s stronger than, say, Cuba. China’s adopted capitalism, but still identifies as a socialist state because they’re too embarrassed to admit that socialism didn’t work. If it had, they wouldn’t have adopted capitalism! They wouldn’t be working with Apple and Ray Ban! They make über-capitalist products for us. Even all-American products like American Girl Dolls and Radio Flyer wagons are actually manufactured by supposedly-socialist China. The point is, they practice capitalism, minus basic human rights, of course. And when you see this, it’s obvious that feelings are what drive people’s dedication to socialism, because the facts say that it’s a failure. In cinema, it’s the same. Just like in the real world, fists are facts. There’s no debate about what works when you get thrown through a glass table, right? There’s no ambiguity about a fist through your jaw. Fighting’s symbolic of cold, hard reality, just like the cold, hard, economic depression of Cuba. And taking matters into your own hands separates what works from what doesn’t, feelings be damned. It reflects or calculates all of your past experiences, all of your worldviews and passions, adds them all together and reveals a life-defining sum in one ruthless instant. You live or you don’t. Fighting reveals who you are more than what party you support or what politician you vote for. It exposes what you are, deep down. Are you a hero, a fool or a coward that runs at the first sign of physical danger?\n\nWhat’s your all-time favorite movie and why?\n\nEasy.\n\n“Braveheart” is easily the greatest movie of all time for me, because it showed the world what true courage looked like. It pushed an entire generation toward real courage and independence, which we could really use more of these days. And technically, it was also the first film to throw terrified film crews and delicate equipment into the dumpster fire of muddy, medieval warfare and the first to actually show blood hitting the camera lens. Braveheart’s battles made you feel fear, as the camera lurched when struck by a horse or a falling soldier. It was intense! Before then, as the audience, we were used to seeing heroes and villains kicking each other’s asses. Braveheart was the first film to kick ours, too.\n\nIf you could work with anyone in the world, who would that person be?\n\nMel Gibson. He’s one of the greatest actors and filmmakers of all time. “Braveheart.” Full stop.\n\nTell us something most people don't know about you.\n\nI’ve died and come back to life more than once.\n\nThe one person who has truly believed in you throughout your career.\n\nI have so many great people supporting me today, especially my wife Greer. She’s amazing, beautiful and supportive. She’s the best. But long before I met her, nearly two decades ago, when making films or opening a combat training were just dreams, my ex-wife Patricia, she believed in me and supported me in every way that she could. Having someone who loves an idea that would sound outrageous to the average person is the greatest gift a visionary could ask for. So, I’m thankful to her for that and always will be. But as I said, today, Greer provides support and critical opinion. Having a partner to challenge and hone your ideas is also invaluable. I’m very lucky to have her in my corner.\n\nWhat was the most important lesson you had to learn as filmmaker/actor/screenwriter?\n\nLighting. And I’m still learning it! The biggest lesson I’ve learned in that area was that it’s better to underlight than to overdo it. In post, you can possibly brighten low-lit footage, but when a scene is blown out, there’s nothing you can do.\n\nIs it harder to get started or to keep going? What was the particular thing that you had to conquer to do either?\n\nI love to start projects, but wrapping them up takes a lot more self-control and time management. Having date-sensitive goals and intentionally setting them up so that other people depend on their completion is the key. I’m borrowing from the great Adam Smith here, who was probably the first person to ever observe that we often do our worst for ourselves and our loved ones but perform at our very best when strangers are involved. And I must say, after years of thinking about it, Mr. Smith is absolutely right. I honestly don’t respect myself as much as my staff or associates. It’s so easy to let myself down, but others? Oh, no. Not gonna happen. Not unless something crazy is going on. So, I set it up so that I’d be letting other team members down if I don’t get my work done on time. It forces me to be excellent.\n\nWhat keeps you motivated?\n\nTime. You’ll never get it back, man! So make every moment count!\n\nHow has your style evolved?\n\nI used to be all about documentary work. I was pretty didactic, pushing the truth out, confronting viewers with reality. These days, I’m more interested in making fiction that reflects reality.\n\nOn set, the most important thing is:\n\nA strong director. Even if and when things go wrong, an assertive director can steer the ship back on course. But if the director’s soft or even too easygoing, they won’t command the respect of their cast and crew. And there goes your time management, powerful performances and any technical excellence. The director has to set the tone and inspire an atmosphere of excellence. That’s not an easy thing to do! I think that most people aren’t equipped for it.\n\nThe project(s) you’re most proud of:\n\nHonestly, I’m most proud of WASTERS. It’s a giant leap for Krav Maga! And it was a blast to make. I love the people I work with. They’re all top drawer, all the way. Especially my staff. Shout-out Caryn, Jason, Erik, Greer, everybody at TKM. Love you three thousand!\n\nThe most challenging project you worked on. And why?\n\nOh, wow. I think that would have to be when I was sent to the Southern border to see if it was secure or porous. It’s porous, in case anyone’s wondering (laughs). I interviewed law enforcement, border patrol, even militia members. At the time, the cartels supposedly had a bounty out on any American militia members near the Arizona border, which is where I was. So I had to wear Level 4 body armor just to roll with the militia to see what they’re doing out there. A couple times there were spotters that could have been snipers, and everybody had to take cover. Both times, the spotters took off. One time, I saw the gleam off of one of their binoculars or scopes, I couldn’t tell. They weren’t snipers, but it was still really scary, man. And then we had to stay in an abandoned mine, which they’d converted into their headquarters. There was no cell service out there, so my family and friends were freaking out the whole time I was there. And then, one night, a swarm of bats flew over me. Let me tell you, that is a seriously awful thing to wake up to. And I couldn’t see anything because the genny (power generator) had gone down, but I felt them flying right over me, squealing and shrieking. Holy cow. I’m PTSD’ing right now! I rolled over and covered my head, yelling at the top of my lungs. I honestly didn’t know what was going on, man! When I turned on my headlamp, there was guano like, everywhere, including my sleeping bag. Thankfully, none got on my body, but yeah. That was literally batshit crazy (laughs).\n\nWhat are your short term and long term career goals?\n\nWith Krav Maga, my long term goal is to continue training and certifying instructors through our federation, Atlas Krav Maga. In terms of film, I’d love to make either WASTERS 2 or a full-length WASTERS, proper. So far, WASTERS has won over 30 awards and nominations, internationally, so that only improves the odds of that happening. No matter what, we’ll keep promoting our savage system in creative ways and winning awards along the way.\n\nYour next projects?\n\nWell, in addition to a WASTERS follow-up, we recently finished building out an all-new training facility in Durham, NC. So we’re doing all kinds of things there. It’s really amazing, the new place. Huge. Also, we’ll be making more Krav Maga instructional videos to help people stay dangerous. As I often say, nobody can guarantee your safety. But you can control your level of dangerous.\n\nPlease share with us where people can find you on social media, so our readers could keep track of your career.\n\nSure! They can follow Triangle Krav Maga at\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TriangleKM/\n\nand my page is Molotov Mitchell at\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/MolotovUSA"
