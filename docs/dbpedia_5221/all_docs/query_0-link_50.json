The single word, PEDIATRICS, has been chosen to indicate this catholic intent.\" PEDIATRICS continues this legacy, publishing original research, clinical observations, and special feature articles in the field of pediatrics, as broadly defined. Contributions pertinent to pediatrics are also included from related fields such as nutrition, surgery, dentistry, public health, child health services, human genetics, basic sciences, psychology, psychiatry, education, sociology, and nursing.\n\n&raquo\n\nProQuest: International Index to Music Periodicals (IIMP) Full TextProQuestIIMPFT_IPIIMP Full Text draws its current content from more than 370 international music periodicals from over 20 countries with over 60 Full Text titles.

Following in the footsteps of Wilson, Audubon, and Bent, BNA makes a quantum leap in information beyond what these historic figures were able to provide. Edited by Drs. Alan Poole and Frank Gill, this series provides detailed scientific information (18 volumes, 18,000 pages in total) for each of the 716 species of birds nesting in the USA and Canada. The print version of BNA was completed in 2002, a joint 10 year project of the American Ornithologists' Union, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the Academy of Natural Sciences. Now as an online project of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, BNA is poised to become a living resource. Account contents will be updated frequently, with online-coordinated contributions from researchers, citizen scientists, and designated reviewers and editors. In addition, BNA Online will build image and video galleries showing behaviors, habitat, nests, eggs and nestlings, and more.
