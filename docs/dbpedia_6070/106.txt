Leonardo da Vinci was born on 15 April 1452 in Vinci, a town in the Republic of Florence, now Italy. He was the illegitimate son of Ser Piero da Vinci, a notary, and Caterina, a peasant woman. Although he was born out of wedlock, his father recognised him and ensured that he received an education suited to his talents.

Da Vinci’s early life was characterised by curiosity and eagerness to learn. His family recognised his potential and provided him with an education that encouraged his artistic inclinations.

At the age of 14, Leonardo became an apprentice in the workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio. During his time there, he honed his skills in painting, sculpture and other artistic pursuits while learning about science and anatomy.

As a young artist, Leonardo experimented with various art forms and techniques. His exceptional powers of observation enabled him to capture intricate details in his artwork, setting him apart from his contemporaries.

Perspective is an artistic technique used to present the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality on a two-dimensional surface. By applying the principles of scale and vanishing points, artists can create realistic and spatially accurate representations of objects and scenes that give the impression of reaching into the distance.

By understanding the principles of perspective, Leonardo created artworks with a sense of depth and realism that captivated viewers and made them feel immersed in the scenes.

This iconic fresco demonstrates da Vinci’s mastery of perspective and emotion. The use of light and shadow combined with the vivid facial expressions of the apostles creates a captivating depiction of the climax of the Last Supper.

The original painting of “The Last Supper” by Leonardo da Vinci is in the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can view the masterpiece in its original location, but are required to book tickets in advance due to high demand and limited access to preserve the artwork.
