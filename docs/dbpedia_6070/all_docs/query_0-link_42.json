        "text": "Over the last several months we have researched various medias of art throughout history. Art, whether used directly and/or indirectly is a very powerful tool influencing almost every aspect of the world we live in. Transcending time and space, art can teach us so many things not only about ourself but also about the societies we live in, politics, love, war and human nature in general. This course has shown me how artist have been leaders in society as a whole and why their work through history has been so important. Through this blog I want to discuss the role of artist justifying using art as a therapeutic tool, guiding society though times of philosophical change and/or hardship. Helping to influence society throughout the eras art has had the power to change the moral and general opinion of an entire society as a whole.\n\nItalian Renaissance:\n\n“Vitruvian Man” Leonardo da Vinci, 1487, Pen and ink with wash over metal point on paper, Gallerie dell’Accademia, Venice, Italy\n\nThe Renaissance was a remarkable time in history. As a fresh new way of thinking spread across Europe the dark days of the Middle Ages came to an end. During this time of “rebirth” society grew hungry for knowledge in all forms. As the independent republic of Florence gained financial and political power the city began to burst at the seems with scholars and philosophers, sparking a huge growth in science, technology and architecture. History.com states that “Their secularism, their appreciation of physical beauty and especially their emphasis on man’s own achievements and expression formed the governing intellectual principle of the Italian Renaissance. This philosophy is known as “humanism.” As a man of many talents, Leonardo da Vinci was arguably the greatest leader in humanism philosophy, even known as the “Renaissance Man” because of his broad spectrum of studies. In my opinion, da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man is a perfect example supporting the idea that artists used their work as a tool or even a moral compass so to speak in order to guide society through the philosophical studies of the time. Vitruvian Man encompasses not only art but the sciences as well. For example, da Vinci’s studies with anatomy became some of the first known medical records in history. According to Biography.com, “like many leaders of Renaissance humanism, da Vinci did not see a divide between science and art. He viewed the two as intertwined disciplines rather than separate ones. He believed studying science made him a better artist.” Personally, I have always loved this piece. The precise mathematical proportions used throughout this piece are very impressive and still used as medical examples of anatomy to this day. Not to mention the attention to detail in the face and muscular tone are done with beautiful detail.\n\nNorthern Renaissance:\n\nJan van Eyck, Arnolfini Wedding, 1434, Oil on wood, 81.8 x 59.7 cm (32 1/4 x 23 1/2 in)\n\nWhile the Italian Renaissance was thriving, art throughout Northern Europe was evolving into it’s own as well. Although similar, there were a few key differences between the art of the north and its Italian neighbors. About arthistory.com describes a few of these differences as “where an Italian artist was apt to consider scientific principles behind composition (i.e., proportion, anatomy, perspective) during the Renaissance, northern artists were more concerned with what their art looked like. Color was of key importance, above and beyond form. And the more detail a northern artist could cram into a piece, the happier he was.” A perfect example of this statement would be a comparison between da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man and the Arnolfini Wedding piece created by artists Jan van Eyck. Vitruvian Man for instance focuses on precise mathematical calculations describing human anatomy, while the Arnolfini Wedding is rich in color contrast and detail. Notice the perfection of detail painted into the mirror hanging on the back wall in the painting. The painted image in the mirror even shows an additional figure standing in the doorway, which some historians believe is a self-portrait of the artist. One could spend hours discussing the amount of symbolic detail throughout this piece. Everything right down to the color of the woman’s dress and the fruit in the window are both symbols of fertility. Everything about this piece is a perfect depiction of Northern Renaissance art. One of the most important things to note about this piece however is not the detail of the work but rather the revolutionary technique used to paint it. Traditionally, Italian Renaissance artists used temperas, frescoes and marbles in their work but primarily due to climate conditions and resource availability, such art medias did not age well in the north. Northern Renaissance artist Jan van Eyck created an entirely new media of painting using a newly created mixture of oil paints able to withstand the harsher climates of the north. The Arnolfini Wedding has gone down in history as one of the most important works of art not only to the north but to the entire Renaissance as a whole. Jan van Eyck’s groundbreaking techniques with oil paintings opened new doors for generations to come and is still used as a guiding force throughout the art world today. Which, is why this piece is a perfect example of an artist using his works to guide society through an era of change. Personally, the Italian and Northern Renaissance have been the most difficult for me to discuss as I cannot seem to hold any real interest in the work. Although the color contrast used in this work is beautiful I just find the subject matter incredibly boring. There is no arguing the fact that the artist was incredibly talented though. The interdict detail right down to the fur lining on the woman dress was created with great skill.\n\nBaroque:\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini ,St. Peter’s Square Colonnades, built from 1656-1667, Baroque Neoclassical Style\n\nThe Baroque era emerged from the Renaissance after 1600’s following the Counter-Reformation and the expansion of scientific knowledge. Described by history-world.org as an artistic style “Without the restraints of the High Renaissance or the subjectiveness of Manneristic painting, the Baroque sought to overawe by its grandeur.” I wanted the focus of this section to discuss various works of Gian Lorenzo Bernini who was largely influenced by the great Michelangelo of the Renaissance era. Although he was a man of many artistic talents, architecture is where Gian Lorenzo Bernini thrived. The style at the time was primarily focused on expressing the success of the Catholic Church while displaying its wealth and power through its use of intensity, light, shadow and color. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was basically as important to Baroque era architecture as Leonardo da Vinci was to the Renaissance era, setting a new standard of style throughout European architecture. One of Bernini’s greatest achievements was his groundbreaking work designing the colonnades inclosing the piazza in front of St. Peters Basilica. Notice the way Bernini uses pattern, lines and space in his designs. Described by metmuseum.org referring to Bernini regarding his own work, “He himself likened the oval space defined by two freestanding colonnades as the mother church extending her arms to embrace the faithful.” Being the first architectural work of its kind, Bernini’s colonnades are the perfect example of an artist leading society into new artistic realms. Having seen this work with my own eyes I can say with certainty that the photos do not do it justice. The colonnades have a commanding presence giving a powerful feeling to the surrounding air around the Vatican.\n\nClassical:\n\nBEETHOVEN – Symphony no. 9 “CHORAL” – Leonard Bernstein (4) Completed in 1824\n\nIn addition to visual arts much of our course studies over the past few months has focused on various composers and musical works throughout history. In this section I wanted to discuss one of the most influential and talented composers not only to the classical era but to history as a whole. Ludwig van Beethoven was described as a musical prodigy from an early age and often compared to legends such as Mozart. Despite never having had a formal education and even losing his hearing in his 20’s Beethoven overcame every challenge life threw at him, composing 9 symphony masterpieces among other shorter works throughout his lifetime. It was his final symphony however which he is most remembered for, symphony No. 9. Originally based from Friedrich von Schiller’s poem ‘Ode to Joy’ written in 1785, it took Beethoven well over a decade to perfect his final symphony. Hyperion Records describes the piece as “a landmark in the history of music, changing the concept of what a symphony could be. The use of solo singers and a chorus in the final movement was revolutionary, and the emotional journey to a glorious vision of a world of love and tolerance paved the way for idealistic symphonies to come.” Also noting that symphony No.9 was the first ever to include a choral movement. Considering that Beethoven’s groundbreaking work basically redefined the entire definition of what a symphony was capable of, its no wonder that I chose his symphony No. 9 as the perfect example to justify artist using music to lead a society into new musical depths. Personally, I have never been a huge fan of classical music and considering the fact that I am tone deaf (haha) I don’t think it’s really even fare for me to have an opinion on such an obvious musical masterpiece. While I do respect symphony No.9 for it’s incredible musical range and ability to convey love and emotion to the listener, classical era music is just not my style. I have a difficult time connecting with symphonies on the emotional level that the listener is intended to.\n\nRomantic:\n\n(I wanted to attach a short clip of the play Hernani but I could not find anything in english)\n\nThe romantic era during the 1800’s was a bustling time in history. The industrial revolution was thriving while everything in society was changing and expanding faster then most could keep track. The romantic era also brought with it huge changes to the world of theater, both technically and artistically. Technically, advancements such as gas lighting, stage props and electricity revolutionized the viewing experience. While artistically, the creative mindset of the era was pushing away from the ideas of Classicism and moving towards folk tales, comedies, tragedies, and stories of personal desires. While there were many successful artist and writers during the romantic era I feel that one stands out above all the rest, a man who’s work helped give strength to the entire romantic era theater movement. Victor Hugo was a French author who was successfully able to use his art as a teaching/guiding tool to guid society through a time of change into a new era. Although Hugo is remembered for masterpieces such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables his most influential and controversial work was a preface to his historical drama, Cromwell in 1827. The work was basically a manifesto rejecting the boring traditional ideas of Classicism and demanding liberty and change by uniting all of the artists in France. Described by Victor Hugo Central as “the principles which revolutionized the literary world of his time.” Due to Hugo’s controversial works, leaders in France attempted to forbid his new play Hernani from ever opening. However, Hugo’s young bohemian style followers ensured that the show must always go on! With power in numbers arguments and physical altercations became a normal occurrence near stage until finally the new era of romantic ideals were widely excepted. I enjoyed reading about the work of Victor Hugo because it is a reminder that hard work can pay off and the elite 1% does not always have the last word. Also, even though I was already familiar with the Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Miserables but I was unaware of the writers story and personal triumphs. This sections research turned out to be quite interesting!\n\nEarly Modern:\n\nPablo Picasso, Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, 1907\n\nThe early Modern era between 1900-1939 gave rise to a revolutionary new abstract style of art called Cubism, influencing almost every media of art from sculpting to architecture throughout the 20th century. One of the two founding fathers behind this movement was Pablo Picasso. Cubism evolved into two primary forms, analytical cubism, which will be our focus in this section and synthetic cubism. Analytical cubism, which was primarily popular during the first decade of the 1900’s is described by Pablo-Picasso.Paintings as “monochrome, relatively unemotional paintings that depict rather uneventful subjects, such as still lives. Many paintings of analytical cubism are faceted, a technique that allows the artist to dissect and reconstruct his subject in a way that depicts its essence rather than its appearance.” Through Picasso’s work with cubism art has been rediscovered and he has managed to break the buriers of only one view point in a painting. I chose to discuss Les Demoiselles d’Avignon in particular because this work is known as one of the most famous examples of cubism, which supports my idea of an artist using art as a tool, guiding society though times of philosophical change. Pablo Picasso pushed society to reevaluate what are truly is and means to each of us. Notice the depth and layers created in this piece through the use of color and breaking traditional shape barriers. Although this may not be a piece I would choose to hang in my home I do enjoy it. I have found that the longer you look at this piece the more it moves and comes to life. Perhaps that was precisely Picasso’s goal all along with cubism.\n\nPersonal Journey:\n\nIn conclusion, regarding this course I can happily say that I truly learned a great deal about art. In 2004 I spent close to two months backpacking Europe where I was able to see a great deal of the works we have discussed over this semester and thanks to everything I learned, I have been able to mentally reevaluate my entire trip with a whole new meaning. Thinking back the to Vatican in particular and standing under that great ceiling, at the time I did enjoy the work but now I can understand it as well. I don’t really understand how this class is going to help me in the long run with completing a wildlife biology degree but it has been fun and has given me a much broader spectrum of knowledge for art.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n1.Italien Renaissance\n\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/italian-renaissance\n\n2.Total History, Vitruvian Man\n\n3.

I have always been a sucker for slapstick comedies such as the movie Dumb and Dumber, which I have seen more times then I will ever admit. There is just something priceless about dumb humor that never gets old! In addition to dumb humor I have also always appreciated films with a more artistic approach. For example, one of my personal all time favorite movies is What Dreams May Come, starring Robin Williams. They way they infused live action paintings with the story line was incredible, driving the imagine and ones emotions wild. I had to quickly mention this movie before moving on to this blogs main focus, Mad Max: Fury Road. I was really excited to feature this movie because it is truly one of the most unique movies I have ever seen both visually and verbally as they use more action to carry the plot then actual dialog.\n\nIts not often that a movie comes along which I feel is worth paying theater prices for but this past summer I anxiously waited for the release of Mad Max: Fury Road, which was unreal in IMAX 3D! Starring Tom Hardy as Max Rockatansky, Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa, Nicholas Hoult as Nux and Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe. Directed by George Miller and screenplay co-written by George Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nick Lathouris. Mad Max: Fury Road is set in a post-apocalyptic barren world torn apart by war and primarily under the control of a tyrannical mad man, Immortan Joe. Holding control over the worlds last bit of water resources in a fortress called “The Citadel”, Joe is betrayed by his commander Imperator Furiosa who struggles to free his slaves. With Joe’s army in close pursuit Imperator Furiosa finds help in the most unlikely of allies, Max Rockatansky and Nux. Max is only known as a rebel loaner who has been robbed of everything dear to him by this broken world, his heart seeks revenge. Nux is known as one of Joe’s loyal “war boys” but struggles with his inner conscious between Joe and the rebels. Regardless of being a science fiction/fantasy film, this movie has many symbolic messages that relate to real world issues. Tor.com states that in addition to “feminism and environmental themes” This “story happens to be about war and its aftermath, slavery, the objectification of human beings, and PTSD.” All things which plague our wold today.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road – Official Main Trailer [HD]\n\nMad Max: Fury Road was wildly successful, raking in almost 155 million in only a few short days and winning 6 oscars on top of countless other awards. Charlize Theron even just recently won the MTV Movie Awards Best Female Performance. Hands down this is the most insanely action packed movie I have ever seen. Although the film really does not have all that much dialog you will never really have time to notice. The little dialog that does exist is more of a support between action scenes and to help carry the plot into the next battle. Between the car chases, explosions, war machines and fighting you will become entranced by the incredible cinematography and desert scenery. Much of this movie was shot in the deserts of Namibia, Australia and South Africa with good old fashion stunts, 150 + vehicles and talented camera work but the 2000 + visual effects is what brings it all together at the end of the day. Tools such as Photogrammetry techniques were used to created the Citadel fortress and aerial photography drones were used to photo scan landscapes. The amount of thought and detail that was put into every scene is overwhelming and impressive, I love the use of color contrasts throughout the movie.\n\nOne of the most stunning camera shots in this movie and one of my personal favorite scenes is the sandstorm battle. The shot begins as a wide-angle panorama, allowing the viewer a feel the power of the storm in its entirety. I feel as though this shot sends a symbolic message to the viewer regarding the battle about to ensue. The heroes are entering the mouth of the beast so to speak. The scene is lead from start to finish with a range of Jump Cuts, fast angle camera shots, sharp and blurred focuses and climaxes of composed music, all of which keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. The lighting throughout the movie is also rather remarkable. As we learned from our course content this scene in particular uses a huge range of lighting techniques. The scene begins using sharp color contrasts and High Key lighting while the interior of the storm is mostly strong colors of reds, oranges and blacks with bold uses of Depths of Field shot between the drivers. As the scene climaxes the music comes to a halt and the director uses a dissolving fade to black screen to lead the viewer out of the storm into the next scene. After a moment of black screen silence the next shot is of a calm desert after the storm and the hero Max arises from the ashes so to speak.\n\nMad Max: Fury Road – Sandstorm Scene\n\nOne of my favorite characters in this movie and in my opinion one of the most underplayed is the flame throwing, guitar playing Doof Warrior. Notice the color contrast between the barren desert and his bright red outfit, I loved it! The war machine he rides on carries a commanding presence in the scene. Backed by a countless amount of speakers and drummers on the back side of the vehicle, his music sets the pace for battle as they charge across the desert. He also becomes entangled in fights with Max himself. Another thing which I loved about this character is that he is able to draw more attention to the original score written for this movies soundtrack. Written by Tom Holkenborg, aka Junkie XL. He is described by Music On Vinyl as “a Grammy nominated and multi-Platinum producer, musician, and composer. Junkie XL’s versatility puts him on the cutting edge of contemporary music, as well as in the vanguard of exciting new film composers.”\n\nMad Max: Fury Road – Behind The Music With Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL\n\nIt goes without saying that the costumes and make-up in this film are absolutely incredible. They way in which they used color and prosthetics with every character the viewer is able to tell villain from hero without even any dialog. Notice the picture of Immortan Joe below, the use of metal on the face mask and red in the eyes shouts villain to the viewer.\n\nWrapping up this blog on an emotional note I wanted to point out what I thought was an emotional climax setting in the movie. One of the only low action scenes in the movie this scene pulls the viewer in emotionally and allows them to feel the pain and struggle felt by the people. The moment in which Imperator Furiosa is at long last reunited with her tribe only to realizes that “home”, “The Green Place” has long since been lost. I can only imagine the overwhelming grief she must have felt, knowing everything she just went through to rescue the enslaved women and escape The Citadel. A moment of utter hopelessness, all of it was for nothing, where does she turn from here? Graphically, the scene is beautiful. As she staggers across the barren sand and the music intensifies you can feel her pain and fear. The use of sunlight and shadows is brilliant. Ultimately however, this movie leaves a message of hope and empowerment to the viewer. Fight for humanity, fight against ternary and conquer evil.\n\nSoundtrack:\n\nhttp://www.watertower-music.com/releases/release.php?title=madmax-furyroad\n\nWorks Cited:\n\n1.

Here’s Why it’s Also Important”\n\nHaving grown up about 100 yards away from a beach on the Puget Sound I have always had a close bond with the sea. As a child I would fall asleep with the window open on hot summer nights to the sound of the waves dragging back and forth across the sand. Occasionally, the sea lions would make camp on the beach for several weeks at a time and I could hear them bark and sing through the night under the stars. There is something uniquely special about sea above all else in nature. Filled with mystery and constantly changing, the sea is able to touch a part of our soul and take our imaginations into the depths of its waters. In this blog I want to focus on two of my favorite Pacific Northwest artists who I feel are able to capture the raw emotion and surrealism of the sea through their work.\n\nSeveral years ago on a warm summer Seattle day I was taking a stroll through Pikes Place Market and I remember seeing a striking collection of surreal and vibrant paintings. This was the first time I had seen Tim Wistrom’s art. Originally born in Germany into a military family, Wistrom lived just about everywhere as a child. The Pacific Northwest captured his heart however and he has made the enchantments of its wild landscapes the focus of his surreal post-apocalyptic art work. He became known to locals as “the artists that paints Seattle underwater.” Wistrom’s style is strictly old school, steering clear of computer graphic design and airbrushing he uses brushes to free-hand paint with acrylic paints on canvas. Which, in my opinion makes him an even more impressive artist. Wistrom began painting almost 45 years ago and his career is still going strong, touring art festivals around the country year round. One of the things I love most about these works is that it can take each viewer into different worlds of imagination. Wistrom was quoted as asking his fans to “Look at my paintings with a sense of humor and creativity, as my goal is to spark your imagination. Consider a world gone by and a world yet to be. Just imagine!”\n\nThis is one of the first pieces Of Wistrom’s I ever saw and to this day still one of my favorites. It is a rather simple painting at first glance but I love the way he layered the depths of the water with purples and blues as the city fades into the abyss. This piece certainly captures his ideas of new worlds rising from ruins.\n\nTim Wistrom, Save The Humans, 1989\n\nAn absolute beautiful piece with a few of Seattle’s most iconic landmarks. Everything about this painting from the Space Needle to the monorail and the jumping salmon making their voyage from the sea shouts Pacific Northwest. A few people I have spoken to find this piece a little spooky but I think it is very peaceful, Just look at what a thriving ecosystem has taken over the city. I would like to think that long after human’s time here on earth is through that mother nature will be able to thrive once again, she does not need us after all…\n\nTim Wistrom, Urban Renewal, 1991\n\nThis piece really impresses me on many levels. I love the way Wistrom was able to capture the moonlight dancing through the sea, both on the surface and under. Also the depth perspective shown with the various sea life. At first my eye was immediately drawn to the diving see lion then the trail of bubbles from its dive leads your eye up the painting to the breaching killer wale in the moonlight. This painting sparks the imagine as to how this world has changed from modern day Seattle. Notice the icebergs, one can’t help but wonder about the poles shifting, changing the climate entirely. I have walked through this area of Pikes Place Market countless times, its fun to imagine this old cobblestone street covered by a new world of sand and barnacles.\n\nTim Wistrom, Fresh Fish, 1992\n\nI am such a fan of Tim Wistrom’s work that I had trouble narrowing down which pieces to discuss. I wanted to add these two additional pieces because anyone from the Pacific Northwest knows that one of the favorite past times for locals is to go on beach walks. We love to comb the sand for beach glass, driftwood, pretty rocks or anything else the sea choose to give us that day. Being on the beach and close to the sea can cure just about anything that ales the soul. When looking at both of these pieces I imagine a new world retaken by the sea with only small pieces left behind like bits of beach glass. The bears look calm and happy on their walk as do the small shore birds looking for bites to eat. I also love the sunset colors used in both of these pieces, they just seem to glow.\n\nTim Wistrom, Bear Necessities\n\nTim Wistrom, Final Catch\n\nDale Chihuly, famous for his one of a kind glass work is the second artist I want to discuss. A Pacific Northwest native, Chihuly was born in 1941 and began his artistic studies at the University of Washington. It was not until after he graduated the UW however that he received the further necessary training in Venice to began his journey with creating glass art. Chihuly is the king of his craft, breaking ground into an entire media almost untouched. His art over the past several decades has been so imaginative and successful that according to chihuly.com “his work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.” All of these successes were also in addition to co-founding a glass school in Washington in 1971, which today tourists can even visit and watch new generations of glass artists create new works. I remember going once as a child and being amazed by the large glowing fiery orbs of glass being formed. Chihuly himself said “Glassblowing is a very spontaneous, fast medium, and you have to respond very quickly. “Being a Pacific Northwest native, Chihuly also grew up with a love for the sea and combing the beach on long walks. It was from this favorite past time passion that he was inspired to create an entire series called “Seaform”. “I love to go to the ocean and walk along the beach. If you work with hot glass and its natural properties it begins to look like something that came from the sea.” –Chihuly\n\nI absolutely love this large spiraling tower of glass. The first moment I saw it I could not help but think of crashing waves on the beach. The way in which Chihuly uses the perfect amount of white accents as if it were sea foam in a crashing wave. Also, the darker and lighter blues to represent the shadows of the sun coming through the water as it breaks on the sand.\n\nDale Chihuly, Sealife Tower, 2011, 16 x 12 x 12′, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Seattle, installed 2012\n\nAnother one of my favorite Chihuly pieces, this work reminds me of sea kelp, sand dollars and starfish and the bustling life of sea creatures in tide pools. If you have ever gone for a beach walk on the Puget Sound during low tide you would know all too well about the hundreds of tide pools temporarily left behind by the sea. I have always been amazed how one tiny tide pool can support an entire micro ecosystem. If you look closely enough into a tide pool you will find a hidden world of sand dollars still half buried in the sand, starfish and baby bullhead fish seeking shelter under a rock or abandoned shell. I feel like this piece perfectly captures all of that. The way the light shines through the glass in the same way the sun shines through seaweed and kelp in the sea. Even the textures in the glass remind me of jellyfish floating about.\n\nDale Chihuly, Toyama Persian Ceiling, 2015\n\nWhat would a walk on the beach be without millions upon millions of tiny seashells to comb through am I right? Certainly, no two seashells in nature are alike and Chihuly is once again able to perfectly capture that through his art. The attention to detail on this piece is stunning, with spiraling curves and the uses of lighter browns against the creamy whites you can almost feel the texture through the photo.\n\nDale Chihuly, Misty White Seaform, 1982, 9 x 12 x 10\n\nWorks Cited\n\n1. timwistrom.com\n\nArtists primary personal website\n\n2. https://www.pinterest.com/hobotoast/artist-tim-wistrom/\n\nPinterest, Artist: Tim Wistrom\n\n3.

With our country becoming entangled in WWI in 1914 we were fast tracked into industrialism while furthering technological advances in war weaponry. The world of music and art was evolving and on the verge of big historical changes as well. Also, architectural masterpieces like skyscrapers were being erected across New York and even Chicago. Life was changing as we knew it and thanks to the growing popularity and developments in photography all of these changes were being documented for the history books. This era (in my opinion) produced some of the greatest works of photography of all time. Only roughly a decade after WWI was the market crash of 1929 which essentially thrusted the country into the Great Depression and with the rise of Hitler our country was at war again. Once again, our ideals of every day life was shaken, music and art were evolving, social ideals on race were changing and women left their homes to work while the men were at war. After almost half a century of chaos, its no wonder that as the country calmed down into 1950s we focused on the happy ideals of the “Leave it to Beaver” family life. The early modern era produced some of the 20th centuries most influential artists, actors and musicians. In this blog post I wanted to highlight a few of my personal favorite African American musicians and discuss the importance of their achievements personally and socially.\n\nBessie Smith (July, 1892 or April, 1894 – September 26, 1937) is remembered as one of the greatest jazz and blues vocalist of the early modern era. So popular in fact that by the end of the 1920’s Bessie was the highest paid African American singer of her time and acquired the nick name “Empress of the blues”. Smith had a rough start start in life however, having to overcome the challenges of poverty, the death of both of her parents and several siblings at a young age and the raciest social ideals of the time. Smiths’s musical style portrayed the social hardships of being an African American woman during this time, singing about love, jealousy, race and even voodoo. New World Encyclopedia states that Smith’s “traditional black sound cost her early record contracts”. But smith became a force to be reckoned with, breaking sales records, smashing social barriers and raciest ideals. She proved to “recording executives that jazz and blues, so-called race-music, was a viable commercial enterprise.” It’s hard to imagine in todays society reading about how Smith had to have Columbia records buy her a personal train car for music tours because due to the insanely twisted social ideals of the time, she was not allowed in the “white-only” first class car. Also, in 1927 Ku Klux Klan members attempted to vandalize one of Smith’s tents during her performance. Smith reportedly chased them off singly handy shouting “Pick up them sheets and run!” She even returned to finish the show after chasing them away. She was a beacon of strength for minorities for generations to come, influencing future artist such as Billie Holiday, Mahalia Jackson, Nina Simone and Janis Joplin. In 1923 Smith signed with Columbia records and recored her most successful track “Downhearted Blues”. The wildly popular track pushed her career into the fast lane, working with several other famous jazz artists of time including Louis Armstrong. In 1929 Smith even made a film appearance. Eventually the fast paced life of fame caught up to Smith. She was rumored to be reckless with her money and drinking, accompanied by terrible temper. In addition to these downfalls, Smith was was hard hit financially by the Great Depression. On September 26,1937, Smith was involved in a terrible car accident, from which she passed away a few weeks later due to complications.\n\nBessie Smith, “St. Louis Blues” 1929\n\nBessie Smith, Louis Armstrong- Sobbin Hearted Blues (1925)\n\nBeing a fan of both Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong I wanted to add an extra clip of them making music together. I also loved the way New World Encyclopedia described their successes together as musicians of the era. “Smith, and above all cornet player Louis Armstrong, ushered in the Jazz Age, an era that introduced African American music to mainstream America. The Smith-Armstrong sessions are considered classic collaborations of two pioneering musicians at the peak of their artistic powers.”\n\nLouis Armstrong was born in 1901 in New Orleans. Raised in poverty by a single mother he was never able to finish his schooling. At the age of 11 however, he got into a bit of trouble during a New Years Eve celebration for firing a gun into the night air and was sent to the Jones Home for Colored Waifs. Ultimately, the experience was a blessing in disguise because this is where Armstrong received proper music instruction. In the blink of an eye Armstrong’s career took off, by the mid 20’s he was recording with some of the most famous blues singers of the era, including Bessie Smith. Armstrong’s talent seemed to know no bounds, over time his talents evolved and revolutionized music of the 20th century. According to knowsouthernhistory.net biography “Armstrong abandoned the traditional collective improvisation of New Orleans-style jazz and almost singlehandedly transformed the music from a group art into an art form for the individual soloist. Having switched from the cornet to the trumpet during this period, Armstrong also set new standards for trumpeters, extending the playable range of the instrument with impressive high notes.” Not only was Armstrong of the first musicians to record the scat style of singing but he also appeared in more then 20 movies becoming the first African American to regularly appear in films. Like Bessie Smith, Armstrong faced many challenges regarding social racism. According to louisarmstronghouse.org “Unfortunately, due to racism in the movie industry, Louis and other black musicians were often limited to walk-on roles (appear on screen, perform a musical number, exit screen) so that when the film was distributed in the American south, the segments with the black musicians could be deleted without disturbing the continuity of the story.” I chose this certain clip below because of the spoken intro, I think it gives great perspective into what kind of man Louis Armstrong was. A message with importance that transcends time.\n\nLouis Armstrong, What a Wonderful World 1967\n\nAs the final focus of this blog I wanted to talk about Robert Johnson. Born in Mississippi, he was only on this earth for 27 short years (1911-1938) but during that time managed to revolutionize the world of blues and lay down the foundation of rock n’ roll for decades to come. The Robert Johnson Blues Foundation perfectly describes Johnson’s style during such a chaotic era. “Never had the hardships of the world been transformed into such a poetic height; never had the blues plumbed such an emotional depth. Johnson took the intense loneliness, terrors and tortuous lifestyle that came with being an African-American in the South during the Great Depression, and transformed that specific and very personal experience into music of universal relevance and global reach.” Johnson’s short life was surrounded with mystery. Legend has it that during his early years Johnson’s musical talent was mediocre at best but after having taken a trip to the crossroads of HWY 49 and 61 he struck a “deal with the devil” himself, selling his soul for a guitar. Miraculously, Johnson is said to have returned from his trip a few weeks later with a new found talent and sound, changing the world of music. Even the circumstances of Johnson’s death was shrouded with conspiracy. According to Rollingstone, Johnson became a little too flirty with a roadhouse owners wife which resulted in his whiskey bottle being poisoned ending his life.\n\nRobert Johnson, Hellhound On My Trail, 1937\n\nI Believe I’ll Dust My Broom [Remastered] ROBERT JOHNSON (1936) Delta Blues Guitar Legend\n\nWorks Cited\n\n1. http://www.biography.com/people/louis-armstrong-9188912#ambassador-satch\n\nLouis Armstrong Biography, Biography.com Editors\n\n2. http://louisarmstronghouse.org/index.php\n\nLouis Armstrong Museum Collection\n\n3. http://www.biography.com/people/bessie-smith-9486520#the-empress-of-the-blues\n\nBessie Smith Biography, Biography.com Editors\n\n4. http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Bessie_Smith\n\nNew World Encyclopedia, Bessie Smith\n\n5.http://www.robertjohnsonbluesfoundation.org/biography/\n\nRobert Johnson Blues Foundation\n\n6. http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/robert-johnson/biography\n\nRollingStone online, Robert Johnson, Biography\n\n7. http://www.biography.com/people/robert-johnson-9356324#career-highlights\n\nBiography.com Robert Johnson\n\nThroughout history art has had a powerful influence over society. Having the ability to help sway public opinion regarding religion, morals, and transfers of power between the upper and middle classes, sometimes even helping lead to revolution. In this blog I will discuss examples between Rococo versus Neoclassical art and how the growing economic power of the middle class helped lead to moral changes within society.\n\nArt and architecture during the first half of the 17th century was primarily filled with Rococo style. Characterized by nature settings, pastel colors, romance, soft/curved lines with intricate detail and showing the simplistic side of life. During the later half of the 17th century however, archeological discoveries helped influence a new way of thinking in society. Focusing on higher moral virtues and good deeds, art/architecture was lead into the Neoclassical style era. Unlike Rococo, art during this time often had an agenda for the masses, especially during the French Revolution. Telling stories of heroes and showing examples of selfless acts for the greater good of society.\n\nJean-Honoré Fragonard, The Swing, 1767, oil on canvas, 81 x 64.2 cm (Wallace Collection, London)\n\nThe Swing is a perfect example of Rococo art and the simplistic care-free attitude of the upper class during the time. Although this piece appears innocent and simple at first glance its content was the center of controversy. Ultimately helping the shift into Neoclassical style art with higher standards of moral behavior. For example, the Khan Academy summarizes this piece describing “Two lovers have conspired to get an older fellow to push the young lady in the swing while her lover hides in the bushes. Their idea is that—as she goes up in the swing, she can part her legs, and her lover can get a tantalizing view up her skirt.” As one can imagine, such behavior would have been incredibly taboo during this time period, hence it being condemned by philosophers calling for higher morals within society. As this newer way of thinking gained more ground among the middle class, rococo style even became known as the “embodiment of the moral decline of the French leadership.” Aesthetically, there is a lot I love about this piece. The use of pink and blue pastel colors against the fading/ textured background is beautiful. Also, the subject matter just makes me laugh a little.\n\nThe Oath of the Horatii, Oil on Canvas,1784, Musée du Louvre at Paris\n\nThis piece is a perfect example of Neoclassical era art and how art during this time portrayed stories of honer, virtue and real life situations conveying emotion. This piece depicts the story of three Horatii brothers being sworn into battle to fight the Curiatii despite the ties of family and the devastated women who love them. A clear example of Neoclassical art emphasizing the self-sacrifice of war and the honer behind such an act. A few other things I would like to point out in this piece are the use of linear lines, shadows and darker colors, which are typical of Neoclassical era art.\n\nJacques-Louis David, The Intervention of the Sabine Women, 1799, Oil on canvas, 12 feet, 8 inches x 17 feet and 3/4 of an inch or 3.85 x 5.22 m (Musée du Louvre, Paris)\n\nAs a final example of Neoclassical art I wanted to share this famous piece, The Intervention of the Sabine. This painting depicts a powerful message about the costs of war and forces the viewer to really ask, is all the bloodshed worth losing what is most important to us? Hersilia is the dominating focus on the canvas, literally throwing herself between her father and her husband. With the mens children and grandchildren by her side she demands a stop the bloodshed for the greater good of family and society. There are several important points to be noted in this painting. The Khan academy notes how her white dress stands out from the battle scene symbolizing righteousness and purity. I also think its interesting that the artists, for the first time chose to use a woman as the centerpiece of his work, showing what was described as “a recognition of the power of women as peacemakers.” I added the picture of the close up because I wanted to note the attention to detail and emotion on the women’s faces. That in itself tells a great deal of the story. You get a sense for their feelings of anger and hopelessness of the entire situation. Personally, I really enjoy this piece both artistically and morally as it confronts a subject that transcends time. Hundreds of years later and we are still senselessly killing each other over possessions. Even with masterpieces such as this with the stories they tell, one cannot help but wonder if we will ever learn.\n\n1.

I found this very helpful in noticing new detail to the work.\n\nI struggled with how to go about writing this blog as I am not a huge fan of Renaissance era artwork. I spent at least an hour scouring online resources trying to choose a suiting piece of artwork which I found to be mentally stimulating. After a bit of frustration I realized, even though I may not be the biggest fan of renaissance era artwork I am always interested in intriguing historical conspiracy theories. So, who better to write about then the man who is behind some of the most famous controversial conspiracy theories in history? Of course, non other then the “renaissance man” himself, Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was born on April 15,1452, in Vinci, Italy near Florence. As history will show, his talents showed no bounds. Not only was he a dedicated student of the sciences but he was also an architect, inventor, engineer and most famously known for painting masterpieces such as “The Last Supper” and the “Mona Lisa”. Despite being born a bastard and receiving little formal education while being raised by his father da Vinci has gone down in history as one of the most influential people to have ever lived, both artistically and scientifically. A man so far ahead of his time, da Vinci’s studies of anatomy on both humans and animals are some of the first known medical records in history. According to Biography.com, “Like many leaders of Renaissance humanism, da Vinci did not see a divide between science and art. He viewed the two as intertwined disciplines rather than separate ones. He believed studying science made him a better artist.” A perfect example of this statement would be da Vinci’s sketch of “Vitruvian Man”. Notice the attention to detail of human anatomy in the sketch. Da Vinci’s fascination with the study of the human body lead into dissections on cadavers. When the church learned of this work they condemned his actions as they were illegal. This would be only one of many divides between the Roman catholic church, the Pope and da Vinci. With his obsession of the scientific world rather then the church da Vinci also said, “Nature is the source of all true knowledge. She has her own logic, her own laws, she has no effect without cause nor invention without necessity”.\n\nAs a young teenager in Florence, da Vinci was able to acquire an apprenticeship working under the famous artists Andrea del Verrocchio. It was through this apprenticeship da Vinci’s fate as the ultimate “renaissance man” was set in motion. During his apprenticeship da Vinci was exposed to new medias of study such as engineering and architecture. Which, in turn lead into his life long obsession for knowledge and the creation of thousands of pages of workbooks and art pieces. During this time da Vinci was also introduced to the ruling family of Florence, the Medici’s. The Medici family arose to power after acquiring wealth through textile trade and creating the Medici Bank. Using their wealth they were able to gain political power and carry Florence into the ago of humanism, allowing artists such as da Vinci to prosper through the Renaissance era. Lorenzo Medici’s powerful political influences lead da Vinci to commission an art piece for the Duke of Milan where he would later create on of the most famous and controversial works of art in history, ‘The Last Supper’.\n\n“The Last Supper” is a complex masterpiece not only artistically but also religiously. The work was created on a dinning hall wall in the monastery of Milan’s Santa Maria delle Grazie about 1495, taking almost 3 years to complete. At the time da Vinci was experimenting with new oil and tempura paint formulas, which ultimately did not age well in combination with the location of the wall exposed to harsh weather conditions. The scene of this masterpiece depicts Jesus confronting his twelve Apostles at Passover dinner, “one of you shall betray me.” Each detail of this piece holds deep meaning into the emotion and relationships of what is taking place between everyone portrayed. Biography.com explains “The range of facial expressions and the body language of the figures around the table bring the masterful composition to life.” While History.com points out that “one of the painting’s stellar features is each Apostle’s distinct emotive expression and body language. Its composition, in which Jesus is centered among yet isolated from the Apostles, has influenced generations of painters.” Jesus is the center piece of this work, however Judas is a very important link to understanding what is taking place here. As you can observe in the close up above the details surrounding Judas clearly hints at his betrayal. Visual-arts-cork.com explains how Judas is “grasping a small bag, no doubt symbolizing the 30 pieces of silver he has been paid to betray Jesus; he has also knocked over the salt pot – another symbol of betrayal. His head is also positioned in a lower position than anyone in the picture, and is the only person left in shadow.” In more recent years, “The Last Supper” has become shadowed with conspiracy theories (which is where I become interested). The conspiracy theories have come to light most famously through the best selling book The Da Vinci Code (2003) by Dan Brown. The book highlights the existence of a secret society called the Priory Of Sion in which da Vinci was thought to be a part of. This secret society was tasked with protecting the truth that Jesus and Mary were actually married and had a child. It is said that the Priory of Sion was ordered to protect the holy bloodline (still present today through the French royal bloodline) and the true secrets of the Holy Grail. Obviously if such theories had any weight to them the very foundation of the Catholic Church and 2000 years of religious history would be shaken to the core, theoretically creating cause for the distance between the Roman Catholic Church and da Vinci. The conspiracy theory states that da vinci left encrypted clues through his notebooks and masterpieces the “Mona Lisa” and “The Last Supper”.\n\nPersonally, the idea of Dan Brown’s conspiracies is really the only interest I have in these works of art. While I do respect the skill taken to create such a masterpiece and acknowledge the fact that Leonardo da Vinci was a brilliant man hundreds of years ahead of his time, I still can’t seem to stay interested enough to write about it in depth. I loved seeing everything and learning about it first hand however. I had an incredible time backpacking Europe and I truly enjoyed my visit to Florence. It was fascinating to wander through the da Vinci museum and see his notebooks with my own eyes, however that’s as far as the interest really goes for me.\n\nWorks Cited:\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/renaissance-reformation/high-ren-florence-rome/leonardo-da-vinci/v/leonardo-da-vinci-last-supper-1495-98\n\nhttp://www.biography.com/people/leonardo-da-vinci-40396\n\nhttp://www.history.com/topics/leonardo-da-vinci\n\nhttp://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/renaissance-paintings.htm\n\nhttp://www.boldsky.com/insync/pulse/2013/da-vinci-conspiracy-fifteen-things-to-know-035008.html#slide18168"
