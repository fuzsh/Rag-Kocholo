        "text": "Okay, the first thing you need to know about this current exhibit at the Getty Center (the one high on the hill) is that you will not see any sculptures actually made by or attributed to the famous 15th century Italian artist, inventor and creator, Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nRather, this impressive exhibition places a special focus on inspiration and invention.\n\nBorn April 15, 1452, Anchiano, near Vinci, Republic of Florence [now in Italy], the son of a landowner and a peasant, Leonardo da Vinci received training in painting, sculpture, and mechanical arts as an apprentice to Andrea del Verrocchio. He died May 2, 1519, Cloux [now Clos-LucÃ©], France.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was an Italian polymath, that is to say he was a person with superior intelligence whose expertise spanned a significant number of different subject areas. His vast breadth of interests and talents included: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist and writer. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance man, a man whose unquenchable curiosity was equaled only by his powers of invention.\n\nDa Vinci was an apprentice in the studio of Verrocchio where sculpture, as well as painting, was an everyday activity. Records show that he worked as a sculptor.\n\nWhile there exists ample evidence, in historical accounts as well as in the artist”™s letters and notebooks, that da Vinci created works of sculpture and received several monumental commissions, there are no surviving works that can be definitively attributed to him. Hence nowhere can you see a large work of sculpture that has been positively identified as being the work of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nConsidering it is believed that the Vatican keeps a vast majority of da Vinci”™s treasures under lock and key, naturally it is always exciting when we can catch a glimpse of some of this great man”™s great works, even just sketches or plans of sculptures, if not the sculptures themselves.\n\nWhen you first enter the West Pavilion of The Getty Museum, you are confronted by a massive image of a prancing horse representing Il Cavallo, the huge 24-foot bronze equine statue Leonardo da Vinci planned but never saw to its completion. Commissioned in 1482 by Lodovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, in honor of his father Francesco, the massive 70-ton bronze monument took Leonardo seventeen years of research and planning. When the full-scale clay model was finally ready to be cast in a single operation in 1499, all the necessary bronze was taken to make cannons for an imminent war against the King of France.\n\nDa Vinci’s plan for the largest equestrian statue in the world, if completed, would have probably been his greatest legacy, possibly more famous than his painting The Last Supper or any of his other artistic creations.\n\nNevertheless, this exhibition includes various drawings by the artist of his inventions and planning (many of which are borrowed from the collection of Queen Elizabeth II) as well as one of his paintings, of which there are fewer than a dozen in the world. The drawings highlight his working method of sketching ideas and notes for his artistic compositions and inventive devices, which, sadly, have not survived.\n\nAbove all, this exhibition is a showcase for the recent restoration of three monumental bronze statues from 1511 by da Vinci”™s younger colleague, Giovan Francesco Rustici. Removed for conservation from the faÃ§ade of the Baptistery in Florence several years ago, these magnificent pieces had never been seen outside of the city until their display late last year at Atlanta”™s High Museum of Art.\n\nThe trio of giant bronze statues, depicting John the Baptist, a Pharisee and a Levite, are impressive indeed, with their expressive gazes, gestures and draped clothing.\n\nLeonardo and Rustici worked closely together and Rustici was immersed in Leonardo’s studio practice. Because of their collaborations and similar aesthetic, Rustici’s work is considered the best echo of Leonardo’s lost activity as a sculptor.\n\nThe depiction of the three elegant and somber figures, the variety of their drapery and their anatomical realism give credence to an opinion related by Giorgio Vasari that “Leonardo worked at the group with his own hand, or that he at the least assisted Rustici with counsel and good judgment.”\n\nIn the absence of any securely attributed sculptures by Leonardo himself, these works, along with his surviving drawings, give us a glimpse of Leonardo’s sculptural accomplishments.Â This exhibition is worth seeing for the trio of monumental bronzes alone, even if they are not by the legendary artist himself.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci and the Art of Sculpture: Inspiration and Invention is organized by the High Museum of Art, Atlanta in association with the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. The exhibition is supported by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and Humanities. The J. Paul Getty Museum is also grateful for the support of the Istituto Italiano di Cultura and the Italian Consulate General, Los Angeles.\n\nThe exhibition runs until June 20th 2010\n\nLEONARDO DA VINCI AND THE ART OF SCULPTURE: Inspiration and Invention\n\nThe J.
