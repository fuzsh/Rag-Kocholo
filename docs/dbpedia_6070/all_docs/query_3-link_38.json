        "text": "LEONARDO - ARTIST\n\n1452 Leonardo was born on April 15 in a house in Anchiano, near Vinci. He was the first male child of Ser Piero Antonio, a Florentine notary, (who later had nine other sons and two females) and Caterina.\n\n1469 Leonardo's father shows some drawings of his son to the artist Andrea Del Verrocchio. Leonardo began the apprenticeship in the Verrocchio atelier. He learns the artistic techniques of painting, sculpture and the principles of mechanics and engineering.\n\n1470-1481 During these years he collaborates with Verrocchio at the Baptism of Christ, portrays Ginevra de’ Benci, paints the Annunciation, begins the Adoration of the Magi.\n\n1472 On this date, Leonardo was registered in the Guild of Santa Lucia, but remained with Verrocchio at least until 1476.\n\n1482 Lorenzo de’Medici, known as the Magnificent, lord of Florence, sends Leonardo to Milan to spread Florentine art and culture in Italy. He was accepted at the court of Ludovico il Moro: here he exhibited his skills as an engineer, painter and architect.\n\n1482-1498 Far from Florence, Leonardo began the Milanese period during which he paints the Virgin of the Rocks and studies architectural solutions for the castles of Milan and Pavia\n\n1494 Leonardo frescoes the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan with the Last Supper.\n\n1499-1501 The French army invades Milan and Leonardo begins to travel between the cities of Italy. During these years he is in Mantua and Venice, where he is called to design canalizations of the Brenta river to make it navigable.\n\n1501 He returns to Florence to find the Medici family, but while he was absent, the Medici had been driven out of Florence and the Republic had been proclaimed. The greatest artist in Florence was considered Michelangelo.\n\n1502 Duke Cesare Borgia, known as Valentino, hired Leonardo as an architect and military engineer. Valentino, son of Pope Alexander VI, was one of the fiercest tyrants of the moment (inspired by the Prince of Machiavelli) and occupied Leonardo in engineering work for the continuous military campaigns he undertook. He will travel throughout Italy (thanks to a letter issued by Valentino in person with which he can go to every papal domain), curiously carrying the portrait of the Mona Lisa.\n\n1503 The Florentine Republic instructs Leonardo to decorate the Salone dei Cinquecento in Palazzo Vecchio together with Michelangelo. He chooses to fresco the Battle of Anghiari, which today is covered by Vasari's frescoes from 1563.\n\n1507 He returns to Milan, at the request of the French marshal Charles d'Amboise, where he remains until 1513 and is appointed \"painter and engineer of the king of France\". In fact, in this historical period Milan is under French rule.\n\n1513-1514 Accept the invitation to go to Rome in the service of Giuliano de Medici. He works for the reclamation of the Pontine Marshes, studies fossils, and still devotes himself to mechanics and engineering.\n\n1516 Giuliano de'Medici, his last protector and patron, dies. Leonardo accepted the invitation of Francis I, the new king of France, to join his court\n\n1517 Leonardo is in Amboise, in the Château de Cloux, with the role of the first painter, engineer and architect of the King.\n\n1519 Leonardo died on 2 May at the age of 67 in Amboise in France. The will that left us on April 23, 1519 foresaw that all his manuscripts (which today are largely called Codes) and various drawings were received by his pupil Francesco Melzi, while the paintings that were in his French studio (including the Mona Lisa , La Leda, San Gerolamo) were received by Gian Giacomo Caprotti known as Salai. After Salai died, in 1525, the dispersion of Leonardo's legacy officially began."
