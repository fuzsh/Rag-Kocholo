        "text": "Verrocchio: Sculptor and Painter of Renaissance Florence, on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, until January 12, 2020\n\nYou might have seen the bronze losing its hardness and becoming marvelously delicate in the direction of plumpness . . . it looked bright and free . . . though it was fixed solidly on a pedestal, it deceived one into thinking that it possessed the power to fly. It was filled with joy even to laughter, the glance from the eyes was ardent and gentle…\n\nCallistratus, Athenian poet\n\nThe charming Verrochio’s little angel, Putto with a Dolphin (photo), may evoke an ancient bronze sculpture of Eros, described by the classical Greek poet Callistratus in a book belonging to the Medici family in Florence. Verrocchio read Latin but did not read Greek, but Poliziano or an other humanist in the Medici circle may have discussed the project with him and translated the relevant text. This is maybe the most popular work by Andrea del Verrocchio because of its location in the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. We can see this gentle putto at the National Gallery of Art (NGA) in Washington DC in the exhibition Verrocchio: Sculptor and Painter of Renaissance Florence, the first-ever monographic exhibition in the United States on Andrea del Verrocchio (c. 1435–1488), the Italian Renaissance painter, sculptor, and teacher, master of masters. The exhibition is curated by Andrew Butterfield, an internationally recognized expert on the artist and the President of Andrew Butterfield Fine Arts. This exhibition brings together some 50 of Verrocchio’s masterpieces in painting, sculpture, goldsmith and drawing along with those of other artists who were his pupils such as Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli or Pietro Perugino.\n\nThe term putto (putti in plural) designates the nude, winged children that so often accompany more weighty subjects in ancient art: they personify spirits of various kind (such as the spirit of love, in which case we call them cupids) usually depicted in a gay and playful way. They were reintroduced during the Early Renaissance, both in their original identity and as child angels.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Putto with a Dolphin. (1465…?) Museo di Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nPutto with a Dolphin was originally commissioned for a center of a fountain for the Medici villa in Careggi outside Florence (now a hospital). This joyful, winged nude infant balancing on one foot and clutching a spirited dolphin, is the first sculptural work of the Renaissance that for its spiral design achieves that all views of equal significance. The statue conveys a sense of twisting movement and incipient life, as the child extends his wings and turns his head to the right, counterbalancing the weight on his left foot and the body of the wriggling animal. It seems that the figure revolves before our eyes.\n\nThis pose anticipates the serpentine figures of High Renaissance painters and sculptors. In the mid-16th century Putto with a Dolphin was reinstalled on top of a fountain designed for the courtyard of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence (the original is now kept in the Palazzo Vecchio museum and now has traveled to Washington DC; the present fountain figure is a copy).\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and assistants, Tobias and the Angel (1470). The National Gallery, London. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nWhen I was a teenager I used to leaf through art books and one of the paintings that remained indelibly imprinted in my memory was Tobias and the Angel (1470), painted by Verrocchio and Leonardo da Vinci. Its colors, the beauty of the two figures, its graceful movements, they seem weightless; the finesse of the faces, the humanity and the goodness of the figures, the perfection of the drawing…; it reflects this simplicity of the early Renaissance, where everything is just insinuated, where everything is yet to be discovered, without the excesses and subsequent complexities, where color is like a breeze and the line is agile and graceful. It seemed to me then that was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. I looked at it again and again. I guess it influenced me to devote myself to Art History and enhanced my interest and fascination for the Italian Renaissance that still remains intact. I was not disappointed at all when I first saw the painting, housed at the National Gallery in London, years later shortly after finishing my studies. A great pleasure to meet it again on the other side of the Atlantic ocean.\n\nThis painting illuminates the biblical story of the blind old man Tobias, a merchant and devout Jew who sent his son, also called Tobias, to collect a debt in Media. The youth was accompanied by his dog and by the archangel Raphael. During the journey, on the banks of the Tigris River, Raphael indicated Tobias to extract the heart, liver, and gall from a fish as a cure for his father’s blindness. Tobias and Raphael’s journey was very popular in the late fifteenth century when devotion to the Archangel, known as Saint Raphael, was promoted by a number of confraternities dedicated to him. The story culminates with Tobias’s return home where he used the fish organs to cure his father.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and assistants, Tobias and the Angel (1470). The National Gallery, London. On view at the NGA, Washington DC\n\nIn the painting, Verrocchio and Leonardo represented the moment when Tobias carries a fish that he has gutted, held by a string; Raphael holds its organs in a little box, explaining they could be used as ointment to cure blindness. Tobias steps forward gallantly, his arm entwined with that of the angel, all sweetness. The sculptural quality of the figures’s faces and the lavish detail of their garments reveal the hand of Verrocchio, while the young Leonardo, who was learning at the master’s workshop, may have painted the gutted fish painted like a minute still life and the small dog at the feet of the angel. If so, this would be perhaps the first extant example of a painting with input by Leonardo.\n\nAndrea del Verrochio, Leonardo da Vinci and assistants. Tobias and the Angel (1470). The National Gallery, London. On view at the NGA, Washington DC\n\nAndrea di Michele Cione, called Verrocchio, was born in 1435 in Florence and died in 1488 in Venice. His family lived in the parish of Sant’ Ambrogio. Andrea was the fifth of the eight children born to Michele di Francesco Cione, a maker of bricks and tiles who later became a tax collector, and his first wife Gemma. The family was not wealthy and was of the artisan class, one brother was a textile worker, a sister married a woolmaker, older brother was a monk. Verrocchio had to support several of his brothers and sisters. Never marrying, he later provided for the education and dowries of the daughters of his younger brother Tommaso.\n\nAndrea’s youth is undocumented. When and where he began his artistic training is unknown, although he may have received some preliminary instruction from his father in working both clay and stone; he was a member of the stoneworkers guild.\n\nBut all are guesses. Andrew Butterfield explains that in his early teens, appears to have been apprenticed to a goldsmith maybe with Antonio Dei and Francesco di Luca Verrocchio, a rich and successful goldsmith that knew Andrea as a youth. Maybe Andrea got his sobriquet of the Verrocchio’s family but it is uncertain. We know he worked as goldsmith for his tax reporter for 1457, Andrea declared that he used to work for a goldsmith.\n\nHe was first trained too as sculptor in terracotta, marble and bronze. Then is generally been assumed that he spent few years in a major sculpture studio in Florence, possibly that of Desderio Setiggnano or Antonio Rosellino, however there is not documentary record. So, his curriculum vitae only can be reconstructed through the registers of documented project when he already worked on his own.\n\nLater, took up painting sometime in the 1460s. It is said to have been a pupil of the Florentine artist Alessio Baldovinetti, but it is assumed by Art Historians that he and Sandro Botticelli worked together under the early Renaissance master Filippo Lippi in Prato when the friar painter had been commissioned to execute a series of murals for the cathedral. Vasari, the biographer of the artists of the Italian Renaissance, reports that Verrocchio studied the frescoes of Masacccio in the Brancacci Chapel.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio. Head of Woman (1475). British Museum, London\n\nLike every good painter and sculptor he was a great draughtsman, moreover, drawing was and is the basis of an instruction, and Verrocchio was one of the most gifted draughtsman of his generation. The exhibition devotes an entire room to his drawings. The outlines of the figures are fluid, loose and calligraphic. Verrocchio’s sense of form is so strong that with a minimum of line can suggest completely the rotund, volumetric shapes of the babie’s bodies or all kind of faces. His drawings have a controlled spontaneity and vitality. His representation of human form is natural and not rigid.\n\nBy the middle of the 1460’s Verrochio’s position as a leading sculptor in Florence was established. It is fully documented that Verrocchio headed a busy workshop that became a kind of laboratory for experimentation and innovation which produced works and trained artists who in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries reached the highest peak in art history. Although most famous for his sculpture, Verrocchio attracted ho his workshops budding painters of remarkable talent and loyalty: Leonardo da Vinci who remained for a decade or more, those were his fundamental formative years, where he learned to model in light and dark and to depict his enigmatic figures. He is generally believed to have entered the studio by 1469, the year his family moved from Vinci to Florence. The exact nature of the working relationship of Verrocchio and Leonardo is difficult to establish. However Leonardo’s debt to Verrocchio was considerable.\n\nSandro Botticelli. Madonna and Child (1470). National Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n\nAnother pupil was Lorenzo di Credi who was still with Verrocchio at the time of the master’s dead. Others such as Botticelli, Perugino and Ghirlandaio may have stayed with him for short periods before opening workshops of their own. All of them were absolutely gifted. Butterfield believes that what attracted young painters to Verrocchio’s workshop can be readily deduced: “He was an innovative artist with an inventive and analytical mind, he worked regularly for the top patrons in Florence; he had talent for teaching, and he had enough painting commissions to keep young assistants busy.”\n\nA Florentine Renaissance workshop was a dynamic place, competitive and collaborative at the same time. Some artists have many assistants, others very few. Boys were apprenticed around the age of 13 or even younger and would begin by mixing pigments or running errands until they progressed to more substantial work if they showed to be an early promise.\n\nVerrocchio used his students’ abilities to his advantage, but also allowed them a certain amount of freedom in realizing a project. Some who would go on to become the greatest painters of the Renaissance, attests to Verrocchio’s genius as both teacher and artist. “Verrocchio was a visionary,” says Andrew Butterfield, “he had a restless imagination and a relentless drive to experiment and improve on what he or anyone else had done before. But he was also like the maestro of an orchestra who could bring together many talents and draw forth the best from them. This was one of his secrets as a teacher.” On the walls of one of the exhibition rooms we can read: “Whatever painters have that is good, they drank from Verrocchio’s spring.” It was written by a Florentine humanist in the early 1500s. His designs were widely copied and imitated; his innovations as a draughtsman were studied and absorbed by an entire generation of young painters; his conceptual advances in sculpture continued to stimulate artists throughout 16th and 17th century as Cellini or Michelangelo.”The multiplicitiy of Verrrocchio’s experiences as painter, draughtsman and sculptor helped him to conceive a model of artistic achievement that was not bound by the capacities of one medium alone, but instead incorporated elements of both painting and sculpture”, says Butterfield.\n\nAbout Verrocchio workshop, this exhibition shows an issue that is not trivial. The master of the workshop- like other workshops of this time- was in charge of all projects, which carried his name no matter how far removed they were from his hand. Since apprentices were trained to follow the master’s style, or even to imitate as closely as possible, to distinguish the work of teacher and student can be complicated, particularly true of Verrocchio due to his profound influence on his pupils and the lack of signed and dated paintings by him. No drawing or painting by Verrocchio can be securely dated and the attribution of he paintings is plagued by controversy. By contrast, the sculptures are extremely well documented and present few serious problems of attribution.\n\nLorenzo di Credi. Madonna di Piazza. Cathedral of San Zeno, Pistoia\n\nAndrew Butterfield points out: “Numerous documents refer to Andrea as a painter, and he is known to have belonged to the painters’ confraternity in 1472, but the only extant picture recorded as his, the Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints (called the Madonna di Piazza, still in situ in Pistoia Cathedral), was, as the recent cleaning demonstrates, almost certainly executed by his pupil and heir, Lorenzo di Credi. A series of small devotional pictures, consisting mostly of half-length Madonnas, are equally problematic, they are disputed between the master and the various artists believed to have been his pupils-not only Credi, but also Domenico Ghirlandaio, Perugino, and even Leonardo da Vinci. So, while most works of art in this exhibition are considered to be by Verrocchio alone, others are thought to have been made with the participation of his pupils.”\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and Pietro Perugino), Madonna and Child with Two Angels (1470-1474). The National Gallery, London. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nA remarkable example on view at the National Gallery of Art is painting made by Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and Pietro Perugino is Madonna and Child with Two Angels: “Verrocchio’s hand can be identified in the flipped cloak on the shoulder of this angel, the gold and green brocade lining of Mary’s robe, and the two beautiful jeweled brooches. The face of the Virgin and other details of the angel at right were probably completed by Perugino, while Leonardo’s work can be seen in the reverent angel on the opposite side, who delicately holds a lily, and in passages of the landscape behind.” (From the museum website).\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and workshop. Baptism of Christ, (1468–1475) Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florencia. Photo: NGA\n\nHoused at the Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florence, another remarkable painting by Verrocchio, Leonardo and workshop is Baptism of Christ, which represents the complexity of artistic collaboration in the Renaissance. Butterfield points out: “The artist first designed the overall scene and painted the figure of John the Baptist at right, striding forward as he anoints Christ with waters from the river Jordan. In addition to conceiving the central figure of Christ, the master probably also painted the adjacent angel with folded hands and the rocks at right. At a certain point, however, Verrocchio ceased work on the monumental panel, leaving its completion to at least two assistants—an unknown artist who completed the dove, the hands of God the Father, and the gold rays above.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo da Vinci and workshop. Baptism of Christ (1468–1475?). Detail. Gallerie degli Uffizi, Florencia. Photo: NGA\n\nWhile Verrocchio used tempera (pigments mixed with water and egg yolk), Leonardo painted the divine angel in oil, lending the figure an otherworldly presence and an expression of beatific adoration, with a head of fine golden hair and brocaded sleeves. The artist also painted the valley landscape behind, whose flowing water and distant mountains demonstrate the young artist’s profound understanding of the rhythms of nature and its mystical. As Vasari wrote, “In this work [Verrocchio] was assisted by Leonardo da Vinci, his disciple, then quite young, who painted therein an angel with his own hand.” Vasari also wrote that Verrocchio resolved never to touch the brush again because Leonardo, his pupil, had far surpassed him, but later art historians consider this story apocryphal. What is true is that Leonardo absorbed the beauty, naturalism, narrative force and inventive genius of his teacher’s creations.\n\nThe only work by Leonardo in an American museum is the Portrait of Ginevra de’ Benci (1474-1478) housed at this museum. For this exhibition, Ginevra has only moved from one room to another to accompany the master. Leonardo da Vinci may have painted this early portrait of the Florentine Ginevra de’ Benci while still a pupil in Verrocchio’s workshop. Seated before a shimmering landscape seen through a veil of light and atmosphere, the young Ginevra regards the viewer with a sober gaze befitting her virtue and chastity. The young woman’s spiraling curls, the detailed representation of her modest costume, and the sculptural quality of her face as if her complexion was made in marble or porcelain. All owe a profound debt to Verrocchio. Leonardo’s panel, which has been cut along the bottom edge, likely originally displayed Ginevra at nearly waist length with her hands delicately holding a sprig of flowers.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Lady with Flowers (1475-1480). Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nVerrocchio’s marble busts have a similar composition. His Lady with Flowers portrays a young woman with her hands crossed and holding a small bouquet of flowers to her chest. Is an idealization of the individual that characterizes Verrocchio’s work. Is a new type of Renaissance bust, in which the arms of the sitter are included in the manner of ancient Roman models. This compositional device allows the hands, as well as the face, to express the character and mood of the sitter.\n\nWho’s this woman? The most frequently stated suggestion is that she is Ginevra de’Benci. This identification is based on comparision with the Leonardo’s painting. Both women have broad faces with high cheek-bones, they wear the same hairstyler in identical fashion. But despise these similarities there also significance differences…\n\nThe second proposal, rather, a hunch, is that the bust represents the Lorenzo de Medici’s lover Lucrezia Donati. It is recorded that Lorenzo commissioned portraits of Lucrezia in both sculpture and painting, but they have not survived registered. Although it is conceivable that the bust represents Lucrezia, there is no proof whatsoever of this identification. It seems that Lorenzo was very much in love of Lucrezia and according to the conventions of courtly love wrote of her in his sonnets imitating Petrarch’s lyrics in praise of Laura. In the love poems Lorenzo composed for her in 1470, he dwelled on the beauty of her hands and described her holding flowers. The exhibition shows one:\n\nWhat pure rain or air brought forth\n\nFlowers of such unaccustomed beauty…?\n\nMy dear violets, the hand\n\nThat chose you from among the others\n\nHas adorned you with excellence\n\nAnd preciousness\n\nThat same hand plucked my heart\n\nAnd turned it from base to noble.\n\nTherefore, give thanks to her and to no other\n\nLike Lorenzo’s poetry, Verrocchio’s sculpture may reflect medieval and Renaissance romance literature in which the exchange of flowers symbolized pure, courtly love; flowers were used also as a symbol for a wide variety of female attributes, such as virtue or beauty and gestures of great intimacy. Three famous beloveds of the Renaissance, Ginevra de’Benci, Lucrezia Donati and Simonetta Vespucci (the model for the Botticelli’s Primavera) were all depicted and described holding or wearing flowers on her dresses, they tied love with flowers. Andrew Butterfield points out: “The depiction of female beauty in Renaissance art are often had a literary counterpart and referent in neo-Petrarchan poetry and treatises, which described woman according to the conventions of courtly love. Poetry of this kind enjoyed great popularity in the circle of the Medici, and Lorenzo himself was the one of the leading exponents of its revival.”\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio. A Young Woman (1465-66).

On view at the NGA, Washington DC.\n\nIt is important to realize that the 15th century Florentine busts that survive today may be only a small portion of those that once existed. In the Bonfires of Vanities in 1497 and 1498 the followers of the fanatical Savonarola burned many female portrait busts. The loss is truly incalculable.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Madonna and Child (1465-1470). Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Gemäldegalerie. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nWe have seen Verrocchio’s paintings in collaboration with his assistants, let’s see the one which is considered made entirely by him: Madonna and Child on view at this exhibition: “This painting serves as a touchstone for his career as a painter. The figures are remarkable for their sense of volume as if he has transported the solidity of his sculpted Madonnas onto panel and paint. Flesh tones are created with the innovative use of the soft and subtle gradations of shading known as sfumato. Many motifs found here, such as the Child’s piercing blue eyes, tight gold-streaked curls of hair, the striped cloth wraped around his body, and the pose of the Virgin’s left hand, can be found throughout Verrocchio’s painted work.” An sfumato that Leonardo will make his. The artist conceived the figures with an impressive sense of volume, modeling the forms in bold relief. Deep shadows and strong highlights on the face of Mary and the body of the Christ child lend the figures a palpable presence. The arms of the child, extended toward Mary in a dynamic gesture are strongly defined cylindrical shapes. These rhyme with Verrocchio’s sculptures of child figures, such as the Putto Poised on a Globe, also on view.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Putto Poised on a Globe (1480). National Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n\nSo in Verrocchio by his own, his most striking feature of the paintings attributed to him is the sophisticated treatment of light. His palette is dominated by primary colors, especially red and blue. According to Butterfield, this is a crucial difference between the paintings attributed to Verrocchio and those later made by his pupil Leonardo.\n\nVerrocchio lived in one of the most splendid times in art history: 15th-century Florence. The context was a booming economy founded on international banking and the cloth trade that kept Florentine artists busy. They vied with each other to fill the great demand for sculptures and paintings to adorn churches, homes, and civic buildings. In that competitive setting, Verrocchio’s skill and ingenuity won him the patronage of the wealthiest and most powerful family in Florence, the Medici family who came to dominate the city’s political and cultural life. However, his total support was not obtained until the death of Donatello in 1466, who had been the Medici’s favorite.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio. Alexander the Great (1483-85). National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.\n\nAndrew Butterfiled points out: “The grace, elegant and superlative craftsmanship of Verrocchio’s works suited the Medici Family who has gradually taken control of the Florentine republic. Their success leading bankers of Europe generated great wealth, which they channeled into works of art and architecture that glorified themselves and their city. Verrocchio became the Medici’s favorite sculptor and enjoyed the patronage of three generations of the family, beginning with the patriarch Cosimo called “Father of the Country”. His son Piero commissioned the David on view here and possibly the Putto with a Dolphin. Piero’s son, Lorenzo The Magnificent employed Verrocchio to make festive decorations for joust, precious objects in gold and silver and diplomatic gifts such as the relief here depicting Alexander the Great.”\n\nLorenzo de Medici (1513?). National Gallery of Art, Washington DC\n\nThere is on view an accurate portrait about Lorenzo the Magnificent the head of state in Florence from 1469 to 1492. After Lorenzo escape a 1478 attack in Florence cathedral by conspirators from the Pazzi family who assassinated his brother Giuliano, supporters commissioned life size wax images of Lorenzo to place in churches in thanksgiving for his survival. Verrocchio reportedly supervised the wax specialist Orsino Benintendi in making those sculptures. This commanding portrait, though probably made later, maybe be based on the wax sculpture that was dressed in the clothes Lorenzo wore during the attack. He appeared in that attire at his palace window later that day to show the crowd he has survive.\n\nVerrocchio’s works are remarkable for their variety. Besides the paintings and sculptures Verrocchio produced for the Medici, he designed costumes and decorative armor for their festivals, tournaments, and solemn receptions. Made curator of the collection of antiquities in the Medici palace, he restored many pieces of ancient Roman sculpture, especially portrait busts. He made the embellishment of the Villa Medici at Careggi. He also made statues, portrait busts, and painter altarpieces to functional objects, such as bells, candlesticks, and even a huge copper globe to crown Florence Cathedral. In 1468 he travelled to Venice to purchase high-quality copper for the project.\n\nIt appears that Verrocchio produced few works for patrons outside of Florence. Though he is said to have worked in Rome for Pope Sixtus IV among others, there is no documentary trace that he ever left the area around Florence until the early 1480s, when he moved to Venice, where he died within a few years. Even while he was in Venice his Florentine workshop was maintained and directed by his favorite student, Lorenzo di Credi who was also the administrator and principal heir of Verrocchio’s estate.\n\nAlso Verrocchio appears to have been highly literate: he owned humanist texts, including works of Ovid. Vasari characterized Verrocchio as an artist of restless intellectual activity He also studied science, geometry and perspective and was a musician, he could read Latin. Andrea del Verrocchio was the prototype of a Renaissance man in every way.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, David with the Head of Goliath, (1465). Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nSo, as a sculptor, Verrocchio was the most important figure in Renaissance art between Donatello and Michelangelo, making works of unprecedented technical accomplishment and breathtaking naturalism and beauty. According to Art Historian H.W Janson he combined elements from Antonio Rossellino and Antonio del Pollaioulo into a unique synthesis. Coming from the Florence Nazionale Bargello Museum, one of the stellar pieces display at the National Gallery of Art exhibition is his David. David is a biblical hero, a young shepherd who gains fame first as a musician and later by killing the enemy Goliath with a stone thrown from his sling. This episode has inspired many painters and sculptors throughout Art History.\n\nThere are four fundamental Davids in sculpture history: three were made in the Renaissance period: Michelangelo’s David at the Galleria della Accademia and a replica placed at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence; Donatello and Verrocchio’s David both at the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence; the other one, of Baroque period, the Bernini’s David at the Galleria Borghese in Rome. Let’s compare them.\n\nMaybe the most famous is the one of Michelangelo. Traditionally, David had been depicted after his victory, triumphant over the Goliath defeated, not in Michelangelo’s sculpture which appears before the battle has actually taken place, a moment between conscious choice and action. Michelangelo was only 26 years old in 1501. He accepted the challenge to sculpt a large scale David and worked constantly for over two years to create one of the most breathtaking masterpieces of Art History with Carrara marble: “David is tense: Michelangelo catches him at the apex of his concentration. He stands relaxed, but alert, resting on a classical pose known as contrapposto. The figure stands with one leg holding its full weight and the other leg forward, causing the figure’s hips and shoulders to rest at opposing angles, giving a slight s-curve to the entire torso. The slingshot he carries over his shoulder is almost invisible, emphasizing that David’s victory was one of cleverness, not sheer force. He transmits exceptional self-confidence and concentration, both values of the “thinking man”, considered perfection during the Renaissance”. (Text from Galleria della Accademia website).\n\nWe see this powerful body. Michelangelo made his own research into human anatomy, dissected bodies, and drew from models till the human figure did not seem to hold any secrets for him. Michelangelo’s personality, his violent changes of mood, his sense of being at odds with himself and angry with the world came from the cultural climate of Florence during the 1480’s and 90’s; both the Neo-Platonism of Marsilio Ficino in profound contrast with the fanatical religious reforms of Savonarola profoundly affected him. This dualism of body and spirit endows his figures with their extraordinary pathos; like his David outwardly calm, but stirred by an overwhelming psychic energy. With the head of Goliat being omitted, Michelangelo’s David looks challenging, not a victorious hero but the champion of a just cause. This is the reason why the statue soon came to symbolize the defense of civil liberties embodied in the Republic of Florence as an independent city-state threatened on all sides by more powerful rival states and by the hegemony of the Medici Family.\n\nDonatello, David (1435-1440). Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence\n\nThe bronze statue by Donatello depicted the hero standing victorious over the head of Goliath. It has nothing in common with Michelangelo’s hero, his David doesn’t even seem victorious at all. Donatello’s David (1440) is the first life size nude statue since antiquity. Why the artist choose to represent the young victor in his fashion is somewhat puzzling, specially since David wears rather ornate military boots and hat. He has chosen to model an adolescent boy, depicted with an enigmatic smile, is both physically delicate and remarkably effeminate. The face has been said to have been inspired by classical sculptures of Antinous a favorite of emperor Hadrian renowned for his beauty.\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini. David (1623). Galleria Borghese, Roma\n\nBernini’s David is the prototype of a Baroque sculpture: Bernini depicts the biblical hero an instant before he flings the stone that will strike the giant Goliath. His David is like a tour de force. H.W Janson describe it as follows: ”His entire action is focused on his adversary, so it is not a self-contained figure but as half-of-a pair. We wonder if Bernini planned a statue of Goliath to complete the group. He never did, for his David tells us clearly enough he sees the enemy. Consequently, the space between David and his invisible opponent is charged with energy: it belongs to the statue. If we stand directly in front of this formidable fighter, our first impulse is to get out of the line of fire.”\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini. David (1623). Detall. Galleria Borghese, Roma\n\nIndeed, his face says it all, frowning and biting his lower lip, furious gaze, is contorted in an aggression focused on his goal. We can feel his anger. David was Scipione Borghese’s last commission for Bernini. Bernini’s biographer, Filippo Baldinucci, tells that Maffeo Barberini, the future Pope Urban VIII, Bernini’s friend, would hold a mirror up to Bernini’s face so the artist could model the sculpture on himself. It was completed in the course of seven months.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, David with the Head of Goliath (1465). Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florencia. On view at the NGA, Washington DC. Photo: NGA\n\nLet’s back to Verrocchio’s David. I remembered him at the Bargello, how graceful he was. A perfect Florentine profile from the Medici era is completely out of place in Washington DC, but fortunately has been put on a context between the putti.\n\nIt was commissioned by Piero di Medici and the sculpture was to be placed in the palazzo Vecchio. Verrocchio had the most knowledge of ancient art more than any Florentine artists of his generation, and he conceived many of his sculptures in direct response to classical statuary. His David was based on the Doryphorosd and Diadoumenos by Polykleitos with his contraposto pose. Let’s read the Museum description: “Verrocchio’s David is an extroverted young man that wears a lavish close-fitting jacket with gilded ornament, demonstrating the master’s experience as a goldsmith. This may be Verrocchio’s earliest statue cast in bronze, with an exceptionally smooth surface and details achieved partly by carving the cooled metal with chisels. […]The biblical king David could be represented as a venerable monarch or as the shepherd boy who saved his people by felling a giant. David’s youthful role as a savior was popular with the Florentines, who saw themselves as triumphant, with God’s help, in wars against other Italian city-states. Verrocchio’s David has a lively pose, a vigilant gaze and golden hair. The tunic fitting tightly over his slender torso suggests ancient armor. Verrocchio treated the grimacing face of Goliath with remarkable compassion. The stone, now missing that David use to kill him was made separately and attached to the giant’s forehead.” Verrochio’s David personified both humility and divine aid against enemies. For this figure, the Master is purported to have used the young and handsome Leonardo, a newcomer to his workshop, as his model.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Christ and Saint Thomas (1467–1483). Museo di Orsanmichele, Florence. Photo: NGA\n\nThe artist’s greatest masterpiece and his most important contribution to de development of Renaissance art is Christ and Saint Thomas. The group was commissioned by the Università della Mercanzia for its niche on the façade of Orsanmichele, the grain market which in 1404 it was converted into a church supported by the powerful craft and trade guilds of Florence. The Mercanzia was the supervisory body that regulated trade and guilds in Florence. Orsanmichele was distinguished by the series of statues that decorate the exterior of the building of the main sculptors of the Italian Renaissance: Ghiberti, Donatello, Nani di Banco, Brunelleschi, Giambologna… and this group of Verrocchio. The sculptures seen today are copies, the originals having been removed to museums. Orsanmichele began a major site for Florentine sculpture, rivaling the cathedral in importance.\n\nThe innovative to place a narrative group in a tabernacle originally created to house a single figure. Andrew Butterfield describes us how Verrocchio solved the problem of the space by an unprecedented move: “Instead of casting St Thomas and Christ as figures fully in the round, Verrocchio conceived and executed the two statues without backs, as if they were figures in extremely high relief. Both statues are open at the back from the shoulders to the bottom of their robes, and Christ’s right arm is open almost to the wrist. The decision had the added advantage that it made the statues lighter and both cheaper and easier to cast. […] Verrocchio also broke another convention, a statue usually set within its niche and in a plane parallel with the aperture. In an unusual placement, he placed Christ off-center at the back of the niche and positioned St. Thomas outside of the niche on the ledge of the tabernacle so that St. Thomas appears to be stepping past the column and into the niche.”\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio. Christ and Saint Thomas (1467–1483). Detail. Museo di Orsanmichele, Florence. Photo: NGA\n\nThe Verrocchio’s group work illuminates the episode in which the resurrected Jesus told the apostle Thomas, who did not believe that Christ had risen miraculously from the dead, to “put out your hand and place it in my side; do not be faithless but believing.” The monumental figure of Christ, elevated above Thomas on a step inside the niche, lifts an arm in blessing and reveals the wound in his chest, while the incredulous apostle steps toward him from the outside ledge and tentatively raises his hand. The space is limited and it doesn’t even notice!. The elevation of Christ serves to gave him preeminence and grandeur and the figures’ noble gestures and circumspect expressions impart a sense of solemnity.\n\nAs Verrocchio worked on the ensemble over a period of sixteen years. Upon the sculpture’s unveiling in 1483, admirers described it as “the most beautiful work there is” and “the most beautiful head of Christ ever made.”\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio and Alessandro Leopardi, Equestrian Monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni, (1480–1496) Campo San Giovanni e Paolo, Venice. Photo: NGA\n\nA statue that it was a hit at the Renaissance period: the Monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni, in Venice, placed at the Campo San Giovanni e Paolo, an outstanding Verrocchio’s final work of monumental sculpture, a bronze equestrian statue of the condottiere (professional soldier) Bartolomeo Colleoni. The city of Venice held a competition for the commission which Verrocchio won in 1483. The city owed gratitude to Colleoni for a number of charities he had founded rather than for any particular deed of military prowess. However, Verrocchio depicted a fearsome commander in armor astride a muscular horse with flowing mane in an scenographic conception. His references was the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelios in Rome. Although Verrocchio had not completed his monument to Colleoni by the time of the artist’s death in 1488 in Venice, the final ensemble the work of casting and chasing, or polishing, was entrusted to the Venetian Alessandro Leopardi. It is considered this statue the crowning achievement of Verrocchio’s career. By 1483 Verrrochio had made a life-size model of the horse, probably in wax over a core armature, by May 1486 he had move to Venice to prepare the sculpture for casting. The body of the horse is remarkable for its naturalism.\n\nThe steed raises his left foreleg—an impressive technical feat which required balancing the heavy bronze on three thin legs. It was the most naturalistic freestanding bronze equestrian statue cast since antiquity. The horse graceful and spirited rather than robust and placid, Verrocchio minutely studied the anatomy of the horse its thin hide reveals every vein, muscle, and sinew. Colleoni looms in the saddle like the very embodiment of forceful dominance. Legs rigidly straight, one shoulder thrust forward, he surveys the scene before him but his lip is contemptuously curled. It is not a portrait in the specific sense of the term, it projects and idealization of a personality who was successful leadership in war. Radiates an almost frightening sense of power.\n\nAs we have seen, Verrocchio is regarded as one of the most influential artists of his generation, one whose technical and conceptual contributions to the arts paved the way for the 16th century Renaissance:”His achievements really did change the history of art, both because he changed what was possible conceptually; and technically, and because of his influence on the next generations of artists”, says Andrew Butterfield.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio, Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (1477–1480).

The fine design represents the sculptor’s only surviving work in silver. The background is executed in a repoussé technique, with the forms hammered outward from the reverse side of the sheet. He also obtained commissions for monumental sculpture such as the Monument to Cardinal Forteguerri in the Pistoia Cathedral or the Medici tombs in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence for the brothers Piero and Giovanni, unprecedent in Florence for its scale, lavish us of sumptuous materials, and exquisite marble and Bronze ornament.\n\nAndrea del Verrocchio.

Photo: NGA\n\nHowever, for his misfortune, Verrocchio is always mentioned as Leonardo’s teacher as well as the one who pushed so hard and influenced other artists. But what about his own art? Art historians sometimes seems to have forgotten to value Verrocchio for himself. When we see in this exhibition such a high quality works, one has to wonder: Why isn’t Verrocchio mentioned in the same level of appreciation that Leonardo, Michelangelo, Bellini, Piero della Francesca, Raphael, or Donatello? He is usually in a section and there are not as many monographs like other artists. It’s a question of narrative, his main specialist Butterfield argues. Giorgio Vasari, the main source for centuries for art historians, didn’t favor Verrocchio: “Vasari chose certain artists to be the heroes of a generation, and in order to promote those artist’s importance, he often downplayed other artists’ achievements”, explaining that over the course of the few decades in Renaissance study, scholars have learned to use the “most important source for Renaissance history with a great deal of caution.”\n\nWhatever, finally, the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC exhibition, without forgetting its important pupils, has recognized his own works of art. Verrocchio is no longer just a chapter in early Leonardo’s career. He really deserved it!\n\nÀngels Ferrer i Ballester"
