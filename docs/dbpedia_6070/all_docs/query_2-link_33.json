        "text": "Telling a Hay audience this week about my book The Lost Battles was exhilarating – and challenging. I offered the audience a choice: should I talk \"lyrically\" about my study of Renaissance art, or \"polemically\" about why I wrote it? Everyone said they wanted the polemic, so I set out some of the ideas behind my narrative of a rollicking clash between Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Here is the gist of it – up for debate.\n\nOne of the things that attracted me to the story of how, in 1504, the Republic of Florence set its two most gifted sons into direct competition, challenging them to paint murals in the same hall at the heart of the city, was the chance to annoy as many art historians and historians as possible. The tendency in modern works on the Renaissance is, after all, to demystify its grand narratives. At one level, art scholars prefer to concentrate on Italian courts such as Urbino, Ferrara and Mantua and argue that the traditional prestige of Florence as the birthplace of the Renaissance is the work of brilliant Tuscan propagandists like Giorgio Vasari.\n\nAt another level, globally minded historians dispute the significance of the Renaissance. The Renaissance, said Felipe Fernandez-Armesto on the same stage as me at Hay, was \"just a little local difficulty\". Another speaker who appeared a few hours before me, Professor Jerry Brotton, has written of the Renaissance as a cross-cultural \"bazaar\". Other historians, too, tend to emphasise the spread and variety of Renaissance ideas throughout Europe, rather than its Italian origins.\n\nSo – as I told my Hay audience – the story I tell is a deliberate thorn in the flesh of such sceptical modern histories. It revises the revisionists. The story I tell in my book happens to vindicate everything the Victorians believed about this incredible cultural moment. What does it mean, historically, that in the early 1500s Michelangelo and Leonardo competed in their own city? It reminds us of the sheer wonder of Florence at this time – for how could two such geniuses be produced by its artistic workshops if not because this community was a unique crucible of talent? And if nothing else, my book puts Florence back at the heart of Renaissance Europe. The fact that Niccolo Machiavelli was involved in staging the contest adds to that argument – northerners' admiration for the Italian provocateur ensured that his ideas circulated through Europe and inspired Shakespeare's villains."
