        "text": "Origin[]\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (literally, \"Leonardo, from Vinci\") was born in Vinci (Florence) as the illegitimate son of a notary and a peasant woman. He was one of the thinkers spawned by the Renaissance from the 14th century and became a polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor. Among his most famous works were the Mona Lisa, The Last Supper, and the Vitruvian Man. His genius epitomized the Renaissance.[1]\n\nBrotherhood of the Shield[]\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's brilliance got him recruited into the Brotherhood of the Shield, and he eventually became their Patriarch.[1] He personally took on many students at the Brotherhood.[11] In 1495, he, Pietro Perugino, and Lorenzo Di Credi discovered that there was something in the Sun, draining its energy.[3]\n\nBefore Leonardo left to investigate the Sun, he tried to recruit Michelangelo several times and Michelangelo revealed his nature as an omnitemporal being in 1502. Michelangelo gave Leonardo the Human Machine and a small piece of his power, telling him that Leonardo must help save the world. Leonardo learned that there will be a man named Leonid in the future that he must meet and that there was a god growing in the Sun. He built the Immortal City under Rome and a door called the Iter, which punched a hole in space and time, that could only be opened with a key that Leonardo gave Michelangelo.[1]\n\nFinally, Leonardo completed a flying suit that could travel through space and time in 1503. With the Human Machine in hand, he took off to the future.[3] Furthermore, he had created a perfect mechanical decoy to take his own place. It had all his memories and would continue his life as if he had never left.[9]\n\nPhoenix Force[]\n\nBecause no date is given, it is not clear if this section is experienced by the real Leonardo da Vinci or his Life-Model Decoy. He references the Immortal City, which began construction in 1502, and Leonardo leaves for the future in 1503, so the likelihood of the LMD is fairly high.\n\nArrival at the 20th Century[]\n\nHaving time travelled from the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci waited at the \"Seeing Place\" through the Iter at the Immortal City, as requested by Michelangelo. In 1956, Leonid was given the key to the Iter by his adoptive parents, Nikola Tesla and Mina, which was also orchestrated by Michelangelo. As Leonid went up the stairway through the Iter, he was greeted by Leonardo da Vinci, who carried with him the Human Machine. With the power he received from Michelangelo, he unlocked Leonid's latent memories. He revealed that he built the Immortal City and summoned the Brotherhood of the Shield. Meanwhile, Leonid's adoptive parents were flung to the far future along with Shield agents Nathaniel Richards and Howard Stark, though Leonardo reassured Leonid that this was all foretold by the Forever Man and that they will return.[14][1]\n\nLeonardo da Vinci and Leonid went to the Brotherhood's council chambers and was confronted by Sir Isaac Newton, the immortal current Patriarch. To Newton's disbelief, Leonardo revealed himself to the Brotherhood and showed everyone the Human Machine. After privately conversing with Newton, he met with Leonid, warned him about Newton's \"Truth,\" and informed Leonid about Newton's secret dungeon where Leonid would find and free Nostradamus. Meanwhile, Leonardo set off to do what he originally had intended to do and that was to investigate the Sun. He found the Celestial Madonna giving birth in the Sun and he returned to the Immortal City with the Star Child in his arms.[4]\n\nOver the course of the next four years, the conflict between Leonardo and Newton escalated into war. Leonardo believed in free will and the Brotherhood's original purpose, which was to preserve and guide humanity into the future, and Newton wanted the Brotherhood to accept humanity's inevitable demise, specifically in the year 2060.[15][8] When Nikola Tesla, Mina, Nathaniel Richards, and Howard Stark return from the future, they refuted Newton's belief that the world will end in 2060. In a trial, Leonid sided with Leonardo, but Newton used Leonardo's suit to travel forward in time to 2060 to see the end of the world. Newton's Quiet Math corrupted the Star Child, who then followed Newton to the future. The Brotherhood used the Human Machine to chase them; Leonardo stayed behind but wished Leonid and the others good luck.[16] After the Human Machine ascended Leonid and allowed him to resolve the conflict with Newton, Leonardo greeted the returning heroes in the present-day Italy.[17]\n\nWheels Within Wheels[]\n\nIt was during this time that Leonardo, under the alias Aries, formed an organization called the Great Wheel of Zodiac. The group consisted of members Vasili Dassaiev, John Garrett, Shoji Soma, Cornelius van Lunt, Baron Strucker, Dum Dum Dugan, Nick Fury, Jake Fury, Daniel Whitehall, Viktor Uvarov, and Thomas Davidson. Each member was assigned a codename from the Greek zodiac calendar. The group consisted of the best covert intelligence agents from around the globe. After only a few key missions for Leonardo, he would provide them resources that would be of great value to their own separate agendas. Each mission involved acquiring advanced technology from all across the globe. The Great Wheel later fell apart due to the betrayal of Dassaiev and Uvarov. The broken Wheel led to the creations of S.H.I.E.L.D., Hydra, Leviathan, and the Zodiac Cartel. Years later, Leonardo revealed that he formed the Great Wheel because he hoped it would control its members.[18]\n\nLeonardo was seen years later as a technical adviser to the post-H.A.M.M.E.R. iteration of S.H.I.E.L.D., but how long he held this role and where in his timeline it falls is unknown.[19] Da Vinci resurfaced in the present not long after the decommissioning of S.H.I.E.L.D. following Hydra's short-lived takeover of the United States. He started assembling in secret a group of geniuses and people of interest to build something new to stand in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s place."
