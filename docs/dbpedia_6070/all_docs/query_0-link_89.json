        "text": "Portrait of a Young Woman, c. 1470, oil on oak wood 29 x 22.50 cm. Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. Petrus Christus (Flemish, Baarle-Hertog, 1420 – Bruges, 1473; fl.1444 to 1473).\n\nThe Dry Tree, such a lovely name for a Confraternity to which Petrus belonged! It is thought to be one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance, and its influence –in the wake of van Eyck and van der Weyden’s works- was present during several decades in the European portraiture. An intriguing kind of face with even a misalignment of the sitter’s eyes. An exquisitely dressed sort of aristocratic woman is portrayed in Christus’ work. Dark background against which the woman positions herself in front of a wainscotted wall, an element (the wall) that makes the sitter be in the environment of a realistic interior (a kind of triangular space if we take as a point of the triangle her neckline).\n\nThis clearly contrasted with the more elaborate and detailed backgrounds of van Eyck’s works (many pundits think that Petrus studied with Jean van Eyck, therefore, he was his master in his initial steps). Be this the case or not, our painter had a type of eclectic style which made him use pictorial elements or motifs which had already been seen in the works of artists such as van der Weyden, Campin or van Ouwater. He was the first Flemish artist to have the subject of his works in concrete spatial surroundings, which adds a great deal to the immediacy of their appearance and its realistic character.\n\nJesús Lorenzo Vieites\n\nPortrait of Baldassarre Castiglione, c.1513-15, oil on canvas, 82 x 67 cm. Musée du Louvre, Paris. Raphael\n\nThis is one of Raphael’s masterpieces of Renaissance portraiture. The great old master shows us his portrait of his friend, the humanist, ambassador and poet Baldasarre Castiglione (1478-1529), whose Il Cortegiano (published 1526) deals with what the ideal courtier should be like. (particularly the likes of Federigo da Montefeltro, the “light of Italy”). “I should like our courtier to be more than average scholar at least in those studies which we call the humanities.” Both men, artist and poet, met when young at the Urbino court, and since shared ideas of beauty and good manners throughout their intense lives.\n\nAt first glance, the painting suggests a calm atmosphere of great complicity. It is a beautiful and highly skilled three-quarter profile portrait —where the figure of the poet appears highlighted on a neutral background, sand-colored, unusually light tones for the painter— of a man of the Renaissance, someone who might be proud to be one of Italy’s best known humanists if only because of his book and portrait. Elegantly dressed (a head turban, a Florentine beret with a notched edge, adorned with a medallion; a bloused white shirt accompanied by a doublet trimmed on the front and upper sleeves in gray squirrel fur laced with black ribbon), Castiglione’s features, of a serene and balanced man, are enhanced by the darkness provided by his burgundy dress, and his thick beard; Castiglione is at the same time idealized through the refined pose, the elegant dress, and the chromatic balance.\n\nThe sparkle of his deep blue eyes, the vivacity, cheerfulness and vibrancy of the expression of the sitter, in short, a man full of humanity who seeks our gaze, penetratingly, as if to offer us his friendship, makes all the more intensely loved by many art lovers. This painting was probably executed in Rome in 1514–1515, on the occasion of Castiglione’s appointment as ambassador to Pope Leo X by the Duke of Urbino.\n\nJ.L. Vieites\n\nImpression, Sunrise, 1873. (Impression, soleil levant) 48 x 63 cm. Musée Marmottan, Paris. Claude Monet (1840 – 1926)\n\nUnbeknownst to Monet, this painting has gone down into history as being the quintessential symbol of Impressionism. Who could have foreseen that those visible brushstrokes and the minimal representation of figures was to become one of art history’s most influential artistic movements during the XXth century? Lots of artists drank from the impressionist fountain.\n\nMonet executed this painting from a hotel room on the Quays of Southampton where he was lodged. The port of Le Havre…yes, its initial title was View of Le Havre that the artist soon changed to its current name; a fact that made the art critic Louis Leroy mocked Monet and the members of this new group of artists, whom he referred as “The Impressionists’ Exhibition” (of 1874) in the April issue of Le Charivari.\n\nVisible loose brushstrokes, kind of unfinished touches, supremacy of colour and use of light…those were some of the key features of impressionism works.\n\nA foggy port scene where the red-orange sun is the focal point in the composition, some splashes of warm colours in the sky, and the visual contrast with vertical lines that break the horizon (factory chimneys, smokestacks from the steamboats), billowing smoke fills and patches the smudged-looking air with its grey hues that makes it barely distinguishable the horizon.\n\nIt was really a great shock in artistic terms of the day, just going against the academic schools while Neoclassical art was predominant in France. A common, mundane scene depicting an industrial port was off-bounds in the traditional pictorial environment of the academic painters. Yet, sunsets, dawns were common in French painting and Monet wished to blend it with the revival of the industrial effort of the French after the lost Franco-Prussian war of 1870.\n\nObserve the movement achieved through long brushstrokes visible in the water at the bottom of the painting; something which was a new step towards the creativeness of the future Pointillism and Fauvism that will arrive in the Parisian environment some years later.\n\nJesús L. Vieites\n\nRembrandt’s Portrait of Marten Soolmans, 1634. Oil on canvas, 209 × 135.5 cm Rijksmuseum. Holland.\n\nNot only did Vermeer use impasto in one of his iconic works, View of Delft (among others) but other Dutch Golden Age painters, like the great old master, Rembrandt van Rijn, made extensive use of it so as to achieve glorious art works composed of dense impastos and thin glazes.\n\nThat thick paint laid on the canvas and making it stand from its surface (impasto technique) was a great booster to enhance the reflection of light in the canvas, of which these all Dutch and Flemish masters took great advantage in their compositions.\n\nThis work, along with its pendant depicting Marten’s bride, Oopjen Coppit were executed by Rembrandt to celebrate their marriage in 1634. (Astonishingly detailed and painstakingly executed tassels!) Both paintings are the joint purchase made by the Louvre and the Rijksmuseum in 2016.\n\nArt for art’s sake\n\nJesús Lorenzo Vieites\n\nThe Great Piece of Turf, (Das grosse Rasenstück) 1503; watercolor; 40.6 x 31.7 cm. Graphische Sammlung Albertina, Vienna.\n\nSummertime, and although there are far more refreshing paintings with which to mitigate the heat of August, I have chosen this superb watercolour by Dürer (1471-1528). The great master who knew how to combine the forms and ideals from southern and northern Europe. Due to high reputation (perhaps only second to Leonardo da Vinci) because of his treatises on architecture, perspective and human anatomy, without forgetting those concerning natural history (such the one I have uploaded today), his works were highly esteemed.\n\nLeonardo and Albrecht Dürer were examples of real, authentic practitioners of direct observation, which, to both masters, was the only way to arrive to truth, in an age where the discovery of the microscope was still unknown.\n\nIn his painting we can observe the skill of the artist in his rendering of the turf. Durer was even interested in turning something as commonplace as a piece of turf into a subject for a painting. He looked at it very closely: yarrow, dandelion, bluegrass, and plantain. They are not growing at random, as they might be in real life, but have been positioned carefully. Th finely drawn grasses in front make it possible for us to see the plantain behind as well. The long stalks of the dandelion and the grasses form the background.\n\nArt for art’s sake\n\nJesús Lorenzo Vieites"
