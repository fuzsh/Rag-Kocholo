        "text": "Leonardo painted very few paintings. At the same time, he always had servants, maids, pupils, horses, and pursued numerous activities that at first glance did not bring in any money. This raises the question of how he was able to finance his workshop business.\n\nIncome from apprenticeship fees\n\nIt was common for master painters to take on students and receive an apprenticeship fee from their parents. The amount of the fee varied with the social background of the student. In some cases Leonardo waived the fee. According to the understanding of the time, the training also included auxiliary work in the workshop, so that students not only lowered the costs of the workshop directly through teaching fees, but also indirectly by performing simple auxiliary work. Leonardo therefore always had several students around him.\n\nFree board and lodging\n\nThe artists' workshops were not tied to a fixed location. Rather, they were a mobile group of people. If the commissions were further away and could only be executed on site (e.g. for wall paintings), it was customary for the clients to pay for the lodging and meals of the artist's workshop. For example, when Leonardo made the cartoon of Anne Selfless, the monks of the Florentine Servite Order provided room and board for him and the members of his workshop.\n\nA wide range of workshop commissions\n\nThe main source of income for the artist's workshops was certainly the numerous workshop commissions. Paintings were the new fashion of the time and popular and expensively paid status symbols of the rich upper class. Sculptures were also very popular. But these were not the only types of commissions. Renaissance artists saw themselves as universal talents. This is true not only for Leonardo, but for all artists of the time. They painted, made music, wrote poetry, entertained, organized courtly festivities, designed buildings and machines, and sometimes just their advice or research on all sorts of things was needed. Accordingly, Leonardo exercised not only one but several professions.\n\nCourt artist\n\nportraits and paintings for court society (e.g. \"The Lady with the Ermine\", \"La Belle Ferroniere\" and \"The Last Supper\" were commissions from the Duke of Milan)\n\nmaking statues and statuettes\n\nartistic director of court festivals, entertaining special effects of all kinds, designing imaginative disguises and stage sets, making disguises for animals, e.g. squirrels, the animals prepared in this way were then released at the festivals\n\nDesign of fountains\n\nconstruction of lifting platforms for theatrical performances\n\nmusical entertainment of the guests: Leonardo played various instruments, some of which he built himself, and sang melodiously to them, he was known for being able to improvise well\n\namusement of the company with interesting riddles and instructive stories\n\nSpecial creations: a mechanical robot knight that could walk on its own; an automobile that could drive on its own by being driven by a mechanical tension spring like an oversized wind-up car; on the occasion of a visit of the French king, a mechanical lion was made that could walk a few steps and open its mouth via a wind-up mechanism\n\nArchitect\n\nAssistance in all matters of urban planning\n\nSupervision of building projects, e.g. reconstruction or new construction of villas, palaces and churches\n\nextension of sewerage systems\n\nDrainage projects\n\nSurveying projects, drawing up maps\n\nPreparation of plans for fortifications\n\nEngineer\n\nDesign of all kinds of machines to facilitate work\n\ndesigns and plans for weapons of war, siege weapons and mobile bridges\n\nScholar\n\nLeonardo was a contact person and advisor to the court in all matters of science\n\nThe wide range of commissions shows that Leonardo was active in many fields and that making paintings was only one of many tasks.\n\nCourt appanage\n\nMembers of a noble court received an annual basic salary to cover their expenses, an apanage. Leonardo was largely employed at such courts. Payments were not always made regularly, and letters from Leonardo to the Duke of Milan have been preserved, asking him to make the outstanding payments. One begins like this: \"Serene Highness, since I still have to receive the wages for two years ...\". The Duke of Milan was known for his iron budget discipline.\n\nApanage in Milan\n\nNevertheless, Leonardo was paid extraordinarily well. He was once asked by a visiting cardinal what salary he received from the Duke. Leonardo replied that he usually received two thousand ducats a year (7 kg of gold), plus numerous gifts and presents with which the duke lavished him most generously every day. Thus, in 1499, shortly before his expulsion by the French, the Duke gave Leonardo a vineyard near Milan.\n\nApanage in Amboise\n\nWhen Leonardo lived at the court of the French king at the end of his career, he received 1000 gold ducats per year (3.5kg of gold) as \"the king's painter\", only half the salary in Milan. However, the highest royal official got exactly the same sum. So the amount of the salary was a court political decision. In addition, Leonardo was given the castle Château du Cloux, 500m away from the royal castle.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn his later years, Leonardo owned some real estate properties that brought in additional income.\n\nThe Vineyard in Milan\n\nLeonardo had been working for Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan since around 1487. As a token of appreciation for his long service, the Duke granted the 47-year-old Leonardo a vineyard through an edict dated April 26, 1499:\n\n\"Ludovico Maria Sforza granted to Leonardo da Vinci, the highly renowned painter from Florence, 16 rods of land [about an area of 80m × 80m] or a vineyard, which he had recently acquired from the abbot or the monastery of San Vittore on the outskirts, near the Vercelli Gate [in the west of Milan], for him to build as he sees fit on this land and to establish orchards and do anything else he or his descendants or those to whom he will give what he received above may do or dispose of.\n\nA few days later, the French conquered Milan and expelled the Duke. Leonardo left the city in the fall of the same year in search of new patrons and returned to Milan only in 1406 to work for the French. In the meantime, the vineyard was leased by Leonardo's student Salai, who allowed his father to live there. Later, Salai also settled there. In Leonardo's will, he bequeathed half of the vineyard to Salai, and the other half went to Leonardo's servant Vilanis.\n\nThe Properties in Vinci\n\nIt is unclear today how much land from the da Vinci family's possessions was transferred to Leonardo. As an illegitimate son, Leonardo was excluded from his father's inheritance, but his childless paternal uncle specifically named him as the sole heir.\n\nThe properties in Vinci were once owned by Leonardo's grandfather Antonio. Although he was a trained notary, he lived in the countryside and \"did nothing,\" as was the terminology of the time, meaning he managed the family's properties. After his death, the possession was likely divided between his two sons, Ser Piero and Francesco, as both owned land in and around Vinci. Leonardo's father, Ser Piero, was the eldest son and possibly received a larger share. Since he was a successful notary in Florence, he needed a local manager to oversee the properties in Vinci. This role may have been assumed by his brother Francesco because he, like his father, did not pursue any profession and \"did nothing.\" This suggests that he had enough land to sustain himself from the yields. The idea of Francesco leading an idle life seems implausible since he had been married to Alessandra Amadori since 1465, who was the sister of his brother Ser Piero's first wife, who had died young. The da Vinci family had been strategically marrying women from Florentine notary families for generations. The marriage would probably not have taken place if Francesco's future livelihood had been uncertain.\n\nWhen Francesco died childless in 1507, his entire estate was intended to go to his sole heir, Leonardo. Since Leonardo was an illegitimate child and an earlier testament of Francesco stipulated that only legitimate children of Ser Piero were entitled to inherit, a lengthy legal dispute ensued with Leonardo's brothers. However, the French king successfully advocated for Leonardo with the government of Florence. Leonardo came into possession of part of the family's properties in Vinci in 1508, when he was 55 years old. The exact extent of this inheritance cannot be determined today. Given the protracted legal dispute, it must have been a considerable sum, which was also significant enough for Leonardo's brothers, even though some of them had become notaries themselves and thus reasonably well-off.\n\nThe Navigable Canal of St. Christopher, Milan\n\nMilan is not directly situated on a river or lake. In the Middle Ages, artificial canals (Navigli) were created to supply the city with water, connecting the surrounding lakes and rivers with the city. They also played a significant role in the local economy, as some of the canals were wide enough to allow larger ships to pass. The largest of these canals, the \"Naviglio Grande,\" had its own small port. Parts of the Milan canal system have been preserved to this day.\n\nAround 1508, the French king granted Leonardo the navigable canal of St. Christopher in Milan. At that time, this was a very valuable gift. On the one hand, it included the right to charge fees for water extraction for consumption, and on the other hand, fees could be levied for navigating the waterway. However, the transfer of the canal did not go smoothly, as a letter from Leonardo to the French governor of Milan still exists in which he complains that the canal had not yet been transferred to him. The fact that the canal was eventually transferred to Leonardo is evident from his will, in which he bequeathed the canal to his servant Vilanis.\n\nWhen Leonardo died in 1519, he had a bank fortune in Florence of 400 florins (1.5kg of gold). That is strikingly little, if this sum is held against the annual incomes of Leonardo. Because already in his Milan time he received according to traditional statement an annual wage of 2000 Florin (7kg gold). From this imbalance it is often concluded that Leonardo could not handle money. This is also said to explain the demands for payment from some creditors, which have survived to this day.\n\nLifestyle\n\nThroughout his life, Leonardo moved in the highest circles of society and partly adopted their way of life. Thus, he preferred comfortable clothes made of fine fabrics. He was very generous and also furnished the members of his workshop. Nevertheless, it would be an exaggeration to describe his life as luxurious. Rather, according to his records, he tended toward modesty and propagated a reduced lifestyle.\n\nLeonardo's workshop\n\nLeonardo ran an artist's workshop during the Renaissance. However, the term artist's workshop falls short. Rather, these workshops were artisanal enterprises that also performed numerous other activities, depending on the skill of their masters.\n\nFor example, Leonardo's teacher Verrocchio was the sculptor responsible for the design of the golden dome with cross, a replica of which can still be found on Florence Cathedral. It was natural at the time that Verrocchio also designed the machines and cranes that lifted the dome, which is about 1m tall, into the air.\n\nLeonardo's workshop was thus rather a company with several main focuses:\n\nProduction of art products\n\nPlanning and realization of festivities and processions\n\nConsulting, planning and execution of engineering services\n\nPreparation of scientific reports\n\nClients of the company were wealthy citizens, the high nobility and the church.\n\nCosts of the workshop\n\nLeonardo's company had a basic staff. This included servants, maids, and freelance specialists who were called in depending on the job (e.g., mirror makers, other painters). The company also needed basic equipment, such as working materials, horses and carriages. The materials Leonardo used were always of high quality. For example, he did not use conventional paints, but made them himself from precious minerals. He also used special alloys and woods for the components of his machines. His wide-ranging interests led to numerous cost-intensive experiments, which initially brought the workshop nothing and only served experimental purposes.\n\nLeonardo's income therefore did not go directly into his fortune, but largely paid for the running costs of his workshop. This explains why Leonardo had a relatively small bank balance at the time of his death. However, the sum of 400 florins (1.4kg of gold) also suggests that Leonardo certainly had no money worries.\n\nThefts\n\nAnother reason for the constant outflow of funds was that banking was not yet particularly well developed in everyday life. Thus Leonardo had to keep some of the gold coins in his workshop. There are preserved notes from 1.4.1499 with a kind of cash balance, in which he noted his hiding places. They give a vivid impression of how Leonardo kept his cash:\n\n\"[...] 20 ducats in the corner where the nails are, in white paper.\n\n28 ducats next to the corner where the nails are, in blue paper.\n\n97 ducats in the corner by the cabinet above the iron rings.\n\nIn white paper in the opposite corner above the iron rings 17 double ducats, 1 double ducat, 25 grossoni.\n\nIn a cloth in the cash box, 140 ambrosini\n\nIn the pocket 206 Grossoni\"\n\nGrossoni and Ambrosini were obsolete silver coins at the time, but continued to circulate. Leonardo lists here a cash fortune of about 170 ducats. This was an enormous sum. By comparison, Leonardo's salary for the large-scale painting \"Madonna of the Rocks,\" on which he was to work for 20 months according to the contract, was 200 ducats.\n\nIn his notes, Leonardo often complained about his pupil Salai, because he was stealing from him. It is conceivable that the latter was not the only one to plunder one of the hiding places, especially since they were apparently easily accessible. It is also conceivable that one or the other hiding place fell into oblivion.\n\nDebt\n\nThe insufficiently developed banking system is also a reason for Leonardo's frequently mentioned debts. He was never unable to repay them, but money could not be easily transferred in the late Middle Ages. For example, if he was out of town for a few weeks, which happened especially after 1500, it took patience on the part of the creditors to claim the amount later when he returned. This explains reminders of this kind.\n\nMoreover, Leonardo himself was often a creditor. Works were usually paid for only after completion, and payment morale was not particularly high. Even his noble courtiers, such as the Duke of Milan, made no exception and sometimes did not pay wages for years.\n\nOther debts arose because of legal disputes. Leonardo believed himself to be in the right not to have to pay certain amounts due to contractual interpretations. Until these facts were clarified, he continued to owe the amounts. This can be seen in the 20-year legal dispute over the Virgin of the Rocks.\n\nIn conclusion, it can be stated that on the one hand Leonardo certainly had a financially carefree life, and it seems that he spent the money with full hands. On the other hand, he meticulously notes expenses even the smallest amounts. And takes legal action when large amounts of money are involved. Money, on the whole, seemed to have been a means to an end for him, but without being wasted."
