Leonardo achieved this quality by means of nature studies. In 1478, he noted that he was working on two Madonnas. The Benois Madonna can be dated to that period. The painting has in its present condition been overpainted in some places and has lost some of the paint layer. The painting was also called the Madonna Benois because of the family who owned it. This canvas demonstrates the newly developed method of chiaroscuro – a lighting/shading technique that made the figures appear three dimensional. It entered the Hermitage in 1914.

Lady with an Ermine, as it is popularly known, was “shared” by Hermann Goering and Hans Frank, then Governor General of occupied Poland. It was the sole responsibility of a specially appointed SS officer to transport the priceless da Vinci back and forth between the two top Nazi officials.

The image of a man with blue eyes, long greying hair and a moustache appears to be a self-portrait of the renowned Renaissance artist, inventor and thinker.\n\nThe painting is a portrait of Isabella d’Este (1474 – 1539), marquess of Mantua, who was one of the leading women of the Italian Renaissance.\n\nIsabella d’Este by Leonardo da Vinci (The painting appears to be a completed, painted version of a pencil sketch drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in Mantua in the Lombardy region of northern Italy in 1499 > right ) Size 61cm x 46.5cm portrait.\n\nWhen Leonardo da Vinci was in Mantua in 1499, Isabella asked him to paint her portrait. A famous sketch, which was the preparatory phase to the painting, is exhibited at the Louvre in Paris. It is one of Leonardo’s finest head-and-shoulders portraits and the only known drawing for which Da Vinci used various colored pigments.\n\nBased on the existence of this preliminary sketch, art historians thought until recently that the painting probably had existed, but that it went missing or was destroyed.\n\nSo, the recent authentication of the ‘new’ Da Vinci painting is a major discovery. The materials used to paint the portrait have been reliably authenticated with carbonio-14. The test, positive at 95,4%, revealed that the portrait dates from a time period running from the 1450s to the early 1600s. The major expert in authenticating disputed works by Da Vinci, professor Carlo Pedretti – interviewed by the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera – also confirmed that the painting is by the hand of Leonardo, not excluding the possibility, however, that some details may have been added by one of his pupils. A common thing at that time.\n\nEven more striking is the preparation of the canvas, which is identical to the technique described by Da Vinci in his Treatise ‘On Painting’. In this work the painter describes in detail not only how to prepare canvas for painting, but also how to paint on it. So, the argument that the painting can not be attributed to Da Vinci precisely because it was painted on canvas, does not hold.\n\nWhile it is true that the only four – thus far known – female portraits by Leonardo da Vinci were all painted on wood panels (the Lady with the Ermine and La belle ferronnière on walnut, while the Mona Lisa and Ginevra de’ Benci were painted on poplar), the artist developed his technique of working on canvas already during his early apprenticeship in Verrocchio’s studio in the 1470s. So, long before he painted any of the four portraits. According to the Mona Lisa Foundation an earlier version of ‘Mona Lisa’ was also painted on hand-woven canvas, “a material with which Leonardo had significant experience before 1500″. A description of Da Vinci’s technique by Giorgio Vasari confirms that the master indeed painted on canvas. Moreover, the Court Painter for Isabella d’Este at the time when Da Vinci visited the marquess, was a great exponent of painting on canvas, which might have influenced Da Vinci in the choice of this medium.\n\nThe painting measures 61 by 46.5 cm (24 by 18 inches) and corresponds trait by trait to the original sketch. It depicts a perfectly linear profile of the marquess, a choice of pose that is striking for that time\n\nOwner Italian Family “Private” found in a private collection of 400 works.Located in Switzerland in a bank vault.\n\nCarlo Pedretti –confirmed that the painting is by the hand of Leonardo, not excluding the possibility, however, that some details may have been added by one of his pupils. A common thing at that time.“I can immediately recognise da Vinci’s handiwork, particularly in the woman’s face.”Pedretti wrote In a letter to the owners, he was convinced Leonardo had painted the face, while two assistants were responsible for a palm leaf the subject is holding.\n\nMonna Vanna\n\nIs not a nude Mona Lisa, but a nude woman figure with the head of one of LdV students called Salai\n\nOwner “Private”\n\nVerdict painted by Andrea Salai or the master himself.\n\nA nude version of the Mona Lisa is being shown in Milan. The naked portrait – titled the Monna Vanna, and complete with the model’s famous enigmatic smile – was painted in 1515 by Leonardo da Vinci’s pupil, Andrea Salai. Art historians say that it was not only inspired by Leonardo, but is almost certainly based on a lost original by the artist himself.\n\nProf. Flavio Caroli, curator of the Milan exhibition, says: “I am convinced that the portrait was painted by Salai from an idea by Leonardo, who was having fun with the famous image he had created ten years before.”\n\nProf. David Brown, Curator of Italian Renaissance Painting at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., added that the original naked Mona Lisa probably forms the “missing link” in a whole series of erotic portraits of men and women by Leonardo and his followers.\n\nThe copy of the Mona Lisa is a painting of the same subject as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous Mona Lisa (which is held by the Louvre Museum, Paris). The copy painting has been displayed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid (Spain) since 1819,but was considered for decades a worthless copy. However, after its restoration in 2012, the Prado’s Mona Lisa was claimed to be the earliest replica of Leonardo’s masterpiece.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of surviving replicas of Mona Lisa from the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prado’s Mona Lisa is said to be, scientifically, the version with the most historical value.\n\nLeonardo, who most historians believe was bisexual, is also said to have taken a liking to Salai.
