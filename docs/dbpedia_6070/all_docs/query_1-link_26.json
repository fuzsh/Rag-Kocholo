        "text": "Leonardo Da Vinci’s childhood was very shallow. Leonardo got his name because he was “Leonardo from Vinci,” being born in the little town of Vinci near Florence. He was born on April 15, 1452. Biography.com states that he was born to a father that was a notary, but the British Library claims that his father was a lawyer. Aside from this controversy, both say that his mother was a young, peasant country girl. Da Vinci’s parents were never married so they ended up splitting up at a young age. This is the cause for Leonardo to have 17 half brothers and half sisters. Leonardo ended up being raised by his father, Ser Piero. At a young age, Da Vinci showed his love for nature by spending a majority of his time outdoors. He had no education other than basic reading and math, but showed\n\nHis skills and experience helped him be the perfect teacher for Da Vinci. Leonardo became a qualified for membership as a master artist in Florence’s Guild of Saint Luke and established his own workshop at the age of twenty, which was very prestigious. However, he continued to collaborate with his teacher for an additional five years. While working under Verrocchio, Leonardo's contributed to Verrocchio's Baptism of Christ. In the painting, Leonardo's involvement is visible in the “ relaxed posture of the angel (far left), whose face is defined by a gentle modeling and whose eyes reveal a sense of emotional vitality” (\"Leonardo da Vinci.\", Encyclopedia, 1) and landscape depicted with a “ water framed by rocky precipices and bathed in a misty atmosphere” (“Leonardo da Vinci”, Encyclopedia 1) revealing his sincere love of nature. According to Giorgio Vasari, one of Leonardo Da Vinci’s first biographers, Verrocchio thought he should “never touching colors again, [was] angry that a boy should know more than he” (Vasari, 1).\n\nLeonardo was born on the fifteenth of April in the year of 1452, it was known as “the third hour of the night.” Vinci was born in the Tuscan hill town of Vinci, in the lower valley of the Arno River in Florence, Italy. Vinci had lots of events that went on during his lifetime. First, he was apprenticed to the one of the “most successful artists of his day,” named Andrea di Cione, which was known as Verrocchio (Leonardo Da Vinci timeline).\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci (1452-1519) is one of the most remarkable artists of the Renaissance period. Many would first describe him as an artist, but his genius surpasses being simply an artist alone. He was a mathematician, engineer, scientist, botanist, painter, sculptor, inventor, geologist, writer, anatomist, and the list goes on. Da Vinci’s curiosity and consistent quest for knowledge resulted in a great amount of contributions to society in various subjects. He is celebrated today not only for his world renowned works of art, but for his scientific discoveries and inventions as well.\n\nThe abundance and individuality of genius displayed in his notebooks brings to light one of the greatest minds of all time. Early life Leonardo Da Vinci was born on Saturday April 15 1452 around 3 a.m. in Renaissance time in Vinci, Italy. According to Marin Kemp, the world’s leading authority on Leonardo,“he was the illegitimate son of the other unknown Caterina and Ser Piero da Vinci, who was to become a prominent lawyer in Florence (10). He was born during the Renaissance, a time of rebirth of art, architecture, science, politics and literature. Da Vinci received standard education such as basic writing, math, and reading.\n\nWhen hearing the name Leonardo da Vinci, what comes to mind? For many people it will be his artwork. This is because of all of the accomplishments da Vinci has, he is most famous for his art. What many people don’t know was that he was also a scientist, inventor, and philosopher. Da Vinci lived in a time period known as the Renaissance. This was a time of knowledge and enlightenment, and it gave birth to many of the world’s most talented and educated people. Leonardo da Vinci was a very symbolic artist, but his knowledge and inventions are what led others to follow his lead, making him the main influence of the Renaissance period.\n\nBeing a leading light in the Italian Renaissance, Da Vinci has influenced countless artists and has been the motivation for many inventions of modern times. His family included his father, Ser Piero, and his stepmothers, since he was born out of wedlock. The Encyclopedia of World Biography stated, “Not much is known about Leonardo’s childhood except that when he was fifteen, his father apprenticed him to Andrea del Verrocchio, the leading artist of Florence and the early Renaissance.” Within a period of six years he learned a wide range of technical skills which include metalworking, leather arts, carpentry, drawing, and sculpting. By the time he became twenty years old he was qualified to be a master artist in the Guild of Saint Luke and established his own workshop.\n\nWhen people think of the Renaissance, one of the first to come to mind is Leonardo da Vinci. Born in 1452, da Vinci was the child of Ser Piero, a legal notary, and Caterina, a peasant. There is little information of da Vinci’s childhood. Until the age of five, he lived with his mother in the village of Anchiano. He would then go to live with his father in the town of Vinci. Leonardo never had any formal education, however, he was taught reading, Latin, and mathematics at home. As a young adult, da Vinci was fascinated by the outside world. He had a particular fascination by water and how it moved, as well as birds of prey, particularly how they flew. At the age of fifteen, da Vinci would begin apprenticing under the artist Verrochio in Florence, Italy. This is where he would start his painting career. In time, Verrochio would ask Leonardo in assisting him in painting The Baptism of Christ. Da Vinci painted the two angels in the corner so well that it proved his skill to be far superior to Verrochio. Da Vinci’s skill was so great that Verrochio vowed never to paint again. Five years later, at the age of twenty, da Vinci was given the rank of master in the Guild of Saint Luke, a group of renowned artists and doctors.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci was the son of a Florentine Notary and a peasant woman, born in Vinci, Italy during in heart of the Renaissance. Leonardo’s parents were unmarried, and after he was born his mother remarried an artesian. He grew up with his father, and although he was very smart, he was not very academically motivated. He was homeschooled, as an apprentice, and didn’t care for the study of math and language as a young boy (Leonardo da Vinci, Britannica). As he grew up, he started to understand the importance of learning subjects other than art. He learned latin, and took a job as a military engineer for two years under Cesare Borgia. After that he traveled Europe, as an engineer, architect, scientist and inventor. He did fewer paintings,\n\nLeonardo Da Vinci was born in 1452 on his father’s estate in Vinci, Italy. He received his education on the estate until the age of fifteen. Which is when his father had noticed Leonardo’s potential and had decided to send him to be an apprentice to the artist Andrea del Verrocchio in Florence. There he studied sculpture and the mechanical arts. This was also when he first developed an interest in anatomy. In 1472 Leonardo was accepted into the painters' guild at Florence, where he remained for the next ten years. In 1482, Leonardo was hired by the duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, to be artist and engineer in residence.
