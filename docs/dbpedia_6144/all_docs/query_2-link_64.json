        "text": "McAfee Antivirus Software, a household name in the world of cybersecurity, has a fascinating ownership history that has witnessed several notable changes.\n\nInitially founded by John McAfee in 1987, the company was later acquired by Intel in 2011, becoming a part of the Intel Security division. However, in 2016, Intel made a strategic decision to renounce majority ownership and sell a 51% stake in McAfee to TPG Capital. Today, TPG Capital holds the majority ownership of McAfee Antivirus Software, while Intel retains a significant minority stake in the company.\n\nThe History of McAfee Antivirus Software\n\nMcAfee is a well-known name in the world of antivirus software. Founded in 1987 by John McAfee, it has become one of the leading providers of cybersecurity solutions. However, in order to understand who currently owns McAfee Antivirus Software, it is important to delve into its history and evolution over the years.\n\nJohn McAfee, a British-American computer programmer and entrepreneur, created the first version of the McAfee antivirus software to combat the brain computer virus, one of the first computer viruses to impact IBM-PC compatible computers. McAfee's software quickly gained popularity for its ability to detect and remove viruses, making it a go-to choice for users looking to protect their computers.\n\nIn 1997, McAfee Associates went public with an Initial Public Offering (IPO), becoming one of the first purely antivirus-focused companies to do so. Over the years, McAfee continued to innovate and expand its offerings beyond antivirus software, including developing solutions for network security, data protection, and threat intelligence.\n\nIn 2011, Intel Corporation, the American multinational technology company, acquired McAfee Associates for $7.7 billion. This acquisition was seen as a strategic move by Intel to enhance its security offerings for its consumer and enterprise customers. McAfee became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intel and continued to operate under the McAfee name.\n\nMcAfee's Transition to a Standalone Company\n\nIn 2016, Intel announced that it would be spinning off McAfee as a standalone cybersecurity company. The intention was to create a more focused and independent entity that could better respond to the rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape. This move allowed McAfee to have the agility and flexibility to adapt to the changing needs of its customers.\n\nOn April 3, 2017, Intel completed the spin-off of McAfee, returning it to being a standalone company. TPG Capital, a leading global alternative asset firm, and Intel maintained joint majority ownership in McAfee with TPG holding a 51% stake and Intel retaining a 49% stake. The spin-off reinvigorated McAfee's position as a prominent player in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nSince becoming an independent company again, McAfee has focused on strengthening its portfolio of cybersecurity solutions, offering advanced protection against emerging threats such as ransomware, malware, and phishing attacks. McAfee's products encompass solutions for individuals, small and medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises, catering to a wide range of cybersecurity needs.\n\nMcAfee's Acquisition of Other Companies\n\nIn addition to its transition to a standalone company, McAfee has also expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed McAfee to enhance its offerings and tap into new technologies and expertise.\n\nIn 2018, McAfee acquired Skyhigh Networks, a cloud access security broker (CASB) company, to expand its cloud security portfolio and provide customers with increased visibility and control over their cloud environments.\n\nIn the same year, McAfee acquired TunnelBear, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) provider known for its user-friendly interface and strong encryption. This acquisition allowed McAfee to integrate TunnelBear's VPN capabilities into its consumer product offerings, providing users with an added layer of privacy and security when browsing the internet.\n\nThese acquisitions, along with others such as the purchase of Sentrigo in 2011 and Stonesoft in 2013, have enabled McAfee to broaden its product portfolio and strengthen its position in key areas of cybersecurity.\n\nMcAfee's Current Ownership\n\nIn 2020, TPG Capital announced its intention to sell a portion of its stake in McAfee through a secondary sale. As a result, another private equity firm, Permira, emerged as a new majority owner of McAfee in a deal valued at approximately $4 billion.\n\nToday, McAfee remains a private company with Permira as its majority owner and Intel retaining a minority stake. This ownership structure allows McAfee to operate with the autonomy and resources needed to continue its commitment to cybersecurity innovation and protect its customers from evolving threats.\n\nAs the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, McAfee is poised to adapt and provide cutting-edge solutions to meet the challenges of today and the future.\n\nOwnership of McAfee Antivirus Software\n\nMcAfee Antivirus Software was created by John McAfee, an American entrepreneur, in 1987. However, the ownership of the software has changed over the years.\n\nIn 1997, McAfee Associates, the company founded by John McAfee, went public and became McAfee.com Corporation. In 2006, the company was acquired by Intel Corporation and became a part of Intel Security Group. This acquisition helped Intel expand its security offerings and integrate McAfee's antivirus software into its products.\n\nIn 2016, Intel announced the spin-off of McAfee as an independent company. The majority ownership of McAfee was then transferred to TPG Capital, a private equity firm, which acquired a 51% stake. Intel retained a 49% stake in the company. In 2020, McAfee went public again through an initial public offering (IPO) and is currently listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nCurrently, McAfee is owned by a combination of shareholders including TPG Capital, Intel, and other institutional and individual investors. McAfee continues to develop and provide antivirus software to protect millions of users worldwide.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nMcAfee Antivirus Software is a widely-used security software program that helps protect computers and devices from malware, viruses, and other online threats. As a result of its popularity, many people are curious about who owns the McAfee Antivirus Software. Here are some frequently asked questions about the ownership of McAfee Antivirus Software:\n\n1. What company owns McAfee Antivirus Software?\n\nThe McAfee Antivirus Software is currently owned by McAfee LLC, which is a subsidiary of Intel Corporation. Intel acquired McAfee in 2010 and operated it under the Intel Security division. However, in April 2017, Intel announced the sale of a majority stake in McAfee to TPG Capital, a private equity firm. As a result, McAfee became an independent company once again.\n\nIt is important to note that McAfee LLC is not to be confused with its founder, John McAfee, who is no longer associated with the company and has pursued other ventures.\n\n2. Why did Intel sell McAfee Antivirus Software?\n\nIntel sold a majority stake in McAfee to TPG Capital as a strategic move. The company decided to focus more on its core business of manufacturing and developing computer processors, instead of investing resources into the cybersecurity sector. By selling McAfee, Intel aimed to streamline its operations and allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite selling the majority stake, Intel retained a minority ownership in McAfee to maintain a strategic partnership and collaboration on security technologies.\n\n3. Who is the current CEO of McAfee Antivirus Software?\n\nPeter Leav is the current CEO of McAfee Antivirus Software. He assumed the role in February 2021. Prior to joining McAfee, Leav held executive positions at various technology companies, including Polycom and BMC Software. His extensive experience in the software industry makes him well-suited to lead McAfee and its cybersecurity efforts.\n\n4. Is McAfee still a reputable antivirus software?\n\nYes, McAfee Antivirus Software is still considered a reputable antivirus software. Over the years, McAfee has built a strong reputation in the cybersecurity industry and has consistently provided reliable protection against various threats. It offers a range of features, including real-time scanning, firewall protection, and regular updates to stay ahead of emerging threats.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the effectiveness of any antivirus software can vary depending on factors such as the user's computer setup, security practices, and the evolving nature of cyber threats. It is always recommended to use multiple layers of security and stay vigilant while browsing the internet.\n\n5. Can I trust McAfee Antivirus Software with my personal data?\n\nMcAfee Antivirus Software is designed to protect your personal data and provide you with a secure online experience. As a reputable software provider, McAfee has strict privacy policies in place to ensure the confidentiality and security of user information.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to follow best practices for online security, such as regularly updating the software, using strong and unique passwords, and being cautious while clicking on suspicious links or downloading files. Taking these precautions can further enhance the trustworthiness of McAfee Antivirus Software in safeguarding your personal data.\n\nTo conclude, McAfee Antivirus Software is currently owned by the global technology company, Intel. Intel acquired McAfee in 2011 and has since integrated it into its security division. This acquisition has allowed Intel to enhance its cybersecurity offerings and provide comprehensive solutions to its customers.\n\nSince Intel's acquisition, McAfee has continued to be a trusted name in the antivirus industry, providing protection against various online threats. It remains one of the leading antivirus software providers, offering robust security solutions for individuals and businesses alike."
