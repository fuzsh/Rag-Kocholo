        "text": "Intel-owned McAfee is announcing an acquisition this morning—database security company Sentrigo. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nSentrigo, which has raised $19 million in venture funding from Benchmark Capital, Stata Venture Partners and Juniper Networks,, provides host-based software that protects enterprise databases by monitoring all activity in the database in real-time, providing alerts, audit trail, virtual patching and automatic intrusion prevention capabilities. Sentrigo’s solution, called Hedgehog, uses a very small footprint non-intrusive agent that has complete visibility into all database activity, whether it is originated by outsiders or privileged insiders, and does so without impacting database performance.\n\nMcAfee actually partnered with Sentrigo in 2010, entering into an OEM agreement to support and offer McAfee’s own database security software, including McAfee Vulnerability Manager for Databases, McAfee Database Activity Monitoring, and McAfee Integrity Monitoring for Databases\n\nDave DeWalt, president of McAfee said of the acquisition: McAfee is continuing to broaden its security portfolio to now-secure databases, as well as endpoints, networks, email and web. He added that the company is also announcing a “complete database security platform” which includes products across the McAfee portfolio.\n\nMcAfee’s Vulnerability Manager for Databases will automatically discover all databases on the network, collect a full inventory of configuration details, and determine if the latest patches have been applied and scans for vulnerabilities. McAfee’s Database Activity Monitoring (DAM), not only tracks database changes, but also protects data from external threats and malicious insiders with real-time alerts and session termination."
