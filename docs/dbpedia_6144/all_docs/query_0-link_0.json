        "text": "Sentrigo was a privately held software company located in Santa Clara, California, USA, until its acquisition in April, 2011 by McAfee.[1]\n\nThe company was founded in 2006 by Nathan Shuchami and Slavik Markovich, to address several key challenges in Database security. Specifically, the inability to monitor activity of privileged users[2] and those who have established such credentials through nefarious means, and the difficulty in maintaining a DBMS at the most current patch level. The company's products have expanded to include a broader suite of database security offerings, including database audit and vulnerability assessment as well.\n\nInvestors in Sentrigo included: Benchmark Capital, Stata Ventures and Juniper Networks.[3][4]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
