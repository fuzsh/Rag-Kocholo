        "text": "McKinsey's just released report on its third annual survey of the usage and benefits of Web 2.0 technology was enlightening as far as it went. However, it completely ignores the IT security risks Web 2.0 creates. Furthermore, traditional IT security products do not mitigate these risks. If we are going to deploy Web 2.0 technology, then we need to upgrade our security to, dare I say, \"IT Security 2.0.\"\n\nEven if Web 2.0 products had no vulnerabilities for cybercriminals to exploit, which is not possible, there is still the need for a control function, i.e. which applications should be allowed and who should be able to use them. Unfortunately traditional security vendors have had limited success with both. Fortunately, there are security vendors who have recognized this as an opportunity\n\nand have built solutions which mitigate these new risks.\n\nIn the past, I had never subscribed to the concept of security enabling innovation, but I do in this case. There is no doubt that improved communication, learning, and collaboration within the organization and with customers and suppliers enhances the organization's competitive position. Ignoring Web 2.0 or letting it happen by itself is not an option. Therefore when planning Web 2.0 projects, we must also include plans for mitigating the new risks Web 2.0 applications create.\n\nThe Web 2.0 good news – The survey results are very positive:\n\n\"69 percent of respondents report that their companies have gained\n\nmeasurable business benefits, including more innovative products and\n\nservices, more effective marketing, better access to knowledge, lower\n\ncost of doing business, and higher revenues.\n\nCompanies that made\n\ngreater use of the technologies, the results show, report even greater\n\nbenefits. We also looked closely at the factors driving these\n\nimprovements—for example, the types of technologies companies are\n\nusing, management practices that produce benefits, and any\n\norganizational and cultural characteristics that may contribute to the\n\ngains. We found that successful companies not only tightly integrate\n\nWeb 2.0 technologies with the work flows of their employees but also\n\ncreate a “networked company,” linking themselves with customers and\n\nsuppliers through the use of Web 2.0 tools. Despite the current\n\nrecession, respondents overwhelmingly say that they will continue to\n\ninvest in Web 2.0.\"\n\nThe Web 2.0 bad news – Web 2.0 technologies introduce IT security risks that cannot be ignored. The main risk comes from the fact that these applications are purposely built to bypass traditional IT security controls in order to simplify deployment and increase usage. They use techniques such as port hopping, encrypted tunneling, and browser based applications. If we cannot identify these applications and the people using them, we cannot monitor or control them. Any exploitation of vulnerabilities in these applications can go undetected until it's too late.\n\nA second risk is bandwidth consumption. For example, unauthorized and uncontrolled consumer-oriented video and audio file sharing applications consume large chunks of bandwidth. How much? Hard to know if we cannot see them.\n\nIn case we need some examples of the bad news, just in the last few days see here, here, here, and here.\n\nThe IT Security 2.0 good news – There are new IT Security 2.0 vendors who are addressing these issues in different ways as follows:\n\nDatabase Activity Monitoring – Since we cannot depend on traditional perimeter defenses, we must protect the database itself. Database encryption, another technology, is also useful. But if someone has stolen authorized credentials (very common with trojan keyloggers), encryption is of no value. I discussed Database Activity Monitoring in more detail here. It's also useful for compliance reporting when integrated with application users.\n\nUser Activity Monitoring – Network appliances designed to\n\nmonitor internal user activity and block actions that are out of\n\npolicy. Also useful for compliance reporting.\n\nWeb Application Firewalls – Web server host-based software or appliances specifically designed to analyze anomalies in browser-based applications. WAFs are not meant to be primary firewalls but rather to be used to monitor the Layer 7 fields of browser-based forms into which users enter information. Cybercriminals enter malicious code which, if not detected and blocked, can trigger a wide range of exploits. It's also useful for PCI compliance.\n\n\"Web 2.0\" Firewalls – Next generation network firewalls that can detect and control Web 2.0 applications in addition to traditional firewall functions. They also identify users and can analyze content. They can also perform URL filtering, intrusion prevention, proxying, and data leak prevention. This multi-function capability can be used to generate significant cost reductions by (1) consolidating network appliances and (2) unifying policy management and compliance reporting.\n\nI have heard this type of firewall referred to as an Application Firewall. But it seems confusing to me because it's too close to Web Application Firewall, which I described above and performs completely different functions. Therefore, I prefer the term, Web 2.0 Firewall.\n\nIn conclusion, Web 2.0 is real and IT Security 2.0 must be part of Web 2.0 strategy. Put another way, IT Security 2.0 enables Web 2.0.\n\nControversy around the PCI DSS compliance program increased recently when Robert Carr, the CEO of Heartland Payment Systems, in an article in CSO Online, attacked his QSAs saying, \"The audits done by our QSAs (Qualified Security Assessors) were of no value whatsoever. To the extent that they were telling us we were secure beforehand, that we were PCI compliant, was a major problem.\"\n\nMike Rothman, Senior VP of eIQNetworks responded to Mr. Carr's comments not so much to defend PCI but to place PCI in perspective, i.e. compliance does not equal security. I discussed this myself in my post about the 8 Dirty Secrets of IT Security, specifically in my comments on Dirty Secret #6 – Compliance Threatens Security.\n\nEric Ogren, a security industry analyst, continued the attack on PCI in his article in SearchSecurity last week where he said, \"The federal indictment this week of three men for their roles in the\n\nlargest data security breach in U.S. history also serves as an\n\nindictment of sorts against the fraud conducted by PCI – placing the\n\nburden of security costs onto retailers and card processors when what\n\nis really needed is the payment card industry investing in a secure\n\nbusiness process.\"\n\nThe federal indictment to which Eric Ogren referred was that of Albert Gonzalez and others for the breaches at Heartland Payment Services, 7-Eleven, Hannaford, and two national retailers referred to as Company A and Company B. Actually this is the second federal indictment of Albert Gonzalez that I am aware of. The first, filed in Massachusetts in August 2008, was for the breaches at BJ's Wholesale Club, DSW, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sport Authority, and TJX.\n\nBob Russo, the general manager of the PCI Security Standards Council disagreed with Eric Ogren's characterizations of PCI, saying that retailers and credit card processors must take responsibility for protecting cardholder information.\n\nRich Mogull, CEO and Analyst at Securosis, responded to Bob Russo's article with recommendations to improve the PCI compliance program which he characterized as an \"overall positive development for the state of security.\" He went on to say, \"In other words, as much as PCI is painful, flawed, and ineffective, it\n\nhas also done more to improve security than any other regulation or\n\nindustry initiative in the past 10 years. Yes, it's sometimes a\n\ndistraction; and the checklist mentality reduces security in some environments, but overall I see it as a net positive.\"\n\nRich Mogull seems to agree with Eric Ogren that the credit card companies have the responsibility and the power to improve the technical foundations of credit card transactions. In addition, he calls the PCI Council to task for such issues as:\n\nincomplete and/or weak compliance requirements\n\nQSA shopping\n\nthe conflict of interest they created by allowing QSA's to perform audits and then sell security services based on the findings of the audits.\n\nClearly organizations have no choice but to comply with mandatory regulations. But the compliance process must be part of an overall risk management process. In other words, the compliance process is not equal to the risk management process but a component of it.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the enterprise risk management process must be more agile and responsive to new security threats than a bureaucratic regulatory body can be. For example, it may be some time before the PCI standards are updated to specify that firewalls must be able to work at the application level so all the the Web 2.0 applications traversing the enterprise network can be controlled. This is an important issue today as this has been a major vector for compromising systems that are then used for funds transfer fraud."
