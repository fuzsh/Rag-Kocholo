New enablement resources, including the Expert Center and Post-Sales Services Enablement are also available.\n\nEnhanced Partner Experience We’re launching new platforms to improve your experience.\n\nPartner 360 Dashboard provides a single source of truth allowing you to make better long-term business decisions.\n\nSMARTmarketing Platform provides you with turn-key marketing programs to drive awareness, generate demand, track ROI, and drive sales in 2015.\n\nPartner Learning Center has a streamlined interface and navigation to help you take your sales and technical training to the next level.\n\nWith all these exciting changes, I encourage you to learn more about the new partner program by visiting www.mcafee.com/partners/ and reviewing our new McAfee Partner Program infographic.\n\nIntroducing McAfee+\n\nIdentity theft protection and privacy for your digital life\n\nMcAfee Blog Archives\n\nWe're here to make life online safe and enjoyable for everyone.\n\nMore from Internet Security\n\nHow Not to Fall for Smishing Scams\n\nCellphones have helped us to be connected with even more people and access a wealth of information...\n\nAug 14, 2024 | 4 MIN READ\n\nHow Secure is Video Conferencing?\n\nFor millions of people, it’s not a workday without it—video conferencing.
