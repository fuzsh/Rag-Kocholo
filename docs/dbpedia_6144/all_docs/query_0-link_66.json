        "text": "McAfee announced that It'll acquire Sentrigo, a Database security vendor. With this move McAfee aims to extend its branded security veil to the enterprise database.\n\nThe companies already offer database products together, under an OEM agreement that allows Sentrigo to offer McAfee Vulnerability Manager for Databases, McAfee Database Activity Monitoring and McAfee Integrity Monitoring for Databases. The acquisition allows McAfee to lock up the relationship and should give it the flexibility to expand deeper into database security.\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in early April 2011 and will bring together best-in-class technologies to:\n\nStop database attacks, including SQL injection, the number one web-borne threat against databases\n\nMinimize the risk of a breach of personally identifiable information and other sensitive data, reduce breach-associated notification costs, and ensure audit compliance and reporting\n\nDiagnose and assess the database environment so customers detect threats before they are exploited and receive the optimum security for their unique infrastructure\n\nBuild on the McAfee Risk and Compliance portfolio and expand current vulnerability management solutions to include operating systems, networks, web applications, and databases\n\nProvide complete visibility into all transactions by leveraging database audit and database activity monitoring solutions\n\nLeverage Sentrigo’s unique virtual patching capability to deliver a strong level of protection for database systems — without the downtime and application testing associated with vendor patching\n\nFor move information see:- http://www.sentrigo.com/news/2011/03/23/...-by-mcafee"
