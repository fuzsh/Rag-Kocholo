        "text": "Database Security Vendor Sentrigo to be Acquired by McAfee\n\nMcAfee has announced its intention to acquire Sentrigo, a privately owned provider of database security and compliance, assessment, monitoring and intrusion prevention solutions. In addition, McAfee has also announced a comprehensive database security solution to protect business-critical databases without impacting performance and availability. McAfee's coordinated approach based on the Security Connected initiative launched in October 2010, involves protecting a company's most important data assets from network to server to the database itself, resulting in data being protected in every state (data in motion, data at rest, and data in use) via access controls, network security, server security, data protection and encryption - all centrally managed to minimize risk and maximize efficiency.\n\nNew OAUG President Mark C. Clark Talks with DBTA about 2011 Education and Events for Oracle Users\n\nA member of the Oracle Applications Users Group (OAUG) since 1992, Mark C. Clark recently took over as president of the organization. He spoke with DBTA about what's in store for members at the annual Oracle users conference COLLABORATE as well as for the year ahead. Helping members prepare for an upgrade to Oracle Applications Release 12, providing additional smaller, more targeted regional events, and a continued emphasis on a return to the basics with networking and education are at the top of his to-do list for 2011.\n\nProtecting Data at the Source - Q&A with Application Security’s John Ottman, Author of ‘Save the Database, Save the World’\n\nDespite highly publicized data breaches, ranging from the loss of personally identifiable information such as credit card and Social Security numbers at major corporations to the WikiLeaks scandal involving sensitive U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. State Department information, and the \"alphabet soup\" of compliance regulations, data around the globe remains at grave risk, according to John Ottman, president and CEO of Application Security, Inc., who has written \"Save the Database, Save the World\" to focus attention on the problem and present steps to its solution. While super secure networks are important, that alone is far from enough and a layered data security strategy with a commitment to \"protecting data where it lives - in the database\" must be pursued to avoid risks posed by outside hackers as well as authorized users, says Ottman. A stronger government hand may be needed as well to defend \"the critical infrastructure that operates in the private sector,\" he suggests.\n\nRevolution Analytics and IBM Netezza Partner to Offer Enterprise Open Source Statistics Language\n\nRevolution Analytics, a commercial provider of software and services based on the open source R project for statistical computing, and IBM Netezza announced they are teaming up to integrate Revolution R Enterprise and the IBM Netezza TwinFin Data Warehouse Appliance. According to the vendors, this will enable customers to directly leverage the capabilities of the open source R statistics language as they run high-performance predictive analytics from within data warehouse platforms.\n\nEnhancing the Look and Feel of MultiValue Applications – Q & A with BlueFinity’s Bob Markowitz\n\nBlueFinity's mv.NET is a tool kit that allows developers to use industry-standard technology to enhance existing MultiValue applications by integrating with Microsoft .NET technologies, explains Bob Markowitz, sales executive at BlueFinity International. While giving MultiValue developers the use of industry-standard technology to present existing MultiValue applications as modern solutions, it also separates the MultiValue knowledge requirement from the Microsoft technology requirement. \"In order for the MultiValue platform to thrive, we must allow the major software developer communities around the world to be able to access and utilize the platform in ways which they find familiar and comfortable,\" Markowitz says."
