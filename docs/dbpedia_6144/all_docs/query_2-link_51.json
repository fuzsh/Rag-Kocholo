        "text": "CEO: Stephen Hsu\n\nWhat the company offers: Syberus behavior-based malware-detection client software, an antimalware browser plug-in and the RGcrawler Web-crawling technology that looks for malware executables on the Internet.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: Although signature-based antivirus technology has a venerable history defending against known threats, the security industry is looking at other methods, such as behavior-based defenses that identify and block threats based on behavior. Robot Genius has come up with its own approach to malware detection to determine unsafe executables, and it could get picked up by the larger industry under a licensing plan.\n\nHow the company got its start: Hsu and CTO James Hormuzdiar teamed on start-up SafeWeb, sold it to Symantec for $26 million in 2003, and decided to continue working together to found another company to develop a new way to protect against malware.\n\nWhere the company got its name: Implies the technology’s ability to replicate automatically the downloading and testing of executables off the Internet.\n\nCustomers: Not disclosed.\n\nSailPoint\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nHeadquarters: Austin\n\nFunding: $14 million from venture capital firms including Austin Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Origin Partners and Silverton Partners\n\nCEO: Mark McClain\n\nWhat the company offers: Compliance IQ, identity risk-management software to help enterprises reduce business risk and become compliant by better understanding identity data. The software provides business context to the information generated by IT systems that report on which users have access to what data, offering sophisticated reporting and analytics for decision support.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: The company’s product attempts to make sense of the reams of identity data generated by IT systems and applications; it’s one thing to know what users are doing, it’s another to combine that information with data about what they are allowed to do. Companies that combine the two stand a better chance of identifying fraud, theft and misuse. IDC estimated in 2006 the market for identity and access-management compliance will grow by 25% per year until it reaches $2 billion in 2010.\n\nHow the company got its start: McClain and SailPoint co-founder Kevin Cunningham stayed on at WaveSet when Sun acquired it in late 2003, but not for long. In 2005 with $5 million in funding behind them, the pair left Sun and began developing the technology behind Compliance IQ, which launched at Network World’s DEMO 07 conference last January.\n\nWhere the company got its name: “Sailpoint” or “point of sail” is a term used to describe a sailboat’s course in relation to the wind. To reach a destination, sailpoints must be adjusted continuously to harness the wind as efficiently as possible and to maintain safe control of the boat — the company believes the same is true of enterprise IT governance.\n\nCustomers: Financial services and manufacturing firms, which the company declined to identify.\n\nSentrigo\n\nFounded: 2006\n\nHeadquarters: Kfar Saba, Israel; U.S. office in Woburn, Mass.\n\nFunding: $3.5 million from Benchmark Capital\n\nCEO: Nathan Shuchami\n\nWhat the company offers: Database security monitoring tool, Hedgehog, released in June for the Oracle database.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: The Hedgehog software can be used in monitoring or blocking mode to warn security administrators about attempted SQL injection or buffer-overflow attacks. Because Hedgehog also looks at larger database actions, it also watches what insiders are doing, based on set policies.\n\nHow the company got its start: CTO Slavik Markovich, an expert in database architecture, sensed an opportunity on the security front and headed up basic product design and development. Sentrigo just added Guy Rinat as vice president of R&D, an activity formerly managed by Markovich, who will devote more time to new-product development and customer interaction.\n\nWhere the company got its name: They focused on the word “sentry” and came up with Sentrigo.\n\nCustomers: N.E.W. Customer Service Companies\n\nVenafi\n\nFounded: 2004\n\nHeadquarters: Salt Lake City\n\nFunding: $20 million in venture capital from Foundation Capital, Origin Partners, and UV Partners.\n\nCEO: Trell Rohovit\n\nWhat the company offers: Systems management for encryption at the client and server levels. Client Encryption Manager and Server Encryption Manager automate many of the manual tasks associated with administering encryption technology — including keys and certificates —such as making sure that installed software with optional encryption settings has them turned on. The company plans to add encryption-management products for storage, backup systems, network devices and infrastructure in the near future.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: Venafi focuses on making encryption more accessible for enterprises by lessening its associated administrative headaches. The company says this promotes compliance, data security and risk mitigation.\n\nHow the company got its start: Spun out of IMCentric, a custom-engineering company that was automating encryption for a Fortune 500 company. The custom product that was developed turned into Venafi’s offering.\n\nWhere the company got its name: Comes from the Latin root “vena,” meaning vein or root, and “fides,” Latin for trust or faith. Venafi says it manages the root of trust.\n\nCustomers: The company claims 10 of the world’s top financial-services companies are customers, as well as three telecommunications giants.\n\nVeracode\n\nFounded: 2007\n\nHeadquarters: Burlington, Mass.\n\nFunding: $19.5 million from venture capital firms 406 Ventures, Atlas Venture and Polaris Venture Partners\n\nCEO: Former Symantec executive Matt Moynahan\n\nWhat the company offers: SecurityReview is an automated service that does security testing and remediation of in-house and commercial applications. Enterprises submit the applications they would like reviewed to Veracode, which uses patented binary and Web-scanning technology to find flaws and suggest fixes.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: According to Gartner, 70% of all enterprise vulnerabilities reside in the software that organizations buy and run. Veracode’s team of application-security experts are trained to spot such weaknesses, and can do so because the company’s service examines binary code instead of source code to avoid trade-secret concerns. By reviewing an application’s binary code the service can analyze not just the program but also third-party libraries it may call, as well as its interactions with other software.\n\nHow the company got its start: Its founders’ ambition was to reduce the number of software vulnerabilities in the world. They call their approach the “democratization of security” because usually only companies with very deep pockets have the time and money to spend on checking and remediating software security flaws. The technology behind Veracode’s service was first developed by @stake (since acquired by Symantec) in 2002.\n\nWhere the company got its name: “Ver,” from the Latin “truth,” was added to “code” to describe how the company looks for the “truth” in software.\n\nCustomers: Cisco, Digivera, Telus.\n\nWebLOQ\n\nFounded: January 2004 (in stealth mode until the service launched in September)\n\nHeadquarters: Monterey, Calif.\n\nFunding: More than $3 million from high-net-worth individuals, no venture capital\n\nCEO: Neal Smith\n\nWhat the company offers: Virtual Private Community (VPC), a private communications service that forms virtual business communities whose members can send and receive encrypted e-mail, documents and other exchanges safely. The service sets up a private domain name for each user and gives them a related e-mail address reserved for private communications with other WebLOQ users. VPC is available as a hosted service, with a version that companies can run internally slated for release early next year.\n\nWhy it’s worth watching: Instead of trying to protect communications at the edges of corporate networks, WebLOQ secures the transit channel itself. By having encrypted communications only with other members of a community, users are freed from spam, viruses, phishing, and other e-mail Internet threats. However, such secure communications requires that both parties use the service. The company hopes to bring the concept of online community to the business world while ridding e-mail of the many threats plaguing it today.\n\nHow the company got its start: Chairman, CTO, and former ISP head George Sidman became intrigued with the idea of securing Internet communications. He formed a team at his ISP to begin working on the problem in 2003 and launched the service in 2007.\n\nWhere the company got its name: Sidman was amazed that no one had trademarked “LOQ” (pronounced “lock”) as a brand. The company now has trademarked the terms WebLOQ and LOQ, intending to launch a brand around the latter."
