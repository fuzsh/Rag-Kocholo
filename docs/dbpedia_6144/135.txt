WOBURN, Mass. -- Sentrigo, Inc., an innovator in database security software, today announced the immediate availability of the first substantial update to its Hedgehog security software for Oracle databases. Version 1.2 expands operating system support for Hedgehog, automatically quarantines users based on attempts to misuse the database, provides improved support for enterprise use across many databases and offers enhanced monitoring and alert functions.

Hedgehog is the first software-only solution that protects databases from privileged insiders such as developers, database administrators and consultants, as well as from external intrusions. Not only can the software monitor all local access, but also the actions performed by stored procedures, views and triggers, making Hedgehog the only solution with the ability to detect and obstruct sophisticated attack vectors and modus operandi accessible to privileged users. This capability also provides a solid foundation for reliable auditing required for regulatory compliance.

Hedgehog, including a community edition that may be deployed and used free of charge, is available for download at www.sentrigo.com.

Since we launched Hedgehog in June 2007, we have seen the successful deployment of Hedgehog across dozens of businesses in a variety of industries worldwide,” said Slavik Markovich, CTO of Sentrigo. “We are committed to frequent updates to Hedgehog to help customers secure their databases against nefarious use and make database security easy to implement. Based on specific feedback from customers, Sentrigo has added significant upgrades to Hedgehog Enterprise edition. Our goal is to extend database support beyond Oracle within the coming months and to make Sentrigo the de facto standard in database security.”
