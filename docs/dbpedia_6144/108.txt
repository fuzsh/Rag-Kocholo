Sentrigo, Inc., a provider of database security and data protection solutions for the data center and the cloud, said it has secured $6 million in a Series C funding round. The round included participation from existing investors Benchmark Capital and Stata Venture Partners, as well as a new strategic investment from Juniper Networks, through the Junos Innovation Fund. The financing will allow Sentrigo to increase global sales and marketing activities in support of its rapid revenue growth rate, as well as to continue expanding its database security and data integrity solutions for the cloud.

Sentrigo's suite of database security and compliance solutions includes components for vulnerability assessment, real-time monitoring, virtual patching and low-overhead audit. Sentrigo's products monitor database threats and activity locally on each database server, allowing efficient and effective operation regardless of the deployment model. Sentrigo Hedgehog Enterprise is designed to protect sensitive data either on premises or in the cloud, from both external attacks as well as misuse by privileged insiders, addressing critical issues related to compliance audits for key industry regulations.

"Sentrigo's approach to securing sensitive information is a key enabler to cloud computing, allowing organizations to deploy the applications they desire, while maintaining compliance," says Nathan Shuchami, CEO of Sentrigo. "We have experienced tremendous growth this year, and as more and more customer infrastructure moves to the cloud, Sentrigo is uniquely positioned to become the leading provider of real-time protection for critical data. Backed by both customer and investor support, we look forward to continuing to innovate with our products, and to bringing their benefits to a wider range of users."
