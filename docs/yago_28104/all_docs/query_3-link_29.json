        "text": "JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais and Napoleon Bonaparteâs relationship is the stuff of legends. But before they met, de Beauharnais experienced significant hardship. Even after she married Napoleonâher second husbandâher life was far from a fairytale.Â\n\nAhead of the release of Ridley Scottâs biopic Napoleon, here are 11 facts about JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais, the woman who, for 14 years, stood in the emperorâs shadow.Â\n\n1. JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais was almost born British.\n\nJosÃ©phineâs family owned sugar plantations in tiny Martinique, a French colony in the Caribbean Sea. The French and British had been fighting for control over the island as part of the Seven Years War, with the British seizing control of Martinique in 1762. The conflict between the two countries ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which saw Martinique pass back to French ownership just four months before JosÃ©phine was born.\n\n2. The name JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais never existedâat least not within her own lifetime.\n\nJosÃ©phine was the eldest child of Joseph Tascher de La Pagerie, a gambler who squandered the familyâs wealth. BornÂ Marie-Joseph-Rose on June 23, 1763, her family knew her as Yeyette, and in adulthood she was known simply as Rose or Marie-Rose. When she married Alexandre, Viscount of Beauharnais in 1779, she became Vicomtesse de Beauharnais.Â\n\nIt was Napoleon who preferred to call her JosÃ©phine, and shortly after meeting him she became JosÃ©phine Bonaparte. JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais is a conflation of her lifetime names that history bestowed in retrospect.\n\n3. She was a widow before she met Napoleon.Â\n\nJosÃ©phineâs marriage to Alexandre was arranged by their two familiesâshe was only 16 when she sailed to France to meet her new husband. Alexandre showed little interest in his bride; by all accounts, his motivations in marrying her were social expectation and to facilitate access to his inheritance. After being unimpressed with attempts to educate her, he left in favor of his mistress, Laure de LongprÃ©, who bore him a child. Alexandre got his comeuppance when he met the guillotine during the Reign of Terror.\n\n4. JosÃ©phine had two children with Alexandre, Viscount of Beauharnais.\n\nThough JosÃ©phineâs marriage to Alexandre was not a happy one, it was still fruitful: the couple had two children, a son and daughter. After their separation, their daughter, Hortense (born April 10, 1783), stayed with JosÃ©phine while their son, EugÃ¨ne (born September 3, 1781), eventually went to live with Alexandre. Both children stayed close to their mother throughout her life.\n\nNapoleon was fond of his stepchildren, treating them like his own, and EugÃ¨ne often accompanied him on his military campaigns. When JosÃ©phineâs relationship with Napoleon was floundering, she encouraged a marriage between Hortense and Napoleonâs brother Louis, in no small part to stabilize her own situation. The union made JosÃ©phine a mother-in-law to her brother-in-law, and when Louis became King of Holland, Hortense becameÂ Queen.Â\n\n5. JosÃ©phine changed her birthdate on their marriage certificate to seem closer in age to Napoleon.\n\nAfter a brief courtship, Napoleon and JosÃ©phine married on March, 9, 1796, in the town hall ofÂ Parisâs 2nd Arrondissement. It was a rushed affair, to which Napoleon arrived two hours late. JosÃ©phine was 32, he was 26; the age difference famously led them both to alter their birthdates on the marriage certificate so they would appear of a similar age. JosÃ©phine subtracted four years, and Napoleon added 18 months.\n\n6. JosÃ©phine had in-law trouble from the start.\n\nThe Bonaparte family took an immediate dislike to JosÃ©phine. As an older woman with children, they didnât think she was a suitable match for Napoleon. Her immodest, spendthrift nature was counter to their ideals of a frugal, family-oriented woman and they found her social ease and sophistication threatening. Throughout her relationship with Napoleon, her in-laws conspired to get rid of her, and were happy when the couple finally separated.Â\n\n7. JosÃ©phine married Napoleon twice.\n\nUnsatisfied with the secular proclamation that saw him become Emperor Napoleon I in May 1804, Napoleon desired an additional religious consecration. However, Pope Pius VII baulked at the thought of an imperial couple who, by not having had a religious ceremony, were cohabiting in sin. He insisted they make the marriage official by undertaking religious vows first, which they speedily took on December 1, 1804âthe day before their coronation.\n\n8. Napoleon crowned JosÃ©phine Empress himself.\n\nThe coronation took place at Notre-Dame cathedral on December 2, 1804, in the presence of Pope Pius VII, with a carefully planned ceremony. For Napoleon, there was a trade-off between having the Popeâs blessing and showing that his status was being granted by the will of the people: rather than having the Pope perform their coronation, Napoleon crowned himself. He then placed JosÃ©phineâs crown first on his own head, and then on hers. Through Napoleon, JosÃ©phine became Empress of the French and Queen of Italy.\n\n9. JosÃ©phine may have been infertile by the time she married Napoleon.\n\nOn numerous occasions, JosÃ©phine attempted to counter her infertility by traveling to PlombiÃ¨res-les-Bains, a thermal spa town in eastern France where the waters were long-renowned for their healing properties. Despite this, she did not conceive a child with Napoleon. The exact cause of her infertility is unknown, but according to some historians, itâs possible that years of using toxicity-laden make-up and contraceptive douches could have been a factor. The coupleâs lack of a legitimate heirâNapoleon successfully conceived at least one child from his affairsâled to the annulment of their marriage in 1810.Â\n\n10. JosÃ©phine had several brushes with death.Â\n\nIn 1788, JosÃ©phine returned to her home island, Martinique, ostensibly to see her aging mother, and likely motivated to flee from the debts and scandal she accrued due to her many affairs at court. She narrowly dodged a cannonball on her way to the ship after burgeoning social unrest in Martinique caused her to flee back to France.\n\nHer troubles were not over back in Terror-struck Paris. In 1794, after her brother-in-law was imprisoned for his royalist sympathies, Alexandre and then JosÃ©phine herself followed in close succession. Alexandre was unjustly found guilty and taken to meet the guillotine. JosÃ©phine would have followed, were it not for a twist of fate. Within days of Alexandreâs execution, the regime was toppled, the Reign of Terror ended, and JosÃ©phine was among the many prisoners released.\n\nShe even experienced an ordinary outing that turned almost deadly. In 1798, JosÃ©phine was visiting PlombiÃ¨res-les-Bains when she and her entourage were beckoned to the first-floor balcony by a maid who had witnessed something of interest outside. They all fell when the balcony collapsed under their combined weight. JosÃ©phine was left temporarily unable to walk with terrible back pains and a suspected broken pelvis.Â\n\nHer husbandâs career didnât help either. In 1800, Napoleon was First Consul of the French Republic, a position that brought with it many enemies. On Christmas Eve, a failed assassination attempt took place while he was traveling in a carriage to the opera. Napoleon was unscathed, but JosÃ©phineâs carriage was damaged, injuring her daughter and bystanders.\n\nJosÃ©phine met her eventual untimely end when she was only 51, at her home in Chateau de Malmaison. She caught a cold and refused to rest, maintaining her social engagements. JosÃ©phine then developed a fever and got progressively sicker in just a matter of days. She died on May 19, 1814.Â Â\n\n11. JosÃ©phine is entombed next to her daughter."
