        "text": "Summary\n\nKaterina Jebb is a British-born artist who lives and works in Paris. She is known for her use of a high-resolution scanner and works across a range of media including photography, film and installation. Jebb studied drama at St Anneâs College, Oxford, before moving to California. There, she experimented with photography, making photomontages within the camera itself through the repeated exposure of a single roll film. Jebb relocated to Paris in 1989 and worked for the French newspaper LibÃ©ration as a photojournalist. An accident in 1991 caused her right arm to become paralysed. She was no longer able to hold a camera and began to make life-size images using a high-resolution scanner.\n\nIn 2016, Jebbâs photography was the subject of a solo exhibition at the MusÃ©e RÃ©attu in Arles, France, which included over one hundred artefacts and moving images from Jebbâs career and invited visitors into her creative process.\n\nThis photograph from the exhibition is a high-resolution scanned image of a dress worn by JosÃ©phine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte. Jebb borrowed the historic object from the collections at the Parisian MusÃ©e Galliera. Most scanners require a covering over the object to be scanned. Because of the three-dimensional quality of her historic object, Jebb cut a box-shaped piece of cardboard to the size of the scannerâs panel, which she then held over the object in order to reflect light back to the scanner."
