        "text": "During the Napoleonic Era, from 1799 to 1815, France became a military power gaining and controlling land throughout Europe. While some historians believe Napoleon Bonaparte was a ruthless dictator, his military accomplishments far outweigh any atrocities he committed. He helped France gain stability after the French Revolution and he also abolished the Feudal contract. Napoleon was a brilliant strategist using military tactics to cause fear and to defeat whatever enemies stood in his way. Throughout his rule, Napoleon continually gained ground, and by the end of his reign, his empire encompassed all of Spain, Italy, and a small portion of land by Russia and Austria. (see map) He is one of\n\nNapoleon was one of the most influential people in the history of the world. He has affected people throughout the globe in many ways. He rose through the confusion of the French revolution to become Emperor of the French. His goal was to conquer all of Europe. Through out his lifetime he nearly succeeded in his goal. Napoleon was probably one of the greatest military leaders that ever lived. Napoleon Bonaparte, who is also known as the \"little Corsican\", was born on August 15,1769 in Ajaccio, Corsica. He was known as the \"little Corsican\" because of his height of 5 feet 2 inches. He had 7 brothers and sisters. His original name was Napoleon Bonaparte in Corsica but it\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, an influential leader of France, was a man of many facets. On one the one hand, Napoleon was a strong leader who created durable institutions and strengthened France, but on the other, there is a more pitiful view of Napoleon. The view of Napoleon was initially very positive: he viewed himself as a protector of the people, and the people saw this too; however, over time, this image was greatly worsened, due to military hardship.\n\nJefferson started to feel lonely so he decided to look for a wife. Looking for a wife was very difficult for him because he was a shy man and he didn’t know how to talk to women so he didn’t have much luck looking for one. He really wanted to start a family, but he could not find the right person to marry. A long five years of looking for a wife seemed to payoff when he found a beautiful women named Martha Skelton. Jefferson felt really thankful for her because they bonded together and had a lot in common. They were in love so they decided to get married on new years in 1772. After being married for eight months Martha gave birth to their first daughter in September 1772. Right after their daughter was born his father in law passed away, he had to be strong for his wife because she was heart broken.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a powerful leader who established the foundations of modern Europe through an administration riddled with controversy. Napoleon came to power in 1799 by overthrowing The Directory in France and appointing himself as the emperor, thus having complete control over the country. Napoleon's most lasting achievements include instituting the Napoleonic code, taking control of nearly all of Europe, and engaging in numerous battles with European nations. After years of serving in Europe, Napoleon had many foreign interactions and made himself a reputation split between a hero and a tyrant. To be a tyrant means to be a cruel and oppressive leader, something Europe was familiar with from the absolutist monarchs in their history\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a young boy when his Corsican parents sent him off to a military school. He was short in stature, not very good looking, and overall was an awkward person. So how did such a man like Napoleon gain power? The answer is through the Military and later, through the people. Following Military school, Napoleon moved on to fight in France’s Military. His claim to fame started upon the defense of one of France’s southern ports. During the chaos of the French Revolution, people saw his actions as heroic. He rose to Commander and General of the Interior and defended France’s government, the Directory. Napoleon had a profound hatred for the chaos that ensued with Robespierre’s Reign of Terror. Napoleon mowed down anyone who dare attack the Directory. However, the corrupt Directory was overthrown by Napoleon and his Coup D’etat, or seize of power. He won with 99.8 percent of the people’s votes. Napoleon was dubbed “first consul for life” among 3 other men. This was declared the end of the French Revolution. The population that had lived in fear for years have rejoiced in the coming of a new leader who seemed to be perfect. However, the Napoleonic Code of 1804 gave a new framework of laws that gave people second thoughts. Many freedoms were restricted and total order was established. Napoleon crowned himself as Emperor in 1804. By fighting the chaos and total anarchy of France to gain popularity, Napoleon became favored by the people and rose to power. Throughout his rule, he became just as corrupt as the government that he had helped overthrow years\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was an undeniably strong leader of France, however he was not truthful to his inferiors who gave him his power. Napoleon believed he was the master of France and that he had complete power of the country. He looked down upon his peers and the other citizens of France. Bonaparte gained his popularity by standing with the common people during the revolutionary period of France but did not continue with the views he expressed during this period when he became Emperor. Napoleon Bonaparte had many views and beliefs that made him an absolute dictator of France including, making every decision himself, being above everyone in the class systems, and manipulating the citizens of France.\n\nMany years later, in a galaxy far far away, on the date of August 15, 1769 another war hero and emperor was born, Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon reigned over the French from May 18, 1804 to April 11, 1814 and ruled Italy over the years from March 17, 1805 to April 11, 1814. Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, set up Napoleonic Code; it was a major influence in civil law jurisdictions. Napoleon is best recognized for his role in the wars against France, known as the Napoleonic Wars. His success in these multiple battles led Napoleon to be known as one of the best military leaders of all time. His strategies and campaigns are studied at military schools around the world.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte was a French military leader and eventual political leader in France who was able to seize power during the end of the French Revolution of the late 1790's and early 1800's. Napoleon was the leader of France from 1804 to 1815 and mostly remembered as a leader in a cycle of European battles. He institutionalized the changes brought about by the French Revolution and sought to spread them throughout Europe. It has been long debated the factors that allowed Napoleon to seize power and eventually crown himself emperor. Such factors that have been considered have been Napoleon's personality, his military exploits, the failings of the Directory, support of the people and army and even sheer luck.\n\nThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte was written by Karl Marx a few months after the December 1851 coup d’etat of Louis Bonaparte in France. In this short text, Marx further examined the revolution of 1848 and the series of political reversals which eventually led to the coup. Marx views the coup as a consequence of sharp intensifications of class antagonisms in modern bourgeois society, which is the central idea of the theory of revolutionary change presented in the Communist Manifesto. Therefore, his analysis in the Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte allows us to understand how his theory bears out in practice. However, in the latter text, Marx also made some adjustments to his theory. He went from a simple, bifurcate model consisting of only a dominating class and a dominated class to a more sophisticated understanding where he identifies the subgroups within the main groups, as well as the roles each of these factions played during the course of the revolution. In this paper, I will explain the revolution theory proposed by Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto, and how the theory was applied and adjusted in the Eighteenth Brumaire to make concrete historical sense of the events happened during the years between 1848 to 1851.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, also known as the Little Corporal, was born on August 15, 1769, on the small island of Corsica in France. He was the fourth of eleven children of Carlo Bonaparte and Letizia Romolino. Though oftentimes families with this many children struggled in France’s floundering economy, Napoleon’s father was of the noble status, so his children were able to receive a fair education during their childhood. Napoleon Bonaparte was then able to attend a military academy in France where he trained and accomplished the status of commander. Napoleon, a defender of the revolution, ended up using this military power to stage a coup d'etat against the French government, and he declared"
