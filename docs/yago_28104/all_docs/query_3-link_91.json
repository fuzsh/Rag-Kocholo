        "text": "52' (ENG, GER, FRE), 45' (GER)\n\nJosephine de Beauharnais was Napoleon's Empress, his muse and his great love. It is next to impossible to imagine him without her or her without him.\n\nShe survived the death sentence of insurgency and a bomb attack. Her weapons were her razor-sharp mind, her good taste and her body. Josephine de Beauharnais held the love of one of the Europe’ greatest Generals. Napoleon was the great destroyer of the old system of rule, the nefarious warrior whose campaigns resulted in the death of millions and devastations in various regions around Europe. As Emperor and legislator, he spearheaded an administrative reform that initiated a new order and she was his strongest ally.\n\nBuried within French archives and embedded within private collections is priceless information that can cast a new perspective on the life of the historical figure, Josephine. Hundreds of letters, long thought to be lost, have allowed us to reveal the true life of the clandestine Empress. Through a narrative account of her biography, the film presents a comprehensive yet historically contextualized understanding of the escapades of the illusive Josephine de Beauharnais."
