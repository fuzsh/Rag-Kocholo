        "text": "Ridley Scott’s new Napoleon biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most eagerly anticipated films of the year. As one of history's most well-known individuals, cinema-goers are wondering how Scott will tackle its titular protagonist. However, Empress Joséphine, the wife of the French conqueror is an almost equally important figure in the film's storyline. Portrayed by The Crown star Vanessa Kirby, the film is as much about her life as it is about France’s most famous individual.\n\nThough not quite as prolific as her acclaimed husband, Joséphine has been portrayed in a number of different film and television productions. Stanley Kubrick famously planned a biopic of Napoleon in the 1970s that he invested years of research into. Set to star Audrey Hepburn as Joséphine, with Jack Nicholson as the famed emperor, it is often called ‘the greatest film never made’. In 1954, Marlon Brando played the role of the French military leader in the film Désirée – but the film focuses mainly on Bonaparte's relationship with Désirée Clary, who was once engaged to the French emperor, and the role of Joséphine was played by British actress Merle Oberon. So who exactly was the real Joséphine?\n\nRead More\n\nTiara of the month: the 200-year-old Danish headpiece crafted for Napoleon’s coronation\n\nAs Ridley Scott’s new epic Napoleon is set to hit cinemas later this month, Tatler pays tribute to the Ruby Wreath tiara – one of Crown Princess Mary of Denmark’s favourite diadems\n\nBorn Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie in 1763, her parents were of French nobility. She spent much of her early years on the Caribbean island of Martinique where her parents owned the plantation of Trois-Ilets. However island hurricanes would leave the plantation in ruins and the family in financial desperation. At the age of 16, she eventually left to live in mainland France.\n\nJoséphine had been married once before she met Napoleon. At the age of 16, in 1779, she married Alexandre de Beauharnais, the Viscount of Beauharnais. The couple had two children together, a son named Eugène, born in 1781, and two years later, a daughter Hortense, who would go on to marry Napoleon’s brother. The marriage was anything but happy. Beauharnais lived with a mistress, and Joséphine would eventually separate from him though they remained married until his death. After over a decade of marriage, Beauharnais was executed during the Reign of Terror which saw many wealthy individuals in France arrested or imprisoned. Joséphine was also imprisoned during this time but was eventually released.\n\nRead More\n\nInside Napoleon I’s fascinating dynasty, 200 years on, as Alix, Princess Napoléon marks her 98th birthday\n\nJean-Christophe Napoleon Bonaparte, the great-great-great nephew of the famous Emperor, is forging quite the business empire of his own\n\nJoséphine first met Napoleon in 1795 at a society ball, hosted by Paul Barras, the Vicomte de Barras, her then lover. At the time, though he was serving as a major-general in the military, he was not quite the Alexander the Great-esque conqueror he would soon become. She was put off by his somewhat socially awkward demeanour but the two would eventually fall in love. Seven years his senior, they married the following year in 1796. While Napoleon was undeniably smitten with her, she was more reserved in her own affection towards him.\n\nIn 1804, once Napoleon was crowned Emperor of France, Joséphine would be known as the Empress of France. She also became Queen of Italy, since Napoleon had taken control of the country's government in 1805. It was a marriage of hardship, where the Emperor would often be away for months on end due to his military conquests. Both with involved in numerous affairs, with Joséphine engaging in a relationship with French army officer Hippolyte Charles. Napoleon would have his own excursion with Pauline Fourès, the wife of a cavalry officer. They also never had children together, a source of great discomfort for the Emperor.\n\nJoséphine was also known for her extravagant taste for the finer things in life. Whether it was shoes, clothes or jewels, the Empress would go on mammoth shopping sprees that left her husband's pockets significantly lighter. According to a 1963 biography by Ernest John Knapton, she gathered an enormous collection of 520 pairs of shoes, 673 dresses of velvet or satin, 980 pairs of gloves and 252 hats. She also made renovations to the couple's Château de Malmaison, where exotic animals like kangaroos, monkeys and zebras roamed.\n\nAfter years of affairs, disagreements and Napoleon’s disdain for Joséphine's inability to produce an heir, the two annulled their marriage in 1810. The former Empress would live out the rest of her days in the Château de Malmaison. Napoleon would marry Austrian noblewoman Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma that same year. The couple would have two children together, but they would eventually separate in 1814. Despite this, Joséphine and Napoleon remained on good terms during the last few years, with the Empress even being allowed to take her title.\n\nIn 1814, the Empress died of pneumonia at the château. Napoleon was reportedly heartbroken at the news. At the time, he was exiled on the island of Elba and was said to have locked himself in his room for two days. The following year, the Napoleonic Wars would end and Napoleon would eventually die in exile on the island of Saint Helena in 1821. Despite their annulment over a decade before, the French General’s dying words were said to be ‘France, the army; head of the army, Joséphine’."
