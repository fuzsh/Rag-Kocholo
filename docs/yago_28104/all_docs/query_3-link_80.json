        "text": "Eugène de Beauharnais (born September 3, 1781, Paris, France—died February 21, 1824, Munich, Bavaria [now in Germany]) was a soldier, prince of the French First Empire, and viceroy of Italy for Napoleon I, who was his stepfather (from 1796) and adoptive father (from 1806).\n\nHis father, the general Alexandre, Viscount de Beauharnais, was guillotined on June 23, 1794. The marriage of the general’s widow, Joséphine Tascher de La Pagerie, to Napoleon Bonaparte on March 9, 1796, was at first resented by Eugène and his sister Hortense, but their stepfather proved kind and genuinely interested in their welfare. Eugène in turn was a useful military aide to Napoleon, particularly in the coup d’état of 18 Brumaire (November 9, 1799) and the victory over the Austrians at Marengo (June 14, 1800). In 1804 Eugène received the title of prince and was appointed archchancellor of state.\n\nIn 1805, when Napoleon proclaimed himself king of Italy, Eugène became his viceroy there. He reorganized public finances and the civil service, built roads, and introduced the French legal system."
