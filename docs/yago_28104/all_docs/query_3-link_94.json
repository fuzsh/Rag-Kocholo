        "text": "A great little man\n\nNapoleon I was a great general and statesman. It was, too, a passionate man who wrote beatiful love letters to the woman he loved so passionately, Josephine, his first wife. It seems that Napoleon I was the most important man of the French Revolution. That says an american historian, specialized in the 18th century: \"In one great explosion everything changed. A man made the difference: Napoleon. Without him the chaotic revolution would have imploded from its contradictions.\" His first wife did not love him at the beginning of their marriage, but she did later, when he stopped being so crazy about her, even he loved her till the end. They were a very well combined couple in the social theme, since she had all the emotional intelligence he lacked, she was the public relations specialist in the couple.\n\nHis second wife never loved him. She was already in love with someone else when the state marriage was arranged. They had a son, whom she never cared about too much, and as soon as she could she married the man she really loved.\n\nYou are right, Jason Maier, the first one was his real marriage, even they did not have children. She already had two children by her first marriage, whom Napoleon loved and cared about dearly. The first marriage was arranged, too, by Barras, who wanted to get rid of his mistress Josephine de Beauharnais and to have under control the new military genius. But Napoleon fell in love deeply and inmediately, like striken by a ray. She was empress for five years, before the divorce caused by dynastic succession problems, but the marriage lasted 15 or 16 years, and he continued protecting her after the divorce. She lived like a queen and spent money lile a movie star of nowadays.\n\nStanley Weintraub says, reviewing the book by Olivier Bernier, that we seem always to exist in a dynamic of unintended consequences, because even after the Corsican was stopped \"there was no stopping the revolution\", the genie could not be put back in the bottle. The world of the 19th century was a new order, and no one, in 1800, could have predicted any of this. And that is happening again in the aeternal return that Nietzche wrote about, this time in the United States.\n\nJosephine in the beginning didn't care that much of Napoleon, indeed arranged by Barras and the marriage provided her with (financial) security. Napoleon was in love, though Josephine cheated on him while he was on his militairy campaigns in Italy. Slowly the tables turned, Josephine was the one desperate for Napoleons attention (I am not sure how much that was for her actual affection of Napoleon and how much of it was to secure her position) while Napoleon started looking elsewhere. He was rather pleased with empress Marie-Louise for example, but he had other mistresses before.\n\nRose Tascher\n\nThe name of the Empress Josephine when she was born was Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, then de Beauharnais by her first marriage. Josephine was the name Napoleon chose for her, the one that he thought fitted her. She was a very beautiful and charming lady, smart enough for learning throughout her life, all kind of things that could be practical and useful, but did not have the heart of a real queen. She was not worried about the people or humankind, as a real queen should be. She was born in the french caribbean, in the Martinique isle, where her family had slaves. Slavery had been already abolished by the Convention when Napoleon repositioned it for the french colonies. Napoleon III, Rose TascherÂ´s grandson, gave an statue of her grandmother to the isle, which is regularly beheaded.\n\nYou are right, Marengo.\n\nIt seems that Empress Josephine had very bad teeth and her smile, hiding them, became famous. She was 6 or 7 years older than the Emperor. As soon as they got married, he left to fight the Italy campaign and she stayed in Paris, where very soon she took as a lover a young and good-looking man, Hyppolite Charles, an officer. I have not found images of him. The Emperor begged her to join him in some famous very passionate letters that she never answered. Her mind and time were busy. When the politicians finally sent her to join the general, she took Hyppolite Charles with her in the trip.\n\nBoth Napoleon and her son thought she was a sweet lady. I think she was a person with the gift of a natural high grade of emotional intelligence that she used successfully to strive in life.\n\nAre you sure about that? I read that it was Napoleon who started using Josephine instead of Rose, as he found Rose too common (just as he changed the name of Desiree Clary I believe).\n\nI recall having read that in more than one biographies that she changed her name herself after she had survived the revolution - as a celebration of life. But maybe Napoleon already was part of her life and influenced her? I must confess I never checked it, but it seemed to fit in with her character.\n\nThe famous letters\n\nHere are some paragraphs of the famous letters Napoleon sent to his newly wed bride from the Italy campaign:\n\n\"I have felt sad ever since leaving you,\" he wrote her on July 17, 1796. \"All my happiness is in being near you. I keep remembering, over and over, your kisses, your tears, your charming jealousy; and the beauties of the incomparable JosÃ©phine constantly light a bright and burning flame in my heart and in my desire.... A few days ago, I thought that I loved you: but, since seeing you, I have felt that I love you a thousand times more still!.... Ah! I beg you, let me see a few of your faults; be less beautiful, less graceful, less kind above all.\" \"I have not had a letter from you for two days.... Why, you wicked, ugly, tyrannical, pretty little monster! You laugh at my menaces, at my silliness. Ah! if only I could lock you up in my heart ... I would keep you imprisoned there.\"\n\nYour letters are as cold as if you were fifty,\" he told her on October 17, \"they look like a fifteen year old marriage. One sees there friendship and the other feelings of that winter of life. What, JosÃ©phine! That is very cruel, very wicked, very treacherous of you! What more can you do to make me thoroughly miserable? Stop loving me? But you've already done that. Start hating me? Well, I wish you would, everything is humiliating except hatred; but Indifference, with its steady pulse, its unwavering eye, its monotonous pace! ... A thousand, thousand kisses as loving as my heart.\"\n\nI don't love you at all any more; on the contrary, I hate you. You are wicked, clumsy, stupid and plain. You never write me, you don't love your husband.\"\n\nAre you sure about that? I read that it was Napoleon who started using Josephine instead of Rose, as he found Rose too common (just as he changed the name of Desiree Clary I believe).\n\nMarie JosÃ©phe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie was Josephine's correct name and she was know as Rose de Beauharnaise when she was married to general Alexandre de Beauharnaise.\n\nNapoleon gave her the name Josephine and motivation was: Rose had been the mistress of many influential men but nobody but him had slept with Josephine. Source: Herman Lindqvist Napoleon.\n\nDesiree Clay's full name was Eugenie Bernadine Desiree and she was called Eugenie in the family. She herself did not like that name and when Napoleon broke up with her, she decided to change her name to Desiree to make a clean break with the past.\n\nJosephine was kind of the epitome of the sophisticated older woman, and Marie Louise was the epitome of the young inexperienced virgin ( at the time of her marriage). Napoleon undoubtedly cared more for Josephine and had he not had to have a heir, would have stayed married to her. They only divorced for dynastic reasons, although certainly each cheated on the other, but they loved one another. Marie Louise was a typical Hapsburg and they were accustomed to marriages for dynastic reasons, but still it must have been hard to marry the man who had taken over the throne of her relatives ( she was MA's niece), although Napoleon hadn't started the revolution.\n\nNepoleon was a great leader\n\nNapoleon I was a great general and statesman. It was, too, a passionate man who wrote beatiful love letters to the woman he loved so passionately, Josephine, his first wife. It seems that Napoleon I was the most important man of the French Revolution. That says an american historian, specialized in the 18th century: \"In one great explosion everything changed. A man made the difference: Napoleon. Without him the chaotic revolution would have imploded from its contradictions.\" His first wife did not love him at the beginning of their marriage, but she did later, when he stopped being so crazy about her, even he loved her till the end. They were a very well combined couple in the social theme, since she had all the emotional intelligence he lacked, she was the public relations specialist in the couple.\n\nHis second wife never loved him. She was already in love with someone else when the state marriage was arranged. They had a son, whom she never cared about too much, and as soon as she could she married the man she really loved.\n\nThe memories of Nepoleon are still seen in the Americas to this day with the government of Louisanna and Quebec still having many of his ideas in place to this day. Although his one mistake of conquering lands and selling them to support the gouernment was not to smart. However leaving a mark on history and being a great leader does not mean that every decision has to be exactly perfect.\n\nI have read about how Napoleon was banished to an isolated island for his crimes. I am not sure if he really had any to speak of though. I have often wondered if it was really the catholic church tring to get back at him for his push against the hard line of the catholic church. Then again am I wrong in this interpretation?\n\nNapoleon was sent into exile twice:- first to Elba 1814-1815, he came back, was defeated at Waterloo, and sent to St Helena 1815-1821 where he died there. Twice, it was a coalition of various governments whose armies had defeated him in battle, that led to his banishment, nothing to do with the church.\n\nJosephine's more distant ancestor, Pierre de Tascher, was in France by 1550 or so, and his son Vincent, went by the name de Tascher de la Pagerie. The family had relatives or friends near Dunkirk, so I suspect the name was of Teutonic origin. But the future Empress's line bore mostly French names (Racine, Loges, Buisson, Pheline, Chaudrier, Ronsard de Glatigny with a trace of Italo-Spanish too - the rather famous Taillevis family, which was almost certainly originally French, but had branches in Italy and Spain).\n\nOne of Josephine's great grandmothers was also a du Plessis...\n\nHer mother's mother was an interesting mix of British/Bordeaux (her name was Catherine Brown). Her mother's father came from an established French family.\n\nI would love to know what role they had in the history of St. Martinique and why they went there.\n\nFrance plans Napoleonland\n\nFrance plans Napoleonland - Telegraph\n\nA French theme park is being planned in honour of Napoleon Bonaparte, almost 200 years after his death.\n\nâNapoleonlandâ, the brainchild of former French minister and history buff Yves JÃ©go, is being touted as a rival to Disneyland â assuming, that is, it can gather the Â£180 million needed to leave the drawing board.\n\nThe plan is to build the unlikely amusement park on the site of the brilliant but doomed French leaderâs final victory against the Austrians in the Battle of Montereau in 1814 just south of Paris.\n\n[...]\n\nMr JÃ©go hopes that construction work can start in 2014 and the park open its doors in 2017. He is due to provide more details on the attraction won February 18 - the 198th anniversary of the Battle of Montereau.\n\nFrench plan 'Napoleonland' theme park which will stage daily reenactments of Battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar | Mail Online\n\nFrance Plans 'Napoleonland' Amusement Park To Boost Tourism - Business Insider"
