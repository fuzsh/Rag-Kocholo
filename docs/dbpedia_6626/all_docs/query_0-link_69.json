        "text": "A somewhat more pleasant Indiana Jones game this time.\n\nTo Beat: Reach the ending\n\nTo Complete: Finish all levels and get the best ending\n\nWhat I Did: Completed the game\n\nPlayed: 2/29/20 – 3/7/20\n\nDifficulty: 5/10\n\nMy Difficulty: 5/10\n\nMy Video: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Taito) Longplay\n\nI have seen all of the Indiana Jones movies, even the fourth one that everyone seems to want to forget ever happened. I watched them all just once, all in a row, probably 10 years ago or more by now. It was so long ago that I forgot pretty much everything from any of the movies, but not so long ago that I remembered that I enjoyed this one the most. That seems to fall in line with the consensus of the series. This movie had to have been well loved because the NES ended up with two video game adaptations of the movie, both bearing the name of the film. These aren’t just label variants, but two completely different games. They are distinguished by the publisher, so this game is considered the Taito version and the other is the Ubisoft version. While the comparison between those two may be more interesting, I can safely say I enjoyed this one more than Temple of Doom, at least.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the third movie in the Indiana Jones saga, releasing in May 1989. It was a huge success, grossing nearly $500 million. The film was directed by Steven Spielberg and was co-written by George Lucas. There were three games based on the film. One was a graphical adventure game by LucasArts for home computers. Another was a more action based game that launched the same year for home computers. This was the version that was eventually ported to the NES as the Ubisoft version. The third game, the one I played for this review, was an NES-exclusive game that released in March 1991. It was developed by Software Creations and published by Taito Corporation.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the Taito version, is a side-scrolling platformer that loosely follows the plot of the film. You play the role of Indiana Jones in his quest to find the holy grail. The game is played out via multiple scenes, leading up to the final scene in the lost temple where Indy chooses the holy grail. There are cutscenes in between the levels to advance the story and set up future events. What makes this game interesting is that you can choose which stages you want to play. Furthermore, the more stages you complete, the more difficult later stages will become. You can opt to play the minimum amount and skip straight ahead to the final stage. A regular ending done that way will do for this game, but I achieved the best ending for beating all the stages.\n\nConsidering that there are different stages made available at different times, I’ll cover the stages in the same order I chose for my playthrough, beginning with the search for the Cross of Coronado. This stage takes place on a ship with a bunch of enemy sailors that you’ll need to fight off. The captain of the ship carries the cross and you need to make your way over to the left side of the ship to reach him, fighting off the other baddies along the way. At the top of the screen you’ll see your health bar, number of lives remaining represented as grail icons, and a number of sailors left to defeat before the captain shows up. Even though the captain may be outside ready for a fight, you might have to beat up extra sailors to reach him. This mission goes away for good if you complete two other missions ahead of it, so I like to do this one first. At the start you have to fight 15 sailors, but if you choose this mission second then you have to fight through 30 sailors. The game is over if you lose this mission.\n\nThe controls for Indy on this ship are shared with some other missions. They are also the most complex out of all the missions. You move Indy around with the D-pad. You can double tap either Left or Right to run in that direction, holding down the directional button on the second press to continue running. When standing or walking, the A button does a kick attack while the B button punches. Run and press A to perform a flying kick. Indy can get his whip out or put it away with Select, which replaces his punch attack. Indy can duck by holding Down, and you can do low punches, whips, or kicks. You can climb Up and Down ladders, and even kick enemies from ladders, but this leaves you vulnerable to being knocked off the ship entirely. Indy has two more attacks. He can throw a haymaker by holding Up and pressing B and do a jump kick by holding Up and pressing A. The fighting in this game does not feel very good. It seems random how you fare when fighting enemies. Sometimes you land a good hit and knock the bad guys out right away, other times you land a bunch of hits that don’t seem to do anything. I had the most success with the flying kick, which the manual itself mentions is best.\n\nThe next thing that happens in the story is Indy gets a telegraph stating that both his father is being held captive and his family friend Marcus is missing, so now you have three options for your next stage. I picked going to Castle Brunwald to save Indy’s father. Indy is controlled in this area the same as on the ship, identical moves and all. Only this time, you are in a giant maze. This is a really cumbersome area to figure out. There are doorways all over this place, some leading into other layers of the castle and some leading to staircases to bring you up and down. The castle is three floors high and five layers deep, but you only see one layer and two floors at one time. There are notches on the floors in groups of one through five that indicate which layer you are on, and every floor has its own shield displayed on the wall. But essentially you are navigating in 3D space, and so this area is pretty difficult to clear. Making matters worse is that in later difficulty levels some doors are locked. In that case, there are some hidden passageways revealed by whipping torches on the wall. The route through the castle is very different per difficulty level. I had a tough time getting the hang of it on later levels, so I opted to do this one earlier.\n\nFrom here you have found about where the grail is located, so now you can skip ahead to the final area if you want, but you will have a hard time without knowing what the grail looks like. So next I went to Venice to the catacombs where a scrambled photo of the grail is found. However, fire is raging through so you must put the pieces together and get out in time. This stage is a sliding puzzle level. There is a 5×5 set of tiles and you move a hand cursor with the D-pad. Press A or B to slide either a single piece or part of a row or column toward the empty square across from the hand. While you are constructing the grail photo, a scene below shows the fire catching up to you. You need to complete the puzzle as best as you can, then escape by pressing Select. In the following cutscene you will see either a full or partial picture of the grail depending on how much of it you pieced together. You need this information to pick the proper grail at the end of the game. You still survive if you don’t leave in time, but you lose the picture and will have to remember what the grail will look like when you make it to the end. In later difficulties, the puzzle time is shorter and the puzzle gets more scrambled.\n\nThe final stage before the end is in the Desert of Iskenderun. This time you are on top of a tank fighting off enemy soldiers one at a time to save Marcus. The tank is heading for the edge of a cliff as displayed at the bottom of the screen, so that’s your time limit to complete the stage. The controls and combat are the same as in the other side-scrolling segments. This time, if you get knocked off the tank, you lose a life, your health bar isn’t restored, and you lose time while waiting for Indy to climb back up. In this stage the flying kick is essential to both survival and clearing the stage in time. There are more enemies to fight in the higher difficulties.\n\nAt the very beginning of the game you are entrusted with Indy’s father’s grail diary. As a result, the enemies are out to get it at all costs. Aside from the Coronado, if you lose in a level the diary is taken by the bad guys. You can keep playing stages but if you lose one, it is Game Over. An alternative is to go to Berlin to take the diary back and make your escape. The Road to Berlin is a top-down motorcycle driving level. You’ll have to avoid all kinds of stuff like mines, gun turrets, ravines, and enemy motorcycles as you make your way up the road. You use the D-pad to move Left and Right as well as speed Up or slow Down. You can jump with A or whip to the side with B. Every time you crash, you’ll restart from a checkpoint with a little health loss. The goal is to make your way to the end before running out of health. This is not an easy level, but the good thing is you can keep trying as many times as you want without penalty. For reasons I’ll explain shortly, it is best if you keep the diary for the end of the game.\n\nThe final scene in the game is The Lost Temple. This has a few different parts to it. First off, you’ll see a map showing a path or two through the temple. There is an icon at the top if you have the diary, and you’ll want to make a mental note of that. You move across the floor of the temple one step at a time with the D-pad. Tiles on the ground have the letters in JEHOVAH and you need to walk the path of God by spelling out JEHOVAH step-by-step several times. If you step on the wrong letter, you’ll fall and that’s Game Over. If you happen to go the wrong way you can backtrack. You are also racing the torch you are carrying. When it goes out, you can’t see the letters on the floor and you’ll have to guess. Once you make it to the other side, the next part is to walk across the invisible path as noted by the symbol that was written on the diary. If you didn’t bring the diary with you, you can guess. If you pass that, then your final task is to choose the Holy Grail out of a lineup. Before choosing, you will see your note of what the grail looks like that you put together earlier. If you choose right, you beat the game, otherwise you lose completely. No pressure!\n\nThis was my first time playing this game. I remember testing my cart and playing a little bit of the ship, and I didn’t do so well. While this cart is the cheaper of the two, it is not that easy to find and costs in the $30-$40 range, which is more than I remembered when I was actively collecting. I bought a copy of this game for about $10 in 2014, only for the seller to cancel the order because it sold too low. A few months later I bought a different cart for $12 which is in my collection now.\n\nThis game started out like a normal playthrough, just testing levels out and figuring the best way through. The castle gave me the most trouble as I couldn’t find the exit. After exploring multiple times for a few days, I gave into an FAQ and found that what I was looking for was in a room I had visited a bunch and didn’t recognize the exit. (Perhaps this is a direct reference to the movie that I didn’t notice?) I also had some struggles with the Road to Berlin. I could clear it on the easiest difficulties but not on the higher settings. That became a moot point because I stopped going there when I played well elsewhere. On either the 2nd or 3rd day I beat the game. When you know what to do, the game is pretty short.\n\nMy next step was to beat the game while recording before moving on to the next. In theory this should have been easy, but goodness gracious did it go poorly. I could do the entire game fine up to choosing the grail, and then I failed over and over and over again. It took nine tries before beating the game again. In pretty much all attempts, I had it nailed down to two or three grails and I just kept picking the wrong one. Re-reading the manual finally helped bail me out. There are, at least, five attributes of the grail to examine: The lip, the handle, the cup shape, the stem, and the base. It was the shape of the cup that I wasn’t paying close attention to that messed me up the most, though it was a few tries in before I realized I wasn’t noticing the lip of the cup also. That first time I won I must have really been lucky. I get that the developers were trying to do something interesting for the end of the game, and the randomized nature of it is a good idea. It was just so frustrating and maddening to fail completely at the very end of the game to something that doesn’t at all reflect the ending of the film anyway.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Last Crusade, the Taito version, is a pretty good game that has some issues. Presentation-wise, this is very well made. The gameplay graphics are decent enough, but the cutscenes are digitized images from the movie that look nice in a sepia-tone. The music is pretty good and includes the iconic theme from the film series. The gameplay provides plenty of variety, including side-scrolling platforming, top-down action, and even a sliding block puzzle. The controls and feel of the side-scrolling action is rough and is the most obvious issue with the game. Combat feels clunky and random. I can swing away at enemies, not sure if I’m doing damage, and sometimes I beat them right away and other times I get knocked around a bunch. There’s a lot going on with the controls, making things more cumbersome when things don’t go well. Another thing is the maze design in the castle is brutal at the higher levels. Once you get used to things, this is a short game, and you can get skilled enough that the combat issues don’t really matter. Just make sure that if you play this game that you are more observant with the grail than I was."
