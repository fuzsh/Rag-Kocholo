        "text": "DANGEN Entertainment will publish Cherrymochi-developed occult RPG EXIT VEIL for modern PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo hardware, as well as PC via Steam, the companies announced. Specific consoles and a release date were not announced.\n\nAn early development build of EXIT VEIL will be playable at the DANGEN Entertainment and Cherrymochi booths at Tokyo Game Show 2023, which will run from September 21 to 23 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, Japan.\n\nHere is an overview of the game, via DANGEN Entertainment:\n\nEXIT VEIL is an enthralling new occult RPG. Players will embark on a mesmerizing journey through the dark-psychedelic labyrinth of EXIT VEIL as Tori, a lost soul navigating a beautiful yet terrifying world on the brink of decay.\n\nDrawn into this realm by a cryptic plea from a long-lost family member, Tori finds herself ensnared in a world where the ethereal and the mundane intertwine—a realm dominated by Archetypes, Egregores, Servitors, Daemons, Angels, and The Machine-Elves.\n\nConfronted with a malevolent force of decay lurking deep within the Labyrinthine Realms, players will have the power to guide Tori towards restoring harmony and healing the realms. With the fate of these realms hanging in the balance, players must choose whether Tori will restore harmony or wander lost within the labyrinth forever.\n\nAt the core of EXIT VEIL lies an innovative and immersive gameplay experience centered around the mystical world of Tarot. As they explore, players will immerse themselves in the uniquely crafted EXIT VEIL tarot deck, unlocking insights that extend beyond the confines of the game and into the realm of self-discovery. This fully integrated tarot card system will guide players as they seek to heal the realms, discover their true selves, and unearth the enigma that lies at the heart of it all.\n\nAs players collect tarot cards, they’ll engage in tense, turn-based battles reminiscent of MMO healer classes where they are always moments away from oblivion. The EXIT VEIL tarot deck not only powers the player’s in-game abilities but also serves as a bridge to concealed secrets within the game world. A physical EXIT VEIL TAROT deck will also be available, intertwining with the game and providing a portal to hidden mysteries.\n\nDeveloper Cherrymochi commented they plan to infuse EXIT VEIL with elements they adore in JRPGs: intricate, twisting narratives, characters grappling with their inner truths, and strategic turn-based combat.\n\nWatch a set of trailers below.
