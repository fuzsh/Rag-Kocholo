        "text": "DANGEN Entertainment is thrilled to announce its partnership with Cherrymochi, the creative team behind Tokyo Dark, to deliver an enthralling new occult RPG, EXIT VEIL. Players will embark on a mesmerizing journey through the dark-psychedelic labyrinth of EXIT VEIL as Tori, a lost soul navigating a beautiful yet terrifying world on the brink of decay.\n\nDrawn into this realm by a cryptic plea from a long-lost family member, Tori finds herself ensnared in a world where the ethereal and the mundane intertwine – a realm dominated by Archetypes, Egregores, Servitors, Daemons, Angels, and The Machine-Elves.\n\nConfronted with a malevolent force of decay lurking deep within the Labyrinthine Realms, players will have the power to guide Tori towards restoring harmony and healing the realms. With the fate of these realms hanging in the balance, players must choose whether Tori will restore harmony or wander lost within the labyrinth forever.\n\nAt the core of EXIT VEIL lies an innovative and immersive gameplay experience centered around the mystical world of Tarot. As they explore, players will immerse themselves in the uniquely crafted EXIT VEIL tarot deck, unlocking insights that extend beyond the confines of the game and into the realm of self-discovery. This fully integrated tarot card system will guide players as they seek to heal the realms, discover their true selves, and unearth the enigma that lies at the heart of it all.\n\nAs players collect tarot cards, they'll engage in tense, turn-based battles reminiscent of MMO healer classes where they are always moments away from oblivion. The EXIT VEIL tarot deck not only powers the player's in-game abilities but also serves as a bridge to concealed secrets within the game world. A physical EXIT VEIL TAROT deck will also be available, intertwining with the game and providing a portal to hidden mysteries.\n\nDeveloper Cherrymochi commented they plan to infuse EXIT VEIL with elements they adore in JRPGs: intricate, twisting narratives, characters grappling with their inner truths, and strategic turn-based combat.\n\nAn early development sample of EXIT VEIL will be available for play at both Cherrymochi and DANGEN Entertainment’s booths at Tokyo Game Show 2023, where they will be welcoming feedback about development of the game. EXIT VEIL is slated for release on PC and consoles, with the exact launch date to be unveiled in the future.\n\nEXIT VEIL Steam Store Page:\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2524300/EXIT_VEIL/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/CherryMochii\n\n#EXITVEIL\n\nDANGEN Entertainment is excited to announce its partnership with PINIX Games to bring the critically acclaimed roguelike deck-building tactics game, Alina of the Arena, to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation and Xbox in 2023. This eagerly awaited console release marks a significant milestone for Alina of the Arena, which previously captivated audiences on the PC platform.\n\nAlina of the Arena is a mix of roguelike deck-building and tactics, combining the finest elements from each genre. Players are thrust into the role of Alina, a formidable female gladiator who must engage in relentless combat in front of a bloodthirsty crowd to survive, round by round.\n\nAlina of the Arena’s unique appeal lies in its fusion of roguelike deck-building mechanics with hex-based strategy combat, going beyond the traditional notion of attack and defense. Through deck-building, equipment and power-ups, players are empowered to craft their own unique gladiator-like arsenal for Alina as they navigate through successively difficult battles, presenting fresh challenges with every run. To survive, players will need to employ a wide array of strategies, including various attacks, dodges, knockbacks, and even take advantage of the arena's raucous crowd to endure and emerge victorious.\n\nAlina of the Arena’s s hex-based tactics emphasizes strategic positioning over mere attack and defense. Players can outwit their adversaries by duping them into attacking each other, using the terrain, or even snatching up items thrown into the arena by the crowd to gain the upper hand, creating thrilling tactical showdowns.\n\nOne of the standout features of Alina of the Arena is its dual equipment system, allowing players to wield weapons and gear in both hands. Whether opting for the increased damage of dual-wielded daggers, the balanced performance of a sword and shield combo, or the sheer havoc of a two-handed weapon, the game challenges players to strategize and adapt their build to the battle at hand.\n\n\"We’re extremely excited to join forces with DANGEN Entertainment and introduce Alina of the Arena to a wider audience on consoles,\" said Max Chen of PINIX Games.\n\nPrepare for a battle like no other as Alina of the Arena makes its grand entrance on consoles later this year.\n\nhttps://alinaofthearena.dangenentertainment.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pinixgames\n\n#AlinaoftheArena"
