        "text": "Replicart\n\nPlatform: FDS Year: 1987 Developer: Klon\n\nReplicart (レプリカート Repurikāto) is a game that plays just like the game Snake. You control a dragon that must eat a certain amount of dots to open the exit to the next level. The more dots your dragon eats, the bigger it gets, making it harder to beat a level. Every 10th level there will be a boss you must defeat. Where your dragon can all of a sudden attack by pressing the B button.\n\nThe game was released for the Famicom Disk System and the MSX.\n\nScreenshots\n\nMusic\n\nThe game contains six songs out of the fourteen that were in the MSX version. The title screen music is pretty good, but the stage theme will get annoying since you must play through 99 levels while hearing this song. There are a few different songs for events in the game as well.\n\nRecording\n\n# Title Composer Length Listen Download 01 Title Screen Tsuyoshi Sakata 3:08 Download 02 Cutscene Theme Tsuyoshi Sakata 0:11 Download 03 Stage Theme Tsuyoshi Sakata 1:22 Download 04 Stage 100 Tsuyoshi Sakata 0:48 Download 05 Game Over Tsuyoshi Sakata 0:04 Download 06 Exit Open Tsuyoshi Sakata 0:19 Download\n\nCredits\n\nRipper: Revenant\n\nRecorder: Doommaster1994\n\nGame Credits:\n\nNot Credited Composer: Tsuyoshi Sakata\n\nUnknown Arranger: Unknown\n\n(Source: MSX version, music comparison; Game lacks credits.)\n\nAfter beating the 100th level, you get a one screen ending, followed by a Sony and Klon copyright from 1987, but no matter how long you wait or what buttons you press, nothing happens, and the game will stay on this screen. There are also no credits by waiting at the title screen, or looking in the game's ROM.\n\nThe MSX version of the game contains most of the same music, as well as more music. The MSX version has credits, which can be accessed by beating all 300 levels in the game. In the MSX version, the game gives the music credit to Tsuyoshi Sakata. He and \"Hiroshi\" are credited for sound composition as well. The identity of Hiroshi is currently unknown.\n\nGame Rip\n\nThis rip is missing songs.\n\nRipping NES music is an arduous process that is beyond the scope of this site. The music was recorded in VirtuaNSF.\n\nAudio Devices\n\nThe game uses the RP2A03 for music and sound effects. The DPCM channel is not used. Even though the game runs on the Disk System which contained the RP2C33, the game doesn't use this channel at all.\n\nReleases"
