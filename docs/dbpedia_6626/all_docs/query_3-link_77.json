        "text": "First of all I'd like to thank the Academy Chris for Adventure Creator! It's really awesome!\n\nAnd I want to tell you about the game I'm developing - 'Exit: A Biodelic Adventure'. It's a surreal biopunk point'n'click, set in the world of living technologies, a world in which computers can be fed and cured, where DNA-passwords open gene-locks, and insect hormones revitalize memory. A world with biofactories that give birth to household utensils, where genetically-modified molds can generate virtual realities, and — worst of all — where an epidemic is ravaging the human race, infecting people's neuronet implants and enslaving them to the mysterious Worm.\n\nI've been a big fan of sci-fi since childhood. The books of Ray Bradbury, Robert Sheckley, Strugatsky brothers were my favourite. Then I discovered Stanislav Lem, cyberpunk, and the movies of David Cronenberg, and now I like biopunk very much! It's a science-fiction subgenre about biotechnologies in the future. I've tried to find some biopunk games to play, but I've found very little - there were only the classics, like Dark Seed and Vangers. So several years ago I decided to make my own biopunk game - a classic point'n'click adventure.\n\nIt's been a long journey; through a succesful Greenlight campaign, changing game engine from a homemade one to Unity, (with the Adventure Creator add-on!), and a complete redrawing of all the graphics and characters from scratch (credit to Alexandr Iwaac for backgrounds and models, and Andrey Kovalev for concepts and illustrations, and Anton Kapralov for Steam pictures). But now the game has its own Steam page!"
