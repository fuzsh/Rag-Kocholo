        "text": "Hello again! I’ve been a bit quiet on here lately, but I want to write a bit more regularly again and I have plenty of games to tell you about over the next few weeks. I’ll start now with an ingenious puzzler that is part of the growing sub-genre of escape room board games; Exit: The Game.\n\nMy earliest memories of something similar to an escape room are in the game show that started in the 90’s and has recently had a successful comeback: The Crystal Maze. In this show, contestants have a very short time to solve a puzzle in a room and get a crystal. This room-based puzzle solving was further developed during the rise of internet Flash games, where escape room style games were a very popular. These flash games were typically set in a single room, where you could use your mouse to click around looking for clues and solving visual puzzles or working out lock combinations and trying to escape in the fastest time.\n\nAfter this era, during the noughties, several real life escape rooms following the same concept started springing up, and since then more and more can be found around the world. In these real life escape room games, typically a team of friends are locked in a room with a 1 hour time limit to try to solve a series of puzzles. This is most commonly to obtain combination lock codes in order to open something else that will give you more clues for the next puzzle, etc. These games are getting more elaborate all the time, and the themes and impressively convoluted puzzles found in some are quite amazing.\n\nI absolutely love escape rooms. I have been to a few in different places in the world and enjoyed every one. As I mentioned before in my Hanabi review, I’m a big fan of logic puzzles, and escape rooms can do them really well. Since logic and puzzle solving is already a sizable part of the board gaming world, it seems a natural progression that escape rooms and board games would eventually come together.\n\nThis finally brings me to Exit: The Game, the escape room in a box! This is actually a series of games, each one being a different theme and with varying difficulty levels. Each one has a similar setup to a real life escape room, with a basic backstory of why you are somehow locked in the laboratory/castle/abandoned cabin with solving puzzles as your only means of escape.\n\nDue to the puzzle solving nature of this type of game, once you know the answer it isn’t so much fun to play again. Also a lot of the puzzles require you to write on or cut up the game materials (it feels really bad doing this to a game..), so you wouldn’t be able to play again anyway! Luckily each one of these games is fairly cheap, normally around £15 in the UK, which slightly mitigates the problem of only being able to play each one once.\n\nAlthough the Exit: The Game boxes are small and the games are cheap, it is impressive the amount of game that fits into one box. Depending on your group’s ability level, each one can easily keep you and a group of friends well entertained for at least an hour, most likely more, making them great for a party or special gaming occasion. The games can be played solo, but probably work best at about 3-5 players.\n\nEach version of the Exit has a different theme and different puzzles, but they share a common gameplay flow. They all come with a code wheel, a booklet with initial clues in it, and packs of riddle, clue, and answer cards. The puzzles always lead to a ‘combination lock’ style answer. When you have the answer to a puzzle you input the combination into the code wheel, which in turn gives you a number of an answer card. Depending on which puzzle you are solving, the answer cards will tell you if you are right or wrong. If you are right, you get more riddle cards that help you with other puzzles, and the game continues! There are also a few more elements to the games, but I don’t want to spoil anything!\n\nI have played three versions of Exit now with different people, and I really like them! They do give you an immersive feeling similar to a real escape room, even though you are just sitting round the table. It does help if your group is all engaged and doesn’t give up on difficult puzzles too easily, although as I mentioned there are clue cards that you can use if you get really stuck in order to keep the game flowing. Some of the puzzles in the ones we played were really clever (again, don’t want to spoil too much), and gave a couple of ‘wow’ moments that we weren’t expecting when we started with just a small box.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is a growing sub-genre of board games, so there are a few other escape room board games out there. I have tried ‘Escape Room – the game‘:\n\nThis comes with a few games in one box and a code cracking device to use with all of the games, which is pretty cool. After playing them both, I think Exit is the slightly better game, but they are both good. Another one that seems popular is Unlock!. I have not played this one (yet). It seems to be more card based, and although you would know the answers if you played it again, you don’t destroy the pieces during play, so you could pass it on to someone else after playing.\n\nSo, if you have never tried an escape room and want to see what they are about, or if you like them but don’t want to spend so much money/effort to have a similar experience, I would definitely recommend trying Exit: The Game out at your next gathering of friends and/or family. It’s a great way to escape reality without leaving your house!"
