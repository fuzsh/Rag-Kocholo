        "text": "MOST people, if trapped in a burning building, would call 911. But in Taito's puzzle game Exit, those in peril instead pick up their charred phone books and look under \"escapologists\" for the number of Mr. Escape, a zoot-suited hero-for-hire. Even if you've been snowed in by an avalanche or hit by a flood, Mr. Escape will be glad to help. Just make sure to have your credit card handy.\n\nMr. Escape navigates through crumbling buildings, pushing crates together to form makeshift staircases, clambering up ladders and leaping chasms to save clients.\n\nThe game doesn't explain why the fire department doesn't do this.\n\nExit is made up of a series of logical puzzles, but the developers apparently used up so much brain power designing the puzzles that they were too exhausted to come up with a premise that made any sense at all.\n\nWhat the game lacks in sense it makes up for in style. Wearing a fedora and a red scarf that blows in the wind even when there is no wind, Mr. Escape walks past oddly angled furniture to the sound of a theremin-inspired score. He is an agile hero, able to jump over collapsed sections of floor and to drop from great heights.\n\nThe people Mr. Escape saves are both a help and a hindrance. They are considerably less agile, and it is necessary to create alternate routes for them to cross; fires must be extinguished, planks must be laid over gaps and doors must be unlocked.\n\nAt the same time, they can help move heavy crates or stand on a trigger plate on the floor that gives Mr. Escape access to an elevator.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
