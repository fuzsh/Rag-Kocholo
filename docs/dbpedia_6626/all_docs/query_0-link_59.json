        "meta_description": "First real post on here, so why not start with a bang?\n\n\nTAITO MILESTONES\n\nDeveloper: Taito (original games), Hamster Corporation (collection frontend, emulation)\nPublisher: Taito (JP), ININ (NA/EU) (Digital, Retail Physical), Strictly Limited Games (NA/EU, Limited Physical)\n\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nSo, after a year of poor communication and a vast amount of silent delays, I now finally have my copy of the Taito Milestones Collector's Edition from Strictly Limited Games. I've had my thoughts about the collection for quite some time, and now that I finally have the collection itself in my hands, I feel I can now more accurately describe those thoughts on the collection, even if it was mostly what I was expecting.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou see, it's a collection of previously released Nintendo Switch/PS4 ports of Taito games in the Arcade Archives lineup by Hamster Corporation. The ports featured in these games are barebones, but more than make up for that with a fixed cheap price for every game ($8), generally excellent and PCB-accurate-to-a-tee emulation (sometimes adding in bugfixes and improvements that can be enabled or disabled at will!), and a nice set of extra game modes like a high score mode and a Caravan mode, and even online leaderboards. They've generally been a hit with retro gamers, so much so that physical/digital compilations of them have been made, like this one.\n\nNow, I love the idea of these compilations of Arcade Archives ports, like what they did with Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection for Konami. It was cheap and a great deal compared to getting all of the games individually, consisted of stone hard classics (and some neat obscurities), and provided a nice fill of extras and supplemental material, even if it stripped away some of the usual ACA points like the extra modes and online leaderboards. So Taito decided to do the same thing, but failed to understand why that collection was pretty good for what it was. A big shame, really.\n\nThis is a barebones collection of 10 games. For $40. That same Konami collection, while it had 8 games, was $20. Yikes. While this basically a copy/paste of 10 ACA ports of 10 Taito games, it doesn't really do anything to actually warrant the high price it demands. It does feature the same exact great emulation as on the ACA ports (aside from The Fairyland Story's questionable audio emulation, more on that in a bit), but no High Score/Caravan modes, and certainly no extras to fill up the package (unless you paid up for Strictly Limited's CE in time, more on that also in a bit). Not even any developer interviews, unlockable art or flyers, any cool historical facts about the games or context, anything of that sort! You know, the thing that made Konami's take on this format worth the while?\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nGAME LIST\n\nIt doesn't help that the game library is very... odd, to say the least. While it is called Taito Milestones, only about two, maybe four of the ten included games I feel actually deserve to be called milestones in terms of importance to Taito's history, to be frank. Those being Qix, Elevator Action, and MAYBE Front Line, Chack'n Pop, The Fairyland Story, and The Ninja Warriors. There's quite a bit I do like in here and I suppose could be called a \"milestone\" based on personal opinion, but also quite a lot here that I definitely don't think is of that lofty title.\n\nHere's a short little list of each game included along with a summary and a short review, along with me counting the good and bad eggs as \"yay\" or \"nay\", respectively:\n\n 1. Qix (1981)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/767f416d-1559-44c5-ac39-e67711d330eb/qix_screenshot.png]\n\nOne that doesn't need any introduction, really. In this game, you fight against the titular Qix using only the power of the Stix. You draw lines around the playfield in order to make a closed shape, which you then continuously do so to trap the Qix into the smallest space you can possibly make for it. However, you gotta be quick on this, as multiple foes aside from the Qix itself are after you to try and stop you!\n\nI personally prefer Taito's later take on the gameplay, Volfied and even Super Qix to a degree, but it's still a very fun and a surprisingly original take on a puzzle game to this very day. It's importance can't be denied and it was an obvious inclusion for the collection. Definitely a Yay.\n\n 2. Space Seeker (1981)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/5d36618b-3a4e-4e55-9b18-4035d5ebbd48/1164ee39-f6c6-4b9e-ac61-7c5c8fd177cc.png]\n\nAn interesting combination of genres, Space Seeker was released in 1981 with a fair amount of meat on it's bones. You start out on an map of a planet, trying to find fleets (represented as red dots) and stations (represented as a yellow cannon thing?) in order to attack fleets. When you encounter a fleet, the game then switches to a first person view as you attack the fleets. When going to a station, the game switches to a more typical side scrolling shooter getup as you make your way through it. Rinse and repeat.\n\nDespite some impressive sound design and graphics for the time, as well as neat gameplay ideas, I think this game was too confusing for it's own good as an arcade game. It feels almost inscrutable at first, and it took me several plays and scrutinizing gameplay videos to get an idea of how it's supposed to be played, and even then there's a lot about it I feel I don't understand about it. Combine it with mediocre shooter sections and the first person sections being not very fun to go through, this one is a dud, sadly. I like what it goes for, but in the end I feel it came out way too early for the idea to be utilized excellently. Nay.\n\n 3. Alpine Ski (1982)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/41ae7b9b-9043-459f-ab11-7e588b0e2d2a/Alpine_Ski.png]\n\nIn this game, you control a skier skiing down what appears to be a mountain of sorts, gaining points and extra play time the better you do and the less objects you collide into. Between the downhill skiing and shalom levels, there's also bonus stage that has you trying to make a perfect landing in a ski jump to gain extra points. Not a lot to say about this one.\n\nWhat I can say about this one, though, is that it's surprisingly fun! When you get used to the controls, it's a nice little time killer and the fact that plays are time-based rather than live-based makes it pretty forgiving and encourages you to get a better score with each game. Sure, there's not a lot with it, but it's still a simple but great score chaser when you get the hang of it. Yay.\n\n 4. Front Line (1982)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/b7dc957d-8943-4c98-a64d-1aa88c3bcd9e/658392-front-line-arcade-screenshot-further-into-the-game-attract.png]\n\nIn this game, you control a solider battling it out with other soldiers on the battlefield, in what might be one of the earliest video games to depict human soldiers in war! You have two choices of weapons, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and a limited amount of grenades. You control the direction of your shots/grenades with a rotary dial, an interesting choice of controls for this time, and one that you will need to get used to. Later on in the level, there's even a tank section where you get in a tank (there are two types, a light and a heavy one) and control the guns of it with the dial! After the tank section, the level starts again.\n\nI suppose I could call this a milestone for the fact it depicted human soldiers at war, a rarity for the time, and the fact it sold reasonably well. Unfortunately, as a game, it's less than a milestone. Said control system hurts the game a bit, and even with the ACA/Taito Milestones port mapping the rotary dial side of the controls to the right analog stick, and the shoot button to one of the Z triggers, it barely saves it. Along with the punishing difficulty, it's not a very fun game, and it's only really worth looking at for it's history. Nay.\n\n 5. Wild Western (1982)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/613f58a7-0243-4704-b956-54e6e00f2f2e/3166_2.png]\n\nDepicted in the American frontier days of the United States, you control a sheriff trying to stop a bunch of outlaws from attempting a train robbery. While it all happens from a top-down view, you, while on horseback, can shoot the outlaws via the rotary dial much like the one found on Front Line! You can even do trick shots like ricocheting the bullets off of the train, and it can become a big help along with dismounting your horse and being able to climb onto the train. Aside from bullets from the outlaws, be careful of hazards, though your trusty steed can also jump over them via the jump button.\n\nThis sounds like a game I would love on paper. The wild west theming along with the amount of stuff you can do with your shots sounds like it would make it be a unique take on the shooter games of the time. The sound design is pretty nice too, with music that changes depending on the situation and the annoying but surprisingly realistic train whistle sound (done via some smart analog sound filtering on the real PCB, which is accounted for here thankfully). But the hard to get used to controls and how poorly readable the sprites are (especially the bullets) are ruin it for me, sadly. Thankfully, Taito took the wild west shooter with a rotary dial idea and later made The Tin Star (1984), which is a far better game in my opinion. Nay.\n\n 6. Elevator Action (1983)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/b1e153c0-9a0b-4fa5-aada-1c17a9dc739f/747_2.png]\n\nThis one is another one that doesn't need any introduction. The spy Agent 17, also known as Otto, has to go through an entire hotel, gain evidence behind the red door rooms, and avoid the foes that are trying to protect the said evidence. There's quite a few ways to deal with these foes. Aside from riding in the various elevators in the building, you can also use escalators to try and avoid them, shoot them with your pistol, kick them with a jump kick, and be able to crush them with the elevators! Shooting down the lights also doubles the points of these actions. Once you collect all of the evidence, you go down to the ground floor and make your grand getaway. Then it all starts once more on the next level.\n\nDespite it being pretty simple, it's still quite a fun game that still holds up extremely well to this very day. Even if it's a bit eclipsed by it's younger sibling, Elevator Actions Returns (1994), it's still a very nice insight into the evolution of platformer games. Definitely a Yay.\n\n 7. Chack'n Pop (1984)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/2af3538f-edf1-47b4-bcf6-4452bd6c4803/Chack&#x27;n_Pop_-_Screenshot.png]\n\nOften considered a precursor to the Bubble Bobble game series in how it shares characters, the maze-platformer hybrid Chack'n Pop has the player control the aptly-named Chack'n, a yellow creature, to transverse a set of caves to retrieve the hearts from his girlfriend back. To help him, he has legs that can help get him over tall ledges and help him climb on the ceilings, and also a set of bombs that he can deploy in either the left or right direction. The things keeping him between him and the hearts is the Monstas that grow within the caves, as well as a Maita that slowly inches his way into pushing a rock over the cave's exit, serving as the level's time limit. Sometimes though, your own worst enemy is yourself in this game, as your own bombs can kill you too, so be careful!\n\nIf you've followed me for any amount of time, you know this is a bit of a meme game to me, where the joke is that I think it's one of the worst fucking things ever made. This is half-true. I like a lot of the ideas it has, especially for the time. Where else could you find ceiling-climbing and pacifist bonuses at the time this game came to be? However, platformer game design sensibilities that just weren't there at the time, and especially aren't here in this game, really hold the game back in my opinion. I hate using the C word to describe old games, but it just feels clunky and non-intuitive to play, especially if you're trying to play for score. Even looking at it as a maze game, I can't really get much mileage out of it, sadly. It's probably because I'm too used to games like Pac-Man, Chack'n being able to stick onto the walls confuses me more than it should and really throws me off on what I'm supposed to do. It's one of those games where I think it has a nice set of ideas, but rather poor execution. Would love to see Taito remake this one day. But as it is, it's worth looking at as a Bubble Bobble precursor but hardly anything above that. Nay.\n\n 8. The Fairyland Story (1985)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/ea7637ad-13fd-47d0-bc26-8c61089ef3fd/Fairyland_Story.png]\n\nAnother game that's considered a Bubble Bobble precursor, this time in how it shares familiar gameplay mechanics! You control the witch Ptolemy, in her quest to retrieve the Alfalfa Kingdom's Holy Gem from the evil Dracolisk. As part of her quest, she has to scale 101 levels of foes with only her puny spell that can turn things into cake. It's a lot more powerful than you might think, though, as you can either spam the attack to get rid of them, or you can crush multiple foes using the cake you just made! Using this and not dying, this is how the game's score mechanics works, along with the multitude of items you can get that can also help skyrocket your score. This game is also setup more like a puzzle game than a conventional elimination platformer, so it requires you to get into it with that mindset as well!\n\nOnce again, if you've followed me for any amount of time, you should know how I feel about this game. It's one of my favorite goddamn games from Taito. My profile picture (as of this writing) is bloody Ptolemy, that should tell you enough. I'd go far as to say it's one of the best games in this package aside from Elevator Action and Qix, and one of the reasons to pick this up on sale if you don't already have the ACA port of it. I feel it's a very unfairly maligned game compared to Taito's other platformer games, and one that grows on you if you give it a fair chance with a decent amount of playtime. Sure, it lacks the vast amount of secrets and the co-op play of the Bubble Bobble games, but I feel it more than makes up for that with the surprisingly fun risk-vs-reward scoring system, the great attention to detail for a game from 1985, as well as how absolutely adorable it is.\n\nIf you want some more detail on it, I'll redirect you to my (slightly outdated) writeup of it on Hardcore Gaming 101 [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/fairyland-story-the/]. Definitely a Yay.\n\n 9. Halley's Comet (1986)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/f49021e2-9f0d-49ab-9b0e-f842825baf6e/4d7ff287-d5a3-4f1b-97ee-21fda2e7fbc0.png]\n\nA shmup designed by the legendary Fukio Mitsuji (MTJ) of Bubble Bobble fame, Halley's Comet has a spaceship try and save the earth from comets that are about to destroy it. To do this, the ship defeats various foes along the way that are defending the comet from the ship. The ship also has various powerups and options to help it along it's way.\n\nFor an early shmup, it's one that I actually quite like and keep coming back to! I'm shocked I slept on this one for so long until the Egret II Mini came out. While it doesn't break too much new ground, it works for what it is and it's a very solid shmup that's great for high score plays. Yay.\n\n 10. The Ninja Warriors (1987)\n\nscreenshot [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/aaa63c24-fb00-4f3a-8a8a-4db3b622c81c/678655-the-ninja-warriors-arcade-screenshot-got-a-soldier.png]\n\nThe youngest of the collection, The Ninja Warriors is a belt action game of sorts famous for using the very same triple-monitor setup as the first two Darius games. Two ninja robots designed by Mulk, Kunoichi and Ninja, try and overthrow the tyrannical government that was installed by Banglar. To try and get to him, they have to get through six stages of various foes and use their robotic ninja skills to try and defeat them all.\n\nThis is one I really want to like, especially with the top notch graphics on display, and the legendary ZUNTATA soundtrack attached to it. Once again I hate to have to use the C word, but it's a very clunky beat-em-up even compared to it's contemporaries Renegade and Double Dragon. The fact that the mere action of moving, and even beating baddies, feels slow and really weird really hurts the game and makes it not that fun. It's no wonder I prefer the SNES sequel, and later the remake of that, over this one. Just watch someone play this and skip to the SNES sequel and/or the remake of that. Nay.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nTHOUGHTS ON THE COLLECTION ITSELF\n\nSo, that does it on the included games. Other than the games themselves, there's almost zero extras to speak of on the collection itself. Sure, you still get the same great ACA ports of these games with the same great emulation of them (with The Fairyland Story being a weird exception, the sound emulation is very off [https://twitter.com/TremiRodomi/status/1334555550609068033?s=09] compared to the real PCB [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2AlKBsVWvc], while it sounded more like the actual thing before a day one patch [https://twitter.com/otemoto_stinger/status/1334472610025938945?s=09], and this is based on the patched ACA version), and the great online leaderboards they come with, but you lose the High Score and Caravan modes, which hurts the replayability of these games somewhat. You also get no dev interviews, historical facts or context, not even scans of promo/cab art for the games! Something the Konami collection did do to make up for the lost typical ACA port features.\n\nAnd the fact they're asking 40 bones for a barebones package of 10 games (with only 5 of them being actually any good, to be frank) feels very insulting, even if it's still a better deal than getting the ACA ports separately. Having yet another physical copy of Elevator Action and The Fairyland Story is nice for me, sure, but when not a lot else is worth playing in this package, it does sour me on my purchase a little bit.\n\nI think aside from the price, I think my main issue with this collection is the very fact it's called Taito Milestones, and this extends to the game library issue too. \"Milestone\" is a very bold label for quite a lot of these games, and I completely get why people are mad games like Bubble Bobble and Kiki Kaikai aren't on the collection if they titled it Taito Milestones. People will just think it's a \"best hits\" collection of Taito games rather than what it really is, a Taito ACA port compilation. Semantics like this are key to marketing! And again, the fact we get no context as to why they called these games \"milestones\", really hurts this on that front, as we're left to our own devices as to figure out the seemingly random selection of games here.\n\nI do have a way they could have fixed it though: they could have removed the more popular games here like Elevator Action and The Ninja Warriors, leaned more hard into the obscurities that this collection is already full of (and indeed, there's a lot of obscure Taito games on ACA that they could have used), and titled it something more like Taito Obscurities or Taito's Hidden Gems, then that would have given this collection more of a fighting chance with people like us. Retro gamers do tend to try and expand their horizons, and having a selection of a game company's deep cuts sounds tantalizing to those who are interested in the hobby to a sizeable degree.\n\nWhile I don't think this collection is very good full price, I think it's worth it if and when you find it on sale, and want any of these physically, in which it has already dropped down to $20 on Amazon before. But if you really like any of the games, and/or you don't care for no more than three of the games here, I suggest you buy the individual ACA ports instead, as those have the High Score and Caravan modes, which help the replayability of some of these games like mentioned before.\n\nHigh retail price, mind-boggling game library, and no extras really sour this package and I recommend you Wait For A Sale if you're interested in it at all, and even then I'd rather point you towards the individual ACA ports and choose what you'd like to get instead.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nSTRICTLY HIGHWAY ROBBERY GAMES, OR HOW THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST CES I'VE EVER SEEN\n\nThe beast in question. Took them long enough. [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/3e5c8b41-c336-4205-8f32-5c26bc697a72/PXL_20221220_045520012.jpg]\n\nSo, like mentioned in the beginning, I was suckered into buying the quite pricey collector's edition from Strictly Limited Games solely to see if the inserts were worth preserving. I have had quite a lot of thoughts on them (and ININ, their retail arm, they're really one and the same!) for quite a while, and I almost didn't get this when it was announced because I was burned by them before with their Space Invaders Invincible Collection release. However, the mere mention of instruction card repros, and The Fairyland Story merch for once, made me pull out my wallet as I moaned about having to give money to SLG again. Thankfully, after what I got here, and the mere journey it took to even get this, I can safely say I will never give money again to them, no matter what they dangle in front of me.\n\nSo, the CE includes the following, copy/pasted from SLG's site:\n\n * Game for Nintendo Switch\n * XXL Retro PCB Box\n * Collectorâs Edition Box with Magnetic Latch\n * Colourful Game Manual\n * Original Soundtrack on CDâ¯\n * Coin Collector Booklet including 10 Unique Metal Coins\n * 12 Game and Artwork Posters (DIN A2/ 21cm x 29.7cm/8.26\" x 11.7\")\n * 10x Arcade Game Instruction Sheets (DIN A5/ 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n * 10x Pixel Art Post Cards (DIN A6/ 5cm x 14.8cm/4.1\" x 5.8\")\n * 10x Individual Character Trading Cards (DIN A7/4cm x 10.5cm/2.9\" x 4.1\")\n * 6x Retro Style Arcade Flyers (DIN A5/ 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n * Character Sticker Sheet (DIN A5, 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n * 3 Marquee Stickers (6cm x 4.2cm/7.7\" x 1.65\")\n * TAITO MILESTONES Enamel Logo Pin\n * Character Group Fridge Magnet\n\nYou might be thinking \"But Lee, that sounds like quite the selection of items for a collector's edition! How could SLG have possibly screwed this up?\". My answer to that is they found a way, much like everything they touch.\n\nTo start off, most of the feelies included consist of paper. That isn't exactly a bad thing per se, but the fact most of it feels EXTREMELY cheap for a $105 USD CE really makes me wonder if the money they put into all that could have been used for better extras. I could probably cut the instruction card/flyers repros with my moderately sharp pocket knife and it would slice without any resistance or effort. It's that thin and flimsy. To give a point of comparison, the instruction card repros my Japanese Cotton Reboot! CE comes with are much better quality and about the same quality of the legitimate ones.\n\nThe character cards also feel super cheap and not great, and way more floppy than I expected. So much so I'm looking into getting card sleeves for them. I expected they use cardstock much like the ones on my Yu-Gi-Oh cards, but I was woefully mistaken there. The posters seem to be fine, and I might hang up the Fairyland Story poster somewhere if I can find a frame for it, but I don't know yet. Even the fridge magnet they included feels flimsy as hell! The outer boxes themselves, as well as the coin collection and pin are also fine, the latter of which are the only real non-paper feelies aside from the CD and the mentioned fridge magnet.\n\nNot only that, but a lot of the extras feel like they're only there to artificially inflate the price of the CE. The instruction card/flyer repros and coin collection are kinda neat and make sense for something like this, but I dunno if a CE of an arcade collection really needs... postcards and stickers? Especially with the target audience probably never even touching them out of fear of lowering the value of it. I'd love to use the Ptolemy and Chack'n stickers on something, but I fear it'll ruin the value of it or whatever. Granted, if they don't disintegrate sometime soon with how flimsy those are too...\n\nAnd speaking of the instruction cards, the paper quality on them isn't the only bad thing on them...\n\nLook how they massacred my boy... [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/f7707d70-8975-41a8-b7cc-8a8a4afcde62/PXL_20221219_232331384.jpg]\n\nThey... localized them into English. Gone are the nice text and formatting of the originals, but now a sloppily added font that barely fits with the original formatting, as well as details that are missing from them (the Fairyland Story instruction card is supposed to have a green Taito seal that's all but missing from the new reproduction). Some of them look fine enough, especially like on the back of the flyers, which are mostly text anyhow, but some look downright awful like the above examples. I wouldn't even have minded as much if they just took more care into matching the fonts and whatnot all up with the original formatting, which they didn't here. It looks like I pointed the Google Translate camera app on it.\n\nEven better was Strictly Limited's horseshit response [https://archive.vn/It3cW], which said it was \"all up to personal taste\" and they did this \"given feedback in the past\". I don't know about you, but the main audience for this collection, admittedly retro gamer weebs like me, would not like this one bit, and I haven't heard of anyone that would WILLINGLY want this. If they also did this to deter bootlegs of it being made, there's also fine print that says it's a reproduction, as well as updated copyright information, so it's not like they didn't cover their bases there. If I were them, I would have included the original formatting/language ones on the back, and extra flyers with the original formatting/language for the double sided ones. That way, everyone is happy, and it's not much more paper included with it. The amateur mistakes don't end here, however...\n\nFor whatever reason, for some of the art used around the CE extras, it uses assets from the console versions of the games included rather than the arcade versions as they are in the main collection.\n\n * The Chack'n Pop postcard uses a screenshot from the Famicom port of the game.\n\nI could immediately tell by how the Maita is drawn. He looks all shriveled up in the Famicom port. [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/ad91e0a2-e1f7-4e54-9cd1-eabb2ad3bc4a/PXL_20221220_012737091.jpg]\n\n * The character cards for Agent 17 and Ptolemy use their sprites from the Famicom/NES port of Elevator Action, and the title screen sprite from the MSX port of The Fairyland Story, respectively. Ptolemy's hat is also very slightly cut off on her card.\n\nso retro..... [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/0ab0d4b3-5e40-47f8-8c44-c4c1c670707b/PXL_20221220_013630483.jpg]\n\n * Ditto for their manual pages.\n\nOtto definitely doesn't have orange pants in the arcade version. [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/6d7b32e3-d18c-4271-ac47-665c8a82fbc4/PXL_20221220_052553937.jpg]\n\nAdmittedly, I love this sprite of Ptolemy, but it feels weird when the version included is the arcade version rather than the MSX port, where this originates... [https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/c7b17268-baea-458f-880d-b1ea4780e956/PXL_20221220_052604318.jpg]\n\nI really don't know why they did any of this given how arcade spritesheets for all of the games (and MAME in the case of screenshots) are a click away. It reeks of laziness and inconsistency, and furthermore, sends a message to me that they really don't care for what they are actually selling (which is par for the course for ININ/SLG). It's even weirder when you notice that it uses art from the arcade promo materials for all of the other extras just fine otherwise, and these don't line up with all of that otherwise. They really had no excuse for this given the vast amount of resources the internet and Taito have on the arcade versions, like shown here. Not to mention, I don't exactly know the copyright status the MSX port of The Fairyland Story, even if SLG said Taito approved of everything when they confronted me in Twitter DMs after roasting them publicly...\n\nSpeaking of The Fairyland Story, that brings me to my one of my two issues with the soundtrack CD. The Fairyland Story's music on it sounds very off to me compared to verified PCB footage. Admittedly, this wasn't SLG's fault seemingly. It's the same recent remaster Taito made as found on the large album included with certain orders of the Egret II Mini, and it's the only case of Digital Destruction on an otherwise excellent set of remasters. Otherwise, everything sounds great in it and exactly how it is compared to PCB footage. It's one of the few things I like about this CE. It even includes the nice menu theme of the collection, as well as a cute remix melody of the included games! The CD even has CD-Text on it (Foobar2000 immediately told me the song titles and everything), which is a rarity these days and very appreciated! My only other issue is that I wish it had the entire soundtrack for all the games on it. They had more than enough room to do that for the games with actual soundtracks, especially The Ninja Warriors.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS\n\nI'm glad Taito and Hamster are making an effort to make physical copies of the Taito ACA ports, and I can't pass up having another physical copy of Elevator Action and The Fairyland Story, but this ain't it, chief. Put more effort into the game curation, a better price point, and give me extras that you can't find on the ACA ports, and maybe I'll consider getting more of these if you choose to make more.\n\nAnd this is certainly ain't it for a collector's edition, chief. If I didn't already regret my purchase of an overpriced, mediocre arcade game collection, I regret it even more after getting the even more overpriced and downright awful SLG CE of it. I really regret this purchase and should have heeded the warning of a few of my close friends on not bothering with it at all. Not only that, but the sloppiness of the entire package feels like a big insult to the games represented, and the fans of them as well. These games certainly deserve better even if I'm not a fan of quite a lot of them. SLG certainly knows how to burn their customers after ghosting them for a year or more, and this has given me even more reason to boycott them. I got even more words for them, but they can wait after I get my Cotton CEs from them.",

        "text": "You see, it's a collection of previously released Nintendo Switch/PS4 ports of Taito games in the Arcade Archives lineup by Hamster Corporation. The ports featured in these games are barebones, but more than make up for that with a fixed cheap price for every game ($8), generally excellent and PCB-accurate-to-a-tee emulation (sometimes adding in bugfixes and improvements that can be enabled or disabled at will!), and a nice set of extra game modes like a high score mode and a Caravan mode, and even online leaderboards. They've generally been a hit with retro gamers, so much so that physical/digital compilations of them have been made, like this one.\n\nNow, I love the idea of these compilations of Arcade Archives ports, like what they did with Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection for Konami. It was cheap and a great deal compared to getting all of the games individually, consisted of stone hard classics (and some neat obscurities), and provided a nice fill of extras and supplemental material, even if it stripped away some of the usual ACA points like the extra modes and online leaderboards. So Taito decided to do the same thing, but failed to understand why that collection was pretty good for what it was. A big shame, really.\n\nThis is a barebones collection of 10 games. For $40. That same Konami collection, while it had 8 games, was $20. Yikes. While this basically a copy/paste of 10 ACA ports of 10 Taito games, it doesn't really do anything to actually warrant the high price it demands. It does feature the same exact great emulation as on the ACA ports (aside from The Fairyland Story's questionable audio emulation, more on that in a bit), but no High Score/Caravan modes, and certainly no extras to fill up the package (unless you paid up for Strictly Limited's CE in time, more on that also in a bit). Not even any developer interviews, unlockable art or flyers, any cool historical facts about the games or context, anything of that sort! You know, the thing that made Konami's take on this format worth the while?\n\nGame List\n\nIt doesn't help that the game library is very... odd, to say the least. While it is called Taito Milestones , only about two, maybe four of the ten included games I feel actually deserve to be called milestones in terms of importance to Taito's history, to be frank. Those being Qix , Elevator Action , and MAYBE Front Line , Chack'n Pop , The Fairyland Story , and The Ninja Warriors . There's quite a bit I do like in here and I suppose could be called a \"milestone\" based on personal opinion, but also quite a lot here that I definitely don't think is of that lofty title.\n\nHere's a short little list of each game included along with a summary and a short review, along with me counting the good and bad eggs as \"yay\" or \"nay\", respectively:\n\nQix (1981)\n\nOne that doesn't need any introduction, really. In this game, you fight against the titular Qix using only the power of the Stix. You draw lines around the playfield in order to make a closed shape, which you then continuously do so to trap the Qix into the smallest space you can possibly make for it. However, you gotta be quick on this, as multiple foes aside from the Qix itself are after you to try and stop you!\n\nI personally prefer Taito's later take on the gameplay, Volfied and even Super Qix to a degree, but it's still a very fun and a surprisingly original take on a puzzle game to this very day. It's importance can't be denied and it was an obvious inclusion for the collection. Definitely a Yay.\n\nSpace Seeker (1981)\n\nAn interesting combination of genres, Space Seeker was released in 1981 with a fair amount of meat on it's bones. You start out on an map of a planet, trying to find fleets (represented as red dots) and stations (represented as a yellow cannon thing?) in order to attack fleets. When you encounter a fleet, the game then switches to a first person view as you attack the fleets. When going to a station, the game switches to a more typical side scrolling shooter getup as you make your way through it. Rinse and repeat.\n\nDespite some impressive sound design and graphics for the time, as well as neat gameplay ideas, I think this game was too confusing for it's own good as an arcade game. It feels almost inscrutable at first, and it took me several plays and scrutinizing gameplay videos to get an idea of how it's supposed to be played, and even then there's a lot about it I feel I don't understand about it. Combine it with mediocre shooter sections and the first person sections being not very fun to go through, this one is a dud, sadly. I like what it goes for, but in the end I feel it came out way too early for the idea to be utilized excellently. Nay.\n\nAlpine Ski (1982)\n\nIn this game, you control a skier skiing down what appears to be a mountain of sorts, gaining points and extra play time the better you do and the less objects you collide into. Between the downhill skiing and shalom levels, there's also bonus stage that has you trying to make a perfect landing in a ski jump to gain extra points. Not a lot to say about this one.\n\nWhat I can say about this one, though, is that it's surprisingly fun! When you get used to the controls, it's a nice little time killer and the fact that plays are time-based rather than live-based makes it pretty forgiving and encourages you to get a better score with each game. Sure, there's not a lot with it, but it's still a simple but great score chaser when you get the hang of it. Yay.\n\nFront Line (1982)\n\nIn this game, you control a solider battling it out with other soldiers on the battlefield, in what might be one of the earliest video games to depict human soldiers in war! You have two choices of weapons, a pistol with unlimited ammo, and a limited amount of grenades. You control the direction of your shots/grenades with a rotary dial, an interesting choice of controls for this time, and one that you will need to get used to. Later on in the level, there's even a tank section where you get in a tank (there are two types, a light and a heavy one) and control the guns of it with the dial! After the tank section, the level starts again.\n\nI suppose I could call this a milestone for the fact it depicted human soldiers at war, a rarity for the time, and the fact it sold reasonably well. Unfortunately, as a game, it's less than a milestone. Said control system hurts the game a bit, and even with the ACA/Taito Milestones port mapping the rotary dial side of the controls to the right analog stick, and the shoot button to one of the Z triggers, it barely saves it. Along with the punishing difficulty, it's not a very fun game, and it's only really worth looking at for it's history. Nay.\n\nWild Western (1982)\n\nDepicted in the American frontier days of the United States, you control a sheriff trying to stop a bunch of outlaws from attempting a train robbery. While it all happens from a top-down view, you, while on horseback, can shoot the outlaws via the rotary dial much like the one found on Front Line ! You can even do trick shots like ricocheting the bullets off of the train, and it can become a big help along with dismounting your horse and being able to climb onto the train. Aside from bullets from the outlaws, be careful of hazards, though your trusty steed can also jump over them via the jump button.\n\nThis sounds like a game I would love on paper. The wild west theming along with the amount of stuff you can do with your shots sounds like it would make it be a unique take on the shooter games of the time. The sound design is pretty nice too, with music that changes depending on the situation and the annoying but surprisingly realistic train whistle sound (done via some smart analog sound filtering on the real PCB, which is accounted for here thankfully). But the hard to get used to controls and how poorly readable the sprites are (especially the bullets) are ruin it for me, sadly. Thankfully, Taito took the wild west shooter with a rotary dial idea and later made The Tin Star (1984), which is a far better game in my opinion. Nay.\n\nElevator Action (1983)\n\nThis one is another one that doesn't need any introduction. The spy Agent 17, also known as Otto, has to go through an entire hotel, gain evidence behind the red door rooms, and avoid the foes that are trying to protect the said evidence. There's quite a few ways to deal with these foes. Aside from riding in the various elevators in the building, you can also use escalators to try and avoid them, shoot them with your pistol, kick them with a jump kick, and be able to crush them with the elevators! Shooting down the lights also doubles the points of these actions. Once you collect all of the evidence, you go down to the ground floor and make your grand getaway. Then it all starts once more on the next level.\n\nDespite it being pretty simple, it's still quite a fun game that still holds up extremely well to this very day. Even if it's a bit eclipsed by it's younger sibling, Elevator Actions Returns (1994), it's still a very nice insight into the evolution of platformer games. Definitely a Yay.\n\nChack'n Pop (1984)\n\nOften considered a precursor to the Bubble Bobble game series in how it shares characters, the maze-platformer hybrid Chack'n Pop has the player control the aptly-named Chack'n, a yellow creature, to transverse a set of caves to retrieve the hearts from his girlfriend back. To help him, he has legs that can help get him over tall ledges and help him climb on the ceilings, and also a set of bombs that he can deploy in either the left or right direction. The things keeping him between him and the hearts is the Monstas that grow within the caves, as well as a Maita that slowly inches his way into pushing a rock over the cave's exit, serving as the level's time limit. Sometimes though, your own worst enemy is yourself in this game, as your own bombs can kill you too, so be careful!\n\nIf you've followed me for any amount of time, you know this is a bit of a meme game to me, where the joke is that I think it's one of the worst fucking things ever made. This is half-true. I like a lot of the ideas it has, especially for the time. Where else could you find ceiling-climbing and pacifist bonuses at the time this game came to be? However, platformer game design sensibilities that just weren't there at the time, and especially aren't here in this game, really hold the game back in my opinion. I hate using the C word to describe old games, but it just feels clunky and non-intuitive to play, especially if you're trying to play for score. Even looking at it as a maze game, I can't really get much mileage out of it, sadly. It's probably because I'm too used to games like Pac-Man , Chack'n being able to stick onto the walls confuses me more than it should and really throws me off on what I'm supposed to do. It's one of those games where I think it has a nice set of ideas, but rather poor execution. Would love to see Taito remake this one day. But as it is, it's worth looking at as a Bubble Bobble precursor but hardly anything above that. Nay.\n\nThe Fairyland Story (1985)\n\nAnother game that's considered a Bubble Bobble precursor, this time in how it shares familiar gameplay mechanics! You control the witch Ptolemy, in her quest to retrieve the Alfalfa Kingdom's Holy Gem from the evil Dracolisk. As part of her quest, she has to scale 101 levels of foes with only her puny spell that can turn things into cake. It's a lot more powerful than you might think, though, as you can either spam the attack to get rid of them, or you can crush multiple foes using the cake you just made! Using this and not dying, this is how the game's score mechanics works, along with the multitude of items you can get that can also help skyrocket your score. This game is also setup more like a puzzle game than a conventional elimination platformer, so it requires you to get into it with that mindset as well!\n\nOnce again, if you've followed me for any amount of time, you should know how I feel about this game. It's one of my favorite goddamn games from Taito. My profile picture (as of this writing) is bloody Ptolemy, that should tell you enough. I'd go far as to say it's one of the best games in this package aside from Elevator Action and Qix , and one of the reasons to pick this up on sale if you don't already have the ACA port of it. I feel it's a very unfairly maligned game compared to Taito's other platformer games, and one that grows on you if you give it a fair chance with a decent amount of playtime. Sure, it lacks the vast amount of secrets and the co-op play of the Bubble Bobble games, but I feel it more than makes up for that with the surprisingly fun risk-vs-reward scoring system, the great attention to detail for a game from 1985, as well as how absolutely adorable it is.\n\nIf you want some more detail on it, I'll redirect you to my (slightly outdated) writeup of it on Hardcore Gaming 101. Definitely a Yay.\n\nHalley's Comet (1986)\n\nA shmup designed by the legendary Fukio Mitsuji (MTJ) of Bubble Bobble fame, Halley's Comet has a spaceship try and save the earth from comets that are about to destroy it. To do this, the ship defeats various foes along the way that are defending the comet from the ship. The ship also has various powerups and options to help it along it's way.\n\nFor an early shmup, it's one that I actually quite like and keep coming back to! I'm shocked I slept on this one for so long until the Egret II Mini came out. While it doesn't break too much new ground, it works for what it is and it's a very solid shmup that's great for high score plays. Yay.\n\nThe Ninja Warriors (1987)\n\nThe youngest of the collection, The Ninja Warriors is a belt action game of sorts famous for using the very same triple-monitor setup as the first two Darius games. Two ninja robots designed by Mulk, Kunoichi and Ninja, try and overthrow the tyrannical government that was installed by Banglar. To try and get to him, they have to get through six stages of various foes and use their robotic ninja skills to try and defeat them all.\n\nThis is one I really want to like, especially with the top notch graphics on display, and the legendary ZUNTATA soundtrack attached to it. Once again I hate to have to use the C word, but it's a very clunky beat-em-up even compared to it's contemporaries Renegade and Double Dragon . The fact that the mere action of moving, and even beating baddies, feels slow and really weird really hurts the game and makes it not that fun. It's no wonder I prefer the SNES sequel, and later the remake of that, over this one. Just watch someone play this and skip to the SNES sequel and/or the remake of that. Nay.\n\nThoughts on the collection itself\n\nSo, that does it on the included games. Other than the games themselves, there's almost zero extras to speak of on the collection itself. Sure, you still get the same great ACA ports of these games with the same great emulation of them (with The Fairyland Story being a weird exception, the sound emulation is very off compared to the real PCB, while it sounded more like the actual thing before a day one patch, and this is based on the patched ACA version), and the great online leaderboards they come with, but you lose the High Score and Caravan modes, which hurts the replayability of these games somewhat. You also get no dev interviews, historical facts or context, not even scans of promo/cab art for the games! Something the Konami collection did do to make up for the lost typical ACA port features.\n\nAnd the fact they're asking 40 bones for a barebones package of 10 games (with only 5 of them being actually any good, to be frank) feels very insulting, even if it's still a better deal than getting the ACA ports separately. Having yet another physical copy of Elevator Action and The Fairyland Story is nice for me, sure, but when not a lot else is worth playing in this package, it does sour me on my purchase a little bit.\n\nI think aside from the price, I think my main issue with this collection is the very fact it's called Taito Milestones, and this extends to the game library issue too. \"Milestone\" is a very bold label for quite a lot of these games, and I completely get why people are mad games like Bubble Bobble and Kiki Kaikai aren't on the collection if they titled it Taito Milestones. People will just think it's a \"best hits\" collection of Taito games rather than what it really is, a Taito ACA port compilation. Semantics like this are key to marketing! And again, the fact we get no context as to why they called these games \"milestones\", really hurts this on that front, as we're left to our own devices as to figure out the seemingly random selection of games here.\n\nI do have a way they could have fixed it though: they could have removed the more popular games here like Elevator Action and The Ninja Warriors , leaned more hard into the obscurities that this collection is already full of (and indeed, there's a lot of obscure Taito games on ACA that they could have used), and titled it something more like Taito Obscurities or Taito's Hidden Gems, then that would have given this collection more of a fighting chance with people like us. Retro gamers do tend to try and expand their horizons, and having a selection of a game company's deep cuts sounds tantalizing to those who are interested in the hobby to a sizeable degree.\n\nWhile I don't think this collection is very good full price, I think it's worth it if and when you find it on sale, and want any of these physically, in which it has already dropped down to $20 on Amazon before. But if you really like any of the games, and/or you don't care for no more than three of the games here, I suggest you buy the individual ACA ports instead, as those have the High Score and Caravan modes, which help the replayability of some of these games like mentioned before.\n\nHigh retail price, mind-boggling game library, and no extras really sour this package and I recommend you Wait For A Sale if you're interested in it at all, and even then I'd rather point you towards the individual ACA ports and choose what you'd like to get instead.\n\nStrictly Highway Robbery Games, or how this is one of the worst CEs I've ever seen\n\nSo, like mentioned in the beginning, I was suckered into buying the quite pricey collector's edition from Strictly Limited Games solely to see if the inserts were worth preserving. I have had quite a lot of thoughts on them (and ININ, their retail arm, they're really one and the same!) for quite a while, and I almost didn't get this when it was announced because I was burned by them before with their Space Invaders Invincible Collection release. However, the mere mention of instruction card repros, and The Fairyland Story merch for once, made me pull out my wallet as I moaned about having to give money to SLG again. Thankfully, after what I got here, and the mere journey it took to even get this, I can safely say I will never give money again to them, no matter what they dangle in front of me.\n\nSo, the CE includes the following, copy/pasted from SLG's site:\n\nGame for Nintendo Switch\n\nXXL Retro PCB Box\n\nCollectorâs Edition Box with Magnetic Latch\n\nColourful Game Manual\n\nOriginal Soundtrack on CDâ¯\n\nCoin Collector Booklet including 10 Unique Metal Coins\n\n12 Game and Artwork Posters (DIN A2/ 21cm x 29.7cm/8.26\" x 11.7\")\n\n10x Arcade Game Instruction Sheets (DIN A5/ 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n\n10x Pixel Art Post Cards (DIN A6/ 5cm x 14.8cm/4.1\" x 5.8\")\n\n10x Individual Character Trading Cards (DIN A7/4cm x 10.5cm/2.9\" x 4.1\")\n\n6x Retro Style Arcade Flyers (DIN A5/ 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n\nCharacter Sticker Sheet (DIN A5, 14.8cm x 21cm/5.8\" x 8.26\")\n\n3 Marquee Stickers (6cm x 4.2cm/7.7\" x 1.65\")\n\nTAITO MILESTONES Enamel Logo Pin\n\nCharacter Group Fridge Magnet\n\nYou might be thinking \"But Lee, that sounds like quite the selection of items for a collector's edition! How could SLG have possibly screwed this up?\". My answer to that is they found a way, much like everything they touch.\n\nTo start off, most of the feelies included consist of paper. That isn't exactly a bad thing per se , but the fact most of it feels EXTREMELY cheap for a $105 USD CE really makes me wonder if the money they put into all that could have been used for better extras. I could probably cut the instruction card/flyers repros with my moderately sharp pocket knife and it would slice without any resistance or effort. It's that thin and flimsy. To give a point of comparison, the instruction card repros my Japanese Cotton Reboot! CE comes with are much better quality and about the same quality of the legitimate ones.\n\nThe character cards also feel super cheap and not great, and way more floppy than I expected. So much so I'm looking into getting card sleeves for them. I expected they use cardstock much like the ones on my Yu-Gi-Oh cards, but I was woefully mistaken there. The posters seem to be fine, and I might hang up the Fairyland Story poster somewhere if I can find a frame for it, but I don't know yet. Even the fridge magnet they included feels flimsy as hell! The outer boxes themselves, as well as the coin collection and pin are also fine, the latter of which are the only real non-paper feelies aside from the CD and the mentioned fridge magnet.\n\nNot only that, but a lot of the extras feel like they're only there to artificially inflate the price of the CE. The instruction card/flyer repros and coin collection are kinda neat and make sense for something like this, but I dunno if a CE of an arcade collection really needs... postcards and stickers? Especially with the target audience probably never even touching them out of fear of lowering the value of it. I'd love to use the Ptolemy and Chack'n stickers on something, but I fear it'll ruin the value of it or whatever. Granted, if they don't disintegrate sometime soon with how flimsy those are too...\n\nAnd speaking of the instruction cards, the paper quality on them isn't the only bad thing on them...\n\nThey... localized them into English. Gone are the nice text and formatting of the originals, but now a sloppily added font that barely fits with the original formatting, as well as details that are missing from them (the Fairyland Story instruction card is supposed to have a green Taito seal that's all but missing from the new reproduction). Some of them look fine enough, especially like on the back of the flyers, which are mostly text anyhow, but some look downright awful like the above examples. I wouldn't even have minded as much if they just took more care into matching the fonts and whatnot all up with the original formatting, which they didn't here. It looks like I pointed the Google Translate camera app on it.\n\nEven better was Strictly Limited's horseshit response, which said it was \"all up to personal taste\" and they did this \"given feedback in the past\". I don't know about you, but the main audience for this collection, admittedly retro gamer weebs like me, would not like this one bit, and I haven't heard of anyone that would WILLINGLY want this. If they also did this to deter bootlegs of it being made, there's also fine print that says it's a reproduction, as well as updated copyright information, so it's not like they didn't cover their bases there. If I were them, I would have included the original formatting/language ones on the back, and extra flyers with the original formatting/language for the double sided ones. That way, everyone is happy, and it's not much more paper included with it. The amateur mistakes don't end here, however...\n\nFor whatever reason, for some of the art used around the CE extras, it uses assets from the console versions of the games included rather than the arcade versions as they are in the main collection.\n\nThe Chack'n Pop postcard uses a screenshot from the Famicom port of the game.\n\nThe character cards for Agent 17 and Ptolemy use their sprites from the Famicom/NES port of Elevator Action , and the title screen sprite from the MSX port of The Fairyland Story , respectively. Ptolemy's hat is also very slightly cut off on her card.\n\nDitto for their manual pages.\n\nI really don't know why they did any of this given how arcade spritesheets for all of the games (and MAME in the case of screenshots) are a click away. It reeks of laziness and inconsistency, and furthermore, sends a message to me that they really don't care for what they are actually selling (which is par for the course for ININ/SLG). It's even weirder when you notice that it uses art from the arcade promo materials for all of the other extras just fine otherwise, and these don't line up with all of that otherwise. They really had no excuse for this given the vast amount of resources the internet and Taito have on the arcade versions, like shown here. Not to mention, I don't exactly know the copyright status the MSX port of The Fairyland Story , even if SLG said Taito approved of everything when they confronted me in Twitter DMs after roasting them publicly...\n\nSpeaking of The Fairyland Story , that brings me to my one of my two issues with the soundtrack CD. The Fairyland Story's music on it sounds very off to me compared to verified PCB footage. Admittedly, this wasn't SLG's fault seemingly. It's the same recent remaster Taito made as found on the large album included with certain orders of the Egret II Mini, and it's the only case of Digital Destruction on an otherwise excellent set of remasters. Otherwise, everything sounds great in it and exactly how it is compared to PCB footage. It's one of the few things I like about this CE. It even includes the nice menu theme of the collection, as well as a cute remix melody of the included games! The CD even has CD-Text on it (Foobar2000 immediately told me the song titles and everything), which is a rarity these days and very appreciated! My only other issue is that I wish it had the entire soundtrack for all the games on it. They had more than enough room to do that for the games with actual soundtracks, especially The Ninja Warriors .\n\nOverall thoughts\n\nI'm glad Taito and Hamster are making an effort to make physical copies of the Taito ACA ports, and I can't pass up having another physical copy of Elevator Action and The Fairyland Story , but this ain't it, chief. Put more effort into the game curation, a better price point, and give me extras that you can't find on the ACA ports, and maybe I'll consider getting more of these if you choose to make more.\n\nAnd this is certainly ain't it for a collector's edition, chief. If I didn't already regret my purchase of an overpriced, mediocre arcade game collection, I regret it even more after getting the even more overpriced and downright awful SLG CE of it. I really regret this purchase and should have heeded the warning of a few of my close friends on not bothering with it at all. Not only that, but the sloppiness of the entire package feels like a big insult to the games represented, and the fans of them as well. These games certainly deserve better even if I'm not a fan of quite a lot of them. SLG certainly knows how to burn their customers after ghosting them for a year or more, and this has given me even more reason to boycott them. I got even more words for them, but they can wait after I get my Cotton CEs from them."
