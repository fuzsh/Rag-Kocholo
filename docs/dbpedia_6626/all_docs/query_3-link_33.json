        "text": "Product Description\n\nThis bundle includes five EXIT: The Game titles.\n\nThe EXIT: The Game series allows you to bring the excitement, intensity, and team spirit of an escape room to your living room. In each EXIT game, your team starts out locked in an imaginary room or trapped somewhere. You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles in order to unlock doors and objects, and reveal new riddles. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle and eventually to freedom.\n\nEXIT: The Gate Between Worlds\n\nCan you solve the riddles and find your way through the worlds and back home?\n\nYou have followed an ancient map to a hidden cave which purportedly contains some kind of mysterious gate. Inside the cave, you find a large metal circle made of concentric rings embedded in the rock wall. You approach the gate hesitantly and touch it. To your astonishment, the metal rings can be rotated. Suddenly, everything goes dark around you. When you regain consciousness some time later, you are no longer in the cave, but in a bizarre new world. Where are you? And how are you supposed to find your way back to the world you know? Only by working together as a team, solving riddles as you travel from world to world, will you be able to make it home safely.\n\nDifficulty level: 3 of 5\n\nEXIT: The Cursed Labyrinth\n\nCan you solve the riddles and escape the impenetrable labyrinth?\n\nDuring a tour of a historic castle, your attention is diverted to an intriguing labyrinth in the middle of the castle’s garden. Towering walls separate it from the outside world, and as you pass through the old iron gate in amazement, the sky suddenly darkens, and the wind begins to pick up. With a loud clang, the antique iron gate slams shut behind you! You try to open it, but it’s locked. Suddenly, to your terror, a gargoyle climbs over the gate toward you. Only by working together will you be able to solve the puzzles and escape the mysterious labyrinth.\n\nDifficulty level: 2 of 5\n\nEXIT: Kidnapped in Fortune City\n\nCan you solve the riddles and stop the kidnapping before it’s too late?\n\nCriminal activity is rampant in the frontier town of Fortune City, and now the sheriff has disappeared without a trace. With precious little time to find him, players need to work together to solve the crime. Over the course of the game, your investigation will lead you through Fortune City, with clues and strange items to be found throughout. You will need to search for answers in the saloon, drugstore, gunsmith, post office, prison, and bank. But in a unique twist, you will decide the order in which you will visit these locations and who you will interrogate along the way. Together with your team, you will collect clues and evaluate the townspeoples’ testimonies. But will you get the answers you need to rescue the sheriff in time?\n\nIn the style of Dead Man on the Orient Express and Theft on the Mississippi, players must get to the bottom of a kidnapping in the Wild West in addition to solving all the riddles.\n\nDifficulty level: 3.5 of 5\n\nEXIT: The Sacred Temple (with Jigsaw Puzzles)\n\nIn EXIT: The Sacred Temple, you are racing through the jungle on a small island in the Indian Ocean, trying to save the professor and find the Sacred Temple before the treasure hunters do.\n\nOnly this time it’s different because there are riddles within riddles hidden within puzzles. Like other EXITs before it, this game has no game board! But it also has no cards; instead, in this new addition to the EXIT series, there are four puzzles, which you will find during play and assemble one section at a time, one puzzle after another. Each puzzle creates an image that will show you what you need to find in the game and what each room looks like.\n\nAt the start of the game, all you have available to you are the puzzle bag containing pieces with a grayish-blue back and no pattern, and the decoder disk. But there are also strange items to be found within the game that may be used to help solve the riddles found in each of the puzzles.\n\nThe game ends when you have solved the last riddle and saved the Professor and the Temple!\n\nDifficulty Level: 3 of 5.\n\nEXIT: The Deserted Lighthouse (with Jigsaw Puzzles)\n\nIn EXIT The Game: The Deserted Lighthouse, you must work to solve the riddles and reach the lighthouse’s top to activate its beacon, saving the approaching ship before it smashes against the rocks and sinks to the bottom of the sea.\n\nOnly this time it’s different because there are riddles within riddles hidden within puzzles. Like other EXITs before it, this game has no game board!
