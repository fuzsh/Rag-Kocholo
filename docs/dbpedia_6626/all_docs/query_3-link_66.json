        "text": "So this my be related to the same issue of not having the controller mapped properly in RetroArch, which is why I have them together. Apologies in advance for the long post, but wanted to explain everything I've done so far and show you all if I've missed a step somewhere.\n\nMy Issue\n\nWhen I'm in a game, pressing the Start + Select combo doesn't do anything and I can't exit back out to the RetroPie menu that lists all of my games. I also can't save any of my games with the Right Shoulder + Select trick.\n\nI can boot the Raspberry Pi, load RetroPie and Emulation Station, and navigate through the menus just fine, even if it is slightly slow. When I load a game (say Super Mario World for this example), I can navigate through the menus just fine, have movement controls plus A/B/X/Y button controls, and I can pause the game. However, when I try to exit out of the game or try to save, the game just pauses like you just hit the start button normally.\n\nWhat I've done so far\n\nI hunted around on YouTube for awhile but as far as I can tell, there is no updated video for RetroPie 4.2.7 that walks you through the process of setting up a controller in RetroArch. I saw one here (\n\n) that said to \"hold Select and tap X\" to open the RetroArch GUI, but when pressed does nothing.\n\nIf I go into RetroPie > RetroArch settings, I can see the same menu as shown in the video, except there is no \"Quick Menu\" option at the top, and \"No Core\" shown on the bottom. This may be because I'm not in a game, but as previously mentioned I can't get to that menu from the game at this time.\n\nCurrently, the only way to exit out of the game is to pull the power supply out and reboot the whole thing, which sometimes causes it not to boot properly.\n\nI believe my issue is that the saved button configuration in RetroPie isn't translating fully to RetroArch and thus doesn't include the shoulder buttons. Or, there is some setting in RetroArch that's not recognizing the command to save/load. I read through some of the help posts on here, but it didn't seem like there is one for this issue. I also looked through the RetroPie Setup page on this site but didn't see anything there either.\n\nMy setup information\n\nPi Model or other hardware: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B\n\nPower Supply used: 5V 2.5A plug in supply that I bought off of Newegg that as listed as a Raspberry Pi 3 power supply.\n\nRetroPie Version Used: 4.2.7\n\nBuilt From: Pre made SD Image on RetroPie website - retropie-4.2-rpi2_rpi3\n\nUSB Devices connected: 1x Logitech G510 keyboard, and 1x Logitech G400 (M-U0028) Gaming mouse\n\nController used: 1x Xbox 360 controller (wired) currently, but would like to add more Xbox 360 controllers later on\n\nError messages received: none\n\nLog found in /dev/shm/runcommand.log (if relevant): not sure where this is. I connected to the pi through WinSCP but there's no file path with this name that I could see.\n\nGuide used: none outside of YouTube videos\n\nFile: (File with issue - with FULL path) - not sure if this is relevant but can provide if someone needs it\n\nEmulator: Base SNES emulator that comes with RetroPie\n\nAttachment of config files: ES Log: https://pastebin.com/NLA3DHLm ; ES Config Log: https://pastebin.com/yFyvYaa7 ; RetroArch Config Log: https://pastebin.com/qpFnGVd9\n\nHow to replicate the problem: Boot RetroPie > select Super Mario World from list > start new game > try to exit back to menu or save using Start + Select or Select + X, respectively.\n\nHopefully that is all the info you guys need, but like I said, let me know if you need any more. Thank you all so much for the help."
