        "text": "Aicom Corporation (株式会社エイコム) was a Tokyo-based game developer and publisher headed by Akio Inoue (井上昭男), formerly of Leijac (Game Machine 1979/6/1, p. 11) and Tehkan (Game Machine 1985/1/15, p. 2). (The name is allegedly short for \"Akio Inoue COMputer.\")\n\nAccording to their corporate history, Sammy established a subsidiary called Aicom Japan (日本エイコム株式会社) in 1990. [1] (The name is written as \"Aicom Japan\" in this Viewpoint sound test. [2]) It was assumed that Sammy acquired Aicom outright; however, a Game Machine report on Aicom Japan's merger into Sammy in 1992 (1992/3/15, p. 3) mentions that Aicom Japan was acquired from Aicom. Other details are unclear in the English translation, but it is implied that Aicom continued to exist separately from Aicom Japan.\n\nInoue also served as president of Aicom Japan. It and another subsidiary, Japan Soft Technology (based in Nagoya), developed arcade and home video game software under Sammy's amusement business division (headed by Minoru Suzuki). Both subsidiaries were absorbed by Sammy on February 3, 1992. With this merger, Inoue became an advisor to Sammy's amusement business division. (Game Machine 1992/3/15, p. 3)\n\nThe name Exa Planning is seen on several arcade games (see entry). This was a company also run by Inoue, most likely a separate company that existed alongside Aicom [3], but there is not much other information.\n\nCyclone System and CP.BRAiN were both started by former Aicom staff.\n\nResearch Methods: Actual mentions, code comparisons, interviews, online resources, shared staff\n\nTODO: Separate Aicom Japan games from Aicom. On that note, sound designer Sizlla Okamura said Aicom Japan was still developing A.B. Cop and Fighting Masters, which they had been working on at the \"old Aicom,\" when he joined in December 1990.

It seems to have been particularly active prior to the formation of Yumekobo. The \"AI\" comes from Akio Inoue. One source says it was a subsidiary of Aicom that made games under the Aicom name and cooperated in the production of Aicom games. [19]\n\n(Developer Dino, a group company of Marvelous started in 1998, included former staff from Yumekobo and Santos. Marvelous president Haruki Nakayama became director of a company called AI Electronics [株式会社エーアイエレクトロニクス] in 2000. [20] Was this the same company?)\n\nNeo Geo\n\nKarate Ninja Shou (unreleased)\n\nOne source claims to have worked on this game at AI Electronics. (With members of Santos? Not sure if that was in general or on this game in particular.)\n\nAnother person says they worked on it at Aicom.

This was originally supposed to be published by Santos as Super Ninja Goku. [22] Interestingly, some of the people who worked on this later worked on the PlayStation RPG The Legend of Dragoon.\n\nSound Effects: First Circle"
