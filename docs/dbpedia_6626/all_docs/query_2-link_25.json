        "text": "Post by 1983parrothead on\n\nIt's been over 20 years since Visco Corporation was founded in 1982. According to former Romstar and SNK America employee Tony Gonzales, Visco Games was one of the few companies under the Taito umbrella, where some had Taito labeled on the title screens and some arcade flyers of several arcade games by them and not Taito. He also believes that Visco and Seta (another Taito umbrella company) are one and the same, because some Visco titles use Seta chips. Allumer also has some of the same employees. Visco has also teamed up with Seta and Sammy in developing the Sammy Seta Visco Board, but later dropped it from the assembly line when Sammy bought Sega to become Sammy Sega Holdings, while Seta became defunct and Visco changed it direction to manufacturing slot machines mostly for other regions in Southeastern Asia.\n\nAfter struggling to find the answer to what was Visco Games' first arcade video game, I think some websites are saying it's Panic Road. I assume that Visco was being an assistant to Taito during the beginning.\n\nTheir second arcade game was Maze of Flott, which is probably a pre-cursor to the Drift Out series, which I will tell about later in this reply.\n\nPerhaps Visco's earliest hit was their third arcade game, Ashura Blaster, a battle jetcopter-based shoot 'em up that is another one of them shoot 'em ups developed by a Taito umbrella company along with Seta's Twin Eagle and Toaplan's Tiger series.\n\nIn the home market, they helped port Seta's Twin Eagle and Toaplan's Rally Bike to the NES, which these ports were published by Romstar overseas. They also created some original titles of their own for the same platform like Great Boxing: Rush Up (known outside of Japan as World Champ) and Western Kids (known outside of Japan as Cowboy Kid). Some other titles they developed were for the Mega Drive / Genesis, including the port of Chiki Chiki Boys (also known outside of Japan for the arcades as Mega Twins). At the same time, they started their Drift Out racing series with Drift Out, which received three sequels: Drift Out '94: The Hard Order, Super Drift Out and Neo Drift Out: New Technology.\n\nWhen the Neo-Geo became quite popular, Visco decided to develop a few titles for the platform, starting with Andro Dunos, a horizontal shoot 'em up with a mixture of elements from several other horizontal shoot 'em ups.\n\nWhile some games they developed like Thunder & Lightning 1 and 2, and Puzzle de Pon! were argued by several gamers as clones. Visco's popularity was at its peak in 1996 when the company announced and released Breakers, which not only was considered by some as a clone of Capcom's Street Fighter II: World Warrior, but some say it is one of the best 3RD-Party Neo-Geo fighting games with Data East's Fighter's History Dynamite (known in the PAL regions as Karnov's Revenge) and a couple of ADK fighting games like World Heroes Perfect and Ninja Master's: Haou Ninpou Chou.\n\nWhile some of you already played this, I've decided to show the not-so popular Neo-Geo CD port (recording directly from a real Neo-Geo CD). See also its related thread.\n\nIn 1998, Visco released an arcade-exclusive version of Breakers known as Breakers Revenge, while in 2000, they started the Vasara series, a series of vertical-scrolling shoot 'em ups. It was their final series of video games before switching to slot machine manufacturing.\n\nwww.hardcoregaming101.net/vasara/vasara.htm\n\nPost by Colonel Kurtz on\n\nI first read the thread title as \"Video Games Appreciation Thread\" and though it was a clever shot at the ever inflationary appreciation-threads. Turns out it's not.\n\nCarry on, never heard of the company. Although I enjoyed Breakers Revenge quite a bit.\n\nI tried to do that some time ago with a \"Titus appreciation thread\"; and though some got it, in the end it became a legitimate Titus thread. Oh, the irony... Though I think it was a bit more successful than all the other \"appreciation\" threads that had appeared everywhere one day. So that was fun!\n\nUhhhh... Visco... More than remembering seeing the name, we are getting deeper down the rabbit hole with them. None of their games really pleased me, sorry..."
