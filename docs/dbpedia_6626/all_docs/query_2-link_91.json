        "text": "By Allison Watkinson\n\nTLL Reporter\n\nWildBrain CPLG has secured several licensing partnerships for Taito’s Space Invaders arcade brand on behalf of Square Enix Ltd.\n\nSpace Invaders is an arcade game that was originally manufactured by the Japanese company Taito, which was acquired by Square Enix Holdings Co. Ltd. as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 2006.\n\n“The 45th anniversary is a great milestone for Space Invaders, with players from all generations now having enjoyed the game for almost half a century,” said Square Enix VP Janet Swallow. “The brand continues to go from strength to strength as an icon of popular culture all over the world, and we’re looking forward to continuing to grow the merchandise program together with our trusted global partner WildBrain CPLG to really take the franchise out of this world.”\n\nThe new licensing partnerships secured for the Space Invaders brand include deals with the Champion athletic brand, H&M, Aquarius/NMR Distribution, Sabor SRL, Brava Fabric, and Timex.\n\nThe deals inked by WildBrain CPLG for the brand span several key markets such as the US, Canada, Spain, Portugal and Andorra.\n\nThe partnership with the Champion athletic brand includes an adult apparel collection that features crewnecks, t-shirts, Bermuda pants, track pants and hoodies that feature characters from the Space Invaders game.\n\nThe Champion x Space Invaders range will launch in EMEA for the 2023 holiday season on the Champion website, Champion stores, and through a select number of the brands’ retail partners.\n\nH&M will create a direct-to-retail Space Invaders collection that includes apparel, hosiery, accessories and personal electronics cases. The collection will be available globally in stores and online for the 2023 holiday season.\n\nThe fashion brand Sabor SRL will also be launching apparel, hosiery and headwear in Italy early this year.\n\nThe sustainable fashion brand Brava Fabric is developing an additional Space Invaders apparel line and the Timex brand is creating a commemorative digital watch for the brands’ anniversary.\n\nAquarius/NMR Distribution is creating a gift and novelty product line for distribution across North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n“Space Invaders has a remarkable international legacy and is one of the most enduring gaming brands in pop culture today, with lasting appeal across multiple generations,” said WildBrain CPLG VP, Jasen Wright. “As Space Invaders celebrates its 45th anniversary in 2023, we’re excited to further expand the merchandise offering for fans through fresh, relevant and creative collaborations with a variety of equally renowned global partners.”\n\nWildBrain CPLG has also secured several licensing renewals and extensions for the Space Invaders brand. These extensions include licensed Alchemy3 lottery tickets in North America, Bentex for apparel in the US, and Karactermania for accessories in Spain, Portugal and Andorra.\n\nWildBrain CPLG is an entertainment, sports and brand licensing agency. WildBrain CPLG provides its clients with licensing and marketing expertise, legal and accounting services, and product development services.\n\nSquare Enix Ltd. develops, publishes, distributes, and licenses Square Enix and Taito branded entertainment content in Europe and other PAL territories as part of the Square Enix group of companies.\n\nUkraine’s Brave Bunnies Defy Russian Invaders, With Help From WildBrain"
