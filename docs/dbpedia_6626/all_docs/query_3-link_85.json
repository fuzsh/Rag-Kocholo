        "text": "Hideki Kamiya, who directed Resident Evil 2 and was the chief creator of Devil May Cry, has announced his surprise departure from PlatinumGames effective October 12.\n\nConfirmation comes from a statement issued by Platinum as well as a brief statement published to Kamiya’s Twitter account. In his statement, the 52-year-old said: “This came after a lot of consideration based on my own beliefs, and was by no means an easy decision to make.\n\n“However, I feel this outcome is for the best. I will continue to create in my Hideki Kamiya way. I hope you'll keep your eyes peeled.” The statement suggests Kamiya plans to continue working in video game development.\n\nKamiya, who founded Platinum in 2006, is perhaps best known for his work at Capcom, where he directed a raft of influential games, including Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, and, while at Clover, Okami and Viewtiful Joe. At Platinum, Kamiya directed Bayonetta, The Wonderful 101, the canceled Scalebound, Sol Cresta, and was working on a brand new, self-published game codenamed Project G.G.\n\nIn a December 2022 interview with IGN, Kamiya said Project G.G. was “going to be so big that you won't even be able to compare The Wonderful 101: Remastered and Sol Cresta to it. Because of that, we need to become a company with publishing capabilities on that level, not just development power”.\n\nImage credit: Patrick T.
