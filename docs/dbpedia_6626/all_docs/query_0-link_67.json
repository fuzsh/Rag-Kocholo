        "text": "According to the latest financial reports, Taito Corporation has seen significant growth in the past fiscal year. The Square Enix-owned subsidiary reported a yearly operating profit of 4.8 billion yen, which is a 60.9% year-over-year increase. (Source: GameBiz)\n\nTaito, the developer of legendary arcade games such as Space Invaders, currently operates amusement and entertainment facilities, online claw machine games and other businesses in addition to game development. Taito’s amusement sector in particular witnessed growth over the past fiscal year, particularly in comparison to the stark losses they reported in 2021.\n\nAs Covid19-related restrictions loosened up, Japan saw a spike in inbound tourism and people coming out of lockdown. These factors, along with internal reorganization carried out by Taito during the pandemic, drove the company’s financial growth.\n\nAccording to GameBiz, the scale of Taito’s businesses grew by 3.7 times compared to fiscal year 2019, the year before the Covid19 pandemic. In other words, they have not only recovered from the slump caused by the pandemic, but have also entered a new phase of growth."
