The Super Pocket is a brand new retro gaming handheld, featuring built-in arcade games from major gaming publishers that can fit in your pocket!\n\nThe first two Super Pocket devices coming to retailers in 2023 are the Super Pocket Capcom Edition and the Super Pocket TAITO Edition. Each console is available for £49, $59, €59 and can be pre-ordered from July 14th ahead of their release in October 2023.\n\nMany products in the retro gaming market at this price point often include five games or less and more often include home console ports of the arcade games. Except where noted, Super Pocket brings you the actual arcade games, so you can coin up to your hearts content and beat those games that cost you all your pocket money when you first played them.\n\nThe Super Pocket Capcom Edition comes with 12 amazing games from the legendary publisher including 11 arcade games including Street Fighter II’: Hyper Fighting, Final Fight, 1942, and the home console version of the original Mega Man.

A new feature that lowers the difficulty of games so that you can get past hard to master levels with ease, or so that a younger person can play without a challenging difficulty spike in the games.\n\nIn addition to the included games, both Super Pockets are fully compatible with Evercade Cartridges. These game cartridges made for Blaze Entertainment’s Evercade system content legally licensed games from multiple publishers and will insert into the super pocket through a cartridge port on the rear of the console. The complete library of cartridges is supported meaning that Super Pocket owners can expand their library to over 500 games with these cartridges.\n\nThe Super Pocket itself is small enough to fit in your pocket (78mm x 125mm x 25mm) and features four face buttons, a start and select button and a menu button, along with a new circular D-Pad, designed for the Super Pocket. It also includes four rear buttons for games that require expanded controls.
