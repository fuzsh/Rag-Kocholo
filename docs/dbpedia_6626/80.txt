Taito Corporation, a renowned name in the video game industry, boasts a rich history that spans several decades. Founded on August 24, 1953, by Michael Kogan, the company initially operated as an importer and distributor of vending machines. This modest beginning marked the start of a journey that would lead Taito to become a significant player in the arcade and video game markets. Taito's foray into the world of video gaming began with Elepong, a ping-pong arcade cabinet, released in 1973 in Japan. This early venture set the stage for the company's future success in the gaming industry.

One of Taito's most iconic and influential contributions to the video game industry came in 1978 with the release of Space Invaders. This groundbreaking arcade game not only propelled Taito to international fame but also played a pivotal role in shaping the future of video gaming. Developed by Tomohiro Nishikado, "Space Invaders" introduced players to a simple yet captivating concept: defending the Earth against rows of descending alien invaders using a movable laser cannon.

The game's success was unprecedented, creating a cultural phenomenon that extended far beyond the realm of video games. Space Invaders was instrumental in popularising the shoot 'em up genre and is often credited with helping to establish video gaming as a global industry. The game's influence was seen in its ability to draw in players of all ages, creating a new wave of enthusiasm for arcade games.

Space Invaders not only had a significant impact on the gaming industry but also on popular culture, inspiring various adaptations, merchandise, and even serving as a reference in music, television, and film. Its legacy continues to be felt today, with Space Invaders"often cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.

The success of Space Invaders marked a turning point for Taito, solidifying the company's position as a leading game developer and setting the stage for its future innovations in the gaming world.

The mid-1980s to early 1990s was a period of significant growth and innovation for Taito. During this time, the company released a series of groundbreaking titles that left a lasting impact on the gaming world. One of the most notable releases was Bubble Bobble in 1986, a charming platformer featuring two dragons, Bub and Bob. The game's engaging gameplay, coupled with its memorable music, made it a hit in arcades and on home consoles. The success of "Bubble Bobble" led to the release of "Rainbow Islands: The Story of Bubble Bobble 2" in 1987, a sequel that introduced new gameplay mechanics and further expanded the beloved Bubble Bobble universe.

In 1989, Taito introduced The New Zealand Story, a unique platformer starring a kiwi named Tiki. The game stood out for its vibrant graphics and challenging gameplay. It was followed by "Cadash" in the same year, an action RPG that skillfully blended platforming elements with role-playing game mechanics.

The early 1990s saw the release of Puzzle Bobble (also known as Bust-A-Move), a puzzle game that featured characters from the Bubble Bobble series. Launched in 1994, Puzzle Bobble quickly became a staple in arcades and home consoles, popularising the match-three puzzle genre with its addictive gameplay.

Another significant contribution from Taito during this era was Kaiser Knuckle (1994). This fighting game, while not as commercially successful as some others of the era, demonstrated Taito's willingness to explore various genres and innovate within the rapidly evolving video game market.

Taito's influence was not limited to Japan; the company established North American divisions, Taito America in 1973 and Taito Software in 1988. However, Taito America ceased operations in July 1996, leading the company to focus more on the Japanese market and license its titles to other publishers for international release.

A pivotal moment in Taito's history occurred in August 2005, when Square Enix, a major gaming conglomerate, announced its intention to acquire a majority stake in Taito. The acquisition was finalised by the end of September 2005, making Taito a wholly-owned subsidiary of Square Enix. This strategic move was part of Square Enix's broader plan to diversify into new gaming areas, particularly the arcade scene, marking a new chapter in Taito's history.

Throughout its history, Taito has been celebrated for its innovative approach to game development and its ability to adapt to changing market trends. From its origins as a vending machine distributor to becoming a powerhouse in the video game industry, Taito's journey is a testament to the company's resilience, creativity, and enduring impact in the world of entertainment.
