According to a post over at GameFront, Ubisoft's Exit will be making its way to the DS. GameFront cites Japanese gaming mag Famitsu as the source of this delicious chunk of news. Originally a PSP title, players were charged with escaping structures within the designated time limit. Along the way, obstacles would hinder the player's progress.

No news on the game's features in migrating to the DS. The new game will be developed by Taito Corporation, who also took over duties on the first PSP title. Aside from that, we only know of a release date: January 2008.
