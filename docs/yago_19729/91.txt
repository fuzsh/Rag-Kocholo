Family

Marie Caroline was a daughter of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor, later Francis I of Austria after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and Maria Teresa of the Two Sicilies, and named after an elder sister who had died in infancy. She belonged to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine.

Marriage

On 7 October 1819 she married in Dresden, Germany to Prince Frederick Augustus of Saxony, son of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony, and Princess Caroline of Parma. The marriage was childless and unhappy.
