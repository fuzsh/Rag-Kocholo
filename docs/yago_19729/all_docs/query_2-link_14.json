        "text": "This article is about King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. For the elector Frederick Augustus III, see Frederick Augustus I of Saxony.\n\nFrederick Augustus III (German language: Friedrich August III.) (25 May 1865, Dresden – 18 February 1932, Sibyllenort) was the last King of Saxony (1904–1918) and a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nBorn in Dresden, Frederick Augustus was the first son of King George and his wife, Maria Anna of Portugal.\n\nFrederick Augustus served in the Royal Saxon Army before becoming king, and later was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall. Though well-loved by his subjects, he voluntarily abdicated as king on 13 November 1918, after the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. He died in Sibyllenort (now Szczodre) in Lower Silesia and was buried in Dresden.\n\nMilitary career[]\n\nFrederick Augustus entered the Royal Saxon Army in 1877 as a second lieutenant, despite being only twelve years old. Given his royal status, he advanced rapidly through the ranks. He served initially with the Royal Saxon 1. (Leib-) Grenadier Regiment Nr. 100. He was promoted to first lieutenant in 1883, captain in 1887, major in 1889 and lieutenant colonel in 1891. By 1891, he was commander of the 1st Battalion of Schützen (Füsilier)-Regiment Nr. 108. He was promoted to colonel on 22 September 1892 and took command of the Schützen (Füsilier)-Regiment Nr. 108 on the same day. On 20 September 1894, the 29-year old prince was promoted to Generalmajor and given command of the 1st Royal Saxon Infantry Brigade Nr. 45 (Saxon higher units usually bore two numbers: one their Saxon Army number and the other their number in the Prussian Army order of battle). On 22 May 1898, he was promoted to Generalleutnant and given command of the 1st Royal Saxon Infantry Division Nr. 23. He commanded this division until 26 August 1902, when he took command of the XII (1st Royal Saxon) Corps. He was promoted to General der Infanterie one month later, on 24 September. He remained in command of the corps until October 1904, when he became king. His formal military career ended with his accession to the throne, but he was promoted subsequently to Generaloberst and then to Generalfeldmarschall (on 9 September 1912).\n\nFamily[]\n\nFrederick Augustus married Archduchess Luise, Princess of Tuscany, in Vienna on 21 November 1891. They were divorced in 1903 by the royal decree of the King after she ran away while pregnant with her last child. Luise's flight from Dresden was due to her father-in-law threatening to have her interned in Sonnestein Mental Asylum for life. Her brother supported her in her wish to escape Saxony. Emperor Franz-Josef of Austria-Hungary did not recognise the divorce.\n\nThey had seven children:\n\nFriedrich August Georg, Crown Prince of Saxony (1893–1943). After becoming a Jesuit priest, he renounced his rights in 1923. He was allegedly assassinated by the SS or Gestapo in 1943.[citation needed]\n\nFriedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen, Duke of Saxony (1893–1968). Married Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis (1903–1976) and had issue.\n\nErnst Heinrich (1896–1971). Married first Princess Sophie of Luxembourg (1902–1941), daughter of Guillaume IV, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, in 1921 and second Virginia Dulon (1910–2002) in 1947 (morganatically). Had issue with Sophie.\n\nMaria Alix Carola, stillborn 22 August 1898\n\nMargarete Carola Wilhelmine (1900–1962). Married Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern (1891–1965).\n\nMaria Alix Luitpolda (1901–1990). Married Franz Joseph, Prince of Hohenzollern-Emden (1891–1964).\n\nAnna Monika Pia (1903–1976). Married firstly Archduke Joseph Franz of Austria (1895–1957) and secondly Reginald Kazanjian (1905–1990).\n\nTheir two eldest sons, Friedrich August and Friedrich Christian were born in the same year, 1893, but were not twins. Friedrich August was born in January, while Friedrich Christian was born in December.\n\nQuotes[]\n\nWhen standing in uniform on a station platform, a lady asked him to move her trunk. He is reported to have replied, \"Madam, I am not a porter; I only look like one.\"[1]\n\nWhen the German Republic was proclaimed in 1918, he was asked by telephone whether he would abdicate willingly. He said: \"Oh, well, I suppose I'd better.\"[2]\n\nUpon abdicating, he is supposed to have said \"Machd doch eiern Drägg alleene!\" (Saxon for \"Do your stuff alone!\"), but there is no documentation of this.\n\nWhen cheered by a crowd in a railroad station several years after his abdication, he stuck his head out of the train's window and shouted, \"You're a fine lot of republicans, I'll say!\"[2]\n\nAncestry[]\n\nDecorations and awards[]\n\nFrederick Augustus was Grand Master of the following Saxon Orders:\n\nOrder of the Rue Crown\n\nMilitary Order of St. Henry\n\nAlbert Order\n\nCivil Order of Saxony\n\nSaxon Service Order, 1st class (25 years service)\n\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Fleece (Austria)\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Military Order of Max Joseph (Bavaria)\n\nKnight Grand Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (Austria-Hungary)\n\nPour le Mérite (Prussia)\n\nIron Cross, 1st and 2nd class (Prussia)\n\nNotes[]\n\n[]\n\nFrederick Augustus III of Saxony, ThePeerage.com"
