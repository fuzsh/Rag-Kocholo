        "text": "What a great find! I can see the resemblance too: the amount of pearls, the openness of the piece and the height. At the RJWMB they are speculating that the tiara may have been the base of a larger one and got modified over the years.\n\nYes, I know. For years I tried to become a member there(RJWMB), but somehow I just can't. That's why I posted my thoughts here.\n\nThe speculation about Regina's jewels made me think about what I noticed. There is also one other pastel portrait of Princess Adelheid of Saxe-Meiningen wearing the same bandeau tiara.\n\nGreat find, Marc23! The bandeau pictured in the portrait of Princess Adelheid looks definitely like the bandeau worn by AD Regina and Francesca. On the RJWMB they speculate that this is the base of Empress Zita's tiara, but imho the resemblance is only vague. There are no pearls in Zita's tiara, eg., but there are in Adelheid's bandeau. And as Marengo already pointed out, the number of pearls, the proportions and the spacing are a match.\n\nThe portrait of Princess Adelheid looks like early twentieth century, when smaller bandeau tiaras had become en vogue. So it could very well be jewel that designed as a bandeau, and not just a base of a bigger tiara.\n\nThe bandeau's look reallythe same but how would it come from Princess Adelheid to Archduchess Regina? Adelheid had children herself.\n\nWell, Adelheid was Regina's aunt. Maybe the tiara actually belonged to Regina's grandmother and Adelheid's mother, Princess Adelheid zur Lippe. She died only in 1948 and after her death Regina might have inherited it, while Adelheid of Prussia might have borrowed her mother's jewels to wear for the portrait. If u can, please post Adelheid's portrait to RJWMB, maybe someone will find the connection.\n\nPrincess Renata von Altenburg(Habsburg) wearing a tiara at her wedding to Eduardo de Zulueta y Dato, grandson of Eduardo Dato e Iradier, Duke of Dato and Prime minister of Spain:\n\nhttps://scontent.fbeg4-1.fna.fbcdn....=9d910ac9226d47a254324d21a216e986&oe=5C176964\n\nCould the earrings be those worn by her mother Alice von Altenburg in this picture?\n\nhttps://goo.gl/images/5Wd3tb\n\nAlice is wearing what looks to be the same pair of earrings as above in this picture as well. Alice is the the first lady from the left sitting in the front row.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/25_rocznica_ślubu.jpg\n\nCould the earrings be those worn by her mother Alice von Altenburg in this picture?\n\nhttps://goo.gl/images/5Wd3tb\n\nAlice is wearing what looks to be the same pair of earrings as above in this picture as well. Alice is the the first lady from the left sitting in the front row.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/25_rocznica_ślubu.jpg\n\nWell, to me, they look the same. Good point.\n\nWell, to me, they look the same. Good point.\n\nI've been trying to look for the tiara among their Swedish and Habsburg relatives but no luck so far. The family was in dire needs at the time after leaving Poland and had already sold off Empress Marie Louise's Emerald Tiara at the time of the wedding so I wonder if Renate is wearing a tiara belonging to her own family. Princess Alice was living in a two room flat without a kitchen and furnished with what her relatives could spare.\n\nCountess Anna Theresa von Arco-Zinneberg:\n\nhttps://royalwatcherblog.com/2018/09/29/wedding-of-countess-anna-theresa-von-und-zu-arco-zinneberg/\n\nhttps://www.nettyroyalblog.nl/engag...ding-in-bavaria-with-an-impressive-guestlist/\n\nQuote from Vincent from RJMB:\n\n\"1) The tiara is made of elements of diamonds which come from princess Hélène of France, second duchess of Aoste. It was created for her daughter in law, princess Anne of France, 3rd duchess of Aoste. It belongs to the archduke of Austria-Este (Archduke Lorenz) who loaned it to his niece, Countess Anna Theresa, who is also his god-daughter.\n\n2)The earrings belong to countess Arco (archduchess Maria Beatrice of Austria-Este. They were a wedding gift from her own parents in 1980.\n\n3)The stars definitely did belong to empress Sissi. But they don't come from the Habsburg. They come from the Arco-Zinneberg and, before that, the Preyssing-Lictenegg-Moos family. Count Riprand's grand mother, princess Gundelinde of Bavaria who married a count von Preyssing-Lichtenegg-Moos, received them from her aunt, archduchess Gisela of Austria who had married a Bavarian prince. Of course, Gisala was Sissi's daughter.\"\n\nGerman and Austrian Royal and Noble Jewels\n\nVincent Meylan from Point de Vue shared a few pictures on Instagram taken at the ball following the wedding of Duchess Sophie von Würtemberg to Count Maximilian d’Andigne.\n\nPrincess Mathilde von Waldburg-Zeil, aunt of the bride, is wearing the original Cambridge Lover’s Knot Tiara made for Duchess Augusta of Cambridge which was later the inspiration for Queen Mary when she had her own Lover’s Knot Tiara made.\n\nThe tiara was sold by the heirs of Princess Augusta of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, née Cambridge in the fifties and later bought by Princess Mathilde’s father-in-law at an auction in the nineties.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpOmpMSnQGs/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=do68o8hiix62\n\nThe mother of the bride, Duchess Marie Caroline of Würtemberg wore a ruby and diamond parure that previously belonged to Duchess Maria Immaculata of Würtemberg, née Habsburg-Toscana.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BpOpXAJnfHd/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=iuyh50mcgem0\n\nBoth of the ladies are pictured wearing the tiaras for the first time.\n\nDoes she usually wear her mother’s tiara or has she never been pictured wearing a tiara before?\n\nBoth ladies wear their tiaras very well. Perfectly styled which is unfortunately not always the case at the German weddings.\n\nFor her pre Wedding Gala she wore the bavarian diamond rosette tiara and for her Wedding the douglas floral tiara. The only other time she was pictured wearing one was the pre Wedding Gala of her sister Elisabeth in 2004 when she wore the bavarian diamond and pearl floral tiara. For the pre Wedding Galas of her sister Sophie and her brother-in-law Friedrich she wore none.\n\nOf course there could have been other occasions where she wore one but was not pictured.\n\nFor her pre Wedding Gala she wore the bavarian diamond rosette tiara and for her Wedding the douglas floral tiara. The only other time she was pictured wearing one was the pre Wedding Gala of her sister Elisabeth in 2004 when she wore the bavarian diamond and pearl floral tiara. For the pre Wedding Galas of her sister Sophie and her brother-in-law Friedrich she wore none.\n\nOf course there could have been other occasions where she wore one but was not pictured.\n\nDuchess Marie wore the Bavarian Diamond tiara at least three times:\n\n- 2005 at the wedding of Prince Manuel of Bavaria and Princess Anna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg\n\n- 2005 at her sister Elizabeth's pre-wedding ball\n\n- 2011 at the wedding of Prince Georg Friederich of Prussia and Princess Sophie of Isenburg.\n\nThe confusing thing is, that she wore the same gown and jewels at all three events, so the pics can be a bit difficult to tell apart.\n\nThis is the first time that I see a pic of her with a Württemberg tiara. And the ruby tiara suits her really well.\n\nI assume that these pics are just an appetizer, and that more will be published in Point de Vue in November.\n\nEdit: Do we know anything about the origins of the Bavarian rosette tiara? I have only see it worn by Marie and her sister Elisabeth.\n\nIf i only had known earlier that there would be a white tie Ball on the evening of the Wedding as i was at Tegernsee on Saturday but had to leave in the early afternoon because i had to get my train.\n\nDid we get to see a pic of her at the prussian Wedding? Can't remember. Had thought there was none of her from that occasion. Vincent Meylan says the ruby Parure is now owned by Duke Philipp.\n\nApparently there will be also more pics in the coming Issue of Poiunt de Vue."
