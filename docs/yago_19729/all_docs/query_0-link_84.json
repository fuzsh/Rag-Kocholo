        "text": "With King William III, Queen Mary II and Queen Anne we move into the end of the Stuart Dynasty and the reason for the enthronement of the Hanoverian Dynasty with their nearest Protestant cousin, George Louis.\n\n​William, Mary and Anne can be viewed as a mini dynasty of their own at the end of the Stuart line and after the Glorious Revolution. Queen Mary II and Queen Anne were sisters, daughters of the deposed King James II & VII. William III & II was not only Mary's husband but also her first cousin and came directly after the two sisters in the Protestant succession to the Throne anyway. After the Glorious Revolution, William and Mary would rule jointly. When Mary died first, William reigned alone until Anne succeeded him. Anne died without any surviving heirs and so the Stuart Dynasty came to an end. Their Protestant Hanoverian cousins then succeeded.\n\nMonarchs of the Stuart Dynasty often have two regnal numbers. For instance, King William was III and II. Mary was II and I. This is because there had been differing amounts of monarchs by those names in the two separate countries. Mary and Anne's Father was James II and VII. His Grandfather had been James I (of England) and VI (of Scotland). There had been no previous King Charles or Queen Anne in either country, so they started from scratch.\n\nAlthough, technically, this situation should have cropped up again with King William IV and the Monarchs from and including King Edward VII, the country/countries had entered into the union of the United Kingdom by then. Sowem would argue that they were using their English regnal number with disregard to Scotland, however, by chance, these monarchs already held the highest regnal numbers of their respective names. And thereby lies the resolution of the situation when the matter did arise.\n\nThe issue arose again when the current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II came to the Throne in 1952. Scotland had never before had a reigning Queen Elizabet as the previous queen of that name had been queen of England only. Objections were raised as to the use of the royal cypher EIIR anywhere in Scotland, resulting in several violent incidents, including the destruction of one of the first new EIIR pillar boxes in Scotland, at Leith in late 1952. Since then, the cipher used in Scotland on all government and Crown property and street furniture has carried no lettering, but simply the Crown of Scotland from the Honours of Scotland. A court case in 1953, contesting the style \"Elizabeth II\" within Scotland, MacCormick v Lord Advocate,was thrown out on the grounds that the numbering of monarchs was part of the royal prerogative.It was suggested by Winston Churchill that, in the future, the higher of the two numerals from the English and Scottish sequences would always be used. So, theoretically, any future British King Edward would be given the number IX, even though there have only been two (or three) previous Edwards in Scotland, but any future King Alexander would be given the number IV, even though he would be the first Alexander to reign in England. ​\n\nWilliam and Mary\n\nJoint Coat of Arms of HM King William III and HM Queen Mary II. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nWhere does one start to tell the story of how William and Mary came to the Throne? Whilst not being the first joint sovereigns in the British Isles (Queen Mary I of England had her husband King Philip II of Spain proclaimed King, as did Mary Queen of Scots with Lord Darnley) they were the first husband and wife to be jointly crowned King and Queen in their own rights, which necessitated a second set of Crown Jewels, although it is not clear what Crowns were used for either. It was certainly a 'revolutionary' period in British history. The Stuart Dynasty, as we will see, was never far from controversy, but let's keep it simple...\n\nMary II (30th April 1662 – 28th December 1694) was Queen of England, Scotland, and Ireland, co-reigning with her husband, King William III & II, from 1689 until her death. She was the eldest daughter of the Duke of York (the future King James II & VII) and his first wife, Anne Hyde.\n\nAlthough their father was Roman Catholic, Mary and her younger sister Anne were raised as Anglicans at the wishes of their uncle, King Charles II. Charles lacked legitimate children, making Mary second in the line of succession. She married her Protestant first cousin, William of Orange, in 1677. Mary's father was the brother of William's Mother, Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. Charles died in 1685 and James came to the throne, making Mary Heiress Presumptive. James's attempts at rule by decree and the birth of his son, James Francis Edward Stuart who was brought up Catholic, led to his deposition in the Glorious Revolution and the adoption of the English Bill of Rights.\n\nWilliam and Mary became King and Queen regnant. Though William relied heavily on Mary, she wielded less power than William and, when he was in England, ceded most of her authority to him. She did, however, act alone when William was engaged in military campaigns abroad, proving herself to be a powerful, firm and effective ruler. Mary's death left William as sole ruler until his own death in 1702, when he was succeeded by Mary's sister, Anne.\n\n​\n\nMarital Coat of Arms of William and Mary as Prince and Princess of Orange. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nWilliam and Mary's Coat of Arms before they became Joint Sovereigns naturally show William's Arms as Prince of Orange from birth and Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders and Overijssel in the Dutch Republic marshalling Mary's British Arms.\n\nBefore her marriage, Mary bore her Father's Arms on a Lozenge with Supporters and a plain Coronet above. James, as Duke of York, had been assigned a Label of three Points ermine but, as Heir Presumptive to his childless (legitimate anyway) brother, King Charles II, was in the habit, especially in Scotland, of displaying the plain white Label of an Heir Apparent, though with no official sanction.\n\n​Mary was in the habit of following her Father's line or, in fact, of dropping the Label all together. As Princess of Orange she also displayed her marital Arms on two separate Shields.\n\nWilliam and Mary's joint Coat of Arms is a rather striking version of the Royal Achievement, as shown above. What look like very grand Grand Quarterings are, in fact, the marshalled Arms of husband and wife, complicated by two facts:\n\nWilliam and mary were first cousins\n\nThe Coat of Arms of Great Britain/United Kingdom are basically the same for the Royal Family as well as the country itself and are therefore territorial. William III's Arms cannot really be considered as dynastic because he remained a member of the House of Stuart and, as we have seen with the House of Hanover, the Arms themselves are also territorial.\n\nPresumably to emphasise his descent from King James I through his Mother as a Member of the House of Stuart, William III's Coat of Arms was simplified from his many Quarters as Prince of Orange to the Stuart Coat of Arms (the same as his wife) plus an Inescutcheon for Nassau. Side by side, they retained the Stuart Supporters - the Lion and Unicorn - the British Crest, the Garter and the British Motto of 'Dieu et mon Droit'.\n\n​\n\nWilliam III\n\nCoat of Arms of HM King William III. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nWilliam Henry (Dutch: Willem Hendrik) (4th November 1650 – 8th March 1702) carried on as sole Monarch after Mary's death in 1694 in accordance with the Bill of Rights.\n\nWilliam was the only child of William II, Prince of Orange, who died a week before his birth, and Mary, Princess of Orange, the daughter of King Charles I. A Protestant, William participated in several wars against the powerful Catholic King Louis XIV of France, in coalition with Protestant and Catholic powers in Europe. Many Protestants heralded him as a champion of their faith. In 1685, his Catholic uncle and father-in-law, James, became King. James's reign was unpopular with the Protestant majority in Britain, who feared a revival of Catholicism. Supported by a group of influential British political and religious leaders, William invaded England in what became known as the Glorious Revolution. In 1688, he landed at the south-western English port of Brixham and, shortly afterwards, James was deposed.\n\nWilliam's reputation as a staunch Protestant enabled him and his wife to take power. During the early years of his reign, he was occupied abroad with the Nine Years' War (1688–97). Queen Mary II died in 1694. In 1696, the Jacobites plotted unsuccessfully to assassinate William and return his father-in-law to the throne. William's lack of children and the death in 1700 of his sister-in-law Anne's last surviving child Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, threatened the Protestant succession. The danger was averted by placing distant relatives, the Protestant Hanoverians, in line. Upon his death in 1702, the king was succeeded in Britain by Anne and as titular Prince of Orange by his cousin, John William Friso.\n\nCoat of Arms of William Henry, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau, later King William III of England, France, Scotland and Ireland. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nAs Prince of Orange, William's Arms were:\n\nQuarterly, I Azure billetty a Lion rampant Or (for Nassau); II Or a Lion rampant guardant Gules crowned Azure (Katzenelnbogen); III Gules a Fess Argent (Vianden), IV Gules two Lions passant guardant Or, armed and langued azure (Dietz); between the I and II Quarters an Inescutcheon, Sable a Fess argent (Flushing); at the fess point an Inescutcheon, quarterly I and IV Gules, a Bend Or (Châlons); II and III Or a Bugle Hunting Horn Azure, stringed Gules (Orange) with an inescutcheon, Nine Pieces Or and Azure (Geneva); between the III and IV Quarters, an Inescutcheon, Gules a Fess counter embattled Argent (Buren).\n\nAfter Mary's death, her Arms were dropped from the Royal Achievement and the country was represented by William's Arms alone with the Inescutcheon of Nassau at its centre. However, the Motto was changed from 'Dieu et Mon Droit' to William's personal one, 'Je Maintiendrai' which means 'I Will Maintain' in French as the House Orange originated from southern France. This remains the Motto of the Dutch Monarch. This would still appear to emphasise the person of the Monarch as Head of State of the country.\n\n​\n\nQueen Anne\n\nAnne (6th February 1665 – 1st August 1714) was Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland between 8 March 1702 and 1st May 1707. On 1st May 1707, under the Acts of Union, the kingdoms of England and Scotland united as a single sovereign state known as Great Britain. She continued to reign as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death in 1714.\n\nAnne was born in the reign of Charles II to his younger brother and heir presumptive, James, whose suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England as we have seen. Anne married Prince George of Denmark in 1683. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.\n\nDuring her reign, Anne favoured moderate Tory politicians, who were more likely to share her Anglican religious views than their opponents, the Whigs. The Whigs grew more powerful during the course of the War of the Spanish Succession, until 1710 when Anne dismissed many of them from office. Her close friendship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, turned sour as the result of political differences. The Duchess took revenge with an unflattering description of the Queen in her memoirs, which was widely accepted by historians until Anne was re-assessed in the late 20th century.\n\nAnne was plagued by ill health throughout her life and, from her thirties, she grew increasingly ill and obese. Anne's sole surviving child, the Duke of Gloucester, died at the age of eleven on 30th July 1700, six months after Anne's final pregnancy ended with a still birth. She and her husband were \"overwhelmed with grief\". With William childless and Gloucester dead, Anne was the only individual remaining in the line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. To address the succession crisis and preclude a Catholic restoration, the Parliament of England enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which provided that, failing the issue of Anne and of William III by any future marriage, the Crown of England and Ireland would go to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants. Sophia was the granddaughter of James VI and I through his daughter Elizabeth, who was the sister of Anne's grandfather Charles I. Over fifty Catholics with stronger claims were excluded from the line of succession. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the parliamentary union of the two countries in 1707.\n\nSophie died before Anne, however, and so it fell to Sophie's eldest son, George Louis, to succeed to the Throne when Anne passed away in 17014.\n\n​\n\nShield of the Arms of Great Britain, France and Ireland (1707-1714). Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nAlthough, in this day and age it seems rather strange to talk about it, but Anne was a supporter of union between England and Scotland. Scotland was keen to pursue its own interests as far as the Succession to the Throne was concerned and wanted to make its own choice and insisted at one stage on choosing someone else to heir to the Throne of England. With various acts flinging back and forth between the two parliaments, Anne set up a board of commissioners in 1706 to negotiate terms, which were ratified by the Scottish and English Parliaments on 16th January and 6th March 1707, respectively. Under the Acts of Union, England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom called Great Britain, with one parliament, on 1st May 1707.\n\nHeraldically, this was represented by the 'union' of the Arms of England with Scotland. (I can find no reference to this being a requirement of the Acts, by the way.)\n\nThere would also be a new Royal Badge and Flag.\n\nAnne's Coat of Arms had reverted to those of her Father and her Stuart ancestors as Kings. The Inescutcheon of Nassau for King William III was dropped. Anne did, however, adopt Queen Elizabeth I's Motto 'Semper Eadem' which means 'Always the Same' in Latin and which had been her own Mother, Anne Boleyn's Motto.\n\nWith the Acts of Union the Shield was rearranged as shown above. Ireland's Harp remained in the third Quarter. France's Fleurs-de-Lys were 'relegated' to the second Quarter. England and Scotland were joined, or conjoined, in a special way.\n\nThe basic combining of two Coats of Arms is called Marshalling. Here, England and Scotland both occupy the first and the fourth Quarters. If you look carefully, though, something else occured. Impalement is one form of Marshalling and simply combines two full Coats of Arms sitting side-by-side. However, there is a throwback to the times of what is called Dimidiation where any Bordure, Tressure or Orle (in other words, any Charge which goes round the Shield) dissolves into the line of the Impalement. Here, the left-hand side of the famous red Double Tressure flory-counter-flory of Scotland disappears into the dividing line. This was meant to represent the close union of 'Great Britain'.\n\nAll other aspects of Anne's and therefore Great Britain's Coat of Arms remained the same. Semper Eadem...\n\nPrince George of Denmark, Duke of Cumberland\n\nPrince George of Denmark and Norway (2nd April 1653 – 28th October 1708), was Anne's husband. His original name in Denmark was Jørgen.\n\nHis marriage to Anne was arranged in the early 1680s with a view to developing an Anglo-Danish alliance to contain Dutch maritime power. As a result, George was unpopular with his Dutch brother-in-law, William III.\n\nGeorge sided with his father-in-law at first. But when William invaded England in November 1688 and King James's troops started to swap over to William's side, George abandoned James and sided with William. William excluded George from active military service and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence. However, William assented to a bill naturalising George as an English subject in early April 1689. George was created Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal and Baron of Okingham (Wokingham) by the new monarchs.\n\nDuring Anne's reign, George occasionally used his influence in support of his wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and little interest in politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.\n\nAnne's seventeen pregnancies by George resulted in twelve miscarriages or stillbirths, four infant deaths, and a chronically sick son, William, who died at the age of eleven. Despite the history of their children, George and Anne's marriage was a strong one. George died aged 55 from a recurring and chronic lung disease, much to the devastation of his wife, and he was buried in Westminster Abbey.\n\nCoat of Arms of Anne as Princess of Denmark, later Queen Anne of Great Britain. Author: Wikipedia/Sodacan.\n\nWe have previously explored George's Coat of Arms in two previous Blogs - Royal Crests - Denmark and UPDATE: Royal Crest - Denmark.\n\nThe Shield shown here represents Anne's Arms as Princess of Denmark and Norway. As her sister Mary often did, Anne dropped her Father's Label and marshalled the plain Royal Arms with her husband's. This is unfortunate as the Label assigned to James as Duke of York was of three Points ermine, exactly the same as George! This would have lent a certain symmetry to Anne's marital Arms before succeeding to the Throne.\n\nIt is possibly not a coincidence that George was assigned this Label at all. There is no record of the Label being assigned in Denmark (i.e. before his marriage) as there was, and still is, no history of assigning Labels as marks of cadency within the Danish Royal Family or Scandinavian heraldry as a whole. The Chapter of the Royal Danish Orders of Knighthood is of the opinion, therefore, that the Label, if not the whole Coat of Arms, was a British Grant.\n\n​\n\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester\n\nWilliam Henry (24th July 1689 – 30th July 1700) was the only child of Anne and George of Denmark to survive infancy. His namesake uncle, King William III (himself William Henry as well), declared him Duke of Gloucester at his christening three days after his birth, although the title was never formally created. The infant William was viewed by contemporaries as a Protestant champion because his birth seemed to cement the Protestant succession established in the \"Glorious Revolution\" that had deposed his Catholic grandfather King James II & VII the previous year.\n\nAnne was estranged from her brother-in-law/cousin and her sister, the Joint Monarchs, but supported links between them and her son. He grew close to his uncle, who created him a Knight of the Garter, and his aunt Mary, who frequently sent him presents. At his nursery in Campden House, Kensington, he befriended his Welsh body-servant, Jenkin Lewis, whose memoir of the Duke is an important source for historians, and operated his own miniature army, called the \"Horse Guards\", which eventually comprised 90 boys.\n\nGloucester's precarious health was a constant source of worry. He suffered from hydrocephalus and had an enlarged head. His death in 1700 at the age of 11 from precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was not only the sole remaining individual in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689, what would be her last pregnancy six months earlier had resulted in yet another stillborn child. The English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic and so enacted the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs. As seen above the repercussions on the Acts of Union, the Scottish Parliament at this stage wanted to choose its own successor and therefore did not ratify the Act of Settlement until the Union. Sophia's son George Louis succeeded to the British Throne as the first Monarch of the House of Hanover after Sophia predeceased Anne.\n\nWilliam's Coat of Arms is recorded on his Garter Stallplate. Although the grandchild of a monarch and the nephew of two others during his lifetime, he was assigned the three-pointed Label of a son of the Heir Apparent. Had he seen his Mother succeed to the Throne he would almost certainly have been created Prince of Wales and have beeen assigned a plain Label. However, he was assigned a St George's Cross to his Label as King Richard II had received being the grandson of his predecessor, King Edward III. His Arms also carried an Inescutcheon of the usual simplified version of the Danish Arms from his Father, being still a very patriarchal society despite both his Mother and Aunt being queens regnant.\n\nThe Blason was and still is for Denmark:\n\nOr, three Lions passant in pale azure crowned and armed Or langued gules, nine Hearts gules\n\nIf William had lived and succeeded his Mother, we would have seen the first monarch of the Oldenburg Dynasty.\n\nImperial Standard of the Emperor of Japan, showing the Imperial Chrysanthemum Seal or Mon. Source: Wikipedia/Zscout370\n\nTrends in Japan (https://web-japan.org/trends/11_fashion/fas181202.html) outlines the origins of the Japanese Mon (Kamon) very neatly. As European Coats of Arms represent an individual, especially the British system, in Japan the Mon represents the house and family, similar to the Continental system, especially in the German-speaking world. So the whole family, not just parents and siblings, use the same Mon. A closer comparison could be the badge.\n\nThere are various opinions as to the reason that Mon were created in Japan. Strangely, both main reasons are largely parallel with the set-up of the European system of heraldry but with a different visual outcome. The predominant reason is that noble families started to use them at the end of the Heian Period (794 - 1185) when Japan was governed by the nobility - primarily the Emperor. Noble families attached Mon to their belongings as identifying symbols and tried to make their own beautiful decoration look appealing. That is why a lot of Mon use designs that include flowers and plants, etc.\n\nAfter the Kamakura Period (1185-1333) when Japan was ruled by the Shogun - which was the military commander with the highest authority among the samurai - most of the warlords across Japan started to have their own Mon. Compared to the graceful design of the nobility's Mon, those of the samurai clans were designed as practical symbols to be put on flags, helmets and armour so that they could be seen at a glance in battle. As the purpose of the Mon for samurai clans was identification on the battlefield, simple geometric designs were devised that allowed them to tell the difference between one clan and another at a glance.\n\nThe Chrysanthemum, or Kiku in Japanese, is a symbol that represents longevity and rejuvenation. When first introduced to Japan during the Nara period (710 – 793), the Japanese Imperial Family was fascinated with the Chrysanthemum. Eventually, during the passing of the years, the Chrysanthemum become the Imperial Family Mon. As you will see from the representation of the Emperor's Standard above, the Imperial Seal of Japan features 16 petals at the front and 16 petals at the back (where only the tips of the petals are visible). There are other Chrysanthemum seals or Mon with different numbers of petals, usually related to other branches of the Imperial Family, as we will see. Nowadays, the Japanese Diet (Government) uses the plain 16 petals seal for official documents (passports, orders, etc).\n\nThe Emperor's Throne is referred to as the Chrysanthemum Throne and carries the emblem on chair back. The highest order of chivalry in Japan is the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum, awarded by the Emperor.\n\nHaving said that, some speculate that the Mon represents the sun. In Japanese mythology, the first Emperor, Jimmu, was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu.\n\nWhatever the origin, a decree was issued in 1871 at the time of the Meiji Restoration and the establishment of modern Japan, that forbade the use of any Mon which could be mistaken for the Emperor's. It also specified that the Emperor's Mon had a small disc in the middle to signify that his, alone, was viewed from the front. Imperial princes not only had a Chrysanthemum Mon with 14 Petals but also showed the calyx of the flower to signify that it was viewed from below.\n\n​The following Mon are for various princely branches of the Imperial Family. If anybody has any specific information regarding the extra elements, the equivalent to cadency in the western world, and any history behind them, I would be extremely grateful.\n\nMon of the Akishino branch of the Imperial Family. Author: Wikipedia/Mukai.\n\nThe Japanese Crown Prince and first in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne is, in fact, the Emperor's brother. His given name is Fumihito and his childhood title was Prince Aya. He is Heir Presumptive because his brother's only child is Princess Aiko and females are not eligible to succeed to the Japanese Throne. The 'presumption' is that the Emperor and Empress could still have a son who would then become heir. At his marriage in June 1990, Fumihito was granted the title Akishino-no-miya (the equivalent to a dukedom in the European system and generally translated into English as Prince Akishino) and has headed his own branch of the Imperial Family.\n\nAs such, his branch of the Imperial Family was granted its own Mon, still retaining the Imperial Chrysanthemum at the centre with 14 petals at the front and 14 at the back. The ruling with regard to the calyx seems largely to be ignored nowadays.\n\n​\n\nMon of the Hitachi branch of the Imperial Family. Author: Wikipedia/Mukai.\n\nPrince Hitachi is the younger brother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito and is therefore the current new Emperor's uncle. His given name is Masahito and his childhood title was Prince Yoshi.\n\nAgain, he was authorised to start a new branch of the Imperial Family in celebration of his wedding to Hanako Tsugaru, who is now Hanako, Princess Hitachi, and was granted the above Mon which similarly shows the Chrysanthemum with 2 times 14 petals.\n\nPrince Hitachi is mainly known for philanthropic activities and his research on the causes of cancer.\n\nMon of the Mikasa branch of the Imperial Family. Author: Wikipedia/Mukai.\n\nPrince Mikasa was the last remaining brother of Emperor Hirohito. He died in 2016 as the oldest living member of the Japanese Imperial Family. His given name was Takahito and his childhood name was Prince Sumi. The title of Prince Mikasa and the authority to found a cadet branch were granted to him when he gained his majority in December 1935. He did not marry until 1941.\n\n​He was a career soldier and was shocked at the army's conduct in China during World War II to the point of advising his Brother to abdicate and take responsibility. The Prince later turned to studies, mainly about the Middle East.\n\nAlthough Prince Misaka died only a couple of months short of his 101st birthday, his wife, ​Yuriko Takagi, daughter of Viscount or kazoku Masanari Takagi, survives him as the oldest member of the Imperial Family. His eldest son, Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, was naturally expected to inherit the full title of Prince Misaka but Tomohito, nicknamed the Bearded Prince, died of cancer before his Father, aged only 66.\n\nThe Mon of the Misaka branch also contains the 14 double-petalled Chrysanthemum.\n\nMon of Prince Katsura. Author: Wikipedia/Mukai.\n\nPrince and Princess Mikasa's second son was Yoshihito. He received the title Prince Katsura and authorisation to start a new branch of the Imperial Family on 1 January 1988 at the age of 39. However he also died before his Father, on 8th June 2014, also at the aged of 66.\n\nYoshihito was, in fact, the last remaining male descendant of Prince Mikasa. He never married nor had any legitimate children and so his death marked the end of his Father's branch of the Imperial Family and also his own branch.\n\nYoshihito, Prince Katsura's Mon shows the 14 double-petalled Chrysanthemum within a rather geometric framework patter rather than surrounded by plants or flowers.\n\nMon of the Takamado branch of the Imperial Family. Author: Wikipedia/Mukai.\n\nNorihito, Prince Takamado was the third son and final child of Prince and Princess Mikasa, but was the first to die in 2002 of heart fauilure. He was only 47.\n\nHe received the title Prince Takamado and authorization to start a new branch of the Imperial Family on 1 December 1984 in celebration of his wedding to Hisako Tottori, eldest daughter of Shigejirō Tottori, which took place 5 days later.\n\nHis early death, following a game of squash, shocked the nation. He and his wife, Hisako, Princess Takamado, became known as the most widely travelled of the Imperial Family; a tradition which Princess Takamado has maintained. Their three daughters are excluded from inheriting the Takamado title.\n\nPortrait of HM King George I of Great Britain from the Studio of Godfrey Kneller (1646–1723), 1714. In the Collection National Portrait Gallery. Accession number : NPG 544.

He was the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.\n\nBorn in Hanover to its Elector Ernest Augustus and Electress Sophia, George inherited the titles and lands of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg from his father and uncles. Sophia, however, became heiress presumptive to the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland under the Act of Settlement 1701 as the nearest Protestant descendant of King James I. Her mother, Elizabeth of the Palatinate and Queen of Bohemia was the sister of King Charles I. A succession of European wars expanded his German domains during his lifetime and he was ratified as Prince-Elector of Hanover in 1708. After the deaths in 1714 of his mother and his second cousin Anne, Queen of Great Britain in quick succession, George ascended the British throne as Anne's closest living Protestant relative under the Act of Settlement 1701. Jacobites attempted, but failed, to depose George and replace him with James Francis Edward Stuart, Anne's Catholic half-brother.\n\nAs such, George placed a scaled-down version of the multiple-quartered Arms of Brunwick-Lüneburg (Hanover) in the fourth Quarter of Queen Anne's Great Britain Arms, replacing the repetition of the marshalled England/Scotland Arms. This Quarter is blazoned as follows:\n\nTierced per pale and per chevron, I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an escutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or (for the dignity of Archtreasurer of the Holy Roman Empire).\n\nQueen Anne had used the Motto 'Semper Eadem' (Always the Same) - the same as Queen Elizabeth I - but George reverted to the more usual 'Dieu et Mon Droit' (or 'God and My Right'). It would have been more apt if he had used 'Parliament and My Right'.\n\nAll other aspects of the Realm's Arms remained the same for this new Dynasty until the reign of King George III as we have seen in this previous Blog.\n\nAs Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector-Designate of Hanover, George inherited the many-quartered Coat of ​Arms of his Father. As such, he was Elector-Designate to the Holy Roman Empire, awaiting ratification of high office to what was effectively the Cabinet of the Empire. As Duke, George showed a plain red Inescutcheon at the centre of his shield and an Electoral Bonnet (the equivalent of a Coronet) on top.\n\nIn 1706 the Elector of Bavaria was deprived of his offices and titles for siding with France against the Empire in the War of the Spanish Succession. The following year, George was invested as an Imperial Field Marshal with command of the imperial army stationed along the Rhine. His tenure was not altogether successful, partly because he was deceived by the Duke of Marlborough into a diversionary attack, and partly because Emperor Joseph I appropriated the funds necessary for George's campaign for his own use. Despite this, the German princes thought he had acquitted himself well and in 1708 they formally confirmed George's position as a Prince-Elector.\n\nGeorge resigned as field marshal the following year, never to go on active service again and in 1710 he was granted the dignity of Arch-Treasurer, one of the high offices of the Empire, placing a gold representation of King Charlemagne's Crown on the plain red Inescutcheon. This established the pattern of the Head of Sate and, thereby the country, having the Shield with the Crown and the heir having the plain Shield.\n\nIt is not entirely a coincidence that the Arms of Brunswick are similar to the Norman Arms of England and the Arms of Westphalia/Hanover are similar to Saxon Kent.\n\nThe Brunswick Lion is the stuff of legend. Shortly after his death in 1195, the Welf Duke Henry the Lion of Brunswick became the subject of a folktale, the so-called Heinrichssage. Henry was supposed to have been on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land and witnessed a fight between a lion and a dragon. Henry sided with the lion and defeated the dragon. However, away from the saga, he had a bronze lion, his heraldic animal, erected in the courtyard of his castle Dankwarderode in his capital Brunswick in 1166. Henry was married to Matilda of England as his second wife, daughter of King Henry II. It is not implausible, in the fledgling years of heraldry, that Henry 'inherited' his Arms from his father-in-law, which at that stage were possibly still the attributed Arms of two Lions passant guardant of William the Conqueror. It would be his son, Richard the Lionheart (Henry's brother-in-law), who would adopt the third Lion and thereby create the famous \"Arms of England\".\n\nThe white Horse of Saxon Kent refers by tradition to the emblem of brothers Horsa and Hengist, said to have led the Angles, Saxons and Jutes in their invasion of Britain in the 5th Century, who according to legend landed in Kent in 449 under the banner of a rampant white horse and defeated the King Vortigern near Aylesford. Even their names refer to horse and stallion. Some historians maintain that Jutes migrating to Kent through the continent may have been associated with the Rhineland and South Saxony. The white Horse remains a key part of the heraldry of that corner of the world. A large number of pubs in the county also feature White Horse in their name, although elsewhere in the country this may come from the Hanoverians.\n\nThe Saxon Steed is allegedly a very old tribal symbol of Saxony in Germany and also of the House of Welf from which the Hanoverians were descended, appearing first in the late 14th Century. It became the symbol of Hanover and is now the symbol of Westphalia and Lower Saxony, which are all roughly in the same area of central Germany. (It is variously shown either jumping or rampant.)\n\nSophia Dorothea of Celle\n\nPortrait of Sophia Dorothea of Celle by Jacques Vaillant (1643–1691), circa 1690-1691.

Source: Wikipedia/Caro1409~commonswiki\n\nLittle can be said of ​Sophia Dorothea of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Celle (15th September 1666 – 13th November 1726), the wife of future King George I, as they were divorced in 1694, long before George came to Great Britain.\n\nSophia and George's fathers were brothers and the union between first cousins was an arranged marriage of state, instigated for financial reasons by his mother, Electress Sophia of Hanover, who evidently didn't like either of them.\n\nShe is best remembered for her alleged affair with Philip Christoph von Königsmarck which led to her being imprisoned in the Castle of Ahlden for the last thirty years of her life.\n\n​Whilst one can imagine that her Coat of Arms as Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg would be a double-up of very similar Arms, Sophia Dorothea was never Queen of Great Britain, she never had a Coat of Arms as a British Royal.\n\n​\n\nSophia Dorothea of Hanover, Queen Consort of Prussia\n\nPortrait of Sophie Dorothea, Queen Consort of Prussia by Antoine Pesne (1683–1757), 1737. Collection Charlottenburg Palace. Accession number: GK 1218. Source: Wikipedia/Jan Arkesteijn.\n\nSophia Dorothea (26th March [O.S. 16th March] 1687 – 28th June 1757) was the only daughter of George Louis and Sophia Dorothea of Celle. She was detested by her elder brother, King George II of Great Britain.\n\nAfter the divorce and imprisonment of her mother, she was raised in Hanover under the supervision of her paternal grandmother, the Electress Sophia. She married her cousin, Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia, heir apparent to the Prussian throne, on 28th November 1706. They had met as children when Frederick William had spent some time in Hanover under the care of their mutual grandmother, the Electress Sophia, and though Sophia Dorothea disliked him, Frederick William had reportedly felt an attraction to her early on.\n\nSophia Dorothea and Frederick William differed from each other in every aspect and the marriage suffered as a result. Having said that, they had 14 children, the most famous of whom was Frederick who was their third son but the first to survive infancy. He would go on to succeed his father as King of Prussia and become known as Frederick the Great.\n\nFrederick succeeded in 1740. He had a good relationship with his Mother. When she addressed him as \"Your Majesty\" after the funeral of his Father, he is alleged to have interrupted her and told her: \"Always call me your son, that title is dearer to me than the royal dignity.\"\n\nSophia Dorothea died in 1757, soon after Frederick returned from his first campaign during the Seven Years' War.\n\nThere is likewise no record of her Coat of Arms readily available, either as a Princess of Hanover, Great Britain or even as Queen Consort of Prussia.\n\nPS To add to the confusion of names, not only was Sophia Dorothea, Queen of Prussia's paternal grandmother the Electress Sophia and her mother Sophia Dorothea of Celle, her mother-in-law was Sophia Charlotte of... Hanover and none other than her paternal aunt, sister of her father, George Louis!\n\n​\n\nErnest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany\n\nErnest Augustus, Duke of York and Albany (17th September 1674 – 14th August 1728) was the younger brother of George Louis. He was a soldier and served with some distinction under Emperor Leopold I during the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession.\n\nThe first five years of his life were spent in Osnabrück, as one of his father's titles was Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück, until his father became Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the family moved to Hanover. After their father's death, George inherited all the lands and titles, including the Electorate. Their father, as part of the conditions he had to fulfil to acquire an Electorate, had adopted primogeniture. This effectively stopped the splitting up of land into evermore fragmented kingdoms and princedoms, thus disinheriting younger sons. Unlike his four elder brothers, Ernest Augustus did not oppose this change. Thus, when George became King and moved to London, Ernest Augustus took on the mantle of the senior head of the family in Brunswick-Lüneburg. In this capacity, he became regent in all but name, and took on the duty of care for George's seven-year-old grandson, Frederick Lewis, the future Prince of Wales. (Frederick Lewis was left in Germany as a diplomatic move, to reassure the populace and any ambitious neighbouring states of the family's continuing commitment to its German lands.)\n\nThe death of Charles Joseph, Elector of Trier, in 1715, meant that it was the turn of a Protestant to become Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück under the terms of the Treaty of Westphalia. This position as a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and ruler of an independent principality was shared between Catholics and Lutherans and was usually a held by member of the House of Welf whenever the turn came to Protestants. George's next brother Maximilian William of Brunswick-Luneburg had become a Catholic, so he nominated Ernest Augustus to be elected by the Osnabrück cathedral chapter. The position was not just an honorific, and so Ernest Augustus had to divide his time between Schloss Osnabrück and the court at Herrenhausen in Hanover.\n\nErnest Augustus did visit England and on 29th June 1716, he was created Duke of York, Albany and Earl of Ulster. On 30th April 1718 (OS), he was created a Knight of the Garter together with his grand-nephew Frederick Lewis.\n\nHe died a year after his brother King George had died on a visit to Osnabrück. As Ernest Augustus never married, his titles became extinct.\n\nAs a British Prince and brother of the King, Ernest Augustus was assigned a three-pointed Label in 1716, each Point bearing three red Hearts. This is the first time that Hearts appeared on a British Royal Label of cadency and they are believed to have come from the background of the Quarter in the Hanoverian Arms that represents Lüneburg.\n\nIn keeping with a Warrant of King Charles II of 9th February 1661, Ernest Augustus's Arms carried a Coronet composed of Crosses and Fleurs-de-Lys. This counted for \"brothers of Our Successors Kings of England\" as well as sons.\n\nAdditionally, Ernest Augustus, as sovereign Prince-Bishop ecclesiastical principality of Osnabrück within the Holy Roman Empire, carried an Inescutcheon in the Hanoverian Quarter. This was white with a red, six-spoked Wheel. This should not be confused with the city of Osnabrück where the Wheel is black.\n\nWhen it was the Protestant Prince's turn again to be Prince-Bishop (in 1764) another Duke of York and Albany was chosen. This time it was Frederick, second son of King George III and his write-up can be seen in a previous Blog.\n\nCoat of Arms of the Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück. Authorage: WappenWiki/JSpuller"
