        "text": "Circa 1904.\n\nMeasurements: 37mm x 30mm.\n\nYellow gold dual cypher of King Frederick August III of Saxony. Contained in its original Morocco case by Gebr. Friedlander of Berlin, the lid applied with a crown. Fitted with brooch pin and pendant loop.\n\nFrederick Augustus III (1865-1932) was the last King of Saxony. Born in Dresden, he was the eldest son of King George of Saxony and his wife, Maria Anna of Portugal. He served in the Royal Saxon Army before becoming king in 1904, and later was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall. Though well-loved by his subjects, he voluntarily abdicated as king on 13 November 1918, after the defeat of Imperial Germany in the First World War. He died in Sibyllenort in Lower Silesia (now Szczodre in Poland) and was buried in Dresden. When standing in uniform on a station platform, he was asked by a lady to move her trunk. He is reported to have replied, \"Madam, I am not a porter; I merely look like one.‚Äù"
