        "meta_description": "Miniatures were a popular medium of early modern material court culture and representation, symbolising social, dynastic or political affiliation while, at the same time, evoking a special bond between wearer and object. They were used as diplomatic gifts, as commemorative tokens of highly emotional events such as births, marriages and deaths, as substitutes for absent or deceased persons as well as proxy in marriage negotiations and betrothal ceremonies. By integrating these small objects – as a picture in a picture – into large-scale portraits, they were directly contextualised with the sitter, publicly conveying personal or political messages, thus becoming interactive telling objects. Set in sumptuous jewellery, as pendants, brooches or bracelets, they were worn as symbols of luxury and status as well as badges of sentiment, loyalty or propaganda. As objects of virtue, like souvenirs or snuffboxes, they were shown and perceived as items of economic, material and symbolic value but could also operate as hidden clues or dynastic emblems. In addition, the allusion to their origins as gifts or heirlooms, i.e. to the process of giving and receiving, as well as the open display of wearing, handling or regarding not only constituted a relation between sitter and object but also implemented a narrative structure. This essay would like to open the discourse on this specific interactive potential of miniatures by analysing different modes of display and context based on selected eighteenth-century female European court portraits.",

        "text": "Modes of display\n\n8In addition, this larger range of display options also allowed a differentiated interaction between sitter and object while equally involving the beholder. The sitter could draw the attention of the onlooker via gestures and eye contact inviting him or her to examine the miniature more closely, thus creating a narrative structure and influencing the perception. This could be done subtly through rhetorical gestures and inviting looks over the shoulder or directly through gestural interaction and direct eye contact. However, the depiction was always subject to a deliberate staging.\n\n9The following examples (fig. 1-6) will give a glimpse of these variations. The miniature worn openly as part of the stomacher jewellery or as a medallion pinned to the bodice appears in the portraits of Elisabeth Farnese, Queen of Spain, by Miguel Jacinto from the 1720s and Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily by Camillo Landini from 1787, both wearing the portraits of their husbands (figs. 1-2).\n\nFig. 2 Camillo Landini, Maria Carolina of Austria (1752-1814), 1787, oil on canvas 135 x 105 cm, Naples, Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte © Cultura Italia / Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali (MiBAC)\n\nFig. 3 Anton Raphael Mengs, Queen María Luisa as Princess of Asturias (1751-1819), c.1765, oil on canvas, 152.1 x 110.5 cm, Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado.

Source: Wikimedia Commons [public domain]\n\n12Whereas Anna Maria Luisa de’ Medici faces the beholder head-on, presenting the miniature portrait of her husband Johann Wilhelm, the Elector Palatine, like a monstrance, the young Spanish queen Maria Luisa seems to have been interrupted while lovingly regarding the portrait of her husband Philip V.\n\nFig. 5 Unknown artist, Maria Luisa of Savoy, holding a miniature portrait of her husband Philip V of Spain, c. 1705-1709, oil on canvas 185 x 140 cm, © Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado\n\n13Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, Queen of Sardinia, on the other hand, presents the miniature of her husband Charles Emmanuel III on a side table, next to an open jewellery box, as if she has just taken the precious item out to show it off, shielding it with her hand.\n\nFig. 6 Martin van Meytens, Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg (1706-1735), Queen of Sardinia, after 1724, presenting a miniature of her husband Charles Emmanuel on a table, oil on canvas 202 x 117 cm, Turin, Palace of Venaria © Cultura Italia / Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali (MiBAC)\n\n14Apart from these different options of displaying and staging, the presentation of a miniature was always closely linked to the contexts of its origin, to the relationship between donor and recipient, be it as a betrothal or marriage gift, as a commemorative token or as part of an ancestral portrait gallery, linking the sitter as recipient to a specific function, as here in the case of the female members of the aristocracy, to their roles as brides, consorts, mistresses, queens in their own rights, mothers, daughters or widows. These contexts not only constituted the message of the entire painting but also its perception. Even though these messages may overlap, often a certain objective is recognisable, as will be discussed below based on selected examples.\n\nThe ceremonial aspect: the bride\n\n15 ‘Hierbey überliefern sie bißweilen das / Portrait des Hoch=Fürstlichen Herrn Bräutigams, / welches (...)\n\nHereby they occasionally deliver the portrait of the princely bridegroom, which is richly studded with diamonds, as a pledge of his love, with the assurance that he reserves himself the right to appear in persona [...] Sometimes, one of the princess’ parents would attach the portrait of the prince, delivered by the envoy, personally to the princess’ chest.\n\n18By transferring these betrothal miniatures as a motif into large-scale portraits, the ceremony was visually documented for posterity of which Louis de Silvestre’s portrait of Maria Anna of Saxony (1728-1797), holding the diamond-bordered miniature portrait of her bridegroom, Elector Maximilian III Joseph of Bavaria, bears witness (figs. 7, 7a).\n\nFig. 7a Louis de Silvestre, Maria Anna of Saxony, 1746, (detail) © Munich, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, photo: Bastian Krack\n\n19But not only the classic oval medallion or boîte à portrait served this purpose. As seen in a portrait of Maria Luisa of Parma (1751-1819) by Laurent Pécheux, snuffboxes were also used as betrothal or wedding gifts (fig. 8).\n\nFig. 8 Laurent Pécheux, Maria Luisa of Parma (1751-1819) as Princess of Asturias, 1765, Oil on canvas 230.8 x 164.5 cm © Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe sentimental aspect: the wife and consort\n\n21In addition to the aforesaid one-time staging that connotes a specific ceremonial event, miniatures can also symbolise a more intimate and long-lasting sentimental relationship between the sitter and the object received, usually emphasised by direct physical contact. Whereas the demonstrative exhibition of the miniature as a precious object primarily underlines the legal and dynastic aspects, the integration of the portrait of the fiancé, respectively the husband, into jewellery constantly worn indicates a more intimate, even sentimental bond. As mentioned above, portrait miniatures mounted on pearl bracelets belonged to the most popular items worn by royal women in the eighteenth century.\n\nFig. 9 Johann Georg Ziesenis, Queen Charlotte (1744-1818) when Princess Sophie Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, about 1761, oil on canvas, 134.9 x 96.8 cm, The Royal Collection Trust, © Her Majesty the Queen 2019\n\nFig. 10 Johan Joseph Zoffany, Queen Charlotte (1744-1818), c. 1771, oil on canvas 162.9 x 137.2 cm, The Royal Collection Trust, © Her Majesty the Queen 2019\n\nPolitical legitimisation: the empress\n\nFig. 11a Jean-Étienne Liotard, Maria Theresa, 1747 (detail) ©Amsterdam, Rijksmuseum\n\nFig. 12 Johann Peter Kobler, Maria Theresa as Queen of Hungary in coronation robe, wearing a portrait miniature of her husband, 1751, oil on canvas 318 x 220 cm © Vienna, Bundesmobilienverwaltung, Standort Hofmobiliendepot, Möbel Museum Wien, photo: Edgar Knaack\n\nFig. 13 Philipp Andreas Kilian after van Martin Meytens, copperplate, etching 92.6 x 65.5 cm ©Albertina, Vienna\n\n29Maria Theresa is pointing with her left hand at the portrait of Francis Stephan attached to her bodice while Justitia and Fortuna are holding the imperial crown over her head. Hereby, she indirectly claims herself as sovereign of the Holy Roman Empire, standing as proxy for her husband who in turn is present in a hierarchically reduced form via his portrait miniature.\n\nDynastic affiliations and propaganda: widow, mother, daughter, grand-daughter, mistress\n\n30As widows, mothers, daughters or mistresses early modern aristocratic women could use the display of miniatures to underline complex dynastic claims, political ambitions and familial relations. Hence, portraits of royal widows wearing or holding the portrait miniature of their late husbands were more than just a statement of personal grief, they were a symbol of moral virtue and dynastic continuity. For early modern consorts the role model of widowhood served as a connective emblem, connoting positive virtues as well as allowing a very individual approach to form alliances, to perform power or to display emotions. This topic is covered in the portraits of Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham, wearing a pendant with the portrait of her murdered husband, and in Charles Beaubrun’s portrait of a widow, presumably Marie Louise Gonzaga, mourning over the miniature of her husband Władysław IV Vasa.\n\n31In addition, widow portraits could explicitly express dynastic propaganda, for example, if the role of the widow was overlapping with the role of the mother of the heir presumptive. By showing the portrait of her first-born son, the widow would try to legitimise the succession and to consolidate the dynasty. The reduced miniature-like portrait of the hereditary prince could be a reference to the ceremonial decorum as well as to the form of ancestry galleries and genealogical tablets. Often, these depictions correlated with the situation of an impending regency and the necessity to strengthen the own dynasty, as in the portrait of Anne of Austria holding the oval portrait of her son Louis XIV.\n\n32Both these threads are interwoven in the portrait of Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, Queen of Denmark and Norway, executed around 1766 by the Hanoverian court painter Johann Georg Ziesenis (fig. 14).\n\nFig. 14 Johann Georg Ziesenis, Queen Juliana Maria of Denmark-Norway with a portrait of her son, prince Frederick the heir presumptive, c. 1766, oil on canvas 138 x 100 cm, Frederiksborg Castle, The Museum of National History Museum, Source: Wikimedia Commons [public domain]\n\nFig. 15 Anton Raphael Mengs, María Antonia Fernanda of Spain, duchess consort of Savoy, princess of Piemont and queen consort of Sardinia holding the two portrait miniatures of her daughters, after 1773, oil on canvas 200 x 150 cm, Versailles, Châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon, © bpk | RMN - Grand Palais | Gérard Blot\n\n35Maria Antonia was the youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and his second wife Isabella Farnese. She had married Victor Amadeo III, Prince of Piedmont and Duke of Savoy, in 1750. The marriages of her daughters Marie Joséphine Louise in 1771 and Maria Theresa in 1773 to the surviving brothers of Louis XVI of France had significantly expanded her dynastic connections. Born Spanish Infanta, married Queen of Sardinia and mother-in-law to the two royal princes of the French House of Bourbon, Maria Anna is demonstrating in this portrait her powerful dynastic influence via the miniatures of her daughters.\n\nFig. 15a Anton Raphael Mengs, María Antonia Fernanda of Spain, after 1773, (detail), Versailles, Châteaux de Versailles et de Trianon, © bpk | RMN - Grand Palais | Gérard Blot\n\nFig. 16 Anton Raphael Mengs, Infanta Maria Josefa of Spain (1744-1801), after 1768, oil on canvas 104 x 75 cm, Palace of Caserta, © Cultura Italia / Ministero per i beni e le attività culturali (MiBAC)\n\n38Such a bond could be also extended to past generations. Dynastic and sentimental commemorative aspects are linked in the portrait of Alexandra Pavlovna, who is wearing the eye-catching miniature of her grandmother Catherine the Great on her bodice. The portrait was painted by Vladimir Borovikovsky in the year of the Czarina’s death (fig. 17).\n\nFig 17 Vladimir Borovikovsky, Alexandra Pavlovna, wearing a portrait miniature of her Grandmother Catherine the Great, 1796, oil on canvas 72 x 58 cm, Gatchina Museum and Palace.

Set in sumptuous jewellery they were worn as symbols of luxury and status as well as badges of sentiment, affiliation or propaganda. As objects of virtue they were shown and perceived as items of economic, material and symbolic value but at the same time could operate as hidden clues or dynastic emblems. In addition, the allusion to their origins as gifts or heirlooms, i.e. to the process of giving and receiving, as well as the open display of wearing, handling or regarding not only constituted a relation between sitter and object but also implemented a narrative structure into the depiction."
