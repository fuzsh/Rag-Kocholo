Son of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony and Princess Caroline of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nOn September 26, 1819 Frederick Augustus II married Archduchess Caroline of Austria, daughter of Emperor Francis I of Austria. Following her death, on April 24, 1833 he married Princess Marie Anne Leopoldine of Bavaria.\n\nThere were no children of either marriage. He was succeeded by his brother, Johann I.\n\nIn 1849 revolutionary disturbances broke out in the Kingdom, forcing Frederick Augustus to flee to KÃ¶nigstein fortress. The May Uprising was crushed by Saxon and Prussian troops and Frederick was able to return after only a few days."
