        "text": "In 1999, Dr. Mary Neal met Jesus face to face while trapped under a Chilean waterfall and learned to put her total trust in God.\n\nHer experience as she drowned, as well as what she’s learned about God since then, are the topics of her two bestselling Christian books.\n\nOn March 7, she’ll share her story in Lafayette along with excerpts from her newest book, “7 Lessons from Heaven: How Dying Taught Me to Live a Joy Filled Life”. Dr. Neal will speak next Wednesday at the UL Lafayette Student Union as the Lourdes Foundation Lenten Speaker.\n\nYvette Davis, development officer for the Lourdes Foundation, said speakers and topics for the series are chosen to fit with the Lenten period of self-reflection and offer ideas on self-improvement, as well as ascertaining what God is calling his followers to do.\n\n“This whole event is to help hone in on that and to make people aware we are all called to do that work. What are we supposed to be doing, what are our gifts? How are we supposed to be using them for the glory of God?”\n\nThe series was born in 2013 as a way to connect the community with the foundation’s mission to provide health outreach to those most in need – the poor, children, and elderly in our community.\n\nTwenty years ago, Neal had no idea that life would take her on this spiritual journey.\n\nAn experienced kayaker, she went over a drop on the Rio Fuy in Chile and the front end of her boat became pinned in the rocks. She experienced the sensation of her spirit rising up out of the river where was greeted by a group of beings who were overjoyed to welcome her while at the same time she could see the scene on the riverbank where her friends were trying to revive her.\n\nHer encounter with Christ, her miraculous survival and what’s she learned from the experience taught her to put absolute trust in God.\n\nNeal says she hopes those in the audience will leave with the determination to find their own way to absolute trust – minus the whole near-death experience.\n\n“The message is that of a challenge of trying to find God’s presence and handprint in your own life and, in doing so, collect the evidence to choose to trust, because trusting God’s promises really is what allows each and every one of us to live in a state of joy every day, every moment, regardless of our circumstances.”\n\nDavis said Neal’s topic and popularity led to her being invited to back to Lafayette for a third time. The event has become so popular, it’s outgrown the hospital’s conference center and will be held at the UL Lafayette Student Union-Atchafalaya Ballroom this year.\n\nLearn the full story of Neal’s physical and spiritual journey by purchasing tickets for the Lenten event on March 7th.
