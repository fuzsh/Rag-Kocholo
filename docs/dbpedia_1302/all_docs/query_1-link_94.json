        "text": "The Truman Historical Association is a nonprofit group collecting and preserving artifacts from Truman’s 100+ years of history. Association meetings are first Thursday each month at 7:00 PM. Meetings are held at the Museum (address below). Their annual meeting is held in May, and membership is $10.\n\nThe historical association operates the Truman Historical Museum, located at 109 West Ciro Street. Phone 507.776.7889. Scheduled hours are Fridays 1:00 – 4:00 PM. The museum will also open by appointment for tours and classroom visits. Donations are always appreciated and much needed to continue operation.\n\nA chronological history of Truman is also available for your perusal. Below is Truman’s first 100 years in a narrative form or for a year-by-year review.\n\nTruman, Minnesota\n\nTruman is located on the north central edge of Martin County in Westford Township, Minnesota. The first settlement in the township was established in 1857 along Elm Creek. In 1862, many of the settlements in the area were burned during an Indian uprising, but many residents soon returned to rebuild their homes and farms.\n\nWith the building of the Jackson road from Winnebago to Jackson in 1865, more of the area was opened up for settlement. Two post offices were soon established in the area. One was located near a river ford, and was designated as the West Ford post office, hence the name Westford, after which the township was eventually named.\n\nIn 1873 and 1874, grasshoppers devastated area crops, causing many to abandon their farms and leave the area. By 1878, nearly three out of every four farms was vacant or abandoned.\n\nIn 1878, an east-west railroad was built crossing the county, and settlers once again flowed into the region, reclaiming the abandoned farms and planting new fields across the vast prairies. Another rush of settlement occurred with the opening of the north-south railroad in 1899.\n\nBorn of the Railroad\n\nThe city of Truman was born with the railroad. The farmers of Westford Township were prosperous, enjoying rich harvests as a result of the area’s fertile soil and mild climate. The nearest rail station, however, was a distant 12 to 18 miles away, a hard days travel for farmers with nothing but a horse team and wagon.\n\nThe railroad companies of the time were looking for more business, and the area of Westford seemed an ideal prospect. A rail line ran east-west through Fairmont, but the nearest north-south rail link to Minneapolis and St. Paul only ran as far as Madelia.\n\nOn January 16, 1899, the Watonwan Valley Railway Company was incorporated for the purpose of building a railroad from Madelia to Fairmont.\n\nSurvey work for the new railroad was completed during the winter of 1898-1899. On March 23, 1899, the Martin County Independent reported that a meeting was held at the Westford postmasters home to locate a site for mid-line depot.\n\nConflict arose between Antrim farmers, who wanted the depot located on the county line between Martin and Watonwan Counties, and farmers from Westford and Nashville, who wanted it located several miles to the south. Finally, a compromise was reached that placed the site of the new depot would be located on the south section of line 4 in Westford Township, extending north.\n\nFinal selection of the site was left up to the railroad company, which selected section 9, adjacent to section 4. Truman was named when the town was surveyed in the spring of 1899.\n\nName Origin\n\nThe actual derivation of the name Truman has been the subject of much controversy over the years.\n\nAccording to Liva Haycraft Dodge, who wrote a short history of the town in the Fairmont Daily Sentinel, in 1937, the town was named after Truman Whited, one of the town’s original surveyors, and that Ciro Street, Truman’s main street, is actually Oric spelled backwards, and is also the name of one of the Truman’s surveyors.\n\nMost writers and residents, however, believe that the town was named after Truman Clark, son of J. T. Clark, who was second vice-president of the Chicago-St.Paul-Minneapolis Omaha Railway at the time the town was surveyed.\n\nNot everyone was pleased with the name selection. As Nondie Ploom, a reporter for the Martin County Sentinel wrote at the time, The name of the station in our town should have been Westford instead of Truman, as the township and post office already bear that name. However, the name Truman remained.\n\nOn April 20, 1899, the Martin County Independent reported that dirt has commenced to fly. The railroad has boarding tents and shanties scattered between (Fairmont) and Madelia.\n\nA month later, bidding was held for lots in the newly surveyed town of Truman. Over 300 people attended, and they bought $10,000 worth of land in the original 20 plotted blocks. The highest price paid was $46.00 from Clark of Granada State Bank, a handsome sum of money in those days.\n\nBuilding Boom\n\nThe ink was scarcely dry on the deeds when building began. Several men had already made plans for business establishments. All through the wet spring and summer wagons hauled loads of lumber from Madelia and Winnebago. The first building to be completed was a barn, where Bert Parks lived while he was building the Hinton Store.\n\nBy the middle of June, 1899, there were four commercial buildings underway: Richard Jones’ hardware store (24 by 80 feet), Hinton’s general merchandise store, a restaurant, and a hotel. Several residents were also underway including those of John Betts, Ed Calley, and Art Langman.\n\nRailroad Service\n\nThroughout the summer, work continued on the railroad. The first trains came through during the third week of October, 1899. Soon there were two trains daily to and from Minneapolis and St. Paul, so that one could leave for Minneapolis on the morning train, shop or do business there, and return on the evening train.\n\nThe completion of the railroad eased the burdens of area farmers, who no longer had to haul their crops so many miles to the depot.\n\nIn order to provide complete service from Fairmont to Minneapolis, the Watonwan Valley Railway was affiliated with the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Omaha Railway. On December 14, 1899, the owners of the WVR sold their interest to the CSPMOR.\n\nFour years later, the CSPMOR was acquired by the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. They owned the line for many years, until the tracks were removed in the early 1970’s and the line was abandoned.\n\nIncorporation\n\nIn its early years Truman boomed. By February 1900 there were over 214 inhabitants. Businessmen came from all directions to establish their enterprises. On march 29, 1900, a special election was held to incorporate the town, with 65 voting to incorporate, and 10 opposing incorporation\n\nThe newly incorporated town occupied a full squire mile, plus a strip of land 40 rods wide around section 9. Later, much of this land was returned to the township under the provisions of a Minnesota law.\n\nThe president of the first town council was F. Gleason. Council members included E. E. Fletcher, E. Noonan, and R. D. Parks. The first treasurer was N. T. True, and the first recorder (clerk) was R. G. Vandrey. D. Hadley and C. Cornell were Justices of the Peace, and H. Fuller and W. L. Hoover were town constables.\n\nOne of the first actions of the town Council was to give the town a touch of respectability by building permanent sidewalks. (Up until this time, planks scattered on the ground had served the purpose of keeping pedestrians out of the mud.)\n\nTruman Business\n\nWithout the merchants, however, there would be no Truman as we know it today. Two general stores were completed in Truman by the end of 1899, owned by W. A. Hinton and the Vandrey brothers of Madelia.\n\nThe Vandrey brothers had a store in Madelia, and decided to open another in Truman. They came to Truman in lumber wagons, and spent many nights sleeping in them, because there were no rooms available in the few buildings that had already been built. A third general store was later opened by D. Damon Company of Winnebago.\n\nHardware stores also flourished. Richard Jones, a country storekeeper, moved into town and built one in the summer of 1899. Edward Noonan of Madelia also built a hardware store, but soon sold it to August Ebert, who operated it for many years. A. A. Williams and Merril built and owned the third hardware store.\n\nWilliams first bought grain and sold farm implements. With the coming of the elevators, Williams switched to selling just hardware. Several years later, Jones sold out to Ebert and Williams, who split the merchandise.\n\nOne of the big unofficial holidays of the newly formed town was the annual Twine Day sponsored by Williams and Merril Hardware. At harvest time, all the farmers would come to town to pick up twine for the grain harvest.\n\nThere was a band, and plenty of strawberry pop for all the kids. Williams and Merril also took the opportunity to demonstrate the Majestic Range stove. One year they baked a three-tier walking cake. After being baked, it was wrapped in butcher paper, and a clean plank was laid across it. About six women stood on the cake, and then it was unwrapped and served with coffee to all who were present.\n\nHotels & Saloons\n\nDuring the early years, Truman was host to two large hotels, the Pioneer Hotel, owned by M. H. Clemons, and the City Hotel and restaurant, owned by M. E. Wallace. Competition was fierce between them. In those days, a room cost a dollar a day. A third hotel was constructed in 1905. Known as the Truman Hotel, it was operated by Charles Eickhoff.\n\nThe first saloon was owned by Charley Becker. Charley’s first application to the county commissioners to pen a saloon was rejected, but he persisted and finally won approval. His success was short-lives, however, as a fire destroyed the saloon in July 1902. Charley was killed in this fire when he went back in to try and salvage something. It was Truman’s first fire.\n\nTruman’s second saloon was the Sliding Mirror, owned by C. F. Cadman. A third saloon opened in 1905 in the new Truman Hotel.\n\nFarmers Elevators\n\nTruman’s prosperity, born of the railroad, depended on the farmers for its sustenance. Within the first year, three elevators were erected: The Hubbard and Palmer (Harry Fuller, manager), Truman Elevator and Flour Exchange (Christensen and Henderson), and the Wolhueter Elevator Company of Fairmont.\n\nIn the spring of 1903, Sam Bursell, a farmer who lived three miles east of Truman, hauled a load of barley to Winnebago. He was paid 58 cents per bushel for it. The next day, he took a load out of the same bin on his farm and hauled it to Truman, where he was offered 50 cents per bushel. Sam refused to sell his barley at that price to any of the three Truman elevators, and threatened to haul it all to Winnebago. Finally, one of the elevators offered to pay him the Winnebago price.\n\nBursell told his friend, I. C. Gilman about the barley sale. Gilman suggested that they meet with other area farmers and start a farmers elevator company. Fifteen farmers met and organized a farmers elevator company, selling shares of stock in the proposed elevator for $15 per share. $2,100 was collected from 145 area farmers, and Truman Farmer’s Elevator Company was born.\n\nThe first board of directors was comprised of L. A. Smith, S. Bursell, J. Robinson, J. Miracle, M. Helvig, M. Olson, W. Ryder, and P. Sieg. Smith was elected as the first president, and Bursell as secretary-treasurer.\n\nBecause of the three elevators already in town, the railroad was initially reluctant to grant an easement on any railroad right-of-way, necessary for the construction of a new elevator. Persistence paid off, however, and the railroad finally leased the new company the land where the main elevator sits today.\n\nA Minneapolis man was hired to construct the elevator for about $3,000. It was completed in time for the 1903 harvest. The new farmers co-op elevator was a success from the start. Soon the Farmers Elevator Company bought out the Wolhueter Company and expanded its operations.\n\nOver the years, the Truman Farmers Elevator has grown and is today, with several operating divisions and enterprises, one of the largest commercial firms in Martin County.\n\nThe main livestock buyer in early Truman was L. A. Dodge, who shipped via the railroad. In 1929, trucks were introduced for hauling livestock, and Dodge’s son, S. E. Dodge, opened a large stockyard and sales pavilion north of town, away from the railroad. It still stands today, and is a buying station for the John Morrell Company. (Since this story was written, the sales barn has been torn down but the site remains a buying station.)\n\nIn 1900 a creamery was moved to Truman from Darin Pesta’s farm in Nashville Center. In 1929, area dairymen decided to form a co-op and purchased it.\n\nBanking\n\nThe first bank in Truman was the Truman State Bank, with N. T. True as cashier. Two years later, in 1902, the Truman National Bank was started by A. L. Ward, a wealthy Fairmont businessman, with cashiers Jim Arms and Gus Seaberg.\n\nPeoples State Bank was founded in 1916 by a group of eight investors. Three banks in a town of 752 were too many, and in 1920, the State Bank and the National Bank merged to form the Truman National Bank. In 1946, the National Bank and Peoples State Bank merged under the name of Peoples State Bank of Truman, as it continued to be known until 2003.\n\nIn 2003, Peoples State Bank merged with the Martin County National Bank. As a result of this merger, Profinium Financial established its’ headquarters in Truman and maintained a branch in Fairmont near the courthouse.\n\nOver the years, many stores and businesses have come and gone. In the early years, some of the more notable or longer-lived included a clothing and shoe store run by Stockman and Julius Kaiser, druggists Dr. Donaldson and W. L. Hoover, barbers Clarence Cornell and A. C. Metzgar, jeweler Charles Cummer, Hecht Brothers Meat Market, Catlin and Wolf groceries, Ward Machine Company, harness shops owned by F. W. Altenberg, Leo Gieriet, Rudy Weinkauf, W. E. Teskey, and H. Vosberg, a livery barn operated by J. D. Herrick and son, blacksmiths Ike K. Scribner (who sold it to August Zenk) and Elmer E. Fletcher, and lumber yards run by Ruge Gleason, Weyerhauser Lumber, and Lam Lumber.\n\nDad Young was the early undertaker and furniture dealer for many years. He sold out to C. A. Baker, who in turn sold out to his son-in-law, E. E. Olson. Olson Furniture Company, as it is was known is now torn down. And the Olson Funeral Home is now under the operation today as the Zaharia Family Funeral and Cremation Service.\n\nIn the early years, Truman was fortunate to have a good photographer. In those days, photography was a specialized occupation, with large heavy cameras and accessories. Photographers did their own developing and printing with materials and chemicals that were often temperamental. Still, they turned out beautiful and often timeless work.\n\nFamily portrait-taking was a big event, and regularly practiced. In those days, travel was arduous and difficult, and portraits often took the place of visits to distant relatives. An enterprising and competent photographer could easily make a comfortable living. G. E. Burnett was Truman’s first resident photographer. He was in business only a few months when he sold out to C. D. Caulkins and moved away. Caulkins, however, liked the town and stayed for many years.\n\nTruman’s first doctor was Dr. A. F. Hunte. For the first few months he commuted to Truman on his bicycle from Granada several times a week – a distance of 13 miles, over roads that only barely existed! In 1900, Dr. Hunte moved to Truman, and practiced there until 1930.\n\nTelephone & Post Office\n\nR. D. Armstrong built Truman’s first telephone exchange in 1899. In 1909 there was a terrible blizzard which caused over $2,000 damage to the telephone lines. Most of the lines on the main street were down, and in replacing them, the poles were relocated to the alleys, which improved the appearance of the streets.\n\nTruman’s first post office operated out of Hinton’s store, much like the contract post offices of today. Mail was brought in from the Westford Post Office and distributed.\n\nIn December 1899, the Westford post office was moved to Truman. George W. Sprague was Postmaster. Rural delivery was started in November 1900, and included 25 miles, 144 homes, and 648 persons. A carried received $500 a year at that time.\n\nNo small town is complete without its newspaper. Truman’s first newspaper was started in January 1900 by W. R. Estes of Madelia, who would send a reported once a week to Truman to gather the news. A. E. Brough was the editor of this paper which came out every Friday and cost $1.50 per year.\n\nApparently the Martin County Sentinel did not appreciate the new newspaper, and editorially attacked the new Truman Tribune.\n\nThe Martin County Independent came to defense of the Tribune, stating: It is to be regretted that the 23 year old Sentinel should make such a bitter attack on the just-born Truman Tribune. Calling names, imperging the honesty of others, is the worst side of journalism. We are of the belief that the attack was made in the absence of Editor Day by some of the young men of the office. The Independent looks for an apology for the language used by that paper to its young member of the fraternity.\n\nWhether the apology was ever delivered is not known. Two months later the Tribune was sold to E. N. Disney. He edited the paper for a year and a half before selling to Lawrence Doolittle. In 1906, Doolittle sold the paper to Frank Whiteney who ran it for a number of years.\n\nSince that time the paper has changed hands several times, but is still published once a week. Its most recent owners have included George Almen, Don & Martha (Almen) Peterson, and Vickie & Rick Greiner.\n\nChurches\n\nFive churches were organized in Truman before 1905. The first was the Methodist Episcopal with Rev. Hayes as minister. Next was the German Lutheran with Rev. Ahl as pastor. St. Paul’s Lutheran was organized under the direction of Rev. Roloff in the fall of 1899, but Rev. H. H. Heinemann served it for many years beginning in 1900.\n\nA Baptist Church was also organized in 1900 under the leadership of Rev. Reeves who preached hell, fire, and brimstone. The Church of Christ was organized in about 1905. A dispute over baptism split the church, with part of the congregation leaving to form a new Church of Christ.\n\nSchool\n\nTruman’s first school was completed in December 1900. Before this, the lower grades were taught by Miss Lottie Betts in the Methodist Church. The upper grades attended a small country school taught by Mr. Schuyler C. Pew.\n\nMr. Pew later became the first principal of the Truman Schools. In 1901 all eight grades were moved into the new brick building in Truman. The new building contained four classrooms and office space, and was located on the present school site. The new school was under the supervision of Ethyle Webster. All eight grades were instructed, with two grades per classroom. The first school board consisted of six members: J. H. Atkinson, Dr. A. F. Hunte, A. E. Wilson, C. C. Donaldson, C. C. Poole, and I. Brownlee.\n\nIn 1912 a six-room addition was erected and a high school course included in the curriculum. In 1913, Edward Olson finished Truman’s 4 year high school program as its first graduate, and the only graduate for that year. The following year three graduates, Elizabeth Lewis, William Poole, and Dennis Spencer completed the four-year program.\n\nBy 1921 the school had grown to 243 pupils and 11 teachers. The next 19 years saw little growth, as in 1940 there were still only 11 teachers and 243 pupils. The original 1900 building was demolished in 1935 and a large high school wing added to the 1912 building.\n\nEarly in the 1950’s a statewide trend toward rural school consolidation made it necessary to add an elementary wing. This wing included six classrooms, a music room, and an elementary gymnasium. The cost for this addition was approximately $100,000. Local residents voted a $30,000 bond to help pay for construction of the new wing, with the balance paid for with state education department building funds.\n\nIn 1959, two new high school wings and an industrial arts building were added, with one wing including a new heating plant for the whole school, lunch kitchen, dining room, and storage space. The other two-story classroom wing included administrative offices, a commercial department, a visual aids room, library, teachers’ room, six classrooms, a three-room home economics department, two science classrooms, an art room, industrial arts facilities, and toilet facilities. The cost for this new facility was $796,000. Enrollment that year stood at nearly 725, with 35 faculty.\n\nPublic Works\n\nFrom the beginning, Truman provided many public conveniences to its residents. The water works system was built in 1903. It had a pressure system in which air and water were pumped into a huge pressure tank housed in a building. It was not until 1928 that the water tower was constructed, providing natural gravity flow pressure to the system.\n\nAlso in 1903, gas lighting was installed on main street. This was finally replaced in 1916 when electricity was brought to town by the Madelia Electric Company.\n\nThree years later the Interstate Power Company took over supplying power to the town. However, their service was so undependable that in 1938 residents built their own power plant. The plant continues to serve today as a backup generator, with most power being purchased less expensively from the interstate power grid.\n\nIn the 1930’s, in the height of the depression, the city council decided to pave the main street. The $28,000 price tag was substantial for the times, but the project engineer said it was probably the most inexpensive job of paving done in Martin County.\n\nSocial Life\n\nTruman has long enjoyed a varied and diverse social life. A Democratic Club was organized early with I. C. Gilman, C. C. Poole, and N. T. True as officers. A Prohibition Club was organized by W. E. Cooper, Mrs. M. J. Young, and Mrs. Donaldson.\n\nFor those who enjoyed secret societies, there were four: The Truman Lodge I.O.O.F., the Sunrise Rebekah Lodge, the Truman Camp M.W.A., and the Truman Lodge M.B.A.\n\nTruman also boasted a good baseball team, which played regularly with neighboring towns. In 1902 the first band was formed with W. E. Wallace as director. It was called the Truman Concert Band and provided entertainment at many of Truman’s social functions. Other entertainment included turkey shoots and dances.\n\nIn 1902 the first plays came to Brownlee’s Opera House. One of the first productions was Old Maid’s Companion. The first theater opened its doors in 1913 with the showing of silent movies. Talking pictures were first shown at the Cozy Theatre in 1929.\n\nThe first child born in Truman was Florene Jones, daughter of Mrms. Richard Jones. The first automobile was a red two-seater with no top or windshield, and was owned by Harry Fuller. Residents described it as a one-lung Cadillac.\n\nThe second car, a Hudson, was owned by S. S. Rector and was called the Truman Lily. At that time almost anyone who owned an automobile became an agent. Soon almost anyone who wanted to elevate their social standing was buying a car.\n\nThe first automobile accident occurred on July 22, 193, when Tony Hoover raised so much dust that the car it passed (with H. G. G\\Catlin and Rev. A. L. Hill and their families as passengers) ran into a ditch and turned over. (No one was hurt, but the car was totally wrecked.)\n\nProhibition was voted in Truman in 1911. Also in 1911, Herman Hanson, or Dad Hanson, as he was familiarly called, went into the ice business. He got himself a two-wheel car that would hold about four 100-pound ice blocks, and hauled it from house to house selling ice for people’s ice boxes.\n\nIce was cut out of Perch lake in the winter, and packed in sawdust in an ice house located in the back lot of the Hanson Saloon. Those who didn’t have ice boxes kept their milk and perishables in pails or large kettles suspended in wells or cisterns, or in cool cellars.\n\nGeorge Foster owned the first mechanical cooler or ice machine in town, and had the first soda fountain and ice cream parlor in his drug store.\n\nHis mechanical cooler had one major drawback, however. It functioned by compressing ammonia, and often the safety valve on the compressor would malfunction, releasing ammonia gas into the store. The store would have to be completely aired out, which was hard on business, especially if it happened on Saturday night when the ten booths in the store were usually filled with customers eating sundaes, malts, and sodas.\n\nFor most of the years that George Foster had the drug store, he also carried a full line of jewelry, and employed a watchmaker.\n\nIn the early days, the building now occupied by Olson Furniture was occupied by Ward Implement Company, and was managed by Hiram Jennings.\n\nThe second floor was a big hall, known as Ward’s Hall. In this hall a dance orchestra, Pearson’s Band, put on dances every Thursday night.\n\nAt midnight on those nights, everyone would go across the street to the hotel run by Dan Ross for coffee and pie or cake, and would then go back up to the Hall for more dancing until 2 a.m. The public dances in Ward’s Hall were like a big weekly party, as everybody was acquainted with everybody else, friends, relatives, and neighbors.\n\nTruman today continues to change and adapt itself for the future. The railroad and many of Truman’ once-thriving businesses are gone, fallen victim to declining farm populations, migration to the cities, the automobile, superhighways, and regional shopping centers.\n\nYet, as always, Truman’s real wealth lies in the energy, tenacity, and vision of its residents. Born of the railroad and raised on the farms, Truman continues to reach toward the future as a community of caring, supportive neighbors, a rural survivor.\n\nYear-by-Year Timeline\n\n1857 – The first settlement in Westford Township was established along Elm Creek.\n\n1862 – Many settlements were burned in an Indian uprising.\n\n1865 – Jackson road was built from Winnebago to Jackson.\n\n1873 and 1874 – Grasshoppers destroyed the crops.\n\n1879 – Watonwan Valley Railroad Co. Was incorporated for the purpose of building a railroad from Madelia to Fairmont. School District #77 began in a farm home.\n\n1880 – The School district was established. Lots were sold to a townsite company and Truman was laid out. A meeting was held at P. M. Loose’s in Westford for the purpose of locating a site for a depot on the railroad. A lot was purchased for $40 for the depot and the first train came through Truman later that year.\n\n1899 – By the end of 1899, two general stores were completed; they were the W. A. Hinton store and Vandrey’s store. Dr. August Hunte from Granada rode his bike 14 miles several times a week before he moved to Truman as the first permanent physician; he stayed 30 years. He also saw the first train pull into town. The Westford Post Office was moved to Truman in December.\n\n1900 – A special election was held for the purpose of incorporating a village; the vote was 65 in favor and 10 against it. Otto Graf donated land for a public school. The town’s census was 214. Truman State Bank was established with N. T. True as cashier. R. O. Armstrong built a telephone exchange. A rural delivery for mail was started in November which included 25 miles, 144 homes and 648 persons; a carrier received $500/year for his services. Truman’s newspaper was started in January by W. J. R. Estes of Madelia; it cost $1.50 per year.\n\n1900 – 1905 – Churches, including the Methodist, the German Lutheran affiliated with the Ohio Synod, Baptist, St. Paul’s Lutheran, the church of Christ, were established.\n\n1901 – Otto Graf donated land for a city park which bears his name. Three elevators were erected: The Hubbard and Palmer; Truman Elevator and Flour Exchange, and the Wolhueter Elevator Co. of Fairmont.\n\n1902 – Charley Becker’s Saloon, the first in Truman, was destroyed by fire.
