        "text": "From the frontlines, families apply timeless faith in Parent Compass—the Telly Award-winning Christian television series.\n\nAcross episodes, with differing issues and a variety of backgrounds, in Parent Compass mothers and fathers talk about their own upbringings and pasts, marriage and life management, child rearing–and faith . . . all with undaunted candor.\n\nFamilies featured in Parent Compass range from the Pitts, whose four daughters include Alena, the child star of the hit movie, WAR ROOM . . . to Mark and Shanell Rusk, raising a blended family of 11 in a Habitat for Humanity home they helped build. Audiences will meet the Kos, teaching fine art and raising kids out of one suburban home, and single mom Cindy, who initially three times scheduled an abortion for her now seven-year-old daughter.\n\nA Compass through the struggles of life, in Parent Compass real families share life stories of how God and His Word give direction.\n\nParent Compass Founder & President Natalie Jones, a mother of five, knows this one-of-a-kind series offers the hope we need. “Families now have true stories of God’s peace amidst endless difficulties,” she said.\n\nIn addition to signature family episodes, are Life & Family Chats with Christian leaders. Hear from: Kendrick Brothers, producers of movies, Overcomer, War Room; Erwin Brothers and Kevin Downes, producers of movies I Can Only Imagine, Woodlawn; Ann & Dave Wilson, Host of CRU’s Family Life replacing Dennis & Barbara Rainey; Jonathan Evans, Chaplain of the Dallas Cowboys and son of Dr. Tony Evans; Anne Graham Lotz, Billy Graham's daughter; Benham Brothers; Kay Arthur; Ryan Dobson, Jim Dobson's son and former Host Family Talk; John Fuller, Focus on the Family Co-Host and more.\n\nExperience the power of God."
