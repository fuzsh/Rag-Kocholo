        "text": "An 1894 biography of St. Francis of Assisi was a milestone in the lives of two young urban missionaries. They were “Sisters of the People” at the dynamic and progressive Wesleyan Methodist West London Mission in Soho, a poor and overcrowded central London district. Sister Mary Neal and Sister Emmeline Pethick would eventually distinguish themselves nationally, Emmeline as a militant suffragist in tandem with her husband Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, and later as a feminist and peace activist; Mary as a music educator and folklorist. French protestant clergyman Paul Sabatier's scholarly but lyrical biography of Francis enthralled the mission's leaders, including the superintendent, Hugh Price Hughes. Francis's rejection of his family's wealth, his insistence on absolute poverty for himself and his followers, and his devotion to the poor presented a compelling model of Christian service, one that the two young Sisters found especially exciting. They resigned the Sisterhood in 1895 to live cheaply in workers' housing just north of their old turf. This decision launched them into a national community of Franciscan-inspired settlers, philanthropists, “simple livers,” and collective farmers—offering us a new perspective on fin de siècle social activism.\n\n2 Neither woman has been the subject of a real biography. Their autobiographies are: Pethick-Lawrence, Emmeline, My Part in a Changing World (London: Victor Gollancz, 1938)Google Scholar; and Mary Neal, As a Tale That is Told, unpublished manuscript (London: Cecil Sharp House). Neal also published two autobiographical essays: “The Broken Law,” Adelphi 3rd ser., 16 (January 1940): 147–150Google Scholar; and “A Victorian Childhood,” Adelphi 16 (April 1940): 278–286Google Scholar. The first of the Adelphi articles is an attempt to comprehend the break between her and Cecil Sharp that thwarted Mary's promising career in folk dance. Neal's great grandniece, Lucy Neal, OBE, curates an excellent and expanding website and accompanying program devoted both to Neal's biography, and to music and dance education in the present: http://maryneal.org. On Neal and Cecil Sharp, see note 180 below.\n\nOn Pethick, there is strikingly little. Harrison, Brian in Prudent Revolutionaries: Portraits of British Feminists between the Wars (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987)Google Scholar includes a detailed chapter on the Pethick-Lawrences, which says relatively little about Emmeline's years at the WLM, or about her political life after suffrage. Brittain, Vera's biography of Fred (Pethick-Lawrence: A Portrait [London: Allen & Unwin], 1963)Google Scholar has a few pages on Emmeline's life before she and Lawrence met in 1899 and on the Pethick-Lawrences' meeting and marriage. Also: Balshaw, June, “Sharing the Burden: The Pethick-Lawrences and Women's Suffrage,” in The Men's Share? Masculinities, Male Support and Women's Suffrage in Britain, 1890–1920, ed. Eustance, Claire and John, Angela V. (Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge, 1997), 135–157Google Scholar.\n\n3 The main sources for this study are the mission's voluminous publications: Advance!, the mission's monthly illustrated magazine of about thirty pages; Hughes's detailed annual reports; books by mission members; accounts of the mission in the general press; the generous coverage of the Sisters in the Methodist Times; and autobiographies by each woman, Mary's unpublished. Correspondence between Mary Neal and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence has not yet been found. Many of the Pethick-Lawrence papers were destroyed after Emmeline's death by Fred and his second wife, the former Helen Cragg, a fellow suffragist. Some of these might have provided useful material on the period before their marriage; the material that disappeared included the manuscript version of Emmeline's autobiography, which was much longer than the published version. See Brittain, Vera, Pethick-Lawrence: A Portrait (London: George Allen & Unwin, 1963)Google Scholar, 8. The correspondence between Fred and Emmeline in the early years of their relationship, from 1899, does survive, partly in digital form, at Trinity College, Cambridge.Though mission publications were written for a national Methodist clientele and aimed at fund raising and sustaining the mission's prestige, their sheer variety gives them considerable credibility. Mary and Emmeline were frequent, and sometimes candid and self-revealing, contributors to Advance!. Hughes and the staff members he appointed as editors of Advance! appear to have exercised relatively light censorship. The exclamation point in the title was dropped in 1897 when the newsletter resumed publication after a break of over a year—and indeed the magazine was more lackluster after Mary and Emmeline's departure. Mission publications gain credibility as historical sources because they are extremely numerous and have a variety of authors, editors, and purposes. The Sisters are also frequently documented in contemporary newspapers and periodicals.\n\n5 The peak in number, 40, was reached in 1894; 25 or 30 were more usual. A handful of the Sisters were Anglicans in the 1890s, according to Mary Edith Gresham (Sister Edith), one of the founding Sisters, who was herself an Anglican. Mary Edith Gresham, interview by Edward Aves, January 1898, Harvester Microfiche, Reel 68, B242, Charles Booth Manuscripts Collection, London School of Economics Archive Division, 202–225. She believed that she was the only Sister whose “call” was “a social one, rather than for the saving of souls.” Labour and Life of the People of London, photocopy of Microfilm Reel 68, B242, Johns Hopkins University Library, Baltimore, Md.\n\n16 The pioneering studies of middle-class women as urban explorers stressed the novelty and excitement, along with the dangers, offered by slum observation or service. See Vicinus, Martha, Independent Women: Work and Community for Single Women, 1850–1920 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985)Google Scholar; Nord, Deborah E., Walking the Victorian Streets; Women, Representation, and the City (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1995)Google Scholar; and Walkowitz, Judith, City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual Danger in Late-Victorian London (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992)Google Scholar. For further discussion of the motives of women as slummers, see Koven, Slumming, 2004, ch. 5; Ross, Ellen, ed., Slum Travelers: Ladies and London Poverty, 1860–1920 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007), 1–39Google Scholar; and Mahood, Linda, Feminism and Voluntary Action: Eglantyne Jebb and Save the Children, 1876-1928 (Houndmills, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009)Google Scholar. A recent variation on slummers highlights exchanges among women philanthropists, and between philanthropists and their clients as in Rappaport, Jill, Giving Women: Alliance and Exchange in Victorian Culture (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012)Google Scholar; and Koven, Seth's The Match Girl and the Heiress (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2014)Google Scholar. Heretofore I will use the term “slummers,” which originated in the era under discussion, with implied quotation marks. The phenomenon itself and the term are discussed fully by Seth Koven, introduction to Slumming, 2004.\n\n34 Ibid., 16. Booth pointed out in his Third Series that few of the Soho and Fitzrovia poor attended the Sunday service at St. James's Hall. While some young workers “employed in the great shops” were among the Sunday congregants, most came from outside of the district. Thus the mission actually did little to remedy “the spiritual destitution of West Central London,” in Booth's opinion. See Booth, Charles, Life and Labour of the People in London, 3rd ser, vol. 2 (London: Macmillan, 1902), 194–195Google Scholar.\n\n35 Percy Alden, warden of Mansfield House settlement in Canning Town, uses this term in his entry in Mudie-Smith, Richard's, Religions Life of London (London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1904)Google Scholar, 42. Such churches were common from the 1880s. See McLeod, Hugh, “Thews and Sinews: Nonconformity and Sport,” in Modern Christianity and Cultural Aspirations, eds. Bebbington, David. W. and Larsen, Timothy (London: Sheffield Academic, 2003), 28–46Google Scholar. See also Erdozain, Dominic's highly skeptical discussion of this approach, The Problem of Pleasure: Sport, Recreation and the Crisis of Victorian Religion (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 2010), 191–198Google Scholar. William Booth of the Salvation Army championed social services as ways of occupying the leisure time of the members, keeping them both from harm's way and from disputes over doctrine, which he saw as the “poison of hell.” See Phillips, Paul T., Kingdom on Earth: Anglo-American Social Christianity (State College: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006)Google Scholar, 179.\n\n131 Ibid., 97. Their names are not found in mission publications for many years. Later, Emmeline, now the wealthy and titled Lady Pethick-Lawrence, visited on significant WLM occasions, such as Katherine's many milestone birthdays. It appears that Advance! was not published in late 1895 and in 1896 as no copies could be found anywhere for these years. In the description of the social work of Cleveland Hall there is a reference to the Mothers Meeting suffering due to a “change of Sisters” (WLM annual report [1896–1897], 25).\n\n170 The Brotherhood's 1898 English translations of Tolstoy's What is Art? and The Christian Teachin g were important in extending Tolstoy's influence. See Holman, J. J. de K., “The Purleigh Colony and Togetherness in the Late 1890s,” in Tolstoi and Britain, ed. Jones, W. Gareth (Oxford: Berg, 1995), 135–150Google Scholar. One of the colonies, Whiteway, a breakaway group from Purleigh, still existed in the 1990s (147). See Diana Maltz's absorbing discussion of Whiteway and its relationship with C. R. Ashbee's “simple” Guild of Handicraft not far away: “Living by Design: C. R. Ashbee's Guild of Handicraft and Two English an Communities, 1897–1907,” Victorian Literature and Culture 39 (2011): 409–426Google Scholar.\n\n180 It was after Emmeline's departure that Mary Neal became more involved in teaching children English country songs, some having been collected by Cecil Sharpe. Eventually Neal began to popularize Morris dancing, her girls' club teaching the dances all over the country and performing them for paying audiences at London theaters. This is the part of Neal's life that is best known.
