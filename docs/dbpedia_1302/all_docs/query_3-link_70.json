Neal Md, To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story\n\n“You will find as you look back upon your life that the moments when you have really lived, are the moments when you have done things in a spirit of love.” —Henry Drummond”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story\n\n“Praying in faith is not an inner conviction that God will act according to our desires if only we believe hard enough. It involves believing that God will always respond to our prayers in accord with His nature, His purposes, and His promises.” —Alvin VanderGriend”\n\n― Mary C. Neal Md, To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story\n\n“When we choose to forgive, we choose to accept the depth of God’s love and grace for all people, acknowledging that there is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. It concedes that we cannot see the bigger picture of God’s intricate tapestry of life.”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, 7 Lessons from Heaven: How Dying Taught Me to Live a Joy-Filled Life\n\n“We are either in the process of resisting God’s truth or in the process of being shaped and molded by His truth.”\n\n― Mary C. Neal Md, To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story\n\n“What is dying?” he wrote. “I am standing on the seashore. A ship sails to the morning breeze and starts for the ocean. She is an object and I stand watching her until she fades from the horizon and someone at my side says, ‘She is gone!’ Gone where? Gone from my sight, that is all. Her diminished size and loss of sight is in me, not in her. And just at the moment when someone at my side says, ‘She is gone!’ there are others who are watching her coming, gladly shouting, ‘Here she comes!’—and that is dying.”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, 7 Lessons from Heaven: How Dying Taught Me to Live a Joy-Filled Life\n\n“As Albert Einstein famously said, “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, 7 Lessons from Heaven: How Dying Taught Me to Live a Joy-Filled Life\n\n“Bill and I were surprised to find that a predominant emotion during the first year was fear. Fear that we would never emerge from the emotional fog. Fear that we would never again be able to experience joy. Fear that we would fail our remaining children. Fear that we would forget. I think much of the fear and anxiety we felt was just fear of an unknown future that would not include the son that we loved so dearly. Someone told me, “When you love with all that you have, you grieve with all that you are,” and I would certainly agree with this observation.”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, To Heaven and Back: A Doctor's Extraordinary Account of Her Death, Heaven, Angels, and Life Again: A True Story\n\n“The choice to hang on to bitterness and anger may feel virtuous but has a destructive nature. As the wise theologian Lewis Smedes said, “When we attach our feelings to the moment when we were hurt, we endow it with immortality. And we let it assault us every time it comes to mind. It travels with us, sleeps with us, hovers over us while we make love, and broods over us while we die. Our hate does not even have the decency to die when those we hate die—for it is a parasite sucking our blood, not theirs. There is only one remedy for it; forgiveness.”1”\n\n― Mary C. Neal, 7 Lessons from Heaven: How Dying Taught Me to Live a Joy-Filled Life"
