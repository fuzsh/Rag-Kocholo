But something happened as she shared her story in the years since. Not only did Neal realize she had more to tell, she discovered she had yet to answer the biggest question of all: How does knowing heaven is real change our lives on Earth?\n\n\"I have never finished speaking at a venue, including corporate settings, without people wanting to know more,\" says Dr. Neal. In 7 Lessons From Heaven, Neal takes readers deeper into her experience, which includes encounters with angels, a journey to a \"city of light,\" and what it was like to meet Jesus face-to-face.

She offers practical insights and inspiration for how each of us can experience this God every day and begin living without regret, worry, anxiety, or fear.\n\nNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In this inspired follow-up to the million-copy bestseller To Heaven and Back, Dr. Mary Neal (featured in the Netflix original series Surviving Death) shares untold stories about her encounters with Jesus and powerful insights about how the reality of heaven can make each day magnificent.\n\n“If you want practical ways to bring more of Heaven into your life today, Dr. Neal shows how.”—John Burke, pastor and author of New York Times bestseller Imagine Heaven\n\nTags: All Products, Inspirational"
