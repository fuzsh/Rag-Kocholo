        "text": "Votes for Women: A Timeline\n\n'Votes for Women' - a timeline about the suffragette movement and WSPU, compiled by Lyn Haill for the National Theatre’s programme for Rebecca Lenkiewicz’s play 'Her Naked Skin', Olivier Theatre, London 2008. www.nationaltheatre.org.uk\n\nAlso see for further information: Museum of London's website\n\n1832\n\nParliamentary Reform Act gives the vote to middle-class men in Britain, adding half a million to those already enfranchised, the landowners. The term ‘male person’ is included specifically in the wording, thus legally preventing women from voting in Parliamentary elections.\n\n1867\n\nSecond Reform Act gives the vote to about 2.5 million male householders, out of a total population of 22 million. John Stuart Mill, MP for Westminster, makes the first plea for women’s suffrage in Parliament.\n\n1884\n\nThe third Reform Act enfranchises 5 million men, about two thirds of the adult male population.
