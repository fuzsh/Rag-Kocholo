Born at home on the family farm near Keppel, Saskatchewan on February 15th,1925 Eileen was the last surviving member of her great generation, on both sides of the family. She is survived by sons Marshall (Kate Murray) and Craig (Penny Cutler) and grandchildren Kade, Erin, Dave and Maura. Eileen was predeceased by her parents Agnes and Bill, sisters Molly and Sheila, and brother Jack. Her husband of almost 50 years – Rupert – died in 1999. Eileen was a child of the Depression and the Prairie Dust Bowl. Educated in a one room schoolhouse, she left that school at 16 to work in a Toronto factory, as did so many other young women who helped mobilize a nation at war. She met Rupe on a Huntsville-bound ski train in 1947, and they wed in 1949, in Toronto, where they lived until moving to Huntsville, in 1968. Townspeople might have crossed paths with Eileen in one of the retail settings where she worked, but more likely at church, for Eileen bore witness to and lived her faith. Eileen was a wonderful and dedicated daughter, sister, wife, mother, and grandmother, for whom family was everything. A visitation with the family will take place at 12:00PM on Tuesday, December 21st at Faith Baptist Church, 169 West Road, Huntsville immediately preceding a service there at 1:00PM.

Our family wishes everyone a Merry Christmas, and a safe New Year.\n\nDavid Alexander Franks, philosopher, philanthropist, scientist, artist & author, was born in Toronto on July 23, 1959 to parents Alex & Vivian Franks (deceased). David was diagnosed with Type I Diabetes in 1963 at the age of 4 & was using a chemistry set to check his blood sugars before he started kindergarten. David passed away at home in Huntsville, in the early hours of December 16, 2021.\n\nDavid grew up in a loving home in Cooksville, where he made lifelong friends. He was an accomplished artist & won awards for painting & sculpture. He was proud & humbled to be accepted into the Polar Bear Dream Circle. He held many jobs, including makeup artistry for theatre & film and teaching physically disabled children. He also had a number of successful small businesses.\n\nDavid always enjoyed live theatre & concerts & shares many happy memories with Craig of shows at Rama & most recently the Rolling Stones at Oro-Medonte (last show before Covid). He was a student of film & could point out details others never noticed & quote dialogue. His extensive movie collection boasts many autographs including Sir Edmund Hillary, Jane Goodall & the original Star Trek crew (except McCoy).\n\nDavid married his soul-mate Susan September 28, 1991 & continued to live in Mississauga where they ran a video store. They later moved to Amaranth where David became a Master Gardener, having built an exceptional Zen garden & flower-lined pathways through their forest. David was elected a Councillor & ran Parks & Rec. He introduced soccer, coached T-Ball and Table Tennis & built a skating rink for the kids in winter. It was the 1st time Parks & Rec aver turned a profit. In 2002 he took a team to the Ontario Winter Games to compete in Table Tennis. He had a special kid’s handshake which endeared him & made him memorable to each child he met. Anywhere he went in town, he was greeted with “Hi Coach” by laughing kids wanting a shake. When Susan injured her arm in 2004, they sold their home, packed their Jeep & drove to Central America with their faithful black Lab Joy & were negotiating the purchase of a property in Panama when they learned Sue’s mom had been diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer. They immediately drove the almost 7,000 km back to Canada & nursed her during her final 9 months. During that time they searched for their new home & were delighted to buy property in Huntsville in July 2005. David’s extraordinary capacity for learning led him to study building methods & in 2006 designed & built his straw bale home. He most recently became interested in Quantum Physics & has a stack of “light” reading on that subject on his night stand.\n\nDavid always made an effort to learn people’s names & is well-known to the staff at the Independent, WalMart, Tims, McDonalds & Deerhurst for his uncanny memory, chivalry & politeness. He always waved to cars passing on the road when he was out walking his 3 Labs.\n\nIn 2011 following open heart surgery, he began writing & published his 1st book “Son of a Diabetic”. He had a love for story-telling, joined local writing groups & the Canadian Authors Association. He eventually started his own group in Huntsville & Dwight & was revered as a writing coach. Recognizing & embarrassed by the flaws in his 1st book attempt, he honed his craft & undertook a journey to a fly-in native reserve, writing a journal of his emotional time there. He published his book “30 Days in Attawapiskat” & was invited to share his experience at numerous presentations. He successfully raised awareness of the overwhelming issues facing indigenous communities. His one regret was not completing the geodesic dome greenhouse (partially constructed), meant to address food sovereignty on reserves & elsewhere. He also published a book of short stories, “D Tales” and was preparing to publish Volume 2.\n\nDavid passionately loved his life & lived it – skydiving, scuba diving, whitewater rafting, whale-watching, performed in 3 operas with the Canadian Opera Company, celebrated one New Year in Venezuela & another in Iceland, Oktoberfest in Munich, kissed the Blarney Stone in Ireland, rode a gondola in Venice, climbed 1000-year old Mayan ruins & the Eiffel Tower, swam with the dolphins in Mexico and slept at the foot of a live volcano in Costa Rica. He was thrilled meeting new people, experiencing new languages & cultures. David always tried to find the good in every situation & strived to help others do the same. He lived to bring light & cheer to his friends & at least a smile to everyone he met. He endeared himself to Susan’s Swiss & German cousins & they have already expressed their shock & heartfelt sorrow at his passing. David is survived by his one true love Susan – forever grateful for the time they shared. He will be missed by his sister Wendy Price (John), his brother Steven Franks (Dale) & will be fondly remembered by his niece, nephews, extended family & many friends. A veritable lifetime of memories will remain with his best friends Craig, Barry, Udo, Doug, Gary, LJ, Tony and so many more.\n\nThe family would like to express their appreciation to Barry Brear for his contribution of materials & Chris Smith for his generous time & expertise installing a 2nd handrail to allow David access to the house following the 5 days on life support & 3 week Orillia ICU stay in June. We’d also like to thank Dr. D. Johnstone for his many years of compassionate care & support, as well as the nephrologist team in Orillia. A heartfelt thank you to Megan, Virginia, Stacy, tall Cathy & the other nurses from ParaMed for their care this past year, Mufaro from Care Partners, the ProResp team, the Huntsville & Orillia ICU & Dialysis teams, the Huntsville Paramedics & Larry & Bill Mitchell for their calm & professional support.\n\nAt his request, David has been laid to rest in the Franks family plot in Streetsville Public Cemetery. A Celebration of Life is planned for the spring – please refer to mitchellfuneralhome.ca for updates.\n\nAs an expression of sympathy, memorial donations may be made to “People’s Food Institute” to support food sovereignty, “Water First” to support safe drinking water, the Canadian Wildlife Federation, or the Huntsville Hospital Foundation for the Dialysis unit.\n\nMiigwetch and Thank you. www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca\n\nBennett, William James\n\nJune 13, 1939-November 29,2021\n\nBill passed away peacefully at Algonquin Grace Hospice in his 82nd year.

High School brought Bruce into her life and together, they built strong and life-long friendships everywhere they went.\n\nElizabeth graduated from nursing school at the Toronto General Hospital and had a short career there while Bruce finished his Engineering Degree at the University of Toronto. As soon as Bruce graduated they were married and soon settled in Rosemere, Quebec with all three of her children born in Montreal over the next few years.\n\nIn 1962 the young family moved to Toronto and settled in Don Mills. Great and lifelong friends for the whole family were made on Overbank Crescent. Most weekends and holidays were spent at the family cottage on Lake of Bays.\n\nIn 1972 the family moved to Huntsville, Ontario and their dream home at Echo Bay on Fairy Lake, where they lived until very recently.\n\nFor many years Elizabeth was the manager of The Bookcase; a local bookstore on the main street of Huntsville.

She was also a very talented and active artist, she was involved with local painting groups and she participated in local art shows where her work proved to be quite popular.\n\nElizabeth and Bruce had an abundance of strong friendships that they made throughout their lives together. They always made an effort to stay in touch and enjoyed a very active social life, Bruce was always her trusted wing-man. The ladies from the “coffee klatch” in Huntsville met regularly and that kept her up to date on the local news; she always enjoyed a good round of tennis, even well into her later years. She was a good friend to many people.\n\nCertainly the most important thing in Elizabeth’s life was her family. To us, she was completely devoted. She always wanted a report and would light up hearing stories about her children, her grandchildren and of course her great-granddaughter.\n\nThroughout their lives, Elizabeth and Bruce took care of each other. The strength of their love for each other has been an inspiration to us all.\n\nElizabeth was beautiful both inside and out.\n\nSincere thanks to Dr. Lindsay MacMillan, Dr. Kirkpatrick and Dr. McDermott for their compassionate care and to her daily caregivers that kept her laughing, Janice and Jessica.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation.

Lise passed away early in the morning, at home, with her daughter Lisa and sister Therese at her side. Left to mourn her passing is her daughter Lisa and her husband Andy Anderson, grandson Mathieu Anderson and his partner Crystal, her sister Therese, brothers Jerome, Don, Gilles and Paul Benoit, brothers-in-law Gaston and Luke Bedard add sister-in-law Liette as well as many nieces and nephews. Predeceased by her son Michel Bedard.\n\nLise and Ivan and their children lived in Hamilton for many years until 2006 when they retired to North and South Portage, Huntsville. Lise was a remarkable woman, many who were happy to call friend. She was independent, kind,, thoughtful, humorous, resourceful, sympathetic, cheerful, friendly and helpful, just a few words to describe Lise. She loved to read and to learn new things, such as pen and ink drawings which she really enjoyed and was quite good at. She had a questioning mind and discovered that Google could answer may of her questions, but not all, which really excited Lise. No description of Lise is complete without including stubborn. When Lise made up her mind to do something very little would change her mind, not even Cancer. She, who was ready to help anyone else, was not willing to ask others for help. Lise felt she had to be as independent as possible. Thank God for her sister Therese, who was with Lise throughout these last couple of years and worked and played at her side – they were a great team. I will miss her phone calls when she would say “just called to shoot the sh– with you”. She was fun seeking and her spirit was larger than life. Lise will be sadly missed.\n\nIn keeping with Lise’s wishes, cremation has taken place. A service and interment will take place later in Ramore, Ontario. As an expression of sympathy, memorial donations can be made to the Canadian Cancer Society, Research.

She was pre-deceased by her 5 siblings, Margaret, Mary, Joe, Monica and Cecile.\n\nIn 1939, Rebecca married Andre Laflamme from Masson, Quebec. Andre’s job as a construction contractor required him to work in remote locations and Rebecca would travel with him to all the new areas being opened up and roads being built in the northern part of Ontario. After the birth of their first daughter Janine (Jim), they decided to settle down in Huntsville as he was working for Muskoka Construction, and she was expecting her second daughter Diana (John). Andre continued to work up north, but Rebecca kept herself very busy with raising her daughters and keeping an immaculate home. She knit, crocheted, did pickling (any kind of pickle) and preserves (any kind of fruit). Always in crisply ironed neat dress and apron she worked tirelessly for her girls. She oversaw their participation in piano, bag pipes, ballet, tap and skating, with the costumes always made ahead of time. She took her Catholic faith seriously and instilled the power of prayer in her daughters, grandchildren and great grandchildren. She never missed Mass on Sunday at the old church on the hill, or evening devotions. Each night prayers and rosary were said at home.\n\nRebecca was very active at St Mary’s of the Assumption parish in Huntsville. She was one of the founding daughters of the Catholic Woman’s League over 65 years ago, attending her last meeting at age 98. She would be the first to offer to assist with any task or special occasion, always being the first to be arrive and the last to leave.\n\nRebecca took up curling and enjoyed it immensely until a back injury prevented her from continuing. She was always asked to go on bonspiels because she was so easy to get along with and was always on time, often arriving early for any event.\n\nAfter Andre’s passing in 1974, Rebecca began to travel to see family and friends and was able to stay for long periods of time. She would always lend a helping hand and financial support to anyone in need. She was the favorite of so many and is remembered as “Aunt Becky” or “Tante Becky” on the French-Canadian side.\n\nAs Nan, Nana, Nanny or Nanny Muzzi (as she was later called), the matriarch of 5 generations, she was blessed with an ever-growing extended family of 5 grandchildren (Michael (Michaelia), Michelle (Edward), Candia (George), Jean-Andre (Alana) and Joel (deceased)), 8 great grandchildren (Chantelle, Danielle (Bob), Rachelle, Kristen, Melanie, Mark, Kennedy and Jade) and 10 great-great grandchildren (Owen, Charlee, Axl, Savannah, Olivia, Nicholas, Christopher, Linzi, Paisley and Cruz). This large group kept Rebecca very busy, and they all loved her dearly. She was always invited to any event and until recently, travelled as far as Hanover, North Bay, Collingwood, Timmins and Masson, Quebec to attend as many as she could.\n\nIn 1986, Rebecca would marry Sam Muzzi, who was welcomed into the family and became Grandpa Sam to all the great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren. They continued to reside in Huntsville with Rebecca traveling with Sam until he retired. Sam was instrumental in ensuring that she was able to attend so many of the family events.\n\nFor the past two years, Rebecca has resided at Fairvern Nursing Home in Huntsville. There she was able to attend mass once a month and other events as she was able such as bingo and sing-songs. She loved when the bands would come and play for the residents and true to her nature, she was always making others there know that they were loved. She received regular visits from her family and friends and was very popular among the staff and residents. In February 2020, family and friends gathered to celebrate her 100th birthday! She truly was queen for the day and those able to attend were blessed to have been able to celebrate this significant milestone with her. The family is extremely grateful for the care and attentiveness shown to Rebecca and her family during her time at Fairvern.\n\nSo many memories which will be cherished forever, Rebecca, Mom, Nan, Nanny, Nanny Muzzi, you are loved deeply always.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be celebrated on Friday, December 3, 2021 at St. Mary of the Assumption Roman Catholic Church, Huntsville. www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca\n\nCASE, Rhonda Francine\n\nThe family of Rhonda Francine Oakley Case is heartbroken to announce her passing on November 21, 2021 at Hospice Huntsville following a reoccurring battle with cancer. With her husband Don and children Stephen (Rosanne), Jenny-Nicole (Neil), and Chad (Tera), by her side, Rhonda passed as she wanted, surrounded by family.\n\nRhonda was a devoted mom who did everything she could for her family and opened her home to everyone. She was lovingly called “Mom” by many of her children’s friends. In addition to being a devoted mother, Rhonda was an amazing grandmother who was loved and adored by her six grandchildren, Bailey, Rachel, Olivia, Calvin, Charlotte, and Christine.\n\nThe cherished daughter of Frank and Winifred Oakley, she was proud to be born and raised in the Leaside area of Toronto where she also worked at the Imperial Oil head office and was a part time model. In 1967 she met the love of her life, Don Case, at the YMCA ski club. They became engaged four months later and were married in Leaside in September of 1968. A self declared city girl, Rhonda moved to Huntsville reluctantly in 1969 when Don purchased a business. She quickly came to call Huntsville home and said she would never move back to Toronto. She became an active member of the Kinsmen women’s club, the Hidden Valley Ski Club and a local ladies poker club.\n\nIn 1988, Rhonda joined Don in a new venture as the owners of Bradley Furniture where she had a knack for interior design and enjoyed helping others furnish their homes.\n\nFor someone who had never camped before, Rhonda found that she loved it and traveled from East to West in Canada and to 42 US states in a pop-up trailer and three different motor homes. She spent her winters as a snowbird in Florida where she was surrounded by a fun loving group of friends.\n\nRhonda faced her first battle with cancer in 2005 and determined to watch her grandchildren grow, she endured treatment with a determination and bravery that can only be admired. She won the battle that time. She embraced being a grandma and always put the needs of her grandchildren first. She was always available, always listened and always insisted on a hug. When the cancer returned in 2020, she bravely faced treatment again during the COVID pandemic. Although she beat it again, it returned once more in 2021.\n\nThrough everything, nothing stopped her from cooking and playing cards and crokinole with her family and grandchildren in particular. These memories will be cherished forever.\n\nWe will love you always.\n\nA private service will be held by the family. Anyone wishing to commemorate Rhonda’s life is asked to donate in her honour to a charity of their choosing. www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca\n\nCARR, Betty Marie (nee Coker)\n\nPassed away peacefully on Wednesday, November 17, 2021 at South Muskoka Memorial Hospital at the age of 81.

Namaste.\n\nBROWN, Harry\n\nIt is with great sadness that the family announces the passing of Harry Brown in Barrie on Sunday, November 7, 2021 at the age of 87. Loving son of the late Dora (nee Dalglish) and the late Harry Brown. Beloved husband of the late Luella (Lu) Brown (nee Heise). Proud father of Tom (Cathy Hull) and Merrilu (Darran Helmer). Dear brother of Robert (Elaine) Brown and the late Isobel (Bill) Dickie. Cherished by grandsons Christopher and Nicholas Beckett-Brown (Sabine Bouchard) and in recent years, bonus granddaughter Brittany (Ryan) Baker (nee Helmer).\n\nAn avid outdoorsman all his life, Harry instilled a love of the outdoors in his children and subsequently, his grandchildren, as well as mentoring many other colleagues and students. He began his teaching career in Ottawa where he met Lu when she was the school nurse at the same school. In the summer, they worked at summer camps, which led to a career shift and a move to Huntsville in 1970 to work full time at Camp Tawingo, where his contributions have become legendary. Harry went back into teaching at Spruce Glen School in 1973, where he remained until he retired in 1989. Many of his students fondly remember trips to the sugarbush at the Brown’s property, as well as rocket launches and camping trips, both winter and summer. There were many parents begging him to teach just one more year so their children could have the benefit of being his students.\n\nHarry was a long-time member of the Huntsville Nature Club and the Huntsville and District Agricultural Society, assisting with the judging of children’s literary entries. He also volunteered with Meals on Wheels and with the Hospital Auxillary, both unofficially and officially, and helped to maintain the Lu Brown Memorial Garden at the front of the hospital.\n\nThrough Muskoka Seniors for Nature, Harry presented various slide shows at local retirement homes and was a part of the Muskoka Conservancy, receiving the Wayland Drew Award for his contributions to the preservation of natural areas. He was also instrumental in the development of the nature trail system at the Ontario Teacher Federation’s Campground near Dunchurch, where the Browns, the Tripps and the Shaws have camped together for close to 50 years. His campfire stories, complete with nature calls, and his star gazing sessions will not be forgotten. Nor will the many years of making award winning maple syrup, at the Huntsville Fall Fair and the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair, with the help of good friends, particularly the Stickland family, Hall Seely and Elmer Dobson. There were a few sugarbush parties over the years that lived up to The Rover’s ‘Wasn’t That A Party’.\n\nHis recent years were much more low key but he still loved to watch the birds and comment on cloud formations and their potential for precipitation.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on Friday, November 26th at Billingsley Funeral Home in Huntsville. Friends can gather at 1:00pm with the live streamed celebration of life starting at 2:00pm. A light lunch will follow. Proof of vaccination and masks will be required.

Mark was devoted to all his grandchildren (Andrew, Ella, and Max Dussault, Sloane and Griffin Saunders, Karine and Nic Dussault).\n\nMark was generous, kind and reserved, a man who tended to understate his many accomplishments. As an example of his many interests and talents, during a gap in his medical career, he, along with his friend, Bill Adams, started Sandhill Nursery.\n\nMark loved his grown children, his “chosen family” of friends, his many dogs, the Blues, trout streams, all the natural world and, almost above all else, small children.\n\nThe family thanks the many people who cared for, befriended and helped Mark in their own special ways.

His illness was short and his death was sudden. Although he was double vaccinated and took all precautions, he tested positive for Covid three days before he died. Due to Covid precautions at the hospital, his wife Nadya could not be by his side and could only communicate with him by phone throughout his illness. She is thankful for the many calls she had with Kim in those final 4 days, where he was upbeat and lucid, and when we all thought he would beat the odds again. His sudden passing a few hours after the last phone call came as a shock. Amongst his final words to her on that final call were, “We’ll get through this together.” Those words are especially dear to Nadya as she strives to recover from Covid herself.\n\nBorn to Mary Candiano and Camille Lambert Sr June 24, 1927 in Lawrence, Massachusetts, Kim was raised by his loving Flemish and Sicilian parents and enjoyed a childhood with younger siblings Vincent and Grace. At the age of 17, towards the end of the Second World War, he enthusiastically enlisted with the US Army and, after basic training, travelled by ship to Europe where he undertook various roles including a chauffeur, an administrative assistant, and a paratrooper-in-training. He never saw active duty and when he left the army three years later he turned his attention to school, marriage and his career. He received his PhD in Social Research from Brandeis University in 1962 and after moving to Pittsburgh to work, he became distraught at the social unrest and conservatism in the United States. In 1968 he emigrated with new wife, Leah, and her two children, Lisa and Phil, to Canada, where he became Director of Research at the University of Toronto’s School of Social Work.\n\nKim was proud of his work at the University, and especially enjoyed supervising and mentoring PhD candidates. He was well-loved by his students, who appreciated his curiosity, intellect and availability. He was also a pioneer in his field of research and took an early interest in the use of computers to help with social planning. It was this interest that led him to meet Nadya, who would be his partner – “attached at the hip” – for the last 40 years of his life. Nadya in the early 1980s was Director of Research for the Social Planning Council in Ottawa; also forward-thinking and interested in how technology could assist researchers, she facilitated the first ever hands-on workshops with Dr Kim Lambert on the use of personal computers in social research. From the time they met there was a special chemistry between them. Kim enjoyed how Nad challenged him – he called it “verbal swordplay” – and their relationship blossomed quickly, with Nad moving to Toronto to be close to him.\n\nIn 1987 Kim took early retirement from the University of Toronto and both he and Nad moved to their beloved cottage on Menominee Lake, their Sanctus Spiritus, a place where they would make a warm and welcoming home together for the rest of their lives. Over the years as Kim and Nad’s relationship grew, so did their lakeside home, which expanded little by little with the help of local contractors and their own hard work. Kim became a well-loved and engaged member of the community, sitting on numerous committees, boards and local church councils, and together with Nad actively participating in the Muskoka Field Naturalists, the Probus Club, square and round dancing clubs and the local improv group. He made many friends along the way, and he and Nad loved to welcome friends and family to their home for their many gatherings and celebrations over the years.\n\nEven after retiring Kim stayed active professionally and intellectually, working with Nadya to conduct social research and consultations until he was 75. He and Nadya also completed the 3-year Lay Preachers’ course after which they did pulpit supply at United Churches across Muskoka. Kim continued his daily reflections until his death.\n\nKim deeply valued his continuing relationship with children Lisa and Phil, and took care to stay connected over the years. He also forged strong bonds with Nadya’s children Lev and Tamara, their partners and his four grandchildren. Grampa Kim especially loved sharing his skills in tractor driving and tree felling, activities he enjoyed into his final months.\n\nAlthough Kim’s time in hospital was short, we know that the staff did everything they could for him, treating him like the vibrant person he was despite his advanced age. Nadya heard that he charmed the staff and was appreciative and engaging with them, and Kim told her he was receiving excellent care. We’d like to say a special thank you to the nurses, doctors (Dr Correia) and staff of the Huntsville Hospital for the care they took with Kim. We’d also like to thank Larry and Bill Mitchell who have been so helpful in comforting us and making the final arrangements, and Rev. Dianne Knowles and Karen Hamra who have been supportive through this difficult time.\n\nWe know that Kim would want to thank Nadya for all the attentive care and love she gave him, especially as he faced numerous health issues in recent years. In one of his last emails to his nephew Vincent Jr, he expressed his deep appreciation beautifully: “I am truly lucky to have Nadya by my side, planning and working and being a real partner. Without her, I would be completely lost and would have no idea what to do with myself.”\n\nKim is missed profoundly by his dear wife and life partner of over 35 years Nadya Tarasoff, his adoring children Lisa, Phil (Hannah), Lev (Dorothee) and Tamara (John), his grandchildren Jaspar, Nicholas, Katya and Elena, and his furry four-legged companions Pushi and Ensi. He is also remembered fondly by family and friends throughout Canada and the United States, as well as by his many dear close friends in the Menominee Lake and Huntsville area.\n\nA celebration of life is planned to take place on June 24, 2022, Kim’s 95th birthday. Details to follow but we are all hopeful conditions will allow us to hug one another as we honour and share happy memories of Kim. In the meantime donations in Kim’s memory to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation, the Muskoka Conservancy or Trinity United Church would be welcome if you so wish.\n\nKim lived a long and full life and although we are all reeling now, we know he would not want us to be sad for long. We found a notebook of his where he shared the lessons that he learned during his life with Nad in their Spiritus Sanctus. We know he’d like it if we thought of him – and his happy and hopeful words – in the days and weeks ahead:\n\n“Live each exciting moment to the fullest – first snowfall, whether it’s October or December, last ice-out on the lake anytime from March to May; and enjoy the delicate winter fern and spring flowers peeping through the last of the winter snow.” www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca\n\nBrenda Irene Webb passed away peacefully at her residence on November 5th, 2021 at the age of 60.

Joyce worked as a graphic artist in downtown Toronto upon her graduation from Northern Vocational. She passed her artistic skills and love of design onto her children. Many life long friendships were created with people of all ages. She lived life with a fierce spirit and a will to do and make. Her love language was hand crafted treasures and letters. She had great organizational skills and was involved in a variety of groups and organizations over the years (e.g. Girl Guides of Canada, was one of the founding members of the Markham Guild of Village Crafts, and was active in the Victoria Square and Port Sydney UCW).

At a young age Barb moved to Gravenhurst to work at the Rubber Set, where she met her loving husband of 75 years, Mel. Mel and Barb were married November 23rd 1946, and lovingly raised four children together. After moving from their home in Gravenhurst, they purchased and ran a little general store in Baysville for a few years, after which they moved to Huntsville, where they resided in their beautiful home until spring of 2021.\n\nOne of Barb’s most favourite things was to host many of their good friends to dinner, which more often than not, resulted in a serious game of euchre. Anyone who knew Barb, knows that she was one heck of a card player and she loved to win!\n\nSquare dancing together became another one of Barb’s favourite evening events with her husband. Mel and Barb met many good friends over the years dancing, some with whom they still to this day cherish wonderful friendships with.\n\nFamily was her life, Barb loved to share pictures and tell everyone about her many grandchildren and great grandchildren, she was so proud of her big beautiful family. Barb spent many hours knitting sweaters, mitts, socks, afghans and toques for her grandkids.

With his beloved wife, Diana (Radesch), holding his hand, daughter, Kelly, and son, Jamie, holding the other, Don completed his incredible life journey in the arms of his family, exactly as he had hoped. Adored by his grandchildren — Simon and Kieran (Joseph Day), Spencer and Kyla (JoAnne McCormick) — they shared extremely close relationships with their Poppa and are devastated by the loss.\n\nDon is also missed by cousins, Roy MacGregor, Jim and Stephanie MacGregor, Tom MacGregor, whom he considered siblings. He is also missed by sister and lifelong friend, Bonnie Barry. He is also remembered by: the wonderful high school friends he continued close relationships with to this day; his 4 Davidson friends from Queen’s; Cawesco friends from Hamilton; Huntsville High School teaching friends; Scotch Club; his hockey and lacrosse teammates; his golf buddies; his triathlon community and fellow swimmers; his close community of wonderful friends in Huntsville; dear friends in Australia; and close family friends, the Tick’s, Dryden’s and Riley’s.\n\nBorn Donald Irvine McCormick, July 28th, 1941, in Whitney, Ontario, he was pre-deceased by his parents, Irvine and Gertrude (Heintzman) McCormick, brother Andrew and his wife Kathleen. An extremely proud descendant of Algonquin Park lineage, Don and his cousins regaled in their shared experiences growing up together in Huntsville and around Algonquin Park. Amongst his final outings, Don returned to his childhood cottage site at Lake of Two Rivers with his grandkids to share their history with the land, and their ancestors, one last time.\n\nDon was raised in Whitney until he left to attend the closest high school, Huntsville High School, one month after his 13th birthday. After graduating high school just before his 17th birthday, he attended Queen’s University where he obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree in Chemistry, followed by a teaching certificate. He started his teaching career at Barton Secondary School in Hamilton and it was here that he met Diana, who was attending nurses college at the time.\n\nMarried in January of 1966, Don and Diana had daughter, Kelly, and moved to Huntsville for a teaching position, where he was Science Department Head at Huntsville High School until his retirement in 1997. With the birth of son, Jamie, the roots of family were established at Ravenscliffe Rd. where they have remained to this day. Don began a long history of community involvement and presence, leaving only when the family moved to California in order for him to obtain his Masters in Education from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and later, taking a year off to travel around the world.\n\nBased on a desire to help shape and protect the future of Huntsville, he entered into local politics as a Town Councillor in the early 1970s, serving as councillor for Chaffey Township. This political involvement eventually led to, amongst others, his work with the Parks and Recreation Committee, an involvement that would continue for the duration of his life, culminating in his work for the Trans Canada Trail, the Economic Development Committee and his efforts to secure and promote the multiple versions of the Muskoka Triathlon races that continue to this day.\n\nDon lived his life in the pursuit of excellence — professionally, athletically, intellectually, socially, interpersonally, and personally. This pursuit would lead him to successes that included: membership on the Canadian National Triathlon Team representing Canada at the World Championships on multiple occasions; a Huntsville Sports Hall of Fame inductee; recipient of the Jan Glenn Award; a celebrated catalyst for dozens of local activity-based facilities and events, and a leader within the community for ensuring that future generations had the best quality opportunities to pursue their own excellence.\n\nA born teacher and leader, Don was known throughout the region for being a coach/instructor (hockey, tennis, cross-country skiing, swimming, downhill skiing), professional photographer, and writer/journalist. He received numerous awards and recognition for his tireless work. He always pursued a vast array of interests. He joined several local choirs and participated in numerous local theatre productions, both on stage and off. He also served on the Algonquin Forestry Authority for 10 years.\n\nDespite these successes, if you asked him the most rewarding aspect of all of these endeavours, he would tell you it was a chance to build relationships with the people he participated with in the process. The visits on decks, docks, boats, golf courses and while he was in hospice meant so much to him and his family, and they are forever grateful for the connections maintained throughout his life, including the past few months.\n\nDon and his family are incredibly grateful for the care and support he received by Dr. John Rea, Dr. Deb Harrold, Dr. Rich Trenholm, Dr. Roy Kirkpatrick, Chaplain Russ Buckerfield, Social Worker Lesley Patterson; the wonderful staff at Huntsville District Memorial Hospital (Oncology Clinic, Emergency Department), and Home and Community Care (RN Samantha). His end of life care at Algonquin Grace Hospice was outstanding. Both Don and his family were cared for with compassion, dignity and attention to every detail. In lieu of flowers, please donate to Algonquin Grace Hospice.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held in 2022 when all in attendance can, as was so perfectly captured by the MacGregor family, “give and receive the hugs we all need”. Details will be available on the Mitchell Funeral Home website, www.mitchellfuneralhome.ca\n\nDon was above all a father, husband, Poppa, son, brother, cousin and friend. He was a proud Canadian, Algonquin Park ancestor, and Huntsville ambassador. It is now up to us to share in his legacy — try a triathlon, walk on the Hunter’s Bay Trail, go for a paddle, look for ways to get involved in your community, and cherish your family and friends.\n\nMason, Ronald Arthur, “Ron” age 86, formerly of Collingwood, passed on October 13, 2021, in Ottawa. Ron was a licensed auto mechanic, electrician, teacher, sports coach, and accomplished scuba diver.\n\nBorn 14 April 1935 in Brantford, Ontario, to Ronald and Edna Mason.

Grandfather to Ryan, Krista, Cole, and Sean Mason; and nephew, Alan Prior (Angela) and niece Leslie Dawson.\n\nRon spent his teenage years around cars at his father’s gas station with auto shop allowing him to hone his mechanical skills and foster his fascination with vehicles. He was involved with the Brantford Piston Pushers in their early years. As a teenager he enjoyed a noisy drag down the streets of Brantford with buddies until the authorities told them to make their own track. This was the raw beginning of the Cayuga Speedway.\n\nRon was an automotive teacher in Huntsville High School for a few decades. He taught for the Peel Region in Ontario and numerous years at the college level with the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT) in disciplines of electrical and mechanical. He was a licensed auto mechanic and electrician in Alberta and Ontario. He ran his own businesses as an electrician and a small auto shop to keep cars on the road. He also contracted himself out to Chrysler Canada as an electronics quality control specialist.\n\nRon had a full busy life, anchored by his love of physical activity, hockey, downhill skiing, a trek to Everest Base camp, numerous international excursions as a master scuba diver. Anchored also by his dedication to helping youth reach their highest capabilities through his coaching ability. He coached within the High School sports programs, within the Huntsville Minor hockey association and winning at the All-Ontario minor hockey championships.\n\nHe was a perfectionist in everything he did and lead by example. When working in his trades, his answer to the question “Why do you do things that way” was “because it has my name on it.”\n\nA funeral service and/or public celebration of life will be held later.\n\nHitchen, Dorothy Christine (nee Blacow)\n\nMarch 16, 1937 – October 23, 2021\n\nWith great sadness we announce the passing of Dorothy at The Pines in Bracebridge, at the age of 84.

Daughter of the late Thomas John Kern (Jack) and Jerrine Kern (Ferris). Katharine was the loving and devoted mother to Brian Douglas (Cynthia), David Alan and Gail Elizabeth; proud and beloved Grandma of Ryan Ford (Dana), Saxon Guptill, Kyle Ford, Hailey Guptill and Megan Ford; and Great Grandma to Cole and Clayton Ford (sons of Kyle).\n\nKatharine was predeceased by her siblings and their spouses, brother John Ferris Kern (Joan), twin sister Barbara Mann (Larry). Predeceased by J. Eric Ford (divorced) Katharine enjoyed the love and support from Alan Ford (deceased) (Nancy), Ron Ford (Faye) and Lynn Berdekles (Ted). Katharine will be remembered as loving Aunt to all her nieces and nephews.\n\nKatharine will be lovingly remembered for her endless commitment to serving all her communities with graciousness, generosity and joy. After graduating from Lawrence Park Collegiate and then Wellesley Hospital School of Nursing in the class of 1952 she stayed on at Wellesley Hospital for two years before heading to England and Europe to travel with classmates. In London Katharine stayed on to study and work at the renowned Neurological Institute, Queen’s Square. Returning to Toronto in 1956, Katharine joined the nursing staff at Toronto General Hospital’s general and neurological units. During this time she met J. Eric Ford and left nursing in 1958 to start a family.\n\nKeeping her close ties to nursing, Katharine joined the Wellesley Hospital Alumni and was active for many years in several annual fundraising activities. As her young family grew she extended her volunteering to include Sunnybrook Hospital’s Veterans Centre, the Public School PTA, Meals on Wheels, and fundraising committees for Crescent School and Havergal College. While serving on these committees she volunteered for Cubs and Brownies, school team support, even sewing costumes for school plays.\n\nIn 1975, Katharine began University part time at York University’s Glendon College and earned a BA in Political and Social Science while the volunteering continued. She volunteered at the Children’s Aid Society in Adoption Disclosures and joined the board of directors from 1982 to 1989. She completed her service to Children’s Aid in Adoption Disclosures until retirement in 1995.\n\nOne of Katharine’s deepest commitments was to the Love and Service of God through the Anglican Church. Beginning in her youth, Katharine was active volunteering in Sunday School at St Clements Church. When her young family began regular attendance at St Patrick’s Church, Katharine joined the Ladies Guild and helped lead dances, concerts, yard sales and Church Bazaars for many years. When she moved to Ajax, Katharine joined Holy Trinity Anglican Church and worked tirelessly on the campaign to rebuild the aging building. In 2004, Katharine decided to make the family ski chalet in Hidden Valley her permanent home and joined All Saints Church in Huntsville. She was highly active at All Saints participating in fundraising, Church business affairs, and hours of charitable work from knitting countless sweaters for Global Warmth to collecting as many used warm winter garments as she could for the Mission to Seafarers – Port of Thunder Bay. Another of her favourite activities was to provide rides for non-driving parishioners to Church, doctors appointments, hairdressers and even Christmas shopping. During much of this time she volunteered as a Steward to coordinate the collection and counting of the weekly offering.\n\nIn addition to Katharine’s commitment to Church, charity and community service, she also found time to enjoy the many activities that she loved. From a young age she loved camping, canoeing, swimming, tennis, skiing, traveling, sewing, knitting and embroidery and had a special love for all the family dogs – often offering to look after her children’s pets for extended periods.\n\nWhile Katharine’s community presence was extensive, her most heartfelt devotion was to her family and friends – especially her children. As a role model, if any friend, family member, neighbour or sometimes even strangers were in need, there was only one possible answer – “What can I do to help?” As a mother, Katharine’s home was a favourite place for kids to gather and play, shoot hoops, or just hang out – and there were always cold drinks and snacks. Many of the children’s ski friends recall numerous times when there were suddenly 4 or more extra mouths welcomed at the lunch table or nights when extra beds were needed. Katharine was not only welcoming to the kids’ friends, she also supported her children through countless school and extracurricular activities including art lessons, sports, swimming, cubs and brownies, all while passing on her sound values.\n\nKatharine leaves us with so many sentimental memories and has been an inspiration and support throughout all her communities in all aspects of her life, her inspiration and love live on.\n\nIn keeping with Katharine’s wishes, cremation has taken place. Family and friends are invited to a visitation on Monday, October 18, 2021 from 2-4 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. Visitation will be held in increments of 30 minutes. We ask that you please RSVP on Katharine’s memorial page at www.billingsleyfuneralhome.com In keeping with Covid-19 restrictions; facial coverings, contact tracing and distancing of 2 metres will be strictly adhered to.

As an expression of sympathy, memorial donations can be made to the Huntsville Hospital Foundation in lieu of flowers.\n\nGAREAU, Una Lois “Ginger”\n\nIt is with heavy hearts the family of Una “Ginger” Gareau announce her passing on September 20th, 2021, at the age of 81.
