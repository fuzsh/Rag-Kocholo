She was a loving wife to Terry Alan McKelvey and the proud mother of Kassandra Celeste McKelvey.​\n\nBorn on January 20, 1963 in Charleston, West Virginia, she was the daughter of the late David Lee and Lyda Mae (Neeley) Kelly. Kim met her future husband at the beginning of their senior year of high school where they quickly became friends and began dating after Kim agreed to go to the senior prom with Terry. They remained a couple for the following three years while attending attending separate universities three hours bus ride apart. In 1984 Kim transferred to the University of Pittsburgh where she married Terry and finished her B.S. in Education, specializing in science education, at the University of Pittsburgh.​\n\nKim was a smart, strong, capable, beautiful, and independent woman who had lived on her own beginning in adulthood while she worked her way through college. She had a lifelong interest in earth science, working five years as a middle school earth science teacher in North Carolina, followed by about 20 years working as a laboratory coordinator for the Physics, Engineering, and Geosciences department at Montgomery College, Rockville, Maryland. One notable duty as a laboratory coordinator was that she routinely carried 50-pound telescope parts to set up a telescope on the roof of a building at Montgomery College and on field trips. Kim loved working with the faculty, staff, and students of Montgomery College, maintaining student laboratories and associated computers, setting up experiments for students and faculty, and maintaining and running the college observatory.​\n\nKim faced unexpected adversity a year and a half after the birth of her daughter when she was stricken with a late onset form of mental illness. Kim bravely fought hard to live a normal life with the illness and was mostly successful in doing so for 12 years while she continued to work at Montgomery College. She reluctantly retired from the College in 2018 when she was no longer able to work, and since then had gradually increasing medical complications. She was incredibly strong in coping with her illness even as it increasingly limited her activities. The illness never affected her gentle, kind heart or her love for her husband, daughter, family, and friends. She was always more concerned about and put family and friends first, even when facing great difficulties herself.\n\nKim most enjoyed the simple things in life, reading and telling stories to Kass when she was young, discussing topics that were of interest to her husband and daughter, crocheting blankets, eating with her family at a favorite restaurant, walking in local parks, going on road trips, and visiting national parks and theme parks. She was the vacation planner of the family; she planned the most memorable vacations including two Outer Banks beach vacations with a large number of family on both sides of her family. Kim became an avid collector of Santa figurines and Christmas tree ornaments. Kim loved and cared for a number of cats during her 39 years of marriage to Terry. She enjoyed spending time with her husband visiting art museums, art galleries, and local arts and crafts shows.\n\nKim will be most remembered for her gentle spirit and kind and generous heart. She is loved and dearly missed.\n\nAlong with her husband, Terry McKelvey, Kimberly is survived by her daughter, Kassandra McKelvey; sister, Laura Whitehurst; and brother, Christopher Kelly.

Fanny was passionate and an advocate of education. Fanny was an active member of the National Hispanic Coalition of Federal Aviation Employees( NHCFAE) and throughout her career she advocated for opportunities for Hispanics in the federal government workforce. Fanny was instrumental in establishing the Rene Matos Memorial fund which continues to support educational efforts for Hispanics.\n\nThe (NHCFAE) established the Rene Matos Memorial Scholarship in the name of a very motivated and dedicated man, who epitomized the dream to succeed, while helping others along the way. Even from his humble beginnings as an air traffic controller in Puerto Rico, Rene displayed a talent and personality that could not be contained there. While he was in Puerto Rico, Matos never curbed his desire to advance in his career. Already gifted in what he did as a controller, Rene wanted to do more; not only for his own career, but for other Hispanics as well. He educated himself and eventually moved up in the ranks as a top manager at the William J. Hughes Technical Center in New Jersey. It was Rene’s drive, diligence and determination that earned him that position.\n\nRene Matos was the NHCFAE President from 1989-1992. Rene was proud of his heritage, and it was apparent in all his efforts in the Coalition. His sole purpose was to see other Hispanics succeed. We honored his dream by establishing a scholarship in his name.\n\n​\n\nDonations are tax deductible and may be made as follows:\n\nElectronically Donations: http://paypal.me/nhcfaefoundation\n\nIf you wish to donate via check, please make it payable to:\n\nNHCFAE Charitable Foundation\n\n2035 Park Ave\n\nNewcastle, OK 73065\n\n​\n\nMary Ellen Burdette, 84 of Dickerson, Maryland, went to see Jesus on January 7th, 2021.

Johnson for 50 years. Born on May 8, 1949, in Reading, PA, she was the daughter of the late Paul Daniel and Hope Cheney (Warren) Davis.\n\nIn addition to her husband, Geraldine is survived by her two sons, Derek Van Johnson and Ryan Welden Johnson; her mother-in-law, Nell Gates; sister, Phyllis Anne Graves; two brothers, Byron Winfield Davis and Cornell Warren Davis; her stepmother, Pearl Williams Davis; a niece, Nicole Graves; a nephew, Cornell Garrett; and an aunt, Bernice McRae. Preceding Geraldine in death were two aunts, Irma McGalliaria and Marion Toler and five uncles: Charles Warren and Raymond Davis, Larry Davis, Bobby Davis, and Freddy Davis.\n\nGeraldine Claire Johnson (professionally known as Geraldine Claire) was an author, playwright, and songwriter. She wrote a four-book Harbingers series (Harbingers of Spring, Harbingers of Summer, Harbingers of Autumn, and Harbingers of Winter), detailing the trials and tribulations of a well-to-do family living in upper-crust Potomac, MD. She also authored a children’s book of poems and music, A Family Still, United Nations, extolling the bravery and resilience of children around the world confronted with natural tragedies, such Hurricane Katrina and the Haiti earthquake; and man-made destruction, such as the 9/11 terrorist attack. She also wrote a musical play, Greener Grass, whose setting was a golf course; a screenplay, Shields of Honor; and a musical, One Last Go Round. These and other projects were set for production at the DeRyan Theatre Workshop, which she founded and served as its artistic director, until illness forced her to cease activities.\n\nThe Davis family moved from Reading, PA, to the Germantown section of Philadelphia, PA, in 1955, when Geraldine was 6 years old. A self-proclaimed tomboy, she played mostly with her brothers and their friends and, to her enjoyment and their chagrin, often beat them in bicycle racing around the neighborhood. But her pure enjoyment came in listening to her father sing opera. A graduate of The Julliard School of Music, he was a local celebrity and had performed abroad, including at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Geraldine had inherited his talent and spent hours singing while listening to LP (long-playing) albums on a stereo system that her father had installed throughout the house. Although she liked opera, she loved show tunes and theatre music. So, while her friends were listening to the Temptations’ “My Girl,” she cuddled up with Barbara Streisand’s “Funny Girl.”\n\nGeraldine attended Germantown High School where she excelled in English and writing classes and she sang on the choir. At 17, she met a 19-year-old Temple University sophomore named Clarence Johnson. Clarence had asked Byron, Geraldine’s brother, for her phone number after he heard that she was a “fox.” Initially, she didn’t like Clarence, especially his corny jokes. But he persisted. And one day when he rolled up in a 1963 red and white Ford Thunderbird to pick her up from school, the handwriting—“eventual marriage”—was on the wall.\n\nIn 1969, Clarence was drafted into the Army and stationed at Fort Lesley J. McNair in Washington, DC. They married in 1970 and moved to Arlington, VA, across the river from Fort McNair. Within 2 years, Clarence had been honorably discharged, Geraldine had given birth to her first son, Derek, and the family had moved to a small house with a swimming pool in Chillum, MD. Geraldine, not much of a swimmer, often sunbathed while writing songs and singing to her toddler. In 1979, a second son, Ryan, was born, and, 2 years later, the family moved to a bigger home in Calverton, MD. By then, she had become a physical fitness devotee, determined to keep her lifelong petite size. So, while the kids were at school, she would jog in the park, play tennis, and work out at a local gym several times a week. At home, she would often exercise with weights and jog on the treadmill.\n\nAs the years passed, Geraldine yearned to get back into writing and music. So, she put her work in sales and in real estate on hold and took writing courses at Strayer College and music courses at the University of Maryland. Soon, she began writing songs again and, after a prolonged period of false starts, teamed with a musician and arranger to produce the body of work that would eventually become the content for her musicals.\n\nBy the time the family moved to Poolesville in 2006, she was hard at work on the Harbingers series. Thus, Harbingers of Spring was published in 2008, Harbingers of Summer in 2011, Harbingers of Autumn in 2012, and Harbingers of Winter in 2014. The children’s storybook, A Family Still, United Nations, was published in 2015.\n\nThe family will be receiving friends from 2:00–4:00 p.m. on Saturday, January 16th, at Hilton Funeral Home, located at 22111 Beallsville Road, Barnesville, MD. Per the family’s wishes, a cremation will follow. A Memorial Service will be held after pandemic restrictions on large gatherings are lifted.\n\nOn January 18, 2021, Doris K. Lee, nee Kingsbury passed away.\n\nShe was the beloved wife of William V. Lee, who predeceased her in 1972.\n\nLoving daughter of the late Maude L. Wagner and the late Joseph Manning Kingsbury, sister of the late Genevieve K. O’Connell, the late Louise K. Rice, and the late Mary Ann Lillie. Loving mother of Clifford A. Lee (Denise) and Joseph Manning Lee (Julie). Grandmother of Gregory (Jill), Rosemary (Sina Farzinfard), Brian (Kathleen), Mary Beth, Brendan (Alex), Nancy (Joe Minardi), and Bridget, and Great Grandmother of Grace and Declan Lee.

He enjoyed working with his hands and eventually started his own general contracting business. He lived in Virginia for many years where he was involved in Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and the Knights of Columbus, where he became a Grand Knight. He moved from Virginia to Maryland and after living in Bowie, Maryland, for a few years, he moved to Poolesville, Maryland, where he opened a small gift shop in town called Country Junction. When an opportunity arose several years later, he closed that shop and opened a gift shop in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The shop was quite popular with tourists. He bought a mobile home on the Shenandoah River so that he could work in the shop on weekends, and when the shop was closed, he enjoyed relaxing and fishing on the river.\n\nBob stayed busy working all his life, but still managed to have a large family along the way. He married Joan Crook (deceased) and they had two sons, Stephen (deceased in 1991) and Gary. After his first marriage, he married Carol Marino (deceased) and they had one son, Paul. Bob later met Sue Paro and they have been together for over 35 years. Sue has two children, whom Bob always treated as his own, Andrea Paro and Tom Paro.

He still enjoyed going to the river whenever possible. He never officially \"retired\" but he and Sue were excited to extensively renovate an old farmhouse in Dickerson, Maryland, where they have lived for the past several years. They devoted their time to gardening and cutting grass (even up through this past summer Bob was out on the tractor cutting grass most days). They even raised cows for a year or so. Gary and Paul joined forces in business in 2008 and asked Bob to open a gift shop again at their business location. He loved to come in a few days a week and also enjoyed building doll houses, still working with his hands and doing construction right through his 80s!\n\nWe have all been blessed in one way or another to have known Bob or been related to him.
