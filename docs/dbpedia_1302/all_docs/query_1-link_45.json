        "text": "Our Founder, Anna Herr Clise\n\nWisconsin-born Anna Herr Clise, her husband James W. Clise and their newborn daughter Ruth arrive in Seattle on June 7, 1889, after James’s sister urges the family to leave their home and prosperous real-estate business in Colorado and join her in Seattle.\n\nThe family establishes a new home at the foot of Queen Anne Hill, just 38 years after the 24-member Denny Party – Seattle’s first white settlers – landed on the beach at Alki Point in 1851.\n\nJames quickly becomes one of Seattle’s leading real-estate developers and financiers. By 1893, Anna and James have added two more children – both boys – to Seattle’s swelling population of 43,000.\n\nJust as hordes of gold prospectors flood Seattle for provisions on their way to the Yukon Territory, tragedy strikes the Clise family when their youngest son, 6-year-old Willis, becomes seriously ill. For all their money and connections, Anna and James are powerless to help Willis, and he succumbs to untreatable inflammatory rheumatism (acute swelling of the body’s joints) on March 19, 1898.\n\nAn Idea Born From Tragedy\n\nAt the time of Willis’s death, the closest children’s hospital is in San Francisco. However, the most advanced treatments for children are at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, some 2,800 miles away.\n\nEight years later, Anna and James escort their 17-year-old daughter, Ruth, to Miss Baldwin’s Finishing School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. It is late summer 1906.\n\nIn Philadelphia, Anna’s cousin, Dr. John Musser, who had established a ward for crippled children at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, gives her a tour of the hospital – the first institution in the United States dedicated to pediatric medicine.\n\nIn Syracuse, New York, Anna gets a tour of the Hospital for Women and Children, an organization founded by a group of the city’s leading women to treat female and childhood ailments and to train nurses.\n\nDuring the week-long railroad journey back to Seattle, Anna reflects on Willis’s painful illness and dreams of starting an organization – like those she toured on the East Coast – to treat sick and crippled children in Seattle.\n\nMarshalling Support\n\nOn January 4, 1907, six months after her trip to Philadelphia, Anna gathers 16 of her friends – a Who’s Who of the city’s leading women – to discuss the lack of treatment options for children in local hospitals.\n\nThe women – almost all mothers – agree to form an association to provide surgical care for children with orthopedic disorders. Each of the original members agrees to pay an annual membership fee of $10; each also antes up an additional $10 to launch the treasury.\n\nLater this year, the Dorcas Charity Club – an organization of Black women dedicated to the social welfare of Seattle’s African American community – reaches out to the hospital regarding the care of Madelaine Black, a 14-year-old Black girl with tuberculosis of the knee. Children’s and the club share the cost of her care, and in October, the hospital trustees establish a policy which lasts to this day – it will serve all children, regardless of race, religion, gender, or ability to pay.\n\nA Dream Realized\n\nOn January 11, 1907, Anna Clise files the articles of incorporation for the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association. This institution becomes the first pediatric facility in the Northwest and the third on the West Coast. (Pacific Dispensary for Women and Children is founded in San Francisco in 1875 and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles is founded in 1901.)\n\nAt its first meeting on that same day, the trustees empower an executive committee of officers to transact the association’s business between board meetings.\n\nMembers attending board meetings are expected to wear hats, gloves and attire suitable for business. Knitting and tardiness are prohibited and absenteeism is permitted only for travel.\n\nThe bylaws do not limit board membership to women, but for the next 97 years, this is to be the de facto rule.\n\nSeveral months after incorporation, a number of the initial trustees resign after they realize the difficult and time-consuming nature of providing children with free orthopedic care.\n\nThe First Arrangement\n\nAfter incorporating Children’s Orthopedic Hospital, the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association has no children, no orthopedists and no hospital.\n\nWhile trying to raise $50,000 to build a new hospital, the trustees contract with Seattle General Hospital at Fifth Avenue and Marion Street to rent seven beds for $7 each per week. The fee covers bed, meals, nursing care and operating room charges ($50,000 in 1907 is worth about $1.3 million in 2016 dollars).\n\nThe trustees initially enlist internist and surgeon Dr. Casper W. Sharples to treat any patients the association might locate. Within two weeks, 11 other doctors agree to donate their services to the “hospital.”\n\nThe physicians and trustees agree that the beds they are renting at Seattle General Hospital are for children in need and that families with the means must pay for treatment. For example, unemployment when the father is able-bodied disqualifies a child for charity care.\n\nOpen for Business\n\nA Patient Selection Committee made up of Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association trustees and a physician assesses patients’ resources and circumstances through interviews.\n\nThe selection committee – whose members are called Lady Bountifuls – actively searches the community for children who are sick or on crutches.\n\nIn its first year of operation in 1907, the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association treats 13 children on its ward at Seattle General Hospital at a cost of $1,000. Patient cases include curvature of the spine, congenital dislocation of the hip, bowed legs, club feet, flat feet, rickets, malnutrition and paralysis resulting from tuberculosis of the spine, hip and knee.\n\nThe Patient Selection Committee declines to take on 17 other cases that year due to concerns about infectious diseases, “weak-mindedness” and hospital stays estimated to be over two years.\n\nBirth of the Guilds\n\nThe Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association’s Membership Committee solicits charitable contributions to pay for the beds at Seattle General Hospital. By March 1907, 105 citizens buy $10 memberships in the association.\n\nAt a luncheon in the summer of 1907, trustees Olive Roberts and Betsey Wilson pitch the idea of starting neighborhood fundraising guilds to Anna Clise.\n\nThe Guild Committee meets regularly with representatives of all the guilds and reports on the financial condition of the Hospital Association, the work of the board and what items and services are needed.\n\nBy the summer of 1907, the board of trustees moves ahead with its vision to build a hospital.\n\nThe Search and Sale\n\nTrustees Maude Parsons and Betsey Wilson climb the water tower on top of Queen Anne Hill to scout for an appropriate site. From the catwalk, they see an undeveloped tract of land served by multiple streetcar lines. The location is also a safe distance away from Seattle’s smoky and unsanitary downtown – important, since fresh air is believed to be a key to recovery and health.\n\nOn June 11, 1907, the trustees approve the purchase of three lots on Queen Anne Hill for $5,670.10.\n\nScaling Back the Vision\n\nThe board envisions raising $50,000 to build a fully functional hospital, but they scale back their plans when a sharp recession hits the nation in 1907. The fallback plan unfolds as “Fresh Air House,” located at 114 Crockett Street – a convalescent house where Children’s Orthopedic Hospital patients recover from surgeries performed at Seattle General Hospital.\n\nThe construction budget is set at $2,500, although the final project comes in under budget at $2,128.53.\n\nNeighborhood Opposition\n\nWhen the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association’s plans for Fresh Air House become known, several neighbors near the new site object that the presence of “deformed children” will disturb their quiet surroundings and depress their property values. They argue that pregnant women in the neighborhood will suffer risks to their own unborn babies if they view crippled children.\n\nThe neighbors draft an ordinance that all children convalescing after surgery be sent to the “Pest House” on Seattle’s Beacon Hill – an infirmary where the county sends citizens with contagious diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis.\n\nFortunately, the city engineer supports the association’s mission and the trustees receive the needed building permits.\n\nA Place of Their Own\n\nOn June 1, 1908, Fresh Air House opens its doors.\n\nIt is a simple cedar-shingled house with one fireplace, two sleeping porches with awnings, three bedrooms able to hold up to a dozen beds, a doctor’s room, a room for bandaging and casting, a kitchen, a combined dining and reception room and a basement where the matron nurse takes a room.\n\nThe physicians serving Fresh Air House order the cook to give patients the best food available in local markets so that the children have the strength to recover from surgery.\n\nThe trustees manage everything – except for the care of patients – from gardening to finances. Pound parties – where the price of admission for the general public to visit Fresh Air House is one pound of staple food per visitor – help fill the kitchen’s cupboards with flour, sugar, produce, jams and jellies.\n\nPatients are allowed a 90-minute visit on Wednesdays and Sundays with no more than two visitors over the age of 14. Nurses stand guard at the front door to confiscate sweets being brought in for patients.\n\nBy the end of 1908, Fresh Air House admits 39 children, including the daughter of a local physician who pays $10 to have her treated there.\n\nIn 1909, trustees display an exhibit of photographs documenting the work of Fresh Air House at the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition in Seattle – Washington’s first world’s fair.\n\nFirst Hospital Director\n\nIn 1909, nurse Lillian Carter, called “Mama Lillian” by the children, becomes the first “superintendent” of Fresh Air House – a title held by hospital directors for the next 45 years (all of whom are nurses).\n\nThat same year, the Washington State Legislature requires nurses to be certified and designates the title of Registered Nurse to those who complete two years of study.\n\nFocus on Pediatrics\n\nIn 1909, surgeon Casper W. Sharples recruits Dr. George McCulloch to see patients at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital. McCulloch, the first pediatrician west of the Mississippi, broadens the scope of the hospital and the types of patients admitted.\n\nBy 1910, physicians have a better understanding of nutritional fluid-electrolyte disorders and infectious diseases. McCulloch demonstrates that the hospital can treat many conditions other than orthopedic ones.\n\nOrthopedics, ophthalmology and dentistry are the first specialty services at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital. Physicians leave their private practices for several hours each week and travel to Fresh Air House to treat patients.\n\nFirst Home Care and Social Services\n\nIn 1910, cases of poliomyelitis (polio) surge in Seattle, leaving large numbers of children with motor paralysis and atrophied skeletal muscles. Since Fresh Air House prohibits contagious disease cases, the trustees hire Hortense Marion to visit sick children at home.\n\nNurse Marion instructs parents on their children’s polio care and also visits orthopedic patients after hospital discharge.\n\nA Proper Hospital\n\nSuccessful fundraisers, bequests and the timely donation of property bordering Fresh Air House allow the trustees to commission the construction of a three-story brick hospital complete with an operating room, sun porch and enough space to accommodate 70 patients. The total cost is $76,000. The structure is designed to permit the addition of a fourth floor and two additional wings in the future.\n\nOn March 15, 1911, trustees and 3,000 supporters dedicate the building.\n\nThe Seattle Times calls the new Children’s Orthopedic Hospital the most modern and well-equipped hospital on the West Coast; yet no sooner does the hospital open than the trustees organize a community pencil sale to finance a much-needed elevator so that nurses do not have to carry patients, meals and supplies up and down three flights of stairs.\n\nFresh Air House becomes a nursing residence and staff annex through the 1940s.\n\nExpanded Focus\n\nIn 1912, the trustees open the hospital to patients for nonorthopedic surgeries such as tonsillectomies and appendectomies.\n\nTeachers and Preachers\n\nOne of the first staff members at Fresh Air Cottage is a kindergarten teacher. This emphasis on education continues in the new hospital with Seattle School District teachers who provide students with daily lessons.\n\nMany patients have skeletal problems that require months of bandaging and positioning. Nurses keep notes on the slow progress of patients’ orthopedic illnesses. Two years of nurses’ notes are kept on a single index card!\n\nIn addition to daily physical therapy, patients receive frequent visits from clowns and storytellers and are well supplied with books, music, games and toys; however, movies are strictly forbidden.\n\nStudent nurses from Seattle General Hospital also provide a free source of labor for the hospital and another important diversion for patients.\n\nIn 1913, trustee Elizabeth Fischer recruits John L. Taylor as a volunteer Sunday school teacher, and he leads Bible instruction classes for the next 25 years – well into his 80s. Taylor’s successors continue to provide spiritual support from a Judeo-Christian perspective until the early 1990s, when the chapel becomes a place of meditation inclusive of all faiths.\n\nOur Founder Retires\n\nAnna Clise resigns from the board in 1915 after eye surgery for glaucoma results in her blindness. The board elects Anna Founder and Honorary Trustee before she and husband James move to Altadena, California, on the instructions of her physician.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Anna's daughter, Ruth Clise Colwell, joins the board.\n\nAssistance: Government and Retail\n\nIn 1915, charity cases fill 80% of the beds at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital, and the trustees look for creative ways to pay for nursing staff and other operating costs, such as food.\n\nThey lobby county commissioners to pay some of the costs of care for poor patients from their jurisdictions. Eventually, the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association receives $150 per month from Seattle’s King County for local indigent children, and $1.50 from the territorial governor of Alaska for each Alaska Native patient.\n\nAfter World War I, the trustees also open two profitable businesses staffed by volunteers: a café and a thrift shop. By 1924, the combined revenue from these two ventures covers half of the hospital’s payroll for 15 nurses.\n\nThe Advent of World War\n\nIn 1918, the United States government drafts nine of the hospital’s volunteer physicians and some of its nurses. Trustees cut costs by dispensing with nicely published annual reports and dig deep into their own pockets to pay for heating oil. They also organize a Melting Pot drive to collect scrap metal for the war effort. Charitable donations to the hospital dip to an all-time low.\n\nA Controversial Windfall\n\nThe trustees receive an unusual bequest from Samuel S. Pinschower. Upon his death, the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association inherits Pinschower’s diamond jewelry and the Midway Hotel – a notorious establishment that includes a gambling den, three saloons and a brothel! The trustees receive much-needed cash from rents and the sale of these assets.\n\nSurgical Certification\n\nThe Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association secures certification from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) after they recruit a volunteer pathologist and hire a stenographer to manage doctors’ reports and patients’ records. They are proud to receive a Class A rating from ACS after implementing Grand Rounds – weekly conferences for medical staff.\n\nFacility Expansion Continues\n\nAs physicians return from World War I and begin referring new cases from their restored practices, Children’s Orthopedic Hospital exceeds its capacity of 71 patients. The board begins construction of the hospital’s fourth floor and purchases two lots and a house next to the hospital. Skinner Cottage, also called Sunshine House, adds 14 beds to the hospital and is connected to the main building by a glassed-in playroom.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1920, there are major changes in the understanding of infectious diseases, including diphtheria, tetanus, measles, chicken pox and smallpox. In 1918, the trustees create an infectious disease ward with proper isolation and prevention measures, partly in response to the influenza epidemic that takes the lives of 1,003 Seattle residents.\n\nSecond Generation\n\nIn the early 1920s, the second generation of trustees begins to join the board:\n\nFrances Skinner Edris, daughter of trustee Jeanette Skinner\n\nDorothy Stimson Bullitt, daughter of trustee Harriett Stimson\n\nOlive Kerry, daughter of trustee Katherine Kerry\n\nRuth Clise Colwell, daughter of founder Anna Herr Clise\n\nThe First Logo\n\nTrustee Betsey Wilson sees an emblem in a newspaper advertisement for a local bank and convinces the board to adopt it as the hospital’s official symbol. It is an oval Italian Renaissance medallion of a swaddled infant. The board unofficially christens the symbol the “Bambino.”\n\nLess than 10 years later, in 1932, the new American Academy of Pediatrics adopts the same logo.\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nTrustee Frances Skinner Edris passes away 24 hours after giving birth to a daughter. Stunned trustees and community members donate generously in her memory, and in 1924, the Frances Skinner Edris Nurses’ Home opens on hospital property with room for 40 nurses.\n\nNew Leadership\n\nIn February 1926, the trustees introduce orthopedic surgeon Dr. Charles F. Eikenbary as Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s new chief of staff – an unpaid position.\n\nEikenbary takes the job on the condition that the hospital focus solely on orthopedic conditions and clear its wards of patients with infectious diseases.\n\nSeven years later, Eikenbary cuts his finger during a surgery. The wound heals, but his demanding schedule at the hospital does not allow him to regain his strength. Pneumonia follows, and he dies on December 31, 1933.\n\nAfter Eikenbary’s untimely death, physicians return to treating non-orthopedic cases. The trustees wait for eight years before they name Dr. Herbert Coe chief of staff in December 1941.\n\nCorner Cupboard\n\nTrustee Dorothy Stimson Bullitt envisions a money-maker for Children’s Orthopedic Hospital modeled after the Women’s Exchange in San Francisco: an outlet for high-quality craft items made by women at home. When the board denies her seed money to fund the project, she takes a $200 loan from the hospital association against future profits and opens The Corner Cupboard in downtown Seattle.\n\nIn its first month in December 1926, the shop nets more than $1,000.\n\nThe Corner Cupboard remains a unique downtown Seattle institution until 1989, the very same year that Bullitt, a hospital supporter for 67 years, passes away.\n\nA New Wing\n\nEikenbary and the board press forward to build a new east wing, which includes demolition of the Fresh Air House and the Sunshine Playroom. Friends of Children’s Orthopedic Hospital pledge the astronomical amount of $250,000, but the actual fulfillment of those pledges comes up short.\n\nWith the help of an anonymous donor and a bank loan, the new wing opens in January 1928. Years later, the donor is revealed to be aviation pioneer William E. Boeing.\n\nBecause patients live at the hospital for many weeks at a time, the staff place great emphasis on education, play, exercise and physical therapy. The new wing features:\n\nAn outpatient department with offices and exam rooms\n\n80 more inpatient beds\n\nA shop for making orthopedic braces\n\nNew operating and waiting rooms\n\nA playroom with large fireplace\n\nA therapy pool with overhead suspension system for physical therapy\n\nThe Calm Before the Storm\n\nBy 1929, the average stay at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital is 52 days. Some children stay for years as they undergo multiple surgeries to straighten spines and legs.\n\nSnapshot of Children’s Orthopedic Hospital in 1929\n\nHas treated more than 15,000 children since the hospital’s inception\n\nHas one of the nation’s first dedicated pediatric surgeons\n\nIs at the top of the American Academy of Surgeons’ list of Class A hospitals across the United States\n\nEmploys 104 staff members, including 53 nurses\n\nHas 150 inpatient beds\n\n60 patients attend school in the hospital.\n\n90% of patients receive free care, which is supported through hospital association dues, gifts, investment income and volunteer labor.\n\nDepends on volunteer surgeons, physicians, dentists and other medical professionals\n\nHas 51 guilds, 18 auxiliaries and affiliates in Tacoma, Olympia, Sumner, Snohomish and Yakima\n\nMore than 2,900 hospital association members pay dues to support hospital operations.\n\nOperates profitable café and thrift and crafts stores\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nThe trustees feel the first chill of the economic winter in spring 1930, when membership drives fall short and requests for free care and the number of serious cases spike.\n\nParents of some private patients resent the fact that their children and those of nonpaying families receive the same quality of care. Some staff members advocate segregating the two classes of patients. The trustees adamantly refuse.\n\nEmployees voluntarily surrender their paid vacations, yet the trustees must still cut salaries. Guilds disband and some of the hospital association’s most experienced leaders and volunteers resign to seek work to support their families. Nine out of ten patients continue to receive free care.\n\nEven during the leanest times, trustees continue to write personal thank-you letters to donors, volunteers and guild members.\n\nIn 1935, trustees borrow $50,000 from the endowment to keep the hospital afloat. The hospital jumps from an $8,000 deficit to a $19,000 surplus in 1939 – more paying patients and generous donations signal the end of the Great Depression.\n\nThe American College of Surgeons heaps praise upon Children’s Orthopedic Hospital for maintaining its quality of care during the Depression, and other hospitals look to Seattle as a model.\n\nCreative Financing\n\nIn 1932, the board launches its first Penny Drive – a door-to-door effort that nets the hospital $7,000. It takes two tellers at Washington Mutual Savings Bank most of two days to count the profit.\n\nFor the next 52 years, on a designated Saturday in May, guilds, Elks, Rotarians, Eagles, Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts fan out across the state, asking hospital patrons to fill their envelopes, jars and cans with coins.\n\nIn 1938, the Mary Meyers Guild begins to sell appointment calendars – a useful product that keeps the Children’s Orthopedic name in the public eye all year long. To this day, the calendars continue to raise money for the hospital.\n\nMilestones\n\nHospital founder Anna Clise dies in California in February 1936. Although Clise has not been active in the hospital for 20 years, her commitment to children inspires all of those who follow. The trustees commission a bronze plaque in her memory.\n\nSix months later in August 1936, founding trustee and past president Harriet Stimson passes away.\n\nIn 1937, Ruth Clise Colwell, Anna’s daughter, is elected as board president.\n\nChristmas at the Orthopedic\n\nTrustees try to make the holidays festive since patients are separated from their families. Volunteers decorate a large tree in the playroom and a Seattle-area climbing club, The Mountaineers, hangs lights on the outside of the hospital.\n\nAll the children eagerly wait for Santa Claus, who comes with gifts for every patient – either delivered personally or tied in a bag at the foot of the bed.\n\nIn 1930, Neal Tourtellotte (son-in-law of trustee Elizabeth Powell) volunteers as Santa, a role he fills faithfully for the next 30 years. Beginning in 1972, auto dealer Phil Smart Sr logs 27 seasons as Santa.\n\nBoxers and Presidents\n\nFormer heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, a frequent and popular visitor to Children’s Orthopedic Hospital, suffers a knockout of his own at the hospital one Sunday morning in 1931.\n\nAs Dr. John LeCocq changes a young boy’s dressing on an open wound caused by a bone infection, Dempsey saunters over to watch. In the days before penicillin and sulfa, physicians put live maggots in wounds to eat away dead tissue. One look and Dempsey keels over and is out to the count of 10!\n\nWhile campaigning for president in 1932, New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt stops by the hospital to greet patients and is particularly impressed with the therapeutic swimming pool – a godsend for children rehabilitating muscles atrophied by polio.\n\nA year later, the Georgia retreat where Roosevelt undergoes hydrotherapy for polio sends Children’s Orthopedic Hospital a share of the proceeds from a benefit gala celebrating the new president’s birthday.\n\nA Double-Edged Sword\n\nOn September 1, 1939, German troops pour into Poland. That very same day, 30-year trustee Rose Gottstein, the hospital association’s first Jewish member, passes away.\n\nAfter the United States declares war on Japan in December 1941, the city of Seattle holds its first nighttime air-raid drill and requires the hospital to douse all lights or cover the windows. Physicians perform two appendectomies during that inaugural drill.\n\nAlthough displays of patriotism are at an all-time high, the trustees decline a gift of a large American flag to display in front of the hospital out of fear that Japanese bombers might mistake the building for a government facility.\n\nSome of the Northwest’s young men and women volunteering for military service are former Children’s Orthopedic Hospital patients. When one such young man is killed in action in the South Pacific, his grandmother donates the proceeds of his $10,000 GI life insurance policy to the hospital.\n\nWartime Shortages\n\nAs younger men and women join the services, those physicians and nurses not drafted must care for a growing caseload due to the wartime population boom in Seattle.\n\nOlder physicians such as Drs. John LeCocq, Jay Durand and Vernon Spickard continue to volunteer their services at the hospital. Almost every night, they perform surgeries with the help of a nurse anesthetist loaned by the U.S. Army. When she is shipped overseas, the surgery schedule is cut in half.\n\nWith consumer goods going to the war effort, steel braces from healed patients must be reused for other patients. Trustees send the hospital sugar ration books to Wenatchee and Yakima so guild members can continue to can fruits and jams for the hospital. Volunteer physicians see their private-practice patients at hospital clinics to save on gas.\n\nOn the bright side, growing defense payrolls allow more families to pay for their children’s care. (The 1943 advent of Blue Cross insurance in King County also gives some families help to pay for hospital expenses.)\n\nInterns and Residents\n\nWith most of the medical staff shipped off to war and a growing list of children waiting for hospital admission, the volunteer physicians lobby the board and receive approval to allow interns and residents to perform surgeries and staff clinics. The residents remain under the supervision of the volunteer physicians.\n\nVolunteers to the Rescue\n\nIn the past, few volunteers have been permitted into Children’s Orthopedic Hospital, for fear of contagion. Labor shortages associated with the war change all of that. On any given day in the early 1940s, as many as 100 volunteers are found in service at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital, doing everything from stockroom work and haircuts to patient transport.\n\nIn 1944, the Seattle Real Estate Board (now Seattle King County Realtors) names Children’s Orthopedic Hospital “Seattle’s First Citizen,” in recognition of the thousands of volunteers who gave their time to the hospital. This is the first of only two times the award has been given to an entire institution.\n\nSurprising Bequests\n\nIn the early 1900s, bachelor Alvah Henry Bedell Jordan and his partners buy the Everett Pulp and Paper Mill in Lowell, Washington. Although he lives alone, except for a housekeeper and cook, he is a giant in the business, civic and political affairs of the North Puget Sound area.\n\nIn 1942, Jordan dies and the board is surprised to find that he leaves most of his estate to Children’s Orthopedic Hospital in the form of a 20-year residuary trust – the largest bequest received since the hospital’s inception. By 1951, the estate is worth $4 million, and through the 1970s it pays the hospital more than $150,000 a year.\n\nLifelong bachelor Charlie Olson wills the farm he homesteads outside Auburn, Washington, to Children’s Orthopedic Hospital. After Olson passes away in 1942, the hospital sells the 80-acre pastureland to Clyde and Mamie Berryman.\n\nFifty-two years later, in 1995, son Harry Berryman inherits the property. He and his wife Judy, a 28-year member of the Milnora De B. Roberts Guild, decide to donate the property back to Children’s through a charitable remainder trust.\n\n“Everything is a plus when you’re involved in a guild. The rewards come from seeing the money raised directly benefit the hospital,” says Judy.\n\nMedical Spinoffs From the Battlefield\n\nNew surgical techniques developed for wounded soldiers are translated to pediatrics to heal burns, repair twisted limbs and correct other deformities.\n\nChildren with infections who once suffered and died now thrive with the widespread use of antibiotics, sulfa drugs and penicillin – drugs that were first given to soldiers in the field.\n\nThese medical advances make death in childhood a relatively infrequent event and help children’s hospitals become institutions of greater hope.\n\nDesigned for Children\n\nIn 1945, Superintendent Lillian Thompson looks for a way to soothe children awaiting operations. She transforms the hospital’s anesthesia room into the “Peter Rabbit Room,” a space decorated with storybook characters.\n\nLater, Thompson’s therapeutic interior designs are shown to hasten and improve recoveries – a design technique that continues at the hospital to this day.\n\nThe Bifurcated Board\n\nIn 1945, the guilds’ existence and influence requires the board of trustees to vote in a new governing structure in which the board president represents the guilds and the board chairman addresses the interests of the hospital.\n\nGrowing With the Region\n\nEven before World War II begins, Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s wards are packed with patients.\n\nWhen the war ends, GIs returning to Seattle take their veteran’s benefits and start families. With the advent of the post-war baby boom comes a huge demand for all services related to families – including medical care.\n\nNow, in 1945, closets and storerooms overflow, physicians must meet in the Playroom and the trustees surrender their board room for staff offices.\n\nThe hospital association buys an apartment house near the hospital and shuffles staff among available spaces with no appreciable relief to the overcrowded conditions.\n\nThe trustees begin discussing another facility expansion – and further broadening the hospital’s scope beyond orthopedic care.\n\nThe First Faculty\n\nAlso in 1945, the Washington State Legislature reviews plans to establish a school of medicine at the University of Washington – a proposal initiated years earlier by Dr. Vernon Spickard, a community pediatrician and physician leader at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital.\n\nIn 1947, the first class of medical students begins their training, and the medical school dean asks Children’s Orthopedic Hospital to be part of the curriculum.\n\nIn 1948, Dr. S. Allison Creighton is hired as a staff pathologist. As the first salaried full-time physician on the medical staff, Creighton spends one day a week at University of Washington instructing medical students and is one of the first Children’s Orthopedic Hospital physicians to take a teaching appointment there.\n\nA Great Find Not Without Dissension\n\nOnce the Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association Board of Trustees determines there is not enough space to build a new hospital at the current Queen Anne Hill location, trustee Dorothy Bullitt jumps at the chance to acquire a newly available 22-acre tract on Sand Point Way, not too far from the University of Washington. Since large tracts of land are becoming scarce in Seattle, she puts down a $25,000 deposit to hold the site without even consulting the rest of the board.\n\nOn June 14, 1946, board chairman Frances Owen breaks with tradition and asks that board members vote by secret written ballot on the $150,000 land purchase and $5 million estimate to build a new hospital. Only one trustee votes no – and only she knows her identity.\n\nWhen area residents get wind that a 170-bed hospital is being planned for their Laurelhurst neighborhood, they mount an organized resistance. More than 150 people attend a Laurelhurst Community Club meeting to hear Owen explain the hospital’s plans. They vote 87 to 65 to oppose the hospital’s rezone application to the city.\n\nUndaunted, Owen mobilizes guild members to attend official city hearings. She promises the City Council that the new hospital will be no more than two stories high, set well back from property boundaries and have adequate parking. With these assurances, the rezone application is approved.\n\nPutting Children’s on the Map\n\nIn 1948, Dr. Alexander (Sandy) Bill arrives at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital as one of the nation’s first pediatric surgeons trained under Dr. Robert Gross at Boston Children’s Hospital – the founder of pediatric surgery in the United States.\n\nBill is chief of pediatric surgery from 1966 to 1979 and establishes Children’s Orthopedic Hospital as one of the first and best residency training programs in pediatric surgery and a center of excellence for pediatric surgery. Bill also serves as chair of the Surgical Section of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nGuilds Open to Diversity\n\nSince Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s beginning, trustees honor their pledge to treat all children regardless of race or religion; however, membership in the all-white guilds is by invitation only, which leaves people of color only one option: underwriting “named beds” or “named rooms” without being able to take part in guild activities.\n\nBy 1950, times begin to change. African American residents in Seattle’s Central Area form the Idell Vertner Guild, named after a YWCA leader. In 1955, “a new colored guild” is named after Mary McCloud Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women.\n\nA New Campaign\n\nThe Children’s Orthopedic Hospital trustees and guild members begin in earnest on their $5 million campaign to build a new hospital – the largest fundraising goal for a single charitable project in Seattle’s 98-year history.\n\nThe board hires a public-relations director – a role previously filled by volunteers – to publicize the campaign. Industrialist Paul Pigott heads a committee of 24 prominent businessmen who commit to raising $1 million.\n\nBy January 1950, the campaign secures less than $3.5 million – partly due to an economic slowdown around U.S. involvement in the Korean War. The trustees consider delaying the project, but reason that they can qualify for priority in construction materials as part of national defense if they stay on schedule for a spring 1951 groundbreaking.\n\nBy fall 1951, the general outline of the new hospital is evident as workers pour concrete for the walls. Although the press reports regularly on construction progress, the community is not moved to help cover the $1 million–plus campaign shortfall. Trustees vote unanimously to borrow the needed balance, using the principal in the endowment as collateral.\n\nOn April 25, 1952, nine months after construction begins, the still-incomplete hospital complex is dedicated. The final cost is $4.6 million.\n\nThe hospital comes to be known as the Pink Palace, a name that references its exterior color.\n\nPreparing to Move\n\nMoving-company owner Claude Bekins arranges for the Truck Owners Association to donate their vehicles and members of the Joint Council of Teamsters donate their backs. Far West Taxi Company volunteers to deliver patients.\n\nFor several months prior to the move, only urgent or short-term cases are admitted and Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s census is gradually reduced to 56 children.\n\nTrustees develop a color-coded system for all hospital items so that movers will know exactly which entrance of the new hospital they should be delivered to. Volunteers tag everything from X-ray machines to bedpans. On the day of the move, even the patients wear tags!\n\nAn Amazing Day\n\nAt 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, April 11, 1953, moving vans with banners on their sides proclaiming “Operation Orthopedic” crowd the streets around Children’s Orthopedic Hospital on Queen Anne Hill.\n\nPatients who are able don their street clothes. Every child receives a sack lunch, and some clutch brightly colored balloons provided by the Far West Taxi drivers who will take them to their new home. Some children, including three premature infants, travel by ambulance.\n\nApproximately 1,000 people participate in the move, including teams of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts who hold signs at intersections, ready to direct drivers along the eight-mile route from Queen Anne to Laurelhurst.\n\nAs cabs and ambulances arrive at the new Laurelhurst facility, patients laugh and shout with excitement. Contractor Howard H. Wright asks board chairman Frances Owen to shield him from public view as he wipes away tears of pride.\n\nBy 2:30 p.m., all of the equipment is in place and the kitchen staff starts cooking dinner.\n\nAfter the new facility opens in 1953, the average hospital stay is seven days, down from 52 days in 1929. (By 2006, the average length of stay is five days.)\n\nShifting Traditions\n\nWith the hospital’s move to Laurelhurst, many accustomed practices begin to shift. The first to go is housing for nurses and a separate house for the hospital superintendent. Trustees cite cost savings as the reason, but the change also reflects women’s growing self-reliance.\n\nChief of staff Dr. Vernon Spickard summons the volunteer medical staff for an orientation and briefing at the new hospital. He hopes that at least 250 will attend and 420 show up – an indication of the prestige attached to staffing at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital.\n\nIn 1953, the hospital employs only two physicians – a pathologist and a radiologist. The rest of the hospital’s physicians are community doctors, including Spickard, who volunteer or discount their services for charity cases and maintain private practices that are not part of the hospital.\n\nThe dean of the University of Washington School of Medicine urges the trustees to employee a full-time chief of staff, and the trustees move cautiously toward the direct employment of more physicians.\n\nFirst Heart Procedure\n\nIn October 1953, Dr. Dean Crystal performs the hospital’s first heart catheterization – a procedure in which a tube is inserted into a patient’s arm and guided to the heart to repair malformed blood vessels.\n\nWithin six months, physicians at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital perform one of these operations each week.\n\nIs it good for the children?\n\nThe Children’s Orthopedic Hospital Association Board of Trustees continues to manage all details of the hospital, right down to deciding to purchase used mops instead of new ones. As frugal as the board can be, they never cut corners when the expense involves the care of children.\n\nAt one board meeting, the trustees put a hold on an order from the Seattle Fire Department to replace all of the glass in the nurses’ stations with more fire-resistant panes until money becomes available. The next item of business – an even greater financial request – comes from the surgeons, who ask for new lights in the operating rooms.\n\nTrustees promptly approve this request because the new lighting directly affects quality of care.\n\nThe Research Question\n\nResearch is a delicate subject at Children’s Orthopedic. While the board expects physicians to monitor the national development of new pediatric procedures gained through research, they are wary of participating directly in research lest the public think they are “experimenting” on children – especially poor children entrusted to their care.\n\nThis hesitancy is gradually eroded by mounting physician requests and the obvious benefits that research can bring to all children. In 1956, the trustees form a joint committee with doctors to fund small, discrete projects.\n\nBy 1959, antibiotics and other discoveries cut approximately 35 days out of the average hospital stay reported in 1929. The board is now firmly committed to research as one of the missions at the Orthopedic and to building separate laboratory space to accommodate projects.\n\nAt the same time, trustees are clear that research funds will not be drawn from resources for charity care.\n\nDoctor Docter\n\nBy the mid-1950s, Chief of Staff Vernon Spickard and other volunteer physicians are overwhelmed by the patient load at Children’s Orthopedic Hospital and the teaching demands imposed by the University of Washington.\n\nSpickard convinces the Medical Executive Committee to hire Dr. Jack M. Docter as the hospital’s first paid medical director to oversee patient care and hospital services. Docter’s likeable manner and his funny name are an instant hit with kids, and his skills and passion impress the city’s leading pediatricians.\n\nThe Innovative Administrator\n\nChildren’s Orthopedic Hospital administrator Eva Erickson is known for her logic, intelligence and a rare ability to conceptualize and implement better ways of delivering care.\n\nAmong the innovative medical practices Erickson institutes is the “coordinated care conference,” a meeting that brings together all of a patient’s care providers – physician, nurse, dietitian, teacher, psychologist, social worker – to develop an integrated plan of care that is tailored to that individual child.\n\nErickson also increases visiting hours so that families may see patients daily – a move that is immediately correlated to an improvement in patients’ emotional health.\n\nAdvances in Body and Mind\n\nIn October 1958, Drs. Robert A. Tidwell and Dean Crystal perform Children’s Orthopedic’s first open-heart surgery, on an 8-year-old girl.\n\nAlthough the surgery is successful, it is not without its risks; nationally, less than 50% of patients survive after surgery, but they have no other options for survival without it.\n\nIn the early 1900s, parents who came to the hospital with “feeble-minded” children received sympathy and were turned away. After World War II, advances in the understanding of child development and mental health spurred Children’s Orthopedic Hospital to hire its first psychologist to assist disfigured children in conjunction with the Cleft Palate Service.\n\nBy October 1955, the hospital’s Social Service Department opens a clinic for mental retardation. Volunteer psychiatrists, neurologists and pediatricians provide children with complete diagnostic care.\n\nIn its first year, the clinic evaluates 216 patients with a waiting list half as long. By 1959, the Pigott family’s Norcliffe Fund underwrites the salary of a full-time pediatrician for three years, demonstrating the need for children with mental retardation to receive pediatric specialty care.\n\nThe Birth of Mr. Yuk\n\nIn 1952, as America pushes for what one corporation calls “better living through chemistry,” more than 1,440 Americans die of accidental poisonings – more than the combined number claimed by typhoid fever, typhus, malaria, smallpox, scarlet fever and whooping cough.\n\nMany of these deaths are children who accidentally ingest cleaning products and pesticides.\n\nIn 1954, on the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Children’s Orthopedic Hospital establishes a Poison Control Information Center. Within two years, the center is training clinicians on how to handle poisonings.\n\nAlthough originally conceived as a resource for nurses and doctors, more and more parents call the center directly. In its first year, the center averages 90 calls a month; four years later, it averages more than 650 calls each month, mostly from parents.\n\nChildren’s toxicologist Dr. William O. Robertson takes over as medical director of the center in 1971. He is the first physician to receive permission to use the green Mr. Yuk logo from its creator, the Pittsburgh Poison Center. Once permission is granted, Robertson goes on to order a personal license plate bearing the name “MR YUK.”\n\nBy 1979, Children’s Orthopedic is spending $100,000 per year to maintain the Seattle Poison Center; by 1984 it is fielding some 60,000 calls a year.\n\nIn 1995, the center spins off from Children’s Hospital as the nonprofit Washington Poison Control Center. Children’s gives the center a parting gift of $280,000 to help it on its way.\n\nThe Tide of Research\n\nIn the 1960s, increased research funding from the National Institutes of Health spawn incredible strides in medical knowledge. Along with the development of intensive care units for acutely and critically ill children, new techniques and therapeutic measures enable physicians to provide the very best care to patients.\n\nWhat’s in a name?\n\nIn 1945, the idea of adding the identifier “medical center” to Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s name is first suggested by trustee Dorothy Bullitt.\n\nBy 1960, less than 15% of the hospital’s cases are orthopedic and Dr. Jack Docter, Children’s medical director, wants the word removed from the hospital’s title. He argues that many highly qualified pediatric interns, residents, researchers and non-orthopedic specialists are confused by the hospital’s name and pass up job opportunities.\n\nHowever, after spending half a century making “the Orthopedic” a household name in the Northwest, the trustees cannot make such a huge leap. In a compromise of sorts, the board formally changes the institution’s name to “Children’s Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center” on March 3, 1963.\n\nAs soon as the new name appears in medical and nursing journals, the hospital experiences a surge in intern and staff applications.\n\nAn Angel in Disguise\n\nResearch is a major activity that distinguishes a medical center from an ordinary hospital; yet the small amount of space dedicated to laboratories at the newly christened Children’s Orthopedic Hospital and Medical Center cannot begin to accommodate the growing backlog of proposed investigations.\n\nIn 1950, Dr. S. Allison Creighton becomes laboratory director and his Department of Clinical Laboratories has two assistants, one microscope and one small room.\n\nFortunately, an angel named Milnor de B. Roberts offers a temporary solution.\n\nUnmarried twins Milnor and Milnora de B. Roberts inherit substantial wealth and live in a large home near the University of Washington. Milnora is a longtime friend of the hospital and an early guild member. When Milnor’s twin dies in 1961, he asks Alice Sandstrom, Children’s business manager, how best to memorialize his sister.\n\nThe answer is laboratory space, and Milnor is happy to honor Milnora with a gift of $280,000 to the hospital. The new Roberts Wing opens in 1964, increasing lab capacity by 50%.\n\nThe following year Milnor dies and leaves an additional $434,000 to the hospital to aid future construction.\n\nMilnor’s gift jump starts the Orthopedic’s research growth. By the time Creighton retires in 1977, the laboratory has 95 specially trained employees and millions of dollars worth of specialized equipment.\n\nA National Resource\n\nDr. Jack Hartmann joins Children’s research team in 1964 as head of Hematology and Oncology and investigates treatments for cancers, including chemotherapy following surgery. He brings psychiatrists, social workers and nurses together with patients and their families to help them deal with the long, uncomfortable and not always successful therapies.\n\nHartmann also helps organize the Children’s Cancer Study Group, an organization that coordinates national research studies to find more effective cancer treatments.\n\nResearch Under Scrutiny\n\nDr. J. Bruce Beckwith moves into Children’s Orthopedic Hospital’s new Roberts Wing to take over teaching and science in the expanded laboratory. He begins to study a rare cancer that affects the kidneys of young children. After Beckwith prepares a detailed clinical description, the condition is named Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome after him and a colleague in Germany.\n\nWhile the hospital’s research role grows, the trustees actively monitor the research programs, continuing to fret over possible negative publicity. They bar clinical trials on patients lest the public think the hospital is “experimenting” on children.\n\nTaking a Public Stand\n\nIn 1952 and 1963, Seattle voters reject initiatives calling for the introduction of fluoride to public drinking water.\n\nAlthough the board is well aware of the research that shows the benefit of fluoride as a tooth-decay retardant, they choose to remain silent during election time. After the second initiative fails, Dr. Abe Bergman convinces the trustees that they have a public responsibility where matters of child health are concerned.\n\nIn 1968, with the support of Children’s Orthopedic’s chief of staff, the trustees formally endorse a third fluoride initiative and the measure passes with a solid majority. After this, the trustees create a Legislative Committee to guide future healthcare endorsements in the political arena.\n\nPolitical Medicine\n\nDr. Abe Bergman is the third in-house clinician to join the Children’s Orthopedic staff. Hired to lead the Outpatient Department, he was a patient at the Orthopedic at the age of 3.\n\nBergman makes his first public mark with an inquiry into “crib death.” Together with Drs. Bruce Beckwith, George Ray and Donald Peterson, they author a paper on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nIn 1965, the physicians organize a formal medical conference on SIDS, which in turn inspires major federal research funding via the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe SIDS research teaches Bergman the value of the legislative process in solving public health problems, and brings him to the attention of Washington state’s powerful U.S. Senator Warren G. Magnuson.\n\nIn the fall of 1966, the emergency room at Children’s Orthopedic sees a rash of young burn victims whose pajamas and nightgowns had caught fire. Bergman knows this clothing can be made safer.\n\nHe invites Magnuson to tour the burn ward at Children’s Orthopedic, and by 1967 the Flammable Fabric Act Amendment mandates flame-resistant sleepwear for children.\n\nHome Boy\n\nDr. Stanley Stamm, the Orthopedic’s second full-time house-based clinician, joins the staff fresh from medical school in 1953.\n\nStamm establishes the hospital’s first cardiopulmonary department and cystic fibrosis (CF) program. An outdoor enthusiast, he publishes studies on the value of recreation and fresh air for CF patients. These children, who do not survive beyond young adulthood in the 1960s, spend most of their waking hours struggling to clear their lungs of mucus.\n\nAfter starting a swimming program, Stamm even organizes a swim team. That activity works out so well that he begins to think CF kids might benefit from a summer camp experience.\n\nIn August 1967, Stamm, medical director Dr. Jack Docter (who now heads the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic), chief resident Dr. Ron Lemire and other Children’s staff members take 19 children with CF and other chronic conditions to a camp in Carnation, Washington, for a week. Parents are not invited, thus giving them a break from caregiving.\n\nThe Stanley Stamm Summer Camp allows children with chronic conditions to meet and take part in normal childhood activities. The camp also gives medical staff a window into the lives of parents of chronically ill children.\n\nIn 2016, the Stamm camp celebrated its 50th anniversary.\n\nStudying for the Future\n\nIn 1968, the trustees commission a study of the hospital and its future. Over a six-month period, consultants interview physicians and staff, examine floor plans and measure work flows.\n\nAt the conclusion of the study, consultants find some areas of the hospital lacking, particularly outpatient services, but among the community hospitals they evaluate across the nation, they find Children’s Orthopedic to be “unusually good.”\n\nThe consultants recommend many changes to keep up with the demands of the growing region:\n\nA 20-bed psychiatric facility\n\nA 30-bed rehabilitation facility\n\nA full-time dentist\n\nNew surgery rooms\n\nAn emergency room\n\nExpanded clinic facilities\n\nA research wing for cancer, immunology and transplantation\n\nIt takes most of the 1970s and $34 million to turn the consultants’ recommendations into reality.\n\nIn 1971, a private room is $60 per day, an X-ray is $10, minor surgery costs $50 and major surgery is $80.\n\nQuality Care With Dignity\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson’s Model Cities Program focuses on improving the physical and social needs of residents in urban areas with their direct participation.\n\nThe mayor enrolls Seattle’s Central Area in the federal program in 1967 and appoints an influential African American minister to run it. Neighborhood residents identify the creation of a free health clinic for children as one of their highest priorities.\n\nOutpatient Department Director Dr. Abe Bergman, who volunteers his services in the Central Area, convinces the trustees that Children’s Orthopedic should organize a clinic.\n\nThe sticking point over local control is resolved with the formation of a health advisory board, elected by neighborhood residents, which approves the hiring of all clinic staff members.\n\nThe board recruits pediatrician Dr. Blanche Lavizzo and dentist Dr. Peter Domoto to head the clinic. The federal government approves a $220,768 grant, and in 1970 Children’s Orthopedic signs a contract with the city for the administration and operation of the neighborhood health clinic.\n\nThe advisory board recommends that the clinic be named for community activist and healthcare task force member Odessa Brown, who had died of leukemia the year before. Brown often shared her harrowing experiences trying to find medical care as a poor black woman.\n\nThe Odessa Brown Clinic opens its doors in May 1970 with very little publicity. Lavizzo coins the clinic’s motto, “Quality care with dignity.”\n\nA unique element of the clinic is the employment of community health assistants from the immediate neighborhood. The assistants help families make and keep appointments, handle transportation to and from the clinic and navigate the social service system.\n\nThey are an invaluable bridge to the community, helping neighborhood residents overcome the cultural gulf between those who need treatment and those who provide it.\n\nAn Official Rainmaker\n\nIn 1969, the board’s Development Committee suggests hiring Paul Harris, an experienced and well-connected local fundraiser.\n\nAt first, many trustees recoil at the idea of “professionalizing” a function they handle personally with traditional appeals such as the Penny Drive, Pound Party and Pencil Sale. They worry that the hospital will appear too commercial in the eyes of the community.\n\nWithin six months of hiring Harris, their resistance is overcome. He outlines a program to negotiate terms of life-income gifts, gift annuities, pooled income agreements and charitable remainder gifts – all new ways of meeting both donor and hospital needs.\n\nThat same year, King County’s largest employer, the Boeing Company, lays off 7,500 workers before Christmas.\n\nMore and more families appear at the Orthopedic’s clinics with no regular physician. The cost of free care rises to $2.5 million in 1971, while the books bleed $500,000 in red ink.\n\nThe “Boeing Bust,” when the company’s payroll shrivels from 100,000 to 40,000, persists through 1973.\n\nBailing Water\n\nIn 1973, hospital donations cover the entire cost of uncompensated care ineligible for Medicaid or insurance. By 1983, donations cover just 35% of the cost. Children’s Orthopedic must make up this shortfall by using investment income and other revenues.\n\nBecoming a Regional Specialty Center\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, most of the hospitals in Seattle, including the University Hospital, close their pediatric services.\n\nWith the majority of sick children being sent to Children’s Orthopedic, the hospital develops outstanding specialized support for pediatric care – from skilled pediatric nurses and anesthesiologists to laboratories, radiologists and dedicated volunteers.\n\nCommunity surgeons operate at Children’s Orthopedic because of the specialized pediatric nursing and high-quality pediatric anesthesiology, which significantly improves surgical outcomes. Most community physicians want their patients to be cared for at Children’s Orthopedic, the place where pediatric care is more sophisticated on all levels.\n\nIt is at this point in the early 1970s that Children’s Orthopedic begins to deliver care to all children across the region who require the most advanced specialty care.\n\nSTRIDING Forward\n\nThe Boeing Bust levels off by 1973 and the Puget Sound economy begins to rebound, thanks to federal funds for public works and services projects pumped in by the state’s U.S. senators – Henry M. (“Scoop”) Jackson and Warren Magnuson.\n\nChildren’s Orthopedic is once again bursting at the seams. Operating rooms strain to accommodate the 15-to-20–member teams now needed for complex procedures such as organ transplants. The original “in and out” board at the main entrance can only accommodate half of the 600 physicians with hospital privileges.\n\nIt’s been six long years since consultants recommend many improvements so that the hospital can keep pace with regional demand. The trustees are eager for another expansion. In 1974, they kick off a new fundraising campaign with a groundbreaking for a new five-story wing that will double the hospital’s floor space.\n\nNamed STRIDE – Surgery, Treatment, Rehabilitation, Intensive Care, Development, Education – the campaign raises $15 million, which is more than six times the next largest amount raised to that point in the Northwest.\n\nIn 1976, the hospital celebrates the amenities of the new wing, including a swimming pool; a 12-bed psychiatric ward; new pediatric and neonatal intensive care units; improved radiology facilities; remodeled surgical and emergency facilities; new clinic space; a model home to help train disabled children; and a 24-hour pharmacy.\n\nBy 1978, the construction is finished with a complete retrofit of the original building. The whole project tops out at $33.4 million, but the region has a new medical center with 193 beds and specialty and outpatient clinics that can accommodate more than 100,000 patient visits per year.\n\nOperation Saigon\n\nOn April 3, 1975, a chartered flight sponsored by Holt Children’s Services in Eugene, Oregon, lands at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. On board are more than 400 Vietnamese children orphaned during the Vietnam War.\n\nAfter finishing their 9,000-mile journey, the children – mostly infants and toddlers – receive medical exams. Within hours of arriving in Seattle, 16 babies are sent to Children’s Orthopedic with ailments including pneumonia, malnutrition, congenital heart conditions and meningitis.\n\nOne pneumonia patient dies, but the others survive and make their way to adoptive parents all over the United States.\n\nA Formal Relationship\n\nSince 1953, when Children’s Orthopedic moves to within two miles of the University of Washington School of Medicine, itself founded in 1946, leaders from both sides try to figure out a reasonable affiliation between the two institutions.\n\nChildren’s Orthopedic benefits from the University of Washington’s academic medical faculty and student interns from nursing, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and social work.\n\nThe University of Washington benefits from having a well-established pediatric facility so close for teaching and patient referrals.\n\nIn 1971, after years of tense discussions leading nowhere, representatives from both organizations resume talks in Clearwater, Florida, where the American Association of Medical Schools hosts a program to help medical schools solve problems.\n\nThere, far from daily distractions and internal politics, the two groups spend five days listening to each other, working on the 29 items on their joint list and gradually building trust.\n\nOver those five days, the group builds a cohesive team, then returns to Seattle to share their work with their respective institutions.\n\nFor the trustees, some of the elements of the agreement are easy to accept: University and Harborview Hospitals will move their pediatric inpatient and most outpatient services to the Orthopedic, making it the pediatric center of the Pacific Northwest; basic research will remain at the University of Washington.\n\nThere are also financial advantages for the Orthopedic. Affiliation with the university opens the door to new research funding and other government subsidies. And, the University of Washington promises to pay Children’s Orthopedic for its educational services to medical students and interns.\n\nThe trustees also reject some points: that a representative from the university will sit on the Orthopedic’s board, and that the University’s chief of pediatrics will automatically serve as Children’s chief of staff.\n\nOn this last point, the trustees counter that the same individual can hold the post of chief of pediatrics at both institutions, which the university ultimately accepts.\n\nAt a March 1973 board meeting, chairman Kate Webster puts it to the trustees plainly: the affiliation agreement will improve the quality of patient care.\n\nThe debate continues for more than a year, but in the end the trustees formally adopt the affiliation agreement by unanimous vote on September 11, 1974.\n\nDespite many bumps in the road sorting out titles and lines of authority, Children’s Chief of Staff Dr. Jack Docter reports an improvement in patient care in just two years after the agreement is adopted. He attributes this fact to Children’s physicians having university medical experts to call upon in many different fields, especially for difficult cases.\n\nThe Reorganization\n\nIn 1978, the University of Washington School of Medicine dean convinces Dr. Ron Lemire to give up his office and lab at the university and take a job at Children’s Orthopedic, where he becomes director of Inpatient Services, reporting to both the dean and Children’s Medical Director Dr. Jack Docter.\n\nOne of Lemire’s first acts is to insist that community physicians assigned to the Orthopedic’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) be physically present to care for patients… or stop working there. Lemire argues that if a critically ill child’s condition worsens, they cannot wait until the volunteer physician is able to drop by the hospital.\n\nThe volunteer physicians try the new rules for a month and find that they cannot keep up with their work and with their private practices. The end result is that in-house physicians take over the ICU – a change that signals a big step away from “volunteer” charity care.\n\nAt the same time, Board Chair Kate Webster begins promoting the idea that the board should hire a single individual – a chief executive officer or CEO – to run the hospital.\n\nIn the late 1970s one cannot turn a corner without finding a trustee conferring with a doctor or nurse, comforting a patient, delivering a food tray, painting a wall or pruning a shrub. In between chores, the trustees set policy and make all of the financial decisions for an organization with a $30 million annual budget and nearly 1,000 employees.\n\nFacing the retirement of four key administrators, the board agrees to appoint a single “executive director” to run the entire operation with authority to hire their own management team: medical director, chief financial officer and chief administrator. Further, all hospital departments will report to the executive director.\n\nThe First CEO\n\nWhen a search firm contacts Treuman Katz about a CEO opportunity at Children’s Orthopedic in Seattle, he politely declines. After all, Katz, executive administrator of Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, runs a 1,000-bed hospital where indulging celebrities is a perk of the job.\n\nHowever, the recruiter is persistent, and the 36-year-old Katz finally agrees to fly to the Northwest in late May 1979 and meet key hospital leaders.\n\nEvery step of the way, Katz finds something to like and even to excite him.\n\nKatz decides that transforming a metropolitan pediatric hospital into a regional medical center that could serve thousands of children each year is an opportunity that he cannot pass up.\n\nHe steps into the new position of chief executive officer on September 10, 1979.\n\nInnovating for Children\n\nDr. Robert Hickman puts Children’s Orthopedic on the map in 1979 by devising new ways to use the catheter that now bears his name. Used for nutrition, blood draws and delivery of chemotherapy, the Hickman catheter eliminates the need for repeated needle sticks in children.\n\nHickman patents his catheter and donates a substantial share of his royalties to the hospital.\n\nThe Penny Drive Passes On\n\nHired in 1980, Doug Picha leaves his position as executive director of the Variety Club and comes to Children’s as director of community relations. He adds a direct-mail campaign to complement the Penny Drive and receives a standing ovation from the board of trustees when he reports that this new combined approach nets the hospital $200,000.\n\nBy 1984, guild members are finding door-to-door fundraising less successful, as many householders are no longer home in the evenings and on Saturdays. Picha recommends that the Penny Drive be retired in favor of more cost-effective fundraising strategies such as direct mail and cultivation of bequests. The board reluctantly agrees and the Penny Drive joins the Pound Party as a cherished piece of Children’s heritage.\n\nThis once-profitable fundraiser is memorialized as the name of one of the hospital’s major thoroughfares, Penny Drive.\n\nChildren’s Hospital Foundation\n\nIn 1982, Community Relations Director Doug Picha becomes director of the Children’s Hospital Foundation when this separate fundraising entity is established with a new 15-member board of trustees.\n\nIn forming the foundation, the hospital trustees retain control of the hospital endowment – donations of money and property that are invested to create future income, rather than cover current costs or capital projects.\n\nFoundation trustees set a minimum of $25,000 for an endowment, and later raise this amount to $50,000. By 2005, more than 350 separate endowments generate income for uncompensated care, research, education – and even toys.\n\nAn Aerial Solution\n\nHarborview Medical Center develops a region-wide emergency care plan so that critically ill patients are transported by the Seattle Fire Department’s Medic One emergency vehicles to hospitals best equipped and organized to treat their conditions. Children’s Orthopedic is assigned responsibility for the emergency care of all younger patients.\n\nUnfortunately, even Medic One gets stuck in traffic, and for critically ill patients, minutes are often a matter of life and death.\n\nA regional planning team – including Children’s inpatient director and licensed pilot Dr. Ron Lemire and leaders from Harborview, the University of Washington Medical Center and Providence Medical Center – begins to investigate aerial transport options for critically ill patients.\n\nOn May 17, 1982, hospital leaders formally launch Airlift Northwest at Boeing Field with a twin-engine turboprop airplane that can reach most of Washington, Alaska, Montana and Idaho (WAMI) without refueling.\n\nChildren’s trains four nurses to care for pediatric patients in flight with the help of a communications system that keeps them in contact with a physician throughout the trip. Any physician within the four-state WAMI region can request that a child be evacuated to Children’s Orthopedic. If the mission is deemed appropriate, the team, including an on-call nurse, can be airborne within one hour of dispatch.\n\nWith the success of this new aerial transport system, the four hospitals investigate the use of helicopters for emergency transport and apply to the city of Seattle for permits to establish helipads at their own facilities.\n\nSome of Children’s Orthopedic’s Laurelhurst neighbors object to the noise and safety of landing a helicopter so close to their homes and turn to legal and political means to block city approval of the helipad. The controversy descends into a whirlpool of litigation, hearings, press coverage and acrimony.\n\nOn September 28, 1992, after eight years of conditional use permits and environmental impact studies, the Seattle City Council grants final approval of a helipad just steps away from Children’s Emergency Department. In 1997, the Laurelhurst Community Club expresses its support for the helipad.\n\nAirlift Northwest becomes a nonprofit entity in 2002, with Children’s owning a one-sixth interest in this vital emergency transport service.\n\nFrom Town to Gown\n\nIn July 1981, Children’s Orthopedic CEO Treuman Katz hires Dr. John Neff from Johns Hopkins as medical director after Dr. Jack Docter retires.\n\nNeff is instrumental in transforming the hospital’s medical staff from community-based physicians who volunteer their time at Children’s Orthopedic to full-time hospital-based physicians associated with the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nSoon after Neff arrives at Children’s, the agency that credentials hospitals takes issue with the fact that Children’s surgical chief, Dr. Peter Mansfield, is a community physician with his own practice who serves at the hospital only part time.\n\nPrior to the early 1980s, community surgeons operate on patients at Children’s Orthopedic because of the outstanding pediatric anesthesiologists and the remarkable nursing staff. Many of these surgeons also receive pediatric surgical training at the hospital. For example, Mansfield, who starts modern cardiac surgery at Children’s Orthopedic, trains many surgical residents who go on to open private practices in the region.\n\nWhen CEO Treuman Katz offers Mansfield a full-time position as chief of surgery, Mansfield declines to give up his practice; however, community physicians such as Mansfield continue to attend at the hospital, serve on hospital committees and participate in search committees for hospital leadership.\n\nChildren’s Orthopedic also makes a commitment to the community not to get into the business of pediatric primary care, except in areas where community pediatricians do not practice, such as at the Odessa Brown Clinic in Seattle’s Central District.\n\nIn 1983, Neff and Dr. Jack Shilling, chair of the University of Washington Department of Surgery, hire Dr. David Tapper away from Harvard Medical School. Tapper comes on board as chief of surgery at Children’s Orthopedic and head of the Division of Pediatric Surgery at University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\nOver his 19-year tenure at Children’s, Tapper bridges the gap between the University of Washington Department of Surgery and Children’s Orthopedic. He transforms a regionally respected surgical department into a fully accredited, nationally sought-after surgical training program that includes every surgical specialty. He also serves as president of the American Pediatric Surgical Association.\n\nFit for a Queen\n\nChildren’s Orthopedic receives a singular honor when Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Prince Philip visit Children’s as part of their royal tour of the West Coast.\n\nIn addition to greeting patients, trustees, physicians and staff, the queen meets honorary trustee Helen Tremper Lane, age 98. The hospital guest book records the event with the signature “Elizabeth R, March 7, 1983.”\n\nOver the years, hundreds of sports personalities, TV stars and other celebrities visit patients.\n\nFrom Variety Club to Miracle Network\n\nIn 1968, leaders of the Variety Club, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping sick, disabled and disadvantaged children, approach KIRO-TV with the idea for a telethon to benefit children’s charities, including Children’s Orthopedic.\n\nIn its first year, the telethon raises $90,000 for a few days’ work – about half what the Penny Drive brings in over a period of months.\n\nBy 1984, 22 children’s charities share in the Variety Club Telethon – a Seattle and Northwest tradition. The telethon brings friends of Children’s Orthopedic together, including physicians, patients, guild members and community groups. A group of working mothers from a Seattle topless club even appears on TV to drop off donations they collect from club patrons!\n\nAlthough the Variety Club Telethon is a local tradition, the board makes the difficult decision to stop Children’s participation in favor of participating in the Osmond Foundation’s Children’s Miracle Network.\n\nThe new agreement with Children’s Miracle Network is a much better arrangement for the hospital. Children’s pays a fee to support the national Children’s Miracle Network broadcast, but in turn, the hospital keeps all the proceeds raised in the region.\n\nIn June 1985, the first Children’s Miracle Network Telethon airs on KOMO-TV, and Children’s Orthopedic is the sole Northwest beneficiary.\n\nBy 2004, Children’s Miracle Network raises $2.4 billion toward uncompensated care at 170 hospitals nationwide, and Children’s share is $7.2 million.\n\nA Home Away From Home\n\nFour years after the first Ronald McDonald House opens in Philadelphia in 1974, Children’s Orthopedic and Candlelighters – an association of parents who have lost children with cancer – kick off planning for a similar residence near the Orthopedic.\n\nAfter several years of bureaucratic maneuvering to acquire a vacant tract of land owned by the U.S. Coast Guard and located across Sand Point Way NE from the hospital, the group builds a place for families to stay while their children undergo cancer treatment. On December 13, 1983, Ronald McDonald House finally accepts its first families. The 22-bedroom facility features private bathrooms, shared kitchen, dining, living, laundry and indoor/outdoor play facilities.\n\nIn 1986, Children’s Orthopedic opens Kids Bowling for Kids Village, a 10-unit parent housing facility on the same street, 40th Avenue NE. Construction costs are funded by the Washington State Bowling Proprietors Association, Variety Club of the Pacific Northwest and many community organizations. The facility’s name honors the hundreds of kids who bowl and collect pledges based on the number of pins they knock down. Kids Village expands to 23 total units in 1991. A little over a decade later, Ronald McDonald Charities of Western Washington and Alaska acquires this property.\n\nFormalizing the Research Mission\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the University of Washington School of Medicine agrees that all research grants held by faculty at Children’s should be administered at Children’s. Medical director Dr. John Neff recruits Jane Bogle to consolidate all research and grant activities into one administrative unit at Children’s.\n\nDuring her tenure, Bogle establishes research policies regarding patient safety (institutional review boards) and animal safety, and manages the planning and allocation of research space.\n\nParaplegic from birth, Bogle also does much to help Children’s become more sensitive to the needs of visitors and employees with physical challenges. During construction and remodeling projects, she personally surveys restrooms, carpeting and other building features to test their accessibility.\n\nA Community Resource\n\nIn 1985, Children’s Orthopedic opens the Children’s Resource Center to create and distribute information and training on childcare, first aid, nutrition, bicycle safety and sports medicine. The Resource Center expands to a telephone information service where parents speak with registered nurses who answer questions about illness and injury and help catch diseases and conditions early on.\n\nA new Parent Resource Room in the hospital provides an education center for parents and families.\n\nThe Second Name Change\n\nIn 1985, CEO Treuman Katz recommends dropping “Orthopedic” from the hospital's name. After devoting a year of study to the question, the board finds that the term confuses many people and no longer communicates the hospital’s purpose – less than 15% of the hospital’s cases are bone-related.\n\nOn April 23, 1986, the board approves the new name: Children’s Hospital and Medical Center.\n\nStrength in Numbers\n\nIn 1986, CEO Treuman Katz approaches his counterpart from Children’s Hospital in Denver about forming an alliance among pediatric hospitals to purchase supplies and save money.\n\nSoon, six hospitals from across the country form the Child Health Corporation of America (CHCA) with headquarters in Shawnee Mission, Kansas.\n\nUp in Smoke\n\nIn April 1986, smoking is banned in the cafeteria. The last permitted place left to light up inside the hospital is the staff lounge. By June 1989, the hospital becomes smoke-free.\n\nA New Wing\n\nChildren’s new Medical Pavilion opens in 1990.\n\nIn 1986, Children’s needs more research space, an improved emergency room and more area to accommodate specialty outpatient clinics and operating rooms. Administrators apply for a permit to build a 65,000-square-foot, four-story medical pavilion on the northeast corner of the hospital.\n\nAs a precondition of the building permit, the city of Seattle requires Children’s to draw up a traffic management plan to divert 35% of its employees out of single-occupancy vehicles and into carpools and buses. The city tells Children’s that if the plan fails to achieve its goal, the hospital will receive no more building permits – a limitation that is not imposed on any other institution in the city.\n\nThe transportation plan with carpooling becomes a part of hospital culture and Children’s employees meet every goal to reduce the number of cars parking at the hospital. The city issues the building permit.\n\nIn 1990, the $11 million Medical Pavilion, complete with whimsical hallway murals, beautiful floor mosaics, brightly colored paintings and welcoming animal statues, comes in on schedule and under budget.\n\nPriceless Friendships\n\nIn 1987, the board of trustees establishes the Children’s Hospital Guild Association as a separate entity with its own board of directors.\n\nGuild trustees Sharon Friel and Susie Albrecht want to hold the first guild association convention at the Westin in Seattle; however, the cost is a prohibitive $25,000.\n\nThey arrange to meet with Costco co-founders Jeff Brotman and Jim Sinegal to ask if the three-year-old warehouse chain might consider underwriting the guild event.\n\nFiguring their request is a long shot, they are floored when Costco agrees to pick up the tab! This first request leads to the formation of the Friends of Costco Guild, an annual charity golf tournament and a new patient care wing named for Sinegal’s wife, Janet.\n\nSince 1987, Costco leaders and the Friends of Costco Guild have raised more than $100 million for the hospital.\n\nIn 1988, the Washington wine industry and Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery decide to follow in the footsteps of the great vintners in Burgundy, France, who continue a tradition of auctioning barrels of wine to benefit the region’s main children's hospital.\n\nThe first auction raises under $20,000. After marketing the event as a showcase for Washington state wines, restaurant owners, wine collectors and wine retailers get involved. By 2006, the Auction of Washington Wines is one of the largest charity wine auctions in the United States and, with proceeds of $1.9 million, one of the hospital’s most important fundraising events. It has raised over $40 million for the hospital since its founding.\n\nOn April 25, 2017, the guild association celebrates its 30th anniversary.\n\nBirth of a Practice Plan\n\nPhysicians present the greatest challenge to CEO Treuman Katz. In the mid-1980s, close to 800 physicians are approved to practice at Children’s: community physicians who have private practices, house-based physicians who are salaried by Children’s and University of Washington School of Medicine faculty members.\n\nEach group has distinct professional and economic interests that come together in the Medical Executive Committee – a group that represents all the physicians practicing at Children’s. This committee advises the Board of Trustees, but does not report to it, the medical director or the CEO.\n\nIn 1980 more than half of the medical specialists at Children’s are full-time, either as part of the full-time house-based medical staff or as university faculty; however, 70% of the surgeons practicing at Children’s are from the community.\n\nUnlike the University of Washington Medical Center, Children’s remains an open-staff hospital with community physicians having full privileges based on their qualifications. Leadership of the clinical departments remains with the department chiefs at Children’s.\n\nMedical Director Dr. John Neff and the dean of the University of Washington School of Medicine, Dr. David Dale, work together to develop the basic principles of a practice plan – a corporate structure – under which all physicians practicing at Children’s Orthopedic will be integrated under the joint leadership of Children’s CEO and the UW School of Medicine dean.\n\nPhysicians are to be paid by the hospital with the hospital and university splitting the revenue evenly – an unprecedented agreement.\n\nIn March 1990, Children’s University Medical Group (CUMG) becomes the final practice plan structure that makes all physicians truly part of Children’s Orthopedic, not just transients passing through it.\n\nFirst and Only Service\n\nOn May 8, 1990, Drs. James Perkins and Robert Sawin perform the first pediatric liver transplant in the Northwest on a three-year-old Olympia, Washington, boy. Since that first surgery, Children’s continues to be the only pediatric liver transplantation provider in a six-state area.\n\nTaking the Address Out of Children’s\n\nSince the 1960s, Seattle’s share of the county population steadily declines as population growth in the surrounding suburbs increases.\n\nTo meet the demand for pediatric specialty services, Children’s expands its reach farther and farther outside of Seattle, so that families can access care without leaving their communities.\n\nBy the 1990s, Children’s is no longer defined by a single building at one location. It now encompasses satellite clinics and services and partnerships with many other institutions, including a neonatal intensive care unit at Providence Hospital in Everett; inpatient beds at Bellevue’s Overlake Hospital; outpatient clinics in Everett and Bellevue; and once-a-month clinics in smaller towns such as Mount Vernon, Port Angeles and Aberdeen.\n\nRe-Engineering to Save Costs\n\nBy 1993, managed care and rate caps on procedures create financial deficits that force Children’s to streamline treatments and cut costs, particularly for inpatient care.\n\nIn 1995, consultants analyze the hospital and recommend that it downsize from 200 beds to 65… or risk closure!\n\nHospital leaders embark on a program of “re-engineering” to cut expenses, a plan that includes departmental reorganizations.\n\nChief Operating Officer Andy Man organizes committees in all departments to identify cost savings and find more efficient ways to complete everyday tasks.\n\nIn one example, a committee of physicians, nurses and administrators finds that the hospital orders more than 800 different types of sutures to accommodate the individual preferences of surgeons. The committee comes up with 100 models that serve just as well – and saves the hospital precious resources.\n\nThe process of re-engineering lasts several years and produces some $18 million in savings, without compromising Children’s inpatient beds.\n\nA Deadly Bacterium\n\nBetween January 3 and 19, 1993, adults and children start showing up at emergency rooms in Western Washington complaining of severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea.\n\nUltimately, 50 children are sent to Children’s, where physicians and lab technicians work tirelessly on the Dialysis Unit to treat some of the patients for kidney failure.\n\nIn the lab, pathologist Dr. Kathy Patterson quickly and accurately identifies the bacterium E. coli 0157:H7 as the culprit, a critical step in treating patients who are in danger of death.\n\nWithin five days of being notified, state and county health investigators trace the cause of the outbreak to local Jack in the Box fast-food restaurants where tainted meat from California had been cooked at temperatures too low to kill E. coli.\n\nState officials document a total of 477 E. coli cases and new sanitation rules quickly follow, but not fast enough to save the lives of three children under the age of six, or to spare some survivors permanent kidney damage.\n\nHowever, it could have been much worse without Children’s Hospital’s fast medical detective work, collaboration with the Seattle–King County public health department and the treatment of scores of victims at the hospital’s Dialysis Unit.\n\nFirst Heart Transplant\n\nOn October 26, 1994, a 12-year-old boy from Everett, Washington, undergoes the first heart transplant at Children’s, and heads home three weeks later.\n\nA “Regional” Change\n\nTwo years after the re-engineering consultants predict that Children’s will close if it does not shrink, the hospital cannot keep up with demand for its inpatient beds, outpatient clinics and regional services.\n\nIn June 1997, the hospital sends a new message to the community. The old sign at its entrance is replaced to read “Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center.”\n\nTOBI to the Rescue\n\nIn 1978, Dr. Arnold Smith comes to Children’s to head the Infectious Disease program. He begins to investigate the use of antibiotics to fight the infections that threaten cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. He identifies the antibiotic tobramycin (TOBI) as the most effective drug; however, the needed dose can cause serious damage to children if injected intravenously.\n\nSmith concludes that administering the antibiotic in aerosol form can deliver the medicine directly to the lungs without any collateral damage and significantly increase the life expectancy of CF patients.\n\nHe and Dr. Bonnie Ramsey launch a clinical trial with patients from Ramsey’s CF Clinic. Excellent results led them to launch phase 2 at clinics around the nation. The results are remarkable, and in 1993 Smith and Ramsey publish their findings in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn 1997 – fully 10 years after Smith first thought of aerosolizing the antibiotic – the Food and Drug Administration approves TOBI. In 2003, Children’s sells the patent for TOBI for $11.8 million to Drug Royalty Corporation Inc.\n\nAn Alliance of Giants\n\nBy the early 1990s, Children’s has a small bone marrow transplant program. CEO Treuman Katz and Medical Director Dr. John Neff envision an alliance among Children’s, the University of Washington Medical Center and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) to leverage research-based cancer therapies and better coordinate ongoing research efforts.\n\nAfter years of discussions, the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance opens on October 22, 1997, with the following split in responsibilities: Fred Hutch manages research and operates a seven-story, $150 million outpatient clinic (finished in 2001); the University of Washington Medical Center cares for adult patients; and Children’s treats pediatric patients.\n\nA New Vision Statement\n\nIn 2003, the board of trustees update the hospital mission and adopt a new vision statement with the goal of making Children’s one of the five best pediatric medical centers in the United States. The statement affirms research as a key element in this drive for excellence.\n\nA New Era for Research\n\nIn November 2003, the board welcomes Dr. James B. Hendricks, Children’s Hospital’s first vice president for research and head of the new Research Administration division.\n\nIn collaboration with the pediatrician-in-chief and surgeon-in-chief, Hendricks manages research endowments and the staff who conduct pediatric research at Children’s, the University of Washington Child Health Institute, Harborview Medical Center and Fred Hutch.\n\nA Diversified Board\n\nIn June 2003, the Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center Board approves 12-year term limits for trustees – a hotly debated issue since trustee Mary Gates proposed term limits in 1981.\n\nIn November 2004, a 97-year-old tradition falls with the appointment of the first male trustees. At the same time, the board approves a bylaw change to allow the CEO and medical director to have ex-officio (non-voting) seats on the board.\n\nOn December 8, 2004, Dr. Rob Roskin becomes the board’s first male voting member.\n\nA New Level of Support\n\nIn January 2004, the five-story, 100,000-square-foot Janet Sinegal Patient Care Building opens with state-of-the-art facilities that add 42 inpatient beds and raise the hospital’s total capacity to 250 beds.\n\nAfrican safari murals; a meditation room and chapel; and a coffee shop and gift shop grace the main hallway in the new facility. Patient rooms, now mostly single-bed, feature pull-out couches so at least one parent can stay overnight.\n\nJanet Sinegal is the first person to serve simultaneously on all three of Children’s boards: the guild association, the foundation and the hospital. Together with her husband Jim, president and CEO of Costco Wholesale, they spearhead fundraising efforts involving Costco employees and vendors, resulting in significant contributions to Children’s. The Sinegals also give generously to Children’s on a personal basis.\n\nHalf of the $60 million cost of the new inpatient facility is paid for by donors, including $6 million raised by Children’s guilds.\n\nAn Ethical Voice\n\nIn 2004, Children’s opens the first bioethics center in the nation solely dedicated to the study of research and health care for children. The Center for Pediatric Bioethics is a podium for the complex bioethics challenges facing healthcare professionals, scientists, patients, families and the community at large.\n\nIn 2005, the center is dedicated to retiring CEO Treuman Katz.\n\nA Room of Their Own\n\nIn 2004, Children’s leases two buildings in downtown Seattle, adding 50,000 square feet of bench laboratory space and 40,000 square feet of clinical and health services research space to its research enterprise. The lease arrangements nearly triple the amount of space Children’s dedicates to bench laboratory research.\n\nResearch Firsts\n\nIn July 2003, Dr. Andrew Scharenberg and Children’s colleagues identify a magnesium transport protein that is essential to cell replication. The research results show that tumor cells containing the protein divide rapidly, while cells lacking the protein become magnesium-deficient and unable to divide.\n\nThe findings lay the groundwork for new approaches to treat cancers and immunologic diseases.\n\nIn April 2004, Children’s physician–researcher Dr. Dimitri Christakis provides the first evidence that early television exposure may be related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). His nationally acclaimed study finds that each hour of television watched per day at ages 1 to 3 increases the risk of attention problems such as ADHD by almost 10% by age 7.\n\nIn 2005, Christakis and colleagues find no scientific evidence that “educational” media products have any proven educational value for babies and toddlers.\n\nIn 2004, Children’s physician–researcher Dr. David Rawlings successfully shows that gene therapy can correct a form of primary immune deficiency disease (PIDD) known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) in mice for the lifetime of the animal. Gene therapy is a relatively new treatment, in which the correct version of a gene is inserted into cells to fix a genetic defect.\n\nA year later, Rawlings and his team identify the trigger that activates a pathway in T and B immune cells that leads to the survival and growth of these cells – a discovery that could lead to more effective treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases.\n\nIn 2004, Children’s physician–researcher Dr. Frederick Rivara determines that targeting teenagers with concentrated anti-smoking education campaigns and increasing the current cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1 could reduce the number of teenage smokers by 26%, and help more than 108,000 people in the United States survive to age 85.\n\nRegional Outreach\n\nIn 2005, Children’s residents and specialists spend 350 days in clinics and hospitals throughout Alaska, Montana, Idaho and rural Washington caring for children in their own communities.\n\nA Quarter Century of Leadership\n\nOn September 30, 2005, Children’s CEO Treuman Katz retires after 26 years of service. His tenure encompasses more than a quarter of the hospital’s history, and his leadership guides not only the tremendous growth of the institution, but the scope of healthcare services it delivers to the region’s children.\n\nKatz receives the 2005 Lifetime Achievement Award from the Washington Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization with the mission of improving health for the people of Washington state.\n\nCarrying Out the Bold New Vision\n\nAfter a nationwide search to replace CEO Treuman Katz, the board of trustees selects Dr. Thomas N. Hansen, former CEO of Columbus Children’s Hospital, to lead Seattle Children’s into its second century.\n\nWhen he begins his new post in October 2005, Hansen presses forward to achieve the vision conceived years earlier by the board of trustees and former CEO Treuman Katz – to eliminate pediatric diseases such as diabetes and congenital heart conditions so that children do not have to carry the burden of disease into adulthood.\n\n“Children's is clear about its vision and well-positioned to achieve it. I want to be part of its transformation,” Hansen says.\n\nWithin the span of one year, Hansen integrates the growth of clinical, research and education programs with a new strategic plan and acquires nearly half of the 1 million square feet of research space needed to advance pediatric research to a national level.\n\nA Prestigious Post\n\nIn 2005, Children’s physician–researcher Dr. Fred Rivara is elected to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academies for his study of injury control methods. He is one of 64 new members elected to the IOM in 2005 and the only one from Washington state.\n\nIn 2006, Dr. Maxine Hayes, a former medical director of the Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic and current Children's medical staff member, is elected to the IOM for her work on health issues affecting the community.\n\nThe IOM recognizes those who have made major contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, health care and public health.\n\nTiny Hearts, Giant Strides\n\nIn 2005, Children’s becomes the first medical center west of the Mississippi to perform a heart transplantation in which the recipient’s blood type is different from the donor’s. The procedure dramatically decreases wait times for donor hearts and saves the lives of many children who might otherwise die waiting for an organ of their same blood type.\n\nKnown as ABO-mismatched heart transplants, Drs. Gordon Cohen and Lester Permut perform these surgeries on infants whose immune systems have not yet developed the antibodies needed to attack foreign tissue.\n\nAlso in 2005, Cohen and Permut make history when they perform a successful heart transplant on the youngest (12 days) and smallest (7.4 pounds) patient in the Pacific Northwest. The boy is the first infant to be bridged from a heart–lung bypass machine to transplant.\n\nThe Campaign for Children’s concludes, raising $352 million – $52 million more than expected. It is the largest capital campaign in our organization’s history. The campaign supported facilities to continue fostering healing, hope and cures; uncompensated care to ensure no child is turned away because of lack of resources; and research to unlock the doors to better treatments and cures.\n\nWe change our name from Children’s Hospital and Regional Medical Center to Seattle Children’s. With new additions this year we reach nearly 60 subspecialty areas – from adolescent medicine to virology – at hospital and clinic locations across the region, including Seattle, Bellevue, Everett, Federal Way, Olympia and the Tri-Cities. Ground and air transport networks help bring critically ill patients to Seattle Children’s from community hospitals throughout the region.\n\nSeattle Children’s is the primary pediatric training site for the University of Washington School of Medicine. More than 680 residents and fellows provide care and conduct over 150 active research projects at the hospital. These projects are supported by nearly $20 million in National Institutes of Health grants. Seattle Children’s continues to grow, and in 2008 we have more than 4,000 active employees throughout the hospital, research institute and foundation.\n\nTwo neurosurgeons and a neonatologist from Seattle Children’s volunteer their time and partner with Woodland Park Zoo’s Animal Health staff to remove a cyst growing near the spine of a 9-pound, 2½-month-old female western lowland gorilla. “This gorilla operation was an amazing Star Trek–type of experience for the team from Seattle Children’s and the University of Washington,” says Dr. Richard Ellenbogen, a neurosurgeon at Seattle Children’s. “Drs. Craig Jackson, Sam Browd and I were proud to help with an endangered species such as the baby gorilla suffering from a congenital spinal abnormality. The operation was a great success from our perspective, and we are hoping for a full recovery.”\n\nBuilding Hope – officially “Forest A” – opens, adding 330,000 square feet of new space to the hospital campus, including an all-new, much larger emergency department with a revamped model of care that allows patients to be seen by a triage nurse right away. Building Hope also adds 80 new cancer and critical care beds, including the Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Unit, one of the first such units in the country. Research shows that adolescents and young adults with cancer have better outcomes when treated with pediatric protocols, but often feel uncomfortable in child-oriented children’s hospitals. Our 16-bed AYA unit includes amenities geared toward teens and young adults, like a therapy gym, lounge and rooftop terrace. The new facility receives LEED Gold certification, thanks to its environmentally-conscious building design that uses 47% less energy and 30% less water than similarly sized hospitals in the region.\n\nThe research institute becomes one of the nation’s top five pediatric research centers for National Institutes of Health funding with more than $76 million total research funding, including nearly $52 million in federal research funding. Among the fastest-growing pediatric research organizations in the United States, the institute now features 330,000 square feet of lab, clinical research and office space, and a workforce of nearly 1,200 people.\n\nSeattle Children’s Research Institute’s cell production facility begins turning laboratory discoveries into therapies for clinical studies in people. Seattle Children’s boasts one of just a few pediatric facilities that meet strict FDA requirements for manufacturing cellular therapies to treat childhood diseases like cancer. The facility manufactures the immunotherapies for the trials that are giving new hope to patients with leukemia and other cancers. It will ultimately b"
