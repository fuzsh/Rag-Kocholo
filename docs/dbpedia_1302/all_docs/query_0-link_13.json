        "text": "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.\n\nBy CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\n\nBritish actor Tom Wilkinson (February 5, 1948-December 30, 2023) was a scene-stealer of the highest order. Rarely playing a lead role, his characters infused the films he was in with gravity, tragedy and sardonic humor. He won an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his performance as Benjamin Franklin in the HBO series \"John Adams.\"\n\nWilkinson earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his performance in \"Michael Clayton\" (2007), as an attorney who appears to fall apart owing to his experience litigating a multi-billion-dollar class action lawsuit over a carcinogenic weed killer. His come-to-Jesus moment of clarity about his complicity sets off a chain reaction that threatens the high-priced law firm hired to clean up the chemical company's mess.\n\nEdens (Tom Wilkinson): \"I have blood on my hands.\"\n\nClayton (George Clooney): \"You are the senior litigating partner of one of the largest, most respected law firms in the world. You are a legend.\"\n\nEdens: \"I'm an accomplice!\"\n\nClayton: \"You're a manic-depressive!\"\n\nEdens: \"I am Shiva, the god of death.\"\n\nHe also earned a best actor Academy Award nomination for Todd Field's 2001 drama \"In the Bedroom,\" playing a father grieving over the murder of his son.\n\nA Yorkshire native born into a farming family, Wilkinson attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and appeared on stage and in such films and TV programs as \"Sylvia,\" \"Prime Suspect,\" \"In the Name of the Father,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" \"The Ghost and the Darkness,\" \"Oscar and Lucinda,\" \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" and \"Rush Hour,\"\n\nThen came his breakout role, in the 1997 comedy \"The Full Monty,\" as an unemployed steel mill foreman who seeks a new career as a male stripper. It was followed by \"Shakespeare in Love,\" \"The Patriot,\" \"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\" \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" \"Batman Begins,\" \"The Exorcism of Emily Rose,\" \"Valkyrie,\" \"The Debt,\" \"The Kennedys,\" \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,\" \"Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol,\" \"Belle,\" \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" and \"Selma.\"\n\nHe recently reunited with \"Full Monty\" co-stars Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy in a Disney+ series of the same name.\n\nTom Smothers\n\nTom Smothers (February 2, 1937-December 26, 2023), one-half of the duo The Smothers Brothers, said they didn't think of themselves as comedians. \"No, we thought of ourselves as folk singers,\" Tom told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022.\n\nBut the pair – Dick playing bass and straight man, Tom (two years older) on guitar and cracking wise – were a hit with their late '60s variety show, \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\" With guest stars like comedian George Carlin and anti-war activist Pete Seeger, and a writing staff that included Steve Martin and Rob Reiner, the show was a counterculture hit that tweaked the powers-that-be, whether in the White House or at CBS' headquarters at Black Rock. With their charm and light banter of sibling rivalry (\"Mom liked you best!\"), they lampooned politicians, decried the war in Vietnam, and made fun of network censors. They were a hit almost instantly; within two weeks, they were beating the venerable \"Bonanza\" in the ratings.\n\nAs their humor got sharper, censors sharpened their scissors, cutting out controversial content, sometimes entire skits, which put Tom on the defensive, willing to continue poking the bear: \"I was offended; 'What do you mean I can't say that?'\" he said. CBS finally cancelled the show after 72 episodes. The brothers sued the network for breach of contract and won, but the show was over.\n\nTom recognized that, by the end of their run, anger was getting in the way of humor: \"I was doing material, it was kind of mean comedy,\" he said. \"I needed to be fired. If we would have gotten another year, it'd have been strident!\"\n\nThey didn't give up performing, though; they did a few more TV and stage shows, including a '90s reboot of their \"Comedy Hour\" (on CBS, no less), and starred on Broadway.\n\nThe two had started while Tom was a student at San Jose State College, part of a music group, The Casual Quintet. Tom encouraged Dick to join, and the two continued as a duo after other players dropped out. Mixing comedy with folk music, The Smothers Brothers made numerous appearances on TV variety shows, records, and college venues. They played brothers – one a fledgling guardian angel – in a 1965 sitcom, \"The Smothers Brothers Show,\" which failed to showcase their musical talents. The year after that ended, their \"Comedy Hour\" took off.\n\nIn 2008, as he received a lifetime Emmy Award, Tom said, \"It's hard for me to stay silent when I keep hearing that peace is only attainable through war.\" He dedicated his award to those \"who feel compelled to speak out and are not afraid to speak to power and won't shut up.\"\n\nThey retired in 2010, but returned in 2021 with a series of stage shows.\n\n\"People laughing is holy,\" Tom told \"Sunday Morning,\" as they prepared for another tour. \"And if you can be part of that, and control it, and create it, it's the best thing ever.\"\n\nRyan O'Neal\n\nRyan O'Neal (April 20, 1941-December 8, 2023) transitioned from an actor on TV's \"Peyton Place\" to an Oscar-nominated role in \"Love Story,\" the blockbuster tear-jerker that catapulted him into the front ranks of Hollywood stars in the 1970s. O'Neal and Ali MacGraw starred as college students from disparate backgrounds who fall in love, marry, and then discover she is dying of cancer. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\nAppearing in a wide range of comedies and dramas, O'Neal cleverly used his boyish good looks to play men who hid sinister backgrounds behind clean-cut images. He starred in Stanley Kubrick's historical epic \"Barry Lyndon,\" playing a roguish opportunist whose life cascades between poverty and wealth, from the battlefields of Europe to an aristocratic estate.\n\nO'Neal's gift for comedy shone opposite Barbra Streisand in Peter Bogdanovich's \"What's Up, Doc?\"; and he shared the screen with his daughter, Tatum, as a pair of confidence tricksters in \"Paper Moon,\" for which the 10-year-old won an Oscar for best supporting actress.\n\nHis other film credits included \"The Big Bounce\" (in which he appeared with his second wife, Leigh Taylor-Young), \"Wild Rovers,\" \"Nickelodeon,\" \"A Bridge Too Far,\" \"The Driver,\" \"Oliver's Story\" (a poorly-received sequel to \"Love Story\"), \"The Main Event,\" \"Irreconcilable Differences,\" \"Tough Guys Don't Dance,\" and \"Knight of Cups.\"\n\nO'Neal continued acting into his 70s, appearing on TV's \"90210,\" \"Bull,\" \"Bones,\" \"Malibu's Most Wanted,\" and \"Desperate Housewives.\"\n\nTalented but troubled, O'Neal's boy-next-door image was sometimes at odds with his personal life, marked by a hot temper, drugs and alcohol. Twice divorced, he had strained relationships with three of his four children. In her autobiography Tatum O'Neal wrote of suffering physical and emotional abuse from her dad. They tried to patch things up by participating in a reality TV series, \"Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals.\"\n\nIn 2007 Ryan was arrested for firing a gun at his son Griffin, but charges were dropped. The following year, he was arrested along with his son Redmond on drug charges. In 2009 he told Vanity Fair magazine, \"I'm a hopeless father. I don't know why. I don't think I was supposed to be a father.\"\n\nThe one constant in his life was Farrah Fawcett. Their relationship was an on-again/off-again affair, which was rekindled in 2001, when O'Neal was diagnosed with leukemia; Fawcett was at his side. Five years later, when Fawcett was diagnosed with cancer, he was there for her until the end, when she died in 2009. He even suggested that the hospital chaplain marry the two. \"She said, 'Okay, let's get married,'\" O'Neal told \"CBS This Morning\" in 2012. \"But by then, she was so weak that he was only able to give her the last rites.\"\n\nIn 2021, O'Neal and MacGraw spoke with \"Sunday Morning\" about the making of \"Love Story,\" and noted that over the years they'd been asked frequently to explain the movie's most famous quote: \"Love means never having to say you're sorry.\" \"Neither of us knew at the time,\" said O'Neal. \"But over the years, we have come up with answers that … I don't know. I had to say 'I'm sorry' a lot in my life, that's all I know!\"\n\nNorman Lear\n\nLegendary TV producer Norman Lear (July 27, 1922-December 5, 2023) was responsible for such groundbreaking situation comedies as \"All in the Family,\" \"Maude,\" \"The Jeffersons,\" \"Sanford & Son,\" and \"One Day at a Time\" – shows that broke taboos on broadcast entertainment and helped define a generation. His comedies routinely tackled serious social issues, some rarely seen on TV before, from racism, rape and abortion to menopause, homosexuality and religion, all viewed through the prism of laughter.\n\nNowhere was this more effective than in the debates pitting arch conservative Archie Bunker (played by Carroll O'Connor) and his liberal son-in-law Mike (Rob Reiner) in \"All in the Family.\" In a 2021 interview on \"Sunday Morning,\" Lear said people on both ends of the political spectrum found something to connect with in the show. \"I like to think what they saw was the foolishness of the human condition,\" he said.\n\n\"The intention was to show there's humor in everything,\" he told \"CBS This Morning\" in 2017. \"And I never thought of [Archie] as a hater so much as a man fearful of progress.\"\n\nLear, a World War II veteran, got his start as a writer for radio and TV in the post-war years. It was \"All in the Family,\" which premiered on CBS in 1971, that put him on the map. The show ran for nine seasons, won 22 Emmy Awards, and was No. 1 in the ratings for five consecutive years.\n\nEven when the subject matter was divisive, the audience would be bonded by humor. \"To be able to laugh in a rehearsal at something you hadn't expected, and then to stand to the side or behind an audience laughing, and watch them, their bodies – a couple of hundred people as one – when something makes them laugh, I don't think I've ever seen a more spiritual moment than an audience in a belly laugh!\" Lear said. \"The soundtrack of my life has been laughter.\"\n\n\"All in the Family\" was followed by the popular and provocative spin-offs \"Maude\" (starring Bea Arthur), and \"The Jeffersons\" (starring Isabel Sanford and Sherman Hemsley), which brought storylines about women's liberation and race into millions of living rooms across the country.\n\n\"Sanford and Son\" (starring comedian Redd Foxx) and \"Good Times\" broke ground with mostly Black casts. In \"One Day at a Time,\" Bonnie Franklin starred as a divorcee struggling against sexism, chauvinistic bosses and cheating boyfriends, while raising two teenage daughters.\n\nLear also created the syndicated \"Mary Hartman, Marty Hartman,\" a parody of soap operas, and was executive producer of \"Hot l Baltimore\" (based on the Lanford Wilson stage comedy), set in a run-down hotel populated by prostitutes, undocumented immigrants, and a gay couple.\n\nThe political and social issues he explored on screen also inspired his own activism. In 1981, he co-founded the nonprofit group People For the American Way to advocate for progressive causes and counter anti-democratic or divisive politics.\n\nIn a 2022 conversation with Ted Koppel for \"Sunday Morning,\" Lear discussed the state of a world that closely monitors discrimination towards minorities, women, gays or other groups. Koppel said, \"Every office now has a department of someone who is there to make sure that others in the department don't go around offending one another. We didn't have that 50 years ago. Is that a good thing?\"\n\n\"Oh my God, my sense is there's something wrong, that we're living in a culture where that has to exist,\" said Lear, \"that there is a role for a person to make sure that other people are being decent humans. It says something about the culture we live in.\"\n\n\"I'm getting the impression that what you're saying is we shouldn't need a department to make us be nice to one another?\" Koppel asked.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, yes, yes,\" Lear replied. And the key to achieving that, he said, was to be able to laugh at ourselves.\n\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor\n\nIn 1981, Sandra Day O'Connor (March 26, 1930-December 1, 2023), a conservative judge and elected official from Arizona, was named by President Ronald Reagan to the U.S. Supreme Court, becoming the first female justice in the high court's 191-year history. A moderate conservative, O'Connor wasted little time building a reputation as a hard worker who wielded considerable political clout on the nine-member court.\n\nO'Connor had a tenacious, independent spirit that came naturally. As a child growing up in the Arizona outback, on a ranch founded by her pioneer grandfather, she learned early to ride horses, round up cattle and drive trucks and tractors. \"I didn't do all the things the boys did,\" she said in a 1981 Time magazine interview, \"but I fixed windmills and repaired fences.\"\n\nHer most influential votes came in 1989, when she refused to join four other justices ready to reverse the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that said women have a constitutional right to abortion; and in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, when she led a five-justice majority that reaffirmed the core holding of Roe. Reading a summary of her decision in court, O'Connor said, \"Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that can't control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.\" [Thirty years later, the justice who replaced O'Connor upon her retirement, Samuel Alito, wrote the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe, allowing states to ban abortions with few or no exemptions.]\n\nIn 2000, O'Connor was part of the 5-4 majority that effectively halted the counting of ballots in Florida, thus deciding the disputed presidential election in favor of Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore.\n\nO'Connor was regarded with great fondness by many of her colleagues. When she retired in 2006, Justice Clarence Thomas, a consistent conservative, called her \"an outstanding colleague, civil in dissent and gracious when in the majority.\"\n\nShe could, nonetheless, express her views tartly. In one of her final actions as a justice, a dissent to a 5-4 ruling to allow local governments to condemn and seize personal property to allow private developers to build shopping plazas, office buildings and other facilities, she warned the majority had unwisely ceded yet more power to the powerful. \"The specter of condemnation hangs over all property,\" O'Connor wrote. \"Nothing is to prevent the state from replacing ... any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory.\"\n\nOnce called the nation's most powerful woman, O'Connor remained the court's only woman until 1993, when President Bill Clinton nominated Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. [The current court includes four women.]\n\nIn a 2006 interview with CBS News, in which she was described as \"charmingly feisty,\" O'Connor said she was not comfortable with some of the labels used about her during her tenure, such as \"swing vote.\" \"I'm not OK with that,\" she said. \"I think that's a term the press developed, and it has no appeal for me.\"\n\nWhen asked how reporters could do a better job covering the judicial branch, O'Connor replied: \"Oh, give the Court credit for not making political decisions. Give them credit for trying to resolve the issues fairly sometimes.\"\n\nRosalynn Carter\n\nFormer first lady Rosalynn Carter (August 18, 1927-November 19, 2023) was the closest adviser to Jimmy Carter during his presidency. Both said she was the more political of the pair. Unlike many previous first ladies, Rosalynn sat in on Cabinet meetings and spoke out on controversial issues. The president even sent her on a trip to Latin America to tell dictators he meant what he said about denying military aid and other support to violators of human rights.\n\nFiercely loyal and politically astute, Rosalynn prided herself on being an activist first lady, whose support for projects was often enlisted by White House aides before they discussed it with the president. She acted to address mental health and problems of the elderly as her signature policy emphasis, and criticized reporters who neglected to cover those issues. She became the first first lady since Eleanor Roosevelt to address a congressional panel when, as honorary chairwoman of the President's Commission on Mental Health, she testified before a Senate subcommittee.\n\nAfter losing reelection in 1980 and leaving Washington, Jimmy and Rosalynn co-founded The Carter Center in Atlanta to continue their humanitarian work. They built homes with Habitat for Humanity, promoted public health initiatives (such as eradicating Guinea worm) in the developing world, and monitored elections across the globe.\n\nShe also wrote several books, including an autobiography, \"First Lady From Plains,\" and (with Susan K. Golant) \"Helping Someone with Mental Illness: A Compassionate Guide for Family, Friends, and Caregivers.\" She co-authored a book with her husband \"Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life,\" a collaboration they both agreed had tested their marriage like no White House crisis ever did.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with C-Span, Rosalynn Carter said, \"I hope my legacy continues more than just first lady. The Carter Center has been an integral part of our lives and our motto is 'Waging peace, fighting disease and building hope.'\"\n\n\"I get tired,\" she once said of her travels. \"But something so wonderful always happens. To go to a village where they have Guinea worm and go back a year or two later and there's no Guinea worm, I mean the people dance and sing - it's so wonderful.\"\n\nDavid Del Tredici\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici (March 16, 1937-November 18, 2023) was a proponent of a concert hall movement dubbed Neo-Romanticism – lushly detailed orchestral and vocal works, which in the case of Del Tredici served as melodic interpretations of the writings of Lewis Carroll, specifically his \"Alice\" books.\n\nTrained as a pianist, Del Tredici shifted to writing music after experiencing the withering criticism of an instructor, followed by composition studies at Berkeley and Princeton. He set the words of James Joyce to music (\"Sysygy\"), and then found inspiration in Carroll's books (and in the English writer's infatuation with young Alice Liddell).\n\nIn a 2012 interview by his publisher, Boosey & Hawkes, Del Tredici recalled his earlier dissonant pieces: \"In those days it was so exciting to be atonal because it was so new. We were happy with our kind of wholesome, heartfelt, woodland music which in a way was what my generation had been fed on, but to have this totally horrifying aesthetic, which was atonal, was thrilling. When you're a composer, you want to be different, you want to have something special to say, you want to be shocking, you want to get attention. And this filled the bill.\"\n\nBut for Carroll, and the theme of suppressed love, he said, \"I needed another language. Somehow atonality didn't do it.\"\n\nHis earlier experimental and minimalist music would become overshadowed by such pieces as \"Final Alice,\" a brash and melodic 1975 work for soprano and orchestra.\n\nSimilarly, \"In Memory of a Summer Day\" – a meditation on love and death for soprano and orchestra – takes the title from Carroll's dedication in his original manuscript. In the composer's notes he wrote: \"Like many of my pieces, this movement began chastely, but grew (Wonderland-style) to alarming proportions.\" It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1980, and became the basis of a dance work by the National Ballet of Canada.\n\nRoger Kastel\n\nArtist Roger Kastel (June 11,1931-November 8, 2023) created more than 1,000 illustrations used in magazines, comics, book covers and movie posters, none more recognizable than his artwork for Peter Benchley's bestseller \"Jaws.\"\n\nThe image of a great white shark rising up towards a naked female swimmer was created for the paperback edition, for which Kastel went to the American Museum of Natural History to photograph closeup views of a shark's teeth. He also had a model pretend to swim while stretched out on a stool.\n\nSo striking was Kastel's illustration (and successful – the Bantam Books paperback edition initially sold three million copies) that Universal Pictures used it to market Steven Spielberg's 1975 movie version. It became one of the most iconic movie posters of all time, and was featured in the anthologies \"200 Years of American Illustration\" and \"The Illustrator in America.\"\n\nThe whereabouts of Kastel's original artwork – oil on masonite – became a mystery. Kastel last saw it at a museum exhibition in the '70s, after which it allegedly was shipped to Hollywood. (In 1993 it was spotted by this writer hanging on a wall at Bantam Books in New York City, prior to the publisher moving its offices to Times Square.) To date efforts to locate it have failed.\n\nOther movie posters featuring Kastel's work include \"The Great Train Robbery\" and the \"Star Wars\" sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"\n\nIn the 2012 documentary \"The Shark Is Still Working,\" Kastel recalled his seven-year-old grandson asking him, \"'Did you ever do a Mona Lisa?' That really threw me. I said, 'I don't think I've done the Mona Lisa.' And he said, 'Well, the shark will just have to be your Mona Lisa.'\"\n\nFrank Borman\n\nA U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and instructor at West Point, astronaut Frank Borman (March 14, 1928-November 7, 2023) commanded Apollo 8's historic 1968 flight – the first manned mission to the moon. Borman, James Lovell and William Anders circled the moon 10 times beginning on December 24, paving the way for Apollo 11's lunar landing the following year.\n\nIn 2018 Borman told \"Sunday Morning\" that his goal was to \"go to the moon and come back alive, because I knew that would beat the Russians.\"\n\nLeaving low-Earth orbit, the crew of Apollo 8 traveled further than any humans ever had. In his 1988 book, \"Countdown: An Autobiography,\" Borman wrote of the \"intensely emotional\" experience of being among the first to see Earth from the depths of space. \"We said nothing to each other, but I was sure our thoughts were identical - of our families on that spinning globe. And maybe we shared another thought I had, This must be what God sees.\"\n\nOn Christmas Eve, in a live broadcast from lunar orbit, the astronauts read from the Book of Genesis. \"We were told that we would have the largest audience that ever listened to a human voice before,\" said Borman.\n\nWhen asked if he knew at the time what kind of impact their Bible reading would have, Borman replied, \"No, but as we flew and as we contemplated it afterwards, we all agreed that we couldn't have done anything more appropriate.\"\n\nBorman ended the broadcast with, \"And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you - all of you on the good Earth.\"\n\nAt the end of one of America's most turbulent years – rocked by war, riots, political assassinations and generational clashes – Borman said, \"We got thousands of telegrams after the flight, but the one that struck me the most said, 'Thank you Apollo 8. You saved 1968.' And I think in a way we helped to heal it.\"\n\nAfter leaving NASA, Borman joined Eastern Airlines (then the fourth-largest airline in the U.S.) as a special adviser, eventually becoming its president, CEO and, in 1976, chairman of the board. He retired in 1986.\n\nHaving begun flying at age 15 with flight lessons paid for by money he earned pumping gas, Borman continued flying into his 90s.\n\nBob Knight\n\nCollege basketball coach Bob Knight (October 25, 1940-November 1, 2023) became famous as much for his legendary temper as for his success on the court. He played on a national championship team at Ohio State, and as a coach won three NCAA titles at Indiana. He also coached the U.S. Olympic team to a medal in 1984 – the last amateur American team to win gold in men's basketball.\n\nNicknamed \"The General,\" and at 6'5\" an intimidating presence, Knight was among the winningest and most controversial coaches in the sport, finishing his career with 902 victories in 42 seasons at Army, Indiana and Texas Tech, while also mentoring some of America's best coaches.\n\nHis trademark temper cost him his job at Indiana in 2000. His behavior included throwing a chair across the court, hitting a police officer in Puerto Rico during the 1979 Pan American Games, and firing a blank from a starter's pistol at a reporter during a 1980 news conference. He was also accused of wrapping his hands around a player's neck.\n\nHired by Texas Tech (its president described the decision as a \"no-brainer\"), Knight turned the Red Raisers' fortunes around.\n\nHe told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2002 that the words of his mother, an elementary school teacher, continued to ring in his ears: \"I can close my eyes and see my mom saying it as I left the house. It didn't make any difference what I was going to do, whether it was football or basketball or baseball that I was going to play: 'But now just remember, somebody has to lose.' And I didn't want it to be me, no.\" So, Bob Knight pretty much won.\n\nHe also wrote a book, \"Knight: My Story,\" in order to counter the press' fascination with Knight's uncourtly behavior on court. \"Everybody has tried to tell my story over the years,\" he said. \"And the only guy that knows – it's like bullfight critics, row on row, crowd the enormous plaza full, and there's only one man there who knows, and he's the one who fights the bull. So, this is a bullfighter's story right here.\"\n\nMatthew Perry\n\nAs Chandler Bing, a quick-witted, sarcastic member of the coterie of \"Friends,\" Matthew Perry (August 19, 1969-October 28, 2023) was one of TV's most beloved actors, with success that stretched from the 10 seasons that the show was on the air (from 1994 to 2004), to the following it gained among a younger generation as a streaming staple on Netflix. In 2015 he told \"CBS This Morning,\" \"People come up to me that I know were not born while we shot the show for sure, and they're just surprised at how elderly I look.\"\n\nStarring alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and David Schwimmer, Perry earned an Emmy nomination as Bing, a man with commitment issues, but who winds up marrying Cox's character.\n\nIn his 2022 memoir, \"Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing\" (which became a #1 New York Times bestseller), Perry described reading the \"Friends\" script for the first time: \"It was as if someone had followed me around for a year, stealing my jokes, copying my mannerisms, photocopying my world-weary yet witty view of life. … it wasn't that I thought I could 'play' Chandler. I 'was' Chandler.\"\n\nUnknown at the time that \"Friends\" was one of TV's biggest hits was the struggle Perry had with addiction: \"'Friends' was huge. I couldn't jeopardize that,\" he wrote. \"I loved my co-actors. I loved the scripts. I loved everything about the show but I was struggling with my addictions which only added to my sense of shame. … I had a secret and no one could know.\"\n\nHe recalled in his memoir that Aniston confronted him about being inebriated while filming. \"I know you're drinking,\" he remembered her telling him once. \"We can smell it,\" she said, in what Perry called a \"kind of weird but loving way, and the plural 'we' hit me like a sledgehammer.\"\n\nHe made repeated trips to rehab, for prescription pill addiction, and in 2011 checked in for what (he said in a statement to TMZ) was preventive reasons: \"Please enjoy making fun of me on the world wide web,\" he noted.\n\nPerry was very open about his recovery from alcohol and drug addiction, and in 2015, Perry told CBS he was supportive of other recovering addicts. He also operated a sober living facility out of his former home in Malibu, called the Perry House.\n\n\"I think people don't understand it's a disease,\" Perry said. \"It was declared a disease in 1955 by the American Medical Association and even people in trouble with this thing don't kind of realize that they're suffering with a disease, so they blame themselves. It's important to get it out there and not have it be a secret, so you can get the help you need.\"\n\nPrior to \"Friends,\" Perry appeared on shows such as \"Charles in Charles,\" \"Silver Spoons,\" \"The Tracey Ullman Show,\" \"Highway to Heaven,\" \"Empty Nest,\" \"Growing Pains,\" \"Who's the Boss,\" \"Dream On,\" \"Sydney,\" and \"Boys Will Be Boys.\" His films roles included \"A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon\" with River Phoenix.\n\nAfter \"Friends,\" Perry received two more Emmy nominations as White House counsel Joe Quincy on \"The West Wing.\" He starred in the rom-com \"Fools Rush In\" opposite Salma Hayek, and the Bruce Willis crime comedy \"The Whole Nine Yards.\" He also starred in the short-lived series \"Go On,\" as one member of a support group.\n\nIn 2015, he played Oscar Madison in a CBS reboot of Neil Simon's \"The Odd Couple.\" He told \"CBS This Morning\" that he is better in front of an audience: \"I like hamming it up in front of an audience, and you get an instant reaction. You get to find out right away if a joke works or if a joke doesn't work, and if a joke doesn't work, they all fix it.\"\n\nHe also earned Emmy nominations for the TV movie \"The Ron Clark Story,\" and for the 2021 \"Friends\" reunion special for HBO Max.\n\nBut it wasn't acting that was most gratifying to him. In 2015 he told the Hollywood Reporter, \"I've had a lot of ups and downs in my life and a lot of wonderful accolades, but the best thing about me is that if an alcoholic comes up to me and says, 'Will you help me stop drinking?' I will say, 'Yes. I know how to do that.'\"\n\nRichard Roundtree\n\nAs the star of the trailblazing 1971 action movie \"Shaft,\" Richard Roundtree (July 9, 1942-October 24, 2023) transitioned, at age 28, from a model to the first Black action hero. He tore up the screen as the street smart, ultra-smooth New York City detective John Shaft, a nemesis to drug pushers in Harlem and a magnet for women. \"What we were doing was a good old, Saturday afternoon shoot 'em up,\" Roundtree said in a 2000 Associated Press interview.\n\nDirected by Gordon Parks, \"Shaft\" was part of a wave of blaxploitation films marketed primarily to Black audiences, but its success helped Roundtree break through, and he became the shoulders on which other Black actors rose. He returned to the character in the sequels \"Shaft's Big Score\" and \"Shaft in Africa,\" as well as a short-lived CBS TV series. Proving you couldn't keep a good detective down, he also played \"Uncle John Shaft\" in a 2000 reboot starring Samuel L. Jackson, and \"John Shaft Sr.\" in a 2019 film with Jessie T. Usher.\n\nRoundtree's other film and TV credits included \"Earthquake,\" \"Man Friday,\" \"Roots,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"Magnum, P.I.,\" \"A.D.,\" \"Generations,\" \"Maniac Cop,\" \"L.A. Law,\" \"Se7en,\" \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\" \"George of the Jungle,\" \"Rescue 77,\" \"Alias,\" \"Desperate Housewives,\" \"Speed Racer,\" \"Diary of a Single Mom,\" \"Chicago Fire,\" \"What Men Want,\" \"Haunting of the Marie Celeste,\" and \"Family Reunion.\"\n\nPiper Laurie\n\nActress Piper Laurie (January 22, 1932-October 14, 2023) earned three Academy Award nominations, for the 1961 poolroom drama \"The Hustler\"; the 1976 film version of Stephen King's horror classic \"Carrie\" (as the hellfire-breathing mother of Sissy Spacek); and the 1986 drama \"Children of a Lesser God.\" Those roles came after she had given up on Hollywood, more than once.\n\nRosetta Jacobs arrived in Los Angeles in 1949 and quickly signed a contract with Universal-International, acquiring a new name (which she hated), and a string of roles opposite such stars as Ronald Reagan, Rock Hudson, Tony Curtis, and Francis the Talking Mule. Frustrated with the quality of scripts, in 1955 she walked out on her contract, vowing not to work in Hollywood until she was offered a decent part.\n\nIn her 2011 memoir \"Learning to Live Out Loud,\" she wrote about a script being offered for what she dismissed as a \"C\" western: \"The woman's part was a prop and just barely that, possibly the worst part they had ever handed me. I suddenly felt so deeply insulted, so unappreciated, so mortally wounded. This time they had gone too far. I calmly got up, walked over to the fireplace, and dropped their script into the flames. With it went a little of the humiliation I had endured in the last five years. Something was coming alive in me.\"\n\nMoving to New York, she found work in theater and live television. Emmy nominations for \"The Deaf Heart\" and \"Days of Wine and Roses\" led to her starring opposite Paul Newman in \"The Hustler.\"\n\nShe earned her first Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for that movie, but didn't appear in another film for 15 years. Apart from a spate of '60s TV roles, she turned her back on acting. She married, had a daughter, and moved to a farmhouse in Woodstock, New York. Her baking recipes appeared in The New York Times. \"I was disenchanted and looking for an existence more meaningful for me,\" she recalled.\n\nShe was coaxed back for Brian DePalma's film version of \"Carrie,\" to play Sissy Spacek's mother, whose religious fervor leads to tragedy. (Both she and Spacek were nominated for Oscars.) The burst of film and TV roles that followed included David Lynch's \"Twin Peaks\" (as the duplicitous Catherine Martell), and playing George Clooney's mother on \"ER.\"\n\nSuzanne Somers\n\nActress Suzanne Somers (October 16, 1946-October 15, 2023) was best known for playing Chrissy Snow on the 1970s sitcom \"Three's Company.\" A ditzy blonde, Chrissy was one of two young women who shared an apartment with a man (played by John Ritter) on condition that he pretend to be gay, in order to assuage their nosy landlord.\n\n\"Creating her was actually intellectual,\" she told CBS Station KCAL in 2020. \"How do I make her likable and loveable ... dumb blondes are annoying. I gave her a moral code. I imagined it was the childhood I would've liked to have had.\"\n\nBorn in San Bruno, California, to a gardener father and a medical secretary mother, Her father was an alcoholic and abusive. She married young, at 19, to Bruce Somers, after becoming pregnant with her son, Bruce. The couple divorced three years later, and she began working as a model to support herself in the 1960s and early '70s.\n\nHer breakout part was a wordless cameo as a stunning blonde in a Thunderbird, in George Lucas' \"American Graffiti.\" Her small but striking role earned her a guest spot on \"The Tonight Show,\" which led to her being signed up by the producers of \"Three's Company,\" who were recasting for their third attempt at a pilot episode.\n\nThe show was a major hit for ABC, but after four seasons Somers asked for a raise from $30,000 an episode to $150,000, so that she'd earn as much as her male costar. The producers fired her, replacing her character with two different roommates for the remaining years that the show aired. The pay fight led to a rift with her co-stars that lasted for years. Somers would later reconcile with Ritter before his death, and then with Joyce DeWitt.\n\nBut Somers took the break from \"Three's Company\" as an opportunity to pursue new avenues, including a Las Vegas act, hosting talk shows (online and on the Lifetime channel), and becoming an entrepreneur. In the 1990s, she became the spokesperson for the ThighMaster. She promoted health and beauty products, and wrote nearly two dozen books, including several New York Times bestsellers, on such topics as aging, menopause, beauty, wellness, sex and cancer.\n\nHer tumultuous early years were dramatized in a 1991 TV movie, \"Keeping Secrets,\" in which Somers played herself.\n\nCancer colored much of her life. First diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000, she had previously battled malignant melanoma, and also suffered severe hyperplasia in her uterus. In 2008 she was even misdiagnosed with \"full-body cancer.\" She wrote about alternative treatments, and received backlash from doctors for arguing against the use of chemotherapy.\n\nIn 2020 she told CBS, \"I thought that when I turned 73 that I would be old, chronologically old. But I'm not old, and I believe it's because of the way I've been taking care of myself. I've really thought of [my body] as a Maserati, and I feed it right and put the highest octane fuel I can put in there and it pays off.\"\n\nRudolph Isley\n\nSinger-songwriter Rudolph Isley (April 1, 1939-October 11, 2023) was a founding member of the R&B group The Isley Brothers, who recorded such hits as \"Shout,\" \"Twist & Shout,\" \"That Lady\" and \"It's Your Thing.\"\n\nRaised in Cincinnati, Rudolph began singing in church with brothers Ronald and O'Kelly, and was still in his teens when they broke through in the late 1950s with \"Shout\" (a secularized gospel rave later immortalized in the film \"Animal House\"). The Isleys scored again in the early 1960s with \"Twist & Shout,\" which the Beatles covered on their debut album.\n\nOther Isley hits included \"This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You),\" and the Grammy-winning \"It's Your Thing.\"\n\nIn the 1970s, after younger brothers Ernest and Marvin Isley and brother-in-law Chris Jasper joined the group, they had even greater success with \"That Lady\" and \"Fight the Power (Part 1),\" and such million-selling albums as \"The Heat Is On\" and \"Go for Your Guns.\"\n\nIn 1989, three years after the sudden death of O'Kelly Isley, Rudolph left the group to become a Christian minister. He was among the Isleys inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nPhyllis Coates\n\nActress Phyllis Coates (January 15, 1927-October 11, 2023) played opposite George Reeves in the 1951 film \"Superman and the Mole Men,\" and continued as the first Lois Lane in the 1950s TV series, \"Adventures of Superman.\" (Noel Neill took over the role in the second season.)\n\nA native of Wichita Falls, Texas, Coates was a dancer performing in burlesque shows before being featured in a series of B movies, such as the westerns \"Outlaws of Texas\" and \"Nevada Badmen.\" She had scores of appearances on television, including \"The Cisco Kid,\" \"The Adventures of Kit Carson,\" \"The Millionaire,\" \"Lassie,\" \"The Lone Ranger,\" \"Death Valley Days,\" \"Perry Mason,\" \"Rawhide,\" \"The Untouchables\" \"Death Valley Days\" and \"Gunsmoke.\" She continued acting into the 1990s when she appeared in \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.\"\n\nOne of her last roles was as Lois Lane's mother, Ellen Lane, in \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\"\n\nBurt Young\n\nCharacter actor Burt Young (April 30, 1940-October 8, 2023) was best known as Paulie Pennino, best friend of Sylvester Stallone's Rocky Balboa, and brother of Rocky's girlfriend/wife, Adrian. Young earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for the 1976 film, and reprised his role in five \"Rocky\" sequels.\n\n\"I'm not Paulie,\" Young told New York Newsday in 2007, \"but there's a part of Paulie in all of us ... cowardice, bravado, false bravado. And I knew how to beat the drum to make the guy interesting and ugly and pathetic.\"\n\nA veteran of more than 160 film and TV roles, Young was born Richard Morea and raised in Queens, New York. He served in the Marine Corps, was a professional boxer, and worked laying carpets before he took up acting. He studied with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Small roles in films like \"The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight\" and \"Across 110th Street\" led to \"Chinatown\" (as a fisherman who throws a fit when Jack Nicholson's private detective shows him pictures proving his wife's infidelity), \"The Gambler,\" \"Serpico,\" and then \"Rocky.\"\n\nOther films included \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" \"Back to School,\" \"The Pope of Greenwich Village,\" \"Last Exit to Brooklyn,\" and \"Bright Angel.\" He also wrote and starred in \"Uncle Joe Shannon.\"\n\nHis TV credits included \"MASH,\" \"Miami Vice,\" \"The Equalizer,\" \"Law & Order,\" and \"The Sopranos.\"\n\nHe made his Broadway debut in 1986 opposite Robert De Niro and Ralph Macchio in \"Cuba & His Teddy Bear.\"\n\nDianne Feinstein\n\nDemocratic Senator Dianne Feinstein (June 22, 1933-September 28, 2023) broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics. The oldest sitting U.S. senator, she was a passionate advocate for issues important to her home state of California, including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control. But she was also a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.\n\nShe was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female board president in 1978, the year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down at City Hall alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk. Feinstein remembered finding Milk's body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures. (In 1993, during a debate on the assault weapons ban, Republican Senator Larry Craig accused Feinstein of having insufficient knowledge of guns. She retorted, ''Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.\")\n\nAfter Moscone's death, Feinstein became San Francisco's first female mayor. Even her critics credited her with a calming influence during a turbulent period, and she won reelection twice. In 1990 she won the Democratic nomination for California governor, but narrowly lost to Republican Pete Wilson. Two years later she ran for the Senate seat Wilson had vacated. Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer (who was running for the state's other Senate seat), and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race, boosted by voters galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings for nominee Clarence Thomas and the questioning of Anita Hill.\n\nOne of Feinstein's most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban the manufacture and sales of certain types of assault weapons, part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed in 1994. (The assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced.)\n\nFeinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009 – the first woman to lead the intelligence panel. Under her leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush's administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page \"torture report\" concluded among other things that waterboarding and other \"enhanced interrogation techniques\" did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report remains classified.\n\nFeinstein's experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics, telling the Associated Press in 2005 that she recognized \"women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right.\" But she also changed her views on some issues, such as same-sex marriage, which she initially opposed.\n\nIn 2008 she told \"Sunday Morning\" that in the harsh world of politics, what people want often goes beyond rights that are written into law. \"There is a right to happiness, too,\" she said. \"And happiness is an ethereal quality, but by golly, it sure is important.\"\n\nMichael Gambon\n\nIrish-English actor Sir Michael Gambon (October 19, 1940-September 27, 2023) earned fame for his stage work, films such as \"Gosford Park\" and \"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,\" and his starring role in the 1986 BBC miniseries \"The Singing Detective.\" But he is warmly remembered by younger audiences for his portrayal of Albus Dumbledore in six \"Harry Potter\" films.\n\nGambon took over the role of the Hogwarts headmaster from Richard Harris, who died in 2002, beginning with \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\"\n\nBorn in Dublin and raised in London, Gambon originally trained to be an engineer, like his father. He started work in the theater as a set builder, then made his stage debut in a production of \"Othello.\" In 1963 he got a small part in \"Hamlet\" at the National Theatre Company.\n\nHe won three Olivier Awards (for \"A Chorus of Disapproval,\" \"A View from the Bridge,\" and \"Man of the Moment\"), and was nominated for a Tony (for \"Skylight\").\n\nGambon became a household name in Britain by starring in Dennis Potter's TV drama \"The Singing Detective,\" in which a Raymond Chanderesque writer, suffering from a debilitating disease, falls into surreal reveries of childhood reminiscences and a musical fantasy about a private eye, \"Philip Marlow.\" Gambon won the BAFTA for best actor for his performance.\n\nHe also won two Screen Actors Guild Awards (for \"Gosford Park,\" and \"The King's Speech\" as King George V), and earned two Emmy nominations (for \"Path to War,\" playing President Lyndon B. Johnson, and \"Emma\").\n\nGambon once told the BBC he preferred to play \"villainous characters,\" such as gangster Eddie Temple in the crime thriller \"Layer Cake.\" He recently appeared in the Judy Garland biopic \"Judy.\"\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Guardian, Gambon demurred from analyzing the actor's craft: \"You just do it,\" he said. \"That's what acting is.\"\n\nBut he offered a more thoughtful explanation for how he accomplished crying on cue: \"I admit I try and summon up a powerful image. The one I often think of is that of a little girl in uniform, taken during the Vietnam war, with her clothes and body on fire because of an aerial bomb. I believe she recovered and is now a doctor, which makes me feel I'm not simply exploiting someone else's tragedy.\"\n\nBrooks Robinson\n\nHall of Famer Brooks Robinson (May 18, 1937-September 26, 2023) was one of the most gifted third basemen to play the game, with 16 consecutive Gold Glove Awards earned during his 23-year career with the Baltimore Orioles. Robinson was the American League's MVP in 1964, homered in Game 1 of the Orioles' 1966 sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers for their first World Series win, and almost single-handedly helped Baltimore defeat the Cincinnati Reds in the 1970 World Series.\n\nDubbed \"Mr. Oriole,\" his glovework made him the finest fielding third baseman in MLB history. In 2,870 career games (more than anyone else at that position), he established major league records for his position for fielding percentage, putouts, assists and double plays. He became known as \"the human vacuum cleaner.\" He also swatted 268 homers, with 1,357 RBIs, and had a lifetime batting average of .267.\n\nRobinson's most memorable performance came in the 1970 World Series, when he was MVP. He hit .429, homered twice, and drove in six runs, while deftly making numerous striking defensive plays that stifled the Reds' bats. The Orioles won the series 4 games to 1.\n\n\"I tell people that I played 23 seasons and I never did have five games in a row like I did in that World Series,\" Robinson said. \"It was a once-in-a-lifetime five-game series for me, and it just happened to be in a World Series.\"\n\nDavid McCallum\n\nActor David McCallum (September 19, 1933-September 25, 2023) was responsible for two endearing and enduring TV characters: first, as secret agent Illya Kuryakin in the hit 1960s spy series \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" and then, forty years later, as eccentric medical examiner Dr. Donald \"Ducky\" Mallard in CBS' \"NCIS.\"\n\nMcCallum's work on \"U.N.C.L.E.\" earned him two Emmy nominations; he received a third as an educator struggling with alcoholism in the 1969 drama, \"Teacher, Teacher.\"\n\nThe Scottish-born McCallum appeared in the Titanic drama \"A Night to Remember,\" \"Billy Budd,\" \"The Great Escape\" (as Ashley-Pitt, a.k.a. \"Dispersal\"), and \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (as Judas).\n\n\"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" about an international agency of crimefighters, debuted in 1964, and starred Robert Vaughn as Napoleon Solo, with McCallum as his Russian sidekick. The series ran for three years, and in 1983 Vaughn and McCallum were reunited for a TV movie sequel, \"The Return of the Man From U.N.C.L.E.\"\n\nIn 2003 McCallum began a 20-year run as pathologist \"Ducky\" Mallard on \"NCIS.\" McCallum said he thought Ducky \"looked a little silly, but it was great fun to do.\" In addition to \"NCIS,\" McCallum also appeared as Ducky on \"NCIS: New Orleans\" and \"JAG.\"\n\nHe also starred in the sci-fi series \"The Invisible Man\" and \"Sapphire and Steel,\" and has guest roles in such shows as \"Perry Mason,\" \"The Outer Limits,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"Murder, She Wrote,\" \"Hart to Hart,\" \"Law & Order,\" and \"Sex and the City.\" His other film and TV movie credits included \"Freud,\" \"Around the World Under the Sea,\" and \"Frankenstein: The True Story.\"\n\nIn 2007, while he was working on \"NCIS,\" McCallum told a reporter: \"I've always felt the harder I work, the luckier I get. I believe in serendipitous things happening, but at the same time, dedicating yourself to what you do is the best way to get along in this life.\"\n\nJimmy Buffett\n\nThe songs of Jimmy Buffett (December 25, 1946-September 1, 2023) spoke to anyone who'd ever dreamed of getting away from it all. Best known for his wistful but tunefully chirpy \"Margaritaville,\" Buffett's brand of Key West music was an intoxicating blend – a margarita glass filled with country, rock and Calypso, served with an umbrella and, of course, a shaker of salt.\n\nRaised in Alabama, Buffett tried to break into the music business in Nashville, and drifted to New Orleans in the early '70s, playing for tourists in the clubs and the streets as one of the city's sidewalk musicians. The experience, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, was formative: \"It made me a better professional player … This was my training ground for all of that.\"\n\nIn the years that followed, he moved to Key West, Florida, refining that country-meets-Caribbean sound, and his career took off. Over the course of 29 studio albums, he sang songs of regrets and hopes, his most famous being the 1977 hit \"Margaritaville,\" in which the narrator drowns his sorrows over a failed romance. The song seemed to launch a new genre, one he owned exclusively.\n\nBut somewhere along the way Buffett realized that he might be having a little too much fun, and cut down on the partying that was the subject matter of songs like \"Livingston Saturday Night,\" \"Why Don't We Get Drunk,\" \"Boat Drinks,\" and \"Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes.\" \"Hangovers became, like, surgical recovery,\" he said. \"And I didn't want to be one of those statistics. And I owed it to my parents, who had worked hard, you know, to give all of us kids what they could. I thought I owed it to them to not be that.\"\n\nAnd he also wanted to be in charge of a band, rather than simply be in one. \"I guess it kind of goes back to being raised in a seafaring family where there was ship captains and people in charge. Somehow I figured I'd rather be that than in the crew. I wanted to be the captain.\"\n\nBy the early 1990s Buffett, touring with his Coral Reefer Band, was one of the biggest acts in the business, with hordes of adoring fans who called themselves \"Parrotheads.\" At the same time, Buffett, a married father of three, also exercised his business sense, starting his own record label, and running a chain of Margaritaville bars, restaurants, hotels, tequila brands, margarita mixes, and clothing lines that made him a half-billionaire. He wrote New York Times bestselling books, including \"Tales of Margaritaville,\" \"Where Is Joe Merchant?,\" and \"A Pirate Looks at Fifty,\" and co-authored two children's books with his daughter, Savannah Jane. And in 2018, a jukebox musical, \"Escape to Margaritaville,\" opened on Broadway, replete with Buffett standards like \"Cheeseburger in Paradise,\" \"License to Chill,\" \"Son of a Son of a Sailor,\" \"One Particular Harbour,\" and \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere.\"\n\nIt was all in the service, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 1992, of helping audiences relax with a virtual vacation: \"I think that the biggest problem with 20th century life is we've all taken ourselves much too seriously. When we come to town, all of a sudden we're an excuse to go crazy. I think that's an essential part of life in the 20th century, and I'm glad it's my job.\"\n\nAll those years of touring were put on hold, for a time, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even then, Buffett couldn't stop giving fans a chance to head out to the beach for a spell; he performed online concerts, often for first responders. \"You know, historically you think about it, in times like this you still have to have a little fun,\" Buffett told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2020. \"You still have to have a rest from what's going on. And I knew that that was the case, because a lot of healthcare workers and doctors I've known for a long time have used my music in operating rooms and emergency rooms to calm down.\"\n\nBill Richardson\n\nBill Richardson (November 15, 1947-September 1, 2023), a two-term Democratic governor of New Mexico and an American ambassador to the United Nations, worked for years to secure the release of Americans held by foreign adversaries\n\nBorn in Pasadena, Calif., Richardson grew up in Mexico City with a Mexican mother and an American father, a U.S. bank executive. He attended prep school in Massachusetts and later went to Tufts University and its graduate school in international relations, earning a master's degree in international affairs. After working as a Capitol Hill staffer, in 1978 Richardson moved to New Mexico, to run for political office. He won a congressional seat in 1982.\n\nIt was while he was a Congressman in December 1994, during a visit to North Korean nuclear sites, that he received word an American helicopter pilot had been downed and his co-pilot killed. The White House enlisted Richardson's help and, after days of tough negotiations, he accompanied the remains of Chief Warrant Officer David Hilemon, while paving the way for Chief Warrant Officer Bobby Hall to return home. The following year, after a personal appeal from Richardson, Saddam Hussein freed two Americans who had been imprisoned for four months, charged with illegally crossing into Iraq from Kuwait.\n\nRichardson left Congress after 14 years, in 1997, to join the Clinton administration as U.N. ambassador. He later became secretary of energy.\n\nRichardson was elected Governor of New Mexico in 2002. During the campaign, he reportedly shook 13,392 hands in an eight-hour period, setting a world record (at one point held by Theodore Roosevelt). During his two terms he was the nation's only Hispanic governor. He described being governor as \"the most fun. You can get the most done. You set the agenda.\"\n\nAs governor, Richardson raised teachers' salaries, increased the minimum wage, expanded pre-K, pushed renewable energy requirements for utilities, and financed large-scale infrastructure projects, including a commuter rail system and a commercial spaceport. Once a supporter of capital punishment, he also signed legislation that repealed the state's death penalty.\n\nRichardson continued his freelance diplomacy while serving as governor, recovering the remains of American servicemen killed in the Korean War. He helped secure the 2021 release of American journalist Danny Fenster from a Myanmar prison, and also helped in the release of Americans detained in Russia and Iran. It was a role – bargaining with America's adversaries – that Richardson relished, once describing himself as \"the informal undersecretary for thugs.\"\n\n\"I plead guilty to photo-ops and getting human beings rescued and improving the lives of human beings,\" he once told reporters.\n\nBob Barker\n\nThe genial host of \"The Price Is Right\" for 35 years, Bob Barker (December 12, 1923-August 26, 2023) started each program, he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2008,\" by \"looking for someone with whom I could create laughter and have fun.\" And he ended each program with a plea that spoke to his passion for animal rights, by calling upon viewers to spay or neuter their pets.\n\nBarker grew up on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where his mom taught school after Barker's father died. He married his high school sweetheart, Dorothy Jo Gideon; served in the Navy as a pilot; and then tried his hand at broadcasting. After hosting a live audience participation program on radio, his wife told him, \"That's what you should do. You did that better than you've ever done anything else.\"\n\nBarker moved to Los Angeles, where he was called in for an interview with TV game show impresario Ralph Edwards. The result: \"Truth or Consequences,\" in which contestants engaged in crazy stunts. Barker hosted the show for 18 years, before going on to host a 1972 reboot of \"The Price Is Right\" on CBS. Welcoming contestants to vie for prizes by correctly guessing prices, Barker invited players to have a hand at a variety of challenges: Plinko, Dice Game, Hole in One, Master Key, Cliff Hangers (featuring a yodeling mountain climber), and of course the giant spinning wheel. The show's longevity was directly tied into Barker's effusive personality and ability to blend comfort television with high-stakes gamesmanship, topped by his authentic joy when a contestant won a car or appliance.\n\nAs Barker's fame grew, so did his commitment to animals, a passion he shared with his wife (who died in 1981). He donated millions for animal protection, including sponsoring programs to spay and neuter animals, to counter the problem of pet overpopulation. He angered the fur industry when he quit hosting the Miss Universe pageant in 1987 because sponsors refused to stop giving away fur coats as prizes. When asked if he feared hurting his career, Barker said no. \"My accountant had feelings about it, but I didn't,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I've always loved animals, and I always had animals.\"\n\nOver the course of his career, during which he taped more than 5,000 shows, Barker earned 19 Emmys, including a lifetime achievement award in 1999; he also won awards for protecting animals. He even played off his dapper, affable TV aura with a memorable cameo appearance in the 1996 comedy \"Happy Gilmore,\" in which he got to beat up Adam Sandler on a golf course.\n\nIn his 2009 memoir, \"Priceless Memories,\" he summed up his joy from hosting \"Price Is Right\" as the opportunity \"to watch people reveal themselves and to watch the excitement and humor unfold.\"\n\nSometimes the contestants were very revealing. On one occasion, a young woman wearing a tube top jumped up and down for joy at being called upon to \"come on down,\" so much so that both her breasts popped out. Barker, off-stage during the wardrobe malfunction, read the room wrong when he walked out: \"The audience was screaming. And I thought, 'They love me. They love me.' And then I came to terms with the fact that no audience had ever loved me this much!\"\n\nRobbie Robertson\n\nRobbie Robertson (July 5, 1943-August 9, 2023), for many years the lead guitarist for Bob Dylan and the principal songwriter for The Band, was part of a revolution in music. His most famous songs include \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" and \"The Weight.\"\n\nRaised in Toronto, Robertson (half-Mohawk, half-Jewish) started playing guitar at age 10, and by 16 was on the road full-time. He joined Arkansas rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins' band, where he met a young drummer, Levon Helm. The two clicked right away, and after Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Rick Danko also joined the group, they split off from Hawkins to form their own band. Originally called Levon and The Hawks, they would eventually become known as, simply, The Band.\n\nIn New York, they became Bob Dylan's backing musicians for his new tour. And when Dylan retreated to Woodstock, N.Y., in 1967, The Band rented a small house in nearby West Saugerties and turned its basement into a studio. They'd call the place The Big Pink. \"And it was like Valhalla,\" Robertson told \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Anthony Mason in 2016. \"We're in our own world. We're making music that nobody is supposed to ever hear.\"\n\nDrawing from folk, blues, gospel and country, The Band's groundbreaking debut album, \"Music From Big Pink,\" was released in 1968. They played at Woodstock, and for eight years were one of rock's most influential groups. But by the mid-seventies, drug problems were taking their toll on the group. The friction led to their final concert together, on Thanksgiving Day 1976, at San Francisco's Winterland. Dylan, Eric Clapton, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young and Van Morrison all showed up. Documented by director Martin Scorsese in the film \"The Last Waltz,\" it was rock's most famous farewell concert.\n\nRobertson said he expected that, after taking a break, the band would eventually regroup, as he told The Guardian in 2019: \"And then, as I said in the film, when I realized everybody forgot to come back, I had to read the writing on the wall.\"\n\nThe other members did eventually regroup, in 1983, but without Robertson. They recorded three albums. Manuel died in 1986, Danko in 1999, and Helm in 2012.\n\nRobertson wrote an autobiography, \"Testimony,\" published in 2016, and released several solo albums (including \"Robbie Robertson,\" \"Storyville,\" and \"How to Become Clairvoyant\"). He also collaborated with Scorsese on the music for several of his films, including the upcoming \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\"\n\nWilliam Friedkin\n\nHe was one of the mythic directors who helped usher in a glorious chapter of Hollywood in the late 1960s and early '70s, making innovative and thought-provoking films that pushed the envelope of technique and heralded a daring new approach to challenging material. William Friedkin (August 29, 1935-August 7, 2023) won an Academy Award for the police thriller \"The French Connection\" (whose highlight was the greatest car chase ever filmed), and shocked audiences with the horror classic \"The Exorcist.\"\n\nFriedkin started out directing live television and documentaries, including a 1966 film about police, \"The Thin Blue Line.\" His early movies reflect an eclectic mix of subject matter: \"Good Times,\" a knockabout farce starring Sonny & Cher; a filming of Harold Pinter's \"The Birthday Party\" starring Robert Shaw; the comedy \"The Night They Raided Minsky's\"; and \"The Boys in the Band,\" a film version of Mart Crowley's groundbreaking off-Broadway play about gay men.\n\nBased on a true story, \"The French Connection\" dramatized the efforts of a maverick New York City police detective to hunt down the criminal mastermind of a ring of heroin smugglers. Gene Hackman earned an Oscar for his performance as \"Popeye\" Doyle, a cop who abided by few rules. But as riveting as Hackman was, he could not compete for sheer bravado against the chase sequence in which Doyle, in a car, pursues an assassin fleeing aboard a subway train.\n\nFriedkin had to orchestrate the chase with no city permits (the movie's advisers from the NYPD knew how to get around that), and even filmed some of it himself from the backseat using a handheld camera as stunt driver Bill Hickman propelled his Pontiac LeMans, equipped with a police siren, through the streets of Brooklyn at up to 90 mph. Doyle car's collided with several vehicles along the way, and narrowly avoided a woman pushing a baby carriage. (Hackman as well crashed into a wall when he was driving himself.) The fact that many of the people seen in background had no idea they were in a movie only heightened the guerilla techniques used. \"There was absolutely no control,\" Friedkin admitted in a 2009 behind-the-scenes documentary. \"We didn't stop cross traffic, we didn't stop pedestrians from crossing the street. … People heard a siren and tried to get out of the way, but they didn't see a police car.\"\n\nFriedkin described the chase as a metaphor that reflected the obsession of Doyle, \"who would stop at nothing to get the guy he was looking for.\" But he acknowledged that he wouldn't replicate that experience today. \"We'd find another way of doing it … Thank God no one was hurt.\"\n\nIn addition to Hackman's win, \"The French Connection\" took Oscars for best picture, director, adapted screenplay and editing.\n\nFriedkin followed with a harrowing film version of William Peter Blatty's bestselling novel, \"The Exorcist,\" about Catholic priests trying to free a little girl possessed by the devil. Starring Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow and Linda Blair as young Regan, the movie was a tale of a crisis of faith, wrapped in the horror trappings of a young girl who undergoes terrifying physical transformations.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with New York magazine, Friedkin noted how, prior to Blatty's novel, there had been no public familiarity with exorcisms. When Friedkin, a non-Catholic, was granted permission to film a real exorcism led by the Vatican's exorcist in 2016, and later showed the footage to psychiatrists (who had added \"possession trance disorder\" to the DSM-IV), he was surprised by their reaction: \"'It looks authentic, but it doesn't have the classical symptoms.' And I said, 'What are the classical symptoms?' And they each said, 'Well, the head spinning, and levitation.' And I remember saying, 'Doctor, we invented that. Mr. Blatty wrote that, and I had to find a way to film it.' But I never heard of it. I never heard of that happening.\"\n\n\"The Exorcist\" received 10 Oscar nominations, and won two, for Blatty's script and for sound.\n\nFriedkin's later films and TV movies would not reach the box office heights of \"The Exorcist,\" but they demonstrated his willingness to tackle uncommercial material. His 1977 film \"Sorcerer,\" a remake of the French thriller \"The Wages of Fear,\" about men driving a truck of nitroglycerin though the jungle, failed with critics and ticket buyers but has since acquired a following. His next film was criticized even more: \"Cruising,\" a police drama starring Al Pacino as a detective going undercover to investigate the murders of gay men.\n\nBut he was back in the driver's seat with \"To Live and Die in L.A.,\" about law enforcement agents on the trail of a counterfeiter. It also featured a memorable chase, in which cars drive against traffic on a crowded Los Angeles highway.\n\nHe authored a candid memoir, \"The Friedkin Connection,\" and directed well-received movies adapted from Tracy Letts plays, including \"Bug\" and \"Killer Joe.\" Other credits included \"The Brink's Job,\" \"Jade,\" \"Rules of Engagement,\" a TV remake of \"12 Angry Men,\" and episodes of \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Tales From the Crypt,\" \"Rebel Highway,\" and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\"\n\nHis last film, \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,\" starring Kiefer Sutherland, is set to premiere at the Venice Film Festival next month.\n\nPaul Reubens\n\nFriends of actor and comedian Paul Reubens (August 27, 1952-July 30, 2023) remarked that he was a quiet, unassuming personality off-stage. So, it's ironic that he was best known for the character he created who was entirely the opposite: Pee-wee Herman, a boisterous, fun-loving child-man whose whimsical adventures and anarchic humor – not to mention his propensity to invite people to SCREAM REAL LOUD! – made him a 1980s pop cultural phenomenon.\n\nPee-wee was born when Reubens was part of the Groundlings, a Los Angeles improv group, in the 1970s. His 1981 live stage show, \"The Pee-wee Herman Show,\" modeled after a typical Saturday morning TV program, featured Reubens and a supporting cast that included Phil Hartman, John Paragon, Edie McClurg and Lynne Marie Stewart. The show was recorded as an HBO special.\n\nReubens took Pee-wee to the big screen with 1985's \"Pee-wee's Big Adventure,\" in which Pee-wee travels the country on the trail of his beloved stolen bicycle. Directed by Tim Burton and co-written by Hartman, the movie grossed $40 million, and led to \"Pee-wee's Playhouse,\" his actual Saturday morning TV series on CBS. Pee-wee's surreal playhouse was shared with a talking chair, a pterodactyl, a genie's disembodied head, and a magic screen that could transport Pee-wee to animated landscapes. The show, which ran for five seasons, won 15 Emmys, and attracted both children and adults with its anarchic humor.\n\n\"There's not really a good answer to how it was allowed to happen,\" Reubens told GQ magazine in 2016. \"It was all kind of a fluke.\"\n\nHe followed with a big-screen sequel, \"Big Top Pee-wee,\" set in a circus. But Reubens faced a real-life media circus after he was arrested in an adult movie theater in Sarasota, Florida, for indecent exposure. He was handed a small fine, but the damage was incalculable. CBS cancelled his show, and his Pee-wee character all but disappeared.\n\nYet, Reubens continued to work apart from his alter-ego. He had roles in \"Batman Returns,\" \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"Matilda,\" the Johnny Depp drama \"Blow,\" \"Mystery Men,\" and the TV series \"Murphy Brown,\" \"30 Rock,\" \"The Blacklist\" and \"Gotham.\"\n\nReubens slowly re-introduced Pee-wee, and eventually performed his show on Broadway in 2010. Judd Apatow produced a new Pee-wee movie in 2016 for Netflix, \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday.\"\n\nIn his GQ interview Reubens resisted analyzing the connections between himself and the larger-than-life character he created: \"It's not because I'm being coy. I just don't think about it. And when I do think about it, it ruins it for me. It takes all the joy out of what I do. And I'm afraid it would change what I do.\"\n\nSinéad O'Connor\n\nIrish singer-songwriter Sinéad O'Connor (Dec. 8, 1966-July 26, 2023), a gifted rebel whose powerful voice was matched with provocative statements, became a superstar in her mid-20s with her shattering 1990 cover of the Prince ballad \"Nothing Compares 2 U.\" The song topped charts around the world, aided by a music video in which O'Connor – with shaved head and piercing grey eyes – was featured in extreme closeup.\n\nGrowing up in an abusive household, as a teenager she spent time in a church-sponsored institution for girls. A nun gave O'Connor her first guitar, and soon she was singing and performing on the streets of Dublin, her influences ranging from Bob Dylan to Siouxsie and the Banshees.\n\n\"I suppose I've got to say that music saved me,\" she said in an interview with the Independent newspaper in 2013. \"I didn't have any other abilities, and there was no learning support for girls like me, not in Ireland at that time. It was either jail or music. I got lucky.\"\n\nHer 1987 debut album, \"The Lion and the Cobra,\" was followed by 1990's \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got.\" Rolling Stone magazine would name her 1991's artist of the year. The album, which went platinum, was nominated for four Grammys, winning one. (She skipped the Grammy ceremony, criticizing the music industry for its \"false and destructive materialistic values.\")\n\nA critic of the Roman Catholic Church well before allegations of sexual abuse were widely reported, O'Connor made headlines in October 1992 when she tore up a photo of Pope John Paul II while appearing on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" and denounced the church as the enemy. Shortly after, she appeared at an all-star tribute for Bob Dylan at Madison Square Garden and was immediately booed. Although consoled and encouraged by fellow musician Kris Kristofferson, she left the stage and broke down. Her performance was kept off the concert CD. O'Connor also faced boycotts from U.S. radio stations after she refused to perform at a New Jersey concert venue if they played the national anthem beforehand.\n\nShe announced her retirement from music in 2003, but she continued to record new material. She released 10 studio albums in all, her latest \"I'm Not Bossy, I'm the Boss,\" in 2014.\n\nIn 2010, when Pope Benedict XVI apologized to Ireland to atone for decades of abuse, O'Connor condemned the apology for not going far enough and called for Catholics to boycott Mass until there was a full investigation into the Vatican's role. \"People assumed I didn't believe in God. That's not the case at all. I'm Catholic by birth and culture and would be the first at the church door if the Vatican offered sincere reconciliation,\" she wrote in the Washington Post in 2010.\n\nO'Connor announced in 2018 that she had converted to Islam and would be adopting the name Shuhada' Davitt, later Shuhada Sadaqat, although she continued to use Sinéad O'Connor professionally.\n\nShe was public about her struggles with mental health issues. Diagnosed with bipolar disorder, she attempted suicide in 1999. When her teenage son Shane died by suicide last year, O'Connor tweeted there was \"no point living without him.\" She was soon hospitalized.\n\nHer final tweet, sent July 17, read: \"For all mothers of Suicided children,\" and linked to a Tibetan compassion mantra.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988.

But then Barry left her and her daughter, Kate.\n\nBirkin went to Paris to audition for the film \"Slogan\" and was paired with Serge Gainsbourg, then building a reputation as the French Bob Dylan. He'd just come out of a very unhappy affair with Brigitte Bardot. Birkin denied that that was intimidating: \"No. I thought, 'Gosh, if he'd been in love with the most beautiful woman in the world (which was Bardot at the time) and if he could take a look at me…' To the contrary!\"\n\nGainsbourg had written a song for Bardot that he now wanted Birkin to sing. \"Je t'aime… moi non plus,\" in which Birkin suggestively moaned, was incendiary for its time, and was banned by the BBC.\n\nFor 13 years, Birkin and Gainsbourg were an inseparable \"It\" couple, songwriter and muse, until the union was ended by his drinking problem. Birkin, who had had another daughter with Serge (renowned actress Charlotte Gainsbourg), moved in with French director Jacques Doillon; they had a daughter (Lou, an award-winning singer). But Serge stayed in the picture, writing songs for Birkin until his death in 1991. \"And when Serge died, everything else collapsed,\" she said. \"Nothing was really the same again.\"\n\nBirkin and Doillon split, and she focused on her three daughters. Kate Barry, her oldest, a successful photographer, battled depression. In 2013, Kate fell from her apartment window, an apparent suicide. For nearly three years, Birkin could barely leave her Paris home.\n\nBut in her 70s, Birkin began to find her way again, touring the world with an orchestra performing Serge Gainsbourg's songs (including at a 2018 concert at New York's Carnegie Hall).\n\nYet, she became synonymous with a handbag, thanks to a serendipitous airline upgrade in 1983, when she was seated next to the CEO of Hermès, to whom she suggested a larger variation of their popular handbag. He sketched out a design on a handy air sickness bag. The Birkin Bag was born.\n\n\"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Anthony Mason said to Birkin in 2018, \"It's so funny that, after all this, you might be known for a bag.\"\n\n\"Well, could be worse!\" she laughed.\n\nIn 2021 her daughter profiled Birkin in the intimate documentary \"Jane by Charlotte\" – a testimonial to the mother-daughter relationship that endured the intrusions of fame, from both sides, and to a life which Birkin has forged for herself in France, partly in the spotlight, partly cloistered in nature, and partly paying tribute to her late lover Serge. News of Birkin's health – a cancer diagnosis, and a stroke – gave the film a somewhat uncomfortable immediacy of purpose (Get Mother on film before it's too late), but the bond the two shared was palpable, strong and entrancing.\n\nTony Bennett\n\nSinger Tony Bennett (August 3, 1926-July 21, 2023) was one of the most popular interpreters of jazz, pop and Broadway standards, thanks to his joyful and stirring renditions of such classics as \"Rags to Riches,\" \"The Way You Look Tonight,\" and his signature song, \"I Left My Heart in San Francisco.\" The recipient of 20 Grammy Awards during his seven-decade career, Bennett recorded 60 studio albums and dozens of live albums and compilations. Seven were Top 10 albums on the Billboard charts.\n\nBut he was inextricably linked to one song above all others – a song that he first rehearsed without ever having set foot in San Francisco. Bennett recalled for \"Sunday Morning\" in 2014 how his music director, Ralph Sharon, found the song as they were headed to San Francisco for the first time. The two rehearsed it one afternoon at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas: \"And the bartender said, 'I don't wanna interrupt you two fellows, but if you ever record that, I'm gonna be the first guy to buy the record.' And we felt a little encouraged! And when I got to San Francisco, at rehearsal I started singing it, everybody ran up to me and said, 'You've gotta record this song.'\n\n\"Most artists that are connected with one famous thing, they get upset: Why should it just be one thing? What about all the other things that I do?\" Bennett told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"But I feel different. I love 'San Francisco,' the song. I sing it every night like it was the first time I ever sang it.\"\n\nHe would even sing it during a 1994 appearance on \"MTV Unplugged,\" in which he performed with Elvis Costello and k.d. lang. A recording of the concert went platinum and won two Grammys, including album of the year.\n\nBennett earned a new generation of fans in 2014 when, at 88, he teamed with singer Lady Gaga, 60 years his junior, for an album of duets, \"Cheek to Cheek\" – standards that included \"Anything Goes,\" \"I Can't Give You Anything But Love,\" \"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing).\" The album went to #1 and won the Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album.\n\nRaised in Astoria, Queens, Bennett nurtured artistic expression both through music and art. He attended the High School of Industrial Art in Manhattan where one art teacher told him, \"'You know, you're a very good singer.' And he got all the other teachers mad at him, 'cause [I'm] supposed to be studying art, not music!\"\n\nHe dropped out of school to help support his family, earning money while singing in restaurants and saloons. After World War II, thanks to the G.I. Bill, Bennett attended the American Theatre Wing, taking vocal classes.\n\nSigned by Columbia, Bennett's first single, \"Because of You,\" went to #1 in 1951. He followed with such hits as \"Cold, Cold Heart,\" \"Rags to Riches,\" \"There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight,\" \"Stranger in Paradise,\" and \"Can You Find It In Your Heart?\"\n\nLater hits by Bennett included \"The Good Life,\" \"Who Can I Turn To (When Nobody Needs Me),\" \"Fly Me to the Moon,\" \"The Shadow of Your Smile,\" and \"For Once In My Life.\"\n\nBennett struggled in the 1970s, as musical tastes in the industry changed, and his albums didn't find an audience. He was without a manager or a recording label. His own record company failed. His live performances were limited to Las Vegas. Having divorced his first wife, his second marriage was faltering. He had a drug addiction, and the IRS initiated proceedings to take his house.\n\nBennett's son, Danny, took over as manager, and got him re-signed with Columbia Records; he also got his father on \"MTV Unplugged.\" \"I realized that young people had never heard those songs,\" Tony told AARP magazine. \"Cole Porter, Gershwin – they were like, 'Who wrote that?'\"\n\nIn early 2021 Bennett revealed in an article for AARP magazine that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He still rehearsed twice a week in his living room. And in August 2021 he performed what would be his final concert, at New York's Radio City Music Hall, sharing the stage with Lady Gaga. His family wasn't sure he would be in condition to perform, but when it came time to rehearse, Bennett's accompanist, Lee Musiker, began playing, and suddenly the legendary showman was back. He had no notes, no cue cards. He sang an hour-long set from memory.\n\nOn what was Bennett's 95th birthday, a sell-out crowd was waiting. His third wife, Susan, told \"60 Minutes,\" \"Once he saw the audience, and, you know, and he raises his hands, I knew we were alright because he became himself. He just turned on. You know, it was like a light switch.\"\n\nBennett sang more than a dozen songs and got at least 20 standing ovations.\n\nA few days later, Bennett had no memory of playing Radio City at all.\n\nAlan Arkin\n\nIn the 2006 indie comedy \"Little Miss Sunshine,\" Alan Arkin (March 26, 1934-June 29, 2023) played the irascible, opinionated and heroin-addicted grandfather of a dysfunctional family traveling cross-country to enter their little girl in a kiddie beauty pageant.\n\nIt's a role Arkin almost didn't get. \"They thought I was too virile for the part, which is the best turn-down I've ever had in my life,\" Arkin, then 72, told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2007.\n\n\"Little Miss Sunshine\" was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival. Fox Searchlight grabbed the distribution rights for a then-record $10.5 million, and the movie went on to earn more than $100 million at the box office and four Academy Award nominations. Arkin went home with an Oscar for best supporting actor.\n\nIn the beginning people paid attention to Arkin not for his acting but for his singing, with a folk group called the Tarriers. He did it for pocket money, at first, but after their hit, \"The Banana Boat Song\" (which Arkin co-wrote), he questioned his career choice: \"I got to the Olympia Theater in Paris and I was playing the guitar and singing my brains out, and looked down at myself with my black satin pants on and my sports shirt opened to the navel. And I said, 'What the hell am I doing? Who am I?' I said, 'I gotta get back to acting.' And I quit the next day — and starved for another couple of years.\"\n\nHe joined Second City, a bold new improvisational comedy group in Chicago. It launched his acting career. He won a Tony Award for \"Enter Laughing,\" and for his film debut, in \"The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming,\" he received a best actor Oscar nomination as a Soviet submariner stranded in New England. Two years later he received a second nomination playing a deaf mute in \"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.\"\n\nThe film roles cascaded: \"Wait Until Dark,\" \"Carch-22,\" \"Little Murders,\" \"Popi,\" \"Last of the Red Hot Lovers,\" \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins,\" \"Hearts of the West,\" \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,\" \"The In-Laws,\" \"Simon,\" \"The Magician of Lublin,\" \"Edward Scissorhands,\" \"Glengarry Glen Ross,\" \"Grosse Pointe Blank,\" \"Get Smart,\" \"Argo,\" and the TV series \"The Kominsky Method\" – each showing the range of Arkin's ability to wring laughs, or heartache, from a character.\n\nOn Broadway, he directed the Neil Simon comedy \"The Sunshine Boys,\" and Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf.\"\n\nIn a 2020 Guardian interview, Arkin, who'd just published a memoir titled \"Out of My Mind,\" remarked on how, with age, he was less drawn to music and great books and more to solitude and silence: \"Looking at the garden. Having a relationship with trees and flowers and the sky. That's what's profound to me now.\"\n\nWhen told he sounded like he was preparing for the end, Arkin scoffed: \"There is no end. There was no beginning and there is no end. We are all a part of that endless flow.\"\n\nJohn Goodenough\n\nScientist John Goodenough (July 25, 1922-June 25, 2023) was a Nobel Prize recipient for his work developing the lithium-ion battery. Goodenough, who shared the 2019 prize in chemistry with M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino, became, at 97, the oldest Nobel winner in history.\n\nLithium-ion batteries, the first truly portable and rechargeable batteries, took more than a decade to develop. Goodenough, Whittingham and Yoshino each had unique breakthroughs that laid the foundation for developing a commercial rechargeable battery. Whittingham's work in the 1970s harnessed the tendency of lithium, the lightest metal, to give away its electrons to make a battery capable of generating just over two volts. By 1980, Goodenough had built on Whittingham's work and doubled the battery's capacity to four volts by using cobalt oxide in the cathode, one of the two electrodes that make up the ends of a battery.\n\nThat battery remained too explosive for general commercial use. Yoshino's work in the 1980s eliminated the volatile pure lithium from the battery and instead opted for lithium ions that are safer.\n\nThe first lightweight, safe, durable and rechargeable commercial batteries entered the market in 1991, transforming the world by making portable electronic devices such as cellphones, computers and pacemakers, as well as electric cars, feasible.\n\nGoodenough, who was head of the Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford in England when he made his lithium-ion discovery, joined the University of Texas faculty in 1986, and was still teaching and researching battery materials and solid-state science and engineering problems when he won the Nobel Prize.\n\n\"Live to 97 and you can do anything,\" Goodenough said, adding he was grateful he hadn't been forced to retire at 65.\n\nFrederic Forrest\n\nActor Frederic Forrest (December 23, 1936-June 23, 2023) was best-known for his performance as Jay \"Chef\" Hicks, who accompanies Martin Sheen's Captain Willard upriver and encounters a tiger in the jungle, in the Francis Ford Coppola classic \"Apocalypse Now.\" That same year, he played an Army deserter who becomes Bette Midler's lover in \"The Rose,\" for which he received an Oscar nomination.\n\nHis other film roles included \"The Conversation,\" \"The Missouri Breaks,\" the musical \"One from the Heart,\" \"Hammett\" (playing novelist Dashiell Hammett), \"Valley Girl,\" \"The Two Jakes,\" \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream,\" \"Music Box,\" \"Falling Down,\" and \"All the King's Men.\"\n\nBorn in Waxahachie, Texas, Forrest studied theater in New York City, making his stage debut in 1966 in \"Viet Rock,\" an off-Broadway musical. He then migrated to Los Angeles, where he captured TV roles, including a man wrongly confined in a mental ward in \"Larry.\" He played an assassin in \"Ruby and Oswald\"; a bandit in \"Lonesome Dove\"; policemen in \"21 Jump Street\" and \"The Deliberate Stranger\"; and an imprisoned Civil War Army sergeant in \"Andersonville.\"\n\nGlenda Jackson\n\nGlenda Jackson (May 9, 1936-June 15, 2023) had careers on two distinctly different stages: as an actress, she won two Academy Awards, two BAFTAs and a Tony; and, as a member of Parliament for nearly a quarter-century, she was a formidable spokesperson for labor issues and against conservative policies.\n\nBorn into a working-class family in Birkhenhead, northwest England, Jackson trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company. She became a leading star on stage in the avant-garde drama \"Marat/Sade,\" directed by Peter Brook. After transferring to Broadway, the show earned Jackson her first Tony nomination, and she repeated her performance in the 1967 film version.\n\nShe won her first Oscar for Ken Russell's D.H. Lawrence adaptation, \"Women in Love,\" a powerful romantic drama costarring Oliver Reed and Alan Bates. Jackson then won two Emmys for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth I in the BBC/\"Masterpiece Theatre\" series, \"Elizabeth R.\"\n\nShe won her second Academy Award for a romantic-comedy, playing a married man's mistress, in \"A Touch of Class.\" She received two other Oscar nominations in the '70s, for \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\" and \"Hedda.\"\n\nOther notable films showed Jackson's enormous breadth, and willingness to switch from serious or challenging roles (\"Mary, Queen of Scots\"; \"The Music Lovers\"; \"Stevie,\" as the poet Stevie Smith; \"The Rainbow\"), to frothy, lightweight fare (\"Nasty Habits\"; \"House Calls\"; \"Hopscotch\"; \"Turtle Diary\"). She earned three more Tony nominations in the 1980s, for \"Rose,\" \"Strange Interlude\" and \"Macbeth.\"\n\nIn her 50s, Jackson dropped out of acting and went into politics, drawn into that world, she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, by what she considered to be the socially-destructive policies of the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\" \"For me, the final straw was when she said there's no such thing as a society,\" Jackson said.\n\nShe won election to Parliament in 1992 on the Labor Party ticket. She served as a minister for transport in Prime Minister Tony Blair's government in 1997, but came to be at odds with Blair over the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She said Blair's decision to enter the U.S.-led war without United Nations' authorization left her \"deeply, deeply ashamed.\"\n\nJackson's blunt manner and outspokenness continued throughout her political career. In 2013 when Thatcher died and other MPs paid polite tribute, she didn't: \"Everything I had been taught to regard as a vice - and I still regard them as vices - under Thatcherism was in fact a virtue: Greed, selfishness, no care for the weaker, sharp elbows, sharp knees,\" she said in Parliament.\n\nShe recalled, \"I think they were surprised, because up until that point practically everything had been praise. I mean, talk about rewriting history. I mean, it was astonishing! But then they calmed down actually.\"\n\nOnce she decided to end her political career, it wasn't long before her old life came calling. She returned to the stage with one of the most artistic and physically-demanding roles ever written: Shakespeare's King Lear. Her gender-bending turn opened at London's Old Vic in 2016 and later played on Broadway.\n\nIn 2018 she starred on Broadway in the Edward Albee drama \"Three Tall Women.\" Jackson took home a Tony for her blistering portrayal of a difficult-to-deal-with woman in her 90s. And her return to the screen in the movie \"Elizabeth Is Missing,\" playing a woman with Alzheimer's trying to solve a mystery, earned her a second BAFTA. She recently completed filming \"The Great Escaper,\" costarring Michael Caine.\n\nIt was a stage in her life when she received meaty roles, after long and famously complaining about the lack of good parts for women. \"I mean, I can remember when I was still doing films - and I'm going back a long way now - it was not infrequent to have a woman in a film to prove that the hero wasn't gay,\" Jackson told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I mean, you saw that was the kind of reason for being. We've still got a long, long way to go.\"\n\nCormac McCarthy\n\nThough fame and commercial success came to him later in life, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Cormac McCarthy (July 20, 1933-June 13, 2023) had long earned critical acclaim for his novels, written in prose that drew comparison to William Faulkner. Set in the stark and forbidding landscapes and rundown communities of Appalachia and the Southwest, McCarthy's works are populated with drifters, violent criminals and broken men, fated to suffer, and to cause suffering.\n\nIn addition to his \"Border Trilogy\" novels set along the Mexico border (the National Book Award-winning \"All the Pretty Horses,\" \"The Crossing,\" and \"Cities of the Plain\"), McCarthy wrote \"No Country for Old Men\" (adapted by Joel and Ethan Coen into a film that won four Oscars, including best picture), the post-apocalyptic father-and-son journey \"The Road\" (winner of the Pulitzer Prize), and \"Blood Meridian,\" an ultra-violent tale of bounty hunters along the Texas-Mexico border murdering Indians, which has been hailed as one of the greatest American novels.\n\nMcCarthy, who was raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, wrote his first novel, 1965's \"The Orchard Keeper,\" while working as an auto mechanic in Chicago. He sent it to Faulker's editor at Random House, Albert Erskine, who would become McCarthy's longtime editor. He followed with the novels \"Outer Dark,\" \"Child of God,\" and \"Suttree.\" He received a MacArthur Fellowship (the so-called \"genius grant\") in 1981, which he used to research \"Blood Meridian.\"\n\nHe also wrote two plays, \"The Stonemason\" and \"The Sunset Limited,\" and several screenplays, including \"The Gardener's Son\" and \"The Counselor.\"\n\nIn 2007, after Oprah Winfrey chose \"The Road\" for her book club, McCarthy consented to a rare interview, in which he described to Winfrey the book's origin: a trip he took with his young son to El Paso, Texas, early in the decade. Standing at the window of a hotel in the middle of the night as his son slept nearby, he started to imagine what El Paso might look like 50 or 100 years in the future. \"I just had this image of these fires up on the hill ... and I thought a lot about my little boy,\" he said.\n\nThere would be a long period of silence from McCarthy – 15 years – until news of two connected novels to be published back-to-back in 2022: \"The Passenger\" and \"Stella Maris,\" narratives about a brother and sister, mutually obsessed siblings, and the legacy of their father, a physicist who had worked on atomic technology. Both would be New York Times bestsellers.\n\nWhen asked by Winfrey if he was passionate about writing, McCarthy said, \"I like what I do.\n\n\"Some writers have said in print that they hated writing, it was just a chore and a burden. I certainly don't feel that way about it. Sometimes it's difficult but you always have this image of the perfect thing which you can never achieve but which you never stop trying to achieve,\" he said. \"That's your signpost and your guide. You can't plot things out. You just have to trust in, you know, wherever it comes from.\"\n\nTreat Williams\n\nActor Treat Williams (December 1, 1951-June 12, 2023) appeared in more than 120 film and TV roles, most notably in the movies \"Hair\" and \"Prince of the City\" (both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations), \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" \"Smooth Talk,\" and the TV series \"Everwood,\" in which he starred as Dr. Andrew Brown, a widowed brain surgeon from Manhattan who moves with his two children to a Colorado mountain town.\n\nOther film credits included \"The Eagle Has Landed,\" \"1941,\" \"The Pursuit of D.B. Cooper,\" \"Flashpoint,\" \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,\" \"Mulholland Falls,\" \"Deep Rising,\" and \"127 Hours.\"\n\nHe starred opposite Ann-Margret and Beverly D'Angelo in a TV adaptation of \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" garnering a third Golden Globe nomination; he also earned an Emmy nomination for his role in the TV movie \"The Late Shift,\" playing Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz. Other TV credits included \"J. Edgar Hoover,\" \"Heartland,\" \"Chicago Fire,\" \"Chesapeake Shores,\" \"The Christmas House,\" and \"Blue Bloods.\"\n\nHis stage appearances included the Broadway shows \"Grease,\" \"The Pirates of Penzance,\" and \"Follies.\"\n\nRoger Payne\n\nBiologist Roger Payne (January 29, 1935-June 10, 2023) spurred a worldwide environmental conservation movement with his discovery that whales could sing. During a 1967 research trip to Bermuda, in which a Navy engineer provided him with a recording of curious underwater sounds documented while listening for Russian submarines, Payne identified the haunting tones as songs whales sing to one another.\n\nHe saw the discovery of whale song as a chance to spur interest in saving the giant animals, who were disappearing from the planet. In 1970 Payne produced the album \"Songs of the Humpback Whale.\" A surprise hit, the record galvanized a global movement to end the practice of commercial whale hunting and save the whales from extinction. The impact of the whale song discovery on the nascent environmental movement was immense. Payne's album remains the best-selling environmental album in history.\n\nPayne founded Ocean Alliance in 1971 to advocate for the protection of whales and dolphins. The organization played a role in the 1972 passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the 1982 commercial whaling moratorium passed by the International Whaling Commission.\n\nWhale song also entered the popular imagination, such as in \"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\" in which the crew of the Enterprise travels back in time to retrieve whales that could communicate via whale song with an alien probe.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with Nautilus Quarterly Payne said he knew almost instantly that the sounds were indeed whales once he heard the recording in the loud engine room of the research vessel. \"In spite of the racket, what I heard blew my mind,\" he said.\n\nFrançoise Gilot\n\nFrançoise Gilot (November 26, 1921-June 6, 2023) was 22 when she painted her self-portrait in 1944, soon after she'd started a relationship with a much older artist, Pablo Picasso. When asked in 2017 by \"Sunday Morning\" whether it was intimidating to be working in the shadow of a master, Gilot laughed: \"If you have to be intimidated, then you don't go there. Either you have courage, or you don't in life. If you have courage, you receive a few bumps here and there. But on the whole, it's more interesting.\"\n\nGilot's very interesting life took a turn after attending law school for two years. \"It has been very helpful to me,\" she said. \"Because a painter is a man or woman who has to do contracts, and the dealers are not the most reliable people sometimes.\"\n\nIt was in 1943, during the German occupation of Paris, that Gilot met Picasso. She was 21; he was 61. Gilot would later write, \"It was a catastrophe I didn't want to avoid.\"\n\nWhile Picasso frequently used her image as inspiration, Gilot continued quietly working herself, not (she reflected) showing too much personality. They would spend 10 years together, and have two children, Claude and Paloma. But then Gilot became the only one of Picasso's women to walk away. She recalled his self-assurance: \"'Ha, ha, ha. Nobody leaves a man like me!' I said, 'Wait and see!'\"\n\nGilot's 1964 memoir, \"Life with Picasso,\" became an international bestseller, despite the artist's attempts in court to block publication. She moved to the U.S., and attracted another giant of the 20th century: Dr. Jonas Salk, pioneer of the polio vaccine. They married in 1970.\n\nGilot continued working in New York City, creating thousands of paintings. When asked at age 95 if she would give up painting, she replied, \"No. Why should I? It will give me up. But I won't give it up. I don't want to commit suicide. And nobody wants to kill me. So, what can I do?\"\n\nAstrud Gilberto\n\nBrazilian singer Astrud Gilberto (March 29, 1940-June 5, 2023) was born into a musical family, one that was also at ease with foreign languages (her mother was a singer and violinist, her father a linguistics professor). As a teenager, she joined a circle of musical friends that would grow to include a rising star in Rio's emerging bossa nova scene, singer-songwriter-guitarist João Gilberto, whom she soon married.\n\nAstrud became an overnight, unexpected superstar in 1964, thanks to knowing just enough English to be recruited by the makers of the classic bossa nova album \"Getz/Gilberto\" (featuring saxophonist Stan Getz) to sing the wistful ballad, \"The Girl from Ipanema.\" Already a hit in South America, the song's lyrics were rewritten to include English to expand its appeal. Astrud joined João in the studio, singing the chorus.\n\nTall and tan and young and lovely\n\nThe girl from Ipanema goes walking\n\nAnd when she passes\n\nEach one she passes goes, \"Ah\"\n\nIn a 2002 interview posted on her website, Astrud recalled, \"I'll never forget that while we were listening back to the just-recorded song at the studio's control room, Stan said to me, with a very dramatic expression: 'This song is going"
