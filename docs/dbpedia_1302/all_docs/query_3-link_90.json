        "text": "Mary Neal Seigla Williamson of South Boston died Thursday, Aug. 11, 2022 at the age of 85. Mary was born in Clover on Aug. 27, 1936 and was the daughter of the late Wyatt and Gracie Hudson Neal. On June 2, 1974 she trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as her Savior and began a new journey in life with her first husband, Harry Norman Seigla who also became a Christian during this time.\n\nMary was fortunate to have had two Christian husbands who preceded her in death — Harry Norman Seigla, who died in 1984 and Leroy Williamson, who died in 2018. Also preceding her in death was beloved son-in-law Sam Russell Jr. who always called her “Mer.” During the years of her marriage to Harry Norman Seigla, she worked as a CNA at Berry Hill Nursing Home for many years and gave countless hours to help those who were hurting and in need of an understanding, kind-hearted friend. While married to Leroy Williamson, she spent many days going to church camp meetings and revivals, helping to prepare meals for those who attended as well as cleaning and helping inside the church.\n\nShe was a charter member of Bible Baptist Church, Cluster Springs. She had a special love for Chris McGee, pastor, wife Lucy and children as well as her church family. Near the end of her journey in life, she became a resident at Clarksville Health and Rehab. Special thanks goes to Amy Ellington and nursing staff for helping to make the transition to her heavenly home.\n\nMary is survived by her children, Harry (Harrison) Seigla and wife Marian of Mechanicsville, Alice Russell of Randolph, Tim Seigla and wife Deena of Wedowee, Ala., Joe Seigla and wife Faye of Greensboro, N.C. and adopted daughter Lorrie Rodriguez of Alton. Grandchildren include Brian Seigla and wife Sara, Drew Seigla and wife Stephanie, April Daniel and husband Irving, Beth Lassitter and husband Todd, Grace Kelehar and husband Curtis, Amanda Walker and husband Tony, Joshua Seigla and wife Aubrey, Shera Seigla and Rodney, Joanna Fields and husband Andy, Jessica Williams, Kasey Bratton and husband Trevor, Danielle Shelton and husband Ethan, Ryan Williams-Young and husband Robert. Also surviving are 21 great grandchildren and four great great grandchildren and a host of nieces and nephews. She also had two surviving sisters-in-law, Mildred Wilson and Diane Williamson.\n\nMary Williamson was preceded in death by her parents, Wyatt and Gracie Neal, brothers Lee and Robert Neal; sisters Roseanne Neal, Virginia Davis Cassidy, twin sisters Polly Dickerson and Dolly Hoke Ligon.\n\nA funeral was held Sunday, Aug. 14, at Bible Baptist Church. The burial was private. The family received friends at the church one hour prior to the service."
