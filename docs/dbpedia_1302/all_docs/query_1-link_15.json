        "text": "The first railway station to serve Littlehampton opened in 1846. It was named Arundel & Littlehampton and was situated to the north of the town on the West Coast mainline. The station closed in 1863 when a branch line was created to the town in its current location. The new station made Littlehampton accessible to visitors and made it a popular resort town, and improved infrastructure for trade.\n\nOn 4th August 1920 a major accident occurred when an inbound train’s brakes failed. The train came to a halt in Albert Road after careering into buffer stops and the brick boundary wall behind. Around 30 passengers were onboard at the time, 13 people suffered minor injuries. The driver and firemen jumped from the train just before it crashed.\n\nDating back to 1890, Mary Patrick Brennan began a mission in the town – under instruction from Canon Neave (at the time the Parish Priest of St Catherine’s) – to look after children. Her initial budget of £5 established an independent religious congregation known as ‘Franciscan Sisters for Home Missions’ in 1911 caring for boys and girls. The sisters stopped caring for children in the 1970s following a change of Government legislation, instead focussing on nursing for the elderly at a newly built St Joseph’s Nursing Home. They remain active members of the community to this day.\n\nNow owned and occupied as offices by Littlehampton Town Council and Littlehampton Museum, Manor House was originally built in 1827 by the Duke of Norfolk. It was leased by Thomas Olliver who also leased the adjoining home farm from the Duke.\n\nManor House was later leased to Dr Candy who lived there for many years. He was the first chairman of the local Board of Health. Boards of health were mandated by the government to look after sanitation and related public health matters. The board was the first form of local government and was superseded in 1894 by the Littlehampton Urban District Council.\n\nBy 1912 the Murray family leased the Manor House. Capt Murray died in combat in 1914 but his wife resided here until 1932. In this time she became an important figure involved in local politics. In 1925 she became the first female district councillor. The Urban District Council (now Littlehampton Town Council) bought the property from the Duke of Norfolk in 1934 and extended it and remain custodians, today.\n\nThe first museum in Littlehampton opened in 1928 ultimately moving to the Manor House in 1991."
