        "text": "On May 1, 1890, the Elitches opened their Zoological Gardens and Grand Pavilion Theatre to the public. The biggest draw was the animal collection, which included two lions, four bears, two camels, two wolves, and eight monkeys. P.T. Barnum was a visitor and highly complimented John on his zoo. Colorado senators Edward Wolcott and H.A.W. Tabor were friends and attendees.\n\nIn addition to the zoo, people were entertained at the Grand Pavilion Theatre, which was an open, 12-sided, canopied pavilion with room for 600 under its cover. Vaudeville provided the entertainment.\n\nThe Elitches had a very successful year. Clearing some $35,000 (or $775,000 in present-day dollars), John organized a traveling show, the Goodyear, Shilling & Elitch minstrel troupe. The troupe played in many Colorado theaters before moving on to California, where John contracted pneumonia. Mary raced to his side and was present when he died on March 10, 1891 in San Francisco. The couple did not have any children. Mary was left destitute and was forced to sell both the farm and lake properties.\n\nA syndicate of nine Denver businessmen purchased the Gardens for $250,000 and placed 100,000 shares of stock on the market at one dollar per share. The Elitch Zoological Gardens and Grand Pavilion Theatre opened for its second season under new ownership. The 1891 summer season was most notable for opening of the new Theatre. It was designed by local architects Rudolf Liden and Charles Lee in the rustic “stick” or “shingle” style that was emerging at the time. It featured a two-story open veranda surrounding the two-story octagonal enclosed auditorium. A backstage building anchored the western side, and the signature castle-like cupola crowned the roof. Over the next 25 years modifications to the stairways, entrances, and the enclosure of the veranda resulted in the auditorium’s historic and current configuration.\n\nVaudeville featuring pantomime, comedy, minstrels, equilibrists, jugglers, animal acts, high-wire acts, strongman acts, and trick bicycles acts entertained the crowds in the first years. Professor Baldwin’s Grand Balloon Ascension and Parachute Jump proved to be a very popular attraction. Occasionally light opera was staged.\n\nSummer stock appeared for the 1893 season. The Frank Norcross Stock Company was engaged and mounted a different show each week for the 15 weeks of the season. This was the first summer stock theatre season in America.\n\nBank closings during the summer, and the Panic of 1893, resulted in a sharp decline in attendance at the Gardens. The Gardens closed in mid-August, and the syndicate went into receivership. Mary Elitch repurchased her Gardens at a sheriff’s sale on April 14, 1894 for $150,000. For the next two years, less expensive vaudeville returned to the Elitch stage. Summer stock returned to Elitch’s in 1896. This was also the year the Vitascope moving picture premiered in Colorado, at Elitch’s on August 14, just a few months after its debut in New York City.\n\nMary Elitch was a petite brunette, the darling of the Denver Post newspaper, and one of the most highly regarded women in Denver. She was known for her generous spirit and fondness for animals and children. The Gardens were a safe haven for children for generations. Mothers reputedly would put their children on the streetcar (and later the bus) and tell the driver to just let them off at Elitch’s. Mary instituted a weekly Children’s Day on Tuesdays when additional educational and entertainment was brought in for the kiddies. The Gardens were the site of the the annual outings sponsored by the Ladies’ Aid Society, Colorado Pioneers Society, and other worthy causes.\n\nShe was dubbed “The Lady of the Gardens” shortly after being widowed, and retained this mystique for the remainder of her days. A London magazine called her a “splendid type of the American Girl” and claimed that she was the only woman in the world to possess and manage a zoo. The most notable members of her menagerie were the lions and bears, many of which she bottle fed and raised from cubs. She added a seal, an albino water buffalo, an elephant and other creatures to her menagerie. She hitched an ostrich to her light trotting cart to drive around the grounds.\n\nThere are many stories about Mary and her animals. Harry Tammen, co-owner of the Denver Post and owner of the Sells-Floto Circus, went to New York seeking lions for his collection. He was directed right back to Denver, to the lady zookeeper – Mary Elitch – who had the finest lion in captivity. She did not sell any of her animals to him.\n\nInternational stage star, Sarah Bernhardt, captivated a young lioness by stroking the animal through the bars of her cage into an almost catatonic state. Mary gave the lioness the name “Sarah” that day.\n\nMary told a story about one day when one of her large bears escaped from its cage. Workmen who were digging the Bear Pit nearby ran for their lives, while Mary seized a broom, got in front of the bruin, and yelled “Shoo! Shoo!” while shaking her skirts and broom. The bear turned around and went right back into its cage. She also discovered that music indeed could soothe the savage beast, and that her bears were most susceptible to the soothing sound of the violin.\n\nMusic was very important to the Elitches. As of the opening day a band entertained guests. In 1897 the forerunner of the Trocadero Ballroom hosted the Gardens orchestra and held dances for both young and older patrons. The Trocadero expanded to be a large as the Theatre, and was the site of a special evening when a scene from ‘The Glenn Miller Story’ starring James Stewart was filmed there in July 1953.\n\nThe Gardens also had a national reputation, unsurprisingly, as gardens. Colorful annual plants were grown in greenhouses on the property. The Elitch greenhouses were touted as the largest wholesale establishment in the west, eventually reaching 160,000 square feet or about 3.6 acres in extent.\n\nThe Elitch-Long Flower Store, located at Fifteenth and Stout in Denver, reputedly utilized the first floral delivery truck in Denver, circa 1910. A merger with the Park Floral Company formed the Park-Elitch Company wholesale florist. Mary was recognized as an ardent flower lover with a geranium named in her honor. The Elitch operation produced the “Hilda” variety of carnation, and shipped cut carnations as far away as Maine. In the 1950s they were shipping 700,000 cut carnations to the East Coast markets annually. They also courted prospective summer stock stars to appear at the Theatre by sending quantities of their prized carnations. Later, the famous Floral Clock was the much-photographed center of activities.\n\nMary became the proprietor of the Manhattan Beach Theater for 1900 and 1901. Manhattan Beach was also a pleasure resort for local families, located on the northwestern shore of Sloan’s Lake, just a mile south of Elitch’s and across Sheridan Boulevard from the Jefferson County town of Edgewater. It opened in 1891 and included many of the same attractions as Elitch’s, such as animal acts and hot-air balloons. The Manhattan Beach Theater was much larger that Elitch’s with a seating capacity of 3,000. The Theater and many other of the Manhattan Beach structures burned to the ground in a massive fire on December 27, 1908.\n\nBeginning in 1900, Elitch’s produced “stock star” shows, where visiting stars joined the resident stock company. Elitch’s mounted a new production about every week between Memorial Day and Labor Day. The star roster from this period included Henrietta Crosman, Minnie Maddern Fiske, Ida Conquest, May Buckley, David Warfield, Bruce McRae, and Edith Taliaferro.\n\nOne memorable production was Shakespeare’s As You Like It, starring Blanche Bates. For this play the rear (western) side of the theatre was removed so it could be played under the trees and stars, perhaps the first such implementation of natural stagecraft in the United States. Some of the other notable players of this time included:\n\nAntoinette Perry, a Denver native, who made her Elitch debut on June 12, 1904. She appeared in other Elitch productions over the years and is remembered today with the Tony Awards, named in her honor. She directed the original Broadway production of ‘Harvey,’ written by fellow Denverite Mary Chase.\n\nCecil B. DeMille was a minor player for the 1905 season. Here he met Maude Fealy, a local girl who became for a short time an international star and proclaimed the Most Beautiful Woman in the World in 1903. They remained friends for the rest of their lives, with DeMille often financially supporting Fealy. During Fealy’s prime years (1901 to 1905) she performed with English stage legends William Gillette and Sir Henry Irving.\n\nSarah Bernhardt performed in two productions on May 24, 1906, ‘Camille’ (matinee) and ‘La Sorcerie’ (evening), in addition to charming a lioness.\n\nAlso in 1906, local boy Douglas Fairbanks appeared on this stage, after having debuted on Broadway in 1902. Later in life Fairbanks recalled that he wanted so much to see a production at Elitch’s as a boy, that he scrubbed the stage in exchange for a ticket. Maude Fealy’s mother took credit as Fairbanks’s acting teacher in his youth. his son, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., appeared on this stage in August, 1973.\n\nIn November 1900 Mary married her business manager, Thomas Long, and the couple took an around-the-world honeymoon. This marriage was unsuccessful, and they separated within a few years. Thomas died in an automobile accident in 1920. Mary was only rarely referred to as Mrs. Long, instead preferring the Elitch name.\n\nOn September 30, 1915 the Elitch-Long Company filed for bankruptcy. The rise of inexpensive motion pictures, increased competition from nearby Lakeside (which opened in 1908), the meteoric rise of the automobile, and poor weather kept the crowds away.\n\nDenver philanthropist John K. Mullen purchased the property for $26,911 on April 16, 1916 through his son-in-law Oscar L. Malo, with the understanding that Mary would remain in her house and be financially secure for the remainder of her life. The grounds were also to retain the name Elitch’s. Two months later the Gardens were sold to John Mulvihill, under this stipulation. Mulvihill replaced Mary’s old frame cottage with a brick residence, where she lived until 1932 when she moved across the street and died on July 16, 1936.\n\nJohn Mulvihill came to Denver from Pennsylvania in 1902 as one of the thousands who flocked to the high, pure air of the Rockies as a cure for lung troubles. He found employment as a clerk at Denver Gas and Electric, a position he maintained for the first years of his ownership of Elitch’s Gardens as he learned the business.\n\nThe theatre was dark in 1916, 1918 and 1919 as Mulvihill considered his options and avoided the significant cost in mounting summer stock theater. It reopened for the 1920 summer season as a summer stock operation, with a resident cast taking on a new play each week. Mulvihill expanded the Children’s Day activities to include the Elitch School of the Theatre in 1926 and 1927. He was also responsible for extending the Gardens attractions to include free dance classes for children at the Trocadero, construction of the Skyrocket rollercoaster (later refurbished as the Wildcat), replacement of the Carousel, and construction of the Old Mill venue. The Old Mill burned on July 16, 1944, killing six patrons and becoming the most deadly fire in Denver in a generation.\n\nJohn Mulvihill was an old-fashioned man, who thought that theatre patrons would not pay to watch a man “make love” to his real life wife on stage. He therefore prohibited that married couples be hired for his theater. So, when Leading Man Fredric March and Leading Lady Florence Eldridge fell in love and eloped to Colorado Springs one Thursday, Mulvihill promptly fired Florence and hired a new leading lady for the rest of the season.\n\nHe was also a hawk in monitoring dancing at the Trocadero, and would separate couples he thought were dancing too close together. Mamie Doud Eisenhower was dancing with her uncle when a tap on the shoulder from Mulvihill alerted them to his presence.\n\nMulvihill ran Elitch’s until his sudden death in 1930, when his son-in-law, Arnold Gurtler, took over. Gurtler sons Jack and Budd later joined the operation. It is important to remember that with the exception of 1891 to 1894, Elitch’s was a family-owned and operated business, with deep ties to the Denver community.\n\nDuring the Great Depression summer stock theater grew at a phenomenal rate, from fifteen companies in 1930 to 105 companies in 1934. What became known as “the straw hat season” provided employment for actors and gave audiences a show at bargain prices as compared to Broadway ticket prices. The northeast and central Atlantic states had the majority of the summer stock companies, being close to New York City. Denver was very remote from the center of American theater, yet Elitch’s reputation was recognized by Time magazine, who called it “the great-grand-father of all U.S. summer stock companies.”\n\nIn 1934 a local actress, Miss Barton, auditioned for the summer stock company. This was a thinly-veiled attempt by Miss Helen Bonfils, Denver Post heiress and one of Denver’s wealthiest women, to fulfill her dream of being on stage by virtue of her own abilities. For thirteen years she was a character actress, specializing in world-wise, cynical, grande dames. She met the new Elitch director George Somnes in 1936, and they wed at the end of that summer.\n\nAs for the New York summer stock cast, they arrived a few weeks before opening night. The supporting members often lived with nearby families who rented out rooms while the Leading Man and Leading Lady had rooms at downtown hotels. A new play was mounted each week, requiring the cast to be performing in one play in the evening while rehearsing for the next play during the day. They had only Thursday daytimes off, the only day without a formal rehearsal. As for the backstage crew, they often went for two days without sleep, between Saturday night after the final curtain and Sunday night when the new production opened. They generally mounted 10 to 12 plays per season, with shows 7 days per week until 1960, when Sunday became a full day off.\n\nEdward G. Robinson, Jane Wyatt, and Patricia Neal are some of the well-known names from the summer stock years. Raymond Burr was the Leading Man in 1944. He returned to Denver in 1986 to film television movies of the Perry Mason series. He wanted to make the Elitch Theater a magnet school for the performing arts, a plan that eventually fell through.\n\nOne of the often told stories is that of Grace Kelly, who was the ingenue for the 1951 season. She was simply a member of the cast, living quietly in a nearby furnished room. On August 10 she received a telegram from film producer Stanley Kramer, asking her to report for a new film with Gary Cooper. The film, ‘High Noon.’ The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nAfter the end of the 1954 season major renovations were made. The old backstage was demolished, from the proscenium on back. In its place a massive, modern cinderblock stage house was built. The new dressing rooms features hot and cold running water and the stars’ dressing rooms were described as being especially luxurious. Three complete individual sets on rollers could be keep ready, and a 100-foot high fly house towered over the stage, reputedly the only stage in the country with such a structure. It was around the time of this renovation that the Old Stage Door, with the autographs of many luminaries of the stage, was obliterated by a painter. We do, have, however, autographs in the old dressing rooms from later years.\n\nIn 1957 Arnold Gurtler passed the Theatre management off to his sons, Budd and Jack, who alternated years as manager. They organized an unusually long season, with eleven productions over thirteen weeks. By this time traditional summer stock theater was in decline, and the Gurtlers were trying to keep their operation afloat."
