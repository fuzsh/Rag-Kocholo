        "text": "George Neale (1869-?) George Neale (often spelled “Neal”) was arrested along with Sidney Randolph on May 25, 1896, accused of being a co-cospirator of the attack on the Buxton family. In the early hours after the discovery of the Buxtons’ injuries, the Reverend L.L. Lloyd took it upon himself to investigate the surrounding area, and claimed that footprints from the Buxtons’ backyard led to George Neale’s back door. Neale was arrested by Deputy Sheriff Horton Thompson, and along with Randolph, was transported to the Central City jail in Baltimore later that evening and held imprisoned until the inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death on June 11, 1896.\n\nNeale was born on February 9, 1869 in Montgomery County and baptized in St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church at Cloppers, north of Gaithersburg. He is then found in 1870 living with his mother Kate (Mary Catherine) in the household of James B. Gaither and family near Brighton, where she worked as a domestic servant. Their neighbors included Ignatius Fulks, James Phebus, and Samuel Gloyd. In 1880, George and his mother, along with his younger sister Emma, were living with their grandmother Mary Neale in the Clarksburg District, which then included Gaithersburg. The family was still living in the Gaithersburg area by the mid-1880s where George was working as a waiter, possibly in the Summit Hotel, and had his first run-in with the authorities (see below). His sister Emma married John Johnson in 1894, and according to newspaper accounts (often garbled as to relationships) the couple was living with Emma’s grandmother Mary and also at least two of their younger nephews–John Young and James Johnson–at the time of George Neale’s second arrest in May of 1896. Emma and her family were also charged on May 25 as accessories to the crime, for allegedly aiding and abetting George Neale, and were jailed for several weeks in order to secure their testimony. Mary Neale was questioned several times, and a warrant was also issued for her arrest, but it was returned not served. These warrants were all issued by Justice Baughman “on information and oath” of Zadoc M. Easton.\n\nTen years previously, in May of 1886, Neale, along with a few dozen other Black men, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting 16-year-old Jennie Gloyd. He gave a statement that just before the attack on Gloyd, he had been at the train station in the company of a stranger to town (later identified as Charles Williams) who had been speaking lasciviously of young girls. When Neale was presented to Gloyd, she did not identify him as her attacker. Neale was kept in custody (or perhaps re-arrested) on a separate charge of disorderly conduct/vagrancy and subsequently sentenced to a year at the Maryland House of Corrections in Baltimore within a few days of the attack on Gloyd. Two months later, after Gloyd had been unable to identify her attacker from any number of proffered suspects, a group of men in Gaithersburg decided Neale was the likely culprit after all and brought Gloyd to the Baltimore institution where Neale was serving his sentence. She picked him out of a lineup of other Black men presented to her in their prison clothes (he would have been the only one familiar to her) and accused him of being her rapist.\n\nWhen his term at the House of Corrections was complete in May of 1887, Neale was returned to Montgomery County and immediately put on trial for the assault on Gloyd. Twenty-three people testified at his trial, but it was Gloyd’s testimony and identification that led to his conviction. He was sentenced by three justices (Vinson, Lynch, and Ritchie) to ten years in the Maryland Penitentiary– the maximum sentence. He was released in December of 1895, early for good behavior, and he returned to Gaithersburg. His prior conviction was used as motive when Neale was accused, along with Sidney Randolph, of attacking the Buxton family in May of 1896. The numerous rumors included: 1) Neale’s supposed “grudge” against Richard Buxton in particular, as some remembered Buxton had been instrumental in Neale’s conviction in 1887 (there is currently no evidence that Buxton was involved in that case, either as prosecutor or witness); 2) an inaccurate conjecture that Neale and Randolph had served together in the penitentiary and hatched the attack in advance (Randolph had never served time in the Maryland Penitentiary); 3) once the previous assumption had been disproved, a theory that Neale and Randolph had met for the first time in Gaithersburg a few days before the incident, and Neale convinced Randolph to assist him in his revenge (never proven beyond wild speculation).\n\nRichard Buxton himself was the one to ultimately exonerate Neale. Buxton and Neale did know of each other prior to the incident, and Buxton had insisted almost from the beginning that Neale was not the Black man who had attacked his family. In his testimony at the inquest into his daughter’s death, Buxton stated on the stand that Neale was not the man, and instead pointed the finger at Randolph. As a result, Neale (along with all of his relatives who had been imprisoned on suspicion of involvement) was released from custody in June of 1896. Neale was told to leave Gaithersburg immediately and never show his face again.\n\nIn a bizarre follow-up, the Baltimore Sun reported in October of 1896 that the Rev. Lloyd claimed to have seen George Neale walking on the street in Gaithersburg, dressed as a woman and wearing a heavy crepe veil. There is a George Neale appearing in the 1900 census in Ann Arundel County with members of the Nicholson/Butler family, married to Catherine Nicholson and with a 6-month-old son named Richard. That family cannot be located following the 1900 census, and cannot be verified as a match for George Neale of Montgomery County. Therefore, the exact fate of George Neale is not known.\n\nThe Neale-Johnson Family\n\nGeorge Neale’s sister was Emma Neale, who married John Johnson in Montgomery County in 1894. John and Emma–along with three of their young children, two younger relatives: John Young and James Johnson (both around age 11-12), as well as George Neale–were living in Gaithersburg in 1896 in a house with Mary Neale, the grandmother of George and Emma. With the exception of Mary, the entire family was arrested on May 25, 1896 on suspicion of being accessories before or after the fact, and potentially aiding and abetting George Neale’s supposed attack on the Buxton family.\n\nMary Neale (born c.1825, died after 1900) Born in Maryland and possibly enslaved by Lemuel Clements prior to emancipation, Mary (Cooper) Neale is first found in the 1870 census records in the Second District’s Gaithersburg area. That year, she was living with Augusta Neal (possibly a mis-transcription of her husband, Augustus/Gustavus Neal) and several members of the Cooper family: three of the same Coopers who are still residing with her in 1880, along with a George Cooper who may have become the husband of her daughter, Jane Neal Cooper (by 1880, Jane is widowed and George is not found). Also in the household with Mary that year was a daughter Catherine Neal, and two grandchildren (assumed to be Catherine’s children): Emma and George Neale. On May 25, 1896, there was a warrant issued for Mary’s arrest as an accessory to her grandson George Neale’s alleged attack on the Buxton family, but a few days later it was “returned not served.” Mary was interviewed by the press and by the detectives several times in the first few weeks of the investigation, often erroneously referred to as the mother or aunt of George Neale instead of his grandmother. After George Neale was cleared of charges and released in June of 1896, Mary and her family continued to live in Gaithersburg. In 1900, 78-year-old Mary is still living in the household with John and Emma (Neale) Johnson and their children (or possibly living next door), but she is absent from the 1910 census and is assumed to have died before then.\n\nJohn Johnson (1867-?) and Emma Neale Johnson (1873-?) Emma was George Neale’s sister, first found in the 1880 census at age seven, living with her grandmother Mary Neale and her older brother. She married John Johnson (son of Clement and Margaret Johnson) in 1894; the couple had at least five children, four of whom were still at home in the 1900 census, where John and Emma are still living with or next door to Mary Neale. John and Emma were both arrested, along with their younger relatives James Johnson and John Young, on May 25, 1896, on suspicion of aiding and abetting George Neale, accused of attacking the Buxton family. Emma had answered the door that morning to Isaiah Frazier, whom she said was inquiring about milk cans; her little brother James either misheard this exchange or knowingly reported false information that the man at the door might have been either George Neale or Sidney Randolph asking for a replacement for a bloody shirt. The exact charges brought against John Johnson are not known, though he was the only person to be arrested that day for being “an accessory before the fact,” suggesting he was suspected of having pre-knowledge of George Neale’s supposed intention to attack the Buxtons. The four Johnson family members remained in the county jail for almost three weeks, finally released along with George Neale at the conclusion of the inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death, for which the jury held only Sidney Randolph responsible. Though they were still living in Gaithersburg as of the 1900 census, no members of this family can be definitively located beyond that time.\n\nJames Henry Johnson (c.1885-1899) Often identified in the press as a “nephew” of John and Emma Johnson, James is thought to be the son of Henry Johnson (John’s brother) and Catherine Neale, who were married in 1883–the same Catherine Neale who was mother of George and Emma. This made James the nephew of John Johnson and the half-brother of Emma Johnson and George Neale. According to newspaper accounts, James told a story on May 25, 1896 that a man came to his family’s house early that morning asking for a replacement for a bloody shirt. He also claimed George Neale had not been in his bed early that morning, as he claimed to authorities. James was interviewed by deputy sheriff Thompson as well as the detectives from Washington, who dismissed his story as a misunderstanding– Emma Johnson, who had answered the door that morning to a man, said it was a neighbor asking for the return of some milk cans, and that James had misunderstood. James was arrested, along with the rest of the Johnson family, and held on suspicion of aiding and abetting George Neale.\n\nReverend Louis L. Lloyd (1851-1929) Louis L. Lloyd was born in Ireland to John L. Lloyd (1825-1895) and Helen (Stocksdale) Lloyd (1829-1896). The family emigrated to Towson, Maryland shortly after his birth. In 1860, Lloyd was living with his parents and two siblings in Carroll County, MD; in 1870 he was living alone at age 18 in District 4, Baltimore, working as a miller. He joined the Baltimore Methodist Conference in 1872 as a junior preacher– his mentor was Rev. John Landstreet, who had acted as the company chaplain for Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart during the Civil War. Lloyd married Rebecca Rhodes of Hyattstown on October 2, 1877. By the time of the 1880 census the couple were living in Amsterdam, VA with daughter Leona, assigned to a church in the Roanoke District. Then in 1885 he was appointed to Furnace Mission in the Rockingham District (VA), followed by an appointment to Milnes in the Moorefield District the next year. He held a post at the Calvary M.E. Church South in Baltimore until 1891; he was then assigned to a post at the Rockville Methodist Episcopal Church in Montgomery County, which he held for four years, 1891-1895. He was a frequent preacher at the Wesley Grove camp meeting in the early 1890s, as well as a speaker for prohibition rallies. He spoke at the Montgomery Lodge of Masons in 1893.\n\nFrom 1895-1899 Lloyd was the pastor of the Forest Oak Methodist church, known as the M.E. Church South, in Gaithersburg. He also ran a congregation and Sunday School in the Quince Orchard neighborhood during this time. He was heavily involved with the case involving the Buxton family in 1896, taking it upon himself to investigate clues and reach his own conclusions, in opposition to the efforts of the police detectives from Washington. He subsequently hosted in his home the detectives that arrived from Baltimore, and potentially influenced the direction of their investigation. He officiated at the funeral of Sadie Buxton and testified at both the inquest into her death and into Randolph’s. After Sidney Randolph was murdered by a lynch mob, Rev. Lloyd published a lengthy missive in multiple newspapers, deploring the lynching, but primarily issuing multiple statements establishing Randolph’s guilt, claiming he had “proof” for each that was never presented. Despite the fact that he had lived in Gaithersburg for less than a year when the incident occurred, he was highlighted by reporters as being a man greatly respected, who wielded significant influence in the town.\n\nBy 1900, he was living in Covington, VA with his wife and five children. He remained in Virginia the rest of his life, living with his wife and youngest daughter Elizabeth. He died in 1929 in Rockbridge Baths, buried in the Ebenezer Methodist Church Cemetery there.\n\nBelt was the owner of the largest mercantile store in Montgomery County, located on the corner of Diamond and Summit Avenues in the center of Gaithersburg. His building was also the site of the post office during the times when Belt served as postmaster: 1885-1890 and 1893-1897. The upper floor of the building was known as “Norman Hall” (named after his son) and served as a community gathering space, as the Town Hall, and a polling place for elections, as well as the home for the Waverly Literary Society, which stored its 1000-book library upstairs. The coroner’s inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death took place there in June, 1896.\n\nJohn Belt was featured often in the newspaper coverage of the Buxton/Randolph case– taking an active role in the “investigation” by the locals, frequently expressing his opinion that the suspects in custody (Randolph and Neale) were the perpetrators, serving on the jury of inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death and questioning most of the witnesses, making a public speech to the townspeople following the Buxton inquest saying they should “let the law take its course”, openly threatening Sidney Randolph in prison (accusing him of using a false name and being guilty of another crime out of state), and loudly arguing with reporters about their insinuations in the press that he himself was involved in the lynching. He was also named as the key spokesperson for the town in his assurances to State’s Attorney Kilgour, Sheriff Collier, and Judge Henderson that the Gaithersburg people would not take lynch action against Randolph.\n\nBelt’s original mercantile building burned to the ground in 1903. He replaced it with a two-story brick structure (which is still standing) on the same location; however, he never recovered financially from the loss, and sold the business to pay his creditors in 1904. He continued to live in Gaithersburg until his death in 1925, and is buried in the Hyattstown United Methodist Church Cemetery.\n\nHaler McAbee/Moccabee (c.1845-?) McAbee was the walking companion of Opera Warfield the morning of the attacks but claimed not to have seen the black man running across the tracks. He was arrested on May 25, along with the two main suspects and the Johnson family, for being an accessory after the fact. It is unclear from the legal records what the exact charges were, other than refusing to agree with Opera Warfield, who was never arrested. Some newspaper reports suggest he was suspected of helping Randolph dispose of bloody clothing after the latter’s supposed attack on the Buxtons. McAbee lived near to the Phebuses, Englishes, and Buxtons in Gaithersburg as of 1900. His birth date is not known concretely but probably dates between 1840 and 1850. He is first found in the 1870 census, living with another black family (the Sedgwicks) along with his young wife Sophia. Nearby lived an older McAbee couple, William and Harriett, who could possibly be the parents of Haler. His wife Sophia apparently died, and Haler married Matilda J. in 1875. He was living in the Clarksburg District (which then included Gaithersburg) with Matilda and five children in 1880; their youngest was Bessie, born three months earlier. After the events of 1896, McAbee continued living in Gaithersburg and working as a farm laborer. In the 1900 census, he was listed as married (in 1875) as opposed to widowed, but his wife is not in the household. Living with him are two adult children: Elmer (age 24) and Bessie (19), now married (in 1896) to Dorsey Frazier, a carriage driver. Also in the household are two younger McAbee children, Beatrice (10) and Maggie (6), as well as a child Hester (age 3) who was Bessie and Dorsey’s daughter. (The 1900 census record for this family was somewhat garbled as to relationships and names). The Fraziers (Dorsey, Bessie, and Hester) were living in D.C. by 1910 with several more children, and remained there through 1920. Haler (enumerated as “Haley”) was still living in Gaithersburg in 1910 with Maggie and Beatrice, the family completed by his wife Sylvia.\n\nAlexander G. Carlisle (1874-1924) Alexander Gassaway Carlisle was the son of David G. and Margaret “Mag” Carlisle of Gaithersburg, the second-youngest of their six children. He married Mary Williams “Willie” Coombs in 1895 and they had four children, though two of their daughters died in infancy. Their first child Mary Alma was born and died in August, 1896, one month after the murder of Sidney Randolph. Later in her life, Carlisle’s niece Minnie Coombs Farr implicated her uncle as a participant in the lynch mob that killed Randolph on July 4, 1896. His second daughter Minnie Farr was born in 1897 and his son John Franklin was born in 1900. Alexander Carlisle worked for many years as a liveryman in Gaithersburg, then operated an undertaker business on Diamond Street from 1906 until 1920, when he sold it to Ernest Gartner. He was an active member of the Democratic Party, serving several times as a representative to the State Central Commission, and he also belonged to the Forest Oak chapter of the Knights of Pythias. He served as deputy sheriff for the Gaithersburg district, under elected Sheriff Horton G. Thompson from 1897 to 1901. At some point, he and Willie divorced– she was listed as such in the 1920 census (which was taken shortly before her death). Before serving in World War I from 1917-1919, Carlisle listed his mother as next of kin on his WWI draft card instead of his wife, indicating they had split. After returning from the war, Carlisle sold his business in Gaithersburg and moved to Washington, D.C. where he was remarried to Isabel Riordan in June of 1923. He passed away “suddenly,” according to his obituary, only a year and a half later in November of 1924 and is buried in Forest Oak Cemetery in Gaithersburg.\n\nBenjamin F. Watkins (1844-1929) Born in Montgomery County, Watkins served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War. He married Sarah Jane Benson in 1868 and they eventually had nine children. Watkins was living on the outskirts of Gaithersburg near Washington Grove in 1896, when it was suspected that an axe stolen from his yard was the weapon used to attack the Buxton family. He and his wife both testified at the inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death. His name was often confused in the newspaper reporting– he was sometimes called Vernon (there was a Vernon Watkins who lived in the area: a younger man who taught school) or Bernie. He was also confused with his neighbor, William Gardner, who claimed to have seen a man fitting Randolph’s description hanging around the Watkins property the day before the attack on the Buxtons. The reporting in the Times on June 3, 1896 is the clearest, describing the owner of the axe as “Ben Watkins” and indicating his wife also saw the suspicious stranger near their house. This indicates Benjamin Watkins and his wife were the ones to testify at the inquest, not Mr. and Mrs. “Vernon” Watkins, as reported on the 12th (ironically by the same newspaper, the Times), especially considering that Vernon Watkins was not yet married in 1896. Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Watkins lived in Gaithersburg the rest of their lives, living in their later years with daughter Virgie (Watkins) Thompson and family. They died within two years of each other, in 1929 and 1931 respectively and are buried in Forest Oak Cemetery.\n\nThomas W. Stonestreet, (1832-1904) A lifetime Montgomery County resident, Thomas Stonestreet was the brother of Dr. Edward E. Stonestreet of Rockville. He married Anna Treadwell in 1856 and the couple eventually had twelve children, nine of whom lived to adulthood. In the 1880 census, Stonestreet was living in the Rockville District, near Hunting Hill and near his father, S.T. Stonestreet, with his wife Anna and ten children. He was always described as a farmer in the census records, but was involved in local politics as well, serving as an election judge and on the school board. Stonestreet was appointed Justice of the Peace for the 9th District and served several terms in that position between 1885 and 1894 (earning him the honorific of “Ex-Justice” often used in the papers). In 1896, he took an interest in the investigation of the Buxton case, expressing his opinion of Randolph’s guilt, attempting to insert himself into the narrative by claiming he had found a coat he thought to be the bloodied one Randolph had lost, and criticizing Sheriff Collier and State’s Attorney Kilgour for removing the suspects to Baltimore, away from a potential lynch mob (which he claimed was not an actual threat). He later served on the jury of inquest into Randolph’s murder. He is inexplicably missing entirely from the 1900 census, but his household (headed by wife Anna) was listed in the 9th District as usual, and his adult daughters Lena, Josephine, and Catherine were living with their mother. Stonestreet died in a Washington hospital in 1904 after a few-months-long illness.\n\nJames P. B. Veirs (1866-1956) Born the fifth child of farmer and landowner William Augustus Veirs and his wife Rebecca Biays Veirs, James P. Veirs lived his entire life in Montgomery County. His family had significant land holdings in the Rockville/Gaithersburg area, including the Veirs Mill that the current road is named for (spelled “Viers” due to an old mistake by the road commission in the proper spelling of the family name). According to his testimony at the inquest into Sidney Randolph’s lynching: on July 3, 1896, Veirs was headed to Frederick for the baseball games to be played the following morning when he heard a rumor that Randolph would be lynched. He claimed to have spotted deputy sheriff Horton Thompson in Gaithersburg, and asked him if the rumor was true. Thompson said, “I think not.” Veirs then said “You shouldn’t let them lynch that man,” to which Thompson made no reply. He was at the hotel breakfast table in Frederick the next morning, when the bet was almost struck between Somerville Bean and Harry Dawson on whether or not Randolph had been lynched in Rockville the night before.\n\nVeirs served as the postmaster for Rockville 1901-1902, but mostly maintained his dairy farm and profited from the purchase and selling of land as the city expanded. He was apparently married sometime after 1920, but is listed as divorced in subsequent censuses; he had no children. He continued to be civic-minded and politically active in his later years, founding the “Fusion Party” that took over from Democratic-led County Board of Commissioners in the 1930s. Veirs died in 1956, at the age of 90, and is buried in Rockville Cemetery.\n\nThe Snouffer Family\n\nPrior to the inquest into the lynching of Sidney Randolph, the papers reported a story told by an unnamed farmhand, who lived on the property of a “well-known farmer near Gaithersburg” who had several grown sons (potentially the Snouffer farm). He said he was at work early on Saturday morning– the morning Randolph was killed–and ​the sons came home just before dawn, their horses lathered up with exertion. Their father angrily asked where they had been, and they spoke to him in undertones, after which the father exploded in shouting and expletives which made it very clear what they had been doing. (The newspaper did not mention the family by name at this point.)\n\nIt is likely this witness was Clarence Ennis, who lived in Washington Grove and did testify at the inquest. He stated that he worked for the Snouffers, and while he was at work the Monday after Randolph’s death, Snouffer sons William and John approached him and accused him of telling the above story loudly so a crowd could overhear (probably including reporters). Ennis denied it; the Snouffers threatened him and said he would hang for it if he ever talked about it again. Ennis did not return to work. He added that he had also heard their sister Nannie ask them on Saturday morning (July 4) where they had been the night before, but they didn’t answer her.\n\nThe Snouffers were further implicated by the testimony of Francis Hall, who stated he met his girlfriend Jennie Neale that Friday night (July 3), when she was coming in on the last train at Washington Grove station. As they were walking back to Gaithersburg around 2:00 am, they came upon a wagon with two men sitting in it. Ennis identified one positively as John Snouffer, and thought the other was probably his brother William. Jennie Neale said the same, and said she thought the other, less-identifiable man was wearing a mask.\n\nEnnis and Hall were both Black men– the only Black people who testified at Sidney Randolph’s inquest. One of the papers reported a few days ahead of their testimony that two Black men had been terrorized by a group of white men: they were taken out to the woods, ropes were put around their necks, and they were interrogated about what they knew about the lynching Friday night, under threat of death. They claimed they knew nothing, and were eventually left alone, but horribly frightened. If these were the same two men, they gave testimony knowing their lives were in danger.\n\nFrancis Hall is not found in Montgomery County in the 1900 census. Clarence Ennis (1879-1944) was still living with his parents in the Gaithersburg area until 1910, and would only have been 17 years old in 1896. After 1910, he married Marie (or Mary Agnes) Eunis, and worked as a waiter in the hospital, then later moved to Washington, D.C. to work as a porter. Widowed by 1930, he married a second time to Victoria Bailey and lived in D.C. until his death in 1944.\n\nG. Fenton Snouffer (1838-1904), the father of the John and William Snouffer implicated in this testimony, was born in Frederick County in 1838 to a slave-owning family. He married his wife Mary in 1858. By 1860, he owned seven enslaved people, and still employed six Black servants on his farm and household in 1870. The Snouffer family did not relocate to Montgomery County until after 1880; they were living on a farm near Laytonsville in the 1900 census. Snouffer died in 1904 and is buried in Rockville Cemetery. His son John Snouffer (1868-1960) married Julia McKindless in 1899, had six children and lived until 1960– he was 92 years old when he died. The other son William Snouffer (1861-1901) married Anna C. Luke in 1896 and presumably moved out of his father’s household then. William died at age forty of heart disease, only five years after the Randolph lynching, in 1901. His gravestone reads the same as his father’s: “Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.”\n\nGovernor Lloyd Lowndes (1845-1905) Born in Clarksburg, Virginia (West Virginia today) on February 21, 1845, Lowndes graduated from Allegheny College in 1865, and subsequently earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1867. After establishing his legal career in Cumberland, Maryland, Lowndes became the owner of several successful businesses, one of which was the Cumberland Daily News. He first entered politics in 1873, serving as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, a position he held for two years. In 1895, Lowndes secured the Republican gubernatorial nomination, and then went on to win election to the Maryland governorship on November 5, 1895. He was sworn into office on January 8, 1896. During his tenure, a state geological survey was initiated; the “Eastern Shore Law” concerning congressional representation was annulled; a new charter for the city of Baltimore was instituted; a reform election law was sanctioned; and troops and provisions were organized for the Spanish American War. He took an interest in the lynchings of Sidney Randolph and Joseph Cocking, which occurred in Maryland within a week of each other in the summer of 1896. Publicly deploring the practice of lynching, the Governor offered a $1000 reward for information on members of either lynch party. His offer went unclaimed, as no one involved with either lynching was ever identified. After running unsuccessfully for reelection, Lowndes left office on January 10, 1900. He continued to stay active in his various business interests, as well as remaining active in his political role as the State’s Republican leader. Governor Lloyd Lowndes passed away on January 8, 1905, and was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Cumberland, Maryland.\n\nSheriff John W. Collier (1849-1908) John William Collier was born in Virginia, the oldest son of Richard H. and Mary F. Collier. According to the 1870 census, John William Collier was living with his parents in District 3, Montgomery County, at age 20; his father was working as a lock-keeper. He married Anna C. Padgett (1855-1900) in 1878 and they had ten children, seven of whom lived to adulthood. In 1880, Collier’s occupation was listed as “boating” in the Medley District (likely he was working on the canal as his father had done). He was elected Sheriff of Montgomery County in November of 1895; he appointed Charles Peyton as jailer the following month, and later appointed Horton G. Thompson as one of his deputies.\n\nFollowing the attack on the Buxton family in May of 1896, Sheriff Collier took Randolph and Neale into custody. That same day, Collier quickly anticipated the likelihood of a lynching attempt and removed the suspects via train to Central Station in Baltimore rather than leave them vulnerable to a lynching in Rockville. Though early on he seemed convinced of their guilt, as time progressed he seemed less inclined to believe Randolph and Neale were the culprits in the Buxton attack, though he questioned them frequently “under duress” that likely bordered on torture. After Randolph was returned to the jail in Rockville ahead of the Buxton murder inquest, Collier claimed he was removing the prisoner nightly to continue to thwart lynchers, until assurances from John Belt of Gaithersburg and Judge Henderson in Rockville convinced him Randolph would be safe. As he lived near Boyds, he was not present for the jailbreak on July 4 in Rockville, and claimed he had no warning of the planned lynching. The grand jury’s report in November of 1896 took special pains to acknowledge his exemplary performance of his duty, in part to protect him from similar retaliatory lawsuits that the Sheriff of Charles County suffered in the wake of the Cocking lynching there. The following year, Collier was elected a Clerk of the Court, while his former deputy Horton G. Thompson was elected Sheriff. By 1900, Collier was listed as a farmer living in the 11th district and was active there as a trustee of the schools. After the deaths of his wife Annie and daughter Ruth, he was re-elected for a second term as Sheriff, 1901-1903. He died in 1908 at his home near Dickerson, and is buried in Monocacy Cemetery.\n\nGeorge Minor Anderson (1857-1927) Born and raised in Rockville, G.M. Anderson was the youngest son of James W. Anderson, a former captain in the Confederate army. He attended Rockville Academy as a boy, then went on to St. John’s College in Annapolis and West Point Military Academy, finally earning his law degree from the National Law School in D.C. Before being admitted to the bar in 1892, he served as a deputy in the office of the clerk of the District Court and as county surveyor. In 1895, he was the Republican member of the Maryland House of Delegates, but turned down Democratic support for a bid at speaker of the house, against Republican caucus leader Ashley M. Gould. In 1896, Anderson was first involved in the Randolph case by serving as attorney at the inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death for the various members of George Neale’s family who had been held on suspicion of colluding with Neale in the attack on the Buxtons. He was later part of the search party alerted by Charles Peyton in the early morning of July 4, who followed the wagon tracks through town and eventually discovered Randolph’s body– the lynching was committed on farmland owned by Anderson’s family.\n\nLater in his career, Anderson served as Special Attorney to the Department of Justice (working on cases out west involving Native American tribal claims against the federal government), then in 1919 was appointed as Auditor of United States Court of Claims, while maintaining legal practice in Rockville. Late in his life, in 1902, he married Julia Prout Vinson, daughter of local Judge John T. Vinson: they had one son, Thomas Minor Anderson, who later became a well-known judge in the Montgomery County Circuit Court. G.M. Anderson was an active member of the Christ Episcopal Church in Rockville, and a member of the local Masons. He died of a stroke in 1927, at the age of 70, and is buried in Rockville Cemetery.\n\nJohn Mercer Langston (1829-1897) Langston was the son of Ralph Quarles, a white plantation owner, and Jane Langston, an enslaved woman of mixed race (Black/Native American). He grew up in Oberlin, Ohio following his parents’ death, and earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Oberlin College. Langston became the first black lawyer in Ohio, passing the Bar in 1854 after studying law as an apprentice. He became actively involved in the antislavery movement, organizing antislavery societies locally and at the state level. He helped runaway slaves to escape to the North along the Ohio part of the Underground Railroad.\n\nLangston married Caroline Wall, a senior in the literary department at Oberlin. They settled in Brownhelm, OH where he became the country’s first black elected official, serving as town clerk. He later served as a city councilman and on the Board of Education in Oberlin, where he practiced law starting in 1856. During the Civil War, Langston recruited African Americans to fight for the Union Army. As chief recruiter in the West, he assembled the Massachusetts 54th, the nation’s first black regiment, and the Massachusetts 55th and the 5th Ohio. After the war, he was appointed inspector general for the Freedmen’s Bureau, a federal organization that helped freed slaves. Selected by the Black National Convention to lead the National Equal Rights League in 1864, Langston carried out extensive suffrage campaigns in Ohio, Kansas and Missouri. Langston’s vision was realized in 1867, with Congressional approval of suffrage for black males.\n\nLangston moved to Washington, DC in 1868 to establish and serve as dean of Howard University’s law school — the first Black law school in the country. He was appointed acting president of the school in 1872. In 1877 Langston left to become U.S. minister to Haiti. He returned to Virginia in 1885 and was named president of Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (now Virginia State University). In 1888 he ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as an Independent. He lost to his Democratic opponent but contested the results of the election. After an 18-month fight, he won the election and served for six months. Langston was the first Black Congress member from Virginia.\n\nAfter he lost the bid for his re-election to Congress, Langston moved back to Washington, D.C. where he practiced law and worked on his autobiography, From the Virginia Plantation to the National Capital, published in 1894. Along with his young partner, Thomas L. Jones, he led indignation meetings against lynchings, following the 1896 Maryland lynchings of both Joseph Cocking and Sidney Randolph. Langston died on November 15, 1897 at his home in Washington.\n\nDr. J. Ford Thompson (1837-1917) Dr. Thompson was a well-known Washington surgeon, personal physician to several presidents and a longtime practitioner in several Washington Hospitals. His private practice was located at 804 17th St. In May of 1896, he was called to Gaithersburg to attend the Buxton family following their injuries; he later acted as primary physician for the family at Garfield Memorial Hospital, performing surgery on both Sadie and Maud Buxton to relieve symptoms from their head injuries.\n\nThompson was born in St. Mary’s County, Maryland March 20, 1837 and was educated in public and private schools in St. Mary’s County and at the Rittenhouse Academy in Washington. He began his practice in Washington in partnership with Dr. M.V.B. Bogan after graduating Doctor of Medicine from the University of Stockholm. He married Marion Virginia Reeves in 1860; the couple would have six children, three of whom lived to adulthood. During the Civil War Thompson served in military hospitals in the city and in the field. He was Professor of Anatomy at Columbian Medical College (later George Washington University) and afterward served for more than twenty years as Professor of Surgery at that college. He was a member of the American Medical Association, the American Surgeon Association, and President of the Medical Association of the District of Columbia from 1881-1882. Dr. Thompson served as surgeon to Providence, Columbia Hospital for Women, Emergency, Children’s, George Washington University and Garfield Memorial Hospitals. Dr. Thompson was one of the first physicians to realize the value of specialization in medical practice and early in his career gave up all his practice except that of surgery.\n\nAbout ten years before his death he underwent a serious operation for stomach trouble in London from which he never fully recovered. He returned to the States shortly after and retired from active practice, dying in 1917 just shy of his 80th birthday. In a bizarre footnote, in 1920, Thompson’s son–Joseph Ford Thompson, Jr., a 52-year old artist–killed a 16-year-old girl and himself in an apparent case of murder-suicide.\n\nElizabeth Jane “Jennie” Gloyd (1870-1947) In 1886 at the age 16, Jennie Gloyd accused George Neale of raping her, an accusation that led to his 1897 conviction and commitment to the Maryland State Penitentiary to serve a ten year sentence (he was released early, in December of 1895, for good behavior). George Neale’s conviction played a role in establishing a motive for him to attack the Buxton family in 1896, leading to his arrest and alleged connection to the other suspect, Sidney Randolph.\n\nGloyd was the daughter of William Thomas Gloyd and Elizabeth Susan Claggett. Her mother was married three times: first to Thomas Peddichord in 1861, with whom she had three children, then to William Gloyd in 1869, with whom she had four children including Jennie, then to James Lawson in 1883, with whom she had two more children. After Jennie Gloyd accused George Neale of assaulting her in 1886, she remained in Gaithersburg, listed in the 1900 census (age 29) still living with her mother, stepfather James Lawson, and three adult siblings. James Lawson was listed among those who testified at the inquest into Sadie Buxton’s death in 1896, claiming to have seen Randolph around the water pump in town several days before the attack and thinking he resembled Clem Johnson. Jennie Gloyd is noted in the family records as being mentally incompetent–it is unclear if her mental affliction predated her trauma or if it was caused by the assault. She was living with her mother in the 1910 census, enumerated as “Jennie Lawson.” After the death of her mother in 1917, Jennie lived with her half-brother Zachariah Lawson and his family, according to the 1920 census; her full brother William Dice Gloyd also lived in the household. By 1930 she had been committed to St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., an institution for the mentally ill, where she presumably lived the rest of her life. Jennie and her mother are buried together in Forest Oak Cemetery."
