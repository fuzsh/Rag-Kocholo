        "text": "International Caps and Historical Facts!\n\nIn Britain 'caps' are awarded to players making international appearances for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It is a tradition dating back to the origins of the Football League in the Victorian age, when during games players routinely wore caps denoting club colours. The concept of each team wearing a set of matching shirts had not been universally adopted.\n\nWhen the first international match took place in 1872 players wore caps, as was the norm. When outfield players ceased to wear caps some years later, representing one's country at football continued to be marked by the symbolic presentation of a cap.\n\nThe first caps were awarded to the players who participated in the Scotland v England international on 31st March 1886 in Glasgow.\n\nPeter Shilton is the most capped England player of all time. The goalkeeper holds the record after playing 125 games for his country, including fifteen as captain. His last appearance was at the 1990 World Cup finals in Italy.\n\nSix England players are centurions with 100 caps or more. As well as Shilton they are Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Billy Wright, David Beckham and most recently Steven Gerrard (right).\n\nOf Billy Wright's 105 appearances for England, he captained the side on 91 occasions.\n\nAhmed Hassan (born 2 May 1975 in Maghagha, Egypt) is the most capped international male footballer in history with 184 appearances for Egypt.\n\nOn 30th May 2006, Theo Walcott became the youngest player to make his England debut, when he came on as a substitute against Hungary at the age of 17 years and 75 days.\n\nThe youngest player to be awarded a cap for Wales is Gareth Bale, (then of Southampton), who on 27th May 2006, aged 16 years and 315 days appeared as a substitute against Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nThe youngest British player ever to be awarded a full cap is Norman Whiteside who was 17 years and 41 days old when he made his debut for Northern Ireland against Yugoslavia on 17th June 1982 at the World Cup finals. He still holds the record as the youngest player to take part in a World Cup final tournament.\n\nThe oldest player to participate in a World Cup finals tournament was Cameroon's Roger Milla, who was 42 years and 39 days at the 1994 finals held in the USA. Cameroon were knocked out in the group stages, however Milla (right) scored a goal against Russia, setting a record as the oldest goalscorer in a World Cup finals match.\n\nThe oldest player to receive his first England cap is Alexander Morten, a goalkeeper with Crystal Palace, who was 41 years and 113 days old when he kept goal against Scotland on 6th March 1873.\n\nThe oldest player to have been capped by England is Sir Stanley Matthews, who was 42 years and 103 days old when he played against Denmark on 15th May 1957.\n\nJack Cock (Huddersfield Town) was the first Cornishman to be capped for England in 1920. Cock went on to become a popular variety star and also appeared in a number of British films.\n\nThe first Fourth Division player to win an international cap was Vic Rouse (Crystal Palace) for Wales against N.Ireland in 1959.\n\nJohnny Byrne (right) won his first cap for England in 1962, while paying for Crystal Palace in the Third Division. Tommy Lawton (Notts County), Reg Matthews (Coventry), Peter Taylor (Crystal Palace) and Steve Bull (Wolves) also gained England caps while playing their football in the Third Division.\n\nCecil Moore (Sheffield Utd) was capped for Norther Ireland in 1949, emigrated to America, and appeared for the USA against England in 1953.\n\nJohnny Carey (Manchester United, 1938-53) won 29 caps for the Republic of Ireland and seven for Northern Ireland.\n\nKevin Keegan was awarded his first England cap against Wales on 15th November 1972. His second cap was also against Wales (24th January 1973), as was his third (11th May 1974). He remains the only player to have played his first three games for England against the same opposition.\n\nGary Howlett (Brighton) travelled to the other side of the world to earn his first international cap and played for only 19 minutes. On the 3rd June 1984, Howlett was named as a substitute for the Republic of Ireland against China which was taking place in Sapporo, Japan,. Nineteen minutes from time he came on, but was never chosen to play for the Republic again.\n\nJames Milner (right) with 46 appearances and nine goals is the most capped England Under-21 International of all-time.\n\nThe only player to win both semi-professional and full caps for England is Steve Guppy. Guppy was chosen for the England semi-professional team while playing for Wycombe Wanderers in the Conference in 1989/90 and in 1999, when at Leicester City, he won his first and only cap for England against Belguim at the Stadium of Light.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWilfried Zaha - 'The Boy Wonder'\n\nDazet Wilfried Armel Zaha, better known as Wilf Zaha is currently the hottest young star in British football. As a Crystal Palace supporter I am running out of superlatives to describe England's most recently capped international player.\n\nToday the Crystal Palace forward/winger won the ‘Football League Young Player of the Month’ award for October. Zaha scored his first two goals of the season against Wolves on the 2nd October 2012. He then scored a further two goals in his next game, four days later, in a 4–3 win over Burnley. Palace remained unbeaten in October and this included a victory at then table-toppers Leicester who had won all five of their home games before Palace spoiled the party, winning 2-1 at The Walkers Stadium. Palace are in fact unbeaten in the league since 25th August. Zaha’s form has been a major factor in the Club’s successful start to the season, and many opposition managers have complemented the recently turned 20 year-old on some magical displays.\n\nCrystal Palace boss Ian Holloway presents Wilf Zaha with his award.\n\nHis pace, footwork, balance and tricks are breathtaking, but this season he has stepped up his game to another level. His ability to beat players has never been in doubt and he regularly leaves opposition full-backs on their back sides. But this season he has worked on his all-round game and as a result his fitness, work rate, defensive duties, and his ability to pick a pass or take on a player have improved ten-fold. Added to the fact that he is scoring goals as well - this all contributes to making him one of the most exciting player to watch in British football. The way Palace are set-up to play this season, using two wingers to attack at pace, often drawing defenders out of position and creating time and space for team-mates has made Crystal Palace an exciting team to watch this season, something the Selhurst Park faithful have not witnessed for many years!\n\nZaha and team-mate Yannick Bolasie are the protagonists in this football feast with all the trimmings now being served up at ‘The Palace.’ Their direct attacking style of play is electric and although outstanding in their own individual ways, it is as a partnership that they seem to have flourished, often swapping wings in a game or both attacking down the same flank, causing chaos as the opposition are left chasing shadows or hauling them to the ground in a foolhardy attempt to stop them!\n\nWilf’s form during the October also contributed to him becoming the first Championship outfield player to be called up by England since Jay Bothroyd in 2010.\n\nSpeaking ten days ago BBC Sport pundit Mark Bright, who played for Palace and now helps out as a coach at the club said of Wilfried Zaha: \"He is the biggest talent to emerge from Crystal Palace since Arsenal legend Ian Wright. In my opinion, Wilfried is the most exciting player outside the Premier League,\" Bright went on: \"He played in the League Cup last season at Manchester United. Palace won with a Darren Ambrose screamer and Wilfried gave Rafael such a torrid time that they took him off.\"\n\nLeon Osman, who made his England debut in the same match as Wilf against Sweden this month said of Zaha: \"We have all been hearing about him for a year or so now. He came and trained on Monday morning and looked the real deal. He was direct, skilful and committing people.\"\n\nHis rise has not been an overnight one, but a gradual nurturing of a player with undoubted talent. However many players show talent at an early age but their careers often stagnate or go backwards. Some players are greedy, some are badly advised and as a result they leave at the wrong time or join the wrong club, but Wilf is an classic example of how to nurture talent correctly.\n\nZaha was born in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and moved to South London with his family aged four, but has been at Crystal Palace FC since the age of 12.\n\nZaha was given his professional debut aged 17, making a substitute appearance at home to Cardiff City on 27th March 2010 by then caretaker manager Paul Hart.\n\nTwo years later, in March 2012, Zaha was voted 'The Football League's Young Player of the Year.'\n\nWilf follows in a long line of young players to roll off the CPFC academy production line. There are currently four players plying their trade in the Premier League who graduated through the Palace academy. No doubt Zaha wants to join the likes of Victor Moses at Chelsea, Ben Watson at Wigan, Nathaniel Clyne at Southampton and Wayne Routledge at Swansea in the top flight, but it is more a question of when rather than if, and with whom?\n\nThe vultures are circling, but Palace are currently top of the Championship and they find themselves in with a real opportunity of securing top flight football next season. Taking into account the odd dip in form most teams suffer at some stage of a season, along with a bit of luck such as keeping the squad fit and injury free, Palace are in a great position to dictate the future of their ‘wing wizard.’ Keeping hold of Zaha in January is the first step in maintaining a steady platform in the Club’s effort to reach English football’s top tier for the first time since the 2004/05 season.\n\nEPL football would generate the club over £60m, even if they came straight back down, and the sale of Zaha in the region of £15-20m. But Palace, even with £15m burning a hole in their pocket could not buy a replacement for Zaha, as there is no player more gifted in the country to play his role in the team. Take £15m+ in January and risk missing out on a £60m+ windfall, or keep Wilf untill the summer thus improving the chance of that windfall becoming a reality and then sell the ‘boy wonder,’ assuming he chooses to leave.......is simply a no brainer!\n\nEven if Palace do not make it to the Premier League, nobody at the Club or any Palace fan would begrudge the youngster the opportunity to grace the stage of Europe’s top domestic league. But Wilf is a local lad who has even admitted he misses ‘home’ when on international duty. His home being the structure in place at Palace to advise him, educate him, coach him and help him keep his feet firmly on the ground. By doing this Wilf can focus on achieving his personal and professional goals under the watchful guidance of the owners, management and his team-mates, who all play their part in contributing to his love affair with ‘The Eagles.’\n\nPlayers of the calibre of Wilfried Zaha don’t come around very often, and it is important that the Club use him as a stepping stone to a brighter future and Wilf does likewise. It is imperative that Wilf continues to learn his trade while at Palace, so that when he does fly ‘The Eagle’s Nest’ he is ready both mentally and physically for what lies ahead.\n\nWe are witnessing the development of a player that may one day reach the heights of........well let’s just wait and see, and enjoy the moment!\n\nWilfried Zaha, remember the name!\n\n↧\n\nBabe Of The Month - Merry Christmas/Fröhe Weihnachten/Joyeux Noël/Feliz Navidad/Buon Natale/Feliz Natal/Wesołych Świąt Bożego Narodzenia\n\nKate dressed in a sexy festive Christmas outfit ....and wearing a South London and Proud t-shirt\n\nKate Fletcher has literally flown the nest!\n\nOriginally Kate was a cheerleader for 'The Gully Girls' the cheerleading team of Brighton and Hove Albion Football Club. However a month ago she defected to join 'The Crystals,' the cheerleaders of bitter rivals Crystal Palace Football Club.\n\nAnd in a ironic twist of fate the singer/songwriter/actress and dancer joins her sister Kim, already a member of 'The Crystals' in her first performance of the season today (Saturday 1st December), in front of the Albion fans she used to wow, as Crystal Palace take on Brighton at Selhurst Park.\n\nIt echoes former Albion player Glenn Murray who made the trip up the A23 last year to join Palace, and then scored on his return a few months later, as 'The Eagles' became the first team to beat 'The Seagulls' at home in the league since they moved to their new £100m stadium in Falmer.\n\nThe 20 year-old's switch has propelled her into the spotlight much like a new star signing might expect! The move has created much discussion on Club messageboards and she has been interviewed by local newspapers in both Croydon and Sussex, who have been following the story in some detail.\n\n'The Crystals' have added some much-needed vibrancy, glamour and pizazz to the Selhurst Park match day experience since they made their debut in December 2010. They help promote the Club through their media work, and last July they created their own dance routine to Canadian singer Carly Rae Jepsen's monster hit 'Call Me Maybe.' Their second video released in October sees the cheerleaders dancing to PSY’s number one hit 'Gangnam Style' in and around Crystal Palace’s stadium, and are joined in some scenes by the club’s mascot. Both videos proved to be smash hits on YouTube and made 'The Crystals' overnight internet sensations .\n\nIt will be no surprise if I tell you that the girls have shot a Christmas video, a cover of Marie Carey's 'All I Want for Christmas Is You,' which you can watch exclusively here!\n\nFind out more about the 'The Crystals' on Facebook and Twitter\n\n* For Information/bookings contact Sharon.Lacey@cpfc.co.uk.\n\n↧\n\nThe History of the Football Magazine - The Early Years!\n\nPrior to the saturation coverage of football by television and radio and the growth of the internet, other than results and match reports in newspapers, football magazines and annuals were the prime source of information for supporters. Many have long since disappeared, but a few still continue to enjoy success.\n\nHere is a look back at the birth of the football magazine and those magazines that are still in existence!\n\nThe first black and white printed football specific newspaper in Britain was \"Football\" which ran from 4 October 18 until 11 April 1883.\n\nFrom the late 1890's football clubs started producing their own programmes and newspapers started to produce football based editions.\n\nEarly Club specific publications included:\n\n\"The Official Programme: The Official Organ of Manchester City, Newton Heath, Broughton Rangers and Salford Club\" from 3 September 1898 until 28 April 1900\n\n\"The Official Programme: The Only Official Organ of the Everton, L'pool, New B'ton, R'k Ferry and Tranmere Clubs\" from 1 September 1898 until 29 April 1899\n\nIn the 20th Century we saw the arrival of the \"Football Chronicle\" which ran from 16 September 1911 to 25 April 1914 and continued after the war from 30 August 1919 to 19 December 1936.\n\n\"The Football Favourite\" ran from 4 September 1920 to 30 April 1921, and continued as \"The Football and Sports Favourite\" (right) between 7 May 1921 and 30 March 1929.\n\nIn the 1930's the \"Football Weekly\" marketed as 'the great paper for the great game -every Wednesday 2d' was probably the best seller.\n\nThe question to address is what is the difference between newspaper and a magazine?\n\nEast Germany produced the earliest periodical that resembled a football magazine, \"Die Fussball-Woche\" (pictured right) meaning \"Football Week\" which was first published on 24 September 1923 in dessen Verlag. This is the earliest publication that resembles what we would now recognise as a magazine format.\n\nAll these pre-war periodicals were still missing the crucial element of colour photography.\n\nThe \"FA Bulletin\" the \"Voice of the Football Association\" commenced on the 20 September 1946 and would run monthly for the period of the football season. It changed to the \"FA News\" in August 1951 until 1956. It changed again to \"FA Today\" and finally ceased production in October 1979. It is hard to call this a generally available magazine, as it was sold on a subscription only basis.\n\nIf you want to add to the definition of a magazine in terms of using better quality paper and colour then the first football magazine in the UK was \"Charles Buchan's Football Monthly.\"\n\nThis iconic magazine (pictured right) was launched in September 1951 and the world had its first modern style football magazine. It featured on its first cover, Blackpool's Sir Stanley Matthews. In its first year of existence the magazine sold 60,000 copies per month, peaking at around 150,000 in 1961-62.\n\nThe first original colour photographs appeared in the November 1957 edition. For many readers the pictures of players in CBFM were the only way supporters could see what an opposition player looked like, unless you had seen them appear at your own home ground.\n\nA popular feature of CBFM was that unlike newspapers it carried news of every player transfer under the heading 'Transfer Market Moves.' Due to a lengthy 'lead time' in those days - the time between submission of a copy and actual publication some of the information provided could be anything up to three months old! However, this information detailed transfers of players between lower division and non-league clubs, for many readers it was 'news.' Such information was not available from any other source.\n\nOther 'in vogue' CBFM features included: interviews with players, readers' letters and 'swap your programmes.' A page was also devoted to a feature on an amateur club, invariably a London-based or Home Counties club as the writer of this piece Norman Ackland was himself London-based, and was working on very limited expenses.\n\nIn the days before Sunday football became an established and integral part of many people's weekends, CBFM also had a feature called 'Fixtures Wanted' which was a double-page spread of small ads from teams all over the country asking for friendly games within a certain radius. Many of these teams boasted elaborate names such as Internazionale Celtic or Real Bexhill.\n\nIn the 1970's, as coverage of football on television increased and newspapers devoted more column inches to our National game, circulation of CBFM decreased rapidly until it folded in January 1974.\n\nCharles Buchan's Football Monthly (CBFM) was without doubt the most recognised name of its genre. However it was not the only football magazine available during its 23 year tenure.\n\n\"Raich Carter's Soccer Star\" (right) was launched a year after CBFM, on the 20th September 1952. Unlike CBFM, Raich Carter's Soccer Star was a weekly publication. Its unique selling point was that it featured different team photographs every week, on the front and back cover. Though the cover was glossy, the pages inside were matt and did not carry colour photographs until the late 1960's.\n\nThe Raich Carter logo was dropped in the summer of 1955 and the the name was shortened to \"Soccer Star.\"\n\nA regular contributor to Soccer Star was the football writer and historian Jack Rollin, who later launched and edited \"The Rothmans Football Yearbook.\"\n\nEvery week Soccer Star carried results, teams and attendances for every game in England and Scotland. Despite the fact that this information was two or three weeks old, it still suggested immediacy as at the time no other newspaper or magazine conveyed such detailed statistics.\n\nSoccer Star had a policy of heavily featuring lower division and non-league football in its publication, something that is almost alien to modern day newspapers and\n\nmagazines, that tend to focus primarily on top-flight football. Refreshing as this was, it also contributed in part to its downfall, when the requirement of the majority of readers was exactly that - top-flight and international football!\n\nLike CBFM, Soccer Star suffered from poor sales in the late 1960's and as a result it merged into \"World Soccer\" magazine on 19 June 1970.\n\n\"World Soccer\" (pictured right) was the world's second oldest monthly football magazine when it started in October 1960 and is today the worlds longest running football magazine as it is still being published by IPC, with a monthly circulation today of around 52,000.\n\nNext week I will continue with this article as I write features on some other football magazines from varying generations, that you may also recognise including: \"Shoot,\" \"Match,\" \"Soccer Review,\" \"FourFourTwo,\" and \"When Saturday Comes.\"\n\n↧\n\nThe History of the Football Magazine - The Later Years!\n\nIn my last article 'The Early Years of the Football Magazine,' I outlined the birth of the football magazine from its inception up to the 1960's, where we saw the rise of publications such as \"The Football Favourite,\" \"Football Weekly,\"\"FA Bulletin,\"\"Voice of the Football Association,\" \"Charles Buchan's Football Monthly\" and \"Soccer Star.\"\n\nThis week I am going to be concentrating on 'The Later Years of the Football Magazine,' from the mid 1960's to the present day.\n\nWe left 'The Early Years' following the merger of the \"Soccer Star\" magazine into \"World Soccer\" in the late 1960's.\n\n\"World Soccer\" (right) remains the periodical authority on world football. It is part of the IPC media group, and a member of an umbrella group of similar titles published in other countries, such as 'Kicker' (Germany), 'A Bola' (Spain), and 'La Gazzetta dello Sport' (Italy).\n\n\"World Soccer\" has always featured authoritative articles on the world football scene by writers such as Brian Glanville and John Ballard.\n\n\"World Soccer\" is still going strong today and is in fact the worlds longest running football magazine, with a monthly circulation of around 52,000.\n\nOne of the next British magazines to show it's face was the \"Soccer Review\", ultimately to become the Football League Review (The Official Journal of the Football League) which started in August 1965. If you went to football matches from the late sixties and through to the mid seventies you will remember the insert from the Football League that came inside your clubs match day programme. However it did not appear in every football clubs programme. It was printed by Sport and Screen Productions in Leicester and was edited by Harry Brown. It qualifies as a magazine in its own right as it was always available either by post or from your newsagent right from launch. The Football League Review went through various name changes from \"Soccer Review,\" to the \"Football League Review,\" and finally the \"League Football.\"\n\nIn 1967 we saw the launch of \"Jimmy Hill's Football Weekly,\" (right) the first weekly football magazine in the world, if you consider the term 'magazine' as to incorporate a full colour glossy photographic front cover, even if the inside was black and white. Other weekly newspapers such as \"Soccer Star\" had been running before this time, but only with spot colour on the front page.\n\nThe JHFW magazine folded in 1970 when a large publishing group bought it as part of a portfolio - they went in for glossy, expensive publications but they soon decided that JHFW didn't fit their image and so it was ditched.\n\nA former member of staff, Carol Davis, who worked on the JHFW magazine said \"We never heard sight nor sound of Jimmy Hill during all the time I worked there - he simply lent his name to the mag and had no involvement; just another business venture for him I suppose.\" In 1968 Jimmy Hill became Head of Sport at London Weekend Television and rose to Deputy Controller of Programmes, before joining the BBC as presenter of \"Match of the Day.\"\n\n\"Goal\" magazine (right) joined the competition and was launched on 16 August 1968 with a \"bash\" at the Savoy, featuring Goal Girls and the assembled media, with Bobby Charlton signed up to do a weekly diary. It went on to became a successful magazine in the early 1970’s.\n\nBy 1971 \"Goal\" had weekly sales of 220,000, which gradually declined from that high point before the International Publishing Corporation (IPC) decided to incorporate it into IPC stablemate \"Shoot!\" magazine on 15 June 1974.\n\n\"Shoot!\" magazines circulation had hit a high of 120,000 copies per week in 1996. It changed to a monthly magazine in 2001, selling in excess of 33,000 copies a month. It was relaunched as a weekly magazine in late February 2008 before publishers IPC sold off the brand in August 2008, a year short of it's 40th birthday.\n\n\"Shoot!\" (right) was noted throughout the 1970's and 1980's for the quality of its news stories and articles on all aspects of football in England and Scotland. The magazine was also known for its 'Star Writer' features. Each season a selection of big-name First Division players were signed up to write columns, including Kevin Keegan, Bryan Robson and Charlie Nicholas. The magazine also featured the very popular Paul Trevillion's 'You Are The Ref' piece, which has since been afforded cult status and now appears in 'The Observer' newspaper sports supplement.\n\nIn 1974 \"Charles Buchan's Football Monthly\" closed and became \"Football\" and was maintained by IPC until 1995 when it was sold to Ken Bates at Chelsea.\n\n\"Match\" magazine was launched on 6 September 1979, at a cover price of 25p. The original editor was Mel Bagnall. Kevin Keegan was the first cover star of \"Match\" and supported the magazine with his column, 'Learn To Play The Keegan Way.' The first issue came with an 80-page sticker album and included columns by Tottenham star Ossie Ardiles, Manchester United's Steve Coppell and Nottingham Forest manager, Brian Clough.\n\nOn its launch in 1979, the magazine initially failed to catch the dominant circulation of its main weekly football rival, \"Shoot!\" In the mid 1990's the magazine was successfully revitalized and relaunched by Chris Hunt. Under his editorship \"Match\" was transformed, finally overtaking \"Shoot\" to become the biggest selling football title in Britain, with its weekly sales peaking at 242,000 during this period. \"Match\" continues to this date, but is more a comic than a magazine for grown ups.\n\nNo one really provided \"World Soccer\" with any monthly competition from 1974 until the launch of \"When Saturday Comes\" (WSC) in 1986. This magazine (right) started life as a 12-page photocopied fanzine in March 1986 on sale for 20p, and is still running today with a circulation of 21,000 at a price of £2.95.\n\nThere was an explosion of football fanzines in the mid 1980's. In January 1988 there were 22 fanzines in the \"WSC\" listing of like titles. A year later it was 121 and in January 1992 there were over 600. Many titles did not reach the list, but in 1995 it was estimated that in excess of 2,150 titles were available but only \"WSC\" survived as a mainstream football magazine.\n\n\"When Saturday Comes\" aims to provide a voice for intelligent football supporters, offering both a serious and humorous view of the sport, covering all the topics that fans are likely to talk about, whether serious or trivial.\n\nIn the early-1990s the magazine began to take on advertising, and increased to 48 pages. WSC is still edited by Andy Lyons, who originally founded the magazine along with Mike Ticher.\n\n\"The Footballer\" started in July 1989 and was sub titled the \"Journal of Soccer History and Statistics\". There were 36 editions of the magazine produced before it disappeared in June 1996.\n\n\"90 minutes\" (right) arrived in October 1990 and stopped again on the 17 May 1997. It was started by Crystal Palace fan Dan Goldstein and remained independent until IPC took it over. It was launched at £1 an issue but was reduced to 65p quite quickly.\n\n359 issues later when \"90 minutes\" ceased the editor in chief was Paul Hawksbee, now a presenter on TalkSPORT radio.\n\nDan Goldstein went on to write the \"Rough Guide to Football\" in 2000, which could be described as the only football book of its kind, in that it goes beyond the usual back page material to uncover the most amazing stories and unlikeliest personalities on planet football!\n\n\"Goalmouth\" This monthly national football magazine was launched in May 1992 and lasted just one season. It was published by EPG Publishing and was edited by John Jackson. The price was £1.50 on launch and quickly went up to £1.75. This was reflected in the high quality paper used and the photographic reproduction work. It was a superior publication and it is a shame it failed after the one season.\n\n\"Four Four Two\" magazine (right) was launched in September 1994 and targets an adult sports audience. It has now become the biggest-selling football magazine in the UK, with monthly sales figures in excess of 100,000. The magazine features a mixture of authoritative and serious-minded articles together with irreverent humour and nostalgia pieces. Another reason for its success is its ability to connect to the needs and feelings of the typical football fan.\n\nPopular features include: 'Magic Moment,' 'Upfront,' 'They Said What?' 'Insider,' and 'My Perfect XI.'\n\n\"Four Four Two\" is published by 'The Haymarket Media Group' and it launched its 200th edition back in February 2011.\n\nThe magazine has had an array of high-profile people amongst its regular contributors. The likes of James Richardson, who presented TV's Football Italia, Jonathan Wilson, football journalist and author of Inverting the Pyramid: A History of Football Tactics and Michel Salgado, footballer formerly of Real Madrid and currently playing for Blackburn Rovers are all currently involved. Previous contributors include: Henry Winter, Bobby Robson, Arsène Wenger, David Platt, the late Brian Clough and Robbie Savage.\n\nFor the grown up magazine readers we have still the big three: \"World Soccer\", \"When Saturday Comes\" and \"Four Four Two\" still slogging it out for world domination!\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nFestive Footballer's Names -

South Africa and Zambia both qualify automatically as hosts and holders respectively. The opening match will be played in Johannesburg on the 19th January between South Africa and Cape Verde, with the Islanders making their finals debut. The winner of the ACON tournament will automatically qualify for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil as the representative from CAF and will line up in group B alongside Spain, Uruguay and Tahiti.\n\nOn 29 January 2011, Libya won the right to host the 2013 tournament and Morocco won the bid to host the 2015 edition. However due to the 2011 Libyan civil war, Libya and South Africa traded years with South Africa hosting in 2013 and Libya hosting in 2017.\n\nThe Africa Cup of Nations, also referred to as the African Cup of Nations or African Nations Cup, officially CAN (French for Coupe d'Afrique des Nations), is the main international association football competition in Africa. It is sanctioned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and was first held in 1957. Since 1968, it has been held every two years.\n\nIn 1957 there were only three participating nations: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. South Africa were originally scheduled to compete, but were disqualified due to the apartheid policies of the government then in power. Since then, the tournament has grown greatly, making it necessary to hold a qualifying tournament.\n\nEgypt is the most successful nation in the cup's history, winning the tournament a record seven times (including when Egypt was known as the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1971). Ghana and Cameroon have won four titles each.\n\nIn May 2010, it was announced that the tournament would be moved to odd-numbered years from 2013. This will mean the tournament will now not take place in the same year as the FIFA World Cup. The 2010 tournament was unfortunately shrouded in controversy after the Togo team bus was set upon by gunfire leading to the tragic death of three officials. Togo left the competition as a result. Egypt eventually won the tournament, defeating Ghana in the final.\n\nIn 2012 the tournament was co-hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The 2012 surprise winners were Zambia who defeated Ivory Coast in a penalty shoot-out in the final held in the Stade d'Angondjé, Libreville.\n\nZambia's players celebrate their ACON success after defeating Ivory Coast in the 2012 Final\n\nThe win was dedicated to the 18 players who perished in April 1993, after a plane carrying the Zambia squad crashed just miles from the site of the 2012 final in Gabon. Malia beat Ghana in the 3rd place match. Christopher Katongo of Zambia, who plays professionally for Chinese Super League club Henan Construction F.C. as a striker was voted most valuable player. Frenchman Hervé Renard was the Zambian coach.\n\nAll-time ACON top scorers:\n\nSamuel Eto'o - Cameroon 18 goals\n\nLaurent Pokou - Ivory Coast - 14\n\nRashidi Yekini - Nigeria - 13\n\nHassan El-Shazly - Egypt - 12\n\nPatrick Mboma - Cameroon and Hossam Hassan - Egypt - both 11.\n\n23 English-based players have been named in provisional squads ahead of the tournament, and they are as follows:\n\nSouth Africa: Kagisho Dikgacoi (Crystal Palace, right), Dean Furman (Oldham).\n\nMorocco: Oussama Assaidi (Liverpool).\n\nGhana: Albert Adomah (Bristol City).\n\nMali: Samba Diakite (QPR), Mahamadou Diarra (Fulham), Tongo Doumbia (Wolves), Modibo Maiga (West Ham).\n\nCongo DR: Gabriel Zakuani (Peterborough), Youssouf Mulumbu (West Bromwich Albion).\n\nZambia: Emmanuel Mayuka (Southampton).\n\nNigeria: John Obi Mikel, Victor Moses (both Chelsea), Shola Ameobi (Newcastle), Danny Shittu (Millwall).\n\nIvory Coast: Kolo Toure, Yaya Toure, Abdul Razak (all Manchester City), Cheick Tiote (Newcastle), Arouna Kone (Wigan, front right), Gervinho (Arsenal) .\n\nAlgeria: Adlene Guedioura (Nottingham Forest).\n\nTogo: Emmanuel Adebayor (Tottenham).\n\nStadium Venues:\n\nThe venues were announced on 4 May 2012. The National Stadium (Johannesburg) will host the opening match and the final. Other the venues selected for matches are Mbombela Stadium (Nelspruit), Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium (port Elizabeth), Royal Bafokeng Stadium (Rustenburg) and Moses Mabhida Stadium(Durban)\n\nTeams:\n\nGroup A: South Africa, Angola, Morocco, Cape Verde\n\nGroup B: Ghana, Mali, Niger, Congo DR\n\nGroup C: Zambia, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia\n\nGroup D: Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Algeria, Togo\n\nThe top two teams from each group qualify for the the knockout stages beginning on the 2nd February.\n\nThe semi-finals take place on the 6th February and the final is on the 10th February.\n\nAfrica Cup Of Nations: The betting and the players to watch out for!\n\nIvory Coast at 7/4 are favourites to win the 2013 tournament, followed by Ghana 7/1, hosts South Africa 9/1 then Nigeria 10/1 and holders Zambia at shades of 12/1. Togo and Ethopia are the rank outsiders. However I believe there are better value betting options to consider than the Ivory Coast.\n\nIvory Coast, last years beaten finalists are on paper at least the stand-out side. They boast a wealth of internationally recognised talent in the form of Yaya Toure, Kolo Toure, Didier Drogba, Arouna Kone, Salomon Kalou and a host of other familiar faces are all there, and having come so close last time they and their fans will be in expectant mood.However not only have they been put in Group D with former champions Algeria and Tunisia and a Togo team with all to gain and nothing to lose, but tradition suggests potential trouble for the title favourites, and at 7/4 they look far too short a price.\n\nGhana will be missing their best player, Andre Ayew, who has a hamstring injury. One of Africa's finest players, Ayew the Marseille winger/striker will be sorely missed. His absence deals a potentially fatal blow to the Black Stars' hopes of becoming champions.\n\nI like the look of Morocco at 18/1 - France-based players Zakaria Bergdich (Lens), Abdelhamid El Kaoutari (Montpellier), Younes Belhanda (Montpellier) and Chahir Belghazouani (AC Ajaccio) arrive in fine form, and they have a good striker in Youssef El Arabi of La Liga side Granada CF.\n\nMali's squad is packed with power and talent - Samba Sow (Lens), Cheick Fantamady Diarra (Rennes) and Sambou Yatabare (Lens) are names to look out for. Mali and Algeria are both 16/1 outsiders to win the tournament but both look capable of causing an upset in this years competition. Mali came third at the 2012 finals and are the obvious choice to progress from Group B along with Ghana, but DR Congo pose a threat if only because they are coached by wily Frenchman Claude le Roy. A small wager on either Mali and Algeria making the final could be a shrewd bet.\n\nAlgeria have in Ryad Boudebouz (FC Sochaux) and Foued Kadir (Marseille) two of the most technically gifted players in the tournament. Boudebouz and Kadir are both attacking midfielder players and are sure to excel in South Africa.\n\nOther players to look out for in the tournament. I can see debutant's Cape Verde causing an upset or two, because they have one of the tournament's finest young footballers in Lille's Ryan Mendes, an explosive attacker with flair and good finishing ability. Also look out for flying winger Odair Fortes (Stade Reims) and striker Julio Tavares (Dijon).\n\nBurkino Faso have two outstanding attacking players in Lorient's Alain Traore and Rennes' Jonathan Pitroipa. Burkin Faso have been drawn in one of the two more winnable groups, alongside Zambia, Nigeria and Ethiopia and their odds of 6/1 to win their group, look overpriced!\n\nMy Best Bet:\n\nMorocco to Win the Tournament at 14/1\n\nOutside Bets:\n\nOne of Mali or Algeria to Reach The Final both at 5/2\n\nLongshot:\n\nBurkina Faso to Win Group C at 6/1\n\n# Odds courtesy of Betfair and correct at time of writing.\n\nGo to oddschecker for all your ACON betting.\n\nLive coverage of the 2013 African Cup of Nations on TV will be shown on ITV4 and British Eurosport in the UK.

The club are currently members of the Isthmian League Premier Division, and play at The Dripping Pan (often just called The Pan). Although one of the more obscure stadium names you’ll ever come across it’s a ground steeped in history. Local Lewes legend suggests it was part of the salt making industry run by monks from the Cluniac Lewes Priory.\n\nThis also accounted for the pitch being sunk below ground level and being surrounded by grass banks on all sides, allowing spectators to sit at the top and watch the game.\n\nIt has been the home of 'The Rooks' since their beginnings in 1885 and has a capacity of 3,000 although only 300 of those are seated. The Dripping Pan was chosen as one of the Top 5 Non-League away days by the football blog 'The Ball is Round' in September 2010.\n\nWankdorf Stadium:\n\nA headline-writer’s dream became a reality with the birth of the outrageously comical stadium name given to the Swiss club team BSC Young Boys. As a result arguably one the was inspired by the move of Young Boys from the old Wankdorf to their new Stade de Suisse Wankdorf in 2005. ESPN cooked up a storm with the story by using the simple but effective line: ‘Young Boys Wankdorf erection relief’.\n\nThe old Wankdorf Stadium (German: Wankdorfstadion) was a football stadium in the Wankdorf quarter of Bern, Switzerland, and the former home of Swiss club BSC Young Boys. It was built in 1925, and as well as serving as a club stadium, it hosted several important matches, including the 1954 FIFA World Cup Final, the 1961 European Cup final, and the 1989 Cup Winners' Cup final. The Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf has been built in its place.\n\nThe band Muse credits Wankdorf stadium as inspiring the aptly named 'Wankdorf Jam'\n\nHunky Dorys Park:\n\nDrogheda United Football Club (Irish: Cumann Peile Dhroichead Átha Aontaithe) is an Irish football club currently playing in the Premier Division of the League of Ireland. The Boynesiders were once dubbed the 'Chelsea of the Irish league' due to their big-spending ways which landed them the FAI Cup in 2005 and their first ever league title two years later. Things went downhill rapidly shortly afterwards, with the club enduring financial problems. Step forward Ireland’s leading crinkle-cut crisp brand to bail them out and save the day in 2010. They now play in a stadium named after the number one crinkle cut crisp brand in Ireland - Hunky Dorys.\n\nDubbed ‘the Chelsea of Ireland’ the clubs relaxed mentality when it came to spending landed them in serious financial peril. Everything appears to be hunky dory (forgive me) at Drogahead now as they continue to fight at the top of the League of Ireland Premier Division.\n\nGiant Axe:\n\nLancaster City F.C. is an English football club based in Lancaster, Lancashire. The club are currently members of Northern Premier League Division One North and play at Giant Axe, located close to Lancaster railway station and both Lancaster Castle and Lancaster Priory Church. It has been their home ground since the formation of the original club 1905.\n\nThe reason for the idiosyncratic name is that when the ground was first built it was the centrepiece of a sports club, the exterior wall of which was, when viewed from above, the same shape as an axe head!\n\nCashpoint Arena:\n\nThe Cashpoint Arena is an Austrian football stadium in Vorarlberg Altach. It is the home of SC Rheindorf Altach, a football club playing in the Austrian First League, which is the second tier in Austrian football. The stadium was built 1989-90 and was opened on 1st June 1990 under the name Schnabelholz, and has a capacity of 8,500 spectators. It's sponsors are Cashpoint, one of the largest bookmakers in Europe.\n\nThe stadium offers a unique atmosphere because the visitors are near to the playing field. But the stadium is not only used for football, but also for open air concerts and other events.\n\nPizza Hut Park:\n\nFC Dallas is an American professional soccer club based in the Dallas suburb of Frisco, Texas which competes in Major League Soccer (MLS)\n\nThe FC Dallas Stadium is a soccer-specific stadium with a 20,500-seat capacity, built and owned by the city of Frisco, Texas. Aside from the main field inside it has 17 grass and artificial football pitches outside.\n\nIn 2005, the naming rights to the facility were acquired by the large pizza chain Pizza Hut whose corporate headquarters are in Plano, Texas (a northern Dallas suburb). On 7th January 2012, the naming rights sponsorship ended and the facility is now known as FC Dallas Stadium.\n\nBargain Booze Stadium:\n\nWincham Park, home of Witton Albion F.C. is a football stadium in Wincham, a parish on the edge of Northwich, England. The Club was founded in 1887 and currently play in the Northern Premier League Premier Division (seventh tier of the English football league system).\n\nThe stadium has had a number of names due to sponsorship deals; these include the Bargain Booze Stadium, Brittania Carpets Stadium and its current name, The Help For Heroes Stadium.\n\nKitKat Crescent:\n\nThe last place you would expect a Swiss sweets manufacturer (Nestlé) to set up a factory would be in the picturesque City of York. But thank goodness they did as in 2005 they bailed out the towns football club, renaming Bootham Crescent after one of their popular chocolate bars.\n\nKitKat Crescent remained for five-years before the naming rights deal expired. The ground returned to being known as Bootham Crescent after this arrangement expired in January 2010. The league two sides ground currently has a capacity of 7,872.\n\nMitsubishi Forklift Stadion:\n\nMitsubishi Forklift Stadion is a multi-use stadium in Almere, Netherlands. It is currently used mostly for football matches and is the home stadium of Almere City Football Club, a Dutch football club founded in 2001. Almere City play in the Jupiler League, the second tier of Dutch football.\n\nThey can trace its history back to 1972, with the merger of DWS, Volewijckers and Blauw-Wit into FC Amsterdam. Disgruntled DWS supporters founded their own club, called De Zwarte Schapen, named after their nickname, which translates as Black Sheep.\n\nIn March 2010 the club was renamed AFC Almere City, before being changed again a few weeks later to Almere City F.C. as the AFC prefix was deemed to be too reminiscent of the club's partners AFC Ajax. The stadium is able to hold 3,000 people (500 seated) and was built in 2005.\n\nGay Meadow:\n\nThe Gay Meadow is the former home ground of Shrewsbury Town F.C. The ground closed in June 2007, at the end of the 2006-07 Football League season, as the club moved to a new stadium, the New Meadow, also known as the Greenhous Meadow for sponsorship purposes.\n\nThe Gay Meadow's location on the banks of the River Severn meant the club suffered with flooding. Severe floods in 1998, 2000 and frequently since had affected the club, with several matches postponed, a flooded pitch and flooded offices and changing rooms.\n\nSupporters of the move claimed that the risk of flooding along with the Gay Meadow's cramped location, meant that a move to a new ground was essential in order for the club to remain as a Football League club.\n\nShrewsbury Town went 34 games unbeaten at the Greenhous Meadow between March 2011 and September 2012, a record stretching over three different seasons.\n\n↧\n\nAn Alternative List of Football Club Fines\n\nThis week Arsène Wenger found himself commenting on the Gunners’ disciplinary policy after a document printed on Arsenal headed paper, detailing a list of rules for players and the cash penalties if they were broken appeared on the internet after a fan, reported to be a friend of club doctor Gary O’Driscoll, took a photo of the fines sheet during a tour of the training ground.\n\nArsène Wenger's strict disciplinary regime was exposed this week!\n\nThe supporter then posted it on a file-sharing website, believing it would be seen only by himself and his close friends, only for the document to go ‘viral’ across the net.\n\nIt then emerged as to why Arsenal manager why defender Per Mertesacker had become the club's debt collector.\n\nThe German international is responsible for rounding up fines from fellow players who fell foul of the club's internal disciplinary rules,with fines doubled if they are not settled in seven days. Wenger joked: \"The Germans do well economically and we respect that. They are the only ones that make money in Europe. That's why we've chosen a German,\" the Frenchman added of the 85-times capped Mertesacker.\n\nThe fines included are £1,000 for players not turning up for matches they are not involved in, £500 for arriving late for travel or training, £250 for not turning up on time to a team meeting or meal and £100 for taking a newspaper, laptop or phone into the medical area or dressing room.\n\nThe Gunners boss even lays down the law over the clothing worn by his players, with £100 docked for items deemed inappropriate.\n\nList of Arsenal FC 2012/13 Player Fines\n\nHere is an alternative and light-hearted list of football club fines for players' whose behaviour may be considered not becoming of their club, amateur or professional:\n\n50p fine:\n\nDirty boots (Cleaning your boots in the changing room on match day does not constitute having clean boots’ and you will therefore still receive the fine).\n\nNot running the line.\n\nPutting your kit on back to front.\n\nAir kick.\n\nFoul throw.\n\nPutting the ball over the fence and not retrieving it.\n\n£1 fine:\n\nNot showering post-match.\n\nNot doing the nets (Before and after home games).\n\nClaiming goals that were really crosses.\n\nWearing shit casual clothes.\n\nTaking kit home (£1 per garment).\n\nArguing with team mates during game.\n\nHitting the woodwork (this ain't the cross-bar challenge!).\n\n£2 fine:\n\nBackchat to manager.\n\nPenalty miss.\n\n'Chump of the Match' (Voted by the players individually in the changing rooms after the match. The person with most votes gets fined - they can be nominated for anything for e.g. a f*ck up during the match, an all-round piss poor individual performance etc).\n\nTalking during gaffers pre-match / half-time team talk (even if he is speaking boll*x).\n\nParticipating in a training or match day bust up with a teammate.\n\nNot staying for a post-match beer (Home or away).\n\nMilking injuries.\n\nSmoking during a game (£2 per fag).\n\n£5 fine:\n\nOwn goal.\n\nExcessive showboating (e.g Back healing the ball when you could just pass it normally).\n\nPleasuring a dog - Four legged variety.\n\nWearing make-up on match day.\n\nLeaving a game before it has finished.\n\nPulling out of a match due to charity work.\n\n£10 fine:\n\nNot wearing ladies underwear for a cup game.\n\nThrowing up at an official club function.\n\nBringing along a 'minger' to a match (if in doubt the Club Committee will decide).\n\nArguing against fines.\n\n£150 fine:\n\nAny form of misbehaving with a players' missus!\n\nAll fines are listed as a guideline and the 'fines master' and committee have the right to change or add to them at any point without any notice.\n\nAll the money that gets collected will pay for the Christmas do and go towards trophies for the end of season do.\n\n↧\n\nBabes of the Month - Absolutely Booty-Full\n\n↧\n\nGoing Going Vonn! Crash injuries end Lindsey Vonn’s season, but not her hopes!\n\nOne year and two days before the women's downhill at the Sochi Olympics in Russia, American Olympic champion Lindsey Vonn, whose record breaking ski-racing career has frequently mixed stirring triumph with frightening spills, suffered debilitating injuries to her right leg in a violent crash during a race at the World Championships in Schladming, Austria yesterday — putting her out for the rest of this World Cup season and potentially complicating the defence of her Olympic title.\n\nLindsay Vonn is hospitalized after this fall in a super-G race in Schladming, Austria on Tuesday\n\nThe United States Ski and Snowboard Association announced on Tuesday that Vonn suffered two torn ligaments in her right knee — the medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligaments — as well as a fractured lateral tibial plateau in the same knee after crashing in the super-G in Schladming.\n\nVonn, the Minnesota-born skier took a month off this season after being hospitalised for an intestinal illness in November, and had just regained her form with two wins last month.\n\nTuesday's race, the first of the World Championships, was delayed nearly four hours because of fog. There were more than ten separate delays as officials struggled to get the race in with daylight fading. Vonn led Slovenia's Tina Maze, the best female skier during this World Cup season after the first stage of the race.\n\nVonn who was the 19th racer out of the starting gate for the second stage, skied well at the top of the course. She led Maze by 0.04 seconds at the first checkpoint, and was just 0.12 seconds back at the second interval, and seemingly on her way to a medal, if not victory!\n\nAbout 42 seconds into her run, as Vonn made a right-footed turn and arced her skis to the left, she navigated a jump at the same time. Vonn soared above the snow a little off balance with her hands behind her torso rather than in front of her chest, which usually ensures a more stable landing.\n\nReturning to the snow, her right leg splayed briefly to the right and her knee hyper-extended inward and toward the left. She pitched forward at the same time and began to flip forward. Her right ski came off, cartwheeling down the slope after her. Vonn came to a stop a few hundred feet down the slope without making contact with the protective fencing, though she did plough through a gate. She was attended by medical personnel for 12 minutes on the side of the trail and airlifted to a hospital.\n\nChristian Kaulfersch, the assistant medical director at the worlds, said Vonn left the Schladming hospital on Tuesday afternoon and will have surgery in another hospital. \"She first wanted to go back to the team hotel to mentally deal with all what has happened.\"\n\nThe Olympic downhill champion will have surgery next week in Vail, Colorado. Due to intense media attention, neither she nor the U.S Ski Team would say when she's leaving Austria.\n\n\"She'll be heading back to Vail (Colorado) and I will be doing surgery on her knee early next week,\" team physician William Sterett told The Associated Press today.\n\nMaze won the race, with Switzerland’s Lara Gut taking silver and American Julia Mancuso, Vonn’s longtime rival, winning bronze.\n\nVonn has enjoyed a significant amount of media attention for an alpine skier, making her the face of her sport. She has appeared on The Today Show, Access Hollywood, and The Late Show with David Letterman and has picked up endorsements from notable companies such as Head, Oakley, Red Bull, Rolex, and Under Armour.\n\nVonn appeared in Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Edition that featured Winter Olympians in 2010. Her assets were estimated to be worth over 2.5 million dollars back in 2010.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsay Vonn on the set of her Sports Illustrated swimsuit shoot back in 2010\n\nVonn's list of injuries at major championships is long:\n\nTwo years ago, she pulled out midway through the last worlds in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, because of a mild concussion.\n\nAt the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Vonn skied despite a severely bruised shin to win the downhill and take bronze in the super-G.\n\nAt the 2009 worlds in Val d'Isere, she sliced her thumb on a champagne bottle after sweeping gold in the downhill and super-G, forcing her out of the giant slalom.\n\nAt the 2007 worlds in Are, Sweden, Vonn injured her knee in training and missed her final two events.\n\nAt the 2006 Turin Olympics, she had a horrific crash in downhill training and went directly from her hospital room to the mountain to compete in four of her five events.\n\nLindsey Vonn faces yet another enforced break from her sport, but this one occurs with only a year to go before the Sochi Olympics.\n\nLindsey Vonn is on pace to become the most accomplished female skier ever. Her career resume is as follows:\n\n1984: Born: St. Paul, Minnesota, United States\n\n2000: World Cup debut aged 16 in Park City, Utah\n\n2002: Competes at Winter Olympics in Utah aged 17 in downhill and combined\n\n2004: Claims first World Cup race win at Lake Louise in Canada\n\n2008: Wins first World Cup title to become only the second American woman to lift the trophy\n\n2009: Wins World Championships in Val-d'Isère, France, and becomes first American to win women's world super-G title\n\n2010: Wins gold in the downhill and bronze in super-G at the Vancouver Olympics\n\n2012: Regains World Cup overall title\n\n4 Overall World Cup titles\n\n16 World Cup discipline titles, tied 1st all-time\n\n59 World Cup victories, the 2nd most all-time (3 shy of record).\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nYou can’t buy experience! - Why ‘Super Kev’ can shoot Crystal Palace to the promise land!\n\nKevin Mark Phillips, may be diminutive in height but he has a presence and aura that is both dynamic and effective, and Ian Holloway’s capture of ‘Super Kev’ on a transfer deadline day loan to Crystal Palace may be pivotal in ‘The Eagles’ attempt to successfully secure promotion to the Premier League this season.\n\nKevin Phillips comes off the bench to equalize for Crystal Palace at Watford last week\n\nAs numerous names and potential Palace targets such as George Boyd, Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, Albert Adomah and DJ Campbell were banded about during the hectic January transfer window, many Palace fans were bemoaning the fact that Kevin Phillips was even in the frame!\n\nThere were still a lot of furrowed brows when he signed for the South London Club on loan until the end of the current season. Phillips was seen by many as a footballing veteran at 39 years young, with over 450 senior starts spread over a career spanning nearly 20 years. Numerous fans questioned the signing of Phillips and the ambition of the club, in what many saw as a gamble on a player who was surely over the hill!\n\nOn his move to Palace Phillips was the ‘ultimate pro’ saying exactly what the Club and fans alike wanted to hear: \"Every time I pull on a Palace shirt or a training kit I will give 100 per cent and I thoroughly look forward to it. Palace are an exciting team, I enjoyed working under Ian Holloway at Blackpool and I really look forward to working with him from now until the end of the season.\"\n\nSince joining Palace, Phillips had made two substitute appearances and on both occasions he has been instrumental in a change in fortune on the pitch. Less than two weeks ago the Crystal Palace team trudged off the Selhurst Park pitch at half-time looking crestfallen, after a woeful first-half performance against London rivals Charlton. The visitors had dominated the first 45 minutes and deservedly led at the break. Palace were lacklustre and void of ideas. Holloway took immediate action and the former England striker was handed his debut as a half-time substitute.\n\nMurray and Phillips (right) celebrate!\n\nThis change in personnel clearly had the desired affect as Phillips helped spark a dramatic turnaround. Two goals from the Championship’s top scorer Glenn Murray secured a dramatic 2-1 victory for Palace, with Phillip’s orchestrating a calm, creative and significant influence on the game.\n\nThe Palace manager was naturally delighted by Phillip’s debut and the social message boards were awash with praise for the Hitchin born striker. Sentences containing adjectives such as classy, sublime, nippy, polished and impressive were used to describe the impact Phillips had on the match. As a result many fans were forced to eat at least a little piece of humble pie.\n\nA week later and he was at it again, as Palace rescued a point at high flying Watford, despite going into the break two goals down.\n\nPhillips’ introduction at Vicarage Road 10 minutes after half-time culminated in a non-stop second-half onslaught by a rejuvenated Palace team with Phillips and teenage sensation Jonny Williams playing a father and son age defining double act, culminating in Palace coming away with a well deserved point. Phillips firstly providing a good foil for fellow striker Murray, and secondly getting the all important equalizing goal, as he made a wonderfully timed run into the penalty box to expertly dispatch Jazz Richards’ low cross at the far post - his 243rd career league goal!\n\nI don’t think the first 80 minutes of football played by Phillips in the red and blue shirt should be underestimated, as his introduction on both occasions has been quite simply ‘game changing.’ Most players take a while to settle in at a new club, but not ‘Super Kev.’ He signs for Palace, moves down to the South of England, meets up with his old manager, his new team-mates, has a training session or two, and on match day he puts in a couple of performances that make him look like he has been at the club since the year dot!\n\nNot only is a Phillips a class act on match day, but I am sure his experience and knowledge will rub off on the youth in a Palace squad with some outstanding young talent at its disposal.\n\nThroughout his professional career Kevin Phillips has averaged nearly a goal every other club game and commanded transfer fees with a cumulative total in excess of £5million. Palace are his eighth club since he turned professional in December 1994, and he represented England on eight occasions making his debut against Malta in Ta’Qali in June 2000 under the stewardship of Kevin Keegan, before bowing out of the England set-up, against Holland in the Amsterdam Arena in February 2002 under Sven-Göran Eriksson.\n\nIn 1999-2000 Phillips was the Premier League Player of the Season, the Premier League top scorer with 30 goals for Sunderland, a tally which won him both the Premiership Golden Boot and the European Golden Boot. He remains the only Englishman to win the European Golden Boot.\n\nPhillips was a Football League Championship winner and the Football League Championship Player of the Year with West Brom in 2007-08, and a Football League Cup winner with Birmingham City in 2011.\n\nLast season at the tender age of 38, Phillips helped Blackpool reach the Championship play-off final at Wembley, and finished as the club’s leading scorer with 16 Championship goals in 41 appearances.\n\nWhen speaking on his arrival at Palace, Phillips was visibly grateful to Ian Holloway for bringing him to the club and giving him one final hurrah. He said: \"I don't want to let him down (Ian Holloway). He's brought me here and I want to repay the faith he has shown in me\".............and believe me, he has already started to repay the belief Holloway showed in him!\n\nCould Mr P be the transfer coup of the season for Crystal Palace? That one individual that brings a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’ to the table every day he is at the Club, whether it be on the training ground, in team meetings or on match day?\n\nTime will tell, but for now it looks like a very shrewd bit of business on the part of Ian Holloway and the owners of Crystal Palace Football Club.\n\nYou cannot buy experience, so Mr Kevin Phillips welcome aboard the Crystal Palace rollercoaster! It’s never dull, so hold on tight and enjoy the ride!\n\n# Photos courtesy of the BBC and The Sun Newspaper Group.\n\n↧\n\nUnlikely Superhero – Crystal Palace’s very own Rambo!\n\nWhen Peter Iain Ramage signed for Crystal Palace on a one-year contract in August 2012, even as a Crystal Palace fan I have to say I was left feeling somewhat uninspired!\n\nI had witnessed the Whitley Bay born defender in action for ‘The Eagles’ during his five month loan spell with us during the 2011/12 season. To be fair to Ramage during that time (which included 17 league appearances) he tended to be used by the then manager Dougie Freedman as a ‘utility’ player, and he flitted between the full-back and centre-half positions.\n\nRamage - In the form of his life!\n\nAs a result the 29 year-old had little opportunity to put a marker down, and establish himself in an ever changing back-four. In the first-half of the 2011/12 season Palace were in a defensive mess as they juggled numerous players in an attempt to find a settled back-four. By the time Ramage’s loan period had come to an end on the 15th January 2012, he had played with 11 different defensive partners in McCarthy, Davies, Tunchev, McGivern, Gardner, Clyne, Keinan, Eagan, Parsons, Moxey and Parr.\n\nHowever Freedman had no hesitation in re-signing the Geordie lad for the start of the 2012/13 campaign. The signing of Ramage may have been initially as cover following the loss of Club captain Paddy McCarthy. McCarthy sustained a groin injury in the summer, and as I write is still sidelined and has yet to feature in a first-team game this season.\n\nHowever it has proved to be an inspired signing as the player affectionately known as ‘Rambo’ has played a pivitol role in a wonderful season so far for the boys from SE25.\n\nRambo has established a solid, no nonsense central defensive partnership with Irishman Damien Delaney (right) this season, and his passion and desire is written all over his face during the heat of battle! Ramage has started 31 of 33 league games this season, come on as a substitute in another and since our opening day defeat to Watford at Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace are unbeaten at home this season, a run of 16 games at ‘Fortress Selhurst.’\n\nIt must be said that several of the reasons for the success on the pitch this season can be attributed to confidence, attitude, belief and fitness. But unlike last season stability in defence in terms of personnel has been crucial.\n\nBefore Palace signed Delaney from Ipswich on the 31st August, Ramage was paired at the heart of the defence with Aaron Martin a loanee from Southampton, but Palace lost their opening three league games of the season conceding nine goals in the process. Upon his arrival Delaney was immediately paired with Ramage and the two have been inseparable ever since, other than a three game suspension handed to the Irishman for seeing red at Huddersfield just before Christmas.\n\nDespite the upheaval with the departure of the rather flaccid Dougie (the grass is not always greener on the other side) Freedman and the backroom staff to Bolton in late October, and the subsequent arrival of the flamboyant Ian Holloway as his replacement in the managerial hot seat, Rambo has rolled with it all, without flinching or suffering any long term heartbreak! In fact Holloway’s arrival has probably seen Ramage develop as a player due to the Bristolian’s style of play, which allows players to express themselves a lot more by playing a fluid passing game with the emphasis on getting forward more often, rather than strangling the life out of a 1-0 lead!\n\nRamage (wearing 28) shows what it means to him after scoring against Watford this month!\n\nRamage has even contributed with some rare but vital goals this season. He has in fact scored twice as many goals for Crystal Palace this season than he has over his entire professional career, having made his first-team debut for Newcastle United as a substitute in a UEFA Cup tie on the 16th March 2005.\n\nHis first goal in the red and blue of Palace came at The Walkers Stadium in October, as the Londoner's turned over the then league leaders Leicester City 2-1. Ramage then bagged a consolation goal in a 2-1 defeat at Leeds in November, before netting a vital goal at Watford this month, followed by a second goal in consecutive games as Palace thrashed Middlesbrough at Selhurst Park last week. His smart turn and shot against Boro’ was a goal that any striker would have been proud of, and it was also his first goal for the club at Selhurst Park.\n\nOn the pitch Rambo is the consummate professional, whilst off the pitch he comes across as a great lad, a family man who will always takes time out to chat to the fans and someone who loves a bit of banter with his team-mates. I imagine he is an inspirational, yet calming figure in the dressing room and someone that all the lads, particularly the youngster’s look up to!\n\nHe is also becoming somewhat of an unlikely favourite among the fans. You cannot as a football fan fail to revere a man who gives everything, a player who wears his heart on his sleeve and plays for the badge on his chest.......and who always goes to, and applauds the fans at the end of every match!\n\nRambo you are a credit to yourself and Crystal Palace Football Club and you won’t be far off winning this season’s Palace ‘Player of the Year’ award as voted for by us, the fans!\n\nYou can follow Peter Ramage on twitter or find him after training at most good coffee outlets, with Damien Delaney and Andre Moritz!\n\nPictures courtesy of: FiveYearPlanFanzine.co.uk and RednBlueArmy.co.uk\n\n↧\n\nBabe of the Month - Sexy WAG Sarah Brandner\n\nSarah Brandner was born on 12th December 1988 in Munich, Germany. Sarah is not by any means the first WAG who has worked as a model. She became a model like many when she was discovered on the streets by an agent who spotted her and asked her if she would be interested in modelling. At first she wasn't so sure, especially because she was only fifteen years old at the time.\n\nAt 5'11\" tall and with a perfect figure (84-60-90) Sarah eventually decided to venture into modelling and was soon on the books of Place Models in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nShe is perhaps best known for featuring in the 2010 Sports Illustrated Body Painting Issue, along with Abbey Clancy, Bethany Dempsey, and Melissa Satta. She has also done notable work for German magazine Bild, and GQ Germany.\n\nIt was during her time at school where at a social event she first met footballer Bastian Schweinsteiger, but it wasn't until they met again in Ibiza in 2007 that they started dating, and the couple now live together in Munich.\n\nHer modelling career has taken Sarah to change her residence address several times from Milan to New York and from New York to Munich, where she is currently living with her famous beau.\n\n↧\n\nInsane Sports – ChessBoxing\n\nLooking to take up a new hobby or sport, well I may have found you the perfect activity, a combination of physical prowess and mental agility – Chessboxing!\n\nA curious combination of brain and brawn, the sport of chessboxing has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years. Inspired by a science fiction graphic novel, the sport combines the physical action of the squared ring with the mental agility of the chequered board classic. The matches see competitors alternate between three-minute boxing exchanges with four-minute rounds of speed chess, with a one minute break between rounds. The winner is then determined by knockout, checkmate or referee’s decision.\n\nA knockout or checkmate can lead to an early win, and the fight can also be cut short if a player exceeds the chess time limit (12 minutes per contest) or the referee decides the fight has to be aborted. If the game of chess ends with a tie, it is settled with the points earned in the boxing rounds. If the boxing fight ends with a tie, the player who had black on the chessboard wins.\n\nThe same people box and play chess, a common misconception is that there is a handover between a chessplayer and a separate boxer.\n\nThe game in it's current format originated from the mind of Serbian cartoonist Enki Bilal, who penned a graphic novel 'Froid Équateur' (literally ‘Cold Equator’) featuring the game in 1992, in which the themes of a healthy spirit in a healthy body and aggression management played a role.\n\nHowever purists argue that the game was originally conceived in the 1991 Finnish film 'Uuno Turhapuro, herra Helsingin herra,' in which a man makes chess moves over a hands-free telephone headset while simultaneously beating seven bells out of another man. This makes me wonder why they don't do actual chess boxing that way, but who am I to tell them how to do their jobs!\n\nThe World Chess Boxing Organisation (WCBO) is the governing body of the sport chess boxing. The WCBO was founded in 2003 and has its headquarters in Berlin, Germany. Its current president is Iepe Rubingh, founder of the sport.\n\nThe WCBO's motto is: \"Fighting is done in the ring and wars are waged on the board\".\n\nChessboxing events have taken place in London, Los Angeles, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Calcutta. The contestants boast names such as: Anti-Terror, the Beast, the Slice and the Priest.\n\nThe first official chess boxing fight ever to be held was the Middleweight World Championship between 'Iepe the Joker' and 'Luis the Lawyer' on the 14th November 2003 at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. 'Iepe the Joker' won the match after a dramatic fight in the 11th and last round when 'Luis the Lawyer' exceeded his chess playing time limit.\n\nChessboxing is the ultimate challenge for both the body and the mind. More and more contemporary athletic disciplines are characterised by multifaceted challenges. It’s comparable to a biathlon, as one example. Extreme physical stress is combined with a huge mental challenge. Chessboxing is a bit more radical than a biathlon, but through targeted training, the body can be prepared for matches just as well as it can for a biathlon. The alteration between boxing and playing chess represents the biggest challenge.\n\nNaturally you might assume that a professional boxer would automatically have an advantage and could potentially win the world champion title in the second round of the fight?\n\nHowever Championship fights require fulfilment of the following:\n\nYou must be younger than 35, be in an exceptionally good state of physical fitness, have experience in a minimum number of 20 boxing matches and your chess ELO rating must not be lower than 1800. If you don’t have an ELO rating yet or any comparable ranking from a national chess organisation in your country, our chess trainer will test your skills online. Someone like Vitali Klitschko would need years of training to achieve the chess rating required.\n\nAs its popularity grows, there are hopes that one day the sport will be recognised by the Olympics.\n\nThe next Chessboxing event takes place later this month, on the 23rd March 2013 at the Scarla London, 275 Pentonville Road, London N1 9NL, from 7pm until late.\n\nTickets are £20 in advance or £25 on the night - the perfect 'Mother's Day' gift!\n\nYou can follow the London Chessboxing scene including forthcoming events and videos on Twitter\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nIntense Football Rivalry - Crystal Palace versus Brighton\n\nBrighton and Hove Albion host Crystal Palace this coming Sunday lunchtime, the 17th March 2013, as one of the fiercest fan rivalries in British football is reignited again!\n\nAt first glance, it may seem strange that one of English football's fiercest rivalries is between two teams 60 miles apart, one Club which resides on the South Coast, whilst the other is in South London.\n\nCorrect, they are not in the same county let alone the same city, there's no deep routed historical reason, no trading rivalries between the areas, no religious differences, it's pure and simple - a genuine footballing rivalry based on the fact that both clubs used to play each other a lot and had managers happy to stoke up the fires of rivalry.\n\nCrystal Palace and Brighton are fierce rivals - See why!\n\nMany football fans assume that Millwall and Charlton are Palace’s main rivals, being so close in location, and that Portsmouth 40 miles along the coast might be Brighton's number one enemy.\n\nTo really understand the hatred between Palace and Brighton you need to turn the clock back to the 1970's and the days of Mullery v Venables.\n\nBetween January 1963 and August 1974 there were no competitive fixtures at all between Palace and Brighton - as Brighton got relegated into Division Four in 1963 and Palace started their climb into the top flight.\n\nTheir rivalry did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974. The clubs had two of the division's biggest followings, communications between Croydon and Brighton were good and many fans were keen to travel to an away fixture.\n\nSo in August 1974 the two teams met in full competition, for the first time since the early 1960's in the old Division Three, and both clubs with new nicknames to boot. \"The Dolphins\" versus \"The Eagles\" was the first game of that 74-75 season and Palace suffered a 1-0 reverse in front of the largest crowd to watch Palace at home that season. The following March, revenge was metered out by Palace as they defeated the South Coast side 3-0. The win did little to aid Palace's dying promotion effort, but it almost spelt disaster for Brighton, who only narrowly avoided relegation.\n\nThe following season Palace got off to a flying start, were undefeated in their opening seven games and sat proudly at the summit of the division. Then came the visit of Brighton and with it a 1-0 defeat. It wasn't a disaster in footballing terms at the time, as come Christmas Palace were sitting pretty at the top of the league by seven clear points. By the time the away fixture came around, Palace were in the midst of the great FA Cup run of 1976, but their league form had deserted them and Palace went down 2-0. Brighton finished the season in fourth, a place above Palace on goal difference and they had completed the 'double' over their rivals.\n\nIt was the following season that the fireworks really began!\n\nTerry Venables, fresh out of coaching school under the late Malcolm Allison was the new manager at Palace, and Alan Mullery was appointed the new boss at Brighton, after Brighton manager Peter Taylor rejoined his old mate the late Brian Clough, up at Forest. Both clubs were the biggest in the old Division Three and doing quite well.\n\nIn the 1976-77 season the sides meet five times: twice in the league and three times to decide an First Round FA Cup tie. To say neither manager had much time for the other would be understating the case. Palace remained undefeated against Brighton over the season recording three draws and two victories.\n\nIt was an FA Cup second round replay at neutral Stamford Bridge that finally ignited the already smouldering blue touch paper that season. Mullery got out of his pram about a number of dodgy decisions from referee Ron Challis, including a converted Brighton penalty that had to be retaken and a disallowed goal! The retake was saved by Paul Hammond. That referee is still known as \"Challis of the Palace\" down in Brighton! It culminated in Mullery blowing his top in front of the Palace fans who were giving him abuse for his outraged protests. He flung down about a fiver's worth of change into a puddle and screamed \"You're not worth that, Palace\" - in the end, the police had to lead him away! At the end of the 1976-77 season both sides were promoted.\n\nAlan Mullery's outspoken-ness continued to fan the flames of a rivalry that often violently spilled over into the alleyways, railway stations and park areas of Brighton and Hove and, on more than one occasion, the side-streets and shops of Croydon. It was rumoured that he was motivated by jealousy having wanted the Palace managerial job himself. He decided to change the Club nick-name once again, this time to \"The Seagulls\"\n\nThe 1978-79 season saw Palace, Brighton, Stoke and Sunderland all slog out a nail-biting promotion race. On the last Saturday of the season, Brighton, Stoke and Sunderland had finished their seasons, Brighton ended up top on goal difference, Stoke and Sunderland provisionally claimed second and third, but Palace still had a game in hand - win it and Palace were Champions, displacing Brighton, lose and Palace would miss out on promotion completely, on goal difference.\n\nOn the 11th May 1979 Palace defeated Burnley 2-0 in front of a record 51,801 people at Selhurst Park, and in doing so Palace snatched the Second Division Championship title away from Brighton.\n\nThe news was broken to the Brighton players at 30,000 feet whilst on route to play in a tournament in the US. That wasn't the only bad news they were receive that day, when they landed they found the tournament had been scrapped, due to a fuel crisis!\n\nThe next season saw both clubs in the First Division, Brighton for the first time in their history. To cope with the larger crowds that top-flight football brings, Brighton erected the naffest temporary grandstand of all time on one side. Even their own fans nicknamed it 'The Lego stand'. Palace fans quickly coined the phrase and the Goldstone Ground became known as 'Legoland.'\n\nLater that season, fire swept through the South Stand, gutting the seats and wooden structure. An act which many local fans pointing the finger at Palace fans, who lived in the area! On the field, both sides held onto their First division status.\n\nThe following season Palace were relegated but Brighton went on escaping relegation for another two seasons, band managed a Cup Final appearance in their last season in the top flight.\n\nIn November 1981 Palace played a 'friendly' against Brighton and came away with a credible 1-1 draw adminst another management upheaval at the club as Dario Gradi made way for Steve Kember. Then in a enormously unpopular move, Ron Noades appointed Alan Mullery as manager. Palace fans couldn't not swallow this and deserted the Club in large numbers, whilst some drifted back slowly over the years - plenty never came back at all. One of Mullery's first games in charge was a home 'friendly' against Brighton, which Palace managed to win by a single goal.\n\nPalace renewed acquaintance with Brighton again in the 1983-84 season, the second year of Mullery's two years. The now traditional Christmas and Easter games saw Mullery stick the dagger even further into mortally wounded Palace hearts, yes, he let them get away with all six points again. This were the nadir of recent Palace history and the serious violence that followed the April trip to the Goldstone served only to counterpoint the frustrations.\n\nMullery slipped away quietly to Q.P.R. after two relegation struggles, giving way to managerial new boy Steve Coppell. His first season saw an early South Coast encounter end in 1-0 defeat, but the home game saw a Trevor Aylott goal ensure a deserved draw. The game was surrounded by controversy with Palace defender Henry Hughton sent off for a late tackle on Brighton winger Gerry Ryan, who sustained a badly broken leg, which ultimately ended his playing career. The Brighton Manager Chris Cattlin claimed in the press it was the worst tackle he'd ever seen, but Ryan himself refused to condemn Hughton.\n\nIn the 1985-86 season Palace lost at Brighton on New Year's Day, a game mainly remembered by Palace fans for a scandalous dive by Terry Connor which earned Brighton a penalty. Late in March, Palace managed to chalk up a narrow league victory against their rivals in the reverse fixture.\n\nLater that year in another bizarre twist of fate surrounding the two clubs, Brighton re-appointed the 'Prince of Darkness' Allan Mullery OBE as their new manager.\n\nThe following season, Palace fans saw this as their chance for revenge on Mullery in the Boxing Day fixture of 1986. The players duly obliged as Palace beat their rivals and relegation strugglers. By Easter Monday, Barry Lloyd was in charge of a Brighton side that had not won a League game for three months.........enter Palace, chasing a 'play-off' place, but on the day they somehow contrived to lose 2-0 to a woeful Brighton side, that were up for this fixture and ultimately this result helped end Palace's play-off hopes for that season.\n\nThe mood of the Palace fans was not pleasant, angry at the scoreline and fed up at being so tightly packed onto a tiny corner terrace, when the Brighton fans had the run of the open East Terrace. With ten minutes left, a sizeable number stormed out of the terrace, to confront Brighton fans in their own end. The ensuing violence spilled out of the ground into Phoenix Park which played host to several running battles before The Sussex Constabulary eventually brought order to the seaside town.\n\nThere was some consolation for Palace that the result did nothing to assist Brighton's survival. They ended up getting relegated, thanks in the main to the ministrations of their one-time idol, Alan Mulllery.\n\nTwo seasons later and Brighton were back in Division Two. Palace lost at Brighton in another Boxing Day encounter in 1988, but the return fixture on the 27th March 1989 still holds a place in the English League record books thanks to a certain referee named Kelvin Morton. Morton awarded five penalties, Palace were given four of those five and incredibly managed to miss three of them - but Palace still won the game 2-1! Morton also sent off Brighton midfielder Mike Trusson in the first-half.\n\nThat season Palace were promoted to Division One via the play-offs, whilst Brighton finished 19th.\n\nHowever, the two did not play in a league encounter between 1990 and 2001, although there were have been a number of 'pre-season friendlies' staged between the sides, all at Brighton!\n\nThe first in August 1992, saw an injury-struck Palace side once more deliver a below par performance, although still managing to win 1-0. This game was originally scheduled for a Saturday afternoon, when it would have attracted a much larger crowd, but was eventually played on Friday night. Possibly the only friendly fixture ever to have been moved on Police advice!\n\nAfter the game, however, it was Palace fans getting back on the train who were subjected to a CS gas attack at Hove station.\n\nThat season ended with Palace's relegation from the Premier League, whilst Brighton having survived a number of High Court actions maintained their Division Two status.\n\nIn August 1993, a second 'friendly' took place, the game was to have been a testimonial match for Palace player Gary O'Reilly, but a row about gate receipts scuppered that. Once again, some Palace fans were subjected to another tear gas attack, this time before the game in a pub. Just for a change, Palace really turned on the style on the pitch. A 2,000-strong Palace posse of supporters saw Palace score three times without reply. A performance that underlined the major difference in class that now existed between the sides.\n\nThe 2000-01 season saw Brighton, under the stewardship of Mickey Adams, promoted out of Division Three as Champions, Palace on the other hand, had a shockingly bad season and coming into the final week of that season they were firmly ensconced in the relegation zone.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday 6th May 2001, Brighton paraded their Division Three Championship trophy through the streets of Brighton, and afterwards their supporters settled in pubs everywhere to watch Palace get relegated to Division Two, thereby setting up two mouth-watering encounters. For 87 minutes, the party was in full swing, then Dougie Freedman worked his magic and his epic late winner at Stockport sent the South London fans' delirious and the Brighton fans were left inconsolable!\n\nCrystal Palace beat the drop - 2000/2001 season\n\nThe following season, despite losing manager Mickey Adams to Leicester, Brighton appointed former Palace legend Peter Taylor as manager. Taylor helped Brighton get promoted as Champions, thereby setting up two more spicy Brighton versus Palace derby matches for the forthcoming season, before he walked out on them. Another ex-Palace player, Martin Hinshelwood was appointed the new manager.\n\nSo 2002 saw the return of Brighton to the second tier but they started the season poorly and Hinshelwood was kicked upstairs, and then the unthinkable happened - they went and appointed Steve Coppell, the former Palace manager as their new boss a couple of weeks before Palace hosted the South Coast side at Selhurst Park!\n\nOn 26th October 2002 Palace thrashed them 5–0 in a memorable game, with Palace striker Andy Johnson scoring a hat-trick. That date and scoreline is etched in Palace history forever!\n\nThe return fixture, the following March was a dull affair, the game ended 0-0 with Palace full-back Danny Granville getting himself sent off, but endearing himself to the Palace faithful by telling the jeering Brighton fans near the tunnel to \"f*ck off\".\n\nBrighton were relegated that season, making Steve Coppell an even bigger cult hero at Palace, for taking their bitter rivals down a division, while Palace finished the season mid-table.\n\nBrighton bounced straight back through the play-offs into Division One in 2003-04, only to find Palace had already left the Division by the gentleman's exit, promoted into the Premiership via the play-offs.\n\nPalace got themselves relegated from the Premiership straight away, whilst Brighton managed to take it right to the last day of the season before narrowly ensuring their survival in 2004-05.\n\nBrighton gained revenge in 2005 with a 1–0 win at Selhurst Park, however, a month later at the Withdean, Palace twice came from behind, with Dougie Freedman scoring his 100th and 101st goals for Palace and Jobi McAnuff scoring in the very last minute to win the game 3–2.\n\nBrighton lose to Crystal Palace in a thriller on the 20/11/2005\n\nDespite Brighton and Palace sharing the spoils in the 2005-06 season, Brighton were relegated, finishing bottom of the table, winning just 7 of their 46 league games. Palace finished 6th but lost in the play-offs to Watford. Brighton then spent the next five seasons in League One, before finally winning promotion back to The Championship.\n\nHowever both Clubs and both sets of fans are in a much better place now than they were several years ago. A lot has happened and a lot has changed for the good.\n\nBrighton were promoted as League One champions in 2010-11 and have former Chelsea, Spurs and Uruguay international Gus Poyet as boss. On 31st May 2011 they moved from their temporary home at the Withdean Stadium, (which was not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a zoo), to a shiny new 27,000 all-seater stadium, sponsored by AMEX, situated just outside Brighton in Falmer. They finished last season in a respectable 10th place in their first season back in the second of English football, and they currently lie just outside a play-off spot this season.\n\nMeanwhile Crystal Palace survived administration in 2010 and two successive relegation battles in 2009-10 and 2010-11 before steadying the ship last season, as they comfortably maintained their place in The Championship and also reached the League Cup semi-final. With the current owners in place, and Ian Holloway at the helm, the club are finally on sound financial footing, and in Holloway, they have one of the most passionate, charismatic and determined managers in the league. They have exceeded expectations on the field so far this season and currently lie 4th in the table, three points off a top two place, and have a support base, particularly on the road, that is the envy of many fellow Championship clubs.\n\nSo the 27th September 2011 saw the two rival teams meet for the first time since November 2005. Brighton newly promoted had started the season well, Palace steady if un"
