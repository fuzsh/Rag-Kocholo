        "text": "To the disappointment of British tennis fans, Wimbledon is now over for another year.\n\nWhilst the women’s and men’s final stole the show on the final weekend of the tournament, there were plenty of other trophies being handed out to deserving winners right around the famous grounds of SW19.\n\nAnd as is customary, the victorious players all gathered together for the Wimbledon Champions Dinner at the All England Club on Sunday evening.\n\nLet’s take a look at the full list of winners from this year’s Championships.\n\nWimbledon 2023 winners\n\nCarlos Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in an epic five set duel to clinch his second Grand Slam title following on from his US Open triumph last year.\n\nThe 1-6, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 win saw Alcaraz, 20, became the third-youngest man to lift the Wimbledon trophy after Boris Becker and Björn Borg.\n\nIt was the first time that Djokovic, who remains on 23 Grand Slams, had tasted defeat on Centre Court since losing to Andy Murray in the final ten years ago.\n\nThe men’s final took place a day after the women’s showpiece, which saw Czechia’s Marketa Vondrousova pick up her maiden Grand Slam title with victory over Ons Jabeur, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nVondrousova became the first unseeded women to win Wimbledon whilst Jabeur broke down in tears after suffering her second defeat in the final in as many years.\n\nElsewhere, Henry Searle became the first British junior to win the boys’ title at Wimbledon since Stanley Matthews, son of the legendary former footballer, in 1962.\n\nThe 17 year-old from Wolverhampton beat fifth seed Yaroslav Demin 6-4, 6-4 on Court 1 on the final day of the Championships.\n\nThe British pair of Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid won their fifth Wimbledon wheelchairs doubles title – and their 18th Grand Slam together, with a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over Japan’s Takuya Miki and Tokito Oda.\n\nHowever, there was to be no repeat in the wheelchair singles final for Hewett, who was beaten by Oda, 6-4, 6-2, having also lost in the final 12 months ago.\n\nThe Wimbledon singles title remains the only one missing from Hewett’s CV which features seven Grand Slam trophies across the other three majors.\n\nAnd there was yet more success for the Brits, with Neal Skupski winning his first Grand Slam men’s doubles title alongside Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof.\n\nThe top seeds got the better of Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos, 6-4, 6-4 on Centre Court.\n\nMORE : Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz vows to avoid Roger Federer mistake\n\nMORE : Novak Djokovic labelled a ‘villain’ by former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram"
