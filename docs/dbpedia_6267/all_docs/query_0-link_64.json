Word has it the broadcast booth at the Stadium will be named in his honor. A plaque in monument park commemorating his 35 years of service is also expected.\n\n“King Charles” has been dethroned. The new weekly CNN show featuring Charles Barkley and Gayle King which attempted to mix sports and politics was cancelled due to poor ratings.\n\nJack Edwards, longtime Boston Bruins play-by-play man, is retiring after this postseason.\n\nInteresting point raised by WNBA great Sue Bird during a recent interview on “Real Ones.” Bird took issue with sports networks like ESPN for not offering more broadcasting opportunities and financial stability to competent women sportscasters like Monica McNutt and Andraya Carter which would allow them to continue covering the WNBA instead of moving over to the NBA. It seems like once these women announcers make a name for themselves, they are pushed over to the NBA where there are more broadcasting opportunities and more money to be earned.\n\nSpeaking of women sportscasters, congratulations to Amina Smith, who made her SportsCenter debut on April 5th. Smith is a former track athlete at the University of South Carolina who cut her teeth at NBC Sports Boston before getting the call to Bristol.\n\nBest wishes to Hannah Storm, who revealed to \"Good Morning America's\" Robin Roberts that she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. Thankfully, it was detected early and after a successful surgery the ESPN sportscaster is now cancer free.\n\nEli Gold has already landed two new assignments after parting ways with Alabama after 35 years as their football voice.

Costas was joined by ABA legends Spencer Haywood, Artis Gilmore, “Dr. J” Julius Erving and Darnell Hillman as they reminisced about their experiences in the flashy, freewheeling league known for its up tempo style of play, 3-point shot and slam dunk contest, all of which came over to the NBA after the two leagues merged in 1976. Costas is no stranger to the ABA, having joined the league’s Spirits of St. Louis fresh out of Syracuse University in 1974 and spending two years as their play-by-play man until the merger.\n\n.ESPN play-by-play announcer Dave Pasch had some fun at the expense of his partner, ASA Board member Bill Walton during a recent college basketball telecast. As Oregon was blowing out USC on Febraury 1, Pasch mentioned that he heard the basketball Hall of Famer had auditioned for the role of Chebacca in the original Star Wars movie. After sidestepping the question, Walton finally made the admisison. “I did audition for the role of Chewbacca but they said no,” Walton said. “But they said they were going to model the character after me.” What a long strange trip it’s been for Walton.\n\nKudos to ASA Lifetime Member Joe Buck and his ESPN Monday Night Football partner, Troy Aikman, for being named the top NFL broadcast team for 2023 by Awful Announcing. The website received over 18,000 votes from its readers and came up with a list of this past season’s top 17 NFL announcing teams. Coming in a close second was ASA member Ian Eagle and his CBS partner, Charles Davis. Rounding out the top five was the CBS broadcast team of Kevin Harlan and Trent Green (3), Fox’s Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen (4), and the NBC Sunday Night Football duo of Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth (5).\n\nBob Costas, sportscasting great and winner of 28 sports emmy awards joined award winning actor and comedian Billy Crystal at Madison Square Garden to take in the Knicks -Heat game on January 27.

This year will mark his 53rd season with Milwaukee, the fourth longest tenure with one team in MLB history.\n\nWith Amazon Prime's acquisition of Thursday Night Football broadcasts beginning with the 2022-23 season, broadcasting legend and ASA Member Al Michaels has already emerged as the streaming services' top choice to handle the play-by-play. Michaels, 76, is in his final year of his contract with NBC which culminates with the broadcast of the Super Bowl. Amazon's short list also includes Fox's top announcer and ASA Member Joe Buck as well as CBS' veteran play-by-player and ASA Advisory Board Member Ian Eagle.\n\nESPN has signed Leah Hextall to do NHL play-by-play and other roles, making her the first woman play-by-player to be a regular part of a national NHL TV package.

He went on to become the Voice of the Knicks from 1967 to 2004.\n\nAlbert, who will turn 80 in June, has covered everything from football and boxing to hockey, baseball and tennis. But his signature voice is most associated with basketball, whether it be with the Knicks, the NBA on NBC, the New Jersey Nets, or his current role on the NBA on TNT. He has also called 13 NBA Finals and 25 All-Star Games for NBC and Turner, along with the Dream Team's romp to the gold medal in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.\n\nKnown for his signature call, \"Yes!,\" Albert was voted the ASA's \"Sportscaster of the Year\" in 1996 and received the Basketball Hall of Fa me's Curt Gowdy Media Award a year later.\n\nBill Worrell, ASA LIfetime Member retired as the Houston Rockets television play-by-play broadcaster following Houston’s final home game of the season on May 14.

Team and network announcers will in fact call games live from Orlando when the season resumes July 31st. One broadcasting legend, however, will not be there. ASA Advisory Board Member Marv Albert has decided not take part as the sunshine state’s COVID-19 cases have been skyrocketing and the 79-year-old feels it is too risky.\n\nThe PGA Tour returns to CBS this weekend, albeit with social distancing rules in place.

According to reports, ESPN “will attempt to acquire” legendary voice of NBC’s \"Sunday Night Football,\" Al Michaels. The dream scenario would be to pair the longtime ASA member with former Colts and Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who is also on ESPN’s wish list now that Tony Romo has agreed to a whopping 10-year, $180 million contract to stay at CBS. ESPN was eager to sign the former Cowboys quarterback for its MNF telecasts but CBS didn’t give them a chance by offering the popular analyst this monumental deal, making him the highest paid analyst in television history.\n\nIn honor of International Women’s Day, an all-female crew will broadcast and produce the Blues-Blackhawks game to be aired on NBCSN on March 8.

Smoltz, who qualified for the tournament back in May, was ecstatic when he informed his Fox baseball broadcasting partner that he had made the cut. “He called me on his way out of the golf course and he sounded like a 10-year-old boy,” Buck said. “I have never in my life seen or heard a guy that giddy, especially a guy who has won a World Series, is in the Hall of Fame, stared down the most intense sporting situations and won. It will be interesting to see how Fox handles the coverage of one of its announcers. Smoltz said he would be willing to wear a microphone but doesn’t want to turn his accomplishment into some kind of network stunt.\n\nJoe Buck and Troy Aikman, Fox's No. 1 NFL team now in their 17th year together, have been slated to call the \"Thursday Night Football\" matchups in addition to most of the Sunday games. The news came during the annual upfront week, where television networks show off their slate of fall programs, which took place the week of May 13. Fox has owned the rights to televise Sunday afternoon NFL games since 1994, and they have added to that portfolio by investing $3.3 billion for exclusive rights to televise Thursday night games for the next five years.\n\nFox will also be broadcasting the 2018 World Cup from Russia this summer, albeit without Team USA who didn't make the cut. Alexi Lalas will be the lead analyst.\n\nESPN revealed at its upfront presentation that Alex Rodriguez will be hosting an interview show this fall.\n\nAfter ESPN was unable to convince Peyton Manning to join the \"Monday Night Football\" broadcast booth, it appears that the network has successfully lured future Hall of Famer Jason Witten into retirement to become the next MNF analyst. Rumors began swirling last week that Witten, an 11-time pro bowler with the Dallas Cowboys, was contemplating hanging up his helmet to join the \"World Wide Leader in Sports\" but wanted to meet with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones before making a final decision. Well, it seems like that decision has now been made and Witten will be joining new play-by-play man Joe Tessitore in the MNF booth come September.\n\nAfter a farewell tour that seemed like a lifetime, Mike Francesa will be returning to the WFAN Radio airwaves just four months after what we thought was his final goodbye. WFAN has not confirmed his return but just that \"they are in ongoing discussions.\" Francesa's final show was on December 15, 2017 where he was showered with praise and well wishes from tons of past and present colleagues, as well as sports figures and celebrities. At the time he said we wasn't retiring, but that after 30 years, it was time for a change. Apparently, he was unable to find another opportunity to fit his liking and salary requirement, so he's returning to his old stomping grounds. Francesa was replaced by the trio of Chris Carlin, Maggie Gray and Bart Scott (aka CMB) but with them losing to ESPN in the ratings since his departure, the station will surely welcome his return. Nothing has been confirmed but it looks as though CMB will air from 1-3pm and Francesa will take the reigns until Yankee baseball at 6:30pm. Stay tuned.\n\nWith the first round of the NBA playoffs getting underway, TNT/NBA TV have six broadcasting teams scheduled to cover the action. They include: Marv Albert and Chris Webber; Kevin Harlan and Reggie Miller; Brian Anderson and Kevin McHale; Ian Eagle and Brent Barry; Spero Dedes and Mike Fratello; and Pete Pranica and Greg Anthony.\n\nWithin hours of the New York Mets' home opener, one of their beloved former players passed away. Rusty Staub, the red-haired All-Star slugger who spent seven of his 23 years in the majors with the Mets, died in a West Palm Beach hospital after a long illness. He was 73. A visibly emotional Keith Hernandez a former teammate and close friend of Staub's, spoke at a press conference today where he said the fan favorite was \"in a lot of pain\" and \"is now in a better place.\" After his retirement in 1985, Staub became a Mets announcer on WWOR-TV Ch. 9, a position he held for 10 years. Staub was also revered for his philanthropic efforts. Through his Rusty Staub Foundation, founded in 1986, he raised millions of dollars for the families of New York City policemen and firefighters who were killed in the line of duty as well as those who lost their lives in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nJim Nantz is gearing up to call his 28th consecutive Final Four on CBS on Saturday, March 31, from the Alamo Dome in San Antonio, TX, with partners Bill Raftery and Grant Hill. Raftery, who has been covering college hoops on CBS for over 33 years, is working his fifth Final Four telecast after many years on the Westwood One Radio broadcasts.\n\nFor the first time in 26 years, Brad Nessler is calling an NCAA Tournament for CBS Sports. Nessler, who last worked a tournament game in 1992 during his first stint with CBS before moving to ESPN, will be filling in for Verne Lundquist, who is recovering from back surgery.\n\nPeyton Manning is hot commodity right now and Fox is determined to land the future Hall of Fame quarterback for its newly acquired \"Thursday Night Football\" package. So much so that the network is considering trying to work a deal with NBC that would allow Manning's longtime friend Mike Tirico to do the play-by-play.\n\nIf you tune into Boston’s WEEI Radio tomorrow, chances are you won’t be hearing any inappropriate remarks from some of their talk show hosts. In fact, you wont be hearing anything because the station has suspended all live programming on Friday, February 16, from 6am-6pm for a mandatory sensitivity training class for all its on-air personalities. After recent incidents like host Christian Fauria doing a racist imitation of Tom Brady’s agent, Don Yee, and Alex Reimer calling Brady’s daughter “an annoying little pissant,” the station has heard and seen enough. Hopefully these guys will be taking a lot of notes.\n\nMerrill Reese, ASA member and the longest tenured play-by-play broadcaster in the NFL, finally got his chance to call an Eagles' Super Bowl victory. As Super Bowl 52 came to an end with the Eagles ahead, 41-33, Reese, the Eagles' radio announcer since 1977, jubilantly exclaimed on WIP Radio, “The Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl champions! Eagles fans everywhere, this is for you! Let the celebration begin!”\n\nWith the retirement of Mike Francesa and the firing of Craig Carton, there will be a lot of new voices on WFAN Radio come January 2, 2018. The “Boomer and Gio show will make its debut, with Boomer Esiason and new co-host Greg Giannotti, who replaces Carton, and air from 6am-10am. Regulars Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts will follow until 2pm before the debut of “The Afternoon Drive with Chris Carlin, Bart Scott and Maggie Gray,” which will attempt to fill the void of Francesa, who has been an afternoon drive institution at the station for the last 30 years.\n\nThe ESPN Sunday Night Baseball just lost another announcer with the news that analyst Aaron Boone will become the next manager of the New York Yankees. ASA member Dan Shulman has already vacated his post as play-by-play announcer, so that leaves Jessica Mendoza as the last woman standing.\n\nWhile Eli Manning's future as a player with the NY Giants is uncertain after being benched by the team earlier this week, the possibility of a broadcasting career might be on the horizon. According to a story by TMZ, legendary announcer and ASA member Al Michaels and CBS CEO Les Moonves both gave ringing endorsements of Manning while leaving an LA restaurant. When asked if Manning could end up at CBS, Moonves said, \"We'd take him in a second.\" Michaels agreed and praised Manning's character. \"He's all class, Michaels said. \"Eli will have a future in a lot of places, wherever he wants.”\n\nJoe Morgan, ASA Member and Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famer, feels that steroid users do not belong in the Hall of Fame. And he made it perfectly clear with the letter that he sent on November 21st to the 430 members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), who will soon vote on the 2018 Hall of Fame class. “Players who failed drug tests, admitted using steroids, or were identified as users in Major League Baseball’s investigation into steroid abuse, known as the Mitchell Report, should not get in,” Morgan wrote. “Those are the three criteria that many of the [Hall of Fame] players and I think are right.” Morgan noted, “Please keep in mind I don’t speak for every single member of the Hall of Fame,” though he added, “I do know how many of the Hall of Famers feel.\" This comes after last year's vote saw suspected PED users Roger Clemens and Barry Bonds receive over 50% of the 75% of the votes needed for election.\n\nThings got emotional at ESPN Radio as Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, hosts of \"Mike and Mike\" signed off for the final time on November 17 after 17 years together. Both hosts summoned their families to the set and thanked them and the fans for remaining loyal listeners for nearly two decades. Golic will continue the 6-10 am morning show with new co-host Trey Wingo and Greenberg is gearing up for his own ESPN cable show, \"Get Up,\" which premieres April 2, 2018.\n\nAfter much speculation as to who would become Mike Francesa's replacement at WFAN Radio, the station announced that the trio of Chris Carlin, Bart Scott and Maggie Gray would be taking over as the new hosts of 1-6pm afternoon drive show. Carlin is a former WFAN producer and host on WIP Radio in Philadelphia. Scott comes over from ESPN Radio and also had a stint on CBS' The NFL Today and Gray has worked for MSG Network and Sports Illustrated. Francesa, one of the pioneers of sports talk radio for 30 years, paired with Chris Mad Dog Russo on \"Mike and the Mad Dog\" from 1989-2008 and then hosted the afternoon show on his own. His last show will be December 15.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are in the World Series for the first time since 1988 and the buzz for Vin Scully to take part in the Fall Classic is beginning to pick up steam. However, Scully, who called that World Series 29 years ago which was punctuated by Kirk Gibson's walk off home run, said he will not participate. \"I honestly don’t feel I belong there and I would not want anyone to think I was eager for a spotlight,” Scully said. Joe Buck, who will be handling the play-by-play on Fox is even hoping to share the booth with the sportscasting legend. “I swear on my late father, to have Vin come do some of the series with us and in my place would be an honor,\" Buck said. \"If someone can hypnotize him and make him say ‘yes,’ I will drive and pick him up myself. He knows I feel this way, as does Fox and he continues to say no, unfortunately.” Anyone know a good hypnotist in LA?\n\nStephanie Ready made history in 2015 when she became the first female to work as a full-time game analyst for an NBA team. Unfortunately, she has been demoted to sideline reporter, which has upset many Charlotte Hornets fans, not to mention those of us at the ASA who would like to see continued progress for women in the sportscasting field. Fox Sports Southeast defended the move by saying they need a presence down on the sideline. But couldn't they have hired a new sideline reporter?\n\n“Cousin Ness.”It has a nice ring to it. That’s what Brad Nessler jokingly dubbed himself when talking about taking over for Verne Lundquist, affectionately known as “Uncle Verne,” on CBS’ coverage of SEC football this fall. Nessler hopes that fans will welcome him with open arms, and why not, the Lifetime ASA member has 20 years of college football under his belt at ABC and ESPN. He will also be reuniting with one of his former ABC partners, Gary Danielson. “If you told me pick a guy who’s most like Verne’s style out there, I’d choose Brad even if I didn’t know him,” Danielson said. “He’s a minimalist as a broadcaster. I think it’ll be a little different. Brad will be a little more aggressive in seeking out information, but I think both styles are great.”\n\nKudos to James Brown, veteran host of “The NFL Today” on CBS, who has lost a whopping 74 pounds since October of 2016. Brown, who received motivation from his former Fox colleague Howie Long, is down to 218 pounds. The ASA member and devout Christian said the principal reason for his transformation was that “I want to be a strong vessel for the Lord.”\n\n7/12/17 - It’s “Jimmy V Day” today, a special day at ESPN to commemorate the life and legacy of legendary NC State coach Jim Valvano, who died of cancer in 1993. Donations are being collected all day long across all platforms with 100% of the monetary donations going to the Jimmy V Foundation for Cancer Research. There are also many once in a lifetime experiences that you can bid on at ebay.com, like 4 tickets to a Yankee game which includes a visit with announcer Michael Kay in the broadcast booth. Valvano received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the inaugural ESPY Awards in 1993. His touching and heartfelt speech included his famous quote, “Don’t Give up...Don’t ever Give up.” Speaking of the ESPYS, it’s hard to believe the 25th anniversary event will take place tonight with former NFL great Peyton Manning serving as host. Along with the many awards to be given for the top performances in all sports from the past year, legendary L.A. Dodgers announcer and ASA Hall of Famer Vin Scully will be receiving the ESPYS Icon Award.\n\nLee Corso, longtime ESPN “College Game Day” anchor, has signed a multi-year deal with the network.

Known as “The Professor,” Clayton was a well respected senior NFL writer and commentator for 23 years.\n\nAlex Rodriguez, former NY Yankees slugger, has signed a deal with ABC News. Yes, you read that right. A-Rod will actually be appearing on shows like “Good Morning America,” “World News Tonight” and “Nightline” doing pieces on lifestyle, family and even finance. You won’t see Rodriguez on ESPN though, as he is still under contract with Fox as an MLB analyst.\n\nJaime Jarrin, Spanish voice of the LA Dodgers for an incredible 58 years, was recently featured on HBO’s \"Real Sports\" with Bryant Gumbel. During the segment, it was revealed that during Jarrin's first six years with the Dodgers beginning in 1959, he wouldn't accompany the team on road trips. So he would call the away games by listening to the English broadcast of iconic Dodgers voice Vin Scully and immediately translating it into Spanish. As a favor to his friend Jarrin, Scully would make a habit of providing added information like the weather or the field conditions so that Jarrin could incorporate it into his broadcast.\n\nAwesome Baby! ESPN has added another year to longtime ASA member Dick Vitale's contract which will take college basketball guru through the 2019-2020 season, marking his 41st year in Bristol.\n\nSeth Greenberg, versatile ESPN announcer, signed a multi-year extension with the network. Greenberg will continue to provide college basketball analysis as well as appear on various ESPN platforms, including SportsCenter and ESPN Radio programming.\n\nNate Burleson is the newest member of \"The NFL Today\" studio show on CBS.

The former wide receiver will continue to host \"Good Morning Football\" on the NFL Network.\n\n“The Bus” will be leaving the depot. That’s according to a report by The Sporting News that names Jerome Bettis as one of the 100 on-air personalities and writers who were laid off by ESPN.

Bettis has not confirmed his dismissal via social media or any other outlet.\n\nIt was BTIG Charity Day in New York City on May 2nd as some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment took part in the global investment firm's annual fund raising event.

Also in attendance were sports legends Derek Jeter, Warren Moon, Ralph Sampson and Darryl Strawberry.\n\nPhil Simms, former No.1 NFL analyst on CBS, will be moving into the studio as a member of \"The NFL Today.\" Simms, who was replaced by Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo on CBS' top broadcast team, will fill the spot recently vacated by Tony Gonzalez. The former New York Giants quarterback, speaking for the first time since he was replaced, said initially the move was a blow to his pride. But he is now looking forward to his new role in the studio which gives him the opportunity to follow and comment on all the games each week, not just the one he would normally cover.\n\nSteve Albert, longtime broadcaster best known as the voice of Showtime Boxing, is retiring after a 45-year career. Steve, who is Marv Albert's younger brother, has been the TV play-by-play voice of the Phoenix Suns for the last five years. He also called games for the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers and New Jersey Nets, and served as a TV sports anchor for WCBS, WNBC and WWOR in New York. From 1992-2009, Albert was at ringside for many of boxing's greatest bouts on Showtime, including the infamous Tyson-Holyfield fight where \"Iron Mike\" took a chunk out of Holyfield’s ear.\n\nIt’s been 30 years since a woman has called an NFL regular season game but that could change come next season. ESPN has been toying with the notion of letting Beth Mowins call the late night “Monday Night Football” season opener. Mowins, primarily a play-by-play announcer for women’s sports, has already done some men’s college football and Raiders preseason games. You have to go back to 1987 when Gayle Sierens, a sports reporter turned news anchor for WFLA, an NBC affiliate in Tampa,called the regional regular season finale between the Seattle Seahawks and the Kansas City Chiefs on NBC. The peacock network had her slated to do six more games but WFLA asked her not to pursue any more play-by-play opportunities. Sierens continued to serve as the top news anchor at the Tampa station until her retirement in 2015. She would later say that “I kicked down the door, but no one else came in.” It might be time for Mowins to finally follow in Sierens’ footsteps. Mowins would actually be one up on Sierens, as this would be a national game, making her the first female to accomplish that feat.\n\nTony Gonzalez had decided to leave CBS’ “The NFL Today” pre-game show after three years. The Hall of Fame tight end says he wants to stay in broadcasting but would like find employment on the West Coast where he could be closer to his family. Possible landing spots would be California based Fox Sports or the NFL network.\n\nAccording to ESPN insider Jim Miller, approximately 40-50 of ESPN’s on-air staff will be receiving their walking papers as “The Worldwide Leader in Sports” looks to cut its expenses.

The former head coach of the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills will be primarily featured on \"Sunday NFL Countdown.\"\n\nOddly enough, it's been 22 years since a woman has served as an analyst on an NCAA men's basketball tournament broadcast (ASA member Ann Meyers Drysdale called two rounds back in 1995). That's about to change with the news that longtime sideline reporter Debbie Antonelli will provide color commentary during this year's tourney on CBS.\n\nBill Webb, legendary television director known for his work with the Fox Sports and the New York Mets, died on March 7 after a lengthy battle with cancer. He was 70. During his career, Webb directed 18 World Series, 20 League Championship Series and 18 MLB All-Star Games. Joe Buck, who worked with Webb from 1996 - 2014, told Newsday in 2015 that more than anyone, Webb was responsible for the look of baseball on Fox Sports. Webb, who earned 40 Emmy nominations in his career, also called the shots for New York Mets games since 1979, most recently on SNY.\n\nAfter serving as a part-time post-season analyst on Fox for the last several years, Alex Rodriguez has been hired by the network on a full-time basis. As part of his multi-year agreement, the former Yankees slugger will continue to work in the studio, but he will also take on a new challenge, color commentary in the broadcast booth. His responsibilities will also include participating in FS1's new show \"MLB Whiparound.\"\n\nMike Francesa, veteran WFAN Radio talk show host, has received some backlash regarding his recent comments that you probably won't see a woman head coach in a major professional male sport. The afternoon drive host continued to stand by his words during his March 6th show, saying it would be \"a tall building to climb,\"for a woman to coach in football, baseball or hockey, but he did say that basketball is a possibility because of avenues like the WNBA and women's college basketball. Francesa feels his comments shouldn't categorize him as a \"chauvinist\" or from the \"stone age\" as many are saying.\n\nDoug Adler, ESPN tennis commentator who was fired after using the word \"guerilla\" during a Venus Williams match, says the heart attack he suffered on February 28 was a result from the stress he has suffered because of the incident. Adler, who says he has been labeled a racist by many who feel he was referring to Williams as a \"gorilla\"during his call of the Australian Open, is suing the network for wrongful termination.\n\nLesley Visser, ASA Advisory Board Member and a trailblazer in women's sports journalism, was named a Lombardi Fellow at the 47th annual Vince Lombardi Honors. Just as Lombardi faced discrimination for being an Italian-American in the 1950s and 60s, Visser faced discrimination as a female in a male dominated field. However, it didn't stop her from becoming one of the top sports journalists who eventually would become the only woman to present the Lombardi Trophy at the Super Bowl and the only woman to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nMark Grace, one of the most popular personalities in Arizona Diamondbacks history, is returning to broadcasting as a pre- and post-game analyst on Fox Sports Arizona.

Steve Berthiaume and Bob Brenly will once again handle play-by-play and color commentary duties, respectively.\n\nESPN has signed former New York Yankees All-Star Mark Teixeira to a multi-year agreement.

Esiason recorded his 17th radio call during the Patriots stunning come from behind win over the Falcons, 34-28, alongside play-by-play man Kevin Harlan. Along the way, Esiason has also worked with Howard David and broadcasting great Marv Albert. Stram was at the microphone for 16 Super Bowls, all with ASA Hall of Famer Jack Buck. It was also the 30th Super Bowl that Westwood One has aired. ON the TV side, the game drew approximately 111 million viewers, down from the past two years\n\nMike Francesa, WFAN Radio afternoon drive show host who is broadcasting live from Houston all week, site of Super Bowl LI, figures there's approximately 250 radio stations that have also set up shop there in anticipation of one of the world's biggest sporting events. That's a far cry from the late 1980's when Francesa recalled his station was one of the few, if not the only, to broadcast live from the Super Bowl.\n\nLeBron James has had just about enough of Charles Barkley. After the TNT broadcaster called King James \"whiney\" for his recent comments that his Cavs team needs to fortify their roster if they want to compete for another title, James fired back hard at the \"Round Mound of Rebound.\" \"I'm not going to let him disrespect my legacy like that,\" James told ESPN. \"I'm not the one who threw somebody through a window. I never spit on a kid. I never had unpaid debt in Las Vegas. I never said, 'I'm not a role model.' I never showed up to All-Star Weekend on Sunday because I was in Vegas all weekend partying. All I've done for my entire career is represent the NBA the right way. Fourteen years, never got in trouble. Respected the game. Print that.\" Wow. This could get interesting.\n\nThe NFL released its TV viewership numbers for 2016 and it seems the average fan is tuning in 155 minutes less than they did a year ago. This has gotten the league a little concerned and one area they will look into that might be causing the decrease is poorly placed and extended commercial breaks throughout the games.\n\nJohn Lynch, former All-Pro defensive back and Fox announcer, will be leaving the broadcast booth to become the next general manager of the San Francisco 49ers, a move that has many shaking their heads due to Lynch's lack of front office experience.\n\nBrent Musberger, a national TV voice for over 40 years currently with ESPN and the SEC Network, announced that he will be retiring effective January 31st following his call of the Georgia-Kentucky college basketball game on ESPN. Musberger, one of the most recognizable figures in sports television, began his career on local television in 1968 and joined CBS Sports in 1973. He rose to prominence as the host of CBS’ “The NFL Today” and became the network’s top sportscaster covering all the major events including the NBA Finals, NCAA Final Four and the Belmont Stakes. He parted ways with CBS in 1990 and moved to ABC and later ESPN where he has covered a myriad of events including the Rose Bowl, the World Cup, the Indianapolis 500 and the BCS National Championship game.\n\nChris Berman and Tom Jackson, who hosted ESPN's \"Sunday NFL Countdown\" together for nearly 30 years, had the studio named in their honor.

It turns out, Sager has been betting on the Cubs to win the World Series since 1981, and thanks to the team's odds defying comeback, he finally cashed in on his wager. The lifetime ASA member has also written a new book, Living Out Loud: Sports Cancer and Things Worth Fighting For, due out November 8. Sager, who has been battling leukemia since 2014, had a successful procedure done last week and also celebrated a birthday. Our thoughts and prayers are with him.\n\nAfter a 108-year drought, the Chicago Cubs have finally won the World Series. The following is ASA member Joe Buck's call on Fox of this historical sports moment:\n\n“Here’s the 0-1. This is going to be a tough play! Bryant! THE CUBS! WIN THE WORLD SERIES! Bryant makes the play! It’s over! And the Cubs have finally won it all, 8-7 in 10!”\n\nOn the radio side, Pat Hughes provided this description on 670 WSCR in Chicago:\n\n“A little bouncer, slowly towards Bryant.

The Cubs have done it! The longest drought in the history of American sports is over, and the celebration begins!”\n\nCongratulations Chicago!\n\nMichael Smith and Jemele Hill will serve as co-hosts of ESPN's 6pm edition of \"SportsCenter\" beginning on February 6.

Howarth says he made the decision not to say the Cleveland team name more than two decades ago because he finds it offensive to aboriginal Americans or First Nations people. Howarth told a Toronto radio show he also doesn’t use “Braves” for Atlanta or phrases like “a pow wow on the mound” for meetings between coaches and pitchers. He said he had made the decision after the 1992 World Series when the Blue Jays beat the Braves. Howarth says he received a letter from a member of an indigenous tribe and said he had found Indian team names and terms offensive.\n\nIt's been rumored that New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is a candidate to replace longtime WFAN Radio talk show host Mike Francesa when he retires in 2017.

Scully has been synonymous with the Dodgers since 1950, when Red Barber was still in the \"catbird seat\" and the team still called Brooklyn's Ebbets Field its home. Scully, inducted into the ASA Hall of Fame in 1992, was voted the \"Sportscaster of the Century\" by the ASA membership in 2000, as well as th Top Sportscaster of All-Time in 2009. After an illustrious career on the national stage with NBC, CBS and ESPN, Enberg returned to his first true love, baseball, and spent the last six years as the TV voice of the San Diego Padres. He is a 14-time Emmy Award winner, five-time winner of the ASA's Sportscaster of the Year Award and has long served as the organization's Chairman.\n\nESPN will pay tribute to legendary LA Dodgers announcer Vin Scully during tonight's telecast of \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" between the Giants and the Dodgers at 10p.m. et. The network will air Scully's call of the entire fourth inning courtesy of SportsNet LA, and some of the ASA Hall of Famer's most memorable moments behind the microphone will be featured throughout the broadcast.\n\nSarah Spain, ESPN Radio host and espnW writer, has signed a multi-year contract extension. Spain will continue in her role as a featured reporter and columnist for espnW and contribute to multiple ESPN platforms. She will also co-host a new national weeknight ESPN Radio show with Israel Gutierrez, entitled \"Izzy and Spain\" which launches Monday, September 26, at 9pm.\n\nGood Luck to Lifetime ASA Member Sean McDonough as he calls his first Monday Night Football game, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Washington Redskins, tonight at 7:10 pm with partner Jon Gruden.

Beadle will split time with current host Sage Steele, who will also be hosting Sports Center. ASA Lifetime member Doris Burke has also earned a spot in the Countdown studio as an analyst.\n\nWith broadcasting legend Vin Scully's final season coming down to the wire, KTLA-TV Ch. 5 has agreed to a deal to air the ASA Hall of Famer's final six regular season games. This will be a real treat for Dodgers fans in the Los Angeles area. Strange as it may seem, most of the city doesn't have access to SportsNet LA, which holds the TV rights to Dodgers games, due to the lack of cable systems that carry the station.\n\nCraig Sager, colorful NBA sideline reporter for TNT, received a rare third bone marrow transplant on August 31 as he continues to battle Leukemia. The lifetime ASA member, who announced in March that his cancer had returned, was forced to cancel his trip to the Rio Olympics. Sager, 65, has been remarkably upbeat since he was diagnosed with the disease in 2014. “Man, life is too beautiful, too wonderful, there’s just too many things,” Sager said. “It’s not just you. It’s your family and kids and all. Fight. Fight until the end. Fight as hard as you can.” Our thoughts and prayers are with him.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are moving...to a different radio station. After 32 years on KNBR, the Warriors will have a new home on 95.7 The Game starting with the 2016-17 NBA season. Tim Roye, the team’s play-by-play man for 22 years, will be making the move. However, the status of analyst Tom Tolbert, who also hosts a talk show in KNBR, is uncertain. The recent knock on KNBR is that the Warriors games were sometimes bumped down the dial for Giants baseball. “The Game” will dedicate much more air time to the 2015 NBA Champs, including the playoffs, extended pre and post-game coverage and special programming.\n\nMike Tirico will be doing football on NBC after all. The former ESPN “Monday Night Football” voice, who was scheduled to do the play-by-play on NBC’s Thursday Night Football package before the NFL decided they wanted Al Michaels to handle the call, has been given the assignment of host of “Sunday Night Football.” Bob Costas, who has been handling those duties, will now preside over the Thursday night telecasts.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams have announced that Pac-12 Network play-by-play man JB Long and former NFL running back and NFL Network analyst Maurice Jones-Drew will be the team's radio broadcasters on ESPNLA 710 AM. Former LA Rams linebacker D'Marco Farr will work the sidelines.\n\nWith the 2016 college football season fast-approaching, ESPN has hired Molly McGrath as a college sports sideline reporter and host. McGrath, who worked at ESPN in 2011 as a production assistant, returns to the company to be a sideline reporter for ESPN’s Friday night college football telecasts and will also host College Football Live on select days beginning in late August and continuing through the season. McGrath will also be a sideline reporter on ESPN’s 2016-17 college basketball telecasts.\n\nCharles Barkley, the outspoken basketball Hall of Famer and TNT announcer, will be getting his own show. Barkley will host \"The Race Card,\"an hour-long show featuring the NBA legend discussing “hot-button topics” with guests such as cultural leaders with varying viewpoints and perspectives. TNT released the following statement: “NBA legend and Inside the NBA analyst Charles Barkley has had enough. The America that he knew has lost its way, becoming mired in partisan politics, social divides and entrenched corporate interests. Now he hopes to get to the root of the problem in the new limited-run series, The Race Card.\" TNT has ordered six episodes of the show, with plans to launch in early 2017.\n\nThe house cleaning continues at ESPN with word that longtime \"Sunday NFL Countdown\" analyst Tom Jackson will likely be leaving the network prior to the 2016 season. Jackson, 65, has been part of the \"Coundtown \" team alongside host Chris Berman since he arrived in Bristol in 1987. ESPN has already parted ways with Mike Ditka, Keyshawn Johnson and Chris Carter, replacing them with Charles Woodson, Matt Hasselback and Randy Moss. Berman's future at ESPN is unclear as well, as his contract expires in 2017 and there have been reports that the he will either retire or take a reduced role. The Boomer has been a fixture at ESPN since its inception in 1979.\n\nJerry Remy, Boston Red Sox TV analyst on NESN, was forced to leave Saturday's game against the Minnesota Twins in the second inning after he was hit in the head by a TV monitor that fell off the wall in the broadcast booth. Steve Lyons came on in relief of Remy and finished the game with play-by-play man Dave O'Brien. Thankfully Remy did not sustain any injuries and was back in the booth on Sunday.\n\nESPN confirmed the addition of Randy Moss to its lineup. He will serve as an analyst on Sunday NFL Countdown and Monday Night Countdown and contribute to ESPN's annual Super Bowl week coverage. For the past three years, Moss worked as a NFL analyst for FOX Sports on FOX NFL Kickoff.\n\nShowtime’s Inside the NFL returns for season 39 on Sept. 6 at 9p, with this season’s lineup set to include the return of James Brown beside Phil Simms, Boomer Esiason and Brandon Marshall. Michael Irvin joins the cast as guest analyst throughout the season, with Adam Schein also returning to the show as a contributor and guest host.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams locked in a five-year agreement with ESPNLA 710AM to serve as the Rams’ official home and flagship radio partner. The agreement covers pre-season, regular-season, and post-season games, with extensive pre and post-game shows, producing an eight-hour game-day broadcast. The Rams have also reached a multi-year agreement with Entercom’s The Sound 100.3FM, who will simulcast game-day broadcasts and serve as the Rams’ official FM home.\n\nMike “Doc” Emrick, Hall of Fame hockey broadcaster, will team with veteran announcer Bob Costas to call his first ever major league baseball game. Emrick will call the action as the Pittsburgh Pirates take on the Chicago Cubs this Friday night on the MLB Network. Costas, who appeared on the Mike & Mike show on ESPN Radio on Wednesday morning, mentioned that when the two NBC colleagues get together, the conversation usually switches to baseball and how Emrick, a lifelong Pittsburgh Pirates fan who grew up listening to Bob Prince on KDKA Radio, would love to call a game. Costas was able to pull some strings at the MLB network to make it happen. The fact that it’s a Pirates game is all the more sweeter.\n\nNBC will use a record 170 commentators for this year’s Summer Olympics in Rio, the network announced. The American Sportscasters Association will be well represented with members including Bob Costas, Marv Albert, Craig Sager, Marc Zumoff, Ann Meyers, Michele Tafoya, Rebecca Lowe, Liam McHugh, Tara Lipinski, Tom Hammond, Kenny Albert and Leigh Diffey taking part in the coverage.\n\nKevin Calabro has been named the new television play-by-play voice of the Portland Trailblazers starting with the 2016-17 season.

The network will offer over 36 hours of coverage on Fox and FS1 of this year's Open from the Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania.\n\nCongratulations to new ASA members Liam McHugh and Rebecca Lowe, both of whom will be headed to Rio to cover the Olympic Games for NBC, the network announced today. Joining them will be veteran announcer and ASA member Al Michaels, who will handle daytime hosting duties, as well as Dan Patrick and Carolyn Manno. Longtime ASA member Bob Costas will handle the prime time coverage for a record 11th time.\n\nFor the first time in his illustrious career, TNT reporter Craig Sager will be working the sidelines for an NBA Finals game. A Lifetime Member of ASA, Sager will work Game 6 tonight in Cleveland with announcers Mike Breen, Jeff Van Gundy, Mark Jackson and Doris Burke. He was approached by TNT and ESPN executives about making the special appearance on the ESPN on ABC telecast and was thrilled to have the opportunity to fill out his resume which oddly enough doesn't include an NBA Championship game. ESPN will also honor Sager with the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at this year's ESPY Awards on July 13th.\n\nIn somewhat of an unorthodox move,Annie Apple, mother of New York Giants first round draft pick Eli, has been hired by ESPN to contribute to its Sunday NFL coverage. Whether it will be a distraction for the rookie defensive back and/or the Giants remains to be seen.\n\nVerne Lundquist, veteran CBS announcer and ASA member, will be stepping down as the play-by-play voice of SEC football on CBS after the 2016 season. Lundquist, affectionately known as “Golden Throat,” has had the assignment since 2000. He will still call college basketball and Masters Golf for the network. Replacing him will be longtime friend and fellow ASA member Brad Nessler, who is returning to CBS after 24 years at ESPN.To mark the 100th running of the Indianapolis 500, ABC is set to utilize 100 cameras for the race, which takes place on May 29th. Production will include three onboard cameras per car in 12 of the 33 cars competing in the race as well as four Ultra Hi Motion cameras, aerial cameras located in a blimp and a helicopter and four robotic cameras with overhead views of the pits. Sound will be captured for viewers by 287 microphones, including 235 positioned around the racetrack and 26 mounted in race cars.\n\nCould you imagine Vin Scully calling NFL games with John Madden? It almost happened. Back in 1981, CBS wanted to shake things up a bit so they promoted rising star Madden their No. 1 team, replacing Tom Brookshier. Now the question was, would Pat Summerall continue as the main play-by-player or would they elevate Scully, who was already calling regional NFL games for CBS. In a move which would be unheard of today, CBS decided to hold an on-air audition between the two heavyweights for the first 8 weeks of the NFL season. Weeks 1-4 saw Scully work with Madden, and Summerall with Hank Stram. In weeks 5 -8, Summerall paired with Madden, and Scully with Stram. By week 9, the showdown between the broadcasting behemoths ended with CBS executives voting that Summerall had the better chemistry with Madden and was a better fit. Scully, who was upset with the way the situation was handled, eventually left for NBC in 1983 to be the No. 1 baseball announcer.Of course, Madden and Summerall went on to become one of the best broadcasting teams in sports history.\n\nCraig Sager, veteran TNT reporter, will be awarded the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the 2016 ESPY Awards on July 13th. Sager, who has been battling Leukemia since 2014, recently revealed that the cancer has returned for a third time. He has already had two stem cell transplants. Sager also appeared on the cover of the May 2nd issue of Sports Illustrated that included an in-depth feature article by Lee Jenkins.\n\nESPN has named Sean McDonough as the new voice of \"Monday Night Football.\" He will team with analyst Jon Gruden and reporter Lisa Salters. A Lifetime Member of ASA, McDonough just signed a contract extension with ESPN, where he has been since 2000. He will continue to call college basketball after the NFL season. The move comes in the wake of Mike Tirico's decision to leave the campus in Bristol for NBC, effective July 1. Tirico's assignments will include NBC's new Thursday Night Football package, Sunday Night Football and the Olympics, which was a key factor in Tirico's decision to make the move from ESPN, where he had been since 1991.\n\nESPN continues to shake things up on their NFL coverage, as they plan to let go of analysts Ray Lewis and Chris Carter in favor of former Vikings wide receiver and Fox analyst Randy Moss. Keyshawn Johnson and Mike Ditka have already been replaced by Charles Woodson and Matt Hasselback.\n\nTelemundo and NBC Universo unveiled their agenda for this year's Summer Olympics in Rio, offering more than 200 hours of coverage on the two networks which will rank as the most in the history of US Spanish-language television. The action begins on Aug. 3 and runs through the 21 with a lineup of over 20 presenters, including ASA Lifetime Member Andres Cantor along with Jessica Carrillo and Miguel Gurwitz as hosts. With a spotlight on soccer and other primary targets that include swimming, track and field, boxing, diving, tennis and more.\n\nTina Cervasio, former New York Knicks sideline reporter, is now an Arena Football sideline reporter at CBS Sports.\n\nAccording to reports, ESPN veteran Mike Tirico is leaving the network to join NBC Sports. A Lifetime member of ASA, Tirico has been a mainstay at the \"worldwide leader in sports\" since the early 1990s when he was an anchor on SportsCenter. He has been the play-by-play voice of \"Monday Night Football\" since 2006. Fellow ASA Lifetime member Sean McDonough has been mentioned as the leading candidate to replace Tirico on MNF if indeed he makes the move to the Peacock Network.\n\nCurt Schilling, who was let go by ESPN for his recent transgender comments on social media, defended himself during an interview on Sirius XM Radio. Schilling, who started at the network in 2010, said ESPN was \"a company where the rules are different based completely and solely on your perspective and your belief.\" He also said he has \"never\" treated someone differently based on their race, religion or sexual preference. \"I don't care! I've never cared. As long as you're not sleeping with my wife, I don't care who you sleep with,\" Schilling said. The Facebook post in question, which has since been deleted, showed a man in ripped women's clothes with the caption: \"Let him in to the restroom with your daughter or else you're a narrow minded, judgmental, unloving, racist bigot who needs to die!\"\n\nESPN and ESPN Deportes will carry the historic matchup between between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban National Team on March 22. Karl Ravech, Eduardo Perez and Doug Glanville will have the call of the exhibition game which marks the first time an MLB team has played in Cuba since the Baltimore Orioles took on the Cuban Nationals in 1999. President Barack Obama, who will be in attendance, is also making history as the first acting president to visit the country since Calvin Coolidge in 1928. Hopefully the mutual love of baseball by the U.S. and Cuba can serve as a stepping stone to improve relations between the two countries. The game will be preceded by a special 90-minute, on-site edition of SportsCenter, hosted by ASA member Hannah Storm, at noon.\n\nTSN agreed to a deal with Sky Sports to offer Canadian viewers the company’s broadcast coverage of the FIA Formula One World Championship.

Those games will be simulcast on the NFL Network, which will get its own slate of eight games, including late season Saturday games.\n\nMy, how time flys. Linda Cohn, longtime ESPN announcer, will anchor her 5000th \"SportsCenter\" on February 21st at 8am. Cohn, who made her \"SportsCenter\" debut alongside Chris Meyers back on July 11, 1992, has hosted more editions of the show than anyone else in its 36-year history.\n\nFox Sports 1 has decided to cancel its nightly highlight show, \"Fox Sports Live.\" Hosts Jay Onrait and Dan O'Toole will remain with the station.\n\nKeyshawn Johnson, studio analyst on ESPN's \"Sunday NFL Countdown,\" will not be returning to the network after his contract expires at the end of the NFL season.\n\nBob Miller, TV voice of the LA Kings, is taking a leave of absence to undergo heart bypass surgery. A time table for his return has not been determined . Veteran radio voice Nick Nickson will fill-in for Miller on TV and Jon Rosen will handle the radio call. Chris Mortensen, longtime ESPN NFL reporter, has been diagnosed with throat cancer and will be taking a leave of absence. A staple at ESPN since 1991, Mortensen is known as one of the best \"newsbreakers\" in the business. We at the ASA wish him a full and speedy recovery.\n\nIt seems to be one and done for Greg Norman. According to reports, Fox has dropped the U.S. Open golf analyst from its coverage after only one year. It's been rumored that the network, which acquired the rights to the golf championship last year, was unhappy with Norman's lack of preparation and weak analysis during crucial moments of the broadcast.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings suffered a heartbreaking loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs, and it seems like no one was more upset then their radio play-by-play announcer Paul Allen. \"Are you kidding me? The season can't end like that!\" Allen screamed in disbelief after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal wide left. Allen then somberly stated, \"The Seattle Seahawks are off to Charlotte.” Blair did make three field goals in the game which accounted for all of the Vikings offense as they lost 10-9.\n\nAnn Meyers, ASA member and Phoenix Suns TV analyst, was part of sportscasting history on January 6th when the Suns hosted the Charlotte Hornets. The game marked the first time that the local telecasts for both teams featured female analysts; Meyers for the Suns on Fox Sports Arizona and Stephanie Ready for the Hornets on Fox Sports Southeast. Ready, who became the first full-time female analyst after she made the move from sideline reporter last year, called Meyers an inspiration and posted several pictures of the two on Twitter, as well as an interview she did with the women’s basketball pioneer during the pregame.\n\nI guess three really is a crowd. According to reports, John Smoltz, MLB Network baseball analyst and 2015 Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, will be joining veteran play-by-play man Joe Buck in the Fox broadcast booth, replacing Tom Verducci and Harold Reynolds. FOX also announced that its No. 1 football annoucing team of Buck, Troy Aikman and Erin Andrews will call all three of FOX’s exclusive NFC post-season games starting Sunday, January 10th Joining the trio on-site will be Chris Myers, serving as an additional game reporter, and former head of NFL officiating and football rules expert Mike Pereira.\n\nMichelle Margaux was named by FOX Sports San Diego as the new host of the network’s weekly show, “Padres POV.” She will also serve as a fill-in Sideline Reporter behind Julie Alexandria on Padres telecasts.\n\nJim Costa is the new PM Drive host on Grand Rapids, MI station ESPN 96.1.Costa will co-host “It Is What It Is” with Droo McCarthy.\n\nKeith Hernandez, SNY New York Mets analyst, remains a free agent, as he has yet to be re-signed by the Mets regional network.

He has been joined by play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen and fellow analyst Ron Darling to form one of the most beloved broadcast teams in sports.\n\nCBS Sports is getting a make over. The 35-year old CBS “eye” logo will be redesigned to give it a more sleeker and updated look. The new logo, as well as a new on-air graphics package, will debut during the network’s Super Bowl Week programming and its broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on February 7.\n\nRachel Nichols is heading back to Bristol.

After nine years at ESPN, Nichols left “The Worldwide Leader in Sports” in 2013.\n\nCBS feasted on Thanksgiving Day, as its NFC matchup between the undefeated Carolina Panthers and the Dallas Cowboys drew an average viewership of over 32.5 million, according to Neilson, making it the most watched CBS Thanksgiving game in the last 20 years. NBC also scored big with its primetime showdown between the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. Its 27.8 million viewers made it the most watched primetime Thanksgiving game ever. It didn’t hurt that the Packers were honoring some guy named Favre at halftime.\n\nComcast is apparently saying “No” to the YES Network. Citing low viewership and unreasonable demands in their negotiations which includes a 33% fee increase, Comcast has dropped the cable home of the Yankees, Nets and NYFC soccer club. Some 900,000 homes in parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will be affected.\n\n“Goooooaaaaaaal!” That's what Andres Cantor exclaimed when he signed a multi-year contract extension with NBC Deportes assuring him the opportunity to serve as Telemundo’s lead broadcaster for the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. Securing Cantor’s services was key as Telemundo has ponied up some $600 million to snare the U.S. Spanish-language rights to the World Cup away from rival Univision starting with the 2018 tournament.\n\nLesson #1: When your phone rings, answer it. Because it might be living legend Vin Scully on the other end. That's what Joe Davis learned when he let two calls that didn't come up on his caller ID go to voice mail. The first call ended with no message but the second left Davis in awe, as it was broadcasting great Vin Scully welcoming the 27-year-old to the Dodgers family. Davis signed a deal with the team to call 50 road televised games on SportsNet LA with analysts Orel Hershiser and Nomar Garciaparra. The up and coming Davis has already worked for ESPN and Fox Sports, and with Scully announcing that 2016 will be his last year, there is speculation that Davis will be groomed to be the next Dodgers voice. He will have some mighty big shoes to fill.\n\n\"No mas.\" That's what Ken Hershman, president of HBO Sports, has decided. As he announced that he will be leaving the position he has held since 2012 at the end of the year. The move came as a surprise to the boxing world, as Hershman, 52, is one of the most powerful people in the business. He handled an eight-figure annual budget for HBO's boxing franchise, oversaw its pay-per-view division and decided which fighters the network would back and hopefully propel to superstar status.\n\nWith college hoops about to get into full swing, ESPN has shored up its broadcasting crew across its college platforms. The SEC Network will see Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis, Andrew DeClercq and John Pelphrey handling analyst duties this year for the men and new hires Candance Parker and Andy Landers for the women. ESPNU has added Antawn Jamison and Jason Capel to their stable of announcers. The season gets underway across the networks on Friday, Nov. 13 with an SEC Network doubleheader showcasing Albany at No. 1 Kentucky at 7 p.m., followed by Eastern Washington at Mississippi State at 9 p.m. The ESPNU doubleheader has Siena at No. 5 Duke at 7 p.m., followed by McNeese State at LSU.\n\nTina Cervasio, ASA member and former New York Knicks sideline reporter, is joining One World Sports. She will make her OWS debut on Saturday working the Cosmos' NASL Championship semi-final. Aside from her Knicks duties at MSG, Cervasio also worked on Red Bulls telecasts. Next season, Cervasio will anchor a Cosmos pregame show and report from the sidelines, joining play-by-play man JP Dellacamera and analyst Shep Messing. She also will co-host OWS’ “NASL This Week.”\n\nThere was a full moon after the Cincinnati Bengals' win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, and I don't mean in the sky. The NFL network's Albert Breer was interviewing Bengals cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones in the locker room after the road win catapulted Cinci to a 6-0 record. Unbeknownst to Breer and Jones, some of his teammates were in the background in their birthday suits, which probably won't \"sit\" well with the FCC. I'm sure this will rehash the ongoing debate as to whether or not cameras and the media really need to be in the locker room. At least it wasn't a female reporter, which would have opened up a whole other can of worms.\n\nNo wonder why Alex Rodriguez doesn't play the field anymore, he's lost his throwing accuracy. Rodriguez, who will be joining Fox Sports for the remainder of the post-season, stopped by the Fox NFL studio on Sunday to chat with studio hosts Curt Menefee, Howie Long, Terry Bradshaw, Jimmy Johnson and Michael Strahan. A former quarterback in high school, A-Rod was prompted to show off his arm and proceeded to sail a pass over the head of NFL insider Jay Glazer that went crashing through a TV monitor.\n\nGreat news from Turner Sports confirming that ASA Lifetime member Craig Sager will be back on the sidelines on NBA opening night. Sager, who recently received another round of chemotherapy in his ongoing bout with leukemia, will work the Pelicans-Warriors game with the broadcast team of Marv Albert and Chris Webber. The 2015-16 NBA season on TNT tips off its 32nd year of coverage on October 27 at 7pm et with the \"Inside the NBA\" studio show followed by the opener of the doubleheader between the Cavaliers and Bulls.\n\nJoe Buck has apparently upset some Kansas City Royals fans, namely Adam Jones, who started a petition to have the longtime Fox play-by-play man relieved from his duties calling the American League Championship Series.
