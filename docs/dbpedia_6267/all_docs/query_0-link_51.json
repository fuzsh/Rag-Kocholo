Adams had White every game and Horowitz had Black every game. Adams lost the match. Weaver Adams's mother's side was been traced back to the founding fathers of America. Arnold Denker related of Weaver Adams that he was \"a master who inherited a chicken farm and who was — so to speak — a White man clear through. He wrote a book, White to Play and Win, lived in a White house on White Street, chewed antacid pills that left the inside of his mouth perpetually White, and raised only white chickens that laid white eggs.\" Harry Golombek wrote in 1977 that Adams, whom he described as \"author of White to Play and Win and a sodium bicarbonate addict\", was on Golombek's \"reserves\" list for \"the ten most interesting personages\" from the past 100 years. Adams won the 49th U.S. Open, held in Baltimore, in 1948. He also wrote Simple Chess, How to Play Chess, and Absolute Chess. He died on January 6, 1963.\n\nW.

In 1974 in a tournament in Poland, Mikhail Tal (1936-1992) was playing Jan Adamski with both players in time trouble. Adamski's flag fell but Tal lost a piece and resigned. At that moment Tal's wife, who had been counting the moves, said \"Black has not yet made 40 moves.\" The flag had fallen before Tal resigned. The arbiter intervened and awarded the win to Tal, who went on to win the tournament. Tal's wife scored this point! Later, it was shown that Adamski quit writing his moves down after move 25 because of time trouble, and then he added two fake moves while reconstructing his scoresheet to make it seem he made more than 40 moves. His best Elo rating was 2470 in 1977.\n\nAdamski — J. Christiansen, Copenhagen 2000 1. Nf3 f5 2. g3 Nf6 3. Bg2 e6 4. O-O Be7 5. c4 O-O 6. Nc3 d6 7. d4 Qe8 8.b3 Nc6 9. d5 exd5 10. cxd5 Ne5 11.
