Y Letters To The Editor Your recent editorial (“Where Should A Player Compete?”, May, 1961) gives me an opportunity to submit a tourna- ment chairman’s brief on the subject of promoting and developing tennis inter- est in the United States. My thesis is that the USLTA should take a greater interest in its own major sancticned events and give more consideration to the efforts of local clubs than has been apparent in recent years. Last month we held another “unpro- tected” Western Championship here at the Town Club. Since we alternate in playing host to the tournament with the Woodstock Club of Indianzpolis, the re- cent Western was our third since the new club house and facilities were con- structed in suburban Milwaukee. In 1957 and 1959 we experienced the usual post-Wimbledon squeeze in efforts to attract a good draw of top U. S. play- ers. We sadly recognized our inability to compete with Bastaad, Dublin, Ant- werp and now Venice as a player attrac- tion, despite the fact that Milwaukee is a convenient stopover for players en route to the National Clays at River For- est the following week. This year we started our inquiries very early. Yet it was not until we tele- phoned one of the top players, six weeks prior to the tournament, that we learned about the conflicting Davis Cup Tie with Ecuador, which had been scheduled to interfere with our tournament. This player indicated that he wanted very much to return to Milwaukee but that he expected to be named to the Cup team and could not definitely advise of his plans until he was notified by the Davis Cup committee. It was not until the week before our tournament started, and until we telephoned the Davis Cup captain, that we learned the names of those to be selected for the Tie. In addition to the large number of our better players who were remaining in Europe after Wim- bledon and the Davis Cup conflict, three top players had to withdraw from our event because of injuries. In trying to promote the Western with prospective patrons and with the news media, we were asked, quite naturally, which of our top-rated players would be in our draw. When we informed them that few, if any, would be here, they asked why. Our answer was: (1) two of the Top Ten men have turned profes- sional; (2) of the rest, three are com- mitted to play Davis Cup and four of the other five are committed to Bastaad, Dublin or Venice; (3) of the women, two are resting, two who had entered are hurt, and the others are playing abroad, Can we tell the press and the public that the Western is an important tourna. ment when virtually none of America’s fine players compete in it? Surely there are scheduling problems, and we recog. nize them. Davis Cup matches mus! con- flict with some tournaments occasionally, and now and then the Western must be hit. But when it’s our turn, why aren’ we notified well in advance and why aren't efforts made to cut down on for. eign commitments of our players during that week? All good young players aspiring to the top want to play Wimbledon. But should three dozen or more of our play- ers compete there? Should so many play in all the English pre-Wimbledon tour. neys at the expense of the TVI, South. ern, Tri-State and Western? We recog. nize the great value in having a few of our prominent and promising players competing in the important foreign events. But it seems to us that the pri- mary concern of the USLTA should be the development of ability in our young players, the regaining of the Davis Cup and the fostering of enthusiasm for ten- nis amonz youngsters and parents alike. This objective is made more difficult to reach in areas of this country where SUBSCRIPTION ORDER FORM WORLD TENNIS Box 3, Gracie Station New York, N. Y.

From the inner core of live rubber—to the amazing “‘wool”’ cover of nylon and dacron— Wilson Championship delivers the speed, “‘feel’’ and bounce every tennis player needs. Play to win with the Wilson Championship ball. PLAY TO WIN WITH Wilson Sporting Goods Co., Chicago (A Subsidiary of Wilson & Co., Inc.) major tournaments are continually by- passed by important players. We do not object to paying reason- able expenses, even intercontinental trav- el expenses. We do not oppose—in fact we support—the recent decision of the USLTA Executive Committee to impose a 5% tax on gross admissions receipts of national, sectional and invitation events. But we believe that in return, and to promote the sport and develop interest in playing and excelling in ten- nis, our good young players should be competing in our tournaments, striving for wins over our higher ranking play- ers. Tournaments, as well as players, have reputations. Although the Town Club has no fancy stadium or plush club house and although we have had rela- tively little experience in putting on these events, we believe we have made progress in establishing a pretty good reputation for hospitality at Milwaukee. Our growing group of enthusiastic ten- nis playing members tries to show the players consideration and a good time while they are here. We would like to think that they will come back in two years—even pass up the foreign tourna- ments, where the price is right and the living is easy. We had a fine tournament here last month. Players, club members and the public were enthusiastic. Despite the dearth of top talent, our press gave the tournament wonderful publicity. Players who will be our top stars in two years made friendships here. But where will they be playing two years from now? Unless we get better cooperation and more consideration from the USLTA, we ll wager right now that they will be playing in Bastaad, Dublin, Antwerp or Venice—not in Milwaukee. William L. Randall, Chairman Western Championships * * * I am sixteen years of age and hoping to play for my county tennis team this year. Can you find me a young Ameri- can boy and, if possible, a young Ameri- can girl who play competitive tennis, to write to? I correspond with Junior ten- nis players all over the world—in Chile, France, Germany and Italy, but none in the U. S. or Australia. I have seen most of your Top Twenty, excluding Bartzen. My top American Ten would now be: 1. McKinley, 2. Bart- zen, 3. Ralston, 4. Holmberg, 5. Doug- las, 6. Dell, 7. Henry, 8. Bennett, 9. Reed, 10. Crawford. P. R. Wilkinson Gatley, Cheshire, England * * * You published a letter over my sig- nature concerning the impossibility of purchasing high tennis shoes. Then you heard from Joel K. Wechsler of the Converse Rubber Company who offered 4 to meet my requirements. I must tell you what these people did. Mr. Wechsler had me go to one of their distribution agents in New York to be fitted. Then I sent him the shoe size, etc., and within four days two pair of specially made high tennis shoes arrived at my home. For this marvelous cooperation, which surely involved considerable nuisance in their manufacturing process, the Converse Rubber Company billed me only at the regular price for such shoes. I can think of no more forceful proof of their devo- tion to tennis than this incident. Thomas F. Maguire New York City, N. Y. * * * We just finished disporting ourselves on the courts of the French Riviera, the Lido, Austria and Switzerland and, nos- talgically, on London grass. I can re- commend this sort of footloose indulge- ment in the game. Courts are good, arrangements easily made and hospital- ity flowing. In Austria we played for l6c a day, with freshly snow-capped Alps for background. In Paris we took in the Italian-French Davis Cup Tie one afternoon. After all those interminable baseline rallies, with net play almost non-existent, I wondered whether I was witnessing the same sport about which all those one-service-only, shorten-the-service-court, put-line-be- hind-the-baseline, no-serve-and-run-in articles are written. Robert C. Hynson Laurel, Mississippi * * * In your current issue of WorLD TEN- nis I was much interested in the article “The Case Of The Missing Linesman” by Edward C. Potter. How well I re- member watching every stroke and de- tail of this wonderful match between Larned and H. L. Doherty. I was sitting on the stand at the back of the court, exactly in the centre, the best position from which to see and judge a serve down the centre line of the court—which was the case of the serve in question— and easier to see than had it been the case of a fault over the back or service line. Doherty’s first serve was a fault, a very definite fault. I saw it so clearly. It must have been six inches over the centre line of the service court. Doherty, seeing that his first serve was a very obvious fault, did not make the slightest attempt to get, or pay any attention, to Larned’s return. He was, in fact, prepar- ing to serve again when Mansfield, the Umpire, hearing no linesman call, said “Game to Larned.” Then followed the controversy and many of the spectators began calling “Fault.” Dr. Dwight was quite right in ruling the point a let, though what Doherty asked was that his first serve should be ruled a fault and that he should be al- lowed his second serve. This was what ~ eventually took place. The caption under the picture q Larned, which read “Larned was the victim in the case of the Missing Line man. He would have had a 5-4 lead jy the fifth set against H. L. Doherty the Davis Cup Challenge Round if service linesman had not disappeareg is quite incorrect as, had the missing linesman been in his place, he woul most certainly have called a fault op Doherty’s first serve and Doherty would then have had his second serve. which was actually what happened. A. C. Butler Claremont, Cape Town, South Africa * * * I would like to quote the following paragraphs from Mr. Steve Weller’s col- umn in the Buffalo Evening News: “At 4:30 PM Wednesday (August 9) Buffalo’s claim to the titles of flower of the tennis world and flawless ruby of the racket-stringing universe hung in the balance. In one corner stood Paul Brod- nicki, wearing yellow golf gloves anda snub-nosed icepick. His opponent was a tennis racket which at the moment hap- pened to be, if you'll pardon the expres- sion, gutless. The referee, armed witha stopwatch, was Stan Panek, a neutral observer drafted from the Dunlop Tire and Rubber Co., for the world cham pionship duel. The scene was the cub mination of a war by correspondence that began back in March when Joe Brodnicki, Paul’s father, wrote a letter to the magazine Wori”p Tennis. He stated that the racket-stringing record in his shop was 8 minutes, 40 seconds, and that the record for one day’s work by one man was 75 rackets. “In the magazine’s May issue, Brod nicki was buried under an avalanche of polite abuse. ‘Now we know who really wrote the famous Baron Munchausen stories,” guffawed a woman in Me bourne, Fla. ‘Astounding,’ scoffed a man in Oklahoma City, hinting strongly that rackets strung in anything less than 30 minutes could be used only to swat flies and flay rugs. Brodnicki’s competitive fire flared. He set up the race against time and the taunts of heavy-fingered skeptics. Awaiting the bell for the big match, the Brodnickis explained theif racket. ‘Nobody can come close to our records, said Joe. ‘Patience, flexible fingers and pride in workmanship does it. Paul is fastest because he has a spe cial way of weaving the strings, strictly by hand. The day he did 75 he started at 2:30 in the morning and worked until 9 at night. It was nice to get the record back in the family. I had the old mark of 67, then three men from this shop did 68 so Paul had to string 75. I didn’t see him at work for a week after that.’ “*T wear the golf gloves to prevent gainst igered TRITON The amazing purple motor oil Purple Royal Triton is the one motor oil whose per- formance is as unique as its color. It prolongs trouble- free engine performance for thousands of extra miles. The next time you change oil, change to Royal Triton. You'll soon see why it’s The Finest. UNION OIL COMPANY of CALIFORNIA 76, callouses and to absorb perspiration,’ Paul explained. ‘The awl helps me thread the strings, and the machine the racket is set up on is a Uvy550 Serrano.’ “The moment of truth was at hand. The stopwatch clicked and the bout was on. A stand-up stringer, Paul moved in on the Serrano, which resembled a re- volving cross-bow, and quickly had it whirling like an over-weight hula hoop. With 30 feet of nylon to lace through the frame he was busier than a right- hand man eating spaghetti with a left- hand chop stick. When it was over, Panek stared at his stopwatch in dis- belief. It read: 8 minutes, 30 seconds. Fie on Melbourne, Fla. A pox upon Oklahoma City. Buffalo is the unchal- lenged center of world racket-stringing culture.” As I reviewed the column, I began to suspect myself of having called the Buffalo Evening News just so that I could have Mr. Steve Weller do my reporting for me. With his very excel- lent coverage of the story, all that is really needed at this point is my letter of transmittal. The only things that I might add that are not mentioned in Weller’s column are: in a warm-up for the actual “rec- ord breaking” attempt, Paul Brodnicki came up with an 8 minute and 50 second time. The fact that he did several rackets in my presence assures me that the at- tainment of such speed is not accidental. My timing was based on the racket al- ready being in place on the stringing machine, and it excludes final trimming. Less than two additional minutes would cover Paul’s preliminary and finishing operations. I am naturally on the look- out for any attempt to work Dunlop into the story, but unfortunately Paul’s rec- ord is based on a Davis racket. The 19 hole Davis versus the 20 hole Maxply makes quite a difference in his speed. Stan Panek Dunlop Tire & Rubber Co. Buffalo, N. Y. * * * In Melbourne, we were very inter- ested in reading that 75 rackets had been strung in a day by an American. This is truly a stupendous feat, and we congratulate the man concerned. In talk- ing about this with members of our trade, I discovered that an Australian record had been made for the stringing of a racket. The actual time, under su- pervision, was 6 minutes 42 seconds. | think stringers in the U. S. will be pleased to hear of this Australian record. R. W. Hedley Dunlop Sports Co. Pty. Ltd. Melbourne, Australia * * * Go back just a very few seasons on any USLTA draw sheet and you will see that 90% of our leading players par- 6 ticipated in the National Doubles. It was then very difficult—almost impossible— for a local or club team to gain entrance to the tournament. But in the draw sheet for 1961 one finds that out of the 61 teams playing, 21 of them were from the New England area. In the women’s draw it was worse. Is it fair to the public to be deprived of seeing Holmberg, Green, Nagler, Franks, and Fox? Where were they? Were the living conditions or ex- pense money better at some other place? In the women’s draw, Mrs. Greenwood and her committee once more threw a curve at Longwood by taking Moffitt, Chabot, Hanks and Bricka for the Na- tional Junior Girls’ Championships. Two of these girls were responsible for our winning back the Wightman Cup and certainly would have had drawing power at Longwood, One was the Wimbledon Doubles Champion. Because of sched- uling short-sightedness again, this was not possible. One cannot blame the Jun- ior Girls for wanting to play their own event and skipping the National Dou- bles. Returning to the men, it seems ridi- culous when a tournament chairman, in order to have the required amount of entries to seed eight teams, has to solicit a local pick-up team one hour before the draw is to be made. Many comments have been made as to why all our top men were not here and many say that it is due to the five day layover between the doubles and singles. The players can- not afford to spend nearly a month in the Rhode Island, Massachusetts and New York area. For the sake of the pay- ing public in the New England area, please (scheduling committee) give a little thought to this soon. W. W. Hoblitzell III Boston, Mass. * * * One thing I cannot let pass unchecked is the caption under the photo on page 73 of the last issue. Surely the acrobatic team consists of Pietrangeli and Pilar Barril of Spain, not that cute Italian, Silvana Lazzarino. Silvana is a friend of mine, and I don’t think I could ever mis. take her profile. I have many photos of her and I have compared them all with yours. Who is wrong? Edward L. Griffiths London, England Ep. Note: The photograph was that of Pilar Barril. * % * As Chief Umpire at the Wightman Cup Matches, I tried something unique in U. S. tennis, patterned after what | saw Carroll and Betty Pratt do in Mon. tego Bay. Eight of the 12 assignments for all of the 7 matches were permanent assignments. The eight veteran and trusted linesmen sat in the same place for 6 matches (the 7th was cancelled). I only alternated Umpires, service lines- men and one baselinesman. There were no bad calls and nothing but smoothly. running matches. I would suggest that Forest Hills keep a man assigned to the same spot for two straight matches if possible, then free him. Officials should not be required to sit in a Marquee all day, waiting around for assignments. Allen Shargel Chicago, III.

He had been accused by the Referee of the Davis Cup tie at Cleveland of bad conduct. How- ever, action was slow in following, and Ralston ac- tually competed in the National Doubles Champion- ships in the interim. The controversy caused by the suspension was sensational. At Forest Hills the competitors were out- raged, but officials in general sanctioned the ban. The latter argued that the behavior of the current crop of players has been so bad as to warrant setting an ex- ample. Ralston, they say, was on probation and there- fore every action of his had to be examined critically. They point to the rash of racket-throwing and ball- Wkicking at tournaments during the past two years, mand they further add that Ellsworth Vines, Don == Budge and Jack Kramer never threw a racket, kicked a ball or displayed any signs of temperament. On the other hand, there has never been a year in PY which at least five of the First Ten players did not a commit an action that would warrant suspension. #@ A Johnston Award winner of the USLTA trophy for .§ sportsmanship once got into a heated argument with a linesman on the Centre Court at Wimbledon and was roasted for his actions not only by the British press but also by Sports Illustrated. Another John- ston Award winner was one of the great stallers of t the game, a third recipient of this famous trophy was perhaps the best gamesman that tennis has ever | known, and a fourth has frequently been involved in ~} public brawls during the wee hours of the morning. 2) There are 10,000 club players whose behavior is as #4 bad or worse than that of Ralston. Dennis, from past performances, is not liable to win any popularity con- test through his court conduet. However, slamming the net with one’s racket is hardly grounds for sus- pension. (A Texas player admitted that he gave the net a whack this summer at Winston-Salem, causing the net to fall down.) Dennis was also guilty of swearing during the doubles at Cleveland. The court was slippery and he had fallen in his attempt to get to a ball. He mumbled “Goddam it” under his breath Nod nds 5 0 World Tennis #83 te singe nf The suspension of Dennis Ralston on the morning of the draw for the National Championships caused a furor in the tennis world.

Hot-tempered players are going to get a roasting from the press and the boos of the gallery whenever they give way to offensive displays. They deserve all the hoots, catcalls and critical comments that the fans and the sports writers pass out. But, as Marshall L. Reed described it in a sports editorial in The Co- lumbia Record, “unless it is the ultimate intention of the USLTA to restrict tennis to participation by robots, this throwing up of holy hands by the high brass is a bit on the silly side. As long as any game is played, there will be nerves worn and tempers lost.” Some 40 players at Forest Hills agreed, when polled, that Dennis’ conduct at Cleveland was not such as to warrant being banned from amateur com- petition.* The following acts were considered by them, to be grounds for suspension: 1. Dumping a match. 2. Physical violence, such as fist fights. 3. Shouting obscenities. 4. Deliberately hitting a ball or throwing a racket at the fans, linesmen, umpire or opponents. Only one of the players questioned+ would have objected if Orlando Sirola had been suspended for five years because of his behavior on the Caribbean circuit last winter. *One Northern California player believed that Ralston should have been suspended. : 7 Alan Lane of Australia 1] Edda Buding of Germany (above) had the misfortune to meet Yola Ramirez, her doubles partner, in the second round, but the two girls provided the gallery with one of the best matches of the tourna- ment.

Forest eixas, gles dent ROY EMERSON WINS THE MEN'S SINGLES by LANCE TINGAY An Australian took the men’s singles title at Forest Hills this year for the sixth year in succession. It turned out, however, to be the wrong Australian. Instead of Rod Laver emulating his splendid performance at Wimbledon, his fellow Queenslander, Roy Emerson, stoked the fires of speedy and happy genius and became Champion of the United States, This came about from one of the most strongly repre- sented American fields there has ever been—strong, that is, in numbers, for the foreign entry was not large. One of the best Americans was not there. Young Dennis Ralston had met the full measure of authority's discipline the morning before the draw was made. A good Englishman was in the field. That was Mike Sangster, who showed by reaching the last four that his arrival at the same stage at Wimbledon was perhaps less a matter of luck than had seemed at the time. The thunderbolt serving of Sangster was one of the most striking things about the meeting, and I doubt if anyone who saw him was not prepared to accord him the palm of being the most improved man of the year. There were four Americans in the last eight but none in the last four. The same things happened in 1958. I doubt if it were one of the best American Championships of all time but, as always, it proved a lively and stimulating meeting and was blessed with freedom from rain from start to finish. It was not, however, free from great heat and humidity. The First Round The outstanding match of the opening round was obvious as soon as the draw was made. The clash between Jon Doug- las, seeded seventh, and Ham Richardson had the spice of expectation. The old against the new? It was hardly that, for Richardson, after all, is only just 28, but here he came out of partial retirement to the jousting ground of the na- tionals with the weight of a good deal of expectation on his shoulders. Only a ae days before David Freed had been World Tennis voicing hopes of enticing him into the Davis Cup team. As for poor Douglas, what a draw came his way! Richardson in the first round, with the expectation of having an even weightier old hand, Vic Seixas, hurtling himself against him in the third. The first set between Douglas and Richardson was as good as any played on the two starting days. Richardson began as though the devil were sitting on his tail, and he leaped in to take Douglas’s serving on the rise with intimi- dating effect. In what hardly seemed any time at all he had garnered the first set 6-3, and those who had wagered con- fidently on a Richardson victory were well content. But how often does a man win a mile race if he sprints the first lap all out? Richardson had taken the opposition service in the first game of the second set before it began to look like it might work out in that manner. Conservation of energy has always been a more tricky business for Richardson than most, and on that hot and humid day it was no easy task for anyone. Douglas responded by breaking back at once. Not long afterwards he broke Richardson’s delivery twice in succes- sion to capture the set 6-2, though it was not yet obvious what hardships Richardson was to have to endure. He got the first edge in the third set when he broke to lead 4-3. Douglas got it back at once. Then Richardson, still hewing out his weighty backhand, broke again to be 5-4. Two double-faults as he served for the set signalled his growing incapacity. None the less Richardson again broke through to serve for the set once more at 7-6. This time there were three double- faults and the concession of a love game. Then, with Rich- ardson almost tottering, came the all decisive 18th game when he tried in vain to bring the score back to level peg- ging at 9-all. Richardson thrice held off set point, but on the fourth chance for Douglas he missed on a high back- hand volley and Douglas was ahead two sets to one. 13 f ri es cate.” EN 13 The most startling early round upset was registered by Whit- ney Reed (right), who eliminated the top American seed, Chuck McKinley. * Frank Froehling (left) defeated Junior Champ Charlie Pasarell in straight sets in the second round.

He held his serve to make it 1-all, but fre that point his physical distress was such that spectatonly feared he might collapse. The last three games of the mat were taken by Douglas without the loss of a single poi, for by then Richardson was as a blind man in a maze, } was all rather sad and poignant. Compared with this drama, the rest of the opening round was mundane. The only seeded man to have a set taken from him (apart from Douglas) was Mike Sangster. He played, I thought, rather a subdued match, rarely finding his fulf service power which is his finest glory, and Norman Perry, the American Armed Forces Champion, got into him strongly enough to take the second set. The man to get mog hecticly involved was Cliff Buchholz, who had to wait ip suspense overnight before he managed to finish off Ted Hoehn after a first set of 30 games, a second of 12 anda fourth of 20. The Ecuadorean Miguel Olvera distinguished himself by having the briefest match of all, a complete whitewash in which he took 18 straight games. The Second Round Here the favourite and Wimbledon Champion, Rod Laver, who had a bye, broached affairs for the first time. Chauncey D. Steele III was allowed four games by this talented left. hander. Frank Froehling continued apace with his lanky efforts, quelling young Charles Pasarell in three vigorous sets, although Pasarell showed enough to make me, as a Britisher, envy America having him on the scene. Douglas again had a pretty tough time of it. Ray Senkowski kept him going for quite a time and well earned the second set. Chuck McKinley hurtled his way to his second three sets victory. Whitney Reed made the same bracket, also without having lost a set. When I watched Reed at Wimbledon ear. lier this year, it occurred to me that had Mark Twain created a lawn tennis character, it would have been this engaging lump of unorthodoxy to his last weird shot. Bob Mark, who will perhaps forgive me if I say he ought to settle down to keeping an English pub, so fittingly would he grace the scene, joined the other seeded men who made the journey into the stage of the last 32 without undue trav- ail. The second round was not really one of excitement. The Third Round Here the men’s singles came explosively to life. Certainly Labor Day in the Stadium was one where the cash cus tomers had value a-plenty for their admittance money. First came the long, tense tussle between Douglas and Seixas, a rich five setter in which the 38-year old lion from Philadel: phia, a favorite still with the crowd, fought as he always did fight, came within one point of upsetting Douglas, and finally was subdued with virtually nothing in it except the thirteen years advantage Douglas had in stamina and energy. Douglas got the first set, but Seixas almost romped through the next two. He was aflame with his old spirit always going forward, never yielding a point until the las gasp. And a famous forehand worked wonders. A lesser player than Douglas would have given up, not only because of the seemingly inexorable qualities against him but also because, however generous the crowd was towards him, the weight of popular sentiment was clearly towards a Seixas victory. The crux of the contest came in the fourth set, its ultimate when Douglas, serving at 4-5, was match point down. Seixas netted his return and in retrospect one cou'd see how it was the end of his chances. At the time it was less evident, espe cially when Douglas got the service break to make himself 7-6 with service to come for the set. He yielded that game and his delivery on a double-fault, but it exemplified how the energies of Seixas were running out that he was nol made to pay the full price for the error. Douglas was able to break again at once and serve out this time for the sel without mistake. Doug game o!

That, in fact, was the end for, though | Seixas had stamina enough to hold his delivery from then s} on, he could not recover the break. He almost did in the last tainly cus: game of all, and that after he had saved match point on his own service when Douglas was at 5-3. Serving for the match at 5-4, Douglas lapsed to love-40 and the possibility of a Seixas victory, which had been dead for many games, be- came real again. Douglas had double-faulted to set in train the sequence which brought him to the peril of love-40. The amends he made were very adequate. He garnered the next five points in a row to hoist himself to success. Douglas had worked hard for his last 16 place. First Richardson and then Seixas! It was far from an easy road for a seeded man. Then came the most stirring match of a full day when McKinley, the second seed, the runner-up at Wimbledon, had to submit to Whitney Reed, as unorthodox as to be a coach’s nightmare and, | suppose, the nearest thing to a beatnik as ever was in top class lawn tennis. Was there ever a more rugged individualist than Reed? Whoever played more wrong shots the wrong way from the wrong position to the wrong place? But who played more winners more devastatingly on Labor Day? Ask McKinley. McKinley was overhitting and missing for two sets. His backhand was the target on which Reed concentrated, and for all his efforts and physical energy he did not get really into the match until Reed was ahead by 6-3, 5-3. Then, in the 10th game, he broke service for the first time, helped by two splendid backhand passes, and his upsurge took him to a lead of 6-5. But Reed continued to hound him and pound him, and there came a disastrous service game for McKinley when, double-faulting and missing three volleys. he yielded his service at love to see a two sets lead built against him. The match swung curiously in the third set after Reed had broken service to lead 2-1. Reed’s compact game cracked and, as he seemingly tired—Reed, after all, is not notorious for his strict training—it looked as though McKinley would go on for a victory. Chuck lost only one more game in taking the set and his ascendancy was maintained when Reed again lost his service in a long opening game in the fourth set. The change was dramatic. In the next game an apparently broken Reed became revitalized. As McKinley served, Reed projected back four blazing shots that left him helpless. All Reed’s genius and fire came together again and in all he gathered four games in succession with the loss of only four points. Reed did everything in the book, combining a deli- World Tennis = et Oe ie my ONES tee beewel es Bespectacled Ham Richardson was Jackie Douglas’ tough first round opposition.

Then, as he got to 5-2, falling flat on his back but winning the point as he did so, he was seized with cramp in his leg. He got up unaided but with difficulty. McKinley got a love game and then Reed served for the match with new balls. He won it at 15 as McKinley hoisted a lob that went over the baseline. Reed was the victor over America’s star player. The other seeding upset of the third round was Donald Dell’s win over Frank Froehling. Dell, the 9th ranking player in the U. S., was unseeded. Froehling had an excel- lent American season but is not in the Top Ten. Oddly, Dell did not at first look like pulling it off and he did not seem to be making much impression on the long-limbed power of Froehling who, I thought, ought to be matched against the Italian Fausto Gardini, if only to see two spiders fight- ing it out on court. Froehling had beaten Dell before and he looked like doing it again when in Froehling’s first six service games Dell succeeded in winning only two points in all. Eventually Dell got to grips with the serve and broke in the 20th game to win the first set. The pattern was repeated in the second set where Dell got the only break in the decisive 18th game. In the third, Froehling had the misfor- tune to get cramp in both legs and his resistance. became nominal. The other momentous encounter of the round was between the perpetuum mobile Rafael Osuna and that fine athletic all-rounder Eugene Scott. It grew into such a long affair that it had to be held overnight, with Scott leading 13-11, 1-6, 8-6. But he never made it the next afternoon. In the fourth set Osuna had a break in the first game, but Scott responded with one in the second. There was similar check and counter-check in the 7th and 8th games. At 4-5 Osuna was down love-30, the nearest he came to losing. Eventually he broke in the 3lst game, held his own to take this mam- moth set 17-15, and that was the end of that. Scott got no games at all in the fifth set, so Osuna carved out his win after a total of 86 games, a long, wearing match by any standards.

Bob Mark was unperturbed by the Texan Ronald Fisher, who had proved too strong the round before for the other British competitor, Roger Taylor, the Yorkshire left-hander. Roy Emerson was too quick of shot and too quick of foot for Cliff Buchholz, and Ron Holmberg handled Marty Riessen adequately. The Fourth Round In what the French usefully call the “Eighth Finals,” the survivors of the first leg were Reed, Emerson, Holmberg and Douglas. Reed did not quite find the same spark of genius that he had in the round before and Allen Fox was able to clinch the third set, Emerson rattled through against Harry Hoffman with tremendous despatch. Holmberg put paid to Jack Frost after yielding the second set. I thought Frost frail and lightweight to start, but he found himself, effected some splendid recovery shots and well merited the level pegging at one set all. But he was ground down afterwards and Holmberg was all over him in the fourth set. Douglas ran into pertinacious resistance from Crawford Henry, who took the first set. Laver continued to look the real class of the champion- ship. This time Chris Crawford acknowledged the quality and touch of the Australian’s fluent vigour. Donald Dell got home against the Australian student, John Sharpe, after missing the first set from 4-2 and taking the fourth from 3-5. Sharpe yielded his service at love when he served to make it two sets all in the tenth game. The Mexican jumping cracker, Rafael Osuna, put the seeding forecast awry in this round. He destroyed the Aus- tralian Bob Mark in three sets, three sets of rather dull lawn tennis until the end, which turned out a rather hilarious affair. One service break settled the destiny of each of the first two sets, and in the third Osuna got another to situate himself comfortably at 5-3. There followed an extraordinary game on Mark’s service during the course of which he double-faulted not once or twice but four times in winning it, saving three set points in the process. That was not all. In the next game, where Osuna was serving for the match, the Mexican took himself to match point number six with a winning drop shot. In making a vain attempt to reach the drop, Mark projected himself into the net and brought it down entangled all round him, for all the world like a big fish captured by a trawler, | thought the umpire’s pro- nouncement “There will be a momentary pause” almost unnecessary. After Mark had been unravelled and the net replaced, Osuna was a little shaky, dropped his own serve for the first time in the match and did not get home until four games later. Sangster was the last to reach the final eight, and though it was not the best tennis of the round, he certainly con- trived the most remarkable victory. It took three hours and a quarter before he beat the Mexican, Antonio Palafox. The Mexican jumping bean was his obvious nickname, and if he did not spend as much time falling about the court as standing on his feet, he surely spent more time than most people in a prone position. The first set was a mammoth 40 games. Sets like that are a bit indigestible. Service strength is all very well, but this was rather too much of a good thing and one longed for a fellow like Ken Rosewall to show what could be done with a service return. Sangster got a break in the second game and looked at first as though he might roar ahead fairly easily, but it was a long, long time before the pattern of devastating delivery changed. Eventually Sangster broke in the 40th game to win the set 21-19. That was at 6:20 p.m. Round about twilight, Sangster had a point for the second set at 6-5. He had three more at 7-6. When he was 8-7, time was called and the match resumed next morning. The following day, Sangster started badly, saw nothing of the next three World Tennis Rafael Osuna of Mexico reached the semi-finals and there played a remarkable match against Roy Emerson.

Americans, as Roy Emerson also found out in his match against Osuna, are not very nationalistic in their partisanship, but they invariably favor the underdog.

Sangster took the next two sets 6-3, 6-4. Thus, after 77 games, quite a chunk of lawn tennis, Sangster eased into the quarter-finals. The Quarter-Finals The last eight were Laver vs. Dell, Sangster vs. Douglas, Osuna vs. Reed and Emerson vs. Holmberg. The last four 18 resolved itself as Laver vs. Sangster and Osuna vs. Emerson, Thus the United States had to face the fact that the semi- finals of its own national meeting lacked an American player. To a Britisher like myself it meant little. At Wimble. don we had got pretty used to last fours without British men. It was far from being a good day for the United States, The American men popped up one by one and down they were pushed. The relative ease with which Sangster des. patched Douglas surprised me most, particularly in view of his hard finishing effort against Palafox the same morning. Sangster, however, pulled out some real heavy. weight tennis, exuded confidence and from the first played like a man who knew he could win. So far as the issue was close it was decided in the first two sets. In the third set Sangster swept over Douglas like an all-devouring tide. From 1-all there was nothing for Douglas left to do except ponder, as many other good players have done this year, on Sangster’s rise in stature during the last few months, Reed came to the end of the road—and what a happy, jolly one it was—against Osuna. Mobility is always a fine asset on the court and this Mexican has it more than most. It went well for Reed at first, for he won the first set by snatching a service break in the 14th game. Then Osuna was here, there and everywhere and it quelled rather than fed the unpredictable fires of Reed’s genius. In fact Reed was not afterwards in the match to any really serious degree. Then there was Holmberg. Here also there was lightning speed of foot on the other side, carrying Emerson nimbly about the court. For two sets Holmberg tried in vain to stop him without much success. In the third I thought he had bad rather than good luck. He was able to break service to build a lead of 4-1 and in the ordinary course of things, having first been 5-2, he served for the set at 5-3. At 30-40 he served a ball that Emerson thought was a let and the rally petered out in that half-hearted fashion that often happens when players and the officials are not with each other. On the face of it the score was deuce and thus the umpire called. Emerson put forward his point of view and there was something of a discussion before the umpire called a let after all. Holmberg’s concentration disappeared during the course of it all and Emerson rippled away not only with that game but with the next three to earn his win in three sets. Dell put up a good show against Laver. For most of the match his first service worked superbly and his volleying was equally good. He came as near as anyone to equating his form with that of the super class of the Wimbledon Champion. He led 4-2 in the first set and came within a stroke of being 5-2. He could not make it and Laver had the set 6-4. Dell, unperturbed, kept going to win the second 9-7 and thus to record the first set won against Laver in the Championship. It was, in fact, the first time Laver had been extended. Laver with the stops out, though, was irre- sistible and the next two sets went to the Australian. The Semi-Finals Emerson beat Osuna in the most exciting match thus far at the meeting. It was a contest which Osuna bravely extended for two hours without ever getting the lead. It was played between the two fleetest-foot men in the tournament. What was so remarkable about it was that Emerson began with a brilliance of virtuosity that, on the face of it, ought to have taken him to the quickest victory ever. He was like a man in a hurry to catch a train. His service—I doubt if he had to project a second serve at that time—was tremendous. It overwhelmed Osuna utterly, as it would have done any player except maybe Ken Rosewall. He was fast and sure and projected thunderbolts all round. In his first seven service games Emerson yielded only three points.

OR i) Oe sets up and looking as if he would be in the final in about a further fifteen. The cessation of Emerson’s entire service dominance could be pinpointed from the fifth game of the second set. There was an extraordinary rally then when Osuna fell flat on his back and still contrived to play a winning volley double-handed by playing the ball virtually from the tip of his nose as he lay prostrate. In the next game Emerson was held to deuce on his service for the first time. Osuna never lost heart and in the third set the pattern changed drastically. Emerson grew more obviously careful with his shots. The Australian helped himself with a double-fault to lose his service in the 4th game, and that was sufficient to give the set to Osuna. When in the third game of the fourth set Emerson, again contributing a double-fault, lost his service at love, one became aware for the first time that an Osuna victory was a possibility. The Australian recovered and, from 2-4, led again at 5-4. In the next game spectators had their fill of drama. Osuna lapsed to 15-40, match point, on his service. He projected a service winner to save it. Another service winner salvaged the second match point. Then the ad- vantage went against Osuna and this time he forced an Aus- tralian volley error to keep alive after his third match point. Emerson’s reaction was not perhaps surprising. Osuna broke in the 11th game and rode out easily with the set for two sets all. In turn the reaction from events hit him. Osuna fell behind 0-3. Emerson was not yet hearty enough to keep the lead and Osuna broke back for 3-all. For the next 9 games, all tense with the uncertainty of the issue, service held undisputed power. Finally Osuna could take it no longer. Three fine passing shots from Emerson brought him to love-40 and a moment later Emerson had won the match and his place in the final. As for the semi-final between Laver and Sangster, there was one game which deserves to be written about on its own. This was the 5th game of the third set when Sangster was love-40, He served. Period. There was a thump and I suppose the linesman caught some sight of the ball. 1 doubt whether Laver did. It really was a cannon ball delivery plus. In all Sangster (who a little later dealt another almost as fast) pounded down five aces in saving the game. But what a delivery! One hundred and fifty miles an hour? No one World Tennis Donald Dell (facing camera) upset seeded Frank Froehling (at net), then teok a set off Laver in the quarter-finals. Froeh- ling, an eager, rather awkward youngster, is the most excit- ing young player to come up out of the ranks this year. He looks like a stork with his long legs and with his cap, which resembles a bird's bill. He has an excellent service, fine match playing ability, he covers court well and he works hard.

I have never seen (or, rather, heard) anything so fast, at least not since the days of my youth when Ellsworth Vines projected that famous cannon ball that won him the Wimbledon Champion- ship against Bunny Austin in 1932, when poor Austin did not know which side of him the ball went. Laver won in three sets, all of which were distinguished by Sangster’s heroic delivery. But in the rest of his game he was no match for the Australian whose backhand was a constant source of delight. One stroke could not bring down the complete game of Laver; it could only contain it. In theory Sangster could have won either of the first two sets since he had service breaks in each. It was quite something to see the reigning Wimbledon Champion standing yards back behind the baseline every time Sangster poised for his first delivery. The Final The all-Australian final, Laver against Emerson, was nothing new. It was, in fact, the fifth such in six years. In 1960 it was Fraser against Laver, in 1958 Cooper against Anderson, in 1957 Anderson against Cooper, and in 1956 Rosewall against Hoad. Emerson’s final victory in three sets over Laver was surprising in the sense that from the start of the meeting few would have been prepared to lay odds against his not winning. The prestige and merits of his performance at Wimbledon demanded that he be the overwhelming favourite. Yet when Emerson had got his unexpectedly easy win one recalled how things had worked out in important other meetings between them. There was the final of the Australian Championships in January. Emerson won that one, though only marginally. Then there was the final of the British Hard Court Championship at the end of April. Emerson won that in three sets. He won it in fact more or less as he did this at Forest Hills, though the first set was a longer one. Laver was not at his peak. There was a slightly jaded air about him. The more acute sharpness was on the other side. Above all, there 20 was that wonderful mobility of Emerson, enabling him to streak across the court and fire away with the killing winner from nowhere. The match ran in Emerson’s favour all through. He had a service break in the fourth game of the first set and with this pressed on to a lead of 5-2. This Laver resisted stoutly, saving a set point in the eighth game and one more in the next when Emerson served for the set but failed to get it. Then, having hauled up to 5-all, Laver fell away again, yielding his service in the 12th game with a double-fault! Even at this point, though, one had the impression Laver might find his full genius and come back into the match. Emerson saved a nasty situation when he came up from love-40 on his own serve in the third game of the second set through a fabulous volleying effort. Emerson then broke through Laver in the fourth game. That settled the destiny of the set. Two sets up, Emerson got really ahead with another break in the fifth game of the third set. Laver then virtually gave up the battle and Emerson, who had been 1-2, took the match and title by winning five games in sequence. A good, fast champion had come through. DARLENE HARD WINS THE WOMEN'S SINGLES by MARY HARDWICK Every international event this year has been dominated by the girls.

At Forest Hills only the magnificent Brazilian, Maria Bueno, was missing. Present were defending Champion Dariene Hard; Wimbledon Champion Angela Mortimer and runner-up Christine Truman; French Champion Ann Hay- don and runner-up Yola Ramirez; Australian Champion Margaret Smith and runner-up Jan Lehane; the runner-up in the Italian Championships, Lesley Turner; and the vic- torious members of the U. S. Wightman Cup team. The Early Rounds The best of the early round matches was played between Yola Ramirez, who was seeded No. 8, and Edda Buding of Germany, unseeded. It was unfortunate that these two— the dancing Senorita from South of the Border, a player of great talent and appeal, and the delightfully feminine European—had to meet so soon. They put on one of the most attractive matches ever seen on the Stadium. The young Fraulein was tentative and uncertain in the opening set. Ramirez, an experienced and very shrewd competitor, had complete control with her long, sweeping drives and fluent footwork and took the first set decisively. But the German girl soon lost her stage fright and the complexion of the match was suddenly altered. Edda drove to the corners, hitting with amazing depth, particularly on the backhand. This was the groundstroke game at its finest— sparkling rallies intermingled with delicate drop shots. Edda led 5-1 and 5-2. Here Yola tried soft-balling to slow down the pace, but Edda won the second set almost as easily as Yola had taken the first. In the third set, the rather more determined Senorita tightened up her game, and with lovely, free hitting she went to 5-2. Edda made it to 5-3 and extended Yola to seven match points before she double-faulted at the finale. The gallery enjoyed every minute of the play in which points were won via drop shots, lobs, long drives and short angles. with each girl chasing down every ball despite the humid 90° temperature. Gwyn Thomas had a good victory over vastly improved Marilyn Montgomery. Marilyn took the first set but lost her chances early in the second when she failed to press home her advantage. However, she impressed the clubhouse crowd with her magnificently aggressive game, from her big forehand to her heavy volley. Other matches that stood out were Yola Ramirez’s first round victory over Carol Hanks, the latter showing marked maturity over last year’s play; Jan Lehane’s decisive victory over Margaret Varner. who is always a tough competitor; and Donna Floyd’s victory over Peachy Kellmeyer, a lovely girl and a wonder- ful sport. Belmar Gunderson used variations of pace, spin and length to extend Lesley. Turner, seeded No. 6, to 6-4 in the third. Another exceptional match was played between two Californians, Carole Caldwell and Kathy Chabot, with the former reaching match point before bowing. Both girls were very strong from the baseline, but Kathy was a bit the steadier. Judy Alvarez of Florida scored over Robyn Ebbern, the Australian Junior, after being 1-4 down in the first set. Margaret Smith, the Australian Champion, whom I believe is destined to be one of tennisdom’s immortals. reveled in the heat and humidity as she lost only five games on her road to the quarter-finals. Karen Hanze and Christine Truman had difficulty getting by two of America’s best Juniors. Karen had three hard sets with Justina Bricka, and Christine had three equally hard sets with Billie Jean Moffitt. Justina started off in meteor fashion. Her left-handed serve and sweeping fore- hand penetrated Karen’s rather uncertain groundstroke defense. The young girl from Missouri was the better in every department, especially in concentration, and she went World Tennis Angela Mortimer is not impressive in her strokes, but she is a real match player who uses the entire court like a chess board.

Judy’s only weakness is on the forehand, which she underspins or pushes when the going is tough. Her ground game and volley are excellent. Photo, Trostorff. 21 5 TI a BOR CPs = Darlene Hard was never better than in the last three rounds of the tournament. In the final round her service was superb. She was guilty of only two tight deliveries and one double- fault during the entire match. She did not serve many aces, ra but she came through with a lot of winners. Margaret Smith, the Australian Champion, is a big, strong girl who hits very hard, volleys extremely well and moves beautifully. Her game seems slightly taught, particularly on the backhand, where she sometimes twists around so that she almost faces the backstop. She played without nerves in the Championships, and many predict that she will be World Champion in another year.

She epitom- izes the plucky type. Photos, Schroeder. ahead at 6-2. Karen struggled to find her range against her aggressive opponent, who was in much better physical condition than the No. 3 seed. But the Californian’s natural match playing sense stood her in good stead. It was a patchy second set. Both girls made startling winners intermingled with loose shots, and the rallies were lacking in any tactical plan. One could feel the tension of both players. Justina lost the set (Karen did not win it) because the young left- hander was so eager to take the net that often she rushed in on bad approach shots or on short serves. What might have been a fine victory ended in defeat for Miss Bricka because of the better generalship of the Californian. Christine Truman, seeded No. 4, repeated her Wightman Cup victory over Billie Jean Moffitt, but this time the U. S. Junior took her to three sets. Christine started firmly, and her severe groundstrokes gave her the first set against an erratic Miss Moffitt. In the second stanza, the Californian continued to press at net and began to return service well. She made some amazing volleys and half-volleys as she forged ahead to 5-0. Christine so often appears to relax after playing a good first set, but from 0-5 down she pulled up to 3-5 and withstood two set points before Billie Jean levelled the score at set-all. Despite the heat and the humidity, the girls did not take the ten minute rest. Then the greater groundstroke strength and calm determination of the British girl put her in the lead. At 0-3 the Californian fell apart. I hope that one day she will learn control of her vast array of shots as well as her exuberant temperament. There was much discussion at Forest Hills this year on court demeanor. The USLTA is endeavoring to eliminate bad manners, but in doing so they may become overzealous, stifling individualism and youthful high spirits. None of us want a game played by robots. However, it is time that the players took stock of themselves.

England, Margaret Smith of Australia and their respective teammates exemplify good sportsmanship, and their be- havior is a shining example to the younger players. The Third Round In reaching the quarter-finals, Ann Haydon, Margaret Smith and Christine Truman had relatively easy wins over Carole Wright, Marion Boundy (an English girl now living in Canada) and Gwyn Thomas respectively. Lesley Turner had her hands full with Donna Floyd, who played her best match of the year as she bowed 6-4, 7-5. Angela Mortimer was down 1-3 and point for 1-4 against Kathy Chabot. Although petite Kathy played well, Angela was too steady and precise and she won 6-3, 6-2. The three big matches of this round were Judy Alvarez-Darlene Hard, Yola Ramirez- Dejdre Catt and Jan Lehane-Karen Hantze. Miss Alvarez, a Florida Junior, is a notoriously slow starter. Coupled with this was the tension of playing the Champion. But Judy, one set down, tightened up her game and her piercing groundstrokes began to find their range. She repeatedly passed Darlene Hard off both wings and took the second set 6-4. After the rest period it again took Judy four or five games to find her range. At 1-4 she began to hit the corners again and she almost managed to pull up before Darlene closed out at 6-4. Deidre Catt was playing Yela Ramirez an equally ex- citing match on the adjoining clubhouse court. Both matches were close and tense, and the noise from the clubhouse terrace made it difficult for both the umpires and the players. In both these matches the poor umpires did not have a single linesman to assist them. It was most unfortunate in a National Championship. Yola played well against Deidre, sweeping through the first set.

Yola Ramirez has an annending game in every department except service. She throws the ball way too high and too much behind her, and she turns her body around too far. She is murderous on the forehand, which is hit with overspin, she underslices her very accurate backhand, and she can run all day. Photos, Schroeder. 24 with Ramirez. The latter then broke serve and took the match 6-1, 7-5. The Quarter-Finals It has been a good many years since the U. S. was repre. sented by only one player in the quarter-finals. It is a tribute to the strength of the other nations rather than to any real weakness among the Americans. England was repre- sented by her three leading players—Ann, Christine and Angela—and Australia by her three best—Margaret, Lesley and Jan. Mexico had smiling Senorita Yola Ramirez, and the U. S. was represented by defending Champion Darlene Hard. Darlene was at her best as she beat Yola 6-3, 6-1. Every shot in her wide repertoire was functioning smoothly and she seemed in good physical condition. Yola’s fluent and steady game could not penetrate the net attack of the Cham. pion. Only a few double-faults marred Darlene’s perfect play, but in each case they were followed by unreturnable serves. The Wimbledon Champion, Angela Mortimer, was also at her best as she defeated young Lesley Turner. The latter played well until 3-all. Then the ‘chessboard tactics and ball control of the English girl proved too much for the Aus- tralian. Angela won 6-3, 6-4 in a victory as complete as Darlene’s. Ann Haydon had much more difficulty in overcoming Jar Lehane. It was a long ding- dong baseline match in whicl both girls had game points in the first set on every game which. they lost! “Tt was interesting to watch, although almost devoid of volleying. Ann took the first set and Jan, after lead- ing 5-3 in the second, managed to take this stanza at 7-5. Hay don returned to the court after a ten minute rest looking refreshed and confident while Jan appeared weary and frail. The battle was soon over and England had two girls in the semi-finals. The Truman-Smith match was one of the finest battles ever seen in the Stadium. Both girls were at their peak during the long first set and both gave their all in every department. Chris began her attack on the very first point and she never let up. She scrambled, ran and lunged, and she never seemed fitter or quicker. Margaret was the more delicate of touch and the more subtle in her approach. She displayed much dignity and presence in her first real test in the Stadium. It was a stirring match and it was sad to see either girl lose. It was especially unfortunate for Chris- tine since she had beaten Margaret at Wimbledon after being two match points down, but here both girls played even better than in England. Christine dominated from the net, but Margaret also came in whenever possible. It was a struggle between Christine’s power and Margaret’s wider range of shots and greater versatility. In the first set Margaret led by 5-4, 6-5, 7-6 and 8-7. She was making full use of the lob and of her magnificent backhand down the line. She had two set points on Chris’ serve, losing one on a lob over the baseline and another on Truman’s service power. Chris took this wonderfully fought set at 10-8. Margaret opened the second set with two double- faults, and a calm Chris went to 4-2 and 0-40 on Margaret’s serve. The match seemed over. Suddenly the Australian tightened her defense, saved the game and went from strength to strength. Christine began to miss her volleys and overhit on forehands. Suddenly it was set for the Aus- tralian. Truman never again got into the lead. Margaret’s fluent strokes, especially her glorious backhand, tied Chris up in knots. Smith ended the match with two service aces, a wonderful volley and another service ace. Two of the shots hit a bump on the turf, but they were clean aces nevertheless. It was a great victory for Australia. The Semi-Finals Darlene Hard began confidently against Margaret Smith.

The young Australian Champion was uncertain, albeit composed, and from 2-4 she oon drew level at 4-4. However, Margaret repeatedly failed to get her first serve in with any consistency, and the extra pressure which Darlene applied put Margaret on the de- fensive. Darlene also used change of pace to prevent the Australian from getting any rhythm. The American took the first set 6-4. Margaret was not playing as well as she had against Christine. This was undoubtedly due to the tenseness of the occasion, her unfamiliarity with Darlene’s game and the fact that the Champion was playing very well indeed. Smith managed to take the second set, but a confident Miss Hard dominated in the third. Darlene went into the final by scores of 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. In the other half, Angela Mortimer was beaten by Ann Haydon. These two English girls have played each other more times than they can remember. The match was held in the Grandstand (Sangster and Laver were in the Stadi- um), but the large crowd watching the girls proved that the Forest Hills crowd is interested in women’s tennis and does enjoy variation in the program. Angela went ahead for 4-2. Here came a close line de- cision, with the umpire calling the score incorrectly. The point was replayed and Ann won the game for 4-3. The incident seemed to break Angela’s concentration. She lost aer control, served two double-faults and played two poor games. Ann went ahead for 5-4. The Wimbledon Champion never regained her composure and Haydon won the first set 6-4 with rather patchy tennis. Ann now dominated the match and Angela’s game disintegrated completely. It was, in fact, a very sad affair—almost inexplicable—although a splendid victory for Haydon. The Final Darlene successfully defended her title, playing the finest tennis of her distinguished career as she beat Ann Haydon 6-3, 6-4. She was strong throughout the entire Championship and she won her second title because her tennis was of a higher order than that of any other competitor. She has a complete range of strokes, and her match-playing qualities, touch and all-round ability have no peer in the amateur game today. The tenseness and double-faults so typical of her game in early years have disappeared. Both girls started out well and the first game was perhaps the best of the entire match. Ann began with two perfect passing shots. She then hit a glorious topspin lob over the Champion’s head. But Darlene was serving extraordinarily well, and after both girls had game point Miss Hard’s greater power gave her the game. The American attacked consistently and went ahead to 4-1. Much of this time Ann was searching the Marquee for a glimpse of her teammates and her captain. They finally arrived as Ann won the 6th game for 2-4. Darlene pressed on ‘and, by the superior quality of her play and attack, took the first set 6-3. Ann never gave up. She tried coming to net, drop shots and lobs, but her shots never had enough sting to penetrate her opponent’s volleying attack. At 5-3 the Champion had three match points. Ann hung on gal- lantly to save the game. She then had a point for 5-all. Here Darlene tightened for the first time in the match. On her fourth match point, she literally pushed in her second serve. Haydon hit a deep forehand down the line which Hard half-volleyed for a forehand crosscourt placement and the title. She left no doubt in anyone’s mind that she was the master, The Men’s Seniors To the surprise of no one, the youthful Gar Mulloy took his third senior title by beating Chauncey Steele in the final. The latter was the only one to extend the Floridian during the entire tournament, and he actually had a set point in the first set before bowing 7-5, 6-1. Gardnar still possesses World Tennis Mane see. Re eS Christine Truman of England is a most interesting player to watch. She whales at the ball on her forehand but hits her backhand with far too much underspin. Her favorite way of playing a point is to hit a good forcing shot, run full steam to the net and then hit the volley with all her might. one of the finest forehands in the game and could have been a match for most of the players had he been permitted to play in the men’s singles. The first surprise of the senior event occurred in the second round when Robert Biddle defeated Reggie Weir after dropping the first set 0-6. Biddle was decisively beaten in the third round by Morris Adelsberg. The two losing semi-finalists were Robert Nihousen and Frank Thompson. Nihousen eliminated Florida’s strong Jack Staton and Phila- delphia’s youthful Harry Hoffmann, while Thompson ac- counted for John Kunit and Bill Lurie. Larry Shippey, a cagey player, extended Steele to three sets in the third round, the third set being closer than the 6-3 score. The Women’s Seniors Dodo Bundy Cheney of California and Kay Hubbell of Massachusetts were the favored contenders in this title for women 40 and over. Dodo, who always makes a match of it against California’s leading champions, was upset by visitor Nell Hopman of Australia by 6-4, 6-4 in the quarter-finals. Neil keeps herself in excellent condition, and her heady, steady play proved too much for the beauti- ful groundstrokes and attacking game of Mrs. Cheney. Mrs. Hopman then defeated Charlotte Lee in the semi-finals 8-6, 6-3. Kay Hubbell, who is also an active contender in women’s events and a particularly fine grass court player, then won the title on the clubhouse court by defeating Mrs. Hopman 7-5, 6-3.

National Championships. The Characters: Former British Wightman Cup player Mary Hardwick, Carole Caldwell and Kathy Chabot of Southern California, Peachy Kellmeyer of West Virginia, Julie M. Heldman oj New York City, and the W. T. Reporter. Four of them are ordering lunch and two of them are having breakfast. They are discussing the National Junior Championships, which was won by 16- year old Vicki Palmer over highly fa- vored Billie Jean Moffitt. Mary: What amazed me most about this year’s tournament, other than the terrible weather, was the enormous wealth of talent. Billie Jean, who was seeded No. 1, had just defeated Ann Haydon, the French Champion in Wightman Cup play, and yet Billie Jean didn’t win the Juniors. And Justina Bricka, who beat the Wimbledon Cham- pion, Angela Mortimer, in Wightman Cup, was only seeded No. 5. Were there any upsets in the first round, Julie? Julie: Three of the foreign players lost. Elsie Spruyt of Holland was beaten by Ebbern; Anja LePoutre, another Dutch girl, went out to Stephanie De- Fina; and Vicki Berner of Canada was beaten by Chris Safford, 6-3, 15-13. Mary: Chris has improved a lot. She was just an alternate on the Junior Wightman Cup Squad, but she stayed here all week to practice with the girls who made the Squad. So did Lynn Haines, another alternate. They both worked very hard and were extremely cooperative. Julie: 1 forgot to mention another fabulous girl who went out the first day —my sister.

Kathy: Faye Urban has a tremendous forehand, Carole: And a lot of enthusiasm. That’s true of all the Canadians. Mary: They have a wonderful Junior ‘Development program and their im- provement in one year has been incredi- ble. They are also very nice girls. Julie: Have you ever noticed that Ur- ban plays better in the afternoon? Kathy: | noticed that she plays better in the second set. She must have been born at midnight. Peachy: Another top seed who was beaten was Mary Habicht. She lost to Cathy Lee Crosby. It was a very long match and a very good one. Julie: It was also a choky one. Kathy: | didn’t think so. Carole: They both gave it everything. Kathy: The grass was wet from the rain, and you know what soft grass is. They started to warm up, then it rained, and when they went back on the court, Cathy Lee decided that she would get her serve in any old way just so she could get to net. She knew she couldn’t hit any ground strokes on the wet grass Mary: How did Robyn Ebbern of Australia do? Carole: Billie Jean told me that Robyn wasn’t playing as well here as she did in Europe. She has an undercut back- hand, a tremendous forehand and a very good serve. Kathy: 1 beat her 6-4, 7-5. It was a good match and it was close all the way. | I got every ball in and waited for her to miss. I also managed to hit a few vol- leys. I thought she ran well and volleyed | well. Peachy: Everybody liked her. She got along well with the American Juniors. Mary: She loved playing here. Carole: This year the girls were much closer than they were last year. WT Reporter: Who did you think was going to win? Carole: Billie Jean or Justina. Kathy: | thought it would be Vicki Palmer or Billie Jean. I favored the | latter because she had both the game and the prestige. Mary: But there has to be a reaction after playing Wightman Cup. There is not only the mental let-down after win- ning a great international match, but Billie Jean was switching from clay to grass. Besides, Margaret duPont was in great part responsible for the téam vic- tory, and Margaret wasn’t at the Juniors to lend Billie Jean support. Kathy: Vicki isn’t playing at Forest Hills this week, but if she were, I think she would have suffered the same kind of let-down. Peachy: Vicki was great. She also had the best draw. World Tennis SAVE , The four Juniors who competed at Delaware are (I to r) runner-up Julie Heldman, semi-finalists Carol Southmayd and Peachy Kellmeyer, and winner Linda George. Julie: She met Lynn in the 16s, Cathy Lee in the quarters and you, Kathy, in the semis. Kathy: 1 have lost to Vicki in almost every national tournament in which I have played. She beat me my first year in the Girls and my last two years in the Juniors. One year, though, I lost to Nancy Richey. Peachy: When you played her this year, Kathy, you couldn’t hit your fore- hand on your second serve. I thought you played a terrific match against her the week before at Germantown. You beat her 8-6 in the third. Carole: Vicki is grunting less when she hits the ball. Peachy: You never notice it if you play her. The only time I am ever con- scious of it is when I am playing on the court next to her. Kathy: Vicki is such a wonderfully fair opponent. I’d rather play her than any of the other Juniors. Mary: Tell me about the Judy Alvarez- Moffitt match. Carole: Billie Jean played very well. She was keyed up for the match and out to win. Mary: Has Judy improved? Carole: A great deal. Fk should know because I was her victim. We played the week before the Juniors in the Inter- sectionals. I was very confident because of last year. I lost the first set. I tried to pull myself together, but by that time she had too big a lead. In the National Juniors, I won the first set 6-1 and was playing very well. Then she got better in the second set while I went down. The third could have gone either way. Mary: Julie, I heard about your match with Billie Jean. Weren’t you leading 1-3 in the third? Julie: Yes, it was 4-3, 30-all, my serve, and the wind was with me, but that’s a long way from winning. Peachy: The match was put on a back court without linesmen or an umpire. Kathy: 4-3, 30-all, That’s six points from match. Julie: But I never had the match under control, which was why I didn’t think I would win. The score said 4-3, but I wasn’t on top. Mary: Carol Prosen didn’t play much this summer because she was at the Chase Camp. How did she do? Peachy: She lost badly to Kathy Cha- bot. Kathy: Carol was having trouble with her appendix. At 5-0 she clutched her stomach. Julie: Her stomach bothered her dur- ing the Intersectionals. Carole: I had that last year. It turned out that I was eating too much fruit and iced tea. I told that to Carol and she thought that might be the cause. Mary: Peachy, to whom did you lose? Peachy: Carole Caldwell. Julie: It was a slippery court. Carole: Yes, the grass was wet, which gave me the advantage. Peachy is at her best on clay. I hit the ball deep and tried to keep her moving. Peachy: I could never get set for the ball. Mary: What was the best match of the tournament? Carole: There were so many fine ones. Judy and I had a good one. Peachy: Unfortunately the semis weren’t very good. Vicki beat Chabot and Billie Jean went through Alvarez. Kathy: Yes, both matches were one- sided. Mary: Vicki is a pretty good Cham- 27 pion, and she has two more years in which to win it. Kathy: She deserved the title. Mary: Let’s discuss some of the other girls. The Crosby sisters make a nice impression. Carole: They are great girls. Julie: Whom did they lose to in the doubles? Peachy: They were beaten by Palmer and Alvarez. Kathy: They are both good teams. Mary: And how about Carol Hanks? Julie: She lost to Billie Jean in the quarters in a pretty good match. Hanks had a bad season this year, but I hope she has a good season in 1962 because she is the nicest girl on the circuit. Kathy: The grass was quite wet in their match. Carole: Billie Jean was tired because she had taken cold pills and was groggy as a result. I thought she was run down from all her travels. Kathy: What you just said is true of most of the Californians—except for me. Practically our whole team was ill. They play too many weeks living out of a suitcase and picking up meals here and there. Juniors can’t take 10 weeks on the circuit. Mary: Kathy, that’s an extremely ma- ture remark. Julie: If you look out the window, you can see my sister Carrie playing Judy Alvarez on Court 17. (Everyone looks out window.) Julie (in an aside to WT Reporter): I always make wild remarks about matches and nobody ever agrees with me. Mary: They’re not wild. They are analytical. Julie: Well, then, I’d like to insert a plug for my partner, Lynn Haines. Mary: She is very much improved. Peachy: She practices more than any of the other girls. Kathy: Yes, she practices almost as much as Gwyn Thomas. Mary: But some girls just don’t prac- tice well when they are out on the court. Julie: I can sometimes practice with a pretty good player and get nothing out of it. Mary: You should have a plan. Don’t just go out there and hit. Julie: Lynn and I practice well to- gether. Mary: What all of you should do is stand at net for five minutes and volley balls at each other. Peachy: There are some players I would rather just hit with and there are some I would rather play a set against. Kathy: I have no plan when I prac- tice. Carole: In Santa Monica, I used to play against the Ballboy machine while my mother fed balls to it. I was twisting too much on the backhand and I wanted 28 \\ aiid ee i: The new Champion, Vicki Palmer, is only 16 and has two more years of eligibility in the Juniors.

Karen: | hear all it did was rain at the Juniors. Mary: Did you think that Vicki would win, Karen? Karen: | thought that Billie Jean had the edge. (To Julie) 1 read that you almost beat her. Julie (embarrassed): Well... Karen: The Juniors took almost as long to play as Wimbledon. (Karen and Rod leave.) Carole: Isn’t Karen a cute girl? Kathy: Vd love to go to their wedding. Julie: Where is it going to be? Peachy: San Antonio. Mary: How were the doubles? Carole: Billie Jean and I lost to Palm- er and Alvarez in the final. They are an awfully good team. We won the first set and they took the second. We didn’t take a rest before the third. . . Kathy: . . . because it was getting so late. Carole: | played my best in the first but was spotty in the second and third. Then, too, I think that Billie Jean was tired. Mary: Palmer and Alvarez are a good team. They hit hard and firmly. Julie: The doubles draw was strange. Justina had to default because of her arm, which put the Crosbys in the semis. Linda George and Andria Miller, whom I consider a good team, had to play Palmer and Alvarez in the first round. Mary: Andria Miller plays quite nice- ly. Julie: She has a pretty good serve. Carole: But it isn’t consistent enough. Julie: She wasn’t serving well at the Juniors. Carole: She would be good if she had confidence in her serve. She double. faulted a lot because she was rushing her backswing. She’s a pretty steady player, but it was her first year on grass, Mary: Who’s eligible to play in the National Juniors next year? Peachy: Linda George, Cathy Lee Crosby, Julie .. . Julie: Vicki, Lynn Haines and Peachy WT Reporter: I notice all of you say “Juniors” when the official title ig “Girls.” We get complaints from of. ficials because we refer to the tourna. ment as “The Juniors.” Kathy: I remember the poll that} * Wortp Tennis did on the terminology, ) Z# and practically every player said they call the Juniors the"
