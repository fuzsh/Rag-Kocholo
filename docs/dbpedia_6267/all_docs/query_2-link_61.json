        "text": "George Best is a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a winger, spending most of his club career at Manchester United F.C..\n\nNamed European Footballer of the Year in 1968, he is regarded as one of the greatest players of all time. A highly skillful winger, considered by several pundits to be one of the greatest dribblers in the history of the sport, George Best received plaudits for his playing style, which combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to get past defenders.\n\nIn international football, George Best was capped 37 times for Northern Ireland National Football Team between 1964 and 1977, scoring nine goals. He is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have played at a World Cup.\n\nOne of the world's greatest all-round cricketers, and an undoubted world class player in the England sides of the 1980s, whose ability to turn the course of a game with either bat or ball was best seen in the 1981 series against Australia. In 102 Test Matches for England he scored 5200 runs, including 14 centuries, and took 383 wickets, including his best performance of 8 for 34 runs. In 116 One-Day Internationals he scored 2113 runs, his best being 79, and took 145 wickets, his best being 4 for 31 runs.\n\nSir Robert Charlton is an English former footballer who played either as a midfielder or a forward. Considered one of the greatest players of all time, he was a member of the England team that won the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the year he also won the Ballon d'Or. He played almost all of his club football at Manchester United, where he became renowned for his attacking instincts, his passing abilities from midfield and his ferocious long-range shot, as well as his fitness and stamina. He was cautioned only twice in his career; once against Argentina in the 1966 World Cup, and once in a league match against Chelsea. His elder brother Jack, who was also in the World Cup-winning team, was a former defender for Leeds United and international manager.\n\nWhen talking about the greatest race driver of all time, various opinions will throw out such great drivers as Mario Andretti, Tazio Nuvolari, A.J. Foyt, Juan Manuel Fangio or Ayrton Senna; but most may agree that Scotsman Jim Clark was probably the best of them all. The shy British racer lived to race and proved it with two Formula One World Championships and an Indy 500 title. After he won the final Formula 1 race of his career at South Africa, he was killed in minor Formula 2 race when he lost control of his car, after a suspected tire failure, and hit a tree (as there were no guard rails to protect him). He was killed instantly and the racing world mourned losing one of its greatest.\n\nSebastian Coe is a British politician and former track and field athlete.\n\nAs a middle-distance runner, Coe won four Olympic medals, including the 1500 meters gold medal at the Olympic Games in 1980 and 1984. He set nine outdoor and three indoor world records in middle-distance track events - including, in 1979, setting three world records in the space of 41 days - and the world record he set in the 800 meters in 1981 remained unbroken until 1997.\n\nFollowing Coe's retirement from athletics, he was a member of parliament for the Conservative Party from 1992 to 1997 for Falmouth in Cornwall, and became a Life Peer on 16 May 2000.\n\nHe headed the successful London bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and became chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. In 2007, he was elected a vice-president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), and re-elected for another four-year term in 2011. In August 2015, he was elected president of the IAAF.\n\nIn 2012, Coe was appointed Pro-Chancellor at Loughborough University where he had been an undergraduate, and is a member of the University's governing body. In November 2012, he was appointed chairman of the British Olympic Association.\n\nDuncan Edwards is an English footballer who played for Manchester United F.C. and the England National Football Team. He was one of The Busby Babes, the young United team formed under manager Matt Busby in the mid-1950s, playing 177 matches for the club. One of eight players who died as a result of the Munich air disaster, he survived initially but succumbed to his injuries in hospital two weeks later.\n\nBorn in Woodside, Dudley, Edwards signed for Manchester United F.C. as a teenager and went on to become the youngest player to play in the Football League First Division and at the time the youngest England player since the Second World War, going on to play 18 times for his country at top level. In a professional career of less than five years he helped United to win two Football League championships and two FA Charity Shields, and reach the semi-finals of the European Cup."
