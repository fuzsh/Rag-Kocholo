        "text": "THOSE WHO DIDN’T MAKE IT\n\nWe could start with the Englishman James Baily, who became the first Briton to win a Junior Grand Slam after 28 years at the 1993 Australian Open (the last one had been Gerald Battrick at the Roland Garros, 1965). All eyes were on him, and the expectations grew dramatically when the English newspapers highlighted that the list of previous champions of the junior event included Rod Laver, Ken Rosewell, John Newcombe and Stefan Edberg. This situation put a lot of pressure on him, and he was overwhelmed, leading the country to completely forget about him, just like had happened with Stanley Matthews Jr, who won Wimbledon 1962 but is only remembered for being the son of the great football player. Eighteen months later, Baily would stop playing.\n\nAlexandre Sidorenko was born in St. Petersburg but represented France. He won the Australian Open in 2006, but as a pro he played only two Grand Slam tournaments as a wildcard, at the French Open in 2007 and 2009 – in the latter occasion, he was defeated in the first round by his hero Marat Safin. In 2015, he played in the Italian A2 league, just before quitting tennis in 2017, at 29.\n\nThe Australian-born Brit Brydan Klein won the AO in 2007. It seemed a good start for him because in the same year he won his first Futures (the first of 20, the last one coming in March in Mildura). In 2009, he won his first-round match at the Australian Open but Wawrinka put an end to his dreams. The same year, he won his only ATP Challenger tournament, again in Australia. It seemed the beginning of a good career, but it was downhill from there. Unfortunately, in the following years he went on a slow and inexorable decline. He was also given a six-month ban after racially abusing Raven Klaasen during a match at Eastbourne. Currently, he is 31, ranked 385th, and hasn’t played after the tour’s Coronavirus hiatus.\n\nThe Spaniard Carlos Cuadrado won in Paris in 2001 but went on to only win one Futures tournament the same year. Aged 22, he pulled the plug and ran away to Australia, where he become a successful coach (for Daniela Hantuchova, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Anastasia Pavlychenkova) before one more radical reinvention in 2019: he decided to travel around the world on a sailing boat!\n\nClement Morel won the 2002 Australian Open, beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semi-finals. The highest point of his professional career were two Futures titles won respectively in 2006 and 2008, the year he switched nationalities and began representing Monaco – he played two Davis Cup ties for the Principate. At the end of his career, he elected to continue his studies at the Lyon Business School: he is now the commercial director of Wilson in France and Belgium.\n\nHave you ever heard of the Czech David Skoch, the Boys’ Wimbledon champion in 1992? Maybe some doubles fans… like, real die-hard ones.\n\nThe Brazilian Tiago Fernandes won the Australian Open in 2010, ending the season at the top of the junior ranking. In 2014, he announced his retirement to focus on his university work after earning a prize money of 22,000 dollars, not enough even for tuition fees.\n\nOliver Golding won the Australian Open in 2011 and clinched six Futures tournaments, the last of which in 2017 in Piombino, Italy. More “brilliant” was his acting career: he made his debut as a child in “Homecoming” (1998) before appearing in British TV series “Kate and Emma” and “Keen Eddie” – we can honestly say that he hasn’t reached the top in any of his career activities.\n\nBelarusian Uladzimir Ignatik was the protagonist of the 2007 season when he won Roland Garros and was a finalist at Wimbledon. However, his best career ranking was a meagre N.137. He’s never featured in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, and he only became famous for a record set against him in 2012 – his opponent Sam Groth hit the fastest recorded tennis serve of all time at 263 km/ph.\n\nAussie Luke Saville won Wimbledon and was runner-up in Australia in 2011. The following year he won the Australian Open and lost the Wimbledon final. A future great? His career after that indicates that this isn’t the case.\n\nFrenchman Julien Jeanpierre won both the single and the doubles tournament at the Australian Open in 1998, beating Federer, Nalbandian and Hewitt. He didn’t repeat as a pro, but he secured three Challenger titles between 2006 and 2008.\n\nThe Swede Daniel Berta won in Paris in 2009, beating Pablo Carreno Busta along the way. However, nothing more is known about the 28-year-old – the ATP site officially classifies him as inactive.\n\nCanadian Filip Peliwo dominated the 2012 season by reaching the final in all four junior Slams, winning Wimbledon and the US Open on his way to finishing the year in first place in the junior rankings. As a pro, he won two Futures and he lost in the final of two more tournaments. Now he’s 26, ranked 353rd and hasn’t started playing again after the lockdown.\n\nNicolas Pereira, the Venezuelan, equally dominated the 1988 season by winning the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, thus coming close to Edberg’s record. As a pro, he reached his best ranking at N.74 and won two ATP tournaments. An honest career, but a far cry from expectations.\n\nFinally, another who seemed destined to great things was the American Donald Young, who won the Australian Open in 2005, at 15 years and six months, an unmatched record of precociousness. In 2007, not yet 18, he won Wimbledon and made headlines all over the globe. For too many years, the Americans had been waiting for the heir of Sampras and Agassi, and his being touted as the best African American player since Arthur Ashe only increased the hype – it is no coincidence that on the cover of NewsWeek (“Who’s Next” Edition) his photo was close to that of Barack Obama. His professional career was more than respectable, as he achieved a career-high of N.38 in 2012. He won six Challengers and reached two ATP 250 finals. However, to be honest, everyone (himself included) expected much more.\n\nArticle by Massimiliano Gaiba; translated by Giuseppe Di Paola; edited by Tommaso Villa\n\nFriday’s schedule features the beginning of third round play, as well as the continuation of second round play, after rain interrupted matters on Thursday.\n\nBoth of the top seeds from the singles draws will play their third round matches on Friday, with Iga Swiatek taking on the fast-rising Marta Kostyuk, and Jannik Sinner squaring off against Jordan Thompson. Plus, the third seeds, Aryna Sabalenka and Alexander Zverev, each face the bronze medalists from the Tokyo Olympics. And several second round matches from Thursday are to be completed, meaning some players will take to the court twice on Friday. We will see the continuation of Carlos Alcaraz against Gael Monfils, with the winner returning later in the day to play Holger Rune.\n\nThroughout the tournament, this preview will analyze the day’s two most prominent matches, while highlighting the other notable matches on the schedule. Friday’s play gets underway at 11:00am local time.\n\nIga Swiatek (1) vs. Marta Kostyuk (15) – 11:00am on Center Court\n\nThese players came up through the junior ranks within the same generation, separated by just over a year in age. Kostyuk won the girls’ title at the 2017 Australian Open, and Swiatek won the girls’ title at Wimbledon in 2018. Of course Iga’ senior career skyrocketed at a young age, as she’s already a five-time Major champion at the age of 23.\n\nKostyuk’s rise has been much more gradual, but 2024 has been a breakout year for the 22-year-old. She achieved her first Major quarterfinal in Melbourne, and reached two WTA finals on two different surfaces. And as per Tennis Abstract, Marta is 5-3 this season against top 10 opposition.\n\nSwiatek leads their head-to-head 2-0, which includes a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 victory this past March in Indian Wells. But Iga is not fully comfortable on the fast-playing hard courts in Cincinnati, and Marta has enough aggression in her game to make the World No.1 plenty uncomfortable. However, I still consider Swiatek a slight favorite, given how she’s taken both of their prior contests in straight sets.\n\nFrances Tiafoe vs. Jiri Lehecka – Last on Center Court\n\nTiafoe has struggled mightily since being upset a year ago in the US Open quarterfinals by fellow American Ben Shelton, with a tour-level record of 23-24 since leaving New York. But Frances has secured a few strong wins within the past few weeks, defeating Andrey Rublev in Washington, and Lorenzo Musetti here in Cincinnati. Now Frances looks to advance beyond the third round of a Masters 1000 event for the first time in nearly two years.\n\nDespite a back injury that forced Lehecka to not play any tennis for two whole months between early-May and early-July, Jiri has played excellently in his first tournament back. After eliminating Mariano Navone in the first round, he upset Daniil Medvedev on Wednesday night. In three prior Masters 1000 appearances this season, Lehecka has twice advanced to the quarterfinals or better.\n\nTheir only previous encounter occurred last year on grass in Stuttgart, with Tiafoe winning in straight sets. But over a year later, both men are in different places, and both are coming into this match with varying degrees of confidence and match toughness. Yet based on the huge, authoritative ball striking Lehecka showcased against Medvedev, I give him the slight edge to advance.\n\nOther Notable Matches on Friday:\n\nAlexander Zverev (3) vs. Pablo Carreno Busta (PR) – After defeating Tokyo silver medalist Karen Khachanov in the last round, gold medalist Zverev now faces bronze medalist Carreno Busta, who has only played 10 tour-level matches across the past two seasons due to injury. Sascha is 3-0 against PCB.\n\nJannik Sinner (1) vs. Jordan Thompson – Sinner overcame American qualifier Alex Michelsen on Thursday, while Thompson ousted Sebastian Baez. This is their first career meeting.\n\nAryna Sabalenka (3) vs. Elina Svitolina – Sabalenka is 3-1 against Svitolina, but when they recently played in Rome, Aryna required a third-set tiebreak to put Elina away.\n\nHubert Hurkacz (5) vs. Flavio Cobolli – Hurkacz just slightly leads Cobolli this year with 37 wins at all levels, compared to 36 for the Italian. Earlier this summer on grass in Halle, Hubi beat Flavio in a tight two-setter.\n\nFriday’s full Order of Play is here."
