        "text": "NO 1 COURT — Henry Searle ended a 61-year wait for a British champion in the Wimbledon boys’ singles as he beat Yaroslav Demin 6-4, 6-4 to win the title.\n\nStanley Matthews Jr, son of the footballing great Stanley Sr, was the last home player to lift the boys’ title at SW19 back in 1962. Seven British boys in total have won the trophy but all in a 12-year period leading up to Matthews’s triumph.\n\nSearle is only the fourth British boy in the last 50 years even to reach the final, Jack Draper‘s defeat in 2018 the most recent.\n\nBut the Wolverhampton-born Searle never looked likely to follow in the footsteps of Miles Kasiri and Liam Broady, beaten in 2004 and 2011 respectively, as he completed victory in 85 minutes, sealing the title without dropping a set.\n\n“It’s amazing to play on Court One in front of such a special crowd. Managed to get the job done. It feels pretty good!” Searle said.\n\n“It’s a pretty special feeling and it’s not going to come too often. I’m going to try and enjoy it. I’d like to thank my coaching team at Loughborough University, my Mum, my brother, all the Barmy Army.”\n\nSearle’s friends and family had turned up in custom-made t-shirts emblazoned with “Henry’s Barmy Army” and helped roar him to a sixth successive victory.\n\nThe first of those came against Juan Carlos Prado Angelo, the draw’s No 1 seed, and Searle picked off two more seeded players en route to the final.\n\nA Wolves supporter and a good footballer before devoting himself to tennis at the age of 11, the 17-year-old’s run attracted the attention of his favourite team, who sent him a pre-match message of support from manager Julen Lopetegui.\n\nAnd after his victory, Wolves tweeted a message of congratulations: “What a performance, Henry Searle! Congratulations from all the pack.”\n\nSearle added: “It’s pretty cool to see that they’re recognising my successes in tennis and hopefully there can be many more in the future.”\n\nHis beaten opponent Demin said: “It was really nervous for me and it was tough.\n\n“But I’m sure it was a really great experience and for Henry as well. I hope we’re going to meet each other in a couple of years… but on Centre Court!”\n\nSearle added: “I’ll keep working hard and we’ll see what happens.”"
