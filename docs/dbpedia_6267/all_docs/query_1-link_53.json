        "text": "Searle fired an ace at an astonishing 132 mph – a speed that will put him in good stead when he turns professional (after his A-levels, of course). Only 14 out of the entire 128 players in the men’s draw clocked up a faster serve over the Wimbledon fortnight. ‘It’s a crucial part of my game,’ he said, crediting a growth spurt in lockdown for the added power and height.\n\nThe path from boys’ to men’s competition is well established. Tatler’s August issue cover star Jack Draper, 21, who had to forego this year’s Wimbledon due to injury, made it to the boy’s finals in 2018 – but narrowly losing out to Taiwanese top seed Tseng Chun-hsin. ‘Jack sent a really nice message wishing me the best of luck,’ said Searle. ‘I’ve seen him around the National Tennis Centre. I’ve spoken to him a few times but not managed to get on court with him yet.’\n\nAs a 17-year-old, Searle will be part of the new crop of tennis-playing young guns who are muscling in after the top of the sport has been dominated for so many years by the so-called ‘Big Four’ – Djokovic, Federer, Nadal and Murray. Gen Z men’s tennis-players who have made their mark this Wimbledon include Spanish champion Alcaraz, 20, Italian semi-finalist Jannik Sinner, 21, and Danish quarter-finalist Holger Rune, 20.\n\nSearle is a devoted Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club supporter and the admiration is mutual. After the match, the club tweeted their congratulations: ‘What a performance Henry Searle. Congratulations from all the pack.’\n\nPrior to Searle, the last British tennis player to win a Wimbledon boys’ singles title was Stanley Matthews in 1962, the son of legendary England footballer Sir Stanley Matthews. His predecessors in the women’s game are Annabel Croft, who won in 1984, and Laura Robson, who won in 2008. Both went on to make the world’s top 30 in the senior women’s rankings but their careers were cut short owing to injury."
