        "text": "Coco Gauff breezed into the third round of the US Open with a straight sets defeat of Tatjana Maria on Wednesday.\n\nThe reigning champion at Flushing Meadows won 6-4 6-0, with the minimum of fuss, on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\nGauff, who is seeded third, needed just 80 minutes to get the job done against her German opponent, and a third-round tie against Elina Svitolina is next up.\n\nThe American won seven games in a row to close out the match, with her second-set bagel her fifth at a grand slam this year.\n\n\"It was a tricky match,\" Gauff said. \"Overall I thought I did well the first set. I mean, it was close. I got out of those service games.\n\n\"Obviously could serve better, but off the ground and at the net there were some errors, but I think every time it was the right decision to make. It was just about execution.\"\n\nGauff has met Svitolina, a US Open semi-finalist in 2019, twice before, beating the Ukrainian in this year's Auckland Open final after suffering a defeat at the 2021 Australian Open.\n\nData Debrief: Nine straight for Coco\n\nGauff has now won nine straight matches at the US Open, making her the youngest player to do so since Maria Sharapova between 2006 and 2007.\n\nIndeed, the 20-year-old has now won 59 grand slam matches, which trails only Sharapova (81) when it comes to players aged under 21.\n\nNovak Djokovic said he \"served awful\" after progressing to the third round of the US Open.\n\nDjokovic was being pushed hard by his Serbian compatriot Laslo Djere in Wednesday's headline clash at Flushing Meadows.\n\nIndeed, the reigning champion needed two hours to take the first two sets, but Djere was eventually forced to retire through injury, handing Djokovic a 6-4 6-4 2-0 victory.\n\n\"It was a big fight, more than two hours for two sets,\" Djokovic said.\n\n\"I served awful and without the serve, you have to grind, you have to run.\"\n\nThe victory brought up Djokovic's 90th match win at the US Open, moving him one clear of Roger Federer, with only Jimmy Connors (98) ahead of the 37-year-old.\n\n\"It doesn't get bigger than this in terms of a tennis stage,\" said Djokovic, who will face Australia's Alexei Popyrin in the next round.\n\n\"The atmosphere is incredible and it's a great privilege to be able to play here again at my age.\"\n\nData Debrief: Djokovic stands alone\n\nDjokovic is now the only male player in the Open Era to win at least 90 matches at each of the four grand slams.\n\nThis win also improved Djokovic's career record against Djere to 3-0. His overall record against fellow Serbians, meanwhile, stands at 30-5, while he has only lost once in 19 hard-court matches against his compatriots, going down to Janko Tipsarevic at the ATP Finals in 2011.\n\nAryna Sabalenka is taking inspiration from the next generation of tennis fans as she aims to win the US Open, after her third-round win over Lucia Bronzetti.\n\nSabalenka made light work of the Italian on Wednesday, winning 6-3 6-1 to seal her place in round three.\n\nLast year's runner-up did not face a single break point and converted four of the eight she forced.\n\nAfter her victory, Sabalenka welcomed a young girl from the crowd onto the court for a photo.\n\nIn her post-match interview, the Belarusian said: \"That means a lot, it's something that keeps me going. To see the young generation being inspired by me - this is what it's all about. I'm a little bit in shock because this is such an inspiration for me.\"\n\nThere was no such luck for Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, who suffered a straight-sets loss to Elena-Gabriela Ruse.\n\nKrejcikova has failed to progress beyond round two at the US Open since she reached the quarters in 2021.\n\nData Debrief: Hard court specialist Sabalenka\n\nSabalenka tussled with Iga Swiatek on the clay courts earlier this season, but the world number two is excellent on the hard surface too.\n\nAmong active players, Sabalenka (80.6%, 45-11) trails only Naomi Osaka (81%, 47-11) in terms of win percentage on hard courts at grand slam events."
