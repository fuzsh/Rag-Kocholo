Matthews played college football for the University of Southern California, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American for the USC Trojans football team as a senior. He was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL Draft by the Oilers. He was a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, tied for the most in NFL history, and a nine-time first-team All-Pro.

Matthews' musical journey began at a young age, with his first guitar lesson at nine years old. His early exposure to various cultures and music, due to his family's frequent travels, significantly influenced his eclectic style. However, it was in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he established his most profound musical roots. In 1991, Matthews formed the Dave Matthews Band (DMB), a group that would go on to reshape the American rock scene. The band, known for its high-energy performances and complex musical arrangements, quickly gained a loyal following. Their debut album, Under the Table and Dreaming, released in 1994, achieved multi-platinum status, cementing their place in the music industry. Over the years, DMB has produced multiple chart-topping albums, including Crash, Before These Crowded Streets, and Everyday. Aside from his success with DMB, Matthews has also made significant strides as a solo artist and actor. He released his solo album, Some Devil, in 2003, which won a Grammy for the single \"Gravedigger.\" In the film industry, Matthews has appeared in several movies, including Because of Winn-Dixie and Just Go With It.

He spent time as a trade development advisor in the U.S Peace Corps in Swaziland, then worked as a presidential speechwriter during the Carter administration before moving on to serve as the chief of staff to Speaker of the House Thomas P.
