        "text": "Yulia Putintseva produced an impressive upset, knocking defending champion Coco Gauff out of the Cincinnati Open in the second round.\n\nThe 29-year-old rallied over three sets to hold off Gauff's comeback with a 6-4 2-6 6-4 win in just under two hours.\n\nPutintseva immediately set the tone by breaking the American's serve twice in the opening three games, and though Gauff pulled back to level things at 4-4, the Kazakh got another vital break to take the first set.\n\nThe world number two came out on a mission in the second though, piecing together a three-game winning streak as she managed to force a decider.\n\nAnd it looked like Gauff had found her stride when she took a 4-2 lead, but Putintseva won the last four games in a row to turn the tide and set up a meeting with Paula Badosa in the next round.\n\nData Debrief: Gauff falls short again\n\nAfter a disappointing Olympic debut, Gauff made an early exit from the Canadian Open, and she has been relegated to another early exit here.\n\nShe was looking to become just the second player to win consecutive titles here, but instead, she struggled once again, making nine double faults against a flawless opponent.\n\nMeanwhile, Putintseva is playing her first tournament since Wimbledon, where she knocked out Iga Swiatek en route to the fourth round. Before this year, she had never progressed past the first round in Cincinnati.\n\nNow, she is only the fourth player in the past four decades ranked outside the WTA's top 20 to claim wins over the top two on multiple surfaces in a season.\n\nAlexander Zverev claimed his 50th tour-level win of the season with a straight-sets victory over Karen Khachanov in the Cincinnati Open on Thursday.\n\nThe German took just 76 minutes to ease into the next round, earning a 6-3 6-2 win while coping with a second-set rain delay.\n\nZverev fought back from break point in the third game to set him up for a vital break in the sixth as he took the first set.\n\nAnd he raced into a 3-0 lead in the second against a spirited Khachanov, who just could not find any answers to his aggressive approach as the world number four hit 16 winners compared to the Russian's nine.\n\nHe will now play either Max Purcell or Pablo Carrena-Busta for a place in the quarter-final.\n\nData Debrief: Fifty up for Zverev\n\nIt is an impressive landmark for Zverev to hit, but he is also the first to register 50 wins at ATP events in 2024.\n\nIt is the fifth time the 27-year-old has won 50+ matches in a single season, and he is just the second German to do so during the Open Era, after Boris Becker.\n\nAlex de Minaur has confirmed he will particpate in the US Open later this month despite withdrawing from the men's singles at the Paris Olympics.\n\nDe Minaur sustained a hip injury against Arthur Fils at Wimbledon that forced him to withdraw from his quarter-final match against Novak Djokovic.\n\nThe Australian did still compete in the men's doubles at the Games alongside Alexei Popyrin, but lost in the first round to beaten finalists Austin Krajicek and Rajeev Ram.\n\nDe Minaur's best finish at Flushing Meadows came in 2020 when he reached the quarter-finals, losing to eventual champion Dominic Thiem in three sets.\n\nThe world number 10 has also reached the same stage in his two grand slam appearances this year at the Australian Open and French Open.\n\n\"Been working hard trying to recover from my injury,\" De Minaur wrote on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\n\"It’s been very tough missing tournaments and excited to say I’ll be playing US open. Thanks to all the support I’ve gotten, it’s definitely helped me through these tough times.\""
