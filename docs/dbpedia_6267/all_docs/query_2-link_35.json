And rightly so. He is the first Italian EVER to win the Australian title. But looking at my feeds‚Ä¶ you would think every Italian person and their dog played a part in his success. Comments like‚Ä¶ üèÜ The victory of real sport üèÜ The victory of normal kids üèÜ A new era for Italian sport üèÜ The victory of modern Italy üèÜ The victory of tenacious Italy üèÜ The victory of hard-working Italy üèÜ The victory against Italian stereotypes üèÜ The victory of Italy that works in silence The list goes on‚Ä¶ And it happens in every sport.

Get ready for some science‚Ä¶and to learn some new words. ü•≥ Every time we bask in the glory of our favourite (or favourite of the moment) sports team, we are ‚ÄòBIRGing‚Äô. When you find yourself over the moon as your favourite F1 driver won a racey...you are associating with his win, claiming some of his glory. üò° On the flip side, when you distance yourself from your team after a defeat, you are ‚ÄòCORFing‚Äô. Protecting your identity and distancing yourself. As humans we relish the victories and disown the defeats. It is in our nature. The same is true of brands. If you align your brand to a team, you are aligning your brand (and your customers) to the successes and failures of that team. So‚Ä¶you need to choose wisely when you are deciding on which team your brand is going to support. You have to be ready for your brand to bask in victories and share in defeats. Ponder on this before jumping on the sponsorship bandwagon. Don't just throw your cash around. ‚Üí Victory is not an asset. ‚Üí Victory is not guaranteed. ‚Üí Victory is not a mktg benefit. ‚úÖ Victory is a cherry on top of a cake.

There was something poignant about Andy's demeanour as the first-round match drifted away from him. Head bowed. A feeling of inevitability. Nothing really coming off. It never used to be like this. Andy Murray had an elite level ability to turn matches around. Especially against lesser opponents. Go to the chair one-set down. Think. Solve Problems. Strategise. Win Match. When you have graced the game at the highest level for so long, it's not easy to have to deal with feelings of ordinariness. You have escaped ordinariness for the majority of your career. You are not just enough another player on the tennis roadshow. You‚Äôre a Champion. A multiple Grand Slam winner. So how can an elite player live with being ordinary? Well it's not really possible. Especially if you start to fight these contradictions in the middle of a match. You quickly create another layer of difficulty. The self-frustration. 'I no longer like this version of myself'. Which lowers energy and focus levels Which impacts upon how well you are seeing and hearing the ball. How well you are targeting your shots. How well you are committing to your shot. Yes, your senses can still operate at an elite level. But the feeling you are having about you and your game, is now getting in the way. The only way out of the Ordinariness Trap is to let go of the comparison between Elite You. And Ordinary You. And allow what you are still Elite at, for example, how you see and hear the ball. to be an anchor point for your experience. That way, you can create ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô game energy, which can then stimulate and lift the other parts of your game. Of course, these feelings of comparison may simply become too much. And you walk away and say goodbye. But when you have been so good for so long. And you still have hunger and desire. Then the pathway that leads to elite level experience can still be found. But you cannot fight the Ordinariness. Only overlay it with what you are still Elite at. And make that your supreme focus so that your game knowledge, tennis intelligence, and 'in the moment sensory experience' triggers the trance-like connective state, you have experienced at special times in your tennis career. Then another magic day in the sun becomes possible!\n\nGo India Gold It is Olympic season and the hype associated with it is on. In midst of young, energetic and enthusiastic athletes a 51 year old has stolen the show. It is Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec who is ruling the internet. His stylish posture of air pistol shoot without eye gear and a nonchalant hand in pocket ,went viral as he shot silver for his country in the 10 m mixed. In the same event India's Manu Bhaker and Sarabojot Singh earned a historic bronze. Indian media went berserk with the double bronze for Manu as she had earlier won bronze for 10 m women's event. She had to issue a statement not to have great expectations as she is participating in solo event for 25m women's too. Reason is clear. She will do her best but excessive coverage may lead to pressure on her amidst heightened expectations . Fortunately she has withstood the pressure and has entered into finals of 25m Air pistol women's event by putting up a spectacular performance today. In the qualifiers for solo women event she scored 590 points and was in second position, just 2 points behind Veronika Major from Hungary who took the first place scoring 592. Tomorrow is the finals and Manu Bhaker has emerged India's best bet for gold. Let's put it in perspective. The single silver medal in mixed shooting event, has put Turkey ahead of India as ranking is done based on gold won, then silver and finally bronze. Currently China is on top of table with 11 golds and total medals at 24. other countries are as under : Country. Gold. Total medals USA. 9. 37. France. 8. 37. Australia. 8. 18. Both USA and France have more medals than China but are placed below since they have less gold medals. This position is as on 2nd of August and will change on daily basis as the competition is underway with lots of games yet to be played. The archery Indian team have reached semi final in mixed event. Indian hockey men's team has made a great start beating Australia. Evidently our sportspersons are upbeat and motivated with many corporate sponsors for the first time and the hysteria reserved for cricketers is being experienced by other athletes as well. More good news are expected as the competition get's underway. Let's keep our sight on gold. Medals matter but to be a great sporting nation gold medals matter. Indians are dominating in economy and corporate affairs with Indians taking leadership positions everywhere. So why should we settle for anything less in sports. Let's aim to be the best. Go India Gold. #goindiagold #olympics2024 #sports Pics courtesy : x / khel India\n\nLionel Messi is the world's most marketable athlete, according to new research from SportsPro and NorthStar Solutions Group, LLC. National Basketball Association (NBA) icon LeBron James was second, with USWNT star Alex Morgan third. And despite all the headlines he's made since moving to the Saudi Pro League (SPL), Cristiano Ronaldo has plummeted to 27th in the rankings. This year‚Äôs list also demonstrates the growing commercial influence and value of women‚Äôs sport. There are four women in the top ten and female athletes make up nearly 50 per cent of the top 50. US Open tennis champion Coco Gauff takes the title of the most marketable teenager, in 12th place. SportsPro and NorthStar's methodology assessed hundreds of global athletes across three key scoring pillars: Brand Strength, Total Addressable Market, and ECON ‚Äì Triple Bottom Line. Qualitative research was integrated with quantitative marketability measurements and mathematical formulas from various data sources were applied to determine the final rankings according to each athlete‚Äôs Total Marketability Score. The Top 10 most marketable athletes as determined by SportsPro and NorthStar are: 1. Lionel Messi 2. LeBron James 3. Alex Morgan 4. Giannis Antetokounmpo 5. Megan Rapinoe 6. Mikaela Shiffrin 7. Lewis Hamilton 8. Simone Biles 9. Kylian Mbappe 10. Max Verstappen #sportsbusiness #sportsmarketing\n\nArgentine soccer legend Lionel Messi has been named as the world‚Äôs most marketable athlete for 2023. The Inter Miami forward tops SportsPro‚Äôs annual list of the world‚Äôs 50 Most Marketable Athletes (50MM) for a second time, finishing ahead of National Basketball Association (NBA) icon LeBron James. Messi‚Äôs return to the top of the rankings, having previously reached number one in 2020, sees him become only the second athlete in 50MM history to take top spot on two occasions. US Women‚Äôs National Soccer Team (USWNT) striker Alex Mogan is third, with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo and Morgan‚Äôs USWNT teammate Megan Rapinoe completing the top five. Last year‚Äôs number one, Portuguese soccer great Cristiano Ronaldo, slips to 27th in the list. Indian cricketer Virat Kohli is another big mover, dropping out of the top 50 from number seven in 2022. This year‚Äôs list also underlines the growing commercial influence and value of women‚Äôs sport. There are four women in the top ten and female athletes make up nearly 50 per cent of the top 50. US Open tennis champion Coco Gauff takes the title of the most marketable teenager, with the 19-year-old sitting in 12th place. Soccer, basketball, tennis and motorsport have the greatest number of athletes in the top 50 but other major international sports are less well represented. Notably, no rugby players made the cut and while US athletes accounted for 26 per cent of the top 50 there are no players from Major League Baseball (MLB). College sports stars Angel Reese and Olivia Dunne also cracked the top 50 as the impact of name, image and likeness (NIL) rights continues to be felt. https://lnkd.in/grnPu2zn\n\nThis insightful article elicits the financial adversities encountered by professional tennis players, unearthing numerous realities inherent to the sport. Still, it seemingly dismisses the pivotal reason why just 18% of tennis revenues end up in the players' pockets. While tennis as a sport is not owned by the players, the magnetism of these athletes draws a fervent fan base. This loyal following is the driving force behind the $3 billion revenue flowing into tennis. Yet, these spectators pay their cash for the sheer delight of watching the athletes perform, not to line the pockets of the commercial entities or federations controlling the tournaments. This set-up, aimed at achieving maximum profits, rewards players merely with enough earnings that are needed to ensure their appearance in the tournaments. This results in a disproportionate amount of wealth being accumulated by the top-tier players, thereby exacerbating the issue of lower pay for those outside the top 50. It's almost unfathomable that a top 200 tennis player is generating only about $100K in income. Comparatively, a top 200 footballer is typically playing for one of the top ten clubs, earning millions and basking in the glory of being at the top echelon of their sport. On the other hand, a top 200 tennis player endures a challenging life on the tour, operating on a much more constrained budget. This disparity is particularly absurd, considering that tennis garners the support of an astonishing 1.2 billion fans globally and brings in $3 billion of revenues. Tennis stands as the fourth most-watched sport in terms of fan numbers worldwide, and this striking contrast serves as a stark reminder of the profound inconsistencies within the pay structures of different professional sports. Personally, I question whether Saudi investment will dramatically adjust the financial framework within professional tennis. A significant shift appears plausible only when the professional players themselves possess ownership of the sport, much like the structures in place in the Premier League or the NBA.\n\nGreat üéæ post by Andrew Petcash! Here are a few things to add, building on what he shared 1Ô∏è‚É£ The piece of the cake that players get in tennis is considerably lower than in other major sports (Football, NFL, NBA), which tells us there is room to do a better job industry and \"league\"-wise. 2Ô∏è‚É£ An aprox cost/year on tour for someone outside the Top 250 is around US$60k-80k, which is ~3x what they make in average. Ergo, long term careers are not sustainable out of the top ranking. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Futures and Challengers, the lower level competitions, are played by 85% of the players, but concentrate only 12% of the prize money in the circuit. 4Ô∏è‚É£ There is a large, informal and not regulated market of payments from tournaments to top players (besides the prize money) to attract them to play in certain competitions, which increases even more the economic disparity between top and not-top players. So what? ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è - As for now, we see lots of young talents coming from developing countries struggling to raise money to continue their careers - Many players find themselves drowning in matchfixing in order to afford their expenses, and later on facing suspensions and legal implications. But... - How much value do lower circuits actually generate to the governing bodies? (ATP, WTA, ITF & Grand Slams) - Is solving this problem a top priority for them? üí°Some new ideas could help improve in this topic... - New actors/capital? - Better redistribution? - Player to player sponsoring? - Tournament buy-back? - Unification of governing bodies?"
