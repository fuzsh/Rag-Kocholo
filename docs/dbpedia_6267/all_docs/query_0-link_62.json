        "text": "October 6, 1968, 50 years ago: Marlin Briscoe starts at quarterback for the Denver Broncos, after coming in as an injury replacement for Steve Tensi in the 4th quarter the week before. This makes the 23-year-old native of Omaha the 1st black man to start at quarterback in a professional football game. He leads the Broncos to a 10-7 win over the expansion Cincinnati Bengals at Mile High Stadium.\n\nThis was the 1st season that the Broncos wore blue helmets with an orange D logo with a charging horse inside. They would wear them through the 1996 season, including 4 AFC Championships. This was also the season that the former minor-league ballpark, formerly known as Bears Stadium, was sold to the City of Denver, which renamed it Mile High Stadium, and expanded it to 50,567 seats.\n\nThis ended rumors that the Broncos, Denver's 1st major league sports team (unless you count the original Nuggets, who briefly played in the NBA's early says), might move to Chicago, Atlanta, or Birmingham.\n\nBut 1968 would not be a good season for the Broncos, as they finished 5-9 under head coach Lou Saban, who had led the Buffalo Bills to 2 AFL Championships, and would later lead them to the Playoffs again. He was also the father of college coaching superstar Nick Saban.\n\nAfter the 1968 season, Marlin \"the Magician\" Briscoe was traded to the Bills, moved to receiver, made the Pro Bowl at that position in 1970, won 2 Super Bowl rings with the Miami Dolphins, and played in the NFL through 1976. He then moved to Los Angeles, became a financial broker, and now runs the Boys and Girls Club of Long Beach, California.\n\nHe wasn't quite the 1st black quarterback in the NFL. In fact, while the NFL now counts all AFL stats as NFL stats, the 1st starting black quarterback in the NFL proper was Joe Gilliam, with the 1974 Pittsburgh Steelers, who got the job after Chuck Noll stopped trusting Terry Bradshaw. But Gilliam didn't do well, Noll went back to Bradshaw, and the rest is history.\n\nOfficially, Fritz Pollard had played the position of quarterback in the league's 1st season of 1920. The aptly-named Willie Thrower played 2 games for the Chicago Bears in 1953, coming on in relief of George Blanda, but never started.\n\nAnd George Taliaferro, the 1st black man drafted by an NFL team, the Bears in 1949, was a Pro Bowl running back for the team that was the New York Yanks (not \"Yankees\") in 1951, the Dallas Texans in 1952, and the Baltimore Colts in 1953. He played quarterback in the NFL, but never started at the position.\n\nGilliam, his health ruined by a long battle with drugs, died in 2000. Thrower died in 2002. Pollard died in 1986. Taliaferro is now 91, and lives in Bloomington, Indiana, where he led Indiana University to their 1st Big Ten title in 1945. (UPDATE: Taliaferro died 2 days after I posted this.)\n\n*\n\nOctober 6, 1723: By his own estimation of the date, Boston native Benjamin Franklin arrives in Philadelphia, then the other major city in British America, to start a new life. He will become more identified with the city than even its founder, William Penn. He's also the most famous person to realize that, to make it, you gotta get out of Boston and get to a better city.\n\nThis started a rivalry that led to some intense basketball and hockey games, if not baseball and football. Though the Eagles' 2 most recent Super Bowls, 2005's loss and this year's win, were both against the New England Patriots.\n\nOctober 6, 1734: William Woodford is born in Caroline County, Virginia. In 1775, he won the Battle of Great Bridge, driving the British Royal Governor, John Murray, the 4th Earl of Dunmore, out of the Colony.\n\nHe rose to the rank of Brigadier General, and was with George Washington at the Battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth, and at Valley Forge. But Washington made a mistake, sending Woodford's 2nd Virginia Regiment to join the Southern Continental Army, and he was captured at the Siege of Charleston in May 1780.\n\nThe British sent him to a prison ship in New York Harbor, and he died there 6 months later, only 46 years old. Few of the Revolutionary patriots suffered as much as he did.\n\nOctober 6, 1744: James McGill is born in Glasgow, Scotland. He moved to Canada, was elected to the colonial assembly of Lower Canada in Montreal, and founded Montreal's McGill University. He died in 1813.\n\nNot only is McGill University the closest thing Canada has to a Harvard, right down to crimson red being its school color, but, in 1874, Harvard and McGill played a football game combining the rules each side knew, with McGill's basically being rugby. This was crucial in the development of American football.\n\nOctober 6, 1769: Isaac Brock is born in St. Peter Port, Guernsey, in Britain's Channel Islands. In 1811, the Brigadier General in the British Army was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, meaning he was military governor of present-day Ontario. On August 16, 1812, with the War of 1812 underway, he captured Fort Detroit, and the U.S. Army surrendered it without firing a shot, perhaps the most ignominious defeat in U.S. military history.\n\nOn October 13, he led British troops against the U.S. at the Battle of Queenston Heights, outside present-day Niagara Falls, Ontario. Although Brock himself was shot in the heart, and died at age 43, he had prevented a successful American invasion of Canada, one of several our troops would attempt from 1775 to 1846, with little success.\n\nBrock is known as The Hero of Upper Canada, and, while independence would not be achieved until 1867, the War of 1812 was an even more significant event for Canada than for America, a unifying moment that set them on the path to independence from (though still, to this day, partnership with) Britain. Brock is often called the country's greatest military leader.\n\nOctober 6, 1773: Louis Phillippe de Valois is born at the Palais Royal in Paris. A cousin of King Louis XVI of France, he had to flee when his father, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans, was executed in the French Revolution in 1793. In exile, he became the leader of the Orléanist Party, favoring a constitutional monarchy.\n\nHe waited, through the collapse of the Revolution, the French Directory, the Consulship and then the Empire of Napoléon Bonaparte, before the Bourbon Restoration established a constitutional monarchy and put his cousin on the throne as King Louis XVIII, allowing him to return to court as Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orléans. The cousins fell out, however. When Louis died in 1824, his brother became King Charles X, and his better terms with Louis Philippe didn't last, either.\n\nIn 1830, the July Revolution forced Charles to abdicate in favor of his 10-year-old son, Henri. Not willing to accept a boy as King, even with Louis Philippe as regent, the Chamber of Deputies proclaimed Louis Philippe \"King of the French.\" He could have taken the name Louis XIX, but instead kept his dual name.\n\nBut at 57, he had waited too long, and had become embittered and conservative. Under the July Monarchy, the French economy gradually got worse and worse, and the once-beloved \"Citizen King\" faced 7 assassination attempts, surviving them all.\n\nThe worsening conditions eventually landed the country in the continent-wide Revolutions of 1848. He abdicated, and fled to England. The Second Republic was proclaimed, but under Napoléon's grandnephew, the Second Empire was declared, and he became Emperor Napoléon III. (The Little Corporal's son never actually reigned as Napoléon II.) Louis Philippe died in exile in London in 1850.\n\nOctober 6, 1778: The Battle of Chestnut Neck is fought in what's now Port Republic, Atlantic County, New Jersey. Chestnut Neck was then used as a base by privateers, and 400 British soldiers attacked 50 Americans. The British destroyed some buildings and took some supplies, but received word that Count Kazimierz Pulaski was coming for them, and did the smart thing and got out. Pulaski caught up with them at nearby Little Egg Harbor on October 15.\n\nOctober 6, 1820: Johanna Maria Lind is born in Stockholm Sweden. Known as Jenny Lind, \"the Swedish Nightingale\" became the most famous female opera singer of the 19th Century, making a fortune touring Europe and America, and using the proceeds to fund schools. Aside from Britain's Queen Victoria, she was arguably the most famous woman in the world at the time. She lived until 1887.\n\nOctober 6, 1836: John Taylor is born in Hamilton, Mercer County, New Jersey. At the age of 17, he became a clerk in a grocery store in neighboring Trenton. By the 1860s, he was the biggest grocer in the State Capital. He was elected to the City Council and the State Senate, but refused to run for a 2nd term there.\n\nIn 1888, he put all of his businesses together into the Taylor Provision Company. He had invented a sliced pork product that he called \"Taylor's Prepared Ham.\" In 1906, the passage of the Pure Food & Drug Act set legal definitions of various meat products, and Taylor's product no longer fit the legal definition of \"ham.\" Therefore, he changed it to \"Taylor's Pork Roll.\" Taylor Provision is still in business, and still sells the product in supermarkets with that name. John Taylor died in 1909, at the age of 72.\n\nA sandwich of pork roll, egg and cheese -- say it with me, in a Jersey accent, as one proper word: \"Pawkrolleggncheese\" -- especially on a Kaiser roll with ketchup, salt and pepper, is also known as the Jersey Breakfast. People in Central Jersey and South Jersey call it \"pork roll,\" but people in North Jersey call it \"Taylor ham.\" Let's end the debate right now: If the people who invented it and produce more of it than anybody else call it \"pork roll,\" then it's \"pork roll.\"\n\nWhat does this have to do with sports? Well, you know the Milwaukee Brewers Sausage Race? Many teams, major-league and minor-league alike, have variations based on food products. The Lakewood BlueClaws, the Class A farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies, representing the Jersey Shore, have such a race, featuring the items in the Jersey Breakfast: Pork roll, egg and cheese race. I swear, I am not making that up.\n\nOctober 6, 1845: The 1st recorded baseball game using Alexander Cartwright's rules, the basis for the game we have today, is played between members of the Knickerbocker Club, of which he is a member. It was, as we would say today, an intrasquad game. In a way, this could mean that October 6 is baseball's birthday.\n\nOnly 14 players participate as Duncan Curry's team defeats Cartwright's team 11-8, in a shortened game of only 3 innings. The Knickerbocker Club will play at least 14 recorded games during the fall of 1845.\n\nOctober 6, 1848, 170 years ago: James Smith (no middle name) is born in Fordyce, Scotland. A founding member of Glasgow club Queen's Park, he played for Scotland in the 1st international football match ever played, against England at Hamilton Crescent in the Partick section of Glasgow, in front of 4,000 paying customers, on November 30, 1872.\n\nJames was a defender, and his brother Robert, also a player for Queen's Park, played forward. It had rained for days before the match, and the field was soggy. Not surprisingly, the game ended 0-0.\n\nLittle is known of the Smith brothers after their playing days ended in the 1870s. In 1890, James was reported as having died \"some years ago in London.\" Robert was said to have been dead by 1920. Given the medical procedures available at the time, this is not surprising.\n\nOctober 6, 1854: Charles N. Snyder -- I can find no record of what the N stands for -- is born in Washington, D.C. A catcher, \"Pop\" Snyder played professional baseball from 1873 to 1891. He was an original member of the Cincinnati Reds in 1882. (No, the current team is not the same one as the 1869-70 Cincinnati Red Stockings.)\n\nHe also managed the Reds in 1882, '83 and '84, and closed his playing career in his hometown, as player-manager of the Washington Statesmen in 1891. From then until 1901, he served as an umpire. He lived until 1924, just long enough to see his hometown win the World Series for what remains the only time in its history.\n\nAlso on this day, the Wilson yarn factory in Gateshead, England, explodes, starting a fire that not only devastates the city, but crosses the River Tyne, and devastates the larger city of Newcastle as well. It is believed that 53 people died.\n\nThe 2 cities of England's North-East came together in a spirit of community to rebuild. This has been seen time and time again, during labor strife, the German bombings in both World Wars, and in the struggles of Newcastle United Football Club: Even when they've been relegated to English soccer's 2nd division, they fill St. James Park 52,000 strong.\n\nOctober 6, 1868, 150 years ago: In a match that decides the Championship of amateur baseball for the year, the Atlantics of Brooklyn pound the Unions of Morrisania (now part of The Bronx)‚ 24-8‚ at Morrisania. The Atlantics win the best-2-out-of-3 from the defending Champions.\n\nOctober 6, 1872: John Joseph Dunn is born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, outside Erie, and grows up in Bayonne, Hudson County, New Jersey. Despite a childhood accident that damaged and nearly cost him his left arm, he became a pitcher and a 3rd baseman, helping the Brooklyn Superbas (forerunners of the Dodgers) win the 1899 National League Pennant, and the New York Giants win it in 1904.\n\nIn 1907, he became the manager of the International League's Baltimore Orioles, and bought the team in 1909. In 1914, due to the encroachment of the Federal League, he had to sell his recently-acquired biggest star, a lefthanded pitcher who grew up in a nearby reform school: George Ruth. He sold Ruth to the Red Sox, where he became known as \"Jack Dunn's Baby,\" shortened to \"Baby\" and then \"Babe.\"\n\nHe built a dynasty in Baltimore, winning 7 straight Pennants, despite selling some of his best players to Connie Mack of the Philadelphia Athletics, who had loaned him some of the money he needed to buy the team in the first place. He was still the Orioles' owner when he died in 1928, only 56 years old. The Dunn family continued to be involved with the minor-league Orioles, and then with the major league version, and still retains a part-ownership today.\n\nOctober 6, 1874: Frank Gilman Allen is born outside Boston in Lynn, Massachusetts. He served in both houses of his State's legislature, was President of the State Senate from 1921 to 1924, and was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1924 and Governor in 1928, serving from 1929 to 1931.\n\nHis time as Governor included Massachusetts' 300th Anniversary celebrations in 1930, which included both of Boston's baseball teams, the Red Sox and the Braves, wearing sleeve patches with the Pilgrim hat that served as the Tricentennial logo. His tenure also included the 1929 Stanley Cup won by the Boston Bruins. The Boston Garden had opened just before his election. He was defeated for re-election in 1930, probably a backlash due to the Great Depression, and lived until 1950.\n\nOctober 6, 1880: The Cincinnati Red Stockings refuse to accede to the restrictions approved by the NL 2 days earlier: No alcohol sold at games, and no games on Sundays. They are thrown out of the NL. This leads directly to a new club in Cincinnati that founds the American Association, nicknamed \"The Beer and Whiskey League.\" They will also sell tickets for 25 cents, half the cost of NL games.\n\nAlso on this day, the University of Southern California is founded in Los Angeles. It becomes the leading private university in the State, and its football and baseball programs are legendary.\n\nOctober 6, 1882: In the 1st postseason matchup between AA and NL Champions -- nobody is calling it \"the World Series\" or even \"the World's Series\" -- the AA Champion Cincinnati Red Stockings shut out the NL Champion Chicago White Stockings (forerunners of the Cubs) 4-0 behind Will White.\n\nThe next day, Chicago returns the favor by blanking Cincinnati 2-0. At this point Cincinnati‚ under pressure from the AA‚ reluctantly cancels the exhibition series to avoid expulsion from the league. So, with the NL still the unquestioned superior league, the White Stockings are the unofficial World Champions, for the 3rd year in a row.\n\nOctober 6, 1886: After pitching 3 1-hitters and 4 2-hitters earlier in the season‚ 20-year-old lefthander Matt Kilroy finally gets a no-hitter‚ beating the Pittsburgh Alleghenys 6-0. Pitching for the Baltimore Orioles, who are in last place in the AA, \"Matches\" still manages a won-lost record of 29-32.\n\nKilroy was still officially a rookie in 1886. He struck out 513 batters, still a record for a pitcher. It should be noted that the distance from the pitcher's mound to home plate was 50 feet, not reaching 60 feet, 6 inches until 1893. By that point, he was already in decline, and was not with the Orioles when they joined the NL in 1892 and won Pennants in 1894, '95, '96 and nearly again in '97. He won 141 games against 136 losses, mostly for bad teams, and was never a serious candidate for the Hall of Fame.\n\nA Philadelphia native, he died there in 1940, age 74, and is buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery at the city's northern edge, as are Connie Mack, 1910s Red Sox star Steve Yerkes, 1970s Mayor Frank Rizzo and Olympic rowing champion John B. Kelly Sr. (father of Olympic rowing champ Jack Kelly and actress-princess Grace Kelly).\n\nThe Alleghenys will join the NL in 1887, and the franchise officially traces its birth to that season, not its actual debut with the founding of the AA in 1882. In 1890, with the game in flux because of the establishment of the Players' League, the Alleghenys sign 2nd baseman Lou Bierbauer of the AA's Philadelphia Athletics (not the later AL team).\n\nThat Athletics publicly claim the move was \"piratical.\" The Pittsburgh club just goes with this, renaming themselves the Pirates for the 1891 season, and claims that the Athletics did not reserve him, making him a free agent and fair game to sign. An arbitrator agreed.\n\nThat was the last season of the AA, and the Orioles joined the NL at that time, as did the Reds, and the St. Louis team that would become the Cardinals.\n\nOctober 6, 1888: Roland Georges Garros is born in Saint-Denis, on Réunion Island, a French colony east of the African island nation of Madagascar. On August 3, 1914, he flew an airplane into a German zeppelin, knocking it down, thus winning the 1st air battle in the history of human warfare.\n\nOn April 18, 1915, he was shot down by a German plane, but survived, and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp. On February 14, 1918, he escaped, and rejoined his unit. But on October 5, just 1 day before his 30th birthday, he was shot down over Vouziers, in the Ardennes Forest, and killed.\n\nA true war hero of the Allies, but what does he have to do with sports? In 1928, the French government built a 14,840-seat tennis stadium in the 16th Arrondissement of Paris, to stage their defense of the Davis Cup, and named it Stade Roland Garros. The French Open has been held there ever since.\n\nOctober 6, 1894: The American League of Professional Football, the 1st soccer pro soccer league in the United States, begins play. The 1st game is played in Philadelphia, at the home of the Phillies, what would later be known as Baker Bowl. The New York World, Joseph Pulitzer's splashy, sometimes trashy, newspaper, prints this story:\n\nPhiladelphia, Oct. 6 -- The championship season of American League Professional Football opened here this afternoon on the Philadelphia baseball grounds, with a game between Philadelphia and New York's clubs.\n\nThe visitors won by a score of 5 to 0. Two halves of 45 minutes were played.\n\nAfter 40 minutes of play in the first half, Connolly of New York kicked the first goal.\n\nIn the second half, the home players did not back each other up properly, and New York had little trouble in making four more. Gavin scored two and Lupton scored two.\n\nThere was a good crowd present, and the liveliest interest was maintained. The New York XI showed excellent teamwork, and the coaching of their captain Trainor had a good effect.\n\nThe sporting public in this vicinity are not going to die of heart disease caused from over-enthusiasm for professional football.\n\nStill, it seems to be gaining in popularity. It is an open question whether football can succeed baseball.\n\nThere were 6 teams in the ALPF, all named after the baseball teams in town. In alphabetical order: The Baltimore Orioles, the Boston Beaneaters, the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, the New York Giants, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Washington Senators. Baltimore won their 1st 4 games by a combined margin of 24-3, but had to fold. Since the standings were decided by points, 2 for a win and 1 for a tie, the standings were as follows: Brooklyn 10, Baltimore 8, Boston 8, New York 4, Philadelphia 4 and Washington 2. A dispute with a competing soccer authority and the depression of the 1890s combined to prevent a 2nd season in the Autumn of 1895.\n\nNew York and Philadelphia would become important cities in American professional soccer, and both would have teams in the American Soccer League, the original North American Soccer League, and, with the 2010 establishment of the Philadelphia Union, Major League Soccer. But Americans simply have never cared enough about soccer to put in on the same level as baseball. That would not be the case with the game we call \"football.\"\n\n*\n\nOctober 6, 1900: Morris Stanley Nichols is born in Stondon Massey, Essex, England. I don't know what makes a cricket player great, but Stan Nichols of the Essex County Cricket Club was considered \"the leading all-rounder in English cricket for much of the 1930s.\" He was a lefthanded bastman but a righthanded bowler (pitcher). He died in 1961 in Newark -- that's the one in Nottinghamshire, whose name was taken in 1666 for the city in New Jersey.\n\nOctober 6, 1904: The Pirates beat the Cardinals 10-1. In spite of the loss, the Cards' Jack Taylor hurls his 39th consecutive complete game of the season, still a major league record under the 60 & 6 distance. His streak started on April 15, and totaled 352 innings pitched.\n\nOctober 6, 1905: Helen Newington Wills is born in Fremont, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area. She was the most dominant female tennis player of the 1920s and '30s. In those days, not many tennis players (male or female) made the long trip to Australia to play their Open. If she had, she might have won the Grand Slam, because she won the other 3 in 1928 and 1929.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1938, she won Wimbledon 8 times (a record until Martina Navratilova surpassed it in 1990), the U.S. Open 7 times, and the French Open 4 times -- but never entered the Australian Open. When tennis was an Olympic sport in Paris in 1924, she won the women's Gold Medal. On 7 occasions, a Grand Slam Final came down to \"The Two Helens,\" with Helen Wills Moody (she used her married name from 1930 onward) beating Helen Hull Jacobs in 6 of them.\n\nShe wrote an instruction manual in 1928 (titled simply Tennis), a mystery novel in 1939 (with more imagination, titled Death Serves an Ace), and articles for The Saturday Evening Post, and painted up until her death in 1938. Both Jack Kramer and Don Budge -- who lived long enough to see Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles -- called her the best female tennis player ever.\n\nOctober 6, 1906: Not one of the best-known games between the teams now known as the Yankees and the Red Sox, due to the passage of over a century, but it deserves to be mentioned. The New York Highlanders beat the Boston Americans 5-4 at Hilltop Park, behind the pitching of Long Tom Hughes.\n\nBut Charles Sylvester \"Chick\" Stahl, the 33-year-old center fielder and manager for Boston, hits a 2-run homer off Hughes in the top of the 8th. It's not enough, but it does turn out to be the last at-bat of his career. He remains the most notable player to hit a home run in his last major league at-bat, until another Red Sox star does it in 1960: Ted Williams.\n\nThe 1907 season will be the 1st one for the club under the Red Sox name. But Stahl will not be there. Not as a player (he had already announced his retirement), and not as manager. Back in his native Indiana, where he was conducting spring training, he committed suicide by drinking carbolic acid on March 28.\n\nA star of the Boston club's 1903 and '04 Pennant winners, he was despondent about something, and told his teammates, \"Boys, I just couldn't help it. It drove me to it.\" No one has been able to determine what he was talking about, although it was known that he had cheated on his wife Julia, and it has been retroactively suggested that he was dealing with mental illness. It has also been suggested that he was depressed about having to dismiss his predecessor and ex-teammate, future Hall-of-Famer Jimmy Collins.\n\nA year and a half later, on November 15, 1908, Julia died, too, under circumstances that have never been explained. Although Jake Stahl was also a prominent Red Sock of the pre-Curse of the Bambino years, he and Chick were not related.\n\nAlso on this day, Ferry Field opens on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Coach Fielding Yost had a 44-0 record at the previous facility, Regents Field, but it seated only 15,000 people, and he wanted a bigger stadium. Ferry Field would seat 46,000. It was named for Dexter Ferry, a Detroit businessman, who donated the land. Michigan beat Case Western Reserve, of Cleveland, 28-0.\n\nThe Wolverines outgrew Ferry Field, too, and in 1927, Michigan Stadium -- \"The hole that Yost dug,\" later Michigan broadcaster Bob Ufer would call it -- would open, seating 72,000. It now officially seats 107,601. Ferry Field remained in use, as the home of Michigan's track & field program, and is still used as such.\n\nAlso on this day, Woolwich Arsenal defeat Liverpool 2-1 at the Manor Ground in Plumstead, Southeast London. This is The Arsenal's 14th season in the Football League, their 3rd in Division One, and this match marks the 1st time they have gone into 1st place.\n\nThey finish 7th, and and reach their 2nd straight Semifinal in the FA Cup. They will finish 6th in 1909, but will not top that performance until 1931, when they win their 1st League title.\n\nOctober 6, 1908, 110 years ago: Philip Lombardo is born in East Harlem, then an Italian neighborhood in Upper Manhattan. Due to his glasses, he was known as Benny Squint. He briefly served in prison for drug trafficking in the 1940s.\n\nAfter Vito Genovese was sent to prison in 1959, the Genovese crime family was run by acting bosses. Effectively, Lombardo was boss from 1965 onward; he was official boss starting in 1969. By 1980, his ill health forced him to turn power over to Vincent \"the Chin\" Gigante, while \"Fat Tony\" Salerno would be the public boss. Lombardo died in 1987, age 78.\n\nOctober 6, 1909: Christy Mathewson pitched for the Yankees? Not officially. The Highlanders and the Detroit Tigers oppose each other in a postseason benefit game for Sam Crane, a sportswriter and former big-league 2nd baseman who had recently recovered from a severe illness, and had been unable to pay his medical bills.\n\nMathewson pitched for the Yankees, while his former Giant teammate Iron Joe McGinnity came out of retirement to pitch for the Tigers. This was likely arranged by Hughie Jennings, the Tiger manager, who was a teammate of Giant manager John McGraw on the 1890s Orioles and Brooklyn Superbas (forerunners of the Dodgers).\n\nJennings, for the last time in a brilliant baseball career, plays shortstop, a position at which he was so good that he might have gotten into the Hall of Fame had he never managed a game. He had just clinched the Tigers' 3rd straight Pennant, and probably viewed this as not just a good deed for an old friend, but as a good warmup for the World Series.\n\nThe Tigers won the game, 8-4. Money raised: $7,000, equivalent to about $180,000 today.\n\nCrane's playing career ended in 1890, when he was arrested after having an affair with the wife of a fruit dealer and stealing $1,500 from the husband -- about $40,000 in today's money. But he became a better writer than a player, and lived until 1925, age 71.\n\nA few years later, there would be another infielder named Sam Crane, and his own amorous difficulties got him in even hotter water. This one was a shortstop who played for 4 teams, including the Brooklyn Dodgers, from 1914 to 1922. \"Red\" Crane (he was a redhead, and the accusations against him do not include Communism) was convicted of the jealous murder of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend on August 3, 1929, and was sentenced to 18 to 36 years in prison.\n\nHe proved to be a model prisoner. His former manager Connie Mack argued for his parole for 15 years, and he finally got it in 1944. He then lived in comparative tranquility until 1955.\n\n*\n\nOctober 6, 1911: The New York Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 10-5 at the Polo Grounds, and clinch the Pennant. They will play the other Philadelphia team, the Athletics, in the World Series.\n\nAlso on this day, Cy Young appears in his last major league game, starting for the Boston Rustlers (forerunners of the Braves, then named for their owner, William H. Russell). It doesn't go so well. The Brooklyn Superbas (forerunners of the Dodgers) win, 13-3. The old Cyclone, age 44, goes 6 1/3 innings, giving up 11 hits. Here are the results of his last 8 at-bats: Triple, 4 straight singles, 3 straight doubles.\n\nYoung then retired, with all-time records for wins (511), losses (316), appearances by a pitcher (906), innings pitched (7,356), batters faced (29,565), starts (815), complete games (749), hits allowed (7,092), runs allowed (3,167), earned runs allowed (2,147 -- meaning, in those days of inadequate gloves, he allowed 1,020 unearned runs), and strikeouts (2,803). His records for appearances, runs (but not earned runs) and strikeouts have been broken. The rest still stand, 105 years later.\n\nHis ERA+ was 138, and his WHIP was 1.130, so he wasn't just lasting a long time amassing some big stats, as has been leveled against more recent pitchers like Nolan Ryan, Gaylord Perry and Don Sutton: He was great even by the standards of his own time.\n\nFive hundred and eleven wins. The next-closest pitcher is Walter Johnson, with 417 -- 94 less. The winningest living pitcher is Greg Maddux with 355. The winningest active pitcher is Bartolo Colon with 233. CC Sabathia is next with 223. The pitcher under age 30 with the most is Clayton Kershaw with 126. So unless there's a change in baseball as radical as that of the Dead Ball Era to the Lively Ball Era in 1920, Young's 511 wins, and his other still-standing records, are as safe as records can be.\n\nYoung, who lived until 1955, age 87, was interviewed in 1945 by Chicago Daily News sports editor John P. Carmichael for his anthology My Greatest Day In Baseball. Young's choice was his 1904 perfect game for the Boston Americans (Red Sox). He added, \"In my last game, I was beaten 1-0 by a kid named Grover Cleveland Alexander.\" Alexander was a rookie in 1911, but if he did beat Cy Young 1-0 that season, it wasn't in Young's last game. (I looked up Baseball-Reference.com, but their pitching logs only go back to 1913.)\n\nAlso on this day, Wilfrid Laurier leaves the Prime Minister's office in Canada, after 15 years, his Liberal Party having lost an election to Robert Borden and his Conservative Party. The 1st French-Canadian to serve as Prime Minister, and considered one of the country's greatest, he is on the Canadian $5.00 bill.\n\nOctober 6, 1912: In Cincinnati‚ Pirates right fielder Owen \"Chief\" Wilson hits a 9th inning 3-run triple off the Reds' Frank Gregory, but, in trying to stretch it into a home run, he is nipped at the plate. The Pirates roll‚ 16-6. It is his 36th triple of the season, a still-standing record.\n\nOn the same day, the Chicago Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 4-3. Cubs 3rd baseman Heinie Zimmerman, goes 0-for-3, and has had just 2 hits in the last week. But he holds on to win the Triple Crown‚ leading by 1 home run and 1 run batted it. Or so it was then thought: Years later‚ a recount of the totals will drop Zim from 103 RBIs to 99‚ and cost him the Triple Crown.\n\nOctober 6, 1915: Humberto Sousa Medeiros is born in Ponta Delgado, in the Azores, an island colony of Portugal. As a teenager, his family brought him to Fall River, Massachusetts, a city with a large Portuguese community.\n\nFrom 1970 until 1983, he was Archbishop of Boston. This period included Boston's 1974-75 school busing crisis, the Blizzard of '78, the Bruins' 1972 Stanley Cup, the Celtics' 1974 and '76 NBA Championships, the Red Sox' 1975 Pennant and '78 choke, and the rise of Doug Flutie at the Jesuit school that his Archdiocese oversaw, Boston College. (BC would name is freshman honors dormitory for him.)\n\nCardinal Medeiros died on September 17, 1983. Just 19 days later, the Archbishop of Boston's arch-rival, New York, Terence Cardinal Cooke, also died.\n\nOctober 6, 1917: Camp Randall Stadium opens on the campus of the University of Wisconsin in Madison. The Badgers beat Beloit College 34-0. They had been playing football on the site since 1895.\n\nIt was built on the site of Camp Randall, which had been an Army training ground during the American Civil War, named for the Governor of Wisconsin, Alexander Randall.\n\nThe big bowl, with an upper deck on only one side, now seats 80,321, and is known for having the best atmosphere in the Big Ten: Thanks to the UW campus, Madison is known as Mad City.\n\nAlso on this day, Fannie Lou Townsend is born on a farm outside Winona, Mississippi. We remember her by her married name, Fannie Lou Hamer. In 1964, she co-founded the Freedom Democratic Party, and along with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), organized \"Mississippi Freedom Summer,\" designed to register black people to vote in that State, and to get its delegation to the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City integrated.\n\nShe spoke for millions when she said, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.\" She ran for the U.S. Senate in 1964 and the State Senate in 1971, but lost both times: The former because Mississippi was not going to vote for a black woman over 2-term segregationist incumbent John Stennis; the latter because her health had begun to fail and she could not campaign to the extent that she wanted. She lived until 1977.\n\nOctober 6, 1919: Game 5 of the World Series, following a Sunday rainout. Reds pitcher Hod Eller pitches a 3-hit shutout against the Chicago White Sox. In the 2nd and 3rd innings, he strikes out 6 players in a row: Chick Gandil, Swede Risberg, Ray Schalk, opposing pitcher Lefty Williams, Nemo Leibold and Eddie Collins.\n\nIn addition, the Reds score 4 runs in the 6th on, among other things, bad throws by Shoeless Joe Jackson and Happy Felsch. Schalk gets thrown out of the game arguing a safe call on a slide into the plate by the Reds' Heinie Groh.\n\nThe Reds win, 5-0, and go up 4 games to 1 in this best-5-out-of-9 Series. One more win, and the Reds take the title.\n\nJackson, Felsch, Gandil, Risberg and Williams will later be found to be on the take. Eddie Cicotte did not appear in the game. Fred McMullin, usually a backup, did not appear, and of course Buck Weaver ended up being suspended for not reporting the fix, not because he was part of it (he wasn't). So of the 7 players in on it, 5 appeared, and all had something to do with the defeat.\n\nAlso on this day, Thomas Lawton (no middle name) is born in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England. A forward, he starred for several English soccer teams, but never his hometown Bolton Wanderers, or any other team in the Manchester area. He began his soccer career with Lancashire side Burnley in the 1936-37 season, before being purchased by Liverpool-based Everton.\n\nHe helped Everton win the Football League title in 1939. But Everton have been called the unluckiest club in football: They were holders of the League title in both 1915, when the Football Association suspended League operations due to World War I; and again in 1939, when the FA did so again for World War II.\n\nThe War wrought havoc with soccer as well as everything else, resulting in, among other things, depleted rosters. Many \"guest appearances\" were permitted, especially by players for clubs near where the armed forces had them stationed. Having stationed him in Birkenhead, across the River Mersey, the British Army permitted Tommy Lawton to continue to play for Everton, and also to make guest appearances for nearby clubs such as Tranmere Rovers and Chester City.\n\nOn December 25, 1940, he played for Everton against Merseyside rivals Liverpool. As he recalled, \"The Tranmere people came into the dressing room, and asked if anyone wanted to play, as they were two men short. I said, 'Go on, I'll help you out.' And I did.\" He went with the Rovers to their away game against nearby Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra, and played a full 90 minutes in the afternoon, after having already done so on Christmas morning.\n\nWhen The War ended in 1945, he was transferred to West London's Chelsea, and played in their friendly against Soviet champions Dynamo Moscow in their 1945 postwar tour of Britain. After 2 years at Stamford Bridge, he went to Nottingham to play for Notts County, winning the Third Division South in 1950. However, that year, the Football Association considered him, at age 30, too old to be a part of England's World Cup team, which was an ignominious failure.\n\nHe spent the 1952-53 season back in West London as player-manager of Brentford, and then ran out the string in North London with Arsenal. He arrived with the Gunners as League titleholders, and played in their Charity Shield victory over the FA Cup holders, the Blackpool side of Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen. In 1956-57, he ended his career as player-manager of Northamptonshire side Kettering Town, leading them to the Southern League title. He later managed Notts County, and Kettering Town once again.\n\nHe later scouted for Notts County and wrote a newspaper column, but, as with many soccer legends, retirement was not kind to him, and twice in the 1970s, he nearly went to prison for theft due to unpaid debts. He died on November 6, 1996, in Nottingham, of pneumonia, at the age of 77. His family had him cremated, and donated the urn with his ashes to the National Football Museum in downtown Manchester.\n\n*\n\nOctober 6, 1920: Hal Chase and the aforementioned Heinie Zimmerman are indicted on bribery charges, as an aftermath of the investigation into the previous year's World Series. New York Giants manager John McGraw would end up testifying that he released them after the 1919 season for throwing games, and for trying (apparently, without success) to entice Fred Toney, Rube Benton and Benny Kauff to join them.\n\nZimmerman denies the charges. Chase ignores them, and the case against both gets dropped because California refuses to extradite Chase to Illinois, due to an incorrectly issued arrest warrant. Both will be banned for life from baseball by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis when he becomes Commissioner.\n\nGame 2 of the World Series is played on the same day as the indictment. Wheeler Johnston pinch-hits for the Cleveland Indians in the 9th inning. His brother Jimmy Johnston is playing 3rd base for the Brooklyn Robins (forerunners of the Dodgers). They thus become the 1st brothers to take opposite sides in a World Series. The Robins win, 3-0, on a shutout by spitballer Burleigh Grimes, and tie the Series 1-1. But this will be the high point of World Series play for the Brooklyn franchise until 1947.\n\nOctober 6, 1921: Game 2 of the World Series. Waite Hoyt pitches a 2-hit shutout, and the Yankees beat the New York Giants 3-0, taking a 2 games to 0 lead. The talk is that the style of Babe Ruth (power, power and more power hitting) has supplanted that of Giant manager John McGraw (strategy, strategy and more strategy), especially since McGraw had ordered starting pitcher Art Nehf to \"unintentionally-intentionally walk\" Ruth, and he did so, 3 times.\n\nBut Ruth tried to foil this strategy by stealing 2nd and 3rd base after one of the walks. When he slid into 3rd, he scraped his elbow, and it got infected. It didn't end up killing him (though, in those pre-antibiotic days, it sure could have), but he had to leave Game 3 early, and the wound was lanced, rendering him unable to swing a bat for the rest of the Series. It was the 1st time a baserunning miscalculation by the Babe had cost the Yankees a World Series. It would not be the last.\n\nAlso on this day, Joseph Echols Lowery is born in Huntsville, Alabama. One of the last surviving leaders of the original Civil Rights Movement, he and Martin Luther King founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957. He served as its President from 1977 to 1997. In 2009, he gave the benediction at President Barack Obama's Inauguration, and Obama granted him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nOctober 6, 1922: Game 3 of the World Series. Neither the Yankees nor the controversial ending to yesterday's game can stop the Giants momentum, as Jack Scott pitches a 4-hit shutout, and singles and scores the Giants' 1st run in the 3rd inning, as the Giants win 3-1.\n\nAlso on this day, Joseph Filmore Frazier is born in Liberty, North Carolina. An ordinary outfielder in the major leagues from 1947 to 1956, he became a manager, and won Pennants with 5 different minor-league teams, including the Tidewater Tides, the Mets' top farm team, in 1975. He was then promoted to Mets manager for 1976, and led them to a 3rd place finish.\n\nBut he lost 30 of the 1st 45 games in 1977, and he was fired. Joe Torre, then still playing, was hired to replace him. Frazier managed in the Cardinal organization afterward, and died in 2011, age 88. Being white, he was no relation to the boxing champion of the same name, who died 8 months later.\n\nOctober 6, 1923: In a regular-season game, Ernie Padgett of the Boston Braves, in only his 2nd major-league appearance, pulls off an unassisted triple play in a doubleheader sweep of the Phillies. It is the 1st such play in NL history.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia in 1899, the infielder would only last 5 seasons in the majors, and died in 1957 in East Orange, Essex County, New Jersey.\n\nAlso on this day, 2 of the classic stadiums of the Big Ten Conference open. Memorial Stadium opens on the campus of the University of Illinois in Champaign. The Fighting Illini beat Nebraska 24-7, and, led by sophomore running back Harold \"Red\" Grange, go on to win the National Championship.\n\nThe stadium's dedication game wouldn't come until the next season, October 18, 1924, when Grange would put on a legendary show in a win over Michigan.\n\nAlso on this day, College Field opens on the campus of Michigan State College in East Lansing, but not with a game. The school would be renamed Michigan State University on its Centennial in 1955; the stadium, Macklin Field in 1935, Macklin Stadium in 1948, and Spartan Stadium in 1957. John Macklin was their football coach from 1911 to 1915.\n\nIt opened with 14,000 seats. By the time Clarence \"Biggie\" Munn was coaching the school's 1st great team in the early 1950s, it seated 51,000. When Hugh \"Duffy\" Daugherty coached its great team of the mid-1960s, it had peaked at 76,000. Today, it seats 75,005. It switched to artificial turf in 1969, and has kept it.\n\nAlso on this day, Minnesota hosts Iowa State at Northrop Field in Minneapolis. Iowa State's lone black player, Jack Trice gets hurt on the 2nd play of the game, breaking his collarbone. He insists he is all right, and stays in the game. But in the 3rd quarter, he tries to tackle a runner, falls, and 3 Minnesota players trample him. He is taken to a hospital, but doctors don't think his life is in danger, and is released as fit to travel back to Iowa State's campus in Ames. But he has suffered internal bleeding, and dies 2 days later at age 21.\n\nTrice was from the Cleveland area, and in 1979, that city's major paper, The Plain Dealer, investigated. A surviving Iowa State teammate, Johnny Behm, said, \"One person told me that nothing out of the ordinary happened. But another who saw it said it was murder.\"\n\nIn 1997, Iowa State's home field was named Jack Trice Stadium. It is the only stadium in the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly known as Division I-A) named for a black person. A statue of him stands outside.\n\nOctober 6, 1926: Game 4 of the World Series, at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis. Someone got a message to Babe Ruth, asking him to hit a home run for a sick kid in a hospital.\n\nHe hit one. And another. And another. It was the 1st time a player had hit 3 home runs in a World Series game. The Yankees win, 10-5, and tie up the Series with the Cardinals.\n\nThe boy's name was Johnny Sylvester. He got well, later met the Babe, and lived to be 74. In legend, the boy was dying, and the Babe visited him in the hospital, and promised him he'd hit a home run for him, and ended up hitting 3, and, hearing the game on the radio, little Johnny instantly began to get well. The truth is great enough, is Ruthian enough."
