        "text": "Duncan Dolton\n\nManor House 1943-1948\n\nA Fishes Tale: Swimming in Ever Bigger Pools\n\nAutobiography of Walter Duncan Dolton\n\nIn 1943 I was awarded a scholarship to Saint Lawrence College then evacuated to Courteen Hall, Northants, the ancestral home of Sir Harewood Wake. As a thirteen year old I found the rural setting and small number of fellow pupils – some sixty boys – congenial, but overshadowing it all was the knowledge of continual air raids on London, my home, by bombers, V1 (doodle bugs) and V2, (rockets).\n\nI have happy memories of the Old School Room with its wooden benches and central iron stove for warmth in winter, and of walking through the trees to the chemistry lab – a converted wooden shed. A life changing experience was a visit to the Lake District in 1944, organised by the Geography master, Roy Millward. It resulted in a lifelong love of physical geography and then later a long and happy retirement to the Lakes.\n\nI recall my surprise when during a routine ‘pastoral interview’ with my housemaster – the Reverend, (later Canon) Vickery asked if I had made any friends. On replying ‘none special’ he said I had been named ‘special friend’ by a majority of my fellows. Later, Richard Hewer, – who became Professor of Neurology at Bristol – did become a close friend. We shared the goal of becoming Medics and a preference for doing the evening dish washing up for a shilling rather than homework!\n\nBeing of a solitary disposition the return to Ramsgate after the war proved less congenial. The much increased number of students and return of the pre-war Housemaster Mr Drury resulted in the loss of a family atmosphere. Sadly, I became somewhat rebellious but nonetheless I met with success, both in the classroom and on the games field. I became captain of the U15 rugby XV and later captain of the 1st XV playing at hooker. Awarded my hockey colours on the field I became vice-captain of hockey, playing at right back.\n\nIn the classroom I was something of a polymath loving the arts subjects of history and geography at ‘shell’ level but in 1947 with sights set firmly on a medical career I opted for the Science VI. In 1948, my final year, I took chemistry, physics, zoology, and biology for Higher Certificate and was awarded both the Neil Science Prize. and to the expressed surprise of Dick Perfect, the Headmaster and adjudicator, the Baxter English Essay Prize.\n\nI was head of Manor House and School Captain that year before going to Christ’s College Cambridge to read for the Natural Science Tripos as a basis for subsequent medical degrees. At Christ’s, on being an O.L., I naturally played hockey for the college.\n\nMy clinical training at King’s College Hospital in London (1951-1954) involving real patients came as a relief after what seemed at the time an over emphasis on the academic study of human anatomy and physiology. I had emotional problems with the dissection of human remains. Again, I played hockey for the hospital.\n\nAfter qualification and training posts at King’s College Hospital, and St. Mary’s Hospital, Eastbourne, I was called up in 1956 to National Service in the Royal Navy as Medical officer to the HM Dockyard in Sheerness. I had environmental and industrial health responsibilities – an experience which lead eventually to a career in the public rather than individual health services. On demob I resumed my intended career as an assistant in General Practice at Murton a mining village in Durham. Here I saw barefoot children and ‘back-to-backs’ with outside latrines serving several dwellings – something as a southerner I had thought long gone.\n\nOne day in 1959 my wife, also a doctor and mother of a one year old, drew my attention to scholarships being awarded by Warwickshire County Council. I was awarded one and in return for three years service as an assistant County Medical Officer and School Medical Officer, I studied for a year at the London School of Hygiene for the Diploma in Public Health with all expenses met.\n\nFour years later in 1964 with a Diploma in Public Health, the requisite qualification for a career in public health, I took a post as an administrative medical officer with Birmingham City Council, the first rung on the ladder of success leading in ten years to being acting County Medical Officer of Health of Cheshire. In 1974 Medical Officers of Health were transferred from Local Authorities to the National Health Service, for me an effective demotion in both salary and status.\n\nAt the age of 45 there was still much to learn so a Regional post was preferred to a local one in Chester. Sadly, the quality of the Mersey Regional Health Authority did not compare with that of a first-class Local Authority (LA) like Cheshire County Council.\n\nThe move from LA to NHS was nevertheless an opportunity to broaden horizons. Responsibility for planning and research in a University Hospital based system was interesting and challenging. During these years (1974-1977) I was a visiting lecturer at Manchester University – arranging and contributing to Planning Courses for Senior Registrars and Consultants, and had the honour of being appointed chairman of the National Child Health Computing Committee.\n\nAppointed Liverpool Area Medical Officer in 1978, just prior to the opening of the new Royal Liverpool Hospital, proved challenging. The top management team of CEO, MO, Nursing Officer and Treasurer never met, the chairman only being briefed by the CEO before the monthly Health Authority meeting. I was glad to leave* and take up an appointment as a Senior Lecturer at London University and Professor at Riyadh University, Saudi Arabia. This was to be my last full time post.\n\nAwaiting return from Saudi Arabia in 1981 was a request from the Nursery Nurse Examination Board (NNEB) to develop an advanced qualification in early child care. This involved visits to many colleges of further education all over the UK – a demanding but worthwhile task.\n\nFruitless endeavours to get the NNEB and BTEC (the Business and Technology Educational Council) to cooperate led to an invitation to join the BTEC team responsible for the development of NVQ (National Vocational Qualifications) in childcare. The appointment proved much more congenial than struggling to manage an under-resourced health service!\n\nIn the remaining years of the century my experience of medical management was put to good use contributing to management training, courses for NHS consultants and registrars. By the time I had reached three score years and despite requests to continue, I felt it high time to fully retire from public service and make space for a younger and more up-to-date successor – a decision I have never regretted!\n\n*An account may be found on the internet under the title Dr Duncan Dolton – The Good Doctor Goes.\n\nDr John Church – Lodge 1949\n\n“A life of venture and adventure”\n\nMy father, John (or ‘Joe’), went to St Lawrence College at the age of ten. His father, Edward Joseph, was a clergyman in Cambridgeshire. Despite having limited primary schooling, Joe started writing early, and maintained dairies that he continued with throughout his life. His spelling at first was certainly quaint, as letters to his father show:\n\n“Dear Papa, Ples can you send me a Dnxry [dictionary]”\n\n“Ples send me a hokey stick… It lux like this”. This has an elementary sketch of a hockey stick!\n\nMy father never shone as a hockey player unlike his brother, Bill, who played for Cambridge University [and features on the recent front cover of the 2018 Old Lawrentian].\n\nWhilst at School, Joe witnessed a Zeppelin attack on Ramsgate in 1915. He reports in his diary: “Zeppelin raid. Woken up by 2am by explosions. Watched Zeppelin from opposite dorm…”\n\nMy parents were both doctors. They became engaged in 1927. Joe then went to East Africa to serve in a medical branch of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). With colleagues, he founded eight hospitals in Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi in the 1920s and 30’s. My mother came out to Africa to marry my father in 1930 in Kampala Cathedral, Uganda. I was born in 1931 the eldest of five children – John, David, Robin, Michael and Janine.\n\nJoe was very much a product of the medical training of the early 1900s. He never had any postgraduate training, never read any medical journals (my mother did that and passed it on) but he was an excellent ‘bedside’ doctor. My mother was one of the first lady doctors to be trained at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Like my father she had no further medical training. But she learned how to do caesarean sections, and other surgical procedures, and performed them if my father was away. They were a great team and gave us a sense of ‘venture and adventure’, reflecting their personalities and character. Joe, before he was married, was somewhat of a daredevil, and got into a number of escapades including being nearly killed by a man-eating leopard which lunged at him and got its jaws around the back of his head, his life being saved by a young man, Kosiya Shalita. Kosiya, years later, became one of the first Rwandan Anglican bishops.\n\nMy own early life until teenage years was in East Africa, and my early education was influenced entirely by what Africa could offer at that time. In order to meet the needs of the children of Missionary families, my parents founded a school, the Kabale Preparatory School, of which I am thereby the oldest old boy! This school now musters some 400 pupils, mostly Ugandans. At age ten I had to go to Kenya, for ongoing Primary and Secondary schooling. But the Second World War had led to a ‘brain drain’ from East Africa into British forces in the Far East. School staffing suffered accordingly.\n\nI came to St Lawrence College in 1946-1949, aged 15-18. I had to work extremely hard to catch up because of the East African background. I also had to learn Latin if I was to get to Cambridge to study Medicine as my father had done.\n\nMy experience at St Lawrence felt very alien at first because I had spent my whole life in Africa up till then. At 15 I became guardian to my brother, David, in post-war austerity Britain. With a ration book in one hand and a Lloyds Bank cheque book in the other, we were on our own, with no clear base in this country. We both felt very loyal to our parents’ calling but also felt rather bereft and confused. No-one could really look after us – relatives or others. However we got on better in the Christian environment – with the CSSM summer camps, and ‘Walrus cruises’ on the Norfolk Broads. These cruises were started by my father every Easter, and ran for decades. We were loyal to the School’s Christian ethos, but it was a struggle nonetheless.\n\nThere were a number of friends from amongst other East African families who were sent to Ramsgate because of its Christian foundation. These included the Hopcrafts who were farming folk from East Africa, John and Peter becoming life-long friends. But it was difficult because we had entered the school quite late. ‘Fagging’ was also still a big part of School life.\n\nSt Lawrence was by and large a better environment and a welcome change. David and I came in so late that we were regarded as ‘interlopers’ in Lodge. We used to go exploring at night in the tunnels under Ramsgate with torches. We found an extensive network of tunnels hewn out of the chalk that had been used for smuggling over the centuries. We had a lot of fun down there but on looking back, it was clear that anything could have happened – it was so dangerous!\n\nThen Donald Drew, my Lodge Housemaster, left the School whilst I was there and, as the senior pupil and a Lodge School Prefect, I was temporarily made the Housemaster, by the Head Master, Canon Perfect. I had to cane small boys for their minor misdemeanours. That I found extremely difficult, particularly as I also had to sleep in the same dormitory with some of them! A lot of acrimony developed, and I felt very let down by the School for making me take this role. However I did this for six months, and the School appointed a House Master after I left.\n\nDavid and I didn’t see our parents again until 1952 (some five years later). Joe was also away a lot anyway so I didn’t see much of him even then. Communication during that time was a weekly letter from us, and one by return from them. I still have these letters. However we didn’t share with them our difficulties – we always presented a brave face.\n\nI wasn’t much of a sportsman but I became Captain of Shooting, and enjoyed it thoroughly. My younger brothers, David and Robin, were also in the Shooting teams and Robin did particularly well in the Ashburton Cup, the inter-Schools championship. I studied Physics, Chemistry and Biology and a bit of Latin (a requirement for Cambridge at that time). I especially remember Mr. Sanderson, the Physics teacher. The teachers were good people – and got the best out of me. They were very supportive and enthusiastic of me getting into Cambridge to read Medicine.\n\nI went up to Cambridge in September 1949, and joined Emmanuel College as my father and uncles had done. Cambridge was a revelation, and I was very well supported by the Cambridge University Christian Union. I completed my medical training at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, from 1952-55.\n\nI met my wife Rhoda as a nurse at ‘Barts’ and we were married in 1958. We joined my parents in Rwanda in September 1959 for me to take over the running of the hospital from my father. Despite having no further training after leaving ‘Barts’, he was a great ‘bedside’ doctor, and he taught me how to use my own senses and to practice ‘solo’ medicine – I did not do a ward round with another doctor for four years! I learnt how to recognise medical conditions like typhoid fever simply by sensing the odour of the patients and their clothes.\n\nNo sooner had we arrived in Rwanda but we were caught up in the first phase of the Rwandan civil war, and my plans to improve the hospital service went on hold as a consequence. At one stage I was only one of 24 doctors in the whole of Rwanda [population then 2.5 million] and had to deal with all the carnage of the genocide that went on at that time. We moved four times in four years because we had to go where needs were most pressing, all with very limited resources. My father had had similar experiences and but with basic medical skills was able to build his hospital nonetheless in Sept 1927. Like my father, we had no electricity, no blood transfusions, or running water. I had to undertake surgery in these conditions in the same way that my mother had performed caesarean sections. It is incredible how you improvise though. For example I was sure we could use tropical sunlight to make hospital linen sterile, but we had no means to test the efficacy of such! Unfortunately there were death threats and my parents had to leave urgently, never to return to work in Rwanda. Rhoda and I similarly effectively became refugees.\n\nMy last ten years in East Africa (1963-1973) were spent in teaching hospitals, in Uganda and Kenya. It was tremendously rewarding, especially as our young doctors were taught to deal with everything and anything with limited resources, the very antithesis of specialist and super-specialist training in the developed world today. The academic team in Makerere University, Kampala, were a remarkable mixture. In Anatomy I had the privilege of using an early electron microscope, looking at skeletal muscle development and repair. We were studying the ‘Satellite Cell of Skeletal Muscle’, which is now recognised as a resident stem cell. I submitted my work to Cambridge University and was awarded a prize winning MD in 1968.\n\nIn 1969 I was invited to join the founding Faculty of the newly emerging medical school for Kenya, in Nairobi, where I headed up the Orthopaedic Department.\n\nIn 1973 I started applying for jobs in the UK, and was shortlisted for a number although was considered by some as a misfit because of my ‘unorthodox’ background. However I was offered a Lectureship by Prof Brian McKibbin at the University of Cardiff who took me under his wing. He was working on fracture repair in sheep, and wrote a definitive work on fracture management.\n\nI could have remained in academia but chose instead to join the NHS as an orthopaedic surgeon.\n\nIn September 1975 I was appointed as Consultant Orthopaedic and Accident Surgeon to Wycombe General Hospital in Buckinghamshire, and this became my definitive professional appointment. This was very rewarding as, with an excellent array of colleagues, we were able to create from two earlier ‘Cottage’ hospitals a thoroughgoing District General Hospital. My on-going research included developing a ‘modular’ concept of total hip replacement. I was also for a while the UK Chairman of a charity World Orthopaedic Concern, which, as its name implies, is involved with the training and practice of medical personnel in Orthopaedics in the wide range of challenging environments in under-privileged parts of the world.\n\nIn 1991, aged 60, I retired from the NHS in order to revisit some of my research interests. These included the use of maggots as cleansing agents in recalcitrant and infected wounds and ulcers. This idea had started in Rwanda where seriously injured people could be left for days before they were found, or crawled to safety. It was noted that some of the wounds that were infested with maggots were remarkably clean, and the patients were not dying of gangrene or septicaemia or tetanus. Our experiences matched that of European military surgeons, including Napoleon’s Surgeon-General! Using this research, I created my own fly culture laboratory, and helped create a laboratory preparing maggots for clinical use. We founded the International Biotherapy Society [IBS], and the therapy, known as Maggot Débridement Therapy [MDT], is now international.\n\nThe maggot work led indirectly into another absorbing interest, the use of ‘sniffer dogs’ to detect conditions such as cancer. This started with a letter to ‘The Lancet’ where a young lady had a dog that was paying persistent attention to a ‘mole’ on her leg. She sought medical advice, had a biopsy, and this revealed that it was a malignant melanoma. The dog had effectively saved her life.\n\nThen I was giving a lecture to senior students with the above story, when one of the students told me that his father had a dog that had shown excessive interest in a patch of ‘eczema’ beneath his trousers. He also sought medical advice and a biopsy revealed another skin cancer!\n\nI then met a team of dog trainers from the ‘hearing dogs’ arena, and we put together a proof of principle study, training selected dogs to recognise cancer of the bladder from urine samples provided by volunteer patients. This was highly successful and received front page attention in the British Medical Journal. This led to the creation of a new charity, Medical Detection Dogs [MDD]. Our dogs are now being trained to recognise a range of cancers and also to alert to the crises of patients with metabolic diseases such as diabetes, or with nut allergies, and even harbouring malaria.\n\nThroughout all this, I am indebted primarily to my parents, but also to an ‘army’ of loyal and supportive colleagues, without whom most of the above could never have happened!\n\nDr John Church\n\nDecember 2018\n\nDr Ashok Khosla OBE\n\nCourtenay 1958\n\nAshok Khosla is one of world’s leading experts on environment and sustainable development. He was awarded the 2002 United Nations Sasakawa Environment Prize – the premier global prize in the field of environment, the 2004 Schwab Foundation Award for Outstanding Social Entrepreneur, the OBE in 2008 and the Zayed International Environment Prize in 2014. In 2011, Dr Khosla was awarded the WWF’s highest honour, the Duke of Edinburgh Conservation Medal at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his outstanding, life-long service to the environment.\n\nBorn in India in 1940, the son of a university professor and a college lecturer, Khosla studied in various schools in some half dozen countries before he joined St Lawrence College, Ramsgate, Kent in 1955 to complete his last three years of high school. Subsequently, he graduated with a degree in natural sciences from Peterhouse, Cambridge University before going on to do a PhD in experimental physics at Harvard University.\n\nAfter a period of teaching courses at Harvard in Physics, Cosmology and the Environment – he was part of the team that designed and taught the world’s first undergraduate course on the environment – he returned to his native India where he became the founding director of the Indian government’s Office of Environmental Planning and Co-Ordination, the first such agency in a developing country. Over the next five years, he pioneered the design and implementation of the basic systems and structures needed to integrate the environment into the development process of a developing economy and to set and meet national environmental goals. Much of the rapid build-up of policy making processes and of public knowledge on environmental issues at the time was a result of the work done by the teams he led.\n\nIn 1976, he was appointed director in the United Nations Programme (UNEP), where he designed and launched INFOterra, the first global environmental information exchange. He oversaw the design and implementation of this international network, helping UNEP establish, in more than 100 countries, a solid recognition of the importance of reliable information and the need for environmental institutions. He remained with UNEP until 1982.\n\nIn 1983, Khosla founded the Development Alternatives group (DA) of organisations whose mission is to help make national development strategies in India become more environmentally and socially sustainable. Development Alternatives quickly became one of the leading environmental agencies in India and is now recognised worldwide as a premier institution concerned with the environment and sustainable development. Some of the DA’s more significant achievements include: Introduction into the market of more than 25 new environmentally sound and commercially viable technologies. These include machines for weaving handloom textiles, making recycled paper and fabricating low-cost roofing materials, devices that use renewable energy for cooking, lighting and electricity, and the construction of low-cost housing.\n\nThe work of the DA Group has led to the creation of more than half a million sustainable jobs and livelihoods in several states of India, the reduction of several thousand tons of carbon emissions and numerous other sustainable development outcomes. An evaluation of one project funded by the UK Department of International Development (DFID) found that the outcome of the project included empowerment of 6.6 million rural citizens.\n\nHe has been a board member of numerous global environmental organizations – including as President of the Club of Rome, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and as member of the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Winnipeg and World Resources Institute, India. He has served as an adviser to, among others, the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and the Indian government. From 2008 to 2017, he was Co-Chair of the UN’s International Resource Panel\n\nIn his presentation speech for the Sasakawa Award Klaus Toepfer, Executive Director of UNEP, described Khosla as “a legend in the realm of sustainable development, and an individual who personifies the hopes and dreams of billions trapped in the indignity of acute deprivation.”\n\nIn the early 1960s, before the environment had become a public issue, he was a leading member of the team that designed and taught the first undergraduate course on the environment at Harvard University. Many features of the complex interactions between the environment and economic systems, human population and natural resources were recognised and explored in this ground-breaking course – some of the impacts of which are documented in the book The Earth in Balance written by a student of the course, former United States Vice-President, Mr. Al Gore.\n\nJack Stanley\n\nTower 1955\n\nQ1. I went to SLC in January 1951. My parents were divorced and I lived with my mother. My home life was a bit chaotic, to say the least. I passed the 11+ and went to grammar school in Battersea. I stayed there for four terms and was allocated a social worker who lived nearby. It was she who arranged for me to attend an interview at what was then L.C.C. HQ with Rev. R.Perfect, which changed the course of my life as it was agreed that I should go to SLC. I have always assumed that my fees and extras were met by LCC. I do not, however know this for a fact.\n\nQ2. My favourite subjects were English with Mr.Wheeler, French with Mr.Clifford and RS with M.M-Harvey, my House-master of Tower.\n\nQ3. My favourite teachers were those mentioned above, together with Mr.Smith the Art teacher.\n\nQ4. I had only played soccer at my grammar school, so hockey, rugby and swimming were all new to me, and these, in season, became my favourites.\n\nQ5. I considered Trevor Cox, John Isaac and Mickie Ormerod to be my closest friends.\n\nQ6. The things that I valued most about my time and education at SLC were the feelings of security and safety that were there all the time. I was not a particularly scholarly boy leaving with only 2 O Levels – English and English Lit., and instead put more of my efforts into sport. I had 8 or 9 subjects on my time-table, but come exams I was not very successful!\n\nQ7. The qualities and values that SLC taught me were honesty and Christian love for my fellows.That may sound a little pompous, but it is what it is!\n\nQ8. I played rugby at 2nd XV level and hockey at 2nd XI level, and was awarded School colours for swimming. I got House colours for all three sports. Does that count?\n\nQ9. After I left I went into insurance for a few months before I signed up for a three-year stint in the RAF, which I served in Germany. I then went back into insurance for a year, before applying to a teacher-training college in Norwich where I followed a three-year course in English and Games.I obtained a post at The Hewett School in Norwich, teaching A Level and GCSE and becoming responsible for CSE English.\n\nQ10. I still maintain contact with John Isaac and Brian Moore.\n\nQ11. I think that my friends would describe me as having a good sense of humour, being reliable , open-minded and tolerant.\n\nQ12. I would like to be remembered as a loving and devoted husband, father, grand-father and great-grandfather.\n\nJohn Isaac\n\nTower 1955\n\nRegarded as bright I entered the scholarship stream to ‘O’ level in two years. My Prep School report must have been interesting because after a year at St Lawrence I was bottom of the form and stayed for a second year in that form. Having moved up in year three in the same scholarship stream I had two more years coming bottom in that form! My mother always said that my father sent me to school to play games and certainly I enjoyed that but academically fortnightly orders always meant that Monday was a time of dread. Encouragement – the cane – had the opposite effect to that intended.\n\nHaving failed all ‘O’ levels on the first time round, I managed to obtain 6 before I left, 4 science and two English. In those days dyslexia and learning difficulties were not recognized but the staff never lost interest in my progress and I must thank The Rev. Martin Martin-Harvey for his support and understanding. I never lost respect for him in spite of the relatively frequent confrontations with my backside. One accepted that that was the way in those days.\n\nHockey and Quad-hockey, and Tennis were my main interests but rugger was not a sport to which I aspired. Having musical parents I found great pleasure in playing a piccolo and graduating to a flute in the school orchestra under the very talented Dennis Cocks. To Mr Cocks I am indebted to receiving the gifts of Bizet’s Symphony in C and Smetana’s Bartered Bride as he updated his 78’s to vinyl. Being in the choir has also taught me to enjoy choral singing.\n\nI was surrounded by very clever contemporaries who, although great friends, did unwittingly affect my lasting self image. Coming bottom I was nicknamed ‘Yobby’ – ‘Yob’ being a play on ‘backward boy’! Even my closest Lawrentian friend called me that to his dying day and it was not until I retired as a Managing Director that I realized that I could not have been that daft.\n\nMy affinity with SLC was such that I joined the Old Lawrentian Society and have been on the committee for most of my adult life. My grammar school educated wife (also dyslexic but very clever) became an ardent supporter of SLC and all that it stood for. Every visit she remarked on the obvious happiness of the pupils and their smart appearance and polite helpfulness. My Reverend father, and my mother who had been three years at Bible College, brought me up to be a Christian and no doubt it was the SLC Christian foundation that drew them to Ramsgate. Whilst at school I supported the Christian Union regularly but it was not until on National Service in Korea that I consciously decided to ‘start again’ and work out for myself my faith and make it my own. However, I cannot say I was converted then because I had never been unconverted, thanks to my Christian parents.\n\nOn leaving SLC and waiting for National Service call up, I did some work as a builders’ labourer and also worked as an electrician’s mate on the local council estate installing electric wiring in council houses. Then I got called up. Starting in the Royal Sussex Regiment lead to officer training at Eaton Hall and then to join the regiment in Korea. I was immensely privileged to be given the Assault Pioneer Platoon which in an infantry regiment was the dog’s body that had to do everything from digging latrines to clearing minefields. I did not get to doing the former but I did have to clear and de-fuse mines. However, most of my time was leading my platoon in building a memorial to the ‘Glorious Glosters’ which I am glad to say is still there and regularly visited by Koreans and tourists alike. Having taken six weeks to sail to Korea in HMT Devonshire in comparative luxury, it only took five weeks to sail in HMT Asturias to our next assignment in Gibraltar. As the Assault Pioneer Platoon was being disbanded as an infantry unit I found my life had little ‘army’ and much sport as battalion sports officer and plenty of hockey on an all weather pitch.\n\nReturning home in December after National Service I had to work out what to do next. On February 3rd 1958 I joined a major firm of Lloyd’s brokers and set my heart on making it my life. However, exam experience dissuaded me from taking insurance exams so the only qualification I had was experience. When I became a director in 1973 I realised that if I had done the exam courses without taking the exams, the incidents that one comes across as a broker would have made more sense in half the time. Many events would fly over one’s head because one had not ‘done the homework’. However, by joining a small firm one had to have a very broad general knowledge and ‘we try harder’ to compete with the very much larger firms.\n\nLater on in my career my broad general knowledge was invaluable as a consultant to major banks lending big money to ship owners who assigned their insurance as security to the bank. In the last ten years of my career, my colleague and I set up and ran a specialist broking house where he, the entrepreneur, drove flat out on the Cresta Run from the front of the bobsleigh whilst I was behind as his brakeman. It was a most exhilarating experience and very gratifying to see that the company 20 years later is very considerably larger than when I retired.\n\nAt about the time of retiring I was invited to become a governor of St Lawrence under Gordon Mungeam. During the next ten years St Lawrence did more development and enhancing of the college than had been achieved in the previous fifty years. I was always very keen that the Christian ethos of the school should not be compromised and governors were expected to sign, agree and support its core principles. Under the present Principal I am glad that the agreement has been made even more explicit. St Lawrence is a Christian school. It is to be noted that parents of other faiths are happy that their offspring should be educated in this Christian environment where the Christian principles are foremost. Those values of love in the widest sense, integrity and respect underlie and provide for a positive career and contribution to society and family life.\n\nChristopher Burley\n\nGrange 1955\n\nWhen did you go to St Lawrence College and why?\n\nI went to St Lawrence in the summer term of 1951 primarily because of my asthma. We had smog in NW London and it was pretty unhealthy so the prescribed wisdom was to live on the coast, preferably in the south east. The same thing happened to my father who had a prep school in Cliftonville. My parents knew, and were impressed by, a number of people who were Old Lawrentians including the Headmaster of my Prep school. I also liked St Lawrence College and the boys that I met when I visited so, although I was due to go to Greshams, a public school in Norfolk, I ended up in Ramsgate instead.\n\nFavourite subject(s)?\n\nMy favourite subject was Maths.\n\nFavourite teacher(s)?\n\nMy A level subjects were Maths, Physics and Art and, perhaps unsurprisingly, the teachers that I liked most were those teaching these subjects. A.G. Gallant taught me Maths (known as ‘Aggy’), Physics was Geoffrey Matthews and the Art teacher was Mr Smith. I got on well with them all. I was the only boy in the Science 6th doing Art. Mr Smith knew that I was considering Architecture as a career and suggested that I might not find the creative aspect of this profession as easy as I hoped. As a consequence I started to look into Accountancy which turned out to be an incredibly helpful piece of advice. In fact I regret not having the opportunity of thanking him for turning me towards this career which worked out very well for me. I hugely enjoyed my career and would never have considered this profession had it not been for him triggering the whole thought process and a complete change of direction. I will always be grateful to him.\n\nFavourite sport(s) – if any?\n\nI played a bit of cricket and tennis but my asthma stopped me from participating fully. Interestingly though, the fact that being unable to play sport as much as others gave me a greater determination to succeed in all other parts of my life.\n\nWho were your closest friends?\n\nMy closest friend was Tony Bowell. We were both at the same Prep school in Herne Bay and both started in the same term and belonged to same House. I have also remained friends with Roy Davidson and Sam Musgrove who joined the same House in the previous term, and Anthony Close from another House but who lived in the same town as my parents.\n\nI am also in contact with Donald Fromow, whom I see regularly although not in 2018 as his wife has not been well. He was in Lodge from 1951 to 1956 but we were in the same classes before we went into different sixth forms .\n\nWhat did you value most from your education (what mattered most about your education)?\n\nThe Christian ethos was the most important thing that I got from the School. It was extremely strong with the presence of the Head, Dick Perfect, and the Housemaster, Martin Martin-Harvey, and a lot of the boys were sons of clergymen or missionaries. We had a strong Christian Union which played an important part in my life. I was confirmed at the College and came to maturity in the Christian faith whilst there. In fact the Archbishop of Canterbury, Geoffrey Fisher, confirmed me in February 1953 just before he performed the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June!\n\nWhat qualities and values did St Lawrence teach you?\n\nThe Christian ethics and integrity were pretty central. However being an only child and asthmatic, the School taught me independence and self-confidence – I must have been a pain in the rear end when I left School because I thought I knew everything and that I could conquer the world. However having a decent degree of confidence has stood me in good stead in later life.\n\nWhat career(s) did you follow?\n\nThanks to Mr Smith I went into Accountancy. I did my ‘apprenticeship’ or articles with a small firm of accountants in London rather than go to University. I qualified as a Chartered Accountant after five years at c23 years old and joined Price Waterhouse, one of the large firms, in order to get wider experience. My intention was to spend two or three years there and move on a company like Unilever. However I spent the rest of my career there and enjoyed it greatly. I became a Partner in 1972 and in 1983 I became Managing Partner for Price Waterhouse in the Thames Valley for the last ten years of my working life.\n\nOther activities?\n\nOutside of work I became very involved with the Church. I was a member of the Bishop’s Council and Vice-Chairman of the Board of Finance for the Oxford Diocese. I have been admitted to The Order of St Frideswide. This award recognises “outstanding contributions from lay people in the Diocese” and is similar to ordained people being made honorary canons of the cathedral. Only about twenty people have been admitted to the Order since its inception at the beginning of this century, so it is quite a select group and I feel very privileged to be a member. I have also served as a treasurer and churchwarden of our local church. I am currently a pastoral care visitor and am permitted to take holy communion to people in their own homes when they are unable to get to church which is another privilege. On an entirely separate note, I have also been a big Bridge player playing at County level and had pre-trials for England and the final trial for Senior England. It satisfied my competitive spirit!\n\nI am married to Delia, a retired doctor, who worked in general practice and then ran the diabetic retinopathy screening clinics at our two hospitals. We have two sons who were educated at Radley which is nearer to our home than Ramsgate! One is a scientist and the other an illustrator. What could be more different?!\n\nAre you still in touch with fellow Old Lawrentians?\n\nI am still in touch with four Old Lawrentians (mentioned above) which is pretty good after 63 years or so! We have had reunions recently which have been great.\n\nHow would your friends describe you?\n\nI have never really thought about it. I have always had the reputation for having a fairly loud voice though! I was pretty studious and enjoyed academic work.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nOne of my principal aims in life is to make is to make a positive difference to the lives of all with whom I come into contact. I obviously don’t achieve this, but I would like to be remembered for trying and never giving up!\n\nRichard Ward\n\nTower 1953-1956\n\nI started at St. Lawrence, in Tower, in 1953. My father, Group Captain Ralph Ward, had been posted to Peru as Commercial Attache in the Embassy in Lima in 1952 and I had a year at school and leant Spanish there.\n\nThen I was sent back to England and lived with my grandparents during school holidays for a year before my parents returned. The same grandparents, Christophersons, who had sent their two sons Bernard and Clifford to St. Lawrence a generation before, and Clifford junior and their grandson Dudley Carr were in Tower with me too – my first cousins.\n\nI was never clever! But loved English. I got O levels in English Language & Lit., Spanish, French, and, afterwards, Biology. I hated most sports, apart from swimming and table-tennis, but loved birdwatching near Sandwich, and growing veggies.\n\nAnd thus I left in 1956 and was sent to Madrid to live with a family to polish up my Spanish – and 6 months later became a garden apprentice at Dartington Hall Gardens in Devon for 2 years.\n\nNever looked back after that. Worked at Hastings Parks Dept.; Slococks Nursery in Woking; student course at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; College of Park and Recreation Adminstration; Copenhagen Parks Dept.; Landscape Assistant for Harlow New Town Development Corporation; Landscape Assistant and Senior Technical Officer at London Boroughs of Hammersmith and Richmond; then set up my own Landscape contracting company 40 years ago near to Kew Gardens where I have lived since 1972 – and which totters on to this day. Best job in world.\n\nI have been involved in Round Table and Rotary for over 50 years, and The Kew Guild as Dinner MC and Editor. These interests must have stemmed from an unconcious ethic learned at St. Lawrence – of organising, preplanning, fund-raising, voluntary work, and travel.\n\nMy Polish wife Wiena and I have two daughters aged 29 and 31, and 1 grandson aged 3.\n\nEx-Tower friends from the 50’s are Chris Coburn, Gordon Bland, and Anthony ‘Slim’ Robins. We usually meet up annually, with partners as applicable, and enjoy a drink or two.\n\nJohn Webb\n\nLodge 1959\n\nI was dispatched to Ramsgate aged 12 as my brother Christopher was there. At his funeral in 2012, the vicar referred to his time at St Lawrence as not having been particularly happy ‘and he never talked about it’. I suppose in any community there are those who can or enjoy making life uncomfortable and I believe, with some evidence, this to have been so for Christopher.\n\nThat it was probable is reinforced by my experience. True there were happy, enjoyable times and whilst any unpleasantness was not physical it was psychological which possibly worse.\n\nFurther I found, surprisingly for an establishment who presented Christian ethics as a ‘USP’ the application of regulation and rule anything but dispassionate, more akin to that currently meted out by football/rugby referees. Looking back over some 65 years or so since I believe now this was the first step in a journey to reach in later life a more philosophical/pragmatic approach to the world of belief and religious faith. There is in any community the good, bad and indifferent. That I have observed over many years is as true of faith communities as those not aligned to any faith.\n\nMy achievements at SLC were modest. Although not built for sport I won Athletic Standards points for the House and was part of the Platoon that won The Drill Cup for it for the first time. Notwithstanding expectations I passed the 4 O levels I had been limited to, rocketing me at the first attempt into the Sixth Form.\n\nMy favourite subject – if I had one – or the one where my talent was recognised was Art. Being in the B Stream that finished after year one. I can still hear the Art Master (Mr Smith?) declaiming at the end of our final session: ‘there are two who should continue in the Art Room, Hatch and Webb.’ ‘This place produces no end of doctors but no artists’. I thought that would filter up to those who determined timetables or the like. But no. Apart from one term ‘doing art’ in the ‘hobby period’ there was no contact at all – of which more later.\n\nAnother was science, especially Physics. Not least the personality and stunning teaching ability of Mr Garden (R A Garden – known as ‘RAG’ Garden)\n\nThe powers that be had, probably with little expectation of success determined that for A Level I would study History and Geography. Ugh! The Careers Master felt I’d make a good Civil Engineer. But then he never struck me as equipped with the highest of wise perception. If I did not know to my cost that he had no sense of humour I’d have thought he was joking. I assume his advice was a) as I was good at physics, b) by then Chris was studying to be a Quantity Surveyor and c) my father was a Building Contractor – he built aerodromes in the war – of which a little more later.\n\nSo it was that in the summer I researched course requirements for professions with an art element but which did not require A levels. Ie I could get out in a year.\n\nArchitecture. I would just need two more O levels to accompany RE, English Language, English Literature and General Science. Elementary Maths and joy of joy Physics. My timetable included every class possible with ‘RAG’ Garden.\n\nFor good measure, I had to study some A levels. They were RE and English – the later meant I also went on every theatre trip – about which more later.\n\nThus after a year, I escaped into the freedom of The Brixton School of Building not having had any artistic education to help me start but qualifying in the late 1960s. My ‘Design Thesis’ was The National Theatre (long before Denis Lasdun’s splendid version was a seed of an idea) But it did mean I would have to go to the theatre regularly, research theatre buildings in detail and do so convincing my tutors it was work.\n\nAll this percolated into my professional life and came into its own in later charitable life/work.\n\nI set up my practice inviting partners to share in a growing workload and providing jobs for some 15 – 18 persons. I get a huge buzz from that. I retired from it after some 30 years having designed humble house extensions through ecclesiastical projects for most denominations, won appeals, conducted a public enquiry, appeared as expert witness but probably most fun were the recording studios for amongst others Hans Zimmer and David Gilmore.\n\nI took a keen interest in the Planning process and was for two years Chairman of one of the RIBA’s Planning Groups and served on its Regional Council.\n\nEarly in the life of the practice I ‘donated’ half of my time to a church-based youth music organisation producing and designing shows and tours. My theatre studies being useful.\n\nThis included ‘business managing’ artists including Gordon Giltrap, the folk group Parchment and the poet Stewart Henderson who I introduced to the BBC and who since became one of Radio 4’s regular presenters. A great friend.\n\nI produced and lit some of Cliff Richards’ charity concerts around the UK and in The Royal Albert Hall.\n\nSomehow in these work years, I found time to be a Local Authority Councillor, vice-chairman of Policy and Resources of Richmond-upon-Thames and pioneering the adoption of its Charter for the Environment. It was there I worked alongside a fellow Councillor, now in the House of Lords, with whom I worked closely as political advisor to and fundraiser for Vince Cable.\n\nI retired from all that including architecture at the turn of the millennium and since have continued a consultancy solving people’s problems with Planners.\n\nBefore retirement I was appointed a trustee of one of our largest local grant making trusts which had recently sold land to Sainsbury’s, going from being almost ‘broke’ to worth £22.6 million. During my 8 years as Chairman of Trustees we by careful investment saw that rise to some £36m. On retirement it was gratifying to be described as ‘having put it onto a proper business footing’ and by ‘creative thinking gained more worth for the grants made’.\n\nIn my 40s I qualified for my Private Pilot’s Licence to which I added Instrument Meteorological and Night Ratings flying several types including from WWII a Chipmunk, Piper Cub and Spitfire. Flying kindled a yen to find airfields my father had built, eventually landing my plane at East Kirkby in Lincolnshire where I met folk he had known in the War and their families. One who had flown for several seasons the BBMF Lancaster. Small world. ‘RAG’ of the CCF RAF Platoon would be impressed – or maybe not.\n\nRetired I can now do what I would have relished back in school days – paint. My paintings are in several private collections and have been exhibited at The Guardian Witness Awards, Chelsea Old Town Hall, Shoreditch Triangle Festival, Orleans House Gallery in Richmond. Currently, I am a site artist for the new stadium being built for Brentford Football Club. But oh, if only the view of Mr Smith had been heeded what might have been? I am now Artist in residence at BAFTA for 2 years 2019-2021 for the Multi-Million reconstruction of 195 Piccadilly, the former home of The Royal Institution of Painters in Watercolours. Here is a link to view some of my work https://johnawebb.weebly.com/bafta.html\n\nMy wife Sarah and I were married on Christmas Eve in 1977 in Hampton Court. It being an auspicious year for her The Queen sent a letter of best wishes to us which was nice. We have two sons – Simon who is blind runs marathons and works in the Music festival sector. His book on running the London Marathon receiving high praise on the BBC’s Marathon coverage from John Inverdale. And Edward who is forging a successful career in film. Two satisfyingly creative men.\n\nThus in all from an inauspicious start in Ramsgate, some might say ‘the boy done good’. I’m just glad to have ‘done some good’ – not much, but some. And on the way since SLC had a huge life of thoughtful discovery, satisfaction, fun and contribution to a variety of sectors.\n\nDavid Steed\n\nJunior School 1957\n\nI was at the Junior school when this photo was taken, we used it as a folded Christmas card, the printing must have been class produced and the signature mine. I have blanked out the recipient ( my father), I think the year was about 1953 when I was 8, it is sti\n\nll propped on my office desk. I became a border in Autumn 1952 at the age of 7 and then almost immediately developed Henoch-Schonlein purpura an unusual blood disorder initially diagnosed as appendicitis ( which they removed just in case ) which put me in Ramsgate Hospital for the rest of term, coming home for Christmas, a little too early and as a result missing most of the next term. Some memories are vivid, like abseiling from an upstairs Dormitory using the ” slow-release ” fire escape rope and harness system . Colonel Verbe in his small room below the stairs, who is best remembered for History, Fly fishing and Golf. Fights in Simmonds Hall using a rolled-up small piece of paper and an elastic band between thumb and first finger as the “gun”.\n\nA master who got so frustrated with us that he threw a compass at a boy who lifted the desk lid into which it impaled, and survived, the Master did not!\n\nMany ” it hurts me more than it will hurt you” caning moments ( it did hurt) It did me no harm and spurred me on to lead a useful life\n\nJust a few memories.\n\nDavid Steed\n\nSt Lawrence College Junior School\n\n1952-1957\n\nRobert David Straker\n\nLodge 1951-1955\n\nI have not kept in contact with St. Lawrence but have just done a bit of homework by looking up the most excellent web site. And, lo and behold, I found an article by my much esteemed old friend and contemporary, John Isaac.\n\nI recall leaving St. Lawrence a day early because, as Captain of Tennis I had entered us for the first time in the Youll Cup inter-schools championships at Wimbledon. We had done well locally but did not fare too well against the rest of the country. Little did I know that over fifty years later I would return there to be in the final of the Over 70’s Seniors Grass Court Championships.\n\nI then embarked on three years of study designed to equip me to manage the family printing business in London. My main contribution to student life was helping to give early bookings to the emerging jazz of The Temperance Seven.\n\nThere then followed two years of National Service. Having been commissioned in the RAOC I was fortunate to gain the only posting to Singapore. I like to think that the terrorists fled across the Thai border when they heard that I was coming, but in reality, the work had been done and I was able to devote nearly all my time to indulge in tennis and hockey for various teams including the Combined Services. On arrival, I formed a team that won the Singapore sixes competition. The Olympics were about to descend and I was fortunate to play hockey against the Singapore team to give them practice nearly every week on the Padang with the largest crowds I had encountered.\n\nThus, for the next year, I moved around the Far East playing hockey or tennis just about every day. The Army encouraged me to play tennis and I was able to travel and stay in the local Officers Mess in Penang or Hong Kong or wherever at your expense!\n\nBut I started taking an interest in arranging training during working hours for various sports as the people in my battalion had little else to do. And my brother officers enjoyed receiving the silverware that accrued in the sumptuous Officers Mess as a result. It was interesting to find that giving purpose, enthusiastic interest, training and success to otherwise disengaged people paid off. It was welcomed by just about everyone. In the sports that I lacked skill or knowledge about I soon found those who were useful and delegated to them provided they were industrious and keen. It gradually dawned on me that everyone seemed to be doing what I arranged without grumbling!\n\nThus I began to question just what I would be doing when returning to civilian life and I thought there might be more real value in joining the Probation Service. I do not possess the sort of faith that John Isaac exudes but I preferred to spend the rest of my life doing something I now perceived as useful. My parents kindly sent me the literature I required though they must have been disappointed at the old family firm having no heir.\n\nSo I ended up as the probation officer for Castleford and all villages to Selby amongst the Yorkshire coal fields. And, most important of all, it brought me nearer to Anne, who I fervently hoped might one day become my wife. Fortunately, she did.\n\nNow my southern accent must have seemed odd but when people feel attacked or upset I think they quickly detect where you are coming from and what your aims are. Whilst most people I met had harmed others in some way I soon found out that if the system put everyone who offended together, took all responsibility off them and then ensured that even a small number of people responsible for them made them feel like excrement, the result was likely to be worse behaviour. It seemed that the best approach was to show good behaviour and expect it – and keep them at home away from worse influences. Revenge is not sweet in the end.\n\nThus when the Home Office Inspectorate visited me some years later they at first assumed I had not filled in my statistical returns correctly. There was just one young person in Approved School Care and one in Borstal over several years. If the offence seemed serious enough I had offered “Probation” to The Magistrates or Judge. And I reported back to them regularly either on progress or lack of it. Most responded positively in time.\n\nSome nine years later, with two children, I sought a more senior position and better salary in Leicestershire. One of my new responsibilities was as Divorce Court Welfare Officer. Some years later, in the late seventies, I was responsible with enthusiastic colleagues for creating The Divorce Experience Course for separating couples in order to assist parents in alleviating the trauma for their children. Thus lessening the need for Courts and officials to try and sort it all out. I later ran short courses to teach others to do the same. I note from the internet that even today, over forty years later, various organisations have taken up the idea and offer similar courses to families splitting up. It is not often recognised how many organisations have been facilitated by probation officers responding to need over many years. And frequently these have been supported by volunteers and relieved the pressure on official bodies and the public purse.\n\nAnother initiative I led was the creation of a Day Centre for people who had offended in order to try and fill the gap between mildly conditional liberty and total custody. Yet again this depended on keen and dedicated staff who developed a positive education programme within an accepting and encouraging atmosphere whilst maintaining our own standards. In my view, this fairly enlightening initiative should have been developed further. Every city should have one! Instead, politicians sadly aided by some senior managers of the service, preferred the more popular but negative reliance on prisons. However, on the whole, I found being responsible for probation officers a very rewarding task. This was because almost without exception they were industrious, well-motivated and conscientious. They also supported new initiatives very often in their own time. I became a member of Round Table and on exchanging notes with other people who supervised workforces found I was very fortunate to have bright and dedicated staff from a wide range of background but with the simple aim to “advise, assist and befriend”. The mention of Round Table reminds me that this provided me with a refreshing contrast to work and in my final year I was the local Chairman during the demanding celebrations of its 50th anniversary. And later we formed a walking and theatre group which still offers variety to life.\n\nMy work as a probation officer was rather abruptly ended in the summer of 1992 at the age of fifty-five. I had continued to play hockey up to about forty but after a gap of nearly twenty years I took up tennis again instead. I had a great deal of enjoyment with a young partner leading my local team up the leagues to the top division and in my fifties also became involved in veteran’s tennis. One day I was playing in an inter-county match away in Cheshire and was coming back from 2-4 down in the final set. We won but as we shook hands at the net I had a heart attack. Oh dear! Life-changing moment. I was taken to the local hospital and later moved to Leicester where a few months later I was given heart surgery, a triple by-pass.\n\nAlthough I was able to take up tennis again this experience frightened me. So we moved up the road away from stairs to a bungalow where I started the more sedentary hobby of building a railway round the garden. (Google “David Straker Garden Railway” for a 2 min. clip.) By now the children had gone off to Uni. So for our summer holidays, my wife and I took up water-sports and over the years grew competent at mono-skiing, wakeboarding, sailing, windsurfing and of course I could not resist picking up my tennis racquet again. One of my opponents from the Cheshire match invited me to play in the doubles in our age group of the British Grass Court Championships at Wimbledon. This lead to an invitation to join the Veteran’s (now Seniors) Lawn Tennis Club of Great Britain. I served on the Committee of the club until I resigned a few months after my eightieth birthday. In the meantime trips abroad, tournaments and fixtures at home did not pass without incident. In 2008 I was playing for GB Vets. at The Queen’s Club when I had a cardiac arrest and they used their defibrillator for the first time! Apparently, I was taken to the nearby hospital and put in an induced coma for a few days before being returned to Leicester where eventually I was given my own implanted defibrillator. This was advised because I had earlier had another arrest whilst playing in the County Championships. Some people never learn!\n\nMy fear was countered by my enjoyment of various sports, so aged 80 years we embarked on our usual water sports/tennis holiday, this time in Croatia. Towards the middle of the holiday, the speedboat driver commented that I seemed to be a confident wakeboarder and asked if I had tried the new sport of wave surfing. So the next day of course I had to give it a go! I got up alright the first time but everyone in the boat including the photographer got very excited and this transmitted itself to me and I stayed up far longer than intended. Then BANG, my Defibrillator fired and as I hit the water it went off again. I thought my time had come. But they fished me out and I knew enough from previous heart experiences to do nothing. The hotel manager took me to the local Croatian village doctor who gave me an ECG and told me to rest and fly back at the end of the holiday. On getting back to Leicester my Cardiologist was furious with me for going water skiing and in front of my wife told me never to do such a thing again! So they are all colluding in stopping me from enjoying myself! Well, I had earlier checked with the cardiologist that I could still go skiing – it’s just that I did not mention the water. We have snow skied every year since the children were little and went again this January 2020 but on easy runs only. I have now given up black runs since I was in my late seventies as my leg arteries are not working too well. But as my battery was running out my cardiologist has forgiven me and implanted another defibrillator.\n\nI am continually surprised to be here still. Of course, I have to thank the fact that I have been extremely fortunate to keep just behind progress in medical science and to be lucky enough to become ill in the company of people willing to practice their resuscitation techniques on me. To those of you who have helped to further medical science, my heartfelt thanks. I now lead my life vicariously through the exploits of my children, Dick Straker, who projects images worldwide (Mesmer.co.uk ) and Heather who I am pleased to say has chosen to teach in an inner-city school, and of course through their children and great grand-child who are a delight.\n\nFor as long as we can recall mankind has often done its worst in hijacking most religions to its own power-hungry and selfish ends. My contemporaries and I were born into war and the blitz but after glimpses of a better place seem to be heading into very selfish ways again. Thus on the whole I am not sure as to whether we will leave the world a better place. I had hoped to contribute a little. But mankind seems to continue to fail in finding ways to govern itself selflessly. And we have provoked too wide a gap between those of us who have and the rest.\n\nSo I repeat, the only real lesson that stuck from SLC:\n\nLove Your Neighbour,\n\nDavid,\n\n(R.D.Straker, Lodge 1951-1955)\n\nMalcolm Iliff\n\nCourtenay 1963\n\n“I have come to realise later in life that the qualities shown by staff such as my Housemaster, a man of huge care, integrity and love for his charges, is far more important than anything else”\n\nI arrived as a new pupil at St Lawrence just 12 years old. The family home was Coventry so I was possibly one of the more distant, UK based boarders at school. My uncle, Reg Iliff, was a Governor here. I recall only seeing my parents during holidays. It was a different environment to the one children have today. The phone was never used: letters to and from home sufficed. Life was focussed entirely around School activities. We, in Courtenay House, benefitted from a very talented, paternal Housemaster – “SOS” as he was known – Samuel Speakman.\n\nMy time at SLC very much focussed my development of a love of music and particularly the flute thanks to our Director of Music, Dennis Cox. My other free-time passion was the School printing press with its advanced(!) Heidelberg machine that generated extra pocket money to support my meagre 40/- (£2) per term spending money. Swimming for the School allowed me briefly to hold a few records in Breast Stroke. Academic study was not my forte and 1% in my mock Spanish ‘O’ level was the nadir. The marker awarded me that, he said, for putting my name at the top of the paper. There was no entry to the real exam; it saved the examination entry fee!\n\nI managed 6 ‘O’ levels and 3 A’s, the latter in Physics, Chemistry and Maths. To the puzzlement of SOS, I aspired to be a chicken farmer – my uncle ran a chicken farm in Devon – which sounded much more fun than training for the law, as the careers advisor suggested. My brief aspirations towards Oxbridge quickly reduced to the reality of Battersea College of Advanced Technology. The course there in Humanities and Physical Sciences fortuitously transformed into a degree course as the College was elevated to the University of Surrey before I left, and I was awarded a BSc degree in Surrey’s first year. Later on I completed an MSc at Warwick.\n\nI had no idea what I wanted to do when I finished my first degree so escaped to Uganda with VSO for 12 months. In retrospect, it was a foundational experience – genuinely transformational. We volunteers were on our own, no parental oversight, learning to stand on our own two feet. I remain convinced that most children (both my girls have done so), should take a gap year, preferably abroad and before going to University.\n\nMy career has been varied. I started in banking and IT, trained as a Chartered Accountant, and subsequently ran my own Management, IT and Web Development consultancies. I was founder Trustee of Northwood Missionary Auctions, a charity that since 1969, has supported Christian Missions (over £1m so far) at home and abroad. I am happily married to Käthi, a Swiss lady whom I first appreciated from a distance across the floor of a crowded social function and surmised that she would be the woman with whom I might spend my life.\n\nSt Lawrence has been a consistent thread in all my years as a pupil, Membership Secretary of the OLs, as a Governor and, for a while, Vice Chair of Council. It means a lot to me that the School maintains its solid Christian foundation and ethos and continues to wear these characteristics on its sleeve today and in the future. St Lawrence has a vital role in developing children’s characters and establishing high standards of personal care, responsibility and behaviour. Everyone, staff and pupils, learn that they are part of a family. As critical as academic achievement is now and in the future, it is vital that the School retains its focus on non-academic aspects too. I have come to realise later in life that the qualities shown by staff such as my Housemaster, a man of huge care, integrity and love for his charges, is far more important than anything else. Lawrentians, past and present, must work to preserve these values for generations to come.\n\nRobert ‘Bob’ Couldrey\n\nSt Lawrence Collge CCF\n\nA recent trip to Scotland took us to Comrie in Perthshire. We passed a signpost indicating Cultybraggan Camp as a ‘tourist attraction’; Nissan huts originally built for German prisoners in WW2. I, too, had been confined there in 1960, not I hasten to add as a POW, but as a very young member of the St Lawrence CCF.\n\nI seem to remember that in the early 1960s new boys at SLC were given one term’s grace, and then everyone joined the CCF. I have to admit that I rather enjoyed ‘playing soldiers’ and happily put my name down for the annual camp in 1960, which rather surprisingly, would be in Scotland (I had never been north of the border). I can remember marching out of the North Gate staggering under the weight of my .303 (which was almost as big as me), as we trooped up to Ramsgate station for the train to London, and then the night train to Scotland. No smart ‘sleepers’ for us so some very sleepy young ‘soldiers’ disembarked on the following morning at Auchterarder and were greeted by station staff who seemed to be speaking in a foreign language,\n\nThen it was by road to Cultybraggan Camp where we were to discover that boys from a school in Kent were deemed by boys from more northern schools to be the lowest of the low; there was a pecking order. At the top, the smart schools from Edinburgh such as Loretto and Fettes with their immaculately turned out pipe bands, and then the rest of the Scottish schools. These were followed by establishments from the north of England such as Bridlington and Pocklington, and at the bottom by a margin were the untouchables from Ramsgate. In spite of it being a non-alcoholic establishment, the NAAFI was the scene of some very rowdy un-officer like behaviour as various insults were hurled around, and which incurred the displeasure of the authorities! That apart we learnt a few military skills and I can still remember the use of some pretty basic latrines!\n\nIn subsequent years there were camps at Okehampton in Devon, Brecon in Wales and Crowborough in Sussex; and also a return to Perthshire for arduous training at Amulree. On occasions the Royal Marines at Deal also tried to lick us into shape. Not that I was part of it, but a military band was formed, and on one parade in Ramsgate they received a warm reception for playing the theme tune from ‘Steptoe and Son’.\n\nSenior Under Officers came and went. One of them was a tall and terrifying boy from Grange (Phillips by name?), who already had a TA rank and a voice which would have been appreciated at the Guards Depot at Caterham, but which for the rest of us was a wee bit over the top! Another was John Stevens who would become the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and who now sits in the House of Lords. I rather feel that my stint as the SUO was the sandwich in between some more illustrious holders of the rank, because some years later Richard Dannatt was also the SUO, eventually becoming the Army’s CGS, and now also lurking in the Lords.\n\nI think that in my time Major Wheeler was initially the OC and he was succeeded by Rag Garden who moved from leading the RAF section. The latter at one memorable Inspection Day had too much tension on the rubber band that launched their mini glider. The aircraft went much further than expected and just avoided being modified by a collision with the chapel wall! Whilst I was at Sandhurst, Rag asked me to attend one of the Annual Inspection Days. Later after my first tour in the Far East he asked me to speak to members of the CCF about life as a junior officer. The venue was one of the science lecture rooms; not one of my favourite places as a boy at SLC! ‘Q’ Hobden, a retired soldier and a great character ran the armoury and the .22 range.\n\nMany of my contemporaries did not enjoy the CCF, in particular the cold and wet field days. I have to confess I had a rather different view on proceedings and it did not stop me serving 26 very satisfying years in the Army.\n\nAndrew Billington\n\nLodge 1966\n\nI did not excel at SLC but I was one of the first students to take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme at the school, run by a young teacher called RD Harley. I received my Gold Award in November 1966. The award scheme was a real encouragement to me as a 17 year old. My expedition was probably the best part! I cycled 200 miles: Bromley-Portsmouth-Bournemouth-Poole-Dorchester and ending in Clevedon. I spent several nights under canvas… a great time! This probably awakened my spirit of adventure as a few years later I hitch-hiked from London to Uganda in East Africa, spending a short while in an Egyptian prison as I accidently broke a curfew!\n\nWhen the Duke of Edinburgh scheme celebrated its 50th Anniversary they chose one gold recipient to represent each of the 50 years to attend a reception at Buckingham Palace and I was chosen for 1966.\n\nTo complete my link with the scheme, in about 2007, when the Duke was getting a little older, he invited individuals (normally celebrities!) to present the awards with him at St James Palace and on this occasion I was invited to do the honours. Sadly I don’t think any SLC students were there.\n\nI hope the school continues to offer this valuable programme to young people as it helped me to find my feet as young man.\n\nThe Revd. Edward John Widdows\n\nCourtenay 1958-1963\n\nLike others, my arrival at Courtenay was akin to a baptism of fire! However, I left with an appreciation of its down to earth outlook and unpretentiousness, which I hope to have held on to in subsequent years. My favourite subject was history which I enjoyed under Harold Clarke, housemaster of Grange. Most influential was Dennis Cox, director of music. As a flautist in the school orchestra and a tenor in the school choir he had a profound impact upon my love of music, and church music in particular. His dedication was an inspiration, as was his kindness and generosity. I greatly enjoyed drama under the guidance of John Binfield, who was new to the staff in my time. He taught me to be observant of human nature which I have certainly had cause to do. I enjoyed cross country running, as this had the advantage of getting more free time if completing the course early.\n\nShooting was my major sporting activity and was our House Captain in my final year. I also enjoyed the CCF, and was one of the first to be part of a new section of First Aid and Civil Defence; no doubt a nodding acknowledgement of the Cuban crisis and Cold War! Friendships were formed, in particular John Timmis who was best man at our wedding, and who for his sins remains my accountant.\n\nI was pleased to be made a member of the prestigious athenaeum which boasted its own distinctive tie, with white alphas (α). I was greatly influenced by the chaplain the Revd. H. G. James ex R.N., who steered me onto the official path towards ordination as a priest in the Church of England. I was the head chapel steward during his time, and valued his quiet and no nonsense attitude towards Christianity which was at the heart of all that SLC stood for. He organised a retreat for VIth. Formers which I attended, led by the Bishop of Dover, and then sent me on a VIth. form vocational conference at Jesus College Oxford, led by the Bishop of Norwich.\n\nI went to the London College of Divinity in Northwood for theology, although it did not represent my own stratospheric level of Anglicanism, but it did offer reduced rates at the local golf club (not Moor Park – the other one behind the True Lovers’ Knot). I ‘survived’ until retirement from ill health caused me to relinquish my final post in which one of my most privileged duties was to deputise for the Precentor at Choral Evensong in Winchester Cathedral on various occasions. A highlight of my ministry was going to Lambeth Palace to receive the Archbishop’s Certificate in Church Music from Archbishop George Carey. In all my ministry I have been ably supported by my wife, Joy cf. picture ante, who was a teacher in my first curacy. It was a blessed reward for my showing a pastoral interest in members of the staff! I am deeply indebted to her for her love and compassion, and support in all of my ministry.\n\nI remember SLC with a measured degree of affection and gratitude, and for the opportunity to respond to God’s call to serve Him to the end.\n\nRichard A Beardon\n\nLodge 1960-1965\n\nI went to St Lawrence College Junior School from September 1955-June 1960 and to St Lawrence College Senior School from September 1960-June 1965.\n\nMy parents selected St Lawrence because my father, Denis Frederick Beardon and his brother Derek Beardon were both St Lawrence pupils. My parents were a Royal Air Force family and likely to move frequently so boarding at St Lawrence was a natural choice. In addition my paternal grandparents, Mr and Mrs C C Beardon lived in Ramsgate and were nearby to provide support.\n\nI was in Lodge House while attending the Senior School, under the fantastic Housemaster Donald Drew.\n\nMy favourite subjects were English, Geology and Geography, and I most enjoyed the teaching of Mr E B Watson and his management of the Geology Club. Other teachers who made strong and favourable impressions on me included Mr Roberts, Headmaster of the Junior School, James Gillespie who introduced me to Classical Music while at the Junior School, Mr and Mrs Clifford who boarded me for the first few months in 1955 after starting at the Junior School. Colonel Verbi at the Junior School who was very motivational and introduced me to Trout fly fishing and Beagling which was absolutely brilliant fun. I still remember being “bloodied” and have the hare’s pad mounted on a shield, hanging in my home office to this day! The shield has a small plaque, Blean Beagles Boughton Church October 1956! I also clearly recall the beagle hound pack leader’s name, a bitch called “Whitey”.\n\nI always enjoyed sports and was fortunate to try most of the many on offer. My favourites were rugby, hockey, “quad hockey” and cricket. Also enjoyed were tennis, small bore rifle shooting, gym and swimming.\n\nSadly, I have not maintained contact with my school friends, many of whom I have probably forgotten. But here are some names of great friends with whom I shared many fantastic experiences: Tim Giles, Nigel Wright, Barry Webb, David Oldham, Ian Prior, Robert Eve, Bob Gray, and to many others whose names have escaped me I sincerely apologise and wish you all well.\n\nI have often been asked what did I value most from my SLC education? Well for me the answer is somewhat cliched because I have always felt that I gained a great and rounded grounding and good preparation for adult life. Learning to get on with people from different backgrounds and opinions; gaining a broad academic training which stood me in good stead at University; participation in sports of many kinds, both team and individual; developing my own leadership skills which became of the greatest importance in formulating my managerial career in big businesses.\n\nSt Lawrence helped to reinforce the values I learned at home regarding a very strong work ethic; high integrity in all personal and business relationships and work; a readiness to help other less fortunate than oneself; the importance of setting personal goals and the pursuit of excellence and winning.\n\nI was very fortunate to receive much recognition at SLC which to this day I am very proud of and feel it gave me a head start in my adult life. The recognition I can recall is as follows; School Captain; Captain of the Choir; Head of House, Lodge; Captain of First XV Rugby; Secretary of First XI Hockey; Captain of Second XI Cricket; Leadership position in the CCF; and Captain of several House Sports Teams. I received First Team Colours in Rugby and Hockey. During my final year at SLC I discovered and successfully applied for several Industrial Scholarships. I accepted an offer from Perkins Engines in Peterborough where I undertook a Commercial and Technical Business Undergraduate Apprenticeship, and took a Sandwich Honours Degree in Business Studies at Coventry University, from which I graduated in 1969. Thereafter I had a career in a succession of large multi-national companies, in several different industrial sectors, finishing my career with Cadbury Schweppes in the USA as President and Chief Operating Officer for The American Bottling Company.\n\nI am now happily retired and living in Somerset and would be happy to renew contact with friends from SLC in 1955-65\n\nPerran Newman\n\nManor 1964\n\nA Shocking Ignorance\n\nThe 60s was a wonderful decade to be young. I was 14 when it opened and married with fatherhood around the corner when it ended. So, for me, the 60’s encompassed most of the key experiences that defined me for the rest of my life.\n\n1962 was special – I was at a traditional boarding school near Ramsgate in Kent and had just moved up to the sixth form. The demeaning chores of fagging were past, I could put my hands in my pockets, shared a study with a few other boys rather than the Junior Common Room and at last had been able to leave behind those subjects that didn’t really interest me. The year opened with Cliff Richard singing “Living Doll” at the top of the pop charts – the first record I ever paid to hear on a jukebox.\n\nAt St.Lawrence College we had no access to television and there was a single newspaper for each of the two Common Rooms, so discussion about current affairs was rare. However, I do remember exactly what I was doing when the news of Kennedy’s assassination came on the radio and details about the trial of Adolf Eichmann which was in the papers remain vivid to me.\n\nOne of my privileges as a sixth former was to leave college after morning chapel on Sunday, be back for evening roll call and spend the day with an approved person. That person was my friend Mike Meredith, a day boy at the school who lived in the nearby town of Birchington.\n\nIn October it was still warm enough to cycle the 5 miles and I had made the trip most Sundays since the Michaelmas term had started. I would take a packed lunch and listen in to local radio hams on Mike’s ex-Lancaster Bomber wireless whilst his family had their lunch. We’d then ‘mess about’ on mopeds and get up to other dubious activities.\n\nOn Sunday 28th October, my cycle ride took a little longer than usual. My route took me through a part of Manston airfield. This wartime base was known for its very long runaway, to take crippled bombers returning from raids in WW2. On this Sunday, I saw a policeman in the road ahead indicating that I should not proceed but take the signed diversion. I was not prepared for the scene beyond the policeman and it remains as an indelible image. There, lined up at an angle to the road, now a taxi way to the main runway, were at least four V Bombers – massive, menacing and white.\n\nYou will find no references to this event in the history of Manston airfield. However, world history records that the Cuba Missile Crisis was the closest we have ever been to destroying our civilisation. On the 28th of October 1962, I stood one hundred yards from the tools of that potential holocaust, a young man, oblivious of their significance.\n\nPerran Newman\n\nManor 1964\n\nWilliam F. “Billy” Brown, Jr.\n\nJunior School 1965 – 1969\n\nSt. Lawrence College: Michaelmas Term 1966 – Lent Term 1967 – Summer Term 1967\n\nMy father worked for Billy Graham and was in charge of setting up his All-Britain Crusade, which was held in London in June, 1967. Our family had moved to England from the U.S.A. in 1965 and we lived in London. About a year later a colleague of my father’s recommended that I should experience the unique education that a time-honoured British boarding school could provide. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nI began attending the Junior School in the Fall of 1966 at the age of 10 over half a century ago. What follows are some thoughts and memories of my time there.\n\nMemories:\n\nBeing a novelty as the only American at the school.\n\nBeing homesick.\n\nThe kindness of Headmaster and Mrs. Keith Roberts.\n\nRegularly walking Mr Roberts’ dog.\n\nForbidden “Tuck” (sweets and a bottle of Lucozade) secretly stashed in my locker.\n\nPlaying the double base in a concert on a Thursday when I had my first lesson on the preceding Tuesday.\n\nSticking a half-eaten toffee on the stairway wall while headed through the tunnel to an assembly. Mr. Roberts found the half-eaten sweet and addressed the crowd, saying some “disgusting little boy” had put the toffee on the wall and he wanted the culprit to turn himself in. I did, and subsequently received “the stick” (one stroke) for the first and only time from Mr. Roberts. This was followed by a cup of tea and a biscuit with him! My only other corporal punishment was receiving three strokes of my rubber-soled slipper from Mr. Brenner for horseplay after lights out. I was not the only one involved and I believe I took those for the team. Fonder memories include exeat Sunday outings with my parents including visiting numerous antique shops and starting a lifelong passion for collecting military medals. My father saying he knew I was going to grow up to be a leader because when he and my mother fetched me for the final time, a group of my friends carried all of my luggage out to the car.\n\nTeachers & Staff: I remember Mr. Gould (who always wrote with an aqua-inked fountain pen), Mr. Gillespie, Mr. Brenner, Mr. Rymer, Miss Coggan, and a kindly cook who name I cannot remember. If I asked she would make me fried bread for breakfast when everyone else was having toast.\n\nFriends I remember: Jack Cameron-Wallace, Nickey Page, Simon Burke, Richard Ash and the Loveless brothers.\n\nLetters Home:\n\nAfter my parents both died recently, I went through their effects and found some letters that my mother had saved and that I written to them during my St. Lawrence Junior School days. These provide some humorous insight into the thought process of a 10-year old boarder. A few extracts:\n\n13 Aug 1966 – “Please send me a pen, a penknife and £1…I am running short of money with all the expenses around (here).”\n\n2 Oct 1966 – “Joined Electric Train Club. History “Modl” [sic] Club had no room, but trying to join. Haven’t yet got the stick because it requires five forfeits and I have none.”\n\n16 Oct 1966 – “Football getting better, French not very well. Came in 12th in Quarterly Orders. Participating in Stamp Club and bought a “Penny Victoria.” Had a thunderstorm at the school “with lightening and all.”\n\n23 Oct 1966 – “Am brushing my teeth every day. Busy at Stamp Club. We had 3/- worth of stamps free! Mister Gillespie, the music teacher, had a birthday. When we sang Happy Birthday he said, ‘You’ve all got the tune wrong!’ Had a lecture from an RAF pilot about “the latest stof” and survival kits.\n\n6 Nov 1966 – “In sick bay for several days with a temperature. Cared for by Sister Celia Schmidt (and seen daily by Dr. Jepps).”\n\n20 Nov 1966 – “Looking forward to Christmas. A boy at school had a “Batmobile” by Corgi. It had a chain-cutter and firing rockets. Here is what I’d like for Christmas: a batmobile, a radio and a load more things.” (I got the Batmobile).\n\n27 Nov 1966 – “I came in eighth in Quarterly Orders again and am playing billiards quite a lot. It is very wet here and the swimming pool has been closed. The football pitches are as muddy as ever!!!”\n\nSummer Term – 1967\n\n26 Feb 1967 – Asked for a 5/- postal order for Stamp Club. “Have just about filled my stamp album and for Easter would like a First Day Cover album. French getting better. “\n\n12 Mar 1967 – “Thank you for exeat last Sunday. Can’t wait for Quarterly Orders (five days away). Hope I get into the top five.” (My parents had bribed me by saying we would get a Yorkshire terrier if I made it into the top five.) Good time in Science class making plaster of Paris “moulds.” (Mine was of my cupped hand.)\n\n19 Mar 1967 – “In chapel the organ has gone fut and there will be a piano instead.” “I have started a library and have 44 books. We played rugger against Cameron house yesterday and got thrashed. The films were “September Spring” (OK), “Secrets of the Plant World” (good) and “A Ship Comes to Antwerp” (dull). The extra films were “Rhino” and “The Ostrich Egg and I.”\n\n30 Apr 1967 – “Still in Dorm R, Phew! Mr. Brenner has left and Mr. Rymer (who we called “Rhino”) took his place. No Stamp Club unless it rains. Swimming pool was painted and is very warm. Having cricket soon.”\n\n7 May 1967 – “I think I would like a dog for my birthday and also a wildlife game and a Penny Black. Rain has been coming down in bucket loads.”\n\nUndated – circa early July 1967 – “I came in 1st in Quarterly Orders! Will be in London on the 13th for the Royal Tournament. Had strawberries on Friday. Lovely!” (We did get the Yorkshire terrier – “Muffin” – which later travelled to America with us.)\n\n______________________________\n\nMy Life after St. Lawrence:\n\nMy father’s next assignment was in New York so we left England and lived in Eastchester and Bronxville, suburbs of New York City, for a year or so.\n\nAfter that Dr. Graham selected my father to be the president of his motion picture ministry – World Wide Pictures – in Burbank, California. After a life of constant travel (I had 22 different homes by the time I was 14), we finally settled down in Sherman Oaks in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. At the age of 16 I took a high school class in ‘Police Role in Government’ taught by a Los Angeles Police officer. That and the television show ‘Adam 12’ sealed the deal and I decided that law enforcement was to be my career goal.\n\nAfter high school I was still too young to be a police officer so I became an emergency medical technician and later a paramedic. Shortly after I turned 21, I began my law enforcement career with the Pacifica Police Department in the San Francisco Bay area. I worked there for 2 ½ years, met my future wife, Donna, married, and shortly afterwards transferred to the Inglewood Police Department in Los Angeles County.\n\nOur family grew to five with the addition of two boys and a girl. I recognized the need for more formal education and attended university at nights and on weekends, obtaining a B.A. in Management from the University of Redlands and a Masters in Public Administration at the University of Southern California.\n\nAfter 12 ½ years as a police officer, supervisor, manager and command officer for Inglewood P.D., I applied for and was selected as the Chief of Police for the City of Moscow, Idaho. This meant a change from an inner-city, high crime community to leading a law enforcement organization for a rural college town where we were also responsible for policing the University of Idaho. Whereas murders, robberies and other major crimes were commonplace in Inglewood, on my first day on the job in Moscow we had a report of a big bull moose running through a residential neighborhood.\n\nAlthough we loved Idaho, we missed family in California, and 3 years later we returned there after I applied for and was selected as the Chief of Police for the City of Lompoc, California, a community in northern Santa Barbara County.\n\nAfter 11 years of service, I ran for and was elected as Sheriff – Coroner of Santa Barbara County in 2006. I was re-elected in 2010 and 2014, and I will be seeking my fourth term in June of this year.\n\nMy experiences as Sheriff of Santa Barbara County have been the most rewarding of my professional life. In addition to providing front-line law enforcement to the unincorporated areas of the county and four contract cities, the Sheriff’s Office runs the County Jail and Coroner’s Bureau, provides security in the courts, and search & rescue services for a county of 440,000 people. We also provide specialized law enforcement services such as an Air Support Unit, a Special Enforcement (S.W.A.T.) Team, a Dive Unit, a Bomb Squad, Hostage Negotiations Team, and K-9 Units.\n\nAs Sheriff I continue to have a myriad of extraordinary opportunities, such as overseeing the construction of a new jail, managing several high-profile murder and mass murder investigations, and leading our agency through the financial devastation of the Great Recession and no fewer than a dozen major wildfires – including the recent Thomas Fire. I am currently the president of the California State Sheriffs’ Association, and have previously served as president of the California Police Chiefs’ Association. I am humbled to be the only person ever elected by peers to both positions. I am also pleased to ride with our Mounted Enforcement Unit which culminated in January of 2017 with the rare privilege of participating in the world famous Rose Parade in Pasadena. I am proud to lead a very fine group of men and women who serve with much professionalism, empathy for others, dedication and honor.\n\nThis past November while on vacation in England, my wife and I made an impromptu visit to St. Lawrence. We were graciously received and given a wonderful tour of the Junior School and College. Though much has changed, the visit brought back fond memories from 50 years ago of an experience in my life that, at a remarkably young age, prepared me in so many ways for the challenges that were ahead. I came away from that visit pleased to know that St. Lawrence College and its Junior School continues its legacy of excellence in preparing generation after generation of students to meet the challenges that they will face in the future.\n\nSheriff Bill Brown\n\nSanta Barbara County, California\n\nGordon Edington\n\n1957-1964\n\nIn January 1947, 18 months old, I departed from Southampton Docks into the Solent, on the snow covered decks of the Capetown Castle – its first civilian voyage after troop ship service – setting out for a new life in Africa. Four weeks later we disembarked at Kilindini Harbour, Mombasa, took the night train to Nairobi and then drove up country. My 9 years in Kenya as the son of a dam building civil engineer had started. Life was isolated, simple and happy but that changed with the Mau Mau attacks on farming friends of my parents when we lived in the Aberdare Mountains. For safety I was sent to board at St Mary’s School in Nairobi but the fear of a potential terrorist attack was always present. In 1953 Poliomyelitis came to Kenya and I remember being very scared that I would become infected as a few boys at the school had been. I don’t remember any precautions being taken to stop the spread but perhaps there were. How times have changed.\n\nOur annual 2 week holiday was in Malindi. I remember the dark coloured beach, palm trees, washed up coconut shells, the warm sea, the excitement of body boarding for the first time and walking along the beach at night so see all the crabs with their 360 degree vision and luminous eyes which sparkled but would suddenly disappear as we got close as the crabs dived down holes in the sand. We drove through the game parks and enjoyed views of uninterrupted wildlife that are now gone. Taking a flying boat back to England was a treat – a Short Solent four-engined monster that splashed down at regular intervals at places like on the Nile at Khartoum, then Alexandria, and Catania.\n\nAfter Kenya my father took on engineering projects in Persia (Iran), Nyasaland (Malawi) and Nigeria and we now had a UK home in Mayfield, Sussex but I had the good fortune to visit these far-away places on summer holidays. Now in England, at the age of 10, I was way behind educationally so Mr Forbes, a private tutor, visited every day to try and drum the basics into me. He did his best, and so did I, but the results were shaky. What to do now? After much searching my parents discovered that St Lawrence College would take an 11 year old ‘in-betweener’ like me – not into the Junior School; into the Senior School, but sleeping outside the school grounds at Sutton House, where a few others in a similar position also stayed overnight.\n\nWhat a change from sunny Colonial Kenya – I found the dormitories cold, the lessons confusing, I was different, didn’t seem able to make friends and missed being at home. Early school reports were not encouraging – 1957, English: ‘A messy worker who is far too inclined to give up without a struggle.’ Mathematics – ‘He is still very weak and has been rather stubbornly inattentive recently.’ History – ‘Only a very moderate start. His work is rather slow and untidy.’ And from the Headmaster: ‘It makes one doubt his capacity for a Public School education.’ But my unhappy start at St Lawrence was to change. After 2 years, new boys of my own age joined the school and at last I had peers, made friends, and as a result, I became much happier.\n\nI had one important constant in my life. I was lucky to have J.J. Sandison as the Housemaster of Manor House. He was firm, fair, had a sense of humour, always seemed to see the best in me and never appeared to doubt that there was potential to be extracted. Without JJS who knows how it might have turned out. I owe him a lot and regret that in later years I never made an opportunity to tell him of my gratitude.\n\nI enjoyed, hockey, rugby, and swimming and particularly enjoyed tennis lessons with the Mrs Binfield – a happy half hour each week in her company during the Summer Term. She gave me a love for tennis which I still enjoy today. Rugby had its challenges – the huge boy from the opposing team bearing down on me, a scrawny full back and the improbable last line in a failing defence. I was concussed on one occasion and during the holidays my parents thought I should see a Harley Street specialist. His name was, appropriately, Sir Russell Brain, who was principal author of the standard work of neurology, Brain’s Diseases of the Nervous System, and in 1962 was elevated to Baron Brain – nothing could be further from the truth I am sure. He could not identify any obvious neurological damage as a result of my rugby concussion. Perhaps he didn’t look hard enough!\n\nIt was a time when canings were a regular feature but I never felt my punishment was undeserved. There were masters who I particularly respected; Messrs Martin-Harvey, Drew and Binfield. There were kindnesses – Mr EB Watson taking his Geology Club members to hunt for fossils in his open topped Lagonda followed by a slap up Sunday lunch. The pride felt in the shooting team, of which I was not a part, winning the Ashburton Shield. I joined the Combined Cadet Force and rose to the heady heights of Lance Bombardier where the only real task was applying spit and polish to our 25-pounder, a British field gun of WW11 vintage.\n\nI remember the fun and comradery of playing in school teams, and sometimes winning. Playing hockey on the beach when the games fields were snow covered. Shooting at Bisley with .303 rifles – noisy without ear defenders. Not getting caught smoking. And getting caught smoking at an away match with the inevitable and understood consequences of 6 of the best from JJS. I remember friends like Richard Clare, Oliver Hadley, Laurence Lea, Richard Pierrepont and Paul Priday. In the 6th form we had a Common Room occupied by four of us and we rushed there at mid-morning break time to put slices of white bread against the gas fire to toast. I then applied peanut butter with Marmite to 4 slices and sat down and listened to Elvis Presley, day after day. Sometimes Buddy Holly and the Beach Boys got a look in, as did Acker Bilk, a clarinettist, and his jazz band. Spare time at weekends also allowed cycle rides into town to have a meal at ‘Greasy Joe’s’ – a culinary highlight for sure. Also going to a new invention – the ‘coffee bar’. On the academic front a terrible ‘O Level’ maths exam result, followed by an excellent one only a few months later – a term of private tuition from Mr Skinner lifting the fog. Help with my dyslexia would have been equally helpful but of course at that time there was no one looking out for it. And I can thank St Lawrence for my first kiss, well sort of, on a Duke of Edinburgh’s gold medal expedition in Scotland – near Dunkeld if I remember rightly – the young lady worked in the village post office.\n\nI respected the Christian ethos of the school and do even more so now. However going to Chapel then was in the main, a bore, but keeping out of sight, we kept our sanity by weaving interlinking strips of coloured plastic. I do remember there was one hymn I loved singing; William Whiting’s, For Those in Peril on the Sea, particularly on a stormy winter evening during Evensong when I imagined small boats being knocked about on a high sea in the English Channel just off Ramsgate Harbour.\n\n‘Eternal Father strong to save\n\nWhose arm has bound the restless wave\n\nWho bids the mighty ocean deep\n\nIt’s own appointed limits keep\n\nO hear us when we cry to Thee\n\nFor those in Peril on the sea.’\n\nAll these years later, like many people of my age, I can remember exactly where I was standing in the evening of 22nd November 1963 – in a corridor outside my study – when we heard over the radio that President Kennedy had been assassinated. Even we – not very well informed schoolboys with no access to social media – found it truly shocking.\n\nAcademic results improved to dizzying heights – one A level in Geography. The hallowed halls of Oxford and Cambridge were not for me, nor me for them. I liked the thought of a job in property – not locked in an office, but being out and about, seeing buildings, meeting people, doing deals, and hopefully making some much needed money. Knight Frank offered me an office boy role in their commercial department dealing with offices in the West End of London so 2 weeks after the end of term I took it. Salary increases from the initial £5 a week were tough to negotiate and so after 4 years I left for a commission based job but with appreciation for the ethos installed in me and of the benefits of learning inti"
