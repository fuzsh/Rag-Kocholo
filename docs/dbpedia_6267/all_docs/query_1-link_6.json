        "text": "The unseeded 17-year-old – who is part of the Loughborough University National Tennis Academy (LUNTA) – dominated in Sunday’s final to brush aside opponent Yaroslav Demin 6-4 6-4.\n\nSearle, who didn’t drop a set during the whole tournament, looked assured throughout and soon powered his way to an impressive victory in front of a raucous crowd on Court One.\n\nThe teenager, coached by Morgan Phillips, needed just one break of serve in the opening set to take control. The Wolverhampton native continued to dominate in the following set, showcasing perfect ball-striking skills as he secured a maiden Grand Slam title.\n\nBacked by unwavering support from a noisy cluster of fans, Searle claimed victory following a long forehand by Demin. The youngster outstretched his arms in celebration towards the overjoyed ‘barmy army’ that included a large contingent from Loughborough.\n\n“It’s a pretty special feeling, I’m going to try and enjoy it,” he said.\n\n“I’d like to thank my coaching team at Loughborough University, and my mum and brother, and all the barmy army.”\n\nImage caption: Henry celebrates in a previous round. Image supplied by Getty Images for LTA.\n\nSearle is only the 12th British boy to win a boys’ Grand Slam title and the first to win a junior Wimbledon title since Laura Robson in 2008.\n\nThe last boy to win the trophy was Stanley Matthews – son and namesake of the former England football great – in 1962.\n\nSearle’s victory is recognised as a significant moment for British tennis, and it’s now hoped he can emulate the four icons of the game who won the boys' singles title as well as the men’s title – Roger Federer, Bjorn Borg, Pat Cash and Stefan Edberg.\n\nFor more information on the LUNTA, visit its dedicated website here: https://www.lboro.ac.uk/sport/sports/tennis/national-tennis-academy/\n\nNotes for editors\n\nPress release reference number: 23/109\n\nLoughborough is one of the country’s leading universities, with an international reputation for research that matters, excellence in teaching, strong links with industry, and unrivalled achievement in sport and its underpinning academic disciplines.\n\nIt has been awarded five stars in the independent QS Stars university rating scheme, named the best university in the world for sports-related subjects in the 2023 QS World University Rankings – the seventh year running – and University of the Year for Sport by The Times and Sunday Times University Guide 2022.\n\nLoughborough is ranked 7th in The UK Complete University Guide 2023, 10th in the Guardian University League Table 2023 and 11th in the Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2023.\n\nLoughborough is consistently ranked in the top twenty of UK universities in the Times Higher Education’s ‘table of tables’, and in the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2021 over 90% of its research was rated as ‘world-leading’ or ‘internationally-excellent’.
