        "text": "Searle – a 17-year-old from Wolverhampton - has become the first British boy since Stanley Matthews in 1962 to lift the Boys’ singles trophy in SW19 and even more impressively, did so without dropping a single set.\n\n“It’s amazing to play on Court 1 in front of such a special crowd” Searle said in his on-court interview. “I managed to get the job done – it feels pretty good.\n\n“It’s a special feeling and it’s not going to come too often so I’m going to try and enjoy it.\n\n“I’d like to say thanks to my coaching team at Loughborough University, my mum, my brother and all of the Barmy Army here”.\n\nBy reaching the final, Searle joined the likes of Liam Broady and Jack Draper as the third Brit in 11 years to reach the final two of the tournament. Despite Broady and Draper finishing runners-up, they have both gone on to enjoy impressive careers so far at the top of the game.\n\nWhen asked whether he’s ready for what is coming his way following the victory, Searle said, “I’ll definitely try and prepare myself for it, but I’ll keep working hard and we can see what happens”.\n\nRoad to the title\n\nStepping onto the biggest stage of his young career so far, the big-serving lefty continued to showcase his strength behind his serve from the off.\n\nDespite both players giving away few points at the start of the contest, Searle withstood the pressure at 3-4 as he staved off three break points before clinching the game. That proved to be the turning point in the opening set, with the momentum shifting in favour of the Loughborough National Academy scholar who raced to a 40-0 lead on his opponent’s serve before securing the break with a firing backhand which Demin plummeted into the net.\n\nApproaching the baseline to serve for the set, the Brit – who landed an impressive 75% of first serves in the opener – launched a 132mph serve out wide before smashing an inside out forehand into the corner of court to put himself just one set away from the title.\n\nThe world No.27 continued to move through the gears – getting off to the perfect start by securing a break to love on Demin’s opening service game in the second to give himself an early advantage.\n\nCheered on by a home crowd of spectators and an army of his friends and family, the home favourite from Wolverhampton showed no signs of nerves as he eased through his service games and given the opportunity to serve it out for the Championship.\n\nGifted with two Championship points, he served it out in true Searle-style with a thundering serve that Demin returned long to wrap up the title in one hour and 25 minutes and etch his name in the British tennis history books."
