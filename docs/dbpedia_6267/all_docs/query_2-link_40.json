        "text": "Carlos Alcaraz defeated Novak Djokovic to win the Wimbledon men’s final, denying the Serbian a fifth consecutive title, in a five-set epic and one of the greatest matches ever played at the All England Club.\n\nAlcaraz fought from a set down in an instant classic to end Djokovic’s winning run in SW19, with the match played across almost five hours of breathtaking drama. Before the final, Djokovic had won 34 consecutive matches at Wimbledon and had not lost on Centre Court since 2013, but Alcaraz overturned history to win his second grand slam title. Djokovic had also won his previous 104 grand slam matches after winning the opening set.\n\nIn doing so, the 20-year-old Spaniard brings one of the most dominant eras of tennis history to an end. Alcaraz is the first player outside of the sport’s ‘big four’ of Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon men’s singles title since 2002. Djokovic has been bidding to join Federer by equalling his men’s record of eight singles titles, but was denied by an inspired Alcaraz.\n\n“It’s a dream come true for me,” an emotional Alcaraz said after receiving the trophy from the Princess of Wales. “Making history in this beautiful tournament, playing a final against a legend of our sport – for me it’s incredible. It’s amazing, for a boy like me, 20 years old, to reach this kind of situation.”\n\nFollow live updates and results from day 14 of Wimbledon, below.\n\nWimbledon 2023 Latest updates - Men’s singles final\n\nCarlos Alcaraz captures the impossible and now Wimbledon will never be the same again\n\nDjokovic misses out on eighth Wimbledon title as Alcaraz triumphs for first time at SW19\n\nAlfie Hewett loses wheelchair singles final after triumphing in doubles alongside Gordon Reid\n\nHenry Searle becomes the first British winner in boys’ singles for 61 years\n\nMarketa Vondrousova beats Ons Jabeur in the Wimbledon 2023 women’s singles final\n\nGB’s Neal Skupski claimed his Wimbledon men’s doubles title with Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof\n\nCarlos Alcaraz captures the impossible and now Wimbledon will never be the same again\n\n19:20 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nWimbledon has a new champion, and a new hero.

Obviously him coming from clay, having the kind of style that he has.\n\n“I think Queen’s helped him a lot. He was close to lose that first match, opening match, in Queen’s. Then he started to gain momentum, more and more wins against really good players.\n\n“I must say the slices, the kind of chipping returns, the net play, it’s very impressive.

He responds to it well with a fizzing serve down the T line that brings him his first point.\n\nAlcaraz holds his nerve to win back-to-back points and sneaks in front. He then fires a wonder serve down the middle and holds serve.\n\nWimbledon LIVE: Carlos Alcaraz vs Novak Djokovic\n\n17:13 , Mike Jones\n\n*Carlos Alcaraz 1-6 7-6 6-1 0-0 Novak Djokovic\n\nNovak Djokovic has left the court for a bathroom break in between sets.

Hopefully I will be more motivated and be back next year.”\n\nWimbledon LIVE: Tokito Oda defeats Britain’s Alfie Hewett in straight sets\n\n12:46 , Mike Jones\n\nAged 17 years and 69 days, Tokito Oda is the youngest player to win any Wimbledon singles title (excluding juniors) since 1997. Oda is also the youngest man in history to win a Wimbledon singles title in any discipline.\n\nGood morning!\n\n08:00 , Jamie Braidwood\n\nIt’s the big one: Novak Djokovic faces Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon men’s singles final this afternoon, as the two best players go head to head for the title on Centre Court.\n\nDjokovic is attempting to win his fifth consecutive Wimbledon crowd, which would move the Serbian level with Roger Federer on a men’s record eight singles titles. Alcaraz is playing in his first Wimbledon final and the 20-year-old Spaniard has the challenge of ending Djokovic’s dominant run at SW19, where he has won 34 matches in a row and has not lost on Centre Court since 2013.\n\nAlcaraz, the world No 1, will feel as if he has nothing to lose after reaching the Wimbledon final on what is just his fourth tournament on grass. Alcaraz will try to bring his creative shot-making and powerful forehand to the showpiece occasion but Djokovic has a clear advantage when it comes to experience in grand slam finals. Djokovic can also equal Margaret Court’s overall record with a 24th grand slam title, having claimed the men’s record at last month’s French Open.\n\nThe men’s final comes after Marketa Vondrousova triumphed over a heartbroken Ons Jabeur in straight sets to win the Wimbledon women’s title on Saturday, while Great Britain’s Neal Skupski claimed his first grand slam men’s doubles title with a memorable final victory with Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof."
