It was a tournament not without controversy, as we reflect and react on the third Grand Slam of the year.\n\nDjokovic was denied his fifth consecutive SW19 title by the 20-year-old Spaniard in a five-setter that was of the highest quality, with the Centre Court crowd on their feet to welcome a new champion, Alcaraz's second Major already of his short career after winning last year's US Open.\n\nVondrousova was another first-time Wimbledon champion, having upset favourite Jabeur on Saturday in straight sets to become the first unseeded SW19 winner in the Open era - after brutally being dropped by Nike and forced to wear an unbranded kit.\n\nBritain did have a champion in Henry Searle, as the 17-year-old broke the nation's 62-year duck to lift the boys' singles title on Sunday - becoming Britain's first junior champion since Laura Robson in 2008 while the last boy to lift the trophy was Sir Stanley Matthews' son of the same name in 1962.\n\nStay up to date with all the latest with Express Sport.\n\nJUST IN Carlos Alcaraz's Wimbledon membership explained and Roger Federer mistake [LATEST]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Carlos\n\nAs Wimbledon celebrates a new champion, on what was his first ever final, Carlos Alcaraz is obviously the entire talk of SW19.\n\nThe dust will not settle for some time, as Sunday's final enters the history books as one of the most iconic showdowns in recent memory.\n\nBut it all has to start somewhere and, back in 2019, a rather unknown young Carlitos had the pleasure of sharing the court and hitting a few rallies with the great man himself.\n\nFans have taken to Twitter in the aftermath of his victory over Djokovic to share their accounts of the first time Alcaraz met Roger Federer.\n\n1 year ago20:35 Danny Gallagher\n\nKyrgios drops 'freak remark'\n\nIt's very much like Nick Kyrgios to say things as he sees them.\n\nSo, of course, it was business as usual in the aftermath of Carlos Alcaraz's incredible, surging comeback victory over Djokovic to win the men's title.\n\nKyrgios immediately labelled Alcaraz a 'freak', meant in the most complimentary of ways... and even admitted it was the first time he had watched a full match of tennis in quite a considerable while.\n\nHe then made a specific point of thanking both players, showing a much softer and endearing side to his character.\n\nFULL STORY.\n\n1 year ago19:18 Danny Gallagher\n\nReturn of the GOAT?\n\nSerena Williams has admitted a few times that she feels she still has much to give to tennis.\n\nOne of, if not the greatest female tennis player of all time, fans never get tired of clamouring for Serena to return.\n\nNow however, it seems like she actually might.\n\nTaking to Twitter, she opted to tell the world about a chance encounter in a book store, and how it seriously got her thinking.\n\nFULL STORY.\n\n1 year ago18:04 Danny Gallagher\n\nThe imitation game\n\nOne thing everybody can agree on is that the game plan of young Carlos Alcaraz at the All England Club was poetry in motion.\n\nThe Spaniard was a joy to behold, playing fizzing tennis from the off and keeping up a relentless pace throughout the tournament.\n\nEven when he started very slowly indeed against Novak Djokovic in the final, the way he rapidly played himself back into contention was remarkable.\n\nEverything about his approach was, however, very much copied. That is according to the youngster's coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, who has spoken out rather candidly about the new champion.\n\nFULL STORY.\n\n1 year ago17:00 Danny Gallagher\n\nDjokovic slapped with fine\n\nJust when Novak Djokovic perhaps though he couldn't feel any worse after losing the Wimbledon final, he's been hit with a meaty fine.\n\nThe defending champion produced a mid-match tantrum as the momentum started to sway over to Carlos Alcaraz on centre court, and he's not been allowed to get away from it.\n\nDjokovic completely smashed his racket in anger, hitting the Wimbledon net on his way back to his seat.\n\nFans gasped in the stands, and the umpire and line judges looked far from impressed.\n\nNow, the All England Club has promptly issued a fine in the multiple thousands.\n\nFULL STORY.\n\n1 year ago16:28 Danny Gallagher\n\nEubanks is flying\n\nWhat a few weeks it has been for this fine gentleman.\n\nThe surprise package of Wimbledon, Chris Eubanks rapidly made his way into everyone's affections with his beautiful style of play and all-round personable charm.\n\nNow, the world rankings are reflecting his endeavours splendidly.\n\nHe's climbed to a career-high 31st in Monday's updated world rankings, and he's above some huge names!\n\nFULL STORY.\n\n1 year ago15:15 Jack McEachen\n\nAlcaraz drops trophy\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has been appearing on TV stations across the world following his triumph over Novak Djokovic yesterday.\n\nHe has been parading the trophy around as is his right following a thrilling five-set victory, but not all went to plan when he dropped the gold prize.\n\nHe recovered well, however, as just the top of the lid including the golden pineapple temporarily came off.\n\nYou can read the full story HERE.\n\n1 year ago14:37 Jack McEachen\n\nTeen Brit champion to be fastracked\n\nWimbledon junior boys' champion Henry Searle will be \"fast-tracked\" into senior tournaments according to his coach Morgan Phillips.\n\nThe 17-year-old became the first British winner of the event in 62 years and has been tipped for a bright future, though he insisted he has to complete his A-Levels first.\n\n\"If you get top-10 then you get fast-tracked into some Challenger events - that's a big incentive for us,\" Phillips told the BBC. \"Junior tennis is a massive platform going into the men's game.\n\nThat's what I've worked in for a good amount of years now - the transition from junior to men's and making them understand the big journey that's ahead.\n\n\"So there will be definitely an element of him going into the lower tier of professional tennis.\"\n\n1 year ago14:05 Jack McEachen\n\nAlcaraz the day after\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has posted a heartwarming picture on social media the day after winning Wimbledon.\n\nHe has highlighted where he came from in a similar scene to the immediate reaction after defeating Novak Djokovic yesterday, going straight to his box to thank his team for their hard work.\n\nThough the air that the new Wimbledon champion was getting as a child is seriously impressive...\n\n1 year ago13:33 Jack McEachen\n\nBecker disagrees with Djokovic\n\nBoris Becker has challenged Novak Djokovic's claim that 2023 Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz is a \"complete\" player.\n\nThe 20-year-old's abilities were clear for all to see on Sunday as he got the better of the defending champion, prompting Djokovic to be extremely complimentary of the new title holder.\n\n\"I haven't played a player like him ever, to be honest,\" he said. \"Roger and Rafa obviously have their own strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is a very complete player. Amazing adapting capabilities that I think are a key for longevity and for a successful career on all surfaces.\"\n\nBecker holds the opposite view, however, which you can read in full HERE.\n\n1 year ago13:01 Jack McEachen\n\nUFC star wins huge Alcaraz bet\n\nUFC star Ilia Topuria made over £180,000 betting on his fellow Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon.\n\nThe 20-year-old defeated Novak Djokovic in a stunning five-setter to mark jubilant scenes back in Spain, but few compatriots will have been more delighted than Topuria.\n\nEarlier this month, he bet $50,000 on Alcaraz to win the tournament - returning $237,500 (£181,415).\n\n“My favorite tennis tournament Wimbledon begins,” Topuria said on Instagram when placing the bet, “And I've made my biggest bet to date.

Particularly in New York with the seven weeks of proton.\n\n\"So I was diagnosed early December and I finally got the all-clear three weeks ago. So it really has been seven months of hell, emotionally and physically.\n\n\"I lost about 25lbs so I'm very slender now. It's been very difficult but I'm cancer free now knock on wood. And Julia - it scared her too. it was scary.\n\n\"The actual treatment was horrific. You know chemotherapy, radiation, it really beat me up. Physically it was brutal and it's still hanging over your shoulder. No matter what you can't get away from it. We were both really scared.\"\n\n1 year ago11:52 Jack McEachen\n\nAlcaraz's social media boom\n\nCarlos Alcaraz has seen his social media explode after winning his first Wimbledon title on Sunday.\n\nHis five-set victory over Novak Djokovic saw the Spaniard gain over 530,000 Instagram followers in a single day.\n\nAlcaraz's new fans will have seen him claim that winning Wimbledon ensured that \"everything is happening too fast\" on social media but he took the time to thank those that supported him on his journey.\n\n\"A lifelong dream!\" Alcaraz wrote on Instagram. \"You always have to believe!
