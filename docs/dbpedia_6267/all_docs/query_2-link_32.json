        "text": "Andy Murray will not be the only Briton playing a big semi-final on Friday after Kyle Edmund fought back to reach the last four of the boys' event. The 18-year-old, who has been singled out by the Scot as the most promising youngster in the country with a dedication to match his ambition, produced a Murray-like recovery as he beat the 15-year-old American Stefan Kozlov 4-6, 6-1, 6-3.\n\nEdmund, who is bidding for his first junior grand slam title, was also a break down in the second set before hitting back to deny Kozlov, who had ousted the No3 seed in the previous round and is considered one of the most promising young players in the United States.\n\nIt is 51 years since a Briton won the boys' singles here – Stanley Matthews Jr was the last – and Edmund admitted that it would be the perfect way to end his junior career. \"It would be nice,\" he said. \"It's not the be-all and end-all but it would be nice. It's nice to play your final junior tournament in England and especially here.\"\n\nEdmund has been focusing on his senior career this year and earned his first ATP Tour win in Eastbourne last month. Awarded a wild card into the main draw, he acquitted himself decently against Jerzy Janowicz, who will take on Murray in the men's semi-finals. At No385 in the ATP rankings he is not far off where Murray was at the same age and he showed plenty of resolve to get past Kozlov.\n\nTrailing by a set and 1-0, with a break, the No5 seed looked in trouble but, just when he needed it, he found his best form. Six successive games gave him the second set but the third set was a real dogfight, with a break apiece as they got to 3–3. But Kozlov, the youngest player left in the draw, began to cramp at the worst possible time and Edmund took advantage. After breaking for 4-3, he held serve comfortably and then broke the struggling American once more in the next game to clinch victory.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be a tough match and I think maybe I gave him a bit too much respect in the beginning,\" Edmund said. \"But you can see he's going to be one of the ones to look out for in future. He was cramping at the end – that's why I do all the physical work to be good in these situations.\"\n\nWhat Murray likes about Edmund is the teenager's determination to make the best of his ability and unflappability on or off the court. \"I've hit with Kyle quite a few times,\" Murray said. \"He's a hard worker. He wants to be a professional tennis player. He puts in the effort on the court and in the gym. That's one of the most important things. So if he keeps doing those things right, he'll give himself the best chance of becoming a very good professional tennis player.\"\n\nEdmund will play the No2 seed, Gianluigi Quinzi of Italy, a 17-year-old left-hander also making good strides in the men's game. \"We've played each other three times and know each other's game well,\" Edmund said. \"He's a very good player and I'm going to have to be on it – just play my game and see how it goes.\""
