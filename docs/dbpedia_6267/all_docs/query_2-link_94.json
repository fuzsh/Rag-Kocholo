        "text": "Phil Mickelson played in the Masters a dozen times before he won it. Has anyone ever won after more attempts? And has anyone ever won their first Masters? asked Lawrence Freedman\n\nThree people have taken longer than Phil Mickelson to record their first Masters victory: Ben Crenshaw won at his 13th attempt in 1984, Billy Casper won his 14th in 1970, and Mark O'Meara won his 15th Masters, in 1998. Only three people have won on their first visit to Augusta. The first, of course, was in the inaugural tournament of 1934, which was won by the American Horton Smith. Gene Sarazen won the second one, in 1935, which was the first time he had played there. He'd already triumphed in the other three majors, so became the first golfer to win all four. The only first-time winner since then was Fuzzy Zoeller, who took the green jacket in 1979, after a playoff with Ed Sneed and Tom Watson.\n\nWhich footballer was known as \"The White Pele\"? asked Tom Franklin via Facebook\n\nI think there has been more than one - the Brazilian Zico was also lumbered with this tag for a while - but it usually seems to apply to Tostao, the centre forward (well, he wore the No. 9, at least!) in arguably the greatest football team of all time, the Brazilian side that won legions of admirers on the way to lifting the 1970 World Cup in great style. I was surprised to discover that Tostao was only 23 at the time of that triumph: he was forced to retire not long afterwards as he suffered from eye problems ever since he was hit in the face by a ball in 1969. He became a doctor. Tostao, whose real name is Eduardo Gonçalves de Andrade, scored 32 goals in just 54 international matches (some sources say 30 in 53), and remains a legend at Cruzeiro, the Brazilian club he joined at 16. Perhaps the biggest compliment ever paid to him was that many people doubted whether he and Pele could play together in the same side, as they were so similar in style. The 1970 World Cup proved that they could.\n\nWith the Grand National coming up, has there ever been one in which all the horses fell? asked Andy McDermott\n\nNot quite: the smallest amount of finishers in the Grand National is two, which happened in 1928. It was a precursor to the famous race in 1967 when there was a pile-up at one fence and an unfancied horse (Foinavon) romped home at 100-1. In 1928 the problems were caused by a horse called Easter Hero, who rather belied his name by causing a mass pile-up at the Canal Turn. Only seven horses escaped the carnage, and just three of those were left by the 29th of the 30 fences. At the second-last the leader Great Span's saddle slipped, leaving the American horse Billy Barton in front. But he fell at the last, leaving the way clear for the 100-1 shot Tipperary Tim and his rather surprised amateur rider Billy Dutton. Billy Barton's jockey Tommy Cullinan remounted and brought him home second: no other horses finished.\n\nIs it true that the rugby legend JPR Williams also won junior Wimbledon? asked Simon Mallett\n\nI've read this so many times in different books that it seems to be an accepted fact - but actually it's not true. JPR was a fine junior tennis player, and he did win a junior event which was played at the All-England Club at Wimbledon in 1966 (he beat the future Davis Cup player David Lloyd). But it was a domestic tournament, not the boys' singles event that is part of the Championships at Wimbledon each year. That was won in 1966 by the Russian Vladimir Korotkov (who retained the title he also won in 1965), and in fact hasn't been won by a British player since Stanley Matthews - son of the footballer of the same name - beat a more famous Russian, Alex Metreveli, to win it in 1962. Before that five British players had won the Wimbledon boys' singles, which was inaugurated in 1947: John Horn (1949), Bobby Wilson (1952), Billy Knight (1953), Mike Hann (1955) and James Tattersall (1957).\n\nI know that Dinara Safina and Caroline Wozniacki have reached No. 1 in the women's tennis rankings without ever winning a Grand Slam singles event. But have any men ever done this? asked Linda Wilde\n\nIt's not just Safina and Wozniacki for the women: Jelena Jankovic has also been ranked No. 1, but has not yet won a Grand Slam singles title. Kim Clijsters and Amelie Mauresmo also reached the top of the rankings before they won a major. But the only man to have been ranked No. 1 without ever winning one of the four Grand Slam singles titles is the Chilean Marcelo Rios, who reached top spot in March 1998 and stayed there for six weeks. He had just reached what turned out to be his only Grand Slam singles final - the 1998 Australian Open - but lost it to Petr Korda.\n\nI heard that the 1964 Olympic sprint champion Bob Hayes was so successful when he switched to American football that they had to change the rules to account for him. Is this correct? asked Malcolm Morris\n\nBob \"Bullet\" Hayes from Florida won the 100 metres gold medal in Tokyo in 1964 (he broke the world record with 10.06 in the final), and then switched to American football, initially as a wide receiver for Dallas Cowboys. His obvious speed made him a great success, especially at first, and he was on the winning side in Super Bowl VI in 1972. It's not really true to say that the rules were changed to combat Hayes, but new tactics had to be developed to counter his threat: he usually gets the credit for having forced teams to adopt \"zone defense\", in which the opponents spread out and keep to a set area rather than following their opposite number, and also \"bump and run\", when the defender tries to stop the attacker by almost any means!\n\nIf you want to ask Steven a question, use our feedback form.
