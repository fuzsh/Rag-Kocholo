        "text": "It was a great NFR for several Montanans over the past couple of weeks.\n\nThe National Finals Rodeo (NFR) wrapped up Saturday night down in Las Vegas. I had a great time sitting down and watching the 8th and 9th rounds on the Cowboy Channel. Then on Saturday, I was at the Montana Grizzlies semifinal football game, but thankfully the Sunrise Saloon in Missoula was showing the highlights from the NFR afterwards so I got to see the highlights from Round 10 at least.\n\nMelstone, Montana saddle bronc rider Sage Newman had a 91 point ride in the 10th round of the NFR. He came out 2nd place in the overall world standings for the year.\n\nMiles City, Montana tie-down roper Haven Meged (a former world champion) topped the NFR average and also came out 2nd place in the world standings for the year. Meged also broke an arena record during this year's NFR.\n\nCircle, Montana native Lisa Lockhart notched up a huge accomplishment for setting a record when it comes to career earnings in barrel racing. She also won the NFR average for barrel racing, and came in 2nd for the world standings.\n\nHere's a look at some of the overall standings.\n\nYou can also click here for a great report by the Montana Television Network's Scott Breen.
