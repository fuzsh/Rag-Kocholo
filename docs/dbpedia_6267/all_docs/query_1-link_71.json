        "text": "While a tension-wracked nation was preparing for Andy Murray's clash with Rafael Nadal, another British player had nervelessly progressed to his first Wimbledon final.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Liam Broady became only the fourth Briton to reach the boys' singles final in the open era when he overcame the Australian Jason Kubler 6-4, 6-3. The last Briton to win the junior Wimbledon singles title was the son of Sir Stanley Matthews, in 1962. In front of a packed crowd on Court 3, Broady showed no ill effects from a marathon quarter-final victory on Thursday that ended 13-11 in the final set.\n\nHowever the Lawn Tennis Association, under fire over declining participation figures and the lack of depth in the men's game, will not be able to claim any credit for Broady's success.\n\nIn September 2007, it temporarily withdrew funding from Broady's sister Naomi after pictures of her on a night out were posted on a social networking site. At the insistence of their father, neither Naomi – now 21 and Britain's No 4 women's player – nor Liam have accepted any support from the LTA since. It doesn't seem to have done his game any harm: Broady will face Australian Luke Saville in Saturday's final.\n\nBroady follows in illustrious footsteps. Fred Perry, who as we are reminded ad nauseum during Wimbledon fortnight was the last British man to win a Wimbledon singles title, in 1936, also hailed from Stockport.\n\nFormer British No 1 Greg Rusedski, who knows all about carrying the hopes of a nation, praised Broady earlier this week. And Broady revealed that John McEnroe had also offered his congratulations.\n\nAnd like Murray, the down-to-earth Broady appears to have a most un-British attitude to competing. \"I always go on court expecting to win, no matter who against,\" he said."
