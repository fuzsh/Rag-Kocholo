        "text": "When Henry Searle was last in Court No.1 at the All England Club, he was there as a spectator.\n\n“It was a few years ago,” he recalled. “I went to watch Roger [Federer]. It was my first time coming to Wimbledon. That was pretty special.”\n\nOn Sunday he will be back in the same illustrious arena. But this time not to watch, rather to play. The 17 year old from Wolverhampton is taking on the Russian Yaroslav Demin in the final of the Boy’s Singles. And if he is victorious, he will break a British duck that stretches back 61 years, right back to the time that Stanley Matthews, the son of one of the nation’s greatest-ever sportsmen, became the last British boy to win here.\n\n“I won’t really think about it too much,” he said of the potential to make history. “To be honest. I’ll just focus on myself. It’s another match at the end of the day and I’ll do my best to win. I can’t really control what goes on the outside.”\n\nSearle, unseeded when the tournament began, arrives in the final without dropping a single set. Driven by a blockbuster serve — he was recorded at firing one ace down at 129mph in his semi final, which is quicker than anything Novak Djokovic has delivered during this tournament — the left hander appears to have much in his armoury: a smart double handed backhand, a sweeping forehand coupled with an aggressive, attack-oriented outlook. Plus he has another intriguing advantage: a significant personal following. On Court No.4 as he played the fourth seed Cooper Williams, he was supported by a boisterous gathering of mates, a gaggle of tennis lads turning a quiet backwater of the All England Club into a passing replica of Molineux.\n\n“Yeah, there’s about 20 of them,” he said of his barmy army posse. “They’re mates from Newbridge tennis club, so they’ve all been around tennis for a long time. They’re very supportive. Half of them are season ticket holders at Wolves like me, so we all go to the football together as well.”\n\nLike Matthews Junior before him, Searle was quite a footballer when he was younger. But when he was 11, he decided to concentrate on tennis. And he subsequently won a place at the National Tennis Academy in Loughborough. This is not another example of the privileged kids supported by central funding that Dan Evans reckoned consume most of the annual development budget. With his noticeable Black Country accent, he is a rare example of a successful graduate from the LTA’s junior programme.\n\n“I think they’re always very, very supportive and wanting junior tennis to be as strong as possible, to try and compete with some of the some of the best countries in the world,” he says of the academy. “And I think the facilities are great at the NTC.”\n\nHis progress has been significant. Indeed, back in May he played Demin in the French Open Boy’s competition. And he won.\n\n“It’s definitely a confidence booster and it’s helping me going to the match tomorrow,” he said of that victory. “I’ve got to expect a better version of him tomorrow. Obviously he’s won a lot of matches this week and must be feeling pretty good. So I’ve got to go out and be prepared to face anything.”\n\nNot least the crowd. All of the Searle supporters who watched him win the semi final will be there on Court No.1. And their numbers will be boosted by many others who are making their way down from the Midlands to see their mate attempt to equal the achievement of his hero Federer in 1998. The support will bring back memories for Searle. Not least of watching Andy Murray win the Wimbledon title in 2016, when he was all of 10 years old.\n\n“I was watching at my local tennis club,” he said. “With many of the lads who were here today. So yes, it’s pretty cool having that same sort of environment around me.”"
