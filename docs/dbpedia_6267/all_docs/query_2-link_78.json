For Evening Sessions food delivery starts between 5:30-6:30PM. There is a very wide range of menu options you can order for your suite, both in terms of food type and price point.

Can Serena Willaims claim a record setting 24th major singles title or will she be dethroned by one of the many rising stars, including Americans Coco Gauff and Sofia Kenin? On the men's side, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are inching ever closer to Roger Federer's record 20 major championships. Can Federer extend his grip on the record or will another player take the crown? And perhaps the most underrated story line of the tournament is that this will be the last US Open for American doubles stars Mike and Bob Bryan, who are retiring after this season. Can they capture one final US Open crown? One thing is for certain, there is no better place to watch the action at the US Open than from the comfort of a luxury box.\n\nPast Spotlights\n\nThe 2018 U.S. Open Tennis Championship will be from August 27 – September 9, 2018.

If this is the case, certain clients are willing to pay a premium to be in a lower level suite that is closest to the action on the field. We will give you details on suite location as we provide you with availability for the game you desire.\n\nDoes it pay to wait to book a suite until closer to the event?\n\nWith regular tickets, prices will often drop in the days leading up to a game. While every once in a while the same occurs with suites, in general, pricing does not drop before the game. In fact, because of the very limited availability of luxury suites, it is advised to book a suite well in advance, as suites are often not available at the last minute. In addition, in coordinating events for larger groups (suites can hold up to 20 guests or more), it is often necessary to give guests a longer lead time to confirm their availability to attend.\n\nAre there additional expenses I should consider?\n\nIf you are hosting guests in your suite, consider allocating enough budget to order catering for your suite. Catering is typically not included in the price of the suite. Suite Experience Group clients typically spend between $1,000-$2,000 for catering, with some clients spending even more if they order significant amounts of alcohol.\n\nAre there discounts if I buy multiple games at once?\n\nSome clients purchase multiple suites in multiple venues at one time. Suite Experience Group can provide special package pricing for clients who buy three or more suites at one time.\n\nHow can I maximize my budget?\n\nIf you are working within a budget and trying to maximize your spend, we would welcome an opportunity to further discuss your goals for the event and the different options available to you. Please call us at 800-592-7043 or fill out this form to get started. We look forward to the opportunity to help you explore your options in renting a luxury suite."
