        "text": "A teenage tennis star has ended Britain's 61-year wait for a boys' singles champion at Wimbledon\n\nHenry Searle, who is 17, took the title after beating Yaroslav Demin, 6-4 6-4.\n\nThe last British boys' champion, in 1962, was Stanley Matthews - named after his dad, Sir Stanley Matthews, a legendary Blackpool and England footballer.\n\nThe teenager didn't lose a single set during the tournament.\n\nHe said: \"I am going to try to enjoy it. It was amazing in front of this crowd today.\"\n\nWolverhampton-born Henry, a big fan of Wolverhampton Wanderers football team, also received a message from the football club's manager Julen Lopetegui in the build-up to his final and the youngster said it was \"pretty cool\" to have his successes recognised in that way.\n\nLots of Henry's family and friends were wearing T-shirts printed with 'Henry's Barmy Army' sat in the stands, chanting and jumping to their feet with every point he won.\n\nHenry is only the 12th British boy EVER to win one of the biggest boys' Grand Slam titles and the first since 2011.\n\nHe is the first Briton to win a junior Wimbledon title since Laura Robson in 2008 and, most impressively, the first boy to lift the trophy in more than half a century."
