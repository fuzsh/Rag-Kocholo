        "text": "A new set of winners will be crowned at Wimbledon this year with dreams set to be made and crushed right across the iconic tennis Grand Slam over the next two weeks.\n\nWhilst the women’s and men’s final stole the show on the final weekend of last year’s tournament, there were plenty of other trophies being handed out to deserving winners right around the famous grounds of SW19.\n\nAnd as is customary, the victorious players all gathered together for the Wimbledon Champions Dinner at the All England Club on the Sunday evening of the final day of action.\n\nLet’s take a look back at the full list of winners from last year’s Championships.\n\nWho won Wimbledon last year?\n\nCarlos Alcaraz beat Novak Djokovic in an epic five set duel to clinch his second Grand Slam title following on from his maiden triumph at the US Open the previous year.\n\nThe 1-6, 7-6, 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 win saw Alcaraz, then 20, became the third-youngest man to lift the Wimbledon trophy after Boris Becker and Björn Borg.\n\nIt was the first time that Djokovic had tasted defeat on Centre Court since losing to Andy Murray in the final 11 years ago.\n\nThe men’s final took place a day after the women’s showpiece, which saw Czechia’s Marketa Vondrousova pick up her maiden Grand Slam title with victory over Ons Jabeur, 6-4, 6-4.\n\nVondrousova became the first unseeded women to win Wimbledon whilst Jabeur broke down in tears after suffering her second defeat in the final in as many years.\n\nElsewhere, Henry Searle became the first British junior to win the boys’ title at Wimbledon since Stanley Matthews, son of the legendary former footballer, in 1962.\n\nThe then 17 year-old from Wolverhampton beat fifth seed Yaroslav Demin 6-4, 6-4 on Court 1 on the final day of the Championships.\n\nThe British pair of Alfie Hewett and Gordon Reid won their fifth Wimbledon wheelchairs doubles title – and their 18th Grand Slam together, with a 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 win over Japan’s Takuya Miki and Tokito Oda.\n\nHowever, there was to be no repeat in the wheelchair singles final for Hewett, who was beaten by Oda, 6-4, 6-2, having also lost in the final the previous year.\n\nThe Wimbledon singles title remains the only one missing from Hewett’s CV which features eight Grand Slam trophies across the other three majors.\n\nAnd there was yet more success for the Brits, with Neal Skupski winning his first Grand Slam men’s doubles title alongside Dutch partner Wesley Koolhof.\n\nThe top seeds got the better of Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos, 6-4, 6-4 on Centre Court.\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below\n\nMORE : How much is the Wimbledon prize money for 2024?\n\nMORE : Meet the Wimbledon 2024 tennis presenters, commentators and pundits"
