I didn't expect this amazing support and this court. I am feeling like I'm living in a dream. I'm so happy,\" Oda said.\n\n\"I want to thank Alfie and his support team. It was not easy playing in this situation against home country players.\n\n\"I am still 17 - I wanted to open the champagne but I couldn't so maybe I will have sparking water with my team.\"\n\nIn the quad wheelchair final, Netherlands top seed Niels Vink beat Australia's Heath Davidson 6-1 6-2 for his first Wimbledon victory.\n\nIn the boys’ singles Briton’s Harry Searle won the tournament to end the 61-year wait for a British victory, with the last win coming for Stanley Matthews, son of the England footballer of the same name.\n\nThe 17-year-old came into the tournament unseeded and defeated Russia’s Yaroslav Demin 6-4 6-4 on Court One.\n\nHe will now move into the top-10 seedings after his win, and built on his French Open quarter-final earlier in the summer.\n\n- - -\n\nStream both Wimbledon singles finals live on July 15 and 16, on discovery+, the Eurosport app and at eurosport.com\n\nWimbledon\n\nBoulter lauds 'idol' Murray as the 'epitome of tennis'\n\n21/11/2023 at 12:01\n\nWimbledon\n\n‘I still can’t believe it’ – Epic Wimbledon win not yet sunk in for Alcaraz\n\n06/08/2023 at 15:04"
