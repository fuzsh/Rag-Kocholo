        "text": "Oliver Golding's victory over Renzo Olivo today meant he and Laura Robson will become the first British boy and girl to play in the semi-finals of the same Junior Wimbledon since Glynis Coles and Buster Mottram in 1972.\n\nThe last British boy to reach the junior final at Wimbledon was Miles Kasiri in 2004. Stanley Matthews Jr, son of Sir Stanley, was the most recent winner from these shores, in 1962.\n\nGolding, as he had done in the previous round, came from a set behind to beat Olivo, the Argentinian No9 seed, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. The 16-year-old's victory sets up a meeting with the unseeded Australian Ben Mitchell, though the result was in doubt during the opening set as Golding struggled to discover form.\n\nHe said: \"Sometimes I almost need to let things out. Shout, or hit a ball to get myself going. I ran round a return and smacked the crap out of it. That is what got me going. Today probably wasn't my best serving performance in the tournament but I won through in the end.\n\n\"It is so important on grass because if you make your first serve, you are almost guaranteed to win the point. I'm working a lot on my movement. It has been tough for me because I have grown a lot in the last couple of years.\"\n\nWhether or not Golding, who gave up a successful acting career to focus solely on tennis, can emulate Matthews Jr, he is sure to be heralded as potentially the next big thing in British tennis. Has he considered this? \"I am not really thinking about that. I am thinking about the next match,\" he added. \"[But] I shall probably only play in the junior grand slams next year â€” other than that I will try to break through in the seniors.\""
