        "text": "Regardless of your favorite sport, I will try to convince you that basketball is one-of-a-kind. My claim: it is the most intimate of all the professional sports. I have three reasons for you‚Ä¶ REASON #1 - The square-foot-per-player ratio By dividing the surface area of a court/field in a given sport by the number of players allowed on that court/field, you can approximate how much space is ‚Äúallotted‚Äù to each player. American football ‚Äî> 57,600 sq ft / 22 players = ~2,618 sq ft/player Soccer ‚Äî> 81,000 sq ft / 22 players = ~3,681 sq ft/player Baseball (varies by field) ‚Äî> 110,000 sq ft / 13 players (bases loaded) = ~8,461 sq ft/player Hockey ‚Äî> 17,000 sq ft / 12 players = ~1,416 sq ft/player Basketball? 4,700 square feet / 10 players = 470 sq ft/player That's less than one-third of the operating space of the next closest (hockey). The delta is massive. Players are not spread out in basketball. They are right next to each other, all of the time. And for the viewer, you can see all the action within a small surface area. It‚Äôs exhilarating. (And the players are generally huge, which accentuates the contrast.) REASON #2 - The courtside phenomenon Next time you watch an NBA game, look at the space between the feet of the fan sitting front row (courtside) and the out-of-bounds line. It is astonishingly small. If you explained basketball to someone who had never heard of it, and you told them about how close the fans sit, they would laugh at you and suggest that couldn‚Äôt be true because it‚Äôs too dangerous. It‚Äôs the only sport where you can go to a game, grab a beer, and sit back in your seat only to have said beer suddenly spill on you because a player just landed in your lap diving for a loose ball. Silly as it sounds, this is a common occurrence. For the players, it fosters a level of player-fan connection unlike any other sporting event. The typical obnoxious fan in the stands can now smell your sweat on an inbounds pass. I‚Äôve sat courtside at a handful of Pelicans games. I could hear the coaches and players. There‚Äôs nothing like it. The closeness ratchets up the intensity. REASON #3 - Zero facial obstructions Consider football and hockey. Headgear obscures the faces of the players (more so in football than in hockey) which dampens the emotion conveyed to the fans. People watch sports for the players (e.g. the current Caitlin Clark moment). We like players for their talent but we love players for their personalities. A television broadcast works relentlessly to capture players' emotions in pivotal moments. We scrutinize their body language and their faces. In basketball, your face is front and center. Unlike baseball and soccer, the cameras are MUCH closer to the players because of the court size (players trip over the camera crew all the time‚Ä¶ another crazy element of the game that our basketball foreigner would find hard to believe). Are you convinced? üèÄ\n\nResults matter more than Entertainment for Soccer Fans This is one of the biggest differences between soccer culture and the culture of typical North American sports. Fans primarily attend NBA, NHL, and MLB games to have a good time. Soccer supporters, on the other hand, go to matches to express their emotions, actively support their team, and try to help them win. Singing, chanting, jumping, putting pressure on the opponent, and being part of grand performances ‚Äì that's the agenda of a soccer fan in countries where this sport is top-rated. Fans enjoy the support process, and their main goal is victory. You'll never see soccer fans satisfied with attending a match their team lost. The slogan \"It's not the winning, it's the taking part that counts\" has nothing to do with reality. Sure, some teams that might qualify for the World Cup 2026 will be happy just to participate. But their fans, like all fans coming to Canada, the USA, and Mexico, will devote all their energy and emotions to help their teams win. PS. Let's rally together for the 2026 World Cup, delving deeper into the rich ocean of soccer culture. And remember, when you're at the stadium, it's not a movie theater ‚Äì skip the popcorn! Teams thrive on your vocal support and unwavering passion!\n\nIn the vast, varied world of sports, where the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat play out on fields, courts, and arenas around the globe, it's easy to get caught up in the high stakes and intense competition. Yet, sometimes, it's the lighter moments that catch our attention and remind us of the sheer unpredictability and joy of sports. This past weekend offered up a prime example of sports' unpredictable nature, and no, it wasn't anything to do with the NBA All-Star Game. Instead, the spotlight unexpectedly fell on a rather peculiar incident - one that might be dubbed as the \"absolute silliest\" moment in recent sports memory. Without giving too much away, let's just say it involved an unexpected participant in a setting far removed from their natural habitat, creating a scene that was as bewildering as it was entertaining. Why does this matter in the grand scheme of things? It's a reminder that sports, for all its competitiveness and intensity, is also a source of joy and communal laughter. It's these unexpected moments that often become memorable, talked-about even years later, not just for the novelty, but for the shared experience they provide. I invite you to reflect on and share your favorite \"silly\" sports moments. What unexpected events have given you a good laugh or left you shaking your head in disbelief? Let's celebrate the lighter side of sports together. https://lnkd.in/ecRitxFa\n\nI really am a traditionalist and struggle with the playoff systems employed in the USA when it comes to soccer. I am really interested to hear the pros and cons from this wide audience from LinkedIn on this subject! Soccer countries around the world value their ‚Äúleague champions‚Äù as the best team for that season but they also run a ‚Äúknockout cup‚Äù competition to give the opportunity for less consistent teams to have success. The current pro leagues in the USA (from my perspective) play 32-36 games to make the 3rd round of the FA Cup? (Playoffs) How many times does the Top team win the playoffs in the USA? Doing the double back in the English Premiership and winning the FA Cup, is equally rare. Surely the team that wins the most games in the season has to be truly recognized as the best team? Not a team that can put a run of 4-5 games together? (With draws and penalty shootouts making it even more subjective) I also struggle with ‚Äúhow many‚Äù teams actually ‚Äúmake‚Äù the playoffs and how few ‚Äúfail‚Äù to make playoffs? Again for me, this system is driven by marketing people to generate money. However, does it actually generate more money than the traditional league season? If more emphasis was put on winning the league would more games be valuable? Especially at the start of the seasonü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è My real issue is that this system drips down into the youth system and really creates havoc for parents! Having so many games that help you ‚Äúwin‚Äù or ‚Äúqualify to win‚Äù puts real pressure on kids from parents and generates false success to coaches. That‚Äôs why ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù struggles against ‚Äúwinning‚Äù in youth soccer here in the states. I get it that in other sports the ‚Äúplayoff system‚Äù is traditional and I truly respect it! But for soccer it is not traditional. With US Soccer wanting to ‚Äúfoster the best playing environment‚Äù should they look at this area of competition? Thought üí≠\n\nIn The Company of Crowds Last night, me and about 16-to-18,000 of my closest friends gathered around giant TV to watch the Vancouver Canucks hockey game. Well, what actually happened was that my buddy and I went to a ‚ÄòWatch Party‚Äô at our home arena, while the Canucks played the Oilers in Edmonton. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect? Going to a hockey arena and watching the game on a screen above the empty ice rink felt a bit surreal. Even from the National Anthem before the game, it felt electric with a genuinely excited crowd. Then, like this was a pantomime, the crowd would boo and cheer pre-game when the camera focused on the Edmonton versus Vancouver players. This continued throughout the game, almost every time there was a stop in play. It was a lot of fun cheering along with so many people but I couldn‚Äôt shake the oddity of so many fans coming to a massive arena to watch an away game on a giant screen; Everyone shouting and cheering as if they were actually at the game‚Ä¶ Buying popcorn, and beer, and game day food; and all decked out in Vancouver fan wear, mostly in the away game jerseys. I spent a good part of the night fully immersed in the game. And yet, I also had these meta-moments where I‚Äôd think about the fact that my shared experience with all these people was more like watching the game at home with friends than it was actually going to the game. One minute I‚Äôm feeling this whole experience is odd, and the next I‚Äôm fully caught up in the fervour and excitement of the game and the crowd. Participating in the wave was fun the first 3 rounds, watching the crowd go up and down in unison, then by the 7th time I‚Äôm wondering why this is still happening with no audience besides the audience? The answer is, it‚Äôs all about the power of crowds. The power of being near others with common energy and spirit. The power of sharing a moment, an excited experience with others who have the same intentions. Since before the colosseum and gladiators, crowds have gathered to cheer for talented heroes of one sort or the other. Warriors and athletes performing at their peak, with only one of two outcomes: victory or defeat. And it is so much more fun, in the company of crowds. _____ Shared on my Daily-Ink blog: https://lnkd.in/gBZGxnKC\n\nIt's been a while since my last update, and the sports media landscape has seen plenty of action. Given my experience working with ESPN on the Little League World Series, I felt compelled to share insights on the upcoming NFL Flag Championships, happening this week at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. The NFL seems to be drawing from the LLWS playbook for its Flag Championships event, aiming to foster a community-centric and grassroots atmosphere. Over 2,800 young athletes will participate, with the event receiving extensive coverage across Disney platforms. However, I'm somewhat skeptical about whether this initiative can replicate the unique charm and widespread appeal of the LLWS. Other sports, notably soccer, have tried to capture similar magic without the same level of success. Moreover, while American football is a dominant force in the U.S., its international appeal is more limited, primarily showcased during occasional NFL games abroad. The inclusion of flag football in the 2028 Olympics clearly signals the NFL's intent to globalize the sport. Having witnessed the impact of well-coordinated youth sports events firsthand, I‚Äôm curious to see if the NFL‚Äôs strategy will significantly boost flag football's popularity, both in the U.S. and globally. Is this initiative a genuine opportunity for growth, or merely an ambitious attempt with challenging odds? I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Could this strategy effectively elevate flag football on the global sports stage?\n\nüöÄ Are you ready to embark on a journey beyond the stars, where the clash between Warriors and Mavericks takes center stage? üèÄ Today, the trending topic on Google revolves around the Warriors vs. Mavericks game.

Last night marked the end of our summer league basketball season. The playoffs are \"win to stay in,\" and we ended up losing by 2 in the final seconds of the game. üòû When all was said and done, my brother gathered everyone on the sideline for one final chat and said \"I have one last question for you before we part ways... Who was the leader on this team?\" All of the young men kind of looked at each other and then one finally piped up and said \"no one.\" To which my brother went into teaching mode... and hopefully the lesson sunk in for some of them. ü§î As a team sport, basketball requires communication, and it also requires someone taking the lead. Most people assume it should be the point guard, but his point last night was two-fold. 1. Someone has to be willing to step up and lead. Maybe not in the first game, but it should have happened by game 3 or 4. 2. You don't have to be \"in charge\" to lead. Titles and positions mean very little when it comes to true leadership. This morning while thinking about it over breakfast, a memory from 10+ years ago popped into my head. I was at a conference for women, and after a few speakers they broke us into small groups for a team building activity / challenge. After a few unproductive minutes of trying to get started, I stepped up and took the lead in coordinating our group. And here's the crazy thing, until a few years ago and finishing my book, I never thought of myself as a natural leader. In that moment, however, I knew if we were going to complete the activity in the time allotted, someone had to step up and take charge. So I did so in a respectful manner. So here are my questions for the day... Can you remember a time when you had the opportunity to step up, but didn't? What made you hesitate? And what was the final outcome? Now let's switch gears... Is there an opportunity in your life right now to step up? What's making you hesitate? What will it take for you to take a deep breath (it is Woosah Wednesday after all) and go for it?\n\nMost people have heard of the USA Basketball \"Dream Team\" üèÄ But do you know the Jerry Colangelo story? He transformed US basketball into an unstoppable gold medal force. In 2004, USA basketball was made up of some of the most talented stars in their sport... But they spectacularly failed on the big stage. The 2004 humiliation called for change, and Team USA chiefs turned to Jerry Colangelo to steady the ship and get the side moving back in the right direction. How did he do it? 1Ô∏è‚É£ Team selection Choosing your people is the first decision you make as a leader so make it a good one. Jerry took interviews very seriously and took time to conduct personal, face-to-face interviews to: ü§ù Emphasise the commitment & what is expected of you üë§ Find out who you are outside of the game üá∫üá∏ Understand why you believe in the team's cause/mission 2Ô∏è‚É£ Team makeup He kept Carmelo, Wade, Boozer and Lebron from the 2004 losing US team. Those people have more at stake and can help teammates understand the greater context of the frustration and heartbreak of the last tournament. Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. The best teams in history contain a mixture of: 1) Experienced players who bring credibility and institutional understanding 2) Young players who bring energy and keep the overall team environment fresh and relevant Make sure you have a good mix of both in your team. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Team character Jerry made sure all individuals were united by a foundation of character. He made players want to give more of themselves and be part of something bigger. Michael Redd exemplified this. He drove from his team practise in Milwaukee, where he was one of the best players - averaging 20 points a game - to meet with Jerry in Chicago ahead of team selection. When Jerry answered the door, he was still in his gym clothes so he asked to use the restroom. Strange request upon arrival. A few minutes later he emerged in a suit and tie. Details matter. The players had started to treat the process with the utmost respect. ------ Before you get into the mission and strategy, the people are the ones who will accomplish that mission. Take more time than you think you need to select your Xs and Os. ------ Enjoy this?
