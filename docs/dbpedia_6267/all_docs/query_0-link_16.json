        "text": "His 1-6, 7-6 (8-6), 6-1, 3-6, 6-4 win in four hours and 42 minutes ranks as the second-longest final ever played at the All England Club.\n\nAlcaraz becomes the third youngest man in the open era to win Wimbledon after a 17-year-old Boris Becker in 1985 and a 20-year-old Bjorn Borg in 1976.\n\n“I haven’t played a player like him ever, to be honest,” Djokovic, 36, said of Alcaraz. “Roger [Federer] and Rafa [Nadal] have their own obvious strengths and weaknesses. Carlos is a very complete player with amazing adapting capabilities that are a key for longevity and for a successful career on all surfaces.\n\n“I think people have been talking in the past 12 months or so about his game consisting of certain elements from Roger, Rafa and myself. I would agree with that. I think he’s got basically the best of all three worlds. He’s got this mental resilience and real maturity for someone who is 20 years old. It’s quite impressive.\n\n“He’s got this Spanish bull mentality of competitiveness, fighting spirit and incredible defence that we’ve seen with Rafa over the years. And I think he’s got some nice sliding backhands that has some similarities with my backhands.”\n\nIn a significant victory for the younger generation, Alcaraz ended Djokovic’s long run of dominance on Centre Court. The Serb had won 45 consecutive matches on the world’s most famous tennis court since losing the 2013 final against Andy Murray.\n\n“I did it for myself, not for the tennis generation,” Alcaraz, who joins Nadal and Manuel Santana in the small club of Spaniards to have triumphed in the men’s singles here, said. “It was great. Beating Novak at his best, in this stage, making history — being the guy to beat him after ten years unbeaten on that court is amazing for me. It’s something that I will never forget, that’s for sure.\n\n“It’s great for the new generation as well, to see me beating him and making them think that they are capable to do it, as well.”\n\nAlcaraz has breathed new life into the men’s game by winning the US Open at the age of 19 last year and now Wimbledon. This is the first time since 2002 that any man other than Djokovic, Nadal, Federer and Murray has triumphed here. “Right now it is the happiest moment of my life, that’s for sure,” Alcaraz said. “Probably in five years it will change. Right now, I’m 20, I didn’t live too many situations like this, so I’m going to enjoy this moment.\n\n“Beating Novak, winning the Wimbledon championship is something that I dreamt about since I started playing tennis. That’s why it is the biggest moment of my life. It’s amazing for a boy of 20 years old, I didn’t expect to reach this kind of situation really fast. I am really proud of myself. I am really proud of the team that I have had, the work we put in every day to be able to live this experience.”\n\nAlcaraz’s victory keeps him ahead of Djokovic at the top of the world rankings. He leads their head-to-head record 2-1, with Djokovic admitting that he is already hoping for another rematch at next month’s US Open.\n\nAsked if this was the beginning of a big rivalry, Djokovic replied: “I would hope so, for my sake. He’s going to be on the tour for quite some time. I don’t know how long I’ll be around.\n\n“Let’s see. It’s been only three matches that we played against each other. Three really close matches. Two already this year in the latter stages of grand slams [Djokovic won in the semi-finals of last month’s French Open]\n\n“I hope we get to play in the US Open. Why not? I think it’s good for the sport, numbers one and two in the world facing each other in almost a five-hour, five-set thriller. It couldn’t be better for our sport in general.”\n\n● 46: Centre Court matches won in succession — the longest run of its kind in the court’s history\n\n● Six: Years since Djokovic had lost a singles match on any court at Wimbledon\n\n● 15: Successive tie-breaks won in grand-slams until the second set in this final\n\n● 80: Completed matches at Wimbledon won in succession when he had won the first set until this match (79 wins, and one defeat to Rafa Nadal, in which injury forced Djokovic to retire)\n\n● Seven: Years since he had lost to a world No 1 — Andy Murray in the title match of the 2016 ATP Finals\n\n● 17: Years since he had lost a five-set match at Wimbledon (v Mario Ancic in round of 16 in 2006); he is now 10-2 in five-set matches at SW19\n\nIncredible. Djokovic has been dethroned and there is a new king of Wimbledon. The Spaniard lobs Djokovic beautifully before playing an exquisite drop-shot volley then firing down a rocket serve to earn a match point. He forces Djokovic deep, the Serbian is unable to return and the 20-year-old collapses at the net. He has done it — this extraordinary talent becomes the youngest player ever to win two men’s singles title.\n\nDjokovic 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 4-5 Alcaraz. A delightful drop shot followed by a bullet second-serve ace takes Alcaraz to 5-3 in the final set and means Djokovic has to serve to stay in the match. He holds to 15 and now has one more chance to break Alcaraz and get back on level terms.\n\nOwen Slot: The beauty, surprise and absurdly good execution of Alcaraz’s drop shots have been quite wonderful.\n\nDjokovic 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 1-3 Alcaraz. This is extraordinary tennis. Alcaraz earns a break point, which Djokovic is initially in control of, but he then slips on to the floor. He gets back to his feet and regains the upper hand, but is then passed by a beauty of a backhand by the Spaniard. Djokovic earns a warning for smashing his racket on the net post before Alcaraz consolidates the break by holding to love.\n\nOwen Slot: The match has turned again. Finally we have a break and it required some brilliance from Alcaraz to pull it off. He followed that by serving out his own service game to love. He leads the set 3-1.\n\nOwen Slot: Djokovic 6-1, 6-7, 1-6, 6-3, 1-1 Alcaraz. Oh my. The fifth set is only two games old and already feels like an epic. Both players have faced break points and defended them. No one is letting their levels drop.\n\nDjokovic earns three breaks points, Alcaraz double faults on the second of them, and this incredible final is now going the distance. Such is the tightness of this match that at the beginning of that last game, Djokovic and Alcaraz had both won the exact number of points in the match (134). The Serbian then assuredly claimed the fourth set 6-3 to take the match into a fifth set.\n\nStuart Fraser: Classic Djokovic here, biding his time and waiting for his opportunity to work his way back into the match. There was a drop in intensity from Alcaraz midway through that fourth set and Djokovic took full advantage, breaking serve for 3-2. You would not think that it is Djokovic, 36, on the upper end of the 16-year age difference with Alcaraz, 20.\n\nThe grit and resilience of Djokovic will never seize to amaze. Edged in the second set, outclassed in the third, but now he is a break up in the fourth after showing incredible fight against the Alcaraz serve. The Serbian then consolidates the break and as the match clock ticks to three hours and 44 minutes, Djokovic leads the fourth set 4-2.\n\nOwen Slot: There’s now a bit of Freddy Krueger about Djokovic. You might think you’ve killed him off, but he’s straight back to haunt you. At 0-1, he defended two break points to serve out the game. Then, at 2-2, he earned himself three break points on the Alcaraz serve and claimed the third of them. By no means is he done.\n\nDjokovic looks more settled so far in this third set but the resilient defence and powerful shot-making of Alcaraz is making him work for every point. A couple of stunning Alcaraz passes takes the game to deuce, but Djokovic then whips a delightful inside-out cross-court forehand to take the fourth set to 2-2. To contextualise how impressive Alcaraz has been so far: it has been ten years and nine days since the Serbian last lost on Centre Court.\n\nDjokovic is completely rattled and the third set is now gone with Alcaraz claiming it 6-1. It is little wonder that the Serbian then heads down the tunnel with his bag — he urgently needs a reset. Alcaraz, meanwhile, has been outstanding, as Nick Kyrgios attests:\n\nStuart Fraser: After an extraordinary set came an extraordinary game. Those of us sitting in the press seats here on Centre Court believe that 26 minutes is likely a record for the longest game ever played at Wimbledon. Bear in mind that tennis has moved on from the 1980s and 1990s of wham-bam grass-court play.\n\nThis has been some turnaround from the first set. Alcaraz is now within one set of a first Wimbledon title at the age of 20. But do not rule Djokovic out yet. I’ve seen him battle back from the brink of defeat on so many occasions through the years.\n\nOwen Slot: Before the fourth set could begin, there were loud chants of “Carlos! Carlos!” It’s like Centre Court can see where this is going. Some numbers which show where Djokovic’s game has gone: in the first set, his first-serve percentage was 76 per cent, in the third, it was 61. In the first set, he made two unforced errors, in the third, he made 18.\n\nThat was an absolutely extraordinary game, lasting more than 25 minutes and with 13 deuces on the Djokovic serve. It’s difficult to believe how many unforced errors the 36-year-old is making, and Alcaraz is now 4-1 and two breaks to the good in this third set. They played two-thirds as many points in that one game as they did in the entirety of the first set and the match has now been going on for two hours and 51 minutes.\n\nOwen Slot: Huge game at 3-1: it takes 26 minutes, requires 13 deuces and seven break points before Alcaraz finally breaks Djokovic for the second time in this set. What really stands out now are the struggles of the champion. Djokovic is teetering here. His first serve percentage has dipped, his unforced errors are mounting. We haven’t seen him like this before at this Wimbledon.\n\nDjokovic 6-1, 6-7, 1-3 Alcaraz. Alcaraz has had all the momentum in this second set, but he misplaces a simple volley then fires a backhand well long to give Djokovic two break points. The Spaniard saves both after two uncharacteristic errors by Djokovic, however, before holding with an intelligently placed slice and a blistering 128mph serve.\n\nDjokovic is muttering after a let call for a serve that didn’t seem to flick the net — the umpire can only follow what the technology tells him — and Alcaraz then breaks. It is the first time the Spaniard has led in this final.\n\nOwen Slot: Will we be looking back on this as a turning point? Having lost the tie-break — which feels like a historical occurrence — Djokovic has had a game where he has a) missed a ball with an airshot and b) questioned a net-call on his serve, which is effectively challenging a machine. For Alcaraz’s second break point, Djokovic then netted a backhand, unforced, to concede the game. No doubt he will reset but this is very un-Djoko-like and, for the first time in the match, Alcaraz looks the dominant player.\n\nDjokovic races into a 3-0 lead in the tie-break but Alcaraz fights back with an ace that spins wide and beyond the Serbian’s forehand. An under-cooked drop shot by Djokovic takes the breaker to 3-3, but he makes amends with a sumptuously weighted volley. The reigning champion then receives a time violation for taking too long to serve before consecutive missed ground strokes provide Alcaraz with a set point. And the Spaniard takes it! It comes after a stunning backhand return, passing the oncoming Djokovic, who was attempting to serve and volley. After an hour and 25 minutes, the 20-year-old has levelled the final.\n\nStuart Fraser: What a tremendous set of tennis. Eighty-five minutes of enthralling action, which is such a contrast to that quick opening set. Ear-splitting cheers from the Centre Court crowd on two occasions in the tie-break, first when Djokovic was given a warning for a time violation and then when Alcaraz steered that backhand return down the line for the set. It brings to an end Djokovic’s streak of 15 consecutive tie-breaks won at grand-slam tournaments since the Australian Open. One set all.\n\nAlcaraz is effectively changing the pace with a mixture of sliced backhands and powerful forehands, but Djokovic holds to take the second set to 6-6 and a tie-break.\n\nOwen Slot: Djokovic pulls off an amazing feat of escapology to seal the game for 5-5. Alcaraz stares back over the net in amazement. The crowd are pretty impressed too and there are chants of “Novak! Novak!” filling Centre Court. You don’t often hear that in here.\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales as well as Prince George and Princess Charlotte have been enjoying the final in the Royal Box.\n\nOwen Slot: Djokovic 6-1, 3-4 Alcaraz. Alcaraz has properly settled. But in order to settle, some truly outstanding tennis has been required of him. Djokovic’s defence is preposterously good. Alcaraz keeps on hitting shots that look like winners, but then they come back at him and he has to hit another load of winners all over again. It must be exhausting.\n\nThis is exhilarating tennis. Alcaraz manufactures another break point but Djokovic saves it after a pulsating 29-shot rally.\n\nA deft drop shot at the net followed by a rocket serve to Alcaraz’s backhand sees the Serbian hold and take the second set to 2-2.\n\nDjokovic 6-1, 1-2 Alcaraz. Brilliant from Djokovic as Alcaraz is unable to consolidate his early break of serve in this second set. The Serbian gets back on level terms before releasing an enormous roar.\n\nOwen Slot: OK. Reality check. Alcaraz hasn’t just marched back into the match. He’s just been broken back. Djokovic roars. A really big, deep, angry, aggressive roar.\n\nDjokovic 6-1, 0-2 Alcaraz. Now Alcaraz has found his feet. He is getting the louder cheers from the Wimbledon crowd and gets his first break of the match immediately in the second set. It feels as though Alcaraz has to win each point multiple times, such is the resilience of quality of Djokovic’s defence. He leads the second set 2-0, however.\n\nOwen Slot: The quality that is required of Alcaraz to win points here is extraordinary. But he’s got a toehold into the match at least with a break of Djokovic’s serve. But how hard was that? At 15-30, Alcaraz seemed to have won the point twice, but Djokovic hung in, turned it round and hit a winner that Alcaraz couldn’t reach.\n\nHenry Searle has meanwhile won the boys’ singles title on Court No 1, beating Yaroslav Denim 6-4, 6-4. The 17-year-old becomes the first British boys’ Wimbledon champion since 1962, ending a 61-year wait. The last person from Great Britain to win the boys’ singles was Stanley Matthews, the son of legendary footballer Sir Stanley Matthews.\n\nSearle’s three predecessors as British winners of the girls’ or boys’ singles at Wimbledon were Matthews (1962), Annabel Croft (1984), and Laura Robson (2008). Both Croft and Robson went on to make the world’s top 30 in the senior women’s rankings but both retired earlier than they might have done, in Robson’s case because of a series of injuries.\n\nDjokovic emphatically dispatches an overhead smash and with it he claims the first set 6-1. It has been an entirely dominant display by the Serbian.\n\nStuart Fraser: A brutal first set for Alcaraz. Obviously some nerves at play here in his first Wimbledon final but he has not really been given a chance by the great Djokovic to settle into the contest. Djokovic made only two unforced errors in 34 minutes. He’s dialled in and it’s hard to see anything other than a 24th grand-slam title for the Serbian this afternoon.\n\nOwen Slot: Djokovic 5-0. This match is 24 minutes in and has already taken a huge swing to Djokovic. It’s not just that he has now broken Alcaraz’s first two service games, it’s also what this must be doing to Alcaraz’s head. “What must I do? Where do I attack him?” Already this must be psychologically stressing him.\n\nThis is a horror start for Alcaraz as Djokovic breaks again to take a 4-0 lead. There have been far too many unforced errors from the Spaniard so far.\n\nOwen Slot: Djokovic 2-0. Already fascinating. Alcaraz had a break point on Djokovic’s serve and couldn’t take it. Djokovic then raced to 0-40 on Alcaraz’s serve and took the third of the three opportunities.\n\nWe’re under way on Centre with Djokovic serving first. The Serbian has a nasty slip on the baseline before an uncharacteristic unforced error at the net provides Alcaraz with a break point. Djokovic saves it, before holding with a lovely serve out wide to the Spaniard’s backhand.\n\nOwen Slot: On Centre Court. Waiting. Two things: 1. The roof is open. Not long ago at all, it was hammering it down. I think the smart reading of the closed roof, which is what we were expecting, is that it would favour Djokovic; 2. Can Alcaraz hold it together? That’s a fairly crude reference to his cramping in the French Open, which I don’t think anyone completely understands. (The mind, the body, they can be complicated. Who’d have thought?) But this has occupied much of the conversation pre-match.\n\nIn other news, Brad Pitt is sitting four rows in front of me. No suggestion at this stage what are the strengths of his game or who he is rooting for.\n\nDavid Brown: Henry Seare, the Wolverhampton wonderkid, is being cheered on by a 50-strong group of fans organised by his local tennis club. The group, wearing t-shirts with the slogan “Henry’s Barmy Army”, are bringing a football-style atmosphere to Court No 1.\n\nSearle, 17, is hoping to end a 61-year wait for a British junior boys’ title winner at Wimbledon with victory over Russian Yaroslav Demin, also 17.\n\nSearle started playing tennis aged three at Newbridge Tennis Club, where he is still a member. He is a supporter of Wolverhampton Wanderers football club, and Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui sent a good luck video message before the final.\n\nThe anticipation is building inside Centre Court and despite a few drops of rain not long ago, the roof is still open. It will be intriguing to see how Alcaraz approaches this clash — he is still learning on grass and memories of the French Open semi-final, when he lost to Djokovic after suffering from muscle cramps, will be fresh in his mind.\n\nMeanwhile, Great Britain’s Henry Searle has just won the first set 6-4 against the Russian fifth seed Yaroslav Demin in the boys’ singles final on Court No 1.\n\nSpeaking on BBC One, Martina Navratilova, who won the ladies’ singles nine times, says: “We were hoping for this final at Roland Garros and we got two sets, really. Now it’s amazing. Both players at the peak of their game. Alcaraz is still improving, Djokovic is also still improving which is ridiculous at this age and both at the peak of their physical powers, it’s going to be a fantastic match.”\n\nStuart Fraser: Enzo Couacaud, a 28-year-old Frenchman ranked No 158 in the world, should give himself a little pat on the back as he prepares to try to qualify for the Nordea Open on the clay courts of Bastad, Sweden. He may be more than 600 miles from the focus of the tennis world at Wimbledon this afternoon but he holds a considerable honour on tour as the only man to win a tie-break against Novak Djokovic at a grand-slam tournament this year.\n\nSince Djokovic lost the second-set tie-break 7-5 in his Australian Open second-round match against Couacaud on January 19, he has embarked on one of the great streaks in tennis. His run of 15 consecutive tie-breaks won in grand-slam contests has comfortably surpassed Pete Sampras’s open era record of 12 in 1994.\n\nThere could be more to follow on Centre Court today when the 36-year-old Djokovic takes on Carlos Alcaraz, 20, in a mouthwatering final. As much as the Serb would prefer to ease through the sets for the loss of only a few games, he will back himself to prevail should a tie-break be required. For much of his 20-year professional career, he has been a master of peaking when it matters most.\n\n● Read the full article: Tie-break record gives Djokovic mental edge over Alcaraz\n\nGame, set and match. Tokito Oda has won the men’s wheelchair singles final, beating Great Britain’s Alfie Hewett 6-4, 6-2. The Japanese world No 1 was a class apart and, at the age of 17 years and 69 days, he is the youngest player to win any Wimbledon singles title (excluding juniors) since 1997.\n\nHe says: “I’m still 17, I want to open the champagne but I can’t. I’ll have to drink sparkling water.”\n\nDavid Brown: Princess Charlotte is attending Wimbledon for the first time along with her brother, Prince George, and the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nCharlotte, eight, was introduced to ball boys and girls as the family arrived at Centre Court. She walked alongside George, nine, who attended the final last year. Prince Louis, five, is not attending.\n\nThe Princess of Wales told one ball girl: “We have been watching you eagerly on television, Charlotte and George.” Kate said later: “Louis is very upset he is not coming.”\n\nThe royal family will be joined by Felipe VI of Spain, who is hoping to see Carlos Alcaraz, 20, herald a changing of the guard in the men’s game by preventing Novac Djokovic equal Roger Federer’s eight Wimbledon titles\n\nOther guests include Liz Frazer, the culture secretary, and Tim Davie, chairman director-general of the BBC, who is taking a break from the scandal surrounding presenter Huw Edwards.\n\nActors Daniel Craig and his wife, Rachel Weisz, and James Norton will also be in the royal box along with Rachael Blackmore, the jockey. Guests in hospitality included actors Lily James, Emma Watson, and Ncuti Gatwa and singers Ariana Grande and Stormzy.\n\nTokito Oda has meanwhile broken Alfie Hewett in the second set of the men’s wheelchair singles final.\n\nAlfie Hewett got almost a dream start to this match, but Tokito Oda found his stride and fought back well and has taken the first set 6-4. The pair are so competitive and well-matched in talent that this match promises to be nail-bitingly close.\n\nNo 1 Court is surprisingly empty for this match — and the thousands filling the grounds are missing out on a great battle of the top two men’s wheelchair players. In the crowd are Japanese fans as well as plenty of Hewett supporters, but the court is sparsely filled.\n\nBritain’s Alfie Hewett, 25, is bidding for his first wheelchair singles title at Wimbledon after winning the doubles title yesterday. He has seven grand-slam singles titles to his name from Australia, France and the USA, plus 18 doubles grand-slam titles. Can he add Wimbledon to his list of singles victories and complete his set today?\n\nHe will face Tokito Oda, the 17-year-old world number one from Japan. It’s the third grand-slam final in which the pair have met so far this year. Hewett won in Melbourne and Oda won at the Roland-Garros, so today’s match is the tie-breaker for the pair.\n\nJust yesterday, Hewett and Gordon Reid beat Oda and Takuya Miki to the doubles title in a thrilling final, winning 3-6, 6-0, 6-3.\n\nIt’s a revenge match, a tie-breaker, and there’s just the small matter of a Wimbledon title. Here we go!\n\nIt is a truth universally acknowledged that we admire those at the height of their profession but we don’t always like them. Novak Djokovic is an extreme example of this.\n\nMuch of the world — and certainly the Centre Court at Wimbledon — struggles to warm to the 36-year-old Serb. Some of this is a visceral reaction to the warrior quality he seldom hides, especially in big matches — which can sometimes descend into cynical sarcasm, as seen during his semi-final win against Jannik Sinner on Friday. Others are irritated by his stance as a Covid-19 vaccine refusenik.\n\nBut a look at Djokovic’s life makes two things clear: he is consistent, and he is understandable.\n\n● Read the full article: Why can’t Novak Djokovic win over the Wimbledon crowd?\n\nThe defending Wimbledon champion vs the tournament’s top seed – isn’t it the men’s final everyone wanted? At 2pm, Novak Djokovic will take to Centre Court with the chance to win his eighth Wimbledon title, equalling Roger Federer’s tally, and his 24th major, equalling Margaret Court’s record. Djokovic, 36, is on a streak of 45 wins on Centre Court, a run stretching back to 2013, and if he makes that 46 wins today he will also equal Federer’s and Bjorn Borg’s record of five successive Wimbledon wins.\n\nHe faces Carlos Alcaraz, who at 20-years-old is 14 years younger than his opponent today and in his first Wimbledon final. The top seed is playing in only his fourth professional tournament on grass.\n\nHe has faced Djokovic in a major once before, in the French Open semi-finals last month, which Djokovic won 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1. In the third set the Spaniard got cramps, which he said was due to the pressure of facing Djokovic.\n\nSo can he beat those nerves today?\n\n“I will try to get into the court with not as much nerves. I’ll do something different,” Alcaraz said. “I will prepare [for] the match a little bit different from French Open. It’s going to be different for me. I hope not to get cramp during the final.\n\n“Physically, I’ll do the same [thing] that I was doing before the matches. Probably in the mental part I will do something different to stay calm. I’ll do some exercise to stay calm and to forget – or I’ll try to forget that I’m going to play a final against Novak.”\n\nThe winner of today’s match will wake up tomorrow as the world number one and the pair have battled for that the top position all season. It promises to be an exciting finale to the men’s tournament.\n\nSo in the words of Djokovic: “He’s hungry. I’m hungry, too, so let’s have a feast.”"
