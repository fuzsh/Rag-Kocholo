        "text": "BASEBALL\n\nCal Abrams - Outfielder, played 1949-56. Lifetime .269 hitter. Abrams broke in\n\nwith the Brooklyn Dodgers and played for Brooklyn for his first three seasons.\n\nHe attracted a lot of attention as a Jewish, \"Boy of Summer\". Abrams retired to\n\nFlorida and was frequently seen at Jewish Federation events wearing his Dodger\n\nuniform and signing autographs. He died in 1997.\n\nMel Allen - Hall of Fame announcer.\n\nLloyd Allen - Relief pitcher, played from 1969-75. Played for the Angels,\n\nTexas, White Sox.\n\nRuben Amaro, Jr. - Major league outfielder from 1991-98. His father is Reuben\n\nAmaro, Sr., former major leaguer (not Jewish) and his mother is Jewish. Amaro,\n\nJr. is now asst. general mgr. of the Phillies. Amaro, Jr. played for the\n\nIndians, Phillies, and Angels. Career stats and picture on following link.\n\nAmaro\n\nMorrie Arnovitch - Outfielder with the Phillies (1936-41; 1946; with short\n\nstays with the Reds and Giants). Hit .324 in 1939.\n\nBrad Ausmus - ACTIVE PLAYER. Currently (2001) a catcher for the Houston\n\nAstros.Formerly with Detroit. Ausmus's mother is Jewish. According to an\n\ninterview, relayed by a site visitor, he is now \"exploring his Jewish roots\".\n\nBut this may only have been a polite comment to the press. It is pretty clear\n\nhe does not identify much as Jewish. But we will note that Ausmus showed real\n\nclass in a 1999 ABC interview when he spoke about his ex-roommate, former\n\nballplayer Billy Bean, who is not Jewish, but recently came out of the \"gay\n\ncloset\". Ausmus showed the same spirit of tolerance that Hank Greenberg showed\n\nto Jackie Robinson. Official Astro Bio\n\nJesse Baker - This guy is a footnote since he only was up for one year--he was\n\na short stop for the Washington Senators in 1919. But his real name was Michael\n\nMyron Silverman. In 1919, playing under his real name would have been almost\n\nimpossible.\n\nBrian Bark - Pitcher who had a \"cup of coffee\" with the Red Sox in 1995. (He\n\nwas up for a very short time.)\n\nRoss Baumgarten - Pitcher, Chicago White Sox and Pittsburgh Pirates (1978-82).\n\nGrew up in suburban Chicago.\n\nJose Bautista - Pitcher from the Dominican Republic. Mother, Jewish. Bautista\n\nwas with a variety of clubs from 1988 though 1997. He may still be in the Mets'\n\nfarm system. A Jewhoo visitor told us that Bautista is a nice guy, an observant\n\nJew who tries to keep the Sabbath, and that Bautista gave the visitor a\n\nbaseball with a Mogen David.\n\nBo Belinsky - Major League pitcher in the 1960's. His best years were with the\n\nAngels. He was a pretty talented pitcher, but he best known during his heyday\n\nas a \"wildman\" who dated Hollywood starlets. Pitched a no-hitter in 1962.\n\nMother, Jewish. Father, not. Update: We have been reliably informed that\n\nBelinsky's mother converted to Catholicism at the time of her marriage and that\n\nBelinsky was raised Catholic.\n\nMoe Berg - Good field; \"no hit\" catcher for the Boston Red Sox, others. But his\n\noff field exploits and personal quirks have made him the subject of many\n\narticles and at least two books. Berg spoke a dozen languages and read half a\n\ndozen newspapers a day. The US government recruited him to take secret films of\n\nTokyo before WWII while he was on a pro baseball tour of Japan. The films were\n\nused during WWII as guides for bombing targets. During WWII, Berg served in the\n\nOSS (the forerunner of the CIA) and was assigned to to kill Werner Heisenberg,\n\nthe head of the Germans' atomic research program, if he concluded that the\n\nGermans were took close to getting THE bomb. Berg attended a wartime lecture of\n\nHeisenberg's in neutral Switzerland and concluded that killing Heisenberg was\n\nnot necessary. Berg, tutored in atomic physics, was able to conclude from\n\nHeisenberg's lecture that the German program was not as advanced as the Allies\n\nfeared. There is a side exhibit at the Baseball Hall of Fame about Berg--he is\n\nsuch a \"wonderful footnote\" to baseball history. (Berg played from 1923-39;\n\nmostly with White Sox and Red Sox, also Senators, Cleveland, and Brooklyn.\n\nLifetime .243 hitter.)\n\nSkip Bertman - Head coach of the Lousiana State University baseball team. He\n\nlead the Tigers to five national championships in the 1990s. Bertman also\n\ncoached the 1996 US Bronze medal winning team at the Olympics. He has announced\n\nthat 2001 will be his last season. Bertham Annouces Retirement/Stats\n\nSeymour Block - Known as \"Cy\". Played second base for the Cubs in '42, '45-47.\n\nAppeared in one World Series. One of the outstanding rookies of 1942. He is the\n\nauthor of a book about his time with the Cubs. And he has a lovely\n\ngranddaughter and grandson-in-law who called our attention to him.\n\nRon Blomberg - Baseball's first \"designated hitter\". Played for the Yankees\n\nfrom 1969-76; one year for White Sox. Hit over .300 in two seasons. By the way,\n\nfor search engine users--\"Ron Bloomberg\" is not the correct spelling.\n\nBlomberg's full career stats are on the following link. Stats\n\nSam Bohne - Born Samuel Arthur Cohen. Played shortstop and second base for\n\nCincinnati from 1921 to 1926 (612 games), with a brief stop in St. Louis in\n\n1916 and a final tour with Brooklyn in 1926. Lifetime batting average .261\n\nLou Boudreau - Shortshop with a good batting eye who played for the Cleveland\n\nIndians from 1938 to 1952. Father, not Jewish. Mother, Jewish. Lifetime, .295.\n\nHit over .300 four times. In Baseball Hall of Fame. Boudreau's parents divorced\n\nwhen he was very young and he was raised by his father. His ties to anything\n\nJewish were minimal and it was not known--until long after he retired--that his\n\nmother was Jewish.\n\nRod Carew - This great Panama born baseball player was long rumored to have\n\nconverted to Judaism following his marriage to a Jewish woman. He recently\n\nconfirmed he never converted in an interview with Minnesota-based American\n\nJewish World. A pity; not many great Jewish and Black players. His children\n\nhave been raised Jewish. Adam Sandler simply got it wrong in his Hannukah song.\n\nRon Cey - Former LA Dodger Star. His wife is Jewish and his children were\n\nraised Jewish, including current minor leaguer Danny Cey. Jhoo has received, to\n\nput it mildly, conflicting reports whether Ron has actually converted. Update:\n\nWe have received definitive information that Ron Cey never converted. Danny Cey\n\nunexpectedly decided to retire in 2000.\n\nFrank Charles - ACTIVE PLAYER. Currently playing Triple A ball with the Houston\n\nAstros' New Orleans farm club. His mother is Jewish, his father is not. UPDATE:\n\nFrank Charles just broke into the bigs. He was called up to the Astros line-up\n\nat the beginning of September, 2000. He is listed on the roster as a\n\ncatcher.//Charles is back in the minors again at the beginning of 2001. He\n\nplayed four games with the Astros in September, 2000.\n\nAl Clark - Active major league umpire. In an amusing sidelight, Shawn Green\n\nrecently told an LA magazine that he came up to bat, in 1999, when Clark was\n\numpiring and Jesse Levis was catching. They all laughed; said, \"Hi, yids\"; and\n\nsince it was near the Jewish New Year-- wished each other a happy new year.\n\nTony Cogan - ACTIVE PLAYER Cogan, a left-handed pitcher, broke into the Kansas\n\nCity Royals roster at the start of the 2001 season. He played college ball with\n\nStanford and pitched in two college world series games. He only spent one year\n\nin the minors and racked up impressive numbers. Cogan graduated from Highland\n\nPark High School (Illinois) and we are reliably informed that his bar mitzvah\n\nwas held at Temple Am Sholom. A biography with stats are on the following link.\n\nStats\n\nAndy Cohen - NY Giants player, 1926-29.\n\nSydney Cohen - Brother of Andy Cohen. Pitcher. 1934; '36-37. All years were\n\nwith the Washington Senators. He was 3-7 lifetime with a 4.54 ERA.\n\nJason Robert Crews - Graduated from Appalachian State Univ. He was named\n\nOrganizational Pitcher of the Month for June 1999 w/ the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nHe played this past 1999 Baseball Season for the Arizona Diamondbacks AA El\n\nPaso Diablos Baseball team.\n\nHarry Danning - New York Giants Catcher, 1933-42. Lifetime .285 hitter. His\n\nbrother Ike played 2 games for the St. Louis Browns (1928). Nickname was \"Harry\n\nthe Horse\". He was on the all-star team between 1938-40. Once hit for the cycle\n\n(single, double, triple, hr. in one game).\n\nBarney Dreyfuss - Owner of Pittsburgh Pirates, credited with organizing the\n\nfirst World Series.\n\nTiby Eisen - Outfielder in the \"All American Girls Professional Baseball\n\nLeague\", which was portrayed in the excellent film, \"A League of Our Own\". She\n\nplayed for four teams in the Midwest btw. '44-52. She made the league all-star\n\nteam in '46. Grew up in an Orthodox home.\n\nHarry Eisenstat - Pitcher for Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians between 1935\n\nand 1942. He was the winning pitcher for the Tigers in game which Indians'\n\ngreat Bob Feller pitched a no-hitter, but did not win.\n\nMike Epstein - Played first base from 1966-74, mostly for the (old) Washington\n\nSenators and the Oakland A's. Epstein was a lifetime .244 hitter, but did hit\n\n130 home runs. His best season was 1969, when he hit .274, with 30 home runs. A\n\nJhoo visitor tells us he saw the A's play shortly after the 1972 Munich killing\n\nof Israeli athletes. Three players wore a black mourning armband: Epstein, Ken\n\nHoltzman, and Reggie Jackson. Reggie was always a class act.\n\nJon Farber - Farber was a member of the Rochester, NY team which took second in\n\nthe tournament (World Series) to determine the champion of the 13 year old Babe\n\nRuth League. Farber's team finished second in the tournament. Farber was named\n\nall-tournament left fielder.\n\nDonald Fehr - Executive director of and counsel to the Major League Baseball\n\nPlayers' Association.\n\nAugust Foreman - Better known as \"Happy\" Foreman. Pitcher. 1924; 1926. Pitched\n\na total of 8 games with White Sox and Red Sox. Decent stats; no wins or losses.\n\nMicah Franklin - ACTIVE PLAYER Outfielder who was briefly up in 1997 with the\n\nCardinals (17 games; hit over .300).His mother is Jewish, his father is not. In\n\n1999, he played in Japan for the \"Nippon Ham Fighters\" (!) (What does the team\n\ndo in its spare time, try and make Japan kosher? )In 2000, he was injured at\n\nthe beginning of the season and came back to America. We have heard that he is\n\ntrying to get on an American team roster. There is an interesting profile of\n\nFranklin in the following article from the No.Cal Jewish bulletin. \"Ham\n\nFighting Man\"\n\nMurray Franklin - Shortstop for the Detroit Tigers, 1941-42.\n\nHowie Gershberg - Minor league shortstop w/the NY Giants and minor league\n\npitcher with the Dodgers (1950's). Pitching coach St. John's Univ. (1980s).\n\nPitching coach Anaheim Angels (1987-present).\n\nDennis Gilbert - Ex-super agent who had the biggest stable of players in the\n\ngame. Jose Canseco, Barry Bonds,and Mike Piazza were but a few of his major\n\nclients.\n\nJoe Ginsberg - Catcher from 1948 to 1962 for a variety of clubs (Detroit,\n\nCleveland, KC, Baltimore, Chicago, Boston and Giants). Most active years 1951\n\nand 1962, when he played 102 and 113 games, respectively. Most other seasons he\n\nwas his team's back-up catcher. Lifetime average .241. \"Joe\" was his nickname.\n\nHis full name was Myron Nathan Ginsberg. Ginsberg was known as a clubhouse\n\ncomedian according to one web based biography we saw. He also holds two\n\n\"footnote\" records. He broke up Yankee Vic Raschi's near bid for a no-hitter in\n\n1952 and he was the first catcher to catch a game for the Mets. He caught two\n\ngames for the Mets in the Mets (inaugural) 1962 season.\n\nKeith Glauber - ACTIVE PLAYER Reds right-handed pitcher who broke in the 1999\n\nseason, but was sent back to the minors in 2000. UPDATE: Glauber was called\n\nback to the Reds roster as of 9/6/00.//He is back in the minors at the start of\n\nthe 2001 season.\n\nAl Goldis - Scouting co-coordinator for the Reds. He was a minor league\n\noutfielder with the Reds in the 1960's.\n\nJonah Goldman - (1906-1980). Shortstop for Cleveland 1928, 1930 and 1931. Was\n\nin 111 games in 1930, had 44 RBIs and hit .242. Lifetime average .224.\n\nGreg Goosen - Played for Mets (4yrs) and Seattle Pilots/Milwaukee Brewers\n\n(2yrs). Catcher and first baseman. Lifetime .241 hitter. Father, Jewish.\n\nMother, not.\n\nSid Gordon - Played in the majors from 1941 to 1955 for the Giants, Braves and\n\nothers. He hit 202 homers while hitting .283. He struck out rarely. His ratio\n\nof bbs to ks was 731/356. He was a .985 fielder. Sid was so popular in his\n\nnative Brooklyn that he was given a \"Sid Gordon\" day in the Brooklyn Dodgers\n\nstadium, Ebbets Field!\n\nShawn Green - ACTIVE PLAYER The best Jewish ballplayer of this generation and\n\nalready he has to be ranked among the best of all-time. In 1999, he accepted a\n\n$84 million dollar contract with the LA Dodgers. With Toronto, in 1999, he hit\n\n.309, 42hrs, 123 RBI's. In 2000, he had a disapointing season--especially the\n\nsecond half when his production tailed off. But he played every game and hit\n\n.269 with 24 home runs and 99 runs driven in. He has associated himself with\n\nseveral Jewish charities including, \"Jewish Big Brothers\" and a Jewish\n\ncommunity sponsored literacy program that sends volunteers into the LA public\n\nschools. The linked on-site profile was written before the 2000 season. Green\n\nProfile\n\nHank Greenberg - Hall of Fame slugger who played for the Detroit Tigers for all\n\nbut his last season. Greenberg played from 1933 to early in the 1941 season and\n\nfrom late in the season in 1945 to 1947. (The break in playing time was due to\n\nhis WWII army service.) He was a career .313 hitter and he had 7 seasons when\n\nhe drove in over 100 runs. His most famous year was 1938 when he hit 58 home\n\nruns and was a serious challenger for Ruth's record. (While Greenberg says he\n\nran out of \"gas\", he was subject to a lot of \"pitching around him\" so a Jew\n\nwould not break Babe Ruth's 60 home run record.) Greenberg was the subject of a\n\ncritically acclaimed documentary, \"The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg\"\n\n(1999). After retirement, Greenberg went on to be a part owner for a time. But\n\nhe and Bill Veeck (not Jewish) were the only former owners to testify on behalf\n\nof Curt Flood in the landmark suit to overturn the \"reserve clause\". (The only\n\nformer player to testify against Flood was Joe Gargiola. Who was also notorious\n\nas one of the worst verbal baiters of Jackie Robinson. The editor of this site\n\ncouldn't resist \"outing\" smiley Joe for the hypocrite he is.) See also: Aviva\n\nKempner (directors); George Moriarty (righteous gentiles). Following is a good\n\nrecent piece on Greenberg that makes most of the important points about him.\n\nGreenberg's career stats are on the second link. Add on: the last link is to\n\nthe official site for the film, \"The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg\". It is\n\ntruely \"Greenberg heaven\". Everything is there. Including the famous Edgar\n\nGuest poem about Greenberg. Hank Stats Film Site\n\nEric Helfand - Catcher who played for Oakland between 1993 and 1995. Not much\n\nof a hitter.\n\nKen Holtzman - Excellent left-handed pitcher who played for the Cubs, Oakland,\n\nand the Yankees (1965-1979). Like Koufax, Holtzman declined to pitch on the\n\nHigh Holy Days. Pitched two no-hitters. 4-1, in World Series. Twice named to\n\nthe All-Star team. Full stats and playing history on link. Stats\n\nJoel Horlen - 1961-72. Pitcher with the Chicago White Sox and the Oakland A's.\n\nHorlen won a total of 116 games and pitched one no-hitter. His best year was\n\n1967, he went 19-7 and lead the league in ERA (2.06). Horlen converted to\n\nJudaism following his marriage to a Jewish woman. According to a published\n\narticle, he told Mike Epstein about his conversion at an oldtimers' game. Mike\n\nsaid, \"Welcome to the tribe.\"\n\nDavid Jacobs - This is an \"amateur listing\" but an interesting one. Mr. Jacobs,\n\nthe son of Holocaust survivors, is a top baseball pitcher for the top\n\ninternational adult amateur baseball league. In 1999, his team won the league\n\nWorld Series and he pitched in one of the winning games. Former major league\n\npitcher, Bill Lee, is on his team. Mr. Jacobs is in the \"masters\" (over 50)\n\ndivision.\n\nGabe Kapler - ACTIVE PLAYER. Played outfield for Detroit in 1999, dealt to the\n\nTexas Rangers in 2000. His mother works at a Jewish pre-school. A good\n\nballplayer who shows real potential to fill in the gaps in the all-star Jewish\n\nteam lists. Kapler had a good season in 2000, hitting .302 with 14 home runs.\n\nHe really seems to be coming into his own. The following link gives his basic\n\nbio and stats; it will update as the 2001 season progresses. (He was on the\n\ndisabled list as of the start of the 2001 season. His game statistics will seem\n\n\"light\" until well into the season). Here's a Jewish sidelight on Kapler that\n\nwas recently reported in Jewish community newspaper, the NY Jewish Press. It\n\nhas some relevance in light of the recent widely-publicized Charlie Ward\n\nincident with the Knicks. We will leave the name of the other player out since\n\nhe \"has reformed\". A former NY Yankees centerfielder had a reputation of\n\nhectoring NY Jewish sportswriters that they \"might go to hell--if they didn't\n\nconvert.\" He was traded to the Rangers and he tried to \"convert\" Gabe Kapler.\n\nKapler, it is reported, experienced some minor anti-Semitic incidents while in\n\nthe minors and he had shrugged them off. However, he decided to confront this\n\noutfielder head-on. Kapler figured he needed some religious heavyweights to\n\nhelp him discuss religion in an informed way. Therefore, he invited the player,\n\na rabbi, and his agent (who is a religious Orthodox Jew) to a restaurant. The\n\nother player said that he came away with a \"revelation\" that he shouldn't\n\npreach the way he had been preaching at Jews and stopped pursuing Kapler.\n\nKapler said he came away with a better knowledge of Judaism. Kapler\n\nStan Kasten - President of the Atlanta Braves organization.\n\nSandy Koufax - What can we say? Koufax holds a place so deep in the hearts of\n\nJewish baseball fans that words are not enough. In our humble opinion, he\n\nnarrowly edges at Hank Greenberg as the greatest Jewish baseball player ever\n\n(there is no one even close to third place in such a race). Sandy was born in\n\nBrooklyn and started as a \"bonus baby\" with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He showed\n\nflashes of greatness until he came into his own in 1962. Like a lot of southpaw\n\nfastball pitchers, it took him time to gain control over his pitches. Simply\n\nput, from 1962 to 1966 he was the dominant pitcher in the major leagues. He\n\npitched four no-hitters. He was the MVP in 1963 and 1965. There are more stats\n\nlike this on the second following link. Koufax, as most people know, declined\n\nto pitch in a 1965 World Series game that fell on Yom Kippur. This fact has\n\nadded to the \"reverence\" Jewish fans feel for him. Needless to say, Koufax was\n\na Hall of Fame first ballot selection. Two fun facts: Tommy LaSorda was sent to\n\nminors to make room for him on the roster and he was on the same Brooklyn\n\nbasketball teams as Mets' co-owner Fred Wilpon. On the first link is an article\n\nthat analyzes, with Talmudic-like scholarship, Koufax's record of pitching on\n\nJewish holidays. It's fun, in a strange sort of way. Koufax/Holidays Koufax\n\nStats\n\nBarry Latman - Born Arnold Barry Latman. Pitched for White Sox, Indians,\n\nAngels, and Astros. (57-67). Journeyman pitcher, best season: 13-5. He was a\n\ngraduate of Fairfax High School, Los Angeles. In the '59 series, he played\n\nagainst his fellow Jewish Fairfax graduates--Larry and Norm Sherry.\n\nAl Levine - ACTIVE PLAYER. After years of struggling in the minors, Levine\n\nbroke into the Angels roster in the 1999 season and has established himself as\n\na pretty good middle reliever. Stats on link. They update as the season goes\n\non. Stats\n\nJesse Levis - ACTIVE PLAYER Catcher with the Brewers, Milwaukee, and Tampa Bay.\n\nLevis broke into the majors in 1992. Levis spent the 2000 season with AAA\n\nBuffalo recuperating from an injury. He is a a career .256 hitter. Levis is a\n\ngood catcher, he committed only 5 errors during his 8 years behind the plate.\n\nHe hit .333 in 1995, .285 in 1997, and .351 in 1998. The question is whether he\n\nwill make it up to the bigs again on a regular basis.\n\nMarvin Lieb - Marvin Lieb was recruited by Branch Rickey to play on the 1948\n\nBrooklyn Dodgers. He was a first baseman. His career was cut very short by an\n\ninjury. He was depicted on the cover of Life magazine on April 5, 1948 in a\n\nstory about Dodger Rookies. Marvin died in FL on 2/5/00.\n\nMike Lieberthal - ACTIVE PLAYER Current Phillies catcher. His father is Jewish;\n\nbut he was not raised Jewish. He is unquestionably a talented player with good\n\npower and a strong throwing arm. He made the all-star team in 2000. (We just\n\nwish he was \"more\" Jewish). Profile and stats on link. They will update as the\n\nseason progresses. Stats\n\nLou Limmer - First baseman for the old Philadelphia A's. Played in the '50s.\n\nAndrew Lorraine - ACTIVE PLAYER Left-handed pitcher who has played for the\n\nAngels, Chicago, and ended up with Cleveland at the end of the 2000 season. His\n\ncareer stats to date have not been impressive. His father emigrated from\n\nEngland and Lorraine's uncle is an orthodox rabbi in England. The family's\n\noriginal name is Levin. His grandfather, who served in the British Army in\n\nAlsace-Lorraine, liked the name \"Lorraine\" and changed it.\n\nBob Lurie - Former owner of the SF Giants (now owned by a group headed up by\n\nPeter MacGowan, heir to the Safeway fortune). A very sweet guy who bought the\n\nteam to save them from re-location out of San Francisco. Always soft-spoken.\n\nElliott Maddox - African-American outfielder who played from 1970 to 1980. He\n\nplayed mostly for the Yankees and the Mets (3 seasons with each team). Two\n\nyears with the Rangers. Lifetime .26l hitter. Two .300 seasons with the\n\nYankees. Convert to Judaism.\n\nJason Marquis - ACTIVE PLAYER Pitcher out of Manhasset, LI (where he was a\n\nmember of the National Honor Society). Highly touted Braves' minor leaguer.\n\nReached Double A ball in 1999 at the age of 20. Throws the ball in the mid 90\n\nmph. range. Derailed by minor injuries in 1999, lets hope he comes back this\n\nseason. UPDATE: Marquis has made the bigs for the 2000 season. He is up with\n\nthe Atlanta Braves. Correction: He is from Staten Island, not Manhasset, Long\n\nIsland.//He is on the Braves roster as a relief pitcher at the start of the\n\n2001 season. Stats on link. They will update as the season progresses. Marquis\n\nMike Milchin - Milchin was a star pitcher with Clemson University. He was up in\n\nthe majors briefly in 1995 and 1996 with the Twins and the Orioles,\n\nrespectively (3 games total). Milchin was a member of the US Olympic team which\n\nwon a gold medal in the 1988 Olympics (baseball was a demonstration sport that\n\nyear). Milchin's father is Jewish, his mother is not Jewish.\n\nNorm Miller - Outfielder, Houston Astros,Atlanta Braves, 1965-74. Executive\n\nwith Mets and Astros. Casey Stengel once said, Norm Miller had the sweetest\n\nswing in baseball.\n\nMarvin Miller - We have long had Miller up in our lawyers category, but he\n\nreally should be cross-listed. Miller, a former lawyer for the Steelworkers'\n\nunion, became Executive Director of the baseball players' union when the\n\nassociation was a joke, and the prospects were dim. He got the players to stick\n\ntogether, got contract arbitration and got the arbitrator to throw out the\n\nreserve clause, which had held the players in servitude for a 100 yrs. He then\n\nout-lawyered the owners at every turn regarding free agency. Its an old story,\n\nif you stick together and have smart leadership, you sometimes get what you are\n\nworth in the market.\n\nBuddy Myer - Second baseman who played mostly for the Washington Senators\n\n(1925-41). Lifetime .303; nine .300 seasons.\n\nSam Nahem - A Brooklyn College star pitcher, he had a brief career in the\n\nmajors--pitching a limited number of games over four seasons ('38,\n\n41-42,'48)--with Brooklyn, Cardinals, Phillies. He was also a lawyer.\n\nBilly Nash - Played 1884-1898. Regular 3B. Mostly Boston, National League.\n\nLifetme batting avg. .275. Sources differ on whether Nash was Jewish.

He broke in with the Padres in 1999 and was up for a\n\nbrief time. Newhan again made the Padres in 2000, but was dealt to the Phillies\n\nin September, 2000 and played some games last September with Philly. His father\n\nis Los Angeles area sportswriter Ross Newhan. A baseball journalist was kind\n\nenough to share her source with us. Thanks. Official team biography, photo, and\n\nstats on the following link.

He was Babe Ruth's\n\nroommate. Reese has said this meant he usually roomed with Ruth's suitcase,\n\nbecause the Babe liked to \"party\". Reese played in the Pacific Coast League for\n\n12 seasons, sandwiched around his time with the Yankees and was a coach with\n\nthe Angels for decades after his retirement as a player. He is in the Angels'\n\nteam hall of fame.\n\nJerry Reinsdorf - Owner of the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Bulls.\n\nConsistently left off voters' lists for \"nice guy\" of the year and Michael\n\nJordan's gift lists.\n\nEd Reulbach - A great pitcher in the first two decades of the 20thc. Pitched\n\nmostly for the Cubs. Reulbach has long been listed as Jewish in most books\n\nabout famous Jews in sports, etc. However, recent research, as reported by\n\n\"Total Baseball\", states he is not Jewish (other notable \"assumed, but not\"\n\ninclude George Stone and Benny Kauff). If anyone out there has info that\n\ncontradicts/confirms this report--contact us. One person has--a gentleman named\n\nReulbach who is researching any biographical reference he can find to other\n\nReulbachs. He says he has never encountered a single Jewish person named\n\n\"Reulbach\" among all the Reulbachs he has researched. Final nail: A friend of\n\nEd Reulbach's family contacted us. He was Catholic and went to Notre Dame.\n\nDave Roberts - Pitched for Padres, Astros, Tigers, Cubs, Mets, Seattle. Best\n\nseason 17-11; 103 lifetime wins w/some weak teams. Father, Jewish.

Also in Canadian\n\nBaseball HOF.\n\nAl Rosen - 1953 American League MVP (by unanimous vote). Cleveland Indians.\n\nGeneral Manager of SF Giants in the 80's and early '90's. Rosen hit over .300\n\nin 3 seasons. Came w/ in less than a percentage pt. of winning battle title in\n\n'53, had he done so, he would have won the triple crown. Nickname \"Flip\" from\n\nthe way he pitched softball. Was a college boxing champ, and used these skills\n\ndealing with some anti-semites in baseball.\n\nSteven Rosenberg - Pitcher who was with the White Sox btw. 1988-91; part of his\n\nlast season with San Diego.\n\nHarry Rosenberg - Harry played 9 games for the NY Giants in 1930.

Mickey\n\ncouldn't stay up because the A's had a first class third baseman already. He\n\nasked manager/owner Connie Mack to trade him. Mack said he couldn't do that\n\nbecause it would come back to haunt the A's--Rutner was too good. Rutner asked\n\nHank Greenberg to speak to Mack--Greenberg said it was hopeless--Mack wouldn't\n\nlift a finger to help a Jew.\n\nAl Schacht - Had a short career as a pitcher with the Washington Senators\n\n(1919-21).

We will update him on\n\n2001 soon. There is a great journal piece on the web by Stein that he wrote in\n\n2000. We usually don't quote this long an excerpt, but Stein has written very\n\neloquently about issues that often face Jews in professional sports and in\n\nother places where they are a small minority. Specifically, the awkward and\n\nsometimes offensive attempts to \"evangelize\" Jews and the assumption that\n\neveryone is a Christian and should be happy to be to be part of a \"captive\n\naudience\" for Christian preaching. Stein writes in his 2000 journal, \"There was\n\nsomething that occurred two nights later that several of my teammates and I did\n\nnot appreciate, though. That was a prayer on the field just before our game was\n\nslated to begin. It was in honor of it being National Prayer Day. A preacher\n\nspoke into his microphone about Jesus, before telling all in attendance, both\n\nplayers and fans, to repeat after him the Lord's Prayer. The prayer ended with\n\nhim yelling, as if at a revival, \"in JESUS' name we pray! Amen!\" As I've\n\nwritten before, I am Jewish. I have gotten used to Christians coming up to me\n\nin private and attempting to give me their testimonies. In all honesty, that is\n\nold hat, as it has happened to me fairly regularly since high school. But it\n\nhas never bothered me. I have always felt that since these were private\n\nmatters, I could always just turn my back and walk away. This prayer on the\n\nfield was different. We players had to be out there. We couldn't just turn and\n\nwalk away. Religion, essentially, was forced upon us. I don't believe that this\n\nwas right. I have no problem with people being religious. I am very religious,\n\nas I feel that I have a good relationship with God. But religion should be a\n\npersonal thing. Let people live the way they want to live. Don't try to cram\n\nthings down their throats. That is what happened here. Besides, I am sure that\n\nthere had to be some non-Christians in the stands. I wonder how they felt about\n\nit. I know that the three Jews on the Blue Rocks found the entire thing\n\ninconsiderate and bordering on offensive. As a result, to even things up, so to\n\nspeak, we are attempting to bring a rabbi to a game next week.

Von\n\nTilzer wrote the music. Jack Norworth, whom we are pretty sure was not Jewish,\n\nwrote the lyrics. Neither fellow had seen a pro game when they wrote the song\n\nin 1908.

Cuban was born into a fairly poor family in Pittsburgh.\n\nHis company pioneered the technology of bringing audio and video over the\n\ninternet. Yahoo bought him out and he was left with a bundle (as were a large\n\nnumber of employees). Some people like his \"hands-on\" ownership style and some\n\npeople don't. Frankly, he seems to act like a lot of relatively sophisticated\n\nfans would act like if they had the money to buy an NBA franchise. Sometimes\n\nthey would be jerks; and sometimes they would show some smarts. In any event,\n\nCuban is a lot more fun to argue about than some faceless corporate owner. Too\n\nbad we all cannot afford to indulge our fantasies. He will probably calm down\n\nin time.

He was all set to go to the University\n\nof Maryland. However, he declined to go there because it became apparent that\n\nthe University could not easily honor his need not to play or practice on the\n\nSabbath. He went, instead, to Towson State, Maryland. Unfortunately, it does\n\nnot appear that his early promise will be fulfilled. He only grew to 6'3 and he\n\ncertainly has not been a dominant player in college ball. It doesn't look like\n\nwe will see a guy wearing a yalmulke in the NBA.

Possibly most prolific fighter of all\n\ntime. Reputed to have fought some 1,309 bouts.\n\nKeith Holmes - Current world middleweight champion. This entry is for\n\ninformational purposes only. Holmes is a member of a \"black Hebrew\" group. As\n\nnoted elsewhere, there are many African-Americans, and other peoples of\n\n\"color\", who are Jews and accepted as such by all other Jews. However, Holmes'\n\ngroup is not accepted as Jewish by any mainstream Jewish group and, in fact,\n\ncontains strong elements of Christianity. A small number of the group Holmes is\n\nassociated with settled in Israel in 1969. (They came on tourist visas and\n\nstayed) To make a long story short, a confusing and politically charged\n\nsituation was finally resolved by allowing them to stay as temporary permanent\n\nresidents. After 30 years they have become part of the mosaic of Israeli\n\nsociety. Only time will tell whether they will formally join mainstream Judaism\n\nthrough conversion or assimilation. The links take you to a quasi-official\n\nstatement on the history of the group and an article on Holmes in the Jewish\n\npress. (Addition--to end the same questions--based on what we know--which isn't\n\ncomplete--welterweight champ Zab Judah also appears to belong to a group that\n\ncalls itself Jewish, but whose theology is not recognizably Jewish by even the\n\nmost \"liberal\" standards. We take a very liberal view on Jewhoo on listing\n\npeople. If they have a Jewish parent we usually list them. If they have a\n\nJewish grandparent and practice Judaism, we list them. We do try to tell the\n\nvisitor how the person identifies. However, with all due respect to Zab Judah,\n\na great fighter, we have to draw some lines. And one of those lines is that we\n\nunequivocally maintain that someone is not Jewish, by religion, if that person\n\npractices a religion (whatever it is called) that includes strong elements of\n\nChristianity. Granted, Jewhoo does list some persons who do practice\n\nChristianity. However, these persons have an \"ethnically\" Jewish parent.\n\nListing persons with one Jewish parent who practice Christianity was a\n\ndifficult editorial decision. It is based on the odd status of \"Jewishness\" as\n\nboth a religion and an ethnicity. If Zab Judah practiced something recognized\n\nas mainstream Jewish practice, we would give him an entry. If he was\n\n\"ethnically\" Jewish, i.e., if he had a parent who was generally accepted as\n\nJewish by most Jews,--again we would list him. However, he does not appear to\n\nfall into either of these categories. If anyone has information on Judah that\n\ncontradicts what we have gathered from several sources--please inform us right\n\naway. Thank you.)

He is the real-life model for Robert Cohn, the\n\nPrinceton boxing champion in Hemingway's \"The Sun Also Rises\". In the book,\n\nCohn is criticized for fighting for \"the wrong reason\". The right reason being\n\nthe joy of athletic competition or some other mystical Hemingway macho stuff.\n\nThe real Robert Cohn never made it to Paris and, in later years, hardly anyone\n\nremembered him from his Princeton days. He was a quiet young man who didn't\n\nwant to have to take an insult from anyone. Therefore, he studied boxing and\n\nbecame Princeton middleweight champ in the 1920's.

After his retirement in 1925 he\n\nreturned to the ring in 1931 and won 18 out of his next 19 fights (1 draw)\n\nuntil he was knocked out by Jimmy McLarnin October 7, 1932.

A long\n\ncount might have saved Robinson. Robinson managed to rebound and knock out\n\nLevine in the 10th round, but he never could remember the fight after the 5th\n\nround. It has been claimed that Robinson said no one ever hit him harder than\n\nLevine did in the 5th round of that fight. Levine never got a title shot.

World Welterweight Champ, 1915-16;\n\n1917-1919. Born Gershon Mendelhoff in England. Tough, hard-hitting fighter from\n\nLondon's East End. Held many British and European titles. Lifetime: 170-30-14.\n\nThere is an interesting story about Lewis on the following link. But it is too\n\ngood not to share the heart of it here--even though the excerpt is a little\n\nlonger than we normally use. In 1929, Lewis accepted a position as a bodyguard\n\nand physical trainer for British politician Oswald Mosley and his \"New Party\".\n\nMosley's party began as a \"populist\", but anti-Communist party that was\n\nnon-racist. However, by 1932, Mosley became a follower of anti-Semitic fascism.\n\nLewis came to Mosley to find out if the rumors of Mosley adopting anti-Semitism\n\nwere true. Mosley said that they they were true and outlined his plans to Lewis\n\n(TK). The account reads: \"Mosley almost smiled at TK's naivety. 'Yes' [He was\n\nanti-Jewish]. Then he rose from his chair and told TK in measured tones ...his\n\nfull plans and began to explain there aims. TK's face was dead white. Boxing\n\nfans who had seen him fight would have intrepreted the danger signs. ...Mosley\n\nkept on talking and then eyed TK as if to gauge the effect of his words on TK.\n\nUntil then TK had not moved. Then, like lightning, he struck with an open hand\n\nacross Mosley's face, sending him and his chair crashing against the wall. The\n\ntwo brown-shirted men came round the desk and grappled with TK. He ducked under\n\nthe man's arms and shot a short right hand to his jaw, sending him to the\n\nfloor, out to the world. ...TK hit him (the second man) with a left hook and\n\ndropped to the floor like a sack of potatoes. ...TK took my hand and we walked\n\ndown the stairs past the two guards at the front door. About twenty yards up\n\nthe street, TK told me to wait a minute. ...he walked back to the entrance,\n\nmounted the steps and postitioned himself between the two guards. He eyed them\n\nfor two or three seconds, and then, like lightning, swung a left hook at one,\n\nspun around with a right hook to the other, and calmly stepped over both. He\n\nwalked down the steps and joined me, grinning from ear to ear.\" Postscript:\n\nOswald Mosley was jailed as a security risk during WWII and spent the war in\n\njail. His union of British Fascists never acquired much of a following. But, he\n\ndoes show up in a number of historical/literary references because he was\n\nmarried to one of the famous Mitford sisters. Two were fascists; one was a\n\ncommunist for a time (Jessica); and the fourth--novelist Nancy, mostly steered\n\nclear of extreme politics.

He was thereafter derogatorily referred to as the\n\n\"cheese champion\" for being a light hitter who lucked into the championship,\n\nand for fighting many No Decision bouts (like most fighters of the day).\n\nActually, he may have fought as many as 137 fights before losing for the first\n\ntime in 1917 in a championship fight with Mike O'Dowd. Not too shabby, cheesy\n\nor no.\n\nDaniel Mendoza - Sephardic Jew who became a famous boxing champion of England\n\nin the 18th Century. He did for English Jews what Jackie Robinson did for\n\nAfrican-Americans two centuries later. Mendoza gave them pride in a champion\n\nwho represented his people. Mendoza is credited with introducing \"scientific\n\nboxing\" to the sport (called, believe it or not, \"the Jewish School of Boxing\",\n\nduring this period). A Mendoza descendant was actor Peter Sellers. Sellers'\n\nmother, whose name was Mendoza, was Jewish. Sellers's son wrote that Peter was\n\nsomewhat fascinated by his ancestor and by the \"yellowing\" prints of the\n\nchampion that had been passed down in the Mendoza family. Sellers and his\n\nancestor, his son wrote, bore a striking physical resemblance to one and other.\n\nThere is a short biography of Mendoza on the following link. Mendoza\n\nM.

Center, 1920-1927\n\nprofessional, NY Giants '25-' 27, 1937 was named all-time All-American at guard\n\nby New York World Telegram. Full biography with all career highlights at\n\nfollowing link. Alexander is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAlexander\n\nLyle Alzado - Alzado was a defensive tackle and end who played for the Broncos,\n\nCleveland Browns, and Raiders (Oakland and LA). He played from 1971 to 1985 and\n\nwas all pro several times. He died in 1992. He attributed his death, from\n\ncancer, to the anabolic steroids he started taking in 1969 to build up his\n\nmuscle mass. Alzado's father was Puerto Rican and not Jewish. His mother was\n\nJewish and he was bar mitzvah. A visitor pointed us to a site that has a\n\npicture of Alzado's grave. There is a cross on the headstone. We do not know if\n\nthis cross reflected Alzado's beliefs at the time of his death or it something\n\nhis widow decided to do without his prior approval. Editor's note: you will\n\nread varying stories on Alzado's religious background. We have our information\n\nfrom an impeccable source. Interesting article on Alzado on following link.\n\nAlzado\n\nHarris Barton - Now retired former all-Pro Offensive Lineman for the San\n\nFrancisco 49'ers. For obvious reasons, did not participate in pre-game prayer\n\nwarm-ups of some other players.\n\nMitch Berger - Punter for the Minnesota Vikings. I'm not sure about him, but he\n\nwas mentioned in an article that was critical of on-field religious displays,\n\nlike having all the players gather after the game for a prayer cirlce. The\n\nwriter asked how Willie Green felt about this, being a Muslim, and then Mr.\n\nBerger, being Jewish. Worth checking on. And he's a hell of a punter too! (Ed.\n\nNote: We are posting this entry unedited. If anyone knows for sure on Berger,\n\ncontact us) UPDATE: WE have got definite information that he is NOT Jewish.\n\nSorry, sports fans.\n\nAlex Bernstein - Lineman for the NY Jets last season, cut. Picked-up by Browns\n\nand just cut. Looking to be picked-up again.\n\nArt Bluethenthal - (1891-1918) Princeton center. All-Amer. 1911-1912. After\n\ngraduation became coach.

Joined French\n\nForeign Legion Air, was killed, awarded 2nd Croix de Guerre (but with palm).\n\nNorman Brama - Former owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. He owned the team from\n\n1984 to 1994. He was not loved, to say the least. Known for his tight-fisted\n\nstyle. But no one ever loses on an NFL franchise and he sold the team for\n\nalmost three times what the paid for it. His wealth principally comes from\n\nFlorida car dealerships.\n\nNorman Braman - Owner of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1985 to 1993. Leader and\n\ncontributor to the Miami Jewish Community.\n\nNoah Cantor - Defensive Tackle for the British Columbia Lions in the Canadian\n\nFootball League.\n\nAl Davis - Former coach who became the owner of the Oakland Raiders. Moved them\n\nto Los Angeles and back to Oakland. The editor of this site lives in the Bay\n\nArea and was not happy when the Raiders moved. But, Al Davis is clearly one of\n\nthe greatest figures in the history of football and deserves his place in the\n\nFootball Hall of Fame. He hired players and coaches on the basis of ability.\n\nNot race or ethnicity. He didn't talk, he acted. He put black players into\n\ncertain positions years ahead of other owners. He hired black and Hispanic\n\ncoaches. It is no accident that four players have asked Davis to introduce them\n\nwhen they were admitted to the Football Hall of Fame. Almost to a man, his\n\nformer players and coaches speak of Davis as someone who was color blind in the\n\nbest way--he found people who could win and he built an astonishing number of\n\ngreat teams.\n\nBrad Edelman - Played center for the New Orleans Saints in the 1980's.\n\nJay Fiedler - Currently (8/00) the starting quarterback for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nFormerly with the Jaguars, Vikings, and Eagles. Set school passing records at\n\nDartmouth. He grew up in Oceanside, LI and according to our source was a math\n\ngenius in high school. Calling numbers obviously presents no difficulties for\n\nhim. Fiedler is, by the way, a distant cousin of the late Arthur Fiedler, the\n\nfamous conductor of the Boston Pops Orchestra. His grandfather was Arthur's\n\nsecond cousin.\n\nLeonard Frank - University of Minnesota tackle. All-Amer 1st team 1911.\n\nJohn Frank - World Champion SF 49'ers Tight End (NFL)\n\nLennie Friedman - 1999 Rookie drafted by Denver .Plays Center.\n\nBenny Friedman - 1905-1982) Quarterback, halfback Univ.of Michigan.

Died 2/10/2000 of a heart\n\nattack at age 49.\n\nSid Gillman - A very good college player who became a legend as a coach.\n\nGillman is considered one of football's great offensive innovators. He is\n\ncredited with the idea of using game and practice film for coaching; using the\n\ntwo-platoon system; and he was the first person to place players' names on the\n\nback of their jerseys. In the early 1930s, Gillman was an All American mention\n\n(offensive end) with Ohio State and was co-captain of the team. He coached the\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati for five years and compiled an incredible record. In\n\n1955, he left this job for the pros. He coached the LA Rams for five years. He\n\nswitched to the new AFL Chargers in 1960 (they became the San Diego Chargers in\n\n1963). He compiled a great record with the Chargers. Later, he had shorter\n\nstints with other teams. Al Davis and Bill Walsh were students of Gillman. He\n\nwas named to the pro football Hall of Fame in 1983.

Listed as Jewish in one\n\nsource; not in another. Viewer help welcomed. UPDATE: In a wonderful example of\n\n\"Jewish geography\", two seperate visitors have assisted us: One was on Chad's\n\nhigh school wrestling team; the other had Chad's mother as her 5th Grade\n\nteacher. He's Jewish. Thank you, Jewhoo visitors! Update: Levitt was picked-up\n\nby the Chicago Bears at the end of the 1999 season. However, he was cut in\n\nSeptember, 2000 and his (three year) pro career is probably over. At Cornell,\n\nhe sent running records.\n\nMarv Levy - Levy had a great career as a coach.

Levy joins three other Jews in the Pro Football Hall of\n\nFame (Sid Luckman; Ron Mix; and Sid Gilman.) Fun and interesting piece on Marv\n\non the following link.

His size, speed and monster\n\nbench press catapulted him to the third round of the 1998 NFL draft, where he\n\nwas taken by the Carolina Panthers. Unfortunately, a serious back injury\n\nprevented him from ever playing a down in the NFL and he reached an injury\n\nsettlement with the team.

Made a comeback in 1935, and\n\nagain led Giants to a conference championship, but retired after season. In a\n\nweird sidelight, Newman and some other retired football players were hired to\n\nbe bodyguards for Ford executives during the labor strife of the late '30's. A\n\nJewish quarterback working for Henry Ford, Sr. was, to say the least, a weird\n\ndevelopment.\n\nEd Newman - Played Guard for the great Miami Dolphins teams of the early\n\n1970's.
