The 17-year-old Brit glanced at his opponent before unleashing a fast and accurate service. His Russian rival, Yaroslav Demin, could not control his return and the ball landed long, beyond the baseline. Henry Searle, from Wolverhampton, had become the Wimbledon boys' singles champion of 2023. It had been 61 years since a British teenager had claimed the title. The winner in July 1962 was Stanley Matthews Jr, son of one of the country's greatest-ever footballers.

Sir Stanley himself had been well aware of both the advantages and pitfalls of his son having to live in the shadow of football's "Maestro": "There is no doubt my reputation put some pressure on him. I knew it worried him a bit, being in my shadow. I hoped he might overcome it." When the famous footballer went to watch his son at tournaments, he wore dark glasses to avoid being recognised.

In fact, Stanley Jr's first love had been football but he got clobbered by other lads because of his name and soon turned to tennis. However, even in a different sport he was constantly being unfairly compared with the sporting prowess of his famous father.

But Stanley Sr encouraged his son's tennis ambitions right from the start. The family had their own tennis court in the garden of their home. Stanley Jr was later to call his dad a good club player, thanks to his general fitness level. Jean, his sister, was also a promising junior tennis player. At the age of 17 she had won the doubles title at her local club and was runner-up in the singles tournament. For his part, Stanley Jr, who was 10 at the time, won the under-15 and under-18 singles titles at the same tournament.
