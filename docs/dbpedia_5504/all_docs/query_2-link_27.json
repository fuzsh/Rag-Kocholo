When I completed the degree in July, I wondered if I should just collect the paper by mail and go on with my life like many of my peers did. All my years from school combined with the rigamorole of life suggested that ceremony was making it into too much. Yet, when I returned to school for my MBA years after completing my degree, I was motivated by three things: 1) every day at A Great Idea, I am working to elevate the nonprofit, healthcare, and education teams who trust us to bring the best in brand support and advocacy-building so learning the business basics that are impacted by and impact brand development makes me and AGI better partners, 2) as a small business owner who centers his own biography in activism, enhancing experience with the insights of this coursework assist in being smart, sustainable, and prepared to bring our best all the time, and 3) I believe in lifelong learning (and the celebration of it)... and recently, I was inspired by the sheer joy possible in continuing that journey as we worked on the strategy to bring Greenwich House's Lifelong Skills and Opportunities Center for seniors to life as well as many of our partner programs that recognize the power of education at every age (from RECE's commitment to equity-based early childhood education to Framework's ongoing expansive support of learners across the country to name a few). So, while I know a lot of adult learners step away from the moments to relish the results of late-night studying and reconnecting to some untapped skills like algebra (oh, that Corporate Finance class!), I invited friends to join me and got to walk amongst so many wonderful people of all ages to celebrate. It was a reminder for me (and I hope something for all of us) that these big and little moments are opportunities to be grateful to those around us whose support makes it possible (my friends, my family, my client partners!) to accept challenge and drive forward as well as the joy in being somewhere different as we go through (whether completing or not completing) the process. As we look ahead at a new year, I hope we all get to celebrate each other, celebrate ourselves, and welcome all to walk forward with growth, exploration, and discovery. That, indeed, feels like a great idea!\n\n🐈 The proverbial cat is out of the proverbial bag: some heavy hitters have joined our community: Ares Management Corporation, Castlelake, GSK, Sixth Street, Bank of America, Cambridge Associates, Capstone Investment Advisors, Centerbridge Partners, L.P., Christie's, Informa, Mubadala Capital, National Grid, S&P Global and Rothschild & Co ✴️ The 10kIF cog has been spinning relentlessly to close out this year with a bang, via the introduction of our Corporate Membership Scheme. 🧗🏼♂️ Our work reaches beyond our (tireless) delivery of #paidinternship programmes.
