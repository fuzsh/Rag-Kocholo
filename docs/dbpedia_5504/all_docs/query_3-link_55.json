        "text": "Experts at an ERISA Advisory Council hearing recommended that annuities should be part of a defined contribution plan’s default investments as a hedge against longevity risk.\n\nThe council is a 15-member body that gives advice to the Department of Labor as needed. On Monday, the first of a three-day meeting, the council explored the possibility of making lifetime income options more prevalent as qualified default investment alternatives. In May, the council decided to host the meeting to further research QDIAs in DC plans and health insurance appeals processes. The council is chaired by Mayoung Nham, a principal at Slevin & Hart PC.\n\nOlivia Mitchell, a professor of insurance risk management and the executive director of the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, testified in favor of a specific default annuity structure in DC plans. She recommended that participants be defaulted into a product in which approximately 10% of their plan balance at age 65 is used to purchase a deferred annuity that does not begin to pay until they are about 80 or 85 years of age.\n\nMitchell argued that a “default annuity, not for your entire nest egg, just 10% of your money,” balances several concerns. Since it would not begin to pay until the participant is older, it is more targeted to addressing longevity risk—the risk of outliving all savings. It would also address the fact that “financial decisionmaking and financial literacy often decline later in life,” because participants would need to do less to manage decumulation of their plan assets as they get older.\n\nShe acknowledged to the council that this is a one-size-fits-all approach, but she said defaults should be simpler and will often take that form. A more tailored approach would be more expensive and complicated, and “employers might not have the time and money to do that much analysis,” but “if people want extra bells and whistles, that can be offered as well.”\n\nMichael Finke, a professor of wealth management at the American College of Financial Services, spoke more generally to the benefits of annuities as default options in DC plans. He explained that DC plans are very good at accumulating assets, but “not very good at getting the money out,” meaning it can be difficult for participants to budget from a pot of money. An annuity, however, provides them with regular income that is more easily budgeted.\n\nWhen retirees have a reliable income for life, Finke said that research shows they tend to spend more because there is “less need to be cautious,” since they cannot run out of savings. This effect can be dramatic, because retirees spend income more liberally than they spend savings.\n\nAdding to Mitchell’s point, Finke noted cognitive decline in old age, which can further aggravate the difficulty of budgeting from a pile of assets as opposed to monthly checks.\n\nLastly, Finke acknowledged that annuities can be complicated, and “people don’t really understand what they are.” He briefly recommended that the council explore additional disclosures that could help explain annuities to participants using them and added that putting the contracts in plans could protect participants from buying lower-quality annuities in retail markets out of ignorance, since plan fiduciaries are better situated to choose safer products.\n\nFederal legislation pending since June 2023, the Lifetime Income for Employees Act, would make it easier to use annuities as a default option as long as no more than 50% of participant contributions were invested into one. Annuities are not banned, per se, as defaults, but DOL regulations require QDIAs to be available for withdrawal every three months, a requirement that most annuities cannot satisfy. The bill would remove this requirement for annuities, provided they comply with the 50% limit.\n\nThe council will host additional experts on Tuesday and Wednesday to further discuss QDIAs and health insurance appeals.\n\nAll good financial professionals believe in the value of what they’re selling, whether it’s financial planning, mutual funds or managed accounts. Having sold annuities via my firm’s website for 25 years, I firmly believe well-chosen annuities are a superb tool for saving for retirement and generating guaranteed retirement income. But belief alone doesn’t mean much unless it is based on facts and analysis. Over the years, several in-depth studies by academics have made strong cases for the value of annuities.\n\nThe latest is a 2023 paper, “Fixed and Variable Longevity Annuities in Defined Contribution Plans: Optimal Retirement Portfolios Taking Social Security into Account,” written by Wharton School professor of business economics and public policy Olivia S. Mitchell and Goethe University finance professors Vanya Horneff and Raimond Maurer.\n\nDelay claiming Social Security until 70: Wharton professor: “For most Americans, it is financially sensible to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, as this maximizes the retirement payments that they receive for the rest of their lives,” Mitchell writes. “Nonetheless, most people do not do this.”\n\nThe paper is chock full of equations you’d need advanced math skills to grasp. Fortunately, she has written a reader-friendly summary. The case for delaying Social Security payments is compelling. If you start taking benefits at 62, you’ll get only 70% of the full monthly amount you’d receive at 66 or 67, depending on whether you were born before 1960 or not. At 70, you’ll get 124% of the full benefit. Most people would be better off if they had an annuity in their 401(k) account to produce the income that would allow them to defer Social Security payments, the professors write.\n\nMost employees, however, don’t have an annuity option in their 401(k). And many Americans don’t even have a 401(k). If you don’t have that choice, what can you do if you want to generate income that will let you bridge the gap and retire early without endangering your retirement by taking Social Security benefits prematurely?\n\nHere are three options, which aren’t mutually exclusive. One or more might work for you.\n\n• Use nonqualified savings to buy an immediate annuity. Income replacement doesn’t necessarily have to come from tapping a retirement plan if you have substantial savings elsewhere. A single premium immediate annuity is bought with a lump sum. Most buyers choose the lifetime income option, but you can instead choose a period certain income annuity that pays out for a certain number of years.\n\nFor example, John Doe, age 62, retires and places $200,000 of nonqualified savings in an eight-year period certain immediate annuity and lists his wife as joint annuitant so that she will be protected and continue to receive any remaining payments if he dies before the eight years are up. He will know exactly how much guaranteed income he’ll get. And he’ll be protected against future declines in interest rates. If he were instead to use a money market fund, he’d get a decent income now but probably much less in the future when rates are likely to be lower. Based on current rates, as of late April 2024, Joe will receive $2,496.40 per month, including $2,083.33 in nontaxable return of principal and $413.07 of taxable interest. The two will total $239,654.40 over eight years. At 70, the annuity will be exhausted, but then he’ll start collecting Social Security and won’t need the annuity income.\n\n• Tapping an IRA to bridge the gap\n\nYou may not have enough nonqualified savings to produce enough income to put off taking Social Security benefits. Or may not want to use those savings. You would then need to tap your qualified plan, such as a 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA or self-employed plan for the funds. Annuities work well as both traditional and Roth IRAs. At retirement, you can normally transfer funds tax-free from a 401(k) plan to an annuity IRA—a type of traditional IRA funded with an annuity. You can choose, for instance, an immediate annuity, either the period certain type described above, or a lifetime annuity. The former would provide more income over a set period; the latter would guarantee lifetime income. The advantage is that you can produce ample income but the disadvantage is that, with a traditional IRA annuity, all the distributions you’d receive are 100% taxable. Nevertheless, for some people, the ability to get much bigger Social Security benefits later on might be worth the tax hit now.\n\nAnother good option for an IRA is a “CD-type annuity.” That’s not its official name, but it fits. It’s the insurance industry’s rough equivalent of a bank certificate of deposit because it pays a set interest rate for anywhere from two to ten years. This product, officially the fixed-rate deferred annuity or multi-year guaranteed annuity (MYGA) pays a robust rate. Depending on how long you’re willing to commit your money, you can now (as of March 2024) guarantee anywhere from 5.15% to 5.96% annually. Nearly all MYGAs let you withdraw interest without penalty and many let you take out 10% of the balance each year without penalty. You can use the withdrawals to provide income for an early retirement.\n\n• Roth IRA offers tax-free income\n\nThe same annuity options are also good choices for a Roth IRA if you have one. Here, there’s a huge advantage: all withdrawals are completely tax-free! You just have to meet two rules: you must wait until age 59½ before taking money out and wait until you’ve owned the Roth account for at least five years. While a Roth IRA annuity can produce ample tax-free income, there is a downside. Most people prefer to let their Roth IRA money grow for as long as possible because it’s tax-free forever. But, for some people, it may be worth tapping into a Roth so that you can delay your benefits. Remember, the higher benefits will last for your lifetime.\n\nWhile delaying Social Security payments is the best choice for most, it isn’t the right choice for everyone. For instance, if you’re in poor health and don’t expect to live to an advanced age, normally it’s wise to start taking benefits as soon as possible.\n\nKen Nuss is the founder and CEO of AnnuityAdvantage, a leading online provider of fixed-rate, fixed-indexed, and lifetime income annuities.

The World Economic Forum’s Future of Global Fintech Research Initiative is exploring lessons learned from public-private efforts to advance financial literacy.. April is Financial Literacy Month in the US, so here’s the latest on why our understanding of money needs to improve – and how. Money is deeply influential in all our lives. It affects where we live, our education, our health, our careers, our romances, our families and our retirement – plus myriad other junctures along the way. Yet, while the world of finance is always growing and changing, it appears our grasp of it is not. Surveys reveal that significant numbers of US and EU adults are financially illiterate. One in-depth barometer of personal finance knowledge is 28 questions given annually to US adults, known as the P-Fin Index. The index explores eight functional areas across finance, such as earnings, savings, insuring and comprehending risk. Data from the 2024 index reveals how financial literacy in the US has hovered around 50% for eight consecutive years, with a 2% drop in the past two years. The results also show that Americans appear most comfortable with financial knowledge on borrowing, saving and consuming, and the least confident around comprehending financial risk.\n\nTo better understand Americans’ financial literacy, Professor Annamaria Lusardi and Professor Olivia Mitchell designed three multiple-choice questions, known as the Big Three. You can test yourself on these, below, and find out the answers here:\n\n1. Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After five years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow?\n\n2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2% per year. After one year, with the money in this account, would you be able to buy…\n\n3. Do you think the following statement is true or false? Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.\n\nIn 2021, just under 30% of Americans answered all of them correctly. Even more concerning, points out Professor Lusardi in a Cambridge University paper, was the fact that this knowledge gap was compounded by a false sense of financial knowledge by survey respondents, who gave themselves an average rating of 5.1 out of 7. “These findings raise concerns that the gap between perception and reality can cause overconfidence when it comes to critical financial decision-making,” she said.\n\nThe US is not alone in having a significant financial knowledge gap. In the European Union (EU) a quarter of respondents scored low for knowledge in the 2023 Eurobarometer survey on financial literacy, with 18% at a low level of financial literacy. “This first ever EU survey on financial literacy is a wake-up call for us and Member States,” said Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner for Financial Stability, Financial Services and the Capital Markets Union. “Together we need to do more to improve levels of financial literacy in the EU. Equipping people with the confidence and skills to make informed decisions about their money is in everyone’s interest.”\n\nComprehension of financial risk is particularly low\n\nThe world of money is changing significantly, so knowing how to benefit from financial markets while avoiding risk is very important. Yet, results from the P-Fin Index show that people’s comprehension of risk in the US has fallen further behind, sliding by 4% since 2017, to just 35% this year. This is a far-reaching problem, as not being alert to financial risk appears to span generations, as the chart below shows. Being able to navigate risk is crucial, especially as we live through one of the most dynamic chapters in the history of finance. Around 1 billion people could be using cryptocurrencies by 2028, Statista data shows, and revenues in the fintech industry could grow almost three times faster between now and 2028 than those in the traditional banking sector, according to McKinsey.\n\nThe state of retirement fluency\n\nThe global economy is also struggling, which directly impacts inflation levels and therefore risk for the general population. This year is expected to be “another tough year” with “sluggish global growth”, says António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in the latest World Economic Situation and Prospects 2024 report. And people are living longer than ever, which means the traditional retirement plan for nearly 2 billion people may need adjusting. By 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will reach 22%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). For this reason, the P-Fin Index included five questions specifically aimed at retirement fluency in the US for the first time this year.\n\nRetirement fluency\n\nLike any learning, understanding the ins and outs of mortgages, investments, risk profiles and other financial options takes time. But there are ways for people to develop their own financial toolkits.\n\nThe P-Fin Index recommends financial education in primary and secondary schools. Denmark already has mandatory financial education for students ages 13-15, covering budgeting, saving, banking, consumer rights and more, while the UK has incorporated it into its national curriculum. These efforts are paying off: Denmark and the UK rank first and sixth, respectively, in financial literacy worldwide, according to Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services Global Survey.\n\nOrganizations can also step forward to orchestrate learning platforms, such as the work done by partners in the World Economic Forum’s Future of Global Fintech Research Initiative. They conducted a series of multi-stakeholder regional roundtables to explore lessons learned from ongoing and recent public-private efforts to advance literacy.\n\nFinancial literacy is a journey with no end; as the world changes, so too must our knowledge. But embracing the ‘ABCs’ of money management today can help billions of people worldwide enhance their bank accounts – and in turn, their lives.\n\nWorld Economic Forum articles may be republished in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License, and in accordance with our Terms of Use.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are those of the author alone and not the World Economic Forum.\n\nWharton experts on financial literacy\n\nNational Financial Literacy Awareness month is observed in April, and Wharton faculty have taken the opportunity to showcase their research in financial literacy, its importance, and current initiatives for innovation. “Ripple Effect,” the Wharton School’s faculty research podcast, features four installments that cover topics from high schoolers’ financial literacy and household debt to AI’s role in finance. In “How a Philly financial literacy course is helping underserved high school students,” Wharton’s David Musto, Ronald O. Perelman Professor in Finance and director of the Stevens Center for Innovation in Finance, discusses center programs that teach high school students about financial literacy, a process he says should start when people are young. “The course that I’m talking about is Essentials of Personal Finance. … It covers the whole range of financial issues that are relevant in their lives right now, like if you are working a check-out at a store, what is coming out of your paycheck and why? What does that get you? Where’s that going? And then student loans, which are coming up for a lot of these students right away. How do those work?” Musto asks. “It also covers some topics that are about being an educated voter. If people say the Social Security Trust Fund is running out, well, what is that? … When different candidates say different things about that, well, what do you like? What does that mean for you?”\n\nMusto and his class also address at the issue of financial literacy from the perspective of other cultures. “This is something that was inspired by a financial services provider who contacted the center saying, ‘I see you have English-language material, but I have potential clients who come from countries where they speak Spanish. They are adults. They do not know very much about our financial system because they just got here, and a lot of them have had negative experiences with the financial systems in the countries where they came from,” Musto explains. “So, material is aimed at that community, helping them plug into our financial system as soon as possible and not get ripped off, and to be able to send money back to their own countries.”\n\nIn “Understanding how financial literacy affects household debt and bankruptcy,” Sasha Indarte, an assistant professor of finance, discusses her research into the effect of social safety net programs on household debt and creditworthiness, and bias in the bankruptcy process. “I have some ongoing research that tries to both document and understand the reason behind racial disparities and the access to the debt relief that bankruptcy provides,” Indarte says. “It’s really difficult to get at this, so we have to use a clever bit of econometrics in order to try to say something about bias. Now, the reason that it’s challenging is when you see a disparity, this could be due to unobserved variables that we’re not controlling for. For example, if Black filers have a greater risk of losing their jobs in the future, that could make it hard for them to complete some of the requirements in Chapter 13, and that might explain some of the disparities,” explains Indarte. “The crux of our approach to overcome this is we look at differences in the Black/white dismissal gap among Black decision-makers versus white decision-makers in the bankruptcy process. … The idea is when we do this differencing in comparing, we can net out these omitted factors, and what we’re left with is how these two groups make decisions differently.”\n\nIn “How AI in finance impacts financial literacy,” Michael Roberts, the William H. Lawrence Professor of Finance, discusses whether generative AI can help improve financial literacy. It can, he argues, but the current models aren’t sophisticated enough to serve as standalone advisers. “AI is financially literate by any measure in practice. From that perspective, it’s impressive. But when you ask it questions such as just broad, open-ended questions like, ‘How should I save for retirement?’ ‘What should I invest in?’—and I’m sure there are regulations or restrictions on AI from becoming an unlicensed RIA (registered investment adviser)—it really doesn’t know where to begin,” says Roberts. “What’s critical is that I don’t see AI as just a panacea. I view it as a complement and an accelerant on our path towards financial literacy, whatever that may be, or financial proficiency. In other words, I think it’s going to be critical that people recognize that knowledge of finance and financial principles are not going to go away. They are going to be paramount in order to engage successfully with AI, wherever it may be in the future.”\n\nAnd in “Why is Financial Literacy Important?,” Professor Olivia Mitchell argues that it should be a lifelong education because economic factors change over time, including the amount needed for retirement. “We see financial literacy much like other kinds of education. It takes time to learn financial concepts and to apply them, and sometimes it takes money so that you can hire someone or take a course or what have you. These are the two components that are involved in investing in that college. Moreover, that knowledge can depreciate if you don’t use it over time. There are always new financial products on the market, adjustable-rate mortgages, and so forth, so that the knowledge base needs to be continually built throughout life,” Mitchell says. “It is definitely an educational process. Many employers are now offering financial literacy training at the workplace. Why? Because they understand that their workers are suffering financial stress due to debt.”\n\nFinancial literacy should be a lifelong education because economic factors change over time, including the amount needed for retirement, says Wharton’s Olivia S. Mitchell. This episode is part of a series on “Financial Literacy.”\n\nWhat Is Financial Literacy and Where Is It Now?\n\nDan Loney: Olivia Mitchell is professor of business economics and public policy as well as insurance and risk management here at the Wharton School. She’s also director of the Pension Research Council.\n\nOlivia, you and I have talked about financial literacy for many years now, and the concept is one that a lot of people maybe don’t truly understand. From your perspective, what encompasses financial literacy?\n\nOlivia S. Mitchell: Financial literacy is really a broad concept. But in particular, what we’ve been focused on is people’s ability to process economic information and to make informed decisions about things like saving, investment, and spending during retirement.\n\nLoney: There has been a gap in financial literacy for many years now. With all the attention now that is starting to come forward, with the research that you and others have done, is it getting better?\n\nMitchell: I wish we could say things are getting better, and they may be a little bit at the margin. But we’ve been doing a number of studies of financial literacy across not only the U.S., but around the world, and there are still grave shortcomings in what people know and what people are able to do. I think there’s still much work to be done, as much as I hate to say it.\n\nLoney: How important is research as a driver to open more doors around financial literacy?\n\nMitchell: I think the place to start is actually going back 20 years when a colleague of mine, Annamaria Lusardi, and I decided on a whim over dinner to discuss the possibility of surveying older people — people in their 50s and 60s — to find out how financially literate they were, and what impact that might have had on their saving, on their investment, and their retirement outcomes. To our shock and dismay, we found that people were sorely under informed. That one thing led to another, and now we’ve been doing financial literacy studies in over 80 countries, focusing on the young, the middle aged, retirees. There’s definitely much more that needs to be done for each of those groups.\n\nEarly Education in Financial Literacy\n\nLoney: One of the areas we need to focus on is children and being able to incorporate financial literacy in their lives so that they are best prepared when they get through high school or college and get out to work. That seems to be one of the biggest challenges, although there are some states trying to do that right now.\n\nMitchell: In fact, around 21 states, and Pennsylvania is the most recent, have mandated that high schools provide financial education as a mandatory course. I think that’s very much to the good. Of course there’s still details, and the devil’s always in those details, about who’s teaching the class. Is that person capable and understanding of the subject? What kinds of topics will the high school kids be interested in? Because while they might not be interested right away in retirement planning, they probably need to know about credit cards, student loans, and all the other topics that they’re going to confront right away on leaving high school.\n\nLoney: Many years ago, it used to be understanding a checking account and writing a check. Now, in this age of digital, we have so much at our fingertips through our smartphones and various apps.\n\nMitchell: And a lot of young folks make many bad mistakes. There was a case recently of one app, which had gamified investment in the stock market, and it also made it possible for people to borrow on margin. These are kids. A young man had accumulated $100,000 in debt and committed suicide as a result. You cannot only make big financial mistakes, you can make big personal, lifetime mistakes unless you’re better informed these days than we were back in our youth.\n\nLoney: What are the greatest benefits to having that type of a framework in place when you think about individuals longer term?\n\nMitchell: The key issue with financial literacy is that it’s an ongoing process. I myself started the so-called Bank of Mom when my children were little. The Bank of Mom was nothing more than a spreadsheet, and they would get 25 cents allowance. If they wanted more money, they would have to do chores. We’d add up the positive side, and we’d add up how much they had to spend, and if they didn’t have enough, they couldn’t spend it.\n\nThis was a way to start edifying kids from a younger age about budgets. Later on, when it comes to high school, as I said, credit cards become paramount. My younger daughter, when she came to Wharton, was sent 20 credit cards in the first month and immediately got into financial trouble. We had to have a little session, cutting up the cards, and explaining interest, and so on. She’s done better since then, I’m happy to add.\n\nSubsequently, when people get into the workforce, they’re making a number of choices like, what should I put into my 401(k), what should I invest the money in? Again, there’s multiple teachable moments.\n\nLoney: The potential positive impact can be over a lifetime.\n\nMitchell: Absolutely right. The reality is that we see the young people that have been educated in financial literacy, they incur less debt, they save more, they plan more for retirement, they understand better what the options are for investment. Now what we’re seeing is people, when they hit retirement age, are doing a better job making sure they don’t run out of money in old age.\n\nLoney: In your research, you’ve talked about financial literacy being an investment in human capital. Explain that a little bit.\n\nMitchell: We see financial literacy much like other kinds of education. It takes time to learn financial concepts and to apply them, and sometimes it takes money so that you can hire someone or take a course or what have you. These are the two components that are involved in investing in that college. Moreover, that knowledge can depreciate if you don’t use it over time. There are always new financial products on the market, adjustable-rate mortgages, and so forth, so that the knowledge base needs to be continually built throughout life.\n\nIt is definitely an educational process. Many employers are now offering financial literacy training at the workplace. Why? Because they understand that their workers are suffering financial stress due to debt. The debt folks are calling them up at work and hassling them for not paying their credit cards or what have you. This is something that really is in everybody’s best interest, to have a more productive and better-informed workforce.\n\nLoney: There are probably many instances of missed opportunities. You were mentioning before about retirement savings, but maybe some people don’t have a secure retirement because they don’t have the understanding.\n\nMitchell: Indeed, most employers that have 401(k) plans or their equivalent in the nonprofit sector will pick what they call a default savings rate. That is, if the worker has no clue what to do, then the company will say, “All right, we’re going to have a default savings rate of 5% of your income.” The reality in this day and age is 5% is probably not enough. It probably ought to be at least three times that.\n\nIt’s nice to have some guided advice from the employer, but if that savings target is too low, then the employee needs to have additional information to be able to say, “I might want to save a little more if I can, when I can. I might want to save enough to get the full match rate from the employer.” When I negotiated with my kids. I told them they had to save 25% of their paychecks when they started working, and we settled on 18%, which I felt was a huge success.\n\nLoney: When you’re talking about kids, what they can potentially save in their early time out in the workforce, when they don’t have a husband or a wife or a significant other, when they don’t have children — that’s the time to really get things started so that you can have that great base as you move forward.\n\nMitchell: It’s particularly a challenge now that 50 million Americans have student loans. Many of them, in fact, are continuing to have to repay those loans through retirement. A total of 6% of Social Security recipients are still having their Social Security checks garnished for student loans. If you can set people’s feet on the right path early on, don’t get them involved in pay day loans, or only paying the minimum on the credit card, or buy now, pay later is a very popular phenomenon. All those things reflect a misunderstanding of financial literacy, about the consequence of not saving enough and living within your means.\n\nLong-term Benefits of Financial Literacy and Why It’s Important\n\nLoney: You’ve also done some research looking at the difference that having financial literacy education can have long term.\n\nMitchell: Absolutely. For example, if you don’t understand interest rates, and heaven knows that’s been in the news a lot lately, they won’t refinance their loans when interest rates go down, or they pay too much for borrowing, or they fail to insure themselves against living a very long time. If you’re going to retire at 60 and live to 100, and mark my words, a lot of us will, that’s a whole long time to try to live on your savings if you haven’t concentrated on it properly early in life.\n\nLoney: Is this something that plays out in many countries around the world as well?\n\nMitchell: Absolutely. To date, about 80 countries have now set up national programs around financial literacy. Finland is interesting. Finland has launched a new national strategy for becoming the country with the highest financial literacy in the world by 2030. I wish we in this country would follow that shining example. But we are seeing progress, especially at the state level, and many employers are doing their part now to help people do a better job saving for retirement, investing, and by the way, not taking out their entire nest egg when they hit retirement, but rather helping retirees eke out their money over their lifetimes.\n\nLoney: What do you think are the most important components that either young adults or parents trying to help their children need to think about with financial literacy?\n\nMitchell: I don’t know how it was in your family. In my family, finances were not discussed publicly. People’s incomes were always very private, and folks didn’t really talk about things like how much the rent was. I think there’s more we can do to be more transparent. For example, helping kids set budgets so that they understand how much something costs and how much work it takes to save, to be able to pay those costs.\n\nI worked through high school. I worked in college. Increasingly, the work experience is something that a lot of kids don’t have. And parents understandably protect their kids from working too much, or not getting their schoolwork done. But I find that just living in the work world early on is a really good way to start explaining and understanding how costly it is to live, how careful one has to be, and ultimately, the value of saving.\n\nMany Americans heading into retirement confront a weighty question that doesn’t have an easy answer: Should they retain their savings in their 401(k) plans, move them to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), or cash out and pay taxes (and perhaps penalties) on the assets withdrawn?A new research paper titled “The Pros and Cons of Remaining in a 401(k) Plan After Retirement” addresses this question, especially for “the vast majority of Americans who enter retirement with low or moderate levels of financial literacy.” The paper’s authors are Wharton professor of business economics and public policy Olivia S. Mitchell, who is also executive director of Wharton’s Pension Research Council; Catherine Reilly, a non-resident scholar at Georgetown University’s Center for Retirement Initiatives and Pension Research Council advisory board member, and John A. Turner, director of the Pension Policy Center in Washington, D.C.\n\nAccording to the authors, many retirees are better off keeping their savings in 401(k) plans instead of moving them to IRAs, especially lower-income people with limited financial literacy. Although IRAs can offer retirees more advice and distribution options compared to most 401(k)s, there are ways that 401(k) plans can bridge that gap.\n\nRolling over to IRAs, however, “could be a sensible financial decision” for people whose employer plans charge high fees, the paper notes. Those tend to be small employer plans and thus they include relatively few people. Yet most people with low or moderate levels of financial literacy will do better financially by remaining in their employer 401(k) plans, the authors point out. One important reason is that 401(k) plans are more likely to provide retirees lower cost investment options, compared to IRA accounts, they explain.\n\nMitchell believes that the paper’s findings are important at the present time: “Over 11,200 Americans are turning age 65 per day between 2024 and 2027, meaning that those who have not yet retired are likely contemplating retirement in the next few years,” she says. “And many of these have accumulated retirement assets in their 401(k) accounts, which they can either roll over into an IRA that they then must manage, or else retain the funds in their employer-based plan.”\n\nBut choosing between 401(k) plans and IRAs isn’t the simplest of tasks. “This is a potentially costly moment, since few understand the costs and benefits of such rollovers,” Mitchell points out. “Our study examines who might be better off keeping their nest eggs in their employer-managed plans, so as to save money and benefit from the legal protections afforded by plan sponsors under the law.”\n\nAfter Retirement: 401(k)s or IRAs?\n\nThe stakes in that challenge are large: Nearly two-thirds (64%) of private-sector employees (excluding agricultural workers, household workers, and the self-employed) have access to defined contribution (DC) plans, according to 2021 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employer-sponsored DC plans can use their institutional bargaining power to provide their plan participants with better investment and decumulation options than those available from many IRAs, the paper states, citing a report from the Institutional Retirement Income Council.\n\n“Our study examines who might be better off keeping their nest eggs in their employer-managed plan, so as to save money and benefit from the legal protections afforded by plan sponsors under the law.”— Olivia S. Mitchell\n\nMoreover, the key decisionmaker in selecting retirement plan investment and payout options is the employer offering the 401(k) plan, Mitchell notes. Typically the firm is advised by consultants who help in plan design, and sometimes employees have input through an investment or employee benefits committee, she adds. The analysis explores several key factors that retirees should consider when deciding where to park their savings. These include investment management and administrative fees, and how plan size impacts those fees. The plan participant’s level of financial literacy is also important, and whether they need financial advice when choosing between 401(k) plans and IRAs. The paper also delves into the major pros and cons of both IRAs and 401(k) plans. Finally, it explains how legislation and technology tools could help participants refine their choice technology.\n\nThe authors conclude that, compared to 401(k) plans, IRAs can offer better access to advice, easier account consolidation, and greater flexibility of withdrawals. This is especially true when some employers do not encourage retirees to remain in the 401(k) plan after retirement, while IRA providers actively market their services. Even though most 401(k) plans are likely to charge retirees lower fees than IRAs, many people do roll their assets over to IRAs. In fact, Mitchell notes that just over half (54%) of retirees currently leave their retirement accounts with their former employers, with the remainder moving their money to IRAs, according to a 2021 survey.\n\nParticipants in both IRAs and 401(k) plans must pay investment management, administrative, and advisory fees. The investment fees are typically lower for 401(k) investors than for IRA investors. One explanation for this is that large 401(k) plans can often access low-cost institutional share classes or commingled investment trusts (CITs) which are not available to retail investors.\n\nRelatively less information is available on 401(k) plan administrative fees, the paper notes; those fees cover asset custody, record keeping, and third-party administration. Many IRA providers do not charge administrative fees, preferring to earn their income from annual fees on the assets they manage. Low-cost robo-advisors are also available via online platforms. The majority of 401(k) participants are in large plans, which can benefit from economies of scale and so charge lower fees than small plans.\n\nPlan participants’ account balances and their degree of financial literacy should also influence their rollover decisions. The more financially literate can construct low-cost portfolios for themselves in IRAs, while the less financially literate will need IRA advice. In most cases, financially unsophisticated participants and those with low account balances are likely to be better off staying put in their employer plans instead of rolling over to IRAs. Moreover, under U.S. pension law, employers providing retirement plans have a fiduciary duty to provide investment options in participants’ best interests.\n\nSome plan sponsors may prefer that retirees remain in their employer-sponsored plans, to increase the size of the pool of investable funds, which may allow them to negotiate lower fees from retirement plan service providers.\n\nLegislative Support for 401(k)s\n\nRecent policy developments have made it easier for retirees to remain in their 401(k) plans, including safe harbors for offering annuities and regulatory guidance requiring that advisors and brokers act in clients’ best interest when considering a rollover from an employer’s plans to an IRA. Beginning in 2025, the Secure 2.0 Act will require companies with new 401(k) and 403(b) plans to automatically enroll their employees into these plans.\n\nAsset managers and others in the retirement planning value chain are also partnering with technology providers to help retirees retain their savings in their 401(k) plans. Those efforts, however, are a work in progress. The authors note that “both 401(k) plans and IRAs must evolve if they are to provide better options for participants in the decumulation phase of life.” They also recommended that defined contribution (DC) plans could incorporate longevity risk pooling to help retirees manage their payouts. This, they add, could enable many DC plans to adopt an attractive feature of defined benefit (DB) plans, while avoiding employer liability as well as funding and portability problems.\n\nLarge investment managers like BlackRock are alive to the challenges retirees face. BlackRock chairman Larry Fink said in his recent 2024 letter to investors that “providing people what my parents built over time — a secure, well-earned retirement — is a much harder proposition than it was 30 years ago. And it’ll be a much harder proposition 30 years from now. People are living longer lives. They’ll need more money.”\n\nAll considered, the study’s authors believe that, in the long run, “retaining assets in employer plans after retirement could usher in a new era of collectively managed investment solutions for retirees.” This approach would help plan sponsors “put the pension back” into DC plans, they add. “Ultimately, and most importantly, this could yield better outcomes, more retirement confidence, and greater security for retirees.”\n\nThere are now 35 states — including new additions Florida and Pennsylvania — with current or forthcoming rules to make some personal-finance coursework part of high-school graduation requirements. The number of high-school students required to receive personal-finance instruction before they graduate is about to increase substantially — and bleak early-pandemic memories could be one factor driving the surge, some financial-literacy experts say. “The pandemic really pulled the cover off the fact that so many Americans really had no financial resilience, and that really opened people’s eyes,” said Nan Morrison, the president and CEO of the Council for Economic Education. “The pandemic certainly hit harder financially in some communities than others,” she added. “And when you pass requirements, you get access for every child.” There are now 35 states — including new additions Florida and Pennsylvania — with current or forthcoming rules to make some personal-finance coursework part of high-school graduation requirements, according to a report by Morrison’s organization published last week.\n\nThat marked a 12-state increase from 2022, when the organization’s biennial report counted 23 states with such mandates in place or slated to take effect. Between 2020 and 2022, just two states adopted requirements for personal-finance education. Twenty states currently require or are poised to require one semester of personal-finance instruction, the most recent report showed, up from nine states in 2022. The policy push for personal-finance education continues to expand. In Washington, a bill that would require high schoolers to complete half a credit of financial education recently passed the state’s House of Representatives. In California, an organization is collecting signatures for a November ballot vote that would mandate that Golden State high schoolers take a one-semester personal-finance class. “It feels like the boulder has started to roll down the hill very quickly,” said Christopher Caltabiano, the Council for Economic Education’s chief program officer. To him, the main driver is the growing evidence that classroom instruction on finances helps students’ financial lives. As state lawmakers learn about new requirements, he added, there’s also a follow-the-leader element.\n\nBut the pandemic’s impact played a role, even if a secondary one, Caltabiano said. Millions of people found themselves jobless in 2020 after stay-at-home orders ground many businesses to a halt, and the federal government churned out trillions in relief for families and businesses suddenly unable to pay bills. The government response included three rounds of stimulus checks, enhanced unemployment benefits and a lengthy pause on student-loan payments. “Everywhere we need this. COVID made it very clear around the world how unprepared people are to face shock,” said Annamaria Lusardi, a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research who also teaches a financial-literacy class at Stanford. Lusardi’s research traces the line between financial literacy and financial “fragility” during times of sharp economic distress. After reviewing survey data from April 2020 and May 2020, Lusardi and her co-authors determined that people who scored higher on three questions about interest rates, inflation and stock diversification were more likely to say they could come up with $2,000 within the next month for an emergency. The pandemic didn’t create the need for more financial literacy, she said — rather, it made clear “the cost of financial illiteracy.” That’s not a knock on people who lack financial knowledge, Lusardi emphasized. “It’s because we don’t have it in the schools.” The need for more financial know-how predated the pandemic. Financial literacy was slipping for all demographics, but particularly for 18- to 34-year-olds, according to a 2019 study by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation, the educational arm of the government-authorized nonprofit that regulates the brokerage industry. When Pennsylvania state Sen. Chris Gebhard, a Republican, sponsored the bill to require a personal-finance course for high schoolers in the state, he wasn’t reacting to the pandemic’s economic strain, he said. He’s attempting to break the long-running pattern of too many people learning about money “by making the wrong financial decisions and learning by failing.” “I think there’s a better way to do that,” he said. Still, the pandemic underscored the public’s “perilous” financial conditions, he said, and that backdrop may have contributed to support for the bill. Gebhard’s proposal came to fruition as part of an omnibus education-policy bill passed in December. Starting in the 2026-2027 school year, the teens who are ninth graders in all Pennsylvania schools, not just public schools, will need one course in personal finance. The specifics will vary as school districts decide the curriculum, but Gebhard said the bill points to guidelines that discuss personal-finance fundamentals like budgeting, credit cards, investing and insurance. Students are entering a complex economy where it’s easy to make quick spending and investing decisions by tapping a smartphone, Gebhard said. “We wanted to give them the financial foundation on which they are going build their financial decisions.”\n\nAs many other products did during the pandemic, financial-literacy classes may face supply-chain challenges. There aren’t enough educators who are sufficiently trained to teach personal finance, according to John Pelletier, the director of Champlain College’s Center for Financial Literacy. The center offers a class that instructs teachers on how to teach the topic. It’s common for teachers instructing on financial literacy to have certifications in other topics, including social studies, family and consumer science, business and math, he said. “If we have this mandated, we have got to make sure these educators get trained. That’s where I worry,” he said. “My fear is people might see this as a failure without training.” Indeed, “financial education is most effective when there is a rigorous curriculum, a specific course devoted to personal finance (rather than embedding these concepts into other classes), and trained teachers,” Lusardi and Olivia Mitchell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, wrote in a journal article last fall. It’s also important to provide financial education after high school, including in college and workplaces, “because acquiring financial knowledge is a lifelong process and the crucial financial challenges vary by age,” they added. Last year, 1.7 million students went to high schools in states with a dedicated one-semester personal-finance course. That number is expected to climb to 6.4 million by 2028, according to projections in a December report authored by Pelletier.\n\nIt’s no coincidence that the financial-literacy push intensified in the pandemic’s wake, the report noted. The good news is that teachers increasingly want to learn about financial literacy for their students and themselves, said Tim Ranzetta, a co-founder of Next Gen Personal Finance. The nonprofit’s services include teacher workshops and curricula at no cost to schools. In the last four years, more than 17,000 teachers have amassed over 430,000 hours of training and instruction through Next Gen’s certification courses, online modules and in-person workshops, he said. Teachers and students are a key part of the push for more financial literacy, he said. “Once you’ve learned this yourself, you become a believer,” he said.\n\nWorkplace norms in the 21st century have evolved significantly in the past few decades, from a greater emphasis on work-life balance to the rise of remote and hybrid work. Yet as much as the daily grind has progressed, the disparity between men’s and women’s wages persists, with women still earning 82% of what men earn, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Women continue to make less than their male counterparts, despite varying sustained attempts to achieve wage parity. The research team at MarketWatch Guides analyzed various wage gap statistics across time, geographical locations, occupations, and education levels to explore the differences in how much men and women earn. A closer look at the parity between men’s and women’s pay reveals several key factors, many as subtle as they are complex. Read on to find out more about the continued pay disparity between women and men.\n\nCompare Wage Gap And Tax Differences. Equal Pay\n\nKey Findings\n\n• Utah has the largest wage gap of any state in the U.S., with women earning 73.1% of what men earn on average.\n\n• Women in Puerto Rico actually earn more, on average, than men. This is the only state or territory in the U.S. where this is true.\n\n• The gender wage gap shrank 38% between 1960 and 2022, but on average, women still earn 82% of what men earn.\n\n• The gender pay gap is most pronounced among people with less than a high school education compared to other levels of education.\n\n• Legal occupations have the largest wage gap of any job category. Community and social service jobs have the smallest wage gap.\n\n• Experts advise women to enhance their financial literacy by learning about tools such as high-yield savings accounts and CDs in order to move forward.\n\n• The Wage Gap Varies from State to State\n\n• The gender pay gap varies nationwide and among U.S. territories. Puerto Rico is the only state or territory where women make more than men. Conversely, women earn less than 75% of what men make in Utah.\n\nStates With the Largest Pay Gap\n\nState Percentage Point Difference Between Mens and Women’s Pay\n\nUtah 36.75%\n\nLouisiana 33.78%\n\nAlabama 33.40%\n\nNew Hampshire 32.82%\n\nIdaho 32.21%\n\nKansas 30.13%\n\nIndiana 29.70%\n\nMississippi 29.64%\n\nNorth Dakota 29.34%\n\nWest Virginia 29.16%\n\nStates With the Smallest Pay Gap\n\nState Percentage Point Difference Between Mens and Women’s Pay\n\nPuerto Rico -2.47%\n\nVermont 11.97%\n\nCalifornia 13.34%\n\nNew York 14.23%\n\nNevada 15.46%\n\nArizona 15.72%\n\nOregon 16.51%\n\nNew Mexico 16.90%\n\nMaryland 17.56%\n\nConnecticut 17.90%\n\nThe Wage Gap Is Improving, But Inequality Persists\n\nHistorically, men have long earned more, on average, than women. While the median wage for men has recently neared $65,000, women only achieved a $50,000 median wage for the first time in 2019. However, the wage gap has closed by 38 percentage points since 1960. Pinpointing the factors that influence the gender wage gap reveals several key potential sources. Entering the workforce, the wage parity between genders remains narrow, yet, as women age, the gap increases. Through the lenses of education, parenthood, occupation, economic conditions, race and ethnicity, and gender stereotypes, we can begin to understand the circumstances surrounding wage inequality. Despite a larger population of female college graduates, the wage gap between men and women of the same educational background endures. Parenthood can have a significant impact on wages for mothers and fathers. However, fathers tend to be more present in the workforce and earn more than women with or without children at home. Men and women often pursue varying careers based on personal and family needs. Women have certainly increased their presence among male-centric occupations (i.e., STEM, legal, and business). However, this doesn’t correlate to a corresponding retreat of women in positions where they tend to be overrepresented. Women were also slower to recover from recent recessions.\n\nIn the face of prevailing gender stereotypes, women of various races and ethnicities fall along a wide spectrum of wage parity. Women who identified as white earned 83% of their white male counterparts in 2022, according to a Pew Research study, while black women earned 70% and Hispanic women made 65%. However, Asian women made 93% of the average white male’s salary, per the Pew study.\n\nDetermining what weight to award each of these factors presents a monumental challenge. Men and women alike hold varying reasons for their career changes, professional pursuits, and individual reactions to the path life presents. As is historically evident, achieving wage parity between the sexes remains an ideal goal that continues to require a multi-faceted approach.\n\nThe Wage Gap Also Varies by Education Level, Occupation\n\nGenerally speaking, a higher level of education can translate to increased qualifications for higher-paying jobs. In addition, certain occupations tend to have a higher earnings potential than others. Let’s explore the wage gap between men and women of varying educational levels and occupations.\n\nGender Wage Gap by Education Level\n\nThe largest gender pay gap exists between men and women with less than a high school diploma. However, pursuing additional education after graduation only narrows the pay gap by less than 10%. Even between men and women with a graduate or professional degree, the wage gap spans over 40%.\n\nGender Wage Gap by Occupation\n\nAmong specific occupations, women are more likely to achieve wage parity in fields such as community and social services, liberal arts and media, healthcare, and social sciences. In professions traditionally held by men — such as legal, sales, transportation, management, and production — a strong gender wage disparity persists.\n\nExperts Discuss the Gender Pay Gap\n\nParticipating in the workforce represents a single facet of how women contribute to their professional success and the well-being of others. Women often take on a caregiving role, whether through parenthood or by caring for an elderly relative. “In doing so, that means there are years in which we do not have personal income and are not building personal wealth,” said Helen Moser, senior lecturer infinance at the University of Minnesota. These trends can also impact women’s ability to save and invest. “Lower wages means less money for investment,” said Dr. Jenny Olson of Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. A lack of financial literacy is another potential area of difficulty, but one that’s solvable, said Dr. Olivia Mitchell, professor of insurance/risk management and business economics/policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “A goal would be for employers to offer more access and, when possible, encouragement to learn and implement important financial lessons during the worklife,” Mitchell said.\n\nLearning about the value of the best high-yield savings accounts and other financial tools can certainly propel women forward. However, Dr. Ting Levy, senior instructor of economics and a Division of Research associate in the College of Business at Florida Atlantic University, promotes a more direct approach. “Negotiate salaries and look for career advancement,” she urged. “Actively seek fair compensation and career growth opportunities.” Finding a mentor and building a strong network can also contribute to a narrower gender pay gap, she said.\n\nMoving Beyond Gendered Wages in the 21st Century\n\nAs much as the gender pay gap has narrowed in the last 60 years, more work to achieve wage parity has yet to be done. Many modern employers actively encourage women to apply for higher-paying jobs. Yet raising awareness of the earnings disparity between men and women can engender efforts to continue to bring about changes, big and small. It is achievable for expertise and fitment to trump gender in qualifying and compensating candidates for any position.\n\nWomen who feel like you’re behind in building wealth: You’re not alone. A 2022 report by WTW and the World Economic Forum found that upon retirement, women across the world are expected to have on average only 74% of the wealth that men have. Building wealth is often painted as a matter of personal choices. But while individual actions matter, putting the responsibility solely on the individual while ignoring the systemic inequalities that make it harder for women to build wealth is neither fair nor helpful. Does it really matter how you pinch the pennies in your checking account if the gender wage gap, credit gap, motherhood penalty and other big-picture issues cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars in your lifetime? The research team at MarketWatch Guides analyzed the differences in average earnings of men and women using data from the U.S. Census Bureau to explore the gender wage gap. We also looked at primary and secondary research surrounding other factors, such as credit score differences and the motherhood penalty, that make it more difficult for women to build wealth. Here’s what we found—and what you can do about it.\n\nKey findings\n\nOn average, women earn 82% of what men earn in the U.S. Other studies have shown that the wage gap is even larger for women of color.\n\nThe motherhood penalty and a tendency to have lower credit scores on average also make it more difficult for women to build wealth.\n\nWomen live 5.8 years longer on average than men in the U.S., so they need to save more for retirement.\n\nObstacles women face to building wealth\n\nWhile it’s certainly possible for women to build wealth — and indeed, many women who have successfully done so — there are several societal factors that make it harder for them. “Women are often at a disadvantage in the financial sector,” says Dr. Olivia S. Mitchell, professor of insurance/risk management and business economics/policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “Around the world, they tend to earn less, take time away from work to raise children and are found in occupations and industries which are less likely to offer access to retirement savings plans.”\n\nHere are some of the unique obstacles women face when it comes to building wealth:\n\nThe Wage Gap\n\nOne of the biggest barriers women face in building wealth is the gender wage gap. In 2022, the median wage of all female full-time, year-round workers was 82% of the median wage of all male full-time, year-round workers. In other words, the average woman earned only 82 cents for every dollar the average man did. Moreover, the wage gap was more pronounced in certain high-earning industries, such as the legal industry — where the median female wage was only 53.5% of the median male wage.\n\nEducation also affected the gap. The median earnings of women with less than a high school degree was 66% of the earnings of a male at the same education level, while a woman who was a high school graduate or equivalent made 70.1% of what her male counterparts did.\n\n“This gap is often rooted in systemic issues like occupational segregation, gender bias in the workplace, and the undervaluing of roles traditionally held by women,” says Ting Levy, Ph.D., senior instructor of economics and a Division of Research associate in the College of Business at Florida Atlantic University. “Over a lifetime, this gap can lead to significantly less income, affecting savings, investments, and retirement funds.”\n\nAlthough the MarketWatch Guides analysis did not look at racial differences in the wage gap, a 2021 study by the Center for American Progress found that the wage gap was more pronounced for some women of color. For every dollar the average White, non-Hispanic man earned in 2020, a white, non-Hispanic woman earned 79 cents, a Black woman earned 64 cents and a Hispanic woman earned 57 cents.\n\nThe U.S. has made significant progress in closing the wage gap since 1960, when the median female wage was only 60.7% of the median male wage. But it’s not enough, when lower wages impact almost every aspect of a woman’s finances — giving her less money to invest, less ability to pay back debts and lower Social Security benefits in retirement.\n\nThe Motherhood Penalty\n\nMultiple studies show that for women, wages tend to fall sharply after giving birth and remain lower for long after that — the so-called “motherhood penalty.” This holds true even if the woman earned more than her partner prior to childbirth, a 2023 study shows. The study found that after childbirth, women were more likely to drop out of the labor force and less likely to switch to — or perhaps, have less success finding — a higher-paying job compared to their male counterparts.\n\n“Culturally, women are more likely to experience work disruptions for caregiving purposes,” says Dr. Jenny Olson, assistant professor of marketing at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business.\n\nThese disruptions can erode a woman’s wages, which in turn hinders her ability to save, invest or build wealth for the future. That lack of income continuity can be a major financial hurdle, says Dr. Melissa Williams, associate professor of organization & management at Emory University. “Women on average are more likely to experience breaks in their paid careers, sometimes because they’ve provided care for children and elders, or even because they’ve moved geographically to follow a partner’s career,” says Williams. “This can make it harder for women to grow a nest egg through savings, and even to max out Social Security benefits on retirement.”\n\nLower Credit Scores\n\nA 2018 study by the Federal Reserve found that single women on average had lower credit scores and more negative factors in their credit history compared to single men. These findings were consistent even after controlling for age, education, race and income. (The study did not consider married men or women.) That’s not to say women necessarily use credit less responsibly than men. The study posits that external factors like economic circumstances, labor market experiences and different treatment by institutions may contribute to the gender gap in addition to personal factors like financial literacy levels or attitudes towards borrowing. Having lower credit scores could give women more difficulty being approved for loans or higher interest rates for loans they are approved for. For example, a 2016 study by the Urban Institute found that single women on average pay more for mortgages — a traditional path to building wealth in America — compared to single men or couples. They’re also more likely to be denied a loan.\n\nA Longer Retirement\n\nAlthough women face more obstacles in building wealth compared to men, they need to save more money for retirement. The average life expectancy for females is 5.8 years longer than the average male life expectancy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Women have a longer retirement and are “potentially more exposed to outliving their savings and becoming impoverished in later life,” says Mitchell. This is especially true if they outlive any caretakers whom they expected to care for them, or have difficulty finding reliable caretakers, says Dr. Ginnie Gardiner, clinical associate professor of finance at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\n4 Steps Women Can Take To Build Wealth\n\nAlthough systemic inequalities can’t be fixed overnight or by one person, you can still build wealth in spite of them. We asked the experts we interviewed to provide some fundamental steps and strategies women can take to achieve greater financial health.\n\n1. Assess and regularly revisit your financial goals\n\n“The first step [to building wealth] is to assess your values and long-term goals,” says Olson. If you’re in a relationship, you should also communicate with your partner and make sure your goals and decisions are aligned. Once you know your goals, you can plot out how to achieve them. “Do you want to enjoy luxurious vacations in retirement? Do you want to help finance your children’s and grandchildren’s education? Do you want to donate a substantial amount to prosocial causes?” says Olson. Each of these goals will mean different priorities for the present and different paths for building wealth. It’s important to regularly revisit your goals, says Olson, as your life circumstances change. Checking in on your goals can also motivate you with a sense of progress or tell you if anything needs adjusting.\n\n2. Gain confidence through education\n\nMitchell says her research shows a gap in financial literacy between women and men. For example, a smaller percentage of women aged 50+ were able to correctly answer basic questions about interest, risk diversification and inflation, compared to men. “This lack of financial literacy then translates into greater financial regret among older women,” Mitchell says. Other studies have found similar gender-based financial literacy gaps. However, a 2021 study found that one-third of the financial literacy gap can be explained by a lack of confidence, rather than objective knowledge. In other words, women may know less than men, but they also know more than they think they know. This takeaway was reflected in the 2024 MarketWatch Guides Joint Banking Survey. Among respondents, a far lower percentage of married women (18.2%) said they were the more financially savvy partner in their relationship than men (43.5%). However, a far higher percentage of married women (36.4%) in the survey said that they were the more disciplined partner in the relationship, although still a slightly lower percentage than married men (41.4%) who took the survey. There’s one thing that can fix the financial literacy gap: more financial education. Both Mitchell and Gardiner recommend increasing financial education among young people. But regardless of your age, shoring up on your financial knowledge will help you make more informed decisions and act with more confidence. If you’re reading this, you’re already on the right track.\n\n“It is easier today than ever to find information on building wealth,” says Helen Moser, senior lecturer in finance at the University of Minnesota. “There are free financial help books available, and there are so many vehicles for saving that are easier to access than in the past.”\n\nNatalya Bikmetova, assistant professor of finance at Hofstra University, says that women can learn valuable financial information from others, in addition to books, courses and educational resources. “As a professor, I found networking and mentorship to be particularly useful to build confidence and empower [women],” she says. “It is vital to seek advice and mentorship and to share your expertise with fellow females as well to create a productive environment and grow your network.”\n\n3. Invest more frequently and more confidently\n\nThe stock market is one of the best pathways to building long-term wealth, but women are missing out. A 2021 report by Fidelity Investments found that only 67% of women were investing outside of retirement in 2021 and only 33% said they felt confident in their ability to make investment decisions. Furthermore, only 47% of the women surveyed said that, if given $25,000 to invest in the stock market, they would know what steps to take and do so. Despite this confidence gap that keeps more women from investing, Fidelity found that women investors actually outperformed their male counterparts by 0.4%. “Women tend to report lower financial confidence (on average) than men, which may prevent them from taking informed action,” says Olson. “While being cautious can be a good thing, so is taking calculated risk to maximize returns.” What does that mean for you? Invest early and invest whatever you can. High-yield savings accounts and CDs are good low-risk ways to grow your money, but don’t skip the stock market. And, while research is important, don’t feel like you need to wait until you’re a stock market expert before doing anything. Fidelity found that 69% of women surveyed wished they had started investing their extra savings earlier. Even if you start with a few dollars each month invested into an ETF or a robo-advisor account, getting into the habit of investing your extra savings will help you gain confidence and build wealth over the long term.\n\n4. Prepare for old age now\n\nMore women should be aware of longevity risk, or the risk of living longer than expected in retirement, says Mitchell. “People have a general notion of the average life expectancy for someone like themselves, but they woefully underestimate the chance they could live long enough to run out of money in old age,” Mitchell explains. This is especially true for women, who live longer on average than men. Women who are financially dependent on another person, whether by choice or by circumstance, are at especially high risk of financial difficulty if their provider leaves them in death or divorce, says Gardiner. She recommends that women who enter into a relationship where money is commingled should take steps to ensure they have sufficient financial independence. “This could mean a separate bank account, prenup, safe deposit, box, life insurance, [or] joint ownership of assets,” she says. As for outliving one’s own savings, Mitchell says a good way to prevent this scenario is to start planning for it early. “Given the fact that longer-lived women are quite likely to experience health problems — including dementia — at older ages, making provision for one’s old age early in life is critically important,” she says. This could mean choosing to invest more money in your retirement accounts or exploring options like long-term care insurance or longevity insurance.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhile many of the systemic obstacles women face in the financial sphere can’t be fixed overnight, there are still things you personally can do right now to improve your financial health and build wealth. Keep learning about the intricacies of personal finance, start investing if you haven’t already and get strategic about your financial goals are how you plan to achieve them. Remember: Research has shown that you likely know more than you think you do. And if there’s anything you don’t know, well — that’s what we’re here for.\n\nMethodology\n\nIn order to provide an accurate picture of the state of gender and wages in the U.S. and effective advice to women for building wealth, we at the MarketWatch Guides team conducted a comprehensive study. This study included research into U.S. Census data and conversations with experts in the fields of finance and sociological studies.\n\nThe data we used include:\n\nU.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey, 1961 to 2022 Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC)\n\n2022 American Community Survey, U.S. Census, Median Earnings in the Past 12 Months (in 2022 Inflation-Adjusted Dollars) of Workers by Sex\n\nIBM’s new pension program may not change the game for workers. But it raises big questions about what companies owe their employees, and how existing retirement structures could better serve them.\n\nA One-Off?\n\nIn the heyday of the private-sector pension, CDs were just starting to appear on shelves, Prince Charles was courting Lady Diana Spencer, and perms were ubiquitous. Defined-benefit pension plans—with those regular payment checks that Americans typically think of when they think pensions—were widespread across a range of corporations in the 1980s. Now only a very small slice of nongovernment employees retires with such a pension. So when I read that IBM was offering a version of a defined-benefit pension for its employees, I wondered: After decades of retreat, were pensions back in a big way? Not so fast, experts told me. “The news about IBM is more or less a one-off,” Olivia Mitchell, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and the executive director of its Pension Research Council, explained. That’s because IBM’s latest move may be more of a cost-saving tactic than it is a marker of the company’s changing philosophy on retirement savings.\n\nIBM is in a specific boat—the company has a tranche of money saved from its old pension fund that can be spent only on retirement benefits, Jean-Pierre Aubry, the associate director of state and local research at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, told me. “This is really just a financial maneuver to get a pot of money that they can’t access in any other way than to provide benefits,” he explained; very few other companies have such bloated trusts lying around. The new approach unlocked billions in funds, and IBM’s shareholders are expected to benefit, given that the firm probably won’t be spending on 401(k) contributions for at least several years. (Aubry said he wouldn’t be shocked to see the company return to such a plan when the pension fund runs out.) Pensions can make a big difference for workers who otherwise aren’t saving for retirement, ensuring that even those who didn’t actively stash away money in a 401(k) or similar fund will receive some money after they stop working. But over the decades, as the workforce has become more mobile—and as employers balked more and more at the high cost of paying out monthly checks to retired workers—defined-contribution plans such as 401(k)s became the norm. Such plans shift the responsibility of saving for retirement from the company to the employee—if an employee doesn’t contribute to their 401(k), then a company generally won’t contribute to their savings in turn.\n\nBut at IBM in particular, it’s unclear whether a return to pension plans will be a game changer for employees: 97 percent of its workers apparently already had a 401(k) plan set up, and the company automatically enrolled workers unless they opted out. “It’s closer to a wash,” Mitchell explained, noting that some workers might actually save less for retirement under this new system. As Jeff Sommer wrote in The New York Times earlier this month, “What [IBM] is doing now is no simple return to the classic cradle-to-grave benefits system. In fact, IBM’s new pension plan isn’t nearly as generous to long-tenured employees compared with its predecessor.” A spokesperson for IBM wrote in an email that its new retirement benefit account “adds a stable and predictable benefit that diversifies a retirement portfolio and provides employees greater flexibility and options,” adding that employees can opt to keep contributing to 401(k) accounts if they want to.\n\nDefined-benefit pension plans have long been idealized, and understandably so. Though pricey for companies, pensions offer an enticing upside for employees: Workers can expect to receive regular checks during their retirement, no contributions required, and they don’t have to shoulder the financial risk of investing. Reviving pension plans was a key demand in UAW strikes over the summer (one that did not end up in its contracts with carmakers), and the promise of a pension is a major appeal of public-sector jobs, most of which still offer the benefit. But in many ways, experts told me, pensions are not a perfect fit for today’s workforce: 401(k) plans are “much more egalitarian,” Mitchell argued. “If you contribute, you get something.” With pensions, by contrast, if you leave the workforce during your working years, you may not get much from a pension plan. Many workers are also just not that interested in pensions, Mitchell said, some of which required them to spend their entire career at a single company to reap the benefits. And a company may not want to pressure workers to stay at the firm when they want to move on.\n\nAubry told me that IBM’s new plan has further opened up conversations in his field around how American workers are saving for retirement, and how the 401(k) system can be improved to include some of the pros of the pension system. Could more companies automatically opt in workers, for example, ensuring that everyone is stashing something away? As things stand now, he said, the people who tend to invest money in 401(k) plans are those who are already relatively wealthy, and there are gender and racial gaps in who saves for retirement. Only about half of private-sector workers are participating in any sort of retirement plan at all. Mitchell and other experts are also interested in what actually happens to people’s money once they retire. Receiving a lump sum of retirement funds after decades of saving can be overwhelming to those who might stress about spending it too fast, and tempting to those who want to make big purchases. She has advocated for the annuitization of 401(k) plans, so that people get checks in the mail each month, rather than a chunk of cash at the end of their career. Even if 401(k) plans are not there yet, Mitchell said, they “can become the best of both worlds.”\n\nSince they first appeared 40 years ago, 401(k) plans have come a long way, but many policy experts say there is still a lot more to be done to secure a reasonable retirement for all Americans. On the positive side, 401(k) plans and other defined contribution retirement plans today have dramatically lower fees, allowing workers to keep more of their savings. In 2000, for example, 401(k) participants incurred an average expense ratio of 0.77% for investing in equity mutual funds, or 77 cents for every $100 they put in. Today, they’re paying 0.33%, less than half of that, according to the Investment Company Institute.\n\nAuto enrollment and other automatic savings features have also worked wonders in boosting plan participation. In 2004, for example, when automatic enrollment was not widely used, the average plan participation rate was 74%, far below today’s average participation of 85%, according to Vanguard’s latest edition of its “How America Saves” report. The emergence of target-date funds and their use as the default investment option have also helped millions of retirement savers who might not have been able to decide where to hold their assets. “It seems sensible to make sure that people are not putting themselves into some fixed-income type of investment,” said Alicia Munnell, 25-year director and founder of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, adding that default investment options and other automatic features have been important in improving the effectiveness of DC plans. Yet for all the advances in design, defined contribution plans may have reached a limit in terms of what they can accomplish, according to industry experts. “Everything that can be done to make these plans work better has been done,” Munnell said, bemoaning the fact that despite the industry’s hard work and innovation, defined contribution plans are still not widely available to workers. “If you take a snapshot of the private-sector workforce at any moment of time, you’ll see only half the working population is covered,” she said.\n\nThe lack of coverage disproportionately impacts low- and middle-income Americans who typically work for employers that do not offer workplace retirement plans, Munnell and other experts said. The defined contribution system has worked well for the top third of wage earners who “built up big piles” because they’re in the system all the time, unlike those who haven’t been in the system in a steady way or have never had access to it, Munnell said. Munnell explained that the industry initially produced Excel spreadsheets showing people that if they saved continuously at a set rate of return, they’d “have this much money,” but the calculation from the “synthetic” rather than the actual work history fell short because people move in and out of jobs that don’t always offer workplace plans. “It’s only worked well for a subset of the population, and now I think the challenge is to figure out something that will work well for the rest of the population,” she said.\n\nTeresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and policy analysis at the New School for Social Research, was more critical, denouncing the system as an outright failure. If she were to give the system a report card on its outcomes for an entire generation of workers over the past 40 years, she would give it an “F,” she said. Ghilarducci noted that only 54% of people between the ages of 55 and 64 have any kind of retirement savings, with the median amount saved a modest $134,000. “I am shuddering when I look at these numbers,” she said. “I don’t know how people are going to do it.”\n\nExperts agree that the coverage issue shouldn’t fall squarely on employers, noting that they shouldn’t have to shoulder the burden of offering plans if they don’t have the money or resources to offer them, as is often the case with small employers. “This isn’t to throw employers under the bus,” said John Scott, project director of retirement savings at The Pew Charitable Trusts. “Sometimes they don’t have the administrative capacity or bandwidth to take on the sponsorship of a retirement plan.” Experts are skeptical that provisions in the SECURE 2.0 Act to spur employers to offer workplace plans, including more generous tax credits, will make much of a difference. “A tax credit for small employers might seem generous, but if the employer has to pay an upfront fee for starting a plan but cannot get the tax credit for several months due to the time it takes to file the tax return and then processing the return, the credit might be less appealing,” Scott said, adding that he’s in the “wait-and-see” camp.\n\nOne bright spot in fixing the coverage gap are state-run retirement savings programs, which have been popping up across the country as “auto IRAs.” These programs typically require employers to make the programs available to their workers if they don’t offer a workplace retirement savings program themselves. They also typically automatically enroll workers in a payroll-deduction individual retirement account unless they opt out. Munnell, a “big fan of auto IRAs,” is heartened by the fact that the programs are “moving in the right direction,” though she concedes that they’re “gaining employers and participants more slowly than most people would have anticipated.” To date, 19 states have established—or enacted legislation to establish—state-run retirement plans, 15 of which are structured as auto-IRA programs. As of Aug. 31, the three largest programs — those in Oregon, Illinois and California — along with more recent programs in Connecticut, Maryland and Colorado, had $991.2 million in assets, covered more than 752,000 savers and worked with more than 177,000 employers, according to the Georgetown University Center for Retirement Initiatives. While industry observers applaud the state programs, they’re rooting for a federal auto-IRA program that Congress has been considering since 2006 but hasn’t yet been able to pass. A federal program would achieve the broad national coverage that has long eluded the industry and drive greater administrative and cost efficiencies than the current state-run programs provide, sources said. “We’re letting a thousand flowers bloom, but all the flowers are tulips and all the tulips are red,” Munnell said of state auto-IRA programs. “All these plans look exactly the same, and it would seem like there’d be economies of scale and a lot of benefits by having a national program rather than state by state.”\n\nNevertheless, for some industry experts, the current defined contribution system — despite its shortcomings — still beats the old defined benefit or traditional pension system that once dominated the workplace. Olivia S. Mitchell, a professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, notes that under the old system workers had to have a full career at a single employer to receive reasonable benefits, a model that simply doesn’t suit most workers in the labor market today. “In my view, the DC system is better for more people than the old DB system, since traditional DB plans only paid benefits to workers who never changed jobs and never quit,” she said. In addition, Mitchell points out that pension plans were — and still often are — underfunded, meaning that retiree benefits can be slashed in the event of a company bankruptcy. Yet, Mitchell still sees room for improvement in the world of defined contribution plans. “If I had one wish, it would be to integrate a deferred annuity into DC plans so that some of the benefits are paid as lifetime income,” she said, adding that SECURE 2.0 enhanced employers’ ability to do this.\n\nBoston College’s Munnell would also like to see annuities added to DC plans to help workers draw down their savings. Workers “clearly are not in the mood of going to an insurance company and buying annuities,” she said. “There has to be some mechanism that they can get annuitized income in some semiautomatic way.” Munnell is also a proponent of having employers adopt a Social Security “bridge” strategy within their 401(k) plans that would allow their retired workers to delay claiming Social Security benefits and thereby increase their monthly payment when they do eventually claim. Under the bridge proposal, employers would distribute payments to retirees from their 401(k) equal to the Social Security benefits those retirees would get if they claimed. This stream of payments would continue as long as the funds set aside for it lasted, or until age 70. The proposal envisions allocating 20% to 40% of a worker’s 401(k) assets to the bridge. “Social Security is the cheapest annuity around and also the best in the sense that it’s fully indexed for inflation,” Munnell said.\n\nThe New School’s Ghilarducci would take the proposal one step further. She supports allowing people to roll over their retirement savings into the Social Security system so they can receive an equivalent benefit until they can claim for a higher benefit. Workers with the median savings of $134,000 may not know how to make the money last the additional years needed to bridge them over to a higher Social Security benefit, Ghilarducci said Let the Social Security system help people “manage the little bit of money that they have because $134,000 isn’t chopped liver,” she said.\n\nGhilarducci points out that most people don’t have access to financial advisers who can tell them how best to manage the funds. “If Social Security is so efficient, why can’t I just put more money into it and get a higher benefit?” she asked.\n\nThe United Auto Workers want something that most Americans don’t have: traditional pension plans. It’s one of the union’s core demands that could help end the strikes at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. But at a time when companies are trying to shed their financial liabilities for workers’ retirement security, some see it as a big ask. UAW talks with those companies have reportedly negotiated wage increases broadly, but none of the big three U.S. automakers has budged on reinstating pension coverage to pre-2007 levels, according to coverage today by Reuters. If UAW succeeded in getting pensions back, it would be a major victory, going entirely against a decades-long trend in U.S. retirement saving.\n\nNot only do most private-sector companies no longer offer defined-benefit plans for new workers, but the majority are tempted to get existing pensions off the books. A recent survey by MetLife found that 89% of employers with pensions are planning to offload those liabilities to insurance companies in the form of group annuities. Over the past year, the rate of companies doing just that has accelerated at record pace as the funded status of their pensions has improved amid higher interest rates, making them eligible for pension-risk transfers.\n\n“Overall, I seriously doubt that any modern firm would want to reinstitute DB plans, due to their high costs, including the high premiums that they would need to pay to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC) for reinsurance. Moreover, DB plans skew their benefit payments toward long-term employees, penalizing anyone who leaves the firm early, needs to take time off for kids or other reasons, and who doesn’t work for the firm for a full career,” Olivia Mitchell, executive director of the Pension Research Council, said in an email. “This isn’t very appealing to many today, given the way the labor market has changed. Including deferred annuities in a 401(k) plan is, to my mind, a much more appealing way to provide secure retirement incomes for a modern workforce.”\n\nIn response to the UAW strikes that started last month, the automakers have noted that they provide 401(k) contributions for workers. As part of its negotiations with UAW, Ford has agreed to increase contributions by an unspecified amount, according to a report Monday by Detroit Free Press. GM told the publication that it contributes an equivalent of 6.4% of pay for hourly employees, while Stellantis indicated that it provides an automatic contribution and subsequent matching contributions.\n\nIt’s hardly news that defined-contribution plans like 401(k)s are the norm, as the burden of saving and investing for retirement is now almost entirely on the shoulders of workers, rather than the companies that employ them. As of March 2022, 15% of private-sector workers had access to traditional pensions, compared with 86% of state and local government employees, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meanwhile, 66% of private-sector workers have defined-contribution plans offered by their employers, and about half of them participate. Total money in defined-contribution plans reached $10.2 trillion as of the second quarter, up from about $6.5 trillion in 2015, according to figures from industry group the Investment Company Institute. Over that period, assets in private-sector defined-benefit plans increased from $2.9 trillion to $3.2 trillion.\n\nWhether workers, including those at UAW, would be better off with pensions or 401(k) plans depends on various factors, including income level, savings ability and, as Mitchell noted, whether they stay at one company for most of their careers. But for many — particularly lower- and middle-income workers — pensions offer a sense of security that 401(k)s have only recently started to try to replicate. Not only do people not have to worry about outliving their investments with a pension, but the employer is responsible for ensuring the plan is solvent.\n\nAnnuities can address that uncertainty for those without pensions, but in most cases people must also research and purchase complex products and ensure during their working years that they directed enough income to a 401(k). While employers simply don’t want to have to worry about being responsible for workers’ retirement security, there’s some research showing that pension plans give them a better bang for the buck than 401(k)s. The data, from pension advocacy group the National Institute on Retirement Security, show cost savings ranging from 27% to 49% for employers that provide a pension rather than a 401(k), as a result of higher investment returns, more diversified portfolios and longevity risk pooling. “Pensions have economies of scale and risk pooling that just can’t be replicated by individual savings accounts,” NIRS executive director Dan Doonan said in a statement at the time the report was published. “At the same time, 401(k)s have made significant progress in recent years when it comes to reducing costs and making investing easier for individuals,” Doonan said. “But the post-retirement period remains difficult to navigate for those in a 401(k) account. Retirees are transitioning from saving to spending down their retirement income at the right rate, so they don’t outlive their savings.”\n\nThe U.S. lags 19 other countries on retirement security — putting it just behind Belgium and ahead of South Korea — despite recent initiatives designed to help expand plan access and encourage workers to save more. The country’s relatively low ranking among other wealthy nations is down two positions from last year, due in part to rising inflation and government debt and lower life expectancy, according to Natixis Investment Managers, which Wednesday issued its annual Global Retirement Index. Across the world, however, “the data presents reasons for renewed optimism about retirement security,” the report noted. “The pandemic is fading in the rearview mirror, inflation is easing in North America and Europe, central bank moves have boosted interest rates, unemployment in key markets is at or near historic lows,” and most countries saw higher scores on retirement. “The U.S. retirement system is built on shaky foundations — retirement accounts are voluntary, which means that most workers and firms don’t contribute, and the commercialized and individualized nature of the accounts means that it is administratively expensive and poorly allocated,” labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci, professor at The New School for Social Research and director of the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis, said in an email. The countries with the best grades for retirement security — Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Ireland — retained the same ranks they saw in Natixis’ report last year. Themes in those countries were high marks for health, quality of life and material well-being. Those three categories, in addition to finances in retirement, are used to assess the overall retirement security for each country, according to Natixis, which built benchmarks for its ongoing index with the help of Core Data Research.\n\nIt’s not a coincidence that a feature of the some of the top-ranked countries is that they have mandatory pensions for citizens, Ghilarducci said. That’s the case in Norway and Switzerland, and most employers in Denmark (10th) and the Netherlands (6th) must also provide pensions. Similarly, Australia (7th) is known for its Superannuation Guarantee, which began more than 30 years ago. Employer- and employee-funded pension systems are effective not only because they ensure coverage and funding, but also because they don’t impact public budgets, Ghilarducci said. Despite getting lower ranking than a year ago, the U.S. has improved on retirement security overall, with higher marks for material well-being. Behind that are declining unemployment rates and stabilizing levels of income inequality, according to Natixis. The country’s position globally in the index this year is the same as it was in 2013. The country’s highest ranking was for finances in retirement (13th), followed by material well-being (21st), quality of life (21st) and health (25th).\n\nNearly half of U.S. investors with at least $100,000 in assets said that inflation “is killing their dreams for retirement,” Natixis stated in an announcement. Additionally, 87% of U.S. retirees said they were worried about inflation. The future solvency of the Social Security system was also a top concern, and more than half of people surveyed said they “expect to make tough choices and tradeoffs” in retirement, such as living frugally, working longer out of necessity and relocating to areas with lower costs of living. However, Social Security offers a lot that systems in other countries don’t, such as providing inflation-indexed lifetime income and strong benefits to spouses of workers (50% benefits) who paid into the system, Olivia Mitchell, professor at The Wharton School and executive director of the Pension Research Council, said in an email. “In the event of the death of the primary earner, the surviving spouse receives 100% of the decedent’s benefits. This is much more generous toward couples than most other developed nations,” Mitchell said. “The U.S. Social Security system also pays benefits that are higher than many perceive, in that a recent study found that the U.S. has the highest score of the elderly reporting they could maintain their standards of living in retirement.” Her top priority for improving retirement security would be restoring Social Security to solvency, she said.\n\nGhilarducci pointed to the Guaranteed Retirement Account design she has championed for years — worker-funded accounts that are professionally managed and pay out in the form of an annuity upon retirement. A bill outlining such accounts was introduced in December, Ghilarducci noted. Other possible improvements include be a national long-term care insurance system, similar to Japan’s, as private coverage in the U.S. is expensive, Mitchell noted. The cost of medical care for retirees in the U.S. is also significantly higher than that for countries across Europe, where few people spend more than $2,000 a year on health care, compared with about 20% here, she said. Recent policy changes to help improve retirement saving could be slow to make much of a difference, she said. While Secure 2.0 will require new 401(k)s to use automatic enrollment, it does not apply to existing plans.\n\n“The 2027 implementation of the bill’s extended Saver’s Tax Credit will likely help the low-income save more in employer-based plans,” Mitchell said. “The opportunity for plan sponsors to match student loan borrowers with 401(k) contributions seems like a useful developments, although it has not yet been implemented.” Meanwhile, state initiatives, such as auto-IRAs, will certainly expand retirement plan coverage, “but workers can still opt out, and my research suggests many w"
