        "text": "NEW OFS v4 is a powerful, easy-to-use tool for viewing and classifying action potential waveforms (spikes) previously collected from single electrodes, stereotrodes and tetrodes. Version 4 is loaded with new sophisticated algorithms and functionality including the ability to analyze overlapping waveforms, perform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) computations, apply high-cut filtering to continuous channels and exploit digital referencing. OFS version 4 is further packed with additional new functionality including but not limited to the ability to load multiple PL2™ files simultaneously; new L-Ratio and Isolation Distance sort quality metrics; support for Band and Line sorting methods; ability to name and manipulate Time Segments and save as NeuroExplorer® files; new scan modes including the ability to scan using different random initial seed clusters; support for multiple spike Sources; ability to display arbitrary combinations for continuous and spike data together for a channel in the Timeline View; the ability to use standard deviation or Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to calculate fit or band fit tolerances and much more.\n\nSpikes are displayed as points in either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) feature space, where a variety of manual, semi-automated or fully-automated clustering techniques can be applied to classify (sort) the spikes. Our spike sorting software can also perform spike extraction on continuously recorded neural data using a variety of different thresholding methods. OFS allows sorting verification through a variety of displays and can calculate cluster separation statistics and sort quality metrics. The sorted spikes can be exported in several formats for subsequent analysis.\n\nThe parameter space for several fully automatic spike sorting algorithms can be systematically scanned with graphs displaying the sort quality metric as a function of the varied parameters. The results of the automated scanning through sorting parameter space can be saved in a SCAN file. Combined with new batch mode commands, this process allows the running of various sorting algorithms, which is followed by rapid manual viewing of different sort outcomes and selection of the appropriate sort for each channel.\n\nOFS also contains new time-segmented views of the waveforms with cluster vs. time and sort quality vs. time views that show how the waveforms change and evolve. Multiple methods for spike detection in continuously digitized data files can be used, including voltage threshold, signal energy and nonlinear energy. Additionally, stereotrode and tetrode spike detection is supported. A low-cut filter may be applied to the continuous data prior to spike extraction.\n\nPowerful Waveform Viewing and Sorting\n\nNEW Overlapping waveform analysis\n\nNEW Ability to display arbitrary (compatible) combinations of continuous and spike data for a channel together in the Timeline View which replaces the need to associate channels during loading of .PLX files or during channel remapping\n\nNEW Support for multiple spike Sources\n\nManual cluster selection in 3D feature space using principal component projections, voltage slices in time, or more than 20 other waveform features such as peak, valley, full-width at half maximum, etc.\n\nBox sorting as a pair of time-level windows\n\nWaveform selection in time-voltage space\n\nTemplate matching algorithm\n\nTetrode and Stereotrode waveform extraction and sorting using any method\n\nUnit cross-correlograms and ISI plots\n\nWaveform density plots in 2D or 3D in any feature space\n\nWaveform alignment\n\nInterval invalidation and artifact removal\n\nRaster displays of spikes and continuous data\n\nPrintable Sorting Summary View with export to PowerPoint®\n\nWaveform features and statistics can be easily exported to MATLAB®, Excel® or text file\n\nExport of sorted data to NeuroExplorer®\n\nSave and recall particular sorting instances for a selected channel (useful for comparisons)\n\nTime Segmentation, Adaptive Sorting Methods, and Time-Dependent Analysis\n\nNEW Time Segments can be named and individually colored and toggled on/off, and can be saved/restored as NeuroExplorer Intervals\n\nNEW Interval Selection tool can create Time Segments\n\nNEW Ability to load multiple .PL2 files simultaneously\n\nDivide each file into time segments and view and sort waveforms from each time segment separately\n\nClusters vs. Time View to show how clusters evolve as a function of time\n\nSort Quality View vs. Time Segment Graph View to display how the sort quality changes through the file\n\nAdaptive template sorting, with the templates changing over time to follow the waveform as it evolves\n\nTemplate vs. Time View to display how the template adapted through the file\n\nSemi-Automatic and Automatic Sorting\n\nNEW Added L-Ratio and Isolation Distance sort quality metrics\n\nNEW Support for Lines and Bands in Change Sort Method\n\nNEW Scan modes, including ability to scan using different random initial seed clusters\n\nNEW Can use standard deviation or MAD to calculate fit tolerances or band fit tolerances\n\nEnhanced automatic sorting methods with systematic scanning through parameter space and graphs displaying the sort quality metric as a function of the parameters that were varied; select the best sorting according to a selected sort quality metric\n\nAutomatic sort scan results for each channel can be saved to and loaded from .SCAN files.
