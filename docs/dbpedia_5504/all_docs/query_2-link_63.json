        "text": "What a race of ups and downs this race 11 is proving to be!\n\nWe started with lots of ups and downs in terms of sea state, lots of crashing and bumping over the swells and waves, back to that Life on the Lean. For the RTW and multi-leggers, it was 'here we go again' but for our new leggers (Sheila, John, Jane and Richard) it was their first experience of such conditions. The first part of Leg 7, Race 10 from Seattle to Panama, had been much kinder and calmer, and the nearest version of champagne sailing you can get when racing around the world.\n\nThose rougher seas led to ups and downs in terms of food, yes – I mean seasickness, with several grabbing sick bags regularly. So horrible for people to have to go through, and there I was again going on about hydration etc, asking all about their urine colour and volume, such fascinating lines of conversation we medics have to undertake. I am glad to say that everyone did recover after a few days, although one person got somewhat dehydrated and only the threat of “if you haven't pee-d within the next 2 hrs then it will be rectal fluids to remedy the situation” really upped the motivation to drink and the issue was resolved without such treatment being necessary!\n\nLife on the lean, sea sickness, lack of sleep etc have also led to emotional ups and downs too – but that is all part of the journey. Everyone has good and bad days, sometimes a bit quiet and withdrawn, occasionally tearful, or swearing with sheer frustration when on Mother Watch duty in the galley on rough days. You will know from previous blogs over the past 9 months exactly what that means. Ups and downs even applies to the food that leaps off the work surfaces etc. Ups and downs of the whole crew mood are usually related to our current position, eagerly awaited in each 6 hourly schedule.\n\nThere have been ups and downs in wind speeds and direction too, is the wind backing or is it veering, and mostly – is it going in the direction we want it to? Is it getting stronger or weaker. We have had great winds and reached speeds of 21 kts, and then we have had those winds that mean we are struggling to do 5 kts.\n\nAll the fluctuating winds, and our determination to try and stay near the top of the fleet, has meant that there have been huge ups and downs of Yankee 1, Yankee 2, Code 1 2 or 3, the anti-wrap net, the staysail, the mainsail via putting in a reef or shaking one out. Some watches have been nonstop sail changes as we try to keep the boat moving as fast as conditions will allow.\n\nThe most significant ups and downs have applied to our race position, as those of you addicted to the Race Viewer will know. After the Le Mans start we were soon in eighth, but gradually saw our position improve until we were second for some days, and for a glorious few hours and more importantly, in writing in an official 6 hourly 'scheds', even first. As I write this on Wednesday 13th June, we have been disappointed by the wind not doing as expected as early as it should, and seeing Sanya Serenity Coast and Unicef go past us to the west, so we are currently in fourth. Now, on our past records, we should be pleased about that, but WE WANT A PODIUM PLACE! We will keep on trying until that finish line is crossed.\n\nWe have 25 miles to go and the atmosphere on board is electric as we try to claw back into third place, virtually neck and neck with Unicef. Everyone is determined and excited, everyone is working hard, concentrated and focussed. There is fog outside so we cannot see other Clipper Race yachts, only on the TIMEZERO down in the Nav station. We have had to call the odd fishing vessel that looked as if it might get right in the way and politely explain what we are doing, and please could they keep out of the way? So weird, this ocean racing – up on deck you have no idea where the actual finish line is, just how far left to go to a virtual line created by the Clipper Race as the finish line as Dave calls this out. Down in the Nav station you can see that line, marked yellow on our TIMEZONE system, and feel the tension of watching our AIS and Unicef's as we both try to beat each other to that mythical yellow line. Oh the fog is clearing, and is that Unicef off our port quarter – yes it is! Just keep going, and DO NOT MESS ANYTHING UP RIGHT NOW.\n\nUp or down, deck or Nav station it is tension, tension, tension. Focus, focus, focus. Excitement, excitement, excitement – can we do this, YES, we have to believe we can. Or sneaking trepidation, will Unicef just beat us, OH NO. NO NO NO. We HAVE to do this, the GREAT Britain team can.\n\nI keep popping up and down from deck to Nav station and vice versa (and occasionally to the galley to check on lunch, now delayed until we cross that finish line). Being Mother today means I get the fun of being able to pop between both places, whereas no one else can! The tension on deck is palpable, whatever role is being carried out. Phil is on the helm, with Nic second helming. Beanie is managing the active spinnaker sheet, with Pip shouting grind from by the mast. Jayne, Faith, Jon M and Ray are standing over the coffee grinders, poised to react in milliseconds. Others have already taken their turn on the coffee grinders, and on changing move to the high side of the boat. Sheila, Jane L, Richard, John Mac are currently perched by the guard rail on the high side, but ready to leap onto coffee grinders again if others start to fatigue. Luise is in the Nav station with Alex, our fabulous additional qualified person, and is monitoring distance from the finish line for both GREAT Britain and Unicef, every 5 minutes. They have the luxury of being able to munch some crisps in between biting their nails, whilst everyone else on deck has to ignore their rumbling stomachs for a few more miles. Skipper Dave is standing behind the port helm, constantly in VHF contact with the Nav station. Every mile completed is called out. Creaks and groans as the main is being let out a little. The race ain't over until that finish line is crossed.\n\nOf course we are thrilled that we will soon be in New York. Maybe even a day AHEAD of the arrival window, now that has never happened before. What a novelty to savour, whatever our race position ends up being. A full-length stopover, we might even get to see more of New York than deep clean, maintenance and repairs, corporate activations etc. Things are definitely on the UP.\n\nAnd the last thing that is up and down – over the past 24 hours and more, but especial right now really UP, (but I am not allowed to measure it., of course!) our Skipper's blood pressure, I am sure!\n\nMaybe yours is too, if you are currently watching the Race Viewer and this nail biting race for a podium place?\n\nAs for me, enough of writing this blog, I am going to keep popping UP on deck and DOWN to the Nav station to join in the fun!\n\nLove from Tessa\n\nPS extra love and hugs to all my family and friends, and all those who are following me on this race and living the race vicariously. Thanks for all your love and support\n\n18.18:47 Zulu YAAAAAAHHHHHHH! WE DID IT! WE DID IT! WE DID IT!\n\nWe crossed that line before Unicef, the deck and Nav station erupted. Everyone jumping, shouting, cheering, Dave like a demented lunatic! All of us like demented lunatics!\n\nThe GREAT Britain team – podium place in Race 10, podium place in Race 11, even third in the Race 11 Elliot Brown Ocean Sprint. Three times three, we cannot believe it. We showed any doubters; the GREAT Britain team are back in this race.\n\nWhat's more, the ONLY team to win TWO podium places on Leg 7, prize giving night in New York is going to be AMAZING!!"
