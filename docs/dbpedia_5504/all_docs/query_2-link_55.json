        "text": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nForage characteristics.\n\nillustrates the chemical compositions and microbial counts of SSG harvested at various times within a day. Compared to AM-cut SSG, M- and PM-cut SSG had higher (P < 0.05) DM contents, which could be linked to the loss of morning dew. SSG accumulates sucrose as the principal reserve carbohydrate (16). It was accountable for the increases in WSC contents with the delay of harvest time. Photosynthesis provides the plant energy and carbon skeletons for nitrogen assimilation. Not only photosynthate but also nitrogen component will accumulate under the light condition (17). In the present study, significant accumulation of crude protein (CP) was observed in PM-cut SSG while not in M-cut SSG, suggesting that the nitrogen assimilation rate was low between AM and M. Similarly, Burns et al. (5) observed a first decline of CP content in alfalfa from 07:00 to 13:00 h and then an increase through 19:00 h. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) contents decreased in PM-cut SSG than in AM- and M-cut SSG, which could be associated with the dilutive effect of carbohydrate accumulation on other components. This was consistent with the results of Burns et al. (5) and Guo et al. (18).\n\nTABLE 1\n\nItem07:00 h (AM)12:00 h (M)17:00 h (PM)SEMP valueChemical composition (g/kg DM, unless stated otherwise) Dry matter (% FW)19.6b20.8a21.8a0.4710.009 Crude protein58.5b51.3b69.3a3.6400.008 Water-soluble carbohydrates78.0c106b139a12.170.013 Neutral detergent fiber642a636a560b12.280.001 Acid detergent fiber410a411a346b9.5610.001 Buffering capacity (mEq/kg DM)1331091192.9900.210Microbial counts (log10CFU/g FW) Lactic acid bacteria6.67a2.52b<2.00c0.7490.001 Aerobic bacteria7.67a8.08a6.97b0.1630.010 Yeast7.21a6.70a5.77b0.179<0.001 Coliform7.18a7.60a3.80b0.5620.003\n\nPhyllosphere microbes exist mainly on leaf surfaces, a hostile location for microbial colonization. The population and community of phyllosphere bacteria are affected by the fluctuations in the nutritional conditions of the phyllosphere, which is characterized by rapid changes in temperature, relative humidity of the environment, and UV dose (19, 20). As shown in , lactic acid bacteria (LAB) counts decreased more than other microbes with the delay of harvest time, reflecting their weakest ability against the diurnal fluctuations. LAB have complex nutritional requirements and lack the strategy to cope with the adverse environmental factors (21, 22). It was assumed that UV radiation might be the most important environmental factor in affecting LAB’s population because they are usually observed to be in lower counts in the top of the forage plant (23).\n\nFermentation parameters, chemical composition, and microbial counts.\n\nThe fermentation parameters during ensiling of SSG harvested at various times within a day are shown in . The initial LAB count of preensiled forage is a critical factor in producing high-quality silage. Low LAB initial counts imply more duplication cycles required to reach the threshold number for initiating intense lactic fermentation. This explained why higher (P < 0.05) pH and lower (P < 0.05) lactic acid contents were observed in M and PM silages compared to AM silage during the initial 7 days of ensiling. Although there were lags in fermentation, silages harvested at various times showed no differences in pH and lactic acid contents after 7 days. It was because the high WSC content in SSG provided sufficient fermentable sugars for LAB and sustained the desirable fermentation type. Lactic acid is the main driver of lowering pH in silage. Generally speaking, desired pH values is approximately 3.8 to 4.2 for high-quality silage. However, all SSG silages had extremely low pH values less than 3.50 after 60 days of ensiling. Moreover, compared to AM silage, the final pH values of M and PM silages were even lower (3.18 for M and 3.16 for PM), although there was no difference in lactic acid production. This unnormal pH values was likely associated with the presence of strong acids in silage. Sorghum are the forage type conductive to accumulate high levels of nitrate (24). During ensiling microorganisms such as enterobacteria can convert nitrate to nitrogen dioxide, which reacts with water to form nitric acid. In this study, although nitrogen dioxide was not measured, the lower pH values in M and PM silages might be an indication of greater breakdown of nitrate to nitrogen dioxide. This could be a potential danger to human and livestock because nitrogen dioxide produced during ensiling is a “toxic silo gas,” which would damage the lung and cause pulmonary edema, bronchiolitis, and even death in severe cases (25).\n\nTABLE 2\n\nItem/harvest\n\ntimeEnsiling day (d)SEMP value137143060HDH × DpH value 7:00 (AM)4.15b,A3.65c,B3.53B,C3.64B3.65B3.43a,C0.0810.003<0.001<0.001 12:00 (M)5.03a,A3.86b,B3.49B,C3.58B3.54B,C3.18b,C 17:00 (PM)5.16a,A4.16a,B3.53C3.59C3.49C3.16b,DLactic acid (g/kg DM) 7:00 (AM)41.1a,B71.7a,A82.4A75.2A68.5A80.1A8.0460.550<0.0010.25 12:00 (M)19.4b,C44.1b,B,C82.6A91.2A72.1A,B80.1A 17:00 (PM)19.6b,B37.7b,B75.6A85.2A64.0A67.3AAcetic acid (g/kg DM) 7:00 (AM)15.0a,B18.0a,B20.5a,B19.7a,B32.3a,A22.6a,B1.485<0.001<0.0010.001 12:00 (M)10.5b,C12.3b,B,C13.5b,A,B15.4b,A15.2b,A13.7b,A,B 17:00 (PM)9.85b,B10.0b,B14.5b,A14.6b,A13.7b,A12.3b,A,BLactic acid/acetic acid 7:00 (AM)2.74a,A,B4.00A4.01b,A3.84b,A,B2.44b,B3.54b,A,B0.538<0.001<0.0010.037 12:00 (M)1.82b,C3.65B,C6.05a,A5.98a,A4.85a,A,B5.80a,A 17:00 (PM)2.00a,b,C3.79B5.25a,b,A,B5.84a,A4.66a,A,B5.44a,APropionic acid (g/kg DM) 7:00 (AM)11.1a,A10.7a,A,B10.6A,B10.2a,B11.2a,A10.5a,A,B0.284<0.0010.0010.183 12:00 (M)9.40b,B9.29b,B9.93B9.72a,b,B10.9a,b,A9.86a,B 17:00 (PM)9.54b,A,B8.89b,A,B9.61A,B9.38b,A,B9.88b,A8.68b,BEthanol (g/kg DM) 7:00 (AM)14.8a21.615.815.3a15.4b19.64.3770.0370.2490.507 12:00 (M)12.4a,b32.114.517.1a22.8a16.9 17:00 (PM)11.4b10.213.411.6b14.4b14.8\n\nAcetic acid is the acid found in the second highest content in silage, generally originating from the metabolism of hetero-fermentative LAB in well-preserved silages (2). The acetic acid contents increased in AM silage, indicating the activity of heterofermentative LAB during ensiling. The fact that the first increase and then decrease in lactic/acetic acid ratios also confirmed that there was a remarkable conversion from homolactic fermentation to heterolactic fermentation in AM silage during ensiling. Heterolactic fermentation is less efficient than homolactic fermentation and may cause some DM loss. However, acetic acid produced in this process is more antimycotic than lactic acid (26). For silages of corn and sorghum that are very sensitive to aerobic deterioration, the increases in acetic acid contents are valuable because small increases in fermentative DM losses can be readily offset by substantial improvement in aerobic stability of silage during feed-out (26). By contrast, M and PM silages maintained low acetic acid contents and high lactic/acetic acid ratios, suggesting the predominance of homolactic fermentation during ensiling.\n\nThe propionic acid and butyric acid are unacceptable fermentation products in silages given that their generation is an energy-waste metabolism. The absence of butyric acid and little production of propionic acid suggested that extensive secondary fermentation did not occur during ensiling. Ethanol is also undesirable in preserving forage because its production causes extremely high losses of DM and energy. Over 30 to 40 g/kg DM production is usually considered to be associated with the action of yeasts (1). In the present study, all silages had an ethanol content less than 20 g/kg DM, suggesting that microbes such as heterolactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria are the main bacteria responsible for the ethanol production in SSG silage.\n\nThe chemical compositions and microbial counts during ensiling of SSG harvested at various times within a day are given in . The DM contents were statistically and numerically higher in M and PM silages than AM silage, which was consistent with DM contents in the raw materials. During ensiling, proteolysis by plant and microbial enzymes will lower the nutritive value of ensiled forage by degrading protein into nonprotein fractions, such as peptides, free amino acid, and NH3. Typically, satisfying level of NH3-N in quality silage should be less than 100 to 150 g/kg total nitrogen (TN) (1). The low NH3-N contents of all SSG silages suggested that forage protein was well preserved during ensiling. The WSC decreased rapidly during the initial 7 days, which coincided with the lactic acid production and pH declines. It suggested that WSC was mainly consumed by LAB for lactic acid production. After 60 days of ensiling more residual WSC was observed in the PM silage (P < 0.05). It could be due to the excessively high WSC content in PM-cut SSG, resulting in more WSC retained in the final silage. Higher residual WSC is nutritionally desirable as it is rapidly digestible in the rumen (27). However, it also carries a higher risk of yeast spoilage at silage opening considering that not enough antifungal agent acetic acid was present in the PM silage.\n\nTABLE 3\n\nItem/harvest timeEnsiling day (d)SEMP value137143060HDH × DDM (% FW) 7:00 (AM)18.7b,A,B19.0c,A,B19.0b,A,B19.7b,A18.1b,B19.3b,A,B0.520<0.001<0.0010.370 12:00 (M)21.5a,A21.6b,A20.3a,b,A,B20.8a,b,A,B19.4a,b,B21.1a,b,A,B 17:00 (PM)21.3a,B22.8a,A,B21.2a,B22.0a,A,B20.8a,B23.4a,ANH3-N (g/kg TN) 7:00 (AM)58.490.376.056.868.188.22.4810.1340.0160.169 12:00 (M)48.254.569.183.964.575.5 17:00 (PM)39.0C64.4B90.1A61.9B,C45.8B,C61.2B,CWSC (g/kg DM) 7:00 (AM)45.2c,A16.5c,B,C8.29c,C11.1b,B,C11.2b,B,C20.6b,B8.492<0.001<0.0010.012 12:00 (M)81.9b,A32.0b,B22.4b,B20.2b,B21.9b,B26.2b,B 17:00 (PM)138a,A87.1a,B,C49.5a,C76.1a,B,C80.0a,A,B55.9a,CLAB, (log10 cfu/g FW) 7:00 (AM)7.82a,A8.96A8.42A8.34A4.72a,B5.32a,B<0.001<0.001<0.001<0.001 12:00 (M)6.04b,C8.97A8.71A8.26B<2.00b,D<2.00b,D 17:00 (PM)6.17b,C8.64A8.73A8.13B<2.00b,D<2.00b,DColiform (log10 cfu/g FW) 7:00 (AM)<2.00b,B<2.00b,B<2.00b,B2.97A<2.00B<2.00B0.764<0.001<0.001<0.001 12:00 (M)6.62a,A4.44a,A,B4.58a,A,B2.47B<2.00C<2.00C 17:00 (PM)6.73a,A3.61a,B<2.00b,C3.57B<2.00C<2.00CAerobic bacteria (log10 cfu/g FW) 7:00 (AM)<2.00c,C<2.00C3.18A2.99a,B<2.00B,C<2.00B,C0.9120.002<0.001<0.001 12:00 (M)7.51a,A<2.00C3.71A2.97a,B3.64B<2.00C 17:00 (PM)7.25b,A2.03B5.36A2.40b,B<2.00C<2.00C\n\nThe LAB is a group of Gram-positive, low guanine-cytosine containing, nonmotile, non-spore- forming, aerotolerant bacteria, which produce lactic acid as the major end product of the carbohydrate’s fermentation. The rapid increase in LAB counts during the initial stages of ensiling indicated that LAB effectively utilized WSC for their proliferation ( ). However, LAB counts decreased dramatically after 30 days of ensiling, suggesting that the extremely low pH developed in the silage suppressed not only undesirable bacteria but also LAB. Similarly, Sun et al. (28) have reported a decrease in LAB counts in whole-plant corn silage when pH declined to 4.0 at the late stage of ensiling. The lower pH values might also explain the lower LAB counts in M and PM silages than AM silage after 30 days of ensiling. The acidic and anaerobic conditions of silage are unsuitable for most undesirable bacteria. It was thus expected for the overall decreasing tendency in counts of coliform and aerobic bacteria during ensiling. The fast-initial acidification is the key to inhibiting the growth of coliform in silage (24). The slower rates of pH decline may result in higher coliform counts in M and PM silages compared to AM silage at the initial stages of ensiling.\n\nBacterial diversity and community.\n\nEnsiling is a bacterial-driven process in which the types and abundances of bacteria involved play a critical role in fermentation quality. In this study, fresh-cut SSG and silage samples on days 1, 3, and 60 of ensiling were selected for bacterial community analysis considering that these time points may better reflect different fermentation stages. As a result, a total of 1,870,682 high-quality reads from the V3 to V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence were obtained. The average length of the reads was 426 bp. Based on a 97% sequence identity threshold, these reads were clustered into 1,210 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Generally, the diversely microbial communities in crops were formed in the field, when the stable environment is disturbed, better-adapted microbes would dominate in the new environment. Analogously, silage is new environment for various microorganisms present in fresh crops. It favors the growth of LAB while excludes some microbiota that are unsuitable for the fermentation system. This explained the initial drops in diversity index (Shannon) and species richness estimates (ACE, Chao1, and OTU number) after the onset of ensiling ( ). After 60 days of ensiling, bacterial diversity index was higher in M and PM silages than AM silage. High-quality silage is generally characterized by low bacterial diversity due to LAB dominance. The higher bacterial diversity indicated complex bacterial communities and was likely associated with the declines of LAB population at the late stage of ensiling.\n\nPrincipal coordinate analysis (PCoA) analysis was used to explore the similarities or dissimilarities of bacterial communities ( ). The AM- and M-cut fresh SSG plots were clustered together, suggesting a high degree of similarity of bacterial communities. The AM- and M-cut SSG cluster were far from that of PM-cut SSG, suggesting that bacterial communities of PM-cut SSG differed from those of AM- and M-cut SSG. Clear separations between fresh and silage samples suggested that ensiling greatly altered the bacterial community. The AM, M, and PM silage samples distinctly clustered away from each other during the first 3 days, suggesting that harvest time had a clear impact on the bacterial community during the early stages of ensiling. After 60 days of ensiling, M and PM silage samples clustered together and were far from AM silage samples. It suggested that M and PM silages had similar final bacterial communities, which were different from that of AM silage. Silage bacteria are derived and developed from the epiphytic microbiota. Therefore, silage bacteria are highly relevant with the bacterial species in epiphytic microbiota. It has to be noted that, although AM- and M-cut SSG had a similar epiphytic microbiota, they were also different in bacterial community composition during ensiling. It suggested that the bacterial community structure during ensiling was largely shaped by the population dynamics of a small group of bacteria (e.g., LAB) rather than the predominant bacteria in the epiphytic microbiota.\n\nProteobacteria is a major phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that includes a wide variety of pathogenic genera. As displayed in , all fresh SSG were dominated by Proteobacteria, suggesting the presence of large number of undesirable microorganisms in SSG. After ensiling, Firmicutes increased dramatically and became the most abundant phylum in SSG silage. Microorganisms belonging to Firmicutes are crucial acid-hydrolytic microbes under anaerobic circumstances. They can produce various proteases, lipases, cellulases and other enzymes. As all LAB belong to Firmicutes, the dramatic increase in the abundance of Firmicutes indicated rapid LAB development during ensiling. However, for M and PM silages, Proteobacteria again replaced Firmicutes as the dominant phylum at the end of ensiling, suggesting the failure of LAB to dominate the microbiota in the final silage.\n\nThe bacterial community structures on genus level in raw material and silage are shown in . The most dominant genus in AM-cut SSG was Acinetobacter, while in M and PM-cut SSG were Pantoea and Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, respectively. It suggested that epiphytic microbiota structure was highly dynamic during the day. The relative abundances of Acinetobacter, unclassified_f_Enterobacteriaceae, and Weissella decreased with the delay of harvest time ( ), which might be a result of extensive killing of these bacteria under diurnal environmental stresses. By contrast, the relative abundances of bacteria, such as Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Pantoea, Bacillus, and Sphingomonas, increased during the day ( ). Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Pantoea, and Bacillus are composed of a variety of pigmented bacteria and most species are shown to be UV resistant (29, 30). Sphingomonas can produce TonB-dependent transport systems to scavenge various nutrients which are present at low concentrations (31). The enrichment of these bacteria could be attributed to their efficient strategies to resist the diurnal environmental stresses. Pantoea and Bacillus were most abundant in M-cut SSG, while Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum and Sphingomonas were most abundant in PM-cut SSG. This suggested that the main environmental driver of population dynamics may vary between these two bacterial groups.\n\nEstablishment of a microbial community dominated by LAB during the fermentation phase is the key to successful ensiling. In agreement with other forage crops (32), LAB represent only a very small fraction of the epiphytic microbiota of SSG (<3%) ( ). After the onset of ensiling, Weissella and Lactococcus quickly dominated the microbiota. On day 1 of ensiling, Weissella was more abundant in AM and M silage, and Lactococcus was more abundant in PM silage ( ). Weissella is strictly a heterofermentative LAB, producing a mixture of lactic acid and acetic acid by metabolizing WSC, and it is the prevailing identifiable genus in untreated silages (33). Lactococcus was mostly identified as homofermentative LAB and was abundant in a wide variety of silages (34). Weissella and Lactococcus are LAB contributing to the initial decline in silage pH, but they are not as acid resistant as Lactobacillus. After 3 days of ensiling, Lactobacillus started to dominate the AM silage. Members of Lactobacillus are Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, rods, or coccobacilli. It can quickly ferment a wide variety of substrates, contributing substantially to the acid accumulation and pH decline to levels <4.5 (35). Therefore, Lactobacillus is the main active ingredient of silage inoculant often used to promote successful ensiling (36, 37). Compared to AM silage, M and PM silages had higher abundances of Pediococcus on d 3 of ensiling. Pediococcus is homofermentative LAB and grow faster than Lactobacillus (38). Some species of Pediococcus show high acid tolerance (39) and are also effective in improving silage quality whereby lactic acid production (40). At the late stage of ensiling, the dominating role of Lactobacillus plantarum was replaced by Lactobacillus crustorum in AM silage ( ). Lactobacillus plantarum is practically classified as homofermentative LAB fermenting hexoses to exclusively lactic acid. Nevertheless, Lactobacillus crustorum is heterofermenters producing mixed acids including lactic acid and acetic acid (41). The prevalence of Lactobacillus crustorum in AM silage could explain why metabolic pathway shifted from homofermentative to heterofermentative at the late stage of ensiling.\n\nThe relative abundance of Klebsiella increased from AM to PM silage on day 1 ( ). Klebsiella is a group of rod-shaped bacteria of family enterobacteriaceae. Its higher abundance was consistent with the higher enterobacterial counts at the initial stage of ensiling in M and PM silages. Enterobacteria represent a minor part of the epiphytic microbiota, but they usually present in significantly higher numbers than LAB in the initial few hours after the onset of ensiling (28). Fast initial acidification is the key to controlling their growth in silage, and when fermentation is delayed, they may develop into large numbers (24). Some species of Klebsiella are found to produce 1,3-propanediol during fermentation (42), and some produce propanediol and butyric acid, which are not desirable indicators for silage quality (43). Klebsiella also destabilizes the aerobic stability of silage, and some species are opportunistic pathogens, which can cause mastitis in animals (44). Delftia dominated the microbiota of M and PM silages at the end of ensiling ( and ). Delftia was rarely reported in silages, and this is the first report on its dominance in silage. Members of Delftia are nonfermentative, chemo-organotrophic rods that are commonly found in soil, in water, and on plants. It can degrade phenolic compounds and aniline in polluted soil and water (30, 45). Also, Delftia has been reported as a nitrate reducer contributing to the reduction of nitrate to nitrite in wastewater and activated sludge (46). However, unlike enterobacteria, Delftia cannot further reduce nitrite. This may directly result in considerable accumulation of nitrite in the silage. Under acidic conditions, nitrite is chemically unstable and can be converted to nitrogen oxides, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric oxide (1), which may account for the unnormal lower pH values in M and PM silages at the late stage of ensiling.\n\nMethylobacterium-Methylorubrum was more abundant in M and PM silages than AM silage at the end of ensiling ( ). It was consistent with the higher abundances in the M and PM-cut SSG, suggesting that some diurnally enriched bacteria could survive in silage and possibly serve as a source of bacteria for silage at the late stage of ensiling. Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum is Gram-negative, rod-shaped, and strictly aerobic bacteria that can utilize methanol and other reduced one-carbon compounds via the serine pathway. Usually, microbes of this genus are neutrophilic and their abundance decreases as pH declines. It is unclear why Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum was still detected in large quantities in M and PM silages (5.74% in M and 14.1% in PM) at the end of ensiling. Similarly, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum has been also found to be abundant in alfalfa silage after 100 days of ensiling (47). However, to date its role in silage fermentation is less known.\n\nDespite not being statistically significant, other bacteria, such as Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, and Bacillus, were more abundant in M and PM silages than AM silage ( ). Acinetobacter species are aerobic, nonfermenting bacteria that can be found in different environments. Some Acinetobacter species can survive in anaerobic environment in the presence of acetate as a substrate (48). They were reported to link the aerobic deterioration (49) and DM losses (50) in silages. Enhydrobacter is a Gram-negative, nonmotile, facultative anaerobe belonging to the Moraxellaceae family. This genus differs from other species in intracellular gas vacuoles (51). Enhydrobacter ferments sugars anaerobically and organic acids aerobically, suggesting that the presence of this bacterium may be undesirable for silage quality and aerobic stability at silage opening. Members of Bacillus are endospore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Some species of this genus can produce cellulase or other enzymes like α-amylase and feruloyl esterase to degrade plant structural carbohydrates during ensiling (52, 53). The Bacillus species also produces lactic acid but is generally less efficient than LAB. The genus Bacillus is a diverse group of spore-forming bacteria. The spores can contaminate milk after passing through the alimentary tract of dairy cows (54).\n\nInteraction between bacteria and relationship between bacterial community and fermentation parameters.\n\nMicrobial communities are complex multispecies assemblages that are characterized by a multitude of interspecies interactions. These bacterial interactions sustain key evolutionary and ecological processes in all environments. Recently, correlation network analysis has been applied to the silage system to detect significant patterns of copresence and mutual exclusion between bacterial taxa (14, 36). LAB is generally identified as the dominant taxa in silage fermentation as they reduce pH and inhibit the survival of undesirable microorganisms. As shown in , Lactobacillus had negative correlations with many bacterial genera in AM silage. It suggested that Lactobacillus had played a key role in excluding other bacteria during ensiling. This was consistent with numerous studies demonstrating that inoculation of Lactobacillus can easily change the bacterial community composition and their succession in silages (36, 37). In comparison, Weissella and Pediococcus were the LAB genera with notable negative correlations with other bacteria in M and PM silage, respectively. Weissella grows only at pH > 4.5. As ensiling progressed, the decreased abundance of Weissella suggests a diminished influence on controlling undesirable microorganisms. Likewise, the growth of most Pediococcus species will cease at pH <4.5 although some species have been shown to endure low pH (39). This suggests that it may be also not as effective as Lactobacillus in establishing dominance during ensiling. However, it is difficult to explain why the main LAB species that drove the succession of bacterial community varied among the three silages. This was probably related with their changes in absolute quantities in fresh SSG during the day. Since there are few lactobacilli on plants (38), small changes in the initial population may affect the rate and extent of lactobacilli to dominate the microbiota during ensiling.\n\nStudying the correlations between bacterial community and silage characteristics would give us a deep understanding of the key bacteria to silage quality. In the current study, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) analysis and Spearman’s correlation heatmap were used to explore the correlations between fermentation characteristics and top 15 genera ( and ). The CCA suggested that there were considerable associations between silage microbial communities and fermentation parameters. The biplot score showed 23.5 and 16.4% of community differentiation by CCA1 and CCA2, respectively. The top 15 genera were divided into three clusters, and their succession was significantly related to pH (r2 = 0.708, P = 0.001), DM (r2 = 0.337, P = 0.011), NH3-N (r2 = 0.404, P = 0.002), WSC (r2 = 0.396, P = 0.002), lactic acid (r2 = 0.762, P = 0.001), acetic acid (r2 = 0.814, P = 0.001), lactic/acetic acid ratio (r2 = 0.739, P = 0.001), and propionic acid (r2 = 0.266, P = 0.023). The first cluster included Lactobacillus, and the second cluster included Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, and Deftia. The remaining genera all belonged to the third cluster. The Spearman’s correlation heatmap revealed that Lactobacillus was associated with high contents of acetic acid and NH3-N. This could be associated with the shift of Lactobacillus from Lactobacillus plantarum to Lactobacillus crustorum on species level during ensiling. Heterofermentative lactobacillus species can produce acetic acid as its main fermentation product and overcome the inhibitory effect of low pH by producing ammonia via the arginine deiminase pathway(55). Besides Lactobacillus, Delftia, Acinetobacter, and Enhydrobacter were also negatively correlated with pH and positively correlated with lactic acid and lactic/acetic acid ratio. Genomic analysis showed that Delftia has the potential to conduct l-lactic acid fermentation process using l-fucose as a carbon source (56). The positive correlation of lactic acid with Delftia suggested it may also have contributed to a small amount of lactic acid production at the late stage of ensiling. However, there were no reports of Acinetobacter and Enhydrobacter in lactic acid production. Acinetobacter and Enhydrobacter can tolerate extremely low pH. Their positive correlations with lactic acid might be a result of multicollinearity between pH and lactic acid variables. The cocci LAB and most enterobacteria are sensitive to pH declines (24). This explained why Lactococcus, Weissella, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella were positively correlated with pH and negatively correlated with lactic acid. Pediococcus strains are more tolerant of high DM conditions than other LAB (38). Positive correlation between Pediococcus and DM content suggests that the increased DM content of SSG in the day may have promoted the development of Pediococcus during ensiling.\n\nKyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes metabolic pathways of bacterial community in the raw materials and silages.\n\nThe fermentation process in silage is mediated by microbial activities through complicated metabolic pathways to degrade substrates or transform metabolites. Predicting the metabolic potentials is conducive to assess the influence of microbes on silage fermentation that is unable to be reflected by the dynamics of bacterial communities. Here, we used Tax4Fun tool to predict the changes in metabolic profiles of the bacterial community in raw materials and silages. The changes of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways on the first level in raw material and silage are displayed in . In fresh SSG, “Metabolism,” “Genetic Information Processing,” and “Organismal Systems” of bacterial community downregulated with the delay of harvest time. The aerial part of plant is a dynamic niche where the microorganisms are exposed to fluxes in temperature, moisture, and UV during the day. The downregulation of these metabolism categories indicated that the diurnal environmental fluctuations affected the microbial survivability on leaf surface and caused a decreased level in metabolic capacity of the epiphytic microbiota. Some bacteria have adaptive strategies to deal with multiple environmental stresses. The enrichment of these bacteria might be responsible for the upregulated pathways including “Environmental adaptation” and “Cellular Processes” during the day. Ensiling downregulated “Metabolism”, “Cellular Processes”, and “Organismal Systems”, and upregulated “Genetic Information Processing”. This could be associated with the inhibition of undesirable microorganism in fresh SSG and the promotion of LAB proliferation during ensiling. When silage is well fermented and fermentation enters a stable phase, there will be minimal changes in metabolic activity in silage. At the late stage of ensiling, metabolic pathways such as “Metabolism”, “Cellular Processes”, and “Organismal Systems” upregulated in M and PM silages and the relative abundances of these pathways were highest in M silage at the late stage of ensiling. This suggested that the metabolic activities in M and PM silages was not stabilized after 60 days of ensiling.\n\nCell motility allows bacteria to respond to favorable or unfavorable stimuli in their environment, thereby increasing the probability of survival. In addition, the survival of all organisms depends on implementation of appropriate phenotypic responses upon perception of relevant environmental stimuli. As shown in , the upregulated “Cell motility” and “Signaling molecules and interaction” on the second pathway level was consistent with the enrichment of stress-resistant bacteria in leaf surface during the day. The bacteria enriched during the day are mostly aerobes and supposed difficult to survive in silage. After 60 days of ensiling, the upregulated pathways “Cell motility”, “Signaling molecules and interaction”, and “Cellular community-prokaryotes” in M and PM silages suggested that the survival of these bacteria might be related to the enhancements in nutrient availability and cooperation among bacterial cells. It is worth noting that these metabolism categories showed highest abundances in M silage rather than in PM silage. This was probably because the harshest environment at midday have enriched the most stubborn microbiota, which are present greatest tolerance to extreme environmental stresses.\n\nAmong the KEGG metabolic pathways, carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism categories are the main metabolism pathways during silage fermentation (14). Therefore, the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways were specifically analyzed on the third pathway level ( ). The variations of metabolic pathways among the silages on the third level was found greatest on day 1 and 60. This indicated that carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways of the bacterial community varied mostly at the beginning and the end of ensiling. Ensiling enhanced the carbohydrate metabolic pathways, whereas depressed most amino acid metabolic pathways. This might be because ensiling facilitated the carbohydrate metabolism by LAB and restricted the amino acid metabolism by some undesirable microorganisms. The delayed harvest time upregulated some carbohydrate catabolic pathways in fresh SSG. This might be associated with the extensive utilization of carbohydrates by phyllosphere-adapted bacteria for producing extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs). The production of EPSs has been reported to play an important role in bacterial adaptation to different stress conditions such as desiccation (31). After 60 days of ensiling, M silage exhibited highest relative abundances of amino acid metabolisms including “Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism,” “Phenylalanine metabolism,” and lowest relative abundances of “Lysine biosynthesis.” This might be attributed to the presence of bacteria such as Acinetobacter and Enhydrobacter, which are able to use amino acids as carbon source (57). The threonine, phenylalanine, and lysine are essential amino acids, which animals cannot synthesize (58). The upregulated metabolism and downregulated biosynthesis of these essential amino acids in silage suggested the reductions in nutritional value for animals. Furthermore, decarboxylation of the amino acids may increase the accumulation of biogenic amines, which has adverse impacts on DM intake and palatability (59).\n\nConclusion.\n\nSSG exhibited variations in chemical composition and epiphytic microbiota during the day. These variations affected the natural fermentation parameters, bacterial community and metabolic characteristics of SSG silage. Compared to AM silage, M and PM silages exhibited delayed fermentation, unnormal lower final pH and the higher relative abundances of undesirable bacteria such as Delftia, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, Acinetobacter, Enhydrobacter, and Bacillus. Moreover, PM silage had highest residual WSC and M silage had highest levels of glycine, serine, threonine, and phenylalanine metabolisms at the late stage of ensiling. These results suggest that the use of SSG harvested late in the day for silage making may cause problems including declines in silage quality, potential danger to human and animals, and increased risk of aerobic instability at silage opening, while better silage characteristics could be guaranteed through morning harvest. This study would help in precise determination of the harvest schedules, providing a cost-saving and safe strategy to produce value-added silage products and supporting the shifts toward sustainable, low-cost, high-efficiency, and safety agricultural production systems."
