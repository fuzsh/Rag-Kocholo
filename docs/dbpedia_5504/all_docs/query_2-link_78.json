        "text": "It’s the life and times of David Geffen–the making of Hollywood powerbroker.\n\n1943\n\nDavid Geffen is born on February 21st in Brooklyn, NY.\n\n1949\n\nGeffen’s mother, Batya, suffers a nervous breakdown. Geffen’s father, Abe, checks her into Kings County Hospital. She stays there for nearly six months.\n\n1950\n\nBatya opens Chic Corsetry by Geffen.\n\n1953\n\nGeffen makes money scalping Broadway tickets.\n\n1958\n\nGeffen is voted co-chair of the junior class submission for Sing (school wide talent show). Juniors win in a landslide, beating the senior class for the first time in the history of the competition.\n\n1959\n\nGeffen is re-elected as co-chair of Sing, as is his partner from the previous year, Sue DeWild. Possibly not wanting to share the spot light and feeling like he can do it alone, Geffen (supposedly) tells on DeWild for cutting class, nullifying her post as co-chair. She is eventually reinstated and blames Geffen for tipping off the teacher, Geffen quietly resigns.\n\n1960\n\nGeffen graduates from New Utrecht High School. Predicted to one day run for president in his senior yearbook.\n\nGeffen makes his first trip to Los Angeles. His brother Mitchell is in law school there. Geffen answers an ad in The New York Times and delivers a car out there.\n\nGeffen moves in with Mitchell and gets a job with Remington Rand Univac in their keypunch service bureau. They train him to program the Univac 120, an accounting machine.\n\nGeffen’s father goes into the hospital.\n\nGeffen gets small part in The Explosive Generation.\n\n1961\n\nBatya, completely worn out from working fulltime and tending to her dying husband in the hospital, demands Geffen returns to Brooklyn.\n\nBegins taking night classes at Brooklyn College.\n\nMarch 21st — Abe dies at The Kings County Hospital.\n\nAfter his father’s death, the government sends Geffen a social security death benefits check. The money is for David but issued to Batya. Worried that his mother might not hand over the money, Geffen steals the check and eventually uses a good portion of it to get himself to LA.\n\nGeffen applies to UCLA but gets rejected. He gets accepted to University of Texas, Austin. But before he can even get through one term, he has dropped out and flown back to LA.\n\n1962\n\nMitchell’s new wife’s sister marries Phil Spector. Geffen tags along to some of Spector’s recording sessions – Allowing Geffen a front row seat to music history being made. Only two years his junior, Geffen is inspired by Spector’s huge success. (p40)\n\n1963\n\nGeffen works as an usher at CBS Television City. Working shows such as The Danny Kaye Show, Red Skeleton Hour, The Judy Garland Show–and is even asked to baby-sit Garland’s kids during tapings.\n\nGeffen gets a nose job.\n\nNews of JFK’s assassination sweeps the theater while Geffen is working a taping of the Art Linkletter talk show House Party. To Geffen’s disgust, Linkletter tries to carry on with the show and when a man a cheers inappropriately, Geffen lunges at the man and is fired immediately.\n\nWith no money and no job, Geffen again heads back to Brooklyn.\n\n1964\n\nGeffen gets a job as a receptionist for a TV show called The Reporter but gets fired after only two weeks. Geffen had taken to reading all of the scripts and critiquing them–which people found inappropriate.\n\nGeffen applies to Ashley Famous but doesn’t get the job because he is not a college graduate. Geffen would not make that mistake again.\n\nGeffen calls the William Morris Agency to apply for a job in the mailroom. He tells them he is Phil Spector’s cousin–a stretch. Geffen then writes on his application that he is a UCLA graduate with a degree in theater arts. On June 22nd, Geffen starts in the William Morris Agency. Geffen hears a rumor that a trainee has just gotten fired for lying on his application. Geffen comes in an hour early for the next four months in an effort to intercept the disastrous letter that would eventually come from UCLA saying they had never heard of David Geffen. When the letter comes, Geffen has UCLA stationary printed, forges a new letter and has Mitchell remail it from LA.\n\nGeffen uses his Christmas vacation to work in the mailroom of the WMA offices in LA , meets Barry Diller.\n\nAfter hearing Nat Lefkowitz, the head of WMA, came in to work on Saturdays, Geffen begins coming in on Saturdays. Geffen makes himself known, hanging around waiting to “bump into” Lefkowitz. He eventually does and befriends the 56 year old executive.\n\n1965\n\nMeets Elliot Roberts at WMA.\n\nGeffen intercepts a General Artists client list that had been sent to his boss, Ben Griefer. Knowing that having such lists is an industry no-no, Geffen delivers the list to the head of WMA New York, Nat Lefkowitz. Griefer is furious and fires Geffen. Lefkowitz is impressed, rehires him and promotes him to assistant to the agent Harry Kalcheim.\n\nGeffen makes friends with a young agent, Owen Laster. He asks Laster if he can help him sign clients. The two work well together, signing quite a few new clients. Lefkowitz is impressed with Geffen’s talent and dedication.\n\nLefkowitz promotes Geffen to agent in the TV department under Lou Weiss, giving him a raise and his first expense account.\n\n1966\n\nOn a business trip to LA, Geffen comes out to his friend and fellow agent, John Hartmann.\n\nGeffen is able to avoid the Vietnam draft thanks to advice from actor friend Robert Drivas. He checks “yes” to the question, “Do you have any homosexual tendencies?” The draft board classifies him as “physically or mentally unable to serve.”\n\nJerry Brandt tells Geffen that the music department at WMA is the place for a young agent to make a name for himself. This very astute advice changes Geffen’s path–from movies to music.\n\n1967\n\nGeffen signs the Youngbloods to WMA.\n\nGeffen gets Elliot Roberts a job at Chartoff-Winkler, a company that predominately manages comedians. Roberts clearly has no idea what he’s doing and within a month all of his clients hire new managers.\n\nBuffy St. Marrie tells Roberts to go see her friend Joni Mitchell play at Café Wha? He goes on tour with Mitchell the very next day and very quickly becomes her fulltime manager. He finally gets her a record deal with Reprise. Roberts, Mitchell and David Crosby fly out to California to record Mitchell’s first album. Within just a few weeks, Roberts has tapped into the Laurel Canyon music scene, managing Buffalo Springfield and David Crosby.\n\nGeffen has dinner at one of his client’s houses in LA, director Steve Binder. Geffen expresses his frustration with WMA and says he wants to start managing musicians. Binder puts on a Laura Nyro album and suggests her as Geffen’s first client. Nyro had been wrangled into publishing and management contracts with Artie Mogull and had been booed off the stage at The Monterey Pop Festival in August 1967 (or so the story goes).\n\nPursues Nyro who is in hiding in NYC and convinces her to let him become her agent/manager.\n\nGeffen hires a lawyer to review the Nyro/Mogull managing and publishing contracts. The lawyer points out that Nyro was a minor when she signed her contract and also that the contracts had been scheduled to remain in effect for 5 years–at a time when the law held that contracts lasting for more than 3 years were unreasonable. Geffen was delighted and immediately demanded Mogull terminate the contracts, make a full accounting of all of Nyro’s copyrights and commissions and return them all.\n\nGeffen gets Nyro in for an audition with Clive Davis at CBS Records. She performs for Davis and he offers her a recording contract on the spot.\n\n1968\n\nNyro begins recording her album.\n\nMogull insists his management and publishing contracts with Nyro are valid and binding. Geffen files a lawsuit against Mogull.\n\nGeffen grows very close with Clive Davis and his family.\n\nLaura Nyro releases Eli and the Thirteenth Confession on March 13th.\n\nLeaves WMA (his last day: May 10th) for Ashley Famous – First time working under Steve Ross, head of Kinney services (parking lots and funeral home businesses), who bought the agency for $13 Million in 1967. (p88)\n\nGeffen transforms the music department at Ashley Famous in one brilliant move. Geffen woos agent Todd Schiffman away from APA, knowing that Schiffman’s existing client, manager Albert Grossman, and all of Grossman’s clients (Including Janis Joplin, Kris Kristofferson, Paul Butterfield and Peter, Paul and Mary) will follow. (p90-91)\n\nGeffen meets Sandy Gallin while walking down El Camino Drive in Beverly Hills – The two are introduced by mutual friend Joel Dean. (p93)\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash decided to form a band. They asked Roberts to manage them. Roberts quickly realizes he’s in over his head and calls Geffen to help. After much deliberation Crosby, Stills and Nash decide they are in favor of including Geffen (“We’re in a shark pool here,” Crosby said. “We need a shark to look after us.”) They make a deal. Refusing to sign a contract, they shake on it. (p101-104)\n\nGeffen and co-worker, Todd Schiffman, are running late to get contracts signed by The Doors. A mile from Asbury Park, NJ their limo breaks down and they have to run along the side of the road the rest of the way in order to make it in time. The papers are signed but Geffen realizes he’s not interested in any more such chases. (p98)\n\n1969 Age 26\n\nGeffen leaves Ashley Famous – Angering many. Opened David Geffen Enterprises. (p105)\n\nGeffen attempts to get CSN out of their individual contracts. When Geffen goes over to Atlantic to ask Jerry Wexler about freeing up Stills, Wexler physically throws Geffen out of his office. But Geffen is called back to Atlantic by Ahmet Ertegun and the two are able to strike a deal. Atlantic will record them and Geffen/Roberts will manage them. Atlantic ends up having to give up the new band Paco in order for Davis to let Crosby and Nash out of their recording contracts. First dealings with Ahmet) (p107-111)\n\nWith CSN deal clinched, Geffen moves to LA (p111)\n\nClive Davis, still bitter about the CSN deal, says he’s suspending Nyro’s recording session. Geffen, through an employee, manipulates the situation masterfully. Saying Nyro was told, she’s furious and saying terrible things about you and unfortunately there’s a reporter and photographer from Life there. Davis quickly changes his mind. (p112)\n\nThe Mogull lawsuit is finally heard in NY state court. Citing Mogull’s failure to seek approval from the court – necessary because Nyro was a minor – the judge nullifies the management agreement. However, he refuses to negate the publishing agreement – stating that the law is limited to “performance contracts” and says nothing about publishing. He decides a full trial is needed. (p113)\n\nCrosby, Stills and Nash releases Crosby, Stills and Nash – Columbia – May 29th (p116)\n\n*Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\n\n*Long Time Gone\n\n*You Don’t Have to Cry\n\n*49 Bye-Byes\n\nAhmet Ertegun suggests Neil Young go on tour with CSN to give the extra musical support they need for their live show. (p118)\n\nGeffen and Roberts formally form Geffen/Roberts Management (p118)\n\nWoodstock – Geffen does not go. Joni Mitchell is scheduled to appear on the Dick Cavett show the next day. Put off by the mud and traffic, and afraid Mitchell will miss her TV appearance, Geffen decides they will stay in New York City while CSNY go on to play their second ever show at the festival. Mitchell is heartbroken and writes the song Woodstock in Geffen’s apartment. The song is later released on her Ladies of the Canyon (1970) album as well as CSNY’s De Ja Vu (1970). (p122)\n\nLaura Nyro releases New York Tendaberry – Columbia – September 24th\n\n*Time And Love\n\nNyro plays very successful shows at Carnegie Hall the weekend after Thanksgiving. Capitalizing on the moment, Geffen rushes over to Clive Davis with an offer to sell Tuna Fish Music to CBS. They shake on the deal – CBS will acquire the company in a tax-free exchange of stock as soon as the Mogull lawsuit is settled. (p125)\n\nSandy Gallin suggests Geffen take an agent job at CMA in LA. Geffen agrees, hoping to make a connection with the chairman of the agency, Freddy Fields. (p127)\n\n1970 Age 27\n\nDavid Crosby suggests Jackson Browne send a tape to Geffen. Browne sends a tape, an 8″ by 10″ glossy and a letter. Geffen thinks it’s cheesy and figures “my god, this guy can’t be good” and throws it all in the garbage. His secretary fishes it out, thinking Browne is handsome, listens to the tape and then makes Geffen listen. Geffen immediately changes his mind. (p131)\n\nCSNY releases De Ja Vu – Columbia – March 11th (p134)\n\n*Woodstock\n\n*Ohio\n\n*Our House\n\nAfter a tumultuous tour, CSNY breaks up, each member going off to pursue solo careers.\n\nGeffen grows anxious for the Mogull lawsuit to come to a close so he can officially sell Tuna Fish Music to CBS. But the lawsuit is dragging and because the deal was made in CBS stock, and the stock was dropping, Geffen was losing money. He is eventually able to make a stabilized deal with Davis. (p137)\n\nFriendship with Ahmet and Mica growing. They take trips to Europe together. Geffen buys a Picasso. (p138)\n\nGeffen takes his new client, Jackson Browne, to CBS so he can audition for Clive Davis. During the meeting Davis excuses himself to take a call from Goddard Lieberson, Davis’ boss. Geffen is incensed at what he saw as Davis’ rude behavior and instructed Browne to pack up his guitar. Browne thought Geffen was being irrational but did as he was told. They got into the elevator with Davis screaming after them. (p140)\n\nGeffen goes to Ahmet Ertegun to ask him about recording Jackson Browne. Ahmet says ” I already have a lot of money. Why don’t you open a record company so you can have a lot of money.” Ahmet then offers 50% partnership, financial support and Atlantic distribution. An incredible deal for David and an offer he can’t refuse. (p141)\n\nGeffen leaves CMA (p142)\n\n1971 Age 28\n\nAsylum Records is established at 9130 Sunset Blvd.\n\nGeffen hires Linda Loddengaard who is to be his assistant for the next 17 years. She was fiercely loyal. (p144)\n\nGeffen forges a telegram to Mo Ostin from Neil Young in order to scare Ostin into improving Neil’s new contract with Warner/Reprise. The plan works. (p148)\n\nGeffen goes with Ertegun to the South of France. Ertegun is throwing a party for The Rolling Stones – recently signed to Atlantic. Geffen attempts to woo The Stones into letting Geffen/Roberts book their next tour. It does not work. (p151)\n\nRather than go through a full trial, Geffen concedes defeat and settles with Mogull – paying out $470,000.00. (p157)\n\nThe papers are finally signed for the sale of Tuna Fish. Geffen is officially a millionaire at 28. Nyro signs the papers but also decides to stay at Columbia and not go to Asylum with Geffen. Irreparable damage is done to their relationship. They are no longer in business together and no longer friends. (p157)\n\nJackson Browne introduces Geffen to Glenn Frey. (p158)\n\nGeffen buys out Don Henley and Glenn Frey’s contracts in order to sign them as the Eagles. He also pays to get their teeth fixed. (p160)\n\nGeffen in sauna with Frey, Henley and Doheny and vows never to let Asylum get larger than the number of artists he can fit in that sauna. (p160)\n\nIrving Azoff comes to LA and becomes a player in the game. Azoff had sent a demo of one of his clients, Dan Fogelberg, to Geffen. Geffen told him he liked it and if Azoff would give him about a year he would sign Fogelberg. Impatient, Azoff strikes a deal with Davis. Geffen throws a fit. (p161)\n\nCSNY releases live album 4 Way Street – Columbia – April 7th – (p162)\n\nDifficult and constantly high Stills is fired by Geffen. Stills prints up bumper stickers “Who is David Geffen and why is he saying those terrible things about me?” (p163)\n\nGeffen gets arrested for carrying weed (meant for Crosby) at LAX on Yom Kippur. Geffen’ brother, Mitchell, bails him out of jail. (p164)\n\nGeffen appears on The Dating Game.\n\nGeffen’s Picasso is stolen. The insurance company issues Geffen a check for $75,000.00. With a $40,000.00 profit, Geffen becomes less concerned with the loss of the painting. (p166)\n\nGeffen accepts an invitation to spend the weekend in New Haven, CT with Jerry Greenberg, one of Ertegun’s top lieutenants at Atlantic. Greenberg takes Geffen to his favorite restaurant and introduces him to the owner, Steve Rubell. A few years later Rubell opens Studio 54 where Geffen spends a great deal of time – the two become good friends.

Within a few years Batya’s only surviving sibling, Deena Volovskaya, comes from Russia to join her. (p182)\n\nOfficially rich after Asylum sale, Geffen begins to make his first big purchases. In addition to the home he bought for his mother, Geffen buys a beach house and Mercedes for himself. (p183)\n\nNow that he is wealthy, he is able to see what he could not when he was poor – money alone is not going to make him happy. He begins analysis 5 days/week.

The deal also allows Dylan to form his own label, Ashes and Sands Records, with Elektra/Asylum distribution. (p213)\n\nGeffen’s ego swells after the ‘winning’ of Dylan and no one hates it more than Jerry Wexler. The two men see each other at a Warner execs meeting. Baited by Geffen, Wexler is once again unable to control his hatred. Wexler lunges at Geffen and screams: “You’d jump into a pool of pus to come up with a nickel between your teeth.” (p215)\n\nIrving Azoff capitalizes on the Eagles’ unhappiness with Geffen and Roberts and eventually leaves the company to personally manage the Eagles.

(p227)\n\nDylan and The Band decide they will not give Elektra/Asylum the live album, Before the Flood, like they had promised Geffen. They told Geffen if he wanted the album he would have to bid on it like everyone else. In the end, Geffen got the album but for a much higher price than he had hoped for. Very upsetting for Geffen. Damage to his relationship with Dylan and Robertson. (p230)\n\nGeffen convinces Ross to merge Elektra/Asylum with Atlantic.

To which Eastwood replies, “I’m glad you took the time to see the picture, and I appreciate your comments. Why don’t you study the picture some more and see if you have any more thoughts. When you do, give me a call over at Paramount.” “Why over at Paramount?” Geffen asked. “Because that’s where I’ll be making my next movie.” Geffen realizes he’s put his foot in his mouth and quickly recants. “Clint, the picture is perfect.

Sue Mengers lets out a scream and Paul Simon raises a giant saltshaker above his head. “Brian, what are you doing?” shouted Simon. “It’s the only way I could hurt this guy. He won’t return my phone calls! This is the only way that I could think to properly humiliate him!” The two men are pulled apart. Geffen claims he did not return Rohan’s calls because he had once made an anti-Semitic remark. The next day, Geffen gets a call from Frank Sinatra, offering condolences and help if he wanted it.

Artists signings, staff salaries, marketing, promotion and backroom funtions. The profits would be split equally between the two partners and they each would own 50 percent of the venture’s assets. The deal included record and theater deals. Geffen was also pushing hard for a movie-production deal. Ross, as ever, had tremendous faith in Geffen and supported the idea. But Ted Ashley and Frank Wells, the top execs at the Warner movie studio, were against it. Ross asked Geffen to be patient and assured him a deal would be made in due course. Ross also promised Geffen that Warner Communications would one day buy the half of the record label it did not own. In addition, Geffen retained all manufacturing and distribution rights.

No longer represented by Apple Records, Lennon is a free agent. Geffen is shrewd enough to send a telegram addressed to Yoko, showing regard for her. Because of this, Yoko asks Geffen to come to The Dakota for a meeting. Geffen had heard Yoko had an affinity for white and that everything in her office was white. With this in mind, Geffen decides he will wear all white. Yoko, dressed in all black, stifles a laugh when her assistant ushers Geffen in. After determining he has “good numbers” and agreeing on a price for the album, Yoko says she’ll think about it. She calls another meeting for the next day.

In return, Geffen obtained the rights to release the show’s original cast album. He also purchased, for one million dollars, the right to turn the musical into a movie.

Geffen is disappointed and furious. (p334)\n\nGeffen figures there is only one person that will save him now, Steve Ross. Geffen takes the film to Warner and Ross instructs the new chairman of the movie studio, Bob Daly, to offer Geffen a deal in which the movie studio will create a production company for Geffen to run. Personal Best will be it’s first release. The deal gives Geffen the right to use Warner money to make whatever films he chooses, up to a certain budget level, with no approval necessary.

Simon is not concerned and believes Yetnikoff will release the album because it will be a great success. Geffen insinuates himself into the situation anyway and strikes a deal with Yetnikoff to release the album internationally but with a Geffen Records logo. When Geffen informs Simon that he has taken care of the problem and that Simon’s album will be released internationally on Geffen Records, Simon becomes very angry. (p340)\n\n1982 Age 39\n\nOn February 5th, Personal Best is released in the US – Geffen is proud of gay angle.

He said that Trans and Everybody’s Rockin’ were “musically uncharacteristic of Young’s previous recordings” and that he had been damaged in excess of $3 million. Brazen, even for Geffen.

(p381)\n\nGeffen and Antin call it quits. (p382)\n\n1984 Age 41\n\nGeffen’s joint venture deal with Warner Bros. Records was about to expire. It was time to renegotiate. Geffen would propose an outrageous new deal: At the end of the new five-year contract, Warner Bros. Records would hand over the 50% equity stake it controlled in Geffen Records, giving Geffen complete ownership of the label. Geffen deliberately distances himself from Mo Ostin and Ostin’s wife. A tactical move, Geffen knew if he picked a fight with Ostin and they stopped speaking he would be able to deal only with Ross and Ross tended to give Geffen whatever he wanted. Geffen’s plan worked.
