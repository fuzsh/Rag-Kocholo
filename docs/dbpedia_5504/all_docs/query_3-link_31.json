Murry, S.J., Bishop of Youngstown\n\nAbout Most Reverend George V. Murry, S.J.,\n\nMost Reverend George V. Murry, S.J., Ph.D., Bishop of the Diocese of Youngstown, Ohio, received an honorary degree from The University of Scranton at its 2018 undergraduate commencement ceremony.\n\nAs member of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Bishop Murry served as chair of its Committee Against Racism, which was formed in August 2017 “… to focus on addressing the sin of racism in our society, and even in our Church, and the urgent need to come together as a society to find solutions.”\n\nPrior to his service as Bishop of the Diocese of Youngstown, which began in 2007, Bishop Murry served as Bishop of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands and Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago. For 20 years previously, he worked as a teacher and administrator in Catholic education.\n\nA native of Camden, New Jersey, and graduate of Camden Catholic High School, Bishop Murry attended Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia; St. Thomas Seminary in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and St. Mary’s Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland, where he earned his bachelor’s degree. He entered the Society of Jesus in 1972 and was ordained for the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus on June 9, 1979. He earned a Master of Divinity degree from the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley and a doctorate in American cultural history from George Washington University.\n\nDelivered by Very Reverend Timothy P. Kesicki, S.J., Jesuit Conference\n\nMay 27, 2018\n\nDear Class of 2018. Some find it challenging enough to listen to a speaker who has been invited from the outside to your commencement. I suppose that some of you may be thinking thinking, “Now we have to listen to somebody else read his speech? What’s next, are they going to text us our diplomas?”\n\nI am honored to deliver the address of Bishop George Vance Murry, S.J., the Bishop of Youngstown. You will hear the words of a distinguished U.S. Churchman. He chairs the U.S. Bishops Committee on Higher Education and was recently appointed chair of the ad-hoc committee on racism. He has traveled the world on behalf of Catholic Relief Services, International Commissions, but even more than these — he is kind, generous and an overall great man.\n\nTwo weeks ago I visited him in his hospital room at the Cleveland Clinic where he is being treated for acute leukemia. He’s doing well, but doctors won’t release him for at least a few more weeks while he regains his strength. As soon as I saw him he handed me the text of this speech and said, “I hope you’ve seen the movie Black Panther. Thank God I had, but I wondered, why? I playfully asked him, “Should I like . . . dress like T’Challa or something?” He rolled his eyes and said, “Unless you’re from the nation of Wakanda, I don’t see how. Just know what you’re reading.” I beg your attention now as I humbly deliver Bishop Murry’s address to the graduates.\n\n“Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth: more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis, the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers. We must find a way to look after one another as if we were one single tribe.” This isn’t Aristotle or Shakespeare, it’s Marvel Comics, whose blockbuster film, “Black Panther,” did make its way to the third-highest-grossing film in the US. Even if you haven’t seen this movie, its message can inspire.\n\nAs I sit in the confines of my hospital room, fighting a much smaller enemy than the world faced in “Black Panther,” I know that we are all fighting something inside of us. But regardless of our predicament, regardless of what might tear us apart, more connects than divides us, and I would like to focus on three things that connect all of us today:\n\n1. Young people will lead us\n\n2. We must overcome divisions\n\n3. The life and ministry of Jesus shows us the way.\n\nLet me begin with you our graduates and how you will lead us.\n\nYour generation is the most racially diverse in U.S. history. I see young people living into that reality everyday. I see you reaching across differences and building inclusive community, while previous generations, like mine, struggled immensely to do so.\n\nI don’t like to say, “Young people are our future,” because you are our present. Young people are making great things happen right now. For example, the March for Our Lives rally this spring was created and led by passionate students articulating a vision of life without gun violence. Young people came from diverse places and perspectives, from suburban Parkland, Florida, to small-town Newton, Connecticut, to urban Chicago and Washington, D.C.\n\nYoung people have sparked change throughout history. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was assassinated 50 years ago this spring, gave his first sermon at the age of 18 and became a leader of the Montgomery Bus boycott at 26. Jesus’ disciples were in their teens and early 20’s, according to scholars, and they went on to build the Church and bring Christianity to the world.\n\nYoung people lead us. Young people change the world. You do it with your courage and you do it with your fresh eyes that envision new possibilities.\n\nNow, to my second point, we need that courage and vision to overcome divisions.\n\nWhat is the change, the new vision we crave right now? I think that we are looking for a way out of our divisions and separateness. The Black Panther, T’Challa, says in his speech to the UN, “Now more than ever the illusions of division threaten our very existence.” We older folks have mostly accepted our divisions as fact. Too often we have distanced ourselves from one another by race, by political beliefs, by religion, by education, and more. Politicians and media operations prey on our separateness and sow discord, gathering support by appealing to one group over and against another.\n\nDo not believe in these divisions. Become, as Dr. King said, maladjusted to injustice and maladjusted to division. Listen to his words:\n\n“Modern psychology has a word that is probably used more than any other. It is the word ‘maladjusted.’ I say to you there are certain things in our nation and in our world which I am proud to be maladjusted and which I hope all men of good-will be maladjusted. I never intend to become adjusted to segregation and discrimination. I never intend to become adjusted to religious bigotry. I never intend to adjust myself to economic conditions that will take necessities from the many to give luxuries to the few. I never intend to adjust myself to the madness of militarism, to self-defeating effects of physical violence.”\n\nThe future belongs to those who are maladjusted. Mother Theresa said, “If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other.” You young people, though you have shorter memories, can make us all remember what is important, remember that we are in this together, remember that we live as one human family on this earth.\n\nAnd now my third point, how does the life and ministry of Jesus show us the way?\n\nYou will always encounter people who have almost given up on the truth that we could actually belong to one another. I say, ‘almost given up’ because there is always hope. Know that the truth of our mutual belonging is not just articulated by wise people like Dr. King and Mother Theresa, but by Jesus — the Divine Christ himself.\n\nThe life and ministry of Jesus gives us Christians a great deal with which to reckon. Jesus says, “Love your neighbor,” and he clearly intends our neighbor to include the outcast and the despised. Love your Samaritan neighbor — the most despised people of all to the Jews. Love your leper neighbor. Love your immigrant neighbor. Jesus’ emphasis on the poor and the outcast sends an incredibly radical message. It always has. But I want to point to something else in Jesus’ life and ministry that may be even more radical for us today, and that is Jesus insistence on inviting and including everyone. And I mean everyone. He brought together the destitute and the wealthy, the prostitute and the pious religious observer. Somehow he brought together Matthew the tax collector — an ally of the Roman occupiers — and Simon the zealot — a freedom fighter for the Jewish resistance to the Romans.\n\nBefore I close, I want to take a look at Jesus’ Parable of the Great Banquet. In the Bible, the banquet is an important symbol of God’s reign on earth and in heaven. In Jesus’ parable, the original invitees to a spectacular feast decline the invitation at the last minute. The master, representing God, then says to his servant, “Go out at once into the streets and lanes of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.” Here again we have the priority for the poor that God exhibits throughout the Bible with which we have a very tough time. Imagine your graduation dinners last night and tonight and then inviting every homeless person and every person with severe disabilities that you could find.\n\nAnd then Jesus takes it a step further. The servant comes back, and says, “Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.” The master replies, “Go out into the roads and lanes, and compel people to come in, so that my house may be filled.” The poor and disadvantaged get first priority, and then it’s “here comes everybody.”\n\nImagine pulling people in from every neighborhood, from every walk of life, compelling them to sit down and share a meal together. You would have black and white and brown all together, rich and poor, gay and straight, progressive and conservative. Everyone’s mind would be blown when a vegan found a way to share a meal with a carnivore rancher, when a Black Lives Matter activist chuckled at the joke told by a Confederate flag-wearing Harley rider, and when a Trump enthusiast asked an undocumented immigrant to pass the tortillas.\n\nSomewhere in all of the mixing and relating, the Holy Spirit moves! God’s blessed community looks like a smorgasbord of humanity, in heaven and on earth. That’s not to say that it is OK to hold onto our biases, even our moral failings, but we grow past them together. In relationship with one another, we live into what connects us while learning a great deal about one another’s life and individuality.\n\nIn closing, I see young people moving all of us toward a more blessed and diverse community. You have always sparked change and been leaders when we needed it. The task of ending racism and poverty is not over, and we need you. The struggle to protect the environment, the unborn, and the immigrant continues and we need you. We need you in order to make progress on these issues. Perhaps most importantly, we need you to see beyond what appears to separate us and hold onto what connects us — belonging together in one human family. Congratulations class of 2018. Lead me!\n\nOne of the first lessons you learn at a Jesuit institution is the importance of reflection. Reflection has the power to take everyday, seemingly ordinary experiences and turn them into profound, didactic moments. Reflection can help you truly appreciate the opportunities and gifts you have received and will receive throughout your lifetime. You never truly realize how much something has impacted your trajectory in life until you have taken the time to think over everything that it took to take you from point A to point B.\n\nI feel I always have a spike in the amount of time I spend reflecting whenever an academic year comes to a close. The beginning of the spring semester, let alone the beginning of the fall semester, manages to paradoxically feel like it was yesterday and years ago all at the same time. It feels strange to think about the person I was and the person I have become in a period of time that seems so short to me.\n\nAs I begin to take the time to reflect over everything that has happened to me this past academic year, I cannot help but acknowledge something that has had quite a positive impact on my life: my internship with The University of Scranton’s Advancement Team.\n\nToward the end of the 2017 fall semester, I saw an ad for an internship with the University Advancement Team that would take place during the 2018 spring semester. The internship was geared toward communication majors as it would entail writing press releases, taking photographs, editing videos and other communication-related activities. After reviewing all the details about the internship, I decided that it would be something I would be interested in doing, so I applied.\n\nBefore the start of winter break, I received great news: I got the position. Throughout winter break I could not help but look forward to returning to Scranton. My internship with the University Advancement Team would be my first internship ever. I was excited to get back to school and get to work.\n\nI officially started my internship during the second week of classes. One of my first assignments was to get footage from the University’s Wall of Fame ceremony that took place on February 10. I got to use a handheld stabilizer, which is a device used to make sure footage you shoot on your phone is steady, for the first time. I also got to interview the former student-athletes who were inducted on that day. Overall, I will never forget that assignment primarily because this was one of my first major assignments that I got to do during my internship.\n\nOne of my favorite things about my internship was the fact that I got to report on events that I was interested in. In some cases, I even got to attend events that I was interested in but may not have attended on my own had I not been asked to cover it for my internship. A prime example of this was the Women in Business Luncheon and Panel that was hosted by the Kania School of Management. I had been extremely interested in attending this event; I was hesitant to go, however, because I did not know anyone else who was going. I was happy that I was asked to cover this event because I felt more comfortable going to the luncheon and panel by myself under the guise that I was covering it just “for work.” Going to the luncheon and panel is definitely one of my highlights from the 2018 spring semester. I was able to listen to women who work in sectors that I aspire to work in after graduation share wisdom and advice on how to build a successful career.\n\nSome my favorite assignments that I worked on during my internship were whenever I got to take pictures around campus or create art on Canva that would be posted on Advancement’s social media outlets. I enjoyed these assignments as a chance to develop my creativity in an outlet other than writing.\n\nDuring my internship, I also got to witness how powerful teamwork is in the workplace. Throughout the spring semester, the Advancement Team prepared for 5.06, the University’s Day of Giving. I got to see firsthand all the time and energy everyone put into their work in order to make the event a success.\n\nI cannot end my reflection on my experience interning with the University Advancement Team without acknowledging the members of the Advancement Team. Everyone on the Advancement Team quickly became a friendly face I knew I could turn to if I ever had any questions. I am grateful that I got to work with so many amazing people who I now can wave hello to whenever I see them on campus.\n\nI especially want to thank my mentor, Tom Salitsky, for all the guidance he has provided me throughout the semester. With his help, I feel that I have learned a lot of practical skills that will help me in my career after I graduate from The University of Scranton. I was very lucky to have a mentor as patient and helpful as he was.\n\nWhile I am sad that my time with the Advancement Team has come to a close, I am happy that I was fortunate to intern with them this past semester. Work never felt like work whenever I went to my internship. This experience has helped me feel more confident in myself and my plans for after I graduate. Having validation that I am pursuing the right field is a gift like no other, and I cannot express how grateful I am that my internship with the Advancement Team was able to give that validation to me.\n\nNearly 200 area students participated in The University of Scranton’s annual Hayes Family Science Competition for High School Physics and Engineering Students.

Bombard began her career at the University as an English literature major minoring in communication. However, after taking a communication ethics class taught by Matthew Reavy, Ph.D., Bombard decided to declare a second major: strategic communication with a track in public relations.\n\n“It’s really about trying to bring out the best in people and bring out the best in a company or whatever organization you’re working for,” Bombard said. “I really think I have this drive. I want to see people being the best they can be.”\n\nBombard started writing for The Aquinas during her sophomore year at the University after a friend of hers reached out about writing for the Arts and Life section of the paper. Not long after she began writing for the paper, Bombard began getting more involved in The Aquinas. Anytime a new position opened, Bombard would jump to take it. Over the past three years, Bombard was involved in copyediting, the Campus Commons and co-editing the Arts and Life section before ultimately becoming editor-in-chief for the 2017-18 academic year.\n\nThe Aquinas has had a very positive impact on Bombard, so much so that she has the publication engraved on her class ring.\n\n“I really met some of my best friends in this club,” Bombard said. “I think that’s one of the great things about joining organizations at the University. If you really find something you’re passionate about, and you join an organization for that, you’re surrounded by people who are the same as you. It’s so crazy how one common interest can bond people together.”\n\nThroughout her time working on The Aquinas, Bombard has seen the publication go through a variety of changes. Last spring, the publication went from publishing a weekly newspaper to only publishing content online.\n\n“There was a lot of confusion on campus,” Bombard said. “People were confused as to why we’d do that. A lot of professors were bummed out. A lot of students were bummed out.”\n\nDuring the summer before her senior year, Bombard came up with the idea to put out a monthly magazine in addition to the weekly content The Aquinas published on its website. At first, Bombard only thought of the magazine as a “distant idea.” However, after gaining support from her advisors and staff, Bombard soon realized that her idea was not as distant as it originally seemed.\n\n“If one or two people disagreed with the magazine, I don’t think I could’ve followed through with it,” Bombard said.\n\nFor Bombard, the first great moment in the creation of The Aquinas magazine was the very first staff meeting she had with her editors. Everyone was looking forward to contributing to the magazine.\n\n“I really think the best moments are when you see your staff excited and when everyone’s ready to put in the work,” Bombard said.\n\nHowever, there were some minor bumps in the road that the staff had to overcome as they began working on the magazine.\n\n“There was definitely a learning gap,” Bombard said. “Not everyone really knew how to use InDesign software.”\n\nMaking deadlines was another challenge Bombard and her staff faced as they worked to produce the magazine.\n\n“Students in general love to procrastinate,” Bombard said. “I know I do.”\n\nHowever, all that hard work paid off. In November 2017, The Aquinas released its first magazine to the public. The publication produced two more magazines during the spring 2018 semester and will release a senior edition for the Class of 2018 during Senior Week.\n\nLooking ahead, Bombard hopes to one day become an editor of a magazine after she graduates. Her time working on The Aquinas has truly helped develop her love for editing.\n\n\"Overall, I love having the opportunity to lead such an important publication in the University's history,\" Bombard said. \"This is the official student publication. Although it comes with a lot of pressure, I think that it's a gift more than anything. Having the potential to provide something that the University community can treasure and enjoy is really cool.\"\n\nIt’s probably safe to say many people have wished for a robot at one point or another, especially if that robot could, say, clean the house or do the grocery shopping.\n\nIn the medical world, however, robots have been all the rage for decades now, as have healing devices enhanced by virtual reality. For at least 20 years, exciting strides have been made in the field for patients with neurologic disorders, for example.\n\nCall it “the other VR,” or virtual rehabilitation.\n\nEnter physical therapist Renée Hakim, Ph.D., and Benjamin Bishop, Ph.D., two University of Scranton professors collaborating on pioneering research to determine if the specialized devices that have aided recovery in stroke patients can similarly aid those who have or had orthopedic injuries such as fractures, carpal tunnel syndrome or any type of nerve injury.\n\nTheir research is titled “Haptic Devices To Improve Hand-Arm Function: An Interdisciplinary Approach.”\n\nDr. Bishop, a professor in the Department of Computing Sciences, said haptic devices simulate physical sensation, the touch sensation you would have if interacting with an object. This research focuses on assistive and resistive devices, he noted.\n\nDr. Hakim, professor of physical therapy at the University, explained the difference between the two. Assistive devices provide some degree of help in moving a body part either completely (as the user is passive) or partially, as the user tries to help with the motion. A resistive device pushes back against the user and may be used to strengthen, as in lifting a weight.\n\nDr. Bishop, whose expertise is in graphics and computer hardware, said his part of the joint research is on the technical and implementation side – “How do we go about building it?” – while Dr. Hakim’s expertise is on the domain side.\n\n“It,” in this case, is a haptic system purchased from a third-party manufacturer (OR3D Ltd.) This end-effector device is hooked up to a portable computer with software that he, with the help of his graduate students, customized according to Dr. Hakim’s specifications.\n\nIn this case, Dr. Hakim specified that the software should aid in the seemingly simple task of handwriting: cursive and printed.\n\nHandwriting and plenty of other fine motor skills necessary to daily life can become nearly impossible tasks for those who’ve suffered orthopedic injuries, which was what prompted Dr. Hakim to choose the particular skill for the pilot of phase of this study.\n\n“We tried to come up with something functional and meaningful,” she said, explaining the concept of experience-dependent neuroplasticity, which, in simple terms, refers to the brain’s capacity to change in response to environmental stimuli and learning.\n\nHandwriting, in the virtual rehab world, is accomplished using what Dr. Hakim describes as a fat pen that acts as a stylus. A certain level of ability, such as the capacity to physically hold the pen, is necessary to take advantage of the technology.\n\n“We really wanted to pick something that is an actual physical task that someone would have to do on a daily basis,” Dr. Hakim said.\n\nSo far, she and Dr. Bishop have had subjects merely trying out the experimental technology, as the customized program they have co-created is still in the feasibility stage.\n\n“It’s more exploratory right now,” Dr. Hakim said, nonetheless anticipating advancement to the next stage, which is a four-week protocol to measure such factors as strength and motion in real subjects, may be just weeks away.\n\nPart of the challenge, she said, is getting people to come to campus who meet the study criteria. The program is free, she said, but subjects must fit certain specifications, so Dr. Hakim, who also has her own batch of graduate students involved in the research, has put the word out to fellow professors and others that potential candidates are needed.\n\nPart of the mission is to spread the news about how this research could rewrite futures for those with orthopedic injuries.\n\nOrthopedic recovery tends to focus on impairments but not always task-specificity, she said.\n\nMost people, Dr. Hakim said, are used to traditional therapies involving, for example, stretching, icing and reduction of pain.\n\n“This is really going beyond that with an emphasis on high-intensity functional training,” she said. “This is really a paradigm shift for people with orthopedic problems following the acute stage of recovery.”\n\nDr. Bishop agrees. Still, he stresses that the research, which for him is all about the algorithms, is still in its infancy, even a little “rough around the edges.”\n\nBut that could be the most exciting time for the venture, which he said began as a master’s thesis project from a student, Bret Oplinger, and has been evolving since.\n\n“In terms of the future, it’s dependent on the results of this work,” he said. “If it turns out this is very effective therapy, it would be well worth investing in.”\n\nCharles E. Kratz, dean of the library and information fluency at The University of Scranton, awarded the 2018 Bonnie W. Oldham Library Research Prize in the Undergraduate Upper-level category to Maura C. Burns, a senior History major with minors in Biology and Biochemistry from Jessup, Pennsylvania; the 2018 Bonnie W. Oldham Library Research Prize in the Undergraduate Foundational category to first-year Accounting major Nicole Cavanaugh from Dallas, Pennsylvania; and the 2018 Bonnie W. Oldham Library Research Prize in the Graduate category to Occupational Therapy student Emily Dineen from Bethel, Connecticut.\n\nThe Weinberg Memorial Library at The University of Scranton inaugurated the prize in 2011 to recognize excellence in research projects that show evidence of significant knowledge of the methods of research and the information gathering process, and use of library resources, tools, and services. In 2017, the prize was named for Professor Emerita Bonnie W. Oldham, who founded the prize at the University in 2011.\n\nBurns, winner in the Undergraduate Upper-level category for the winning project completed in a 200- to 400-level course, submitted to the competition her paper “Medicine in the American Revolution,” completed in the course HIST 490: Senior Seminar on the American Revolution, taught by Dr. David Dzurec. Researching and writing on a topic that combined her love for medicine and her passion for history, Burns utilized many of the Library’s resources and services to complete the research for this project, including the databases, the Library catalog and print collection, the eBook collection, EBSCOhost’s digital archives, the online research guide for History, the Circulation Services desk, and the printing and scanning stations throughout the Library. Through the websites curated on the Library’s History research guide, she discovered digital archival resources relevant to her inquiry that are housed outside of the University; in her description of research she explains, “I learned that the University of Scranton website connects to a network of libraries and resources that helped me form the backbone of my paper.” Burns goes on to rightly note that “just like history, research is unpredictable,” and that “research is a learning experience in and of itself,” things she learned through conducting the research for this project.\n\nHonorable Mention awards in the Undergraduate Upper-level category were presented to Catherine McManus, a junior Biology major with a minor in Political Science from Brookfield, Connecticut, who submitted her paper “Exploring the Interaction of Climate Change and Rapid Evolution Through the Expansion of Invasive Weed Ranges,” completed in the course BIOL 375: Evolution; and to group partners Luis Melgar, a senior Exercise Science major with minors in Spanish and Theology from Simpson, Pennsylvania, and Julianne Burrill, a junior Exercise Science major from New City, New York, for their project “The Effects of Dynamic and Static Stretching on Acute Lower Extremity Flexibility,” completed in the course EXSC 448: Research Methods.\n\nDineen, winner in the Graduate category, submitted to the competition her project “Historical Analysis,” completed in the course OT 501: Leadership in Occupational Therapy, taught by Dr. Marlene Joy Morgan. In this project students are asked to research a topic by reading the occupational therapy literature ranging back to 1917 when the field was founded. Dineen researched sensory integration intervention in pediatric occupational therapy, and of her research process for the project she said, “I was able to literally see the progression of the sensory integration approach and of the profession itself,” calling it a “historical immersive experience.” She accessed the occupational therapy literature through use of the Library’s resources including microfilm, indexes, databases, and print journals. Dineen shared in her description of research that her process included both “careful planning” to locate articles relevant to her topic as well as “serendipitous” discovery of articles that contributed to her understanding, and that she “learned not to be afraid to ask for help.”\n\nCavanaugh, winner in the Undergraduate Foundational category for projects completed at the 100-level, submitted to the competition her paper “There’s No Gain in the Globalization Game,” completed in Prof. Dawn D’Aries Zera’s WRTG 107: Composition course. To complete her research, Cavanaugh took advantage of the Library’s Research Services, made available to students at the Research Services desk on the second floor of the Library. By visiting the Research Services desk and consulting with the faculty Librarian working there, she learned the vast amount of information available to students through the University’s Library resources. As Cavanaugh puts it in her description of research, “A few clicks from the university homepage and I was connected to thousands of media sources, books, magazines, articles, journals, and more.” She also describes as part of her research process the importance of organizing the information she found into the main points of her paper’s outline through the combined use of a research log, the citation generators in the Library’s databases, and folders on her computer, all of which she used to organize and cite the sources she found.\n\nHonorable Mention awards in the Undergraduate Foundational category were presented to group partners James P. McKane Jr., a History major from Archbald, Pennsylvania, and Alana Siock, a French major from Jefferson Township, Pennsylvania, for their HIST 190: Digital History project “The Jesuit Takeover of the University of Scranton”; and to Physiology major Sydney Vanvourellis from Hillsborough, New Jersey, for her informative essay “Is Stress just in your Head?” completed in her WRTG 107: Composition course.\n\nPrize winners were honored at a reception on Thursday, May 10, 2018 in the Heritage Room of the Weinberg Memorial Library.\n\nFor more information about the Bonnie W. Oldham Library Research Prize, contact Donna Witek, information literacy coordinator at The University of Scranton’s Weinberg Memorial Library, at 570-941-4000 or donna.witek@scranton.edu.\n\nPlease consider giving to the Bonnie W.

Quinn, S.J., who served as of the 25th president of the Jesuit university from July 2011 through May 2017.\n\n“Today is the culmination of much dreaming, planning and building. Today is the beginning of a new chapter in the history of The University of Scranton,” said Rev. Herbert B. Keller, S.J., interim president of the University. “It was Father Quinn’s strong unshaken resolve to build this campus that has led us to this day. It is so appropriate that this athletics campus bears his name – for it was he who envisioned this field of dreams, and he knew – if we build it, they would come.”\n\nThe 11-acre Rev. Kevin P. Quinn, S.J., Athletics Campus, located along Broadway Street in Scranton, will be home for the University’s soccer, lacrosse, field hockey, baseball and softball Division III NCAA teams. The campus includes NCAA regulation baseball and softball fields and a multipurpose field that meets NCAA standards for soccer, lacrosse and field hockey. The campus also includes bleacher seating at each field, a field house with team locker rooms and a training room, parking, a community basketball court and a children’s play area.\n\n“In my opinion, athletics brings a vitality and energy to a college campus that benefits the entire university community. It is important that we invest in this experience not only for our current students but for future generations of Royals,” said Father Quinn at the dedication. “My friends, we have fulfilled our long-held dream of developing this place into an athletic campus appropriate and worthy for our University.”\n\nThe speakers, which included Robert W. Davis Jr., Ed.D., chief of staff, and David Martin, director of athletics, thanked the many University benefactors, former and current trustees, government officials and community leaders, staff and faculty members for their support of the project.\n\nMartin referred to the new facilities, which he called “second to none,” as a “game changer” for athletics and the University, as well as “a game changer for the entire community of Scranton. We are so blessed and so fortunate to have it here.”\n\nScranton Mayor Bill Courtright agreed.\n\n“For me I think about the fact that not only will the University (student-athletes) get to play their games right here in the city of Scranton, but I think of all the people who will come in from the outlying areas and from out of town. They get to play here and they also get to see all that Scranton has to offer, and I am very grateful for that. This facility is second to none,” said Mayor Courtright.\n\nMorgan Rentzheimer, a senior exercise science major and member of the University’s softball team, has played in the first games on Magis Field. She has already noticed area residents stopping to watch games as they walked along the Lackawanna River Heritage Trial that runs adjacent to the athletics campus.\n\nThe three fields on the athletics campus, which were named in recognition of the support of prominent Scranton alumni and their families, were also blessed as part of the dedication ceremony, as were the basketball court and the playground.\n\nThe 75 by 120 yard, synthetic-turf, multi-purpose field is named Robert and Marilyn Weiss Field in honor of University Trustee Robert Weiss ’68 and his wife, Marilyn. The synthetic-turf baseball field is named Charles J. Volpe Family Field, a name chosen by Charles (Chuck) Volpe Jr., Esq. ’82 and his wife, Ellen, in honor of the late Charles J. Volpe Sr. ’61, his children, and grandchildren who are graduates of the University. The synthetic-turf softball field is named Magis Field, a name chosen by former University Trustee Dennis J. McGonigle ’82 and his wife, Rachel. Magis, the Latin word meaning “more,” refers to the relentless desire to do more, grounded in gratitude for all of God’s gifts, which is a core Jesuit value and a key component of a Jesuit education.\n\nThe dedication ceremony can be viewed here.\n\nAnna Layaou ’18, a senior KSOM marketing major, has participated in multiple internships, including two offered through the Small Business Internship Initiative, a program created by The University of Scranton Small Business Development Center (SBDC). Layaou interned in Marketing and Communications at The Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce and served as an Advertising and Public Relations Intern at Condron Media. We were lucky enough to get the chance to ask Layaou a few questions about her experience with Condron Media, a local small business.\n\nDescribe your tasks and responsibilities:\n\nAt Condron Media, I did a lot of research and reading for clients in order to help with campaigns and content. I worked with the Condron Media team daily, including web developers, graphic designers, and advertising professionals in order collaborate together on projects for clients. Phil Condron also took me on various client meetings, in order for me to have a better understanding of client goals and the campaigns in general. I also helped with the coordination and execution of brand and client TV/photo shoots. One of my favorite things I was included in was the creation of the Condron Media blog and monthly podcast, which are both up on their website. I wrote and voiced the “Condron Media Tip of the Month” for the podcast and wrote an article on how to subscribe to a podcast. I developed social media posts and scheduling for Condron Media and some of their clients, another thing I enjoyed a lot since social media is so prevalent and will only continue to grow.\n\nWhat were some of your takeaways?\n\nI learned how to behave in a professional setting. I learned how to write a blog post, something I had never done before, and also record a podcast and the back end of that. It was interesting to see what actually goes into a marketing and advertising firm, which is the area I would like to go into when I graduate. Condron gave me the skills to thrive in the advertising and PR world. I learned how to form my ideas into real campaigns and how to execute them. I learned how to take ideas from clients and build that up into something great. I learned how to blend writing and research to also turn into real campaigns. From observing, I learned what goes into photo and video shoots, and how to make a commercial or advertisement into something great.\n\nWhat is valuable about interning at a small business?\n\nI like interning at a small business because you get to see all areas of the company, instead of just being under the direction of one person for months, I worked with various different departments. I was able to see all different elements work together to form one big picture. I liked that everyone knew my name within the first hour of working.\n\nDo you have any advice for future interns?\n\nI would definitely recommend to other students to take advantage of the Small Business Internship Initiative. My advice is to be ready to use your talents to the best of your abilities and to apply to a company that does what you think you want to do in the future. It’ll solidify your thinking one way or another. And if it’s not what you want to do, at least you got experience in the field and can put it on your resume. Don’t be afraid to share your ideas, either. Believe it or not, interns aren’t getting coffees and making copies all day.\n\nLearn More:\n\nCheck out the Small Business Internship Initiative to view the paid summer internship opportunities available now!

We know he’d like to help other students going through similar struggles achieve their goals.”\n\nA native of Pittston, Brian was the son of Alice and Gerard Jr. Musto. Brian was an outstanding student, graduating as valedictorian of Pittston Area High School in 2008. He graduated summa cum laude from The University of Scranton with a double major in management and history. He was a Presidential Scholar at the University and a member of the University’s Business Leadership Honors Program. Brian went on to Cornell Law School soon after but was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma at the age of 24. Despite his illness, he graduated from Cornell Law with honors in 2016. A member of Our Lady of the Eucharist Parish in Pittston, Brian married Maria Kristina Melgarejo ‘12 in September 2017, just a few short months before his passing.\n\nA Royal Connection\n\nBrian was not the first member of his family to attend The University of Scranton; his mother, Alice, graduated from Scranton in 1984, and his older brother, Kevin, graduated from the University in 2010. Both of Brian’s younger siblings also chose to study at Scranton; Chris graduated from the University in 2016, while Kate is currently a sophomore scheduled to graduate in 2020.\n\nBecause of the Musto family’s affinity for the University, they decided to memorialize Brian by establishing The Brian Musto ’12 Memorial Fund, which will help offset the education expenses of undergraduate and graduate students battling illness.\n\n“We were fortunate to be able to support Brian during his battle, but we know not all patients can say the same,” said Alice. “That is why we are establishing this fund in Brian’s name at his alma mater, The University of Scranton.”\n\n“Patients in this age bracket are often too old to receive help from pediatric organizations and too young to be completely financially independent. Our goal is to help students with expenses from travel for treatments to books for the semester. These costs add up quickly, and patients often cannot work while fighting health issues,” said Alice.\n\nIn order to endow the fund, the family needs to raise $40,000. They recently launched a fundraising campaign through the University’s 5.06 Day of Giving celebration, and they have already raised nearly $30,000 of their goal as of press time. As part of the campaign, the family is sponsoring a team that will participate in the University’s 5.06 K Run/Walk at the Kevin P. Quinn, S.J., Athletics Campus in south Scranton Saturday, May 5 at 9 a.m. Members of the public can register for the event for a fee of $20 by visiting scranton.edu/506K. Interested parties who won’t physically be in Scranton that weekend but wish to support the fund can do so by visiting scranton.edu/506K and signing up for the University’s Virtual 5.06 K Run/Walk May 4-6. Community members can also support the fund through a text to give campaign by texting BRIANMUSTOFUND to 71777.\n\nMore information can be found here for The Brian Musto ’12 Memorial Fund, and here for The University of Scranton’s 5.06 Weekend."
