Here is a small but diverse selection of records that broke down the barriers and paved the way for the dance scene we all enjoy today.\n\nCECE ROGERS - SOMEDAY\n\n\"Someday we'll live as one family, in sweet harmony...\"\n\nCeCe Rodgers: \"Seeing massive amounts of people who were different from me literally crying while dancing to a house song was pretty decadent. The lyrics of 'Someday' became bigger then I could ever dream.\" [via: Skrufff]\n\nTHRASHING DOVES - JESUS ON THE PAYROLL\n\nFun Fact: Bruce Forest remixed 'Jesus on the Payroll' using David Cole on piano. The band completed this special \"Street Mix\", which Paul Oakenfold gives credit for starting the Balearic movement in the '90s. The piano riff was sampled for Bocca Juniors - Raise (63 Steps to Heaven).\n\nFRANKIE KNUCKLES - YOUR LOVE\n\nFrankie Knuckles: \"I got my first drum machine from Derrick May... it was a Roland TR-909. The first time I used it, I used it on a version of 'Your Love' that I did with Jamie Principle. And I would use it live in the club. I would program different patterns into it throughout the week, and then use it throughout the course of a night, running it live, depending on the song and playing it underneath, or using it to segue between some things.\" [via: Red Bull]\n\nWILLIAM PITT - CITY LIGHTS\n\nFun Fact: 'City Lights' was Pitt's debut single and became a hit in France in 1987. Following that, the song became a hit in many European countries, including Spain, where is was number 1 in the charts for a brief period of time.\n\nMARSHALL JEFFERSON - MOVE YOUR BODY\n\nMarshall Jefferson: \"After Frankie Knuckles got a copy of it, it seemed the flood gates opened. I had to give Lil Louis and Fast Eddie copies, because Eddie lived 2 doors down from me on my block and Lil Louis lived on the next block. Mike Dunn, Tyree Cooper, and Hugo Hutchinson already had copies. Pretty soon it seemed like every DJ in Chicago had copies… some really bad and some passable, but crowds freaked every time it came on.\" [via: Test Pressing]\n\nLARRY HEARD AKA MR. FINGERS - CAN YOU FEEL IT?\n\nLarry Heard: \"Even back in the day on tracks like 'Can You Feel It', people always asked about the bassline and chords, which is a Roland Jupiter 6, but its not like a stock sound, a lot of those tracks like 'Washing Machine' weren’t built on available patches, it was more a case of experimenting and turning the knobs when everything was running to find that specific sound or create that kind of acid effect.\" [via: Red Bull]\n\nJOE SMOOTH - PROMISED LAND\n\nJoe Smooth: \"I studied my favorite hits from Motown and was determined to write a classic song with the same type of spirit in our house style. That's how 'Promised Land' happened...\"\n\nBRANDON COOKE FEAT. ROXANNE SHANTÉ - SHARP AS A KNIFE (ACID ATTACK)\n\nFun fact: Her first single was released at age 14, igniting both the career of rap’s first female star and hip-hop’s first recorded beef.

A Netflix biopic came out in 2018 about her life Roxanne, Roxanne, which was co-produced by Pharrell Williams.\n\nCARLY SIMON - WHY\n\nFun Fact: 7 years after its original release, 'Why' resurfaced during The Second Summer of Love and cemented its status as a Balearic classic.

The 'Sunrise Mix' went on to become a UK rave anthem.\n\nMAURICE - THIS IS ACID (A NEW DANCE CRAZE)\n\nFun Fact: Joshua's most famous production work was with Kim English and Destiny's Child.

I had been told there was something called acid house and that it was the new thing. There were about 50 people there that night in the whole place, all doing weird robotic dances, it looked so exciting. And the sound? My ears grew larger each second of it and my body wanted to move to this. My soul opened. It was like 'this is what I've been waiting for all along.' It was incredible, it spread like wildfire.\" [via: i-D]\n\nBANG THE PARTY - BANG BANG, YOU'RE MINE\n\nFun Fact: A part of the mid-'80s London soul scene with Jazzie B, Kid Batchelor started working on house music in 1987 during his DJ sets at the legendary Hedonism club nights.

What helped was that I was brewing with my other tracks that did this, such as 'Back To The Beat' and 'Can You Party', but 'I'll House You' took it to another level.\" [via: DJ Mag]\n\nTEN CITY - RIGHT BACK AT YOU\n\nFun Fact: Formerly known as Ragtyme, Ten City was comprised vocalist Byron Stingily, guitarist Herb Lawson and keyboardist Byron Burke and were augmented by producer Marshall Jefferson.\n\nRHYTHIM IS RHYTHIM - STRINGS OF LIFE\n\nDerrick May: \"I didn’t understand what I had done with 'Strings of Life.' I remember doing it and, finally when it was finished, I didn’t listen to it for a few minutes. When I hit the sequencer and it played, it was like a carnival. I felt like I was in the circus. I remember before I actually added the orchestration to it, it had a carnival sound on top of it, like a real playschool sound. It was reminding me of my childhood. Then I finally added the orchestration to it and it scared me.\" [via: Red Bull]\n\nREESE & SANTONIO - THE SOUND\n\nFun Fact: In the mid 1980’s Derrick May would drive from Detroit to the Music Box in Chicago, taking along records and friends, including Alton Miller, George Baker and Anthony Pearson (AKA Chez Damier).

He wrote his songs by singing them to musical accomplices such as Adonis.\n\nA GUY CALLED GERALD - VOODOO RAY\n\nA Guy Called Gerald: \"I was never really into what was popular. So when I found acid house it would have been on a show on Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, a guy called Stu Allen would play some acid between the funk and soul. I came to realise that the machines they were using to make this music were the same ones that I'd acquired. On the show, one of the things he'd did was a demo section. So I sent in an acid demo and it got played. That's how I did 'Voodoo Ray' in the end.\" [via: THUMP]\n\nLIL LOUIS - FRENCH KISS\n\nLil Louis: After spending two weeks at #1 on the US dance chart in 1989, the track crossed over and ended up being a big success throughout Europe, reaching #2 in the UK Singles Chart and in Germany, and number one in the Netherlands.\n\nRALPHI ROSARIO - YOU USED TO HOLD ME\n\nRalphi Rosario: \"Everyone was doing sample tracks at that time – jack this, jack that, pound the 909; etc. Here I was, 23 or 24 years old, and we did this serious song.\" [via: 5Chicago]\n\nSTEVE 'SILK' HURLEY - JACK YOUR BODY\n\nSteve 'Silk' Hurley: “What’s funny is that I made 'Jack Your Body' purely to amuse my friends... Listen to the voices I’m using on it: I’m imitating James Brown, Mr T on the A–Team, Richard Pryor. ’Huerggh!’ I didn’t expect it to go beyond the Chicago clubs, let alone become a No 1.” [via: The Guardian]\n\nRAZE - BREAK 4 LOVE\n\nFun Fact: This track features on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, on the in-game radio station SF-UR, which is considered to be one of the biggest video games of all-time.\n\nLOLA - WAX THE VAN\n\nFun Fact: Lola is soul singer Lola Blank, with assistance from Arthur Russell and her husband Bob Blank (Aural Exciters). This was one of only three tracks released under the Lola name, along with 'I Need More' and 'Work It'.\n\nPIERRE'S PFANTASY CLUB - DREAM GIRL (RALPHI ROSARIO MIX)\n\nDJ Pierre: \"Acid House didn’t blow up in Chicago. It influenced a bunch of other important acid house tracks from Armando, Tyree, Adonis… But we didn’t see the revolution until an interviewer from the UK tracked me down in Chicago and said “Man… This is the biggest thing in the UK! In fact, the Queen is banning the music there.” In those days we didn’t have the internet at our finger tips so it was tough to know that Trax records was illegally shipping out record abroad.\" [via: Hardlife]\n\nCULTURAL VIBE - MA FOOM BEY (LOVE CHANT VERSION)\n\nADONIS - NO WAY BACK\n\nFun Fact: According to some estimates, the single sold over 100,000 copies, making it a smash hit for the iconic TRAX label and one of the most the most well-known acid records of all-time.\n\nRICHIE HAVENS - GOING BACK TO MY ROOTS\n\nFun Fact: The song was first recorded by Lamont Dozier and was written for the African-American market and touches on the matters of self-identity, family, and soul fulfillment.

Rose voiced the tune, she was one of our main followers, and she was a dancer – she still is. One night she just picked up the mic and started to sing. Just heard her sing and that was it. Sorted it out from there.\"\n\nRose Windross: \"It's a feel good vibe rather than being a song and that's why I think it connects with a lot of people. People that I've met have shown me plenty of love regarding 'Fairplay' and I believe it's because of that vibe of the tracks.\"\n\nARNOLD JARVIS - TAKE SOME TIME OUT\n\nStream all of the tracks below..."
