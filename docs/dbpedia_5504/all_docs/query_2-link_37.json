        "text": "LEG 8, RACE 12: DAY 5\n\nHaving read so many crew blogs over the last year it is strange to suffer word blindness when asked to do the blog today, but here goes.\n\nRay and I are mothers today, and with great support from Nicola in particular, my porridge this morning and Ray's Chicken Thai Curry for lunch seemed to hit the spot with all crew. Along with a series of other jobs for Mother goes the opportunity to do the blog for the day. Having left behind my laptop in San Francisco, and having had my daily routine as a single legger, changed dramatically, with the routine of the day not tied to e-mail or any other “normal” family or business activities, it is strange but welcome to pick up a keyboard again.\n\nNow routines are fundamentally altered and driven by the watches, not even, or not much, by night or day which just float past so that the day or date now has much less meaning.\n\nAlso for us leggers we have been warmly welcomed into a wonderful team. It is perhaps a good thing that we are a fairly reduced team for this leg, which gives us all a meaningful role.\n\nInevitably, life is dominated by living at 30 degrees, and having read so many blogs describing the issues I will not aim to repeat them, since I suspect that most readers will know them only too well, especially as to how they make life for the Mothers difficult.\n\nHowever, there are aspects of living at 30 degrees that involve some team customs and moves, that have not been clear before experiencing them in person.\n\nFirst, and topical at the time of the world cup (football or soccer depending on which side of the pond one hails from), there is the Mexican Boot Wave. It starts when four or five crew are eating heartily, seated on the upwind bench with boots braced on the sill of the galley (for us, most likely for the entirety of this race, the starboard side). Then someone wants to access the for'ard heads, to the fruit supply, and a wave happens as the first person pulls back one leg, the mover steps forward, the first person pushes out their other leg and pulls up their second leg. So the wave of boots up and down smoothly allows the mover to traverse for'ard, and soon thereafter to traverse back. As one who has been surprised at the lack of the Mexican Wave at Baseball games, where just about every other good natured crowd ritual is observed, this takes me back to UK football games, at least on the TV.\n\nThe second is the butt shuffle. For those who are not helming or carrying out some particular piece of work, there are long conversational or contemplative periods spent watching the passing waves and sitting on the high-side at 30 degrees, though it feels like 70 degrees. Quite apart from the deck being littered with fittings that can savage one coccyx at the slightest opportunity, the deck is hard and moving all the time in all directions. So every few minutes each crew member slyly does a shuffle trying to find a piece of their anatomy that has not been tortured recently, and which can therefore withstand a bit more torture. There are no winners except when a watch ends or one heads up to helm.\n\nThis leg is notable and meaningful particularly for the Worlders and multi-leggers as there is a strong desire to get to the finish after having achieved so much for so long. But even just for single leggers such as myself, it has special resonance unlike any other leg in that each dawn points directly to home, friends and family becoming nearer with each wave, each hour and each watch. Of course a long way past the UK is San Francisco which I can still imagine we point to as we drive towards each dawn.\n\nWith thanks to all our supporters. Love and best wishes to all my girls in the UK and California."
