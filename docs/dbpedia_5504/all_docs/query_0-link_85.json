The mugwump name derives either from the name of a Native American leader or, more likely, from the aspersion that as nonpartisans they were indecisive “fence sitters” with their “mugs” on one side of the party divide and their “wumps” on the other.\n\n2.

The Committee of Fourteen turned to the surety companies rather than the Excise Department because the latter had no discretionary power. Its commissioners could revoked licenses, but they could not refuse to issue a license. See Committee of Fourteen to Albert J. Hopkins, 6 July 1910, box 1, C14.\n\n76.

For example, between Oct. 1906 and Nov. 1907, 19 percent of the proprietors arrested for liquor-law violations were women (111 men, 28 women, 11 indeterminate). See “Special Sessions,” Oct. 1907; “Special Sessions Cases Disposed Of October 1906 to September 1907, charged with violation of Sec. 322 of the Penal Code and the Liquor Tax Law,” [1907]; both file: “Court of Special Sessions,” box 65, C14.\n\n79.

The Committee of Fourteen needed the surety companies because the courts often decided in the favor of proprietors charged with liquor-law violations. For example, between Oct. 1906 and Nov. 1907, the Excise Department brought 142 cases of liquor-law violations to the Special Sessions Court. In 64 percent of these cases, the proprietors were able to keep their liquor licenses and, equally importantly, retain the right to acquire one the following year.

There were twenty-six people arrested over all, six of whom were women; however, the race of the arrestees is less well defined. At least six were Asian, one African-American, and two European-American, but the race of the other seventeen is not clear. Although people are usually categorized as white when no race is given, the content of the articles suggests that such an assumption cannot be made. The difficulty in determining the race of all the opium smokers is another sign that reputability was still more important than race when discussing vice during this period.\n\n32.
