        "text": "XOD Captain's Cup at Cowes Week 2024 - Day 5\n\nby Rory Paton 31 Jul 22:24 BST\n\nAfter a day off for no wind and a wonderful party sponsored by Hiscox and James Hallam insurers, quite a few of the fleet were grateful for a delay today. Mercifully the promised easterly kicked in just in time and we went racing from the RYS line at 16:30.\n\nWith a strong flood tide we were sensibly started under flag Z and there was a clear start. Early leaders from the start were Astralita, Mayfly and XRay and XL, oddly despite the tide, the right hand side of the course payed.\n\nAl Ashford's Foxglove gained the lead at Royal London YC and managed to gybe towards the Island shore on the run to Prince Consort. Behind them mayhem ensued, but she was followed towards the Shrape by Roger Yeoman's Xcitatation and Rory and Amanda Paton and Tim Hire's Mayfly. The wind started to die, on the beat to Norris once again the southerly route paid and Mayfly overhauled Excitation. At a shortened course at Goodall Racing, Foxglove won convincingly from Mayfly and Xcitation.\n\nSpecial mention today goes to the youth team on XL of Abby Hire, Kate and Tom Wharmby who on youth day finished 7th just ahead of the evergreen Barry Dunning in Crumpet with Carol Dunning and Mike Hobby.\n\nAfter 4 races the overall standings have been shaken up somewhat with X166 Swallow Ben McGrane, Richie Faulkner and James Ross moving up to first overall following her 4th today. With two days left there is all to play for.\n\nResults after Day 5:"
