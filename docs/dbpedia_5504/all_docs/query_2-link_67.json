        "text": "Governor: DEP Hire 68 More Staff To Deal With Marcellus Shale, Pass Severance Tax\n\nGov. Rendell today directed the Department of Environmental Protection to begin hiring 68 new personnel who will make sure that drilling companies obey state laws and act responsibly to protect water supplies. Again calls on General Assembly to pass a natural gas severance tax.\n\nDEP also will strengthen oil and gas regulations to improve well construction standards. These critical upgrades are designed to prevent gas leaks that can pose risks to the public and water quality.\n\n“Interest in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale formation is greater than ever before and as natural gas prices continue to rise, that interest will only increase,” said Gov. Rendell. “In fact, the industry has told us that they expect to apply for 5,200 permits to drill in the Marcellus Shale this year -- nearly three times the number of permits we issued in all of 2009.\n\n\"Given these conditions, an extraction tax is gaining widespread support across our state and I will again ask the General Assembly to enact such a levy. It is fair and affordable to drillers. They know it, and so do members of the House of Representatives who voted for it last year.\n\n“The actions I am announcing today, however, are about decisive, progressive protections for the people of Pennsylvania. We were able to hire 37 additional inspectors and permitting staff in 2009, but the industry’s projected growth in 2010 means that we need additional inspectors to ensure oil and gas companies follow environmental laws and regulations.\n\n'As I’ve said all along, we want to encourage the development of this resource because it’s a tremendous economic opportunity for the state, but we will not allow that to happen at the expense of our environment.”\n\nDEP performed 14,544 drilling site inspections in 2009 and took 678 enforcement actions against drillers for violations.\n\nThe 68 additional personnel will be funded entirely from money generated by new, higher permitting fees that were instituted in 2009—the first such increase since 1984. The new fees were put in place with bipartisan support from the General Assembly, industry and environmental organizations.\n\nThe Governor noted that given the need for these additional health and safety personnel and the dedicated funding source that is independent of the state’s General Fund, these new hires are exemptions to the general hiring freeze he instituted last year.\n\nDEP’s work to amend Pennsylvania’s oil and gas regulations will strengthen well construction standards and define a drilling company’s responsibility for responding to gas migration issues, such as when gas escapes a well or rock formation and seeps into homes or water wells. Specifically, he said the new regulations will:\n\n-- Require the casings of Marcellus Shale and other high-pressure wells to be tested and constructed with specific, oilfield-grade cement;\n\n-- Clarify the drilling industry’s responsibility to restore or replace water supplies affected by drilling;\n\n-- Establish procedures for operators to identify and correct gas migration problems without waiting for direction from DEP;\n\n-- Require drilling operators to notify DEP and local emergency responders immediately of gas migration problems;\n\n-- Require well operators to inspect every existing well quarterly to ensure each well is structurally sound, and report the results of those inspections to DEP annually; and\n\n-- Require well operators to notify DEP immediately if problems such as over-pressurized wells and defective casings are found during inspections.\n\n“These new draft regulations, which were developed through open meetings with experts in the industry, are designed to give Pennsylvanians peace of mind by bringing our state’s requirements up to par with other major gas producing states or, as in the case of the well casing requirements, to a level that is even more rigorous,” said Gov. Rendell.\n\nThe new regulations will be offered for public comment on January 29 before going through DEP’s formal rulemaking process.\n\nInterest in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale formation has been increasing. One third of the more than 6,200 oil and natural gas drilling permits DEP issued in 2009 were for drilling in the Marcellus Shale. By comparison, only four of the more than 6,000 permits issued in 2005 were for the Marcellus formation.\n\nFor more information, visit the DEP Marcellus Shale webpage.\n\nLong-Time Democratic Chair Of Senate Environmental Committee Ray Musto To Retire\n\nSen. Ray Musto (D-Luzerne), long-time Democratic Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, this week announced he will not seek re-election and will retire from the Senate at the end of his current term.\n\n\"After nearly 40 years of public service to the citizens of the northeast and seven terms serving the 14th Senatorial District, it is time to retire from the Senate,\" Sen. Musto said. \"I have been fortunate and blessed, and I am grateful for all the kindness that has been extended to me over the years.\"\n\nFor many years Sen. Musto has been the regarded as a leading voice on environmental issues in the Senate and as a fierce advocate for his district. He has been involved in the passage of every major state environmental law and program for the last 30 years.\n\nAmong the notable environmental laws and initiatives completed as a result of Musto's work:\n\n-- Curbside Recycling: Legislation that created Pennsylvania's curbside recycling program -- the largest in the country;\n\n-- Land Recycling: Pennsylvania's land recycling program--Acts 2, 3 and 4 of 1995 which has become the national model program for the effective re-use of abandoned industrial property;\n\n-- Growing Greener: Act 68 (1999) Pennsylvania's Growing Greener program that has led to the protection of open spaces and farmland preservation as well as water and sewer system upgrades;\n\n-- Air Pollution Control: Far-reaching changes to the Air Pollution Control Act (Act 95) that has led to steadily improving air quality;\n\n-- Hazardous Materials Spills: Act 165 (1990) a measure that enables counties to be better prepared in the event of a hazardous materials spill; and\n\n-- Establishment of Nescopeck State Park.\n\n\"It is amazing how much can be accomplished when no one worries about who gets the credit,\" Musto said, attributing his long tenure in the Senate and in public service to his dedicated staff and supportive family.\n\n\"My staff both in the district and Harrisburg has been quietly serving residents for nearly 40 years and doing a tremendous job meeting the needs of the local community,\" Musto said. \"They are hard-working, honest and determined to make sure the job is done correctly.\"\n\n\"They are great public servants who, along with my family, made great sacrifices over the years,\" Musto said. \"Being in public service is a tough job where criticism and cynicism come with the territory; but it is also a wonderful job because you can directly make a difference in the lives of people.\"\n\nSen. Musto is a Korean War veteran who served in the U.S. Army from 1951-53. He is a 1971 graduate of King's College in Wilkes-Barre. He holds Doctorate of Letters degrees from Kings and Wilkes Colleges. Musto has received many awards and honors for his work in the Senate.\n\nThe veteran lawmaker served in the state House from 1971 to 1980. He began his career when he was elected in a special election in 1971 to fill his late father James Musto's unexpired term. Musto was then elected to Congress in a special election in 1980. In 1982, he was elected to the state Senate. Musto has the distinction of being among only a few public servants to serve in the U.S.Congress, the state House and state Senate.\n\nThe senator's term will conclude on November 30.\n\nSenate Committee Told Drilling Wastewater Recycling Becoming More Effective\n\nRepresentatives of both the natural gas drilling industry and the Department of Environmental Protection told the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee today much more of the 3.4 million gallons of water used to drill and develop each Marcellus Shale well is being recycled by operators.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives of several groups and two Committee members expressed concern about whether DEP had enough staff to adequately handle both gas well permitting and enforcement and wastewater issues.\n\nThe number of Marcellus Shale gas well applications is predicted to more than double this year in Pennsylvania to 5,200 from the 1,984 issued last year.\n\nSteve Rhoads, East Resources, Inc. and the PA Marcellus Shale Coalition, said of the 3.4 million gallons of water used to develop and frack each Marcellus Shale well, about 25 percent (875,000 gallons) returns to the surface on average to be treated and properly disposed of. (DEP differed slightly saying up to 40 percent was returned on average.)\n\nAs a result of concerns with Total Dissolved Solids (primarily chlorides), drilling companies are moving to recycle more and more of their drilling wastewater Rhoads said. Some companies are reportedly are recycling as much as 90 to 95 percent of the drilling/frack water by treating it and taking it to the next drilling site.\n\nRhoads noted TDSs typically pass through most wastewater plants and the industry relies on the assimilation capacity of streams to deal with the remaining wastewater.\n\nOperators are also exploring the use of deep injection wells to dispose of the wastewater which are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhoads said the industry opposes the TDS regulations recently proposed by DEP saying a better approach would be to take a watershed view of the TDS problem through a Total Maximum Daily Load plan developed with the help of a local stakeholders group. He also said a comprehensive water monitoring network should be set up to help define and monitor the problem.\n\nSen. Lisa Baker (R-Luzerne) asked whether the provision of the state Oil and Gas Act requiring well water sampling and a presumption of a well causing problems within 1,000 feet of a gas well should be strengthened.\n\nRhoads said both DEP and EPA have told the industry there has not been a complaint about water contamination as a result of gas well fracking in Pennsylvania, noting the industry has over 60 years of experience with the technique.\n\nHe did say there have been instances where wells were improperly constructed that resulted in the migration of natural gas into water supplies causing problems for property owners.\n\nSen. Andrew Dinniman (D-Chester) asked whether the drilling industry would back up its claims about the lack of impact on water wells with a guarantee program, like the Chester County Landfill has, to guarantee the value of properties within a mile of a well\n\nRhoads said he did not think a guarantee was needed and the industry would stand behind its responsibilities to follow the rules on well drilling.\n\nJohn Hines, Deputy Secretary for Water Management at DEP, provided the Committee with an overview of wastewater issue and DEP's regulatory programs. He was assisted by Scott Perry, Director of the Bureau of Oil and Gas Management, and Dana Aunkst, Director of the Bureau of Water Standards and Facility Regulation.\n\nFirst he said he wanted to clear up confusion over the contents of fracking fluids used in the gas well development process. He said the chemicals used in the fracking fluids have been posted on the DEP Marcellus Shale webpage for all to see, although the precise proportion of the chemicals are trade secrets.\n\nHines said the agency is working with a subcommittee of the Water Resources Advisory Committee to develop new standards for Total Dissolved Solids discharges because many streams and rivers have very little capacity to assimilate additional TDSs.\n\nHe noted \"the capacity to treat the expected levels of wastewater (from drilling operations) is not yet available. E\n\nven with reuse and recycling, we must still find a solution for the flow-back and production fluids that cannot be reused... the department fully anticipates the need for increased treatment capacity, even at the reduced flow-back estimates.\"\n\nHe said TDSs come from a variety of sources including acid mine drainage, stormwater runoff, meat processing plants as well as drilling operations.\n\nHines said the department is also working to improve natural gas well construction standards to protect the public from gas migration.\n\n\"The regulations and protections I've described above are important to the protection of our natural resources,\" said Hines. \"However, they mean very little if the department does not have the staff necessary to inspect well sites and oversee the environmentally protective development of this resource.\"\n\nHines said DEP was able to add 37 new staff during 2009 funded by increases in drilling permit fees for inspection and drilling permit review. Fee increases will also be proposed shortly to help fund wastewater treatment and water quality permit reviews and enforcement.\n\nSen. Baker said there is a significant concern in her area that there is no local DEP presence in Wilkes-Barre covering gas well drilling saying the staff added in Williamsport is good, but that's a one or two hour ride from where drilling is occurring in her district.\n\nSen. Baker also asked DEP to look at certifying the operators of drilling wastewater treatment plants like they are for municipal wastewater plants.\n\nSen. Ted Erickson (R-Delaware) said he was concerned about whether DEP had the capacity to do the permit reviews and the enforcement needed to properly oversee thousands of new natural gas wells. He also said there are issues of consistency of enforcement and permitting between regions.\n\nSen. Elder Vogel (R-Beaver) said the capacity of streams and rivers to absorb additional TDSs is not only a problem for an expanding oil and gas industry, it was also a concern for the coal mining industry and how it is going to expand.\n\nHines said the TDS stakeholder group was coming up with some interesting suggestions for dealing with these issues and would be reporting its results in the next few months.\n\nPeter Slack, PA Municipal Authorities Association, said his group has a concern about whether DEP has the capacity to oversee the drilling and wastewater issues. He noted DEP just suspended major parts of the wastewater plant operator certification program because of recent budget cuts.\n\nIn response, Sen. Mary Jo White said the new gas well drilling application fees will bring the agency significant new resources, adding, \"We want to be sure budget constraints do not result in under enforcement of regulations.\"\n\nErika Staaf, Clean Water Advocate with PennEnvironment, said DEP's wastewater program should be beefed up to include a cradle to grave water monitoring system from the time water is withdrawn for use by a driller to when it is ultimately disposed of.\n\nShe also said PennEnvironment encourages wastewater reuse to the maximum extent and setting tougher standards for the discharge of Total Dissolved Solids.\n\nDavid Kohl, CWM Environmental, previewed wastewater treatment technology his company has produced to reduce the wastewater used in well development by 85 percent.\n\nPaul Hart, President of Hart Resource Technologies, Inc. & Pennsylvania Brine, outlined how three drilling wastewater plants his company operators can be part of the solution for wastewater issues.\n\nAdditional written comments were submitted to the Committee by: Aqua America, Chester Environmental Partnership, Bartramian Audubon Society, Greater Wyoming Valley Audubon Society and The League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Today’s hearing provided an overview of the challenges faced from Marcellus Shale wastewater, and how we can best meet them,” said Sen. Mary Jo White. “This is a tremendous opportunity for Pennsylvania to produce not only an abundant supply of clean energy, but scores of well-paying jobs. At the same time, citizens have a right to expect that their natural resources and communities are being respected, that the gas is produced safely, and that our land and water resources are protected. I am confident that we can achieve the proper balance.”\n\nFor copies of testimony and comments as well as a video of the entire hearing, visit the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee webpage.\n\nAlso visit DEP's Marcellus Shale webpage for more background information.\n\nSen. Mary Jo White (R-Venango) serves as Majority Chair of the Committee and Sen. Ray Musto (D-Luzerne) serves as Minority Chair.\n\nEPA Announces Eyes On Drilling Tipline For Citizens\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced the creation of the “Eyes on Drilling” tipline for citizens to report non-emergency suspicious activity related to oil and natural gas development.\n\nThe agency is asking citizens to call 1-877-919-4EPA (toll free) if they observe what appears to be illegal disposal of wastes or other suspicious activity. Anyone may also send reports by email to: eyesondrilling@epa.gov. Citizens may provide tips anonymously if they don’t want to identify themselves.\n\nIn the event of an emergency, such as a spill or release of hazardous material, including oil, to the environment, citizens are advised to call the National Response Center at 1-800-424-8802.\n\nPublic concern about the environmental impacts of oil and natural gas drilling has increased in recent months, particularly regarding development of the Marcellus Shale formation where a significant amount of activity is occurring.\n\nWhile EPA doesn’t grant permits for oil and gas drilling operations, there are EPA regulations which may apply to the storage of petroleum products and drilling fluids. The agency is also very concerned about the proper disposal of waste products, and protecting air and water resources.\n\nEPA wants to get a better understanding of what people are experiencing and observing as a result of these drilling activities. The information collected may also be useful in investigating industry practices.\n\nThe agency works closely with state and local officials, as well as industry and public interest groups, to ensure that oil and natural gas drilling occurs in a manner which is protective of human health and the environment and complies with applicable laws. The agency is also counting on concerned citizens to report unusual or suspicious activity related to drilling operations.\n\nEPA is asking citizens to report the location, time and date of such activity, as well as the materials, equipment and vehicles involved and any observable environmental impacts.\n\nThe Marcellus Shale geologic formation contains one of the largest mostly untapped reserves of natural gas in the United States. It underlies significant portions of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and New York, and smaller portions of Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, and Kentucky.\n\nInterest in developing Marcellus Shale has increased because recent improvements in natural gas extraction technology and higher energy prices now make recovering the gas more profitable.\n\nOperators produce this gas through a process called hydraulic fracturing (fracking). Fracking requires drilling a well thousands of feet below the land’s surface and pumping down the well under pressure millions of gallons of water, sand, and chemicals to fracture the shale.\n\nThe process allows the gas trapped in the formation to flow to the well bore. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the fluid flows back to the surface. This “flowback” fluid consists of fracking fluid and brines which contain dissolved minerals from the formation.\n\nOperators are urged to recycle their flowback water for reuse in the fracking process, but some of the flowback is taken offsite for disposal. Chemicals used in the process are often stored on-site. Spills can occur when utilizing these chemicals or when transporting or storing wastewater, which can result in the contamination of surface water or ground water, which is used for many purposes including drinking water.\n\nFor more information, visit the Eyes On Drilling webpage.\n\nDCNR Sponsors South Mountain Regional Conservation Landscape Initiative Summit Feb. 19\n\nCommunity leaders from throughout the South Mountain region are invited to a summit in February to discuss ways to enhance its sense of place and expand the region's economy by capitalizing on its natural and cultural resources.\n\nScheduled for February 19, the first South Mountain Summit is part of the region's Conservation Landscape Initiative – an effort by the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to engage communities and local partners with state agencies and funding partners to conserve and protect the high-quality natural and cultural resources and enhance the region's economic viability.\n\n\"With its fertile farmlands, clean waterways, renowned trout streams and vast woodlands, the more than 400,000-acre South Mountain region is truly blessed,\" Acting DCNR Secretary John Quigley said. \"This summit will help leaders discover the natural and cultural assets of the region and learn why they are important to the local economy; learn about the partnership working to promote the region's assets; and share their thoughts on what future actions will be crucial to the economic vitality of the region and its sense of place.\"\n\nThe South Mountain Conservation Landscape Initiative – one of seven such regional initiatives in the state – encompasses Adams, Cumberland, Franklin and York counties. The South Mountain Partnership working on the initiative, led by DCNR and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy with many others, promotes and hopes to encourage economic growth and revitalize local communities based on the abundance of recreational and heritage tourism opportunities.\n\nThe summit will be held at the Penn Township Fire Hall in Newville, Cumberland County, on February 19 from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Registration is required. The cost per person is $15.\n\nActing Secretay Quigley will begin the summit by discussing an innovative model of conservation and preservation of sense of place on the state and local scale.\n\nThree speakers will share the importance of the region's resources. Scott Weidensaul, an internationally known wildlife biologist and author of two dozen books, is a featured speaker. Also featured will be Dan Marcucci, a scholar of landscape studies and planning and a South Mountain native. The last speaker will be Lenwood Sloan, the Director of Culture and Heritage Tourism in Pennsylvania.\n\nFeb. 18 Program\n\nPrior to the summit, the first of the South Mountain Speaker Series will be held the evening of February 18 at the Woods Center at the Capitol Theatre in Chambersburg. A reception will begin at 6 p.m., followed by a lecture at 7 p.m. The lecture, \"South Mountain: Cradle of Conservation,\" will be given by Shippensburg University professor Susan Rimby. A panel discussion will follow.\n\nSouth Mountain is at the northern end of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Communities surrounding South Mountain have thrived off the fertile limestone agricultural lands, the timber that fed the iron furnaces, the plentiful game and wildlife, and off the abundance of pure spring water that is captured by the mountains permeable soils and released into the valleys. A rich cultural heritage exists in communities like Gettysburg, Chambersburg and Carlisle, and many smaller quaint villages.\n\nThe foresight of visionaries like Joseph Rothrock and Gifford Pinchot has protected thousands of acres of state forest land in the region. The 85,000-acre Michaux State Forest in the region is one of the largest intact forests between Harrisburg and Washington, D.C.\n\nFor registration and other information, visit the South Mountain Conservation Landscape Initiative webpage or call the Appalachian Trail Conservancy at 717-258-5771."
