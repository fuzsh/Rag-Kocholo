Rendell, and lawyer for the Hershey Trust, pled guilty to a wire fraud charge May 10, 2016 at the Federal Courthouse in Harrisburg, Pa. Mark Pynes | mpynes@pennlive.com\n\n(Mark Pynes | mpynes@pennlive.com)\n\nGood Thursday Morning, Fellow Seekers.\n\nThe Republican and Democratic candidates vying to replace embattled\n\nAttorney General Kathleen Kane\n\nwere each touched by the federal corruption sting that brought down a former senior Rendell administration aide.\n\nRepublican John Rafferty and Democrat Josh Shapiro, both of Montgomery County, were separately touched by the sting that prompted John H. Estey, 53, of Ardmore, to plead guilty to a wire fraud count in U.S. District Court in Harrisburg on Tuesday, The Tribune-Review reports this morning.\n\nShapiro, a Montgomery County Commissioner, $2,500 campaign contribution from Estey in June 2010, the Trib's Brad Bumsted reported.\n\nAccording to published reports, Estey had been given $20,000 by the FBI to donate to three lawmakers and one legislative caucus to benefit the cause of bogus company set up by the feds.\n\nEstey donated just $7,000 and allegedly kept $13,000 for himself, various news outlets, including PennLive, reported.\n\nRafferty, meanwhile, \"was one of 20 state senators of both parties who co-sponsored the bill,\" that was supposed to benefit the FBI's sham, textbook recycling company, The Trib reported.\n\nShapiro's spokesman, Joe Radosevich confirmed the donation, telling Bumsted that the campaign had \"no record of any meeting with the 'executives' of the phony company or discussion of the bill that passed the Senate. The legislation never came to the House where Josh served.\"\n\nIn 2011, Estey was working in the government affairs practice of the Philadelphia firm Ballard Spahr when he began cooperating with federal investigators.\n\nRafferty told The Trib that he \"reviewed the co-sponsorship memorandum,\" for the bill sponsored by the late Sen. Ray Musto of Luzerne County, who was also later snared on federal corruption charges.\n\n\"The program appeared to be a good idea that would benefit schools and the environment,\" Rafferty told the newspaper. \"...With the bill passing unanimously in the Senate, I think it's clear that no one knew they were not a real company.\"\n\nThe rest of the day's news starts now.\n\nGroups are aligning against legislation that protect gay, transgender people, The Post-Gazette reports.\n\nOne of Philly's more colorful feuds has been settled, PhillyMag reports.\n\nA midstate hospital merger could be the first of many, WITF-FM reports.\n\nNewsWorks/WHYY-FM explains why ward leaders are such a big deal in Philadelphia.\n\nSome tough questions 'bubbled up' during Philly Council's debate on a proposed soda tax, BillyPenn reports.\n\nVaping shops in the Lehigh Valley are worried that new federal regs will put them out of business, The Morning Call reports.\n\nWelcome new Pa. state Sen Tom Killion, R-Delaware, who won the 19th District special election for the seat formerly held by Dominic Pileggi (PoliticsPA).\n\nStateline.org looks at the comeback of tuberculosis and what state governments are doing to fight it.\n\nPolitico looks at Donald Trump's policy problems.\n\nRoll Call takes a look at the 'unprecedented' actions of one anti-abortion group.\n\nWhat Goes On.\n\nThe House Gaming Oversight Committee takes its show on the road today, holding a 10 a.m., public hearing at Parx Casino in Bucks County. On the agenda: competitiveness in surrounding states, fantasy sports and sports betting.\n\nWhat Goes On (Nakedly Political Edition)\n\nDauphin County DA Ed Marsico holds a 5:30 p.m. reception at the Firehouse Restaurant on Second Street. Admission runs $50 to $1,000, dependent, as ever, on the intensity of your desire to bask in his reflected glow.\n\nYou Say It's Your Birthday Dept.\n\nFormer PennLive/Patriot-News Publisher John Kirkpatrick celebrates another year. Congrats, boss, Enjoy the day.\n\nHeavy Rotation.\n\nThe sun is finally threatening to come out, so here's some sunshine-y pop to further encourage that effort:\n\nThursday's Gratuitous Baseball Link.\n\nBaltimore clobbered Minnesota 9-2 in a day game in the Twin Cities on Wednesday. The Birds' Mark Trumbo, Chris Davis and Adam Jones all helped out on the way to the win."
