A fluorescent clock reaction is described that is based on the principles of the Landolt iodine reaction but uses the potent fluorescence quenching properties of triiodide to abruptly extinguish the ultraviolet fluorescence of optical brighteners present in liquid laundry detergents. The reaction uses easily obtained household products. One variation illustrates the sequential steps and mechanisms of the reaction; other variations maximize the dramatic impact of the demonstration; and a variation that uses liquid detergent in the Briggs Rauscher reaction yields a striking oscillating luminescence. The iodine fluorescence quenching clock reaction can be used in the classroom to explore not only the principles of redox chemistry and reaction kinetics, but also the photophysics of fluorescent pH probes and optical quenching.

Russell, Rod; Bless, Stephan; Blinkova, Alexandra; Chen, Tiffany

2012-03-01

Iodine pentoxide-aluminum thermite reactions have been driven by impacts at 1000 m/s on steel plates 3 mm or thicker. This reaction releases iodine gas that is known to be a sporicide. To test the impact reactions for sporicidal effects, reactions took place in closed chambers containing dried Bacillus subtilis spores. The reduction in colony-forming units was dependent on the exposure time; long exposure times resulted in a 105 decrease in germination rate. This was shown to be due to the gas exposure rather than the heat or turbulence. Sporicidal effectiveness was increased by adding neodymium and saran resin.

Nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media.

To provide a detailed analysis of the latest findings on the mechanisms underlying the nonimmediate reactions to iodinated contrast media and comment on the recent advances in diagnosis, focusing on the roles of the skin test, drug provocation test (DPT), and lymphocyte transformation test (LTT). Several studies have reported new findings supporting an important role for T-lymphocytes in the nonimmediate reactions to iodinated contrast media. The LTT has been used as an in-vitro tool for diagnosis, but with variable results. However, the inclusion of autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells as professional antigen-presenting cells has improved the sensitivity of this test. Regarding in-vivo diagnosis, although skin testing has been routine, it has now been shown that its sensitivity and negative predictive value are low. Recent studies have demonstrated that the DPT is a well tolerated and useful procedure that is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of nonimmediate hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media. Nonimmediate reactions to contrast media are usually T-cell mediated. Diagnosis is based on skin testing, although its sensitivity and negative predictive value are not optimal. Consequently, drug provocation testing is often needed to confirm the diagnosis and also to seek alternative contrast media that can be tolerated.

Iodine pentoxide-aluminum thermite reactions have been driven by impacts at 1000 m/s on steel plates 3 mm or thicker. The activation energy of this material reaction is 197 J/g. The reactivity is increased by reducing grain size. This reaction releases iodine gas that is known to be a sporicide. In order to test the impact reactions for sporicidal effects, reactions took place in closed chambers containing dried Bacillus subtilis spores. The reduction in colony-forming units was dependent on the exposure time; long exposure times resulted in a 105 decrease in germination rate. This was shown to be due to the gas exposure and not the heat or turbulence. Sporicidal effectiveness was increased by adding neodymium and saran resin. The sporicidal effect is very dependent on exposure time, ranging from about 90% kill for times on the order of a second to 99.99% for one-hour times.

2013-08-01

The objectives of this article are to review allergy-type reactions to iodinated contrast media and the protocols utilized to prevent or reduce the occurrence of these adverse reactions in high-risk patients. We will begin by discussing the types or classifications of the adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media. We will then discuss reaction mechanisms, identify the patients at highest risk for adverse reactions, and clarify common misperceptions about the risk. Finally, we will discuss the actions of the medications used to help reduce or prevent allergy-type reactions to iodinated contrast media, the protocols used to help reduce or prevent contrast reactions in high-risk patients, and the potential side effects of these medications. We will also discuss the high-risk patient who has received premedication due to a prior index reaction and discuss the risk of having a subsequent reaction, termed "breakthrough reaction." Identifying patient at high risk for an "allergy-type" reaction to contrast media is an essential task of the radiologist. Prevention of or reduction of the risk of an adverse reaction is critical to patient safety. If an examination can be performed without contrast in a patient at high risk for an allergy-type reaction, it may be appropriate to avoid contrast. However, there are situations where contrast media is necessary, and the radiologist plays a vital role in preventing or mitigating an allergy-type reaction.

Purpose âTo test the hypothesis that the incomplete diagnosis "iodine allergy" is a possibly dangerous concept for patients under routine radiologic conditions. Materials and Methods â300 patients with a history of an "iodine allergy" were retrospectively screened and compared with two age-, sex-, and procedure-matched groups of patients either diagnosed with a nonspecific "iodine contrast medium (ICM) allergy" or an allergy to a specific ICM agent. For all groups, the clinical symptoms of the most recent past adverse drug reaction (ADR), prophylactic actions taken for subsequent imaging, and ultimate outcome were recorded and analyzed. Results âThe diagnosis "iodine allergy" was not otherwise specified in 84.3â% patients. For this group, in most cases, the symptoms of the previous ADRs were not documented. In contrast, the type of ADR was undocumented in only a minority of patients in the comparison groups. In the group of patients with an "iodine allergy" the percentage of unenhanced CT scans was greater than within the other two groups (36.7â% vs. 28.7â%/18.6â%). ADRs following prophylactic measures were only observed in the "iodine allergy" group (OR of 9.24Â 95â% CI 1.16â-â73.45; pâ<â0.04). Conclusion âThis data confirms the hypothesis that the diagnosis "iodine allergy" is potentially dangerous and results in uncertainty in clinical management and sometimes even ineffective prophylactic measures. Key points â Â· The term "iodine allergy" is imprecise, because it designates allergies against different substance classes, such as disinfectants with complexed iodine and contrast media containing covalently bound iodine.. Â· There is a clear correlation between the exactness of the diagnosis - from the alleged "iodine allergy" to "contrast media allergy" to naming the exact culprit CM - and the quality of documentation of the symptoms.. Â· Management of patients diagnosed with "iodine allergy" was associated with uncertainty leading to

Reactions of vitamin A with acceptors of electrons. Interactions with iodine and the formation of iodide

1. The reactions of retinol and retinoic acid with iodine were investigated since knowledge of the chemical reactions of vitamin A with acceptors of electrons may shed light on its biochemical mode of action. 2. Colloidal retinol, but not retinoic acid, reacts with iodine to yield a blueâgreen complex that rapidly decomposes, giving iodide and an unknown species with Î»max. at 870mÎ¼. 3. In addition, both retinol and retinoic acid reduce iodine to iodide by a reaction that does not involve an intermediate coloured complex; this reaction appears to yield unstable carbonium ion derivatives of the vitamin. 4. The presence of water greatly facilitates the production of iodide from vitamin A and iodine. 5. Possible chemical pathways involved in these reactions are discussed. 6. It is suggested that the chemical properties of retinol and retinoic acid that underlie their biochemical behaviour might be apparent only when the molecules are at a lipidâwater interface, and that vitamin A might be expected to react with a number of different electron acceptors in vivo.

Anaphylactoidlike reactions occur during the nonvascular administration of iodinated contrast media. Many of these reactions have been severe. These reactions have occurred with many procedures, including gastrointestinal imaging, cystography, sialography, and hysterosalpingography. This article reviews reports of these reactions. It also reviews what the literature recommends concerning how to deal with individuals undergoing these procedures who are at a higher risk for anaphylactoidlike reactions.

Adverse reactions to iodinated and gadolinium contrast media are an important clinical issue. Although some guidelines have proposed oral steroid premedication protocols to prevent adverse reactions, some patients may have reactions to contrast media in spite of premedication (breakthrough reaction; BTR).The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency, type and severity of BTR when following an oral steroid premedication protocol. All iodinated and gadolinium contrast-enhanced radiologic examinations between August 2011 and February 2013 for which the premedication protocol was applied in our institution were assessed for BTRs. The protocol was applied to a total of 252 examinations (153 patients, ages 15-87 years; 63 males, 90 females). Of these, 152 were for prior acute adverse reactions to contrast media, 85 were for a history of bronchial asthma, and 15 were for other reasons. There were 198 contrast enhanced CTs and 54 contrast enhanced MRIs. There were nine BTR (4.5%) for iodinated contrast media, and only one BTR (1.9%) for gadolinium contrast media: eight were mild and one was moderate. No patient who had a mild index reaction (IR) had a severe BTR. Incidence of BTRs when following the premedication protocol was low. This study by no means proves the efficacy of premedication, but provides some support for following a premedication protocol to improve safety of contrast-enhanced examinations when prior adverse reactions are mild, or when there is a history of asthma.

To investigate the pathomechanisms involved in cases of immediate hypersensitivity reactions occurring after the administration of iodinated contrast media. Patients having presented clinical signs of immediate hypersensitivity suggesting allergy after iodinated contrast medium were investigated. Histamine and tryptase concentrations were measured, and/or skin tests were performed. Patients with positive skin tests to the culprit contrast agent were classified as IgE-mediated allergic hypersensitivity (Group I) and patients with negative skin tests as non-allergic hypersensitivity (Group II). 38 patients were included. Most reactions appeared after non-ionic (n = 32). Reactions were more frequently severe following ionic than non-ionic (p = 0.014). Skin testing was not performed in 11 patients. Skin tests with the culprit contrast agent were negative in 26% of the patients (Group II, n = 7) whereas they were found positive with the contrast agent in 73% of the patients (Group I, n = 19). Latex-induced reaction was diagnosed in one patient, and was consequently excluded from the cohort. In Group I, the frequency of cross-reactivity with the other commercialized iodinated contrast media was low (7%). Cardiovascular signs were present in Group I (52.6%, n = 10), and absent in Group II (p = 0.023). Histamine and tryptase concentrations were higher in patients who had cardiovascular signs (p < 0.02). Immediate reactions with clinical signs suggesting allergy along with positive skin tests with the administered contrast agent confirm immediate allergic hypersensitivity (anaphylaxis) to this agent. Consequently, the culprit contrast agent should be definitely avoided as well as cross-reactive ICM in order to prevent further recurrences. Copyright Â© 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Controlling SolidâLiquid Conversion Reactions for a Highly Reversible Aqueous ZincâIodine Battery

Pan, Huilin; Li, Bin; Mei, Donghai

Aqueous rechargeable batteries are desirable for many energy storage applications due to their low cost and high safety. However, low capacity and short cycle life are the significant obstacles to their practical applications. Here, we demonstrate a highly reversible aqueous zinc-iodine battery using encapsulated iodine in microporous active carbon fibers (ACFs) as cathode materials through the rational control of solid-liquid conversion reactions. The experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the effects of solvents and properties of carbon hosts, e.g. pore size, surface chemistries, on the adsorption of iodine species. The rational manipulation of the competitionmoreÂ Â» between the adsorption in carbon and solvation in electrolytes for iodine species is responsible for the high reversibility and cycling stability. The zinc-iodine batteries deliver a high capacity of 180 mAh g-1 at 1C and a stable cycle life over 3000 cycles with ~90% capacity retention as well as negligible self-discharge. We believe the principles for stabilizing the zinc-iodine system could provide new insight into conversion systems such as Li-S systems.Â«Â less

The aluminium and iodine pentoxide reaction for the destruction of spore forming bacteria.

PubMed

Clark, Billy R; Pantoya, Michelle L

2010-10-21

The threat of biological weapons is a major concern in the present day and has led to studying methods to neutralize spore forming bacteria. A new technique involves the use of a thermite reaction that exhibits biocidal properties to limit bacterial growth. The objective was to examine the influence on bacteria growth upon spore exposure to thermite reactions with and without biocidal properties. Three thermites are considered: two that have biocidal properties (aluminium (Al) combined with iodine pentoxide (I(2)O(5)) and Al combined with silver oxide (Ag(2)O)); and, one that produces a highly exothermic reaction but has no biocidal properties (Al combined with iron oxide (Fe(2)O(3))). Results show that Al + I(2)O(5) is extremely effective at neutralizing spores after only one hour of exposure. The temperature generated by the reaction was not determined to be an influential factor affecting spore growth kinetics. Further analysis of the thermite reactions revealed that the Al + I(2)O(5) reaction produces iodine gas that effectively interacts with the spores and neutralizes bacteria growth, while the Al + Ag(2)O reaction temperature does not vaporize silver. In the condensed phase silver does not interact with the spores enough to neutralize bacteria growth. This study gives evidence that a thermite can be used as a stable transportation and delivery system for biocidal gas.

Graphitic carbons have been used as conductive supports for developing rechargeable batteries. However, the classic ion intercalation in graphitic carbon has yet to be coupled with extrinsic redox reactions to develop rechargeable batteries. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of a free-standing, flexible nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped hierarchically porous graphitic carbon for iodine loading by pyrolysis of polyaniline coated cellulose wiper. We find that heteroatoms could provide additional defect sites for encapsulating iodine while the porous carbon skeleton facilitates redox reactions of iodine and ion intercalation. The combination of ion intercalation with redox reactions of iodine allows for developing rechargeable iodine-carbon batteries free from the unsafe lithium/sodium metals, and hence eliminates the long-standing safety issue. The unique architecture of the hierarchically porous graphitic carbon with heteroatom doping not only provides suitable spaces for both iodine encapsulation and cation intercalation but also generates efficient electronic and ionic transport pathways, thus leading to enhanced performance.Carbon-based electrodes able to intercalate Li + and Na + ions have been exploited for high performing energy storage devices. Here, the authors combine the ion intercalation properties of porous graphitic carbons with the redox chemistry of iodine to produce iodine-carbon batteries with high reversible capacities.

For iodination ((125/127)I) of tyrosine-containing peptides, chloramin-T, Pre-Coated Iodo-Gen(Â®) tubes and Iodo-Beads(Â®) (Pierce) are commonly used for in vitro radioligand investigations and there have been reliant vendors hereof for decades. However, commercial availability of these radio-iodinated peptides is decreasing. For continuation of our research in this field we investigated and optimized (radio-)iodination of somatostatin analogues. In literature, radioiodination using here described somatostatin analogues and iodination techniques are described separately. Here we present an overview, including High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) separation and characterisation by mass spectrometry, to obtain mono- and di-iodinated analogues. Reaction kinetics of (125/127)I iodinated somatostatin analogues were investigated as function of reaction time and concentration of reactants, including somatostatin analogues, iodine and oxidizing agent. To our knowledge, for the here described somatostatin analogues, no (127)I iodination and optimization are described. (Radio-)iodinated somatostatin analogues could be preserved with a >90% radiochemical purity for 1 month after reversed phase HPLC-purification.

This work presents a new experimental kinetic study at 39Â° and 50Â° of the iodine oxidation by hydrogen peroxide. The results allow us to obtain the temperature effect on the rate constants previously proposed at 25Â° for our model of the Bray-Liebhafsky oscillating reaction (G. Schmitz, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2010, 12, 6605.). The values calculated with the model are in good agreement with many experimental results obtained under very different experimental conditions. Numerical simulations of the oscillations observed formerly by different authors are presented, including the evolutions of the iodine, hydrogen peroxide, iodide ions and oxygen concentrations. Special attention is paid to the perturbing effects of oxygen and of the iodine loss to the gas phase.

The underlying mechanism of non-ionic iodinated contrast media-related immediate reactions was evaluated in this study. Patients presenting at least grade II immediate reactions after non-ionic iodinated contrast media injection were enrolled. Basophil activation was evaluated by flow cytometry. The plasma concentration of human terminal complement complex SC5b-9, as well as concentrations of serum chymase, tryptase, human mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, human prostaglandin D2, and total IgE were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The basophil activation percentage was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (17.94Â±21.06% vs 3.45Â±1.49%). The plasma concentration of human terminal complement complex SC5b-9 and concentrations of serum chymase, human mast cell carboxypeptidase A3, prostaglandin D2, tryptase, and total IgE were also significantly increased (236.99Â±318.21 vs 49.70Â±30.41ng/mL, 0.41Â±0.49 vs 0.09Â±0.06ng/mL, 1.17Â±0.67 vs 0.30Â±0.17ng/mL, 203.52Â±137.27 vs 102.28Â±48.72pg/mL, 3.81Â±0.22 vs 2.70Â±0.16ng/mL, 102.00Â±51.84 vs 19.97Â±2.75ng/mL, respectively). Both mast cells and basophils were activated in non-ionic iodinated contrast media to mediate immediate hypersensitivity, and mast cells may be involved. Different mechanisms, including IgE-dependent, complement-dependent, and direct membrane effects, contributed to mast cell and basophil activation. Individual patients may use a single or combined mechanism involving single or combined mast cells and basophils.

Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) to iodinated contrast media (ICMs) remain a common clinical concern. Positive skin test and basophil activation test results suggest a specific IgE-mediated mechanism in some cases. Skin test and controlled challenge test (CCT) are useful to manage these patients. To study clinical and allergologic features of IHRs to ICMs in a Spanish tertiary hospital during a 7-year period. Demographic and clinical data concerning the reaction were recorded. Patients treated at the Allergy Department of Hospital General Universitario Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n, Madrid, Spain, underwent skin tests. In those with positive results, CCTs with an alternative skin-test-negative ICM was performed. Global reaction rate was calculated and compared for each ICM. A total of 342 reactions occurred in 329 patients. Cutaneous symptoms were the most common (87.7%). A total of 196 patients underwent an allergy workup, 15 (7.6%) of whom had positive skin test results. Reactions were more severe in patients with positive vs negative skin test results (grade 1, 46.7% vs 73.6%; grade 2, 33.3% vs 20.9%; grade 3, 20% vs 5.46%; P < .05). Three patients had cross-reactivity to 3 ICMs, all including ioversol and iomeprol. Six patients allergic to iopamidol tolerated ioversol and 1 tolerated iomeprol. Four patients allergic to ioversol and 1 allergic to iomeprol tolerated iopamidol. The global reaction rate was 0.2%, differing for each ICM (iopamidol, 0.14%; ioversol, 0.2%; and iomeprol, 0.4%; P < .001). Positive skin test results were found in a low percentage of patients in whom skin test-based CCT identified an alternative non-cross-reactive ICM. Low-grade cross-reactivity was found, especially between iopamidol and ioversol. Reactions were more severe in patients with positive skin test results. The reaction rate was greater for iomeprol compared with iopamidol (reaction rate, 2.8%) and ioversol (reaction rate, 2%). This study identified a possible underlying

Iodine is a biophilic element that is important for human health, both as an essential component of several thyroid hormonesÂ and, on the other hand, as a potential carcinogen in the form of radioiodine generated by anthropogenic nuclear activity. Iodine exists in multiple oxidation states (-1, 0, +1, +3, +5, and +7), primarily as molecular iodine (I 2 ), iodide (I - ), iodate [Formula: see text] , or organic iodine (org-I). The mobility of iodine in the environment is dependent on its speciation and a series of redox, complexation, sorption, precipitation, and microbial reactions. Over the last 15years, there have been significant advances in iodine biogeochemistry, largely spurred by renewed interest in the fate of radioiodine in the environment. We review the biogeochemistry of iodine, with particular emphasis on the microbial processes responsible for volatilization, accumulation, oxidation, and reduction of iodine, as well as the exciting technological potential of these fascinating microorganisms and enzymes.

DARs to contrast media are not rare but are often not recognized as being linked to contrast administration and may be falsely ascribed to other drugs. These side effects are problematic because the patient is usually without medical supervision.

The chemical iodination of an imidoester (methyl-p-hydroxybenzimidate, Wood et al. (1975) Anal. Biochem. 68, 339) and subsequent coupling of iodinated imidoester (IIE) to protein is an indirect method of iodinating proteins that is specific for the epsilon amino group of lysine residues and maintains the positive charge on the amino group at physiological pH. Purification of the IIE from chloramine-T and free iodine by benzene extraction eliminates the need for isoelectric precipitation and produces a more time- and cost-efficient IIE preparation and purification protocol. The separation of free from protein-bound label by chromatography, using centrifugal elution, provides a separation method that is rapid and efficient, without the generation of large volumes of radioactive wastes characteristic of conventional chromatographic and dialysis methods. To optimize the parameters of labeling protein with IIE, a systematic assessment of the effects of pH, reactant concentrations, and reaction time was made using purified cardiac actin and gizzard alpha-actinin. The parameters were defined to achieve an average labeling ratio of one IIE per protein polypeptide. The data demonstrate that both proteins appear to be labeled at the same rate and define several determining factors that limit the rate and extent of IIE incorporation into protein.

The reaction between iodine and azide ions induced by thiopental was utilized as a postcolumn reaction for chromatographic determination of thiopental. The method is based on the separation of thiopental on an Nova-Pak CN HP column with an acetonitrile-aqueous solution of sodium azide as a mobile phase, followed by spectrophotometric measurement of the residual iodine (lambda=350 nm) from the postcolumn iodine-azide reaction induced by thiopental after mixing an iodine solution containing iodide ions with the column effluent containing azide ions and thiopental. Chromatograms obtained for thiopental showed negative peaks as a result of the decrease in background absorbance. The detection limit (defined as S/N=3) was 20 nM (0.4 pmol injected amount) for thiopental. Calibration graphs, plotted as peak area versus concentrations, were linear from 40 nM. The elaborated method was applied to determine thiopental in urine samples. The detection limit (defined as S/N=3) was 0.025 nmol/ml urine. Calibration graphs, plotted as peak area versus concentrations, were linear from 0.05 nmol/ml urine. Authentic urine samples were analyzed, thiopental was determined at nmol/ml urine level.

Comparisons of mental clocks.

Subjects in three experiments were presented with pairs of clock times and were required to choose the one in which the hour and minute hand formed the smaller angle. In Experiments 1 and 2, the times were presented digitally, necessitating a transformation into symbolic representations from which the angular size difference could be inferred. The results revealed orderly symbolic distance effects so that comparison reaction time increased as the angular size difference decreased. Moreover, subjects generally reported using imagery to make the judgment, and subjects scoring high on test of imagery ability were faster than those scoring low on such tests. Experiment 3 added a direct perceptual condition in which subjects compared angles between pairs of hands on two drawn (analog) clocks, as well as a mixed condition involving one digital and one analog clock time. The results showed comparable distance effects for all conditions. In addition, reaction time increased from the perceptual, to the mixed, to the pure-digital condition. These results are consistent with predictions from an image-based dual-coding theory.

Non-immediate reactions to iodine contrast media (ICM) affect 2â5% of patients receiving these agents. We studied the immunological mechanisms involved in patients with a confirmed non-immediate reaction, maculopapular exanthema, after administration of ICM. The diagnosis was carried out by skin testing or drug provocation test. The immunological study was performed in sequential peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken from the onset of the reaction by flow cytometry and in skin biopsy by immunohistochemistry, with specific recognition by the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) with different ICM. Flow cytometry showed an increase in the different activation markers [CD69, CD25 and human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR)] and the skin homing receptor [cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA)] in CD4 lymphocytes, whereas perforin was higher in the CD8 lymphocytes. The skin biopsy showed a perivascular mononuclear infiltrate composed of CD4 lymphocytes, expressing CD25, HLA-DR and CLA, with eosinophils. Intradermal skin tests and the LTT were positive to several ICM, including the culprit agent in four and three patients, respectively, with negative results in all 10 tolerant controls. We showed that a specific immunological mechanism was implicated in patients with non-immediate reactions to ICM. Moreover, the positive results in skin tests and lymphocyte proliferation tests indicated that an important cross-reactivity exists. PMID:18341616

Prevention and Management of Adverse Reactions Induced by Iodinated Contrast Media.

Iodinated radiocontrast media (IRCM) is widely used in current clinical practice. Although IRCM is generally safe, serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) may still occur. IRCM-induced ADRs may be subdivided into chemotoxic and hypersensitivity reactions. Several factors have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of ADRs, including previous contrast media reactions, history of asthma and allergic disease, etc. Contrast media with lower osmolality is generally recommended for at-risk patients to prevent ADRs. Current premedication prophylaxis in at-risk patients may reduce the risk of ADRs. However, there is still a lack of consensus on the prophylactic role of premedication. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is another component of IRCM-related ADRs. Hydration remains the mainstay of CIN prophylaxis in at-risk patients. Despite several preventive measures, ADRs may still occur. Treatment strategies for potential contrast reactions are also summarised in this article. This article summarises the pathophysiology, epidemiology and risk factors of ADRs with emphasis on prevention and treatment strategies. This will allow readers to understand the rationale behind appropriate patient preparation for diagnostic imaging involving IRCM.

Processing of visually presented clock times.

1980-11-01

The encoding and representation of visually presented clock times was investigated in three experiments utilizing a comparative judgment task. Experiment 1 explored the effects of comparing times presented in different formats (clock face, digit, or word), and Experiment 2 examined angular distance effects created by varying positions of the hands on clock faces. In Experiment 3, encoding and processing differences between clock faces and digitally presented times were directly measured. Same/different reactions to digitally presented times were faster than to times presented on a clock face, and this format effect was found to be a result of differences in processing that occurred after encoding. Angular separation also had a limited effect on processing. The findings are interpreted within the framework of theories that refer to the importance of representational codes. The applicability to the data of Bank's semantic-coding theory, Paivio's dual-coding theory, and the levels-of-processing view of memory are discussed.

To elucidate whether repeated exposures to iodinated contrast media increase the risk of adverse reaction. We retrospectively reviewed 1,861 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who visited authors' institution, a tertiary referral center, between 2004 and 2008. We analyzed cumulative probability of adverse reactions and risk factors. We categorized all symptoms into hypersensitivity reactions, physiologic reactions, and other reactions, according to the American College of Radiology guidelines, and evaluated each category as an event. We estimated the association between hazard for adverse reactions and the number of cumulative exposures to contrast media. We also evaluated subsequent contrast media injections and adverse reactions. There were 23,684 contrast media injections in 1,729 patients. One hundred and thirty-two patients were excluded because they were given no contrast media during the study period. Adverse reactions occurred in 196 (0.83%) patients. The cumulative incidence at 10(th), 20(th), and 30(th) examination was 7.9%, 15.2%, and 24.1%, respectively. Presence of renal impairment was found to be one of risk factors for adverse reactions. The estimated hazard of overall adverse reaction gradually decreased until around 10(th) exposure and rose with subsequent exposures. The estimated hazard of hypersensitivity showed V-shaped change with cumulative number of exposures. The estimated hazard of physiologic reaction had a tendency toward decreasing and that of other reaction had a tendency toward increasing. Second adverse reaction was more severe than the initial in only one among 130 patients receiving subsequent injections. Repeated exposures to iodinated contrast media increase the risk of adverse reaction.

Reaction kinetics and critical phenomena: iodination of acetone in isobutyric acid + water near the consolute point.

2010-01-14

The rate of iodination of acetone has been measured as a function of temperature in the binary solvent isobutyric acid (IBA) + water near the upper consolute point. The reaction mixture was prepared by the addition of acetone, iodine, and potassium iodide to IBA + water at its critical composition of 38.8 mass % IBA. The value of the critical temperature determined immediately after mixing was 25.43 degrees C. Aliquots were extracted from the mixture at regular intervals in order to follow the time course of the reaction. After dilution of the aliquot with water to quench the reaction, the concentration of triiodide ion was determined by the measurement of the optical density at a wavelength of 565 nm. These measurements showed that the kinetics were zeroth order. When at the end of 24 h the reaction had come to equilibrium, the critical temperature was determined again and found to be 24.83 degrees C. An Arrhenius plot of the temperature dependence of the observed rate constant, k(obs), was linear over the temperature range 27.00-38.00 degrees C, but between 25.43 and 27.00 degrees C, the values of k(obs) fell below the extrapolation of the Arrhenius line. This behavior is evidence in support of critical slowing down. Our experimental method and results are significant in three ways: (1) In contrast to in situ measurements of optical density, the determination of the optical density of diluted aliquots avoided any interference from critical opalescence. (2) The measured reaction rate exhibited critical slowing down. (3) The rate law was pseudo zeroth order both inside and outside the critical region, indicating that the reaction mechanism was unaffected by the presence of the critical point.

Rechargeable magnesium batteries have attracted considerable attention because of their potential high energy density and low cost. However, their development has been severely hindered because of the lack of appropriate cathode materials. Here we report a rechargeable magnesium/iodine battery, in which the soluble iodine reacts with Mg 2+ to form a soluble intermediate and then an insoluble final product magnesium iodide. The liquidâsolid two-phase reaction pathway circumvents solid-state Mg 2+ diffusion and ensures a large interfacial reaction area, leading to fast reaction kinetics and high reaction reversibility. As a result, the rechargeable magnesium/iodine battery shows a better rate capability (180moreÂ Â» mAh g â1 at 0.5 C and 140 mAh g â1 at 1 C) and a higher energy density (~400 Wh kg â1) than all other reported rechargeable magnesium batteries using intercalation cathodes. As a result, this study demonstrates that the liquidâsolid two-phase reaction mechanism is promising in addressing the kinetic limitation of rechargeable magnesium batteries.Â«Â less

Little attention has so far been paid to the nighttime atmospheric chemistry of iodine species. Current atmospheric models predict a buildup of HOI and I2 during the night that leads to a spike of IO at sunrise, which is not observed by measurements. In this work, electronic structure calculations are used to survey possible reactions that HOI and I2 could undergo at night in the lower troposphere, and hence reduce their nighttime accumulation. The new reaction NO3+ HOI â IO + HNO3 is proposed, with a rate coefficient calculated from statistical rate theory over the temperature range 260-300 K and at a pressure of 1000 hPa to be k(T) = 2.7 Ã 10-12 (300 K/T)2.66 cm3 molecule-1 s-1. This reaction is included in two atmospheric models, along with the known reaction between I2 and NO3, to explore a new nocturnal iodine radical activation mechanism. The results show that this iodine scheme leads to a considerable reduction of nighttime HOI and I2, which results in the enhancement of more than 25 % of nighttime ocean emissions of HOI + I2 and the removal of the anomalous spike of IO at sunrise. We suggest that active nighttime iodine can also have a considerable, so far unrecognized, impact on the reduction of the NO3 radical levels in the marine boundary layer (MBL) and hence upon the nocturnal oxidizing capacity of the marine atmosphere. The effect of this is exemplified by the indirect effect on dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation.

The advanced oxidation process is certainly used for the dye waste water treatment. In this continuation a new advanced oxidation via aqueous alkaline iodine was developed for the oxidation of acridine orange (AO) {3, 6 -bis (dimethylamino) acridine zinc chloride double salt}. Oxidation Kinetics of AO by alkaline solution of iodine was investigated spectrophotometrically at Î» max 491 nm. The reaction was monitored at various operational parameters like several concentrations of dye and iodine, pH, salt electrolyte and temperature. The initial steps of oxidation kinetics followed fractional order reaction with respect to the dye while depend upon the incremental amount of iodine to certain extent whereas maximum oxidation of AO was achieved at high pH. Decline in the reaction rate in the presence of salt electrolyte suggested the presence of oppositely charged species in the rate determining step. Kinetic data revealed that the de-colorization mechanism involves triodate (I 3 - ) species, instead of hypoidate (OI - ) and hypiodous acid (HOI), in alkaline medium during the photo-excitation of hydrolyzed AO. Alleviated concentration of alkali result in decreasing of rate of reaction, clearly indicate that the iodine species are active oxidizing species instead of OH radical. Activation parameters at elevated temperatures were determined which revealed that highly solvated state of dye complex existed into solution. Reaction mixture was subjected to UV/Visible and GC mass spectrum analysis that proves the secondary consecutive reaction was operative in rate determining step and finally dye complex end into smaller fragments.

cis,cis-Muconic acid is a platform biobased chemical that can be upgraded to drop-in commodity and novel monomers. Among the possible drop-in products, dimethyl terephthalate can be synthesized via esterification, isomerization, Diels-Alder cycloaddition, and dehydrogenation. The isomerization of cis,cis-dimethyl muconate ( ccDMM) to the trans,trans-form ( ttDMM) can be catalyzed by iodine; however, studies have yet to address (i) the mechanism and reaction barriers unique to DMM, and (ii) the influence of solvent, potential for catalyst recycle, and recovery of high-purity ttDMM. To address this gap, we apply a joint computational and experimental approach to investigate iodine-catalyzed isomerization of DMM. DensitymoreÂ Â» functional theory calculations identified unique regiochemical considerations due to the large number of halogen-diene coordination schemes. Both transition state theory and experiments estimate significant barrier reductions with photodissociated iodine. Solvent selection was critical for rapid kinetics, likely due to solvent complexation with iodine. Under select conditions, ttDMM yields of 95% were achieved in <1 h with methanol, followed by high purity recovery (>98%) with crystallization. Lastly, post-reaction iodine can be recovered and recycled with minimal loss of activity. Altogether, these findings provide new insight into the mechanism and conditions necessary for DMM isomerization with iodine to advance the state-of-the-art for biobased chemicals.Â«Â less

An approximately 24-h biological timekeeping mechanism called the circadian clock is present in virtually all light-sensitive organisms from cyanobacteria to humans. The clock system regulates our sleep-wake cycle, feeding-fasting, hormonal secretion, body temperature, and many other physiological functions. Signals from the master circadian oscillator entrain peripheral clocks using a variety of neural and hormonal signals. Even centrally controlled internal temperature fluctuations can entrain the peripheral circadian clocks. But, unlike other chemical reactions, the output of the clock system remains nearly constant with fluctuations in ambient temperature, a phenomenon known as temperature compensation. In this brief review, we focus on recent advances in our understanding of the posttranslational modifications, especially a phosphoswitch mechanism controlling the stability of PER2 and its implications for the regulation of temperature compensation.

Observing iodine monoxide from satellite

NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)

Schoenhardt, Anja; Richter, Andreas; Begoin, Mathias; Wittrock, Folkard; Burrows, John P.

Iodine and iodine monoxide (IO) belong to the group of reactive halogen species, and they may impact on atmospheric chemical composition and the radiation budget. Vice versa, sur-rounding conditions may influence the emissions and pathways of iodine compounds. Although atmospheric amounts of iodine are typically fairly small, the impact may still be substantial. Iodine radicals are photolytically released from precursors and may then cause catalytic ozone depletion. In this reaction with ozone, IO is produced, a molecule which plays a central role in the iodine cycling. Via self reactions of IO, higher iodine oxides form and initiate the formation of new particles, which may change the atmospheric radiation balance. Apart from that, many living species, including human beings, vertebrates in general, but also micro-and macroalgae species, e.g., depend on the supply with iodine. Consequently, it is necessary to understand the cycling of iodine through the different components of the Earth system. Although increas-ing research effort in the form of field, laboratory and modeling studies has strongly improved our knowledge and understanding of iodine abundances and impact, still many open questions remain. The relevance of iodine on a global scale is not well known yet; sources are not well quantified and release processes are not fully understood. Since recently, IO may be observed from space by the SCIAMACHY instrument on the EN-VISAT satellite, which is in a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit. Nadir observations from SCIAMACHY have been analysed for the IO absorption signature in the visible wavelength range for several mission years. IO amounts are typically close to the limit of detectability of SCIAMACHY. Detecting such small quantities, careful attention needs to be paid to system-atic errors, spectral correlations and resulting retrieval artefacts. Subsequently, appropriate temporal averaging is utilised to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting

Hypervalent iodine compounds are important and widely used oxidants in organic chemistry. In 2005, Ochiai reported the PhI-catalyzed Î±-acetoxylation reaction of acetophenone by the oxidation of PhI with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA) in acetic acid. However, until now, the most critical reactive Î±-Î»(3)-iodine alkyl acetophenone intermediate (3) had not been isolated or directly detected. Electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was used to intercept and characterize the transient reactive Î±-Î»(3)-iodine alkyl acetophenone intermediate in the reaction solution. The trivalent iodine species was detected when PhI and m-CPBA in acetic acid were mixed, which indicated the facile oxidation of a catalytic amount of PhI(I) to the iodine(III) species by m-CPBA. Most importantly, 3Â·H(+) was observed at m/z 383 from the reaction solution and this ion gave the protonated Î±-acetoxylation product 4Â·H(+) at m/z 179 in MS/MS by an intramolecular reductive elimination of PhI. These ESI-MS/MS studies showed the existence of the reactive Î±-Î»(3)-iodine alkyl acetophenone intermediate 3 in the catalytic cycle. Moreover, the gas-phase reactivity of 3Â·H(+) was consistent with the proposed solution-phase reactivity of the Î±-Î»(3)-iodine alkyl acetophenone intermediate 3, thus confirming the reaction mechanism proposed by Ochiai.

To use Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to evaluate stakeholders' intention to adopt iodine biofortified foods as an alternative means to improve children's iodine status and overall school performance. A survey was administered with 360 parents of primary school children and 40 school heads. Protection motivation is measured through matching the cognitive processes they use to evaluate iodine deficiency (threat appraisal), as well as iodine biofortified foods to reduce the threat (coping appraisal). Data were analyzed through Robust (Cluster) regression analysis. Gender had a significant effect on coping appraisal for school heads, while age, education, occupation, income, household size and knowledge were significant predictors of threat, coping appraisal and/or protection motivation intention among parents. Nevertheless, in the overall protection motivation model, only two coping factors, namely self-efficacy (parents) and response cost (school heads), influenced the intention to adopt iodine biofortified foods. School feeding programs incorporating iodine biofortification should strive to increase not only consumer knowledge about iodine but also its association to apparent deficiency disorders, boost self-efficacy and ensure that the costs incurred are not perceived as barriers of adoption. The insignificant threat appraisal effects lend support for targeting future communication on biofortification upon the strategies itself, rather than on the targeted micronutrient deficiency. PMT, and coping factors in particular, seem to be valuable in assessing intentions to adopt healthy foods. Nevertheless, research is needed to improve the impacts of threat appraisal factors.

Oxidative treatment of iodide-containing waters can form iodinated disinfection by-products (I-DBPs) that are more toxic than the regulated DBPs. To better understand the fate of iodine during water treatment with ferrate(VI), kinetics, products, and stoichiometries for the reactions of ferrate(VI) with iodide (I - ) and hypoiodous acid (HOI) were determined. Ferrate(VI) showed considerable reactivities to both I - and HOI with higher reactivities at lower pH. Interestingly, the reaction of ferrate(VI) with HOI ( k = 6.0Ã10 3 M -1 s -1 at pH 9) was much faster than with I - ( k = 5.6Ã10 M -1 s -1 at pH 9). The main reaction pathway during treatment of I - -containing waters was the oxidation of I - to HOI and its further oxidation to IO 3 - by ferrate(VI). However, for pH > 9, the HOI disproportionation catalyzed by ferrate(VI) became an additional transformation pathway forming I - and IO 3 - . The reduction of HOI by hydrogen peroxide ( k = 2.0Ã10 8 M -1 s -1 for the reaction, HOI + HO 2 - â I - + O 2 + 2H + ), the latter being produced from ferrate(VI) decomposition, also contributes to the I - regeneration in the pH range 9 - 11. A kinetic model was developed that could well simulate the fate of iodine in the ferrate(VI)-I - system. Overall, due to a rapid oxidation of I - to IO 3 - with short-lifetimes of HOI, ferrate(VI) oxidation appears to be a promising option for I-DBP mitigation during treatment of I - -containing waters.

Clock is not a component of Z-bands.

The process of Z-band assembly begins with the formation of small Z-bodies composed of a complex of proteins rich in alpha-actinin. As additional proteins are added to nascent myofibrils, Z-bodies are transformed into continuous bands that form coherent discs of interacting proteins at the boundaries of sarcomeres. The steps controlling the transition of Z-bodies to Z-bands are not known. The report that a circadian protein, Clock, was localized in the Z-bands of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes raised the question whether this transcription factor could be involved in Z-band assembly. We found that the anti-Clock antibody used in the reported study also stained the Z-bands and Z-bodies of mouse and avian cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. YFP constructs of Clock that were assembled, however, did not localize to the Z-bands of muscle cells. Controls of Clock's activity showed that cotransfection of muscle cells with pYFP-Clock and pCeFP-BMAL1 led to the expected nuclear localization of YFP-Clock with its binding partner CeFP-BMAL1. Neither CeFP-BMAL1 nor antibodies directed against BMAL1 localized to Z-bands. A bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (VC-BMAL1 and VN-Clock) confirmed the absence of Clock and BMAL1 from Z-bands, and their nuclear colocalization. A second anti-Clock antibody stained nuclei, but not Z-bands, of cells cotransfected with Clock and BMAL1 plasmids. Western blots of reactions of muscle extracts and purified alpha-actinins with the two anti-Clock antibodies showed that the original antibody cross-reacted with alpha-actinin and the second did not. These results cannot confirm Clock as an active component of Z-bands. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Copyright Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Breathing spiral waves are observed in the oscillatory chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid reaction-diffusion system. The breathing develops within established patterns of multiple spiral waves after the concentration of polyvinyl alcohol in the feeding chamber of a continuously fed, unstirred reactor is increased. The breathing period is determined by the period of bulk oscillations in the feeding chamber. Similar behavior is obtained in the Lengyel-Epstein model of this system, where small amplitude parametric forcing of spiral waves near the spiral wave frequency leads to the formation of breathing spiral waves in which the period of breathing is equal to the period of forcing.

2016-08-03

The adsorption process of iodine, a major volatile radionuclide in the off-gas streams of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, on hydrogen-reduced silver-exchanged mordenite (Ag 0Z) was studied at the micro-scale. The gas-solid mass transfer and reaction involved in the adsorption process were investigated and evaluated with appropriate models. Optimal conditions for reducing the silver-exchanged mordenite (AgZ) in a hydrogen stream were determined. Kinetic and equilibrium data of iodine adsorption on Ag 0Z were obtained by performing single-layer adsorption experiments with experimental systems of high precision at 373â473 K over various iodine concentrations. Results indicate approximately 91% to 97% of the iodinemoreÂ Â» adsorption was through the silver-iodine reaction. The effect of temperature on the iodine loading capacity of Ag 0Z was discussed. In conclusion, the Shrinking Core model describes the data well, and the primary rate controlling mechanisms were macro-pore diffusion and silver-iodine reaction.

Wearden, J H; Williams, Emily A; Jones, Luke A

2017-03-01

Four experiments investigated the effect of pre-stimulus events on judgements of the subjective duration of tones that they preceded. Experiments 1 to 4 used click trains, flickering squares, expanding circles, and white noise as pre-stimulus events and showed that (a) periodic clicks appeared to "speed up" the pacemaker of an internal clock but that the effect wore off over a click-free delay, (b) aperiodic click trains, and visual stimuli in the form of flickering squares and expanding circles, also produced similar increases in estimated tone duration, as did white noise, although its effect was weaker. A fifth experiment examined the effects of periodic flicker on reaction time and showed that, as with periodic clicks in a previous experiment, reaction times were shorter when preceded by flicker than without.

The purpose of the present work is to evaluate the efficacy of an approach that combines clinical history, skin tests results, and premedication, in preventing recurrent hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM). Skin Prick tests, Intradermal tests, and Patch tests were performed in 36 patients with a previous reaction to ICM. All patients underwent a second contrast enhanced radiological procedure with an alternative ICM selected on the basis of the proposed approach. After alternative ICM re-injection, only one patient presented a mild NIR. The proposed algorithm, validated in clinical settings where repeated radiological exams are needed, offers a safe and practical approach for protecting patients from recurrent hypersensitivity reactions to ICM.

Chemical clocks are often used as exciting classroom experiments, where an induction time is followed by rapidly changing colours that expose oscillating concentration patterns. This type of reaction belongs to a class of nonlinear chemical kinetics also linked to chaos, wave propagation and Turing patterns. Despite its vastness in occurrence and applicability, the clock reaction is only well understood for liquid-state processes. Here we report a chemical clock reaction, in which a solidifying entity, metal-organic framework UiO-66, displays oscillations in crystal dimension and number, as shown by X-ray scattering. In rationalizing this result, we introduce a computational approach, the metal-organic molecular orbital methodology, to pinpoint interaction between the tectonic building blocks that construct the metal-organic framework material. In this way, we show that hydrochloric acid plays the role of autocatalyst, bridging separate processes of condensation and crystallization.

Medical effects of iodine disinfection products in spacecraft water

Various iodination products (IDPs), including iodinated and iodine-induced new compounds, will be present in the iodine-disinfected water that is expected to be used by crews on the NASA Space Station and on long duration missions. The metabolic intermediaries created by such a process may be more important to crew health than the parent IDPs, and reclamation and recycling may be expected to produce additional products. These medical effects may be expressed in crews as hypersensitivity, allergic, acute toxic, and chronic toxic reactions, as well as modifications of immune system response.

A new finding opens up speculation that the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks in Synechococcus elongatus is composed of multiple oscillator systems (Kitayama and colleagues, this issue, pp. 1513-1521), as has been described in many eukaryotic clock model systems. However, an alternative intepretation is that the pacemaker mechanism-as previously suggested-lies primarily in the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the clock protein KaiC.

Regulation of circadian clock transcriptional output by CLOCK:BMAL1

PubMed Central

Trott, Alexandra J.

2018-01-01

The mammalian circadian clock relies on the transcription factor CLOCK:BMAL1 to coordinate the rhythmic expression of 15% of the transcriptome and control the daily regulation of biological functions. The recent characterization of CLOCK:BMAL1 cistrome revealed that although CLOCK:BMAL1 binds synchronously to all of its target genes, its transcriptional output is highly heterogeneous. By performing a meta-analysis of several independent genome-wide datasets, we found that the binding of other transcription factors at CLOCK:BMAL1 enhancers likely contribute to the heterogeneity of CLOCK:BMAL1 transcriptional output. While CLOCK:BMAL1 rhythmic DNA binding promotes rhythmic nucleosome removal, it is not sufficient to generate transcriptionally active enhancers as assessed by H3K27ac signal, RNA Polymerase II recruitment, and eRNA expression. Instead, the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 enhancers appears to rely on the activity of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors, and not tissue-specific transcription factors, recruited at nearby binding sites. The contribution of other transcription factors is exemplified by how fasting, which effects several transcription factors but not CLOCK:BMAL1, either decreases or increases the amplitude of many rhythmically expressed CLOCK:BMAL1 target genes. Together, our analysis suggests that CLOCK:BMAL1 promotes a transcriptionally permissive chromatin landscape that primes its target genes for transcription activation rather than directly activating transcription, and provides a new framework to explain how environmental or pathological conditions can reprogram the rhythmic expression of clock-controlled genes.

Background: It has been suggested that incidence of some cancers, especially examples in the breast and stomach may be influenced by the iodine intake. However, only few studies are available at present. Therefore, we have conducted the present assessment of iodine status in Iranian patients diagnosed with a malignancy. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 85 patients diagnosed with different types of cancer at Shahid Sadoughi Hospital, Yazd, Iran. The method used was based on the SandellâKolthoff reaction. Results: The median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 17.4 Î¼g/L, with â¤20 Î¼g/L indicative of severe iodine deficiency. According to the WHO/IC C IDD/UNIC EF classification, 88.1%, 7.1% and 2.4% of patients had a UIC <20 (severe), 20â49 (mild), and 50â99 Î¼g/L (moderate), respectively. There was no statistically significant differences in UIC between men and women. Conclusion: The UIC values indicate that Iranian cancer patients were seriously iodine deficient according to WHO/UNIC EF/IC C IDD, and that this is a suitable index to assess iodine status in Iranians. Daily consumption of salt fortified with iodine or other approaches to increase intake might be effective strategies for prevention or reduction of malignancies. PMID:28441792

Gum arabic, a plant polysaccharide was oxidized with periodate to produce aldehyde groups by the cleavage of diols present in the sugar units. The oxidized gum was then iodinated with iodine monochloride (ICl) and the interaction between electrophilic iodine, I + and reactive carbonyl groups of the modified gum was studied.Results of titrimetric estimation performed to determine the extent of oxidation and aldehyde content in the oxidized gum showed that degree of oxidation ranged between 19.68-50.19% which was observed to increase with periodate concentration; the corresponding aldehyde content was calculated to be 5.15-40.42%. Different strengths of ICl were used to iodinate the oxidized gum and the iodine content of the complexes varied from 6.11-11.72% as determined by iodometric titration. Structure elucidation of the iodine complexes conclusively established the attachment of ICl molecules to CHO groups. A reaction scheme has been proposed suggesting an electrophilic addition of the reagent to the aldehyde groups, a mechanism that was also supported by iodide ion release studies.

Immune system biology and most physiologic functions are tightly linked to circadian rhythms. Time of day-dependent variations in many biologic parameters also play a fundamental role in the disease process. We previously showed that the genes encoding the peripheral molecular clock were modulated in a sex-dependent manner in Q fever. Here, we examined severe trauma patients at admission to the intensive care unit. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, the whole-blood expression of the molecular clock components ARNTL, CLOCK, and PER2 was assessed in male and female trauma patients. Healthy volunteers of both sexes were used as controls. We observed a significant overexpression of both ARNTL and CLOCK in male trauma patients. We report, for the first time, the sex-related modulation of the molecular clock genes in the blood following severe trauma. These results emphasize the role of circadian rhythms in the immune response in trauma patients. Epidemiologic study, level IV.

Iodine deficiency is a global public health problem which is particularly noticeable in pregnant or breastfeeding women and their children. Even mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy can lead to damage to the developing brain and thus affecting the fetus intelligence, his cognitive and neurological function, embryogenesis and growth. In the period 2010-2015 was determined by spectrophotometry at the Institute of Endocrinology the basal urinary iodine in 532 pregnant women at the age of 32 Â± 5 (18-44) years, which came from Prague, Hradec Kralove and Mlada Boleslav. It was located 349 women in the first trimester, 112 in the second trimester, and 71 women in the third trimester. In the monitoring of pregnant women in the first trimester 218 basal urine samples of women were determined by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP MS) in The National Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Women came from the 6 areas in the Czech Republic. Development of urinary iodine in the general population in the period 1994-2015 was observed in patients who underwent Institute of Endocrinology and from population studies conducted in 7 regions of the Czech Republic. It performed 52â¯648 spectrophotometric analysis of urinary iodine in the general population. Urinary iodine was determined by alkali melting of urine samples, followed by spectrophotometric determination of iodine in the form of iodide using the Sandell-Kolthoff reaction in the Institute of Endocrinology or determination was performed by ICP-MS in the laboratory of NIPH. On average, only 21.8 % of pregnant women had urinary iodine values determined by spectrophotometry higher than 150 Î¼g/L. The results of iodine nutrition of pregnant women in the first trimester analyzed using ICP-MS are better, but even so, only 50.5 % of pregnant women have urinary iodine higher than 150 Î¼g/L. The results of iodine nutrition of pregnant women are alarming, on average, only 30 % of the total of 750 examined women have

Iodine Deficiency and Iodine Prophylaxis in Pregnancy.

Physiological changes in pregnancy result in increased iodine demand, which may not be met in areas of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency or borderline sufficiency. As a pregnant woman is the only source of thyroid hormones for her child during early gestation, iodine deficiencyinduced hypothyroxinemia may have deleterious effects on fetal development. To present the current approach to iodine deficiency and its prophylaxis during pregnancy. A review of the current literature including patents on iodine deficiency in pregnancy has been performed. Negative influence of severe iodine deficiency on fetal development has been proved, and evidence on a deleterious impact of milder forms of iodine deficiency on cognition of the offspring is rapidly growing. Although the WHO has addressed the issues of monitoring iodine status during pregnancy, prophylactic measures and assessment of their effectiveness, there are some controversies, regarding for example the best methods for control of iodine status. New patents in urinary iodine measurement methods may make iodine nutrition monitoring easier. The main method of iodine prophylaxis, in pregnancy also, is universal salt iodization. However, particularly if there is not sufficient coverage of the households with iodized salt, additional measures, such as oral supplementation with potassium iodide tablets, are necessary in pregnant women to provide adequate iodine nutrition. Iodine supplementation improves maternal thyroid function indices; particularly, it prevents goiter formation. Stronger evidence on beneficial effects of iodine supplementation of mild-to-moderate iodine deficient pregnant women on cognitive function of their children is still needed. It may be provided by randomized controlled trials and international initiatives. Changes in the iodine prophylaxis system should be monitored, both to prevent decreased or excessive iodine intake.

Patients with breakthrough reactions to iodinated contrast media have low incidence of positive skin tests.

The term "breakthrough reactions" designates repeated hypersensitivity reactions to iodinated contrast media (ICM) despite premedication with glucocorticoids and antihistamines. We aimed to retrospectively evaluate the rate of positive skin test (STs) in our cohort of patients with previous breakthrough reactions to different ICMs. A series of 35 patients, who experienced at least one breakthrough reaction to ICM and who underwent STs within 6 months from the reaction were studied, and results were compared to a control group of patients with a first hypersensitivity reaction occurred without premedication. Skin prick tests (SPT), intradermal tests (IDT) and patch tests (PT) at different dilutions, with a set of three to four ICM were performed. Of the 35 patients with prior breakthrough reactions, 57% had an immediate reaction (IR) and 43% had a non-immediate reaction (NIR). Patients who experienced the first hypersensitivity IR or NIR, later had one or more breakthrough IR or NIR, respectively. Overall, 29% (10/35) of patients with prior breakthrough reactions resulted positive to STs compared to 57% (16/28) of the control group (p < 0.05). No significant difference in allergy history, age, sex, other clinical / demographic features nor chronic use of ACE-inhibitor, beta-blockers or NSAIDs was observed. This preliminary finding suggests that patients with prior breakthrough reactions have significantly lower immunologically proven ICM reactions (positive STs) if compared to non-breakthrough patients. According to that, a considerable number of breakthrough reactions seems to be non-allergic hypersensitivity reactions or reactions which could be mostly prevented by a proper, well-timed skin testing. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these results, with a more careful analysis of patients' risk factors, a laboratory assessment that includes an in vitro allergy diagnostics, and hopefully a drug provocation test for selected cases.

Chalcogenide aerogels as sorbents for radioactive iodine

DOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)

Subrahmanyam, Kota S.; Sarma, Debajit; Malliakas, Christos

Iodine (129I) is one of the radionuclides released in nuclear fuel reprocessing and poses risk to public safety due to its involvement in human metabolic processes. In order to prevent the leaching of hazardous radioactive iodine into the environment, its effective capture and sequestration is pivotal. In the context of finding a suitable matrix for capturing radioactive iodine the chalcogels, NiMoS4, CoMoS4, Sb4Sn4S12, Zn2Sn2S6, and CoSx (x = 4-5) were explored as iodine sorbents. All the chalcogels showed high uptake, reaching up to 225 mass% (2.25 g/g) of the final mass owing to strong chemical and physical iodine-chalcogen interactions. AnalysismoreÂ Â» of the iodine-loaded specimens revealed that the iodine chemically reacted with Sb4Sn4S12, Zn2Sn2S6, and CoSx to form metal complexes SbI3, SnI4, and, KI respectively. The NiMoS4 and CoMoS4 chalcogels did not appear to undergo a chemical reaction with iodine since iodide complexes were not observed with these samples. Once heated, the iodine-loaded chalcogels released iodine in the temperature range of 75 Â°C to 220 Â°C, depending on the nature of iodine speciation. In the case of Sb4Sn4S12 and Zn2Sn2S6 iodine release was observed around 150 Â°C in the form of SnI4 and SbI3, respectively. The NiMoS4, CoMoS4, and CoSx released iodine at ~75 Â°C, which is consistent with physisorbed iodine. Preliminary investigations on consolidation of iodine-loaded Zn2Sn2S6 with Sb2S3 as a glass forming additive showed the content of iodine in consolidated glass ingots at around 25 mass%.Â«Â less

Generic temperature compensation of biological clocks by autonomous regulation of catalyst concentration.

PubMed

Hatakeyama, Tetsuhiro S; Kaneko, Kunihiko

2012-05-22

Circadian clocks--ubiquitous in life forms ranging from bacteria to multicellular organisms--often exhibit intrinsic temperature compensation; the period of circadian oscillators is maintained constant over a range of physiological temperatures, despite the expected Arrhenius form for the reaction coefficient. Observations have shown that the amplitude of the oscillation depends on the temperature but the period does not; this suggests that although not every reaction step is temperature independent, the total system comprising several reactions still exhibits compensation. Here we present a general mechanism for such temperature compensation. Consider a system with multiple activation energy barriers for reactions, with a common enzyme shared across several reaction steps. The steps with the highest activation energy rate-limit the cycle when the temperature is not high. If the total abundance of the enzyme is limited, the amount of free enzyme available to catalyze a specific reaction decreases as more substrates bind to the common enzyme. We show that this change in free enzyme abundance compensates for the Arrhenius-type temperature dependence of the reaction coefficient. Taking the example of circadian clocks with cyanobacterial proteins KaiABC, consisting of several phosphorylation sites, we show that this temperature compensation mechanism is indeed valid. Specifically, if the activation energy for phosphorylation is larger than that for dephosphorylation, competition for KaiA shared among the phosphorylation reactions leads to temperature compensation. Moreover, taking a simpler model, we demonstrate the generality of the proposed compensation mechanism, suggesting relevance not only to circadian clocks but to other (bio)chemical oscillators as well.

We present femtosecond time-resolved pump-probe experiments on iodine molecules enclosed into well-defined cages and channels of different crystalline SiO2 modifications of zeolites. The new experimental results obtained from iodine in TON (Silica-ZSM-22), FER (Silica-Ferrierit), and MFI (Silicalit-1) porosils are compared with data published earlier on the iodine/DDR (Decadodecasil 3R) porosil system [Flachenecker et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 5, 865 (2003)]. A summary of all findings is given. The processes analyzed by means of the ultrafast spectroscopy are the vibrational relaxation as well as the dissociation and recombination reactions, which are caused by the interaction of the photo-excited iodine molecules with the cavity walls of the porosils. A clear dependence of the observed dynamics on the geometry of the surrounding lattice structure can be seen. These measurements are supported by temperature-dependent experiments. Making use of a theoretical model which is based on the classical Langevin equation, an analysis of the geometry-reaction relation is performed. The Brownian dynamics simulations show that
