The importance and approaches (or structures) of different phased array and surface emitting laser diodes are reviewed. The following are described: (1) a large optical cavity channel substrate planar laser array with layer thickness chirping; (2) a vertical cavity surface emitter with distributed feedback (DFB) optical cavity and a transverse junction buried heterostructure; (3) a microcavity distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) surface emitter; and (4) two surface emitting laser structures which utilized lateral current injection schemes to overcome the problems occurring in the vertical injection scheme.\n\nInvestigation of High Linearity DFB Lasers for Analog Communications\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1998-02-01\n\npersonal communication systems (PCS) service and phased array radar.

[bounded distributed-feedback lasers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nElachi, C.; Evans, G.; Yeh, C.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nBounded distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers are studied in detail. Threshold gain and field distribution for a number of configurations are derived and analyzed. More specifically, the thin-film guide, fiber, diffusion guide, and hollow channel with inhomogeneous-cladding DFB lasers are considered. Optimum points exist and must be used in DFB laser design. Different-modes feedback and the effects of the transverse boundaries are included. A number of applications are also discussed.\n\nStudy on the characteristic and application of DFB semiconductor lasers under optical injection for microwave photonics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPu, Tao; Wang, Wei wei\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn order to apply optical injection effect in Microwave Photonics system, The red-shift effect of the cavity mode of the DFB semiconductor laser under single-frequency optical injection is studied experimentally, and the red-shift curve of the cavity mode is measured. The wavelength-selective amplification property of the DFB semiconductor laser under multi-frequency optical injection is also investigated, and the gain curves for the injected signals in different injection ratios are measured in the experiment. A novel and simple structure to implement a single-passband MPF with wideband tunability based on the wavelength-selective amplification of a DFB semiconductor laser under optical injection is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. MPFs with center frequency tuned from 13 to 41 GHz are realized in the experiment. A wideband and frequency-tunable optoelectronic oscillator based on a directly modulated distributed feedback (DFB) semiconductor laser under optical injection is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. By optical injection, the relaxation oscillation frequency of the DFB laser is enhanced and its high modulation efficiency makes the loop oscillate without the necessary of the electrical filter. An experiment is performed; microwave signals with frequency tuned from 5.98 to 15.22 GHz are generated by adjusting the injection ratio and frequency detuning between the master and slave lasers.\n\nAnalysis of all-optical temporal integrator employing phased-shifted DFB-SOA.\n\nPubMed\n\nJia, Xin-Hong; Ji, Xiao-Ling; Xu, Cong; Wang, Zi-Nan; Zhang, Wei-Li\n\n2014-11-17\n\nAll-optical temporal integrator using phase-shifted distributed-feedback semiconductor optical amplifier (DFB-SOA) is investigated. The influences of system parameters on its energy transmittance and integration error are explored in detail. The numerical analysis shows that, enhanced energy transmittance and integration time window can be simultaneously achieved by increased injected current in the vicinity of lasing threshold. We find that the range of input pulse-width with lower integration error is highly sensitive to the injected optical power, due to gain saturation and induced detuning deviation mechanism. The initial frequency detuning should also be carefully chosen to suppress the integration deviation with ideal waveform output.\n\nFiber Bragg Grating vibration sensor with DFB laser diode\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSiska, Petr; Brozovic, Martin; Cubik, Jakub; Kepak, Stanislav; Vitasek, Jan; Koudelka, Petr; Latal, Jan; Vasinek, Vladimir\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors are nowadays used in many applications. Thanks to its quite big sensitivity to a surrounding environment, they can be used for sensing of temperature, strain, vibration or pressure. A fiber Bragg grating vibration sensor, which is interrogated by a distributed feedback laser diode (DFB) is demonstrated in this article. The system is based on the intensity modulation of the narrow spectral bandwidth of the DFB laser, when the reflection spectrum of the FBG sensor is shifted due to the strain that is applied on it in form of vibrations caused by acoustic wave pressure from loud speaker. The sensor's response in frequency domain and strain is measured; also the factor of sensor pre-strain impact on its sensitivity is discussed.\n\nDFB laser array driver circuit controlled by adjustable signal\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDu, Weikang; Du, Yinchao; Guo, Yu; Li, Wei; Wang, Hao\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn order to achieve the intelligent controlling of DFB laser array, this paper presents the design of an intelligence and high precision numerical controlling electric circuit. The system takes MCU and FPGA as the main control chip, with compact, high-efficiency, no impact, switching protection characteristics. The output of the DFB laser array can be determined by an external adjustable signal. The system transforms the analog control model into a digital control model, which improves the performance of the driver. The system can monitor the temperature and current of DFB laser array in real time. The output precision of the current can reach Â± 0.1mA, which ensures the stable and reliable operation of the DFB laser array. Such a driver can benefit the flexible usage of the DFB laser array.\n\nShort cavity DFB fiber laser based vector hydrophone for low frequency signal detection\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xiaolei; Zhang, Faxiang; Jiang, Shaodong; Min, Li; Li, Ming; Peng, Gangding; Ni, Jiasheng; Wang, Chang\n\n2017-12-01\n\nA short cavity distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser is used for low frequency acoustic signal detection. Three DFB fiber lasers with different central wavelengths are chained together to make three-element vector hydrophone with proper sensitivity enhancement design, which has extensive and significant applications to underwater acoustic monitoring for the national defense, oil, gas exploration, and so on. By wavelength-phase demodulation, the lasing wavelength changes under different frequency signals can be interpreted, and the sensitivity is tested about 33 dB re pm/g. The frequency response range is rather flat from 5 Hz to 300 Hz.\n\nReview on recent Developments on Fabrication Techniques of Distributed Feedback (DFB) Based Organic Lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAzrina Talik, Noor; Boon Kar, Yap; Noradhlia Mohamad Tukijan, Siti; Wong, Chuan Ling\n\n2017-10-01\n\nTo date, the state of art organic semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) lasers gains tremendous interest in the organic device industry. This paper presents a short reviews on the fabrication techniques of DFB based laser by focusing on the fabrication method of DFB corrugated structure and the deposition of organic gain on the nano-patterned DFB resonator. The fabrication techniques such as Laser Direct Writing (LDW), ultrafast photo excitation dynamics, Laser Interference Lithography (LIL) and Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) for DFB patterning are presented. In addition to that, the method for gain medium deposition method is also discussed. The technical procedures of the stated fabrication techniques are summarized together with their benefits and comparisons to the traditional fabrication techniques.\n\nFrequency Stabilization of DFB Laser Diodes at 1572 nm for Spaceborne Lidar Measurements of CO2\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nNumata, Kenji; Chen, Jeffrey R.; Wu, Stewart T.; Abshire, James B.; Krainak, Michael A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nWe report a fiber-based, pulsed laser seeder system that rapidly switches among 6 wavelengths across atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption line near 1572.3 nm for measurements of global CO2 mixing ratios to 1-ppmv precision. One master DFB laser diode has been frequency-locked to the CO2 line center using a frequency modulation technique, suppressing its peak-to-peak frequency drifts to 0.3 MHz at 0.8 sec averaging time over 72 hours. Four online DFB laser diodes have been offset-locked to the master laser using phase locked loops, with virtually the same sub-MHz absolute accuracy. The 6 lasers were externally modulated and then combined to produce the measurement pulse train.\n\nDual-wavelength DFB quantum cascade lasers: sources for multi-species trace gas spectroscopy\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKapsalidis, Filippos; Shahmohammadi, Mehran; SÃ¼ess, Martin J.; Wolf, Johanna M.; Gini, Emilio; Beck, Mattias; Hundt, Morten; Tuzson, BÃ©la; Emmenegger, Lukas; Faist, JÃ©rÃ´me\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe report on the design, fabrication, and performance of dual-wavelength distributed-feedback (DFB) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) emitting at several wavelengths in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum. In this work, two new designs are presented: for the first one, called \"Neighbour\" DFB, two single-mode DFB QCLs are fabricated next to each other, with minimal lateral distance, to allow efficient beam-coupling into multi-pass gas cells. In addition, the minimal distance allows either laser to be used as an integrated heater for the other, allowing to extend the tuning range of its neighbour without any electrical cross-talk. For the second design, the Vernier effect was used to realize a switchable DFB laser, with two target wavelengths which are distant by about 300 cm^{-1}. These devices are promising laser sources for Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy applications targeting simultaneous detection of multiple gasses, with distant spectral features, in compact and mobile setups.\n\nDifferential carrier phase recovery for QPSK optical coherent systems with integrated tunable lasers.\n\nPubMed\n\nFatadin, Irshaad; Ives, David; Savory, Seb J\n\n2013-04-22\n\nThe performance of a differential carrier phase recovery algorithm is investigated for the quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation format with an integrated tunable laser. The phase noise of the widely-tunable laser measured using a digital coherent receiver is shown to exhibit significant drift compared to a standard distributed feedback (DFB) laser due to enhanced low frequency noise component. The simulated performance of the differential algorithm is compared to the Viterbi-Viterbi phase estimation at different baud rates using the measured phase noise for the integrated tunable laser.\n\n42.8 Gb/s ASK homodyne receiver using standard DFB lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBecker, D.; Mohr, D.; Datta, S.; Wree, C.; Bhandare, S.; Joshi, A.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nOptical synchronous coherent detection is attracting greater attention within the defense and security community because it allows linear recovery both of the amplitude and phase of optical signals. Fiber-based transmission impairments such as chromatic dispersion and polarization mode dispersion can be compensated in the electrical domain. Additionally, synchronous detection offers the potential of improved receiver sensitivity and extended reach versus direct or interferometric detection schemes. 28 Gbaud/112 Gb/s and 42.8 Gbaud transmissions are now being considered in fiber networks worldwide. Due to the lack of broadband high frequency components centered at IF values of 56 GHz and 86 GHz, respectively, the coherent heterodyne approach is not viable for these baud rates. The homodyne approach remains one of the choices available to fully exploit the advantages of synchronous coherent detection at these transmission data rates. In order to implement the homodyne receiver, optical phase locking between the signal and local oscillator laser (LO) is required. Digital approaches for this task rely upon very complex, fast, and high power-consumption chips. A homodyne receiver using an analog approach for phase locking would allow for increased system simplicity at a lower cost. Use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) DFB lasers embedded within the receiver would also increase system feasibility for defense applications. We demonstrate synchronous demodulation of a 42.8 Gbaud signal using an analog optical phase-locked loop. The homodyne system was optimized to use COTS DFB lasers having an aggregate linewidth of ~2 MHz. We also analyze the impact of uncompensated phase noise on receiver performance.\n\nNear-field analysis of metallic DFB lasers at telecom wavelengths.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreusard, L; Costantini, D; Bousseksou, A; Decobert, J; Lelarge, F; Duan, G-H; De Wilde, Y; Colombelli, R\n\n2013-05-06\n\nWe image in near-field the transverse modes of semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) lasers operating at Î» â 1.3 Î¼m and employing metallic gratings. The active region is based on tensile-strained InGaAlAs quantum wells emitting transverse magnetic polarized light and is coupled via an extremely thin cladding to a nano-patterned gold grating integrated on the device surface. Single mode emission is achieved, which tunes with the grating periodicity. The near-field measurements confirm laser operation on the fundamental transverse mode. Furthermore--together with a laser threshold reduction observed in the DFB lasers--it suggests that the patterning of the top metal contact can be a strategy to reduce the high plasmonic losses in this kind of systems.\n\nFemtosecond-pulse inscription of fiber Bragg gratings with single or multiple phase-shifts in the structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWolf, Alexey; Dostovalov, Alexandr; Skvortsov, Mikhail; Raspopin, Kirill; Parygin, Alexandr; Babin, Sergey\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this work, long high-quality fiber Bragg gratings with phase shifts in the structure are inscribed directly in the optical fiber by point-by-point technique using femtosecond laser pulses. Phase shifts are introduced during the inscription process with a piezoelectric actuator, which rapidly shifts the fiber along the direction of its movement in a chosen point of the grating with a chosen shift value. As examples, single and double Ï phase shifts are introduced in fiber Bragg gratings with a length up to 34 mm in passive fibers, which provide corresponding transmission peaks with bandwidth less than 1 pm. It is shown that 37 mm Ï -phase-shifted grating inscribed in an active Er-doped fiber forms high-quality DFB laser cavity generating single-frequency radiation at 1550 nm with bandwidth of 20 kHz and signal-to-noise ratio of >70 dB. The inscription technique has a high degree of performance and flexibility and can be easily implemented in fibers of various types.\n\nDevelopment of an advanced uncooled 10-Gb DFB laser for volume manufacture\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBurns, Gordon; Charles, Paul M.\n\n2003-03-01\n\nOptical communication systems operating at 10Gbit/s such as 10Gigabit Ethernet are becoming more and more important in Local Area Networks (LAN) and Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN). This market requires optical transceivers of low cost, size and power consumption. This drives a need for uncooled DFB lasers directly modulated at 10Gbit/s. This paper describes the development of a state of the art uncooled high speed DFB laser which is capable of being manufactured in high volume at the low cost demanded by the GbE market. A DFB laser was designed by developing technological building blocks within the 'conventional\" InGaAsP materials system, using existing well proven manufacturing processes modules wherever possible, limiting the design risk to a few key areas where innovation was required. The temperature and speed performance of the InGaAsP SMQW active layer system was carefully optimized and then coupled with a low parasitic lateral confinement system. Using concurrent engineering, new processes were demonstrated to have acceptable process capability within a manufacturing fabrication environment, proving their ability to support high volume manufacturing requirements. The DFB laser fabricated was shown to operate at 100C chip temperature with an open eye at 10Gbit/s operation (with an extinction ratio >5dB). Up to 90C operation this DFB shows threshold current as low as 29mA, optical power as high as 13mW and it meets the 10Gb scaled Ethernet mask with extinction ratio >6dB. It was found that the high temperature dynamic behavior of these lasers could not be fully predicted from static test data. A production test strategy was therefore followed where equipment was designed to fully test devices/subassemblies at 100C and up to 20Gbit/s at key points in the product build. This facilitated the rapid optimisation of product yields upon manufacturing ramp up and minimization of product costs. This state of the art laser is now transferred into volume manufacture.\n\nPump spot size dependent lasing threshold in organic semiconductor DFB lasers fabricated via nanograting transfer.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Xin; Klinkhammer, SÃ¶nke; Wang, Ziyao; Wienhold, Tobias; Vannahme, Christoph; Jakobs, Peter-JÃ¼rgen; Bacher, Andreas; Muslija, Alban; Mappes, Timo; Lemmer, Uli\n\n2013-11-18\n\nOptically excited organic semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) lasers enable efficient lasing in the visible spectrum. Here, we report on the rapid and parallel fabrication of DFB lasers via transferring a nanograting structure from a flexible mold onto an unstructured film of the organic gain material. This geometrically well-defined structure allows for a systematic investigation of the laser threshold behavior. The laser thresholds for these devices show a strong dependence on the pump spot diameter. This experimental finding is in good qualitative agreement with calculations based on coupled-wave theory. With further investigations on various DFB laser geometries prepared by different routes and based on different organic gain materials, we found that these findings are quite general. This is important for the comparison of threshold values of various devices characterized under different excitation areas.\n\nDistributed feedback fiber laser based on a fiber Bragg grating inscribed using the femtosecond point-by-point technique\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSkvortsov, M. I.; Wolf, A. A.; Dostovalov, A. V.; Vlasov, A. A.; Akulov, V. A.; Babin, S. A.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser based on a 32-mm long pi-phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating inscribed using the femtosecond point-by-point technique in a single-mode erbium-doped optical fiber (CorActive EDF-L 1500) is demonstrated. The lasing power of the DFB laser reaches 0.7 mW at a wavelength of 1550ânm when pumped with a laser diode at a wavelength of 976ânm and power of 525 mW. The width of the lasing spectrum is 17âkHz. It is shown that the pi-phase-shifted fiber Bragg grating fs-inscribed in a non-PM fiber provides the selection of the single polarization mode of the DFB laser. DFB laser formation in a highly doped non-photosensitive optical fiber (CoreActive SCF-ER60-8/125-12) is also demonstrated.\n\nDFB fiber laser static strain sensor based on beat frequency interrogation with a reference fiber laser locked to a FBG resonator.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Wenzhu; Feng, Shengwen; Zhang, Wentao; Li, Fang\n\n2016-05-30\n\nWe report on a high-resolution static strain sensor developed with distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser. A reference FBG resonator is used for temperature compensation. Locking another independent fiber laser to the resonator using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique results in a strain power spectral density better than SÎµ(f) = (4.6 Ã 10-21) Îµ2/Hz in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 kHz, corresponding to a minimum dynamic strain resolution of 67.8 pÎµ/âHz. This frequency stabilized fiber laser is proposed to interrogate the sensing DFB fiber laser by the beat frequency principle. As a reasonable DFB fiber laser setup is realized, a narrow beat frequency line-width of 3.23 kHz and a high beat frequency stability of 0.036 MHz in 15 minutes are obtained in the laboratory test, corresponding to a minimum static strain resolution of 270 pÎµ. This is the first time that a sub-0.5 nÎµ level for static strain measurement using DFB fiber laser is demonstrated.\n\n10th order laterally coupled GaN-based DFB laser diodes with V-shaped surface gratings\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKang, J. H.; Wenzel, H.; Hoffmann, V.; Freier, E.; Sulmoni, L.; Unger, R.-S.; Einfeldt, S.; Wernicke, T.; Kneissl, M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSingle longitudinal mode operation of laterally coupled distributed feedback (DFB) laser diodes (LDs) based on GaN containing 10th-order surface Bragg gratings with V-shaped grooves is demonstrated using i-line stepper lithography and inductively coupled plasma etching. A threshold current of 82 mA, a slope efficiency of 1.7 W/A, a single peak emission at 404.5 nm with a full width at half maximum of 0.04 nm and a side mode suppression ratio of > 23 dB at an output power of about 46 mW were achieved under pulsed operation. The shift of the lasing wavelength of DFB LDs with temperature was around three times smaller than that of conventional ridge waveguide LDs.\n\nCalibration-free wavelength-modulation spectroscopy based on a swiftly determined wavelength-modulation frequency response function of a DFB laser.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Gang; Tan, Wei; Hou, Jiajia; Qiu, Xiaodong; Ma, Weiguang; Li, Zhixin; Dong, Lei; Zhang, Lei; Yin, Wangbao; Xiao, Liantuan; Axner, Ove; Jia, Suotang\n\n2016-01-25\n\nA methodology for calibration-free wavelength modulation spectroscopy (CF-WMS) that is based upon an extensive empirical description of the wavelength-modulation frequency response (WMFR) of DFB laser is presented. An assessment of the WMFR of a DFB laser by the use of an etalon confirms that it consists of two parts: a 1st harmonic component with an amplitude that is linear with the sweep and a nonlinear 2nd harmonic component with a constant amplitude. Simulations show that, among the various factors that affect the line shape of a background-subtracted peak-normalized 2f signal, such as concentration, phase shifts between intensity modulation and frequency modulation, and WMFR, only the last factor has a decisive impact. Based on this and to avoid the impractical use of an etalon, a novel method to pre-determine the parameters of the WMFR by fitting to a background-subtracted peak-normalized 2f signal has been developed. The accuracy of the new scheme to determine the WMFR is demonstrated and compared with that of conventional methods in CF-WMS by detection of trace acetylene. The results show that the new method provides a four times smaller fitting error than the conventional methods and retrieves concentration more accurately.\n\nPhase-Shifted Laser Feedback Interferometry\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOvryn, Benjie\n\n1999-01-01\n\nPhase-shifted, laser feedback interferometry is a new diagnostic tool developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center under the Advanced Technology Development (ATD) Program directed by NASA Headquarters Microgravity Research Division. It combines the principles of phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) and laser-feedback interferometry (LFI) to produce an instrument that can quantify both optical path length changes and sample reflectivity variations. In a homogenous medium, the optical path length between two points is the product of the index of refraction and the geometric distance between the two points. LFI differs from other forms of interferometry by using the laser as both the source and the phase detector. In LFI, coherent feedback of the incident light either reflected directly from a surface or reflected after transmission through a region of interest will modulate the output intensity of the laser. The combination of PSI and LFI has produced a robust instrument, based on a low-power helium-neon (HeNe) gas laser, with a high dynamic range that can be used to measure either static or oscillatory changes of the optical path length. Small changes in optical path length are limited by the fraction of a fringe that can be measured; we can measure nonoscillatory changes with a root mean square (rms) error of the wavelength/1000 without averaging.\n\nMicrowave generation in an electro-absorption modulator integrated with a DFB laser subject to optical injection.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Ning Hua; Zhang, Hong Guang; Man, Jiang Wei; Zhu, Hong Liang; Ke, Jian Hong; Liu, Yu; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Hai Qing; Xie, Liang; Wang, Wei\n\n2009-11-23\n\nThis paper presents a new technique to generate microwave signal using an electro-absorption modulator (EAM) integrated with a distributed feedback (DFB) laser subject to optical injection. Experiments show that the frequency of the generated microwave can be tuned by changing the wavelength of the external laser or adjusting the bias voltage of the EAM. The frequency response of the EAM is studied and found to be unsmooth due to packaging parasitic effects and four-wave mixing effect occurring in the active layer of the DFB laser. It is also demonstrated that an EA modulator integrated in between two DFB lasers can be used instead of the EML under optical injection. This integrated chip can be used to realize a monolithically integrated tunable microwave source.\n\nTunable microwave signal generator with an optically-injected 1310 nm QD-DFB laser.\n\nPubMed\n\nHurtado, Antonio; Mee, Jesse; Nami, Mohsen; Henning, Ian D; Adams, Michael J; Lester, Luke F\n\n2013-05-06\n\nTunable microwave signal generation with frequencies ranging from below 1 GHz to values over 40 GHz is demonstrated experimentally with a 1310 nm Quantum Dot (QD) Distributed-Feedback (DFB) laser. Microwave signal generation is achieved using the period 1 dynamics induced in the QD DFB under optical injection. Continuous tuning in the positive detuning frequency range of the quantum dot's unique stability map is demonstrated. The simplicity of the experimental configuration offers promise for novel uses of these nanostructure lasers in Radio-over-Fiber (RoF) applications and future mobile networks.\n\nDBR and DFB Lasers in Neodymium- and Ytterbium-Doped Photothermorefractive Glasses\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRyasnyanskiy, Aleksandr; Vorobiev, N.; Smirnov, V.; Lumeau, J.; Glebov, A.; Mokhun, O..; Spiegelberg, Ch.; Krainak, Michael A.; Glebov, A.; Glebov, L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe first demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, of distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) and monolithic distributed feedback (DFB) lasers in photothermorefractive glass doped with rare-earth ions is reported. The lasers were produced by incorporation of the volume Bragg gratings into the laser gain elements. A monolithic single-frequency solid-state laser with a line width of 250 kHz and output power of 150 mW at 1066 nm is demonstrated.\n\nContinuously tunable solution-processed organic semiconductor DFB lasers pumped by laser diode.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlinkhammer, SÃ¶nke; Liu, Xin; Huska, Klaus; Shen, Yuxin; Vanderheiden, Sylvia; Valouch, Sebastian; Vannahme, Christoph; BrÃ¤se, Stefan; Mappes, Timo; Lemmer, Uli\n\n2012-03-12\n\nThe fabrication and characterization of continuously tunable, solution-processed distributed feedback (DFB) lasers in the visible regime is reported. Continuous thin film thickness gradients were achieved by means of horizontal dipping of several conjugated polymer and blended small molecule solutions on cm-scale surface gratings of different periods. We report optically pumped continuously tunable laser emission of 13 nm in the blue, 16 nm in the green and 19 nm in the red spectral region on a single chip respectively. Tuning behavior can be described with the Bragg-equation and the measured thickness profile. The laser threshold is low enough that inexpensive laser diodes can be used as pump sources.\n\nCrosstalk analyse of DFB fiber laser hydrophone array based on time division multiplexing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Yu; Huang, Junbin; Gu, Hongcan; Tang, Bo; Wu, Jing\n\n2014-12-01\n\nIn this paper, the crosstalk of a time division multiplexed (TDM) system of distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser (FL)hydrophones based on optical switch using Phase Generated Carrier (PGC) method was quantitatively analyzed. After mathematical deduction, the relationship among crosstalk, multiplexing scale and extinction ratio of optical switch was given. The simulation results show that to realize a TDM system of DFB fiber laser hydrophones with crosstalk lower than -40dB, the average extinction ratio should be higher than 24.78dB for a 4- channel system, while higher than 28.45dB for an 8- channel system. Two experiments to analyze the array crosstalk to a certain channel in an 8- channel array were conducted in this paper. Firstly, by testing the powers of leak laser to a certain channel from others, the array crosstalk to this channel was obtained according to the equation mathematically deduced in this paper. The result shows the array crosstalk to a certain channel of the 8-channel array was -7.6dB. An experiment of underwater acoustic detection was carried out finally to get the real array crosstalk to this certain channel, and the experimental result shows that the array crosstalk to this channel is -8.8dB, which is close to the calculated result.\n\nPackaging and testing of multi-wavelength DFB laser array using REC technology\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNi, Yi; Kong, Xuan; Gu, Xiaofeng; Chen, Xiangfei; Zheng, Guanghui; Luan, Jia\n\n2014-02-01\n\nPackaging of distributed feedback (DFB) laser array based on reconstruction-equivalent-chirp (REC) technology is a bridge from chip to system, and influences the practical process of REC chip. In this paper, DFB laser arrays of 4-channel @1310 nm and 8-channel @1550 nm are packaged. Our experimental results show that both these laser arrays have uniform wavelength spacing and larger than 35 dB average Side Mode Suppression Ratio (SMSR). When I=35 mA, we obtain the total output power of 1 mW for 4-channel @1310 nm, and 227 Î¼w for 8-channel @1550 nm respectively. The high frequency characteristics of the packaged chips are also obtained, and the requirements for 4Ã10 G or even 8Ã10 G systems can be reached.

The next generation Ethernet will most likely be 400 Gb/s which will require components with even higher bandwidth. Commercially available EMLs are regarded as high-cost components due to their separate epitaxial butt-coupling growth process to separately optimize the DFB laser and the electro-absorption modulator (EAM). Alternatively the selective area growth (SAG) technique is used to achieve different MQW bandgaps in the DFB and EAM section of an EML. However for a lot of applications an emission wavelength within a narrow wavelength window is required enforcing a temperature controlled operation. All these applications can be covered with the developed EML devices that use a single InGaAlAs MQW waveguide for both the DFB and the EAM enabling a low-cost fabrication process similar to a conventional DFB laser diode. It will be shown that such devices can be used for 25Gb/s and 40Gb/s applications with excellent performance. By an additional monolithic integration of an impedance matching circuit the module fabrication costs can be reduced but also the modulation bandwidth of the devices can be further enhanced. Up to 70Gb/s modulation with excellent eye openings can be achieved. This novel approach opens the possibility for 100Gb/s NRZ EMLs and thus 4x100Gb/s NRZ EML-based transmitters in future. Also even higher bitrates seem feasible using more complex modulation formats such as e.g. DMT and PAM.\n\nOptical frequency locked loop for long-term stabilization of broad-line DFB laser frequency difference\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLipka, MichaÅ; Parniak, MichaÅ; Wasilewski, Wojciech\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe present an experimental realization of the optical frequency locked loop applied to long-term frequency difference stabilization of broad-line DFB lasers along with a new independent method to characterize relative phase fluctuations of two lasers. The presented design is based on a fast photodiode matched with an integrated phase-frequency detector chip. The locking setup is digitally tunable in real time, insensitive to environmental perturbations and compatible with commercially available laser current control modules. We present a simple model and a quick method to optimize the loop for a given hardware relying exclusively on simple measurements in time domain. Step response of the system as well as phase characteristics closely agree with the theoretical model. Finally, frequency stabilization for offsets within 4-15 GHz working range achieving <0.1 Hz long-term stability of the beat note frequency for 500 s averaging time period is demonstrated. For these measurements we employ an I/Q mixer that allows us to precisely and independently measure the full phase trace of the beat note signal.\n\nHigh Efficiency, Low Power-Consumption DFB Quantum Cascade Lasers Without Lateral Regrowth\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJia, Zhi-Wei; Wang, Li-Jun; Zhang, Jin-Chuan; Liu, Feng-Qi; Zhou, Yu-Hong; Wang, Dong-Bo; Jia, Xue-Feng; Zhuo, Ning; Liu, Jun-Qi; Zhai, Shen-Qiang; Wang, Zhan-Guo\n\n2017-04-01\n\nVery low power-consumption distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) at the wavelength around 4.9 Î¼m were fabricated by conventional process without lateral regrowth of InP:Fe or using sidewall grating. Benefitted from the optimized materials and low waveguide loss, very low threshold current density of 0.5 kA/cm2 was obtained for a device with cavity length of 2 mm. Combined with the partial-high-reflection coating, the 1-mm-long DFB QCL achieved low power-consumption continuous wave (CW) operation up to 105 Â°C. The CW threshold power-consumptions were 0.72 and 0.78 W at 15 and 25 Â°C, respectively. The maximum CW output power was over 110 mW at 15 Â°C and still more than 35 mW at 105 Â°C. At 15 Â°C, wall-plug efficiency of 5.5% and slope efficiency of 1.8 W/A were deduced, which were very high for low power-consumption DFB QCLs.\n\nUltra-narrow-linewidth erbium-doped lasers on a silicon photonics platform\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Nanxi; Purnawirman, Purnawirman; Magden, E.

B.; Watts, Michael R.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe report ultra-narrow-linewidth erbium-doped aluminum oxide (Al2O3:Er3+) distributed feedback (DFB) lasers with a wavelength-insensitive silicon-compatible waveguide design. The waveguide consists of five silicon nitride (SiNx) segments buried under silicon dioxide (SiO2) with a layer Al2O3:Er3+ deposited on top. This design has a high confinement factor (> 85%) and a near perfect (> 98%) intensity overlap for an octave-spanning range across near infrared wavelengths (950-2000 nm). We compare the performance of DFB lasers in discrete quarter phase shifted (QPS) cavity and distributed phase shifted (DPS) cavity. Using QPS-DFB configuration, we obtain maximum output powers of 0.41 mW, 0.76 mW, and 0.47 mW at widely spaced wavelengths within both the C and L bands of the erbium gain spectrum (1536 nm, 1566 nm, and 1596 nm). In a DPS cavity, we achieve an order of magnitude improvement in maximum output power (5.43 mW) and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) of > 59.4 dB at an emission wavelength of 1565 nm. We observe an ultra-narrow linewidth of ÎÎ½DPS = 5.3 +/- 0.3 kHz for the DPS-DFB laser, as compared to ÎÎ³QPS = 30.4 +/- 1.1 kHz for the QPS-DFB laser, measured by a recirculating self-heterodyne delayed interferometer (RSHDI). Even narrower linewidth can be achieved by mechanical stabilization of the setup, increasing the pump absorption efficiency, increasing the output power, or enhancing the cavity Q.\n\nHigh Efficiency, Low Power-Consumption DFB Quantum Cascade Lasers Without Lateral Regrowth.\n\nPubMed\n\nJia, Zhi-Wei; Wang, Li-Jun; Zhang, Jin-Chuan; Liu, Feng-Qi; Zhou, Yu-Hong; Wang, Dong-Bo; Jia, Xue-Feng; Zhuo, Ning; Liu, Jun-Qi; Zhai, Shen-Qiang; Wang, Zhan-Guo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nVery low power-consumption distributed feedback (DFB) quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) at the wavelength around 4.9Â Î¼m were fabricated by conventional process without lateral regrowth of InP:Fe or using sidewall grating.

W.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe use of visible lasers for medical treatments is on the rise, and together with this comes higher expectations for the laser systems. For many medical treatments, such as ophthalmology, doctors require pulse on demand operation together with a complete extinction of the light between pulses. We have demonstrated power modulation from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz at 532 nm with a modulation depth above 97% by wavelength detuning of the laser diode. The laser diode is a 1064 nm monolithic device with a distributed feedback (DFB) laser as the master oscillator (MO), and a tapered power amplifier (PA). The MO and PA have separate electrical contacts and the modulation is achieved with wavelength tuning by adjusting the current through the MO 40 mA.\n\nCompact DFB laser modules with integrated isolator at 935 nm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nReggentin, M.; Thiem, H.; Tsianos, G.; Malach, M.; Hofmann, J.; Plocke, T.; Kneier, M.; Richter, L.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nNew developments in industrial applications and applications under rough environmental conditions within the field of spectroscopy and quantum technology in the 935 nm wavelength regime demand new compact, stable and robust laser systems. Beside a stable laser source the integration of a compact optical isolator is necessary to reduce size and power consumption for the whole laser system. The integration of a suitable optical isolator suppresses back reflections from the following optical system efficiently. However, the miniaturization of the optics inside the package leads to high optical power density levels that make a more detailed analysis of the components and their laser damage threshold necessary. We present test results on compact stable DFB laser sources (butterfly style packages) with newly integrated optical isolators operating around 935 nm. The presented data includes performance and lifetime tests for the laser diodes as well as package components. Overall performance data of the packaged laser diodes will be shown as well.\n\nDFB Lasers Between 760 nm and 16 Î¼m for Sensing Applications\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZeller, Wolfgang; Naehle, Lars; Fuchs, Peter; Gerschuetz, Florian; Hildebrandt, Lars; Koeth, Johannes\n\n2010-01-01\n\nRecent years have shown the importance of tunable semiconductor lasers in optical sensing.

Forward output laser was amplified using a certain length of Nufern EDFL-980-Hp erbium-doped fiber to absorb the surplus pump power after the active phase-shifted fiber grating and get population inversion. By using OptiSystem software, the best fiber length of the EDFL to get the highest gain was simulated. In order to keep the amplified laser with the narrow line-width and low noise, a narrow-band light filter consisting of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) with the same Bragg wavelength as the laser and an optical circulator was used to filter the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise of the out-cavity erbium-doped fiber. The designed laser structure sufficiently utilized the pump power, and a DFB fiber laser with the 32.5-mW output power, 11.5-kHz line width, and -87-dB/Hz relative intensity noise (RIN) at 300 mW of 980 nm pump power was brought out.\n\nEvaluation of 2.1Î¼m DFB lasers for space applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbero, J.; LÃ³pez, D.; Esquivias, I.; Tijero, J.

The paper focus on the functional and environmental evaluation test plan. It includes high precision characterization, mechanical test (vibration and SRS shocks), thermal cycling, gamma and proton radiation tests, life test and some details of the Destructive Physical Analysis performed. The electro-optical characterization includes measurements of the tuning capabilities of the laser both by current and by temperature, the wavelength stability and the optical power versus laser current.\n\nInitial evaluation of commercially available InGaAsP DFB laser diodes for use in high-speed digital fiber optic transceivers\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCook, Anthony L.; Hendricks, Herbert D.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nNASA has been pursuing the development of high-speed fiber-optic transceivers for use in a number of space data system applications. Current efforts are directed toward a high-performance all-integrated-circuit transceiver operating up to the 3-5 Gb/s range. Details of the evaluation and selection of candidate high-speed optical sources to be used in the space-qualified high-performance transceiver are presented. Data on the performance of commercially available DFB (distributed feedback) lasers are presented, and their performance relative to each other and to their structural design with regard to their use in high-performance fiber-optic transceivers is discussed. The DFB lasers were obtained from seven commercial manufacturers. The data taken on each laser included threshold current, differential quantum efficiency, CW side mode suppression radio, wavelength temperature coefficient, threshold temperature coefficient, natural linewidth, and far field pattern. It was found that laser diodes with buried heterostructures and first-order gratings had, in general, the best CW operating characteristics. The modulated characteristics of the DFB laser diodes are emphasized. Modulated linewidth, modulated side mode suppression ratio, and frequency response are discussed.\n\nNovel hybrid laser modes in composite VCSEL-DFB microcavities (Conference Presentation)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMischok, Andreas; Wagner, Tim; Sudzius, Markas; BrÃ¼ckner, Robert; FrÃ¶b, Hartmut; Lyssenko, Vadim G.; Leo, Karl\n\n2017-02-01\n\nTwo of the most successful microcresonator concepts are the vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), where light is confined between distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs), and the distributed feedback (DFB) laser, where a periodic grating provides positive optical feedback to selected modes in an active waveguide (WG) layer. Our work concerns the combination of both into a composite device, facilitating coherent interaction between both regimes and giving rise to novel laser modes in the system. In a first realization, a full VCSEL stack with an organic active layer is evaporated on top of a diffraction grating with a large period (approximately 1 micron), leading to diffraction of waveguided modes into the surface emission of the device. Here, the coherent interaction between VCSEL and WG modes, as observed in an anticrossing of the dispersion lines, facilitates novel hybrid lasing modes with macroscopic in-plane coherence [1]. In further studies, we decrease the grating period of such devices to realise DFB conditions in a second-order Bragg grating which strongly couples photons via first-order light diffraction to the VCSEL. This efficient coupling can be compared to more classical cascade-coupled cavities and is successfully described by a coupled oscillator model [2]. When both resonators are non-degenerate, they are able to function as independent structures without substantial diffraction losses. The realization of such novel devices provides a promising platform for photonic circuits based on organic microlasers. [1] A. Mischok et al., Adv. Opt.

Distributed feedback (DFB) lasers, by contrast, are compact and inexpensive, but the tuning range per diode is limited to ~600 GHz at 1.5 Î¼m. In this paper, we show that a combination of three DFB diodes covers the complete frequency range from 0 - 2750 GHz without any gaps. In combination with InGaAs-based photomixers for terahertz generation and detection, the system achieves a dynamic range of > 100 dB at 56 GHz, 64 dB at 1000 GHz, and 26 dB at 2500 GHz. A field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based lock-in amplifier permits a flexible adjustment of the integration time from 0.5 ms to 600 ms. Employing an optimized \"fast scan\" mode, a spectrum of ~1200 GHz - the bandwidth of each subset of two lasers - and 40 MHz steps is acquired in less than one minute, still maintaining a reasonable dynamic range. To the best of our knowledge, the bandwidth of 2.75 THz presents a new record for DFB-based CW-terahertz systems.\n\nHigh-power Al-free active region (Î»= 852nm) DFB laser diodes for atomic clocks and interferometry applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLigeret, V.; Vermersch, F.-J.; Bansropun, S.; Lecomte, M.; Calligaro, M.; Parillaud, O.; Krakowski, M.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nAtomic clocks will be used in the future European positioning system Galileo. Among them, the optically pumped clocks provide a better alternative with comparable accuracy for a more compact system. For these systems, diode lasers emitting at 852nm are strategic components. The laser in a conventional bench for atomic clocks presents disadvantages for spatial applications. A better approach would be to realise a system based on a distributed-feedback laser (DFB). We have developed the technological foundations of such lasers operating at 852nm. These include an Al free active region, a single spatial mode ridge waveguide and a DFB structure. The device is a separate confinement heterostructure with a GaInP large optical cavity and a single compressive strained GaInAsP quantum well. The broad area laser diodes are characterised by low internal losses (<3cm -1 ), a high internal efficiency (94%) and a low transparency current density (100A/cm2). For an AR-HR coated ridge Fabry Perot laser, we obtain a power of 230mW with M2=1.3. An optical power of 150mW was obtained at 854nm wavelength, 20Â°C for AR-HR coated devices. We obtain a single spatial mode emission with M2=1.21 and a SMSR over 30dB, both at 150mW. DFB Lasers at 852.12nm, corresponding to the D2 caesium transition, were then realised with a power of 40mW, 37Â°C for uncoated devices. The SMSR is over 30dB and the M2=1.33 at 40mW. Furthermore, the preliminary results of the linewidth obtained with a Fabry Perot interferometer give a value of less than 2MHz.\n\nInfluence of the UV-induced fiber loss on the distributed feedback fiber lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFan, Wei; Chen, Bai; Qiao, Qiquan; Chen, Jialing; Lin, Zunqi\n\n2003-06-01\n\nIt was found that the output power of the distributed feedback fiber lasers would be improved after annealing or left unused for several days after the laser had been fabricated, and the output of the fundamental mode would not increase but be clamped while the Â±1 order modes would be predominant with the enhancement of the coupling coefficient during the fabrication. The paper discussed the influence of UV-induced fiber loss on the fiber phase-shifted DFB lasers. Due to the gain saturation and fiber internal loss, which included the temperament loss and permanent loss, there was an optimum coupling coefficient for the DFB fiber lasers that the higher internal fiber loss corresponded to the lower optimum values of coupling coefficient.\n\nRare-earth-ion-doped ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers on a silicon chip and applications to intra-laser-cavity optical sensing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBernhardi, E. H.; de Ridder, R. M.; WÃ¶rhoff, K.; Pollnau, M.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nWe report on diode-pumped distributed-feedback (DFB) and distributed-Bragg-reflector (DBR) channel waveguide lasers in Er-doped and Yb-doped Al2O3 on standard thermally oxidized silicon substrates. Uniform surface-relief Bragg gratings were patterned by laser-interference lithography and etched into the SiO2 top cladding. The maximum grating reflectivity exceeded 99%. Monolithic DFB and DBR cavities with Q-factors of up to 1.35Ã106 were realized. The Erdoped DFB laser delivered 3 mW of output power with a slope efficiency of 41% versus absorbed pump power. Singlelongitudinal- mode operation at a wavelength of 1545.2 nm was achieved with an emission line width of 1.70 0.58 kHz, corresponding to a laser Q-factor of 1.14Ã1011. Yb-doped DFB and DBR lasers were demonstrated at wavelengths near 1020 nm with output powers of 55 mW and a slope efficiency of 67% versus launched pump power. An Yb-doped dualwavelength laser was achieved based on the optical resonances induced by two local phase shifts in the DFB structure. A stable microwave signal at ~15 GHz with a -3-dB width of 9 kHz and a long-term frequency stability of +/- 2.5 MHz was created via the heterodyne photo-detection of the two laser wavelengths. By measuring changes in the microwave beat signal as the intra-cavity evanescent laser field interacts with micro-particles on the waveguide surface, we achieved real-time detection and accurate size measurement of single micro-particles with diameters ranging between 1 Î¼m and 20 Î¼m, which represents the typical size of many fungal and bacterial pathogens. A limit of detection of ~500 nm was deduced.\n\nNovel Helmholtz-based photoacoustic sensor for trace gas detection at ppm level using GaInAsSb/GaAlAsSb DFB lasers.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattiello, Mario; NiklÃ¨s, Marc; Schilt, StÃ©phane; ThÃ©venaz, Luc; Salhi, Abdelmajid; Barat, David; Vicet, Aurore; Rouillard, Yves; Werner, Ralph; Koeth, Johannes\n\n2006-04-01\n\nA new and compact photoacoustic sensor for trace gas detection in the 2-2.5 microm atmospheric window is reported. Both the development of antimonide-based DFB lasers with singlemode emission in this spectral range and a novel design of photoacoustic cell adapted to the characteristics of these lasers are discussed. The laser fabrication was made in two steps. The structure was firstly grown by molecular beam epitaxy then a metallic DFB grating was processed. The photoacoustic cell is based on a Helmholtz resonator that was designed in order to fully benefit from the highly divergent emission of the antimonide laser. An optimized modulation scheme based on wavelength modulation of the laser source combined with second harmonic detection has been implemented for efficient suppression of wall noise. Using a 2211 nm laser, sub-ppm detection limit has been demonstrated for ammonia.\n\nImaging of gaseous oxygen through DFB laser illumination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCocola, L.; Fedel, M.; Tondello, G.; Poletto, L.\n\n2016-05-01\n\nA Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy setup with Wavelength Modulation has been used together with a synchronous sampling imaging sensor to obtain two-dimensional transmission-mode images of oxygen content. Modulated laser light from a 760nm DFB source has been used to illuminate a scene from the back while image frames were acquired with a high dynamic range camera. Thanks to synchronous timing between the imaging device and laser light modulation, the traditional lock-in approach used in Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy was replaced by image processing techniques, and many scanning periods were averaged together to allow resolution of small intensity variation over the already weak absorption signals from oxygen absorption band. After proper binning and filtering, the time-domain waveform obtained from each pixel in a set of frames representing the wavelength scan was used as the single detector signal in a traditional TDLAS-WMS setup, and so processed through a software defined digital lock-in demodulation and a second harmonic signal fitting routine. In this way the WMS artifacts of a gas absorption feature were obtained from each pixel together with intensity normalization parameter, allowing a reconstruction of oxygen distribution in a two-dimensional scene regardless from broadband transmitted intensity. As a first demonstration of the effectiveness of this setup, oxygen absorption images of similar containers filled with either oxygen or nitrogen were acquired and processed.\n\nApplication of Phase Shifted, Laser Feedback Interferometry to Fluid Physics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nOvryn, Ben; Eppell, Steven J.; Andrews, James H.; Khaydarov, John\n\n1996-01-01\n\nWe have combined the principles of phase-shifting interferometry (PSI) and laser-feedback interferometry (LFI) to produce a new instrument that can measure both optical path length (OPL) changes and discern sample reflectivity variations. In LFI, coherent feedback of the incident light either reflected directly from a surface or reflected after transmission through a region of interest will modulate the output intensity of the laser. LFI can yield a high signal-to-noise ratio even for low reflectivity samples. By combining PSI and LFI, we have produced a robust instrument, based upon a HeNe laser, with high dynamic range that can be used to measure either static (dc) or oscillatory changes along the optical path. As with other forms of interferometry, large changes in OPL require phase unwrapping. Conversely, small phase changes are limited by the fraction of a fringe that can be measured. We introduce the phase shifts with an electro-optic modulator (EOM) and use either the Carre or Hariharan algorithms to determine the phase and visibility. We have determined the accuracy and precision of our technique by measuring both the bending of a cantilevered piezoelectric bimorph and linear ramps to the EOM. Using PSI, sub-nanometer displacements can be measured. We have combined our interferometer with a commercial microscope and scanning piezoelectric stage and have measured the variation in OPL and visibility for drops of PDMS (silicone oil) on coated single crystal silicon. Our measurement of the static contact angle agrees with the value of 68 deg stated in the literature.\n\nExtended-bandwidth frequency sweeps of a distributed feedback laser using combined injection current and temperature modulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHefferman, Gerald; Chen, Zhen; Wei, Tao\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis article details the generation of an extended-bandwidth frequency sweep using a single, communication grade distributed feedback (DFB) laser. The frequency sweep is generated using a two-step technique. In the first step, injection current modulation is employed as a means of varying the output frequency of a DFB laser over a bandwidth of 99.26 GHz. A digital optical phase lock loop is used to lock the frequency sweep speed during current modulation, resulting in a linear frequency chirp. In the second step, the temperature of the DFB laser is modulated, resulting in a shifted starting laser output frequency. A laser frequency chirp is again generated beginning at this shifted starting frequency, resulting in a frequency-shifted spectrum relative to the first recorded data. This process is then repeated across a range of starting temperatures, resulting in a series of partially overlapping, frequency-shifted spectra. These spectra are then aligned using cross-correlation and combined using averaging to form a single, broadband spectrum with a total bandwidth of 510.9 GHz. In order to investigate the utility of this technique, experimental testing was performed in which the approach was used as the swept-frequency source of a coherent optical frequency domain reflectometry system. This system was used to interrogate an optical fiber containing a 20 point, 1-mm pitch length fiber Bragg grating, corresponding to a period of 100 GHz. Using this technique, both the periodicity of the grating in the frequency domain and the individual reflector elements of the structure in the time domain were resolved, demonstrating the technique's potential as a method of extending the sweeping bandwidth of semiconductor lasers for frequency-based sensing applications.\n\nExtended-bandwidth frequency sweeps of a distributed feedback laser using combined injection current and temperature modulation.\n\nPubMed\n\nHefferman, Gerald; Chen, Zhen; Wei, Tao\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThis article details the generation of an extended-bandwidth frequency sweep using a single, communication grade distributed feedback (DFB) laser.

Recently, a nonlinear generation has been shown in 10-20 cm DFB gratings in a highly nonlinear fiber. First, we show in this Letter a novel fabrication technique of ultra-long DFBs in a standard fiber (SMF-28). Second, we demonstrate nonlinear generation in such gratings. A particular inscription technique was used to fabricate all-in-phase ultra-long FBG and to implement reproducible phase shift to form a DFB mode. We demonstrate stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) emission from this DFB mode and characterize the resulting laser.

We demonstrate InGaAs-GaAs-AlGaAs DFB lasers fabricated from a single epitaxial growth using lateral evanescent coupling of the optical field to a surface grating etehed along the sides of the ridge. A CW threshold current of 25 mA and external quantum efficiency of 0.48 mW/mA per facet were measured for a 1 mm cavity length device with anti-reflection coated facets. Single-mode output powers as high as 11 mW per facet at 935 nm wavelength were attained.

DFB laser with chirped grating is found to have significant effects on the lasing characteristics. The coupled wave equations for these lasers are derived and solved using a power series method to obtain the threshold condition. A Newton- Raphson routine is used to solve the threshold conditions numerically to obtain threshold gain and lasing wavelengths. To prove the validity of this model, it is applied to both conventional index-coupled and complex- coupled DFB lasers. The threshold gain margins are calculated as functions of the ratio of the gain coupling to index coupling (|Îºg|/|Îº n|), and the phase difference between the index and gain gratings. It was found that for coupling coefficient |Îº|l < 0.9, the laser shows a mode degeneracy at particular values of the ratio |Îº g|/|Îºn|, for cleaved facets. We found that at phase differences Ï/2 and 3Ï/2, between the gain and index grating, for an AR-coated complex-coupled laser, the laser becomes multimode and a different mode starts to lase. We also studied the effect of the facet reflectivity (both magnitude and phase) on the gain margin of a complex- coupled DFB laser. Although, the gain margin varies slowly with the magnitude of the facet reflectivity, it shows large variations as a function of the phase. Spatial hole burning was found to be minimum at phase difference nÏ, n = 0, 1, ... and maximum at phase differences Ï/2 and 3Ï/2. The single mode gain margin of an index-coupled linearly chirped CG-DFB is calculated for different chirping factors and coupling constants. We found that there is clearly an optimum chirping for which the single mode gain margin is maximum. The gain margins were calculated also for different positions of the cavity center. The effect of the facet reflectivities and their phases on the gain margin was investigated. We found the gain\n\nThe effect of zinc diffusion on extinction ratio of MQW electroabsorption modulator integrated with DFB laser\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Daibing; Zhang, Ruikang; Wang, Huitao; Wang, Baojun; Bian, Jing; An, Xin; Zhao, Lingjuan; Zhu, Hongliang; Ji, Chen; Wang, Wei\n\n2014-11-01\n\nMonolithically integrated electroabsorption modulated lasers (EML) are widely being used in the optical fiber communication systems, due to their low chip, compact size and good compatible with the current communication systems. In this paper, we investigated the effect of Zinc diffusion on extinction ratio of electroabsorption modulator (EAM) integrated with distributed feedback laser (DFB). EML was fabricated by selective area growth (SAG) technology. The MQW structure of different quantum energy levels was grown on n-type InP buffer layer with 150nm thick SiO2 parallel stripes mask by selective area metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). A 35nm photoluminescence wavelength variation was observed between the laser area (Î»PL=1535nm) and modulator area (Î»PL=1500nm) by adjusting the dimension of parallel stripes. The grating (Î»=1550nm) was fabricated in the selective area. The device was mesa ridge structure, which was constituted of the DFB laser, isolation gap and modulator. The length of every part is 300Î¼m, 50Î¼m, and 150Î¼m respectively. Two samples were fabricated with the same structure and different p-type Zn-doped concentration, the extinction ratio of heavy Zn-doped device is 12.5dB at -6V. In contrast, the extinction ratio of light Zn-doped device is 20dB at -6V, that was improved for approximate 60%. The different Zn diffusion depth into the MQW absorption layer was observed by Secondary ion mass spectrometer (SIMS). The heavy Zn-doped device diffused into absorption layer deeper than the light Zn-doped device, which caused the large non-uniformity of the electric field in the MQW layer. So the extinction ratio characteristics can be improved by optimizing the Zn-doped concentration of p-type layer.\n\nModulation of distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode with the autonomous Chua's circuit: Theory and experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTalla MbÃ©, Jimmi HervÃ©; Woafo, Paul\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe report on a simple way to generate complex optical waveforms with very cheap and accessible equipments. The general idea consists in modulating a laser diode with an autonomous electronic oscillator, and in the case of this study, we use a distributed feedback (DFB) laser diode pumped with an electronic Chua's circuit. Based on the adiabatic P-I characteristics of the laser diode at low frequencies, we show that when the total pump is greater than the laser threshold, it is possible to convert the electrical waveforms of the Chua's circuit into optical carriers. But, if that is not the case, the on-off dynamical behavior of the laser permits to obtain many other optical waveform signals, mainly pulses. Our numerical results are consistent with experimental measurements. The work presents the advantage of extending the range of possible chaotic dynamics of the laser diodes in the time domains (millisecond) where it is not usually expected with conventional modulation techniques. Moreover, this new technique of laser diodes modulation brings a general benefit in the physical equipment, reduces their cost and congestion so that, it can constitute a step towards photonic integrated circuits.\n\nAtmospheric turbulence compensation with laser phase shifting interferometry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRabien, S.; Eisenhauer, F.; Genzel, R.; Davies, R. I.; Ott, T.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nLaser guide stars with adaptive optics allow astronomical image correction in the absence of a natural guide star. Single guide star systems with a star created in the earth's sodium layer can be used to correct the wavefront in the near infrared spectral regime for 8-m class telescopes. For possible future telescopes of larger sizes, or for correction at shorter wavelengths, the use of a single guide star is ultimately limited by focal anisoplanatism that arises from the finite height of the guide star. To overcome this limitation we propose to overlap coherently pulsed laser beams that are expanded over the full aperture of the telescope, traveling upwards along the same path which light from the astronomical object travels downwards. Imaging the scattered light from the resultant interference pattern with a camera gated to a certain height above the telescope, and using phase shifting interferometry we have found a method to retrieve the local wavefront gradients. By sensing the backscattered light from two different heights, one can fully remove the cone effect, which can otherwise be a serious handicap to the use of laser guide stars at shorter wavelengths or on larger telescopes. Using two laser beams multiconjugate correction is possible, resulting in larger corrected fields. With a proper choice of laser, wavefront correction could be expanded to the visible regime and, due to the lack of a cone effect, the method is applicable to any size of telescope. Finally the position of the laser spot could be imaged from the side of the main telescope against a bright background star to retrieve tip-tilt information, which would greatly improve the sky coverage of the system.\n\nLiquid-phase epitaxy grown PbSnTe distributed feedback laser diodes with broad continuous single-mode tuning range\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHsieh, H.-H.; Fonstad, C.

This approach is shown to be in agreement with previous derivations which use the characteristic equations. Utilizing this unified analysis, we obtain the modal properties of circular DFB, disk-, and ring- Bragg resonator lasers. We also compare the threshold gain, single mode range, quality factor, emission efficiency, and modal area of these types of circular grating lasers. It is demonstrated that, under similar conditions, disk Bragg resonator lasers have the highest quality factor, the highest emission efficiency, and the smallest modal area, indicating their suitability in low-threshold, high-efficiency, ultracompact laser design, while ring Bragg resonator lasers have a large single mode range, high emission efficiency, and large modal area, indicating their suitability for high-efficiency, large-area, high-power applications.\n\nHigh-Power DFB Diode Laser-Based CO-QEPAS Sensor: Optimization and Performance\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Yufei; Tong, Yao; He, Ying; Yu, Xin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA highly sensitive carbon monoxide (CO) trace gas sensor based on quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) was demonstrated.

Gain switching at few-GHz frequencies produces a train of bright pulses with nearly equal amplitudes and random phases. An unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer is used to interfere subsequent pulses and thereby generate strong random-amplitude pulses, which are detected and digitized to produce a high-rate random bit string. Using established models of semiconductor laser field dynamics, we predict a regime of high visibility interference and nearly complete vacuum-fluctuation-induced phase diffusion between pulses. These are confirmed by measurement of pulse power statistics at the output of the interferometer. Using a 5.825 GHz excitation rate and 14-bit digitization, we observe 43 Gbps quantum randomness generation.\n\nResearch on a novel composite structure ErÂ³âº-doped DBR fiber laser with a Ï-phase shifted FBG.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yanjie; Chang, Jun; Wang, Qingpu; Ni, Jiasheng; Song, Zhiqiang; Qi, Haifeng; Wang, Chang; Wang, Pengpeng; Gao, Liang; Sun, Zhihui; Lv, Guangping; Liu, Tongyu; Peng, Gangding\n\n2013-09-23\n\nA simple composite cavity structure ErÂ³âº-doped fiber laser was proposed and demonstrated experimentally. The resonant cavity consists of a pair of uniform fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) and a Ï-phase shifted FBG.

The narrow linewidth of 900 Hz and low RIN of -95 dB/Hz were obtained. And the lasing wavelength was rather stable with the pump power changing. The SMRS was more than 67 dB.

By employing saline with different refractive indices instead of a culture medium, the refractive index of the cells, which is necessary for the determination of cell height, is determined under PLM. The observed height of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells cultivated under higher osmolarity is lower than that of the cells cultivated under physiological osmolarity, which is in agreement with previous data observed under an atomic force microscope (AFM). Maximum heights of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells measured under PLM and AFM agree well with each other. The maximum height of nonadherent spherical CHO cells observed under PLM is comparable to the cell diameter measured under a phase contrast inverted microscope. Laser irradiation, which is necessary for the observation under PLM, did not affect 3-D cell morphology. In conclusion, 3-D morphology of adhered animal cells can be noninvasively measured under PLM.\n\nSimultaneous detection of CO and CO2 using a semiconductor DFB diode laser at 1.578 Âµm\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGabrysch, M.; Corsi, C.; Pavone, F.

Similar to the construction of variable polarization retarder, this assembly consists of two thin wedge prisms made from appropriately chosen optical materials. Being shifted as a whole, the assembly allows changing the phase delay with no influence on the cavity round-trip time, whereas relative shifting of the prisms enables adjustment of the latter. This scheme is discussed theoretically and verified experimentally, indicating a factor 30 reduction of the influence on the repetition rate compared to the commonly used silica wedge pair. For a 2pi adjustment of the carrier-envelope phase shift, single-pass timing differences are reduced to the single-femtosecond regime. With negligible distortions of timing and dispersion, the described compensator device greatly simplifies carrier-envelope phase control and experiments in extreme nonlinear optics.

As master oscillator (MO) a Y-branch DFB-laser is used. The two branches, which can be individually controlled, deliver the two wavelengths needed for a differential absorption measurement of water vapor. Adjusting the current through the DFB sections, the wavelength can be adjusted with respect to the targeted either \"on\" or \"off\" resonance, respectively wavelength Î»on or wavelength Î»off.

In both cases, three all-organic, vertically-emitting distributed feedback (DFB) lasers are assembled onto a common ultra-thin glass membrane substrate and fully encapsulated by a thin polymer overlayer and an additional 50 Âµm-thick glass membrane in order to improve the performance. The first device format has the three DFB lasers sitting next to each other on the glass substrate. The DFB lasers are simultaneously excited by a single overlapping optical pump, emitting spatially separated red, green and blue laser output with individual thresholds of, respectively, 28 ÂµJ/cm(2), 11 ÂµJ/cm(2) and 32 ÂµJ/cm(2) (for 5 ns pump pulses). The second device format has the three DFB lasers, respectively the red, green and blue laser, vertically stacked onto the flexible glass. This device format emits a white laser output for an optical pump fluence above 42 ÂµJ/cm(2).\n\nMonolithically integrated distributed feedback laser array wavelength-selectable light sources for WDM-PON application\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Xin; Zhao, Jianyi; Zhou, Ning; Huang, Xiaodong; Cao, Mingde; Wang, Lei; Liu, Wen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe monolithic integration of 1.5-Î¼m four channels phase shift distributed feedback lasers array (DFB-LD array) with 4Ã1 multi-mode interference (MMI) optical combiner is demonstrated. A home developed process mainly consists of butt-joint regrowth (BJR) and simultaneous thermal and ultraviolet nanoimprint lithography (STU-NIL) is implemented to fabricate gratings and integrated devices. The threshold currents of the lasers are less than 10 mA and the side mode suppression ratios (SMSR) are better than 40 dB for all channels. Quasi-continuous tuning is realized over 7.5 nm wavelength region with the 30 Â°C temperature variation. The results indicate that the integration device we proposed can be used in wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM-PON).\n\nMonolithic dual-mode distributed feedback semiconductor laser for tunable continuous-wave terahertz generation.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Namje; Shin, Jaeheon; Sim, Eundeok; Lee, Chul Wook; Yee, Dae-Su; Jeon, Min Yong; Jang, Yudong; Park, Kyung Hyun\n\n2009-08-03\n\nWe report on a monolithic dual-mode semiconductor laser operating in the 1550-nm range as a compact optical beat source for tunable continuous-wave (CW) terahertz (THz) generation. It consists of two distributed feedback (DFB) laser sections and one phase section between them. Each wavelength of the two modes can be independently tuned by adjusting currents in micro-heaters which are fabricated on the top of the each DFB section. The continuous tuning of the CW THz emission from Fe(+)-implanted InGaAs photomixers is successfully demonstrated using our dual-mode laser as the excitation source. The CW THz frequency is continuously tuned from 0.17 to 0.49 THz.\n\nPhase-shift, stimuli-responsive drug carriers for targeted delivery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOâNeill, Brian E; Rapoport, Natalya\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe intersection of particles and directed energy is a rich source of novel and useful technology that is only recently being realized for medicine. One of the most promising applications is directed drug delivery. This review focuses on phase-shift nanoparticles (that is, particles of submicron size) as well as micron-scale particles whose action depends on an external-energy triggered, first-order phase shift from a liquid to gas state of either the particle itself or of the surrounding medium. These particles have tremendous potential for actively disrupting their environment for altering transport properties and unloading drugs. This review covers in detail ultrasound and laser-activated phase-shift nano- and micro-particles and their use in drug delivery. Phase-shift based drug-delivery mechanisms and competing technologies are discussed.
