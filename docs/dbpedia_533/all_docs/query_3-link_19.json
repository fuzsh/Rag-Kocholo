        "text": "The wettability of rocks is of fundamental importance to the understanding of fluid transport within hydrocarbon reservoirs. Wettability is intimately tied to the zeta potential, which is determined by the electrostatic forces among the rock's mineral constituents. Extensive prior research has been conducted into the relationship between wettability and surface forces of shale samples that have been ground up and/or otherwise been altered. However, very little attention has been given to measuring the zeta potential of the surface of unbroken, intact shale samples. A new technique is explored in this paper that investigates the zeta potential of the actual surface of shale samples in one intact piece. The surface zeta potential of shales was found to be strongly determined by the mineral composition and the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the shale. Shales containing higher amounts of silicates (e.g. quartz, feldspar, and clays such as Illite and Smectite) tended to be water-wet and exhibit higher negative zeta potential values. Shales that contained higher amounts of carbonates (dolomite, aragonite, calcite, etc.) were more oil-wet with zeta potential values that were less negative or slightly positive. Measurements were also performed on Berea and Boise sandstone in order to compare organic vs. inorganic samples. Results for common shales showed Mancos and Marcellus to be intermediate-wet, Oxford and Eagleford to be moderately oil-wet, and Arne to be highly water-wet. Additionally, the zeta potential was also studied in various ionic and nano-particle solutions.\n\nZeta potential is known as the electrical potential at the shear plane and is one of the important electro-osmotic properties of clay minerals. For many applications, the sign and the magnitude of the zeta potential is necessary to be known. For clay soils, it is usually negative. In present study, zeta potential of kaolinite clay immersed in various electrolytes namely; CaCl2, Al2(SO4)3, H3PO4, Na2Sio3, and Na2Co3 at different electrolyte concentration is investigated. As a result, the pH strongly altered the zeta potential of kaolinite. Also, zeta potential and specific conductivity have ranged from -86 to +204mV and 1450 to 15900μs/cm, respectively, at pH 2 to 9.3. In addition, pure kaolinite yields in an isoelectric point (IEP) at pH ~ 3.15.Although, there was no IEP for particles suspended in CaCl2 solution, a shift in IEP towards alkaline part observed when kaolinite particles immersed in Al2(SO4)3 as well as H3PO4 solution.\n\nStreaming potential in rocks is the electrical potential developing when an ionic fluid flows through the pores of rocks. The zeta potential is a key parameter of streaming potential and it depends on many parameters such as the mineral composition of rocks, fluid properties, temperature etc. Therefore, the zeta potential is different for various rocks and liquids. In this work, streaming potential measurements are performed for five rock samples saturated with six different monovalent electrolytes. From streaming potential coefficients, the zeta potential is deduced. The experimental results are then explained by a theoretical model. From the model, the surface site density for different rocks and the binding constant for different cations are found and they are in good agreement with those reported in literature. The result also shows that (1) the surface site density of Bentheim sandstone mostly composed of silica is the largest of five rock samples; (2) the binding constant is almost the same for a given cation but it increases in the order K Me (Na +) < K Me (K +) < K Me (Cs +) for a given rock.\n\nField and laboratory studies were carried out with the aim of characterizing the depositional environment and oxidation conditions during accumulation of shales in the Mamfe basin. Field studies denoted that the shales were black to dark grey in color, sub-tabular to tabular in occurrence, with some (n = 20) reacting vigorously with dilute HCl, while others did not (n = 5). Due to the carbonate content of the samples both whole rock dissolution and partial dissolution, using dilute acetic acid to target the carbonate fraction in the samples, were employed. The seven shale-rich units investigated have average whole rock Ni/Co, V/Cr, U/Th and Th/U ratios of 1.68–2.0, 1.13–2.95, 0.24–0.51 and > 2, respectively. PAAS normalized rare earth elements in the whole rock samples display an enrichment of light rare earth elements (LREEs) over heavy rare earth elements (HREEs), middle rare earth elements (MREEs) over HREEs, positive Gd, Eu anomalies, no Ce anomalies, and an average Y/Ho ratio of 29.7 ppm. The carbonate fraction of the samples displays two different REE pattern types. Sites 1 and 6 have typical hat-shaped patterns with extensive MREE enrichment. The other locations are slightly HREE depleted and have weak MREE enrichment with negative Y anomalies. The trace element ratios and the REE patterns of the whole rock and carbonate fractions indicate that the sediments deposited in the Mamfe basin accumulated in non-marine environments. Furthermore, their coloration, MREE enrichment and lack of Ce anomalies in the carbonate fractions infers that the depositional area was in a vegetated, low-land lacustrine setting with limited oxygenation of the sediment, whereas the negative Ce anomalies in the whole rock shale samples is probably due to particulate scavenging of REEs from the fluid during transport. This would require the water to be deficient in Ce and, thus reflect oxidizing conditions in the source area and along the transport system.\n\nAn understanding of clay mineral surface chemistry is becoming critical as deeper levels of control of reservoir rock wettability via fluid–solid interactions are sought. Reservoir rock is composed of many minerals that contact the crude oil and control the wetting state of the rock. Clay minerals are one of the minerals present in reservoir rock, with a high surface area and cation exchange capacity. This is a first-of-its-kind study that presents zeta potential measurements and insights into the surface charge development process of clay minerals (chlorite, illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite) in a native reservoir environment. Presented in this study as well is the effect of fluid salinity, composition, and oilfield operations on clay mineral surface charge development. Experimental results show that the surface charge of clay minerals is controlled by electrostatic and electrophilic interactions as well as the electrical double layer. Results from this study showed that clay minerals are negatively charged in formation brines as well as in deionized water, except in the case of chlorite, which is positively charged in formation water. In addition, a negative surface charge results from oilfield operations, except for operations at a high alkaline pH range of 10–13. Furthermore, a reduction in the concentrations of Na, Mg, Ca, and bicarbonate ions does not reverse the surface charge of the clay minerals; however, an increase in sulfate ion concentration does. Established in this study as well, is a good correlation between the zeta potential value of the clay minerals and contact angle, as an increase in fluid salinity results in a reduction of the negative charge magnitude and an increase in contact angle from 63 to 102 degree in the case of chlorite. Lastly, findings from this study provide vital information that would enhance the understanding of the role of clay minerals in the improvement of oil recovery.\n\nThe reservoir rock is made up of different minerals and its surface chemistry is influenced by the reservoir environment. Well operations implemented during the life of a field induce changes in the reservoir environment (pH) that affect the minerals, resulting in a change of their surface chemistry. These changes result in wettability alterations, which have a significant effect on the overall production. Thus, this research provides insight into the behavior of calcite, feldspar, barite, dolomite, quartz, and sand in varying pH environments to ascertain the effect of pH change on mineral surface charge. This study employed ζ-potential measurements as a measure of the wettability alteration. The findings reveal that these rock minerals have their charge development controlled by mineral dissolution, ionic specie adsorption, and double-layer compression. Furthermore, the rock contacting mineral is critical in the wettability alteration, and an understanding of the effect of well operations on rock surface chemistry is critical."
