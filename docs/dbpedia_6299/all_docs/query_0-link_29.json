        "text": "Something that annoys me about British, European and Australian (PAL) DVD releases of US films and TV shows would be that they are almost always sped up by 4% compared to how they are on the US (NTSC) equivelant releases. This I believe is down to the differences in frame rate - NTSC is 30fps while PAL is 25fps. A lot of American films and TV shows were produced at 24fps, though, and for the NTSC releases the codec will typically store 24fps and the DVD player will then use a pulldown technique to interlace the picture for display at 30fps in its original speed, which can make playback a little jerky but all of the original frames will be there without interlacing if you pause and manually scan through each frame. On a PAL release, content produced at 24fps will generally be sped up by 4%, meaning an additional frame for each second, and while this can marginally improve the smoothness of a video compared to a pulldown-based NTSC video, it can often make everything seem a little too fast and high pitched compared to how it's meant to be - I'm pretty good at noticing these things. Music often suffers, especially since it sometimes won't be pitch corrected on PAL releases, and it will sound very off if you're familiar with a song. PAL conversions of NTSC music videos will generally be at the correct speed but are interlaced, and tend to look in a lot of ways like an NTSC pulldown feed (slightly jerky) except that the interlacing will be hard encoded rather than carried out by the DVD player. I would rather watch something that is slightly jerky but at the correct speed than something that is slightly smoother looking but plays noticeably fast.\n\nI tend to buy NTSC/Region 1 copies of old DVD releases of American content that aren't available on Blu-Ray, subject to availability where I live, because they are at the correct speed unlike the PAL/Region 2/4 release. In a couple of cases I've managed to find low price used copies of DVDs from American sellers who ship for a minimal price to the UK.\n\nThe 4% speedup doesn't impact any of my UK Blu-Ray disc releases of American content, though. Most of them seem to be region free, play at 24fps (30fps for certain bonus features) and even contain all of the American targeted content that is on their American release, such as copyright warnings mentioning the FBI and references to the ratings used by the Motion Picture Association of America, with the only difference between the British and American release usually being the packaging. American owned streaming services will also typically show content at the correct speed/frame rate.\n\nIt looks like that Blu Ray set was only released in 2014. All of the UK Blu-Ray releases I have of American content are at their correct speed, usually 24fps with standard definition special features running at 30fps using an NTSC-style pulldown. It looks like The Avengers was a British series, though. I'd have thought that if British producers were shooting something on film that was intended for TV rather than cinema that they'd have shot onto film at 25fps - was this commonly the case or not? It could have certainly been achieved. Most old BBC shows from the 1970s feel as though they're at the right speed however I believe the BBC generally favoured recording onto magnetic tape during the 1970s/1980s instead of film, and PAL magnetic tape almost certainly did record at 25fps.\n\nIf you watch an American show or film in the UK on a US based streaming service such as Amazon Prime Video, Netflix or Disney+, it will almost always be at its original NTSC/60hz speed, however the same shows/films when available on British based catchup services will typically be in their sped-up PAL/50hz form. I'm sure that Britain's TV channels could aquire an original 24/60fps copy to use on their catchup services and then perform the PAL conversion in-house to put out on the live channel (Britain's TV stations still use 50hz, or 25fps)."
