Any suggestions? I noticed a thread on this forum that said the DVDO iScan VP50 can do it but that was from 2006. I can't seem to find any recent forum posts about a device that will convert 576p to 576i.\n\nI'm recording old shows that are NOT available on DVD/Bluray such as standup comedy shows. I'm using an Elgato Game Capture HD. It records 1080i perfectly. However the Sky box only outputs 576p via HDMI which gives a juddery framerate. So at the moment I can only get 576i via SCART. I use a high quality fully pinned SCART cable connected to a RGB SCART to S-Video converter box. The S-video goes into the Elgato. For some reason the Elgato adds about 20 pixels of side borders to the left and right of the picture and adds flicker to the top 8 pixels and bottom 4 pixels. I can correct all these problems when re-encoding with Avisynth & cleanup filters but I'd like to avoid the problems in the first place by recording 576i via HDMI as HDMI gives a perfect picture.\n\nLast edited: Feb 22, 2016\n\nShanePJ\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nJun 20, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n8,780\n\nSolutions\n\n4\n\nReaction score\n\n3,199\n\nPoints\n\n1,806\n\nLocation\n\nAV.com, Unit 4 The Sidings, Bacup, Lancs, OL13 9RW\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#2\n\nThere could also be a VP30 edition to.

If you press the info button on your TV remote it should say the picture is 576p. Could you please connect each of your processors to your Sky box via HDMI and set the resolution on the processor to 576i. Does your TV now say it's outputting 576i?\n\nStridsvognen\n\nEx Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 29, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n5,364\n\nReaction score\n\n1,739\n\nPoints\n\n926\n\nLocation\n\nDenmark\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#5\n\nI dont have a sky box, but i can take a DVD player and feed the scaler 576P and output 576i to my oppo 103D and checkthe format, or use the Lumagen radiance, but if the DVDO vp50 say its 576 out, its 576i out, i dont doubt much about that, and that will be with standard timings.\n\nThe judder your talking about sounds like you have the framerate converted somewhere, is it possible you are running 576P 60hz.? I know tv productions can be a huge mess of framerates, so its important to know the native framerate, wich might be 24, 25 30 50 or 60hz for PAL formats ill guess they stick to 25 and 50hz\n\nDaveyMames\n\nNovice Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 7, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n25\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n7\n\nAge\n\n41\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#6\n\nThe Sky box juddery framerate happens because it's converting 576i 25fps to 576p 25fps instead of doubling the frame rate.\n\nDoes your DVD player only output 576p 25fps via HDMI? If so then do you have any video you can play on it that was NOT shot on film and is 576i? You should then be able to see the unsmooth framerate if your DVD player is playing it in 576p 25fps. Can you then try using your DVDO vp50 to output 576i from your DVD player. Does it play smoothly? If so then it sounds like the DVDO vp50 is doing what I want it to do.\n\nLast edited: Feb 22, 2016\n\nStridsvognen\n\nEx Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 29, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n5,364\n\nReaction score\n\n1,739\n\nPoints\n\n926\n\nLocation\n\nDenmark\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#7\n\nI can only output 576P 50hz HDMI from dvd player.\n\nI dont understand why deinterlacing should add judder, frame doubling should not change that, it normaly only happens if you have a odd framerate convertion.\n\nIs it possible that your monitor cant display 25hz, and converts it to something else, what monitor are you using.?\n\nDaveyMames\n\nNovice Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 7, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n25\n\nReaction score\n\n0\n\nPoints\n\n7\n\nAge\n\n41\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#8\n\nI dont understand why deinterlacing should add judder, frame doubling should not change that, it normaly only happens if you have a odd framerate convertion.\n\nYes but if you look at what I said, the Sky box is NOT frame doubling. So it's not converting 25fps to 50fps. It's just converting the 576i 25fps picture to 576p 25fps which means the framerate is no longer smooth as you lose half the temporal resolution. I have my Sky box connected to my TV not a monitor.\n\nYou said your DVD player can only output 576p 50hz. That just means it's PAL. I'm assuming it's 576p 25fps? If so then that's good so we can see if your DVDO VP50 is able to give a 576i signal from your player, can you please try what I said in post 6.\n\nStridsvognen\n\nEx Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 29, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n5,364\n\nReaction score\n\n1,739\n\nPoints\n\n926\n\nLocation\n\nDenmark\n\nFeb 22, 2016\n\n#9\n\npal dvd has always ben 50hz, so i can only output 576P 50hz, there is no 25hz disc media i know about., its a broadcast format.

I said 576i 25fps meaning frames per second which is the same as 50i (50 fields per second). 576i doesn't have 50 frames per second, it has 25 frames per second. Converting from interlaced to progressive does NOT give you half the framerate, it gives you the same frame rate but you lose half the temporal resolution (you lose half the motion) which causes the framerate to look unsmooth.\n\nIf you want a smooth framerate you have to double the frame rate from 25 fps to 50fps.\n\njfinnie\n\nDistinguished Member\n\nJoined\n\nOct 1, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n5,767\n\nReaction score\n\n2,762\n\nPoints\n\n1,434\n\nLocation\n\nNorwich\n\nFeb 23, 2016\n\n#19\n\nI don't think what you want to do is entirely possible from an HD box. You can't guarantee what the Sky box has done to the signal to turn it into 576P (bob/weave/motion adaptive), so you won't always be able to get back to the exact interlaced fields. Anything you do will be the best guess of a scaler re-interlacing. DVDO Iscan Duo has PreP which attempts to revert the progressive image to its interlaced fields intelligently for reprocessing (undoing sub-optimal deinterlacing, supposedly), but these kind of things can never be perfect.\n\n\"Back in the day\" the best option was to have a modified Sky box with an SDI digital output, and capture off that. But I guess your issue is that the content is already recorded onto the HD box?\n\nIf you are able to re-record your content, an SDI Sky box with SDI capture card would be the best option for accuracy. Not cheap, mind.\n\nSky+ with SDI\n\nSweetSpot SDI"
