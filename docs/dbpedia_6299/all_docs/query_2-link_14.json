This stops the Mod Launcher and the hack from getting resolutions from your graphics card.\n\n1.12\n\nMade it respect any resolution specified in simpsons.ini when the game is running in a Window.\n\nMade 1024x768, 1152x864, 1280x1024, and 1600x1200 not listed unless they're supported by your graphics card.\n\n1.10\n\nAdded this hack."
