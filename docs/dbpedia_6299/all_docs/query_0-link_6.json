Is this common.\n\nThanks\n\nDarryl\n\nStevieBuck\n\nProminent Member\n\nJoined\n\nJul 7, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n3,729\n\nReaction score\n\n673\n\nPoints\n\n694\n\nLocation\n\nAberdeen\n\nMay 31, 2009\n\n#2\n\nI don't have that problem when switching between channels, but I don't have the HDMI connection going through the amp - just an optical cable for audio.\n\nYes, borders are added to the left & right side of the image to prevent you from watching the programme with the incorrect aspect ratio. Your TV will probably be fixed on \"wide\" mode when inputting an HD signal/resolution. If you are desparate to get the image to fill the screen, change the video output resolution on the Sky box to 576i - then your TV should allow you to change the viewing format.\n\nTrollslayer\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 11, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n41,201\n\nReaction score\n\n25,718\n\nPoints\n\n9,988\n\nLocation\n\nPoole\n\nMay 31, 2009\n\n#3\n\nFirst, I have an Onkyo 606 with my Sky+HD and Panasonic plasma.\n\nThe only time I have had a click on channel change is when a couple of channels weren't being broadcast correctly. There is a short dip in audio after chaning channel because I have the picture resolution set to automatic so the HDMI output changes when the resoluttion changes. See if this still happens on two channels with the same resolution.\n\nHDMI transmits the aspect ratio of the picture so the TV follows this. On the new EPG wich you have this cannot be overriden [I stand to be corrected but can't find the opption].\n\nThe last one about picture breakup, I've never had that but I have an old Thomson box which suits me fine.\n\nTrollslayer\n\nOutstanding Member\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 11, 2007\n\nMessages\n\n41,201\n\nReaction score\n\n25,718\n\nPoints\n\n9,988\n\nLocation\n\nPoole\n\nMay 31, 2009\n\n#4\n\nI don't have that problem when switching between channels, but I don't have the HDMI connection going through the amp - just an optical cable for audio.\n\nYes, borders are added to the left & right side of the image to prevent you from watching the programme with the incorrect aspect ratio.
