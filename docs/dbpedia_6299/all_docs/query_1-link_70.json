        "text": "Among the common video resolutions, you would have heard of are 1080p, 1080i, 720p, and even 480p.\n\nWhat about 576i resolution? What video resolution is this and where is it used?\n\nTo understand 576i, let’s take a look at analog TV and video standards.\n\nAs you would already know, there are two main analog TV broadcast systems. PAL is used in Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central America. NTSC is used in North America and Japan, among others.\n\nThe two broadcast system has similarities. Firstly they have the same aspect ratio – 4 :3. Secondly, they use interlaced scanning.\n\nThey differ when it comes to the number of lines in a single frame and frame rate (how many frames are displayed per second).\n\n576i Digital Version of PAL\n\n576i is the digital version of the PAL analog signal. In digital terms, it’s called an SD (Standard Definition) signal.\n\n576i resolution in pixels\n\nThe pixel count for 576i is 720 x 576.\n\nThis PAL standard is set by the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers (SMPTE),\n\nSMPTE-259-B defines a PAL signal as one that has 576 active interlaced lines.\n\nWhat is 576i resolution?\n\nAs explained above 576i offers 576 lines of vertical resolution and up to a maximum of 720 lines of horizontal resolution (720 x 576).\n\nIn NTSC broadcast system countries like the USA, this is referred to as 480i (720 x 480).\n\nWhat this means is there are 576 active scan lines per interlaced frame.\n\nThe frame rate is set at 25Hz to be compatible with the timing of PAL.\n\n576i is often referred to as 576i/25. In other words, it’s 576 lines high and interlaced at 25fps.\n\nPopularly, however, it is referred to as 576i/50, 50 being the field rate. The field rate tallies that of the electrical frequency of the country. There are two fields for every interlaced frame.\n\nMost of the time the frame rate 576i/25 and the field rate 576i/50 aren’t indicated and are written as 576i.\n\nNow that you have an understanding of 576i, let’s compare it with some popular video resolutions.\n\n576i vs 576p\n\n576p has 576 vertical lines in progressive mode. The horizontal lines range from 768 or 1024, depending on the video aspect ratio. It is a standard definition video standard for PAL TV broadcast.\n\nStandard 576p is known as 576p/25. That’s 576p at 25 frames per second.\n\n576p/50 has a frame rate of 50. It is the resolution of EDTV or Enhanced-Definition TV. In certain countries like Australia, it is categorized as HD resolution.\n\nAt least two Australian TV stations had used 576p before switching to 1080i.\n\n576i vs 480i\n\nThe pixel count for NTSC is 720 x 480 also known as 480i a standard set by the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineers.\n\nSMPTE-259-A refers to an NTSC signal as one that has 480 active interlaced lines.\n\nThis digital version of NTSC is written as 480i/60, which means it has 480 vertical lines with a field rate of 60.\n\n576i vs 480p\n\n480p is a standard-definition video with a pixel count of 640 x 480 with an aspect ratio of 4:3. This is a minimum of 640 horizontal lines and 480 vertical lines in progressive mode as opposed to the NTSC TV format of 480 interlaced lines in vertical mode (480i).\n\nThere are various 480p resolutions with the horizontal resolution changing with the vertical resolution remaining fixed. The horizontal resolution changes for different aspect ratios.\n\nYou would have come across a YouTube video with 480p resolution which has a pixel count of 854×480.\n\n576i vs 720p\n\n720p has a pixel count of 1280 x 720. It is often referred to as standard HD or in TVs as HD ready. It has an aspect ratio of 16: 9 as opposed to 576i’s 4: 3.\n\nLearn more about 720p video.\n\n576i vs 1080i\n\n1080i’s pixel count is 1920 x 540. This is interlaced video with 1920 horizontal lines and 540 vertical pixels.\n\nThis is the preferred HD broadcast format in many countries. When you see an HD watermark on any TV program, it is either broadcast in 1080i or 720p.\n\nRead more about 1080i.\n\n576i vs 1080p\n\n1080p is known as Full HD. It has a pixel count of 1920 x 1080 in progressive mode.\n\nIt gives you a total of 2,073,600 pixels on your TV screen. 1080p is also the resolution of standard Blu-ray."
