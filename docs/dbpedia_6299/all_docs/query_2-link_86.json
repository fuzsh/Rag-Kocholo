        "text": "Xenia Canary Game Patches\n\nThis repository contains game patches for Xenia Canary.\n\nNon-patch questions belong on the Xenia Discord server.\n\nThese are NOT actual games or Title Updates!\n\nRead Xenia's Quickstart to get games.\n\nInstalling/Updating\n\nPrerequisites\n\nLatest Xenia Canary experimental.\n\nPatches aren't supported on master or outdated versions of Xenia Canary.\n\nDownload this zip.\n\nGo to where xenia_canary.exe is.\n\nDelete patches folder if present (backup if needed).\n\nOpen game-patches.zip and extract patches in the same directory as xenia_canary.exe. The folder structure should look like this:\n\n└─── Xenia Canary | ... │ xenia_canary.exe | ... └─── patches ... 584111F7 - Minecraft (XBLA, TU0).patch.toml ...\n\nContinue to the section below.\n\nHow to use\n\nPrerequisites\n\nLatest Xenia Canary experimental\n\nPatches aren't supported on master or outdated versions of Xenia Canary.\n\nThe right version of the game e.g. Title Update (TU).\n\napply_patches set to true (default) in the Xenia Canary config.\n\nOpen the .patch.toml file that corresponds to your game in a text editor (Notepad, VSCode, VSCodium, Notepad++, etc.)\n\nChange is_enabled from false to true. For example, to enable a 60 FPS patch:\n\n[[patch]] name = \"60 FPS\" desc = \"Description\" author = \"Author\" is_enabled = false [[patch.be8]] address = 0x######## value = 0x##\n\nbecomes\n\n[[patch]] name = \"60 FPS\" desc = \"Description\" author = \"Author\" is_enabled = true [[patch.be8]] address = 0x######## value = 0x##\n\nIf you see [Patches Applied] in the title bar then the patch(es) applied successfully.\n\nDon't change the hash of existing patches. If your version of the game is different then the patch(es) need to be ported to that version.\n\nNotes about aspect ratio patches\n\npresent_letterbox must be changed from true to false!\n\nAspect ratio patches do not increase resolution!\n\nWhile most aspect ratio patches are 21:9 (3440/1440), they can be changed to other aspect ratios as well unless not specified or specified otherwise;\n\nDivide your monitor's resolution width by height (i.e. 3440/1440)\n\nConvert the result to hex.\n\nChange the value to 0x######## replacing ######## with the hex value.\n\nNote about framerate patches\n\nFramerates above 60 FPS require vsync to be changed from true to false in the Xenia Canary config.\n\nSetting up Cheat Engine\n\nMemory Breakpoints can be set in Cheat Engine or MSVC with emit_source_annotations = true. This will give annotations in disassembly.\n\nCheat Engine 7.2+ includes Big Endian types, but they must be enabled;\n\nClick Edit > Options > Extra Custom Types and check all of them.\n\nGo to Scan Settings and enable MEM_MAPPED.\n\nChange 'Memory Scan Options' to:\n\nAll Start 100000000 Stop 200000000\n\nThis may change depending on the programs you have running.\n\nOnce you find a value you can attach Cheat Engine's debugger to see what reads/writes to that address.\n\nThis will show an xex address when a breakpoint is hit, although there is currently no way to set a breakpoint on execution within the Xenia Debugger.\n\nCreating a patch\n\nCheat Engine\n\nSee setting up Cheat Engine\n\nGhidra\n\nXEX Loader\n\nIDA Pro\n\nIDA 7 XEX Loader\n\nIDA 6 XEX Loader\n\nText editors:\n\nVisual Studio Code\n\nVSCodium\n\nNotepad++\n\nRecommended but optional:\n\nESLint TOML plugin\n\nSee Editor Integrations\n\nVisual Studio Code/VSCodium extensions:\n\nEven Better TOML\n\nTo make things easier, put Xenia Canary in the directory that contains /patches and run it with portable.txt.\n\nPatch must be named Title ID - Game Title.patch.toml and be in /patches.\n\nFor example, a patch file for Blue Dragon must be called 4D5307DF - Blue Dragon.patch.toml.\n\nIf you are making a patch for a game that already has a file, then add to it*\n\nOnly exception being if you're patching a different module.\n\nSubmitting patches:\n\nNo whitespace.\n\nLowercase hex for address/value hex, uppercase for title ID/hash/media ID.\n\nHow to get the module hash and filename:\n\nDon't change the hash of existing patches. If your version of the game is different then the patch(es) need to be ported to that version.\n\nSet log_level to at least 2 (default) in the Xenia Canary config; See How to use for location.\n\nRun the game at least once.\n\nClose Xenia Canary.\n\nObtain module hash/title ID/title name;\n\nSearch Ctrl+F for Module hash: in xenia.log\n\nYou should see something like:\n\ni> ######## Module \\Device\\Cdrom0\\default.xex: Module Hash: ################\n\nPatches can have multiple executables/hashes. Only leave the hash(es) you're using uncommented:\n\nhash = [ \"7C5F016EA6A81E95\" # default.xex # \"2330F2A205951B81\" # AO3MPGame-XeReleaseLTCG.xex ]\n\nPatch types\n\n[[patch.*]] Info Value (example) be8 Hex, 1 byte 0x00 be16 Hex, 2 bytes 0x0000 be32 Hex, 4 bytes 0x00000000 be64 Hex, 8 bytes 0x0000000000000000 array Hex, any size \"0x##*\" f32 Float, single 1.0 f64 Float, double 1.0 string String, UTF-8 \"string\" u16string String, UTF-16 \"string\"\n\nExample patch\n\ntitle_name = \"Game Title\" title_id = \"1234ABCD\" # AB-1234 hash = \"################\" # Module the hash applies to (i.e. default.xex) # Can be an array if applicable: hash = [ \"################\" # See above ] #media_id = \"1234ABCD\" # Optionally you can add a redump link; Disc (Region): http://redump.org/disc/1234 # Can also be an array if applicable: #media_id = [ # \"1234ABCD\" # See above #] # Title ID, hash, and media ID must be uppercase. [[patch]] name = \"Patch name\" author = \"Me\" desc = \"Patch description\" # Description is optional is_enabled = false # Must be false for PRs # [[patch.*]] # For example, be8: [[patch.be8]] address = 0x82000000 # Tends to start with 0x8, always 4 bytes value = 0x00 # Address and value hex must be lowercase. # string: [[patch.string]] address = 0x82000000 # Tends to start with 0x8, always 4 bytes value = \"string\" # End of file newline"
