        "text": "VBA GX (Visual Boy Advance GX)GeneralAuthor(s)TantricContributor(s)Carl KennerTypeHandheld emulatorVersion2.4.8LinksDownloadDiscussionSourceDownloadable via the Homebrew BrowserDownloadable via the Open Shop ChannelPeripherals\n\nVBA GX (Visual Boy Advance GX) is a Game Boy Advance / Game Boy Color / Game Boy emulator for the Wii based on VBA-M. The GUI is powered by libwiigui.\n\nFeatures\n\nWiimote, Nunchuk, Classic, Wii U Pro, and GameCube controller support\n\nWii U GamePad support (requires homebrew injection into Wii U VC title)\n\nRotation sensors, Solar sensors, and Rumble support\n\nOptional special Wii controls built-in for some games\n\nEditable 14-colour palettes for monochrome Gameboy games\n\nSRAM and State saving\n\nIPS/UPS patch support\n\nCustom controller configurations\n\nSD, USB, DVD, SMB, Zip, and 7z support\n\nCompatiblity based on VBA-M r1231\n\nMEM2 ROM Storage for fast access\n\nAuto frame skip (optional) for those core heavy games\n\nTurbo speed, video zooming, widescreen, and unfiltered video options\n\nNative loading/saving of ROMS and SRAM from Goomba (a GB emulator for GBA)\n\nImproved video rendering from RetroArch\n\nScreenshots can be displayed on the main menu\n\nFixed pixel ratio mode (1x, 2x, and 3x)\n\nBorders (from Super Game Boy games or custom from .png)\n\n240p support\n\nOpen Source!\n\nNotes from the Developer\n\nSpeed could still use some improvement. If anyone can make the code more efficient, knows PPC assembly, or can make it faster in any way, let me know.\n\nInstallation\n\nIf you are using the Homebrew Channel just copy the apps directory from the archive to the root of your SD card. If you are using another loader use the executables/vbagx_wii.dol.\n\nROMs & saves files should be stored in /vbagx/roms and /vbagx/saves on the root of your SD card or USB flash drive. You can copy the vbagx directory from the archive to your support drive. Your ROMs must be in \".gb\", \".gbc\" or \".gba\" format. To be clear, there will be 2 \"vbagx\" folders. One in your apps folder, and one on the SD root.\n\nLaunch the emulator using your Loader.\n\nWii Channel\n\nwilsoff and MrNick666 were gracious enough to create an official Wii Channel. You can find it on the Downloads page.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nYou must have IOS58 to use this channel. Either upgrade to System Menu 4.3, or use the IOS58 Installer.\n\nYou must have Homebrew Channel 1.0.8+ running on IOS58 to run the installer. If HBC is not using IOS58, reinstall it.\n\nThis channel tries load /apps/vbagx/boot.dol from SD or USB. You must have Visual Boy Advance GX installed in one of these locations.\n\nInstallation\n\nCopy the installer files to your SD/USB device\n\nLaunch the installer from HBC\n\nClick Install\n\nDone!\n\nLoading Games\n\nFrom DVD\n\nROMs can be burned to a DVD-/+R (4.7GB max size & ISO 9660 file format).\n\nFrom Network (using SMB)\n\nUsing the emulator via network requires that your Wii is configured for your wireless network, and that you've set up a file share. You must provide a username, password, share name, and IP address to log in to the file server (in settings.xml). This XML file is created for you upon first loading the emulator and entering/exiting Preferences. Here's an example snippet for your XML configuration file:\n\n<section name=\"Network\" description=\"Network Settings\"> <setting name=\"smbip\" value=\"192.168.4.19\" description=\"Share Computer IP\" /> <setting name=\"smbshare\" value=\"wiifiles\" description=\"Share Name\" /> <setting name=\"smbuser\" value=\"yourusername\" description=\"Share Username\" /> <setting name=\"smbpwd\" value=\"yourpassword\" description=\"Share Password\" /> </section>\n\nAlso be sure to mirror the required directory structure within your share folder, or change the LoadFolder and SaveFolder values in the XML file. See the tinysmb page for additional information and troubleshooting.\n\nLanguage Patches (IPS/UPS)\n\nIPS files must be placed in the same folder as the ROM you are loading, and named identically to the ROM name, except with a IPS extension. They will be loaded automatically upon loading the game.\n\nPatches can be used to colourise a monochrome gameboy game, or to translate a game into your language, or to stop the game from needing special hardware. Search the internet for patches. Many games have been translated by fans. They can be in IPS or UPS format. You don't need to patch anything yourself. Just put the IPS or UPS file in the /vbagx/roms folder along with the rom itself. The patch must have the same name as the rom. Patches can not be put inside the ZIP file. If a rom is zipped, you might need to check inside the zip for the actual rom filename.\n\nYou must not use patched versions of Boktai roms! (Except for the translation patch for Boktai 3, which is highly recommended). The patches are for old emulators that don't support the solar sensor. VBA GX and NO$GBA support the solar sensor natively, and the patch will stop them from working.\n\nYou must also not use patched versions of WarioWare Twisted, Kirby's Tilt n Tumble, or Yoshi's Universal Gravitation (Topsy Turvy). The original roms are fully supported, and the patch will stop them from working.\n\nEditing Palettes\n\nGames for Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Color, and Super Gameboy, are already in colour, and changing palettes for these games will have no effect. Unfortunately, some Super Gameboy games are programmed in greyscale and that can't be changed yet.\n\nMonochrome games for the original Gameboy had four shades of grey. But with VBA-Wii you can define your own colour palettes for these games.\n\nVBA Wii comes with palettes for these games: Alleyway, Baseball, Duck Tales, Kid Icarus, Magnetic Soccer, Malibu Beach Volleyball, Marble Madness, Metroid 2 (not DX), Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat 3, Mr. Do!, The Simpsons: Bart and the Beanstalk, Super Mario Land, Tennis, Tetris, and TMNT: Fall of the Foot Clan\n\nOther games will use a default palette of green background, white status bar, red sprites and blue sprites. This palette makes palette editing easier, but isn't all that suitable for most games. You should usually either edit the palette for these games, or switch to black and white mode. Or you can edit the default palette by manually editing the \"sd:\\apps\\vbagx\\palette.xml\" file.\n\nTo switch between black and white and palette mode, start a game, go to the HOME menu, choose \"Game Settings\", choose \"Video\", and click on \"Colorize Mono GB\". The game \"Megaman 1\" will always be in black and white, to prevent flashing.\n\nTo edit the palette for the current game, go to the HOME menu, choose \"Game Settings\", choose \"Video\", and click on \"Choose Palette\" to go to the Palette Editor.\n\nAfter editing the palette, the palette might appear screwed up in the game until the game changes palettes. To fix that, you might need to save the game and then start the game again, or you might need to press start to pause or go to the menu, then press start again, or you might need to try moving your sprite to the far left side of the screen.\n\nPalette Editor\n\nThe colours are divided into 4 columns, which are arranged by brightness.\n\nThe first column is the background. The bottom \"background\" colour is used for both the background tiles, and also for parts of the screen not covered by background tiles or any sprites. Sometimes the background can go in front of some sprites, and in those cases the bottom background colour is transparent.\n\nThe second column is the \"window\". Usually that means the status bar and HUD, but it's sometimes used for other things, for example in Mortal Kombat 1, the entire game screen except the status bar is the window. VBA Wii is the only Gameboy emulator that lets you change the window colours, in other emulators the window uses the background colours.\n\nThe third column, \"OBJ\", is for sprites that use palette 0. Sprites only have 3 colours, because one is always transparent. Games can choose which three of the four brightness levels will be used (that's why there are two sprite palettes). In the editor it's assumed that the first three brightness levels will be chosen. When the game chooses different brightness levels, some of those colours will be brightened or darkened in-game. Black is assumed to be 10% brightness, while dark grey is assumed to be 40% brightness. That means half the time, the colour you choose for OBJ 2 will appear 4 times darker in-game, so you might need to make it very bright. Other colours also will appear at different brightnesses, but not by a factor of 4.\n\nThe fourth column \"SPR\", is for sprites that use palette 1. It has the same issues as specified above. VBA on other platforms uses the same colours for both palette 0 and palette 1, but VBA Wii lets you change them separately. Palette 1 is often used for some monsters, or for when your character takes damage, or for making collectible items flash.\n\nClicking on any colour will pop up a colour editor window. You change a colour by choosing how much red, green, and blue are mixed together. You can only go up or down 8 at a time. It is in hexadecimal, which means it goes up to F instead of up to 9. F means 15.\n\nred+green+blue = white\n\nred+green = yellow\n\ntwo parts red, one part green = orange\n\ndark orange is brown, especially if you mix in a bit of blue\n\nred+blue = magenta (pinkish purple)\n\ntwo parts blue, one part red = purple\n\ntwo parts red, one part blue = hot pink\n\ngreen+blue = cyan (bright blue/green)\n\ntwo parts blue, one part green = light blue\n\nTo make a colour paler, mix in a little bit of all the other colours\n\nClicking on the \"load / save\" button will save the palette changes. Unless you are worried about a power failure, this is unnecessary, since they are saved automatically when you close. This button will have more features in the next version.\n\nThe palette will be saved whenever you close the editor window.\n\nAs mentioned above, after editing the palette, the palette might appear screwed up in the game until the game changes palettes. To fix that, you might need to save the game and then start the game again, or you might need to press start to pause or go to the menu, then press start again, or you might need to try moving your sprite to the far left side of the screen.\n\npalette.xml\n\nOnce the emulator has created the palette.xml file (by playing a mono game), you can edit it manually to change the palettes. This might be quicker and easier than editing inside the emulator. It also lets you edit the default palette to something more suitable. And it lets you set some games to play in Black and White mode.\n\nYou can, and should, share your palette.xml with other users if you have made palettes for other games.\n\nGame names in the palette.xml file are based on the ROM's internal name, not the filename. That means you only have to set the palette once even if you have several files for different regions. It also means you can use other people's xml files without worrying what they named their ROMs. If you need to know the game's internal name, you can check in VBA-M on the PC, or some websites will tell you, or you can just start editing the palette in the emulator and then it will be added to the XML file for you.\n\nWhen \"use\" is set to \"1\" that means that game will be in palette mode. When \"use\" is set to \"0\", that means that game will always be in black and white mode.\n\nColours are specified in hexadecimal, in the format: 0xRRGGBB. FF is the brightest, 80 is half brightness, 00 is black. VBA-Wii only uses 15-bit colour, so the last digit will be rounded down to either 8 or 0. But if palette support is ported to other platforms, then they might not be rounded on those platforms.\n\nControls\n\nIn Menu\n\n+ Action / or / / / or or / or Move through the Menu / or / / / or / or Page up / page down Select menu item, change setting Swap between list box and buttons Exit (main menu), return to game (game menu)\n\nKeyboard and mouse don't work in the menu yet, only in-game.\n\nIn Game (by default)\n\nThe controls can be changed in \"Controller Configuration\" menu.\n\n+ Action or or or GBA DPad A B L R SELECT START Left Emulator menu Right + + Right Turbo Mode Up/Down Up/Down Zoom In/Out\n\nMatch Wii Controls\n\nSpecial Wii controls exist for many games.
