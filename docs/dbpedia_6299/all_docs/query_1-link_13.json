        "text": "HD from 480p (DVD) to 1080p (Full HD)\n\nWhat is HD ?\n\nThe actual PAL / SECAM resolution is 720 x 576 pixels, for 4/3 like 16/9. If the source outputs an interlaced picture a.k.a. half frames, we are talking about a resolution of 576i (i for interlaced), against 576p for a progressive signal, in full frames. At 576p its 415 Kpixels that will be displayed simultaneously. Half only: 207 Kpixels at 576i (interlaced).\n\nNTSC works with a bigger number of pictures per seconds, 30 instead of 25, but with a smaller resolution: 538 x 480 pixels in 4/3, 720 x 480 in 16/9. The 480p of movies include âat best/maxâ 346 Kpixels.\n\nJumping to HD is in fact nothing else than improving the picture definition. 4 HD modes already exist and you can get an overview of them through the following presentation like a movie trailer on Appleâs Site or demonstration movies on Microsoftâs Site.\n\n720i, 1280 x 720 pixels = 16/9 = 922 Kpixels. First HD resolution but still interlaced. By chance, this format should not be used frequently, the media will more likely be displayed using the next one:\n\n720p: still in 1280 x 720 pixels, 922 Kpixels, but full frames now! The pictureâs quality and movement is better, contrast and depth also. It is the main format for TV Channel in HD.\n\n1080i: Here we are leaving HD for a jump into full HD, with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels = 2 Mpixels. Itâs still an interlaced signal and picture quality compared to 720p is not necessary better. Professionalâs view on it say that movies are a bit better on 1080i than 720p, but games are better at 720p than 1080i. Anyway, the true HD, the one that everybody wants is the higher level, its:\n\n1080p: 1920 x 1080 pixels, 2 Mpixels in full frames. If your display and your source is compatible, it is the ultimate picture quality, what we call the âVisual Furyâ simply kicking ass.\n\nIf it goes, here is how it would look on a QuickTime HD movie trailer :\n\n(Here you can get an idea of the original picture and the definition improvement)\n\nHere are 3 screenshots without any resizing of the above pictures in 480p/720p/1080p\n\n[spaces:0][spaces:0]\n\n480p 720p 1080p\n\nThese screenshots do not represent the real quality that will be displayed.\n\nIn fact, those pictures will be processed and up-scaled or down-scaled in order to match different displays: big screen, small screen, projectorâ¦\n\n1080p a.k.a. FULL HD is the ultimate picture quality you can get from a HDMI source such as HD-DVD player, Blu-Ray player, Playstation 3, Xbox360 HDMI\n\nUsing a PS3, X360 Elite or Blu-Ray/HD-DVD player without using its true capacity would end to frustration.\n\nThe HD and Next Gen jump is only an improved picture quality through an improved definition.\n\nWithout its definition Blu-Ray/HD-DVD picture quality is in no way better than DVD\n\nWithout its definition PS3/X360 Elite games arenât really better than PS2/XBOX games.\n\nYou may think..\n\nâNo problem I have a display which can support 720p or 1080pâ.\n\nâI have no HD TV, but I can still hook up my PS3 to my RGB monitorâ\n\nIf thatâs your case, you just forgot a small detail, the name is HDCP.\n\nEven if your CRT monitor, LCD display, Plasma display, Projector is technically able to display 1280Ã720 or 1920Ã1080 picture resolution you wonât be able to display ANYTHING in such resolutions, BLACK SCREEN.\n\nIf you purchased a Playstation 3, X360 Elite, HD-DVD player, Blu-ray player, SAT&Cable HDTV channels set-top-box, you wonât be able to display anything in 720p or 1080p on your âoldâ display because itâs not HDCP compliant.\n\nYou have 3 choices:\n\nBuy a brand new TV/display/monitor which is HDMI/HDCP compliant\n\nUse your expensive Blu-ray/HD-DVD or PS3/X360 Elite with no real quality improvement compared to DVD or Previous generation gaming system.\n\nRead more and get a solution\n\nâHollywoodâs plans for Blu-Ray and HD-DVD (HDMI/HDCP) are an outrageous attack on your freedom. Business conspiracies to restrict technology should be illegal.â"
