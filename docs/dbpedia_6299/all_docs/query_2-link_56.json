We will be listing everything you need for Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok.\n\nThe importance of social media visuals is crucial for executing great socials!\n\nIn fact, a survey found that 80% of businesses rely heavily on visual content as part of their marketing strategy. The same is true across a range of industries from property marketing to charity and start ups.\n\nFacebook\n\nAs the world’s leading social media platform Facebook has 2.9B users, but it is becoming increasingly visual, to follow in the likes of TikTok and Instagram.\n\nAlthough it is still a ‘social’ platform business users are recommended to avoid going too commercial or product-driven with imagery. Instead, try to convey the personality of your brand by using visuals to display the human side.\n\nRecommended Facebook image sizes for 2024:\n\nFacebook profile picture size: 180 x 180\n\nFacebook cover photo size: 820 x 312\n\nFacebook group cover image size: 1640 x 856\n\nFacebook link image size: 1200 x 630\n\nFacebook image post size: 1200 x 630\n\nFacebook image ad size: 1200 x 628\n\nFacebook event image size: 1920 x 1005\n\nFacebook messenger image ad size: 1200 x 628\n\nFacebook Story ad size: 1080 x 1920\n\nFacebook Reels – 1080 × 1350 (ratio 4:5)\n\nFacebook video size: 1280 x 720\n\nLargest Facebook video length: 240 minutes\n\nFacebook video ad size: 1080 x 1350 (ratio 4:5), at least 1080 x 1080, ratios from 16:9 to 9:16 are also supported\n\nPro tip:\n\nThe attention span of the audience is extremely short on social media, so try to keep Facebook videos as short as possible. While the maximum video length is 240 minutes, Facebook recommends keeping them as short as 15 seconds.\n\nInstagram\n\nA visual platform from the start. Instagram is where you can really have fun with your inner designer. Instagram Stories and Reels are catching most of the attention lately, but you can still easily gain engagement with static imagery too.\n\nAlthough Instagram is known for its square images, landscape and portrait images are also available. Use the best of the three for your Instagram posts (square, landscape, and portrait). Using the correct social media dimensions will take you from amateur to professional. Choose the right one for your brand and compose your photos or videos accordingly.\n\nRecommended Instagram image sizes for 2024:\n\nInstagram profile picture size: 110 x 110\n\nInstagram photo sizes: 1080 x 1080 (square),\n\n1080 x 566 (landscape), 1080 x 1350 (portrait).\n\nInstagram Stories size: 1080 x 1920\n\nCarousel posts & ads: 1080 x 1080 (square) recommended,\n\n1080 x 566 (landscape) and 1080 x 1350 (portrait) are also supported.\n\nInstagram ads size: 1080 x 1080 (square), 1080 x 566 (landscape).\n\nRecommended Instagram video sizes: 1080 x 1080 (square),\n\n1080 x 566 (landscape), 1080 x 1350 (portrait).\n\nInstagram IGTV video size: 1080 x 1920\n\nInstagram Reels and Live: 1080 x 1920\n\nPro tip:\n\nWe recommend using square and vertical formats when posting on Facebook and Instagram (both organic and paid). Why? Because this maximizes the space you use in the feeds as most people use their phones to browse through these platforms.\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhile LinkedIn is known as the business platform it is vital that you show off your brands best side. An attractive LinkedIn profile (both company and employee) is an invaluable asset for your brand.\n\nAim for high-res, original photos, along with videos and infographics, while using the correct social media dimensions.
