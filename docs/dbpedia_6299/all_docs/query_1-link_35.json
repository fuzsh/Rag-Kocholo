I mean which one is better in terms of performance, quality, etc?\n\nHonestly doesn't make much difference on the Wii, they're both gonna look equally crap on a modern TV, plus, the Wii is new enough to not suffer from such issues older consoles suffered from in PAL regions, like games running slower (including audio pitch being lower and the audio slower as well) so there isn't any performance difference between the two and I never noticed any difference in image quality either.\n\nHowever, you should aim for 480p with component cables, it looks a lot better than composite.\n\nIf you want the best image quality emulation is the way to go. Most Wii games look great in HD, like they were made for it.\n\nHonestly doesn't make much difference on the Wii, they're both gonna look equally crap on a modern TV, plus, the Wii is new enough to not suffer from such issues older consoles suffered from in PAL regions, like games running slower (including audio pitch being lower and the audio slower as well) so there isn't any performance difference between the two and I never noticed any difference in image quality either.\n\nHowever, you should aim for 480p with component cables, it looks a lot better than composite.\n\nIf you want the best image quality emulation is the way to go.

Anyways I haven't heard any complaints about 3rd party ones.\n\nThey are? Wasn't aware.\n\nThe cheap PS2 component cables are a nightmare so that made me go legit.\n\nOn a CRT you couldn't notice much difference between PAL and NTSC resolution but on modern displays PAL looks slightly better, even with black borders. Also, the refresh rate is not so relevant anymore on LCDs. Regarding the speed, some games seem too fast for me and it's almost a \" hack \" to use the PAL version to slow it down a bit .\n\nThere are some CRT's that do both 50hz and 60hz.\n\nOn a truly old-fashioned set, the difference between PAL and NTSC (which are colour standards) can be more noticable than the difference between 50hz and 60hz (which are refresh rates - PAL60 and NTSC50 exist for a reason).\n\nBut a good 50hz game can look a little cleaner thanks to the higher display resolution - but the game's native resolution matters more. Does it use the framerate hit (from 30 or 60 to 25 or 50) to render more stuff per-frame?\n\nYeah NTSC used SMPTE-C and Pal used EBU colors. But I would say they are very close. Some differences but close.\n\nThe resolution difference isn't huge. A tad bit sharper but not a big difference."
