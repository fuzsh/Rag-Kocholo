        "text": "The scatterbox nature of if something is available to stream, and finding where, is honestly a pain in the arse alot of the time now, because where you expect to find it, isn't always the case. Some things aren't available at all to stream and while i enjoy the convenience of it, and lets be honest, the space it saves on Disc boxes ect, the quality difference can be quite stark.\n\nIve never been able to find the Bottom Live shows on streaming anywhere, so not having my DVD's would mean i never saw/see it.\n\nNewer stuff can and does move around all over the place, from one service to another, and suddenly its gone entirely with no word on if its coming back or where its off to next.\n\nThe advent of streaming was a fantastic idea, and then the corporations got involved and as usual, screwed it up for everyone meaning you're back to chasing that DVD in that speciality shop or hoping you can find a seller and import it from somewhere. And then they got into cutting quality, to save that little bit of bandwidth they didn't have to send out and crippled the audio too, making it just generally, quite shit!\n\nAm I the only person on here who thinks that streaming is a kick in the face? With regards to British classic comedies not all of them are even available to stream, even anywhere on ITV X which used to be a part of Britbox.\n\nWhen streaming a programme that is never yours whatever you're watching, does it bother you? Not that long ago I wanted to see all four of the \"Confessions Of...\" films which I couldn't find anywhere. I ended up buying the DVD box set containing all four films. Unfortunately, they're not on Blu-ray yet.\n\nI wanted to see all the TV episodes of On The Buses so I bought the DVD box set containing every single episode. I'm not 100% sure if any episodes are on there as I don't think I could see any. Neither any of the three spin-off films either I don't believe are on there. I haven't searched for any of the films again recently either as I no longer have Britbox due to the service being swallowed up by ITV X.\n\nWhen streaming you never know how long a programme you're watching will stay before getting taken down for some reason. Armeggedon by Ricky Gervais on Netflix was going to have parts of it cut for woke snowflake brigade, but it never happened... thank God!\n\nStreaming services may put up what is drawing in the most viewers and take off what's not. I know for a fact that Not The Nine O' Clock News was on Britbox US some time ago but not on our Britbox, unless this was to do with copyright reasons. This was a \"Best Of' series only.\n\nTo this day physical media is where you can find most films, drama & TV comedy, and even that could be taken down at the last minutes.\n\nApart from watching the TV I like to think that the media I'm watching belongs to me, even if it's just on a personal solid state drive.\n\nI could go on and on about what is on physical formats that isn't on any streaming services.\n\nDon't you feel that when you buy a DVD, Blu-ray & 4K Blu-ray (anything on physical media) that it's yours for good and no one can take that away, instead of virtually being being told what you can and can't watch?\n\nAnother big problem with some streaming services is the picture quality, even if it is an HD programme. Britbox suffered from this all the time. They had Hi-De-Hi on Britbox and I already had the DVD box set. The difference in picture quality was as different as chalk and cheese. On Britbox the picture was very lousy. I blamed this on them using too much compression. The DVDs were absolutely perfect for a programme made around that time and I'd say they looked like the broadcast quality. So not only could Hi-De-Hi be taken down at any time if they have a new season of comedy, the DVDs are such good picture quality and will be with you for as long as DVDs last. I know what I'll be sticking to.\n\nNetflix often admit that a show, such as a documentary will be available for a limited time only. I know other people feel like this regarding streaming and just wondered if anyone agreed with me on here?\n\nAlso, has the picture quality improved on the Britbox programmes since ITV X took over?\n\nThey have to use less compression now to be enough to for HD programmes as well. Any TV channel for example that broadcast in HD signal always contains older programmes in 480/576i in full broadcast quality or good DVD quality."
